        "Q: Okay. We are on now. Would you tell me your full name please?",
        "A: My full name is Yehudah Mandel, or in English Lewis Y. Mandel. The Y, of course, stands\nfor Yehudah.",
        "Q: Where were you born and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in a very small village called Csepe, spelled C-S-E-P-E in Hungary. That in the\npart of Hungary which was extremely religious. Later on, it became ___.",
        "Q: What year were you born?",
        "A: In 1904, March the 3rd.",
        "Q: Will you tell me about your parents and about your family as a young child?",
        "A: This village or rather the inhabitants, Jewish inhabitants of this village, were extremely\nreligious, very observant people, and so, of course, were my parents. My father who had\nordination to be a Rabbi studied in his youth as a...different Yeshivas, but he never was a\nRabbi to be employed as a Rabbi. My mother was a sweet, wonderful soul who\nunfortunately ended in Auschwitz. My father died at age 53. Now we were seven brothers\nand sisters. I had three sisters and beside myself...I'm the oldest one of the boys...there were\nother three boys. You want me to give you the names. No.",
        "Q: No. We'll get the names later.",
        "A: What...uh...Tell me about what your life was like as children.",
        "Q: As children, everybody's life was the same as mine, so I will tell you about my own life. At\nthe age of 3, 3 and a half, maybe 4...uh...I started to go to Cheder. That's the Jewish school.\nAnd I think when I was four, maybe 4 and a half years old, I read Hebrew very well. I, of\ncourse, didn't understand, but I knew how to read Hebrew very well. And I went on through\nthat Cheder and in that Cheder where we started first to learn prayers. Later on we extended\nto other things, like the Bible and so on. And...uh...this occupied our lives. We went to\nCheder in the morning about 6:30, stayed there, had a service in the Cheder proper, a daily\nservice, and at 8 o'clock, we had to go to the public school. We were in the public school\nuntil 11:00. From 11:00 to 12:00, we went back to the Cheder, and were there until noontime.\nThe main meal in Europe, you know, used to be in noontime. And...uh....in the\nafternoon, the same thing happened. After we had lunch, we went back to the regular school\nand...uh...at 4:00 when we were dismissed, we went back to Cheder until about 6:00 or 6:30.\nAnd this 1s...this was their current day by day, day after day.",
        "Q: What was it like being a Jew in that town? Was there much anti-Semitism? Were you\ncomfortable? This village had two...uh..churches. One was a Greek Catholic church, and the\nother was a reform church. The priest of the Greek Catholic church did announce before\nPassover...weeks before Passover...that now will come the time when the Jews are looking\nfor blood to the...for the Matzahs. Now you can imagine what impression this made on the\ninhabitants and the children who were taught by this priest and his helpers. So that it\nhappened that when we came out of the Cheder, our own age children were waiting for us\nwith big heavy sticks to beat up the Jewish children, Jews, because we killed Christ and so\non. That the...all, that's all they knew. The reformed priest...uh...priest, he was more\nconsilient. And from that school...from that church, we have never heard this kind\nof...uh...pronouncement, let's say.",
        "Q: As a young boy, you early became interested in music. Uh...Tell me how you became\ninterested in music and what happened with the music.",
        "A: I did not become or rather I wasn't able to study music, if you are referring to study music,\nand prepare myself for my profession. However, I knew one thing. I had a very nice,\npleasant voice and when I was 8 years old, let's say, it was a rarity to...to happen, I was\nchosen to perform on the three festival days, the evening service, the Maror service. And I\ndid that. And I had a very pleasant voice and that's all I knew, but there was no possibility to\nstudy music as much. I...I couldn't do that at all.",
        "Q: Tell us really about your growing up and how you did be...be able to study music eventually.",
        "A: I... was...I lived in my little community up to the age of my Bar Mitzvah. After Bar\nMitzvah, I left...uh...my village, and I went to study in a place. It was close by, about 15\nkilometers from our village. And I studied in Notchulus. That was the Capitol city of our\nState. I come from a State which was called Ugochar. And while being there, we had a\nspecial minyan for the Bikurim...for the Bikurim. And the Birkurim minyan.... uh...being that\nmy friends and the other students knew I have a pleasant voice I was always asked and...uh...\nsometimes forced to perform the services like the Musaf services on Sabbath or when it was\nRosh Hodesh, something like that. So from there on, I knew that I have voice...a voice and it\nseemed to be I have a nice voice because I was engaged by a ______ who... who....who served\na larger community to sing with him at...1n his choir on the High Holy Days. That was\nall musical...uh...preparation I could have.",
        "Q: Tell us about what happened. Follow your growing up for us.",
        "A: Now, I stayed in Nocholus for 2 years. And there I...we were not allowed to go to regular\npublic schools. We had to prepare our studies privately and take exams at end of the season,\nat end of the year in the public schools from or given by teachers who were public school\nteachers. And I finished there Junior High in Nocholus. I studied in Yeshiva, and studied\nprivately for the exams in the Junior...Junior High School. I stayed in Nocholus up until\n19...1918, and from there because the Rabbi in a certain big place, big congregation, big city,\nUmegra was a former schoolmate of my father and they studied together. They were ____.\nMy father insisted I should go to study in Umgra. I went and stayed there for close to 4\nyears. I got my first...uh....Hiruia from...from Umera.",
        "Q: Your what?",
        "A: Hiruia is the written...uh...document to be qualified as a Rabbi in _____, and from Umera, I\nstudied there up to the point where I was drafted into the Czech army. Now, in Umgra I don't\nhave to tell you it was an extremely...uh... religious community as well, and for instance, we,\n__ Bikurim who studied under this Rabbi who I told you about before, were told that when\nwe walk by the Reform Temple at a certain street we cannot...we shouldn't walk on the side\nof the temple. We have to cross the street and walk by to the next block and only then go\nback to that side of the street. This...from this can give you...uh...picture the way we lived.\nNow, one thing, however, was very good. The...uh...discipline, not only this which may\nsound here in America funny and foolish, but the discipline in every way was so immense,\nit's hard even to describe it. Everyone stuck to...to the...to the rules of...of Yeshiva, whatever\nit was. The best (clearing throat) (drinking water) (pause) To give you an idea how strict the\ndiscipline followed or...or prevailed there, I have to tell you a very little story. I had a nice\nvoice, and when I was already about 15 or 16 years old, somehow the cantor of that\ncommunity, of that congregation, which was strictly 100 percent an orthodox congregation,\nand their cantor was a man by the name Gottleb, who heard my voice and wanted me to join\nhis choir. My father, who was a _____ friend, former schoolmate of the Rabbi under whom I\nstudied, came especially to Umgra to speak to this Rabbi and ask him could I, would I,\nwould he allow me to sing in that choir. The Rabbi did not give me permission or whatever.\nHe used to go to that shul.",
        "Q: Okay. Take some water. Take your time.",
        "A: So I did not have the opportunity to study music even to the degree what this choir that sang\nin the Orthodox shul would have given me. And so I grew up without any musical\nbackground. However, I was a very good ___, which means I could lead any service and\nso on. The voice was nice and here I come again to a...to a story...uh...in Umgra. Again, my\nfriends who came together with me to Umgra from my previous Yeshiva knew that I have a\nnice voice and there was one Friday, a Rosh Hodesh. I'm sure you know what Rosh Hodesh\nIS.",
        "Q: Explain it for the camera please.",
        "A: It is the first day of the month where in the olden days, of course, sacrifices used to be\nintroduced in a...in the Holy Temple, and now we observe this beginning of the month by\nhaving special services. We have included Hallel and Musaf service and so on. Now the\nYeshiva in Umgra had a so-called ____ where the Bikurim, the students of the Yeshiva,\ncould get food. And they did. And people, very religious people from a neighboring village\ncalled or ___ in Yiddish used to deliver the milk for the Yeshiva it should\nbe...uh...100 percent kosher. And so...uh...uh...one day at______s~ where my classmates and\nother Bikurim forced me in...1n...1n to perform the service, the Musaf service. One man who\nbrought milk in the big can walked by and heard me. And he asked one of the Bikurim who\nis the ____ who 1s governing there. So he says he's not a ___.. He's just a one of us, ___.\nAnd the man then waited for me until I was finished and spoke to me. Because this was very\nclose to Umgra they would come and pick me up. Would I perform a service of Shavuot in\ntheir congregation...in his congregation. (Clearing Throat Pause) We went out there. Yeah.\nHe also said I can invite as many friends as I want and they won't come back empty handed.\nSo I performed the service, got paid...uh...in this ___ and my friends were loaded up with\nall kind of goodies. Butter and cheese and...and eggs and what not. So everyone was very\nhappy. Later on, this went from mouth to mouth and I was invited to different towns for little\ncongregations, bigger congregations. I became a star. And ]_____ and this maintained myself\nfinancially plus my two brothers who came to study in the same Yeshiva later.",
        "Q: When...as this developed, tell us what...when did you get your first...your own congregation?",
        "A: Now, after the Yeshiva...let me go back for a moment yet to the...to the Yeshiva. My\nfather...before the brother was the youngest, David, brought up my...my youngest brother in\nshort...in shorts to...to be introduced to the Rabbi and asked if he could join also. The three of\nus were already studying there, so maybe David could study too. And the Rabbi took a lot at\nhim with the short pants and said, \"No.\u201d He told my ....my father gave this Rabbi...uh...a lot\nof ...uh...uh...honor. They used to be on first name term as young people. He called him\nRebbe and he called my father Avrom. So he said to my father, \"Avrom, I don't have a\nCheder. I have a big Yeshiva.\u201d So my father told him. I ask of you one thing. Listen to this\nyoung boy with the___, the short pants. He knows the pages of Talmud by heart\nalmost. The Rabbi gave him an exam and told my father, \"You know what. Your fourth boy,\nDavid. Buy him long pants. He can study in Yeshiva.\u201d Now you asked me when did I get my\nfirst professional...uh...engagement let's say. (Pause - drinking water) Actually, I got my first\nprofessional engagement when I was drafted into the Czech army. We finished the semester\nin Yeshiva. And I had to report to the...uh...military on the Ist of October. However, it came\nout that the beginning of October were the High Holy Days. So I traveled and finally I got\nthe position ina place _______\u2014\u2014_. And there I done the whole service. There was an\northodox congregation where I did the main service, the Musaf and so on. And ____ in the\nOrgan Temple in____ uh...the _____ and other things. And actually, they paid me very well,\nand that was the amount of money I took along with me to the...to the Czech army and I was\nnever...uh...I had enough money to...to help myself if I needed.",
        "Q: Excuse me. By the Organ Temple, you mean the Reform Congregation.",
        "A: I mean the...1t wasn't Reform as in...no. In Hungary, there were...there were differences.\nThere was the Orthodox, the Nelro. Nelro_ didn't mean reform. It just meant that Jewish\ncongregations were something like...here let's say, they're conservative. Some of them had\norgans. Some even had...had mixed choirs and there was the status quo when the\ntwo...namely, this is history, when orthodox departed from the Nelro congregations, there\nwere some who didn't go on either side, but remained where they were status quo. No\nchange.",
        "Q: Thank you. Okay. So you're now leaving the Czech army. What happened?",
        "A: I served in the Czech army and maybe it's a very interesting thing too. And indicative of my\nlife and the way I...the way we were disciplined and the way we lived. At..uh...the basic\ntraining which everyone had to follow...follow through, I think at the beginning of\nNovember when the birthday of the President of Czechoslovakia, at the time, Masaryk,\nwhich was President, was celebrated. Uh...First Lieutenant came out to the training grounds\nand asked if is there...1f there 1s someone who has a nice voice and could sing the Yanick\npartinthe_ ds I never in my life up to the 20th birthday was in a movie or knew\nwhat opera is or knew what a note 1s or knew what music ...musical training is, but my\nfriends who were from the same Yeshiva and in the same...uh...group...uh...told me, \"Why\ndon't you tell them. Why don't you go? You...you have a nice voice.\u201d So finally one of them\ntold him that this young man has a nice voice. And...uh...he said, \"What he wants? Do I\nknow what opera 1s? Could I learn it?\" I said, \"No, I have no idea what you are talking\nabout.\u201d So he gave me an order on a certain hour to see him 1n his office. He was the\nsuperintendent for...uh...entertainment for the...uh... military. The Czech army stressed very\nmuch learning of any kind. There were many, many people who came into the army and\ndidn't know how to read and write. So the army taught them. And finally, he gave me an\norder to be in this hour, in a certain hour in his...uh...office. I went there. Uh...He asked me\ndo I know this? Do I know? \"No, I know nothing.\u201d So the end was that he asked me to sing\nsomething, anything I want. So I sang a Hungarian song. And...uh...he liked it, and after that\nmaybe for weeks and weeks, he taught me phrase by phrase, note by note the melody what to\nsing, how to sing. At the time, I didn't even speak Czech yet. So that was another question.\nHowever, I learned everything. And you know, at the time I was young and...and the\nbrain...uh...uh...was good so I...and the ear was good. I learned it. He said, \"I will be along\nside of you at this performance. I will tell you and push you in when you have to go in and\ndo and sing this and that. And I will motion to you when you have to come out.\u201d And this is\nthe way the...uh..._._~\u2014~\u2014S\u2014\u2014s went over. You can imagine what a great performance\n(laughing) it was...it was, but that's...that's the way it was.",
        "Q: When did you leave the army?",
        "A: In 1926, April. I had a plan because I was influenced by a brother of my latest teachers,\nLitest Smiller, who told me that I have a beautiful voice, but it...it is not worth too much. I...I\ndon't know how to...I don't know any music. So I want...I thought.... Yeah. One more thing\nabout this...uh...First Lieutenant. This First Lieutenant went to the point, because he liked my\nvoice and so on, and was a very decent person and said, \"You have a beautiful voice. I will\napply to the Division.\u201d That's...uh...[ don't know how many...uh...to the Division of...of I\ndon't know what part of the military. \"We have scholarships. I will try to get you a\nscholarship where you will be able to study for 4 years in the Academy and prepare yourself\nfor...for...uh... operatic career.\u201d I was flabbergasted and I didn't know how to handle it, and I\ndidn't dare even to tell my parents, namely my father, that this kind of a happiness and great\ncareer was standing before me. However, I had an uncle, my brother...my mother's brother\nwho was a lawyer, who studied in Budapest and came down, was a lawyer later on in our\nvicinity. Was about 40 miles...40 kilometers from our village. I wrote to him. I didn't dare to\napproach my father directly. So he went over and told my father about this big luck,\ntremendous thing what...what I'm confronted with. And my father's answer was,\n\"Moshe,\"...that was his...my uncle's name....\"\"We have four sons and three daughters. If\n... that's my Yiddish name...will do that he will go to the ____ and _ desecrate the\nSabbath, and desecrate the High...the Holy Days and sing in this career,\" which in my...in his\nown opinion wasn't...uh...the way a Yid should lead his life, \"then please tell me that we have\nonly three sons and three girls.\u201d That's a cruel thing, but 1t ended my operatic career, so when\nI came home... My father wanted, of course...I was already 20...1n my 2Ist year, I should get\nmarried and settle there in a beautiful store, very rich people, and the only thing I would have\nto do is count the money and be in the...and so on. Uh...So I didn't want this. I wanted still to\ngo privately and study music. And my father didn't give in on the other hand, so the deal\nbetween us was made. No Academy of music. No marriage. But back to Yeshiva. And then I\nwent back to Yeshiva to Pressberg where I studied for about...uh...2 years and that was my\nlast Yeshiva, and there I got my second _____ which 1s....you know what a ___ 1s?",
        "Q: Explain it for the camera.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: ______ is again a written document of the Rabbinic court that the person is qualified to be a\nRabbi. That was the second part. From there, from Vienna which 1s very close to...from\n_, Pressberg, which is very close to _____ once in a...1n awhile I used to go to Vienna. I had\na teacher there and there I already I already started to learn some music. However, I stayed\nthe Yeshiva. I... couldn't leave the Yeshiva.",
        "Q: Did you father and the Yeshiva head know that you were study?",
        "A: He wouldn't have like it. He wouldn't have like it. Uh... Maybe he wouldn't have minded my\nknowledge of the music, but he surely would have minded that I'm leaving Yeshiva and go\nto there to study. Now in Pressberg there were many smaller congregations, synagogues and\nthey knew that I knew how to ____.. They invited me. And this is what I made a living for\nmyself from, and this is what gave me the opportunity financially to travel to Vienna and\ntake some lessons. So there it started. One Saturday, when] ____ after the ___, a man\ncame over to me and told me he is from Vienna. He works in Vienna. He's originally from\nPressburg, works in Vienna at _____ and is a member of a congregation called\nTemple. \u2014\u2014\u2014s and their ___, a young man just left and he thinks I will be the proper\nperson for them. Why don't I apply? So the next time when I went to...uh... Vienna, I applied.\nThey invited me for a Shavuot ...uh...to perform the services. I performed the services and I\nwas elected to be their cantor, and was with them for about 3 years, something like that.\nAfter this, there was a___ written out for...uh..the _____\u2014 looked for a cantor for its 21st\n.

Now when I applied for this...uh...congrega...for this position at\nthe ,",
        "Q: In Vienna?",
        "A: This is in Vienna. When I applied, there was to my luck, a person by the name Gross, Mr.\nGross, who every year for the needs of his business traveled to the Leipzig international\nmarket. And on his way home to...back to Novi Sad, where he lived, by special permission\nhe listened to the applicants which...uh...were quite a few. I think a hundred, over a hundred\napplied, and 16 people were given permission ___. In order words, a check...checkup\non the person who eventually will get permission to perform a service.

        "A: No. This is already in Novi Sad from...from Vienna. You see this man, this Mr. Gross was\nfrom Novi Sad. And...uh...1 came down, gave the so-called Proba, the trial service and I was\nelected. Few...few days later I got a phone call I'm elected. On the 28th of April 1928, I came\ndown as the elected chief cantor of the congregation in Yugoslavia in the town of Novi Sad.\nI lived there and married there...uh...for...I married...I lived there for 6 years. I had a\n...uh...lifetime agreement given to me by that congregation the third or fourth year. And if\nyou are interested, I will tell you what happened from there.",
        "Q: Yes. Let's go from Novi Sad.",
        "A: Yeah. In Novi Sad I had a magnificent position. There was one congregation. No small\nshuls. No side temples. No nothing. One congregation with 800 Jewish families, an organ, a\nmagnificent choir of 40, a choir leader, an organist. In other words, the service was\norganized better than any one or as good as anyone could imagine. As I say, I served there\nfor 6 years. Between the 5th and 6th year, I get a letter from a man by the name Mr. __ from\nall places in Kovno, from Kovno. He writes to me and says, namely in the 30s. This was\naround the 30s. I started to give concerts of Jewish content, of synagogue contents, let's say,\nin the state radio in Belgrade. And I used to give these concerts and he heard me and\nsaid...he wrote in Yiddish that he liked what he heard and he would like to know if I would\nbe willing to come down to that part of the world, Kovno and so on, to give a few concerts.\nMoney is no problem, and in order to make sure that I understand it money is no problem, he\nwill have in a few days write to me and suggest to me by an official office concert bureau,\nand this bureau, which is a recognized concert arranger and organizer, will write to me and I\nshould be in contact with them, tell them what I want, and he is backing it, and money is no\nproblem. I shouldn't forget that. So when I started to prepare for this road from south...he\nwas from Yugoslavia, which was south, ....uh...to the cold vicinity of Kovno, Russia...former\nRussia, my own family asked me, \"Are you crazy? You have the most magnificent position\nhere. Everyone likes you. You have no problem. You make three times as much money as\nyou can spend. Even your wife is...1is engaged by the State.\u201d She was a school teacher.\n\"Where are you running? What are you trying to accomplish? What are you trying to do?\"\nHowever, as a young man...let's not forget, in 1933 I was still only a very young, very, very\nyoung man. And I was interested what's on the other side. So I went. And I sanged two\nSaturdays. I performed services in Kovno, in the so-called ____. That's a big time temple\nthere. And...uh...I sang twice for the benefit of Yeshivas,____ Yeshiva. And all under his\nguidance. This man...this Mr. __ was a millionaire, very rich person, and he had part of\nhis...of his mansions, so to say, advice given to me so that I can study and sing and learn and\ndo whatever I want and he made sure that one of his...uh...uh...carriages...uh... Of course, it\nwas a catriage and horse wagon will take me whenever I have to go to rehearsal, whenever I\nhave to go for a...for a choir practice and so on. And I was there for about 2 weeks.\nSuddenly, and everything was beautiful, very good. So suddenly, one Shavuot he introduces\nme to a man by the name Mr. Becker. Mr. Becker was the President of the ___ in Riga.\nAnd Mr. Becker told me, \"They are seeking the services of a Hazan for 2 years already.\n_ was their cantor before I came there, and they would like very much if I could come over\nfor...to give a audition in the ___. I went and performed services and it was left\nto...rather they had 82 people for... uh...to audition, and they...they were left with three. One\nwas their former cantor, ___, who was a great opera singer in his time, and the second\nwas aman by the name _____ who was...came from...uh...from Yohannesburg, and\nmyself. In Riga, it developed to be a great...uh...a great affair let's say. There were the\n___,andthe_____\u2014, and the_____. However, there was a great ___, the so-called\n____ with whom I became very friendly. And...uh...when these people just couldn't get to\nfirst base and many people wanted me and this...uh...the end was____\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_ told them, \"If\nyou want, you'll take Mandel. If you want opera singer, you take ____ and so\non.\u201d So finally, I was elected in the _____\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014, and we went there. And we lived in Riga\nfor 3 years. As a matter of fact, Manny was born in Riga.",
        "Q: Okay. So you are in Riga. It was 36, 37, early 38. What was it like. What were conditions\nlike in Riga at that point?",
        "A: This is a very good question. I will answer it to you. My answer to my own people who\ncriticize me that I'm leaving Novi Sad was this Mr. Becker took me, showed me Riga. First\nof all, he got a magnificent city. Not that there's anything wrong with Novi Sad, but Riga\nwas a magnificent city. A tremendously, culturally developed...high culture in every way\nyou can mention. There was a steady opera. There were Jewishly spoken. Mr. Becker took\nme not only to Yeshivas, but he took me to day schools where the teaching went on from\nkindergarten on up to university. Everything was taught in Hebrew. And these schools were\nrecognized as regular schools and you could go to any university with a diploma from that\nschool, from those schools. And I said to myself and with my wife, \"Look, 1f we will ever\nhave a child, let me him go to this kind of a school because there is Yiddish ___ and\n_, Jewish...Jewishness and humanism bound together as I have rarely seen it anywhere else.\nAnd this was one of the reasons we went to Riga. In Riga, we acquired many, many\nfriends...many, many admirers. However, when...uh...the call came from Budapest that they\nneed a Hazan in___ Temple, I thought this 1s still the highest point any cantor can...can\nlook for or wait for, namely Riga itself as beautiful congregation as it was, it wasn't an\norganized congregation, let's say like Budapest you know where law ruled the congregation,\nwhere church and...uh...and faith was...was divided. So after long, long, long speculation and\nconsideration, we...we decide we both were born in Hungary, spoke Hungarian very well,\nand...uh...and we decided to leave Riga. Now, how I came to Budapest is the story...",
        "Q: We're going to have to condense it. Can you just tell us about being in Budapest.",
        "A: Now, I came to Budapest, and I put it this way. I came to Budapest in 1936. I was elected\nand I did not go back to Riga anymore because I was concerned if I go back, I won't be able\nto...to leave there. Because people and I have many, many friends and admirers and so I\nstayed in Riga...1n Budapest, with the excuse that I will start now to rehearse for the High\nHoly Days. In Budapest, there were two main temples. One was the traditional where I\nserved, the ______ Temple, and the other was the ______- Temple. The ____ was bigger,\nhad close to 5,000. Still stands. That's the only synagogue which was...remained so-to-say in\nexistence, in comparatively good shape. And in our...in other words, the Dohine Temple had\nan organ, had a mixed choir, men and women, and...uh...very fine choir leader. The\nwas a traditional temple. In our temple, there were 40 in the choir, men and children, soprano\nand___ were sung by children. Now...uh...I started as I said in 1936 and was in Budapest\nthe chief cantor of the ____ Temple for 10 years. You have also to know that the Budapest,\nthe Pest ___ because at the time it wasn't Budapest __ yet. It was Pest. And the Pest\n__ community had synagogues according to need in every district. If two were needed, there\nwere two synagogues. But chief cantors and chief Rabbis were only in the ____ and\nTemple. So the Dohime Temple had two chief cantors, and the ___ Temple had two chief\ncantors. In the Dohime, there was ______\u2014 and in the _____ was Bornstein and Mandel.\nUh...In these congregations, you asked me before if there were many people. There were so\nmany people, the ____ Temple had about..uh...3,000 seats. So many people that because it\nwas a narrow street, police had to be brought in every time when we had services in order\nthat when the people leave the synagogue they shouldn't kill each other. And this I think is a\nvery interesting thing, and I want to include it in this discussion here. We were down as I\nhave already said, we...I served in..uh...Budapest 10 years, from 1936 to 46. In 41, I think it\nwas...",
        "Q: Let's not jump. Okay. Let's...Let's try to stay in order here. Okay?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. Uh...Things began to change. You were here as the...the chief cantor, but the world\naround you began to change in 1938.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: 1939,",
        "A: The first...",
        "Q: How did things begin to change?",
        "A: The first and second...uh...Jewish law against the Jews rather. You know what that means.\nJewish law. That meant Jews couldn't hold any positions at government. Jews couldn't later\non have even their own business. Uh...Non-Jews couldn't have been seen by Jewish doctors.\nJews couldn't serve as physicians 1n...1n hospital or even have their own office. This was\nin...started in 1938 and continued in 1939 and went on to the point when...uh...the German\nthen occupied Hungary finally. But as far as...uh...the beginning 1s concerned, it was...when I\ncame to Budapest, I was given working papers, so-called working papers, permission to\nwork as a non-Hungarian citizen in Hungary for...I got permission for 4 years. In other\nwords, I should have been in good order up until 1940. But as soon as...after the first High\nHoly Days. That means before 1937 already, the French policei. The ones who controlled the\npeople who...who are not citizen butt in and they made sure that we will be asked to leave\nHungary or arrest us. So that danger was tremendously big and that was the time when I\nthink in 1938 or the beginning of 39, I went to London to try out there. And I was elected.\nHowever, I came back to Budapest because 3 days after this...uh...Saturday when I\nperformed services, the President of that congregation, I should have been\nelected to be the cantor of the Dukes Place Synagogue. But this wasn't to be because the\nnight after we...we had a meeting with the Board, I got a telegram from Budapest sent to me\nby Secretary General saying your case is in good order again. We expect you home lovingly.\nSo, being that my family was already settled in Budapest and so on, I didn't ask for expenses.\nI didn't ask anything. I ran like crazy and went back and...uh...went back to Budapest. It\nseems It's all fate because I could have...I could have just signed the agreement and stayed in\nLondon, but no, it wasn't to be. So I came back to Budapest. Now, during these terrible\nyears, 38, I was...the first time I was called into labor camp was in 38 or the beginning in 39\nbecause the big trouble really continued, which started as a said before that the doctors\ncouldn't be doctors. The lawyers could be lawyers. The professionals couldn't be\nprofessionals anymore. It expanded to the point where me, at the time, yet younger Jews\nwere called into labor camp and I was one of them. I was called in and...uh...I served for the\nfirst time in...not too far from Budapest, in a place Shirastopeck, meaning nothing. We built\nairports. I'm asking you for what. I don't think an airplane ever... ever appeared there. But we\ndid. Just to...to make it hard on us. And this went on almost to the very end. The first two\nyears I would say 38, 39 and maybe the beginning of 40. Yeah. I was still within the border\nof Hungary. I was called in many, many times, but not over...not sent over the border. Later\non...uh...toward the end of the...of the war, we were in Galicea. We were in Poland. We were\nin former Russia up to the Dunn River we went, and that's the way they ___ us and gave\nus difficulties. They finally...",
        "Q: We don't..We want to go to the end. Okay?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The thing I would like to do is (coughing) is to pause here and change tapes and then we go\nback. I want to know more about the labor camp. Okay.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Okay. We're on. Yes. The camera is back on. Uh...Cantor Mandel, in Budapest around 1941\nwith all of this happening, what was it like for you, for your family, inside the house?",
        "A: It was terrible and worse yet in other families, but as far as I and we were concerned, I was\nstill employed by the congregation. I got my monthly check and we could make a living.\nHowever, my mother remained at the time still in that village where I was born. My father\nhas died already, so I brought her up to...to Budapest and she lived for a very short while in\nour house and later on, she lived...my brother became a student at the Rabbinical Seminary at\nthe University because that was...uh...the Seminary student had to finish college as well.\nThey had to get a degree from the university. So in order to save him from labor camp when\nhe came up, I made sure that he is...he will be there as a student of the Rabbinical...of the\nRabbinical...the Rabbinical...uh...seminary. It was no problem because he had a tremendous\namount of Hebrew knowledge. And...uh...in...uh...1939, 40, even the beginning of 41, if we\nwanted to get something good, it had to be sent to us from Novi Sad. For instance, we...we\nneeded some meat for Passover, so my in-laws sent with a cert....by a certain man, who was\nthe superintendent of our buildings in Novi Sad, they sent up...I don't know...geese and\nwhatever we needed. Uh...Jews...later after the second law again the Jews couldn't go out to\nthe store at any time during the day and buy anything. They had a certain hour or two...I\ndon't remember exactly...during the day when they could go out. And of course when\nthey...when they could go out everything was gone. It was a very, very hard life with a lot of\nthings missing. We were very lucky because my in-laws who lived in Yugo...in Yugo...again\nthat was formerly Yugoslavia was Hungary again. They helped us out with many things.\nNow, as far as within the family, everything was fine because we had the...the benefit of the\nbig congregation and everyone knew...uh...who we are and didn't bother us too much.\nHowever, when it came to...uh...being a Jew it didn't make any difference when the...when it\nwas handled by the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazis. And so...",
        "Q: What does that mean?",
        "A: It means that when the hack and cross, the...the Hungarian Nazis, you know, came because\nthey were members of...of their...their organization, and they wanted you to show them\nwhere you are born and then you have the right to be here and you are a Hungarian citizen.\nEven if you were a Hungarian citizen, it didn't mean a thing because the laws\ncovered...covered already everything what could destroy Jewish life or Jews in general.\nNow, when a family cannot go out and cannot live their own lives for...for...this 1s against\nthe law, that's a terrible, terrible thing. I did one more thing in Budapest which I probably\nhave never mentioned, but I will mention it now. This Mr. Epler, who was the Secretary\nGeneral of the congregation, after the first Jewish law, after the first law against the\nJew....when that was passed, he asked me if I could help out in the congregation and\norganize a district in the 7th district, which didn't exist before. People were taken up or rather\nthrown out from their own homes and they were moved together with other people, so there\nwas a big problem. One family was kosher, kosher; the other wasn't. One family had old\npeople; the other had the young people and children. But they were moved together in\napartments, and other apartments were taken away because there were some districts where\nthe Jews couldn't live at all, and these Jews had to be placed where this was still a possibility\nfor them to live. Now, I organized the 7th inner district at the time, and made sure that we\nknow who is a Jew, who is not a Jew, who keeps a kosher home; who doesn't; and so and so\nthat they forced getting together of these families in one apartment instead of three or four\nwas let's say a little bit easier done than it could have been done if this information wouldn't\nhave been available. And I was the secretary of that 6th...7th district for quite awhile\n(drinking water) so that we had a complete listing of the Jews who lived around us, about...\nYeah, and this, of course, was already done and allowed to be done by the Germans and the\nHungarian Nazis because this was preparatory to the ghetto so that the Jews would be\ntogether already. And this was done. Now what is your next question?",
        "Q: What happened to you as the years progressed?",
        "A: As the years progressed, 1940... Yeah, all the time, starting from 1938, either I was home for\n4 weeks and then called back to the labor camp and was there for 2 months let's say. And I\nhad the congregation force their way through their influences that I was allowed again to\ncome home for let's say the month of the...of the High Holy Days or any holiday or Pesach or\nShuef. So I came home and I stayed home for...for the time I was allowed to stay home...to\nstay home. And the winter months as a rule were taken more easy than the summer months.\nSummer months we almost constantly were in camp and for the winter months, sometimes\nwe were allowed to...uh...g0 home and we lived there. Now what happened for instance, I\ncan tell you one interesting thing about 1941 if we have time. In 1941, my sister-in-law who\nlived in Novi Sad, came for a visit to Budapest. And at the time our son, Emmy...Manny,\nwas a very small child. He was born in 1936, and this sister-in-law, who loved him with all\nher heart, she told my wife, her sister, \"Look, the child has a cold. He's coughing and all that.\nNovi Sad is still about a 100 kilometer south. I will take him down. Maybe his cough with\nsubside easier there.\u201d So we went with her and...uh...I made arrangements because there\nwere two chief cantors in___ Temple that my colleague who was with me will take\nover all my duties for Sunday. There were many, many weddings and all kinds of things. He\nwill take over, and I will take over for him the next time when it's his next. So we went down\nto Novi Sad on Thursday and stayed with this sister-in-law in her apartment and Friday\nmorning before...at dawn, my father-in-law, who lived close by, came over to his daughter,\nto us, to tell her, tell us, inform us that there is a pogrom outside and the Jews and ____ are\npicked up and congregated somewhere. So it was a terrible thing. That was a Friday.\nWe...we waited in the house. About II:00 the gendarme with full glairy, fixed up with his\nmachine gun and all that came to take us to a certain spot where the Jews were con...were\ngathered, and from there they were marched down to the Danube. We didn't know that this\nwill happen, but this 1s what it was. The Jew...the ____ and the Jews were down...were taken\ndown to the Danube River. The Danube River was frozen maybe...I don't know how many\ninches thick, but they...they threw some...uh...material, some military bomb or something\ninto the water, probed the....uh...the thing open...ice, the ice open and took the people into a\nplace where they had to undress and naked to go on the trampoline which was over the\nDanube River, and they were shot into the River. They were shot and fell into the River.\nNow, this went on for a long time. We saw trucks arriving there with ___ and Jewish\npeople and they were all put into a line. I think a line of two and there was always a\ngendarme or a policeman who was told and informed by the government that all these people\nwho are being...who are being taken here are being taken here because they are the enemies\nof Hungary. The really...the newly occu...back occupied Hungary because you know that\nwas Yugoslavia. It was Hungary, then Yugoslavia, then the Hungarians occupied it again. So\nwhen our next came, before us was standing the owner of the house...uh... where my sister-\nin-law lived. When our next came, the policeman came over. I was holding Manny in my\ncoat, in my fur coat because he...he had fever, and...uh...he took a look at me and\nsaid...uh...\"\"What are you doing here? Chief Cantor, what are you doing here? You are not a\nCzechnik?\" Czechnik meant the...the people who hated Hungary. The serp people and\nothers who hated Hungary. You are no Czechnik. And he was all terribly excited, and ran\nover to the Lieutenant who was there was in charge and told him, \"The...the Chief Cantor\nfrom the ____ is here. He's...he's not a cheknik. He's... know him, and I 'm there many\ntimes.\" Namely, as I told you before, the _____ Temple was a very narrow street and\nbecause people were pouring out and would have been in danger, endangered each other, so\nhe was...he and other 10 people were there and he was in charge of that group of policeman.\nSo he knew me very well. And this while he was running back and forth, and at the third or\nfourth try, the lieutenant told him, \"Put him aside. Stand him...let him stand aside.\u201d This\nsaved our lives because Hortee (pause - drinking water) Hortee then called off the killing,\nand this is when it stopped at our ____. So 1f anyone will tell me this story, I wouldn't\nbelieve it, but it's true.",
        "Q: Can you go back to that scene with these people at the River? Tell me what it was like, what\nyou saw, and what you were like. What was the scene like at the River?",
        "A: The scene was...the scene was 29 degrees celsius. People were crying, and when we heard\ntut, tut, tut, tut, another few shots, we...we knew what's happening. We imagined what's\nhappening. And people were crying and hollering and...and throwing themselves to the floor,\nto the ground and as...as...as...as can well be imagined what happened. But before we should\nhave gone in and be the next ones to be killed, the killing stopped. From there, we were\ntaken into a...into a gymnasium...uh...walked back and...uh...when we spoke about where we\nare going and...and what happened, the...uh....one of the policeman was walking along side\nwith us told me, \"You are very lucky people. I don't know if you know what's happened\ninside the they called it. It was a bathing stop at the Danube in Novi Sad all the time,\nand then it became the killing spot. So he said, \"You are very lucky people. You don't\nknow....do you know what happened inside?\" And...uh...he told us the story. It was Friday\nafternoon when we arrived to this gymnasium where we were held...uh...for a couple of\nhours and told that now we are clear...we are in the clear. Everything is fine because it was\nproved that we are not chekniks. And then we went home to our apartment and, of course, as\nyou...we didn't stay. Saturday evening we went home, back to Budapest. In Budapest, it\nwas...this kind of thing at the time did not happen yet. 41. It happened many times after that\nin 42 and 43 when groups of 50 and...and maybe hundred were gathered and were taken to\nthe Danube River by 10 or 12 and shot into the River. This happened. Later on, this became\na daily occurrence in 43 and...uh...and 44.",
        "Q: Did you see some of these roundups?",
        "A: The roundups I did see because even from the place where I stayed... My family wasn't with\nme at the time. They were in Bergen-Belsen at the time because...uh...there was... uh...an\neffort to save some people, and there were sixteen hundred and some people...Jews who\nwere transported from Budapest to...uh...through...through different stops, but finally they\ngot to Bergen Belsen. This was a Catholic group if you know about it.",
        "Q: Alright. I would like you to pause. I would like you to tell us the story of how your family\nbecame part of the group that went to Bergen Belsen.",
        "A: Now, my family became part of...of this Bergen Belsen, the Kosner group as they called\nit...uh...because my brother and I were very active in Zionistic work and the people knew\nthat so whoever was in charge of this Kosner group they said...though I wasn't home at the\ntime... was probably in the Ukrainian at the time already...they said, \"Though ____ (that's\nmy Hungarian name) isn't home, we cannot forget...uh...Ella and...and their...their son,\nEmmy, and they...they were engaged and my brother-in-law's still there as a Rabbinical\nstudent he was not taken into...into labor camp. So he was extremely active. He probably had\nsomething to do with it to...to bring it to the attention of the people.",
        "Q: You would have been in the Ukraine in labor camps?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: In labor camps?",
        "A: Labor camps. And my family was...was in Budapest. So they were taken with the Kosner\ngroup. First it was that they go straight to Israel, then it was said the...as I hear now from\npeople who were part of the group...uh...they were...they were supposed to go to Auschwitz\nand finally, they made up to go to Bergen-Belsen.",
        "Q: How did you find out that your family had been taken?",
        "A: I did not find out...uh...until I didn't come back...until I didn't escape in...uh... November, the\nend of November. In____, I left the company, __ company, and we walked mainly\nnighttimes...uh...",
        "Q: Excuse me. I'm confused. Could we stop?",
        "A: Yeah. Go ahead.",
        "Q: You are in which town where? You are in where?",
        "A: Now, you have to understand what happened.",
        "Q: Yes, please.",
        "A: As the Germans got...got...as...the Russians performed their attacks against the Germans\npushing them from east to west, so the labor camp people...the labor camp laborers, Jews,\nwere always pushed together with them. Why? Because the Germans and even the\nHungarians had a tremendous amount of food and other necessities in different places and\nwe had to hurry up and load the wagons and...and trains for them that their material should\nbe taken...uh...westwards instead of being taken by the Russians. So we moved always with\nthis ...with this attack. (Cough) And finally, when we got to ShotroyRehe, I heard that....at\nShotroyRehe, there is an organization (coughing - drinking water) which takes the Jews in\nthe direction of Vienna they told us at the time and whoever cannot walk is shot. So I spoke\nto a few people who I could reach and told them I am doing this. If you want to come with\nme, maybe a great risk but this 1s what I will do. And that must have been the beginning of\nNovember. When we were already pushed back to the point of...uh...my birthday's let's\nSay...OF...0F",
        "Q: November of what year?",
        "A: November of 1944. And so we left the company and tried to get in the direction of Budapest\nand it took about 10 or 12 or 14 days until we accomplished our goal to get to Budapest.",
        "Q: Could you tell me...Really, I would like to know how you got away from the camp and what\nthat walk was like.",
        "A: The...the getting away from the camp was simply take a risk every second of the...of that\ntime to be shot by a Hungarian Nazi. Not necessarily a...a man, but a 12, 13 year old boy\nwho had a gun and if he shot a Jew, they probably gave him a thank you. Not...uh....he\ndidn't...he wasn't exposed to any punishment or anything of that. And this is the way we got\naway. We just slipped away, left everything what we had, and had the same clothes and the\nsame shoes, maybe sometimes without soles, but we...we went in the direction of Budapest\nbecause we thought there is the revenge. I remember walking through a town\nimmediately...uh...the...at the border of Budapest where there were Hungarian papers who\nsaid THE FALL OF BUDAPEST IS EXPECTED ANY HOUR. THE RUSSIANS ARE\nHERE AND THERE IN THIS AND THIS SPOT. And when I came to Budapest the ghetto,\nof course was...I...we...we didn't know that there was a ghetto in Budapest. The ghetto was\nalready working. The Jews were already concentrated in the ghetto. As I heard later, the\nGermans have prepared to...uh...to put some bombs tn the ghetto and...and to kill all the Jews\nwho are there, but this didn't happen and when J arrived in...uh... Budapest the 17th of\nNovember, I took my life.... I knew already that my family is in Rome.",
        "Q: How?",
        "A: Because my...the place where we lived was part of the ghetto, and a friend of mine who lived\nin one of the so-called...uh...houses which were...which were not... which were except...an\nexception and not ghetto...how did they call them?",
        "Q: Protected house?",
        "A: Protective house. Uh...He told me that my family went with this and group to the Kosner\ngroup and he doesn't know where they are now, but they are not home. Ella and the child and\nanother...uh...relative's child of ours went with my brother and my wife to...with...with the\nKosner group.",
        "Q: Tell us what you.... You can slow down. Please. Tell us what your reaction was when you\nheard this news.",
        "A: My reaction was...first, I will...I will...I'll start at the first reaction which I got when I arrived\nand I took my life into my life into my hand because you couldn't walk into the ghetto and\nwalk out of the ghetto. So we were about...I was about 2 blocks let's say from the place\nwhere our apartment was and I at one...one early morning, as I have said, took my life into\nmy hands and through all kinds of machinations, I got to the place where our apartment...the\nhouse where our apartment was. Our apartment was on the top floor, magnificent apartment,\nwith Persian rugs and pictures and this and that. And every piece of furniture in that\napartment was done by the...by the ___ meister, you know. And when I came in through\nthe bombings and so on, snow...this was the top apartment. Snow was falling in...uh ...very\nfreely on the rugs. And the...the where we had our dishes, let's say, which Rosenthal dishes,\nthere were pieces on the floor because a bomb hit it. And..uh...I was told\nthat...that...uh...uh...80...80 some people are living in our apartment. At the time when I came\ninto the apartment, it was not locked and I could in...could get in to the apartment, and I saw\nthere is no roof. There is no...nothing. Now, this was the first impression. The family isn't\nthere. This is the picture I found, so if I didn't get a heart attack there, right then and there, it\nis Just by...by the grace of God. From there, I went back to this friend who told me about my\nfamily with the Kosner, __ Kosner_ group and we started to speculate, \"What can I do?\" So\nI, at the time I was quite young yet and my face was full and I looked like a real peasant so\nthe idea was by the people who led this rescue mission there, that the best thing for me\nwould be to pose as a non-Jew who was on the front and came home now...uh...because\nof...uh...he got hurt and was in the hospital. And of course, I got papers for all this because\nthe...our...our machinery worked perfectly to make any kind of false papers. And I got those\npapers. I was called a runner. What was the runner? Uh...The Schutzpass business started.\nWas already on at the time when I came home, when I arrived home in\n1944...uh...November, December, so the... the request to me was made. I should be a runner\nfor that commission about whom no one knew, at least we thought so, and they will give me\npapers as a Goy who was...who was injured on the frontline and came home and now I'm\nhere on...uh...rehabilitation and spend the time in Budapest. The assignment really was to go\nto the...the...uh... Swedish man, Raul...uh...",
        "Q: Wallenberg?",
        "A: Wallenberg. To the Wallenberg offices, get the Schutzpasses, be told where they have to be\ntaken because they were in contact, and I as a Hungarian soldier can walk on the street\nfreely...uh...I...1t wasn't so, but...but that's the way it was planned and I should take these\nSchutzpasses to the different spots where they are needed. This was my work after I came\nback from...from labor camp let's say. Many times I did something else. People were by the\nhundreds maybe thousands gathered in the concentration prison. There was such a thing in\nPest, and there they were not only mishandled and so on, but many, many terrible things\nhappened to them. Once we were told that in the Tolence house, that's the place from where\nthey are thrown over the border, there...I don't know how many people...and we...the people\nwho were assigned for this mission, dressed up in Hungarian gendarme uniforms and went to\nthe place where they were gathered. This is in this case the Tolance house prison. And we\ncursed them and we said the worse things about the Jews and so, but we took I don't know\nmaybe 50 or 60 Jews, and we had machine guns and ____ and we...we ...we got them out.\nThe ________\u2014 got them out by false papers, of course, that we will take care of them. We are\nHungarian gendarme , and we will take care of them. We'll...we'll... ___. And so they were\ngiven to us and we marched them back to different spots, different places.\nThese...uh...houses which were...uh...saved I'd say or posted as non-___ as non ___. And\nthis is...this 1s...between these two occupations, there didn't remain too much time\ntoo...uh...you know.",
        "Q: Can you...did you ever meet Raul Wallenberg?",
        "A: Yes, I met him many times. But I... never had a chance to sit down with him for 5 minutes\nbecause as...even if he was in the office when I came there and there was not one of us...he\nwas in different places.",
        "Q: You're talking about Raoul?",
        "A: Raoul Wallenberg. Yes. He was there and he saw me and secretaries and so on knew who I\nam and they told him. And he said...he spoke German there. He said, \"Give him...Give him\nwhatever he has to get fast. Let him go because every minute 1s a loss.\u201d And they...they used\nto give me the papers, these Schutzpasses, big pieces of paper. They looked beautiful\nfalsifications. And I used to ___, so I...his...there I had an interview with some people\nfrom...from one of the Scandinavian universities whom I don't remember anymore. Time\nago. And...uh...he asked me, \"Tell me the most important thing you can...you can think about\nwhen you think of Wallenberg.\u201d So I told him, \"You know what it is.

        "Q: What was the scene like inside the Wallenberg offices? Was this in the Consulate or was this\nelsewhere?",
        "A: Yes. There...there...there were offices, official offices where only the Consulate or close by.\nThey occupied another room or something. They did the best they could. There wasn't you\ngo out and rent an apartment or rent an office. They did it the best they could. The official\nbusiness was always handled from the Consulate itself. The non-officials, the falsifications,\nthe printing jobs, the...the military there, what...what we used...uh...I don't know...uniforms,\nguns, and so on, they were kept somewhere else. And meetings were always in...never in the\nConsulates of course. They were in these private places.",
        "Q: Did you meet other people connected with Wallenberg?",
        "Q: Only my own kind because many people did one thing or another for...for the...for the cause.\nThere was a Dr. _ who worked very closely with...he was one of the Rabbis in Budapest at\nthe time. Very closely, Dr. ___ and _ others and...and my kind who either went in because\nthey really were excellently qualified to do the administration or they came in on a basis like\nmyself.

        "Q: Can you describe to us...take us through one of those courier runs, from the time when you\nwent in to pick up the Schutzpass to when you dropped it.",
        "A: Now, I was at the time, of course, not in my house because I was never in the ghetto. In one\nof the...one of the houses, you mentioned before the name...",
        "Q: Protected house?",
        "A: Protected houses and ____ the protection, the little Nazi, Hungarian Nazi, came in and\ncommanded everyone down. And whoever he wanted, he took and said, \"They'll be back.\nThey'll be back.\u201d He took them. They never came back. So this was the story. Uh...So I got\ndressed and tried very carefully to leave the protected house so that no one would see me and\nI got, let's say, to a...to a Consulate, a Swedish Consulate which was in Buda and there...I got\nthere. I never remember to have to wait because all the officials, all the workers there were\ntold not to delay, not to delay. First of all, in some cases the Schutzpasses were respected,\nyou know, and if...uh...a call came by any Nazi, they show them the Schutzpass, he respected\nit in case...1n some cases, or rather in many cases. Now, I got there. Of course, I had to walk\nbecause at the time there was no more...uh...uh...street car or any...any communication,\nanything. So I walked to the place. I tried very hard no one shall see me when I leave the\nConsulate. Uh...Sometimes I succeeded, sometimes no. Sometimes, I met...uh...people\nwho...who were Nazis and we had a discussion like, \"Aw, those terrible Jews, what they did\nhere,\" and because I spoke the language fluently in many cases, this helped me. And I tried\nto get back as soon as I delivered what I have to deliver to get back to the protected house.\nAnd I waited until I got a...the next command to go either to free Jews from the...uh...from\nthe Tolance house which is the the last stop before they are shot in the Danube or..or do\nsomething else, whatever I was told.",
        "Q: Will you know take us through one of those trips where you freed Jews from the Tolance\nhouse and tell us what that scene was like.",
        "A: The scene was 10 or 12 Jews, strong, young people.",
        "Q: Excuse me. Repeat...repeat questions so the camera knows where you are.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: You were asked where were you?",
        "A: In Budapest. And...uh...they...our administration knew very well who they have, and people\nwho they could count on. In other words, they were really not broken down old people or\n..or young people who can't move. They were people who were strength and energy and\nthey...they knew if they will be dressed up as gendarmes, they will be gendarmes. They will\nact as gendarmes. Uh...",
        "Q: The Tolence house now.",
        "A: Yes. Now, so when we got the command, let's say to go free these people in the Tolence\nhouse we got dressed and got together at a certain spot, wherever we were told. On a street\ncorner because we...we weren't Jews. You know, we were...we were...uh...Christians\nand...uh...we got together wherever we told and from there under the direction of the one\nwho was assigned to be the...the officer, the commander of this group and who was dressed\nup as a...a lieutenant or something like that, he...we went in marched form up the place\nwhere we had to do the job. And when we got there, the man took the paper and showed it\nto...to whoever it was in charge there and told him we will take these damn Jews and do the\nright thing with them. Don't worry Comrade. Just give them to us. So...uh...1f there were 20\nor 50 or...or whatever amount of people, we took them and while we...and as soon as we got\nout of the...of the Tolence house which was, of course, protected by all kinds of gates and\nwhat not, as soon as we felt that we can tell the people, we marched close by to them, \"Don't\nworry. This is...this is Just a play. You will be saved. We take you to this and this place, and\nwe came here. We are Jews and we will...we will ...we won't kill you. You...we take you\nwhere you should be.\u201d And so the people quieted down and they...they came with us and\nmarched with us, and we took them wherever they...we were told to take this. This 1s...this\nwas the scene. Uh... You have to know that in those days the streets of Budapest were\ncompletely empty. There was very little ...uh...uh...cars, very few cars. Anyhow, but\nthere...there was no...no...n0 communication. People didn't walk on the street. They simply\nwere scared, let along... mean like cars or something like that. You very very rarely that you\nsaw that at the time. First of all, most of the vehicles were taken by the...by the military, and\nsecond of all, who dared to go to the street? I mean there was bombing going on and...and\nwhat not, so they were just scared. Uh...Jews, of course, didn't dare to go out, and other\npeople were scared too. So we could...uh...we could very well do our stick, whatever we had\nto do there.",
        "Q: What other kinds of things did you do with the underground? This was with the Zionist\nunderground?",
        "A: Yeah. With the Zionist underground. What other things? I stayed in...uh...we had to be...we\nhad to bring...and we had to bring in paper and we had to...any kind of thing, whatever there\nwas to be done. There was no such a thing like...we didn't have any water in the last times\nalready because the water was cut off. So I stayed with a...with a dish and waited until I got\nenough water to bring it up to make a tea or..or boil it to some soup with...with something in\nit or...or bring it to an old person, an elderly person or a sick person. Give them a drink of\nwater. That was one of the jobs we had to do. And it wasn't only myself. Many\npeople...uh...did the same thing. We went down to the cellar where a little bit of pressure was\nstill on, and gathered the water from the pipes which were 1n the cellar and so we took it up\nto the 4th, 5th floor for...to be used for...for whatever it is needed. And that went for...for\nbread and for cheese and for...for...for whatever we could put our hands on. Now, I had to go\nout and let's say bring back some bread. So I knew where the bakeries are for I live in\nBudapest. And...uh...so I went there, and if I got some bread I had a...uh...coat, a white coat. I\nput my...I put...I'll never forget that...that was a specialty...have a bag, put my hand into the\nsuits there. It's in my pocket, but actually I was holding the bread underneath my coat, and I\nwalked home. Now, you know, the...this kind of terrible, terrible experience teaches people\nto do many, many things which you never thought you are able to do.",
        "Q: The...the winter of 44, I gather, was very cold. Will you tell me about it?",
        "A: Terribly cold. Terribly cold. The main thing I can tell you 1s...then I have to flash back\nto...uh...uh...Novi Sad. It was 28 below celsius, 1s...that would be about 50 something like\nthat. And while we were, let's say, in ...uh...in...11 Budapest during 44 and so, we were very\nyoung and we could stand it. And then we had very good training in Russia and with the\nUkraine where we were in labor camp to get used to these things. Sometimes, the snow was\na meter or meter and half tall or high, and people slept on...1n the snow.",
        "Q: They slept in the snow\u2019?",

        "Q: In that winter of 44...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: 44, early 45, who were your friends in the underground that were doing the same things you\nwere?",
        "A: As I told you, there was this Haskowich, who was one of my best friends. He was a brother\nof a colleague of mine. And ...uh...he...he gave me the first information about my family. Of\ncourse, I tried to get to Kosner. I had difficulties to get in. He was an extremely busy person,\nbut finally I got to him and found out that my family is still not in Switzerland. They are still\nin...uh...1n Bergen-Belsen. Uh...During this...uh...1944, after January...I don't remember,\nprobably the 18th of January, when Russian soldier appeared in the cellar of that house\nwhere we were, we knew that every minute, every hour is danger. Nothing else. When this\nRussian soldier arrived, we thought we are freed, but it wasn't like that. The Russians just\ndidn't...didn't just redeem us. They brought all kinds of problems. I...you probably know\nabout that. Uh...There's a story in that. And there were cases where soldiers carried 15 and 18\nwatches and put them on their arm, and____ is a very well know phrase known to\neverybody. \"Give the...Give the...Give me your watch.\u201d It was a hard, hard, hard life,\nbut...uh...when it came we tried to get back to our own homes, and I went back to my home\nafter...after a certain while. I didn't leave Hungary until 1946.",
        "Q: Let's stop a minute. You gave...when the Russians came in, you eventually got back to your\napartment. What about your family?",
        "A: My family was still not there. My wife never, never wanted to get back to Hungary. She was\nso hurt in her...in her personality, in her humanness so to say, that she never wanted to step\non the ground of Hungary anymore. I remember when we took our first trip to...uh...Israel,\nwe had to...she still had...at the time, she had an aunt who she liked very much in Budapest.\nAnd we had to wait a day and a half in Vienna for the airplane for...for the plane.",
        "Q: Excuse me. I'm confused. I...I need some order here. You are in Budapest. You find out\nabout your family.",
        "A: Family. I write to them. I write to them. I try to get...uh...get them to phone. There was no\nphone, of course. One letter after another. Finally, I got a letter from my wife saying she does\nnot want to come back to Budapest where I have magnificent...uh...prospects in Budapest\nbecause (clearing throat) I kept my position. Though our, my Temple, was used as the\nghetto...uh... the...uh...actually, they had no...1n that vicinity where...where the ghetto was,\noriginally, they had no hospitals. So they organized a ghetto hospital so to say in my Temple.\nAnd..uh...this place...I don't have to tell you how it was by the time the Russians came in. All\ndirt and all smut and all...all this. So I organized (clearing throat - drinking water) and as I\nhave said, we were freed, liberated about the 18th of January or sometime in that...that\nperiod of time and...uh...my birthday is on the 3rd of March. And while we were in labor\ncamp, I always tried to keep our people warm and together. Speak to them, tell them things. I\nmean bring a little bit of...uh...__, of humanity. And...uh...they remembered that, my\ncomrades, and...uh...said...what...bread for instance was impossible to get and other things,\nand they asked me what would I want for...for birthday present. So I told them (cough) about\n10, 15 people. You know what I want. You become for a day or two or three again a laborer.\nCome here with a pick and shovel and let's clean up the ___ Temple. So\nthe...the...the...uh...back yard and the yard and the front was cleaned at least to the degree\nthat you could walk. It wasn't all...all dirt and...uh...I organized the rebuilding committee, and\nrebuilt the Temple, the part of the part of the Temple which was ruined. This was what I did\nafter the...after the liberation. Between the...so that on the High Holy Days, we already went\nback to the Temple as a Temple and had services in the Temple, though there wasn't a seat\nleft or so. But temporarily it was...it was fixed.",
        "Q: Tell us about finding your family. The time is short.",
        "A: Now finding the family was this. As I wrote from time to time and didn't get answers, finally\nI got an answer. This letter that I told you about before. I knew...finally, I had to realize in\nspite of the wonderful prospects I have in Budapest where I could keep my position. I could\nbecome the Secretary General of the Jewish Chaplaincy Service in Budapest because Dr.\nHeroshi was the Chief Chaplain and he begged me to...to be his assistant. I cannot wait or I\ncannot hope my family should ever come...come back. So... uh...my first...uh...my\nlast...uh...cable or was it a letter, I don't remember...reached already my family in Bari, Italy,\non the way to Israel. So that my wife who was a teacher by profession went to Israel. She\nhad a very dear friend, her classmate from first grade, who was a lawyer in Israel, very\nrespected lawyer. And when they spoke about what she should do...is to go to a kibbutz or\ntake courses and...uh...become a teacher in Israel. She knew Hebrew quite well. Uh... The\ndecision finally was made, \"No, she should go to a kibbutz with the children. So, they went\nto Sharharmikim, where she became a worker, a laborer there first, and later on she became\nthe main..uh...the chief...uh...the chief cook of the kibbutz and I must tell you her food\nwas...what she cooked was extraordinary. And this is the way then finally I took 3 months of\nabsence, of vacation to find my family. I knew where they are, and I knew I will never come\nback to Budapest and I started out to Budapest. Maybe here's another interesting point.\nWhen I started out and the congregation this time already, the ____ gave me permission\nfor 3 months to...to for a leave of 3 months. The organization which took care of people to\nget them back to their homes made...and many, many people waned to go to Israel. At the\ntime it was the...the pressure was great for people to get to Israel. So...and from Hungary,\nyou couldn't just go to Israel. You had to have special permission.",
        "Q: Excuse me. We...we need...we have very little time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So if you could just tell us about coming to Israel and finding your family.",
        "A: This is exactly what I wanted to tell you. Uh...So I went...80 people. The story about them\nwas that they were so badly beaten up by the Germans that they lost their hearing and they\nwere all...they were not able to talk. So I was there commander and so we went through\nYugoslavia, through...uh...through Zaga and other places to Italy. There were all kinds of\nthings. In Zaga, we had a man who kept up this finger and had a...something...uh... piece of\nmaterial on it, and we had just to follow him for the one night we spent there. Then we got\nto...to...uh... to Italy and the final thing was that we got to preparatory to boarding the boat to\nIsrael. We got to a place called Statsia, a little fishing village in Italy. There the English\nmade the Italian government, the Italian forces to arrest us and we spent in Statsia about 9\nweeks or 10 weeks. It was about Pesach time. I performed Seder services there I remember.\nFinally, Morrison, who was the Secretary of Labor in the English government and a Jew,\ncame down to us and tried... Yeah...we...we...to convince us we shouldn't have a hunger strike\nand we shouldn't do this and that, and I wrote especially hymn for the Holy Pesach there\nand...uh..and that c'est l'appell was everyday and everyone came out and we had a hunger\nstrike for 98 hours. Then he came and convinced us we should stop the strike, the...the\nhunger strike, and really we did stop and we got permits to go to Israel. So that to Israel, I\narrived legally as a legal immigrant. And there...uh...my wife was waiting for me, but we\ndidn't meet at the boat. Why not? Because I was appointed to be the commander of that boat\nwhere , and the commander is not allowed to leave the boat until everybody and\neverything what...what they brought is taken off the boat. And I had...I had to wait. And my\nwife was the kibbutz ___. He brought her, and he said, \"Look, it's ridiculous. Why shall we\nwait. _ probably didn't arrive.\u201d I didn't arrive and I did arrive and went down the boat, left\nthe boat and there was a taxi driver. I had one English pound in my pocket and I told him,\n\"Look, I have this and this 1s all I have. I'll give you this. Take me to Sharharmiking where\nmy family is and my wife is.\u201d So he said, \"Put it away. I will take you to Sharharmiking for\nnothing.\u201d And so I traveled for the first time to Sharharmiking, where I asked for...for my\nwife's Hebrew name is ___.. I thought she's 1n Israel. Probably she took the ____ name\nback. So they told me, \"We have no ____..\u201d\u201d Who do you have? We have Ella Mandel. She\nkept her regular name. So finally, we met and I don't have to tell you what that...what that\nmeant to all of us. She lived in a little hut there, but it wasn't too bad.",
        "Q: We need to cut this. Could you just tell us when you came to the United States. You and Ella\nstayed in Israel how long?",

That's the Jewish school.\nAnd I think when I was four, maybe 4 and a half years old, I read Hebrew very well. I, of\ncourse, didn't understand, but I knew how to read Hebrew very well. And I went on through\nthat Cheder and in that Cheder where we started first to learn prayers. Later on we extended\nto other things, like the Bible and so on. And...uh...this occupied our lives. We went to\nCheder in the morning about 6:30, stayed there, had a service in the Cheder proper, a daily\nservice, and at 8 o'clock, we had to go to the public school.

And...uh....in the\nafternoon, the same thing happened. After we had lunch, we went back to the regular school\nand...uh...at 4:00 when we were dismissed, we went back to Cheder until about 6:00 or 6:30.\nAnd this 1s...this was their current day by day, day after day.",

And I\ndid that. And I had a very pleasant voice and that's all I knew, but there was no possibility to\nstudy music as much. I...I couldn't do that at all.",
        "A: I... was...I lived in my little community up to the age of my Bar Mitzvah. After Bar\nMitzvah, I left...uh...my village, and I went to study in a place. It was close by, about 15\nkilometers from our village. And I studied in Notchulus. That was the Capitol city of our\nState. I come from a State which was called Ugochar.

That was\nall musical...uh...preparation I could have.",
        "A: Now, I stayed in Nocholus for 2 years. And there I...we were not allowed to go to regular\npublic schools. We had to prepare our studies privately and take exams at end of the season,\nat end of the year in the public schools from or given by teachers who were public school\nteachers. And I finished there Junior High in Nocholus. I studied in Yeshiva, and studied\nprivately for the exams in the Junior...Junior High School. I stayed in Nocholus up until\n19...1918, and from there because the Rabbi in a certain big place, big congregation, big city,\nUmegra was a former schoolmate of my father and they studied together.

        "A: Hiruia is the written...uh...document to be qualified as a Rabbi in _____, and from Umera, I\nstudied there up to the point where I was drafted into the Czech army. Now, in Umgra I don't\nhave to tell you it was an extremely...uh... religious community as well, and for instance, we,\n__ Bikurim who studied under this Rabbi who I told you about before, were told that when\nwe walk by the Reform Temple at a certain street we cannot...we shouldn't walk on the side\nof the temple. We have to cross the street and walk by to the next block and only then go\nback to that side of the street. This...from this can give you...uh...picture the way we lived.\nNow, one thing, however, was very good. The...uh...discipline, not only this which may\nsound here in America funny and foolish, but the discipline in every way was so immense,\nit's hard even to describe it. Everyone stuck to...to the...to the rules of...of Yeshiva, whatever\nit was. The best (clearing throat) (drinking water) (pause) To give you an idea how strict the\ndiscipline followed or...or prevailed there, I have to tell you a very little story. I had a nice\nvoice, and when I was already about 15 or 16 years old, somehow the cantor of that\ncommunity, of that congregation, which was strictly 100 percent an orthodox congregation,\nand their cantor was a man by the name Gottleb, who heard my voice and wanted me to join\nhis choir. My father, who was a _____ friend, former schoolmate of the Rabbi under whom I\nstudied, came especially to Umgra to speak to this Rabbi and ask him could I, would I,\nwould he allow me to sing in that choir. The Rabbi did not give me permission or whatever.\nHe used to go to that shul.",
        "A: So I did not have the opportunity to study music even to the degree what this choir that sang\nin the Orthodox shul would have given me. And so I grew up without any musical\nbackground. However, I was a very good ___, which means I could lead any service and\nso on. The voice was nice and here I come again to a...to a story...uh...in Umgra. Again, my\nfriends who came together with me to Umgra from my previous Yeshiva knew that I have a\nnice voice and there was one Friday, a Rosh Hodesh. I'm sure you know what Rosh Hodesh\nIS.",
        "A: It is the first day of the month where in the olden days, of course, sacrifices used to be\nintroduced in a...in the Holy Temple, and now we observe this beginning of the month by\nhaving special services. We have included Hallel and Musaf service and so on. Now the\nYeshiva in Umgra had a so-called ____ where the Bikurim, the students of the Yeshiva,\ncould get food. And they did. And people, very religious people from a neighboring village\ncalled or ___ in Yiddish used to deliver the milk for the Yeshiva it should\nbe...uh...100 percent kosher. And so...uh...uh...one day at______s~ where my classmates and\nother Bikurim forced me in...1n...1n to perform the service, the Musaf service. One man who\nbrought milk in the big can walked by and heard me. And he asked one of the Bikurim who\nis the ____ who 1s governing there. So he says he's not a ___.. He's just a one of us, ___.\nAnd the man then waited for me until I was finished and spoke to me. Because this was very\nclose to Umgra they would come and pick me up. Would I perform a service of Shavuot in\ntheir congregation...in his congregation. (Clearing Throat Pause) We went out there. Yeah.\nHe also said I can invite as many friends as I want and they won't come back empty handed.\nSo I performed the service, got paid...uh...in this ___ and my friends were loaded up with\nall kind of goodies. Butter and cheese and...and eggs and what not. So everyone was very\nhappy. Later on, this went from mouth to mouth and I was invited to different towns for little\ncongregations, bigger congregations. I became a star. And ]_____ and this maintained myself\nfinancially plus my two brothers who came to study in the same Yeshiva later.",
        "A: Now, after the Yeshiva...let me go back for a moment yet to the...to the Yeshiva. My\nfather...before the brother was the youngest, David, brought up my...my youngest brother in\nshort...in shorts to...to be introduced to the Rabbi and asked if he could join also. The three of\nus were already studying there, so maybe David could study too. And the Rabbi took a lot at\nhim with the short pants and said, \"No.\u201d He told my ....my father gave this Rabbi...uh...a lot\nof ...uh...uh...honor. They used to be on first name term as young people. He called him\nRebbe and he called my father Avrom. So he said to my father, \"Avrom, I don't have a\nCheder. I have a big Yeshiva.\u201d So my father told him. I ask of you one thing. Listen to this\nyoung boy with the___, the short pants. He knows the pages of Talmud by heart\nalmost. The Rabbi gave him an exam and told my father, \"You know what. Your fourth boy,\nDavid. Buy him long pants. He can study in Yeshiva.\u201d Now you asked me when did I get my\nfirst professional...uh...engagement let's say. (Pause - drinking water) Actually, I got my first\nprofessional engagement when I was drafted into the Czech army. We finished the semester\nin Yeshiva. And I had to report to the...uh...military on the Ist of October. However, it came\nout that the beginning of October were the High Holy Days. So I traveled and finally I got\nthe position ina place _______\u2014\u2014_. And there I done the whole service. There was an\northodox congregation where I did the main service, the Musaf and so on. And ____ in the\nOrgan Temple in____ uh...the _____ and other things.

        "A: I mean the...1t wasn't Reform as in...no. In Hungary, there were...there were differences.\nThere was the Orthodox, the Nelro. Nelro_ didn't mean reform.

Some even had...had mixed choirs and there was the status quo when the\ntwo...namely, this is history, when orthodox departed from the Nelro congregations, there\nwere some who didn't go on either side, but remained where they were status quo. No\nchange.",
        "A: I served in the Czech army and maybe it's a very interesting thing too. And indicative of my\nlife and the way I...the way we were disciplined and the way we lived. At..uh...the basic\ntraining which everyone had to follow...follow through, I think at the beginning of\nNovember when the birthday of the President of Czechoslovakia, at the time, Masaryk,\nwhich was President, was celebrated. Uh...First Lieutenant came out to the training grounds\nand asked if is there...1f there 1s someone who has a nice voice and could sing the Yanick\npartinthe_ ds I never in my life up to the 20th birthday was in a movie or knew\nwhat opera is or knew what a note 1s or knew what music ...musical training is, but my\nfriends who were from the same Yeshiva and in the same...uh...group...uh...told me, \"Why\ndon't you tell them. Why don't you go? You...you have a nice voice.\u201d So finally one of them\ntold him that this young man has a nice voice. And...uh...he said, \"What he wants? Do I\nknow what opera 1s? Could I learn it?\" I said, \"No, I have no idea what you are talking\nabout.\u201d So he gave me an order on a certain hour to see him 1n his office. He was the\nsuperintendent for...uh...entertainment for the...uh... military. The Czech army stressed very\nmuch learning of any kind. There were many, many people who came into the army and\ndidn't know how to read and write. So the army taught them. And finally, he gave me an\norder to be in this hour, in a certain hour in his...uh...office. I went there. Uh...He asked me\ndo I know this? Do I know? \"No, I know nothing.\u201d So the end was that he asked me to sing\nsomething, anything I want. So I sang a Hungarian song. And...uh...he liked it, and after that\nmaybe for weeks and weeks, he taught me phrase by phrase, note by note the melody what to\nsing, how to sing. At the time, I didn't even speak Czech yet. So that was another question.\nHowever, I learned everything. And you know, at the time I was young and...and the\nbrain...uh...uh...was good so I...and the ear was good. I learned it. He said, \"I will be along\nside of you at this performance. I will tell you and push you in when you have to go in and\ndo and sing this and that. And I will motion to you when you have to come out.\u201d And this is\nthe way the...uh..._._~\u2014~\u2014S\u2014\u2014s went over. You can imagine what a great performance\n(laughing) it was...it was, but that's...that's the way it was.",
        "A: In 1926, April. I had a plan because I was influenced by a brother of my latest teachers,\nLitest Smiller, who told me that I have a beautiful voice, but it...it is not worth too much. I...I\ndon't know how to...I don't know any music. So I want...I thought.... Yeah. One more thing\nabout this...uh...First Lieutenant. This First Lieutenant went to the point, because he liked my\nvoice and so on, and was a very decent person and said, \"You have a beautiful voice. I will\napply to the Division.\u201d That's...uh...[ don't know how many...uh...to the Division of...of I\ndon't know what part of the military. \"We have scholarships. I will try to get you a\nscholarship where you will be able to study for 4 years in the Academy and prepare yourself\nfor...for...uh... operatic career.\u201d I was flabbergasted and I didn't know how to handle it, and I\ndidn't dare even to tell my parents, namely my father, that this kind of a happiness and great\ncareer was standing before me. However, I had an uncle, my brother...my mother's brother\nwho was a lawyer, who studied in Budapest and came down, was a lawyer later on in our\nvicinity. Was about 40 miles...40 kilometers from our village. I wrote to him. I didn't dare to\napproach my father directly. So he went over and told my father about this big luck,\ntremendous thing what...what I'm confronted with. And my father's answer was,\n\"Moshe,\"...that was his...my uncle's name....\"\"We have four sons and three daughters. If\n... that's my Yiddish name...will do that he will go to the ____ and _ desecrate the\nSabbath, and desecrate the High...the Holy Days and sing in this career,\" which in my...in his\nown opinion wasn't...uh...the way a Yid should lead his life, \"then please tell me that we have\nonly three sons and three girls.\u201d That's a cruel thing, but 1t ended my operatic career, so when\nI came home... My father wanted, of course...I was already 20...1n my 2Ist year, I should get\nmarried and settle there in a beautiful store, very rich people, and the only thing I would have\nto do is count the money and be in the...and so on. Uh...So I didn't want this. I wanted still to\ngo privately and study music. And my father didn't give in on the other hand, so the deal\nbetween us was made. No Academy of music. No marriage. But back to Yeshiva. And then I\nwent back to Yeshiva to Pressberg where I studied for about...uh...2 years and that was my\nlast Yeshiva, and there I got my second _____ which 1s....you know what a ___ 1s?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: He wouldn't have like it. He wouldn't have like it. Uh... Maybe he wouldn't have minded my\nknowledge of the music, but he surely would have minded that I'm leaving Yeshiva and go\nto there to study. Now in Pressberg there were many smaller congregations, synagogues and\nthey knew that I knew how to ____.. They invited me. And this is what I made a living for\nmyself from, and this is what gave me the opportunity financially to travel to Vienna and\ntake some lessons. So there it started. One Saturday, when] ____ after the ___, a man\ncame over to me and told me he is from Vienna. He works in Vienna. He's originally from\nPressburg, works in Vienna at _____ and is a member of a congregation called\nTemple. \u2014\u2014\u2014s and their ___, a young man just left and he thinks I will be the proper\nperson for them. Why don't I apply? So the next time when I went to...uh... Vienna, I applied.\nThey invited me for a Shavuot ...uh...to perform the services. I performed the services and I\nwas elected to be their cantor, and was with them for about 3 years, something like that.\nAfter this, there was a___ written out for...uh..the _____\u2014 looked for a cantor for its 21st\n. That's a district.",
        "A: The _________is not as strict as the Budapest ____ because there the",
        "A: Taxes. The taxes were not collected by the...by the state if the person, let's say a Jew didn't\npay to the Jewish community. However, it was extremely well organized and the...the\n___s central congre...central congregation let's say had its offices and its\nadministration. They...uh...they...uh...the nations and the...were always coming in well, and\nthey never had any financial troubles. There the only thing was...was similar to...to the\nHungarian setup was that they also had synagogues for each district, led and controlled by\nthe Central Congregation. Now when I applied for this...uh...congrega...for this position at\nthe ,",
        "A: This is in Vienna. When I applied, there was to my luck, a person by the name Gross, Mr.\nGross, who every year for the needs of his business traveled to the Leipzig international\nmarket. And on his way home to...back to Novi Sad, where he lived, by special permission\nhe listened to the applicants which...uh...were quite a few. I think a hundred, over a hundred\napplied, and 16 people were given permission ___. In order words, a check...checkup\non the person who eventually will get permission to perform a service. And I was one of\nthem, and this Mr. Gross like me, and went home and because they didn't have a cantor\n_, ...the chief cantor left them....their chief cantor left them a year and a half ago or so. He\nwent home, give a report and ...uh...I was invited to give a...a...uh..a__- SS a trial\nperformance in Novi Sad.",
        "A: No. This is already in Novi Sad from...from Vienna. You see this man, this Mr. Gross was\nfrom Novi Sad. And...uh...1 came down, gave the so-called Proba, the trial service and I was\nelected. Few...few days later I got a phone call I'm elected. On the 28th of April 1928, I came\ndown as the elected chief cantor of the congregation in Yugoslavia in the town of Novi Sad.\nI lived there and married there...uh...for...I married...I lived there for 6 years. I had a\n...uh...lifetime agreement given to me by that congregation the third or fourth year. And if\nyou are interested, I will tell you what happened from there.",
        "A: Yeah. In Novi Sad I had a magnificent position. There was one congregation. No small\nshuls. No side temples. No nothing. One congregation with 800 Jewish families, an organ, a\nmagnificent choir of 40, a choir leader, an organist. In other words, the service was\norganized better than any one or as good as anyone could imagine. As I say, I served there\nfor 6 years. Between the 5th and 6th year, I get a letter from a man by the name Mr. __ from\nall places in Kovno, from Kovno. He writes to me and says, namely in the 30s. This was\naround the 30s. I started to give concerts of Jewish content, of synagogue contents, let's say,\nin the state radio in Belgrade. And I used to give these concerts and he heard me and\nsaid...he wrote in Yiddish that he liked what he heard and he would like to know if I would\nbe willing to come down to that part of the world, Kovno and so on, to give a few concerts.\nMoney is no problem, and in order to make sure that I understand it money is no problem, he\nwill have in a few days write to me and suggest to me by an official office concert bureau,\nand this bureau, which is a recognized concert arranger and organizer, will write to me and I\nshould be in contact with them, tell them what I want, and he is backing it, and money is no\nproblem. I shouldn't forget that. So when I started to prepare for this road from south...he\nwas from Yugoslavia, which was south, ....uh...to the cold vicinity of Kovno, Russia...former\nRussia, my own family asked me, \"Are you crazy? You have the most magnificent position\nhere. Everyone likes you. You have no problem. You make three times as much money as\nyou can spend. Even your wife is...1is engaged by the State.\u201d She was a school teacher.\n\"Where are you running? What are you trying to accomplish? What are you trying to do?\"\nHowever, as a young man...let's not forget, in 1933 I was still only a very young, very, very\nyoung man. And I was interested what's on the other side. So I went. And I sanged two\nSaturdays. I performed services in Kovno, in the so-called ____. That's a big time temple\nthere. And...uh...I sang twice for the benefit of Yeshivas,____ Yeshiva. And all under his\nguidance. This man...this Mr. __ was a millionaire, very rich person, and he had part of\nhis...of his mansions, so to say, advice given to me so that I can study and sing and learn and\ndo whatever I want and he made sure that one of his...uh...uh...carriages...uh... Of course, it\nwas a catriage and horse wagon will take me whenever I have to go to rehearsal, whenever I\nhave to go for a...for a choir practice and so on. And I was there for about 2 weeks.\nSuddenly, and everything was beautiful, very good. So suddenly, one Shavuot he introduces\nme to a man by the name Mr. Becker. Mr. Becker was the President of the ___ in Riga.\nAnd Mr. Becker told me, \"They are seeking the services of a Hazan for 2 years already.\n_ was their cantor before I came there, and they would like very much if I could come over\nfor...to give a audition in the ___. I went and performed services and it was left\nto...rather they had 82 people for... uh...to audition, and they...they were left with three. One\nwas their former cantor, ___, who was a great opera singer in his time, and the second\nwas aman by the name _____ who was...came from...uh...from Yohannesburg, and\nmyself. In Riga, it developed to be a great...uh...a great affair let's say. There were the\n___,andthe_____\u2014, and the_____. However, there was a great ___, the so-called\n____ with whom I became very friendly. And...uh...when these people just couldn't get to\nfirst base and many people wanted me and this...uh...the end was____\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_ told them, \"If\nyou want, you'll take Mandel. If you want opera singer, you take ____ and so\non.\u201d So finally, I was elected in the _____\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014, and we went there. And we lived in Riga\nfor 3 years. As a matter of fact, Manny was born in Riga.",
        "A: This is a very good question. I will answer it to you. My answer to my own people who\ncriticize me that I'm leaving Novi Sad was this Mr. Becker took me, showed me Riga. First\nof all, he got a magnificent city. Not that there's anything wrong with Novi Sad, but Riga\nwas a magnificent city. A tremendously, culturally developed...high culture in every way\nyou can mention. There was a steady opera. There were Jewishly spoken. Mr. Becker took\nme not only to Yeshivas, but he took me to day schools where the teaching went on from\nkindergarten on up to university. Everything was taught in Hebrew. And these schools were\nrecognized as regular schools and you could go to any university with a diploma from that\nschool, from those schools. And I said to myself and with my wife, \"Look, 1f we will ever\nhave a child, let me him go to this kind of a school because there is Yiddish ___ and\n_, Jewish...Jewishness and humanism bound together as I have rarely seen it anywhere else.\nAnd this was one of the reasons we went to Riga. In Riga, we acquired many, many\nfriends...many, many admirers. However, when...uh...the call came from Budapest that they\nneed a Hazan in___ Temple, I thought this 1s still the highest point any cantor can...can\nlook for or wait for, namely Riga itself as beautiful congregation as it was, it wasn't an\norganized congregation, let's say like Budapest you know where law ruled the congregation,\nwhere church and...uh...and faith was...was divided. So after long, long, long speculation and\nconsideration, we...we decide we both were born in Hungary, spoke Hungarian very well,\nand...uh...and we decided to leave Riga. Now, how I came to Budapest is the story...",
        "A: Now, I came to Budapest, and I put it this way. I came to Budapest in 1936. I was elected\nand I did not go back to Riga anymore because I was concerned if I go back, I won't be able\nto...to leave there. Because people and I have many, many friends and admirers and so I\nstayed in Riga...1n Budapest, with the excuse that I will start now to rehearse for the High\nHoly Days. In Budapest, there were two main temples. One was the traditional where I\nserved, the ______ Temple, and the other was the ______- Temple. The ____ was bigger,\nhad close to 5,000. Still stands. That's the only synagogue which was...remained so-to-say in\nexistence, in comparatively good shape. And in our...in other words, the Dohine Temple had\nan organ, had a mixed choir, men and women, and...uh...very fine choir leader. The\nwas a traditional temple. In our temple, there were 40 in the choir, men and children, soprano\nand___ were sung by children. Now...uh...I started as I said in 1936 and was in Budapest\nthe chief cantor of the ____ Temple for 10 years. You have also to know that the Budapest,\nthe Pest ___ because at the time it wasn't Budapest __ yet. It was Pest. And the Pest\n__ community had synagogues according to need in every district. If two were needed, there\nwere two synagogues. But chief cantors and chief Rabbis were only in the ____ and\nTemple. So the Dohime Temple had two chief cantors, and the ___ Temple had two chief\ncantors. In the Dohime, there was ______\u2014 and in the _____ was Bornstein and Mandel.\nUh...In these congregations, you asked me before if there were many people. There were so\nmany people, the ____ Temple had about..uh...3,000 seats. So many people that because it\nwas a narrow street, police had to be brought in every time when we had services in order\nthat when the people leave the synagogue they shouldn't kill each other. And this I think is a\nvery interesting thing, and I want to include it in this discussion here. We were down as I\nhave already said, we...I served in..uh...Budapest 10 years, from 1936 to 46. In 41, I think it\nwas...",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: The first...",
        "A: The first and second...uh...Jewish law against the Jews rather. You know what that means.\nJewish law. That meant Jews couldn't hold any positions at government. Jews couldn't later\non have even their own business. Uh...Non-Jews couldn't have been seen by Jewish doctors.\nJews couldn't serve as physicians 1n...1n hospital or even have their own office. This was\nin...started in 1938 and continued in 1939 and went on to the point when...uh...the German\nthen occupied Hungary finally. But as far as...uh...the beginning 1s concerned, it was...when I\ncame to Budapest, I was given working papers, so-called working papers, permission to\nwork as a non-Hungarian citizen in Hungary for...I got permission for 4 years. In other\nwords, I should have been in good order up until 1940. But as soon as...after the first High\nHoly Days. That means before 1937 already, the French policei. The ones who controlled the\npeople who...who are not citizen butt in and they made sure that we will be asked to leave\nHungary or arrest us. So that danger was tremendously big and that was the time when I\nthink in 1938 or the beginning of 39, I went to London to try out there. And I was elected.\nHowever, I came back to Budapest because 3 days after this...uh...Saturday when I\nperformed services, the President of that congregation, I should have been\nelected to be the cantor of the Dukes Place Synagogue. But this wasn't to be because the\nnight after we...we had a meeting with the Board, I got a telegram from Budapest sent to me\nby Secretary General saying your case is in good order again. We expect you home lovingly.\nSo, being that my family was already settled in Budapest and so on, I didn't ask for expenses.\nI didn't ask anything. I ran like crazy and went back and...uh...went back to Budapest. It\nseems It's all fate because I could have...I could have just signed the agreement and stayed in\nLondon, but no, it wasn't to be. So I came back to Budapest. Now, during these terrible\nyears, 38, I was...the first time I was called into labor camp was in 38 or the beginning in 39\nbecause the big trouble really continued, which started as a said before that the doctors\ncouldn't be doctors. The lawyers could be lawyers. The professionals couldn't be\nprofessionals anymore. It expanded to the point where me, at the time, yet younger Jews\nwere called into labor camp and I was one of them. I was called in and...uh...I served for the\nfirst time in...not too far from Budapest, in a place Shirastopeck, meaning nothing. We built\nairports. I'm asking you for what. I don't think an airplane ever... ever appeared there. But we\ndid. Just to...to make it hard on us. And this went on almost to the very end. The first two\nyears I would say 38, 39 and maybe the beginning of 40. Yeah. I was still within the border\nof Hungary. I was called in many, many times, but not over...not sent over the border. Later\non...uh...toward the end of the...of the war, we were in Galicea. We were in Poland. We were\nin former Russia up to the Dunn River we went, and that's the way they ___ us and gave\nus difficulties. They finally...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The thing I would like to do is (coughing) is to pause here and change tapes and then we go\nback. I want to know more about the labor camp. Okay.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: It was terrible and worse yet in other families, but as far as I and we were concerned, I was\nstill employed by the congregation. I got my monthly check and we could make a living.\nHowever, my mother remained at the time still in that village where I was born. My father\nhas died already, so I brought her up to...to Budapest and she lived for a very short while in\nour house and later on, she lived...my brother became a student at the Rabbinical Seminary at\nthe University because that was...uh...the Seminary student had to finish college as well.\nThey had to get a degree from the university. So in order to save him from labor camp when\nhe came up, I made sure that he is...he will be there as a student of the Rabbinical...of the\nRabbinical...the Rabbinical...uh...seminary. It was no problem because he had a tremendous\namount of Hebrew knowledge. And...uh...in...uh...1939, 40, even the beginning of 41, if we\nwanted to get something good, it had to be sent to us from Novi Sad. For instance, we...we\nneeded some meat for Passover, so my in-laws sent with a cert....by a certain man, who was\nthe superintendent of our buildings in Novi Sad, they sent up...I don't know...geese and\nwhatever we needed. Uh...Jews...later after the second law again the Jews couldn't go out to\nthe store at any time during the day and buy anything. They had a certain hour or two...I\ndon't remember exactly...during the day when they could go out. And of course when\nthey...when they could go out everything was gone. It was a very, very hard life with a lot of\nthings missing. We were very lucky because my in-laws who lived in Yugo...in Yugo...again\nthat was formerly Yugoslavia was Hungary again. They helped us out with many things.\nNow, as far as within the family, everything was fine because we had the...the benefit of the\nbig congregation and everyone knew...uh...who we are and didn't bother us too much.\nHowever, when it came to...uh...being a Jew it didn't make any difference when the...when it\nwas handled by the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazis. And so...",
        "A: It means that when the hack and cross, the...the Hungarian Nazis, you know, came because\nthey were members of...of their...their organization, and they wanted you to show them\nwhere you are born and then you have the right to be here and you are a Hungarian citizen.\nEven if you were a Hungarian citizen, it didn't mean a thing because the laws\ncovered...covered already everything what could destroy Jewish life or Jews in general.\nNow, when a family cannot go out and cannot live their own lives for...for...this 1s against\nthe law, that's a terrible, terrible thing. I did one more thing in Budapest which I probably\nhave never mentioned, but I will mention it now. This Mr. Epler, who was the Secretary\nGeneral of the congregation, after the first Jewish law, after the first law against the\nJew....when that was passed, he asked me if I could help out in the congregation and\norganize a district in the 7th district, which didn't exist before. People were taken up or rather\nthrown out from their own homes and they were moved together with other people, so there\nwas a big problem. One family was kosher, kosher; the other wasn't. One family had old\npeople; the other had the young people and children. But they were moved together in\napartments, and other apartments were taken away because there were some districts where\nthe Jews couldn't live at all, and these Jews had to be placed where this was still a possibility\nfor them to live. Now, I organized the 7th inner district at the time, and made sure that we\nknow who is a Jew, who is not a Jew, who keeps a kosher home; who doesn't; and so and so\nthat they forced getting together of these families in one apartment instead of three or four\nwas let's say a little bit easier done than it could have been done if this information wouldn't\nhave been available. And I was the secretary of that 6th...7th district for quite awhile\n(drinking water) so that we had a complete listing of the Jews who lived around us, about...\nYeah, and this, of course, was already done and allowed to be done by the Germans and the\nHungarian Nazis because this was preparatory to the ghetto so that the Jews would be\ntogether already. And this was done. Now what is your next question?",
        "A: As the years progressed, 1940... Yeah, all the time, starting from 1938, either I was home for\n4 weeks and then called back to the labor camp and was there for 2 months let's say. And I\nhad the congregation force their way through their influences that I was allowed again to\ncome home for let's say the month of the...of the High Holy Days or any holiday or Pesach or\nShuef. So I came home and I stayed home for...for the time I was allowed to stay home...to\nstay home. And the winter months as a rule were taken more easy than the summer months.\nSummer months we almost constantly were in camp and for the winter months, sometimes\nwe were allowed to...uh...g0 home and we lived there. Now what happened for instance, I\ncan tell you one interesting thing about 1941 if we have time. In 1941, my sister-in-law who\nlived in Novi Sad, came for a visit to Budapest. And at the time our son, Emmy...Manny,\nwas a very small child. He was born in 1936, and this sister-in-law, who loved him with all\nher heart, she told my wife, her sister, \"Look, the child has a cold. He's coughing and all that.\nNovi Sad is still about a 100 kilometer south. I will take him down. Maybe his cough with\nsubside easier there.\u201d So we went with her and...uh...I made arrangements because there\nwere two chief cantors in___ Temple that my colleague who was with me will take\nover all my duties for Sunday. There were many, many weddings and all kinds of things. He\nwill take over, and I will take over for him the next time when it's his next. So we went down\nto Novi Sad on Thursday and stayed with this sister-in-law in her apartment and Friday\nmorning before...at dawn, my father-in-law, who lived close by, came over to his daughter,\nto us, to tell her, tell us, inform us that there is a pogrom outside and the Jews and ____ are\npicked up and congregated somewhere. So it was a terrible thing. That was a Friday.\nWe...we waited in the house. About II:00 the gendarme with full glairy, fixed up with his\nmachine gun and all that came to take us to a certain spot where the Jews were con...were\ngathered, and from there they were marched down to the Danube. We didn't know that this\nwill happen, but this 1s what it was. The Jew...the ____ and the Jews were down...were taken\ndown to the Danube River. The Danube River was frozen maybe...I don't know how many\ninches thick, but they...they threw some...uh...material, some military bomb or something\ninto the water, probed the....uh...the thing open...ice, the ice open and took the people into a\nplace where they had to undress and naked to go on the trampoline which was over the\nDanube River, and they were shot into the River. They were shot and fell into the River.\nNow, this went on for a long time. We saw trucks arriving there with ___ and Jewish\npeople and they were all put into a line. I think a line of two and there was always a\ngendarme or a policeman who was told and informed by the government that all these people\nwho are being...who are being taken here are being taken here because they are the enemies\nof Hungary. The really...the newly occu...back occupied Hungary because you know that\nwas Yugoslavia. It was Hungary, then Yugoslavia, then the Hungarians occupied it again. So\nwhen our next came, before us was standing the owner of the house...uh... where my sister-\nin-law lived. When our next came, the policeman came over. I was holding Manny in my\ncoat, in my fur coat because he...he had fever, and...uh...he took a look at me and\nsaid...uh...\"\"What are you doing here? Chief Cantor, what are you doing here? You are not a\nCzechnik?\" Czechnik meant the...the people who hated Hungary. The serp people and\nothers who hated Hungary. You are no Czechnik. And he was all terribly excited, and ran\nover to the Lieutenant who was there was in charge and told him, \"The...the Chief Cantor\nfrom the ____ is here. He's...he's not a cheknik. He's... know him, and I 'm there many\ntimes.\" Namely, as I told you before, the _____ Temple was a very narrow street and\nbecause people were pouring out and would have been in danger, endangered each other, so\nhe was...he and other 10 people were there and he was in charge of that group of policeman.\nSo he knew me very well. And this while he was running back and forth, and at the third or\nfourth try, the lieutenant told him, \"Put him aside. Stand him...let him stand aside.\u201d This\nsaved our lives because Hortee (pause - drinking water) Hortee then called off the killing,\nand this is when it stopped at our ____. So 1f anyone will tell me this story, I wouldn't\nbelieve it, but it's true.",
        "A: The scene was...the scene was 29 degrees celsius. People were crying, and when we heard\ntut, tut, tut, tut, another few shots, we...we knew what's happening. We imagined what's\nhappening. And people were crying and hollering and...and throwing themselves to the floor,\nto the ground and as...as...as...as can well be imagined what happened. But before we should\nhave gone in and be the next ones to be killed, the killing stopped. From there, we were\ntaken into a...into a gymnasium...uh...walked back and...uh...when we spoke about where we\nare going and...and what happened, the...uh....one of the policeman was walking along side\nwith us told me, \"You are very lucky people. I don't know if you know what's happened\ninside the they called it. It was a bathing stop at the Danube in Novi Sad all the time,\nand then it became the killing spot. So he said, \"You are very lucky people. You don't\nknow....do you know what happened inside?\" And...uh...he told us the story. It was Friday\nafternoon when we arrived to this gymnasium where we were held...uh...for a couple of\nhours and told that now we are clear...we are in the clear. Everything is fine because it was\nproved that we are not chekniks. And then we went home to our apartment and, of course, as\nyou...we didn't stay. Saturday evening we went home, back to Budapest. In Budapest, it\nwas...this kind of thing at the time did not happen yet. 41. It happened many times after that\nin 42 and 43 when groups of 50 and...and maybe hundred were gathered and were taken to\nthe Danube River by 10 or 12 and shot into the River. This happened. Later on, this became\na daily occurrence in 43 and...uh...and 44.",
        "A: The roundups I did see because even from the place where I stayed... My family wasn't with\nme at the time. They were in Bergen-Belsen at the time because...uh...there was... uh...an\neffort to save some people, and there were sixteen hundred and some people...Jews who\nwere transported from Budapest to...uh...through...through different stops, but finally they\ngot to Bergen Belsen. This was a Catholic group if you know about it.",
        "A: Now, my family became part of...of this Bergen Belsen, the Kosner group as they called\nit...uh...because my brother and I were very active in Zionistic work and the people knew\nthat so whoever was in charge of this Kosner group they said...though I wasn't home at the\ntime... was probably in the Ukrainian at the time already...they said, \"Though ____ (that's\nmy Hungarian name) isn't home, we cannot forget...uh...Ella and...and their...their son,\nEmmy, and they...they were engaged and my brother-in-law's still there as a Rabbinical\nstudent he was not taken into...into labor camp. So he was extremely active. He probably had\nsomething to do with it to...to bring it to the attention of the people.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Labor camps. And my family was...was in Budapest. So they were taken with the Kosner\ngroup. First it was that they go straight to Israel, then it was said the...as I hear now from\npeople who were part of the group...uh...they were...they were supposed to go to Auschwitz\nand finally, they made up to go to Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A: I did not find out...uh...until I didn't come back...until I didn't escape in...uh... November, the\nend of November. In____, I left the company, __ company, and we walked mainly\nnighttimes...uh...",
        "A: Yeah. Go ahead.",
        "A: Now, you have to understand what happened.",
        "A: As the Germans got...got...as...the Russians performed their attacks against the Germans\npushing them from east to west, so the labor camp people...the labor camp laborers, Jews,\nwere always pushed together with them. Why? Because the Germans and even the\nHungarians had a tremendous amount of food and other necessities in different places and\nwe had to hurry up and load the wagons and...and trains for them that their material should\nbe taken...uh...westwards instead of being taken by the Russians. So we moved always with\nthis ...with this attack. (Cough) And finally, when we got to ShotroyRehe, I heard that....at\nShotroyRehe, there is an organization (coughing - drinking water) which takes the Jews in\nthe direction of Vienna they told us at the time and whoever cannot walk is shot. So I spoke\nto a few people who I could reach and told them I am doing this. If you want to come with\nme, maybe a great risk but this 1s what I will do. And that must have been the beginning of\nNovember. When we were already pushed back to the point of...uh...my birthday's let's\nSay...OF...0F",
        "A: November of 1944. And so we left the company and tried to get in the direction of Budapest\nand it took about 10 or 12 or 14 days until we accomplished our goal to get to Budapest.",
        "A: The...the getting away from the camp was simply take a risk every second of the...of that\ntime to be shot by a Hungarian Nazi. Not necessarily a...a man, but a 12, 13 year old boy\nwho had a gun and if he shot a Jew, they probably gave him a thank you. Not...uh....he\ndidn't...he wasn't exposed to any punishment or anything of that. And this is the way we got\naway. We just slipped away, left everything what we had, and had the same clothes and the\nsame shoes, maybe sometimes without soles, but we...we went in the direction of Budapest\nbecause we thought there is the revenge. I remember walking through a town\nimmediately...uh...the...at the border of Budapest where there were Hungarian papers who\nsaid THE FALL OF BUDAPEST IS EXPECTED ANY HOUR. THE RUSSIANS ARE\nHERE AND THERE IN THIS AND THIS SPOT. And when I came to Budapest the ghetto,\nof course was...I...we...we didn't know that there was a ghetto in Budapest. The ghetto was\nalready working. The Jews were already concentrated in the ghetto. As I heard later, the\nGermans have prepared to...uh...to put some bombs tn the ghetto and...and to kill all the Jews\nwho are there, but this didn't happen and when J arrived in...uh... Budapest the 17th of\nNovember, I took my life.... I knew already that my family is in Rome.",
        "A: Because my...the place where we lived was part of the ghetto, and a friend of mine who lived\nin one of the so-called...uh...houses which were...which were not... which were except...an\nexception and not ghetto...how did they call them?",
        "A: Protective house. Uh...He told me that my family went with this and group to the Kosner\ngroup and he doesn't know where they are now, but they are not home. Ella and the child and\nanother...uh...relative's child of ours went with my brother and my wife to...with...with the\nKosner group.",
        "A: My reaction was...first, I will...I will...I'll start at the first reaction which I got when I arrived\nand I took my life into my life into my hand because you couldn't walk into the ghetto and\nwalk out of the ghetto. So we were about...I was about 2 blocks let's say from the place\nwhere our apartment was and I at one...one early morning, as I have said, took my life into\nmy hands and through all kinds of machinations, I got to the place where our apartment...the\nhouse where our apartment was. Our apartment was on the top floor, magnificent apartment,\nwith Persian rugs and pictures and this and that. And every piece of furniture in that\napartment was done by the...by the ___ meister, you know. And when I came in through\nthe bombings and so on, snow...this was the top apartment. Snow was falling in...uh ...very\nfreely on the rugs. And the...the where we had our dishes, let's say, which Rosenthal dishes,\nthere were pieces on the floor because a bomb hit it. And..uh...I was told\nthat...that...uh...uh...80...80 some people are living in our apartment. At the time when I came\ninto the apartment, it was not locked and I could in...could get in to the apartment, and I saw\nthere is no roof. There is no...nothing. Now, this was the first impression. The family isn't\nthere. This is the picture I found, so if I didn't get a heart attack there, right then and there, it\nis Just by...by the grace of God. From there, I went back to this friend who told me about my\nfamily with the Kosner, __ Kosner_ group and we started to speculate, \"What can I do?\" So\nI, at the time I was quite young yet and my face was full and I looked like a real peasant so\nthe idea was by the people who led this rescue mission there, that the best thing for me\nwould be to pose as a non-Jew who was on the front and came home now...uh...because\nof...uh...he got hurt and was in the hospital. And of course, I got papers for all this because\nthe...our...our machinery worked perfectly to make any kind of false papers. And I got those\npapers. I was called a runner. What was the runner? Uh...The Schutzpass business started.\nWas already on at the time when I came home, when I arrived home in\n1944...uh...November, December, so the... the request to me was made. I should be a runner\nfor that commission about whom no one knew, at least we thought so, and they will give me\npapers as a Goy who was...who was injured on the frontline and came home and now I'm\nhere on...uh...rehabilitation and spend the time in Budapest. The assignment really was to go\nto the...the...uh... Swedish man, Raul...uh...",
        "A: Wallenberg. To the Wallenberg offices, get the Schutzpasses, be told where they have to be\ntaken because they were in contact, and I as a Hungarian soldier can walk on the street\nfreely...uh...I...1t wasn't so, but...but that's the way it was planned and I should take these\nSchutzpasses to the different spots where they are needed. This was my work after I came\nback from...from labor camp let's say. Many times I did something else. People were by the\nhundreds maybe thousands gathered in the concentration prison. There was such a thing in\nPest, and there they were not only mishandled and so on, but many, many terrible things\nhappened to them. Once we were told that in the Tolence house, that's the place from where\nthey are thrown over the border, there...I don't know how many people...and we...the people\nwho were assigned for this mission, dressed up in Hungarian gendarme uniforms and went to\nthe place where they were gathered. This is in this case the Tolance house prison. And we\ncursed them and we said the worse things about the Jews and so, but we took I don't know\nmaybe 50 or 60 Jews, and we had machine guns and ____ and we...we ...we got them out.\nThe ________\u2014 got them out by false papers, of course, that we will take care of them. We are\nHungarian gendarme , and we will take care of them. We'll...we'll... ___. And so they were\ngiven to us and we marched them back to different spots, different places.\nThese...uh...houses which were...uh...saved I'd say or posted as non-___ as non ___. And\nthis is...this 1s...between these two occupations, there didn't remain too much time\ntoo...uh...you know.",
        "A: Yes, I met him many times. But I... never had a chance to sit down with him for 5 minutes\nbecause as...even if he was in the office when I came there and there was not one of us...he\nwas in different places.",
        "A: Raoul Wallenberg. Yes. He was there and he saw me and secretaries and so on knew who I\nam and they told him. And he said...he spoke German there. He said, \"Give him...Give him\nwhatever he has to get fast. Let him go because every minute 1s a loss.\u201d And they...they used\nto give me the papers, these Schutzpasses, big pieces of paper. They looked beautiful\nfalsifications. And I used to ___, so I...his...there I had an interview with some people\nfrom...from one of the Scandinavian universities whom I don't remember anymore. Time\nago. And...uh...he asked me, \"Tell me the most important thing you can...you can think about\nwhen you think of Wallenberg.\u201d So I told him, \"You know what it is. My sadness that I\nnever had a chance to sit down with this angelic person to...to talk to him for 5 minutes.",
        "A: Yes. There...there...there were offices, official offices where only the Consulate or close by.\nThey occupied another room or something. They did the best they could. There wasn't you\ngo out and rent an apartment or rent an office. They did it the best they could. The official\nbusiness was always handled from the Consulate itself. The non-officials, the falsifications,\nthe printing jobs, the...the military there, what...what we used...uh...I don't know...uniforms,\nguns, and so on, they were kept somewhere else. And meetings were always in...never in the\nConsulates of course. They were in these private places.",
        "A: Now, I was at the time, of course, not in my house because I was never in the ghetto. In one\nof the...one of the houses, you mentioned before the name...",
        "A: Protected houses and ____ the protection, the little Nazi, Hungarian Nazi, came in and\ncommanded everyone down. And whoever he wanted, he took and said, \"They'll be back.\nThey'll be back.\u201d He took them. They never came back. So this was the story. Uh...So I got\ndressed and tried very carefully to leave the protected house so that no one would see me and\nI got, let's say, to a...to a Consulate, a Swedish Consulate which was in Buda and there...I got\nthere. I never remember to have to wait because all the officials, all the workers there were\ntold not to delay, not to delay. First of all, in some cases the Schutzpasses were respected,\nyou know, and if...uh...a call came by any Nazi, they show them the Schutzpass, he respected\nit in case...1n some cases, or rather in many cases. Now, I got there. Of course, I had to walk\nbecause at the time there was no more...uh...uh...street car or any...any communication,\nanything. So I walked to the place. I tried very hard no one shall see me when I leave the\nConsulate. Uh...Sometimes I succeeded, sometimes no. Sometimes, I met...uh...people\nwho...who were Nazis and we had a discussion like, \"Aw, those terrible Jews, what they did\nhere,\" and because I spoke the language fluently in many cases, this helped me. And I tried\nto get back as soon as I delivered what I have to deliver to get back to the protected house.\nAnd I waited until I got a...the next command to go either to free Jews from the...uh...from\nthe Tolance house which is the the last stop before they are shot in the Danube or..or do\nsomething else, whatever I was told.",
        "A: The scene was 10 or 12 Jews, strong, young people.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: In Budapest. And...uh...they...our administration knew very well who they have, and people\nwho they could count on. In other words, they were really not broken down old people or\n..or young people who can't move. They were people who were strength and energy and\nthey...they knew if they will be dressed up as gendarmes, they will be gendarmes. They will\nact as gendarmes. Uh...",
        "A: Yes. Now, so when we got the command, let's say to go free these people in the Tolence\nhouse we got dressed and got together at a certain spot, wherever we were told. On a street\ncorner because we...we weren't Jews. You know, we were...we were...uh...Christians\nand...uh...we got together wherever we told and from there under the direction of the one\nwho was assigned to be the...the officer, the commander of this group and who was dressed\nup as a...a lieutenant or something like that, he...we went in marched form up the place\nwhere we had to do the job. And when we got there, the man took the paper and showed it\nto...to whoever it was in charge there and told him we will take these damn Jews and do the\nright thing with them. Don't worry Comrade. Just give them to us. So...uh...1f there were 20\nor 50 or...or whatever amount of people, we took them and while we...and as soon as we got\nout of the...of the Tolence house which was, of course, protected by all kinds of gates and\nwhat not, as soon as we felt that we can tell the people, we marched close by to them, \"Don't\nworry. This is...this is Just a play. You will be saved. We take you to this and this place, and\nwe came here. We are Jews and we will...we will ...we won't kill you. You...we take you\nwhere you should be.\u201d And so the people quieted down and they...they came with us and\nmarched with us, and we took them wherever they...we were told to take this. This 1s...this\nwas the scene. Uh... You have to know that in those days the streets of Budapest were\ncompletely empty. There was very little ...uh...uh...cars, very few cars. Anyhow, but\nthere...there was no...no...n0 communication. People didn't walk on the street. They simply\nwere scared, let along... mean like cars or something like that. You very very rarely that you\nsaw that at the time. First of all, most of the vehicles were taken by the...by the military, and\nsecond of all, who dared to go to the street? I mean there was bombing going on and...and\nwhat not, so they were just scared. Uh...Jews, of course, didn't dare to go out, and other\npeople were scared too. So we could...uh...we could very well do our stick, whatever we had\nto do there.",
        "A: Yeah. With the Zionist underground. What other things? I stayed in...uh...we had to be...we\nhad to bring...and we had to bring in paper and we had to...any kind of thing, whatever there\nwas to be done. There was no such a thing like...we didn't have any water in the last times\nalready because the water was cut off. So I stayed with a...with a dish and waited until I got\nenough water to bring it up to make a tea or..or boil it to some soup with...with something in\nit or...or bring it to an old person, an elderly person or a sick person. Give them a drink of\nwater. That was one of the jobs we had to do. And it wasn't only myself. Many\npeople...uh...did the same thing. We went down to the cellar where a little bit of pressure was\nstill on, and gathered the water from the pipes which were 1n the cellar and so we took it up\nto the 4th, 5th floor for...to be used for...for whatever it is needed. And that went for...for\nbread and for cheese and for...for...for whatever we could put our hands on. Now, I had to go\nout and let's say bring back some bread. So I knew where the bakeries are for I live in\nBudapest. And...uh...so I went there, and if I got some bread I had a...uh...coat, a white coat. I\nput my...I put...I'll never forget that...that was a specialty...have a bag, put my hand into the\nsuits there. It's in my pocket, but actually I was holding the bread underneath my coat, and I\nwalked home. Now, you know, the...this kind of terrible, terrible experience teaches people\nto do many, many things which you never thought you are able to do.",
        "A: Terribly cold. Terribly cold. The main thing I can tell you 1s...then I have to flash back\nto...uh...uh...Novi Sad. It was 28 below celsius, 1s...that would be about 50 something like\nthat. And while we were, let's say, in ...uh...in...11 Budapest during 44 and so, we were very\nyoung and we could stand it. And then we had very good training in Russia and with the\nUkraine where we were in labor camp to get used to these things. Sometimes, the snow was\na meter or meter and half tall or high, and people slept on...1n the snow.",
        "A: In the snow. Yes. Put on their coat. Crawled into the...1n the snow and the snow kept them\nwarm. Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: As I told you, there was this Haskowich, who was one of my best friends. He was a brother\nof a colleague of mine. And ...uh...he...he gave me the first information about my family. Of\ncourse, I tried to get to Kosner. I had difficulties to get in. He was an extremely busy person,\nbut finally I got to him and found out that my family is still not in Switzerland. They are still\nin...uh...1n Bergen-Belsen. Uh...During this...uh...1944, after January...I don't remember,\nprobably the 18th of January, when Russian soldier appeared in the cellar of that house\nwhere we were, we knew that every minute, every hour is danger. Nothing else. When this\nRussian soldier arrived, we thought we are freed, but it wasn't like that. The Russians just\ndidn't...didn't just redeem us. They brought all kinds of problems. I...you probably know\nabout that. Uh...There's a story in that. And there were cases where soldiers carried 15 and 18\nwatches and put them on their arm, and____ is a very well know phrase known to\neverybody. \"Give the...Give the...Give me your watch.\u201d It was a hard, hard, hard life,\nbut...uh...when it came we tried to get back to our own homes, and I went back to my home\nafter...after a certain while. I didn't leave Hungary until 1946.",
        "A: My family was still not there. My wife never, never wanted to get back to Hungary. She was\nso hurt in her...in her personality, in her humanness so to say, that she never wanted to step\non the ground of Hungary anymore. I remember when we took our first trip to...uh...Israel,\nwe had to...she still had...at the time, she had an aunt who she liked very much in Budapest.\nAnd we had to wait a day and a half in Vienna for the airplane for...for the plane.",
        "A: Family. I write to them. I write to them. I try to get...uh...get them to phone. There was no\nphone, of course. One letter after another. Finally, I got a letter from my wife saying she does\nnot want to come back to Budapest where I have magnificent...uh...prospects in Budapest\nbecause (clearing throat) I kept my position. Though our, my Temple, was used as the\nghetto...uh... the...uh...actually, they had no...1n that vicinity where...where the ghetto was,\noriginally, they had no hospitals. So they organized a ghetto hospital so to say in my Temple.\nAnd..uh...this place...I don't have to tell you how it was by the time the Russians came in. All\ndirt and all smut and all...all this. So I organized (clearing throat - drinking water) and as I\nhave said, we were freed, liberated about the 18th of January or sometime in that...that\nperiod of time and...uh...my birthday is on the 3rd of March. And while we were in labor\ncamp, I always tried to keep our people warm and together. Speak to them, tell them things. I\nmean bring a little bit of...uh...__, of humanity. And...uh...they remembered that, my\ncomrades, and...uh...said...what...bread for instance was impossible to get and other things,\nand they asked me what would I want for...for birthday present. So I told them (cough) about\n10, 15 people. You know what I want. You become for a day or two or three again a laborer.\nCome here with a pick and shovel and let's clean up the ___ Temple. So\nthe...the...the...uh...back yard and the yard and the front was cleaned at least to the degree\nthat you could walk. It wasn't all...all dirt and...uh...I organized the rebuilding committee, and\nrebuilt the Temple, the part of the part of the Temple which was ruined. This was what I did\nafter the...after the liberation. Between the...so that on the High Holy Days, we already went\nback to the Temple as a Temple and had services in the Temple, though there wasn't a seat\nleft or so. But temporarily it was...it was fixed.",
        "A: Now finding the family was this. As I wrote from time to time and didn't get answers, finally\nI got an answer. This letter that I told you about before. I knew...finally, I had to realize in\nspite of the wonderful prospects I have in Budapest where I could keep my position. I could\nbecome the Secretary General of the Jewish Chaplaincy Service in Budapest because Dr.\nHeroshi was the Chief Chaplain and he begged me to...to be his assistant. I cannot wait or I\ncannot hope my family should ever come...come back. So... uh...my first...uh...my\nlast...uh...cable or was it a letter, I don't remember...reached already my family in Bari, Italy,\non the way to Israel. So that my wife who was a teacher by profession went to Israel. She\nhad a very dear friend, her classmate from first grade, who was a lawyer in Israel, very\nrespected lawyer. And when they spoke about what she should do...is to go to a kibbutz or\ntake courses and...uh...become a teacher in Israel. She knew Hebrew quite well. Uh... The\ndecision finally was made, \"No, she should go to a kibbutz with the children. So, they went\nto Sharharmikim, where she became a worker, a laborer there first, and later on she became\nthe main..uh...the chief...uh...the chief cook of the kibbutz and I must tell you her food\nwas...what she cooked was extraordinary. And this is the way then finally I took 3 months of\nabsence, of vacation to find my family. I knew where they are, and I knew I will never come\nback to Budapest and I started out to Budapest. Maybe here's another interesting point.\nWhen I started out and the congregation this time already, the ____ gave me permission\nfor 3 months to...to for a leave of 3 months. The organization which took care of people to\nget them back to their homes made...and many, many people waned to go to Israel. At the\ntime it was the...the pressure was great for people to get to Israel. So...and from Hungary,\nyou couldn't just go to Israel. You had to have special permission.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: This is exactly what I wanted to tell you. Uh...So I went...80 people. The story about them\nwas that they were so badly beaten up by the Germans that they lost their hearing and they\nwere all...they were not able to talk. So I was there commander and so we went through\nYugoslavia, through...uh...through Zaga and other places to Italy. There were all kinds of\nthings. In Zaga, we had a man who kept up this finger and had a...something...uh... piece of\nmaterial on it, and we had just to follow him for the one night we spent there. Then we got\nto...to...uh... to Italy and the final thing was that we got to preparatory to boarding the boat to\nIsrael. We got to a place called Statsia, a little fishing village in Italy. There the English\nmade the Italian government, the Italian forces to arrest us and we spent in Statsia about 9\nweeks or 10 weeks. It was about Pesach time. I performed Seder services there I remember.\nFinally, Morrison, who was the Secretary of Labor in the English government and a Jew,\ncame down to us and tried... Yeah...we...we...to convince us we shouldn't have a hunger strike\nand we shouldn't do this and that, and I wrote especially hymn for the Holy Pesach there\nand...uh..and that c'est l'appell was everyday and everyone came out and we had a hunger\nstrike for 98 hours. Then he came and convinced us we should stop the strike, the...the\nhunger strike, and really we did stop and we got permits to go to Israel. So that to Israel, I\narrived legally as a legal immigrant. And there...uh...my wife was waiting for me, but we\ndidn't meet at the boat. Why not? Because I was appointed to be the commander of that boat\nwhere , and the commander is not allowed to leave the boat until everybody and\neverything what...what they brought is taken off the boat. And I had...I had to wait. And my\nwife was the kibbutz ___. He brought her, and he said, \"Look, it's ridiculous. Why shall we\nwait. _ probably didn't arrive.\u201d I didn't arrive and I did arrive and went down the boat, left\nthe boat and there was a taxi driver. I had one English pound in my pocket and I told him,\n\"Look, I have this and this 1s all I have. I'll give you this. Take me to Sharharmiking where\nmy family is and my wife is.\u201d So he said, \"Put it away. I will take you to Sharharmiking for\nnothing.\u201d And so I traveled for the first time to Sharharmiking, where I asked for...for my\nwife's Hebrew name is ___.. I thought she's 1n Israel. Probably she took the ____ name\nback. So they told me, \"We have no ____..\u201d\u201d Who do you have? We have Ella Mandel. She\nkept her regular name. So finally, we met and I don't have to tell you what that...what that\nmeant to all of us. She lived in a little hut there, but it wasn't too bad.",
        "A: We stayed in Israel...I stayed for 19 months. Ella stayed for a longer time, probably 3, 4\nyears.",
        "A: I came to the United States in 1948, March, and my family...is it 1940.....yes, I think it was\n1948, March. Yeah.",
        "A: About a year later, a few months and a year later.",
        "A: You are more than welcome. If I added something worthwhile, it's my pleasure.\n"
