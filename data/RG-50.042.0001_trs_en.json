        "Q: Let's talk about the start of the war and some of the things that you remember from that time.",
        "A: [remember it very vividly. As you well know, war broke out on, on the first of September uh,\nuh Germany said that they declared war. Of course, there was no declaration, they simply marched\nacross the border, and we lived very close from the Czechoslovakian border, Czechoslovakia\nalready having been occupied by Germany. But um, I uh, I remember it um, now, actually I was\nterribly busy, you know, first of all, my father had suffered a heart attack just a few weeks earlier,\nand was a great deal of uh concern and turmoil and all that, and this was our prime concern, and\nanother of course, um, school was going to start in another week or so, so you know I was getting\nready for school and talking to my friends, and um, n-not really truly being aware of uh, of what\nmight be happening, and that was the last week of August or so. Um, we really came face to face\nwith it on Friday morning, very early in the morning when people said to--there were lots of planes,\nwe, we heard a row of, of many planes, and um, when we went out to the street to see it, uh, the\nwings of the planes had the swastika on it, and that was the first ominous thing of sort of\nhelplessness and, and uh oh you know, this was above us, they could do almost anything, and uh,\nthat-----------------broke out. People started um, digging holes in the, in the yards and erecting uh\nbarricades, and my father was um, was upstairs in in the bedroom, and my mother cautioned\neveryone not to mention the war to him, and uh, didn't let him listen to the radio or anything, but I\nguess my father knew, obviously, what was going on. And uh, and it was a horrible night, uh,\nthere were lots of explosions and I remember being in my parents' bedroom with my, my mother\nand my brother and I, and this is when my uh father told me to go and call the family, and I\nremember...",
        "Q: We better stop.",
        "A: Am I talking too long?",
        "A: ---------------just started.\nBeep.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's continue with the beginning of the war. Why don't we do the Saturday, the quiet\nSaturday.",
        "A: Saturday was, was very, very quiet. As a matter of fact, I remember it just um, it still is one of\nthe most beautiful and probably the last peaceful day of my life. You realize I was only 15 at the\ntime, and um, I remember in the morning, we wanted to turn on the radio and there was no sound.\nThe electricity had been cut off, there was not telephone. Um, my father got up, he had been so ill\nbefore and was the first time I saw him dressed again. He suddenly looked very grey and very old,\nand when I look back now, I realize that he was only 4, 49 I guess. And, uh, I remember we were\nsitting at breakfast, was a beautiful, beautiful autumn day, very bright, very golden, flowers were\nbright outside, and we were all together, and it seems all activity outside has, has stopped as well,\nand um, it um, it was sort of a very, very special memorable day because it had no, no intrusion\nwhatsoever, and uh, and we were together, and uh, then in the evening, great deal of activity\nstarted. There was shooting, there were planes, uh there was some explosions. We went to the\nbasement. My cat was outside, and my brother went out to let the cat in, the cat was meowing, and\nhe came back with a hole in his trousers, and he said there was shooting from the rooftops, and the\nGermans were coming. I don't remember too much more of that night, but I remember in the\nmorning we came out from the basement, and we sat around the table, and my brother walked\ntowards the window, and, and then he sort of sat down, and at that moment, we had an incredible\nroar, and a motorcycle came down the street, and it had a -------- behind it, and there were people in\ndifferent uniforms, you know, our army, the Polish army had sort of uh beige, khaki uniforms, and\nthose uniforms were green. No, I'm sorry, um, actually what happened, we saw people walking\nwith flowers and cameras.",
        "Q: Wait, we have to stop, there's a noise.",
        "A: Yeah, I jumped ahead.",
        "Q: Wait for the noise.\nBeep.",
        "A: Okay, let's pick up with seeing the people with flowers.",
        "Q: Saw people with flowers and cameras, walking up the street. You know, our street was called\nShishinska, which means uh, like uh, Czechoslovakia, which was the street which led to the Czech\nborder, and people were walking up that street, and my mother said something like, \"Oh my God, I\nhope they are not...,\" and at this point that motorcycle came down the street, was an incredible roar,\ncame down the street, and was two German military in them, and uh, the thing which I remember\nmost vividly, my brother had his wristwatch in his pocket, and he was just removing it from his\npocket, and so, his hand must have trembled because his watch fell to the floor, and I remember\nseeing, it, it was 9:10 in the morning, and I was sort of thinking that something that, that was the\nmoment when, when our world was gone.",
        "A: Tell me about the woman who wanted your Polish ---------.",
        "Q: Uh, well, we um, we realized that things were uh, what, what was most astonishing thing 1s that\nuh, we heard roars of uh people, our neighbors, and friends and people I've known all my life, you\nknow. My mother was born in the same home I was born, and you know, it's been in the family I\ndon't know for how many generations, and, uh, uh people were shouting you know, \"Heil Hitler!\nLong live the Fuehrer,\" and, and, and, and people were waving flags with Swastikas and uh, there\nwas a feeling of complete betrayal, sud-suddenly you were home and, and you were not home\nanymore. You know, I mean, uh it was Poland you know, and we, we love Poland it was uh, uh at\nleast a young generation, you know because the older generation had grown up, up under Austria,\nbut of course, we were born under Poland, and uh, this is something I couldn't understand and, and\nprobably uh the most, the most vivid example of that was that my friend Trudy, who uh had a ve-a\nvery bitter life and her mother had died, and she had a stepfather, her mother married a, a that man\nwent through, there was very little, he was terribly cruel to her, and he was beating her, and she\nspent so much time with us, was a, a, you know, and I, I really felt oh so close to her, and I saw her\ngoing to our garden and picking white roses. My mother was particularly proud of them because\nthey had bloomed out of season and, and she was handing it to a sold--to a German soldier, you\nknow, and people were bringing, and, and, and I think that gesture always sticks in my mind as, as\none of complete betrayal, and also I remember her handing the roses to the soldier who is reaching\nout to her, and at that moment, someone else was handing him a glass of Schnapps, or what, you\nknow, it was some sort of whiskey, and he let the roses fall to, to, to, to the ground and people were\ntrampling on my roses, and um, uh, I don't know tt, it's sort of like 1t became a symbol for me, that\nvery moment, it's arrested in my mind that uh, what, what was happening there, that everything was\nsort of upside down, and um...I don't know.",
        "A: Tell me about the neighbor who wanted -----------.",
        "Q: Then there was a woman, you know people, how people try to be helpful, I, I don't mean to uh,\nuh to say that um, that 1t was a direct betrayal of us, at that particular point it was not, but of...",
        "A: Stop.",
        "Q: Four is up.",
        "A: Beep.",
        "Q: Of course we, we had some very good and very close friends among our neighbors, and uh, one\nwoman, her name was uh Frau Resher, I remember, she came in, and she asked where the Polish\nFlag was. The Polish flag, of course, is uh, a strip of white and a strip of red, very long strips, and\nmy mother said, \"Why?\" And she said, it's really very easy to make a German flag out of it, you\nknow, all you have to do is um cut out around um thing of the from the white and then pose it on\nthe, on the red, and then with a ribbon, make the swastika, you know, I, and my mother absolutely\nturned pale, and the woman said, \"We we better make that flag and fly from the house, you know,\nobviously she wanted to protect us because uh, the houses which did not fly uh the swastika flag uh\nwere under scrutiny, and uh, they figured that they were you know, anti-German, and they\ndiscovered that we were Jewish so uh, she just took the flag, my mother looked for it in all places\nwhere she knew she couldn't find it, but finally she did produce it and uh, and she did make, my\nmother did not, but the neighbor and another one made the flag, and uh, and it was sort of\nunbelievable to see uh that flag flying from my childhood home. I remember I thought of it like a\nspider, you know the swastika sort of reaching out to, to engulf us, and uh, was a horrible thing,\nsomething that was supposed to be for our protection was actually terribly ------------- particularly,\nyou know, to a young girl, and it all came so fast, it was all, within a day.",
        "A: Okay. Now we do have to reload.",
        "Q: Change film, going to Camera roll 2; Sync take 5 is up.\nBeep.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The war started in September. By, by Christmas we had to move to the basement of our home.\nIt was very cold and clammy. We, we had no, no running water, no electricity, and uh, things were\nreally quite bad, but we were still in our own home. Uh, and spring was very difficult because I\nalways loved my garden. I used to spend a lot of time there as a child, and the sign appeared there,\nthat dogs and Jews were not permitted to enter. Um, when we had orders to move to uh, Shabby??\na remote corner of our town, which became the ghetto, uh, I defied that order. I remember I, I said,\n\"I don't care what they're going to do.\" I had to see my garden again. Was a beautiful, fragrant\nspring morning, was in April, and uh, I remember I jumped over the fence, and went to the garden,\nand pretended that uh, that I was just, I was picking violets, and I pretended just for a little bit, what\nit would be like if uh, if the war hadn't happened, if I would be going in, my mother would say I, I\nneed to take my raincoat to school, and my brother would be hurrying off, my father would be\ngoing to his office, my mother would be setting the table for breakfast, and urging us to -----------,\nand uh, I remember it was sort of the most incredible thing that um, uh the reality which I had\nalways taken for granted, now became uh the most remote fantasy. I then, I think it stayed with me\nyou know, in a way, throughout all the years to, to return to that. Later, of course, it took on other\nforms of um, when I was in the camps, to imagining evening at home, but here I still was looking at\nmy childhood home, home, my parents were inside, my brother had been taken away, um, maybe\nsix weeks after the war started, he was taken away October 19th, and the war broke out the first of\nSeptember, but I was with my parents at home, I could, I could see from the garden, the room\nwhich had been mine, the wallpaper, um, even though we lived in the basement, I was still there,\nand, and yet um, I somehow must have been at least subconsciously aware that maybe I'm never\ncome back, so I'd never recognize it, you know, I, I lived throughout with this thing, I'm going to\ngo home, always, but uh, when I look back now over, over the many years, uh, and I, I still can\nvery vividly recall my feeling, it, uh, 1t was sort of a farewell to, to my life and to my childhood,\nand I was sixteen at that point.",
        "Q: In the ghetto, tell me about some of things you remember.",
        "A: Well, you know, as much as I dreaded going to the ghetto, um, actually in some ways, it was a\nlittle easier for me because my friends were there, you know, I was not as isolated as I had been at\nhome, when we had curfew and I could see my friends only at a certain time, and it was dangerous\nto go out anyway, but still we were uh, I was closer to my friends, so um, that somewhat\ncompensated for, for the treatment so, so you know in, in, in every little room another tragedy\nplayed. Um, and then we had to work, um, and uh, in a nearby community called Badovitz, they\nhad the shops there, where they were sewing uniforms for, I guess for the army, and we were\nmarched, my, my mother and IJ and all, all went. Of course, you know, in the ghetto there were\nalmost no men, there were mostly women and children, older people. My father, uh, was one of\nthe few because he had had that heart attack and he was permitted to stay but he had to work in the,\nalso in the nearby little town to fortify the river, 1n a place called Suhar, and uh we were terribly\nworried every morning that might be daybreak, 4 or 5 0 clock that he'd left because he had a heart\ncondition, and we were afraid what that hard labor will, will do to him, and uh, my mother and I\nand some of my friends who few blessedly are still alive, um had to go to, to Baravitz to work 1n, in\nthat uh, shop sewing. We left in the morning and came back late at night and then the whole thing\nstarted again, and actually I uh, I, I think the discipline was, was pretty good, you know you are so\ntired, you worked so hard that uh you did not get too much time to reflect of, of what was\nhappening. At least for me it was, I'm sure it was much more difficult for my mother. And, and\nthen well, um, -----------------from 1939 uh till the worst day of my life, the 28th of June, 42. Um,\nthat is when I saw my father for the last time, the following day my mother. We were told to\nassemble. Uh, the day before um, we were, I uh, I heard my parents, of course, you know we all\nlived in one room, and I heard my parents talk through that night, and I still cannot comprehend\ntheir incredible bravery. They spoke only of, of their lives together, of their love, their good times,\ntheir children, their parents, and with that they faced the morning. I don't know, it sort of became\nuh, perhaps my own defense, I always felt, you know and thinks got-------------and volunteers???\nthat I had to emulate my parents. If they could do it, I can do it. And then I must, you know, never\ndisappoint them, I knew that that if they return and, and I thought, those things are, these, I thought\nwhen they return, I will never will say, you know, I will, I will show them that I um, that I'll come\nback, I'll do everything to come back to them because I remember how, how horrible it was for\nthem when my brother left. Blessedly they never knew that my brother did not return. But, you\nknow, that was the daily conversation, when Arthur comes back home and this and that. And I felt\nthat, you know, I owed it to them to, to stay alive, no matter what, and not give them the pain of\nthat loss. And however, you know we had, of course I always had a great --------------, so I was not\nparticularly religious, I had a great deal of respect for religion and books, and um, one of the things\nI wanted to do after I said goodbye to my father, I wanted to I, I knew what would happen in the\nghetto, you see my father was taken away on Sunday the 28th of June, and um, I asked a friend of\nmine to go with me and collect uh prayer books, you know, I, I was afraid when they'll find it,\nthey'll probably use it for toilet tissue or something like that. And we dragged, was a rainy day, and\nwe dragged those books out to little cemetery which was adjacent to the ghetto, and an old uh\ncemetery, we took the books there, we, we couldn't really bury them, but we sort of stashed them\non one of those where they were um, I, I guess were, were some cottons and things where\napparently I, I don't remember that too well, but I know that this is how we first tried to bury some\nof them, and that sort of, you know, if it's a decency of, of, of a burial. I would rather night recall\nthe night the last night which I spent with my mother which was a very bitter, and then 1n the\nmorning, you know, very, very early in the morning, uh, came the final moment. Uh, when they\nrushed through the ghetto with their whips and what have you. My poor mother, you know, my\nbrother left on a Monday, and he left it 3 years prior to that. And my mother fasted every Monday,\nsort of atoning, I don't know for what. Uh, probably begging God if she's going to fast that my\nbrother will return, and that was also on a Monday, and I, I remember I begged her to have\nsomething to eat and she wouldn't, but she had also uh, saved from before the war, a bit of cocoa,\nand uh, and some jam, and she decided to make that cocoa for me that morning. I remember it, she\nwas looking at that cocoa with great longing, we didn't have any throughout. But, it didn't taste\nparticularly sweet on that morning. We had to march through our town, and um, my...I guess it's a\nsort of a similar journey than a journey to execution when I think of it now because, you know,\nyou saw people looking out from behind curtains. Some waving sort of a mute farewell, uh, seeing\nuh somebody was painting a new sign on a shop. The movie was putting on a new feature on the\nmarquee, and uh, and we were marching. Ah. Was an SS man there that turned, that was near the\nrailroad tracks where the circus used to come, was sort of a an empty place, accommodating all\nkinds of things as a circus before, and now sort of a tragedy of ------------nature.",

        "Q: If you could pick up, maybe you should tell me who Marin was and...",
        "A: Okay. I, I was with my mother, and a number of my friends, who were with their mothers, and\num, we heard that Marin was there. Um, Marin was um, a man of um, uh, if the stories to be\nbelieve of uh, not anyone to, to be greatly admired. Um, a man apparently of a little character,\nwhat have you, he was called an opportunist, and uh, this opportunity was presented to him that he\nuh was, was working with uh, with the government there. The story also had that he uh he had a\nchild, a little daughter whom apparently he adored, and that he would do anything in order to save\nthat child, and um, the Nazis apparently gave him that opportunity that if he would be helpful to\ninterpret or get people to come there, his child would be saved. That was the story, I don't know\nhow, how much truth that was in it. But I saw him, he was a, a very small sort of sour-looking man\nand it was, it was raining but it was oppressively hot because it was the end of June, and he was\nwearing a sleek raincoat, and uh, and then of course there were the Germans in uniforms, the Nazis,\nthe SS, he was standing to the side, we had to form a line, and an SS man stood there with um, with\na little stick and um, I was holding hands with my mother, I came up to him, and he says, \"How\nold?\" I said, \"18,\" and he sort of pushed me to one side and my mother to the other side. I, I wasn't\naware what was happening at that particular point, but shortly thereafter, when I stood with my\nother friends who were also separated from their mothers, we realized that we were going to go to\nseparate places. There was enclosure, an enclosure there, this barbed wire, to, to the right where\nour mothers were, and we were immediately taken to, to the left. Now again, I, I don't remember\nthe time sequence at all. I just remember a tremendous panic and uh, and shortly thereafter some\ntrucks arrived, uh, open trucks with, with sort of a gate behind it, and we were loading in the truck,\nand uh, I heard my mother\u2019s voice and I thought ask, \"Where to?\" and I shouted back, \"I don't\nknow.\" And, I guess I must have been aware that that I was taken away from my mother so I\njumped off, and Marin came, and he was very slight, small man, I didn't expect such strength in\nhim, and he picked me up bodily and he threw me on the truck and he says, \"You are too young to\ndie.\" And, uh, I guess, the trucks were set in motion, again, I tried, I don't remember the, the time\nsequence and uh, I just heard my mother's voice over the entire uh, over crying and everything, and\nit came like an echo and she was saying, you know, \"Be strong,\" you know, \"-------,\" in German.\nAnd then the trucks rolled out of there, and, ironically the, the sun came out sort of um, I still see it,\nthe rooftops looked wet, illuminated by the sun, and the church bells were ringing, and that was the\nlast view. We were taken to...were taken to a train, and of course, I was with my friends, and I\nthink we, we all started talking and facing the reality what was probably happening, and I\nremember rejecting it completely, thinking it cannot be, you know. Uh, they're going to be all\nright, and frankly, that kept me going all those years. They have to be all right. We went to\nSosnovitch, which was a transit camp. Uh, you see our part, it belonged to Austria before the first\nworld war. This is why we were German-speaking, this was quite early, this was 1942 and 42, and\num, and that transit camp, your names, your ages, and the places you hail from were registered. I\ncame from Berlitz, which was a well-known textile center, they called it the Manchester of Central\nEurope, and the people would come from all over Germany who were in need of labor. The men\nwere in the army, the women were given responsible positions, and they needed slave labor,\nhowever they needed people who could understand German and speak German. So, we were in a -\n---------------position. And a man came from Kramstamatnaphronic???, which was a very large\ntextile um center I guess, or maybe many factories, in Germany, and he bought us for that factory\nto be slaves, and, but, in that --------------, transit camp, I think I came face to face for the first time\nwith the concept of concentration camp, to which of course, slave labor concentration, we were\nbecause uh, shipments came with girls from the camps who were either named -------------, and that\nwas um, the last stop before Auschwitz, and I met those girls, and I remember my first contact was\nprobably the first evening when we when we stood, um, in line to get some food out of you know --\n--------aluminum bowls, you know, we used to feed our dogs out of bowls like that, and I didn't\nunderstand when that bowl was given to my hand, what to do with it. And then we stood in line,\nand I got some food, and uh, I remember putting a spoon in and scraping because there was sand in\nthe bottom, you know, and I saw this girl was you know, her hair was uh very short shorn hair, and\nshe had enormous eyes, she was emaciated, and she looked sort of hungry, and I asked if she\nwanted it, and she looked at me as if I gave her the greatest treasure, and she said, \"Yes,\" she said,\n\"Aren't you hungry,\" and I said, \"No,\" and she was sort of silhouetted against, uh, this fence, and\nshe sort of gave a benediction when, when she get it, and then she handed me an, an empty bowl\nand I, I didn't understand, and she said, \"You know, if I, we found with two bowls, I'll be beaten\nthat I stole it.\" She gave me that that bowl, and that was sort of the first impact of things to come. I\nuh was with a very close friend of mine, Ilsa, who was like a sister to me, we had grown up\ntogether, and a number of my other friends, and there I met people who became my best friend's\nfamily to each other, my friend Liesl, my friend, Susie. One was from Vienna, and the other one\nfrom Prague. We became very close friends, and we were sent to camp called Bolkoreim. And\num, strangely enough, on, on that ride from Sosnovitz from the transit camp to concentration camp,\num, there was a certain lightness which I remember , and uh, I can identify it now as um, the worst\nhas happened, and as, as tragic as it was to be separated from my parents, in a way it was um\nalmost you know, some of my fear left me there. You know, I was always afraid that I would see\nsomething, you know, and I once saw an SS man beat my father, and, I mean those were the most\nhorrible things. And to see my parents concern about me and their concern about each other. Now\nI knew that uh whatever would happen would happen to me, and uh, for some reason, I was really\nnot afraid any longer. When I was with young girls, we went together, and then it was, was almost\num something lighthearted that that happened there, and um, and I think that in itself um, I think it,\nit, it's much easier to bear whatever happens to you alone, not to watch someone you love, to, it's\nhappening to them, and also to see their, their concern and pain when it's inflicted on you. This is\nwhy I think perhaps it was so much more difficult for people uh that had to suffer together. And of\ncourse, youth, you know, also is uh, you know, is resilient, that, at that point I was 18, and uh, then\nof course, I was in the camps for 3 years.",

        "A: uh, we made an incredible bet on that train. That girl I met, was a, was a beautiful girl, her\nname was Susie Kuhns, and uh, Susie said that war is, how long, she said, to me, we stood at the\nwindow of the train, she said, \"How long do you think it's going to last?\" And I said, \"Oh, it will\nbe wonderful when we make the journey back. It's going to be probably less than a year,\" and she\nsaid, \"Ah, less than a year,\" she said, \"No, they'll kill us first,\" she said. \"It uh, it's going to be a\nlong, long time.\" And I said, \"Well, let's bet. Like make a bet,\" and she said, \"Okay, what shall we\nbet for?\" and she, she said, \"I love strawberries, field strawberries passionately and whipped\ncream.\" I said, \"Okay, then we'll bet for, for whole quarter of it,\" and we, we shook hands there,\nand made that bet. I lost the bet, but I didn't pay it. She died tragically on liberation morning. In\nCzechoslovakia. I don't know if she knew that we were free or not. I rather think she did not.",

        "A: The camp, the camp we came to um was a small town called Bolknehein, I remember. We were\nmarched from the railroad station. People looked very curiously at us. Uh, we came to an\nenclosure, uh, adjacent to the factory, which had a couple, uh, uh, uh a barrack, and um, was a\ntremendous click as the gates closed, sort of a finality, and there stood a woman clad all in black,\nand she was literally barking. I have never heard a human voice being that harsh. She looked like\na bulldog, she, you know, and I said, \"This 1s, this is going to be absolutely the worst.\" We were\nsupposed to refer to her as uh Frau Kligler. She turned out to be the hope, the inspiration and the\nknowledge that perhaps not all Germans were cruel. She was a decent wonderful warm caring\nhuman being. No doubt she was picked for her position because of her looks, but the looks\ncompletely belied what was underneath it all. She was decent, she was good. We stayed in that\ncamp for a little over a year. No one was sent to Auschwitz. Uh, I don't know if she particularly\nloved us, but uh she pinned a lie to the lips of all those who said they had no choice. I personally\nam indebted to her for my own life at one point when this infamous Lindner, who was known for\nhis cruelty, should come to for an inspection of the camp, and I had been very ill at the time, I was\nrunning a very high fever, and I was permitted to stay in my bunk, and she came in with 2, no there\nwas 3 of us who were ill, and she came in she said, \"Girls, get yourself together.\" And I remember\nI couldn't put my, I had my skiing boots, and my father made me wear my skiing boots when I left\nhome, skiing boots in June, and I blessed him for it because I wore those boots for 3 years in every\nseason, and I remember she stooped down to tie my boots and she literally dragged me and the two\nother girl to the factory. She had worked in the factory before. And she set my looms in motion,\nand said, \"Pull yourself together. This is life or death today.\" And, uh, before we left Germany, ---\n--------the few of us who survived all left the positions that if Frau Kligler should be found, you\nknow she might have been arrested for, for being the head of a camp, where actually she was the\nperson who had saved many lives. And uh, she was sort of a bright light in this darkness.",
        "Q: Uh, there was spiritual resistance when you were in that camp, and she sort of must have looked\nthe other way, can you tell me...",
        "A: Oh sure. You know, I mean, look, she demanded certain things, I mean I don't want to give you\nthe impression that you know she was too--we worked very hard, you know we were, we were\ntaught to weave, and uh, the work was very difficult, and uh, you know, you had to be very swift\nand that because uh, the material which we were weaving, you know, was, was very poor. The\nthreads would break, and everything was interpreted as a sabotage. If you didn't work it like, uh\nskilled uh weavers would have 2 looms, we had 4 looms to watch. I mean, it was hard uh, uh\nbackbreaking labor, but uh, but we still had some food, I mean uh you know, you, you didn't, you,\nyou would consider it dreadful under normal circumstances, but of what was to follow later, I, I\nthink of that as a transition period you know from uh from home and from, from love and from\nnormalcy to, to the horror which followed, I, I think that uh that she made it bearable, you know.\nShe did not steal any of our food. We, we got the food uh you know. If somebody was ill, as I\nmentioned, I was at that particular time, she let you stay on the bunk, you know. She, she, she\nreally tried. She was a human being, and uh, and I think it was terribly important to meet a human\nbeing under those, those circumstances. You know, to a lot of people, I believe that um a\nconcentration camp seems like a snake pit where people step on each other for survival, they stole\nfrom each other. That wasn't the case at all. And again, I speak only about the camps in which I\nwas. And um, and I can say that I have seen the finest qualities of humanity there. The sharing and\nthe caring, and you know, if uh, whatever one had one shared with somebody else be it a crumb of\nbread, or if somebody had a birthday you know, and on Sunday we sometimes got margarine on\nour bread. We would scrape the margarine off on Sunday from several of the pieces to save it for\nthe person who had the birthday, to honor birthday, put some margarine on the bread, and, and\nthings like that. My closest friend, Ilsa of whom I speak so often once found a raspberry in the -----\n----, and she carried it in her pocket all day long, through a hot day, a raspberry, a total possession.\nAnd that night she reached out and through the barbed wire, and got a leaf and washed it, and she\npresented the ra-raspberry on a leaf. It was her total possession, and people did some wonderful\nthings there, and those are the things that I want to remember. You know, and we had very little\ntime, of course, you know, and most, most of the time we were very tired. Whatever free time we\nhad, but that was used if somebody remembered of seeing a, a particular film or ballet or\nsomething, it was shared, and you know, and an acted out, and um, oh there, there was an\nenormous support system there, and um, it, it that really was the, the other side to survival, that on\none hand we experienced extreme cruelty, and on the other hand, incredible love and friendship,\nand there was a balance there, and there was hope there, you know. And somehow you um, you\nknow, you saw of, of them, the Nazis like um, you know, I, I would fantasize to, to look like a\nsnake or this and that, I mean you didn't think of them as human, but you could identify the others\nas human being. I always thought of them as below my contempt, you know, and this is how you\ncould somehow take it. Sometimes, of course, you fell under the spell of it, you know, when they\nwould march you out and, and tell you that you'll be here all your life and this and that, and I\nalways said, you know, you can fall under that, you know, you have to imagine how uh, how they\nwill look dead and things like that, you know, and I was spinning fantasies, and, and that helped.\nNow again, you know, you, you have to be very young at that time or with a very vivid\nimagination, which fortunately I had so um, you know, I, I could sort of often lift myself out of that\nand imagine different things, and, and almost, almost anything could conjure this type of picture\nsometimes, you know the um, I remember you know working on the looms and we had overhead\nlights and the way um sometimes the light fell on the loom, I could remember that light coming\nthrough to my window in the morning when I was a child waking up, and then I could build a\nwhole picture around that and black out everything that was around me. And I lived sort of in, in a\nworld, you know, you could live on 2 levels, there's, there's no problem about that. And I guess\neven now I do live on two levels, you know, sometimes the other one comes up and makes it a little\nmore difficult when uh, when that intrudes, but most of the time you can, you can keep it down.",
        "Q: Is this where the play was?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Tell me about that.",
        "A: Well um, uh, when Christmas again it was under Frau Kigler's uh time, uh during Frau Kigler's\ntime, I think Christmas and New Ye--and um, Hannukah sort of fell together, and so we had to\nclean the factory. In those days we were allowed a hot shower after that was over and that was the\nbest shower I ever remember, it was hot because no, we, we didn't have hot showers, we were\npermitted to shower once a week cold shower, but this was a hot shower, sort of a special deal, and\nuh, we were going to put on a play because everybody else was busy and Frau Kigler, we did not\nworry with her very much about you know because we did throw some things in Polish and of\ncourse she didn't understand Polish, so that was okay. Uh, my friend Ilsa and I um staged a play,\nand others of course participated 1n it as well. Some people had wonderful singing voices and\ndanced, so we were going to have a performance, and um, this particular play dealt with 2\ngrandmothers. Ilsa and I were two grandmothers in that play. Um, we gathered some um stuff\nfrom under the looms and put it on our hair to make it grey, and we had found little pieces of wire,\nand made such granny glasses, and um, I wrote that play in, in the washroom at night, and the next\nday we performed it. We were sitting near the clearing between the bunks. There was a clearing\nthere, we had pushed the tables aside, and we were talking about the wars, the past, of course, you\nknow, predicting great futures for everyone, and um, I still remember uh, uh the words of the play.\nOne of my friends who as a matter of fact lives in Los Angeles reminded me of, of that particular\nthing, and then we had our two granddaughters come up and they listened to us for a while, you\nknow, sort of with a bored look, and they said, \"Oh, uh, come on let's talk about old boyfriends.\nYou know how old people exaggerate.\" And so we were 17 and 18 respectively at that particular\ntime. We somehow seemed to have hit upon the very core of existence. That someday we will live\nin a place where Jewish grandmothers will be allowed to live, and Jewish grandchildren will live,\nbut best of all, to live in a place where the climate will be such that our children and grandchildren\nwill not believe our tales of the past. The person who played my granddaughter in that play is\nalive; she's in Israel. She is the mother of one of Israel's most decorated heroes. Tragically, the\nperson who played IIlsa's granddaughter is not alive, just as Ilsa is not alive, and neither are the\nfaces that I remember looking at -----------. We performed it on the one naked, very d-------------\nwalk??? in the clearing between the bunks. And it's probably, in retrospect, one of the most\nrewarding moments of my life, I have been able to make them forget, even for an hour.",

        "A: Um, well, I've got to get back to Boltonhein because uh, because the menorah that happened...\nBeep.",
        "A: Um, during the time when we uh, did the play, we also fashioned a menorah out of our evening\nmeal of potatoes. We cut it very carefully, and uh, we had sort of a dilemma. Should we try to\nfind, of course we had no candles, but then we thought even if we had candles, that it would be\nmore symbolic to sort of light the flame of hope within us, without seeing it and that will be the\nunseen things, and uh, and we uh sang so, a song, about Hannukah, but we reworked it, you know,\nto, to a modern then version of this new hopeful menorah and of, of the defiance of, of the\nMacabees??? and uh the little bit of oil, which lasted for 7 days when it was supposed to last only\none night, so you know, we applied it to us, and we, we felt very, very strongly about that. Um, we\nalso did some other things like uh, Yom Kippur when, when we were admonished it, not depressed,\nand not to deliver the prescribed quota of material. Everyone fasted even though we knew that uh\nthe dire consequences if you did not do it, which was difficult even under most normal\ncircumstances. Um, and uh, we were given noodles and sugar at some point. Nobody ate it. And,\num, there was a feeling of of oh of almost holiness and tranquility, um, um, you know it, it, it was a\nvery important victory within you. Yes, you can do it, and that was a victory over, over them, over\nthe Nazis. We could do it within ourselves, and uh, we did a number of, of ,of uh, of things like\nthat. Um, I remember when they were particularly vicious. Not Frau Kigler, but the ones, you\nknow, that were coming in to, to give us the pep talks. There was particularly one Meister Zimmer,\nwhom I absolutely detested, and he was totally bored. He was very intelligent, and uh, spoke\nmarvelously well, I mean, he had almost an hypnotic voice, and he would say that if we stayed all\nour lives, we would learn a decency and things, and he, he just drove me crazy with this type of\nthing because decency was the thing that that I felt my parents lived by and to, to hear 1t mouthed\nby him, it became an ugly thing, and I remember what, what I us---uh, as soon as I was starting to\nfall under his spell, I imagined his ears were sort of protruding a bit, and I imagined how he would\nlook dead, and how worms would come out of his ears, and I remember once I must have smiled to\nmyself because he said to me, \"What, what are you smiling about?\" I didn't know I was smiling.\nSo, um you ,you could take certain things and turn it around, and feel that in your mind, you had a\ncertain victory over the things that that they were saying, and I thought to myself, \"Mmm, sure, he\nwill die long before I will, and I will do such and such,\" and um, it was probably very childish, but\nI think it worked. It sometimes could work very, very well. You could lift yourself above what\nwas there. I remember in one of my ---------------- very much later, um, that I was busy on the\ndeath march, you know, on, on...",
        "Q: Let's go, let's...",
        "A: No, I should leave that one out because that.",
        "Q: No, we're going to do the death march, but we'll do it later.",
        "A: No, because I have this one particular thing that, should I do it later? Sorry, you'll probably cut\nit.",
        "Q: Do it now.",
        "A: Okay. We didn't get anything to eat for days, literally. We were bitter cold and hungry and\neverything and um, I was planning a party after the war, and I had the dilemma for almost an entire\nday if I should have a blue velvet dress or a red velvet dress. Couldn't resolve it. I really liked the\ncolor blue much better as a color, but I knew that red looked better on me, so uh, well, you could\noccupy your mind and hang your thoughts on trivia of that nature. It became very important, and\nthis is how you passed the hours and forgot the hunger and, and the cold. And I uh, I do believe\nthat if you were blessed with imagination that that you could work that. Um, if unfortunately you\nwere a person that faced reality, I think you didn't have much of a chance. I felt I was lucky\nbecause I never faced reality. I still don't. Uh, but when we went, um, when we had to leave\nBoltonheim, which was very hard. We, we left for another camp because we did not have enough\nuh, raw material to, to do any weaving. Um, Boltonheim had a sort of a sister uh factory called, uh,\nthere were several, one of Landeshut, and one was Medsdorf, and so and we were send to\nMedsdorf. Medsdorf was a horrible camp by comparison with Boltonheim. First of all we were\nhoused in, in a bldg maybe on the 6th or 7th or 8th floor, way up and it was terribly hot there, it\nwas middle of the summer. And of course the windows were nailed down, I mean, we were\nliterally broiling there, and the people in charge there were in complete contrast to what we knew\nabout Frau Kigler. There was a Lager Feuhrer in there, who was perhaps 18 or 19 years old, the\nmost vulgar-looking thing. Uh, she was wearing rings on every finger, and then sometimes 2 or 3\nrings on each finger, and she had short stubby red hands, and her enjoyment was to, she had a little\ncart, like children right around, and she would sit in that cart with a little whip, and we had to um\npull her. That was her, her joy, I mean, the mentality of that person was, was not to be believed.\nAnd then there was another person there, who was in charge of us, and she had been um, a guard in\none of the female um jails, and we sometimes had, and the work that we did, um, people who\nwere, who committed some, some sort of misdemeanor or what have you, in jail, came to spend a\nday working with us. And that was our normal work. Um, we worked at different jobs there. Um,\none of the jobs, which was uh dreadful. There were several that were bad. One was to um hand a\nbricks one to another, and we were to throw the brick and, and catch it quickly. If you didn't, it\nlanded on your hands, and uh, it crushed your fingers. The other job was to go in a nearby swamp\nbecause they were growing linen there, and in the swamp, you had to put um, uh, the li--the not\nfinished linen, the thing that had grown into the swamp to because then it opened, uh, the enclosure\nin which the threads, the lin--, the linen was--I don't know if I'm explaining it right--that was\nbackbreaking labor. You had to stand in the swamp doing that, and that's was swarming with\nmosquitoes, and then other thing that we did is uh load into a silo, an enormous silo, I don't know\nhow many stories high, um, a man with a crane was throwing down bundles, and we were standing\non that, and you know the bundles uh, came crashing down, and you had to arrange them, and you\ncould easily be swallowed up in that, first of all, you were swaying all the time, and uh, and then\nthey came so fast that if you didn't catch it fast enough, it hit you and it pricked your skin, and then,\nthen your skin was bleeding, and then you were in the swamp, and the mosquitoes were eating in it.\nIt was a horrible time, and it was there in that silo where some of the women came from jails who\nhad committed murder or God knows what, as punishment for a day, and they said they preferred\nsolitary anytime than to work there. Um, it was there as a matter of fact where I uh, really felt I\nwas going to give up. There was one overseer who uh was particularly cruel to me, and he had\nsingled me out for uh for this type of punishment. So, during the day, I was working with flax or\nuh ----------the bundles. At night we had to shovel coal. And wagons, uh you know, came loaded\nwith coal, we had to shovel it because tracks had to be cleared, and it was going on day and night.\nOnce we saw the trains going by we didn\u2019t\u2019 know if there were trains with uh with German soldiers\ngoing back, and people said there were trains of people we sent to Auschwitz. And um, and I\nremember my resistance really weakening there, and I thought to myself once after the um, the cold\ncar was empty and I was with that, standing on that, with that shovel in my hand, and I, I said it\nwould be so easy now to jump. An oncoming train, and it would be over in, in a couple seconds,\nand become a part of that stillness like we have to face tomorrow. It's, it's going to be tomorrow.\nIt's going to be flax in the morning and, and the bundles at night, and, and the swamp again, and the\nhunger, and that I, I, I just felt I had enough. And I, I resisted that, and then, another day came by\nand the next night it uh, and I remember too, you know, I had promised my father, there was one\nthing I was never going to, to do 1s, is to really give up. It was sort of a, but, but there I came very\nclose to doing it, and I remember that one night, when I definitely saw that it was a beautiful\nmoonlit night, and I said to myself, \"It's time to do it.\" And I heard very faint oncoming of a train,\nvery far away probably. And suddenly I felt a pain in my both sides of my, my neck, very sharp,\nand um, it was right in the beginning of the war when we not heard from my brother and my\nmother was sick, and we were told that we had to leave with 20 lbs of our belongings. Our home.\nAnd I remember standing there, and we heard of a family who committed suicide together, and I\nsort of half-wished that my parents had suggested that. I was also very close to my father, and I\nremember I stood there, and was thinking about that. My father must have guessed my thoughts\nbecause he came up to me, stood behind me and he said, \"What you are thinking 1s, 1s cowardly\nand is wrong.\" And he said, \"Promise me that you are never going to do it.\" I didn't answer him.\nAnd he took my head, as he stood behind me and he turned me back forcefully toward him.",
        "Q: We have to reload.\nChange film to camera roll 6; Sync take 9 is up.\nBeep.\nBeep.",
        "Q: Second Sticks???",
        "A: Uh, very early in the war while we were still at home, as a matter of fact, we were still living in,\nin our own quarters. It was shortly after my brother was taken away. And my, my mother was\nreally gone to pieces. She was quite ill. And my father had the recurring, recurring thing with his\nheart. And we got orders to leave our home with 20 pounds of our belongings, and my father told\nme to sort of pack suitcases, I had no idea how to do that. And I, we had heard of a family who\ncommitted suicide together, and uh I, I really thought at that point that that, that would be good, to\ndo that, and I had hoped that my parents would suggest that. And I remember standing at the\nwindow, and thinking about that. And my father came up behind me, and uh he, he always knew\nwhat I was thinking and he, he said to me, \"What what you were thinking is, is wrong. It's\ncowardly, it's, it's terrible. He said, \"You promise me never to do that no matter what.\" And I\ndidn't answer him, and then he, he sort of took me, he took my head, like that, and he turned it\ntoward me, toward him, and he looked at me, and he said, \"I want your promise now. And I said,\n\"Papa I promise.\" And uh, during those last days in Medsdorf, that promise became pretty faint. I,\nI, I was, I was exhausted, you know, I don't know how, uh anymore, how many days and nights I, I\nwas working in that heat, in, in the swamp, and uh, and the cold, and the just everything --------\ntogether, and I, I, I really wanted to, to end it. And at that precise moment when I really most\ndecided it, I mean, I don't know if I would have carried it through or not, but I have a feeling that I\nthat I was pretty much at the, at the end of my rope there. And I knew that the train was going to\ncome, and I figured, I, I'm going to jump. Suddenly I felt that very sharp pain in my neck. And the\npromise came back, and obviously I didn't. Strange thing is, the following day, everything\nchanged. The following as we were working in the swamp, um, that overseer, that that fury came\nrunning and had a list in her hand, and asked the people who had the following numbers to come\nforward. And I, I, I think my mind must have been so muddled, I wasn't even thinking, um, and\nIlsa's number was called, she was working with me. See, Ilsa was not working nights, uh, at that\nwas sort of directed more against me or, or a few other people, and he called Ilsa's number, and\nnobody rai-raised their hands, and she said, \"Well who has that number?\" And Ilsa took my hand\nand she said, \"She did.\" I wasn't even aware of what she was doing. She obviously was\nsubstituting her number for mine. She wanted to save me from something. And I was led away,\nand Ilsa jumped out of -------, and she also started running, and as we came to the courtyard of the\ncamp, there stood the director of the factory of Boltonheim, and uh, Ilsa literally threw herself at, at\nhis feet, and she said, \"I want to go with my sister.\" So he said, \"What is your number?\" Then she\ngave her correct number and mine, and he said, \"Well you both are on the list.\" So he said, \"You\nrun and wash up you, you look like pigs,\" uh, and actually what was happening is they needed\nmore people for weaving and he came to collect from this particular camp, which was not a\nweaving factory, to an adjacent one called Landeshoot, which was also under the auspices of\nBoltonheim, and uh, again we were loaded on a truck, and I couldn't wait for the gates to open, to\nget out of that, I, I didn't know how to thank Ilsa for it, but I remember that I, I just said to her, \"I'm\nglad I didn't jump.\" And she said, \"What did you say?\" And I said, \"I'll tell you someday.\" I never\ntold her.",
        "Q: How did that Lager Feuhrer have it in for you?",
        "A: Um, I, I can only surmise um I, I was cleaning some, some small component in the camp and,\nand he came up--he, he wasn't a lager fuehrer, he was, he was um, sort of a supervisor there. And\nhe said to me, \"Um how, how would you like some hot soup or some bread?\" You know, which\nwas sort of, I said, well, I said to myself, \"Why is he saying that to me?\" If he wanted to help me,\nwhy doesn't he give me a piece of bread?\" You know. So, I sort of said, uh, \"Well, I eat in camp,\"\nwhich I felt, you know, was, was stating the truth without accusing them that they're not giving us\nenough to eat, but, but not saying anything, and so I uh, I gathered that he had maybe a certain\ndesigns on me, or maybe just wanting to test me, I don't know, you know, they were, well, that,\nincidentally, in our camp was not much of a problem. There were a lot, uh, there were very few\nmen around working in the camps, were mostly old, and there were a lot of young pretty German\ngirls there, so that was, that was not a problem. I, I don't know. In any event, I think, just the type\nof defiance that I showed, uh he decided to sort of break my spirit, maybe out of sport or, or just to\nshow his ------------, and this is what I was picked for. For every type of, of hard work. But um, I\nthink it's a terribly important lesson. One should never ever, ever give up. No matter how difficult\na thing is you know, uh, giving up 1s a final solution to a temporary problem. Our problem wasn't\nso temporary. Nevertheless, it would pass, but one was keenly aware of the preciousness of life,\nand to hold on to it as long as possible, and to me, this was really the most important thing, and I\nwould say that during that entire time that I was in the camp, was a little, I mean, except for the\nbeginning of the war when I really did not know, and only heard that the family had chosen that\npath together. This was the only incident that I remember, through all the years, that I really came\nclose to calling it quits. That's why I love to say to young people, never ever, ever give up. The\ndarker the night, the brighter the dawn, and it sure was bright. And it sure was dark.",
        "Q: I want to jump back to your 18th birthday, what your mother did.",
        "A: My 18th birthday was literally a few weeks, my birthday is May 8th, and on the 29th, 28th and\n29th of January, the 29th I left, I was separated from my mother on the 28th and my father, it was\nabout 5 weeks before, so that was my last birthday. And uh, my mother decided to have a party.\nShe invited a number of my friends and she somehow had gotten some oatmeal, and baked some\ncookies, which we all swore tasted marvelously well, like almonds, and um, my parents gave me an\nincredible present. They gave me an orange. I've always loved oranges. And of course, then an\norange in the ghetto was, was impossible. I later learned that my mother had given a very treasured\nand very valuable ring for that orange, and that was the last present I got from my parents.",
        "Q: Tell me about your brother-------------.",
        "A: My brother was almost two and a half years older than I, and he uh, he was really my hero. My\nbrother was very good looking, and people used to say, uh, my mother was a very beautiful\nwoman. People used to say, \"It's a shame she has such a beautiful mother, and that she looks like\nher father, but the boy looks so much like the mother.\" So you know, I always sort of grew up in\nthe shadow of my brother, who was extremely good-looking and very accomplished, and\neverything he touched he seemed to be able to do well, and we fought at times, but by and large, he\nwas a wonderful brother. He always protected me, and uh, and of course, he had his friends\ncoming to the house, and there were boys around you know, and I, I started to get interested in\nboys. And a lot of my friends were seeking my friendship because of my brother. And um, the\nfirst day when the Nazis came in there, rounded up people they would find, and put them in the\ntemple, and set the temple on fire, that was really the first, the first deed, the first horror which was\ninflicted upon the citizens of the town. And it was shortly before my brother was taken away when\nhe had to go to register at uh what was like the community center, which was not too far from the\ntemple. The temple had been destroyed. Of course. And I went with my brother. I don't\nremember if it was now on the way to where to register, or on the way back, I rather think it was on\nthe way back. We passed by the temple, and we climbed over the debris, and we were sitting there\ntalking, and was sort of he, he talked to me very seriously. You know, usually he, he talked down\nto me a bit, but it was more like an equal, and uh, it was one uh, pillar of the temple that stood on\nall the destruction, and he said to me, \"Look at that one.\" He said, \"It survived. We are going to\nsurvive. They can't do it to us.\" And then, he picked up a couple of little stones, which were\ncharred, and he put one in his pocket and he gave me one, and he said, \"I want you to carry it with\nyou all the time, to remind you of, of this. Of the temple and our conversation.\" And I, I carried it\nwith me, but uh, later on, on that death march, I must have lost 1t someplace, I carried it in a little\nsack. I had sewn a little sack, and I, I carried it on, on my neck with a string. I, I lost it.",

        "A: Sort of getting a little... Well...three years in the camp became progressively worse as um, raw\nmaterial was running out, and also as uh it seemed that the war was taking a different turn. We sort\nof knew that if Germany should be victorious, our doom is going to be sealed. But if, for what we\nprayed for that, that we would be liberated, we were afraid that when things start turning uh bad for\nthem, they are going to let uh their, their venom and their frustrations out on us, so that was really a\nno win situation. It became pretty obvious in the winter of 1944 as it turned to 45, when um, uh\nthere were fr-a frequent um we heard planes coming in and, and uh, uh production stopped, and\nthings were, were getting bad, and then on the night of the 28th, rather the day of the 28th of\nJanuary, 45, we did not go to work. Was a workday, and we did not go to work. We were told to\nstay incamp. And toward evening we heard an enormous commotion, and uh, a transport of 2000\ngirls came from Auschwitz, mostly Hungarian girls. They told us they had been marching, that um,\nAuschwitz, uh the Russian front had moved closer, Auschwitz was being liberated, and they were\nrunning away from the advancing Russian army. And uh, we, we were going to join that march the\nnext morning. Was bitter cold. Was in January. And I was coughing terribly, I had a very bad\ncold. And my 3 dearest friends, Susie Kuhns, Lizzy Schteburn, Ilsa Klein Zeller and I, we hurried\ntogether the four of us, and they, they were very concerned about me, they said, \"You know, if you\ncan only pull through with that terrible cold and the terrible cough,\" like the pneumonia or what\nhave you. And in the morning, very early, the doors opened, not to the type of freedom we had\nhoped, but it opened to an, an incredible picture. There was freshly fallen snow for as far as the eye\ncould see. And an enormous sort of it was a plateau, and then it came up to, to a gentle hill, and it\nwas just, just covered with snow. It was grey, it was snowing, and uh we were told to uh assemble\nfor a -----------, so of course, there was the four of us, and uh we held hands, and we took the first\nstep, and I guess we all knew that this was going to be the first step to the end of the road. Either to\nliberation or to, to doom. And in front of us stretched this incredible line. Well, people looked you\nknow with, with grey uh camp blankets over them, and they looked like winged death. That's all\nyou could see. Way, way ahead, four thousand girls. And on the side were the SS men and the SS\nwomen, and they lifted their whips and they said, \"Forward march.\" And we started to march.\nStarted to march, it was the 29th of January. And we, we left a lot of girls back in the snow. And\nthey were killed. That was something one can barely, can really not describe. My father had asked\nme when I last saw him in June the very last day, practically in the last moment, before he left, he\nsaid to me, \"Where are your skiing boots?\" I said, \"Why?\" And he said, \"I want you to wear them\ntoday.\" I said, \"Papa, skiing shoes in June?\" He said, \"I want you to wear them.\" One didn't argue\nwith one's father. So I put on those boots and I wore them throughout my entire stay in the camps\nfor 3 years, and in them I'd also hidden the pictures of my parents and my brother. I didn't know,\nand I don't know how my father could have known that those boots were really instrumental in\nsaving my life on that march. I had ski shoes. Some girls had sandals. We slept outside. The\nfrost, I saw girls breaking off their toes like twigs. And I had my ski boots. On the 29th of April,\nrather I should say on the 28th, Ilsa wasn't well at all. She was sort of hallucinating. She was\nsaying things which, I didn't know what she meant. And uh, when we stopped for the night, if a lot\nof girls, they put ---------, the girls who had died, I dragged away from there, and I, and she didn't\nseem to know what was going on. But then she became totally lucid, and one of the most shocking\nthings was that one of my other friends had somehow found two potatoes. And she gave them to\nme, she said, \"It's for you and for Ilsa.\" I gave Ilsa the potato and she said she wasn't hungry.\nThat's the most incredible statement, not to be hungry. And she said to me, \"You eat it.\" And then\nshe said, she said, \"I'm angry at no one. I hope nobody is angry at me.\" And then she said, \"If my\nparents and kitty, kitty, was her little sister,\" she said, \"If they survive, don't tell them how I died.\"\nAnd she said to me, \"You'll be alone.\" She said, \"But you have always been lucky.\" And I begged\nher not to say it, but she did. And she said she wanted some water, and there was a little brook\nnearby, so [| --------, and I wanted to, to get it, and an SS man came, and he shoved me, and I\nbegged him to let me have water for her, and he kicked her head. So, it was raining and sort of, so I\ncaught some water in my hands and gave it to her, and I held her, and we both fell asleep. I woke\nup, and she didn't.",

She asked me to promise her to go on for one\nmore week. She said, \"You have to promise me. No matter what, you will hang on for another\nweek.\" Little did I know that a week later, exactly to the day, maybe even to the hour of her death,\nwe were liberated.\"",

        "Q: Well, not so much on the march, it was before we, we had particularly Liesl and I. Susie um,\nuh, Susie faced things much more, it was uh, it was Susie who said, \"We probably won't have a\nchance. They will kill us first.\" But, um, but Liesl and I uh, we had a wonderful game. You know,\nwe could play a game, and just uh fall into the game while, while we were still in camp and we\nworked on the night shift. At one stretch we worked for 9 months on the night shift, and um, I\nremember waking up and it was raining. We uh, the camp had over, had like a factory you know,\nuh, then the windows were on top, and you could hear the patter of the rain, and we must have both\nwoken up at the same time, and um, and she said, \"Oh it's a rainy day.\" And I said, \"Yeah, but I've\ngot to get up, you know, I have an appointment.\" And she said, \"I have an appt with the\ndressmaker.\" I said \"Yes,\" but she said \"I've got to go first out to the garden and pick up some\ngreen apples. They taste wonderful after the rain.\" And then she would say, \"You know, I, I need\na new raincoat, and I have to do this, and then I uh, and then my mother expects me to clean up my\nroom and you know, we would use the, the ordinary would suddenly became extraordinary, but we\ncould go on like this for hours, spinning the sort of tales which totally blocked out reality, and\nmade the, the horror around us, you know, would disappear. And um, I think it was those things\nwhich uh, which helped enormously, survival. Didn't know you, you dredged them up from some,\nsometimes from recesses of whatever of your, of your mind, and the other thing became the\nabnormal. We were right back there. We blocked everything else out and um, and then also was\nuh, uh, I mean, uh, there was some humor, there was some, there was laughter.",

        "A: There was laughter in the camps, there were, there was joking, there, there were funny stories,\nthere were things that uh, that lightened our burden. You do not live through 3 years like that\nwithout those gallows humor but uh, but humor nevertheless, and um, we played the games of\npretending, we did it very well. Some, some better the others, you know, some people were never\npart of it, and said, you know, \"You are crazy, you're insane,\" but we did it mostly Liesl and I. Um,\num, Ilsa was much more serious. Ilsa was a musician, she was a very fine pianist. At a very early\nage, she was sent to Vienna to study at the conservatory of music. She really showed enormous\npromise pianist. Uh, Susie was by far the most intellectual of the group, and probably the most\nmature. Um, she had lost her mother when, uh when she was a baby, and I think she, she was\nmuch more serious, uh, Liesl and I both had older brothers, and um, were younger sisters, and I, I\nthink we had more of a sense of fun and, and uh, she was, incidentally, she was dressed beautiful,\nshe was probably one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen. Uh, Susie was a redhead with\ngreen eyes. Liesl was dark and enormous dark eyes, --------also. And um, I was the happy one in\nthe group, there were, all 3 were just beautiful girls. Um, in a way we had much in common and\nwe sort of supported um each other, we, we made a lot of fun of, of each other as well, and of\nothers, if the truth must be told, but it was all part of it, 1t established a certain, a certain normalcy,\nand um...",

        "A: Of course, I mean it,\n(Sandy says something)",
        "Q: Uh, well, well, there were wonderful ways of cursing them for instance, one of which was he\nshould, he should become an onion, uh, was it an onion? Yeah I guess so, with, with the head, with\nthe head buried in the ground and uh, I, I don't remember some of these things. Oh, one of the\nfavorite things was we, we called them a lamp, and was a lamp because during the day, he should\nhang, and at night he should burn, uh things like that, was not, not particularly attractive, but um,\nwas one of those things, and uh, we mostly did caricatures of them. You know, of um, of what they\nlooked like and we, we give them certain names. Um, I don't recall some of the names anymore,\nbut imagine them in different settings and um, and we didn't think highly of them, to be sure. Uh,\nthe ones which, which were most, most threatening were, were the others like uh, uh Meister\nZimmer and so on, who had a different approach to it, you know, the one who regarded us as uh, as\ncomplete idiots, and uh, talked down to us as, as if we were we didn't know the most elementary\nthings. That was much easier to take, you know, because we looked down on them. Uh, the\nothers, who had much higher intellect, and who knew exactly where to where to hurt and what type\nof things to say, that was more difficult to take. But, by and large, I think we, we were able to do\nthat. And that would only become sort of as a support system, you know, one talked to the other\nabout it, you know, and, and say, you know, this, this idiot uh gave us some talking today, listen,\nlisten to that one, I mean, things like that. Um, it was pretty bitter, by and large, but um, but in a\nway we could laugh it away. And of course, you know, that constant um, uh, uh, radio broadcast,\nwhich was broadcast through the camp, which usually started with um, with a melody. We knew\nwhen that started, whenever it went, ------------------------: We are, we are going against England.\nAnd, following that uh, that little musical interlude always came and announcement of the\nincredible victories which they had won.

        "A: It was on the way from um the transit camp in Sosnovitz to the first camp in Boltonheim when\nwe were on the train, and uh, this is actually where I met Susie. She introduced herself, she was a\ntall, very pretty girl, with auburn hair, and two freckles on her nose, very open uh face, and um, she\nintroduced herself as Susie Kuhns, she had come from Vienna. Her mother had died when she was\na baby. Her grandmother lived in, in Czechoslovakia, and uh she spent a great deal of her life in\nthe care of her grandmother, where she was when the war started, in the fall, and um, uh, I said\nsomething to the effect, \"Wouldn't it be wonderful when we make that journey back.\" And she\nsaid, \"We'll never make that journey back,\" and I said, \"Of course we will.\" Uh, she said, \"That\nwar will drag on forever,\" and I said, \"That war is going to be over in less than a year.\" So, well,\nshe said, um, something to the effect, \"You are either very stupid or very hopeful.\" Something like\nthat. So, I said, \"Let's make a bet then.\" And she said, \"okay.\" So we made a bet for a quart of\nwhole?? strawberries, were little,-------, they were called, and uh, and whipped cream. I lost the\nbet. I never paid the debt. Because Ilsa died on liberation morning. I found her dead. I didn't\nknow if she knew that we were free or not. She was an incredible girl.",

        "Q: Okay, we're ready.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: So tell me about liberation.",
        "A: Well this was the very last phase of the war when we were on this death march, which started on\nthe 29th of January in Greenberg, in Silesia. We sort of, our, our destination actually was\nOranenburg, Oranenburg was a murder camp near Berlin. Oranenburg fell into the hands of the\nRussians, and we were zig-zagging through Germany, ending in Czechoslovakia in a tiny place\ncalled ------------, where the march came to a halt. Um, Ilsa had died just a week before. It was\nevening, and um, one of the SS women came by and she mentioned to one of my friends to take my\nboots off, which sort of signaled you know the last thing. My friend, her name was Hanna\nKudlidsky, Hanna Keller in those days, told me that, and she said, \"Hide. Don't let her see you.\"\nAnd um, a truck came, and she said to me, \"You know, you better get on that truck so she shouldn't\nsee you.\" And I said, \"You know I'm, I'm in no hurry.\" And I remember sitting there and, and\nreally knowing that this was definitely the end. Heard American planes overhead, there was\nshooting, and the the German army was running away, there were people on the roads with\nchildren with animals, tremendous chaos, and uh, I was sitting there and it, 1t was really a beautiful\nnight, it was May, it suddenly got a little warmer, and uh, and I permitted myself the luxury of\nthinking of home, of my parents of my, my brother in a different sense. I always thought of home,\nbut um, but somehow this was different. The truck didn't come back for us, and they came, and\nthere was this enormous factory, we were sort of in front of it, and they it was in the they locked the\ndoors, and was told that they planted a time bomb to, to blow us up--won't fall into the hands of\nwhoever were coming. We didn't know if it would be the Russians or the Americans or what. I uh,\nI must have been pretty sick during that night. I um, uh, only isolated things which, which I\nremember, when I remember that we, we tried to break out of there, and we couldn't, the doors\nwere really locked and, and chains were put around it and everything. And uh, it started to rain.\nTorrential rain, which obviously somehow um, the bomb and -------- did not connect. And then we\nare told that they're coming back. I remember crawling in into one of those long um chimney, a\ncylinder that was on the floor, and a few of us crawled in there, and there was some shooting, I\nremember a bullet went by, and then it was quiet again, and then the doors, must have been the\nfollowing morning, the doors were opened, the Czech people called and said the war was over. Uh,\nI, I didn't understand the reality of, of that at all. My , uh, then there were some Americans that\nnight before, but my two um impact of...of freedom and of it being over actually must have\nhappened that following morning. I do know that the SS had run away, and they had changed their\nuniforms into civilian clothes. I did find um one of those great coats, from the army, and I\nwrapped, wrapped myself in it and, and tried to sleep on the floor. I must have been quite feverish,\nI was already I think quite ill, and it was the following morning that it, I, as I said we met the\nAmericans the night before, but I think, but all that some-somehow sinks into oblivion. My, my\nvery clear um, view of ,of freedom and liberation came that morning when I stood in this doorway\nof that abandoned factory. And I saw a car coming around the hill. And the reality of that came\nwhen I saw the white star on its hood and not the swastika. There were two men in that car. One\njumped out, came running toward me and asked if there was anyone who spoke English or\nGerman. I told him I spoke German. I remember that aura of him, of that awe, of, of disbelief, in\ndaylight to really see someone who fought for our freedom, for my ideals, and uh, he looked like,\nlike God to me. And I uh, I knew what I had to say, and I said to him, \"We are Jewish, you know.\"\nFor a very long time, at least to me it seemed very long, he didn't answer me, and then his own\nvoice betrayed his emotion, he was wearing dark glasses I couldn't see his eyes, he said, \"So am I.\"\nAnd the impact of that to be liberated not only by an American, but by a fellow Jew, um, it, it, it\njust, so totally uh, I mean, um, I think this is when that that feeling of such an incredible joy which\nfills your, your whole, whole being. It, it, it must have, just burst out, I, I, I remember I couldn't get\na hold of myself then. But then he said, asked a strange question. He said, \"May I see the other\nladies?\" A form of address we hadn't heard for six years.\" I told him that most of the girls were\ninside and were too ill to walk. He said to me, \"Won't you come with me.\" I didn't know what he\nmeant. So he, he held the door open for me and let me proceed in. And that was the moment of\nrestoration of, of humanity of humaneness, dignity and freedom. And this first young American of\nliberation day is now my husband. He opened not only the door for me, but the door to my life and\nmy future. I took him to see my friends, but I was very sad because that morning I went to look for\nSusie, because Lies] said to me, \"Susie went out to get some water, and she has not returned.\" So I\nwent out to look for her, and I found her near the pond. I thought she had fainted, and I touched\nher, and she was cold. I wanted to tell her, \"Susie,\" and I did tell her, I said, \"Susie, we are\nliberated, we are free.\" We had made a bet more than three years earlier on a train which took us to\ncamp. A bet for a quart of strawberries and cream to be payable after the war. I said we will be\nliberated, and she said we would not. I didn't tell Liesl. I couldn't tell her. Liesl was very sick.\nWe all were very sick, we were immediately taken to a field hospital in --------- before a school\nhouse. We were very, very ill. I weighed 68 pounds. My hair was white, so I was going to be 21\nthe following day. I was told that Lies] had trouble with her legs. She had uh been injured, uh, she\nhad been shot in the leg. And I asked to see her, and was told that I was too sick to, to go there and\ncouldn't walk. I kept asking and asking, and I sort of collapsed for quite a while. And finally I was\ntold that she had died. Of the four of us, I was alone. I was the one that had the cold and they were\nall concerned about me that I would not make it, and I was the only one who, who survived. The\nonly one from my family, the only one of my dearest friends.",
        "Q: Tell me about the numbers of the girls that started out and the number of girls who ------------.",
        "A: About 4,000 when we started. 2,000 from our camp. 2,000 that came from Auschwitz. When\nthey were on the way, there were certain divisions, we had stopped in other camps, and a few of the\ngirls had had run away, most of them who had run away, uh were caught and executed. A few\nhowever managed to escape, and uh,-----------------. I'm, I'm not sure of the exact number. Uh,\nwhen we were in the hospital, we were about 120 of this entire transport. Of those, quite a few still\ndied. There is now a cemetery in Volari, Czechoslovaki where we were liberated. There were 95\nor 96, 96 graves, but 95 of our girls were -------------------------. I thought I made liberation such a\nhappy story and I find it didn't turn out that way.\nChange film, camera roll 10 1s up; Sync take 15.\nBeep.",
        "Q: I want you to talk to me about the legacy, the goodness that you saw in ------------------------,\nand feel free to retell the raspberry story, or other examples that you've done before as though you\nhadn't told before. Tell me when. Now.",
        "A: Now? Looking back now over almost half a century, it is half a century, um, I think one is\nstruck by the nobility of the spirit which also lived in this darkness. The act of kindness, the type\nof support, the selflessness and the love, which I think was the support system to be able to endure\nthat. A belief in something. Not, uh the inhumanity of, of our um captors, but, but the humanity\nwhich existed in the victims. And there was a great deal of that. My friend Ilsa, who gave me that\nraspberry, she carried it in her pocket all day long on a hot incredible day, and derived joy of giving\nit to me. Um, the one time when we uh stood roll call for, for a long time, and a piece of bread\nsailed over the barbed wire into our group and one of the girls caught it, and we all knew whence it\ncame and who had it. And we were all questioned, we were all beaten, no one gave the person\naway. If someone which became much more difficult later when we were not with Mrs. Kigler any\nanymore, who had showed such humanity, but later on when really cruelty and bestiality was the\nreign, um, one helped the other. You know, if somebody couldn't work or was sick, you know, we,\nwe all tried to, to help the other person, to pull them through. Um, and, and that was taken\nabsolutely for granted. Now I don't mean to say that that everyone there was, was angelic. I mean\nuh, we were human, but by and large, and this is why, you know, when I wrote my first book, to me\nit was the most important thing to be able to put on that it 1s all based on truth, I used all names, all\nplaces, and I whatever I have written, I always use my maiden name as well as my married name. I\nwant anyone to challenge the truth of that statement. Unfortunately so few stories you know\nsurvived. Um, so little has been said about that, you know because the overwhelming thing there\nof course was uh, was so horrible, and, and when one tries to um, to explain the holocaust, it uh, it\nis a horror which um, which has the upper hand because such horror has, has never, uh, never been\ndone to, to, to people with so, that somehow what seems to escape are the little acts of kindness, the\neveryday thing, which, which really spurred the spark of hope that one had to have in order just to\ngo on. And that was the, and I don't know of anyone who committed suicide. The camp was\nsurrounded by barbed wire, which was electrically charged. Not one person that I know of ever\nwent and touched it. So we certainly had enough reason to, to do it quickly. No one did.\nEveryone wanted to live with, with every fiber of one's being, and I think that was a defiance.\nThey wanted us dead, but we are going to live for as long as we possibly can. And we did, and this\nis why it is so sad, that when one sees pictures of concentration camp, one sees those big vacant\neyes over the barbed wire, people who look more like animals than as human beings and no one\nseems to know what was going on uh in the minds and hearts of the people, that they were looking\nat something beautiful. I remember one time, a, a bird flew into camp, and it perched itself on a\nbunk and started to sing. No, no one ever had a more appreciative audience than that bird did, and\nhow, how we watched its flight then to freedom over, over the barbed wire and ov-ov-over the\ncamp, and one time in Greenberg, uh, where we also stood for hours roll call. Uh, one spring, in\nthe corner of this courtyard, the among the debris of the cement, a flower poked its head, and you\ncould see hundreds of feet shuffling around it, nobody stepped on the flower. It was something\nincredible to see uh that a flower heralded sort of a new spring of, of, of ----------of beauty. Now,\nyou know, one should not need uh stay in a concentration camp to appreciation of, of beauty, but,\nbut it was an incredible moment to see that, that many things that one sees for granted. Um, there\nwere beautiful things there. Unfortunately, and that is always the biggest pain, that so few lived to\nknow the joy of freedom, and that is the most painful thing. And sometimes the difficulty to, to\nenjoy all the things, to know how many were deprived of it. That's, that's the hardest thing. But I\nthink if one can somehow give the legacy of the nobility to the inheritance of this new spring and\nnew generation of children and grandchildren, who have grown up in freedom. If they can\nunderstand it and, and value it, then, they have achieved a sort of immortality. I think this is really\nwhy they have to understand something, because it is difficult. You know, millions, numbers have\nno meaning. It's the identification is one that counts, and if, if someone somehow today, and\npeople who live in freedom can take the identity of just one who was deprived of it at all, and live\ntheir lives vicariously, and enjoy the things for which, which they have so hungered, I think that uh,\nthat we will build a better world. And I have hopes for the world in spite of everything.",

You know, I mean, uh it was Poland you know, and we, we love Poland it was uh, uh at\nleast a young generation, you know because the older generation had grown up, up under Austria,\nbut of course, we were born under Poland, and uh, this is something I couldn't understand and, and\nprobably uh the most, the most vivid example of that was that my friend Trudy, who uh had a ve-a\nvery bitter life and her mother had died, and she had a stepfather, her mother married a, a that man\nwent through, there was very little, he was terribly cruel to her, and he was beating her, and she\nspent so much time with us, was a, a, you know, and I, I really felt oh so close to her, and I saw her\ngoing to our garden and picking white roses. My mother was particularly proud of them because\nthey had bloomed out of season and, and she was handing it to a sold--to a German soldier, you\nknow, and people were bringing, and, and, and I think that gesture always sticks in my mind as, as\none of complete betrayal, and also I remember her handing the roses to the soldier who is reaching\nout to her, and at that moment, someone else was handing him a glass of Schnapps, or what, you\nknow, it was some sort of whiskey, and he let the roses fall to, to, to, to the ground and people were\ntrampling on my roses, and um, uh, I don't know tt, it's sort of like 1t became a symbol for me, that\nvery moment, it's arrested in my mind that uh, what, what was happening there, that everything was\nsort of upside down, and um...I don't know.",
        "Q: Then there was a woman, you know people, how people try to be helpful, I, I don't mean to uh,\nuh to say that um, that 1t was a direct betrayal of us, at that particular point it was not, but of...",
        "Q: Four is up.",
        "Q: Of course we, we had some very good and very close friends among our neighbors, and uh, one\nwoman, her name was uh Frau Resher, I remember, she came in, and she asked where the Polish\nFlag was. The Polish flag, of course, is uh, a strip of white and a strip of red, very long strips, and\nmy mother said, \"Why?\" And she said, it's really very easy to make a German flag out of it, you\nknow, all you have to do is um cut out around um thing of the from the white and then pose it on\nthe, on the red, and then with a ribbon, make the swastika, you know, I, and my mother absolutely\nturned pale, and the woman said, \"We we better make that flag and fly from the house, you know,\nobviously she wanted to protect us because uh, the houses which did not fly uh the swastika flag uh\nwere under scrutiny, and uh, they figured that they were you know, anti-German, and they\ndiscovered that we were Jewish so uh, she just took the flag, my mother looked for it in all places\nwhere she knew she couldn't find it, but finally she did produce it and uh, and she did make, my\nmother did not, but the neighbor and another one made the flag, and uh, and it was sort of\nunbelievable to see uh that flag flying from my childhood home. I remember I thought of it like a\nspider, you know the swastika sort of reaching out to, to engulf us, and uh, was a horrible thing,\nsomething that was supposed to be for our protection was actually terribly ------------- particularly,\nyou know, to a young girl, and it all came so fast, it was all, within a day.",

        "Q: Well, not so much on the march, it was before we, we had particularly Liesl and I. Susie um,\nuh, Susie faced things much more, it was uh, it was Susie who said, \"We probably won't have a\nchance. They will kill us first.\" But, um, but Liesl and I uh, we had a wonderful game. You know,\nwe could play a game, and just uh fall into the game while, while we were still in camp and we\nworked on the night shift. At one stretch we worked for 9 months on the night shift, and um, I\nremember waking up and it was raining. We uh, the camp had over, had like a factory you know,\nuh, then the windows were on top, and you could hear the patter of the rain, and we must have both\nwoken up at the same time, and um, and she said, \"Oh it's a rainy day.\" And I said, \"Yeah, but I've\ngot to get up, you know, I have an appointment.\" And she said, \"I have an appt with the\ndressmaker.\" I said \"Yes,\" but she said \"I've got to go first out to the garden and pick up some\ngreen apples. They taste wonderful after the rain.\" And then she would say, \"You know, I, I need\na new raincoat, and I have to do this, and then I uh, and then my mother expects me to clean up my\nroom and you know, we would use the, the ordinary would suddenly became extraordinary, but we\ncould go on like this for hours, spinning the sort of tales which totally blocked out reality, and\nmade the, the horror around us, you know, would disappear. And um, I think it was those things\nwhich uh, which helped enormously, survival. Didn't know you, you dredged them up from some,\nsometimes from recesses of whatever of your, of your mind, and the other thing became the\nabnormal. We were right back there. We blocked everything else out and um, and then also was\nuh, uh, I mean, uh, there was some humor, there was some, there was laughter.",

        "Q: Uh, well, well, there were wonderful ways of cursing them for instance, one of which was he\nshould, he should become an onion, uh, was it an onion? Yeah I guess so, with, with the head, with\nthe head buried in the ground and uh, I, I don't remember some of these things. Oh, one of the\nfavorite things was we, we called them a lamp, and was a lamp because during the day, he should\nhang, and at night he should burn, uh things like that, was not, not particularly attractive, but um,\nwas one of those things, and uh, we mostly did caricatures of them. You know, of um, of what they\nlooked like and we, we give them certain names. Um, I don't recall some of the names anymore,\nbut imagine them in different settings and um, and we didn't think highly of them, to be sure. Uh,\nthe ones which, which were most, most threatening were, were the others like uh, uh Meister\nZimmer and so on, who had a different approach to it, you know, the one who regarded us as uh, as\ncomplete idiots, and uh, talked down to us as, as if we were we didn't know the most elementary\nthings. That was much easier to take, you know, because we looked down on them. Uh, the\nothers, who had much higher intellect, and who knew exactly where to where to hurt and what type\nof things to say, that was more difficult to take. But, by and large, I think we, we were able to do\nthat. And that would only become sort of as a support system, you know, one talked to the other\nabout it, you know, and, and say, you know, this, this idiot uh gave us some talking today, listen,\nlisten to that one, I mean, things like that. Um, it was pretty bitter, by and large, but um, but in a\nway we could laugh it away. And of course, you know, that constant um, uh, uh, radio broadcast,\nwhich was broadcast through the camp, which usually started with um, with a melody. We knew\nwhen that started, whenever it went, ------------------------: We are, we are going against England.\nAnd, following that uh, that little musical interlude always came and announcement of the\nincredible victories which they had won.

        "A: [remember it very vividly. As you well know, war broke out on, on the first of September uh,\nuh Germany said that they declared war. Of course, there was no declaration, they simply marched\nacross the border, and we lived very close from the Czechoslovakian border, Czechoslovakia\nalready having been occupied by Germany. But um, I uh, I remember it um, now, actually I was\nterribly busy, you know, first of all, my father had suffered a heart attack just a few weeks earlier,\nand was a great deal of uh concern and turmoil and all that, and this was our prime concern, and\nanother of course, um, school was going to start in another week or so, so you know I was getting\nready for school and talking to my friends, and um, n-not really truly being aware of uh, of what\nmight be happening, and that was the last week of August or so. Um, we really came face to face\nwith it on Friday morning, very early in the morning when people said to--there were lots of planes,\nwe, we heard a row of, of many planes, and um, when we went out to the street to see it, uh, the\nwings of the planes had the swastika on it, and that was the first ominous thing of sort of\nhelplessness and, and uh oh you know, this was above us, they could do almost anything, and uh,\nthat-----------------broke out. People started um, digging holes in the, in the yards and erecting uh\nbarricades, and my father was um, was upstairs in in the bedroom, and my mother cautioned\neveryone not to mention the war to him, and uh, didn't let him listen to the radio or anything, but I\nguess my father knew, obviously, what was going on. And uh, and it was a horrible night, uh,\nthere were lots of explosions and I remember being in my parents' bedroom with my, my mother\nand my brother and I, and this is when my uh father told me to go and call the family, and I\nremember...",
        "A: Am I talking too long?",
        "A: ---------------just started.\nBeep.",
        "A: Saturday was, was very, very quiet. As a matter of fact, I remember it just um, it still is one of\nthe most beautiful and probably the last peaceful day of my life. You realize I was only 15 at the\ntime, and um, I remember in the morning, we wanted to turn on the radio and there was no sound.\nThe electricity had been cut off, there was not telephone. Um, my father got up, he had been so ill\nbefore and was the first time I saw him dressed again. He suddenly looked very grey and very old,\nand when I look back now, I realize that he was only 4, 49 I guess. And, uh, I remember we were\nsitting at breakfast, was a beautiful, beautiful autumn day, very bright, very golden, flowers were\nbright outside, and we were all together, and it seems all activity outside has, has stopped as well,\nand um, it um, it was sort of a very, very special memorable day because it had no, no intrusion\nwhatsoever, and uh, and we were together, and uh, then in the evening, great deal of activity\nstarted. There was shooting, there were planes, uh there was some explosions. We went to the\nbasement. My cat was outside, and my brother went out to let the cat in, the cat was meowing, and\nhe came back with a hole in his trousers, and he said there was shooting from the rooftops, and the\nGermans were coming. I don't remember too much more of that night, but I remember in the\nmorning we came out from the basement, and we sat around the table, and my brother walked\ntowards the window, and, and then he sort of sat down, and at that moment, we had an incredible\nroar, and a motorcycle came down the street, and it had a -------- behind it, and there were people in\ndifferent uniforms, you know, our army, the Polish army had sort of uh beige, khaki uniforms, and\nthose uniforms were green. No, I'm sorry, um, actually what happened, we saw people walking\nwith flowers and cameras.",

        "A: Okay. Now we do have to reload.",
        "A: The war started in September. By, by Christmas we had to move to the basement of our home.\nIt was very cold and clammy. We, we had no, no running water, no electricity, and uh, things were\nreally quite bad, but we were still in our own home. Uh, and spring was very difficult because I\nalways loved my garden. I used to spend a lot of time there as a child, and the sign appeared there,\nthat dogs and Jews were not permitted to enter. Um, when we had orders to move to uh, Shabby??\na remote corner of our town, which became the ghetto, uh, I defied that order. I remember I, I said,\n\"I don't care what they're going to do.\" I had to see my garden again. Was a beautiful, fragrant\nspring morning, was in April, and uh, I remember I jumped over the fence, and went to the garden,\nand pretended that uh, that I was just, I was picking violets, and I pretended just for a little bit, what\nit would be like if uh, if the war hadn't happened, if I would be going in, my mother would say I, I\nneed to take my raincoat to school, and my brother would be hurrying off, my father would be\ngoing to his office, my mother would be setting the table for breakfast, and urging us to -----------,\nand uh, I remember it was sort of the most incredible thing that um, uh the reality which I had\nalways taken for granted, now became uh the most remote fantasy. I then, I think it stayed with me\nyou know, in a way, throughout all the years to, to return to that. Later, of course, it took on other\nforms of um, when I was in the camps, to imagining evening at home, but here I still was looking at\nmy childhood home, home, my parents were inside, my brother had been taken away, um, maybe\nsix weeks after the war started, he was taken away October 19th, and the war broke out the first of\nSeptember, but I was with my parents at home, I could, I could see from the garden, the room\nwhich had been mine, the wallpaper, um, even though we lived in the basement, I was still there,\nand, and yet um, I somehow must have been at least subconsciously aware that maybe I'm never\ncome back, so I'd never recognize it, you know, I, I lived throughout with this thing, I'm going to\ngo home, always, but uh, when I look back now over, over the many years, uh, and I, I still can\nvery vividly recall my feeling, it, uh, 1t was sort of a farewell to, to my life and to my childhood,\nand I was sixteen at that point.",
        "A: Well, you know, as much as I dreaded going to the ghetto, um, actually in some ways, it was a\nlittle easier for me because my friends were there, you know, I was not as isolated as I had been at\nhome, when we had curfew and I could see my friends only at a certain time, and it was dangerous\nto go out anyway, but still we were uh, I was closer to my friends, so um, that somewhat\ncompensated for, for the treatment so, so you know in, in, in every little room another tragedy\nplayed. Um, and then we had to work, um, and uh, in a nearby community called Badovitz, they\nhad the shops there, where they were sewing uniforms for, I guess for the army, and we were\nmarched, my, my mother and IJ and all, all went. Of course, you know, in the ghetto there were\nalmost no men, there were mostly women and children, older people. My father, uh, was one of\nthe few because he had had that heart attack and he was permitted to stay but he had to work in the,\nalso in the nearby little town to fortify the river, 1n a place called Suhar, and uh we were terribly\nworried every morning that might be daybreak, 4 or 5 0 clock that he'd left because he had a heart\ncondition, and we were afraid what that hard labor will, will do to him, and uh, my mother and I\nand some of my friends who few blessedly are still alive, um had to go to, to Baravitz to work 1n, in\nthat uh, shop sewing. We left in the morning and came back late at night and then the whole thing\nstarted again, and actually I uh, I, I think the discipline was, was pretty good, you know you are so\ntired, you worked so hard that uh you did not get too much time to reflect of, of what was\nhappening. At least for me it was, I'm sure it was much more difficult for my mother. And, and\nthen well, um, -----------------from 1939 uh till the worst day of my life, the 28th of June, 42. Um,\nthat is when I saw my father for the last time, the following day my mother. We were told to\nassemble. Uh, the day before um, we were, I uh, I heard my parents, of course, you know we all\nlived in one room, and I heard my parents talk through that night, and I still cannot comprehend\ntheir incredible bravery. They spoke only of, of their lives together, of their love, their good times,\ntheir children, their parents, and with that they faced the morning. I don't know, it sort of became\nuh, perhaps my own defense, I always felt, you know and thinks got-------------and volunteers???\nthat I had to emulate my parents. If they could do it, I can do it. And then I must, you know, never\ndisappoint them, I knew that that if they return and, and I thought, those things are, these, I thought\nwhen they return, I will never will say, you know, I will, I will show them that I um, that I'll come\nback, I'll do everything to come back to them because I remember how, how horrible it was for\nthem when my brother left. Blessedly they never knew that my brother did not return. But, you\nknow, that was the daily conversation, when Arthur comes back home and this and that. And I felt\nthat, you know, I owed it to them to, to stay alive, no matter what, and not give them the pain of\nthat loss. And however, you know we had, of course I always had a great --------------, so I was not\nparticularly religious, I had a great deal of respect for religion and books, and um, one of the things\nI wanted to do after I said goodbye to my father, I wanted to I, I knew what would happen in the\nghetto, you see my father was taken away on Sunday the 28th of June, and um, I asked a friend of\nmine to go with me and collect uh prayer books, you know, I, I was afraid when they'll find it,\nthey'll probably use it for toilet tissue or something like that. And we dragged, was a rainy day, and\nwe dragged those books out to little cemetery which was adjacent to the ghetto, and an old uh\ncemetery, we took the books there, we, we couldn't really bury them, but we sort of stashed them\non one of those where they were um, I, I guess were, were some cottons and things where\napparently I, I don't remember that too well, but I know that this is how we first tried to bury some\nof them, and that sort of, you know, if it's a decency of, of, of a burial. I would rather night recall\nthe night the last night which I spent with my mother which was a very bitter, and then 1n the\nmorning, you know, very, very early in the morning, uh, came the final moment. Uh, when they\nrushed through the ghetto with their whips and what have you. My poor mother, you know, my\nbrother left on a Monday, and he left it 3 years prior to that. And my mother fasted every Monday,\nsort of atoning, I don't know for what. Uh, probably begging God if she's going to fast that my\nbrother will return, and that was also on a Monday, and I, I remember I begged her to have\nsomething to eat and she wouldn't, but she had also uh, saved from before the war, a bit of cocoa,\nand uh, and some jam, and she decided to make that cocoa for me that morning. I remember it, she\nwas looking at that cocoa with great longing, we didn't have any throughout. But, it didn't taste\nparticularly sweet on that morning. We had to march through our town, and um, my...I guess it's a\nsort of a similar journey than a journey to execution when I think of it now because, you know,\nyou saw people looking out from behind curtains. Some waving sort of a mute farewell, uh, seeing\nuh somebody was painting a new sign on a shop. The movie was putting on a new feature on the\nmarquee, and uh, and we were marching. Ah. Was an SS man there that turned, that was near the\nrailroad tracks where the circus used to come, was sort of a an empty place, accommodating all\nkinds of things as a circus before, and now sort of a tragedy of ------------nature.",
        "A: Okay. I, I was with my mother, and a number of my friends, who were with their mothers, and\num, we heard that Marin was there. Um, Marin was um, a man of um, uh, if the stories to be\nbelieve of uh, not anyone to, to be greatly admired. Um, a man apparently of a little character,\nwhat have you, he was called an opportunist, and uh, this opportunity was presented to him that he\nuh was, was working with uh, with the government there. The story also had that he uh he had a\nchild, a little daughter whom apparently he adored, and that he would do anything in order to save\nthat child, and um, the Nazis apparently gave him that opportunity that if he would be helpful to\ninterpret or get people to come there, his child would be saved. That was the story, I don't know\nhow, how much truth that was in it. But I saw him, he was a, a very small sort of sour-looking man\nand it was, it was raining but it was oppressively hot because it was the end of June, and he was\nwearing a sleek raincoat, and uh, and then of course there were the Germans in uniforms, the Nazis,\nthe SS, he was standing to the side, we had to form a line, and an SS man stood there with um, with\na little stick and um, I was holding hands with my mother, I came up to him, and he says, \"How\nold?\" I said, \"18,\" and he sort of pushed me to one side and my mother to the other side. I, I wasn't\naware what was happening at that particular point, but shortly thereafter, when I stood with my\nother friends who were also separated from their mothers, we realized that we were going to go to\nseparate places. There was enclosure, an enclosure there, this barbed wire, to, to the right where\nour mothers were, and we were immediately taken to, to the left. Now again, I, I don't remember\nthe time sequence at all. I just remember a tremendous panic and uh, and shortly thereafter some\ntrucks arrived, uh, open trucks with, with sort of a gate behind it, and we were loading in the truck,\nand uh, I heard my mother\u2019s voice and I thought ask, \"Where to?\" and I shouted back, \"I don't\nknow.\" And, I guess I must have been aware that that I was taken away from my mother so I\njumped off, and Marin came, and he was very slight, small man, I didn't expect such strength in\nhim, and he picked me up bodily and he threw me on the truck and he says, \"You are too young to\ndie.\" And, uh, I guess, the trucks were set in motion, again, I tried, I don't remember the, the time\nsequence and uh, I just heard my mother's voice over the entire uh, over crying and everything, and\nit came like an echo and she was saying, you know, \"Be strong,\" you know, \"-------,\" in German.\nAnd then the trucks rolled out of there, and, ironically the, the sun came out sort of um, I still see it,\nthe rooftops looked wet, illuminated by the sun, and the church bells were ringing, and that was the\nlast view. We were taken to...were taken to a train, and of course, I was with my friends, and I\nthink we, we all started talking and facing the reality what was probably happening, and I\nremember rejecting it completely, thinking it cannot be, you know. Uh, they're going to be all\nright, and frankly, that kept me going all those years. They have to be all right. We went to\nSosnovitch, which was a transit camp. Uh, you see our part, it belonged to Austria before the first\nworld war. This is why we were German-speaking, this was quite early, this was 1942 and 42, and\num, and that transit camp, your names, your ages, and the places you hail from were registered. I\ncame from Berlitz, which was a well-known textile center, they called it the Manchester of Central\nEurope, and the people would come from all over Germany who were in need of labor. The men\nwere in the army, the women were given responsible positions, and they needed slave labor,\nhowever they needed people who could understand German and speak German. So, we were in a -\n---------------position. And a man came from Kramstamatnaphronic???, which was a very large\ntextile um center I guess, or maybe many factories, in Germany, and he bought us for that factory\nto be slaves, and, but, in that --------------, transit camp, I think I came face to face for the first time\nwith the concept of concentration camp, to which of course, slave labor concentration, we were\nbecause uh, shipments came with girls from the camps who were either named -------------, and that\nwas um, the last stop before Auschwitz, and I met those girls, and I remember my first contact was\nprobably the first evening when we when we stood, um, in line to get some food out of you know --\n--------aluminum bowls, you know, we used to feed our dogs out of bowls like that, and I didn't\nunderstand when that bowl was given to my hand, what to do with it. And then we stood in line,\nand I got some food, and uh, I remember putting a spoon in and scraping because there was sand in\nthe bottom, you know, and I saw this girl was you know, her hair was uh very short shorn hair, and\nshe had enormous eyes, she was emaciated, and she looked sort of hungry, and I asked if she\nwanted it, and she looked at me as if I gave her the greatest treasure, and she said, \"Yes,\" she said,\n\"Aren't you hungry,\" and I said, \"No,\" and she was sort of silhouetted against, uh, this fence, and\nshe sort of gave a benediction when, when she get it, and then she handed me an, an empty bowl\nand I, I didn't understand, and she said, \"You know, if I, we found with two bowls, I'll be beaten\nthat I stole it.\" She gave me that that bowl, and that was sort of the first impact of things to come. I\nuh was with a very close friend of mine, Ilsa, who was like a sister to me, we had grown up\ntogether, and a number of my other friends, and there I met people who became my best friend's\nfamily to each other, my friend Liesl, my friend, Susie. One was from Vienna, and the other one\nfrom Prague. We became very close friends, and we were sent to camp called Bolkoreim. And\num, strangely enough, on, on that ride from Sosnovitz from the transit camp to concentration camp,\num, there was a certain lightness which I remember , and uh, I can identify it now as um, the worst\nhas happened, and as, as tragic as it was to be separated from my parents, in a way it was um\nalmost you know, some of my fear left me there. You know, I was always afraid that I would see\nsomething, you know, and I once saw an SS man beat my father, and, I mean those were the most\nhorrible things. And to see my parents concern about me and their concern about each other. Now\nI knew that uh whatever would happen would happen to me, and uh, for some reason, I was really\nnot afraid any longer. When I was with young girls, we went together, and then it was, was almost\num something lighthearted that that happened there, and um, and I think that in itself um, I think it,\nit, it's much easier to bear whatever happens to you alone, not to watch someone you love, to, it's\nhappening to them, and also to see their, their concern and pain when it's inflicted on you. This is\nwhy I think perhaps it was so much more difficult for people uh that had to suffer together. And of\ncourse, youth, you know, also is uh, you know, is resilient, that, at that point I was 18, and uh, then\nof course, I was in the camps for 3 years.",
        "A: uh, we made an incredible bet on that train. That girl I met, was a, was a beautiful girl, her\nname was Susie Kuhns, and uh, Susie said that war is, how long, she said, to me, we stood at the\nwindow of the train, she said, \"How long do you think it's going to last?\" And I said, \"Oh, it will\nbe wonderful when we make the journey back. It's going to be probably less than a year,\" and she\nsaid, \"Ah, less than a year,\" she said, \"No, they'll kill us first,\" she said. \"It uh, it's going to be a\nlong, long time.\" And I said, \"Well, let's bet. Like make a bet,\" and she said, \"Okay, what shall we\nbet for?\" and she, she said, \"I love strawberries, field strawberries passionately and whipped\ncream.\" I said, \"Okay, then we'll bet for, for whole quarter of it,\" and we, we shook hands there,\nand made that bet. I lost the bet, but I didn't pay it. She died tragically on liberation morning. In\nCzechoslovakia. I don't know if she knew that we were free or not. I rather think she did not.",
        "A: I'm glad.\nChange film, camera roll 4 is up; Sync take 7.\nBeep.",
        "A: The camp, the camp we came to um was a small town called Bolknehein, I remember. We were\nmarched from the railroad station. People looked very curiously at us. Uh, we came to an\nenclosure, uh, adjacent to the factory, which had a couple, uh, uh, uh a barrack, and um, was a\ntremendous click as the gates closed, sort of a finality, and there stood a woman clad all in black,\nand she was literally barking. I have never heard a human voice being that harsh. She looked like\na bulldog, she, you know, and I said, \"This 1s, this is going to be absolutely the worst.\" We were\nsupposed to refer to her as uh Frau Kligler. She turned out to be the hope, the inspiration and the\nknowledge that perhaps not all Germans were cruel. She was a decent wonderful warm caring\nhuman being. No doubt she was picked for her position because of her looks, but the looks\ncompletely belied what was underneath it all. She was decent, she was good. We stayed in that\ncamp for a little over a year. No one was sent to Auschwitz. Uh, I don't know if she particularly\nloved us, but uh she pinned a lie to the lips of all those who said they had no choice. I personally\nam indebted to her for my own life at one point when this infamous Lindner, who was known for\nhis cruelty, should come to for an inspection of the camp, and I had been very ill at the time, I was\nrunning a very high fever, and I was permitted to stay in my bunk, and she came in with 2, no there\nwas 3 of us who were ill, and she came in she said, \"Girls, get yourself together.\" And I remember\nI couldn't put my, I had my skiing boots, and my father made me wear my skiing boots when I left\nhome, skiing boots in June, and I blessed him for it because I wore those boots for 3 years in every\nseason, and I remember she stooped down to tie my boots and she literally dragged me and the two\nother girl to the factory. She had worked in the factory before. And she set my looms in motion,\nand said, \"Pull yourself together. This is life or death today.\" And, uh, before we left Germany, ---\n--------the few of us who survived all left the positions that if Frau Kligler should be found, you\nknow she might have been arrested for, for being the head of a camp, where actually she was the\nperson who had saved many lives. And uh, she was sort of a bright light in this darkness.",
        "A: Oh sure. You know, I mean, look, she demanded certain things, I mean I don't want to give you\nthe impression that you know she was too--we worked very hard, you know we were, we were\ntaught to weave, and uh, the work was very difficult, and uh, you know, you had to be very swift\nand that because uh, the material which we were weaving, you know, was, was very poor. The\nthreads would break, and everything was interpreted as a sabotage. If you didn't work it like, uh\nskilled uh weavers would have 2 looms, we had 4 looms to watch. I mean, it was hard uh, uh\nbackbreaking labor, but uh, but we still had some food, I mean uh you know, you, you didn't, you,\nyou would consider it dreadful under normal circumstances, but of what was to follow later, I, I\nthink of that as a transition period you know from uh from home and from, from love and from\nnormalcy to, to the horror which followed, I, I think that uh that she made it bearable, you know.\nShe did not steal any of our food. We, we got the food uh you know. If somebody was ill, as I\nmentioned, I was at that particular time, she let you stay on the bunk, you know. She, she, she\nreally tried. She was a human being, and uh, and I think it was terribly important to meet a human\nbeing under those, those circumstances. You know, to a lot of people, I believe that um a\nconcentration camp seems like a snake pit where people step on each other for survival, they stole\nfrom each other. That wasn't the case at all. And again, I speak only about the camps in which I\nwas. And um, and I can say that I have seen the finest qualities of humanity there. The sharing and\nthe caring, and you know, if uh, whatever one had one shared with somebody else be it a crumb of\nbread, or if somebody had a birthday you know, and on Sunday we sometimes got margarine on\nour bread. We would scrape the margarine off on Sunday from several of the pieces to save it for\nthe person who had the birthday, to honor birthday, put some margarine on the bread, and, and\nthings like that. My closest friend, Ilsa of whom I speak so often once found a raspberry in the -----\n----, and she carried it in her pocket all day long, through a hot day, a raspberry, a total possession.\nAnd that night she reached out and through the barbed wire, and got a leaf and washed it, and she\npresented the ra-raspberry on a leaf. It was her total possession, and people did some wonderful\nthings there, and those are the things that I want to remember. You know, and we had very little\ntime, of course, you know, and most, most of the time we were very tired. Whatever free time we\nhad, but that was used if somebody remembered of seeing a, a particular film or ballet or\nsomething, it was shared, and you know, and an acted out, and um, oh there, there was an\nenormous support system there, and um, it, it that really was the, the other side to survival, that on\none hand we experienced extreme cruelty, and on the other hand, incredible love and friendship,\nand there was a balance there, and there was hope there, you know. And somehow you um, you\nknow, you saw of, of them, the Nazis like um, you know, I, I would fantasize to, to look like a\nsnake or this and that, I mean you didn't think of them as human, but you could identify the others\nas human being. I always thought of them as below my contempt, you know, and this is how you\ncould somehow take it. Sometimes, of course, you fell under the spell of it, you know, when they\nwould march you out and, and tell you that you'll be here all your life and this and that, and I\nalways said, you know, you can fall under that, you know, you have to imagine how uh, how they\nwill look dead and things like that, you know, and I was spinning fantasies, and, and that helped.\nNow again, you know, you, you have to be very young at that time or with a very vivid\nimagination, which fortunately I had so um, you know, I, I could sort of often lift myself out of that\nand imagine different things, and, and almost, almost anything could conjure this type of picture\nsometimes, you know the um, I remember you know working on the looms and we had overhead\nlights and the way um sometimes the light fell on the loom, I could remember that light coming\nthrough to my window in the morning when I was a child waking up, and then I could build a\nwhole picture around that and black out everything that was around me. And I lived sort of in, in a\nworld, you know, you could live on 2 levels, there's, there's no problem about that. And I guess\neven now I do live on two levels, you know, sometimes the other one comes up and makes it a little\nmore difficult when uh, when that intrudes, but most of the time you can, you can keep it down.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Well um, uh, when Christmas again it was under Frau Kigler's uh time, uh during Frau Kigler's\ntime, I think Christmas and New Ye--and um, Hannukah sort of fell together, and so we had to\nclean the factory. In those days we were allowed a hot shower after that was over and that was the\nbest shower I ever remember, it was hot because no, we, we didn't have hot showers, we were\npermitted to shower once a week cold shower, but this was a hot shower, sort of a special deal, and\nuh, we were going to put on a play because everybody else was busy and Frau Kigler, we did not\nworry with her very much about you know because we did throw some things in Polish and of\ncourse she didn't understand Polish, so that was okay. Uh, my friend Ilsa and I um staged a play,\nand others of course participated 1n it as well. Some people had wonderful singing voices and\ndanced, so we were going to have a performance, and um, this particular play dealt with 2\ngrandmothers. Ilsa and I were two grandmothers in that play. Um, we gathered some um stuff\nfrom under the looms and put it on our hair to make it grey, and we had found little pieces of wire,\nand made such granny glasses, and um, I wrote that play in, in the washroom at night, and the next\nday we performed it. We were sitting near the clearing between the bunks. There was a clearing\nthere, we had pushed the tables aside, and we were talking about the wars, the past, of course, you\nknow, predicting great futures for everyone, and um, I still remember uh, uh the words of the play.\nOne of my friends who as a matter of fact lives in Los Angeles reminded me of, of that particular\nthing, and then we had our two granddaughters come up and they listened to us for a while, you\nknow, sort of with a bored look, and they said, \"Oh, uh, come on let's talk about old boyfriends.\nYou know how old people exaggerate.\" And so we were 17 and 18 respectively at that particular\ntime. We somehow seemed to have hit upon the very core of existence. That someday we will live\nin a place where Jewish grandmothers will be allowed to live, and Jewish grandchildren will live,\nbut best of all, to live in a place where the climate will be such that our children and grandchildren\nwill not believe our tales of the past. The person who played my granddaughter in that play is\nalive; she's in Israel. She is the mother of one of Israel's most decorated heroes. Tragically, the\nperson who played IIlsa's granddaughter is not alive, just as Ilsa is not alive, and neither are the\nfaces that I remember looking at -----------. We performed it on the one naked, very d-------------\nwalk??? in the clearing between the bunks. And it's probably, in retrospect, one of the most\nrewarding moments of my life, I have been able to make them forget, even for an hour.",
        "A: Um, well, I've got to get back to Boltonhein because uh, because the menorah that happened...\nBeep.",
        "A: Um, during the time when we uh, did the play, we also fashioned a menorah out of our evening\nmeal of potatoes. We cut it very carefully, and uh, we had sort of a dilemma. Should we try to\nfind, of course we had no candles, but then we thought even if we had candles, that it would be\nmore symbolic to sort of light the flame of hope within us, without seeing it and that will be the\nunseen things, and uh, and we uh sang so, a song, about Hannukah, but we reworked it, you know,\nto, to a modern then version of this new hopeful menorah and of, of the defiance of, of the\nMacabees??? and uh the little bit of oil, which lasted for 7 days when it was supposed to last only\none night, so you know, we applied it to us, and we, we felt very, very strongly about that. Um, we\nalso did some other things like uh, Yom Kippur when, when we were admonished it, not depressed,\nand not to deliver the prescribed quota of material. Everyone fasted even though we knew that uh\nthe dire consequences if you did not do it, which was difficult even under most normal\ncircumstances. Um, and uh, we were given noodles and sugar at some point. Nobody ate it. And,\num, there was a feeling of of oh of almost holiness and tranquility, um, um, you know it, it, it was a\nvery important victory within you. Yes, you can do it, and that was a victory over, over them, over\nthe Nazis. We could do it within ourselves, and uh, we did a number of, of ,of uh, of things like\nthat. Um, I remember when they were particularly vicious. Not Frau Kigler, but the ones, you\nknow, that were coming in to, to give us the pep talks. There was particularly one Meister Zimmer,\nwhom I absolutely detested, and he was totally bored. He was very intelligent, and uh, spoke\nmarvelously well, I mean, he had almost an hypnotic voice, and he would say that if we stayed all\nour lives, we would learn a decency and things, and he, he just drove me crazy with this type of\nthing because decency was the thing that that I felt my parents lived by and to, to hear 1t mouthed\nby him, it became an ugly thing, and I remember what, what I us---uh, as soon as I was starting to\nfall under his spell, I imagined his ears were sort of protruding a bit, and I imagined how he would\nlook dead, and how worms would come out of his ears, and I remember once I must have smiled to\nmyself because he said to me, \"What, what are you smiling about?\" I didn't know I was smiling.\nSo, um you ,you could take certain things and turn it around, and feel that in your mind, you had a\ncertain victory over the things that that they were saying, and I thought to myself, \"Mmm, sure, he\nwill die long before I will, and I will do such and such,\" and um, it was probably very childish, but\nI think it worked. It sometimes could work very, very well. You could lift yourself above what\nwas there. I remember in one of my ---------------- very much later, um, that I was busy on the\ndeath march, you know, on, on...",
        "A: No, I should leave that one out because that.",
        "A: No, because I have this one particular thing that, should I do it later? Sorry, you'll probably cut\nit.",
        "A: Okay. We didn't get anything to eat for days, literally. We were bitter cold and hungry and\neverything and um, I was planning a party after the war, and I had the dilemma for almost an entire\nday if I should have a blue velvet dress or a red velvet dress. Couldn't resolve it. I really liked the\ncolor blue much better as a color, but I knew that red looked better on me, so uh, well, you could\noccupy your mind and hang your thoughts on trivia of that nature. It became very important, and\nthis is how you passed the hours and forgot the hunger and, and the cold. And I uh, I do believe\nthat if you were blessed with imagination that that you could work that. Um, if unfortunately you\nwere a person that faced reality, I think you didn't have much of a chance. I felt I was lucky\nbecause I never faced reality. I still don't. Uh, but when we went, um, when we had to leave\nBoltonheim, which was very hard. We, we left for another camp because we did not have enough\nuh, raw material to, to do any weaving. Um, Boltonheim had a sort of a sister uh factory called, uh,\nthere were several, one of Landeshut, and one was Medsdorf, and so and we were send to\nMedsdorf. Medsdorf was a horrible camp by comparison with Boltonheim. First of all we were\nhoused in, in a bldg maybe on the 6th or 7th or 8th floor, way up and it was terribly hot there, it\nwas middle of the summer. And of course the windows were nailed down, I mean, we were\nliterally broiling there, and the people in charge there were in complete contrast to what we knew\nabout Frau Kigler. There was a Lager Feuhrer in there, who was perhaps 18 or 19 years old, the\nmost vulgar-looking thing. Uh, she was wearing rings on every finger, and then sometimes 2 or 3\nrings on each finger, and she had short stubby red hands, and her enjoyment was to, she had a little\ncart, like children right around, and she would sit in that cart with a little whip, and we had to um\npull her. That was her, her joy, I mean, the mentality of that person was, was not to be believed.\nAnd then there was another person there, who was in charge of us, and she had been um, a guard in\none of the female um jails, and we sometimes had, and the work that we did, um, people who\nwere, who committed some, some sort of misdemeanor or what have you, in jail, came to spend a\nday working with us. And that was our normal work. Um, we worked at different jobs there. Um,\none of the jobs, which was uh dreadful. There were several that were bad. One was to um hand a\nbricks one to another, and we were to throw the brick and, and catch it quickly. If you didn't, it\nlanded on your hands, and uh, it crushed your fingers. The other job was to go in a nearby swamp\nbecause they were growing linen there, and in the swamp, you had to put um, uh, the li--the not\nfinished linen, the thing that had grown into the swamp to because then it opened, uh, the enclosure\nin which the threads, the lin--, the linen was--I don't know if I'm explaining it right--that was\nbackbreaking labor. You had to stand in the swamp doing that, and that's was swarming with\nmosquitoes, and then other thing that we did is uh load into a silo, an enormous silo, I don't know\nhow many stories high, um, a man with a crane was throwing down bundles, and we were standing\non that, and you know the bundles uh, came crashing down, and you had to arrange them, and you\ncould easily be swallowed up in that, first of all, you were swaying all the time, and uh, and then\nthey came so fast that if you didn't catch it fast enough, it hit you and it pricked your skin, and then,\nthen your skin was bleeding, and then you were in the swamp, and the mosquitoes were eating in it.\nIt was a horrible time, and it was there in that silo where some of the women came from jails who\nhad committed murder or God knows what, as punishment for a day, and they said they preferred\nsolitary anytime than to work there. Um, it was there as a matter of fact where I uh, really felt I\nwas going to give up. There was one overseer who uh was particularly cruel to me, and he had\nsingled me out for uh for this type of punishment. So, during the day, I was working with flax or\nuh ----------the bundles. At night we had to shovel coal. And wagons, uh you know, came loaded\nwith coal, we had to shovel it because tracks had to be cleared, and it was going on day and night.\nOnce we saw the trains going by we didn\u2019t\u2019 know if there were trains with uh with German soldiers\ngoing back, and people said there were trains of people we sent to Auschwitz. And um, and I\nremember my resistance really weakening there, and I thought to myself once after the um, the cold\ncar was empty and I was with that, standing on that, with that shovel in my hand, and I, I said it\nwould be so easy now to jump. An oncoming train, and it would be over in, in a couple seconds,\nand become a part of that stillness like we have to face tomorrow. It's, it's going to be tomorrow.\nIt's going to be flax in the morning and, and the bundles at night, and, and the swamp again, and the\nhunger, and that I, I, I just felt I had enough. And I, I resisted that, and then, another day came by\nand the next night it uh, and I remember too, you know, I had promised my father, there was one\nthing I was never going to, to do 1s, is to really give up. It was sort of a, but, but there I came very\nclose to doing it, and I remember that one night, when I definitely saw that it was a beautiful\nmoonlit night, and I said to myself, \"It's time to do it.\" And I heard very faint oncoming of a train,\nvery far away probably. And suddenly I felt a pain in my both sides of my, my neck, very sharp,\nand um, it was right in the beginning of the war when we not heard from my brother and my\nmother was sick, and we were told that we had to leave with 20 lbs of our belongings. Our home.\nAnd I remember standing there, and we heard of a family who committed suicide together, and I\nsort of half-wished that my parents had suggested that. I was also very close to my father, and I\nremember I stood there, and was thinking about that. My father must have guessed my thoughts\nbecause he came up to me, stood behind me and he said, \"What you are thinking 1s, 1s cowardly\nand is wrong.\" And he said, \"Promise me that you are never going to do it.\" I didn't answer him.\nAnd he took my head, as he stood behind me and he turned me back forcefully toward him.\nBeep.",
        "A: Uh, very early in the war while we were still at home, as a matter of fact, we were still living in,\nin our own quarters. It was shortly after my brother was taken away. And my, my mother was\nreally gone to pieces. She was quite ill. And my father had the recurring, recurring thing with his\nheart. And we got orders to leave our home with 20 pounds of our belongings, and my father told\nme to sort of pack suitcases, I had no idea how to do that. And I, we had heard of a family who\ncommitted suicide together, and uh I, I really thought at that point that that, that would be good, to\ndo that, and I had hoped that my parents would suggest that. And I remember standing at the\nwindow, and thinking about that. And my father came up behind me, and uh he, he always knew\nwhat I was thinking and he, he said to me, \"What what you were thinking is, is wrong. It's\ncowardly, it's, it's terrible. He said, \"You promise me never to do that no matter what.\" And I\ndidn't answer him, and then he, he sort of took me, he took my head, like that, and he turned it\ntoward me, toward him, and he looked at me, and he said, \"I want your promise now. And I said,\n\"Papa I promise.\" And uh, during those last days in Medsdorf, that promise became pretty faint. I,\nI, I was, I was exhausted, you know, I don't know how, uh anymore, how many days and nights I, I\nwas working in that heat, in, in the swamp, and uh, and the cold, and the just everything --------\ntogether, and I, I, I really wanted to, to end it. And at that precise moment when I really most\ndecided it, I mean, I don't know if I would have carried it through or not, but I have a feeling that I\nthat I was pretty much at the, at the end of my rope there. And I knew that the train was going to\ncome, and I figured, I, I'm going to jump. Suddenly I felt that very sharp pain in my neck. And the\npromise came back, and obviously I didn't. Strange thing is, the following day, everything\nchanged. The following as we were working in the swamp, um, that overseer, that that fury came\nrunning and had a list in her hand, and asked the people who had the following numbers to come\nforward. And I, I, I think my mind must have been so muddled, I wasn't even thinking, um, and\nIlsa's number was called, she was working with me. See, Ilsa was not working nights, uh, at that\nwas sort of directed more against me or, or a few other people, and he called Ilsa's number, and\nnobody rai-raised their hands, and she said, \"Well who has that number?\" And Ilsa took my hand\nand she said, \"She did.\" I wasn't even aware of what she was doing. She obviously was\nsubstituting her number for mine. She wanted to save me from something. And I was led away,\nand Ilsa jumped out of -------, and she also started running, and as we came to the courtyard of the\ncamp, there stood the director of the factory of Boltonheim, and uh, Ilsa literally threw herself at, at\nhis feet, and she said, \"I want to go with my sister.\" So he said, \"What is your number?\" Then she\ngave her correct number and mine, and he said, \"Well you both are on the list.\" So he said, \"You\nrun and wash up you, you look like pigs,\" uh, and actually what was happening is they needed\nmore people for weaving and he came to collect from this particular camp, which was not a\nweaving factory, to an adjacent one called Landeshoot, which was also under the auspices of\nBoltonheim, and uh, again we were loaded on a truck, and I couldn't wait for the gates to open, to\nget out of that, I, I didn't know how to thank Ilsa for it, but I remember that I, I just said to her, \"I'm\nglad I didn't jump.\" And she said, \"What did you say?\" And I said, \"I'll tell you someday.\" I never\ntold her.",
        "A: Um, I, I can only surmise um I, I was cleaning some, some small component in the camp and,\nand he came up--he, he wasn't a lager fuehrer, he was, he was um, sort of a supervisor there. And\nhe said to me, \"Um how, how would you like some hot soup or some bread?\" You know, which\nwas sort of, I said, well, I said to myself, \"Why is he saying that to me?\" If he wanted to help me,\nwhy doesn't he give me a piece of bread?\" You know. So, I sort of said, uh, \"Well, I eat in camp,\"\nwhich I felt, you know, was, was stating the truth without accusing them that they're not giving us\nenough to eat, but, but not saying anything, and so I uh, I gathered that he had maybe a certain\ndesigns on me, or maybe just wanting to test me, I don't know, you know, they were, well, that,\nincidentally, in our camp was not much of a problem. There were a lot, uh, there were very few\nmen around working in the camps, were mostly old, and there were a lot of young pretty German\ngirls there, so that was, that was not a problem. I, I don't know. In any event, I think, just the type\nof defiance that I showed, uh he decided to sort of break my spirit, maybe out of sport or, or just to\nshow his ------------, and this is what I was picked for. For every type of, of hard work. But um, I\nthink it's a terribly important lesson. One should never ever, ever give up. No matter how difficult\na thing is you know, uh, giving up 1s a final solution to a temporary problem. Our problem wasn't\nso temporary. Nevertheless, it would pass, but one was keenly aware of the preciousness of life,\nand to hold on to it as long as possible, and to me, this was really the most important thing, and I\nwould say that during that entire time that I was in the camp, was a little, I mean, except for the\nbeginning of the war when I really did not know, and only heard that the family had chosen that\npath together. This was the only incident that I remember, through all the years, that I really came\nclose to calling it quits. That's why I love to say to young people, never ever, ever give up. The\ndarker the night, the brighter the dawn, and it sure was bright. And it sure was dark.",
        "A: My 18th birthday was literally a few weeks, my birthday is May 8th, and on the 29th, 28th and\n29th of January, the 29th I left, I was separated from my mother on the 28th and my father, it was\nabout 5 weeks before, so that was my last birthday. And uh, my mother decided to have a party.\nShe invited a number of my friends and she somehow had gotten some oatmeal, and baked some\ncookies, which we all swore tasted marvelously well, like almonds, and um, my parents gave me an\nincredible present. They gave me an orange. I've always loved oranges. And of course, then an\norange in the ghetto was, was impossible. I later learned that my mother had given a very treasured\nand very valuable ring for that orange, and that was the last present I got from my parents.",
        "A: My brother was almost two and a half years older than I, and he uh, he was really my hero. My\nbrother was very good looking, and people used to say, uh, my mother was a very beautiful\nwoman. People used to say, \"It's a shame she has such a beautiful mother, and that she looks like\nher father, but the boy looks so much like the mother.\" So you know, I always sort of grew up in\nthe shadow of my brother, who was extremely good-looking and very accomplished, and\neverything he touched he seemed to be able to do well, and we fought at times, but by and large, he\nwas a wonderful brother. He always protected me, and uh, and of course, he had his friends\ncoming to the house, and there were boys around you know, and I, I started to get interested in\nboys. And a lot of my friends were seeking my friendship because of my brother. And um, the\nfirst day when the Nazis came in there, rounded up people they would find, and put them in the\ntemple, and set the temple on fire, that was really the first, the first deed, the first horror which was\ninflicted upon the citizens of the town. And it was shortly before my brother was taken away when\nhe had to go to register at uh what was like the community center, which was not too far from the\ntemple. The temple had been destroyed. Of course. And I went with my brother. I don't\nremember if it was now on the way to where to register, or on the way back, I rather think it was on\nthe way back. We passed by the temple, and we climbed over the debris, and we were sitting there\ntalking, and was sort of he, he talked to me very seriously. You know, usually he, he talked down\nto me a bit, but it was more like an equal, and uh, it was one uh, pillar of the temple that stood on\nall the destruction, and he said to me, \"Look at that one.\" He said, \"It survived. We are going to\nsurvive. They can't do it to us.\" And then, he picked up a couple of little stones, which were\ncharred, and he put one in his pocket and he gave me one, and he said, \"I want you to carry it with\nyou all the time, to remind you of, of this. Of the temple and our conversation.\" And I, I carried it\nwith me, but uh, later on, on that death march, I must have lost 1t someplace, I carried it in a little\nsack. I had sewn a little sack, and I, I carried it on, on my neck with a string. I, I lost it.",
        "A: Where do I start?",
        "A: I don't remember where I finished at.",
        "A: Sort of getting a little... Well...three years in the camp became progressively worse as um, raw\nmaterial was running out, and also as uh it seemed that the war was taking a different turn. We sort\nof knew that if Germany should be victorious, our doom is going to be sealed. But if, for what we\nprayed for that, that we would be liberated, we were afraid that when things start turning uh bad for\nthem, they are going to let uh their, their venom and their frustrations out on us, so that was really a\nno win situation. It became pretty obvious in the winter of 1944 as it turned to 45, when um, uh\nthere were fr-a frequent um we heard planes coming in and, and uh, uh production stopped, and\nthings were, were getting bad, and then on the night of the 28th, rather the day of the 28th of\nJanuary, 45, we did not go to work. Was a workday, and we did not go to work. We were told to\nstay incamp. And toward evening we heard an enormous commotion, and uh, a transport of 2000\ngirls came from Auschwitz, mostly Hungarian girls. They told us they had been marching, that um,\nAuschwitz, uh the Russian front had moved closer, Auschwitz was being liberated, and they were\nrunning away from the advancing Russian army. And uh, we, we were going to join that march the\nnext morning. Was bitter cold. Was in January. And I was coughing terribly, I had a very bad\ncold. And my 3 dearest friends, Susie Kuhns, Lizzy Schteburn, Ilsa Klein Zeller and I, we hurried\ntogether the four of us, and they, they were very concerned about me, they said, \"You know, if you\ncan only pull through with that terrible cold and the terrible cough,\" like the pneumonia or what\nhave you. And in the morning, very early, the doors opened, not to the type of freedom we had\nhoped, but it opened to an, an incredible picture. There was freshly fallen snow for as far as the eye\ncould see. And an enormous sort of it was a plateau, and then it came up to, to a gentle hill, and it\nwas just, just covered with snow. It was grey, it was snowing, and uh we were told to uh assemble\nfor a -----------, so of course, there was the four of us, and uh we held hands, and we took the first\nstep, and I guess we all knew that this was going to be the first step to the end of the road. Either to\nliberation or to, to doom. And in front of us stretched this incredible line. Well, people looked you\nknow with, with grey uh camp blankets over them, and they looked like winged death. That's all\nyou could see. Way, way ahead, four thousand girls. And on the side were the SS men and the SS\nwomen, and they lifted their whips and they said, \"Forward march.\" And we started to march.\nStarted to march, it was the 29th of January. And we, we left a lot of girls back in the snow. And\nthey were killed. That was something one can barely, can really not describe. My father had asked\nme when I last saw him in June the very last day, practically in the last moment, before he left, he\nsaid to me, \"Where are your skiing boots?\" I said, \"Why?\" And he said, \"I want you to wear them\ntoday.\" I said, \"Papa, skiing shoes in June?\" He said, \"I want you to wear them.\" One didn't argue\nwith one's father. So I put on those boots and I wore them throughout my entire stay in the camps\nfor 3 years, and in them I'd also hidden the pictures of my parents and my brother. I didn't know,\nand I don't know how my father could have known that those boots were really instrumental in\nsaving my life on that march. I had ski shoes. Some girls had sandals. We slept outside. The\nfrost, I saw girls breaking off their toes like twigs. And I had my ski boots. On the 29th of April,\nrather I should say on the 28th, Ilsa wasn't well at all. She was sort of hallucinating. She was\nsaying things which, I didn't know what she meant. And uh, when we stopped for the night, if a lot\nof girls, they put ---------, the girls who had died, I dragged away from there, and I, and she didn't\nseem to know what was going on. But then she became totally lucid, and one of the most shocking\nthings was that one of my other friends had somehow found two potatoes. And she gave them to\nme, she said, \"It's for you and for Ilsa.\" I gave Ilsa the potato and she said she wasn't hungry.\nThat's the most incredible statement, not to be hungry. And she said to me, \"You eat it.\" And then\nshe said, she said, \"I'm angry at no one. I hope nobody is angry at me.\" And then she said, \"If my\nparents and kitty, kitty, was her little sister,\" she said, \"If they survive, don't tell them how I died.\"\nAnd she said to me, \"You'll be alone.\" She said, \"But you have always been lucky.\" And I begged\nher not to say it, but she did. And she said she wanted some water, and there was a little brook\nnearby, so [| --------, and I wanted to, to get it, and an SS man came, and he shoved me, and I\nbegged him to let me have water for her, and he kicked her head. So, it was raining and sort of, so I\ncaught some water in my hands and gave it to her, and I held her, and we both fell asleep. I woke\nup, and she didn't.",

Some, some better the others, you know, some people were never\npart of it, and said, you know, \"You are crazy, you're insane,\" but we did it mostly Liesl and I.

        "A: It was on the way from um the transit camp in Sosnovitz to the first camp in Boltonheim when\nwe were on the train, and uh, this is actually where I met Susie. She introduced herself, she was a\ntall, very pretty girl, with auburn hair, and two freckles on her nose, very open uh face, and um, she\nintroduced herself as Susie Kuhns, she had come from Vienna. Her mother had died when she was\na baby. Her grandmother lived in, in Czechoslovakia, and uh she spent a great deal of her life in\nthe care of her grandmother, where she was when the war started, in the fall, and um, uh, I said\nsomething to the effect, \"Wouldn't it be wonderful when we make that journey back.\" And she\nsaid, \"We'll never make that journey back,\" and I said, \"Of course we will.\" Uh, she said, \"That\nwar will drag on forever,\" and I said, \"That war is going to be over in less than a year.\" So, well,\nshe said, um, something to the effect, \"You are either very stupid or very hopeful.\" Something like\nthat. So, I said, \"Let's make a bet then.\" And she said, \"okay.\" So we made a bet for a quart of\nwhole?? strawberries, were little,-------, they were called, and uh, and whipped cream. I lost the\nbet. I never paid the debt. Because Ilsa died on liberation morning. I found her dead. I didn't\nknow if she knew that we were free or not. She was an incredible girl.",

        "A: Unfortunately they both did. What did you want me to say now.",
        "A: I didn't. Not until you just mentioned it.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well this was the very last phase of the war when we were on this death march, which started on\nthe 29th of January in Greenberg, in Silesia. We sort of, our, our destination actually was\nOranenburg, Oranenburg was a murder camp near Berlin. Oranenburg fell into the hands of the\nRussians, and we were zig-zagging through Germany, ending in Czechoslovakia in a tiny place\ncalled ------------, where the march came to a halt. Um, Ilsa had died just a week before. It was\nevening, and um, one of the SS women came by and she mentioned to one of my friends to take my\nboots off, which sort of signaled you know the last thing. My friend, her name was Hanna\nKudlidsky, Hanna Keller in those days, told me that, and she said, \"Hide. Don't let her see you.\"\nAnd um, a truck came, and she said to me, \"You know, you better get on that truck so she shouldn't\nsee you.\" And I said, \"You know I'm, I'm in no hurry.\" And I remember sitting there and, and\nreally knowing that this was definitely the end. Heard American planes overhead, there was\nshooting, and the the German army was running away, there were people on the roads with\nchildren with animals, tremendous chaos, and uh, I was sitting there and it, 1t was really a beautiful\nnight, it was May, it suddenly got a little warmer, and uh, and I permitted myself the luxury of\nthinking of home, of my parents of my, my brother in a different sense. I always thought of home,\nbut um, but somehow this was different. The truck didn't come back for us, and they came, and\nthere was this enormous factory, we were sort of in front of it, and they it was in the they locked the\ndoors, and was told that they planted a time bomb to, to blow us up--won't fall into the hands of\nwhoever were coming. We didn't know if it would be the Russians or the Americans or what. I uh,\nI must have been pretty sick during that night. I um, uh, only isolated things which, which I\nremember, when I remember that we, we tried to break out of there, and we couldn't, the doors\nwere really locked and, and chains were put around it and everything. And uh, it started to rain.\nTorrential rain, which obviously somehow um, the bomb and -------- did not connect. And then we\nare told that they're coming back. I remember crawling in into one of those long um chimney, a\ncylinder that was on the floor, and a few of us crawled in there, and there was some shooting, I\nremember a bullet went by, and then it was quiet again, and then the doors, must have been the\nfollowing morning, the doors were opened, the Czech people called and said the war was over. Uh,\nI, I didn't understand the reality of, of that at all. My , uh, then there were some Americans that\nnight before, but my two um impact of...of freedom and of it being over actually must have\nhappened that following morning. I do know that the SS had run away, and they had changed their\nuniforms into civilian clothes. I did find um one of those great coats, from the army, and I\nwrapped, wrapped myself in it and, and tried to sleep on the floor. I must have been quite feverish,\nI was already I think quite ill, and it was the following morning that it, I, as I said we met the\nAmericans the night before, but I think, but all that some-somehow sinks into oblivion. My, my\nvery clear um, view of ,of freedom and liberation came that morning when I stood in this doorway\nof that abandoned factory. And I saw a car coming around the hill. And the reality of that came\nwhen I saw the white star on its hood and not the swastika. There were two men in that car. One\njumped out, came running toward me and asked if there was anyone who spoke English or\nGerman. I told him I spoke German. I remember that aura of him, of that awe, of, of disbelief, in\ndaylight to really see someone who fought for our freedom, for my ideals, and uh, he looked like,\nlike God to me. And I uh, I knew what I had to say, and I said to him, \"We are Jewish, you know.\"\nFor a very long time, at least to me it seemed very long, he didn't answer me, and then his own\nvoice betrayed his emotion, he was wearing dark glasses I couldn't see his eyes, he said, \"So am I.\"\nAnd the impact of that to be liberated not only by an American, but by a fellow Jew, um, it, it, it\njust, so totally uh, I mean, um, I think this is when that that feeling of such an incredible joy which\nfills your, your whole, whole being. It, it, it must have, just burst out, I, I, I remember I couldn't get\na hold of myself then. But then he said, asked a strange question. He said, \"May I see the other\nladies?\" A form of address we hadn't heard for six years.\" I told him that most of the girls were\ninside and were too ill to walk. He said to me, \"Won't you come with me.\" I didn't know what he\nmeant. So he, he held the door open for me and let me proceed in. And that was the moment of\nrestoration of, of humanity of humaneness, dignity and freedom. And this first young American of\nliberation day is now my husband. He opened not only the door for me, but the door to my life and\nmy future. I took him to see my friends, but I was very sad because that morning I went to look for\nSusie, because Lies] said to me, \"Susie went out to get some water, and she has not returned.\" So I\nwent out to look for her, and I found her near the pond. I thought she had fainted, and I touched\nher, and she was cold. I wanted to tell her, \"Susie,\" and I did tell her, I said, \"Susie, we are\nliberated, we are free.\" We had made a bet more than three years earlier on a train which took us to\ncamp. A bet for a quart of strawberries and cream to be payable after the war. I said we will be\nliberated, and she said we would not. I didn't tell Liesl. I couldn't tell her. Liesl was very sick.\nWe all were very sick, we were immediately taken to a field hospital in --------- before a school\nhouse. We were very, very ill. I weighed 68 pounds. My hair was white, so I was going to be 21\nthe following day. I was told that Lies] had trouble with her legs. She had uh been injured, uh, she\nhad been shot in the leg. And I asked to see her, and was told that I was too sick to, to go there and\ncouldn't walk. I kept asking and asking, and I sort of collapsed for quite a while. And finally I was\ntold that she had died. Of the four of us, I was alone. I was the one that had the cold and they were\nall concerned about me that I would not make it, and I was the only one who, who survived. The\nonly one from my family, the only one of my dearest friends.",
        "A: About 4,000 when we started. 2,000 from our camp. 2,000 that came from Auschwitz. When\nthey were on the way, there were certain divisions, we had stopped in other camps, and a few of the\ngirls had had run away, most of them who had run away, uh were caught and executed. A few\nhowever managed to escape, and uh,-----------------. I'm, I'm not sure of the exact number. Uh,\nwhen we were in the hospital, we were about 120 of this entire transport. Of those, quite a few still\ndied. There is now a cemetery in Volari, Czechoslovaki where we were liberated. There were 95\nor 96, 96 graves, but 95 of our girls were -------------------------. I thought I made liberation such a\nhappy story and I find it didn't turn out that way.\nChange film, camera roll 10 1s up; Sync take 15.\nBeep.",
        "A: Now? Looking back now over almost half a century, it is half a century, um, I think one is\nstruck by the nobility of the spirit which also lived in this darkness. The act of kindness, the type\nof support, the selflessness and the love, which I think was the support system to be able to endure\nthat. A belief in something. Not, uh the inhumanity of, of our um captors, but, but the humanity\nwhich existed in the victims. And there was a great deal of that. My friend Ilsa, who gave me that\nraspberry, she carried it in her pocket all day long on a hot incredible day, and derived joy of giving\nit to me. Um, the one time when we uh stood roll call for, for a long time, and a piece of bread\nsailed over the barbed wire into our group and one of the girls caught it, and we all knew whence it\ncame and who had it. And we were all questioned, we were all beaten, no one gave the person\naway. If someone which became much more difficult later when we were not with Mrs. Kigler any\nanymore, who had showed such humanity, but later on when really cruelty and bestiality was the\nreign, um, one helped the other. You know, if somebody couldn't work or was sick, you know, we,\nwe all tried to, to help the other person, to pull them through. Um, and, and that was taken\nabsolutely for granted. Now I don't mean to say that that everyone there was, was angelic. I mean\nuh, we were human, but by and large, and this is why, you know, when I wrote my first book, to me\nit was the most important thing to be able to put on that it 1s all based on truth, I used all names, all\nplaces, and I whatever I have written, I always use my maiden name as well as my married name. I\nwant anyone to challenge the truth of that statement. Unfortunately so few stories you know\nsurvived. Um, so little has been said about that, you know because the overwhelming thing there\nof course was uh, was so horrible, and, and when one tries to um, to explain the holocaust, it uh, it\nis a horror which um, which has the upper hand because such horror has, has never, uh, never been\ndone to, to, to people with so, that somehow what seems to escape are the little acts of kindness, the\neveryday thing, which, which really spurred the spark of hope that one had to have in order just to\ngo on. And that was the, and I don't know of anyone who committed suicide. The camp was\nsurrounded by barbed wire, which was electrically charged. Not one person that I know of ever\nwent and touched it. So we certainly had enough reason to, to do it quickly. No one did.\nEveryone wanted to live with, with every fiber of one's being, and I think that was a defiance.\nThey wanted us dead, but we are going to live for as long as we possibly can. And we did, and this\nis why it is so sad, that when one sees pictures of concentration camp, one sees those big vacant\neyes over the barbed wire, people who look more like animals than as human beings and no one\nseems to know what was going on uh in the minds and hearts of the people, that they were looking\nat something beautiful. I remember one time, a, a bird flew into camp, and it perched itself on a\nbunk and started to sing. No, no one ever had a more appreciative audience than that bird did, and\nhow, how we watched its flight then to freedom over, over the barbed wire and ov-ov-over the\ncamp, and one time in Greenberg, uh, where we also stood for hours roll call. Uh, one spring, in\nthe corner of this courtyard, the among the debris of the cement, a flower poked its head, and you\ncould see hundreds of feet shuffling around it, nobody stepped on the flower. It was something\nincredible to see uh that a flower heralded sort of a new spring of, of, of ----------of beauty. Now,\nyou know, one should not need uh stay in a concentration camp to appreciation of, of beauty, but,\nbut it was an incredible moment to see that, that many things that one sees for granted. Um, there\nwere beautiful things there. Unfortunately, and that is always the biggest pain, that so few lived to\nknow the joy of freedom, and that is the most painful thing. And sometimes the difficulty to, to\nenjoy all the things, to know how many were deprived of it. That's, that's the hardest thing. But I\nthink if one can somehow give the legacy of the nobility to the inheritance of this new spring and\nnew generation of children and grandchildren, who have grown up in freedom. If they can\nunderstand it and, and value it, then, they have achieved a sort of immortality. I think this is really\nwhy they have to understand something, because it is difficult. You know, millions, numbers have\nno meaning. It's the identification is one that counts, and if, if someone somehow today, and\npeople who live in freedom can take the identity of just one who was deprived of it at all, and live\ntheir lives vicariously, and enjoy the things for which, which they have so hungered, I think that uh,\nthat we will build a better world. And I have hopes for the world in spite of everything.\n"
