        "Q: I need you to start off by telling me your name, where you were born, and when you were\nborn.",
        "A: Okay. My name is Adam Beer. I born in a city called Nitokislavski Nicholage (ph), which is\nSlovakia, before it was, of course, part of Czechoslovakia. And I was born February 25,\n1922.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your town.",
        "A: It\u2019s a very small town, lying very nicely, geographically, under the Tetra (ph) Mountains. In\nother words, when I was young, for instance, you could go ski, you have a\nalready on top of the mountains there. It was a very quiet life. Not much excitement. Typical\nsmall city in the Slovakia. And this lasted until about 1938. Then trouble started.",
        "Q: What about the Jewish community there.",
        "A: There was not a big community. We had about 300 families. So maybe, total, 1t was 400\npeople. It was a community, which I think you can compare here to conservative.\nThere were not -- there were maybe only two or three Orthodox people. There was the rabbi,\nthe shamis (ph), and the contors (ph), the cousin. Otherwise, people were . Most\nstores were -- good stores were closed, but they made business on the site. For instance, you\ncould go Saturday, shopping, but the front, see, was closed. So you just went through the\nside door. So, it was really cheating, but that\u2019s how it worked. We had very beautiful temples\nthere in our hometown. We had, we made our own matzos (ph) during the Passover time,\nright on the school place. We had a Jewish school, Jewish grammar school, which I attended\nfrom the age of six until I was Temple, four years. Culturally, we had good cultural\nprograms. We had theater, which played. We had, Sundays, we had outing in the group.\nThere was a large Macarby (ph) group. The Zionist movement was pretty active there. So it\nwas a really very nice little community.",
        "Q: Did you mix much with the Christian population?",
        "A: Yes, we did because at that time, I had very good Christian friends, because mostly after I\nleft the grammar school, I went to the Gymnasium, which takes eight years. So you go from\n19 -- I graduated 1940 from Gymnasium. And there, I met most of my friends. We had very\ngood relationships. We were very close. We went together, we had fun together. And there\nwas no animosity. That all ended, of course, when Slovakia became independent and the\nsituation changed around. But until that time, no problem.",
        "Q: And your family business?",
        "A: My father was -- had an electrical store. He was a master electrician for many years. He was\nvery well known and he was very busy. He took care of the leather factories, took care of\nthem. Always they should be functioning. And we weren\u2019t rich people, but we had -- made a\nnice living. We also lived in a home, actually, it\u2019s two homes there. And we lived in, and\nnext door to our house was another house that we rented out. The chief of Zhandamarie (ph)\nwas our tenant there. Then, a dental technician was a tenant. And a grocery store was right\nthere. And my father was pretty entrepreneurish. For instance, he built garages for cars to\npark overnight. And we also, in the house, there was a , from the cigarette\npeople who sell cigarettes. So it was a busy place. And that was where I brought up.",
        "Q: Did you have brothers or sisters?",
        "A: Yes. I had a older sister, two years older than I am. She was born 1919. Her name was\nGabriella, or Ella, short. And I have four years younger brother, name is Otto. My sister, of\ncourse, died in the war. And my brother is still living in my hometown in Nicholage (ph),\nSlovakia.",
        "Q: One other question about this period. You mentioned that there were Zionist Youth\nmovements. Were you involved in these political organizations?",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t really political, but they sports organizations. We had outings, we had\nexercises. It wasn\u2019t -- for instance, the was on the agenda, but at this time, I was,\nyou know, not really interested in that because we had a pretty good life there and we never\ndreamed about a time that 1t would come. So, it was more a cultural and sport organization\nthan political organization.",
        "Q: Now, prior to 1939, what did you know about Hitler and Nazis and Germany?",
        "A: Well, we knew enough. We had a radio, of course. The radio at that time was still pretty\nnew, but we had a radio. And I remember very clearly as we were listening -- my mother\nwas still living at that time -- I think it was in April of \u201834 where the president of Austria was\nshot. His name was Schuslig (ph), I think. I remember that and we were quite shocked\nbecause there was already a from Hitler\u2019s party because he wanted to\nAustria and so, it wasn\u2019t good for -- 1t was how they killed him. And the new president\n. So, we knew about Crystal Nacht (ph), in 1938, we heard that over the radio. And\nit bothered us, but still, nobody comprehend, nobody could foresee that would happen. We\nwere pretty edgy about it, but we still took the attitude, Slovakia 1s a free, beautiful,\ndemocratic country and we didn\u2019t worry much about it. I\u2019m afraid so, in 1939, before\nSlovakia Republic was born, March 14 in \u201839, my father got papers to Bolivia, to immigrate.\nIt was official and he could have given the paper right away. But my grandmother was still\nliving , and my mother was already dead, and we didn\u2019t see that we could go away\nand leave her behind. So we figured, we\u2019ll ditch these papers to go to Bolivia. And we\nstayed. And I was still in high school. As I say, I finished -- the last year the Jews could\ngraduate from high school, from gymnasium. It was on June 6, 1940. Of course, I always\nwanted to be a doctor and I wanted to go to medical school, but I was cut out. No Jew could\nenter medical school. So, what to do, then? I was 18 years old. So, I went to work for my\nfather in his electrical undertaking and I learned electrical work. And I was, it seemed, from\n19 -- to the end of the war -- 1945. Although in 1944, we already went to the mountains to\nescape, but we will come to it. But I was working, helping out, and I learned the trade. And\nabout the business. Soon, the Slovak regime started. My father had to give up the business\nand he had to be political party zealot (ph). An Audian (ph) person, had to take over. He was\nthe boss. He took the money. And just give certain amount of income to my father to live on.\nThat was from 19 -- if I remember, it may be from 1941 or so to end of the war. So my father\nwas employed, I was employed, but we stayed home. We did not go. Now, my sister, she\nwas a seamstress. She was very good at it. And she worked for a Slovak company at a job.\nBy 1942, came an order, actually, a letter given to the Jewish families, which said that all\ngirls from age, I know it was from 16 or 18, unmarried women, should report in the Jewish\nschool, I think, if I remember right, either five or ten kilograms of supply and they would be\ntaken to a working place. So all the girls from, not all the girls, there were some exceptions,\nbut many of the girls came. They had about two weeks notice. But at that time, you didn\u2019t\nknow yet what was happening, so nobody felt nothing bad about it. They came there and\nstayed overnight in the yard. And the next day, they were taken by train to the city of Poprat\n(ph), which is about 40 kilometers east, and from there, on to Auschwitz. Now, we didn\u2019t\nknow nothing. We knew nothing about Auschwitz at that time. Now, there were some\nparents who were a little bit smarter than we were. And when they got the notice, they send\ntheir daughters to hospital for appendectomy, whether they needed it or not, and they saved\ntheir lives. As a matter of fact, my classmate, girlfriend, who saved her life, lives here in\nCleveland. She\u2019s married here to an American boy. But my father,we tried to talk, I must\nsay, my sister was very good friend with a girl who was a, she was a girlfriend of the chief of\nthe . was an organization which cooperated, of course, with Hitler, and\nwhich took care of all the Jewish problems. And my father went to this -- to help this girl to\nbeg that they shouldn\u2019t take my sister. But they did not worry about it -- just didn\u2019t want to\ntalk to my father about it. And that was our goal -- that was our biggest mistake that we\nmade because they left of March 27, 1942, from my hometown, Nicholage (ph). And on\nApril the 2nd, the train took them from the city of Poprat (ph) to Auschwitz. We never heard\nof her anymore. And we found out that in May or June, they were already liquidated\n. So as I said, that was our biggest tragedy in the family. But we stayed on. And the\ntragedy was also that two weeks after she was deported, my father got so-called\neconomic exemption. That means that father, my stepmother, I and my brother, we didn\u2019t\neven have to wear the , the Star. We didn\u2019t have to wear it. We could travel, but\nthe condition was we needed to be home by 6:00 at night. We couldn\u2019t go to a movie. We\ncouldn\u2019t have a watch, we couldn\u2019t have a radio. If the family had a radio, it was a big\npunishment for that. And actually, we worked, and my father worked, uninterrupted, until\nthe uprising took in Slovakia, which was August 29, 1944. The uprising took place in a city\ncalled , which was maybe 50 or 60 kilometers away from my hometown. There\nwere some politicists, landing down (ph), some from Russia, some from the\nbrigade. They picked out a few men and they were coming towards my hometown with\ntanks and quite a few army people. In our town, there was a German station of about 10 or\n12 men who managed a telegraph station for . This partisan and the army came to\na place, that was 1n a hotel. They surprised these men. They shot them all. . It was\nthe president of -- for their interruptions. The front didn\u2019t have any more\nconnections to our home town. Because we knew that if something had happened, that there\nwould be murder. I mean, everybody would be killed because there was, you know, the\nGermans might (ph) kill them. So, we didn\u2019t know, of course, at least, something bad had\nhappened, but we were preparing ourselves for bad times, to leave our town and go to the\nmountains, because Nicholage (ph), my home town lies right on the top of a mountain. So,\nabout a year before, we found a carpenter who was not a sympathizer with the Nazis. He was\na communist. And he built us a bunker in the mountains, about three kilometers from our\ntown. Please ask me if you have a question.",
        "Q: Yeah. Actually, I don\u2019t wan to -- I want to go back a little bit before we talk about this.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: I\u2019m curious what happened between 1938 and 1942. That\u2019s a big chunk of time, considering\nwhat was happening in Europe. So, what was happening in your town?",
        "A: Well, first of all, on October 6th, 1938, they took Slovakia and was divided in Bohemia,\nMoravia and Slovakia. Slovakia became autonomous. That means, the president was still the\npresident of both countries, but autonomy , but they still went to Slovakia. Then,\nas I say, from October 6th to March 14, 1939, when Slovakia, under the , it will\nbecome independent state, that was completely bought from Bohemia and Moravia. It\nbecame Slovenkis Shtat (ph), Slovak State. The president of our country became a Dr.\nJoseph Tiso, who was a Catholic priest and he, as a minister/president, he had person called\nDr. Voitisch Toka (ph), who was a lawyer, but also, they were all Nazis, what we call\nsympathizers with the Nazis. And from that moment on, from March 14th, the rules and\nregulations came out, restricting. They said you couldn\u2019t be on the street at night. You\ncouldn\u2019t have a radio. You couldn\u2019t have watches. You had to give up any gold or any jewel\nyou had. You\u2019d get a piece of paper that -- to get the things out. But you liberty was\nrestricted. You had to be home in time. You couldn\u2019t own anything. You could [not] have\nyour own business. You\u2019re either to work for somebody or you were just out of business.\nThat was in 1939. But there was a as I started school, until the first deportation\ntook place from town, and that was in 1941 for certain people who were claimed to be\ncommunists were at night -- police came at night, took these people away, and they were\nnever seen since -- never came back. That was in \u201841. My father -- we still had to\nat the time, yet. But because he was an electrician, they needed him, so they let him work.\nHe was under the control of the men who are in the ground. But we could work. But every\nday, some new regulations came that were tougher and tougher and tougher, until the time\ncame when, of course, people started to be deported. Not political, but deported to so-called\nwork. \u201cYou will go to work. You will help the government to survive. And you\u2019ll be fed.\nAnd you'll even get -- everything will be fine.\u201d Did I say that time when my sister was taken\nin \u201842?",
        "Q: You said \u201842. Was there any German presence? Or everything was controlled by the\nSlovakian government?",
        "A: There was Slovakian government, but there were German offices in the capital city of\nSlovakia, which is Bratislava. There was a person, a German person called , who\nwas the ambassador there. And of course, he gave the instructions what should be done. But\nlocally, there were some Nazi party Youth organizations, such as Euchre (ph), but officially,\neverything was controlled by the Slovak. But the hundred or so were German.",
        "Q: So you were never officially occupied.",
        "A: No, Slovakia wasn\u2019t occupied, no. Bohemia and Moravia was. But Slovakia wasn\u2019t because\nthey become allies with , and therefore, they became so-called independent, but of\ncourse, they had to do as they were told.",
        "Q: The other question is, you had a lot of Christian and Catholic friends, I assume, before this\ntook place.",
        "A: You're right. Yeah.",
        "Q: What happened to those friends afterwards?",
        "A: Interesting, as I said. A very good friend whose father was a chief of the hospital in the town\nand, as soon as was born -- and he was not Catholic, he was Protestant, he was\nLutheran -- I see him on the street one day and he had this bright uniform on. He has a\ndouble cross, not , but the double cross of Slovaks. And I told him, you know, he\nacted like (ph) he didn\u2019t see me anymore. So I knew that something was happening here. The\nuniform, you know, at that -- and, , see he was a , How are you. Very,\nvery good friend. He has a Jewish girlfriend, as a matter of fact, before this was all started.\nAnd it lasted, maybe, for about six months. Then took the youth from us, never to be out\nagain. And more of us started to be against the Slovak regime. See, he was ;\nnot Protestant. But it didn\u2019t really seem that it\u2019s another way to go and to give everything.\nBut maturity -- maturity cultivated very well. On the street, for instance, you would want to\nmeet them. Or they would want to meet you, then say Hello to you. They tried to show you\nthat, \u201cLook, I know who you are and everything, but, please, don\u2019t contact me.\u201d And that\u2019s\nhow it was.",
        "Q: Your father continued to do business with...",
        "A: Yeah, but I think, not on his own. He had a supervisor. He was working and the money went\nto the boss and he was just paid a salary. I mean, a salary just to survive. But he was doing\nthe business, yes.",
        "Q: Now, were you afraid? I mean, were there beatings, arrests, like there were 1n other\ncountries?",
        "A: There were arrests, as I said, from some of the men, who were thought of as communists.\nThey were beaten and taken away and never came back .. .\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: What did we just say?",
        "A: I was talking about how other people , any my father was still in business. Yeah.",
        "Q: No, I was asking you about the arrests and the beatings.",
        "A: Yeah. There were some, but really, the bad things started in 1941, and mostly in *42. That\nwas when the mass deportation took place, and the whole family was just -- they\ndisappeared. I remember, for instance, the cousin of the Schuller (ph), the colonel, his five\nchildren, I remember like today, they were taking him -- the police escort. And it was a very\nsad thing to see. And we stayed because we had the exemption. But all these people were\ngone. All the stores were out of the Jewish hens (ph) already at the time. As I say, it was all\nunder different management. And the life became tougher every day. There was a\nrationing of food. I know that we didn\u2019t have everything that we wanted, but because my\nfather was so long in business and he went to villages, to electrify the city, you know, to start\nputting electricity in the villages at that time. So, many times, he brought butter in or some\nmeat or something. So, we are not starving really. But food was very, very hard to get.",
        "Q: Do you remember your family talking about the situation and what you thought was going to\nhappen?",
        "A: You talking before my sister went or after? Before, I say, we didn\u2019t know it was going to be.\nWe knew that if we honestly would go to work, it will be living. But, as soon as the transport\nwent -- as I say, it was April 2nd, 1942 -- and we knew it was going to Auschwitz. And we\nheard a few weeks after that, we knew already there was a liquidation. But what could we\ndo? We couldn\u2019t escape at the time, because there was no passport, nothing you could get,\nno place. You were stuck where you were. But we tried to prepare for the inevitable, to build\nsomething that we could escape, if bad comes, and hopefully, to save our lives. And I think\nin 1943, I had a friend whose parents were farmers. And couldn\u2019t go to school, so\nhe worked for his father. And they had two horses and a big buggy. And little by little, the\nmaterial to build the bunker on Sundays, we shipped to the top of the mountain where we\nbuilt the bunker. And somehow, people didn\u2019t notice too much. You know, why are they\nbeing gone? But anyway, it was several times, delivered wood, and it was\nprobably needed. And his name, he was a carpenter, built a bunker, which I have said was\nvery wonderfully equipped. We had bunk beds -- Oh, I didn\u2019t tell you, we were four families\ntogether, four families together, which, of course, put the money together to build this\nbunker. We were all friends. There were two couples -- husband and wife, husband and wife,\nhusband and wife and a son, and my father and my stepmother and my brother and I,\nbecause my sister was gone. So four families. This bunker, it was pretty comfortably built.\nWe had, for instance, our own radio so we could communicate with the . But how we\ndid it, we brought in a bicycle and we put a through it, a dynamo on the\nbicycle. And running the wheels of the bicycle, we created electricity and we were able to\nlisten to BBC. So we knew what\u2019s going on. And it was all lasting very nicely from the day\nwhen the partisans came to town -- like I said, 1t was August 29, 1944 -- until we are\nliberated. How .. . I know, you want me to continue with this story now? Or do you have\nsome other questions?",
        "Q: Well, I\u2019ve got a lot to cover before we get to liberation.",
        "A: Please do.",
        "Q: What else did you have in the bunker?",
        "A: Supplies? For instance, we had -- yeah, we prepared all the supplies in canned food.\nEverything was canned. But we hid (ph) them next to the bunker, we built a big hole in the\nground and put it all in. So we had a supply for several months to live on. And\nand we are to go. It was fine. There was -- in the top of the mountain, in the little -- not the\nvalley, but there was some . So the bunker was in this . And we were able to\nlook down into the valley. So I say, except maybe the linen -- so we brought it out when we\nescaped -- but the food, everything was prepared for us to go in and start a new life. That\nwas, again, in \u201843. And we survived. Meanwhile, deportation took place almost every day.\nMore and more people were removed. For instance, there were two doctors there. And they\nneeded doctors that were still left (ph) there. But in \u201844, those families were deported, and of\ncourse, never heard of them.",
        "Q: There were regular deportations after your sister\u2019s.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Yes. Deportation took place from \u201842 to \u201844.",
        "Q: Was there a pattern? I mean, who did they take first or...",
        "A: First, the people, I think, they didn\u2019t need them so much. But the doctors, the electricals left\nin 1944 because we needed -- there were not enough doctors to go around. But then, the\nhospital took over and these two families were deported. Older folks, for instance, who were\nnot working anymore, who were not contributing to the economy, they were taken away.\nAnd everybody who left never returned. Nobody returned from out of town. We had\npresident of the Jewish organization there who was supposed to cooperate with this party,\nthe party. Whom to select -- it was very tough thing for a Jewish guy -- he was a\nlawyer, an attorney -- Dr. Weinmann (ph) was his name. And he had to decide whom he was\ngoing to send out. And you know, that creates very bad blood because Why me? But that\u2019s\nhow it happened. He survived the war himself. And he lived a very quiet life that got\n. I want to tell you. We knew that we might have to escape from the house. But our\nhouse where we were living was maybe 200 years old. The walls of the house were maybe\none meter thick from stone. The meters (ph) were very small. Not only were they small, but\nthey were -- they had little bars in it. So you know, if they come in the night to get you, the\ndoors were closed, the windows were . So, I told my father, \u201c\u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s\nremove these bars.\u201d\u2019 Which we did. We removed the bars so in case, maybe, we could\nescape. We had a big back yard there and -- we never had to do it,so, but I said we are\nprepared for that. We were -- 1t was harder and harder -- our insecurity was getting bigger\nand bigger because we didn\u2019t know when the time would come for us, although my father\nstill was the exception. But that could have been revoked any minute. Then it happened. We\nare working, and I remember very clearly, I was helping in the house, making the electrical\nwork in the house. And this August 9th, \u201844, I hear machine gun fire. And -- because the\ntown was very quiet until this time. In the meantime -- so we jumped up from the house,\n\u2018\u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d \u201cOh, freedom, freedom! The \u2019s here. Liberation 1s\ncoming.\u201d Well, we were very happy to hear that. And, as I said before, this killed\nhis 12 German soldiers there and arrested a few of the collaborators, maybe even shot them,\nI don\u2019t know. They were in the jail (ph), but I\u2019m sure there was some killing going on there.\nBut we knew this end of it, and, as I say, we said, \u201cNow it\u2019s time to leave.\u201d",
        "Q: How much did you know about the partisans?",
        "A: We knew because, well, my town was mostly Protestants, so we were a little bit against the\nregime. And there were some people were coming in with information about going on and\nmaybe even trying to get some people to join the partisans in the mountains -- because that\nwas our adventure (ph). We went around mountains all around the city. So they were coming\n-- because at that time they weren\u2019t in uniforms, they were in plain clothes. And, though we\nknew what was going on and we knew the time would come that -- we hoped that the\nrevolution would take place in the , because there was a -- the people parachuted\n(ph) from Russia and took *s army. And I understand there were even some\nAmericans who were shot down over Slovakia, and they returned. , but I was\ntold that. So, there was accumulation (ph) to get out of there and come to Liberlin (ph)\nSlovakia. So we had some information about them. And of course, Jews, if there were\nanybody around, were welcome to join the partisans. Now, my father still has to work, I had\nto work, so in the , we Stayed there. But the day came, August 29th.",
        "Q: So, did you know there was going to be this uprising?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t know, but again, it was in August of \u201844. The German are losing the war\n. So, we knew something would happen, but we -- this came as a surprise to us.\nWe were surprised. We didn\u2019t know what to -- we knew the end would come, only we didn\u2019t\nknow when. And we tried to prepare ourselves good as we could. As I say, we fixed the\nhouse (ph) so we could escape and so on. But it was a surprise.",
        "Q: Now, one other question before we go to the mountains. You mentioned this lawyer who\nwas the head of the Jewish committee. Was there a whole structure in place with a Jewish\nCouncil (ph) or...",
        "A: I don\u2019t think there was, really. He was a head. He was there, but I don\u2019t think there were any\nother people who were involved. But he was selected by the Slovak (ph) government, \u201cYou\nwill represent the Jews,\u201d just like in Russia ghettos, he\u2019s like the unirat (ph). So he was the\nunirat (ph), one person. And, for instance, like I said, he had a niece. The niece was working\nfor my father as a secretary or as a clerk in our business. She was a single girl, but never\nmarried. She was supposed to be the puppet (ph). He knew that this would take place for her,\nand suddenly, she disappeared. So, he saved her life. He didn\u2019t tell everybody else about the\n. So, he didn\u2019t have the best reputation. But, it was his kid, and a special life. But\notherwise, only purposes, he sent out letters to the Jewish families (ph) who were still there,\n\u201cvou must know to do this, you must stay home at six, you couldn\u2019t go to the street,\u201d other\nrestrictions went through there, to give out information. And the temple, which as I said was\na very beautiful temple, was used as a warehouse or something. there was no more services\ngoing on. So, it was very, very restricted.",
        "Q: By the time you left, were there many Jews left in the town?",
        "A: Do you mean for America?",
        "Q: When you left for the mountains.",
        "A: Very few. Very few. Only the ones who were exceptions. Very few. Because by that time,\nthe deportation took everybody. So only very few. I don\u2019t remember how many, but just\nvery, very minimal amount.",
        "Q: Anything else you remember about that period and what was happening in the town, what\nyou saw, before we move on?",
        "A: In my town?",
        "Q: Yeah, prior to \u201844.",
        "A: Before \u201844?",
        "Q: Anything you saw or heard?",
        "A: We were quite isolated, as I say. We couldn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t get much contact with the non-\nJewish people. They didn\u2019t want to talk to us, they were afraid. We didn\u2019t read much. We\nwere living from day to day. If we survived one day, we were ahead. Because, as I said, we\ndidn\u2019t know whether, at the time, if at night somebody would come and get us. For instance -\n- this is an example I\u2019Il tell you -- a friend of mine, who went with me to school, couldn\u2019t\ncontinue up through gymnasium, so he went to learn the electric trade, worked for my father.\nHis parents had a small grocery store. And they were also prepared, somehow, to save\nthemselves. And one night, they came after them. And they were able to escape in the back\nyard. And the , who came to get them, he knew very well this family. He could\nhave -- he could have said, \u201cLook, they\u2019re gone already.\u201d But no. He called them. They were\ndeported. And never came back. Why I say this, after the war, my friend came back. Then,\none day to the station and said, \u201cI want the report.\u201d And the same who\nhis friends, and let them not escape, took their information. He said, \u201cI want to\ndeclare against you.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d That day when my parents tried to escape, you know, you\n, and you let them -- and you are . To his grandchildren, nothing\nhappened. Nothing. I know it was a travesty, but nothing happened. (ph) People -- there were\nturncoats and -- after -- as soon as the liberation, he became very good to the Slovak. I know.",
        "Q: How much time is left on this tape?",
        "Q: About another five minutes.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me about the day you and your father and brother decided to go. It was time to\nleave.",
        "A: That day. Let\u2019s see. I was working with him that time, that day. And about noontime, he\nhears this machine gun fire and shooting and so on. And we run out of the house and people\nare saying, \u201cOh, it\u2019s freedom. Liberation.\u201d People kaput (ph), you know. And we had seen\nsome tanks come in. and many uniforms and jubilation and so on. And we\nheard about this German soldier being killed there, so we knew right away that at that time\nwe needed to go away. And it was very smart because the next day, the German army was in\nthe city of about 43 people from east of my hometown called . They came down\nto the town from , and any men who were on the street to go to --\nas a punishment for the death of these 12 soldiers. And it was very grim. But we didn\u2019t wait\nfor that. As I say, the same day, we run out there. The family was prepared. And we were,\nlet\u2019s see, 14 or 16 people in the bunker. And from then on...",
        "Q: How did you get there?",
        "A: By foot. By foot. We go through this village. See, there was no way to get there, I mean, you\ncouldn\u2019t get a taxi. I don\u2019t remember if 1t was the same night we went. I think it was the\nnight, probably, because, you know, . Because he had to take almost nothing\nwith us. Everything was there already. And we were there and overlooked now (ph) our\nhouse. And we had, I think, a good life, but a quiet life from the day -- from August 29th in\n\u201844 to December 15th, 1944.",
        "Q: Now, how did you spend your days in this bunker? How did you continue to get food?",
        "A: The food, remember, we had our supply there. But we must co-exist.",
        "Q: Okay, so, ready?",
        "A: So we are in the bunker already. And you asked me how did you spend the time. We had to\ncut wood to build fire. Fire wasn\u2019t very good thing because the fumes from the fire would go\nstraight up to heaven, you know, and anybody who was down in the valley could see there\nwas some fire there, so there must be some people there, but there was no way out. But it\nwas still August, it was still summer. It was fine. But then, September, October, November,\nDecember. Big snow fell down. It was in the mountains (ph). And we had to eat. Otherwise\nwe would from freezing. The food we still had there, but we also got an enemy\ninside there. We got lice. Washing -- there was no water there close by. There was no river\nno this -- so we had to -- I don\u2019t remember how we got them out of there. I do remember\nwashing was not a strongest point at that time, but we tried to keep it neat as we could. But\nwe got lice. And I remember, every morning, there was a time when we had to get our lice\nand clean ourselves. And it became tougher and tougher because sickness could -- we could\nhave caught sickness from that. But we made it through. But on -- about two months after we\nwere there, I don\u2019t remember the time any more, we got a surprise. Four -- I think there were\nfour or six peasants found our bunker. Came there, said, \u201cYou are Jews? You hiding here?\u201d\n\u201cYes, we are.\u201d \u201cYou have to share your bunker with us.\u201d\u2019 Now, we were 14 or 16 people\nthere. Not much room, but of course, we had to share with them. And with them was captain\n-- I remember his name, Captain Novotney (ph) was his name in Slovak. Everybody nice,\ndecent human being. And we had accommodation. We had to -- instead of one person on the\nbunker, we slept two people in the bunker and we made room for them. Both these guys had\nweapons, automatic weapons, and they were going around, they were going out, seeing\nbridges and so on (ph). And my father was very good man, but very naive man. He was so\ngrateful to these people that he told this Captain Novotney (ph), \u201cCaptain, if you should need\nany food, we have some food here. Please help yourself.\u201d And he showed them where the\nfood was. So, one day, when we went out to get our food and we see the hole there.\nEverything was taken out, no food. it really was a shock, you know. There is no food now.\nAnd it was getting winter, October, November. What to do now? So, we went down to the\nvillage. As I said, we were three young men there. And we -- one time, I went some of the\nothers so we trade so nobody come . We came to the village and told them we had\nmoney and we need some food, give us food. And we pay for it. And the people said to me,\n\u201cWe will not give you food, but if the Germans find out that we gave food, then they will kill\nus, because you\u2019re enemy.\u201d So I said, \u201cLook, either they will kill you or we will kill\nyou (we had a gun with us).\u201d And they gave us the food, we paid them, and we brought it up.\nBut winter was rougher and rougher because smoke in there. And I remember one day, my\nfriend went up, and coming back, he almost froze to death. He told me a story that he had\nsome pins and he pricked himself in the fingers so he shouldn\u2019t fall asleep, on the way up.\nHe just died about two years ago. He lived in Bohemia. He was doctor. But it was tougher\nand tougher. But on December 15th, which was a full winter -- oh, I must say this. We had,\nas I said, we were on top of the mountains, and we had a beautiful view of the valley. And\nwe had a very good German-size binoculars. So I and he, we are watching guns and what is\nhappening (ph). One day, we notice big mass, big mass of moving people there -- this is we\nare looking down in the valley. Now, we couldn\u2019t see whether they\u2019re partisans, whether\nthey\u2019re Russians, whether they\u2019re Germans, was it the , we didn\u2019t know. But we\nsaw we had to make some change in our life. Not far -- maybe 50 yards or less from our\nbunker -- was a cave. So, early in the morning, before the sun came out -- early, early in the\nmorning -- we took our rug and, you know, with us, and went to sleep in the cave because\nwe were afraid that these men might be the enemies and they would find the bunker and kill\nus. And we did this probably a few days. I don\u2019t remember how long. But it paid off on\nDecember 15th. In the meantime, we are in the cave. The house (ph) is empty. But the\npartisans stayed there. Because they had weapons, they stayed there. So we hear big fire --\nmachine gun fire -- which lasted maybe half an hour or so. and of course, being snow, we\ncould see the foot marks of the soldiers of these people. The foot marks had come there and\nthat\u2019s the end of it. But they never came. At night, we came to our bunker from the cave. The\nbunker was completely burned to the ground. And two bodies lying there, from the partisans.\nIt surprised us that the partisans were the two that were killed.",
        "Q: The ones you knew -- the partisans you knew.",
        "A: Yeah. The partisans which were with us, yes. But two were dead. I remember, they had the\nnice boots were taken off. And I remember one guy had a finger cut off because he had\nsome, probably some ring or something. And was completely burned with gasoline down. So\nwe had no bunker. We had only the cave.",
        "Q: Before you continue, I have a couple of questions about your life in the bunker. Did you stay\nin during the daytime? Or could you come up for air?",
        "A: Oh, yes. We could come out. Because remember, it was all forest. All mountains around,\ntrees. Very high up. So we could go up, yeah.",
        "Q: And you had your own weapons?",
        "A: We had one Luger. Nothing else. One Luger we had. And I don\u2019t know whether we had six\n-- we are not big shooters, you know. But I bought the Luger in my hometown\nfrom somebody. I thought if they would catch me, I would shoot myself because I didn\u2019t\nwant to fall in German hands. It was for committing suicide because I didn\u2019t want to go\n. And that\u2019s all we had.",
        "Q: How often did somebody have to go down and buy food?",
        "A: Oh, I figured, at least once a week. Maybe twice a week. But dare I say, we did it as a group.\nBecause it was risky, because if the German patrol catches us, of course, it\u2019s they\nfind us, we are partisans, the partisans are shot. There\u2019s no prisoners taken. So, that was\ngood. But after we had no bunker, and only the cave, we around our place, and we\ndiscovered another bunker, which we didn\u2019t know before, not too far from us. A Jewish\nfamily, whom we knew were from my hometown. The name was Mr. Stein (ph). I remember\nvery well. So we came there and we told them we had just been out. Would you please help\nus . And I\u2019Il never forget this. This old man came out. And he brought out an\nempty sardine can. And he told my father, how\u2019s this, \u201cSee this sardine can? How many\nsardines can you put in it? There is only so much room for sardines.\u201d But he wanted to say\nthere\u2019s no room for -- because he didn\u2019t let us in. We left and started to build a new bunker.\nWe had no material to do it, but we cut down trees and made a very, very primitive\nbunker. The walls was the trees. We used some rugs on top of it. And we lived\nthere from December 15th -- not December 15th, because we , but from end of\nDecember to April 7th when we were liberated.",
        "Q: Okay. Let me ask you a question. Did you have particular responsibilities? Or did\neverybody. . .",
        "A: I guess so. Except -- yeah, to go down to the food, you know, for the food. Because,\nremember, all these people are much older. So they stayed. There were women who were old\nand sick and so on. So, that was our job, the young folks, to go get the food. And to cut the\nwood and to make fire and things like that.",
        "Q: So there were women and children with you also.",
        "A: No small children. We were -- I was -- in \u201844, I was 22. My brother was 18. The other friend\nof mine, Dr. Brown, he was five years older than I am. The other boy was two years older\nthan I am. So, the youngest would be my brother was the youngest. The rest were much\nolder.",
        "Q: But there were women also?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Now, I said, my stepmother, Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Gordner (ph), Mrs. Pollock (ph),\nand one bachelor from western Slovakia who was in our hometown, and he joined our group.\nSo there was one single man. The rest were all husband and wife. But there were no children.\nThe youngest, as I said, was my brother.",
        "Q: Did the local people you would get the food from, were they at all supportive of the partisans\nOr...",
        "A: No, they were just doing their job. You see, , of course, knew that there were\nJews up there. And they found out, somehow, they disguised as communists, built a bunker.\nAnd some of them were collaborators. So they told on him. Yes, Mr. -- I forgot\nhis name -- he built a bunker for the Jews who are up there in the mountains. Either the\nGestapo or the Slovak Gestapo came out and told him that \u201cEither you will tell us where the\nbunker is or we kill your family.\u2019 Of course, family came first. So this carpenter told them\nand that\u2019s how 600 German Ukrainian (ph) marched down in the valley to get our bunker\n(ph). That\u2019s how they found out. So there was a connection there. But after a while, the men\nwho told on us, they were caught and brought up to the area of the bunker. And that\u2019s where\nwe see, because the view, see what happened there. And they had to dig their own graves.\nThey took them there and shot them to death, the partisans, as a punishment for this.",
        "Q: During this time, did you, or your brother or your friends. . .",
        "A: Oh, one -- may I say this to you? When we were surprised, it was the machine gun fire that\nblows. My brother was out in the cave. He panicked and ran out of the cave. When we were\ncounting heads, , my brother was gone. he wasn\u2019t there. So we figured, either he\nwas gone by the Germans, was taken prisoner and shipped, or he was shot on the spot. But\nhe was gone. It took me until our liberation on April 7th, when we were liberated from the\nmountain, to find out that he had run down, came to a village, knocked on a door, a young\nlady let him in -- and I don\u2019t know whether he knew her before or not. I can\u2019t tell you that. I\nforgot to ask him. but anyway, he was liberated right after December 15. The village was\nliberated some time in January or so. And that\u2019s his wife today. But we do know that he\nsurvived until the end of the war, until we were liberated. So, he escaped, so we were one\nman less.",
        "Q: During this time, did you think about joining the partisan movement? Was that an option?",
        "A: It was part of the option, but somehow, it would have required to leave the family, to leave\nmy father and go away, you know? And somehow, I wasn\u2019t ready for it. So maybe I wasn\u2019t\nready to be partisan. We had a , because they came to our . But\nI\u2019m sure that if I would have said, \u201cI want to join you,\u201d they would have taken me in, maybe\ngiven me some uniform or something, but -- neither one of us -- neither of our boys in our\ngroup (ph) joined them. We had to take the favorite (ph).",
        "Q: These were Slovakian partisans, Soviet.",
        "A: One might have been Russian. But the captain, as I said, most likely a Slovak, and the other\ntwo men were Slovak, too, I think. I think. One might have been Russian.",
        "Q: And they were okay about Jews?",
        "A: I mean, they didn\u2019t murder us. I don\u2019t think there was a big love. As I say, they took our food\naway. But they let us live.",
        "Q: So, your new bunker that you built, you were in that one for several months again.",
        "A: Maybe from January \u2018til April. Maybe three months. It looked like three months. It was very,\nvery primitive. It was cold because we had just -- just wood and wood, you know, trees --\njust enough so that it didn\u2019t rain, or rather, it didn\u2019t snow. Very, very primitive. Because we\nhad no tools, nothing. And of course, no help. But we survived.",
        "Q: What was the life like there? Was it different?",
        "A: No, but we were much more -- in other words, much more scared, much more frustrated, you\nknow. And we didn\u2019t know what the end was, and what would happen. As I say, the food\nwas harder to get. We had to go down, you know, put a gun on people to get the food, and it\nwas much more rough after this burned down. Because up until that time, people pretty good\nto , but then it was much rougher.",
        "Q: Did you pay for the food or you just threatened people?",
        "A: No, no. We paid. We paid. We paid with Slov money (ph). No, we paid. We didn\u2019t want to --\nbut they people were afraid. They would have given us the food, but they said, \u201cIf you will\nsupport the Jews or other partisans, you are an enemy and you will be shot.\u201d So, I can\nunderstand their feelings. So we told them, \u201cLook, is 1t you or me?\u201d And we gave us, and we\npaid them.",
        "Q: Was there much -- either German or the Linka (ph) guard -- presence in this area at this\npoint? Could you hear a war going on other than that one time you saw . .. ?",
        "A: No. No, because maybe we were about 2,000 meters up high, see? So . Yeah, we\nheard planes overhead flying. Of course, we heard that. We didn\u2019t hear any artillery fire\nbecause it was far away. The only information that we had from the radio, and it said that the\nwas gone.",
        "Q: So you were still getting news from the radio.",
        "A: Yeah. Until the bunker was burned out, yeah.",
        "Q: And then you didn\u2019t have anything.",
        "A: But, then, of course, I say the partisans had some use until they would stay with us. And\nmaybe, I don\u2019t know, there were some people went by there or something, where those\npeople were hiding. But we are much less informed.",
        "Q: And then, in the last few months, did you have any contact with partisan people?",
        "A: After we found the two dead men there and after we build new bunker, I don\u2019t think there\nwas anymore partisans there. I just didn\u2019t see any. We were complete on our .\nMine was my brother, of course, until he ran away. But completing that part of the stories,\none morning, on April 7th, 1945, six uniformed men -- either Czechoslovak uniform or\nRussian uniform, I don\u2019t remember quite -- came to us and said, \u201cWe were sent by our\ncaptain to count any people who are hiding here and to bring them across the mountains.\nAlready, the liberation took place. And I am here to get you there.\u201d Now, we are very happy,\nbut also very scared. Are they real ones? Or are they Germans to get us and kill\nus. So we had a little consultation with us. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d If we don\u2019t go with them\nand we stay there, we probably die from hunger. If we go, we take a chance, but maybe they\nare real. And of course, it was. They took us all -- I don\u2019t know how long -- we walked there\nand crossed the mountains and we came to a village which was already liberated. It was\nApril 7th. And I know, a day or so after that, I went to my hometown. Everybody went\ndown. Tried to find my house. But where the house was, there was no house. It was a hole in\nthe ground, because our house was located near a river, a river called Vah, and the front\nmoved several times between the Germans and Russians. So the house was the target. It was\ncompletely gone and there was no house, just a hole in the ground. So, there was nowhere to\ngo. We rented in the city place -- we went there. But already, by May 15th, I was already in\nBratislava (ph) and enrolled in medical school. It was very fast. We were very impatient to\ndo.",
        "Q: When you went back to your town, were there people you knew there?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Do you mean the Jewish people or Slovak people? Jewish people, I\ndon\u2019t know that there were many left there. But the Slovak people, neighbors and so on,\nsure.",
        "Q: They welcomed you back?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t remember anymore, but I don\u2019t think 1t was a big welcome, no. There\nwas no band there. Certain things -- for instance, we had -- before we ran away, we give to\nthis Christian family to put away for us. And I think when my father went to get it, it wasn\u2019t\nthere anymore. So, they were surprised. \u201c\u201cYou mean, you are still alive?\u201d You know. It\nwasn\u2019t a big welcome. But who cared?",
        "Q: And your father, did he stay in the town?",
        "A: He stayed in the town, went back to business. Continued and worked, I think -- he died in\n1976 as an 86-and-a-half years old man. And he was working in the store after the\nwar until -- maybe until he was 75 years old or so.",
        "Q: He stayed there.",
        "A: He stayed there, yeah. And he died in the town, in Nicholage (ph). And I say, I left and went\nback to Bratislava (ph), stayed there until \u201848, and then came to this country.",
        "Q: Okay. We'll get to that. How much more time do we have?",

        "A: So as I said, April 7th was our V-Day. We came down. We didn\u2019t know what happened to\nmy brother, but very soon we find out that he was liberated about in January, about three\nmonths ahead of us, by running away. We had to rent an apartment because our house was\ndown. And I didn\u2019t stay very long. I just look at my medicalations (ph) book, and I thing on\nMay 15th already, I medicalated (ph) in Bratislava which was the capital city where the\nmedical school was located. And the only time I came home between \u201845 and \u201848 was on\nvacation. Christmas vacation and so on. And by 1946, some friend told me in the medical\nschool that there 1s a young lady who needs for the anatomical courses, she needs some\nskeletons to study. And he knew that I had some skeletons -- I don\u2019t know where I got them\nparticularly, but 1t was -- I had some skeletons. And one day, in my apartment there,\nsomebody knocks on the door and the young lady says, \u201cI am Susan Ei1soffer (ph). And I was\ntold by your friend that you\u201d -- -- \u201cthat I could borrow some bones for my\nstudy. Would you be kind enough to lend them to me?\u201d \u201cWell, sure.\u201d I liked her. I lent her\nthe bones. And the day after or so, she brought me a wonderful goose liver as a present -- as\na present for lending her the bones. And I don\u2019t know why, but I must have like her, so I\ntook her out and we were dating. And to make it short, of course, it\u2019s my wife. And her\nfather was a clinician in a small town near Bratislava, called Topochurney (ph). So he\nwanted to know who is the guy who, you know. So, one day, he comes to Bratislava to see\nwho this young man is. So, she introduced me to him and, evidently, must have liked me or\nsomething because he didn\u2019t object too much. But that was also in \u201846. And I stayed there\nuntil July or June of \u201848 because I got my -- oh, I must say this -- she got papers, she had\ninterrupted her schooling in Bratislava, and she got papers to come to America in January of\n\u201845 -- January of \u201c48. And I think she came on January Ist, \u201c48, by plane, to New York. I\nwas still there, still stayed home because I didn\u2019t speak very good English and I went to the\nAmerican consulate in Prague (ph) for interview. And the consul, a very nice man, told me,\n\u2018Please sit down, Mr. Beer.\u201d And Mr. Beer stands there. \u201cWould you sit down, Mr. Beer?\u201d\nAnd I didn\u2019t no understand one word he said. So, he knew right away that my English was\nnot too good. He says, \u201cCome back in a few months.\u201d So I took and intensive course in\nEnglish. Second time and I passed it. And I left Czechoslovakia on July 27th, \u201c48, and I\ncame by small military boat. It was called Marine Jumper, which took 10 day from the\nharbor (ph) to New York. I was sick 10 days on the boat because I was sea sick. And I\nremember, I lived only on the military ration of the big cans of grapefruit juice, 1t was the\ngreen cans, the military cans. So that\u2019s all. I was weighing 120 pounds. So, it was hard to\nrecognize me. But I came to New York. She was already waiting at the port. And August the\n5th, I arrived. And I think that we got married September 28th or 26th, next month.\n[background noise]",
        "A: September 19th, 1948.",
        "Q: In Bratislava, after the war, what was it like to be a Jew?",
        "A: Not very good. I\u2019Il tell you why. Because in 1946 started the trials of the president of the\nrepublic, Dr. Tiso (ph), the vice president of the , and all the collaborators. Small\nnumber of trials (ph). And I remember one morning, going to school, to medical school, and\nI see on houses and doors, big placards which says, \u201cDeath to these people. Why? Because it\ndidn\u2019t kill all the Jews.\u201d That was the sign. So, not very good. So, you know, that was the\nother thing -- that they should get death, but because it didn\u2019t kill all the Jews at that time.\nSo, the population in Bratislava was not very friendly. And also, in school, I couldn\u2019t say that\nI noticed anything as such. But the population wasn\u2019t ready because -- see, Bratislava was\nvery close to Vienna, and there were quite a lot of German population there. And of course,\nmany Germans were caught, they\u2019re executed, so on. So, the atmosphere wasn\u2019t very good\nthere. But you asked me how it was, so, it wasn\u2019t very pleasant.",
        "Q: Were your friends in medical school all Jewish?",
        "A: Not all. But quite a few of them were. And one\u2019s in Rochester, New York, now. One is\nliving in Switzerland. And the other friends, who were Slovaks, who went with me -- who\ngraduated with me from high school -- one of them was an instructor in anatomy in a\nmedical school. And he was very nice, very good friend of mine. And when my future wife\nhad to take a test, I told him, \u201cWould you be kind enough just to help her out?\u201d He said, \u201cOf\ncourse I will.\u201d And I remember, he called her up or she called him, and said, \u201cAdam is my\nboyfriend.\u201d \u201cWell, sure.\u201d Very, very kind. So, I had friends who were already doctors. And\nsee, because there was five years difference. And they were either in practice or they were\nassistant of Medical Supervisor (ph), and he was an instructor in anatomy. So, it was nice.",
        "Q: Did you start practicing your religion again? Was it important to you?",
        "A: Very good question. I was told, by my future wife, that you cannot be very liberal anymore\nwith our religion (ph). But, my parents would never stand for it because they were Orthodox.\n\u2018And you have to, if you want to continue contact with me, you\u2019ll have to become\nreligious.\u201d So, it was news to me because -- I\u2019m not saying that her father wasn\u2019t that\nreligious. He was a very decent, honest man about . But I said, \u201cOkay, I will.\u201d\nAnd I had to go to several ceremonies and I had to go to Mikwa (ph) -- you know what that\nis? And of course, I went to Temple and prayed and, uh, I became a Jew.",
        "Q: The whole time you were in the mountains, you probably didn\u2019t think of religion.",
        "A: No. No, survival only. We might have prayed inside, you know. But...",
        "Q: Was there any special strength that you think helped you all survive?",
        "A: Just to live and survive at all, as I say. It was enough (ph) to just live from day to day\nbecause it was very rough, and we knew what was going on down in the city and so on, so\nwe just tried to make it from day to day. And I think the will to live was strong. As I say,\neverybody from our bunker survived. They are all dead now except -- actually the one young\nman who -- he is still living. The other friend of mine, Dr. Braun (ph), he died two years ago.\nAnd of course, our parents are all gone now. So we are the last of the Mahicans.",
        "Q: Did you think, when you were hiding out, that you would make it through?",
        "A: I know that sort of -- I hoped. But there was no guarantee. I was living from day to day. But\nwe hoped.",
        "Q: When you think about this time, 50 years ago, are there certain images that come to your\nmind or certain reflections that you\u2019ve had over the years about this period?",
        "A: Really, what we can say is that we had a second lease on life. Because, as I say, my sister\ndied at the age of 23. From the girls, 300 girls left the town. Not one came alive back. The\nonly ones who saved themselves, who didn\u2019t go, you know, who were in the hospital and\nthey survived. But it was a miracle, really, that we did. And as I say, 1f my sister wouldn\u2019t\nhave been the victim, we would have been an intact family. I'll say, for example (ph) -- my\nwife, she probably told you that her mother and father both were in Auschwitz, and they all\ncame alive. But a different war. They were taken in \u201844. See, two years later than my sister\nwent. So, . But that was a miracle, too. Very few families left in tact. So all I say,\nsee, we are -- well, we\u2019re alive and grateful that we could establish ourselves again. And we\njust hope that it never happens again. That\u2019s all I can say.",
        "Q: Do you feel that -- other than the obvious, your sister -- that this period was a great loss of\nanything?",
        "A: It was -- of course, it was a terrible loss of life, loss of time. I mean, five years was lost for\nnothing. And the things that we went through. I mean, it\u2019s -- I\u2019m not blaming American\npeople who cannot understand that. May I just say an example? Somebody who we knew\nvery well came one day to my wife and asked her -- and she knew she was in Auschwitz --\n\u201cDid you have enough protein to eat?\u201d Now, this was an American person born here. An\nunliberation (ph) camp, where people went to be gassed and killed, you ask the question,\n\u201cDid you have enough protein?\u201d So, when that happened to my wife, she was shocked from\nit, you know, but -- let me tell you something. People cannot -- and I don\u2019t blame them --\nthey cannot understand what that meant. And children are torn apart and thrown against the\nwall. But human life had no value. I mean, you killed a person like nothing. But, yeah. to\ncome back to some type of normality, that was a big, big step. Life was worthless there,\nabsolutely worthless. You have seen murder, killing, I mean -- I was okay, but still, I see\nwhat\u2019s going on. So, it is very, very hard to comprehend. But American people, thank God,\ndon\u2019t know this. And I really don\u2019t blame them. But it was a very foolish question.",
        "Q: Was it a big adjustment when you arrived here?",
        "A: Well, it was, it was, yes. First of all, we were hungry. There was no food. Suddenly, you got\nhere to the land of plenty. It was hard, you know, to see all the things when you -- I\nremember, for instance, when we were still home. And when you got a banana. I remember,\nvery clearly, a banana was cut in four parts, so each one, a member of the family could get\nsomething, you know? Or an orange. Oranges are a thing to see. Those were the real thing.\nDuring the war. Before the war, 1t was no problem. So, I\u2019d just been to the plentifulness of\nthis country. And the free life. It was something which was hard to comprehend. For\ninstance, I remember -- I always carry some documentation with me because I never knew\nwhen the police would stop me and ask me for documentation, because it was normal there.\nThe people are lucky, why do you have that? Maybe I would be stopped. You know, in the\nbeginning it was (ph). \u201cWho will examine you?\u201d Things like that. So, they are different\nworlds.",
        "Q: Were these some of your first impressions?",
        "A: First impressions, yeah. Or for instance, when I first bought a car here, it was in 1940, I\nbought an air conditioned car. By that I mean it had a big hole on the floor, so it was good air\nconditioning, you know? But it was all I could afford. And we were used to brake the motor\n(ph), because it was the only way to survive. So, I remember very clearly, I wonder\nsometimes how I did it -- I never stopped for a stoplight. I went through. Until one day I was\ncaught. And I learned a lesson. Because that was the way to survive. You had to break the\nlaw. You know, you had to fight for your life. And so, the first year or so -- it\u2019s scares me -- I\nwent through the stoplight. I looked in the mirror for any cop there, and if no, I went through.\n. So, I wanted to tell you that you had to readjust. So, it was different, different\nlife. And I was very surprised for this one thing -- I don\u2019t know if this is interesting to you or\nnot -- I was stopped here by an American friend, and someone would speak to me, \u201cHow are\nyou?\u201d He\u2019d always ask me. SO I would say, \u201cOh, I will tell you. Please sit down with me\nand I will tell you everything.\u201d You know, I thought that he really wanted to know how I am\nand I wanted to tell him my story. \u201cOh, dear, I\u2019m -- good-bye, see you next time.\u201d Then I\nlearned that \u201cHow are you?\u201d doesn\u2019t mean nothing, you know. Things like that, you know,\nthey are strange to me. So, now I know what \u201cHow are you?\u201d means. It was an adjustment.\nAnd of course, I worked. I went to school during the day, I worked at night at the doctor\u2019s\nhospital as an orderly, . | worked at Hospital. And there was\npathologist there who was from Czechoslovakia. And I told him that I was a medical student\nthere and so on, and that I could use the job. So he found me a job to do autopsies, when\nsomebody dies, autopsies need to be done. So he called me and I remember, I got $10 per\ncall, whether I was called or not, $10. That was big money that time in \u201849. So I was doing\nthis for about six months. And the last autopsy which I had to do, I was called, I go. And on\nthe table lies a man whom I have seen two days alive. He was a father. We were working in\nas houseparents. And this man was the father of a girl that was a\nhousemother. He died suddenly, so his autopsy -- and I was the guy who would do it. I was\nso freaked out that I took out this, what\u2019s called the cholera, the wrong way so it was shown\n(ph). And they had to fix him and it was very . So things like that, you know.\nOne way to make a living. And I was working. I worked as an electrician during a year or so.\nAnd mostly, after , 1 got rich. And then I realized that...",

    "answers": [
        "A: Okay. My name is Adam Beer. I born in a city called Nitokislavski Nicholage (ph), which is\nSlovakia, before it was, of course, part of Czechoslovakia. And I was born February 25,\n1922.",
        "A: It\u2019s a very small town, lying very nicely, geographically, under the Tetra (ph) Mountains. In\nother words, when I was young, for instance, you could go ski, you have a\nalready on top of the mountains there. It was a very quiet life. Not much excitement. Typical\nsmall city in the Slovakia. And this lasted until about 1938. Then trouble started.",
        "A: There was not a big community. We had about 300 families. So maybe, total, 1t was 400\npeople. It was a community, which I think you can compare here to conservative.\nThere were not -- there were maybe only two or three Orthodox people. There was the rabbi,\nthe shamis (ph), and the contors (ph), the cousin. Otherwise, people were . Most\nstores were -- good stores were closed, but they made business on the site. For instance, you\ncould go Saturday, shopping, but the front, see, was closed. So you just went through the\nside door. So, it was really cheating, but that\u2019s how it worked. We had very beautiful temples\nthere in our hometown. We had, we made our own matzos (ph) during the Passover time,\nright on the school place. We had a Jewish school, Jewish grammar school, which I attended\nfrom the age of six until I was Temple, four years. Culturally, we had good cultural\nprograms. We had theater, which played. We had, Sundays, we had outing in the group.\nThere was a large Macarby (ph) group. The Zionist movement was pretty active there. So it\nwas a really very nice little community.",
        "A: Yes, we did because at that time, I had very good Christian friends, because mostly after I\nleft the grammar school, I went to the Gymnasium, which takes eight years. So you go from\n19 -- I graduated 1940 from Gymnasium. And there, I met most of my friends. We had very\ngood relationships. We were very close. We went together, we had fun together. And there\nwas no animosity. That all ended, of course, when Slovakia became independent and the\nsituation changed around. But until that time, no problem.",
        "A: My father was -- had an electrical store. He was a master electrician for many years. He was\nvery well known and he was very busy. He took care of the leather factories, took care of\nthem. Always they should be functioning. And we weren\u2019t rich people, but we had -- made a\nnice living. We also lived in a home, actually, it\u2019s two homes there. And we lived in, and\nnext door to our house was another house that we rented out. The chief of Zhandamarie (ph)\nwas our tenant there. Then, a dental technician was a tenant. And a grocery store was right\nthere. And my father was pretty entrepreneurish. For instance, he built garages for cars to\npark overnight. And we also, in the house, there was a , from the cigarette\npeople who sell cigarettes. So it was a busy place. And that was where I brought up.",
        "A: Yes. I had a older sister, two years older than I am. She was born 1919. Her name was\nGabriella, or Ella, short. And I have four years younger brother, name is Otto. My sister, of\ncourse, died in the war. And my brother is still living in my hometown in Nicholage (ph),\nSlovakia.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t really political, but they sports organizations. We had outings, we had\nexercises. It wasn\u2019t -- for instance, the was on the agenda, but at this time, I was,\nyou know, not really interested in that because we had a pretty good life there and we never\ndreamed about a time that 1t would come. So, it was more a cultural and sport organization\nthan political organization.",
        "A: Well, we knew enough. We had a radio, of course. The radio at that time was still pretty\nnew, but we had a radio. And I remember very clearly as we were listening -- my mother\nwas still living at that time -- I think it was in April of \u201834 where the president of Austria was\nshot. His name was Schuslig (ph), I think. I remember that and we were quite shocked\nbecause there was already a from Hitler\u2019s party because he wanted to\nAustria and so, it wasn\u2019t good for -- 1t was how they killed him. And the new president\n. So, we knew about Crystal Nacht (ph), in 1938, we heard that over the radio. And\nit bothered us, but still, nobody comprehend, nobody could foresee that would happen. We\nwere pretty edgy about it, but we still took the attitude, Slovakia 1s a free, beautiful,\ndemocratic country and we didn\u2019t worry much about it. I\u2019m afraid so, in 1939, before\nSlovakia Republic was born, March 14 in \u201839, my father got papers to Bolivia, to immigrate.\nIt was official and he could have given the paper right away. But my grandmother was still\nliving , and my mother was already dead, and we didn\u2019t see that we could go away\nand leave her behind. So we figured, we\u2019ll ditch these papers to go to Bolivia. And we\nstayed. And I was still in high school. As I say, I finished -- the last year the Jews could\ngraduate from high school, from gymnasium. It was on June 6, 1940. Of course, I always\nwanted to be a doctor and I wanted to go to medical school, but I was cut out. No Jew could\nenter medical school. So, what to do, then? I was 18 years old. So, I went to work for my\nfather in his electrical undertaking and I learned electrical work. And I was, it seemed, from\n19 -- to the end of the war -- 1945. Although in 1944, we already went to the mountains to\nescape, but we will come to it. But I was working, helping out, and I learned the trade. And\nabout the business. Soon, the Slovak regime started. My father had to give up the business\nand he had to be political party zealot (ph). An Audian (ph) person, had to take over. He was\nthe boss. He took the money. And just give certain amount of income to my father to live on.\nThat was from 19 -- if I remember, it may be from 1941 or so to end of the war. So my father\nwas employed, I was employed, but we stayed home. We did not go. Now, my sister, she\nwas a seamstress. She was very good at it. And she worked for a Slovak company at a job.\nBy 1942, came an order, actually, a letter given to the Jewish families, which said that all\ngirls from age, I know it was from 16 or 18, unmarried women, should report in the Jewish\nschool, I think, if I remember right, either five or ten kilograms of supply and they would be\ntaken to a working place. So all the girls from, not all the girls, there were some exceptions,\nbut many of the girls came. They had about two weeks notice. But at that time, you didn\u2019t\nknow yet what was happening, so nobody felt nothing bad about it. They came there and\nstayed overnight in the yard. And the next day, they were taken by train to the city of Poprat\n(ph), which is about 40 kilometers east, and from there, on to Auschwitz. Now, we didn\u2019t\nknow nothing. We knew nothing about Auschwitz at that time. Now, there were some\nparents who were a little bit smarter than we were. And when they got the notice, they send\ntheir daughters to hospital for appendectomy, whether they needed it or not, and they saved\ntheir lives. As a matter of fact, my classmate, girlfriend, who saved her life, lives here in\nCleveland. She\u2019s married here to an American boy. But my father,we tried to talk, I must\nsay, my sister was very good friend with a girl who was a, she was a girlfriend of the chief of\nthe . was an organization which cooperated, of course, with Hitler, and\nwhich took care of all the Jewish problems. And my father went to this -- to help this girl to\nbeg that they shouldn\u2019t take my sister. But they did not worry about it -- just didn\u2019t want to\ntalk to my father about it. And that was our goal -- that was our biggest mistake that we\nmade because they left of March 27, 1942, from my hometown, Nicholage (ph). And on\nApril the 2nd, the train took them from the city of Poprat (ph) to Auschwitz. We never heard\nof her anymore. And we found out that in May or June, they were already liquidated\n. So as I said, that was our biggest tragedy in the family. But we stayed on. And the\ntragedy was also that two weeks after she was deported, my father got so-called\neconomic exemption. That means that father, my stepmother, I and my brother, we didn\u2019t\neven have to wear the , the Star. We didn\u2019t have to wear it. We could travel, but\nthe condition was we needed to be home by 6:00 at night. We couldn\u2019t go to a movie. We\ncouldn\u2019t have a watch, we couldn\u2019t have a radio. If the family had a radio, it was a big\npunishment for that. And actually, we worked, and my father worked, uninterrupted, until\nthe uprising took in Slovakia, which was August 29, 1944. The uprising took place in a city\ncalled , which was maybe 50 or 60 kilometers away from my hometown. There\nwere some politicists, landing down (ph), some from Russia, some from the\nbrigade. They picked out a few men and they were coming towards my hometown with\ntanks and quite a few army people. In our town, there was a German station of about 10 or\n12 men who managed a telegraph station for . This partisan and the army came to\na place, that was 1n a hotel. They surprised these men. They shot them all. . It was\nthe president of -- for their interruptions. The front didn\u2019t have any more\nconnections to our home town. Because we knew that if something had happened, that there\nwould be murder. I mean, everybody would be killed because there was, you know, the\nGermans might (ph) kill them. So, we didn\u2019t know, of course, at least, something bad had\nhappened, but we were preparing ourselves for bad times, to leave our town and go to the\nmountains, because Nicholage (ph), my home town lies right on the top of a mountain. So,\nabout a year before, we found a carpenter who was not a sympathizer with the Nazis. He was\na communist. And he built us a bunker in the mountains, about three kilometers from our\ntown. Please ask me if you have a question.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Well, first of all, on October 6th, 1938, they took Slovakia and was divided in Bohemia,\nMoravia and Slovakia. Slovakia became autonomous. That means, the president was still the\npresident of both countries, but autonomy , but they still went to Slovakia. Then,\nas I say, from October 6th to March 14, 1939, when Slovakia, under the , it will\nbecome independent state, that was completely bought from Bohemia and Moravia. It\nbecame Slovenkis Shtat (ph), Slovak State. The president of our country became a Dr.\nJoseph Tiso, who was a Catholic priest and he, as a minister/president, he had person called\nDr. Voitisch Toka (ph), who was a lawyer, but also, they were all Nazis, what we call\nsympathizers with the Nazis. And from that moment on, from March 14th, the rules and\nregulations came out, restricting. They said you couldn\u2019t be on the street at night. You\ncouldn\u2019t have a radio. You couldn\u2019t have watches. You had to give up any gold or any jewel\nyou had. You\u2019d get a piece of paper that -- to get the things out. But you liberty was\nrestricted. You had to be home in time. You couldn\u2019t own anything. You could [not] have\nyour own business. You\u2019re either to work for somebody or you were just out of business.\nThat was in 1939. But there was a as I started school, until the first deportation\ntook place from town, and that was in 1941 for certain people who were claimed to be\ncommunists were at night -- police came at night, took these people away, and they were\nnever seen since -- never came back. That was in \u201841. My father -- we still had to\nat the time, yet. But because he was an electrician, they needed him, so they let him work.\nHe was under the control of the men who are in the ground. But we could work. But every\nday, some new regulations came that were tougher and tougher and tougher, until the time\ncame when, of course, people started to be deported. Not political, but deported to so-called\nwork. \u201cYou will go to work. You will help the government to survive. And you\u2019ll be fed.\nAnd you'll even get -- everything will be fine.\u201d Did I say that time when my sister was taken\nin \u201842?",
        "A: There was Slovakian government, but there were German offices in the capital city of\nSlovakia, which is Bratislava. There was a person, a German person called , who\nwas the ambassador there. And of course, he gave the instructions what should be done. But\nlocally, there were some Nazi party Youth organizations, such as Euchre (ph), but officially,\neverything was controlled by the Slovak. But the hundred or so were German.",
        "A: No, Slovakia wasn\u2019t occupied, no. Bohemia and Moravia was. But Slovakia wasn\u2019t because\nthey become allies with , and therefore, they became so-called independent, but of\ncourse, they had to do as they were told.",
        "A: You're right. Yeah.",
        "A: Interesting, as I said. A very good friend whose father was a chief of the hospital in the town\nand, as soon as was born -- and he was not Catholic, he was Protestant, he was\nLutheran -- I see him on the street one day and he had this bright uniform on. He has a\ndouble cross, not , but the double cross of Slovaks. And I told him, you know, he\nacted like (ph) he didn\u2019t see me anymore. So I knew that something was happening here. The\nuniform, you know, at that -- and, , see he was a , How are you. Very,\nvery good friend. He has a Jewish girlfriend, as a matter of fact, before this was all started.\nAnd it lasted, maybe, for about six months. Then took the youth from us, never to be out\nagain. And more of us started to be against the Slovak regime. See, he was ;\nnot Protestant. But it didn\u2019t really seem that it\u2019s another way to go and to give everything.\nBut maturity -- maturity cultivated very well. On the street, for instance, you would want to\nmeet them. Or they would want to meet you, then say Hello to you. They tried to show you\nthat, \u201cLook, I know who you are and everything, but, please, don\u2019t contact me.\u201d And that\u2019s\nhow it was.",
        "A: Yeah, but I think, not on his own. He had a supervisor. He was working and the money went\nto the boss and he was just paid a salary. I mean, a salary just to survive. But he was doing\nthe business, yes.",
        "A: There were arrests, as I said, from some of the men, who were thought of as communists.\nThey were beaten and taken away and never came back .. .\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: I was talking about how other people , any my father was still in business. Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. There were some, but really, the bad things started in 1941, and mostly in *42. That\nwas when the mass deportation took place, and the whole family was just -- they\ndisappeared. I remember, for instance, the cousin of the Schuller (ph), the colonel, his five\nchildren, I remember like today, they were taking him -- the police escort. And it was a very\nsad thing to see. And we stayed because we had the exemption. But all these people were\ngone. All the stores were out of the Jewish hens (ph) already at the time. As I say, it was all\nunder different management. And the life became tougher every day. There was a\nrationing of food. I know that we didn\u2019t have everything that we wanted, but because my\nfather was so long in business and he went to villages, to electrify the city, you know, to start\nputting electricity in the villages at that time. So, many times, he brought butter in or some\nmeat or something. So, we are not starving really. But food was very, very hard to get.",
        "A: You talking before my sister went or after? Before, I say, we didn\u2019t know it was going to be.\nWe knew that if we honestly would go to work, it will be living. But, as soon as the transport\nwent -- as I say, it was April 2nd, 1942 -- and we knew it was going to Auschwitz. And we\nheard a few weeks after that, we knew already there was a liquidation. But what could we\ndo? We couldn\u2019t escape at the time, because there was no passport, nothing you could get,\nno place. You were stuck where you were. But we tried to prepare for the inevitable, to build\nsomething that we could escape, if bad comes, and hopefully, to save our lives. And I think\nin 1943, I had a friend whose parents were farmers. And couldn\u2019t go to school, so\nhe worked for his father. And they had two horses and a big buggy. And little by little, the\nmaterial to build the bunker on Sundays, we shipped to the top of the mountain where we\nbuilt the bunker. And somehow, people didn\u2019t notice too much. You know, why are they\nbeing gone? But anyway, it was several times, delivered wood, and it was\nprobably needed. And his name, he was a carpenter, built a bunker, which I have said was\nvery wonderfully equipped. We had bunk beds -- Oh, I didn\u2019t tell you, we were four families\ntogether, four families together, which, of course, put the money together to build this\nbunker. We were all friends. There were two couples -- husband and wife, husband and wife,\nhusband and wife and a son, and my father and my stepmother and my brother and I,\nbecause my sister was gone. So four families. This bunker, it was pretty comfortably built.\nWe had, for instance, our own radio so we could communicate with the . But how we\ndid it, we brought in a bicycle and we put a through it, a dynamo on the\nbicycle. And running the wheels of the bicycle, we created electricity and we were able to\nlisten to BBC. So we knew what\u2019s going on. And it was all lasting very nicely from the day\nwhen the partisans came to town -- like I said, 1t was August 29, 1944 -- until we are\nliberated. How .. . I know, you want me to continue with this story now? Or do you have\nsome other questions?",
        "A: Please do.",
        "A: Supplies? For instance, we had -- yeah, we prepared all the supplies in canned food.\nEverything was canned. But we hid (ph) them next to the bunker, we built a big hole in the\nground and put it all in. So we had a supply for several months to live on. And\nand we are to go. It was fine. There was -- in the top of the mountain, in the little -- not the\nvalley, but there was some . So the bunker was in this . And we were able to\nlook down into the valley. So I say, except maybe the linen -- so we brought it out when we\nescaped -- but the food, everything was prepared for us to go in and start a new life. That\nwas, again, in \u201843. And we survived. Meanwhile, deportation took place almost every day.\nMore and more people were removed. For instance, there were two doctors there. And they\nneeded doctors that were still left (ph) there. But in \u201844, those families were deported, and of\ncourse, never heard of them.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Yes. Deportation took place from \u201842 to \u201844.",
        "A: First, the people, I think, they didn\u2019t need them so much. But the doctors, the electricals left\nin 1944 because we needed -- there were not enough doctors to go around. But then, the\nhospital took over and these two families were deported. Older folks, for instance, who were\nnot working anymore, who were not contributing to the economy, they were taken away.\nAnd everybody who left never returned. Nobody returned from out of town. We had\npresident of the Jewish organization there who was supposed to cooperate with this party,\nthe party. Whom to select -- it was very tough thing for a Jewish guy -- he was a\nlawyer, an attorney -- Dr. Weinmann (ph) was his name. And he had to decide whom he was\ngoing to send out. And you know, that creates very bad blood because Why me? But that\u2019s\nhow it happened. He survived the war himself. And he lived a very quiet life that got\n. I want to tell you. We knew that we might have to escape from the house. But our\nhouse where we were living was maybe 200 years old. The walls of the house were maybe\none meter thick from stone. The meters (ph) were very small. Not only were they small, but\nthey were -- they had little bars in it. So you know, if they come in the night to get you, the\ndoors were closed, the windows were . So, I told my father, \u201c\u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s\nremove these bars.\u201d\u2019 Which we did. We removed the bars so in case, maybe, we could\nescape. We had a big back yard there and -- we never had to do it,so, but I said we are\nprepared for that. We were -- 1t was harder and harder -- our insecurity was getting bigger\nand bigger because we didn\u2019t know when the time would come for us, although my father\nstill was the exception. But that could have been revoked any minute. Then it happened. We\nare working, and I remember very clearly, I was helping in the house, making the electrical\nwork in the house. And this August 9th, \u201844, I hear machine gun fire. And -- because the\ntown was very quiet until this time. In the meantime -- so we jumped up from the house,\n\u2018\u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d \u201cOh, freedom, freedom! The \u2019s here. Liberation 1s\ncoming.\u201d Well, we were very happy to hear that. And, as I said before, this killed\nhis 12 German soldiers there and arrested a few of the collaborators, maybe even shot them,\nI don\u2019t know. They were in the jail (ph), but I\u2019m sure there was some killing going on there.\nBut we knew this end of it, and, as I say, we said, \u201cNow it\u2019s time to leave.\u201d",
        "A: We knew because, well, my town was mostly Protestants, so we were a little bit against the\nregime. And there were some people were coming in with information about going on and\nmaybe even trying to get some people to join the partisans in the mountains -- because that\nwas our adventure (ph). We went around mountains all around the city. So they were coming\n-- because at that time they weren\u2019t in uniforms, they were in plain clothes. And, though we\nknew what was going on and we knew the time would come that -- we hoped that the\nrevolution would take place in the , because there was a -- the people parachuted\n(ph) from Russia and took *s army. And I understand there were even some\nAmericans who were shot down over Slovakia, and they returned. , but I was\ntold that. So, there was accumulation (ph) to get out of there and come to Liberlin (ph)\nSlovakia. So we had some information about them. And of course, Jews, if there were\nanybody around, were welcome to join the partisans. Now, my father still has to work, I had\nto work, so in the , we Stayed there. But the day came, August 29th.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t know, but again, it was in August of \u201844. The German are losing the war\n. So, we knew something would happen, but we -- this came as a surprise to us.\nWe were surprised. We didn\u2019t know what to -- we knew the end would come, only we didn\u2019t\nknow when. And we tried to prepare ourselves good as we could. As I say, we fixed the\nhouse (ph) so we could escape and so on. But it was a surprise.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think there was, really. He was a head. He was there, but I don\u2019t think there were any\nother people who were involved. But he was selected by the Slovak (ph) government, \u201cYou\nwill represent the Jews,\u201d just like in Russia ghettos, he\u2019s like the unirat (ph). So he was the\nunirat (ph), one person. And, for instance, like I said, he had a niece. The niece was working\nfor my father as a secretary or as a clerk in our business. She was a single girl, but never\nmarried. She was supposed to be the puppet (ph). He knew that this would take place for her,\nand suddenly, she disappeared. So, he saved her life. He didn\u2019t tell everybody else about the\n. So, he didn\u2019t have the best reputation. But, it was his kid, and a special life. But\notherwise, only purposes, he sent out letters to the Jewish families (ph) who were still there,\n\u201cvou must know to do this, you must stay home at six, you couldn\u2019t go to the street,\u201d other\nrestrictions went through there, to give out information. And the temple, which as I said was\na very beautiful temple, was used as a warehouse or something. there was no more services\ngoing on. So, it was very, very restricted.",
        "A: Do you mean for America?",
        "A: Very few. Very few. Only the ones who were exceptions. Very few. Because by that time,\nthe deportation took everybody. So only very few. I don\u2019t remember how many, but just\nvery, very minimal amount.",
        "A: In my town?",
        "A: Before \u201844?",
        "A: We were quite isolated, as I say. We couldn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t get much contact with the non-\nJewish people. They didn\u2019t want to talk to us, they were afraid. We didn\u2019t read much. We\nwere living from day to day. If we survived one day, we were ahead. Because, as I said, we\ndidn\u2019t know whether, at the time, if at night somebody would come and get us. For instance -\n- this is an example I\u2019Il tell you -- a friend of mine, who went with me to school, couldn\u2019t\ncontinue up through gymnasium, so he went to learn the electric trade, worked for my father.\nHis parents had a small grocery store. And they were also prepared, somehow, to save\nthemselves. And one night, they came after them. And they were able to escape in the back\nyard. And the , who came to get them, he knew very well this family. He could\nhave -- he could have said, \u201cLook, they\u2019re gone already.\u201d But no. He called them. They were\ndeported. And never came back. Why I say this, after the war, my friend came back. Then,\none day to the station and said, \u201cI want the report.\u201d And the same who\nhis friends, and let them not escape, took their information. He said, \u201cI want to\ndeclare against you.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d That day when my parents tried to escape, you know, you\n, and you let them -- and you are . To his grandchildren, nothing\nhappened. Nothing. I know it was a travesty, but nothing happened. (ph) People -- there were\nturncoats and -- after -- as soon as the liberation, he became very good to the Slovak. I know.",
        "A: That day. Let\u2019s see. I was working with him that time, that day. And about noontime, he\nhears this machine gun fire and shooting and so on. And we run out of the house and people\nare saying, \u201cOh, it\u2019s freedom. Liberation.\u201d People kaput (ph), you know. And we had seen\nsome tanks come in. and many uniforms and jubilation and so on. And we\nheard about this German soldier being killed there, so we knew right away that at that time\nwe needed to go away. And it was very smart because the next day, the German army was in\nthe city of about 43 people from east of my hometown called . They came down\nto the town from , and any men who were on the street to go to --\nas a punishment for the death of these 12 soldiers. And it was very grim. But we didn\u2019t wait\nfor that. As I say, the same day, we run out there. The family was prepared. And we were,\nlet\u2019s see, 14 or 16 people in the bunker. And from then on...",
        "A: By foot. By foot. We go through this village. See, there was no way to get there, I mean, you\ncouldn\u2019t get a taxi. I don\u2019t remember if 1t was the same night we went. I think it was the\nnight, probably, because, you know, . Because he had to take almost nothing\nwith us. Everything was there already. And we were there and overlooked now (ph) our\nhouse. And we had, I think, a good life, but a quiet life from the day -- from August 29th in\n\u201844 to December 15th, 1944.",
        "A: The food, remember, we had our supply there. But we must co-exist.",
        "A: So we are in the bunker already. And you asked me how did you spend the time. We had to\ncut wood to build fire. Fire wasn\u2019t very good thing because the fumes from the fire would go\nstraight up to heaven, you know, and anybody who was down in the valley could see there\nwas some fire there, so there must be some people there, but there was no way out. But it\nwas still August, it was still summer. It was fine. But then, September, October, November,\nDecember. Big snow fell down. It was in the mountains (ph). And we had to eat. Otherwise\nwe would from freezing. The food we still had there, but we also got an enemy\ninside there. We got lice. Washing -- there was no water there close by. There was no river\nno this -- so we had to -- I don\u2019t remember how we got them out of there. I do remember\nwashing was not a strongest point at that time, but we tried to keep it neat as we could. But\nwe got lice. And I remember, every morning, there was a time when we had to get our lice\nand clean ourselves. And it became tougher and tougher because sickness could -- we could\nhave caught sickness from that. But we made it through. But on -- about two months after we\nwere there, I don\u2019t remember the time any more, we got a surprise. Four -- I think there were\nfour or six peasants found our bunker. Came there, said, \u201cYou are Jews? You hiding here?\u201d\n\u201cYes, we are.\u201d \u201cYou have to share your bunker with us.\u201d\u2019 Now, we were 14 or 16 people\nthere. Not much room, but of course, we had to share with them. And with them was captain\n-- I remember his name, Captain Novotney (ph) was his name in Slovak. Everybody nice,\ndecent human being. And we had accommodation. We had to -- instead of one person on the\nbunker, we slept two people in the bunker and we made room for them. Both these guys had\nweapons, automatic weapons, and they were going around, they were going out, seeing\nbridges and so on (ph). And my father was very good man, but very naive man. He was so\ngrateful to these people that he told this Captain Novotney (ph), \u201cCaptain, if you should need\nany food, we have some food here. Please help yourself.\u201d And he showed them where the\nfood was. So, one day, when we went out to get our food and we see the hole there.\nEverything was taken out, no food. it really was a shock, you know. There is no food now.\nAnd it was getting winter, October, November. What to do now? So, we went down to the\nvillage. As I said, we were three young men there. And we -- one time, I went some of the\nothers so we trade so nobody come . We came to the village and told them we had\nmoney and we need some food, give us food. And we pay for it. And the people said to me,\n\u201cWe will not give you food, but if the Germans find out that we gave food, then they will kill\nus, because you\u2019re enemy.\u201d So I said, \u201cLook, either they will kill you or we will kill\nyou (we had a gun with us).\u201d And they gave us the food, we paid them, and we brought it up.\nBut winter was rougher and rougher because smoke in there. And I remember one day, my\nfriend went up, and coming back, he almost froze to death. He told me a story that he had\nsome pins and he pricked himself in the fingers so he shouldn\u2019t fall asleep, on the way up.\nHe just died about two years ago. He lived in Bohemia. He was doctor. But it was tougher\nand tougher. But on December 15th, which was a full winter -- oh, I must say this. We had,\nas I said, we were on top of the mountains, and we had a beautiful view of the valley. And\nwe had a very good German-size binoculars. So I and he, we are watching guns and what is\nhappening (ph). One day, we notice big mass, big mass of moving people there -- this is we\nare looking down in the valley. Now, we couldn\u2019t see whether they\u2019re partisans, whether\nthey\u2019re Russians, whether they\u2019re Germans, was it the , we didn\u2019t know. But we\nsaw we had to make some change in our life. Not far -- maybe 50 yards or less from our\nbunker -- was a cave. So, early in the morning, before the sun came out -- early, early in the\nmorning -- we took our rug and, you know, with us, and went to sleep in the cave because\nwe were afraid that these men might be the enemies and they would find the bunker and kill\nus. And we did this probably a few days. I don\u2019t remember how long. But it paid off on\nDecember 15th. In the meantime, we are in the cave. The house (ph) is empty. But the\npartisans stayed there. Because they had weapons, they stayed there. So we hear big fire --\nmachine gun fire -- which lasted maybe half an hour or so. and of course, being snow, we\ncould see the foot marks of the soldiers of these people. The foot marks had come there and\nthat\u2019s the end of it. But they never came. At night, we came to our bunker from the cave. The\nbunker was completely burned to the ground. And two bodies lying there, from the partisans.\nIt surprised us that the partisans were the two that were killed.",
        "A: Yeah. The partisans which were with us, yes. But two were dead. I remember, they had the\nnice boots were taken off. And I remember one guy had a finger cut off because he had\nsome, probably some ring or something. And was completely burned with gasoline down. So\nwe had no bunker. We had only the cave.",
        "A: Oh, yes. We could come out. Because remember, it was all forest. All mountains around,\ntrees. Very high up. So we could go up, yeah.",
        "A: We had one Luger. Nothing else. One Luger we had. And I don\u2019t know whether we had six\n-- we are not big shooters, you know. But I bought the Luger in my hometown\nfrom somebody. I thought if they would catch me, I would shoot myself because I didn\u2019t\nwant to fall in German hands. It was for committing suicide because I didn\u2019t want to go\n. And that\u2019s all we had.",
        "A: Oh, I figured, at least once a week. Maybe twice a week. But dare I say, we did it as a group.\nBecause it was risky, because if the German patrol catches us, of course, it\u2019s they\nfind us, we are partisans, the partisans are shot. There\u2019s no prisoners taken. So, that was\ngood. But after we had no bunker, and only the cave, we around our place, and we\ndiscovered another bunker, which we didn\u2019t know before, not too far from us. A Jewish\nfamily, whom we knew were from my hometown. The name was Mr. Stein (ph). I remember\nvery well. So we came there and we told them we had just been out. Would you please help\nus . And I\u2019Il never forget this. This old man came out. And he brought out an\nempty sardine can. And he told my father, how\u2019s this, \u201cSee this sardine can? How many\nsardines can you put in it? There is only so much room for sardines.\u201d But he wanted to say\nthere\u2019s no room for -- because he didn\u2019t let us in. We left and started to build a new bunker.\nWe had no material to do it, but we cut down trees and made a very, very primitive\nbunker. The walls was the trees. We used some rugs on top of it. And we lived\nthere from December 15th -- not December 15th, because we , but from end of\nDecember to April 7th when we were liberated.",
        "A: I guess so. Except -- yeah, to go down to the food, you know, for the food. Because,\nremember, all these people are much older. So they stayed. There were women who were old\nand sick and so on. So, that was our job, the young folks, to go get the food. And to cut the\nwood and to make fire and things like that.",
        "A: No small children. We were -- I was -- in \u201844, I was 22. My brother was 18. The other friend\nof mine, Dr. Brown, he was five years older than I am. The other boy was two years older\nthan I am. So, the youngest would be my brother was the youngest. The rest were much\nolder.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Now, I said, my stepmother, Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Gordner (ph), Mrs. Pollock (ph),\nand one bachelor from western Slovakia who was in our hometown, and he joined our group.\nSo there was one single man. The rest were all husband and wife. But there were no children.\nThe youngest, as I said, was my brother.",
        "A: No, they were just doing their job. You see, , of course, knew that there were\nJews up there. And they found out, somehow, they disguised as communists, built a bunker.\nAnd some of them were collaborators. So they told on him. Yes, Mr. -- I forgot\nhis name -- he built a bunker for the Jews who are up there in the mountains. Either the\nGestapo or the Slovak Gestapo came out and told him that \u201cEither you will tell us where the\nbunker is or we kill your family.\u2019 Of course, family came first. So this carpenter told them\nand that\u2019s how 600 German Ukrainian (ph) marched down in the valley to get our bunker\n(ph). That\u2019s how they found out. So there was a connection there. But after a while, the men\nwho told on us, they were caught and brought up to the area of the bunker. And that\u2019s where\nwe see, because the view, see what happened there. And they had to dig their own graves.\nThey took them there and shot them to death, the partisans, as a punishment for this.",
        "A: Oh, one -- may I say this to you? When we were surprised, it was the machine gun fire that\nblows. My brother was out in the cave. He panicked and ran out of the cave. When we were\ncounting heads, , my brother was gone. he wasn\u2019t there. So we figured, either he\nwas gone by the Germans, was taken prisoner and shipped, or he was shot on the spot. But\nhe was gone. It took me until our liberation on April 7th, when we were liberated from the\nmountain, to find out that he had run down, came to a village, knocked on a door, a young\nlady let him in -- and I don\u2019t know whether he knew her before or not. I can\u2019t tell you that. I\nforgot to ask him. but anyway, he was liberated right after December 15. The village was\nliberated some time in January or so. And that\u2019s his wife today. But we do know that he\nsurvived until the end of the war, until we were liberated. So, he escaped, so we were one\nman less.",
        "A: It was part of the option, but somehow, it would have required to leave the family, to leave\nmy father and go away, you know? And somehow, I wasn\u2019t ready for it. So maybe I wasn\u2019t\nready to be partisan. We had a , because they came to our . But\nI\u2019m sure that if I would have said, \u201cI want to join you,\u201d they would have taken me in, maybe\ngiven me some uniform or something, but -- neither one of us -- neither of our boys in our\ngroup (ph) joined them. We had to take the favorite (ph).",
        "A: One might have been Russian. But the captain, as I said, most likely a Slovak, and the other\ntwo men were Slovak, too, I think. I think. One might have been Russian.",
        "A: I mean, they didn\u2019t murder us. I don\u2019t think there was a big love. As I say, they took our food\naway. But they let us live.",
        "A: Maybe from January \u2018til April. Maybe three months. It looked like three months. It was very,\nvery primitive. It was cold because we had just -- just wood and wood, you know, trees --\njust enough so that it didn\u2019t rain, or rather, it didn\u2019t snow. Very, very primitive. Because we\nhad no tools, nothing. And of course, no help. But we survived.",
        "A: No, but we were much more -- in other words, much more scared, much more frustrated, you\nknow. And we didn\u2019t know what the end was, and what would happen. As I say, the food\nwas harder to get. We had to go down, you know, put a gun on people to get the food, and it\nwas much more rough after this burned down. Because up until that time, people pretty good\nto , but then it was much rougher.",
        "A: No, no. We paid. We paid. We paid with Slov money (ph). No, we paid. We didn\u2019t want to --\nbut they people were afraid. They would have given us the food, but they said, \u201cIf you will\nsupport the Jews or other partisans, you are an enemy and you will be shot.\u201d So, I can\nunderstand their feelings. So we told them, \u201cLook, is 1t you or me?\u201d And we gave us, and we\npaid them.",
        "A: No. No, because maybe we were about 2,000 meters up high, see? So . Yeah, we\nheard planes overhead flying. Of course, we heard that. We didn\u2019t hear any artillery fire\nbecause it was far away. The only information that we had from the radio, and it said that the\nwas gone.",
        "A: Yeah. Until the bunker was burned out, yeah.",
        "A: But, then, of course, I say the partisans had some use until they would stay with us. And\nmaybe, I don\u2019t know, there were some people went by there or something, where those\npeople were hiding. But we are much less informed.",
        "A: After we found the two dead men there and after we build new bunker, I don\u2019t think there\nwas anymore partisans there. I just didn\u2019t see any. We were complete on our .\nMine was my brother, of course, until he ran away. But completing that part of the stories,\none morning, on April 7th, 1945, six uniformed men -- either Czechoslovak uniform or\nRussian uniform, I don\u2019t remember quite -- came to us and said, \u201cWe were sent by our\ncaptain to count any people who are hiding here and to bring them across the mountains.\nAlready, the liberation took place. And I am here to get you there.\u201d Now, we are very happy,\nbut also very scared. Are they real ones? Or are they Germans to get us and kill\nus. So we had a little consultation with us. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d If we don\u2019t go with them\nand we stay there, we probably die from hunger. If we go, we take a chance, but maybe they\nare real. And of course, it was. They took us all -- I don\u2019t know how long -- we walked there\nand crossed the mountains and we came to a village which was already liberated. It was\nApril 7th. And I know, a day or so after that, I went to my hometown. Everybody went\ndown. Tried to find my house. But where the house was, there was no house. It was a hole in\nthe ground, because our house was located near a river, a river called Vah, and the front\nmoved several times between the Germans and Russians. So the house was the target. It was\ncompletely gone and there was no house, just a hole in the ground. So, there was nowhere to\ngo. We rented in the city place -- we went there. But already, by May 15th, I was already in\nBratislava (ph) and enrolled in medical school. It was very fast. We were very impatient to\ndo.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Do you mean the Jewish people or Slovak people? Jewish people, I\ndon\u2019t know that there were many left there. But the Slovak people, neighbors and so on,\nsure.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t remember anymore, but I don\u2019t think 1t was a big welcome, no. There\nwas no band there. Certain things -- for instance, we had -- before we ran away, we give to\nthis Christian family to put away for us. And I think when my father went to get it, it wasn\u2019t\nthere anymore. So, they were surprised. \u201c\u201cYou mean, you are still alive?\u201d You know. It\nwasn\u2019t a big welcome. But who cared?",
        "A: He stayed in the town, went back to business. Continued and worked, I think -- he died in\n1976 as an 86-and-a-half years old man. And he was working in the store after the\nwar until -- maybe until he was 75 years old or so.",
        "A: He stayed there, yeah. And he died in the town, in Nicholage (ph). And I say, I left and went\nback to Bratislava (ph), stayed there until \u201848, and then came to this country.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: So as I said, April 7th was our V-Day. We came down. We didn\u2019t know what happened to\nmy brother, but very soon we find out that he was liberated about in January, about three\nmonths ahead of us, by running away. We had to rent an apartment because our house was\ndown. And I didn\u2019t stay very long. I just look at my medicalations (ph) book, and I thing on\nMay 15th already, I medicalated (ph) in Bratislava which was the capital city where the\nmedical school was located. And the only time I came home between \u201845 and \u201848 was on\nvacation. Christmas vacation and so on. And by 1946, some friend told me in the medical\nschool that there 1s a young lady who needs for the anatomical courses, she needs some\nskeletons to study. And he knew that I had some skeletons -- I don\u2019t know where I got them\nparticularly, but 1t was -- I had some skeletons. And one day, in my apartment there,\nsomebody knocks on the door and the young lady says, \u201cI am Susan Ei1soffer (ph). And I was\ntold by your friend that you\u201d -- -- \u201cthat I could borrow some bones for my\nstudy. Would you be kind enough to lend them to me?\u201d \u201cWell, sure.\u201d I liked her. I lent her\nthe bones. And the day after or so, she brought me a wonderful goose liver as a present -- as\na present for lending her the bones. And I don\u2019t know why, but I must have like her, so I\ntook her out and we were dating. And to make it short, of course, it\u2019s my wife. And her\nfather was a clinician in a small town near Bratislava, called Topochurney (ph). So he\nwanted to know who is the guy who, you know. So, one day, he comes to Bratislava to see\nwho this young man is. So, she introduced me to him and, evidently, must have liked me or\nsomething because he didn\u2019t object too much. But that was also in \u201846. And I stayed there\nuntil July or June of \u201848 because I got my -- oh, I must say this -- she got papers, she had\ninterrupted her schooling in Bratislava, and she got papers to come to America in January of\n\u201845 -- January of \u201c48. And I think she came on January Ist, \u201c48, by plane, to New York. I\nwas still there, still stayed home because I didn\u2019t speak very good English and I went to the\nAmerican consulate in Prague (ph) for interview. And the consul, a very nice man, told me,\n\u2018Please sit down, Mr. Beer.\u201d And Mr. Beer stands there. \u201cWould you sit down, Mr. Beer?\u201d\nAnd I didn\u2019t no understand one word he said. So, he knew right away that my English was\nnot too good. He says, \u201cCome back in a few months.\u201d So I took and intensive course in\nEnglish. Second time and I passed it. And I left Czechoslovakia on July 27th, \u201c48, and I\ncame by small military boat. It was called Marine Jumper, which took 10 day from the\nharbor (ph) to New York. I was sick 10 days on the boat because I was sea sick. And I\nremember, I lived only on the military ration of the big cans of grapefruit juice, 1t was the\ngreen cans, the military cans. So that\u2019s all. I was weighing 120 pounds. So, it was hard to\nrecognize me. But I came to New York. She was already waiting at the port. And August the\n5th, I arrived. And I think that we got married September 28th or 26th, next month.\n[background noise]",
        "A: September 19th, 1948.",
        "A: Not very good. I\u2019Il tell you why. Because in 1946 started the trials of the president of the\nrepublic, Dr. Tiso (ph), the vice president of the , and all the collaborators. Small\nnumber of trials (ph). And I remember one morning, going to school, to medical school, and\nI see on houses and doors, big placards which says, \u201cDeath to these people. Why? Because it\ndidn\u2019t kill all the Jews.\u201d That was the sign. So, not very good. So, you know, that was the\nother thing -- that they should get death, but because it didn\u2019t kill all the Jews at that time.\nSo, the population in Bratislava was not very friendly. And also, in school, I couldn\u2019t say that\nI noticed anything as such. But the population wasn\u2019t ready because -- see, Bratislava was\nvery close to Vienna, and there were quite a lot of German population there. And of course,\nmany Germans were caught, they\u2019re executed, so on. So, the atmosphere wasn\u2019t very good\nthere. But you asked me how it was, so, it wasn\u2019t very pleasant.",
        "A: Not all. But quite a few of them were. And one\u2019s in Rochester, New York, now. One is\nliving in Switzerland. And the other friends, who were Slovaks, who went with me -- who\ngraduated with me from high school -- one of them was an instructor in anatomy in a\nmedical school. And he was very nice, very good friend of mine. And when my future wife\nhad to take a test, I told him, \u201cWould you be kind enough just to help her out?\u201d He said, \u201cOf\ncourse I will.\u201d And I remember, he called her up or she called him, and said, \u201cAdam is my\nboyfriend.\u201d \u201cWell, sure.\u201d Very, very kind. So, I had friends who were already doctors. And\nsee, because there was five years difference. And they were either in practice or they were\nassistant of Medical Supervisor (ph), and he was an instructor in anatomy. So, it was nice.",
        "A: Very good question. I was told, by my future wife, that you cannot be very liberal anymore\nwith our religion (ph). But, my parents would never stand for it because they were Orthodox.\n\u2018And you have to, if you want to continue contact with me, you\u2019ll have to become\nreligious.\u201d So, it was news to me because -- I\u2019m not saying that her father wasn\u2019t that\nreligious. He was a very decent, honest man about . But I said, \u201cOkay, I will.\u201d\nAnd I had to go to several ceremonies and I had to go to Mikwa (ph) -- you know what that\nis? And of course, I went to Temple and prayed and, uh, I became a Jew.",
        "A: No. No, survival only. We might have prayed inside, you know. But...",
        "A: Just to live and survive at all, as I say. It was enough (ph) to just live from day to day\nbecause it was very rough, and we knew what was going on down in the city and so on, so\nwe just tried to make it from day to day. And I think the will to live was strong. As I say,\neverybody from our bunker survived. They are all dead now except -- actually the one young\nman who -- he is still living. The other friend of mine, Dr. Braun (ph), he died two years ago.\nAnd of course, our parents are all gone now. So we are the last of the Mahicans.",
        "A: I know that sort of -- I hoped. But there was no guarantee. I was living from day to day. But\nwe hoped.",
        "A: Really, what we can say is that we had a second lease on life. Because, as I say, my sister\ndied at the age of 23. From the girls, 300 girls left the town. Not one came alive back. The\nonly ones who saved themselves, who didn\u2019t go, you know, who were in the hospital and\nthey survived. But it was a miracle, really, that we did. And as I say, 1f my sister wouldn\u2019t\nhave been the victim, we would have been an intact family. I'll say, for example (ph) -- my\nwife, she probably told you that her mother and father both were in Auschwitz, and they all\ncame alive. But a different war. They were taken in \u201844. See, two years later than my sister\nwent. So, . But that was a miracle, too. Very few families left in tact. So all I say,\nsee, we are -- well, we\u2019re alive and grateful that we could establish ourselves again. And we\njust hope that it never happens again. That\u2019s all I can say.",
        "A: It was -- of course, it was a terrible loss of life, loss of time. I mean, five years was lost for\nnothing. And the things that we went through. I mean, it\u2019s -- I\u2019m not blaming American\npeople who cannot understand that. May I just say an example? Somebody who we knew\nvery well came one day to my wife and asked her -- and she knew she was in Auschwitz --\n\u201cDid you have enough protein to eat?\u201d Now, this was an American person born here. An\nunliberation (ph) camp, where people went to be gassed and killed, you ask the question,\n\u201cDid you have enough protein?\u201d So, when that happened to my wife, she was shocked from\nit, you know, but -- let me tell you something. People cannot -- and I don\u2019t blame them --\nthey cannot understand what that meant. And children are torn apart and thrown against the\nwall. But human life had no value. I mean, you killed a person like nothing. But, yeah. to\ncome back to some type of normality, that was a big, big step. Life was worthless there,\nabsolutely worthless. You have seen murder, killing, I mean -- I was okay, but still, I see\nwhat\u2019s going on. So, it is very, very hard to comprehend. But American people, thank God,\ndon\u2019t know this. And I really don\u2019t blame them. But it was a very foolish question.",
        "A: Well, it was, it was, yes. First of all, we were hungry. There was no food. Suddenly, you got\nhere to the land of plenty. It was hard, you know, to see all the things when you -- I\nremember, for instance, when we were still home. And when you got a banana. I remember,\nvery clearly, a banana was cut in four parts, so each one, a member of the family could get\nsomething, you know? Or an orange. Oranges are a thing to see. Those were the real thing.\nDuring the war. Before the war, 1t was no problem. So, I\u2019d just been to the plentifulness of\nthis country. And the free life. It was something which was hard to comprehend. For\ninstance, I remember -- I always carry some documentation with me because I never knew\nwhen the police would stop me and ask me for documentation, because it was normal there.\nThe people are lucky, why do you have that? Maybe I would be stopped. You know, in the\nbeginning it was (ph). \u201cWho will examine you?\u201d Things like that. So, they are different\nworlds.",
        "A: First impressions, yeah. Or for instance, when I first bought a car here, it was in 1940, I\nbought an air conditioned car. By that I mean it had a big hole on the floor, so it was good air\nconditioning, you know? But it was all I could afford. And we were used to brake the motor\n(ph), because it was the only way to survive. So, I remember very clearly, I wonder\nsometimes how I did it -- I never stopped for a stoplight. I went through. Until one day I was\ncaught. And I learned a lesson. Because that was the way to survive. You had to break the\nlaw. You know, you had to fight for your life. And so, the first year or so -- it\u2019s scares me -- I\nwent through the stoplight. I looked in the mirror for any cop there, and if no, I went through.\n. So, I wanted to tell you that you had to readjust. So, it was different, different\nlife. And I was very surprised for this one thing -- I don\u2019t know if this is interesting to you or\nnot -- I was stopped here by an American friend, and someone would speak to me, \u201cHow are\nyou?\u201d He\u2019d always ask me. SO I would say, \u201cOh, I will tell you. Please sit down with me\nand I will tell you everything.\u201d You know, I thought that he really wanted to know how I am\nand I wanted to tell him my story. \u201cOh, dear, I\u2019m -- good-bye, see you next time.\u201d Then I\nlearned that \u201cHow are you?\u201d doesn\u2019t mean nothing, you know. Things like that, you know,\nthey are strange to me. So, now I know what \u201cHow are you?\u201d means. It was an adjustment.\nAnd of course, I worked. I went to school during the day, I worked at night at the doctor\u2019s\nhospital as an orderly, . | worked at Hospital. And there was\npathologist there who was from Czechoslovakia. And I told him that I was a medical student\nthere and so on, and that I could use the job. So he found me a job to do autopsies, when\nsomebody dies, autopsies need to be done. So he called me and I remember, I got $10 per\ncall, whether I was called or not, $10. That was big money that time in \u201849. So I was doing\nthis for about six months. And the last autopsy which I had to do, I was called, I go. And on\nthe table lies a man whom I have seen two days alive. He was a father. We were working in\nas houseparents. And this man was the father of a girl that was a\nhousemother. He died suddenly, so his autopsy -- and I was the guy who would do it. I was\nso freaked out that I took out this, what\u2019s called the cholera, the wrong way so it was shown\n(ph). And they had to fix him and it was very . So things like that, you know.\nOne way to make a living. And I was working. I worked as an electrician during a year or so.\nAnd mostly, after , 1 got rich. And then I realized that...",
