        "Can you describe for me the transport to Sobibor and you arrival there, and what it was like and\nwhat happened.",
        "I didn't come by train, I came by horse and wagon because I came from a small working camp. We\nwere like 800 young girls and young men, and we, they, we rode the whole day to Sobibor, and the\nmonth, it was December, 1942, December 22, 194...3, 42, 42, I'm sorry. And after riding the whole\nday in the mud, and the wagons got stuck in the mud and we had to go down and pull them out, and\non the way the farmers were outside, and they said there's no way you're going, they're going to kill\nyou and they're going to burn you. As much as we knew before, and as much we had heard, we\ndidn't believe. I-i-it was a very hard to comprehend, to believe. Why take innocent people and just\nkill them with no reason at all, and, as the day came to an end, was only 20 kilometers, but it took a\nwhole day. Everybody of us, from us, was so disgusted, that we wanted to get over with. If that's\nwhat they're going to do to us, let's do it fast, so we, we won't have to suffer. I mean, not physically,\nwe didn't, but mentally. You know, it was very hard to sit there and think, I have 4 hrs or 3 and a\nhalf hrs or 3 hrs. And as we came close to Sobibor, the whole day, natural without food, without\nwater, but that really didn't bother, we were used to it. The, the SS came out with dogs and started\nbarking, I mean, they never talked, they barked. You could never make out what they saying. A-\nalthough I spoke very well in German. I had it in school, and I picked it up more experience during\nthe time, and they started barking, and the SS told us to assemble on the platform, the railroad,\nplatform, and we all assembled there, and I stood in every way, that, and, and you felt already the\nsmell there from the burning bodies, and you saw the fire, but, you, you don't believe. It's, it's just, I\ncouldn't believe it. I myself and so my friends, and all of the sudden, I saw that girlfriend of mine\nwith whom I came walks by with a commandant from camp, that was Wagner [NB: SS-\nOberscharfiihrer Gustav Wagner], the biggest murderer, and the biggest of all the Nazis that ever\nexisted. He was caught later, in 1979 in Brazil. And he picked, she picks up one girl, and another\ngirl, and I said, \"Mira, who you looking for?\" and she says, \"I looking for girls who know how to\nknit.\" And I said, \"That's about my talent,\" and that was just a split second, and she pointed out to\nme, he said, \"Raus,\" and I came out from the whole transport, they took out 8 girls and 2 men which\nwere fathers of the girl--of some of the girls, one was a shoemaker and one was a tailor, and they\nmarched us out to the camp, and we figured we didn't have no idea what's going on, what they",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "going to do later with us. And the others they marched out, and at that moment, I don't you're\ncapable of think. You don't plan, you don't think, you don't argue, you don't--you just numb, and\nthat's how I was, numb. And then he took us, all the girls with the 2 men, and they marched us tn to\nthe camp, and as we, the, the ------- of the camp was very small, very small because when we came\nin we made out, up, 20 women and 100 men, so was very small, and, and that's smell, and I thought\nto myself, \"What is that smell?\" That smell was...you couldn't take it anymore. And as he put us\nin, in an empty barrack and then came and, and like the commandant, the Jewish commandant of\nthe inmates, he said, \"You know where, where you are?\" and we didn't say boo because you didn't\nknow who to trust, you didn't know what to say, so we had to be very careful, and by looking at\neach other we understood what we are supposed to do, and he explained it right away--\"You see the\nfire, you see this,\" and then they brought us in blankets, and bread, and coffee, and we figured that's\nthe last meal, and we remained there, un-until the morning, we laid down we slept, we didn't sleep,\nbut, I cannot explain the feelings we had. If to believe that all those who were with us are not here\nanymore...or, or not to, we, we didn't know, we were just numb to the whole situation. Early in the\nmorning, they told us to get up, and they marched us off to the sorting shed, the next morning,\nwhere they told us to sort out the belongings of the people, then when we found the belongings and\nthe pictures and the documents of the girls and the young men that were with us, we realized, but\nit's very hard to just put it into your head, they're all dead. Why? It was very difficult, it was very\ndifficult, it was very hard, and inside it builds up right away such a resentment, such a feeling of\nrevenge, such anger, if I could just kill one. For that what had happened, I would feel better, but\nyou have to keep your mouth shut, and just pretend you don't see, you don't hear, no emotions, no\nemotions whatsoever, we didn't even cry, not one of us.",
        "Can you describe the transports coming 1n.",
        "The transports, well, usually, most of them used to come in during the night, but there was some in\nthe daytime too, when you heard that whistle from the commandant of the camp, that man, that the\ntransport was coming in, and the men in the camp should get ready to unload the people, and so,\nthat whistle was like somebody would tear out you insides, you knew here are other people,\nchildren, our, older people, people who never did anything wrong in their life, and they're going to\ngo, and you cannot say, you cannot resist, you cannot just inside it builded up, that revenge, and that\nresentment, and that anger, and that pain, you know that we have builded up inside, and sometimes\nthey came in during the day, and sometimes so many came in that they couldn't handle, so they\nwould put them behind our barbed wire, and we were fenced 1n, and tell us just to walk back and\nforth, and forth and back, so what they told them that they going to work should seem to them to be\nthe truth, and that was hard, it was hard. You walk by, and you look at the face, and you know ina",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "half hour won't be here, can't even tell. You just put on a smile, your best face you can, it hurted, it\nwas very, very hard. And then some transports usually, when I had to work near the railroad tracks,\nyou know, near the ramp, there was, and, and sometimes when a transport came, we had, they sent\nus all to the compound, except for those who worked with the unloading of the people, but a few\ntimes, we went to clean the houses from the SS, and there wasn't enough time to run back, so they\nwould lock us in, or we knew ourselves we are not supposed to walk out and watch it, and, and\nsometimes we saw the people the way they were delivered, before they're dead, they torture before\nthey're dead. We saw them leaving and screaming and children crying and elderly people, and, and,\nI cannot explain the feeling that I had, and I wondered why, why, just why that why was such a big\nquestion, and nobody could answer. Like, for instance, once, I, I was called to clean up the...\nWe just ran out of film.\nBeep Beep.\nThis will be take 2.\nBeep.\nThis is uh, an incident which is going to be with me the rest of my life. All the people that I saw\ngoing, and, and imagining what's going to happen, but once a big shot was supposed to come to\nSobibor, usually they brought them, even Himmler was in Sobibor, to show them how efficient, and\nhow perfect they had killing, and how good, and they brought a transport so they took me to clean\nup the, the quarters, the living quarters of the SS, of some of the SS people, which the windows\nface the railroad track. And, when I was there cleaning with another girl, the whistle was there that\na train comes, and so we knew we have to remain there, we cannot go out, and the transport came in\nand went everything very fast, the load, unloading of the people, and a mother left a baby, I don't\nknow for what reason, in the boxcar, and Frenzel [NB: SS-Oberscharftihrer Karl Frenzel] who was\nat that time in charge of the transport, grabbed that little baby, and smashed the head, the skull\nagainst the boxcar, and they just threw it in like a dead rat, and that just, I cannot forget. I was at\nthis trial for, about 4 times, and I told them what he did, he didn't deny it, but he followed orders,\nand this I cannot forget. Why kill that child in such a miserable way? Why? Why? It was a human\nbeing. I just wish that somebody would do to his children and he should have to watch. And this is\nwith me, I cannot, for all the gruesome things that I saw, I saw a transport come, came, the people\nprobably resisted in the boxcar, I don't know, so they threw in chlorine, into the boxcar, and the\nwhole transport came, so, dead, natural. All bodies were 3, 4 times the size, some even were busted",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "open, and they just deposit them. It's, it's a really difficult to think about it and to talk about it. And\nall those builded up in me, such a anger, and the feeling of revenge, and I remember after a few\ndays, I came to the camp with a pair of brown leather boots, which, not everybody had, probably\nnobody, and I said to the group that we slept together, I took my boots, wrapped them up nicely, and\nput them under the bunk bed, un-under my head, but they said, \"Why you put them??\" I said,\n\"With these boots, I'm going to escape from Sobibor.\" Don't ask me why. Don't ask me how. And\nmaybe it's not, doesn't even make sense, but I'm going to escape with these boots, and I did escape\nwith these boots from Sobibor. And things like this, every day was something new. Like they took\nall the sick people, when we stood in the sorting shed, and sorted the things from the people, the\nbelongings, and you see the lorries, the wagons, go by, and the older people, or children who were\nmaybe orphans or, were thrown in like cabbage, and then at the end rides Gomerski [NB: SS-\nScharfthrer Hubert Gomerski], who was in charge of them, with a pistol, and just asks, \"Who is\ntired, and who cannot work, and who is sick? I'm going to help you.\" And then bullet, and then a\nbullet, and... cannot describe here the feeling. I cannot describe, I don't think there are words really\nto describe it. I was at his trial too. He said also he followed orders. And I told the judges, \"If\nHitler would come now and give him orders, or somebody else, they would do it again.\" And, it\nwas very hard just to watch, like winter sometimes came a transport, and they were busy, and they\ncouldn't handle so many. They told the people to undress, in the snow, in Poland it's very cold, in\nthe snow, naked, and they chased them like, like cattle, cattle I think you take better care of. All the\nway to camp, straight to the gas chambers.\nLet's stop...\nBeep.\nCan you talk about, uh, you talked once about a person named Mitchell, and the charade that he had\ntelling people to hang up their clothes, and he talked about...\nThis was in the beginning when it first started. They, they weren't as well-organized as later on, so\nthe German efficiency, they had a yard, a fenced in yard with hooks to hang up the clothes, and they\nwould assemble all the people from the transport and he would go out, Scharfuhrer Mitchell [NB:\nSS-Oberscharfthrer Hermann Michel], we used to call him the, the House Beater???, you know,\nand he would say in German, \"Jews, you think you're going to die. It won't happen. It won't happen\nto you. You're brought here, you give up all your belongings with a number, you'll get a number,\nand you hang up your clothes, and you go to the showers because we're afraid of sicknesses, and\nthen you'll be sent to work. But the way he said it, it's, in German he said, \"Juden, ihr denkt ihr geht",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "sterben, das gelingt euch nicht\" [NB: \u201cJews, you think you are going to die, but you won't\nsucceed\u201d\u2019], that if the Jews would want to die, but 1t won't happen, and I feel it was their way of\ndoing it, I mean, they were very well- organized and I'm not surprised at myself and other people\nthat we really didn't bel-not that we believed it because we saw it, but, we couldn't comprehend it.\nThe way it was done. With such a German efficiency, and everything to the minute and to the\nsecond, and, and you always ask why, why, you cannot ask it. It wasn't easy to be in Sobibor or any\nother camp, I suppose, death camp. I don't think you could even think straight. I remember once\ncame a big, when Himmler came to our camp, they brought 400 girls from Majdanek, that was also\na death camp, to show him, and that's when they uh, ordered to shave the heads, from those victims,\nand they shaved the hair from them, and he went and, and looked, and they got such reward, that\nthey doing such a good job, that after a while they liquidated Treblinka, and they, and all of the\nsudden when they closed up Treblinka, they brought all the inmates to Sobibor to be killed, they\nwere afraid to do it there. So one afternoon all of the sudden, the whistle, and they lock us in in our\ncamp, then we knew something extraordinary is happening. And we could hear the train coming in,\nthe Ukrainians took care of it, not our inmates, and we could hear shots, and we counted the shots,\nso much and so much, and after the last shot, they came they let us out, and they sent us to sort out\nthe belongings, and as we started, we always checked very careful, everything, for papers, for\ndocuments, for notes, for, for, anything, and we saw that they were from Treblinka, and every, and\nevery pocket was almost a note, \"Take revenge. Take revenge. We couldn't, maybe you can\ntake...the revenge.\" And in times like this, and you felt they using you and look at what they do to\nyou, the same thing, so why be here? Why? Just for their convenience? Why? And then after a\nwhile, they brought the people from Belzec because they closed up Belzec too at that time, and they\nwere in the same story, happened there. And then they expanded Sobibor, and business started\nbooming. Night and day you had transports. You, we used to work 14, 16, 18 hours a day, I mean,\ninto the night, yust the men took care of the helping to unload, the people empty of the belongings,\nand then you had to pack up, and they had to ship it to Germany. It was very difficult, I, I cannot\nexplain that feeling. And the resentment and the hate, and the, and the revenge. The revenge was\nso great, the...\nWe have to reload.\nThis will be synced with CR-3, Take 4 coming up. Correction, end sound roll.\n(Long tone).\nBeep.",

        "Can you talk about the choices that the guards had vs. the choices that you prisoners had.\nFirst of all, the guards had all the privileges. They could do whatever they wanted. They didn't\nhave to account if they killed somebody, or hit somebody, or mistreated somebody. We didn't have\nno privileges. We were there to serve the Germans, probably as long as they would have needed us,\nand then it would be the end. They guards could go outside, the guards could have furlough, the\nguards had enough food. It's altogether a different ballgame.\nDid you have choices?\nNo, I didn't have no choices. Whatever I was told I had to do, and maybe better than I could, and\nwhatever they gave me that was to eat, and that's it. The only thing that we had in our favor in\nSobibor which other camps didn't have, I don't know about Treblinka and Belzec, that they didn't\nshave our hair, the inmates, and that we could take clean clothes from the transports, and change,\nand we could wash ourselves. And I think this was keeping ourselves clean wasn't so\ndehumanizing that people had in other camps with the dirt, with the filth. They did it only for one\nreason. First of all, was a, as propaganda if some transports came in, they should see that we still\nlook like human beings, and second of all, they lived so close to our quarters, the German quarters,\nthat they were afraid for diseases. And there was enough clothes so we could take and keep\nourselves clean. This was one of the biggest things that kept us going. We were hungry. Not\nenough, sometimes we stole something from the transport, the people used to bring bread or, or\nwhatever, but there, that was very risky because most of the time when we walked to the barracks\nfrom the working place, they used to check us. They used to check us if we didn't take something\nor so, but we tried, sometimes we were successful, but the main thing that we could keep ourselves\nclean, and that's why we had that courage and that will to do something, because when you way\ndown, physically, and filthy and dirty, and shaven and this, you give up very fast, but I, I feel that\nkept us going, and that's why we thought, even if one makes it and go out, he'll look normal, he\nwon't be right away suspicious. He has a, a striped outfit, he doesn't have no hair, that was one plus\nthat they didn't think about that we had in our favor to think about uprising and about taking\nrevenge and so forth. Once a partisan group approached the camp, and they wanted, I don't know,\nliberate, or, whatever they wanted to do, but we knew it was a partisan group, and during the night a\nwhistle came, we had all to run out, whatever we had on, and stay barefooted in the snow probably,\n2, 3 hours or more, surrounded by machine guns, and everything. They figured if they should\nhappen to go through, they'll kill us all, but they left the Partisans and we went back, and at that\ntime, they made mine fields around the camp, before there were no mine fields. We were so deep",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "in the woods, that nobody could even know that something goes on. So, we started thinking about\nuprising and about revenge, and I think that kept us going, although it was silly thought, but, you\nknow, that gave us the courage to survive, to do, because we planned, we planned. The plans\nweren't worth it, maybe in the beginning, five cents, but we planned and we saw ourselves outside,\nand we saw all the Nazis killed and this kept us going, and every day in 1943 probably in February\nor well, Leon Feldhendler was picked out from a transport and brought in. We were cousins by\nmarriage, and after we told him what's going on, everybody who came in or they took him our, if\nthey killed ten from us, they picked out another ten from the next transport. We told them, and he\nsaid, \"We have to escape,\" and we asked how, he said, \"There must be a way, and we're gonna\nescape.\" And we tried started planning, and going to meeting, which only a few went because you\nhad to be very careful, and coming back, you felt like you doing something, you planning\nsomething, you trying something. If you'll succeed 1t would be wonderful. If not, you'll get a bullet\nin the back--it's better than going to the gas chambers. I promised myself I'll never go to the gas\nchamber, I'll start running, I'll start to--they have to waste a bullet. And we started organizing and\ntalking and, it, it kept us alive again, you know, that maybe we'll be able to take revenge for all\nthose who can't, who already burned there. And, and, and we promised ourselves, it didn't matter if\nwe'll survive or not, but to do something, not, the, the world shouldn't say 'the Jews went like sheep\nto the slaughter.\u2019 It's not true. We saw a lot of incidents in camp where women hit the SS people.\nThey hit once the Untersturmftthrer Neumann [NB: SS-Hauptscharfthrer Johann Niemann], they\nalmost popped out the knife for him, he was all bandaged up. They did, they did, but they're not\nhere to tell the story. And I feel that the resistance, in general, not talking about Sobibor, which\nSobibor had a successful revolt. The others tried and didn't succeed, you know. This was the only\nsuccessful revolt. But people fought back. They fought back in the woods, they fought back on the\ntrain stations, they fought back every step of the way, but they, they are not here to tell. And that\nhurts, it hurts. And, and the uh, and time runs out on the survivors too. And...\nTell me what a death camp is. Assume that I don't know. Just define a death camp as opposed to\nother kinds of camps.\nYou see, our ca-the other camps were half slave labor camp, and half death camp. Sobibor was\nonly a death camp. There was no such thing as slave labor camp. That was only strictly the\ninmates that were picked out from the tran--they just took care of the killing of the people, I mean,\nthey didn't kill them, but they helped. You know, they had to. And of the work in the camp of\ntaking care of the SS people, that's the difference. From Sobibor to Auschwitz, let's say.\nAuschwitz was a half slave labor camp and a death camp. Sobibor was just a death camp. No slave\nthere, no work, no producing, no doing, nothing.",

I don't know how she did it, but it came out. And then after the, she had a baby,\nand we all pitched in to help. I mean, first of all was the baby. Second of all, again, to do\nsomething against the Nazis, you know, maybe we'll be able. It was a challenge at the same time.\nAnd so, she kept it for 2 weeks.

Then we had, they used to take out people to the woods because they, as\nSobibor was announced the best, the most efficient death camp, so they had to expand, and they had\nto build, and they had to do, and always kept busy. The Nazis didn't want to go to the Russian\nfront, so they built and they expand, and they said they need this and they took out more people in",

They\nlived a while and they are not alive anymore. They went with the guards for water, and they hid,\nand, and they escaped. They survived the war even. And when they escaped, that day, I worked in\nthe weaponry. They were low on ammunition, so they brought some bullets which they got from\nthe Russians, and they were rusty, so a few girls, we sat there and we sanded them down, and filled\nthe belts with the ammunition, and all of the sudden, the guy who watched us, the watchman, he\nwas the Ukrainian, but he was a nice guy, but we didn't trust him. He said to us, \"You'll see what\nI'm going to do, one will get killed because of me.\" And it was true, but you don't know who to\ntrust. And he came running in, and he said, \"I have to lock you up, something is going on, and\nthere's not enough time for you to go back to your compound, and we saw those people walking in\nfrom the main gate, underneath, with their hands like this. They were beaten up, you couldn't tell\ntheir faces anymore. And then, all of the sudden, as they walked out by the weaponry, we heard the\nwhistle, and he came in here, opened the door, and we had to run to the compound. And,\nassembling right away, and as we assembled, uh, Scharftihrer Wolf [NB: SS-Unterscharfthrer\nFranz Wolf who was sentenced to eight years imprisonment at the Sobibor Trial in Hagen in 1966]\nwas such a dog, such a miserable character, I went to his trial too. He followed orders too. And,\nthey marched us off to Camp 3. Camp 3 was where the gas chambers, and they told us to assemble\nin a half moon, and all those poor guys were standing there. You couldn't tell who was who. That's\nhow they were beaten up. And they told them to pick out another 25 from us. And they were going\nto be shot with them. First they held a long speech, that some guys of ours killed two, uh, killed\none watchman, one Ukrainian, and for this we have to pay. On the way to Camp 3, they told us that\nwe're all going to be shot. But as we came there, they probably changed their mind, or I don't know\nwhy, and they told them to pick out. And I can imagine how hard it was on those guys to go over,\nand choose that you have to be killed. I mean, in the morning he was my friend, and now I have to,\nto, it was a difficult time. The-if not, they said they're going to take 50. So some stepped out, and\nthey picked blindly, and they shot them all in front of us, in their faces. They wouldn't have let\nthem, and Frenzel went over, whoever may be uh, botched or something, another bullet. And these\nthings were so hard on us, harder than a transport, because here we're like a family, we planned\ntogether, we suffer together, we, we do together, and we hoped together. And if you take out such a\npart from us, it's, it's like tearing out your own heart. It was the, but you had to go away and pretend\nagain, that you didn't see it. Or maybe what happened, happened, and it wasn't easy, 1t wasn't easy.\nI always said to myself, if they would kill me, it would be easier for me than to watch somebody\nthat I knew and maybe, and ate together, and stayed together and suffered together, and planned, it\nwas very difficult, was very difficult.",

        "We're almost, we only have one minute left, why don't you just describe for me Wagner or Frenzel.\nI think Wagner, he was caught in 1979 in Brazil. Wagner was illiterate, that's what they said. But\nhe was such a devoted Nazi. And there were days when he needed blood. Like a dog, like uh,\nneeds blood. He needed it. When he used to walk in with his thumbs in his pocket, we knew that\nsomebody's going to go. Otherwise, he won't ask??? Besides what he did with the transport. And\nwe knew also. But at the same time, as illiterate he was, he was so shrewd, that he knew what you\nthink, not what you saying. And...\n(Long tone).\nBeep.\nWhy don't we just do the escape now, the planning and then how it happened.\nWe planned all the time, and we talked about it, and we had the plan ready. It was just a matter of\ntime, because we had to plan when Wagner is on vacation. Because we knew on furlough, if he'll\nbe in the camp, he'll smell it, there's no 2 ways about it. So we waited. In the meanwhile, we knew\ntheir schedule with furloughs. By being there, we knew about everything. So, and before Wagner,\nhad to go 28 days before, they brought in a Russian unit from POWs. At first, we did-couldn't\nunderstand why, but then we found out they were all Jews. They were POWs, and we got in touch\nwith one of the leaders--every group had a leader, and we told them our plans, and we asked them\nbecause, if we didn't know what's going on outside, how far the front is, and what's going on in\ngeneral, and he told us approximately what's going on, and how far, and he, we needed that\nencouragement, and they gave us. And I said, \"You're plan is good, and it's going to work, and it\nhas to work, and we have to try, we don't have what to lose.\" And we decided the date when\nWagner left, and, the, the date was original the 13 of October, and that day we all got ready, ready,\nput on two, two sweater, and, and my boots I put on for the first time again, and I got dressed with a\ncoat and a kerchief, and you know, you didn't take no luggage with you, you didn't know where you\ngoing, or if you'll make it. And then, some units from military gestapo came to the camp, never\nused to come on that day, and we thought somebody maybe...slipped out, but they left, and the next\nday exactly, the plan was, at 4 o clock should start, everybody has to kill his, his SS man, and his\nguard, at his place of work. And it started working, and I was like messenger girl, going here, oh I\nkilled them, five, I killed, just throwing signals, not talking, but, we couldn't find Frenzel, and we\nthought, although the electric wire was cut, the telephone wire was cut, we were afraid that\nsomehow he got out on the outside and, and went for help. And this was before decided, in case",

And we\nassembled like on a normal day, and then Sasha and Liem, the organizers, went up on the table, and\nthey said, \"We can't find Frenzel. Something--everybody on his own.\" But a lot of people were\npanicky right away. A lot of people didn't want to go, they gave up. And those who felt they want\nto try, just run 1n all directions. I saw that somebody put a stepladder behind the par-uh, carpenter's\nshelf, and that people climbing up, no one explained that this was all split second. And I just\njumped up that stepladder. And as I was on top, I noticed a lot of bodies already on the mines,\nsome people went before me. I got a bullet shot from the tower right here, and I fell down. As I fell\ndown, I was so much aware, and the will to live was so great, there's no measurement to it, that I\nstarted hopping on dead bodies, and soon as reached the woods, we were in the woods, it, it was, I\nfelt, I did it, I made it. For all those, I just looked back to the fire, the fire was still burning, and to\nthe people in the back, and I figured, I did it for you. We took revenge. What's going to happen\nfrom now on, it's a different story because the war was still on. And I had to survive another 9 mos.\nWhen you said everyone had to kill an SS man, what was the plan for that, how did it happen?",
        "If he came in, let's say they called him in, they said his suit is ready to try on, his uniform, so when\nhe came in, he put it on, we had everybody, everybody had sand in his pockets, and a knife, this we\nall had, because we felt, if you throw sand in the face, then it's easy to stick in the knife because the\nperson gets blinded. So, that's what they did. The minute he came in, they threw sand, they stuck a\nknife in, and they hit, hit him. And that's how we did it. We didn't have no weapons. The original\nplan was to assemble, to go to the weaponry, take out all the weapons, and march out through the\nmain gate. But, we, we didn't succeed, the plan didn't succeed, the plan didn't succeed because we\ncouldn't find Frenzel, and had to be everybody on his own, so we did the best we could with\nwhatever we had.",

And I didn't get an infection, all those weeks that I was in the woods.\nAnd I didn't get sick without food, without water, for 2 weeks until I reached a farmer where I\nwanted, where I thought I would find refuge.",

And maybe the, they'll close up Sobibor, and all that\nwould end. And, you know, you didn't think where you're going to go, what you're going to do,\nand, especially when we had planned to go to the weaponry, take the ammunition, and go into the\nworld, and form a Partisan group. If we had weapons, we can--and we had the military people who\nknew how. We didn't know how. But, like the first day when it didn't come, we didn't, we couldn't\nrun because of the visitors, when, a-at night we laid down in Sobibor, I never tried, nobody tried.\nYou were so numb that everything that you saw around you, that you, your feelings were dead.\nYou just acted like a mechanical thing, you get up, you go to work, you listen, and that's it. And\nthis, that evening we cried, we cried very, very much. And everybody said goodbye because we\nfigured, in our wildest dreams, we didn't think one of us is going to survive. And as I cried, I cried\nmyself to sleep, I dozed off, and I saw my mother coming in through the camp, through the main\ngate. The way I left her, that how she looked. And I said, \"Mom, you know that we're going to\nescape tomorrow?\" She says, \"Yes, that's why I came.\" And she said to me, \"Come with me.\" She\ntook me by the hand, and she led me out through the main gate. And as we came out, she took me\ninto a barn, and she showed me the loft where the straw is on top, and she says, \"Go up here, and\nyou'll survive,\" and that was the end of the dream. In the morning when I got up, I recognized the\nbarn was a friend of ours, my parents'. And they had a farm, they lived in the city, but they had a\nfarm like a gentleman's farm in, in the suburbs, and I said, \"You know what? If I'll survive, and I'll\nescape, I'm going to go to that farm, and see what the, what's there. I'm--,\" so they all said you\nprobably, uh, thought about your mother, so you dreamt about it, you know how they explain it.\nBut, as we escaped, and they told us to go in groups, not all together because we didn't have any\nweapons, we had a few, and, if one group was going to get caught, the other one will maybe\nsurvive. So, I wound up with 7 men, and another girl from Czechoslovakia. Natural for the girls\nfrom other countries was very hard for the people because of the language barrier, you know. And\nthey were right away recognized. So, I walked from, we escaped on Thursday, and it was already\nSunday morning, and I just couldn't anymore, my wounds started hurting me, it was probably\ninfected. And in Poland it was so hot, uh, cold, and rain, and mud, and I being, when I...\nWe have to reload.\nOkay.\nCR-6 starts here, CR-6...\n(Several small tones).",

You s--in\nPoland, there's a lot of like mush in in the fields because of the rain, used to squeeze in just a half a\ndrop of water, and on Sunday morning, I saw from far away, there's a little deserted house, and I\nsaid to them, I'm going here. Whatever will happen will happen. I cannot take it any longer. So\none guy said, \"I'll go with you.\" And we started walking, and the other said, \"If you'll be able to buy\nsome food, you'll bring it back.\" And as I approached that little house, a house, a room, and another\nguy followed us. And I knocked on the door, and there was a little room, a Polish farmer without\nteeth, I don't know how old he was. The towel was there, the bed was there, the stove was there,\nthose were the conditions. And he said, \"You must be from Sobibor.\" And I said, \"Yes.\" And he\nsaid, \"You did the right thing.\" And he said, \"What can I do for you?\" I said, \"I'm hungry, and I\nhave that wound, and I need cleaning up. I had very long braids in Sobibor, and on the way when I\ntook out the pins one day, just fell off because this side. And he said, \"Listen, how many are you?\"\nAnd I said \"Two,\" and then the third one crawled in, and I said, \"That's it,\" and he took us into the\nbarn, and he said he has to go to church. And after he'll--because the people will get suspicious--\nafter he'll come back, he'll feed us. And that, I was afraid he's going for the SS. We didn't trust\nnobody. And as he left, and came back in a few hours, and he brought us in food, uh, I still have\nthe taste in my mouth. Borscht and meat and milk and bread and cheese, and I said, \"My God,\nthat's probably also our last meal.\" And then he said, \"When it'll get real quiet, and you will, you'll\ncome down, and I'll help you out.\" And then when it got real quiet, he, he lived there with his son.\nHis son was in his 20s. He called us in to the house--I'm telling it fast--and he had a big pot of\nwater boiling, and he said to me, \"You go behind the tub there, and wash up a little bit, and wash up\nyour wound, and I'll see what I can do for you. And we came ba--and I came back and he put\nunsalted lard. He said, \"This helps.\" I don't know if it helped. No infection, infection or anything.\nAnd he gave us again to eat, and he said, \"What do you want to do now?\" I said, \"I have to go to\none place, and if that man won't, that farmer won't take me in, I'll come back, but you have to tell\nme the village, and your name.\" He was afraid, if they catch him, he'll start to--we try and just...So\nhe said, \"My son, midnight, he'll take you out, and he'll show you the road where to go.\" I told him\nwhere I want to go, but I didn't tell him the village either because I was afraid to give away. So he\ngave us a bottle of milk, and a loaf of bread, and we had some money, and I took out, wanted to pay",

        "him, he said, \"No, there'll be peo-people that won't give you without money.\" And the son took us\nto the woods, and he told us where to go. From there to the village where I wanted to go was\nprobably 15 kilometers, about 10 miles. I could make it easily in a half a day, but we walked for 2\nweeks. And then we didn't find the others. The others thought we went in and we are not coming\nout. Maybe they killed us, so they ran away. Nobody from them survived. Nobody. And while\nwalking those 2 weeks, we just walked at night, and in the daytime we were afraid. We met a lot of\nPartisan groups, and those 2 guys said, \"Why don't we join them?\" I said, \"If you want to go to the\nPartisans, you go. I'm going where I'm supposed to--where I want to go. And we walked two\nweeks, 3 days we stayed near the highway just to cross. There was such a busy, uh, on the highway\nbecause the Russians prepared the offensive against the Germans for the Spring, and this was\nalready in October. And we crossed, and then I went up, and I, I recognized the house, in the dark.\nBut I knew that his mother lives across the road, so I said, \"Let me go in to his mother. I know she\nis alone, but, in his house, who knows who can be there.\" So, I knocked in the window, and the guy\ncame out and said, \"Please don't shoot, don't shoot!\" He thought we are partisans. And I said, \"I'm\nnot shooting. I just want to know where the owner from this farm is.\" I--he said, \"Why do you\nwant him?\" I said, \"I have something to settle with him.\" I couldn\u2019t tell him I want him to take me\nin. So, he said, \"He doesn't live here. In the other house lives his old mother, and he lives in the\ncity, which I knew he lives in the city from before the war, but, so we went across, and we're went\ninto the barn, we climbed up, and we laid on that loft upstairs, but nobody came. We heard\nbabushka going out, feeding the chickens, feeding the cow and nothing. We stayed there for 3 days,\nand we got hungry. So we said, \"Soon it will get dark, we'll go to the neighboring village. Maybe\nwe'll organize some food by, or maybe some...So we went, and we went a few kilometers, and we\ngot a bottle of milk again and a loaf of bread, and some onions, and we started walking back, and\nwe came back, and we climbed up the loft--I'm making it very short you see (laughs)--and, the\nbottle of milk, the guy, one of the guys left it on, on the floor downstairs, and I said, \"Where's the\nmilk?\" He said, \"I left it.\" It wasn't the bottle of milk, but we were afraid to leave it. Any traces\nthat people are here. So, I told him, \"Go down, and in the dark, just try to find it.\" And as he went\ndown and looked, and I said in Jewish to him, \"Did you find it?\" And as I said, \"Did you find it?\"\nlike a ghost jumped out from that loft, dressed in white, he said, \"Who are you?\" And then I said, I\nrecognized his voice, and I said, \"Yidl!\" That was my brother's name, and he said, \"You're dead.\nYou better sit down, and we'll wait.\" Took my hand, and we waited until daylight. We didn't talk\nto each other either. In the morning, I told him how, where I came, and he, he was there already\nnine months or ten months, and I told him about the dream, that mother told me to go here, that I\nwill find--she didn't say why, she just said, \"You'll survive there.\" And, it took probably, so my\nbrother said, \"Listen, he had, as the loft was probably like floor high----------------, you could climb\ndown underneath the ground, that's how they made him a bunker, underneath the ground, through",

Whatever, if he'll take\nyou in, whatever, he'll give us to eat, we'll share it, because 3 might be too many. So after a few\ndays, he came, and he had a certain whistle that my brother knew it, that the coast is clear. My\nbrother jumped out, and he said Partisans are looking for him, they want to kill him. I don't know if\nI'll be able to bring more food or so, because he used to bring the food from the city, food--bread--\nand my brother said it's not partisans, it's my sister, but she didn't want to say, so she said, she said, I\nshould come out, when I came out, he just went like this [makes the sign of the cross]. He said, \"If\nGod put you all together, we going to try to survive all together.\" And that's where I survived with\nthe other 2 men. I was nine months there. Without the, without a drop of warm water or cooked\nfood, only bread he used to bring us some onions, some garlic, he claimed that that helps, helped.\nNow they come out with the same thing. Sometimes on the holidays, a little jam with margarine,\nbut he did the best he could. He did the best he could. And, I'll never forget it. I mean, he's not\nalive anymore. Mom is not alive.

There were another woman and six children, my mother and the two of us in the\nroom and a kitchen. And, the poor, she couldn't take it, she couldn't, so we had family in a small\ntown, not far from the city where I was born, and they wrote us that we should come there, that it's\nnot so bad, and they, they have plenty of room in their house to take us in. And we moved there--to\nSilesta?? And we stayed there for about a year. We moved in 41. About a year or longer, and\nthere it wasn't really so bad. I had to go to work every day, to dig ditches. They wanted to dry, uh,\nPoland had a lot of swamps, and they wanted to dry up the fields so they can plant more, and the,\nthey were sure they're going to stay there forever. So I used to go with my brother every day to\nwork, and my mother would remain at home. We would hide her during the day. In the evening\nwe would come back, and she would come out of the hiding place, and we stayed together until, uh,\n42, October, and it wasn't so bad.

And Stafnovushulke was the\nworst place I ever went except Sobibor. The conditions were unbearable. So one day they told us\nto get our belongings, they gave us a half hour, we were going. So we went, and we walked ---------\n---, went 12 miles, in October, in the mud, and the--I did, uh, my mother said take this and take this\nand maybe you'll be able to sell it, and maybe you'll be able to buy something, food or some. So my\nbrother and I, we had bundles, and I had 2 coats, my mother's coat, a good coat, and my coat, she\nsaid, she don't need it right, right now, she has another one, and we walked all that way, the 10-12\nkilometers, and we, when we came into Staf, I turned yellow. Just yellow. And I was a young girl,\n19, 18 and a half. And they assembled us, and they started picking out, to the left and to the night.\nStaf was also a working place.

        "You see, when you're so young like I was, probably 30 was old, or 35, so really, to judge who was\nold, and who was--there were older people who were professional uh, professionals in certain\nfields, if it was carpentry or ------------, but I couldn't say, but after the war, I would say half and half\nsurvived, when I think older ones and younger ones, was all, I feel it was a matter of luck. You had\nto be lucky to survive. God had to be with you to survive. It isn't, nothing that you planned, or you\nwere smarter than the next one--I don't believe it.\nWas there spiritual resistance in Sobibor?\nYes, there was a lot of spiritual resistance, and one isn't surprised, and I wasn't surprised either.\nWhen you see day by day how many transports that were being killed for no reason, you start\nasking questions, \"Where 1s God?\" But there was s-some who believed and it was, don't ask my\nwhy, I was a strong believer, don't ask me why, it just was in me, and because I had that faith, I\nthink it was much easier for me than for the others.\nWere you able to pray?\nI mean, if you prayed you prayed only t-to see the Nazis dead, that was the only prayer you, you\nprayed. But, everybody prayed in his own way, I suppose. Deep down. Not out loudly. And there\nwas once uh, you know, Yom Kippur, that's the holiest day of the, by the Jews, and being it was\nshortly before the date that, that we set for the escape, so they made like services, one of the\nbarracks. So, the ones who didn't believe and didn't want to go in, they stood guard outside, they\nrespected what we are doing, and they didn't go in, but they helped us. So, I feel there was a, a great\ndeal of compassion and caring. There was a great deal of closeness. There was a great deal of\nrespect for one another. And there was a great deal that we tried to help each other.\nAnd now, can you tell me the story of how when the war first came, your mother described World\nWar One, and what she thought it would be like.\nYou see, when the first, when the war came, started, I mean, we didn't, I never saw a war, I never\nknew what a war was, I was born after the First World War. And I talked my mother, \"How does a\nwar look? And what's going to happen to us,\" and so forth, so she said in the first war, what did my\nmother know? In the First World War, they were fighting near the railroad station, and they\nbrought up the wounded to the city, she said, and everybody sat in the house. I don't know how\nlong it took, but they used to go out. And that's what they said, and my father brought home a lot of",

        "groceries, and a lot of flour, and a lot of sugar, and a lot of oil. He said in case we won't be able to\nget, we'll have enough to eat, until this thing...will blow over. But, it wasn't like that. The first day,\nwhen Germany declared war to Poland, they bombed our city. The Polish army was nothing. They\nweren't, they weren't capable to resist anything. That was a different ballgame. And then my father\nrealized that this is different and my mother - we saw the planes fly. We never saw planes flying\nbefore. In a few days, uh, Poland was gone. And then the Russians came to us. Because they had\nsome kind of an agreement that the Russians would go to, to Warsaw, or whatever they had the\nagreement, and the Russians came, and, and, we had the Russian officer sleeping in our house\nbecause he was in charge of the bakery from the man who saved our life, and he came to us and he\nsaid, \"Listen, you better pack up everything and take your children.\" When they made a new\nagreement that the Russians go back to the River Bug, and the Germans come in here, and he said,\n\"In, in Russia, your children can study, they can become something, you'll be all right. The\nGermans are going to do to you awful things.\" But nobody believed it. Who, who believed that\nthey'll come and kill us? They'll gas 6, 3 and a half million people only in Poland? You're\ndreaming? Nobody believed it. Nobody thought that something like this can happen. But it\nhappened. First they came and attacked. I mean, they were so efficient in their killings, you know,\nand I think, I think they still are--first a Nazi, always a Nazi. I don't believe that they're any\ndifferent. I went to so many trials in Germany, and the only thing that hurted me the most, that\nnobody from those murderers said, \"It was wrong, what we did. We shouldn't have done it.\"\nEverybody followed orders. And I feel, if somebody would come today, and give them orders, they\nwould do all over again, without hesitation. And that hurts. That hurts very much. Especially\nwhen, when I went to the first trials, and the judges were older gentlemen, or older people, one Nazi\ndefended the other. And I feel that, that's why it's so important. It shouldn't be forgotten. It\nshouldn't be forgotten because it can happen again.\nThank you, let's cut. I'd like to ask you [audio cuts off]\nWhenever I go to sleep, all of Sobibor comes back. And the worst part was, after the war, if I said,\ntold somebody I was in Sobibor, never heard it, never heard it, never heard it. You see, because, all\nthe other camps were liberated by, by the army...\nTell me about that. Wait until he gets-----------.\nBeep.\nTen.",

        "You see, we liberated ourselves because we escaped, and we made the uprising. All the other death\ncamps or slave labor camps were liberated by the army, with, with, uh, the ----------, with all the\npress, and, and the world knew Sobibor, nobody knew. If I told them after the war, there was a\nSobibor, never heard of it, and never heard of it, and that hurted me so much because I thought it\nwould just be forgotten. It will go away. If not for Richard Rashke [NB: author of Escape from\nSobibor], who found a footnote 1n the library when they arrested Wagner in Brazil, and he took the\nstory, and he worked on it, and he interviewed people, and he put in his money, and he wrote the\nbook. The book opened the eyes that there was a Sobibor, and that people, that was the biggest uh,\nuprising in the history of the World War Two. Why not tell it? And thanks to him, Sobibor came\nout, the story came out, the world knows what's happened, and, and it's written about it, and people,\nuh, and the book is translated to so many languages, and children learn in school thanks to that.\nOtherwise Sobibor would have been forgotten.",
