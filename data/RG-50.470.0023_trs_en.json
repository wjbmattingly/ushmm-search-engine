How organized it was, what it meant, what\nemotions you Saw.\nIRENE WEBER:\nI was liberated ina strange way. I was in a prison in\nCzechoslovakia because 1 escaped twice. And finally I was\nfound and put in a prison. And that prison was totally\nabandoned by the Nazis and we were locked in until the Red\nCross, the International Red Cross came in and liberated us,\nand opened the doors for us. But where I was\u2019 liberated\nwhere the Russians came in to liberate the place, that area.\nIn Czechoslovakia. So I was--of course, they didn't just\nlet us go, but they--we had health check-up, we were de\nliced and sent to the hospital the persons that needed it,\nneeded hospitalization were sent there. I went to the\nhospital. Because I suffered from undernourishment and I\nhad the symptoms, and while I was in the hospital something\nhappened that really made me feel good. I saw the mighty\nGerman armies through the window in the hospital, I was the\narmies walking with their arms up and hands behind their\nheads, and the Russians soldiers that were leading them. And\nthis is when I really believed the war is over.",

If I wish to go back, they\nwould have arranged it. But I didn't want to go back, I had\nno one to go back to. So I stayed in Czechoslovakia. I\ngot, I met a girlfriend, and we had small apartment that was\nleft by the Germans that escaped and we stayed there, yeah,\nand I wasn't quite well yet. I met that girl in in the pr,\nin the hospital and I had to look for away to make\u2019 some\nmoney. And of course registered as a Czechoslovakian\ncitizen. I totally rejected my Polish background at that\ntime.",
        "Sandy: Was there much support ,,,?\nIRENE WEBER:\nI did not feel abandoned, I felt free. It was very hard for\nme. But the strange thing is that I was not in contact with\nany other people that came from concentration camps , so _ I\nwas really totally detached from everything. And I wanted\nto make life for myself and go to school and I had to work\nand learn on the job because I wanted to be free and I\nwanted to be away from from everything..\nSandy: Tell me about the --tell me about the physical\ncondition you were in when you were liberated. Like what\nyou looked like, how much you weighed.\nIRENE WEBER:\nI lost a lot of weight and I had wounds in my mouth from\nundernourishment, so I was treated for that.

And\nthe reason I could in that apartment and not need anything\nbecause everything was left behind, linens and dishes\u2019 and\nthings like that. But I still was not quite well, I had the\ngastro-intestinal problem for long time.\nSandy: Now tell me about the occasion that you came to a\ndisplaced persons camp.\nITRENE WEBER:\nWell, after a while in Czechoslovakia, the Russians, the\ncommunist party was voted into power, and as soon as this\nhappened we were not allowed to leave the country and we\nwere closed in. We had to have out IDS with us all the\ntime, and there was lots of propaganda, how wonderful life\n1s under communism. I was very young, somehow I did not",
        "believe that because I thought if can not leave, if I cannot\ntravel and leave the country, it didn't sound good to me. I\nwas not very well informed on the ideology of the communist\nparty, but I just didn't like it. So I went to Prague. Was\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/14/95 Int. IRENE WEBER\nPage 4\nvery difficult, I just left everything behind,i just take\nthe little bag, took a little baggage with my clothes\u2019 and\nwent to Prague and tried to get help to get out of the\ncountry. 1 was very determined to get out and be free.\nThat was my--this is what I wanted most just to be free.\nAnd with there was an organization, underground organization\nthat smuggled people through the border and I remember we\nhad, I had to stay in Prague a couple of days and then we\nwent on a bus. There were several people. WE went on he bus\nto the border line. There we spent the night which was\nabsolutely horrible, and at a certain time we were told, now\nwe can crawl under the fence and get to the other side to\nGermany. And that was the American zone of Germany. And I\ndid that and it was a terrible experience this whole thing\nbecause there were renegades and people that were not very\nkind to us. And we our my life was in danger in really.",
        "But once I crossed the border, there was a bus waiting for\nme,for several people I guess, and we were taken to\nLandsberg In Germany, in west Germany. And there we were in\na DP camp.\nSandy: Tell me about that.\nITRENE WEBER:\nI didn't like it at all because again I was ina camp with\nbunkbeds and crowded and lots of people and no privacy. And\nit just felt that I was in a camp again except thee were no\nNazis around. Ad I don't know how I met--and people lived\nthere, they were getting married, they had babies. And they\ndidn't have babies while I was there, but they were\npregnant,and I thought, this is not a life--I can't do that,\nI cannot stay here. And then I found out that one of our\npeople somehow was on a farm several miles away from\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/14/95 Int. IRENE WEBER\nPage 5\nLandsberg, and I wanted to see her and I walked several\nmiles and met her. I knew her from concentration camp, and I\ntold her I wanted to stay with her, I don't want to be ina",
        "camp again. I want to stay with her if she will have, let\nme stay until I find a different way and I can settle and\nsomething until? figure out what to do with myself. And so\nI did. I picked up my little bundle again, and I went to the\nfarm. And I was working, it was a German family that owned\nthe farm. And I was working on the farm a little to earn my\nkeep. And in the meantime, I found out that there is a\nplace that there are several of our people settled in and\nthat 1S Rosenheim. Not too far from Munich. And this\nis--and I went there. I went to Rosenheim, and I got a\nroom, two room, actually, a sitting and a bedroom, with a\nGerman family. And I paid them. The only means of paying\nthem I had is because the jewish organization was sending us\ncheese, 5 found boxes of cheese, and wine and cigarettes.\nAnd I didn't drink the wine and I didn't smoke the\nCigarettes. I ate the cheese. So I sold it and some kind\nof shortening, I sold all that to the Germans, I gave it to\nthem and they let me stay and gave me a few dollars, marks,\nnot dollars. And I stayed there and then I thought now what\nnext step is. I have to go to- school. I have to do\nsomething. And I found about that was ORT, I think, the\nAmerican ORT. I went to Munich and I found out about that.\nAnd I, I chose nursing school. And then I had to go to\nFoehrenwald,which is a small town, a village and this is\nwhere\nRoll 2\nIRENE WEBER:",
        "So I found about the nursing school and I went there and I\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/14/95 Int. IRENE WEBER\nPage 6\nwent to school, I practiced in the hospital, and when I\nfinished I got my diploma, I got a job in Poking which was a\nDP camp also. But I lived in the nurses quarters. And I\nwas, my patients were all survivors. And many people were\ngoing on the Alia to Israel. And we were taking care of,\ntaking blood and helping out that way, and I also had a\nsteady job in the hospital, in the DP hospital, hos hospital\nfor displaced persons.\nSandy: Tell me about the people going to Israel.\nIRENE WEBER:\nThey were people just like myself. Some of them, young,\nsome of them older people. They all wanted to go. And many\nof them did, I think. Of course, it was not yet, Palestine\nwas not yet the state of Israel, 1S was Palestine, and they\nactually were entering illegally. The country that is now\nIsrael. But nevertheless they wanted to go there. I\nprobably would have gone to Israel after finishing my duty.",
        "I felt that I am doing a very important job. working as a\nnurse ina DP hospital. And then I thought that I may\neventually go to Israel.\nSandy: Tell me again about not wanting to stay in Landsberg\nand why.\nITRENE WEBER:\nWhy I didn't want to stay, I have to stress very much that\nthe conditions were very crowded. No privacy of any kind,\nand too many people, and too much eh emotionally it reminded\nme of the concentration camp, although it was not. And I\nrealize that all along, of course, and I was free to leave\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/14/95 Int. IRENE WEBER\nPage 7\nwhenever I wanted which was great. But the life in those,\nin the DP camp was not for me. Lots of people were very\nhappy that they had this safety of those camps. IT just\nchose not to stay there.\nSandy: What about being in Germany, travelling in Germany.",
        "WERe you afraid?\nIRENE WEBER:\nNo, I was not afraid, because I kept still my place in\nRosenheim, My room, And I was guite a distance away in\nschool, so about once in two weeks I used to come by train\nback to my place, knowing just I want I just had to know I\nhad a place of my own, my privacy iS So important to me.\nAnd I traveled back to school throughout the whole night\nbecause the railroads were bombed, and I had to change two\nor three trains, and I slept while waiting for the next\ntrain, I just slept on the bench and the station master knew\nme, and the gave me some blankets, army blankets to cover\nmyself up because it was cold. And I was never afraid,\nSomehow I was never afraid. I was the only at that station\nin the middle of the night because I travelled at night. I\nstarted late afternoon and I travelled at night so I could\nbe back in school in the morning.\nSandy: Were you given enough support after liberation?\nIRENE WEBER:\nWell I tried really to help myself as much as I could when I\nwas in Czechoslovakia. I didn't get any support because I\nleft this whole, you know, network of help, you know. So I\ndidn't get it. But when I went back, when I came to Germany\nI did get the support. Whether it was enough or not, I",

It\nprobably was very help- helpful. So, but I thought I cannot\ncontinue doing this forever. I wanted to build-make some\nlife and future for myself. And when I was working in the\nhospital, of course, there was some money that I got. I was\npaid for my job and also we still had some aid from the\nUnited States, Jewish Organizations, the Joint Organization\nand the UNRAA and such, so it was. Yes, I did travel in\nGermany. And I just simply did not have any fear at all\nbecause I felt that what I went through during the years of\nwar and concentration camp, and especially prison, and after\nescaping, then I had nothing to be afraid of.",
