        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nDavid Weiss Halivni, which is taped on June 13\", 2014. The interviewer is\nMichael Abramowitz, and we are at the museum in Washington, D.C. So,\nprofessor, I would like to start with some basic questions: where were you born, and\n\u2014 and where were you raised?",
        "Answer: Well, I was born in a little village, which changed hands a number of\ntimes. It was called Poliana Kobyletska. Poliana, p-o-l-y-n, koba, k-o-b \u2014 koba,\nb-e-l-e-c-k-y, that\u2019s how I spell it. At that time, when I was born, it was\nCzechoslovakia. Then for a while after the war, it was Russia. Now it\u2019s Ukraine.\nBut my father got there because \u2014 which 1s interesting \u2014 all of a sudden \u2014 that\u2019s\nwhat people told me, a wonder rabbi appeared.",
        "Q: A wonder rabbi?",
        "A: Yes. Supposedly he performed miracles. He knew a person, the ba \u2014 sickness,\nwhich 1s always the platform for wonder people, you know, to heal, to \u2014 and my f \u2014\nand he needed somebody to set up his \u2014 his sel \u2014 activities, and my father was\nchosen, and therefore he moved to \u2014 he \u2014 he settled in Poliana, in Ponya(ph), and\nhe moved there. And of course, I was there, I was born there. I tell it because all of\na sudden, two or three years later, he ceased performing miracles, and the whole\nJune 13, 2014\nthing evaporated, and there was no \u2014 there was no reason for my grandfather \u2014 for\nmy father any more to stay there, and we moved away from there, we moved to a\nbigger city called Houst(ph) or Hist(ph), Houst(ph). May I also tell you, I think it\u2019s\ninteresting, you \u2014 you'll decide what you want do with this story. After this he\nbecame paralyzed, and nobody even know where \u2014 what happened then. The whole\nthing, the whole \u2014 there were only 50 families, Jewish families in \u2014 in that village,\nand if he left, th \u2014",
        "Q: Was his whole body paralyzed?",
        "A: Whole bo-body, th \u2014 we need \u2014 and people didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t hear from him, I\ndidn\u2019t know what happened. And then, a few month before deportation, in \u00b044, I got\na message he appeared, reappeared. Must have been in an institution the meantime,\nI don\u2019t know. He reappeared, and asked to be \u2014 he wants to see me. I was come pa \u2014\nI was [indecipherable] outside my narrow \u2014 he must have heard, he wants to come.",
        "Q: So you were about 15 or 16.",
        "A: Fifteen or 16.",
        "Q: And you had not seen your father for many years.",
        "A: No, I\u2014 my father, we \u2014 we do \u2014 Ill come to it.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJune 13, 2014",
        "A: I\u2014I just want that \u2014 you don\u2019t have to mention, but it\u2019s interesting. I \u2014 he came\nto see me, he want to come and see me, in a wheelchair, of course. As soon as he\nopened the door, he burst out into tears loudly, and he couldn\u2019t speak. Tried to\nbreak into \u2014 hold a conversation, to engage in something, and didn\u2019t come out. So\nmuch so that said goodbye, and we left. Few month later, there were \u2014 we were \u2014\nthe deportation to Auschwitz. I\u2019m always asking myself, what was the \u2014 the \u2014 the\ncause for that \u2014 what shall I say? Thunder, kind of flood of tears that came out?\nCould it be that I reminded him of the years when he had power, and that caused\nthat? Or, he still had some power, and he knew about the deportation. He knew I\nhad [indecipherable] time. In any case, a few month later \u2014 later, of course he was\ndeported, and he was \u2014 so, let me go back. My father left, went back to Houst(ph),\nand we lived in Houst(ph) two or three years, and then my mother and father broke\nup, and the age four or five \u2014 I was born in \u201927 \u2014 the age of four or five, we \u2014\nMother left Father, and we went to Sighet, where my grandfather lived. It was in\nSighet that I was brought up, and I lived there with grandfather. Finally they were\ndivorced. Til Mengele separated grandfather from me, you know, the \u2014",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your grandfather, because he really became the father in\nyour life.\nJune 13, 2014",
        "A: Right, he is the \u2014 the \u2014 I do say, I say it in the book. There are two people who\nhad the influence. One was the grandfather, who was a er \u2014 great Talmud scholar,\nbut old-fashioned, if I may use the word [indecipherable] the old-fashioned, but the\n\u2014 who \u2014 who \u2014 who taught themself [indecipherable] at night, he used to give a\u2014a\nlesson [indecipherable] Talmud. And \u2014 and he brought me up, that\u2019s the male\nfigure that I know. He was very poor, he could hardly support me and my mom, my\nmother and another sister. But he was then a great influence, that he taught me how\nto learn on a simple, elementary level. And he was a shochet, he was a Belzer\nshochet, with uniform, with a kapoto(ph), you know what\u2019s a kapoto(ph) and\n[indecipherable] so from secular knowledge, or secular activity, he had no idea,\nthere was no \u2014 it\u2019s no \u2014 he didn\u2019t \u2014 you can\u2019t even see he rejected it because he had\nno dealings, or that. So I was brought up, and of course, along these lines. And then\npeople asked \u2014 even today asked me how \u2014 where it comes from. I can\u2019t answer the\nquestion. Since I remember, even when I was five or six years, and lived under the\ninfluence of grandfather, I wanted to study secular knowledge. I wanted to have\nsecular knowledge.",
        "Q: Did you go to \u2014 did you go to a secular school at all?",
        "A: Not at all.",
        "Q: Not at all.\nJune 13, 2014",
        "A: That\u2019s what they \u2014 people asking me, where did that come. Maybe you will see\nwhat you could do with that. When I was a chi \u2014 five, six years even, and I used to\npray, daven, and I said the prayer [indecipherable] God give us in our heart,\nunderstanding, to understand you and so on. I remember I used to look at the\nwindow, signifying outside knowledge as well, not only religious knowledge.\nWhere I got that \u2014 that urge, I don\u2019t know. That really, after the war, after the\nliberation, that was the reason I didn\u2019t go to Israel. I wanted \u2014 was afraid I wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to study there, I didn\u2019t know, secular knowledge, so I went to the United\nStates where the \u2014 so \u2014 so I had the \u2014 but then I was \u2014 so grandfather had the\nenormous influence, other than some ideas. I was never a shochet, never believed in\nthe [indecipherable], even though grandfather used to tell miracles, and the\n[indecipherable]. And then, of course, that lasted til \u2014 til \u201944, and then \u00b044, the\nother person that had the influence on me, was Professor Saul Lieberman, who\nwas the great \u2014 the great Talmud scholars. And then eventually I adopted the more\nscientific, or the more critical approach \u2014 could tell you I \u2014 to the study of Talmud,\nwhich I now write, teach, preach.",
        "Q: So you mentioned that you were considered a child prodigy in the \u2014 in the town\nwhere you grew up. Can you remember at all how you \u2014 when you first realized that\nmight have a calling in this area?\nJune 13, 2014",
        "A: Yes, I remember exactly. When I felt that the first ttme \u2014 when others felt that,\nhow old was I? Was I seven? Around there, give or take. I used to go every Friday\nwith grandfather to take a bath. We had no pi \u2014 we didn\u2019t had hot water in the\nhouse, we had to warm it up [indecipherable]. So once a week, Friday, as you\ncould imagine, we went, and there was ambatya(ph), a bath. We had to pay for it,\nand grand \u2014 but the \u2014 I was allowed for the two of us, he and me to use the same \u2014\nthe same bath. One day \u2014 one week \u2014 one Friday \u2014 be th-there was a seat there, I\nremember, and there were two \u2014 what\u2019s the English word for ambatya(ph)? What is\nit called, the one that \u2014 1t escapes me. The one that you have inside.",
        "Q: A bath.",
        "A: A bath, but what 1s it called, skatabietel(ph) in Yiddish.",
        "Q: Not a sauna, or a steambath?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, the container.",
        "Q: Oh, oh, a\u2014 a tub?",
        "A: A tu \u2014 that\u2019s a tub, there\u2019s a name, the tub, the ba-bathtub.",
        "Q: Bathtub, okay.",
        "A: Yeah, the bathtub 1s good enough. I remember the bathtub in there was two, kind\nof place to sit, and I\u2014 we got up on the bathtub, and I tell grandfather, I remember, I\ncould tell you the name of all generation, the name of the generations, since the\nJune 13, 2014\ntime of Adam, the first person, til King David. [indecipherable] And I gave him\nthe list, I still remember it. And that \u2014",
        "Q: T-Tell me \u2014 right, that\u2019s it.",
        "A: And so much so that afterwards, people in the street used to tell the story, and\nthey used to ask me, and [indecipherable] which is the \u2014",
        "Q: So they would come up to you and ask you questions, try to test you.",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] wha-what \u2014 what\u2019s the te \u2014 what\u2019s the 21\u201c\n[indecipherable]. I have an interesting story I will tell though. I was \u2014 later on I\nlearned Talmud, at the age of nine, 10, I knew 200 pages [indecipherable] by heart.\nAnd I came to a city, it\u2019s called Vishiva, my late wife came from there. And a man\nby the name of Lefkowich(ph), Bartka(ph) Lefkowich(ph) I think it was.\nYakabowich(ph). Yakabowich(ph) told me, I\u2019ll give you \u2014 tell me the 25\"\nrovo(ph), the name of the sage who\u2019s mentioned [indecipherable], and Ill give\nyou 25 lei. For a poor \u2014 for me, that was considerable money. So I told him. And I\nwas stretching out my hand to get money. He turns to me, he says, how do I know\nthat you are right? I remember it to this day, over here, I \u2014 I have \u2014 that was taken\nback, that he \u2014 he has such a [indecipherable] question. He \u2014 I \u2014 but I wanted the\nmoney, and he was willing to give, so I told him, if I\u2019ll tell you the 10, the 15, the\n20\" and the 25\", would you give me the money? No, don\u2019t want.\nJune 13, 2014",
        "Q: Can you \u2014 I don\u2019t want to forget your mother. Can you tell me a little bit about\nyour mother, and \u2014 cause she also raised you, obviously, and you \u2014",
        "A: Lately \u2014 lately, I was thinking about that. Interesting. She was bitter.",
        "Q: Bitter.",
        "A: Bitter, yeah, because of the divorce, and she was an elegant woman, and \u2014 but\nlife wasn\u2019t elegant, life didn\u2019t treat her too well.",
        "Q: And what was her name?",
        "A: Fayga(ph).",
        "Q: Fayga(ph).",
        "A: Our ten \u2014 two weeks ago, less than two weeks, it was 70 years that she and\ngrandfather and my sister and Aunt Ani(ph) arrived at Auschwitz. And really I was\nthinking, trying even to remember, I remembered that she would kiss me and\npassionately \u2014 I don\u2019t remember. She was suffering. She had the daughter who was\nparalyzed.",
        "Q: Your sister?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Your sister?",
        "A: My sister.",
        "Q: Yes.\nJune 13, 2014",
        "A: Laysha(ph) was her name. She died afterwards a natural death, but that, of\ncourse, made life much more miserable. She was relatively intelligent, she had a\nHungarian [indecipherable]. She had ambition, she was a \u2014 which were never\nrealized. So, she was religious. So finally she was claimed by the crematoria, when\nshe came. That was [indecipherable]. And then I was together with the aunt, she\nhad a sister. The problem was that when we came to grandfather, we were four\npeople; grandfather and the three children. I had a sister, and I\u2019m one \u2014 the sick\nsister, and myself, and she and the mother, we were four people. Grandfather, with\ndifficulty, could support us, which made \u2014 cal \u2014 created tension. We had really no\nfull job. So we ca \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we came to gr-gr-grand-mother, she had to\n[indecipherable] in the \u2014 the \u2014 the kitchen, they have, of course, and the \u2014 the\nhousehold, and so on. But she was always \u2014 always a sense of bitterness. But the\nproblem was when we came the grandfather, 1n addition to the poverty, he had two\nstill unmarried daughters. And in those time, marriageable \u2014 to marriage, to get\ndowry, was not an easy \u2014 one easy thing. And the \u2014 and that, of course, added\ntension to the house, which I [indecipherable] occasionally used to shout at me,\nthen the other \u2014 I was convinced that they were against me. And then finally one got\nmarried, and faced a tragedy; husband died within two or three years. But the other\ndaughter came with me, though shu \u2014 she must have been about in the late 20s, you\nJune 13, 2014\ncould imagine those days, probably [indecipherable] to explain, you\u2019ll understand.\nI thought she\u2019s against me, and there is nothing I could do. But I knew that if you\nmake a Mi Shebeirach, you know what a Mi Shebeirach is? When you read the\nTorah, if you want ask for health, or for anything, you read \u2014 you make \u2014 ask for a\nspecial blessing while the Torah, the scroll is on the table, that has special \u2014 so as a\nchild, eight or nine, I thought that will work negatively too. If \u2019Il make a anti Mi\nShebeirach against it, she will \u2014 something.",
        "Q: It\u2019s like a curse or something.",
        "A: Something left. I didn\u2019t realize that when we arrived at Auschwitz 70 years ago,\nand they opened up the cars, and they shouted [speaks German] I apparently was\nnear the door, and I jumped out from among the first one on the \u2014 I heard the\nshouting after me in Yiddish [speaks Yiddish]. The Torah that you so much\nworked on \u2014 worked on it \u2014 on there, should offend you \u2014 protect you. And I\ncontribute \u2014 and it did protect.",
        "Q: That\u2019s wonderful. So she \u2014 she \u2014 you \u2014 you realized that she \u2014 she loved you.",
        "A: She realized that time that she loved me. In the Torah that you so much worked\non \u2014 n-not so that I\u2019d worked, that \u2014 that there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s so much willing to\nrenounce, conveniences [indecipherable] convenience in order to achieve it,\nJune 13, 2014\nprotect. She was \u2014 she didn\u2019t go to the crematoria, she went to a labor camp, and\nshe died there.",
        "Q: Can you \u2014 I\u2014I wonder if it\u2019s possible if you could just take a \u2014 a couple minutes\nto tell us a little bit about what life was like in the town where you grew up. Just \u2014\nit\u2019s a very \u2014 it\u2019s interesting, because you\u2019re a connection to a \u2014 to a\u2014 hundreds of\nyears of history that have been lost to many of us. But \u2014 and it was \u2014 and that was\ndestroyed, you know, in the Holocaust.",
        "A: The \u2014 the city? The city \u2014",
        "Q: What was life like there, when you grew up?",
        "A: The city was almost 10,000 Jews, mainly Hassidim. There were non-religious\nJews too, but I didn\u2019t know them, I found out after the war. Some of the youth were\ncommunists, like in other places. Religious. But I wa \u2014 I think I\u2019m making a\u2014a\ntruthful statement; when I came to Sighet when I was 40 years old, so that could be\n\u00b031 \u2014\u201932. There may have been seven \u2014 several hundred young people with payos.\nWhen I left Sighet in \u201944, there were less than 50. So this secularization\n[indecipherable] or the communization had enormous impact. The Jews were\ngenerally poor, all Hassidim of certain Rebbes, engaged in quarrel, in\n[indecipherable] as there is always between the Rebbes. And little \u2014 none \u2014 no\nconnection with the non-Jews. I \u2014 we \u2014 the language we spoke, and didn\u2019t even\nJune 13, 2014\nknow it, was Yiddish. I mean, I know Yiddish, how to go buy \u2014 buy in the \u2014 in the\nshop. But I didn\u2019t know [indecipherable] the Yiddish, I didn\u2019t even know that there\nis some Germans in Yiddish, I eventually found out that the German\u2019s in Yiddish.\nAfter the war I felt a kind of [indecipherable] a kind of poetic urge to write down,\njot down, but I know no language, only Yiddish. So I jotted down in Yiddish, and I\nwas embarrassed to show. But not long ago, I took it out, and they\u2019re translating it\nto French. So I don\u2019t know Yiddish, but not literally, I guess. And although in my\ntime there was already compuls \u2014 education was compulsory. But since I was born\nin the Czechoslovakian side, and I lived in Sighet, Romania, Mother denied me.\nEvery year before scrips \u2014 school, the \u2014 an official came and asked, well is \u2014 are\nthere children of school age, Mother could deny.",
        "Q: I see. This is a Romanian official, or Hungarian official?",
        "A: A Romanian official.",
        "Q: Romanian official, okay.",
        "A: But after the da \u2014 ma \u2014 the Hungarian came in, she couldn\u2019t deny. She was afraid\nto deny me because that would be [indecipherable]. So she burst out, she\nacknowledged, she confessed that she have. And then became [indecipherable] I\nwas already almost [indecipherable]. So with [indecipherable] with connections,\nJune 13, 2014\nthey let me do private \u2014 there were the four question \u2014 the four classes. So I think I\ndid officially made the four classes.",
        "Q: How did \u2014 how did the Jews largely support themselves ak \u2014 you know, in \u2014 in\nSighet?",
        "A: Likely to?",
        "Q: How did \u2014 how did \u2014 how did the family, the Jewish families support\nthemselves?",
        "A: Depend. There were a few stor \u2014 a few rich Jews. I don\u2019t know, one of them was\nthe richest, name was Mandolovich(ph), he had a textile store. Not educated, but\nrich. But most of them were poor. Par \u2014 really poverty where e \u2014 bread was a\nlooked after item, seek \u2014 seek after item.",
        "Q: What did you typically have for dinner, for instance?",
        "A: Well, when things worked, we did have chicken \u2014 we did have meat, no, chicken\nwas a\u2014 we used to buy \u2014 go to the \u2014 to the place where butcher, where they sold\nmeat, and buy a cheap meat, and we used to eat soup. That was the \u2014 practically\nevery day. Shabbas, we needed more, because they had a tradition Shabbas ma-\nmahali(ph), Shabbas foods, Shabbas \u2014 and it was a problem that we had to\n[indecipherable] it up. But we ate enough, I nevertheless was not hungry, didn\u2019t go\naround town. But I couldn\u2019t afford eat the kind of food I wanted.\nJune 13, 2014",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you what \u2014 about one other resident of the town. I think it\u2019s fair\nto say you were probably the second most famous person to come from Sighet, but\nI understand you were also friends with Elie Wiesel.",
        "A: Yeah, we went to chayder together, very clo \u2014 he himself wrote somewhere that\nthe closest people have is his wife and Halivni.",
        "Q: Can you tell a \u2014 can you remember a little bit about what he was like when he\nwas a boy\u201d?",
        "A: Sure, I could tell you about it. He was a kind of sickly child, didn\u2019t always come\nto chayder. And he look \u2014 sit near the window and looked up at the window\n[indecipherable]. But he was bright, you could see he was bright. I sat near the\nRebbe. He was a kind of [indecipherable] he sat at the window. He did go to\nschool, so he knew Romanian. And from the Romanian, so close to French, that\u2019s\nwhy after the war, he picked up French as his language.",

        "Q: Mm-hm. Let me ask you, in the town where you were raised, was their much\nknowledge of the events in the outside world? What was happening in \u2014",
        "A: Very \u2014 very little.",
        "Q: \u2014 what was happening in Germany with the Nazis \u2014",
        "A: Very \u2014 very little. We did know there were a few pe \u2014 one or two person who\ncame back Brest-Litovsk. The Hungarians, in \u201943, or \u201944, before the general\ndeportation, deported some people who were \u2014 were not citizens of \u2014 and they\nbrought them on the Polish side, Brest-Litovsk, where the Germans shot them and\nthat. One ot \u2014 including my father, came back. I don\u2019t know, he smuggled the way\nback. And they told of this. But that only \u2014 they wasn\u2019t supposed to speak about it,\nso only a few days ago la \u2014 only single out individual, you know, and that. But the\nidea was, I still remember it, tha-that that wouldn\u2019t happen in \u2014 in Hungary,\nHorthy was the \u2014 the \u2014 worl \u2014 one \u2014 wa \u2014 law and order, and he will protect, and so",

I remember \u2014 what I think is that when we \u2014 told\nus to leave the ghetto, and we were \u2014 we were ord \u2014 form 1n a line, in \u2014 1n the\noutside, before they took out to the shul.

I mean,\nyou could imagine, was \u2014 they were crowded, there were no facilities for the doing\n\u2014 and \u2014 and there was some kind of disciplines. But this \u2014 we had thought this until\nwe go to work. Once you wor-wor \u2014 go to work, it difficult.

        "Q: So there were people on the train that knew about the gas chambers?",
        "A: No, no gas chambers, they knew they lead to Poland and that \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014\nthey thought that we would have gone to Germany, we probably would work. If we\nwent to Poland, there is no order. There 1s no \u2014",

And then there was the\n[indecipherable] the one who \u2014 who on the way met me, he says [speaks Yiddish].\nLet us hold on and go together. And as soon as he said, he was \u2014 and we were down\nbefore Mengele, that was [indecipherable]. So grandfather he sent on the death\nJune 13, 2014\nside. The [indecipherable] was a young man in the 30s, he probably would have\nsend him on this side. But he told him something, I couldn\u2019t hear. I assume he may\nhave seen all his important [indecipherable], including the president going in that\nside all together. So he pushed him in that side, and that\u2019s the \u2014 and then he turns to\nme and says, und du? And he had the \u2014 had the \u2014 a piece of, what 1s it? A piece of \u2014\nmade out of wood, a kind of \u2014 he hit me with that. You know, what\u2019s \u2014",

So \u2014 and then we \u2014 I was in Auschwitz only a few days. I\nJune 13, 2014\nwas told afterwards, I had \u2014 couldn\u2019t even verify that, that when a transport came \u2014\nand we\u2019re talking primarily Hungarian trans \u2014 when a transport came, the tho \u2014 to\nAuschwitz I\u2019m talking, the authorities contact places in Germany, asking them\nwhether they need \u2014 whether they need workers.",

No \u2014 there na \u2014 there was no place that\nwere looking for workers. And since transports with Hungarian Jews came one after\nanother, they killed those transport.

        "A: Yeah, was a forebo \u2014 no, but he did not have foreboding. And the things \u2014 it was\na \u2014 usually, after the war, and so on, there\u2019s always problems of \u2014 of agunot(ph)\n[coughs]",

So I st \u2014 to this day know who was the\nfirst victim, but he never \u2014 and he didn\u2019t \u2014 he didn\u2019t, of course, survive, and neither\ndid his wife, survive.",
        "Q: What did you \u2014 what did you do in the camp?",
        "A: Well, depends. That I \u2014 I think that there was very, very crucial and lam \u2014 to the\nsurvival, how do you tell. I was interested purely in \u2014 in survival. So much so, I\nthink I mentioned in the book, in the memoirs, but that\u2019s worth me mentioning\nagain. There was, in my neighborhood in Sighet, there was another family, by the\nname of Dupe(ph). Their son \u2014 they had a son on my age, a little old \u2014 a little o-\nJune 13, 2014\nolder, a year, who went to the gymnasium, was over there, who went to school,\nwhich I hadn't. Who did exercise at school, at [indecipherable] who was robust,\nand so on. I was pale. What did they expect, I sat all day long and was in the \u2014 in\nthe synagogue [indecipherable] closed doors, what \u2014 closed windows. I remember\nwhen I \u2014 we came to Wolfsberg, he was sitting there, and we went to work. He uses\nthe muscles, so to speak, at the beginning. We were shoveling, and \u2014 and he looks at\nme, and he couldn\u2019t resist, and said, what will happen?",
        "Q: You said what will happen?",
        "A: No, he ask me, he was robust \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 and he was able to work. And he sometimes even got in some extra piece, for\nthe extra \u2014 or bread, for the work. My policy was not to work, not to strain myself\n[indecipherable]. He said \u2014",
        "Q: You do the minimal, to make sure you survive.",
        "A: Oh yeah, just when the SS looked, I looked \u2014 I \u2014 this \u2014 my shovel moved. He\nsaid [indecipherable]. How would you survive like this? Well, sometimes later \u2014\nwe were already neighbors there, which is the other [indecipherable], his father\nwas with him. Can never forget that. One day the father tells me \u2014 we were sitting \u2014\nstanding near each other. Look at Ossie(ph) \u2014 Oscar was his name. He was already\nJune 13, 2014\nwhat we call the Muselmann.

Then the father told me \u2014 he was our\nneighbor [indecipherable] those were his words. You will survive. Was the second\ntime he told me. You will survive. See what happened to Ossie(ph). You will come\nhome, tell my cousin \u2014 he named him \u2014 what happened here. And exactly next\nmorning, Ossie(ph) was already dead.",
        "Q: Cause he had exerted himself so much, that he was so weak?",
        "A: I think the exertion, without the nu \u2014 without compensa \u2014 without nu-nutrition,\nand other things, health things. He didn\u2019t make it.",
        "Q: What was the nature of the work, what was going on in the camp? What was the",
        "A: Oh, the different camps had different the work, more different. I was working\nwith the shovel. We dug. The \u2014 the \u2014 the bi \u2014 the \u2014 the work was usually, at least in\nmy case \u2014 the Germans built tunnels for int \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 they dig tunnels to build\nfactor \u2014 ammunitional factories against \u2014 against bombing.",

        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s simple [indecipherable]. We went in then, the particular place and made a\nhole, dig a big hole. And then hole was dynamited, and then we came again.

Til then, my job was to look at the SS, in\nJune 13, 2014\norder that he doesn\u2019t ca-catch me not working. You know, when we came to camp,\nwe had to make sure we had to have a place to sleep, and everything 1s there. So I\nhad no \u2014 no time to \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have any kind of \u2014 did you co \u2014 were you able to continue any kind of\nreligious practice in the camp?",
        "A: Religious?",
        "Q: Yes, did you \u2014 did you mark the Shabbat [indecipherable] did you mark any\nhigh holidays?",
        "A: Well \u2014 well \u2014 well, we know it\u2019s Shabbat religious, and the \u2014 the problem was\nPesach [indecipherable] Yom Kippur. You know about the davening, you know,\nthe bletl.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I know with the davening that they allowed us Kol Nidre.",
        "Q: They allowed you Kol Nidre?",
        "A: Yes, but otherwise, we were working. So there was about \u2014 like almost none.",
        "Q: Te-Te-Tell me the story about the bletl. I know it\u2019s in your book, but I think P\u2019'd\nlike to \u2014 I'd like to record the story.",
        "A: Well, to record the story, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 there was a \u2014 start from the very beginning.\nThe \u2014 technically, we had off every second Sunday, but we did not \u2014 but they did\nJune 13, 2014\nnot really realized it. The al \u2014 the SS always found an excuse. Supposedly we are\nvolunteering. But the \u2014 nevertheless, it happened a few sunda \u2014 a few hours where\nwe could sit and \u2014 and do nothing, the SS didn\u2019t bother us. So there was the ca \u2014 the\n\u2014 th-the \u2014 the ca \u2014 the people that worked, it\u2019s called \u2014 1t was called Ackerman(ph)\nwho do the drilling, and who had th \u2014 they had kapo, also the name of Weiss. And\nwhen we were sitting that do \u2014 that Sunday, or that \u2014 we sort of \u2014 supposedly free\nSunday, he was [indecipherable] and we talked, I remembered what we learned in\nsi\u2014 the [indecipherable] of sha \u2014 Sh-Shabbat, because the people knew it from the\nbook, from the prayer book and so on. And I was sort of a leader. He saw that, and\nsort of decided that he\u2019ll take me in in his company. Ackerman(ph), who was doing\nthe \u2014 it was a very difficult company, and therefore, while the others worked 12\nhours and na \u2014 they worked only 10. And the occasion, sometimes they even got\ncigarettes from the company, from \u2014 so when I got cigarettes, I sold it for bread. So,\nthe idea was why \u2014 why would they take me to a company which worked so ha \u2014\nwas more difficult than the others? Because those drillers, you know, that made the\nhole, had to be sharpened. And they didn\u2019t want that to be bring to a fire, to a\nschmidder(ph) \u2014 to a smith. They wa \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to do it in the ca \u2014 1n the \u2014\nin the \u2014 in the tunnel itself, fire, so it was outside. So somebody had to bring those\ndri-driller to the schmi \u2014 where they sharpened, and bring it back, two or three\nJune 13, 2014\ntimes, or more times during a \u2014 a night, let\u2019s say. So, if I\u2014 and usually chose the\nyoungest \u2014 I was the youngest \u2014 to do that work. That mean that was much easier,\nand I also \u2014 the person also got the benefits, because the company did not notice.\nSo, he took me in \u2014 into that \u2014 in his company, and I had those privilege. So, during\nmy \u2014 at night, when we worked at night, I used to do four or five times, going\nthrough from a \u2014 from the \u2014 the place of work, inside the hotel, pending \u2014 every day\nit got larger and larger, to the outside where they were sharpened, and bring it back,\nand so on. That\u2019s why I said before, I walked with [indecipherable]. I had to be\nvery careful, because when the other people took out the \u2014 the stones, the \u2014 the \u2014 the\npla \u2014 the \u2014 where the dynamite exploded, they had then a ca \u2014 a little cheela(ph)\nthey called, a ca \u2014a little [indecipherable] car \u2014 cars, so \u2014 and there was hardly any\nroom for a car or for a human being, had to \u2014 there were cases where people\n[indecipherable]. So, on the way, there was, 1n a crossroad, there was a German,\nwho was not a German, was a toad. That means \u2014 toad mean one of Volksdeutsche,\nwith that \u2014 deutsche was really his mother tongue, you could s \u2014 you could\nrecognize. If he was a Volksdeutsche from Poland, he spo \u2014 if he spoke German, it\nwas on the Polish accent. So we knew \u2014",
        "Q: He was a Pole.",
        "A: What?\nJune 13, 2014",
        "Q: He was Polish.",
        "A: He was \u2014 but he was German.",

        "Q: I see, okay.",
        "A: What? Volksdeutsche \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s called. And I used to \u2014 because some night, I met him a few times. I had to\nlift up my miitze, my hat at that procedure. One night I walked, and that time I\u2019m\nbeginning to \u2014 I even discuss \u2014 I remember what I was thinking about. I described\nthat too, some [indecipherable] interesting [indecipherable] Talmudic question.\n[indecipherable]. And I saw them, they used to eat the in \u2014 in between, and in the\nnight too, but I saw he had his \u2014 his food is on a ripped and a sh \u2014 page of Shulchan\nAruch, I remember [indecipherable] Pesach [indecipherable] and the \u2014 the laws\nof Pesach, and I remembered even the \u2014 the particular law, whether you could do it\nthrough an agency, an agent and I \u2014 I \u2014 I [indecipherable] and I fell to his feet, and\nI asked him to give me the bletl. It was \u2014 it was saturated from fat, but he took out\nthe \u2014 the [indecipherable] whatever. [indecipherable] and then he gave it to me,\nand I brought it to camp. But then, as I said, there was a danger that the Germans\nJune 13, 2014\nwere \u2014 you couldn\u2019t carry anything, contraband. So a Jew by the name of fines \u2014\nFinkelstein, I think he was from Martasalka(ph), that\u2019s a particular community, he\ncarried it on his \u2014 on his body. When we came back to camp first, we used to \u2014 if\nthere\u2019s a free Sunday, we could il \u2014 use it. But month later when we went to Eb-\nEbensee, you know the eb \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And there it was a total different. There was a vernichtungslager, extermination\ncamp. And I saw him from a distance, and I asked them, motioned them what\u2019s\nhappened, and they knocked on the [indecipherable]. And then I was told two or\nthree hours later he collapsed, and he was taken to the camp \u2014 to the mislaifa(ph),\nand he was burned together with the bletl.",

        "Q: You know, one thing that was interesting was that \u2014 that I \u2014 that I was curious\nabout from your memotr, 1s that a number of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the kapos seemed to\nbe interested in you, and \u2014",

And there is \u2014 just a minute \u2014 and there is a\nstory, which I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t mention it, I didn\u2019t know, and I think I\u2019m use this\nopportunity to mention. I \u2014 one day already in bo \u2014 in \u2014 still in Wolfsberg, one day\na rumor had it tha-that they taking kid \u2014 children \u2014 kids my age to peel potatoes.\nYou don\u2019t know what that meant. First it meant warm. Usually you\u2019re in the\nkitchen, you peel potatoes. Secondly you have what \u2014 you have food. It\u2019s\n[indecipherable]. You could throw it in the yidda(ph), you could throw it in the\novens. So, it was one of the most desired jobs. So I smuggled my \u2014 not smuggled, I\nJune 13, 2014\njoined them. I went and sat down where they were supposed to meet. The assistant,\nthe vice-director, a short fellow, he had [indecipherable]. You could imagine, if he\nhad \u2014 had that position in camp, he was not a \u2014 a [indecipherable] he was not \u2014 he\nwas known a certain ruth \u2014 ruthle \u2014",
        "Q: Ruthlessness.",
        "A: \u2014 ruthlessness. He took me out. I \u2014 the second time I went, I smuggled them\nagain.

And he took me out a second time. So I saw it\u2019s useless. Then it turned out\nthat they were \u2014 they weren\u2019t taken to peel potatoes, they were to be killed. Now, I\ndidn\u2019t write in the memoir because I didn\u2019t \u2014 and I don\u2019t know today either, what \u2014\nwhy. Why would this man, who was basically cruel and inconsiderate, why would\nhe take out? Why did he even know me? The only explanation I have is that the one\nwho \u2014 they only took somebody take care of their needs, household needs, other\nneed, took care of his house, and cooked, and so on, was from Sighet.

And, first of\nall, I\u2014I know you talk about this a little bit, but I would like to put it on the table.\nWhy do you take the name Halivni?",
        "A: Well, to \u2014 two reasons. One, I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 the semi-objective reason, if you want to\ncall that objective, and Weiss being \u2014 there was an SS commander of Treblinka, by\nthe name of Weiss. And then I encountered a person \u2014 SS by the name of Weiss. So\nI decided that\u2019s a good reason for \u2014 for dropping that name Weiss. But \u2014 but I\ncouldn\u2019t do that because grandfather was very close to me. On the other hand,\nWeiss [indecipherable] father\u2019s name was Weiderman(ph). So We-Weiss, I make\nhim forget [indecipherable]. So by using a biblical word, it\u2019s not a name in the\nBible. Yes, it is a name, sorry, it is a name. But Halivni [indecipherable] Halivni.\nSo I used to use it both names, in the book says both name. But now that I went to\nIsrael, in Israel I don\u2019t use both names, only Halivni.",
        "Q: You know, you\u2019re reminding me something I wanted to ask you about your\nfather, because we talked about him at the beginning of the interview. I wa \u2014 I\nremembered a story that I wonder if you have more details about, because I found it\nJune 13, 2014\nso interesting, that when he was being transported to Auschwitz, he managed to\nsend you a letter.",
        "A: Yeah, he send out the second time. First he was imported as a known citizen, and\nhe came back the part. And then he was sending a letter. He\u2019d apparently dropped\nthe letter in the train, I don\u2019t \u2014",

        "Q: Why did you make the decision to come to America?",
        "A: Because that\u2019s what I said before, I wanted so much to study, circular\nknowledge, circular [indecipherable] and I was afraid not having any relative,\nanybody, that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it in Israel.

So \u2014 though \u2014 so that maybe I\u2019m \u2014 if that is the case, then it \u2014\nthen that should be more investigated, more study with the inner connection.

        "A: The \u2014 then \u2014 then that is [indecipherable] answer. I think I told you that when I\n\u2014 I mentioned the book, when I came to the States, I met the late Moshe\nMyzels(ph). You remember that?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

Were\nyou religious before the war? [indecipherable]. Said yes. He says, I understand that\npeople religious before, are religious after. They\u2019re religious before, religious aft \u2014\nthe people that don\u2019t \u2014 that remain the same way, they either no [indecipherable]\nnothing happened? [indecipherable]. No, of course it\u2019s modified, but I never broke\nwith the religion. Although my religion is proba \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s not the same way, I\nJune 13, 2014\nwould say, as Sighet, I mean, even as grandfather. The learning is certainly not, and\nthat\u2019s so \u2014 but that could have a na \u2014 could have happened anyhow, even without\nthe Holocaust, just going to college, learning secular the boo \u2014 reading secular\nbooks and so on. So it\u2019s not to \u2014 to the Holocaust particularly. The \u2014 I don\u2019t ever,\never kind of angry \u2014 I not remember being angry at somebody, at something for the\nHolocaust, even though my \u2014 now I have this book on [indecipherable] Holocaust,\nand I mi \u2014 if I only finish. I may write more on that topic, I haven\u2019t finished that. I\nwas probably influenced a great deal, but that may even be subconscious, you\nknow, the whole \u2014",
        "Q: You know, I was really interested in something that you wrote in your book, that\nI wil \u2014 that I wanted to just ask you about, cause you wrote the book maybe 20\nyears ago, and you wrote about \u2014 you made a statement that the Holocaust should\nbe treated as an event without explanation. That \u2014 that you increase the suffering of\nthe victims, and the survivors by asking \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 how or why this event could have happened. And I\u2019m wondering if \u2014 if that is\na Statement you still believe?",
        "A: Well, yes and no, as everything is a yes and no answer. That was a \u2014 that\u2019s in the\nmemoirs. That was a sort of a protest against those \u2014 and I am still firmly against it,\nJune 13, 2014\nwho considered the Holocaust the result of sin. That, I think is unforgiveable for the\n\u2014 the survivors, for the sufferer, and u \u2014 and unforgiveable for the truth, objective\ntruth. If you say that it is sin, that means it was coming to them. I often quote, and I\nth \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the mishna(ph), and [indecipherable] says that, if the court\nexecuted somebody, the family of the convict, family of the \u2014 should come to the\ncourt, to the judges, and say [speaks foreign language]. We have nothing against\nour hearts on you. In other words, justice, 1t was coming. We almost have to g-go \u2014\ncome Hitler and say we have nothing [indecipherable] it\u2019s because of sin. So that I\nreject, full-hearted. So although not as successful for a substitute, we don\u2019t have\nsomething that I could substitute. So, the idea is, leave it. Leave it as it is. That\u2019s\nwhy [indecipherable] without a reason. Because any reason will ultimately \u2014\nwhether, you know, the Rabbi of [indecipherable], who se \u2014 by the way, I was\nclose to him, I was close to him. The Rabbi [indecipherable] thought the Zionist is\nthe sin. And some people are bor \u2014 rabbis in Israel thought the \u2014 the anti-Zionists.\nWe must say, I do insist that the Holocaust is a metaphysical. Certainly it\u2019s not\nbecause they were \u2014 some Jews were communists, or some Jews were capitalists.\nOr the way they say \u2014 said that in the New Testament, that when Jesus was\ncrucified, the \u2014 th-the Jewish leaders had made that blood [indecipherable] on\nJune 13, 2014\nthem and on their children, 2,000 years ago. But my problem at the moment is to\nmake it metaphysical, in a way that human beings are not the cause.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: That I am working on.",
        "Q: Well, let \u2014 let me follow up in this way, you know, Elie Wiesel [break] \u2014 they\njust have a technical problem.",

Oh, okay,\nI\u2019m sorry. So, what I wanted to ask you is, do you think there\u2019s anything \u2014 cause\nWiesel has talked about \u2014 you know, one of the reasons he wanted this museum to\nbe formed, was he wanted to, obviously have a permanent memorial to the victims,\nbut also to remind people about what can happen in the future. And so my question\nto you 1s, the Holocaust was a unique event in human history, but do you think there\nis something to learn from that episode that might help us prevent this kind of thing\nfrom happening in the future? Maybe not on the same level, but the same kind \u2014\ngenocides have existed \u2014",
        "A: That was the topic that Yad Vashem asked me to talk about here a year ago, or\ntwo years ago. What\u2019s the most effective way of preserving the \u2014 the \u2014 Holocaust?\nJune 13, 2014\nI\u2019m not \u2014 and I\u2019m saying this with great caution should be misunderstood, then. I\u2019m\nnot sure that \u2014 that we could be sure that there will be no other Holocaust, since, as I\nsaid before, I think it\u2019s a metaphysical. Has something to do with free will. Man is\ncreated in a manner at least that \u2014 that he could do \u2014 God would not interfere \u2014 will\npunish him, but He will not interfere with this evildoing. So, to ask, which is the\nbasic question for a religious person, why God did not intervene in our time, when\nintervened in \u2014 intervened in the time of Haman. The idea that something moved in\nthe cosmological sphere, that caw \u2014 that God did not intervene. He intervened at\nthat time, did not intervene. So, we cannot be \u2014 I think sometimes even Netanyahu\nor the others, 1t was naive to think that an Israeli, the Israeli power, military, could\nprevent Hitler. Whoever remens \u2014 remembers the power of the German army \u2014\nnow we have this Normandy, just what 1s it, 70 years?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: You \u2014 you really thinks that Israel could have prevented the German army? So\nwe are \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I am still working find out what is sort of \u2014 but it is our\nrelationship to God, Jews, as I still believe was the chosen people, but they are\nchosen because God gave the Torah. And giving the Torah 1s a sort of intervene \u2014\nintervention in a u\u20141n a person\u2019s life. God intervened \u2014 asked \u2014 intervenes in our\nlife by telling us what to do, what not to do. And therefore, He may intervene in our\nJune 13, 2014\nfavor. When we are not following this part, sort of the bargain, the other part is not\n\u2014 it\u2019s quite complicated. It\u2019s not that simple.",

        "A: Well, that we are a unique people. I know Rwanda, I know the other thing, but\nnot at that size, and that [indecipherable]. Our relationship to God, and therefore\nour relationship to the world is o \u2014 the way religion claimed all along, although not\n\u2014 religion may claim your details [indecipherable] that we have a particular\nrelationship, and we should find out, particularly what \u2014 the channel by which it\nmoves. And that may be the only way we\u2019ll prevent. Look I am \u2014 I\u2019m troubled and\n\u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and puzzled.

[indecipherable] the \u2014 involves responsibility as\nwell as \u2014 as co \u2014 as singling out, and so on. Now, God will intervene on our behalf,\napparently if we have \u2014 we \u2014 we are in debt, a certain \u2014 and maintaining a certain\n[indecipherable] for certain relationship. That is a very delicate balance. When that\nrelationship is disturbed, God may not intervene.

        "A: That\u2019s an interesting question. It\u2019s a difficult question. What do \u2014 you can ask\nme what do you do during the Holocaust day. Almost feel \u2014 I mean thank \u2014 I mean\nobviously, thank for the survival. There is no \u2014 I mean, there must be a reason, there\nJune 13, 2014\nis [indecipherable] a reason, but not a known reason at all why I survived and \u2014\nand Dupe(ph), who was stronger and fatter, the \u2014 Mother used to come home from\n\u2014 from their home, visiting them, always that argument, why are you so \u2014 why are\nyou so pale?

So, does that entail a special\nobligation, a special tha \u2014 usually that \u2014 that leads, or should lead to more learning,\nbut that\u2019s individual, and \u2014 and that\u2019s usu \u2014 the [indecipherable] having\naccomplished something.

        "Q: Okay.",

A woman who had children, with cha\n\u2014a child, came to the ramp, you know \u2014 you know, in the \u2014 she apparently had\npresence of mind, and she realized what\u2019s \u2014 at least that there 1s a \u2014 she handed over\nthe child to her mother, or mother-in-law. I came across this, I don\u2019t vouch for its\nveracity. An SS saw that and came over and gave her moussat(ph). So, how do you\nJune 13, 2014\nleave a child. Don\u2019t you see what\u2019s going on there? How do you leave the child like\nthis? She took back the child, and of course Mengele send her to the other side.

The \u2014 they asked\nthe \u2014 you know, there was a, how did they get the gas? Not inside, because they\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 from outside, there was a little window. So they interviewed, I think in a\nGerman ta \u2014 TV, asking them, how \u2014 when did \u2014 did they know to open up the \u2014 the\nwindow, have the gas in there?

        "Answer: Well, I was born in a little village, which changed hands a number of\ntimes. It was called Poliana Kobyletska. Poliana, p-o-l-y-n, koba, k-o-b \u2014 koba,\nb-e-l-e-c-k-y, that\u2019s how I spell it. At that time, when I was born, it was\nCzechoslovakia. Then for a while after the war, it was Russia. Now it\u2019s Ukraine.\nBut my father got there because \u2014 which 1s interesting \u2014 all of a sudden \u2014 that\u2019s\nwhat people told me, a wonder rabbi appeared.",
        "A: Yes. Supposedly he performed miracles. He knew a person, the ba \u2014 sickness,\nwhich 1s always the platform for wonder people, you know, to heal, to \u2014 and my f \u2014\nand he needed somebody to set up his \u2014 his sel \u2014 activities, and my father was\nchosen, and therefore he moved to \u2014 he \u2014 he settled in Poliana, in Ponya(ph), and\nhe moved there. And of course, I was there, I was born there. I tell it because all of\na sudden, two or three years later, he ceased performing miracles, and the whole\nJune 13, 2014\nthing evaporated, and there was no \u2014 there was no reason for my grandfather \u2014 for\nmy father any more to stay there, and we moved away from there, we moved to a\nbigger city called Houst(ph) or Hist(ph), Houst(ph). May I also tell you, I think it\u2019s\ninteresting, you \u2014 you'll decide what you want do with this story. After this he\nbecame paralyzed, and nobody even know where \u2014 what happened then. The whole\nthing, the whole \u2014 there were only 50 families, Jewish families in \u2014 in that village,\nand if he left, th \u2014",
        "A: Whole bo-body, th \u2014 we need \u2014 and people didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t hear from him, I\ndidn\u2019t know what happened. And then, a few month before deportation, in \u00b044, I got\na message he appeared, reappeared. Must have been in an institution the meantime,\nI don\u2019t know. He reappeared, and asked to be \u2014 he wants to see me. I was come pa \u2014\nI was [indecipherable] outside my narrow \u2014 he must have heard, he wants to come.",
        "A: Fifteen or 16.",
        "A: No, I\u2014 my father, we \u2014 we do \u2014 Ill come to it.\nJune 13, 2014",
        "A: I\u2014I just want that \u2014 you don\u2019t have to mention, but it\u2019s interesting. I \u2014 he came\nto see me, he want to come and see me, in a wheelchair, of course. As soon as he\nopened the door, he burst out into tears loudly, and he couldn\u2019t speak. Tried to\nbreak into \u2014 hold a conversation, to engage in something, and didn\u2019t come out. So\nmuch so that said goodbye, and we left. Few month later, there were \u2014 we were \u2014\nthe deportation to Auschwitz. I\u2019m always asking myself, what was the \u2014 the \u2014 the\ncause for that \u2014 what shall I say? Thunder, kind of flood of tears that came out?\nCould it be that I reminded him of the years when he had power, and that caused\nthat? Or, he still had some power, and he knew about the deportation. He knew I\nhad [indecipherable] time. In any case, a few month later \u2014 later, of course he was\ndeported, and he was \u2014 so, let me go back. My father left, went back to Houst(ph),\nand we lived in Houst(ph) two or three years, and then my mother and father broke\nup, and the age four or five \u2014 I was born in \u201927 \u2014 the age of four or five, we \u2014\nMother left Father, and we went to Sighet, where my grandfather lived. It was in\nSighet that I was brought up, and I lived there with grandfather. Finally they were\ndivorced. Til Mengele separated grandfather from me, you know, the \u2014",
        "A: Right, he is the \u2014 the \u2014 I do say, I say it in the book. There are two people who\nhad the influence. One was the grandfather, who was a er \u2014 great Talmud scholar,\nbut old-fashioned, if I may use the word [indecipherable] the old-fashioned, but the\n\u2014 who \u2014 who \u2014 who taught themself [indecipherable] at night, he used to give a\u2014a\nlesson [indecipherable] Talmud. And \u2014 and he brought me up, that\u2019s the male\nfigure that I know. He was very poor, he could hardly support me and my mom, my\nmother and another sister. But he was then a great influence, that he taught me how\nto learn on a simple, elementary level. And he was a shochet, he was a Belzer\nshochet, with uniform, with a kapoto(ph), you know what\u2019s a kapoto(ph) and\n[indecipherable] so from secular knowledge, or secular activity, he had no idea,\nthere was no \u2014 it\u2019s no \u2014 he didn\u2019t \u2014 you can\u2019t even see he rejected it because he had\nno dealings, or that. So I was brought up, and of course, along these lines. And then\npeople asked \u2014 even today asked me how \u2014 where it comes from. I can\u2019t answer the\nquestion. Since I remember, even when I was five or six years, and lived under the\ninfluence of grandfather, I wanted to study secular knowledge. I wanted to have\nsecular knowledge.",
        "A: Not at all.\nJune 13, 2014",
        "A: That\u2019s what they \u2014 people asking me, where did that come. Maybe you will see\nwhat you could do with that. When I was a chi \u2014 five, six years even, and I used to\npray, daven, and I said the prayer [indecipherable] God give us in our heart,\nunderstanding, to understand you and so on. I remember I used to look at the\nwindow, signifying outside knowledge as well, not only religious knowledge.\nWhere I got that \u2014 that urge, I don\u2019t know. That really, after the war, after the\nliberation, that was the reason I didn\u2019t go to Israel. I wanted \u2014 was afraid I wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to study there, I didn\u2019t know, secular knowledge, so I went to the United\nStates where the \u2014 so \u2014 so I had the \u2014 but then I was \u2014 so grandfather had the\nenormous influence, other than some ideas. I was never a shochet, never believed in\nthe [indecipherable], even though grandfather used to tell miracles, and the\n[indecipherable]. And then, of course, that lasted til \u2014 til \u201944, and then \u00b044, the\nother person that had the influence on me, was Professor Saul Lieberman, who\nwas the great \u2014 the great Talmud scholars. And then eventually I adopted the more\nscientific, or the more critical approach \u2014 could tell you I \u2014 to the study of Talmud,\nwhich I now write, teach, preach.\nJune 13, 2014",
        "A: Yes, I remember exactly. When I felt that the first ttme \u2014 when others felt that,\nhow old was I? Was I seven? Around there, give or take. I used to go every Friday\nwith grandfather to take a bath. We had no pi \u2014 we didn\u2019t had hot water in the\nhouse, we had to warm it up [indecipherable]. So once a week, Friday, as you\ncould imagine, we went, and there was ambatya(ph), a bath. We had to pay for it,\nand grand \u2014 but the \u2014 I was allowed for the two of us, he and me to use the same \u2014\nthe same bath. One day \u2014 one week \u2014 one Friday \u2014 be th-there was a seat there, I\nremember, and there were two \u2014 what\u2019s the English word for ambatya(ph)?

        "A: Yeah, the bathtub 1s good enough. I remember the bathtub in there was two, kind\nof place to sit, and I\u2014 we got up on the bathtub, and I tell grandfather, I remember, I\ncould tell you the name of all generation, the name of the generations, since the\nJune 13, 2014\ntime of Adam, the first person, til King David. [indecipherable] And I gave him\nthe list, I still remember it. And that \u2014",

I was \u2014 later on I\nlearned Talmud, at the age of nine, 10, I knew 200 pages [indecipherable] by heart.\nAnd I came to a city, it\u2019s called Vishiva, my late wife came from there. And a man\nby the name of Lefkowich(ph), Bartka(ph) Lefkowich(ph) I think it was.\nYakabowich(ph).

For a poor \u2014 for me, that was considerable money. So I told him. And I\nwas stretching out my hand to get money. He turns to me, he says, how do I know\nthat you are right? I remember it to this day, over here, I \u2014 I have \u2014 that was taken\nback, that he \u2014 he has such a [indecipherable] question. He \u2014 I \u2014 but I wanted the\nmoney, and he was willing to give, so I told him, if I\u2019ll tell you the 10, the 15, the\n20\" and the 25\", would you give me the money? No, don\u2019t want.\nJune 13, 2014",

        "A: Our ten \u2014 two weeks ago, less than two weeks, it was 70 years that she and\ngrandfather and my sister and Aunt Ani(ph) arrived at Auschwitz. And really I was\nthinking, trying even to remember, I remembered that she would kiss me and\npassionately \u2014 I don\u2019t remember. She was suffering. She had the daughter who was\nparalyzed.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: My sister.\nJune 13, 2014",
        "A: Laysha(ph) was her name. She died afterwards a natural death, but that, of\ncourse, made life much more miserable. She was relatively intelligent, she had a\nHungarian [indecipherable]. She had ambition, she was a \u2014 which were never\nrealized. So, she was religious. So finally she was claimed by the crematoria, when\nshe came. That was [indecipherable]. And then I was together with the aunt, she\nhad a sister. The problem was that when we came to grandfather, we were four\npeople; grandfather and the three children. I had a sister, and I\u2019m one \u2014 the sick\nsister, and myself, and she and the mother, we were four people. Grandfather, with\ndifficulty, could support us, which made \u2014 cal \u2014 created tension. We had really no\nfull job. So we ca \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we came to gr-gr-grand-mother, she had to\n[indecipherable] in the \u2014 the \u2014 the kitchen, they have, of course, and the \u2014 the\nhousehold, and so on. But she was always \u2014 always a sense of bitterness. But the\nproblem was when we came the grandfather, 1n addition to the poverty, he had two\nstill unmarried daughters. And in those time, marriageable \u2014 to marriage, to get\ndowry, was not an easy \u2014 one easy thing. And the \u2014 and that, of course, added\ntension to the house, which I [indecipherable] occasionally used to shout at me,\nthen the other \u2014 I was convinced that they were against me. And then finally one got\nmarried, and faced a tragedy; husband died within two or three years. But the other\ndaughter came with me, though shu \u2014 she must have been about in the late 20s, you\nJune 13, 2014\ncould imagine those days, probably [indecipherable] to explain, you\u2019ll understand.\nI thought she\u2019s against me, and there is nothing I could do. But I knew that if you\nmake a Mi Shebeirach, you know what a Mi Shebeirach is? When you read the\nTorah, if you want ask for health, or for anything, you read \u2014 you make \u2014 ask for a\nspecial blessing while the Torah, the scroll is on the table, that has special \u2014 so as a\nchild, eight or nine, I thought that will work negatively too. If \u2019Il make a anti Mi\nShebeirach against it, she will \u2014 something.",
        "A: Something left. I didn\u2019t realize that when we arrived at Auschwitz 70 years ago,\nand they opened up the cars, and they shouted [speaks German] I apparently was\nnear the door, and I jumped out from among the first one on the \u2014 I heard the\nshouting after me in Yiddish [speaks Yiddish].

        "A: The \u2014 the city? The city \u2014",
        "A: The city was almost 10,000 Jews, mainly Hassidim. There were non-religious\nJews too, but I didn\u2019t know them, I found out after the war. Some of the youth were\ncommunists, like in other places. Religious. But I wa \u2014 I think I\u2019m making a\u2014a\ntruthful statement; when I came to Sighet when I was 40 years old, so that could be\n\u00b031 \u2014\u201932. There may have been seven \u2014 several hundred young people with payos.\nWhen I left Sighet in \u201944, there were less than 50. So this secularization\n[indecipherable] or the communization had enormous impact. The Jews were\ngenerally poor, all Hassidim of certain Rebbes, engaged in quarrel, in\n[indecipherable] as there is always between the Rebbes. And little \u2014 none \u2014 no\nconnection with the non-Jews. I \u2014 we \u2014 the language we spoke, and didn\u2019t even\nJune 13, 2014\nknow it, was Yiddish. I mean, I know Yiddish, how to go buy \u2014 buy in the \u2014 in the\nshop. But I didn\u2019t know [indecipherable] the Yiddish, I didn\u2019t even know that there\nis some Germans in Yiddish, I eventually found out that the German\u2019s in Yiddish.\nAfter the war I felt a kind of [indecipherable] a kind of poetic urge to write down,\njot down, but I know no language, only Yiddish. So I jotted down in Yiddish, and I\nwas embarrassed to show. But not long ago, I took it out, and they\u2019re translating it\nto French. So I don\u2019t know Yiddish, but not literally, I guess. And although in my\ntime there was already compuls \u2014 education was compulsory. But since I was born\nin the Czechoslovakian side, and I lived in Sighet, Romania, Mother denied me.\nEvery year before scrips \u2014 school, the \u2014 an official came and asked, well is \u2014 are\nthere children of school age, Mother could deny.",

So with [indecipherable] with connections,\nJune 13, 2014\nthey let me do private \u2014 there were the four question \u2014 the four classes. So I think I\ndid officially made the four classes.",

        "A: I know with the davening that they allowed us Kol Nidre.",
        "A: Yes, but otherwise, we were working. So there was about \u2014 like almost none.",
        "A: Well, to record the story, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 there was a \u2014 start from the very beginning.\nThe \u2014 technically, we had off every second Sunday, but we did not \u2014 but they did\nJune 13, 2014\nnot really realized it. The al \u2014 the SS always found an excuse. Supposedly we are\nvolunteering. But the \u2014 nevertheless, it happened a few sunda \u2014 a few hours where\nwe could sit and \u2014 and do nothing, the SS didn\u2019t bother us. So there was the ca \u2014 the\n\u2014 th-the \u2014 the ca \u2014 the people that worked, it\u2019s called \u2014 1t was called Ackerman(ph)\nwho do the drilling, and who had th \u2014 they had kapo, also the name of Weiss. And\nwhen we were sitting that do \u2014 that Sunday, or that \u2014 we sort of \u2014 supposedly free\nSunday, he was [indecipherable] and we talked, I remembered what we learned in\nsi\u2014 the [indecipherable] of sha \u2014 Sh-Shabbat, because the people knew it from the\nbook, from the prayer book and so on. And I was sort of a leader. He saw that, and\nsort of decided that he\u2019ll take me in in his company. Ackerman(ph), who was doing\nthe \u2014 it was a very difficult company, and therefore, while the others worked 12\nhours and na \u2014 they worked only 10. And the occasion, sometimes they even got\ncigarettes from the company, from \u2014 so when I got cigarettes, I sold it for bread. So,\nthe idea was why \u2014 why would they take me to a company which worked so ha \u2014\nwas more difficult than the others? Because those drillers, you know, that made the\nhole, had to be sharpened. And they didn\u2019t want that to be bring to a fire, to a\nschmidder(ph) \u2014 to a smith. They wa \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to do it in the ca \u2014 1n the \u2014\nin the \u2014 in the tunnel itself, fire, so it was outside. So somebody had to bring those\ndri-driller to the schmi \u2014 where they sharpened, and bring it back, two or three\nJune 13, 2014\ntimes, or more times during a \u2014 a night, let\u2019s say. So, if I\u2014 and usually chose the\nyoungest \u2014 I was the youngest \u2014 to do that work. That mean that was much easier,\nand I also \u2014 the person also got the benefits, because the company did not notice.\nSo, he took me in \u2014 into that \u2014 in his company, and I had those privilege. So, during\nmy \u2014 at night, when we worked at night, I used to do four or five times, going\nthrough from a \u2014 from the \u2014 the place of work, inside the hotel, pending \u2014 every day\nit got larger and larger, to the outside where they were sharpened, and bring it back,\nand so on. That\u2019s why I said before, I walked with [indecipherable]. I had to be\nvery careful, because when the other people took out the \u2014 the stones, the \u2014 the \u2014 the\npla \u2014 the \u2014 where the dynamite exploded, they had then a ca \u2014 a little cheela(ph)\nthey called, a ca \u2014a little [indecipherable] car \u2014 cars, so \u2014 and there was hardly any\nroom for a car or for a human being, had to \u2014 there were cases where people\n[indecipherable]. So, on the way, there was, 1n a crossroad, there was a German,\nwho was not a German, was a toad. That means \u2014 toad mean one of Volksdeutsche,\nwith that \u2014 deutsche was really his mother tongue, you could s \u2014 you could\nrecognize. If he was a Volksdeutsche from Poland, he spo \u2014 if he spoke German, it\nwas on the Polish accent. So we knew \u2014",

        "A: Cracks to see me there. But she said after I left, her gra \u2014 the father-in-law said\n[speaks foreign language] Zipporah. Whether that\u2019s true or not. But then we met.\nShe came to America, and we met in Brooklyn College. She\u2019s also graduated\nBrooklyn College.\nJune 13, 2014",

I heard from fro\n\u2014 from a chaplain who in America told me, and I assume \u2014 I have some documents\nwith the li \u2014 camps they were. They send me in with the \u2014 but my sister \u2014 the\nchaplain told me that he was in Bergen-Belsen after the war, and then there was a\nhospital with people there, and he met a woman who was already dilu \u2014 diluted \u2014\nnot diluted.",
        "A: What? Not delusional, but she was not well.",
        "A: And she told him that she had a brother who was a [indecipherable] and so on.\nAnd he thinks that fits me. If that 1s the case, then she died after the war, though.\nMother died in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Gra \u2014 with grandfather. And Father died, as I mentioned before, on the way to\nDachau. That\u2019s what I heard from people. And the aunt, I have her \u2014 her name\nappears on a list of camps, but it doesn\u2019t say when she died. Or does it? I have at\nhome.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t talk. I didn\u2019t talk after the war. I didn\u2019t talk after the war. But neither \u2014\nneither did I have people ask, I mean, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 it was no \u2014 talking or not talking\nwould not playing a role in my life. I didn\u2019t talk cause I was busy with \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 other things.",
        "A: But I do \u2014 people claim that my scholarship is that \u2014 somebody wrote an article \u2014\nmy scholarship is influenced by [indecipherable]. That this \u2014 that I\u2019m critical of \u2014\nin learning, which means you cri \u2014 critical in learning means that you interpret\ndifferently than \u2014\nJune 13, 2014",
        "A: It comes from the connection that you have no trust in human beings, that you\nbasically think human beings are corrupt.",
        "A: What could I know? In other words, you \u2014 a person who\u2019s more trustworthy, will\nnot look for new interpretation. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s that \u2014",
        "A: I assume that the theory goes \u2014 a man who [indecipherable] new interpretation,\nwho has 10 volumes almost now, with different interpretations. One who was not\nonly is not the [indecipherable] only, but the particular case [indecipherable] that\nconsideration about. So \u2014 though \u2014 so that maybe I\u2019m \u2014 if that is the case, then it \u2014\nthen that should be more investigated, more study with the inner connection. Of\ncourse, whenever somebody comes up with a new idea, not that \u2014 that something\nnew happened, but a n \u2014 a new idea of the things that already happened.",
        "A: There should be a reason why he\u2019s dissatisfied with the old. And therefore that\nmay \u2014 that may fit.",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think it is \u2014 1t was a sort of a break. More that in the beginning I\njust \u2014 there was no ca \u2014 I was too busy with something else. [indecipherable] going\nto school, living alone, and so on.",
        "A: No, no, they were \u2014 since my wife was also \u2014 she was a Holocaust scholar.",
        "A: She wrote \u2014 so it was a \u2014 in the house \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 so to speak all that time, was nothing that \u2014 not what happened to some people\nthat they\u2019re all of a sudden \u2014 practically all of a sudden begin to talk, and then talk\naba \u2014 and then some of them couldn\u2019t stop talking.",
        "A: No, there wasn\u2019t this here, there was \u2014 gradually I had more an opportunity. So I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 I think, I\u2019m not correct on a -- Fortunoff(ph), you\nknow, the \u2014 the \u2014 had \u2014 gave money for the college people to talk, as that \u2014 they had\nthen [indecipherable] and they had the \u2014 made something, a party, or a \u2014 and they\nasked me to talk, so I ta\u2014 they didn\u2019t ask me talk about my talking, but to talk about\nth \u2014 the [indecipherable]. So I realized that that time, more than before, how much\nJune 13, 2014\nthat is a problem, that it needs to be encouraged. The \u2014 but personally, I always\nread, and I still avidly, wherever I could, read about the Holocaust.",
        "A: Oh, well that \u2014 you assume it did affect.",
        "A: The \u2014 then \u2014 then that is [indecipherable] answer. I think I told you that when I\n\u2014 I mentioned the book, when I came to the States, I met the late Moshe\nMyzels(ph). You remember that?",
        "A: He was the \u2014 he was the editor of [indecipherable] Hebrew magazine. He asked\nme, are you religious now, you know? I will still repeat. I said yes, religious. Were\nyou religious before the war? [indecipherable]. Said yes. He says, I understand that\npeople religious before, are religious after. They\u2019re religious before, religious aft \u2014\nthe people that don\u2019t \u2014 that remain the same way, they either no [indecipherable]\nnothing happened? [indecipherable]. No, of course it\u2019s modified, but I never broke\nwith the religion. Although my religion is proba \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s not the same way, I\nJune 13, 2014\nwould say, as Sighet, I mean, even as grandfather. The learning is certainly not, and\nthat\u2019s so \u2014 but that could have a na \u2014 could have happened anyhow, even without\nthe Holocaust, just going to college, learning secular the boo \u2014 reading secular\nbooks and so on. So it\u2019s not to \u2014 to the Holocaust particularly. The \u2014 I don\u2019t ever,\never kind of angry \u2014 I not remember being angry at somebody, at something for the\nHolocaust, even though my \u2014 now I have this book on [indecipherable] Holocaust,\nand I mi \u2014 if I only finish. I may write more on that topic, I haven\u2019t finished that. I\nwas probably influenced a great deal, but that may even be subconscious, you\nknow, the whole \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, yes and no, as everything is a yes and no answer. That was a \u2014 that\u2019s in the\nmemoirs. That was a sort of a protest against those \u2014 and I am still firmly against it,\nJune 13, 2014\nwho considered the Holocaust the result of sin. That, I think is unforgiveable for the\n\u2014 the survivors, for the sufferer, and u \u2014 and unforgiveable for the truth, objective\ntruth. If you say that it is sin, that means it was coming to them. I often quote, and I\nth \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the mishna(ph), and [indecipherable] says that, if the court\nexecuted somebody, the family of the convict, family of the \u2014 should come to the\ncourt, to the judges, and say [speaks foreign language]. We have nothing against\nour hearts on you. In other words, justice, 1t was coming. We almost have to g-go \u2014\ncome Hitler and say we have nothing [indecipherable] it\u2019s because of sin. So that I\nreject, full-hearted. So although not as successful for a substitute, we don\u2019t have\nsomething that I could substitute. So, the idea is, leave it. Leave it as it is. That\u2019s\nwhy [indecipherable] without a reason. Because any reason will ultimately \u2014\nwhether, you know, the Rabbi of [indecipherable], who se \u2014 by the way, I was\nclose to him, I was close to him. The Rabbi [indecipherable] thought the Zionist is\nthe sin. And some people are bor \u2014 rabbis in Israel thought the \u2014 the anti-Zionists.\nWe must say, I do insist that the Holocaust is a metaphysical. Certainly it\u2019s not\nbecause they were \u2014 some Jews were communists, or some Jews were capitalists.\nOr the way they say \u2014 said that in the New Testament, that when Jesus was\ncrucified, the \u2014 th-the Jewish leaders had made that blood [indecipherable] on\nJune 13, 2014\nthem and on their children, 2,000 years ago. But my problem at the moment is to\nmake it metaphysical, in a way that human beings are not the cause.",
        "A: That I am working on.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: That was the topic that Yad Vashem asked me to talk about here a year ago, or\ntwo years ago. What\u2019s the most effective way of preserving the \u2014 the \u2014 Holocaust?\nJune 13, 2014\nI\u2019m not \u2014 and I\u2019m saying this with great caution should be misunderstood, then. I\u2019m\nnot sure that \u2014 that we could be sure that there will be no other Holocaust, since, as I\nsaid before, I think it\u2019s a metaphysical. Has something to do with free will. Man is\ncreated in a manner at least that \u2014 that he could do \u2014 God would not interfere \u2014 will\npunish him, but He will not interfere with this evildoing. So, to ask, which is the\nbasic question for a religious person, why God did not intervene in our time, when\nintervened in \u2014 intervened in the time of Haman. The idea that something moved in\nthe cosmological sphere, that caw \u2014 that God did not intervene. He intervened at\nthat time, did not intervene. So, we cannot be \u2014 I think sometimes even Netanyahu\nor the others, 1t was naive to think that an Israeli, the Israeli power, military, could\nprevent Hitler. Whoever remens \u2014 remembers the power of the German army \u2014\nnow we have this Normandy, just what 1s it, 70 years?",
        "A: You \u2014 you really thinks that Israel could have prevented the German army? So\nwe are \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I am still working find out what is sort of \u2014 but it is our\nrelationship to God, Jews, as I still believe was the chosen people, but they are\nchosen because God gave the Torah. And giving the Torah 1s a sort of intervene \u2014\nintervention in a u\u20141n a person\u2019s life. God intervened \u2014 asked \u2014 intervenes in our\nlife by telling us what to do, what not to do. And therefore, He may intervene in our\nJune 13, 2014\nfavor. When we are not following this part, sort of the bargain, the other part is not\n\u2014 it\u2019s quite complicated. It\u2019s not that simple.",
        "A: In the Jewish collective \u2014",
        "A: Well, that we are a unique people. I know Rwanda, I know the other thing, but\nnot at that size, and that [indecipherable]. Our relationship to God, and therefore\nour relationship to the world is o \u2014 the way religion claimed all along, although not\n\u2014 religion may claim your details [indecipherable] that we have a particular\nrelationship, and we should find out, particularly what \u2014 the channel by which it\nmoves. And that may be the only way we\u2019ll prevent. Look I am \u2014 I\u2019m troubled and\n\u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and puzzled. During the war, I\u2019m tal \u2014 when I say war, I mean the\nsecond World War \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 of course. Sweden, Denmark was good for the Jews. I give you no examples,\nyou know, save Jews, and [indecipherable]. Today, they not so good to Israel,\nwhich 1s a [indecipherable]. What happened in those 70 years, sort of, 60 sort of?\nDid they \u2014 if th \u2014 there 1s some basic built-in relationship that we have, with the\nJune 13, 2014\nworl \u2014 with God, and with the world, and so on. And that sort of moves around.\nAnd therefore I \u2014 I mentioned that in the \u2014 in the article on the prayer in the camp,\nyou know, that \u2014",
        "A: The Jews prayer, the ba \u2014 God has the \u2014 intervene \u2014 intervened on behalf of the\nJews is almost done th \u2014 because of He\u2019s giving the Torah [speaks foreign\nlanguage] the two are connected. [indecipherable] the \u2014 involves responsibility as\nwell as \u2014 as co \u2014 as singling out, and so on. Now, God will intervene on our behalf,\napparently if we have \u2014 we \u2014 we are in debt, a certain \u2014 and maintaining a certain\n[indecipherable] for certain relationship. That is a very delicate balance. When that\nrelationship is disturbed, God may not intervene. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t have the\npicture, I mean [indecipherable] clearly, but that\u2019s the direction I\u2019m thinking. I\ncannot accept sin as the cause.",
        "A: That\u2019s an interesting question. It\u2019s a difficult question. What do \u2014 you can ask\nme what do you do during the Holocaust day. Almost feel \u2014 I mean thank \u2014 I mean\nobviously, thank for the survival. There is no \u2014 I mean, there must be a reason, there\nJune 13, 2014\nis [indecipherable] a reason, but not a known reason at all why I survived and \u2014\nand Dupe(ph), who was stronger and fatter, the \u2014 Mother used to come home from\n\u2014 from their home, visiting them, always that argument, why are you so \u2014 why are\nyou so pale? Why, why pale? I was sitting [indecipherable] in the closed doors,\nand he was doing sports, and why I survived? So, does that entail a special\nobligation, a special tha \u2014 usually that \u2014 that leads, or should lead to more learning,\nbut that\u2019s individual, and \u2014 and that\u2019s usu \u2014 the [indecipherable] having\naccomplished something. To leave for posterity something 1n learning, that\u2019s what,\nthat others did not say it, did not have it.",
        "A: Well, I\u2014I thought about the Holocaust, I think that\u2019s \u2014 I am \u2014 just was saying,\nstill reading. Let me ta \u2014 leave at that.",
        "A: Leave at that, since you asked. No things, no \u2014 no stories that I have. My \u2014 I\ncame across the following story not long ago. A woman who had children, with cha\n\u2014a child, came to the ramp, you know \u2014 you know, in the \u2014 she apparently had\npresence of mind, and she realized what\u2019s \u2014 at least that there 1s a \u2014 she handed over\nthe child to her mother, or mother-in-law. I came across this, I don\u2019t vouch for its\nveracity. An SS saw that and came over and gave her moussat(ph). So, how do you\nJune 13, 2014\nleave a child. Don\u2019t you see what\u2019s going on there? How do you leave the child like\nthis? She took back the child, and of course Mengele send her to the other side. The\ncru \u2014 the \u2014 the corruption, using the moral stance in order to \u2014",
        "A: The cruelty of [indecipherable]. The other story I just told to my grandchild,\nwho went to Auschwitz just a few weeks ago, with some stories. The \u2014 they asked\nthe \u2014 you know, there was a, how did they get the gas? Not inside, because they\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 from outside, there was a little window. So they interviewed, I think in a\nGerman ta \u2014 TV, asking them, how \u2014 when did \u2014 did they know to open up the \u2014 the\nwindow, have the gas in there? He said, I put my ear to the window. If I didn\u2019t hear\nshmizel(ph) at all, I know I could open the window. And I told this story to chile \u2014\nmy grandchild told me \u2014 told the story to his children, they all burst out\nshmizel(ph). Think we could leave it here.",
