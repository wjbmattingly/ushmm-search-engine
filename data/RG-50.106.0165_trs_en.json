        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Andrew Glass, conducted by Gail Schwartz on\nFebruary 14\", 2005, in Washington, D.C.. This is tape number one, side A. Please\ngive us your full name.",
        "Answer: I\u2019m Andrew James Glass. The James, by the way is from my parental\ngrandfather Jacob, who was shot by the Nazis.",
        "Q: And the name that you were b -- given at birth?",
        "A: The same. The Polish version of my name is Andrej, which 1s spelled A-n-d-r-\ne-j, and as -- as in most Slavic countries there\u2019s also, for children and friends a\ndimunitive, and the dimunitive for Andrew or Andrej in Polish is Andrush.",
        "Q: And what is your date of birth?",
        "A: I was born November 30\", 1935.",
        "Q: And where were you born?",
        "A: In downtown Warsaw, Poland, not in a hospital.",
        "Q: A-Actually at home?",
        "A: Yes, and I visited th -- my place of birth as it were, and that is a story in itself,\nhow as -- as we know, Warsaw was systematically destroyed by the Germans, but\nmy house survived, and I\u2019ll explain a little bit later, if you care, why.\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "Q: What was the address of the house?",
        "A: Six Lvovaska Street. That\u2019s spelled L-v-0-v-a-s-k-a, and it is in the heart of --\nof Warsaw.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s now talk a little bit about your family, the previous generations, how far\nback that you know about and where they lived and so forth.",
        "A: My family on both my mother\u2019s and father\u2019s side are Polish. My father\u2019s family\nlived in Warsaw. We have the names of those who were my grandfather and great-\ngrandfather and great-great-gran-grandfather. Going back I think to the latter part\nof the 18\" century. And I think my mother\u2019s family was also Polish, although sh --\nas a -- as a girl she lived in Moscow during World War I. My father\u2019s father, Jacob\nwas a banker, and he was totally assimilated in the Polish culture, he -- although\nthe family was Jewish, they regarded themselves first as Poles and second as Jews.\nRemember that in the Warsaw of 1939, one third of the population was Jewish. It\nwas very much of the -- a Jewish -- a center of Jewish culture and life. And my\ngrandfather was a very successful banker in Warsaw. One of the wealthiest men in\nWarsaw at the time.",
        "Q: And did he spell his name G-1-a-s-s also?",
        "A: Yes, Glass. I think 1-in Polish probably the pronunciation is di -- slightly\ndifferent, slightly harder, but the spelling is the same.\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "Q: An-And your mother\u2019s family?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s family, my ra -- ma -- sorry. My maternal grandfather died at 55,\nalthough my grandmother, interestingly sur -- not only survived the war, but\nmanaged to escape with us, and lived to 96, in New York. Her -- she had one\nbrother, who is still alive and he and his wife also survived, separately from us, but\nare st-still alive, although they\u2019ve lost their son who was born in Santa Domingo,\nand there\u2019s a story there, too.",
        "Q: Well, now let\u2019s talk about your parents. What kind of work did your father do?",
        "A: Well, my father was educated as a lawyer, he had a degree from Warsaw law\nschool, and actually was in the same class as the former late Prime Minister of\nIsrael, Begin, although I\u2019m not sure they knew each other, but around the time that\nmy father graduated, which was coincidental with around the time I was born, that\nis the mid-30\u2019s, Polish a-anti-Semitism became much more pronounced in degrees.\nAnd as a result of that, he could not practice law in Poland. So I think he just\nmanaged real estate properties for my grandfather, including the one that we lived\nin, that I mentioned earlier.",
        "Q: And wa -- did your mother work?",
        "A: No, no. My mother, who is still alive, she was born in 1912, and so will be 93\nthis year, unhappily suffered from postpartum psychosis when I was born, so I\nFebruary 14, 2005\ndidn\u2019t see my mother -- although I didn\u2019t hear about this until much later, until\naround the time that I was two, two and a half. Although she re-recovered quite\nwell, and in a very stressful time as we know war is for anyone, managed without\nany mental problems. She\u2019s had psychotic episodes since, but she\u2019s come back\nfrom all of them.",
        "Q: How did your parents meet?",
        "A: I-In this climate of what might be called upper middle class, or even upper class\nJews, there was -- e-everyone went to school together, starting at a -- at a young\nage, in their -- their -- my parents are almost exactly the same age. And these --\nPolish Jewish assimilated culture, as it was explained to me, people did not pair off\nuntil they married. So they did things in groups, went into the woods to find --\nexcuse me -- edible mushrooms. Took vacations together, and -- as teenagers in --\nat the Baltic in a resort known as Sopot, S-o-p-o-t. And then, in their early 20\u2019s\nthey paired off and my parents paired off and married. I think my father was -- my\nparents were 22 at the time. My father, by the way, was the youngest of six or\nseven, I for -- forget, two of whom survived the war, besides my father, but did not\nescape, they were -- they were in -- in the ge-German labor camps in Germany,\ntwo sisters. And at that time, un-under Polish Jewish tradition, you weren't\nFebruary 14, 2005\nsupposed to marry until your sisters married. So this was an elopement because it\nwas a-against the tradition of the family. But somehow 1-it all worked out.",
        "Q: How would you describe your parents? Di -- wha -- were they re-religious? It\nsounds like maybe they weren\u2019t.",
        "A: Li-li -- my father was not an observant Jew, nor is my mother. However, they\ninsisted that I have a Jewish education and I was -- at that time we didn\u2019t have Bar\nMitzvahs, we had something called confirmation. So I went through about a seven\nyear program at Temple Emmanuel on Fifth Avenue and 65\" Street, which\nstarted actually shortly after I arrived in the United States, and ended when I was\n13.",
        "Q: So were they politically active in any way\u201d?",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t say so. My --",
        "Q: I-I\u2019m talking about the very early years in Poland.",
        "A: Oh, in Poland?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no. There was no opportunity, other -- y-you know -- you -- you mean in\nterms of -- of the -- the Bund or something like that? No. They -- they were not, at\nall, no. A-A-As the war approached, as -- strike that -- as it became clear, or clearer\nthat Poland was in jeopardy from an -- German attack, the Poles made some\nFebruary 14, 2005\ndecisions which changed my parents fortunes greatly and to the worse. Pole -- the\nPolish government passed a decree in -- I believe in the summer or spring of 1939,\nwhich was aimed at Jews, and to a lesser extent at Germans who controlled almost\nall of Polish industry at the time, that hard currencies, non-zlotys, held abroad by\nPoles, had to be repatriated and converted to Polish money, the zloty. That law\nwas, as you might imagine, not totally adhered to. In fact, there is now quite a\nnumber of cases involving funds that were put in Switzerland in secret accounts by\nprecisely -- by contemporaries of my grandfather who were faced with this\nsituation and whose heirs are now either receiving or just seeking to prove that --\nthat these funds were theirs. But any event, my grandfather had considerable sums\nabroad 1n -- particularly in Switzerland and in New York and London, 1-in the\norder of millions of dollars. And in part because he was a Polish patriot and in part\nbecause he was fearful of not breaking the law, all of this money was repatriated to\nPoland, and there were no funds in New York, there were no funds in any other\nplace. So, when my parents eventually arrived in New York with a one week visa\nto stay in the United States, they were -- they were destitute, pa -- financially\ndestitute. Interestingly, my father -- a-as you recall, in 1939 there was a World\u2019s\nFair in New York, and the ability of Poles, particularly of -- of people of means to\nget U.S. visas to visit the World\u2019s Fair was -- wa -- things kind of opened up, you\nFebruary 14, 2005\ncould -- you could get a -- a visa to go to the World\u2019s Fair, and you could take a\nship from Poland or from France and come here tha -- in the summer of 1939. My\nfather proposed to my grandfather that he -- when this law was passed, that he sign\nhi -- these assets over to my father and that my father come ostensibly to visit the\nWorld\u2019s Fair, but he had the impression, which was probably correct, that if he was\nsitting in New York with four or five million dollars, that you could probably find\na -- a ways and means not to get kicked out. But my grandfather vetoed the plan\nand I often wondered how my life would have changed if -- for the better or for the\nworse, had he said, all right, go to New York, and if they had arrived in New York\nin that fashion rather than in the rather different circumstances that brought us to\nthe United States.",
        "Q: Did your parents ever talk to you later about anti-Se-Semitism that they\nexperienced when you were still too young, obviously to know about it, before\nSeptember \u201939? Did they tell you of any incidents that happened?",
        "A: Well, as I said, he was unable to -- to practice hi -- the profession to which he\nwas trained, but --",
        "Q: Any specific personal -- do you know what I mean? Very, very personal\ninstances?\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so because they were living in -- in -- pretty much in isolation.\nNow, I put isolation in quotes because if you have a -- a million fellow Jews in\nWarsaw, you can find your way around. My father\u2019s resentment against Poland,\nwhich he held until his death in 1993, was really centered around Polish anti-S-\nSemitism that was displayed after the war began, and during the war. And he wrote\nmany letters, some to the New York Times, some of -- of which were published, to\nthe Jewish publications and so on and was e-extremely active in Jewish charities\nduring his life and gave a -- a -- particularly the United Jewish Appeal. And so his -\n- his resentment was that [indecipherable] resentment is that the Poles aided and\nabetted the systematic slaughter of Polish Jews.",
        "Q: What is your very first memory? You said you were born in November 735, so\nwhat di -- can you recall the very first memory?",
        "A: Yes, I remember as a very small child being in pa -- with -- not with my mother\nbut with a -- a nursemaids in -- ah, there was a beautiful park near where we lived\ncalled park Lazienki which 1s still there, and I remember the peacocks 1n the park.\nBut one of my earliest memories is of the Stuka dive bombers bombing Warsaw,\nand the noise, and seeing the bombs fall on the city and seeing the bombers,\nbecause they were -- dr-dropped their bombs from very low altitude and they\nwould dive and then pull up and it was an extremely -- but the noise of the\nFebruary 14, 2005\nairplanes and noise of the bombs made an impression for someone who was living\nin central Warsaw.",
        "Q: So we\u2019re talking about September \u00b039?",
        "A: Exactly, we\u2019re talking about the first two weeks of September, 1939. And I have\nonly very hazy memories of my -- our flight from Warsaw east. Mos-Most of that\nis not recaptured memory so much as what I\u2019ve been told by my parents.",
        "Q: No, it\u2019s obvious that we know that many of the things you\u2019re telling us when\nyou -- before you were born obviously, and when you were very young is what you\nlearned fro-from your -- your parents. Did -- did they tell you that they tried,\nbesides the New York World\u2019s Fair, tried to get out in any other wa -- any other\nway?",
        "A: No, my father was very much a man of the world, I mean he -- he tr -- had the\nEncyclopedia Britannica at home, so he spoke some English, which was a -- a\ngreat benefit. He spoke Russian and German. He traveled some with my\ngrandfather. I was conceived on a cruise to the fjords of Norway. So he was a -- h-\nhe -- the radio at that time -- and I remember my father telling me about listening to\nthe speeches of Adolf Hitler on th-the radio, of course. Warsaw was not that far\nfrom Berlin and everyone had a shortwave set so you could listen to -- to the\nGerman radio, and my father being fairly fluent in German could understand\nFebruary 14, 2005\nHitler\u2019s speeches and how mesmerizing Hitler was, although he disagreed with,\nobviously with everything that he had to say. So they were ris -- I would say my\nfather particularly but my mother as well, were resourceful people who, at a very\ncritical stage in the war, in the first weeks of the war, took some dramatic steps to\nsave their lives and my life. And we can talk about that if you like.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home?",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s funny, because when my mother was ill I spent a lot of time in my\ngrandparent\u2019s home, and that was the -- a poly --",
        "Q: Glot.",
        "A: Polyglot. Sorry. Polyglot household with Polish, of course, but also English,\nFrench, German spoken, and I remember as one of my first memories actually, or --\n[-I -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a memory or if it was reported back to me as that I asked\nmy grandfather Jadush, which means grandfather in Polish, wh-when will I get my\nown language? The idea being that I had to converse with the nanny in French and\nwith the maid in Polish and others in Russian and German and so I had -- I\u2019ve\nnever had a particularly strong facility for languages, but as a child I did.",
        "Q: So now you\u2019re saying that your first recollection is when Warsaw was being\nbombed, and did you -- again, you were so very young, but were your parents\ncomforting, did they explain anything to you?\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "A: No. I -- w-wa -- when the war -- as you know, when the war began in the first\nweek of September, my father, who had somewhat impaired vision and was also\nJewish, for both those reasons was not drafted into the Polish army. But -- and the\nwar began, either -- I\u2019m not clear whether it was on a volunteer basis or on a draft\nbasis, was inducted into a kind of home army or home civil defense corps, who-\nwhose primary task was to fill sandbags around public buildings and to clear the\nrubble from the German bombings. And t-to put up defenses as it were against -- ba\n-- sandbags against th-the prospect of -- of other public monuments and buildings\nbeing bombed in subsequent days. In any event this was almost a full-time job, he\njust was rarely home, as that was reported to me. In about the 12\" day of the war,\nhe was working alongside a stranger who happened -- a Gentile, who happened to\nbe a taxi driver. And they began talking about what a good idea it might be for both\nfamilies to get the heck out of Warsaw, since the bombing was continuing and\nintensifying, and since the evidence from the BBC and from German radio, if not\nPolish radio was that the G-Germans were coming closer and you could hear the\nartillery fire from three sides. So the problem was that the taxi driver didn\u2019t have\nany gas for his taxi. And this part was always -- I never could get my father to quite\nexplain whether he had a stash of gasoline or he had a stash of gold, or he knew\nhow on the black market to get it, it was always fuzzy. But the bottom line is, my\nFebruary 14, 2005\nfather procured gas for this taxi. So taxi plus gas meant that both families fled in\nthe dawn hours of September 13\". I think a day or so, or maybe hours before -- you\ncan check it -- the -- the bridges across the Vistula were severed. Warsaw itself\nheld out against German attack until the end of the month. And some people also\nescaped by boat and so on and found ways out. But basically we left and traveled\neast, around the time that that opportunity shut down. Others traveled south toward\nRomania and survived, but we traveled due east until the tax1 ran out of gas, and\nthen we separated from the taxi driver and his family and we somehow got a horse\nand cart and kept going east.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit more about your leaving Warsaw. You again were very,\nvery young. Do you remember that, and if so do you remember your emotions and\nthe understanding of -- I mean, you were just a toddler.",
        "A: I was just a toddler, I was just four, I only cou -- one can has -- have memories\nfrom that time, particularly if there\u2019s an abrupt change in your life, and I have very\nsh- shady memories of that time as -- but later on, that is a year later, we ended up\nacross the border in Lithuania and I do remember living in Lithuania quite\nclearly, and everything since then.",
        "Q: Do you -- did your mother ever tell you what she brought with her -- when a\nfamily has to leave a home like that so suddenly, what your folks took with them?\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "A: Yes, she did. They took nothing. And th-the -- in that there\u2019s a story, because\nmy father\u2019s pants, with -- the ones that he was wearing when they fled were part of\na -- atemporary exhibit at the Holocaust Museum some years ago on a group of\nabout 2200 Polish Jews who fled, who were able to reach Japan, and many of\nwhom, not all, but many of whom survived because of that. And so the point of\nputting his pants in the exhibit was that that was the only thing he had and that was\nthe only pants he ha -- he wore f-from the time that he left Warsaw, I think, til the\ntime he arrived in the United States. They were rather good pants, but they -- they\nsaw a lot of adventure through the -- here and there.",
        "Q: D-Do you have any memory of that taxi ride with the other family?",
        "A: Very faintly. Just remember being picked up at -- somehow, and bundled in a --\nin a crowded black taxi and remember crossing the bridges. I had never been to\nPraga, which is the suburb of Poland that is directly east of the city, and so I think\nI have a slight memory of crossing the river, but that\u2019s it. No, not really.",
        "Q: Did you have a favorite toy with you, do you know that?",
        "A: [had no toys, nothing, no. When I returned to Warsaw, well after the war, and\nwent to the apartment that I grew up in -- well, I di -- I lived in til I was four, I was\nable to recall the apartment vividly. I mean, exactly where my room was, where the\nkitchen was, where the a -- the attic that was there which they didn\u2019t know about,\nFebruary 14, 2005\nbecause it was on the top floor, and had been sealed. The apartment itself had been\ndivided during the communist period into six apartments, with a kind of a -- a\nfrozen glass partitions going down the central hallway. But the -- the -- arriving at -\n- at the apartment house, I had no problem finding the -- the elevator, which was\nstill the same elevator, finding the apartment -- I think there were three or four\napartments on each floor, finding the right apartment and then finding my way\naround the apartment, even though it had been substantially remodeled.",
        "Q: During the bombing 1n the first weeks of September, was your neighborhood as\n-- a-affected, damaged?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. No, I think that the bombing was mainly around the public\nbuildings, which were a few miles away. Of course, 0-over time, and particularly in\n1944, the entire neighborhood, save for my house, apartment house, was leveled,\nand I may as well tell you why. A-Around the corner from the apartment house\nthere was and still is a gymnasium, a high school which became during the uprising\nof the Polish Home Army, the hundred or so days that the Poles fought the\nGermans, while the Russians sat on the east side of the river --",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about 1944.",
        "A: I\u2019m talking about 1944. That was -- that was the hi -- that was a -- a major\nmilitary headquarters for the Germans. So the Germans were systematically\nFebruary 14, 2005\nblowing up the city, that part of the city that had not already been blown up in\nearlier fighting, or in con-continuing fighting. But the German officers needed a\nplace to live, or sleep anyway. And so our -- our house, which was directly around\nthe -- around the corner from the gymnasium was designated as a billet for Nazi\ngenerals, and therefore, while it had a lot of bullet holes in it, some of which were\nstill evident when I returned to Warsaw in 1977 with President Carter, that was\none of the few houses in central Warsaw that did survive.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Andrew Glass. This is tape number one, side B. And we were\ntalking about how your family left Warsaw in the taxi and then the gas ran out.\nAnd where were you then?",
        "A: Well, as you know, around September 17 or 18, the secret codicil of the mos --\nMoscow-Berlin axis was put into play, the so-called Molotov-Ribbon --\nRibbentrop Pact --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- under which the -- the Soviets invaded from the east and there was a line or\ndemarcation, so we soon found ourselves among Soviet troops who were headed\nFebruary 14, 2005\nwest while we were headed east. And this was also a risk because we were\nevidently bourgeois, educated, and there were -- I would say my father told me, and\nI have no firsthand knowledge of this, but quite a few arbitrary arrests of people\nwho they just didn\u2019t like, or who the local Polish peasantry turned in, or whatever.\nAnd that was a risk, so you really didn\u2019t want to s-stay in Soviet occupied Poland,\nand we managed to find our way -- illegally, of course -- across the border to\nLithuania where, once we were in Lithuania, the Lithuanian government accepted\nus as Polish refugees.",
        "Q: D-Do you remember any of the towns that you passed through, or did your\nparents tell you later, or do you have any recollection of that part of the journey?",
        "A: No, none at all. I think part of it was by train, and part of 1t was on foot. Some of\nit was on -- by horse and wagon. I do remember Wilno quite -- quite well though,\nwhich was the --",
        "Q: So that was your destination to -- to --",
        "A: That was the destination and that was where we stayed when we were in -- in\nLithuania. Now, what\u2019s important about that time is that at the time we arrived in\nLithuania, although there was a strain between the Polish and Lithuanian\ngovernments having to do with the arrangements after World War I, we were ra-\nFebruary 14, 2005\nrather well received, and my father was able to actually earn some kind of living by\nbuying and selling stuff. And --",
        "Q: What kind of stuff?",
        "A: Diamond rings, and gold and people wanting to -- currency manipulation,\ndollars and British pounds and so on. He was operating on the fringes of the\ngalaxy, but during that time there was a progressive tightening of the noose by the\nSoviets. At first it was to insist on a change of government that was more friendly\nto the Soviet point of view, then that government invited, quote unquote, Soviets to\nopen bases in Lithuania and eventually that led to a de facto Soviet occupation\nmuch like the S-Syrians in Lebanon and then finally to annexation of Lithuania as\na SSR as the Soviet Socialist Republic, which it continued to be until 1991. So we\nlived through all of that, and during the time we were in Lithuania, the -- the\nSoviet presence and the s -- importance of the Soviets materially increased. Now,\nmy father, if I may continue, didn\u2019t stay in Lithuania because he was -- and again,\nhe was very vague on this, whether he was in the underground, or whether it, as is\nmostly presented to me, that he wanted to get his father out, who was in Warsaw.\nSo he made his way through the Soviet and German lines, back to Warsaw on two\noccasions, and returned to Warsaw in the | -- winter of 1939 - 1940 and tried to\nconvince my grandfather to leave with him, and with my grandmother as well, and\nFebruary 14, 2005\nthey refused, and gave reasons why they wouldn\u2019t go. The reason 1s that basically\nthey survived World War I, and while there were privations and problems, and\nseveral armies swept through Warsaw, the Prussians, the Austrians, the Russians\nand so on, basically civilians survived and were not considered combatants. World\nWar II, of course, had a much different aspect. And so the idea of going into the\nPolish countryside, which was believed to be anti-Semitic and dangerous, th-the\nidea of leaving his townhouse slash mansion was unappealing to my grandfather,\nwho was then in his late 50\u2019s.",
        "Q: So now you are in -- you said in Vilnius? Is that where you settled in\nLithuania?",
        "A: Yes, but there\u2019s a st -- there\u2019s a story involving my father\u2019s second trip back in\nthe winter of 1940. At -- by that time, the Polish Lithuanian border was patrolled\nboth by Soviet and Lithuanian troops, but not jointly. And on his way back from\nthe second, futile mission to Warsaw, he was walking along the railroad track in\nthe snow with the pair of pants that ended up in the museum, and he was a-a-\narrested, I guess, or -- by a Lithuanian patrol. My father said that had he\nencountered a Soviet patrol there would have been no question that he would have\nbeen shot, because he had no proper papers or -- you know, he was a Pole at -- with\n-- at least suspicious, and probably a spy. Any event, the Lithuanians, according to\nFebruary 14, 2005\nmy father\u2019s story, took him to their outpost, gave him his watch and gave him his\nmoney, gave him his shoes, and was kind of held there for overnight, and in the\nmorning, not knowing what his fate would be, the -- the captain, who was\nsomewhat educated, said, we\u2019ve been thinking about your situation and what we\u2019ve\ndecided is that we\u2019re going to ask you a question. And based on your answer to this\nquestion, quite frankly, we\u2019re either going to sh -- let you go or shoot you. Which\nwas -- kind of concentrated his mind. So the question, which my father repeated in\nLithuanian is, or was -- [speaks Lithuanian here]. Is Roosevelt -- President\nRoosevelt a Jew? And my father\u2019s response, according to my father was, what a\nsilly question, why would you ask me a question like that? Everybody knows\nRoosevelt\u2019s Jewish. And then they said, all right, get out of here. And he walked in\nthe snow in his socks and somehow made it back to Wilno. So that -- I think that\nstory is worth mem-memorializing because it epitomizes -- you say in Polish\n[speaks Polish here], which means, yi -- it was such a time, which never existed\nbefore and will never exist again. [speaks Polish here]. And that was a -- a\nvignette from that time.",
        "Q: So then he got back to you.",
        "A: Yeah, then -- o-of course there was -- there were -- he was looking to get -- I\nmean, knowing that the Soviets were tightening their noose around the -- Li-\nFebruary 14, 2005\nLithuania and that it was an unhealthy place to -- to remain and of course the story\nof the Lithuanian Jews is a very sad story, very few, if any, survived after the\nGermans invaded in June of 1941. So in that winter, he en -- made a really great\neffort to try to get out and we were very fortunate that through a strange series of\ncircumstances we were able to leave. And it -- we may be described as a trifecta 1-\nin the sense that there were three elements to -- to it, and if any of the three\nelements failed, we would have not survived. The first element was a -- a\nDutchman who was the honorary consul of the Dutch government in Lithuania\nand whose job was to sell Philips radios. And he decided that anyone who applied\ncould get residence in Curacao which was then a Dutch colony. Course, what was\nnot known is that the governor of Curacao was not allowing anybody to get in, but\nyou could get a piece of paper that said you had residence status or invitation to\nbecome a resident of the island of Curacao. And with that piece of paper you could\nthen seek transit visas to get to Curacao. You needed basically three visas. You\nneeded a Russian -- Soviet visa, you needed a Japanese visa, then you needed to\ncross the Atlantic and get an American visa to get you to Curacao. So there was in\n-- and this is very well known and we don\u2019t have to go into detail about this, there\nwas a Japanese council in Lithuania, in the Lithuanian capital, kow -- kow --\nKowsis?\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "Q: Kaunas.",
        "A: Kaunas -- named Sigahura, who -- who I -- whose widow I met at the Japanese\nembassy some years ago, and who issued 2200 of -- of these transit visas to Japan,\nwhich he did wi -- against the express orders of the Japanese foreign ministry in\nTokyo -- to Jews. And our names and the record 1s there, it\u2019s on the internet, too.\nWe got three of these, and with that -- that was two -- two parts of the trifecta. The\nthird part -- and this part is less well known and deserves to be discussed in some\ndetail, was to get the Soviet -- permission from the Soviets to leave Vilnius and to\ntravel to Japan. And they were selling a package deal, where you got the visa, and\nthe ticket on the Trans-Siberian railroad, which at that ttme was something like a\n16 day trip from Moscow to Vladivostok. And if you ask what I remember, I\nremember that trip very vividly, because it was 1n the winter of 1940, and it was\nvery cold, and I guess I was tur -- just turning five. So the first problem was how to\nget -- because the Soviets said, the only way you could get this -- and we needed\n600 dollars for three visas, the only way you get six -- the only -- excuse me, the\nonly way the Soviets would do business with you was in dollars. And any resident\nof Vilnius who was caught with dollars on his or her possession was automatically\nshipped to Siberia, but not with a visa, and so it was a kind of a catch 22. You\nneeded the dollars in order to get the visas, but if you had the dollars that was\nFebruary 14, 2005\nprima facie evidence that you were -- had illegal currency and you were subject to\nimmediate arrest. My father -- I don\u2019t know if this is part of this -- I guess,\nsurviving the Holocaust, so we can go wi -- through this if you like. My father\ncame up with an ingenious plan. He had a double envelope. He put the money in an\nenvelope, and in the o -- in the outer envelope he said, this money is to be used\nsolely and only for the purpose of attaining three exit visas and tr-tr -- or rather,\ntransit visas to -- through the Soviet Union. And some of these visas were granted,\nand some people were arrested, as I was told. And some visas were not granted, but\nthey were not arrested. Almost all the interviews took place around three or four in\nthe morning tha -- you were summoned to the KGB headquarters where all this\nwas happening in downtown Vilnius. And among the questions that were asked\nwas, if you do go to the new world, if you do get to the United States, w-would\nyou be interested in helping us, helping the great Soviet Union complete its\nmission of liberating the world. In other words, would you s -- become a -- a spy,\nor an agent. So this was a very difficult time. And the third part of this trifecta, I\nthink my father is proudest of having navigated that particular rapids. And so we\ndid get those visas, and we did go to Moscow, I do remember Moscow in 1941.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s back up a little bit. So you\u2019re -- before you get onto the Trans-Siberian\nrailroad, do you have any other memories of Vilnius?\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "A: Well, just the apartment that we lived in, and eating a lot of bread and salami,\nwhich I -- and cheese, which is what I think we survived on. And I have some\npictures I think, still, of -- one or two pictures of that would -- somehow survived\nfrom there. Oh, there was also a -- a document which has survived, asking my\nfather to bring back some kind of salamis or something from -- from the United\nStates, I guess, I don\u2019t know, but there was -- there was a -- a request for, you\nknow, send -- send food back to Lithuania, so -- from -- from a Japanese diplomat.\nIt was all a very strange time.",
        "Q: And what -- was it a fearful time for you as a young child? And -- and if so, did\nyour parents explain then what was happening?",
        "A: No, not at all. I have to stress it was not fearful for me, I felt quite safe, and 1-1-1s\n-- | had a sense of adventure. I mean, I -- one of my memories 1s, as the train pulled\ninto Vladivostok and we were being carried, because there was a considerable\ndistance from the railhead to the pier, where the Japanese ship was going to take us\nto the west coast of Japan, and being carried by my father, you know, because it\nwas too far to walk and it was quite cold --",
        "Q: Te-Tell me more about the train ride.",
        "A: Train ride was interesting that -- that -- that -- that were great [indecipherable]\nof ours on -- on the train wi-with tea, so I -- I was introduced to tea and I -- ever\nFebruary 14, 2005\nsince then I\u2019ve been a tea drinker. And there was also a yeshiva, a whole yeshiva\nof about a hundred or so of th -- among these 2200 who were on the train and who\nkept pretty much to themselves, but I remember the -- you know, the black coats,\nand the --",
        "Q: So there were 2200 Jews on this train leaving?",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, there might have been at most several hundred, but there were\n2200 exit visas issued. So not all the people who got exit visas got Soviet vi -- not\nall the people who got -- excuse me -- not all the people who got transit visas from\nSigahura made it t-through Russia. Some didn\u2019t try, some tried and couldn\u2019t and\nth-the -- the visas were staggered over some time and so the departures were\nstaggered over some time. So we were, I think, toward the middle, but I -- th-that\u2019s\na -- I\u2019m not sure of that.",
        "Q: So what -- when did you actually leave? When did the train depart? Do you\nknow the date?",
        "A: Pretty much. Backing up, we left Japan [buzzer] [inaudible] -- we left Japan\nin 1941. We left Japan in the latter part of April 1941 on the Kamakura Maru to\nsail to Honolulu and eventually to San Francisco, arriving in San Francisco, |\nthink, in early May of 1941. We arrived in Japan in December of 1940, and we\nwere in the Soviet Union about two months until we got the train, so that meant\nFebruary 14, 2005\nthat we probably left Vilnius around octo -- middle of October of 1940, or about a\nyear after the war began.",
        "Q: So you were there for almost a year in -- in Vilnius?",
        "A: Yes, except for the time that we were in -- making our way to Vilnius --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: --but I would say the better -- yes, the better part of a year, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Any other memories of the train ride, or we exhausted that?",
        "A: Y-Y-Yeah. I remember being -- we were in --",
        "Q: Did you sleep in beds?",
        "A: No, no, there was a -- second class cars and -- but I remember arriving in -- the\nRussian winter, as you know, starts fairly early, so it was the latter part of\nNovember, 1940, in Novosibirsk where the train stopped, and it was about 40\nbelow. And the only thing for sale at the station, which I bought, or was bought for\nme, was moroshne, ice cream. It was, I think an interesting -- I\u2019ve later been back\nto Novosibirsk and remembered that.",
        "Q: Did you have warm clothes?",
        "A: Well, the train was warm. The train was fine.",
        "Q: And your parents were able to get you cl -- more clothes to wear when you were\nin Vilnius?\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "A: I-I don\u2019t remember being cold. And we were there basically during the spring,\nsummer and fall, so we were there during the warm weather.",
        "Q: And you always had enough food?",
        "A: We always had enough food. And a -- and a -- a sense of I -- sort of suspended\nanimation. I mean, remember my father was -- and mother were 28 at the time. So\nthey were just young people, and they were gaming the system, to try to figure out\nhow to survive, and -- and did.",
        "Q: So now you\u2019 ve gotten off the train in Vladivostok?",
        "A: Oh, there\u2019s also an interesting story about that, which 1s that there was a small\ngroup of Jews living in Japan as traders, who had been there for quite -- quite\nsome time and were [indecipherable]. And the Japanese required a rather large\nbond, a security bond, or -- for each person who got off the boat, to ensure that they\nwould not become dependents of the Japanese state, or to ensure that they would\nleave when their Japanese visas expired, or whatever. Anyway, they had to come\nup with a lot of money per capita tax or bond. And there -- somehow, there was --\nthe last guy off the boat was a Gentile and had somehow got mixed in with this\ngroup of yeshiva people and with my parents, who were traveling. I would say\nthere were maybe 300 people on the boat, that would be about right.\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "Q: All the people on the boat were the ones who had been on the railroad, is that\ncorrect?",
        "A: All the people on the boat were the ones who had reached Vladivostok from\nMoscow on the train, which took 15 days to cross.",
        "Q: Wh -- wa -- were there other children on the train that you played with or talked\nto?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember any, no, no, I don\u2019t re -- there may have been, but I don\u2019t\nremember any. I remember children on the Kamakura Maru because there was\nalso a -- a zoo that was traveling to San Francisco -- or not a zoo, a circus, and\nthere were tigers and lions in cages on the -- on the deck and so I remember playing\nwith the kids and with -- with the wild animals as it were, but -- and seeing how\nclose we could come without getting swiped. But just to finish, so these -- so my\nfather again, told me the story that this one Gentile fellow, who somehow was also\na refugee, but wasn\u2019t affected -- didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t have the same story as we did, th-\nth-the Japanese -- th-the -- the Jewish Japanese said okay, we\u2019ll take him too. In\nother words, why -- why would we send him back to Russia? Even though he\u2019s not\nJewish, we\u2019ll take care of him.",
        "Q: So you land in Japan, and how long -- and t-t-tell -- tell about the life there.\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "A: Well, I remember Japan very clearly. This is, of course, pre-war Japan. I\nremember downtown Tokyo very well. And I remember, in fact, riding in a trolley\ncar, they had green trolley cars and we were passing the imperial palace, the trolley\ncar passed in front of the palace, and all of the ri -- passengers got out of their seats\nand bowed in the direction of the palaces toward the emperor. And I remember\nasking my mother why weren\u2019t we bowing too, and said well that\u2019s, you know --\nshe said something in the effect -- effectively, that\u2019s not our thing, that\u2019s the local\nthing and we don\u2019t do that. But I remember the department store Takashima,\nwhere there was a 14 story department store that was -- had a -- a three story slide\non the roof, and how exciting it was for me to slide -- walk up the ladder -- and my\nparents let me do it, slide down these three stories, so -- that was a time when my\nfather\u2019s main occupation was finding a way out of Japan. And he managed to do\nso by getting a residence visa to the Dominican Republic, who were -- at that time\nthe dictator of the Dominican Republic, Trujillo was interested in Europeanizing\nand bringing in educated Europeans into -- into the -- Hispaniola. And so we were\ngranted three visas, residence visas to the Dominican Republic, and on the basis of\nthat visa, we got one week transit visas from the American consul in Tokyo. So\nthat when we got off the Kamakura Maru, we could get on a train in San\nFebruary 14, 2005\nFrancisco, change in trains in Chicago and then take a train to New York and then\ntake a ship to the Dominican Republic, but we never did that.",
        "Q: Did you know you were going to the United States? You, as a child.",
        "A: No. No, I didn\u2019t. I mean, I knew I was crossing the Pacific Ocean and I have\nvery clear memories of -- of Pearl Harbor and Honolulu when the ship docked\nthere for a couple of days, bu-but -- before it went on.",
        "Q: Well again, I -- obviously you still were very young. Did the United States\nmean anything? Did America have any meaning for you in any sense?",
        "A: No, not at all, 1t was just the great adventure, that we were traveling. I mean,\nwe'd been on this train, and now we were on -- and living in Japan was a lot of\nfun, cause I was kind of a street kid, and learning Japanese very quickly. And then\nbeing on this boat. And that took about, oh, three weeks to cross the Pacific. It\nwasn\u2019t a fast boat. And it was a lot of fun, I mean, I would go with my parents into\nthese very hot baths which the Japanese had, and then you\u2019d get out of the bath and\nhave a cold bucket of ice water thrown on you. It was a lot of fun. I didn't feel I was\na refugee in that sense, no.",
        "Q: Were there other Jewish children there that you played with in Japan?",
        "A: I suppose so. I -- I remember playing with Japanese kids, but this was a -- you\nknow, a lot of the Japanese -- a lot of the people in our [indecipherable] did not\nFebruary 14, 2005\nget these Dominican visas. Some of them got Dutch visas to go to the Dutch East\nIndies. And they suffered terribly, many of them died, wi -- after the Japanese\ninvasion of what is now Indonesia. The ones, the [indecipherable] people, the\nones who could get visas to nowhere, when the war began about six months after\nwe left Japan, went to Shanghai and spent the war in Shanghai. None of them\nstayed in Japan. And the Jewish community in Shanghai, I just know anecdotally,\nwhile had many privations, basically survived, too. Many of them made it to\nAustralia, South America, some to the United States. So it\u2019s literally, I mean,\nand quite clearly a -- a Diaspora.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nFebruary 14, 2005\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Andrew Glass. This is tape number two, side\nA, and I was just wondering if you had anything more to say about docking in\nHawaii and staying there for a little bit.",
        "A: Well, these are events that took place 65 years ago, so forgive me, but young\npeople are impressionable, and of course this was what, about six months or so, a\nlittle less than six months before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, so we saw it.\nSeeing the Pacific fleet was very impressive, too. A-All those battleships and\naircraft carriers in one place. Probably not a good idea, but that was where they\nwere, and we -- I think we -- my father must have had some money, a little bit of\nmoney, because he chartered a -- or hired a taxicab and we kind of took a trip\naround the island to just s -- go to Diamondhead and -- and see. It was one of\nthose beautiful spring days that you have in Hawaii, so I have a clear memory of\nthat. And then a -- of course a memory of arriving in San Francisco and the\nGolden Gate bridge, and -- but we were there just for a day or so before we got on\na train to -- to New York.\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "Q: While your father -- while your parents and you were traveling, did you sense\nany concern or any worry or any tension about their having to leave their families\nback in Poland, and were they aware of what was happening there?",
        "A: Oh well, there wasn\u2019t an -- this was early in th -- relatively early in the war, and\nwhile we knew that the -- the Nazis were anti-Semitic and we knew that a lot of\nJews had left because of that, we had no idea of the Holocaust, per se, no. My\nfather wanted very much to get his family out because he feared for their lives, this\nearly. But he had no direct evidence other than, as we know, the creation of the\nghetto, the -- the tightening of the noose, as it were, the -- m-my grandfather never\nwent to the ghetto, it -- they -- when it became clear he couldn\u2019t stay in Warsaw\nany more, they went to a small town in eastern Poland where they were eventually\nshot in 1943.",
        "Q: Do you know what town that was?",
        "A: I can find out, and my father told me, but I -- it do -- 1t doesn\u2019t -- but h-he f --\nthey f -- after the war, my father was in contact with people who were there at the\ntime and remembered the round-up and when -- when they were shot. So they were\nnever in -- in a death camp, they were just hauled out of their -- where they were\nstaying and -- and killed. Incidentally, I had a maternal great-grandmother who, at\nthe time the war began was 103. And she ended up 1n a small town not too far from\nFebruary 14, 2005\nWarsaw, and when she was 104, she was doing some, what might be called relief\nwork. She was bringing food to Jews who were hiding and something like that,\nnever fearing for her own life, but there was a curfew. After dark you were subject\nto arrest or worse, and she was summarily shot. So she ended her life with a\nGerman bullet at 104.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: I -- Ican look that up for you. I have it in -- in my computer, but it doesn\u2019t come\nto -- I think ste -- Stefania, something like that. Stefania Glass.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re in the United States, and your -- you\u2019ve left California, you said,\nand you\u2019re on your way to New York?",
        "A: Yeah, I was a kid in -- in New York, and my father an -- tried to find some\nwork. He contacted my -- his father\u2019s broker, my grandfather\u2019s broker, who -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t know if they lent him some money, they possibly did. But since my\ngrandfather had millions of dollars invested in Wall Street, they -- until he pulled it\nout, they -- I mean, they wrote a le -- a letter of reference for my father, which he\nsought to use effectively with the immigration authorities stalling them from\ndeporting him because we were illegal aliens. And while that case was pending\nagainst us, trying to get us to leave the country, the Japanese bombed Pearl\nHarbor and started World War II. And under American law at the time, my father,\nFebruary 14, 2005\nwho was a lawyer, as I said, was familiar with American immigration law, and we -\n- and then -- st -- st -- Justice Department had every right to deport us. But under\nU.S. law they could only deport us to the country that we had immediately entered\nfrom, which was the empire of Japan. Or our native country, which was the\nPoland that was under German occupation. So they said you had to leave, but there\nwas a catch 22 there in our favor. They couldn\u2019t tell us where to go, cause there\nwas no place to go. And then, during the war, of course, th-there was -- as you\nknow, under the immigration law there was a Polish quota, and that Polish quota\nfor immigrants was subscribed until something like 1960, 20 years. But President\nRoosevelt signed an executive order that basically said that unfilled slots, that is\npeople who were supposed to arrive say in 1942, but didn\u2019t arrive because they\nwere trapped behind German lines, an -- those slots could be filled by people who\nhave -- who are otherwise of good character, never mind how they got here. And\non that basis, I think around 1943, while we were still in limbo as it were, we\nemigrated to Canada and re-entered as le-legally with -- with these immigration\nvisas that were given to us in Canada. And then in 1948 we became USS. citizens,\nfive years later. I became a U.S. citizen, 1948.",

And I picked it up, and both my mother and father\nworked, so I was very much during that time, a street kid on my own. And that was\nfine.",
        "Q: What part of New York Did you settle in?",
        "A: Well, we lived in -- very shortly after we arrived, we had a small apartment at\n315 West 74 Street, which put me in the same school district as you were in, P.S.\n9, although I think under somewhat grander circumstances. But, so I was a student\nat P.S. 9, and we lived on what\u2019s known as the Upper West Side.",
        "Q: Did you feel very different from the other children, having come from Europe?",
        "A: No. And remember, we all had the common experience of the war, that we were\n-- there was rationing, gas rationing and rubber rationing for tires and so on. And\nmy father was working in a defense plant in Brooklyn, so the main occupation, the\nmain thought as I had as a child was that of World War II, and that was a common\nexperience with all of us.",
        "Q: Was your mother working?",
        "A: Yes, yes, they were both working, and I had this curious experience of being\nthere -- how to put it? There are children who grew up in very modest\nFebruary 14, 2005\ncircumstances and whose parents somehow became wealthy. Or, whose -- or who\nhad parent -- who, as parents were poor -- as children, excuse me, before they\nbecame parents were poor, but they made it as adults. And so there\u2019s often this\nbusiness of Edward my son, you know, whatever the kid wants, he can have. But\nwi -- I lived in the reverse, that my parents were -- grew up extremely wealthy, and\nwere extremely poor. So they lived poor, but thought rich. And when you lived\npoor and thought rich -- you think rich, you do certain things that you don\u2019t\notherwise do. For example, they never thought that it would -- that I should have\nsome kind of babysitter. Well, they hadn\u2019t had the money for babysitters, so I just\nwas, from a very young age, I was just left alone. And that -- apparently survived,\nSO --",

But I-I remember ver -- by clear memories as, you\nknow, seven, eight years old, of playing in Riverside Drive, which was a training\nfacility for the army and the navy. And I would kind of march along with the\nsoldiers who were living in the -- what is now the Hotel Beacon, on Broadway.\nAnd they would march down 74\" Street, past the Schwab mansion. We lived\nacross the street from the Schwab, into Riverside Drive, and there was a -- kind of\na parade round there, where they would drill and I would become the mascot of\nthese young soldiers who were getting ready to go abroad, fight.",

I was an Am-American like they -- they were,\nand I -- I wa -- I suppose I repressed all of that, but that wouldn\u2019t be the right word,\nI was just -- I didn\u2019t want to be different, I didn\u2019t want to stand out.

        "A: Extremely so, and of course living in New York in the 1940\u2019s ma-make you\neven more de -- independent, so I thought nothing of walking over to Broadway,\nputting a dime or a nickel, I don\u2019t remember what it was in -- in the trolley car fare\nbox. Or maybe at that time kids didn\u2019t pay, and just going down to Times Square\non my own as a seven year old, eight year old.

On w -- about the time that I was\neight, my mother would give me a quarter on Saturday morning so I could go to the\nnewsreel, which was at 72\"? and Broadway.

        "Q: Okay, the war is now over, it\u2019s 1945, do you remember any celebration of your\nparents, or anything specific about that time?\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "A: The only thing I do remember 1s -- and I was about 11, is -- at the -- that time\nthe New York Times had the war news on page two in official communiqu\u00e9s,\nissued by -- e-every day there was a communiqu\u00e9 by each of the combatant\ngovernments, including the Germans, and I re -- I -- I would read that. And so the\nwar was very, you know, important in that way, and remembered the wa -- the fact\nthat the windows in the school had masking tape on them in case we were bombed.\nAnd so I remember asking my parents now that the war was over, I asked my\nfather, would newspapers still be published. That was a serious question because\nthe -- I thought of newspapers as being war news, I didn\u2019t equate it with any other\nkind of news, and I didn\u2019t see any need for newspapers after the war. The\nnewspapers were to tell us about the war, and so no war, no newspapers.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t remember any specific celebration that your parents had that the\nwar was over?",
        "A: Well, th -- I have a very clear memory of my parents crying at -- at A-April 12\",\nI think it was, of 1945 when President Roosevelt died. Kind of -- that was the only\npresident we knew, and of course he, by signing that executive order, allowed us to\nstay in the United States, which was becoming precarious. So that\u2019s a clear\nmemory, Roosevelt\u2019s death. And after that I just grew up.\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "Q: And then more and more came out about the Holocaust. How did you -- you or\nyour family react to tho -- that news?",
        "A: Not really, I mean the -- the -- the thing that affected me most about the\nHolocaust, frankly, was as an adult traveling to Israel, and particularly being with\nJimmy Carter at the Yad Vashem. And I don\u2019t cry as an adult, but I did cry then,\nand I was one of a few reporters, and I think Carter may have known my story, or\nI may have said something to Jody Powell that -- without really going into it, why\nit was -- it was -- I said -- I think I said 1t was important to me personally to be at\nYad Vashem with President Carter, and would it be okay. And so I\u2019ve had these\nadult experiences. Another one I had of a similar nature was in 1993 when I\nhappened to be in Warsaw with Vice President Gore 1-in which Gore and the\nIsraeli president at the time, made a speech a-at the memorial for the -- the Jews on\nthe 50\" anniversary of the -- of the ghetto uprising, which was celebrated in\nWarsaw, and I just happened to be in Warsaw at the time, not for this, but Al\nGore and so on, so I was with Gore. And a-as a Washington Bureau Chief for the\nCox newspapers. And so I remember being very much affected by that ceremony,\nand crying. And -- and -- and just th-the thought that with -- with very few changes\nin parameters, that I could have been in that ghetto. And, you know, going to the\nHolocaust Museum and seeing children of my age walking in that large -- y-you\nFebruary 14, 2005\nknow what I mean, the -- the large kind of photograph, blown up photograph of the\nghetto with the trolley car coming through and everyone wearing the armbands and\nso on. I-I could easily see myself being there and that -- I would end on the note\nthat it was really quite remarkable that I wasn\u2019t there, and that we are having this\ninterview as I approach my 70\" year.",
        "Q: So you continued your schooling in New York. You -- you finished elementary\nschool and then what happened?",
        "A: Joan of Arc Junior High School, Bronx High School of Science, Yale College,\nand then a career in journalism followed -- a -- a short time in the army.",
        "Q: And did you share -- as you were growing up in high school and in college and\nso forth, did you share your background with other people? Did people know about\nthat?",
        "A: No. No, the only place I shared it was on my passport, which said I was born in\nWarsaw. But, no.",
        "Q: Purposely, or you just didn\u2019t think it was important?",
        "A: It was just part of my li -- my father, when I was a young adult s-said to me, I\nhave just three requests of you. And one of them was, never f -- never go to\nGermany. And the second one was, never buy a German car, although I think he\nsaid germ -- Mercedes Benz, but he meant German car. And he also asked me not\nFebruary 14, 2005\nto marry outside the faith. Tho-Those are the three -- he said, otherwise you can do\nanything you want in life. But guess which one of those requests I\u2019ve honored in --\nin life. None. But we got along fine.",
        "Q: So you said you chose to go into journalism, and you thought maybe it related to\nyour experience as a child following the war news?",
        "A: Well, just an exciting way of -- of -- as a high school student I worked at the\nNew York Herald Tribune delivering ads and picking up the weather map from\nthe weather bureau at the battery, and I earned enough money to travel, which I\noften enjoyed. So I traveled through western Europe, didn\u2019t go to eastern Europe\ntil qu-quite later. But I never thought of myself other than as an American, and the\nexperiences of the war was, I would say quite honestly that I [indecipherable]\nthought about it until this interview, I suppose I repressed them. People have asked\nme, why didn\u2019t I write about it, and that\u2019s a good question, I just didn\u2019t. I mean, I\nwas a writer, and I -- I read stories in the New Yorker that have -- about similar\nsubjects that have -- might say less poignancy or even less relevance than my own\nstory, if it were told that way, as a personal history. But I -- I just didn\u2019t do it. I\ndidn\u2019t want to. And why, I\u2019m not quite -- e-even to this day I\u2019m not quite clear\nwhy.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nFebruary 14, 2005\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Andrew Glass. This is tape number two, side\nB.",
        "A: Well, what Ill say is that over the years I\u2019ve gotten to know quite a few Polish\ndiplomats. I\u2019ve interviewed the Polish president, I\u2019ve interviewed the mayor of\nWarsaw, prime ministers and so on, and spent time in Poland. Parenthetically, my\nfather and mother traveled a good deal. My father was an international\nbusinessman, but he never returned to Poland, never returned to germa -- ne-never\nreturned to Germany. Traveled to Israel quite often, England, France, Italy.\nAustralia, of course, where were had family. An-an -- or they would meet in\nHonolulu or Easter Island or somewhere. But I got -- as I said, I got to know quite\na few Poles over the years, including the Pope, and so my view of the Polish role\nduring World War II, quite honestly I would say, is a lot more nuanced and quite\ndifferent than my father\u2019s -- what I regarded and still regard, I suppose, as a one-\ndimensional view that all Poles are bad. So generational-ly we never agreed, but we\nnever talked about that.",
        "Q: Becau -- you never talked about it because?",
        "A: Well, because it was -- I mean, my father\u2019s mind was made up on the subject\nFebruary 14, 2005\nand there was no point in my saying look, there were also Poles who, unlike the\nones that you condemn -- I mean, he made a great point for the fact that Hitler felt\ncomfortable cre -- setting up death camps in Poland and to my knowledge, I guess,\nCzechoslovakia, but th-that was -- th-the -- that he didn\u2019t feel comfortable in\nhaving say, death camps in France or Denmark or anywhere not on German soil\nthat wasn\u2019t Poland. And so that -- that weighed heavily with my father, that\nAuschwitz was in Poland and others, may -- five, six major death camps. And that,\nyou know, th-the numbers there are very stark. There was, at the time that the war\nbegan -- I told you earlier [indecipherable] story of our flight, there were\n3,100,000 Jews living in Poland. And while it\u2019s not -- the numbers are not quite\nprecise, they range between 100,000 and 150,000 who survived out of that total,\nwho were in Poland when the war began. Some had left to go to Israel, some had\nescaped earlier, but of the number that were there, I mean, you can do the math. It -\n- it -- 1t -- it\u2019s a very small -- and so, that has kind of created in my mind, Gail, a --\nhow to put it? A fact that I have a -- a -- a get out of jail free card. That e-every day\nthat I live, statistically I shouldn\u2019t be alive. And so I-I would, over time, as a\njournalist, I would find myself in some very dangerous places, like Detroit in the\nmiddle of a huge race riot, which was more of a National Guard riot, but that\u2019s\nanother story. Or in Afghanistan with the Soviet troops fighting the mujahideen.\nFebruary 14, 2005\nOr in the first Gulf War with the scuds coming over, and everybody kind of\nhiding, and I felt no fear. And I -- you know, the reaction was, you know, why --\nwhy were these people kind of afraid that they\u2019re going to die, bec -- and you\nknow, rationally there was a real risk that one of these mujahideen bullets that was\nmeant for the spiznars would hit me cause I was in the -- harm\u2019s way in each of\nthese cases. But I felt kind of like who -- well, you know, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m living on\nborrowed time anyway, so what? And so I\u2019m sure that it wou -- it\u2019s not going to\nhappen but if I was in Iraq today I would care less about my personal safety.",
        "Q: Which feeds into a question I was going to ask you a little later, is, do you think\nyou\u2019re a different kind of person than you would have been if you hadn\u2019t\nexperienced the childhood that you had? Let\u2019s say that you were born in the United\nStates and had a very relaxed early childhood. Is this because of what you did go\nthrough that you had these feelings?",
        "A: Well, it just -- as an a -- I suppose as an adult, the realization that I was a\nsurvivor and that the chances of surviving statistically in my particular case, 2200\nout of, I think 600,000 in Lithuania, almost all of whom died. I mean, the odds of\ngetting out were -- in the first instance out of Warsaw and in the second instance\nout of Lithuania, third instance not being arrested in -- in the Soviet Union as -- as\no-obvious bourgeois, and the fourth instance leaving Japan just at the right time or\nFebruary 14, 2005\nnot, a-as many in that group of 2200 choosing to go to the Dutch East Indies, it\nseemed like a good -- good idea at the time. I mean all -- or Shanghai -- all of\nthose were just, you know, five cushioned billiard shots, to arrive in San\nFrancisco, destitute financially, but -- but healthy and -- and ready to, you know,\nstart a new life. So I think honestly, that realization came to me only as a -- as an\nadult, or at least as a teenager, not as a child.",
        "Q: You finished college, and then did you say you went into the army, into the\nservice?",
        "A: Yeah -- no, I finished college and I went into journalism and then I was drafted\nand I served in the army, but never abroad. And then I went back to journalism and\neventually went to the New York Herald Tribune, which in 1962 sent me to\nWashington as -- that time, I was also married and we\u2019ve been -- been here since.\nThe Herald Tribune folded. I worked for awhile -- four years for the Washington\nPost, and then I worked for -- on the hill for a couple of years for Senator Javits as\nhis press secretary and Senator Percy as his administrative assistant. I returned to\njournalism in 1971 and worked four years for the \u201cNational Journal\u201d as an editor -\n- it\u2019s still going. And then in 1974 I joined Cox newspapers, which founded a\nbureau here and I worked from 1974 to 19 -- to 2001 for Cox newspapers, 21 of\nthose years as the chief of the Washington bureau. And had a year at Harvard as a\nFebruary 14, 2005\nfellow and then worked, and still do, for The Hill newspapers as a writer and for a\nwhile as the managing editor. And I\u2019m looking for other things to write about, but\nnot the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Y-You talked -- yo-you said you haven\u2019t written, and you just said, and not. Can\nyou just elaborate a little bit more, why not?",
        "A: Well, I -- I don\u2019t know. I mean, I -- obviously I should. I wrote -- I think I wrote\none column about ca -- 1t was a column about immigration policy in California and\nhow illegal aliens were being treated badly. And I told a little bit of my story, not a\nlot, but I mainly concentrated on my mother -- excuse me, on my mother-in-law,\nwho was also an illegal -- is -- I mean, I made the point that we were illegal aliens\nand that my father-in-law and mother-in-law were illegal. And she returned to her\nnative Italy after the war -- which was devastated. They were -- the family was\nfrom an area just south of Naples called Terra Del Greco, just in the shadow of\nMount Vesuvius near Pompeii and so she came back and then she wanted to\nreturn after about six months and her papers, as they say, were not in order. And\nthey wouldn\u2019t let her on the -- on the ship and so I think my sister\u2019s brothers went\nto see a congressman who was the head of the State Department committee that\narranged for the State Department to get money. He was State Justice Commerce\nAppropriations Chair John J. Rooney. And they pointed out to Rooney that\nFebruary 14, 2005\nnobody asked about the citizenship when two of my wife\u2019s brothers were killed in\nWorld War II, and so why were they raising these questions now? And so Rooney\nmade a -- a call to the State Department and -- or passed a private bill, or -- no, I\nthink he just made a call to the State Department, she was on the next boat back\nfrom Naples. And I told that story in a column that I wrote about, and that made an\nimpression on me that, you know, here were two relatively successful -- a Harvard\neducated psychiatrist and a Washington Bureau Chief who were, you know, from\nillegal aliens, so give me a break. So that was -- but that was a 600 word column,\nso that [indecipherable] ma-made an impact, on me anyway.",
        "Q: You said you have a son, did you -- when he was very, very young, up -- even a\ntoddler, did that bring back memories of what you had to go through when you\nwere his age?",
        "A: No, but one story, my am -- as I said, my -- my grandfather\u2019s house, there was a\nhousekeeper who, when this house -- mansion really, was taken over by the bil-\nbilleted Germans, she was of course, thrown out. And she managed to save a\ncottage cup -- two, I think. And so after the war -- a-a -- and a lot of this -- this --\nthis cottage cup was from mid-18\" century, and quite valuable, but more valuable\nas Silver, just to melt it down. And a lot of this stuff was melted down because\nthese people [indecipherable] but she saved it. And so my father helped her, of\nFebruary 14, 2005\ncourse; after the war they sent her money. And so when I went to Warsaw he\nasked me to look her up, she was 1n her mid-90\u2019s by that time. And she insisted that\nI take these cottage cups back with me, one of which I gave to my father. I don\u2019t\nknow what happened to it, I don\u2019t have it, maybe my mother has it. And one I kept\nmyself. And my son, who was a toddler -- a little older than a toddler, but about the\nsame age that I was when I arrived here, said Daddy, when you die, can I have this\ncup? And that was a profoundly imp -- imp -- it impressed me. It impressed me.\nAnd of course his mother was Catholic and I was Jewish and we had to decide\nwhether we\u2019re going to rear him as a Catholic or as a Jew, or none of the above,\nand so we reared him as a Jew, and so he is a Jew.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Has he been to Poland at all? Have you taken him and shown\nhim Warsaw?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think -- he\u2019s been to Prague, he\u2019s been to Berlin a couple of times,\nhe\u2019s going to Berlin next week. But he\u2019s never been to Warsaw. I\u2019d like him to go.",
        "Q: Do you consider yourself a Zionist?",
        "A: No, no, I consider myself an American. I have no Zionist feelings. And I\u2019ve\nbeen to Israel quite a bit, but only as a journalist, not as a Zionist. Not recently, but\na lot during the time of the -- the war and the -- and I\u2019ve gotten to know many\nIsraelis, I mean, we lived literally behind the Israeli ambassador\u2019s house, which\nFebruary 14, 2005\ndidn\u2019t used to have a fence when the ambassador was Yitzhak Rabin. So we got to\nknow Rabin, largely because my dog would often -- our little puppy then, would\noften end up in Rabin\u2019s backyard, so we would have to retrieve him and I got to\nknow Rabin that way, but also professionally wrote about him, and visited with\nhim when I went to Israel.",
        "Q: When you -- when you are in Israel, do you feel any connection to the country?",
        "A: No, I mean, no -- none -- no, no, no --",
        "Q: Or is it just another foreign country?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s a special place. I feel more at home there than say in Saudi Arabia,\nbut that\u2019s because it\u2019s a western democracy that has McDonald\u2019s and -- and\nparliament, the Knesset and so on. Not because I\u2019m Jewish or anything like that.\nBut I\u2019ve had close friends who made aliyah and who lived in Israel and I visited\nthem when I was in Israel for other pur -- not pa-particularly to see them, but while\ntaking -- taking in -- of course, some of the family, distant cousins ended up in\nIsrael, so --",

        "A: A-A-Anger, or regret or remorse, I-I -- I -- not anger.

        "Q: And how did you go, did you go with your family?",
        "A: No, with a -- just with a friend, just a-a -- as a -- just as -- for a three month trip.\nBut you know, that brought the war back very, very clearly. And I remember going\nFebruary 14, 2005\nto Italy where we stayed in youth hostels and a door would open very slowly and\nthe proprietor or the prop -- say Tedeschi, which is -- so she knew we weren\u2019t\nItalian -- which is Italian for Germans. And we say no, no, Americani. Oh,\nAmericani, bene, bene, bene, you know, so [indecipherable] couldn\u2019t -- so being\nan American in that -- in Europe at that time, eight years after the war, I guess,\nended, was still quite an experience.",
        "Q: Do you feel Polish in any way?",
        "A: No, no. I mean, I\u2019m on the list, so to speak, every time there\u2019s an event at the\nPolish embassy, they invite me and sometimes I go. And I\u2019ve been to the\nambassador\u2019s home -- he lives in the neighborhood -- for lunch and dinner and that\nkind of thing. And I -- I-I -- I -- when I was president of the Gridiron Club and sat\nnext to President Bush -- this was in 2001 -- you get to invite, you know, whoever\nyou want, and I just kind of, you know, on a lark I invited the Polish ambassador to\nthe dinner, he had never been to a Gridiron dinner, didn\u2019t know what it was. And I -\n- | made a joke, you know, Polish joke, and that they wanted not a -- a -- a Polish\npresident, they wanted a president with some polish. And Bush was very gracious,\nhe said that he -- he had been president then for just about three months and he told\nme off the record -- well, not off the record, just told me that he was planning to go\nto Poland, which was news, no one knew that. And I had -- one of the things I did\nFebruary 14, 2005\nwas to set up a -- a bureau in and within the bureau of [speaks Polish here] which\nmeans election newspaper in Polish. And so we had a correspondent there because\nCox had invested in -- in that newspaper after the fall of communism, helped them\nout. It was -- turned out to be a very good investment, we\u2019re de-investing it now,\nbut made a lot of money. Anyway, I had something to do with that. So we -- we\nhad this -- and I would make trips to Poland to help the newspapers set -- set it a --\nset up and exchange news, so I gave that news to the Gazetta correspondent who\nwas working in the Cox bureau, and so they had a big exclusive that Bush was\ncoming to Poland on a -- on -- on -- on good authority. I couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t give\nthem my source, but I said, you can take it to the bank, I know it\u2019s true. The guy I\ntalked to knows what he\u2019s talking about. And so I\u2019ve had lunch with the Polish\nambassador and so on, and we talk in Polish or in English, it\u2019s -- and it\u2019s -- and I\u2019m\ncomfortable with that.",
        "Q: And are you comfortable when you\u2019re in Poland walking on the streets of\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s interesting, because you know, I\u2019m identified as an American and I\u2019ve\n-- most of the trips I\u2019ve taken to Poland would have been with -- with the first\nPresident Bush, or with President Clinton, or with Jimmy Carter and I would just\nbe a member of the White House press corps, and they would make comments and\nFebruary 14, 2005\nbelieving that what they were saying wa -- and I -- you know, I would say nothing,\nbut then when I would leave, I would make a tart remark in Polish and their jaws\nwould drop. So that was fun, you know, to be a kind of a hidden Pole --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But other than that, no.",
        "Q: What are your feelings when you\u2019re in Germany\u201d",
        "A: Normal. It\u2019s the largest country in Europe and I\u2019ve been going to Germany -- |\nstar -- I guess I started going when we -- the economic summits started, which was\nin the late 70\u2019s, and they would -- as you know, they would rotate and one would\nbe in Bonn every seven years, so I would go to Bonn for that. And then I would go\nwith Carter to Berlin and I think I went with President Ford to Germany, I don\u2019t\nremember that, but I\u2019ve been there quite a bit. And recently on holiday with my\nwife, who just loved Berlin. And my son 1s going to Berlin next week. He\u2019s an\nMBA at Columbia and the class is going to Germany on some business trip. And\nhe wa -- also had a scholarship to Heidelberg and learned German at Yale, so -- all\nof that was after my father died.",

        "A: But, speaks really fluent German.",
        "Q: Do you think there are any lessons to be learned from what you experienced,\nwhat your family experienced?",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s got to be existential lesson of -- of how life is precious and how --\nwithout getting too deep about it, how the road taken and the road not taken can\nmake a very big difference in life. And -- and the randomness of who survives and\nwho doesn\u2019t survive, co-coupled with the low odds of survival have made an\nimpression on me, but not as a child, or even as a -- as a teenager, but more as an\nadult, and particularly late in life, which would lead to things like an interest in\ndoing this interview.",
        "Q: Why bef -- in -- in the years past, did you not feel the need, or did -- o-or why is\nit now that you feel more? Because of the stage of life we\u2019re in?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I mean I -- I\u2019ve just taken it in, the Holocaust Museum. We\nbecame friends with a couple that had a -- a lot to do -- a Baltimore couple that had\na lot to do with setting up the museum and they became close friends of ours. And\nthen I-I was on the convention plat -- convention arrangements committee for the\nAmerican Society of Newspaper Editors and I arranged for the editors to have a\nseparate and -- tour of the museum when the museum first opened, and of -- also\nfor Ted Koppel to lead in a very interesting discussion at the museum about\nFebruary 14, 2005\nHolocaust denial by the American press during World War II, and particularly the\nrole of the New York Times. So I had a -- you know, I\u2019ve had a -- a -- a role -- a\nrole that -- that way.",
        "Q: Y-You\u2019re talking about now, for instance, the New York Times not giving as\nmuch space in the paper to what was happening. Does that make you angry\u201d?",
        "A: No, but it\u2019s been well documented and they -- they didn\u2019t want to be -- a -- a-- a\nfriend of mine, Alex Jones wrote a book about history of the New York Times,\nand he was the creator -- cur -- cur -- curator of a program at Harvard that I\nparticipated in, the Kennedy School of Politics as a fellow, and of course he has a\nlot in there about the Times not wanting to identify itself as a Jewish newspaper\nduring World War I, and so that was --",
        "Q: That -- does that elicit any emotional feeling in -- in you?",
        "A: Truthfully no, no. Just -- one of the things, Gail, as you become a journalist, at\nleast in my generation of journalists is that you -- you -- you -- y-you step out of\nyour skin a lot. You feel that you\u2019re a somewhat classless person and that the very\nrich and the very important bear no special role in your life to the homeless person,\nthey have equal balance. And I feel that very strongly, I always have. And I -- 1-1-in\nthe sense that as a leader, a bureau chief and so on, I\u2019ve tried to inculcate leading\nby example, that you, in the younger generation of journalists, not to be in awe of --\nFebruary 14, 2005\nof the rich and powerful and not to be -- look down at anyone who is in trouble or\nin -- in jail or in -- in modest circumstances, treat them all the same, the same. And\nperhaps in my own background, you know, that growing up poor, but with a rich\nmentality if you will. That may have had something to do with why I became a\njournalist, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s too deep for me.",
        "Q: When you go into the Holocaust Museum here in Washington, does it give you\nany sp -- di-different feelings?",
        "A: Well, as I said, particularly the view of the Warsaw ghetto and the br -- the role\nof that. I\u2019ve recently visited the -- not a Holocaust museum, but a German -- a\nmuseum recently o -- that opened in -- in Berlin that traces the story of Jews in\nGermany, and I felt no particular -- I didn\u2019t have that feeling. But I\u2019ve been to\nWarsaw and talked to people who are trying to create a Holocaust museum against\nsome odds in -- in Warsaw, and so I tried to help them with the -- the sense of\ngiving them some -- some support.",
        "Q: Did you have any connection with Professor Jan Karski when he was living in\nWashington and teaching at Georgetown?",
        "A: Yes, I knew him and I talked to him. I met him at the embassy, I had several\nmeals with him. I met him also in Warsaw when he was back there, not that long\nago, shortly before he died. I knew him. He was a very important figure, yup.\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "Q: Did you feel a Polish connection to him, being born in Poland yourself?",
        "A: Well, I feel a connection to Poles and -- and I\u2019m Polish, I mean that -- it says in\nWho\u2019s Who in America, born in Warsaw, so that won\u2019t go away. Maybe the\nlisting in Who\u2019s Who will end, but being born in Warsaw, well, that stays.",
        "Q: Well, as you say, is there anything we haven\u2019t talked about that you wanted to\nsay on the tape?",
        "A: What I wanted to say Gail is that I\u2019ve been interviewed in different\ncircumstances on -- and I m-mainly been on the other side of that microphone, and\nI don\u2019t recall a more thorough, professional interview than the one that you have\njust concluded.",

We have the names of those who were my grandfather and great-\ngrandfather and great-great-gran-grandfather. Going back I think to the latter part\nof the 18\" century. And I think my mother\u2019s family was also Polish, although sh --\nas a -- as a girl she lived in Moscow during World War I. My father\u2019s father, Jacob\nwas a banker, and he was totally assimilated in the Polish culture, he -- although\nthe family was Jewish, they regarded themselves first as Poles and second as Jews.\nRemember that in the Warsaw of 1939, one third of the population was Jewish.

So I think he just\nmanaged real estate properties for my grandfather, including the one that we lived\nin, that I mentioned earlier.",
        "A: No, no. My mother, who is still alive, she was born in 1912, and so will be 93\nthis year, unhappily suffered from postpartum psychosis when I was born, so I\nFebruary 14, 2005\ndidn\u2019t see my mother -- although I didn\u2019t hear about this until much later, until\naround the time that I was two, two and a half.

And then, in their early 20\u2019s\nthey paired off and my parents paired off and married. I think my father was -- my\nparents were 22 at the time. My father, by the way, was the youngest of six or\nseven, I for -- forget, two of whom survived the war, besides my father, but did not\nescape, they were -- they were in -- in the ge-German labor camps in Germany,\ntwo sisters. And at that time, un-under Polish Jewish tradition, you weren't\nFebruary 14, 2005\nsupposed to marry until your sisters married. So this was an elopement because it\nwas a-against the tradition of the family. But somehow 1-it all worked out.",

However, they\ninsisted that I have a Jewish education and I was -- at that time we didn\u2019t have Bar\nMitzvahs, we had something called confirmation. So I went through about a seven\nyear program at Temple Emmanuel on Fifth Avenue and 65\" Street, which\nstarted actually shortly after I arrived in the United States, and ended when I was\n13.",

A-A-As the war approached, as -- strike that -- as it became clear, or clearer\nthat Poland was in jeopardy from an -- German attack, the Poles made some\nFebruary 14, 2005\ndecisions which changed my parents fortunes greatly and to the worse. Pole -- the\nPolish government passed a decree in -- I believe in the summer or spring of 1939,\nwhich was aimed at Jews, and to a lesser extent at Germans who controlled almost\nall of Polish industry at the time, that hard currencies, non-zlotys, held abroad by\nPoles, had to be repatriated and converted to Polish money, the zloty. That law\nwas, as you might imagine, not totally adhered to. In fact, there is now quite a\nnumber of cases involving funds that were put in Switzerland in secret accounts by\nprecisely -- by contemporaries of my grandfather who were faced with this\nsituation and whose heirs are now either receiving or just seeking to prove that --\nthat these funds were theirs. But any event, my grandfather had considerable sums\nabroad 1n -- particularly in Switzerland and in New York and London, 1-in the\norder of millions of dollars. And in part because he was a Polish patriot and in part\nbecause he was fearful of not breaking the law, all of this money was repatriated to\nPoland, and there were no funds in New York, there were no funds in any other\nplace. So, when my parents eventually arrived in New York with a one week visa\nto stay in the United States, they were -- they were destitute, pa -- financially\ndestitute. Interestingly, my father -- a-as you recall, in 1939 there was a World\u2019s\nFair in New York, and the ability of Poles, particularly of -- of people of means to\nget U.S. visas to visit the World\u2019s Fair was -- wa -- things kind of opened up, you\nFebruary 14, 2005\ncould -- you could get a -- a visa to go to the World\u2019s Fair, and you could take a\nship from Poland or from France and come here tha -- in the summer of 1939. My\nfather proposed to my grandfather that he -- when this law was passed, that he sign\nhi -- these assets over to my father and that my father come ostensibly to visit the\nWorld\u2019s Fair, but he had the impression, which was probably correct, that if he was\nsitting in New York with four or five million dollars, that you could probably find\na -- a ways and means not to get kicked out. But my grandfather vetoed the plan\nand I often wondered how my life would have changed if -- for the better or for the\nworse, had he said, all right, go to New York, and if they had arrived in New York\nin that fashion rather than in the rather different circumstances that brought us to\nthe United States.",

My father\u2019s resentment against Poland,\nwhich he held until his death in 1993, was really centered around Polish anti-S-\nSemitism that was displayed after the war began, and during the war. And he wrote\nmany letters, some to the New York Times, some of -- of which were published, to\nthe Jewish publications and so on and was e-extremely active in Jewish charities\nduring his life and gave a -- a -- particularly the United Jewish Appeal.

        "A: No. I -- w-wa -- when the war -- as you know, when the war began in the first\nweek of September, my father, who had somewhat impaired vision and was also\nJewish, for both those reasons was not drafted into the Polish army. But -- and the\nwar began, either -- I\u2019m not clear whether it was on a volunteer basis or on a draft\nbasis, was inducted into a kind of home army or home civil defense corps, who-\nwhose primary task was to fill sandbags around public buildings and to clear the\nrubble from the German bombings. And t-to put up defenses as it were against -- ba\n-- sandbags against th-the prospect of -- of other public monuments and buildings\nbeing bombed in subsequent days. In any event this was almost a full-time job, he\njust was rarely home, as that was reported to me. In about the 12\" day of the war,\nhe was working alongside a stranger who happened -- a Gentile, who happened to\nbe a taxi driver. And they began talking about what a good idea it might be for both\nfamilies to get the heck out of Warsaw, since the bombing was continuing and\nintensifying, and since the evidence from the BBC and from German radio, if not\nPolish radio was that the G-Germans were coming closer and you could hear the\nartillery fire from three sides. So the problem was that the taxi driver didn\u2019t have\nany gas for his taxi. And this part was always -- I never could get my father to quite\nexplain whether he had a stash of gasoline or he had a stash of gold, or he knew\nhow on the black market to get it, it was always fuzzy. But the bottom line is, my\nFebruary 14, 2005\nfather procured gas for this taxi. So taxi plus gas meant that both families fled in\nthe dawn hours of September 13\". I think a day or so, or maybe hours before -- you\ncan check it -- the -- the bridges across the Vistula were severed. Warsaw itself\nheld out against German attack until the end of the month. And some people also\nescaped by boat and so on and found ways out. But basically we left and traveled\neast, around the time that that opportunity shut down. Others traveled south toward\nRomania and survived, but we traveled due east until the tax1 ran out of gas, and\nthen we separated from the taxi driver and his family and we somehow got a horse\nand cart and kept going east.",

        "A: Diamond rings, and gold and people wanting to -- currency manipulation,\ndollars and British pounds and so on. He was operating on the fringes of the\ngalaxy, but during that time there was a progressive tightening of the noose by the\nSoviets. At first it was to insist on a change of government that was more friendly\nto the Soviet point of view, then that government invited, quote unquote, Soviets to\nopen bases in Lithuania and eventually that led to a de facto Soviet occupation\nmuch like the S-Syrians in Lebanon and then finally to annexation of Lithuania as\na SSR as the Soviet Socialist Republic, which it continued to be until 1991. So we\nlived through all of that, and during the time we were in Lithuania, the -- the\nSoviet presence and the s -- importance of the Soviets materially increased.

The reason 1s that basically\nthey survived World War I, and while there were privations and problems, and\nseveral armies swept through Warsaw, the Prussians, the Austrians, the Russians\nand so on, basically civilians survived and were not considered combatants. World\nWar II, of course, had a much different aspect.

        "A: Yes, but there\u2019s a st -- there\u2019s a story involving my father\u2019s second trip back in\nthe winter of 1940. At -- by that time, the Polish Lithuanian border was patrolled\nboth by Soviet and Lithuanian troops, but not jointly. And on his way back from\nthe second, futile mission to Warsaw, he was walking along the railroad track in\nthe snow with the pair of pants that ended up in the museum, and he was a-a-\narrested, I guess, or -- by a Lithuanian patrol. My father said that had he\nencountered a Soviet patrol there would have been no question that he would have\nbeen shot, because he had no proper papers or -- you know, he was a Pole at -- with\n-- at least suspicious, and probably a spy. Any event, the Lithuanians, according to\nFebruary 14, 2005\nmy father\u2019s story, took him to their outpost, gave him his watch and gave him his\nmoney, gave him his shoes, and was kind of held there for overnight, and in the\nmorning, not knowing what his fate would be, the -- the captain, who was\nsomewhat educated, said, we\u2019ve been thinking about your situation and what we\u2019ve\ndecided is that we\u2019re going to ask you a question. And based on your answer to this\nquestion, quite frankly, we\u2019re either going to sh -- let you go or shoot you. Which\nwas -- kind of concentrated his mind.

And my father\u2019s response, according to my father was, what a\nsilly question, why would you ask me a question like that? Everybody knows\nRoosevelt\u2019s Jewish. And then they said, all right, get out of here. And he walked in\nthe snow in his socks and somehow made it back to Wilno. So that -- I think that\nstory is worth mem-memorializing because it epitomizes -- you say in Polish\n[speaks Polish here], which means, yi -- it was such a time, which never existed\nbefore and will never exist again. [speaks Polish here]. And that was a -- a\nvignette from that time.",
        "A: Yeah, then -- o-of course there was -- there were -- he was looking to get -- I\nmean, knowing that the Soviets were tightening their noose around the -- Li-\nFebruary 14, 2005\nLithuania and that it was an unhealthy place to -- to remain and of course the story\nof the Lithuanian Jews is a very sad story, very few, if any, survived after the\nGermans invaded in June of 1941. So in that winter, he en -- made a really great\neffort to try to get out and we were very fortunate that through a strange series of\ncircumstances we were able to leave. And it -- we may be described as a trifecta 1-\nin the sense that there were three elements to -- to it, and if any of the three\nelements failed, we would have not survived. The first element was a -- a\nDutchman who was the honorary consul of the Dutch government in Lithuania\nand whose job was to sell Philips radios. And he decided that anyone who applied\ncould get residence in Curacao which was then a Dutch colony. Course, what was\nnot known is that the governor of Curacao was not allowing anybody to get in, but\nyou could get a piece of paper that said you had residence status or invitation to\nbecome a resident of the island of Curacao. And with that piece of paper you could\nthen seek transit visas to get to Curacao. You needed basically three visas. You\nneeded a Russian -- Soviet visa, you needed a Japanese visa, then you needed to\ncross the Atlantic and get an American visa to get you to Curacao. So there was in\n-- and this is very well known and we don\u2019t have to go into detail about this, there\nwas a Japanese council in Lithuania, in the Lithuanian capital, kow -- kow --\nKowsis?\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "A: Kaunas -- named Sigahura, who -- who I -- whose widow I met at the Japanese\nembassy some years ago, and who issued 2200 of -- of these transit visas to Japan,\nwhich he did wi -- against the express orders of the Japanese foreign ministry in\nTokyo -- to Jews. And our names and the record 1s there, it\u2019s on the internet, too.\nWe got three of these, and with that -- that was two -- two parts of the trifecta. The\nthird part -- and this part is less well known and deserves to be discussed in some\ndetail, was to get the Soviet -- permission from the Soviets to leave Vilnius and to\ntravel to Japan. And they were selling a package deal, where you got the visa, and\nthe ticket on the Trans-Siberian railroad, which at that ttme was something like a\n16 day trip from Moscow to Vladivostok. And if you ask what I remember, I\nremember that trip very vividly, because it was 1n the winter of 1940, and it was\nvery cold, and I guess I was tur -- just turning five. So the first problem was how to\nget -- because the Soviets said, the only way you could get this -- and we needed\n600 dollars for three visas, the only way you get six -- the only -- excuse me, the\nonly way the Soviets would do business with you was in dollars. And any resident\nof Vilnius who was caught with dollars on his or her possession was automatically\nshipped to Siberia, but not with a visa, and so it was a kind of a catch 22. You\nneeded the dollars in order to get the visas, but if you had the dollars that was\nFebruary 14, 2005\nprima facie evidence that you were -- had illegal currency and you were subject to\nimmediate arrest. My father -- I don\u2019t know if this is part of this -- I guess,\nsurviving the Holocaust, so we can go wi -- through this if you like. My father\ncame up with an ingenious plan. He had a double envelope. He put the money in an\nenvelope, and in the o -- in the outer envelope he said, this money is to be used\nsolely and only for the purpose of attaining three exit visas and tr-tr -- or rather,\ntransit visas to -- through the Soviet Union. And some of these visas were granted,\nand some people were arrested, as I was told. And some visas were not granted, but\nthey were not arrested. Almost all the interviews took place around three or four in\nthe morning tha -- you were summoned to the KGB headquarters where all this\nwas happening in downtown Vilnius. And among the questions that were asked\nwas, if you do go to the new world, if you do get to the United States, w-would\nyou be interested in helping us, helping the great Soviet Union complete its\nmission of liberating the world. In other words, would you s -- become a -- a spy,\nor an agent. So this was a very difficult time. And the third part of this trifecta, I\nthink my father is proudest of having navigated that particular rapids. And so we\ndid get those visas, and we did go to Moscow, I do remember Moscow in 1941.\nFebruary 14, 2005",

I would say\nthere were maybe 300 people on the boat, that would be about right.\nFebruary 14, 2005",

        "A: I don\u2019t remember any, no, no, I don\u2019t re -- there may have been, but I don\u2019t\nremember any. I remember children on the Kamakura Maru because there was\nalso a -- a zoo that was traveling to San Francisco -- or not a zoo, a circus, and\nthere were tigers and lions in cages on the -- on the deck and so I remember playing\nwith the kids and with -- with the wild animals as it were, but -- and seeing how\nclose we could come without getting swiped. But just to finish, so these -- so my\nfather again, told me the story that this one Gentile fellow, who somehow was also\na refugee, but wasn\u2019t affected -- didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t have the same story as we did, th-\nth-the Japanese -- th-the -- the Jewish Japanese said okay, we\u2019ll take him too. In\nother words, why -- why would we send him back to Russia? Even though he\u2019s not\nJewish, we\u2019ll take care of him.\nFebruary 14, 2005",
        "A: Well, I remember Japan very clearly. This is, of course, pre-war Japan. I\nremember downtown Tokyo very well. And I remember, in fact, riding in a trolley\ncar, they had green trolley cars and we were passing the imperial palace, the trolley\ncar passed in front of the palace, and all of the ri -- passengers got out of their seats\nand bowed in the direction of the palaces toward the emperor. And I remember\nasking my mother why weren\u2019t we bowing too, and said well that\u2019s, you know --\nshe said something in the effect -- effectively, that\u2019s not our thing, that\u2019s the local\nthing and we don\u2019t do that. But I remember the department store Takashima,\nwhere there was a 14 story department store that was -- had a -- a three story slide\non the roof, and how exciting it was for me to slide -- walk up the ladder -- and my\nparents let me do it, slide down these three stories, so -- that was a time when my\nfather\u2019s main occupation was finding a way out of Japan. And he managed to do\nso by getting a residence visa to the Dominican Republic, who were -- at that time\nthe dictator of the Dominican Republic, Trujillo was interested in Europeanizing\nand bringing in educated Europeans into -- into the -- Hispaniola. And so we were\ngranted three visas, residence visas to the Dominican Republic, and on the basis of\nthat visa, we got one week transit visas from the American consul in Tokyo. So\nthat when we got off the Kamakura Maru, we could get on a train in San\nFebruary 14, 2005\nFrancisco, change in trains in Chicago and then take a train to New York and then\ntake a ship to the Dominican Republic, but we never did that.",
        "A: No. No, I didn\u2019t. I mean, I knew I was crossing the Pacific Ocean and I have\nvery clear memories of -- of Pearl Harbor and Honolulu when the ship docked\nthere for a couple of days, bu-but -- before it went on.\nmean anything? Did America have any meaning for you in any sense?",
        "A: No, not at all, 1t was just the great adventure, that we were traveling. I mean,\nwe'd been on this train, and now we were on -- and living in Japan was a lot of\nfun, cause I was kind of a street kid, and learning Japanese very quickly. And then\nbeing on this boat. And that took about, oh, three weeks to cross the Pacific. It\nwasn\u2019t a fast boat. And it was a lot of fun, I mean, I would go with my parents into\nthese very hot baths which the Japanese had, and then you\u2019d get out of the bath and\nhave a cold bucket of ice water thrown on you. It was a lot of fun. I didn't feel I was\na refugee in that sense, no.",
        "A: I suppose so. I -- I remember playing with Japanese kids, but this was a -- you\nknow, a lot of the Japanese -- a lot of the people in our [indecipherable] did not\nFebruary 14, 2005\nget these Dominican visas. Some of them got Dutch visas to go to the Dutch East\nIndies. And they suffered terribly, many of them died, wi -- after the Japanese\ninvasion of what is now Indonesia. The ones, the [indecipherable] people, the\nones who could get visas to nowhere, when the war began about six months after\nwe left Japan, went to Shanghai and spent the war in Shanghai. None of them\nstayed in Japan. And the Jewish community in Shanghai, I just know anecdotally,\nwhile had many privations, basically survived, too. Many of them made it to\nAustralia, South America, some to the United States. So it\u2019s literally, I mean,\nand quite clearly a -- a Diaspora.\nFebruary 14, 2005\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",

A-All those battleships and\naircraft carriers in one place. Probably not a good idea, but that was where they\nwere, and we -- I think we -- my father must have had some money, a little bit of\nmoney, because he chartered a -- or hired a taxicab and we kind of took a trip\naround the island to just s -- go to Diamondhead and -- and see. It was one of\nthose beautiful spring days that you have in Hawaii, so I have a clear memory of\nthat.

        "A: Oh well, there wasn\u2019t an -- this was early in th -- relatively early in the war, and\nwhile we knew that the -- the Nazis were anti-Semitic and we knew that a lot of\nJews had left because of that, we had no idea of the Holocaust, per se, no. My\nfather wanted very much to get his family out because he feared for their lives, this\nearly. But he had no direct evidence other than, as we know, the creation of the\nghetto, the -- the tightening of the noose, as it were, the -- m-my grandfather never\nwent to the ghetto, it -- they -- when it became clear he couldn\u2019t stay in Warsaw\nany more, they went to a small town in eastern Poland where they were eventually\nshot in 1943.",

So they were\nnever in -- in a death camp, they were just hauled out of their -- where they were\nstaying and -- and killed. Incidentally, I had a maternal great-grandmother who, at\nthe time the war began was 103. And she ended up 1n a small town not too far from\nFebruary 14, 2005\nWarsaw, and when she was 104, she was doing some, what might be called relief\nwork. She was bringing food to Jews who were hiding and something like that,\nnever fearing for her own life, but there was a curfew. After dark you were subject\nto arrest or worse, and she was summarily shot. So she ended her life with a\nGerman bullet at 104.",

        "A: Yeah, I was a kid in -- in New York, and my father an -- tried to find some\nwork. He contacted my -- his father\u2019s broker, my grandfather\u2019s broker, who -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t know if they lent him some money, they possibly did. But since my\ngrandfather had millions of dollars invested in Wall Street, they -- until he pulled it\nout, they -- I mean, they wrote a le -- a letter of reference for my father, which he\nsought to use effectively with the immigration authorities stalling them from\ndeporting him because we were illegal aliens. And while that case was pending\nagainst us, trying to get us to leave the country, the Japanese bombed Pearl\nHarbor and started World War II. And under American law at the time, my father,\nFebruary 14, 2005\nwho was a lawyer, as I said, was familiar with American immigration law, and we -\n- and then -- st -- st -- Justice Department had every right to deport us. But under\nU.S. law they could only deport us to the country that we had immediately entered\nfrom, which was the empire of Japan. Or our native country, which was the\nPoland that was under German occupation. So they said you had to leave, but there\nwas a catch 22 there in our favor. They couldn\u2019t tell us where to go, cause there\nwas no place to go. And then, during the war, of course, th-there was -- as you\nknow, under the immigration law there was a Polish quota, and that Polish quota\nfor immigrants was subscribed until something like 1960, 20 years. But President\nRoosevelt signed an executive order that basically said that unfilled slots, that is\npeople who were supposed to arrive say in 1942, but didn\u2019t arrive because they\nwere trapped behind German lines, an -- those slots could be filled by people who\nhave -- who are otherwise of good character, never mind how they got here. And\non that basis, I think around 1943, while we were still in limbo as it were, we\nemigrated to Canada and re-entered as le-legally with -- with these immigration\nvisas that were given to us in Canada. And then in 1948 we became USS. citizens,\nfive years later. I became a U.S. citizen, 1948.\nFebruary 14, 2005",

        "A: Yes, yes, they were both working, and I had this curious experience of being\nthere -- how to put it? There are children who grew up in very modest\nFebruary 14, 2005\ncircumstances and whose parents somehow became wealthy.

And so that -- that weighed heavily with my father, that\nAuschwitz was in Poland and others, may -- five, six major death camps. And that,\nyou know, th-the numbers there are very stark. There was, at the time that the war\nbegan -- I told you earlier [indecipherable] story of our flight, there were\n3,100,000 Jews living in Poland. And while it\u2019s not -- the numbers are not quite\nprecise, they range between 100,000 and 150,000 who survived out of that total,\nwho were in Poland when the war began. Some had left to go to Israel, some had\nescaped earlier, but of the number that were there, I mean, you can do the math. It -\n- it -- 1t -- it\u2019s a very small -- and so, that has kind of created in my mind, Gail, a --\nhow to put it? A fact that I have a -- a -- a get out of jail free card. That e-every day\nthat I live, statistically I shouldn\u2019t be alive. And so I-I would, over time, as a\njournalist, I would find myself in some very dangerous places, like Detroit in the\nmiddle of a huge race riot, which was more of a National Guard riot, but that\u2019s\nanother story. Or in Afghanistan with the Soviet troops fighting the mujahideen.\nFebruary 14, 2005\nOr in the first Gulf War with the scuds coming over, and everybody kind of\nhiding, and I felt no fear. And I -- you know, the reaction was, you know, why --\nwhy were these people kind of afraid that they\u2019re going to die, bec -- and you\nknow, rationally there was a real risk that one of these mujahideen bullets that was\nmeant for the spiznars would hit me cause I was in the -- harm\u2019s way in each of\nthese cases. But I felt kind of like who -- well, you know, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m living on\nborrowed time anyway, so what? And so I\u2019m sure that it wou -- it\u2019s not going to\nhappen but if I was in Iraq today I would care less about my personal safety.",
        "A: Well, it just -- as an a -- I suppose as an adult, the realization that I was a\nsurvivor and that the chances of surviving statistically in my particular case, 2200\nout of, I think 600,000 in Lithuania, almost all of whom died. I mean, the odds of\ngetting out were -- in the first instance out of Warsaw and in the second instance\nout of Lithuania, third instance not being arrested in -- in the Soviet Union as -- as\no-obvious bourgeois, and the fourth instance leaving Japan just at the right time or\nFebruary 14, 2005\nnot, a-as many in that group of 2200 choosing to go to the Dutch East Indies, it\nseemed like a good -- good idea at the time. I mean all -- or Shanghai -- all of\nthose were just, you know, five cushioned billiard shots, to arrive in San\nFrancisco, destitute financially, but -- but healthy and -- and ready to, you know,\nstart a new life. So I think honestly, that realization came to me only as a -- as an\nadult, or at least as a teenager, not as a child.",
        "A: Yeah -- no, I finished college and I went into journalism and then I was drafted\nand I served in the army, but never abroad. And then I went back to journalism and\neventually went to the New York Herald Tribune, which in 1962 sent me to\nWashington as -- that time, I was also married and we\u2019ve been -- been here since.\nThe Herald Tribune folded. I worked for awhile -- four years for the Washington\nPost, and then I worked for -- on the hill for a couple of years for Senator Javits as\nhis press secretary and Senator Percy as his administrative assistant. I returned to\njournalism in 1971 and worked four years for the \u201cNational Journal\u201d as an editor -\n- it\u2019s still going. And then in 1974 I joined Cox newspapers, which founded a\nbureau here and I worked from 1974 to 19 -- to 2001 for Cox newspapers, 21 of\nthose years as the chief of the Washington bureau. And had a year at Harvard as a\nFebruary 14, 2005\nfellow and then worked, and still do, for The Hill newspapers as a writer and for a\nwhile as the managing editor. And I\u2019m looking for other things to write about, but\nnot the Holocaust.",
        "A: Well, I -- I don\u2019t know. I mean, I -- obviously I should. I wrote -- I think I wrote\none column about ca -- 1t was a column about immigration policy in California and\nhow illegal aliens were being treated badly. And I told a little bit of my story, not a\nlot, but I mainly concentrated on my mother -- excuse me, on my mother-in-law,\nwho was also an illegal -- is -- I mean, I made the point that we were illegal aliens\nand that my father-in-law and mother-in-law were illegal. And she returned to her\nnative Italy after the war -- which was devastated. They were -- the family was\nfrom an area just south of Naples called Terra Del Greco, just in the shadow of\nMount Vesuvius near Pompeii and so she came back and then she wanted to\nreturn after about six months and her papers, as they say, were not in order. And\nthey wouldn\u2019t let her on the -- on the ship and so I think my sister\u2019s brothers went\nto see a congressman who was the head of the State Department committee that\narranged for the State Department to get money. He was State Justice Commerce\nAppropriations Chair John J. Rooney. And they pointed out to Rooney that\nFebruary 14, 2005\nnobody asked about the citizenship when two of my wife\u2019s brothers were killed in\nWorld War II, and so why were they raising these questions now? And so Rooney\nmade a -- a call to the State Department and -- or passed a private bill, or -- no, I\nthink he just made a call to the State Department, she was on the next boat back\nfrom Naples. And I told that story in a column that I wrote about, and that made an\nimpression on me that, you know, here were two relatively successful -- a Harvard\neducated psychiatrist and a Washington Bureau Chief who were, you know, from\nillegal aliens, so give me a break. So that was -- but that was a 600 word column,\nso that [indecipherable] ma-made an impact, on me anyway.",
        "A: No, but one story, my am -- as I said, my -- my grandfather\u2019s house, there was a\nhousekeeper who, when this house -- mansion really, was taken over by the bil-\nbilleted Germans, she was of course, thrown out. And she managed to save a\ncottage cup -- two, I think. And so after the war -- a-a -- and a lot of this -- this --\nthis cottage cup was from mid-18\" century, and quite valuable, but more valuable\nas Silver, just to melt it down. And a lot of this stuff was melted down because\nthese people [indecipherable] but she saved it. And so my father helped her, of\nFebruary 14, 2005\ncourse; after the war they sent her money. And so when I went to Warsaw he\nasked me to look her up, she was 1n her mid-90\u2019s by that time. And she insisted that\nI take these cottage cups back with me, one of which I gave to my father. I don\u2019t\nknow what happened to it, I don\u2019t have it, maybe my mother has it. And one I kept\nmyself. And my son, who was a toddler -- a little older than a toddler, but about the\nsame age that I was when I arrived here, said Daddy, when you die, can I have this\ncup? And that was a profoundly imp -- imp -- it impressed me. It impressed me.\nAnd of course his mother was Catholic and I was Jewish and we had to decide\nwhether we\u2019re going to rear him as a Catholic or as a Jew, or none of the above,\nand so we reared him as a Jew, and so he is a Jew.",

Not recently, but\na lot during the time of the -- the war and the -- and I\u2019ve gotten to know many\nIsraelis, I mean, we lived literally behind the Israeli ambassador\u2019s house, which\nFebruary 14, 2005\ndidn\u2019t used to have a fence when the ambassador was Yitzhak Rabin. So we got to\nknow Rabin, largely because my dog would often -- our little puppy then, would\noften end up in Rabin\u2019s backyard, so we would have to retrieve him and I got to\nknow Rabin that way, but also professionally wrote about him, and visited with\nhim when I went to Israel.",

        "A: Well, it\u2019s a special place. I feel more at home there than say in Saudi Arabia,\nbut that\u2019s because it\u2019s a western democracy that has McDonald\u2019s and -- and\nparliament, the Knesset and so on.

        "A: Yeah, as a 17 year old, and seeing, you know, devastated cities and seeing the\ndamage in -- in central London, seeing even worse damage along the Belgian coast\nwhere we were cycling, Ostend, Brussels, so on.",
        "A: No, with a -- just with a friend, just a-a -- as a -- just as -- for a three month trip.\nBut you know, that brought the war back very, very clearly. And I remember going\nFebruary 14, 2005\nto Italy where we stayed in youth hostels and a door would open very slowly and\nthe proprietor or the prop -- say Tedeschi, which is -- so she knew we weren\u2019t\nItalian -- which is Italian for Germans.

        "A: No, no. I mean, I\u2019m on the list, so to speak, every time there\u2019s an event at the\nPolish embassy, they invite me and sometimes I go. And I\u2019ve been to the\nambassador\u2019s home -- he lives in the neighborhood -- for lunch and dinner and that\nkind of thing. And I -- I-I -- I -- when I was president of the Gridiron Club and sat\nnext to President Bush -- this was in 2001 -- you get to invite, you know, whoever\nyou want, and I just kind of, you know, on a lark I invited the Polish ambassador to\nthe dinner, he had never been to a Gridiron dinner, didn\u2019t know what it was. And I -\n- | made a joke, you know, Polish joke, and that they wanted not a -- a -- a Polish\npresident, they wanted a president with some polish. And Bush was very gracious,\nhe said that he -- he had been president then for just about three months and he told\nme off the record -- well, not off the record, just told me that he was planning to go\nto Poland, which was news, no one knew that. And I had -- one of the things I did\nFebruary 14, 2005\nwas to set up a -- a bureau in and within the bureau of [speaks Polish here] which\nmeans election newspaper in Polish. And so we had a correspondent there because\nCox had invested in -- in that newspaper after the fall of communism, helped them\nout. It was -- turned out to be a very good investment, we\u2019re de-investing it now,\nbut made a lot of money. Anyway, I had something to do with that. So we -- we\nhad this -- and I would make trips to Poland to help the newspapers set -- set it a --\nset up and exchange news, so I gave that news to the Gazetta correspondent who\nwas working in the Cox bureau, and so they had a big exclusive that Bush was\ncoming to Poland on a -- on -- on -- on good authority. I couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t give\nthem my source, but I said, you can take it to the bank, I know it\u2019s true. The guy I\ntalked to knows what he\u2019s talking about. And so I\u2019ve had lunch with the Polish\nambassador and so on, and we talk in Polish or in English, it\u2019s -- and it\u2019s -- and I\u2019m\ncomfortable with that.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s interesting, because you know, I\u2019m identified as an American and I\u2019ve\n-- most of the trips I\u2019ve taken to Poland would have been with -- with the first\nPresident Bush, or with President Clinton, or with Jimmy Carter and I would just\nbe a member of the White House press corps, and they would make comments and\nFebruary 14, 2005\nbelieving that what they were saying wa -- and I -- you know, I would say nothing,\nbut then when I would leave, I would make a tart remark in Polish and their jaws\nwould drop.

And then I would go\nwith Carter to Berlin and I think I went with President Ford to Germany, I don\u2019t\nremember that, but I\u2019ve been there quite a bit. And recently on holiday with my\nwife, who just loved Berlin. And my son 1s going to Berlin next week. He\u2019s an\nMBA at Columbia and the class is going to Germany on some business trip.

And -- and the randomness of who survives and\nwho doesn\u2019t survive, co-coupled with the low odds of survival have made an\nimpression on me, but not as a child, or even as a -- as a teenager, but more as an\nadult, and particularly late in life, which would lead to things like an interest in\ndoing this interview.",

We\nbecame friends with a couple that had a -- a lot to do -- a Baltimore couple that had\na lot to do with setting up the museum and they became close friends of ours. And\nthen I-I was on the convention plat -- convention arrangements committee for the\nAmerican Society of Newspaper Editors and I arranged for the editors to have a\nseparate and -- tour of the museum when the museum first opened, and of -- also\nfor Ted Koppel to lead in a very interesting discussion at the museum about\nFebruary 14, 2005\nHolocaust denial by the American press during World War II, and particularly the\nrole of the New York Times.

        "A: Truthfully no, no. Just -- one of the things, Gail, as you become a journalist, at\nleast in my generation of journalists is that you -- you -- you -- y-you step out of\nyour skin a lot. You feel that you\u2019re a somewhat classless person and that the very\nrich and the very important bear no special role in your life to the homeless person,\nthey have equal balance. And I feel that very strongly, I always have. And I -- 1-1-in\nthe sense that as a leader, a bureau chief and so on, I\u2019ve tried to inculcate leading\nby example, that you, in the younger generation of journalists, not to be in awe of --\nFebruary 14, 2005\nof the rich and powerful and not to be -- look down at anyone who is in trouble or\nin -- in jail or in -- in modest circumstances, treat them all the same, the same. And\nperhaps in my own background, you know, that growing up poor, but with a rich\nmentality if you will. That may have had something to do with why I became a\njournalist, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s too deep for me.",
