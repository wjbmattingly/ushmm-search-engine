And at that time we had the old\nschooner, Alexandria, 125 foot [indecipherable] schooner. And I started a\nboatbuilding school to ha-have something for the kids at Alexandria and\nWashington \u2014 whole Washington area to do. And we \u2014 we \u2014 it really took off, I\nwas amazed at that. You know, wh-when I went to set it up, I talked to the city\ncouncil, and they weren\u2019t very interested. I went and talked to the school board, ah,\nyou\u2019re wasting your time, they said, your kids don\u2019t want to do anything like that,\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection =nFebruary 21, 2014\nthey want to play in the streets and all. But I\u2014 I persisted and I got the school\nstarted in 1992, and I started off with a\u2014 a group of 15 little kids that were 12 - 14\nyears old, and had a group of neighborhood supporters that would support them.\nAnd they all came in and we split them up into groups of five kids, with at least one\nadult with each group, so that they had some good supervision. I started them\nbuilding little wooden boats. And I \u2014 we found that boy, when \u2014 when a lot of \u2014\nmost of those kids \u2014 most of them when they came, they were \u2014 boats didn\u2019t mean\nanything at all to them. And doing anything with their hands didn\u2019t mean to them.\nThey didn\u2019t di \u2014 they\u2019d never done anything. But when they came in to us, about a\nweek of working on a little boat that was going to be theirs when they finished, as\nlong as they could actually do something, man, the effect was amazing. So that\u2019s\ngone on since \u201992 and it just kept on growing, it\u2019s national now. A-As our system\nthat we developed has been spread all over the country, and now a hundred, 185\norganizations in the country that use our system, teaching kids to build little wooden\nboats. The little wooden boat is \u2014 is the key to it. They come in, and they get started\nwith hammer and \u2014 and chisels and saws, things they had never touched before, and\nthey learn to use those things, and they start building a little boat that they can see, I\ncan do something that\u2019s going to last and will be good for me \u2014",

So I used to go to Waterford and go \u2014 go there\nfor the fair every year, and got to working with some of the craftsman up there on\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 3February 21, 2014\ndifferent things. So I\u2014 we got \u2014 both of us got so interested in it that we watched for\na \u2014 a lot that we could buy, we were looking for a house, really. But we \u2014 none of\nthe houses came up for sale that we could \u2014 could ha \u2014 could handle. So a lot came\nup for sale, so we bought the lot, 1968, and then we started drawing back \u2014 I started\nmaking designs for houses. And, of course, in Waterford they had all \u2014 had all\nkinds of restrictions on what you could build because they wanted to keep the tenor\nof the village. So I designed what I thought was a real [indecipherable] house, and\nI took it to the [indecipherable] took it to the \u2014 the architect who was the\n[indecipherable] on what you could build. Showed it to him, he said, oh, that\u2019s a\nnice little house Bill, but that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that would look beautiful in Lancaster\nCounty, Pennsylvania, but that\u2019s not for Waterford. So I went back, and I\ndesigned a brick house. Oh, he said, man, Williamsburg. Beautiful Williamsburg\nhouse. Not for Waterford. So about that time, my wife was reading\n[indecipherable] the \u201cWashington Post,\u201d and at the bottom end of the classified\nads was, log house for sale. They were tearing down a log house because they built\n\u2014 had new houses all around it, they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t do anything except tear \u2014 tear\ndown and move it. So we went over \u2014 she said, let\u2019s go over and take a look at it.\nWell, that was the first week in May, 1970. And I said, oh, I\u2019m too busy, I can\u2019t\ntake \u2014 make it. So next week she tried again. The house was still for sale. Third\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection \u00ab4February 21, 2014\nweek, still for sale, tried again. The fourth week, Sunday \u2014 Sunday afternoon, it was\nraining cats and dogs, the kids were grumpy as all get out. Said okay, let\u2019s take the\nkids over, we\u2019ll go look at it. So we went over and there\u2019s this log house. By that\ntime they\u2019d taken the roof off, and it was raining for all week, and water dripping on\neverything. We opened the back door, and the inside of the house had been lone \u2014\nhad been lined with [indecipherable] board, you know, this fabulous tan, soft fiber,\ninsulating board? And when we opened the back door there was enough\n[indecipherable] that the whole ceiling collapsed, and two tons of water and all\nfrazzly wood came down. But it opened up everything so I could see all the logs.\nAnd it was in good shape. Only two logs needed some \u2014 some moderate repairs. So\nright there we bought the log house, and we [indecipherable] hire a guy to haul the\nlogs over to our lot to Waterford so we could rebuild it. And he started loading up\nthe logs, he says, hey, you know, my father\u2019s got a log house three miles over there,\nthat he hasn\u2019t used for 10 years, he\u2019d probably sell that to you, if you wanted it. So\n[indecipherable] that was very reasonable, so I bought that and they moved both of\nthem over, and we combined the two of them to make one house in Waterford.\nAnd we finished it [indecipherable] lived in it to the point where we lived in it\nabout 1975. And we had \u2014 still had floors missing, and no doors or windows\ninstalled, things like that, but we moved 1n in time for the kids to go to school in the\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection \u00abFebruary 21, 2014\nfall, and then I built it up from the inside.

I was\nvery interested in \u2014 in the colonial crafts. I trava \u2014 I\u2019m a gunsmith and make\nfurniture, and all that kind of stuff. So I used to go to Waterford and go \u2014 go there\nfor the fair every year, and got to working with some of the craftsman up there on\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 3February 21, 2014\ndifferent things. So I\u2014 we got \u2014 both of us got so interested in it that we watched for\na \u2014 a lot that we could buy, we were looking for a house, really. But we \u2014 none of\nthe houses came up for sale that we could \u2014 could ha \u2014 could handle. So a lot came\nup for sale, so we bought the lot, 1968, and then we started drawing back \u2014 I started\nmaking designs for houses. And, of course, in Waterford they had all \u2014 had all\nkinds of restrictions on what you could build because they wanted to keep the tenor\nof the village. So I designed what I thought was a real [indecipherable] house, and\nI took it to the [indecipherable] took it to the \u2014 the architect who was the\n[indecipherable] on what you could build. Showed it to him, he said, oh, that\u2019s a\nnice little house Bill, but that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that would look beautiful in Lancaster\nCounty, Pennsylvania, but that\u2019s not for Waterford. So I went back, and I\ndesigned a brick house. Oh, he said, man, Williamsburg. Beautiful Williamsburg\nhouse. Not for Waterford. So about that time, my wife was reading\n[indecipherable] the \u201cWashington Post,\u201d and at the bottom end of the classified\nads was, log house for sale. They were tearing down a log house because they built\n\u2014 had new houses all around it, they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t do anything except tear \u2014 tear\ndown and move it. So we went over \u2014 she said, let\u2019s go over and take a look at it.\nWell, that was the first week in May, 1970. And I said, oh, I\u2019m too busy, I can\u2019t\ntake \u2014 make it. So next week she tried again. The house was still for sale. Third\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection \u00ab4February 21, 2014\nweek, still for sale, tried again. The fourth week, Sunday \u2014 Sunday afternoon, it was\nraining cats and dogs, the kids were grumpy as all get out. Said okay, let\u2019s take the\nkids over, we\u2019ll go look at it. So we went over and there\u2019s this log house. By that\ntime they\u2019d taken the roof off, and it was raining for all week, and water dripping on\neverything. We opened the back door, and the inside of the house had been lone \u2014\nhad been lined with [indecipherable] board, you know, this fabulous tan, soft fiber,\ninsulating board? And when we opened the back door there was enough\n[indecipherable] that the whole ceiling collapsed, and two tons of water and all\nfrazzly wood came down. But it opened up everything so I could see all the logs.\nAnd it was in good shape. Only two logs needed some \u2014 some moderate repairs. So\nright there we bought the log house, and we [indecipherable] hire a guy to haul the\nlogs over to our lot to Waterford so we could rebuild it. And he started loading up\nthe logs, he says, hey, you know, my father\u2019s got a log house three miles over there,\nthat he hasn\u2019t used for 10 years, he\u2019d probably sell that to you, if you wanted it. So\n[indecipherable] that was very reasonable, so I bought that and they moved both of\nthem over, and we combined the two of them to make one house in Waterford.\nAnd we finished it [indecipherable] lived in it to the point where we lived in it\nabout 1975. And we had \u2014 still had floors missing, and no doors or windows\ninstalled, things like that, but we moved 1n in time for the kids to go to school in the\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection \u00abFebruary 21, 2014\nfall, and then I built it up from the inside.
