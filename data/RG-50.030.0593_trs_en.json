        "Question: This is an interview with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Today\nis the 15\" of October, 2010. I\u2019m here with Erica Kanter, and I am Ann Erling.\nSo, let\u2019s start. Let\u2019s start from the very beginning. Could we get your full name,\nthe name, if it was different at birth, and your birthdate and where you born,\nplease?",
        "Answer: Yes. The name is Erica Kanter. The maiden name was Hecht, h-e-c-h-t.\nI was born in Stuttgart, Germany in April 19\", 1929.",
        "Q: Okay, and then just tell me about your childhood; your home and your family,\nand what \u2014 what life was like?",
        "A: I lived in Stuttgart. My father was a physician. My father was Jewish, my\nmother was Catholic, but neither of them really practiced their religion. My father\nwas a very successful physician, so we had a very nice, privileged life. We lived in\nStuttgart, which was a very modern city at the time. They had buildings by\nGropius, and I had a very privileged childhood. We had live-in helpers who were\nlike family and so my childhood was a very happy childhood.",
        "Q: Do you have any siblings?",
        "A: Yes, I have a sister who\u2019s five years older than I, here name is \u2014 was\nLisalotte(ph), and now is Lisa. And my brother, who\u2019s three years older than I,\nOctober 15, 2010\nhis name is Karl Theodore, and is now Ted. My sister lives in Los Angeles, my\nbrother lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan.",
        "Q: Okay, did you \u2014 you attended school in Stuttgart?",
        "A: Yes, I went to elementary school, and \u2014 for four years, and my teacher, whom I\nadored, was Fraulein Gruninger(ph). And I went to the Wagenborg(ph) schule\nand had a very happy early education.",
        "Q: Were there both Jewish and non-Jewish children at this school?",
        "A: Yes, there were all kinds of children, Jewish, Catholic, Protestant. And I have a\nfriendship book in which some of them signed and had their pictures, and they\u2019re\nof all religions.",
        "Q: Okay, so a lot of your friends were both Jewish and non-Jewish?",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay. What are some of your earliest childhood memories?",
        "A: Well, I have a lot of them, and many of them are in a memoir which I wrote,\nand was published last year. We were very close to my parents and we did the\nusual amusements and entertainments for Germans of the time. We went walking\na lot, and we went to the puppet theater, and we visited my grandparents, who\nlived in Ulm. And in the summer, we went to Czechoslovakia, where my\nmaternal grandparents had an estate, which was a castle. And so for the first seven\nOctober 15, 2010\nor eight years of my life, I went to Czechoslovakia every summer to spend time at\nthe castle. So \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s so cool.",
        "A: \u2014 Thad a very privileged childhood. Nothing but happy childhood.",
        "Q: That\u2019s so good. So you said that your family didn\u2019t really practice religion. Did\nyou do any \u2014 prac \u2014 do any \u2014 I guess, recognize any Jewish holidays or Christian\nholidays?",
        "A: Not really. I-I think even my grandparents, my paternal grandparents, who\nwere Jewish, I don\u2019t think they practiced their religion either, which was not\nunusual for a lot of German Jews. But I did go to Sunday school. I went to\nGerman Lutheran Sunday school, and I think I just, you know, went once a week\nand it was just part of my growing up, I guess. And then when I came to the\nUnited States in 1940, I became a member of the congregational church, which\napparently is not too dissimilar from the German Lutheran church.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Remind me again what year you were born?",
        "A: I was born in 1929.",
        "Q: Okay. So, did you experience any anti-Semitism when you were growing up?",
        "A: Not really. It seems that Stuttgart was rather late in having anti-Semitism\nvisible. I did know that \u2014 I think in 1938 perhaps, I was no longer allowed to go to\nOctober 15, 2010\nthe swimming pool. But I stayed in school, I think until early in 1939. However, in\n1938, my father lost his medical license, and on Kristallnacht he was arrested and\nhe was sent to Dachau. Now, in those days, apparently, you could still get out\nafter a fo \u2014 short period. And he was there for a month, and the requirements for\nleaving at that time, as far as I know, were that you had already applied for a visa\nto leave Germany, and that you had served in the German army in World War I.\nAnd my father was in the German army as a medic in World War I, but he was\nsent to Dachau. And then, we\u2019re not a hundred percent sure if the story is true, but\nI was told that the police chief in Stuttgart had a six year old son, and my father\nwas the family doctor, and they say that my father saved the child\u2019s life. And that\nwhen this police chief heard that my father was in Dachau, and had already\napplied for a visa and had served in the army in World War I, he also helped him.\nSo my father got out of Dachau after a month, after he had to have surgery which\nwas caused by his stay in Dachau, where they ruined his sinuses. He left through\nSwitzerland and then went to England. And he came to England in September of\n1939. My brother, my sister and I were sent to England in, I think April of 1939,\non the Kindertransport.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s back up a little fur \u2014 a little bit before we talk about the\nKindertransport. Do you remember \u2014 you said you remember not being able to\nOctober 15, 2010\ngo to the swimming pool any more. Do you remember anything else happening at\n\u2014 you know, your father losing his practice, but I mean, did children treat you\ndifferently at school?",
        "A: No, no. No one treated me differently while I was still in school. My teacher\ndidn\u2019t, my friends didn\u2019t. So it really didn\u2019t affect me too much. And I was\nprobably doing something very silly, I\u2014 my mother did let me have English\nlessons for a short while. And I remember going on the street and practicing my\nlittle English sayings, which of course was not very smart, because if anyone had\nheard me, there might have been a problem, but fortunately no one ever heard me\nor paid attention.",
        "Q: So you attended school up until you left?",
        "A: Yes. I think I probably was taken out of school few weeks or months, I really\ndon\u2019t remember how long. But I know that my mother had lots of clothes made for\nme to take to England, and I did have these English lessons, but I don\u2019t remember\nhow long I was out of school.",
        "Q: Did your family at home, did your parents talk about the Nazi rise to power?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t a concern?\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: No, the only thing I remember is that the night my father was arrested, my\nmother woke me up and I remember having to say goodbye to my father, but that\u2019s",
        "Q: How long \u2014 sorry to interrupt \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s all \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 how long was he in Dachau?",
        "A: About a month, I think.",
        "Q: Okay, so when did your parents talk to you about the Kindertransport? When\ndid you know that decision had been made\u2019?",
        "A: I don\u2019t really remember. I don\u2019t remember whether my mother ever explained\nit to me. It was through my mother that we were able to get out, because she did\nall this while my father was in Dachau.",
        "Q: So this was in April or May of 39?",
        "A: I think we left in April 1939.",
        "Q: Okay. And then what \u2014 what went into the preparation? Like you said your\nmother had clothes \u2014",
        "A: My mother had lots of clothes made, and I had a ba \u2014 brand new quilt for my\nbed, and she packed all my things, and I had some of my favorite books. One was\nabout three Teddy bears, another one was about Kaspalay(ph), which is a puppet.\nOctober 15, 2010\nAnd [| also had family photo albums that she gave me. And \u2014 but I really don\u2019t\nremember being scared or traumatized. I-I just didn\u2019t really know what was going\non, I was nine years old.",
        "Q: What about \u2014 and your brother and your sister were \u2014 went as well?",
        "A: Yes, we all three left together. Now, I\u2019m sure that my sister, who was 14, and\nmy brother, who was 12, have more memories of it than I did. My brother, for\nexample, remembers my mother saying goodbye to us at the railroad station. And\nI\u2019ve read recently that Nazis did not want parents on the station \u2014 on the platform,\nbut apparently my mother did go, and my brother remembers that. I don\u2019t\nremember that at all.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t recall the days leading up \u2014 whether or not \u2014 how you\nwere feeling \u2014",
        "A: No, not really.",
        "Q: Okay. Do you recall the \u2014 the journey to England at all?",
        "A: A little bit. I played the violin at that time, and I know they made me play the\nviolin on the train, because many Jewish families bought expensive musical\ninstruments to give to their children to take out, so that they could be sold for\nmoney later. And so the Nazis wanted to make sure that I could play the violin,\nOctober 15, 2010\nand I did, and I remember I played \u201cAch du lieber Augustine,\u201d which was a\nfamous song at the time for children. But that\u2019s all I really remember.",
        "Q: Okay, did you know if you went by train to \u2014 to Holland?",
        "A: I think so, and then by whatever to England, and we went to London where\nthe three English families that were taking us, met us. And my sister went to\nBuxton, my brother went to Harrow, and I went to Marple, which is outside\nManchester.",
        "Q: Okay. So what was the family like who you lived with?",
        "A: My foster father was professor of engineering at the University of Manchester,\nand his wife Edith. And they had twin daughters who were about six months older\nthan I, Joyce and Kathleen. And the day that I arrived, and we went to Marple,\nmy English family had a high tea in my honor. And I was very surprised, because I\nthought my foster mother spoke fluent German, I thought this is very easy to\nunderstand. And then when it was bedtime, the woman I thought was my foster\nmother disappeared. Turns out that my foster parents had invited the German\nteacher from the high school to come for the day and make my transition less\ntraumatic. But from then on, I was on my own. But they were wonderful. And I\nam still in touch with them, and in 2008 I went to England for the twins 80\"\nbirthday. And we correspond, we send each other letters with pictures of our\nOctober 15, 2010\ngrandchildren, and we\u2019re still very close. The only one in the family who is that\nway with the English family is I. My brother and sister did not keep in touch with\ntheirs until a few years later.",
        "Q: Okay. Wa \u2014 were there a lot of English customs that you had to adjust to, that\nwas different from home?",
        "A: Well, the one that I remember \u2014 and at \u2014 at this time, you could still write to\nGermany from England. My English foster mother always gave me tea, like\neveryone else in the family, but I refused to have milk in it, and she thought that\nthat might not be good for me, so she wrote to my mother and asked whether it\nwas all right for me to have tea without milk in it. And my mother said, oh yes,\nshe has tea at home all the time. Well, what my mother didn\u2019t realize is that\nEnglish tea is very strong and very dark, whereas in Germany tea is fairly weak.\nAnd so my mother said no, it\u2019s fine. So I learned to drink English tea, but was not\nvery fond of it. And I wasn\u2019t too fond of mutton either, although I did like\nShepherd\u2019s pie, which is ground mutton with mashed potatoes and gravy.",
        "Q: I like that as well.",
        "A: And high tea, I liked high tea. And I had never had Jell-O, and very often my\nEnglish foster mother made a dessert with different colors of Jell-O that was all\nchopped up and very pretty. And she also made lemon curd, which I\u2019d never had\nOctober 15, 2010\nbefore. And she always told me when I met them later in 1980, that I would come\nto the kitchen and I would try to help, and I would say, I will make \u2014 meaning that\nI would help her. And I remember squeezing lots of lemons for lemon curd.",
        "Q: So did \u2014 you said that you had taken some English lessons, but did it take you a\nwhile to learn the la \u2014 the \u2014 your new language?",
        "A: I guess so, although I really don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Did you attend school when you were in England?",
        "A: Yes, I went to school a week after I got there. I went to Manchester High\nSchool for girls, which was an elementary school in Manchester, so we\ncommuted from Marple to Manchester, and the twins went with me. I think they\nwere probably a year ahead of me in school. And I remember loving my school.\nAnd then when the war started in September, after a while, when bombing started\nin Manchester, like many other British children, we were evacuated to the\ncountryside. So I had another English family, a Mrs. Emerson and her daughter,\nwho was in her 20s. She was the \u2014 the \u2014 Mrs. Emerson was a widow. And I went\nto the Cheadle Hulme school, which was an affiliate of the school in\nManchester.",
        "Q: Did the two twins go with you when you went \u2014\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: No, the twins went to boarding school. And the school I went to was a boarding\nschool, but I went as a day student.",
        "Q: Where were your brother and sister at this time?",
        "A: My brother was in Harrow with his English family, and my sister was in\nBuxton with hers. My brother\u2019s family had a daughter who was a little bit older\nthan my brother, and my sister\u2019s family I think had four children. And I saw them\nonce while I was in England, we all got together in Harrow.",
        "Q: Did you return to Marple after being evacuated to the countryside, or did you \u2014",
        "A: I went there I think on weekends, or whatever. I just didn\u2019t go to school in\nManchester any more.",
        "Q: Did you experience any air raids, did you \u2014",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: So what \u2014 do you recall ha \u2014 what your knowledge was of the war during this\ntime? Did you read about it, or hear about what was going on?",
        "A: Not really. I knew that there was a war. The one thing I do remember 1s that\nPrincess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose, spoke on the radio every week\nto the children of Great Britain to keep our courage up. And that\u2019s about all I\nremember.",
        "Q: How long were you there?\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: I was there for about a year.",
        "Q: Okay. So, do \u2014 and you \u2014 you wrote to your mother. How long did you \u2014 were\nyou able to keep in contact with your family?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t remember, but I know in the beginning. Now, my mother stayed\nin Germany because she didn\u2019t have a German visa, she was born in \u2014 in Prague,\nso she had a Czech visa. And there \u2014 it wasn\u2019t quite as rapid. And she eventually,\nshe tried to pack up our \u2014 all our house, and our paintings, our \u2014 all our belongings\nto send to the United States, and of course nothing was ever delivered. My\nparents lost everything. But she left to go to Italy where my maternal grandparents\nhad a house, which she inherited. So she went to Italy on the pretense of going to\nsell that house, and she never left Italy. And she then went through Portugal in\nSeptember of 1940 and came directly to the United States. So I hadn\u2019t seen her\nfor a year and a half.",
        "Q: Where was your father? I know he said \u2014 you \u2014 he got a visa. Did he \u2014 where\ndid he leave to?",
        "A: He left, and came through Switzerland to Harrow. He lived in a boarding\nhouse in Harrow, so he and my brother did see each other while they were there.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did \u2014 you didn\u2019t see your father though, at all?\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: I saw him once, the one time that I went to Harrow. And then in April or May\nof 1940, my brother, my sister, I and my father all came over by boat on the\nBritannic to the United States. And my father had a research fellowship in\nYpsilanti, Michigan, because he couldn\u2019t practice medicine yet. And then a year\nlater he passed the medical exam and then he moved to Massachusetts with us.\nAnd the reason we went to Massachusetts is there were very few states where you\ncould practice medicine without being a citizen, and Massachusetts was one of\nthem. So we moved to Braintree, Massachusetts, which is just outside Boston,\nand he started his practice again, and after a beginning struggle, he became very\nsuccessful and eventually taught at Tufts Medical School, and put all three of us\nthrough college.",
        "Q: That\u2019s fabulous.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So what year was it that you immigrated to the U.S.?",
        "A: \u00b039.",
        "Q: \u00b039, okay.",
        "A: No, 1940 we emigrated. We left Germany in \u201939, left England in 1940.",
        "Q: That\u2019s wonderful. Okay, so what about \u2014 did you still have grandparents who\nwere \u2014\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Yes, my maternal grandparents had died early in the 30s, but my paternal\ngrandparents, my grandfather was also a physician, they lived in Ulm. And it\nwasn\u2019t until 1942 that they were sent out of Ulm. They were told they were going\nto a Jewish retirement settlement, they couldn\u2019t pack very much. And they were\nsent to Theresienstadt, and they died in Theresienstadt within a week of each\nother in January of 1943. Now, my parents didn\u2019t know that until after the war.\nMy parents tried to get them out of Germany and couldn\u2019t. And so it wasn\u2019t until\nafter war that my father found out that my grandparents had died.",
        "Q: So, your \u2014 your brothers and sis \u2014 your brother and sister, did they have a\npositive experience when they were in England?",
        "A: Yes, they did. My brother in Harrow, his family was as wonderful, and in fact,\nhis foster mother eventually came to the United States, because his \u2014 their\ndaughter eventually married an American serviceman, and then brought her\nmother over to the United States. My sister\u2019s family also was very nice to her,\nexcept in the beginning. My sister at that time was 14, and they sort of treated her\nas a au pair, a household helper. And it \u2014 that didn\u2019t stop until a cousin of my\nfather\u2019s from India came to visit and explained to them that, you know, she had\nbeen brought up in a very privileged household, and that she shouldn\u2019t be treated\nlike a servant. And everything was fine from then on, and you know, she was quite\nOctober 15, 2010\nhappy, I\u2019m sure. Although, she was 14, and that\u2019s not a \u2014 an easy age to, you\nknow, uproot. But one of the children of that family did visit us in Massachusetts\nwhen I was in college. I remember he came \u2014 Aubrey came to visit. But my sister\nhasn\u2019t kept in touch with them, and my brother really didn\u2019t keep in touch with his\neither.",
        "Q: So before we move on, I want to talk about your life in the U.S. You had a\nphotograph of a fr \u2014 a friend of yours, Ursula. Was that someone you knew in\nEngland?",
        "A: Yes, my best friend from Germany",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: \u2014 was named Ursula Meyer. And I did visit her in England once. I don\u2019t know\nwhere, all I know is it was near the ocean somewhere because there is a\nphotograph of the two of us on the beach in bathing suits. And I don\u2019t know what\never happened to her, we lost touch when I came to the United States. And I was\njust curious to see whether she was still alive, and whether she had stayed in\nEngland, or whether she got married, or what, I had no idea. And I first got in\ntouch with the Kindertransport Association, to find out whether they could find\nher on a list anywhere. And they did find an Ursula Meyer, but it was am-\u2014a\nmarried name, not her m \u2014 her maiden name.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: Oh, okay. So how old were you when \u2014 when you immigrated to the U.S.?",
        "A: I was nine.",
        "Q: Nine, okay, so did you s-start attending American school right away?",
        "A: Oh, when I was s \u2014 came to the United States, I was 10. Yes, I\u2014I first went to\nschool in New York City for a few weeks, until my father got the research\nfellowship in Michigan. And then I went to elementary school in Michigan for a\nyear. And then I\u2014 we moved to Braintree, and I skipped a grade, because they\nsaid I\u2019d had so much education in Germany and England that I was ready for the\neighth grade, I should really have been in seventh. And then I stayed, I went all\nthrough high school in Braintree.",
        "Q: So, was it difficult adjusting to, I mean, a new lifestyle, after being in eng \u2014\nGermany and then England \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 then America.",
        "A: Not for me, I \u2014 I\u2014 you know, I remember my childhood as being a very happy\nchildhood and I guess I was always happy from the time I was young, and I don\u2019t\nremember really, any traumatic incidences at all, except for one in England,\nwhich I considered traumatic. My mother, when she was still able to send me\npackages from Germany had sent me a box of cherries from our Bing cherry tree\nOctober 15, 2010\nin Stuttgart. And one night we were to take a bath, and it was my turn to take a\nbath first. And the bathroom was quite chilly, but there was a nice little cabinet or\ncloset where the hot water heater was, and it was quite warm in there, and you\nusually dried yourself in there. And I was in there drying myself when I heard one\nof the twins come up for her bath. And I thought that it was Kathleen, who was\nthe very outgoing twin, and I thought, now wouldn\u2019t it be fun to close the cabinet\ndoor and then open it and suddenly say boo. Well, I had made a mistake and it was\nnot Kathleen, it was Joyce, who was a little more nervous. And of course, she\ncried and shrieked and Uncle Cornish(ph), my foster father, sent me to my room\nfor what I considered just fun, but apparently he was concerned because one of the\ntwins was crying. So I remember sitting on my bed on my beautiful new quilt,\nopening my box of cherries, and I ate every cherry one by one and I kept\nmuttering to myself, and you won\u2019t have any, I will eat them all by myself. And\nthen in 1980, when I went back to England for my foster mother\u2019s 80\" birthday, I\ntold him the story and he couldn\u2019t remember it at all. But that\u2019s about the only\ntraumatic experience I had. And the only other one was in New York, when I was\nin school for a few weeks. I remember standing up at my desk to answer a\nquestion, and the little boy behind me was measuring the length of my dress with a\nruler. And apparently my German dresses had gotten a little short as I got a year\nOctober 15, 2010\nolder, and I remember him measuring the length of my skirt. But that\u2019s about the\nonly traumatic experiences.",
        "Q: Did you exchange a lot of letters and packaged with your mother when you\nwere in England and she was in Germany?",
        "A: No, I really don\u2019t remember. I mean, she packed everything in my trunk, you\nknow, that she thought I might want to have, like my Teddy bear and my books,\nand I don\u2019t remember too many other letters from her.",
        "Q: Were your parents able to get anything out of Germany when \u2014 when they\nleft?",
        "A: No, no, nothing, nothing.",
        "Q: Do you remember hearing about the war ending when you were in the U.S.?",
        "A: Oh yes, and I \u2014I distinctly remember Roosevelt\u2019s death, because that came\nover the radio and I remember how shocked my parents were when they heard\nthat. I was actually on \u2014 on Cape Cod when World War II ended, and I heard over\nthe radio, and we all celebrated.",
        "Q: That\u2019s wonderful. So, let\u2019s see, what else we have to talk about. Have \u2014 have\nyou ever done an interview like this before?",
        "A: No.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: Have you ever \u2014 do you talk to your \u2014 have you talked to your children \u2014 how\nmany children do you have?",
        "A: I have two daughters, and I have five grandchildren.",
        "Q: Okay, whe-when did you get married?",
        "A: I got married what at that time was considered late in life. I was 27 and my\nhusband was 31 and in those days, in 1956 that was considered over the hill. Most\nof my college friends were already mothers. But I got married in 1956 and I got\nmarried at the Harvard chapel, which solved all of the religious problems \u2014 my\nhusband was Jewish. And anyone who went to Harvard, which I did, and he went\nto the Harvard Business School, was able to get married at the Harvard chapel,\nso that\u2019s where we got married and it solved all the problems of who was going to\nmarry us, and how, and what, and everybody was happy.",
        "Q: That\u2019s good. Okay, so I guess we \u2014 we should back up. So you went \u2014 you\nwent to Harvard.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did you study?",
        "A: I majored in English and American literature.",
        "Q: Cool, and your \u2014 and did you meet your husband at Harvard?\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: No, no. He actually went to the business school after I graduated. He worked\nfor a few years before he went to graduate school. So I graduated in 1950, and this\nyear was my 60\" reunion.",
        "Q: Oh really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you attend it?",
        "A: Yes, it was wonderful.",
        "Q: That\u2019s wonderful.",
        "A: It was a great reunion.",
        "Q: So, and you have two daughters and five grandchildren, and d \u2014 have you ever\ntalked to them about your experiences?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve talked to my d \u2014 my daughters, you know, about it, and a little bit to\nmy grandchildren. But that\u2019s really why I wrote my memoir, so that they would\nknow. And you know, what they know about the Holocaust they read in \u2014 in their\nhistory textbooks, and they know what happened politically, but I don\u2019t think they\never fully realized how it affects individuals. And I thought they should know how\nit affected my family, and what happened to me when I was nine years old. And\nthat\u2019s really why I wrote the memoir. And my husband kept insisting that I should\nwrite that and \u2014 for the grandchildren, primarily.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: I think it\u2019s important.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s good that you did that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s also good that you\u2019re sharing your story with us today, so thank you.",
        "A: Well, thank you, thank you.",
        "Q: Do you think that your experiences with the Kindertransport affected maybe\nespecially the way that you raised your children?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I mean, they\u2019ve always known what it was like fo \u2014 you know,\nwhen I was a child from what I told them, but I don\u2019t think it really affected them.\nAs I said, my husband was Jewish, but he also did not practice his religion really,\nafter he was in his 20s. And so we did a little bit of everything, you know. We\npracticed some Jewish holidays because his side of the family did practice them.\nBut we also practiced Christmas, which is what my side of the family did, and so I\nthink I\u2019ve tried to make them non-prejudiced, and \u2014 and, you know, have respect\nfor all religions and all races. But other than that, I don\u2019t think it really influenced\nmy raising my children in any way.",
        "Q: Did you ever speak to your parents about maybe what they were going through\nwhen they \u2014\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Not really. My father, for example, never talked about Dachau and we never\nasked him. And it wasn\u2019t until he wrote a very small autobiography in 1972 that I\nlearned a little bit about his experiences in Dachau. And I know he told me in that\nautobiography that two other people from Stuttgart that were sent to Dachau with\nhim, died. One, because he was a diabetic and was not given insulin, and the other\nfrom some kind of intestinal infection. And as I said, my father suffered from\nsome kind of sinus problems which had to have surgery once he got out of the\nhospital \u2014 I mean, out of Dachau and he went to the hospital in Stuttgart, before\nhe went to Switzerland.",
        "Q: Does your mother ever talk about when she was in Germany alone, about what\nshe was experiencing?",
        "A: Not really. We really didn\u2019t talk very much about it. And it was just there, you\nknow, we knew that that\u2019s what we had gone through. And the only thing \u2014 you\nasked whether my parents were able to save anything. The only thing that they\nwere able to save \u2014 and this is a\u2014 a rather unique story, a good friend of theirs was\nEmma Goering, who was a distant cousin of Goering\u2019s, who was, of course, one\nof the biggest Nazis. She was very anti-Nazi, and very outspoken, but they never\narrested her or bothered here, I guess because she was related to him. But she was\na good friend of my parents. And when my mother was getting everything ready,\nOctober 15, 2010\npacked to go to the United States, you were not supposed to take any jewelry or\nsilver, you had to declare that and give it to the government. Well, my mother\ndidn't want to do that. And Emma Goering suggested that she \u2014 my mother give it\nto her and she would bury it in her garden, in a box, which she did. And during the\nwar, my brother was in the army for four years, and toward the end he was on a\nleave, and he went to visit Emma Goering, to see if she was still al-alive. And\nEmma Goering said to him, I have something that belongs to your mother. And\nthey went into her garden, dug up the box, and because he was already a US.\ncitizen and a serviceman, he was allowed to send it to the United States. So my\nmother got back all of the jewelry that she had inherited from her grandmother and\ngreat-grandmother, her German silverware. And then several years later Emma\nGoering visited my husband and me in New York City, and she was a charming,\ncharming lady. And so that\u2019s the only thing my parents did save, and it was\nbecause of her.",
        "Q: That\u2019s an incredible story.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, your brother was in the army during World War II?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay, so when you \u2014\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: He was in Patton\u2019s army for four years.",
        "Q: Oh, so when you immigrated, he must have joined the army right away, or \u2014",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 no, he \u2014 he was \u2014 when we immigrated, he was 13 \u2014 14 \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He went to high school in Michigan. And then he had started the University of\nMichigan when he was drafted, and then he went in the army, and he was in the\narmy for four years.",
        "Q: Wow. That\u2019s incredible. That\u2019s great that sh-he \u2014 she was able to save \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, is there anything else that you \u2014 you would like to add? Any other \u2014",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s just that I \u2014 I guess I was a \u2014 a very, very lucky child, because my\nEnglish foster family was just \u2014 just wonderful. And as I said, I saw them again in\n1980 for my foster mother\u2019s 80\" birthday. And then I went back to England in\n2008 for the twins\u2019 80\" birthday party. And they were just so compassionate and\nloving, and so was Mrs. Emerson. And it taught me a good lesson, that\ncompassion and friendliness and love and just being good people is important, and\nI\u2019ve tried to teach that to my children.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "Q: So you\u2019ve returned to England twice?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Have you ever been back to Germany\u201d",
        "A: Yes, I went back to Germany first in 1951 with my sister, we went to Europe\nfor three months. And we visited our house in Stuttgart, and then I went back\nagain in 1982, to visit my German cousins on my mother\u2019s side of the family,\nwhom I hadn\u2019t seen until the mid-30s. And we\u2019ve become very close friends and\nSO we\u2019ve gone back to Europe two or three times for birthdays and travel, and \u2014\nwith them. And so I\u2019ve been back, yes. And when I went back in 1982, we went to\nStuttgart, and the people who owned my parents\u2019 house took my husband and me\nthrough it, to show us what it was like.",
        "Q: Was it different?",
        "A: And then \u2014 not really. Apparently it was damaged a little bit during the war, but\nnot badly. And the interesting thing is, as we were leaving, a woman next door\nleaned over the fence and said, Erica, what are you doing here? In German. And it\nturns out that she was my sister\u2019s friend. She was my sister\u2019s age, and for some\nreason she recognized me after all those years. And so I explained to her what\nhappened to us. And so we did see the house in 1982.",
        "Q: Did you speak German at home with your family after the war?\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Not really, no. I think once we came to the United States and my father\ndecided we were now going to be Americans, and you know, we really didn\u2019t\nspeak much German. But I can still speak it, and I speak it with a strong\n[indecipherable] accent, and I can understand most German. I can\u2019t understand\nlegal German or technical German, but I can read German.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, that\u2019s wonderful. So, if \u2014 if there\u2019s anything else that you would like\nto add?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m just, you know, as I said, I was very lucky, I had a wonderful English\nfamily. I know not everyone was as lucky as I was. And we\u2019ve stayed very close\nfriends, and I\u2019ve just recognized how \u2014 what a big sacrifice it was for these people,\nbecause they didn\u2019t know whether they were going to have us for a month or a\nyear or forever. I know there are some Kindertransport children who\u2019ve been\nthere, you know, were there for seven, eight, nine years. And I was only there for a\nyear. But both families were just wonderful to us, really.",
        "Q: That\u2019s good.",
        "A: And they \u2014 be \u2014 ma \u2014 my English foster family remained friends with my\nparents and came to visit them in the United States. And then my parents visited\nthem in England, too.",
        "Q: That\u2019s wonderful.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: So, it was a nice relationship.",
        "Q: Before we wrap things up, I\u2019m curious, are the photos that you brought, are\nthey pictures from \u2014 from your childhood?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Maybe let\u2019s look at them real quick and we\u2019ll kind of talk about them together.",
        "A: Yes, sure, yeah, come and sit.",
        "Q: Pll come sit next to you.",
        "A: Well, in the beginning, I have pictures of my father and my uncle and my aunt,\nand those have interesting stories. My uncle, who was an entomologist, left\nGermany in 1933, went first to Palestine for a few years, then to Venezuela, and\neventually ended up in Mexico City, where he became a professor at University of\nMexico, as an entomologist. My aunt, whose husband had factories that\nmanufactured felt for printing in both Germany and Italy, left in 1936 and moved\nto Italy, and a farmer hid him as a farm helper during the war. And my aunt and\nmy three cousins were saved by Italian nuns, who took them to a nunnery. So\nanyway, these are pictures of my father, and these are pictures of my mother in her\nchildhood.",
        "Q: Oh wow, that\u2019s a wonderful photo.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, and she, you know, really grew up sort of like a debutante. And then,\nthese are the pictures of my grandparents, Dr. Ludwig, and [indecipherable]\nHecht. And they are the ones who died in Theresienstadt in 1943. And the reason\nI know that they didn\u2019t go there until 1942, late in the year was that there\u2019s a letter\nfrom them to my cousin in Italy, saying that they were going to have to leave in\nAugust of 1942. And then it wasn\u2019t til after the war that we found out that they had\ndied, but here\u2019s a picture of them.",
        "Q: Did they s \u2014 did they stay in Ulm until this?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",

And this was our cook in Germany, who used to come with us 1n the\nsummer to help. And here\u2019s our nanny, or au pair. And these are relatives who\nwere visiting. And here we are outdoor bowling.

    "answers": [
        "Answer: Yes. The name is Erica Kanter. The maiden name was Hecht, h-e-c-h-t.\nI was born in Stuttgart, Germany in April 19\", 1929.",
        "A: I lived in Stuttgart. My father was a physician. My father was Jewish, my\nmother was Catholic, but neither of them really practiced their religion. My father\nwas a very successful physician, so we had a very nice, privileged life. We lived in\nStuttgart, which was a very modern city at the time. They had buildings by\nGropius, and I had a very privileged childhood. We had live-in helpers who were\nlike family and so my childhood was a very happy childhood.",
        "A: Yes, I have a sister who\u2019s five years older than I, here name is \u2014 was\nLisalotte(ph), and now is Lisa. And my brother, who\u2019s three years older than I,\nOctober 15, 2010\nhis name is Karl Theodore, and is now Ted. My sister lives in Los Angeles, my\nbrother lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan.",
        "A: Yes, I went to elementary school, and \u2014 for four years, and my teacher, whom I\nadored, was Fraulein Gruninger(ph). And I went to the Wagenborg(ph) schule\nand had a very happy early education.",
        "A: Yes, there were all kinds of children, Jewish, Catholic, Protestant. And I have a\nfriendship book in which some of them signed and had their pictures, and they\u2019re\nof all religions.",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, I have a lot of them, and many of them are in a memoir which I wrote,\nand was published last year. We were very close to my parents and we did the\nusual amusements and entertainments for Germans of the time. We went walking\na lot, and we went to the puppet theater, and we visited my grandparents, who\nlived in Ulm. And in the summer, we went to Czechoslovakia, where my\nmaternal grandparents had an estate, which was a castle. And so for the first seven\nOctober 15, 2010\nor eight years of my life, I went to Czechoslovakia every summer to spend time at\nthe castle. So \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Thad a very privileged childhood. Nothing but happy childhood.\nyou do any \u2014 prac \u2014 do any \u2014 I guess, recognize any Jewish holidays or Christian\nholidays?",
        "A: Not really. I-I think even my grandparents, my paternal grandparents, who\nwere Jewish, I don\u2019t think they practiced their religion either, which was not\nunusual for a lot of German Jews. But I did go to Sunday school. I went to\nGerman Lutheran Sunday school, and I think I just, you know, went once a week\nand it was just part of my growing up, I guess. And then when I came to the\nUnited States in 1940, I became a member of the congregational church, which\napparently is not too dissimilar from the German Lutheran church.",
        "A: I was born in 1929.",
        "A: Not really. It seems that Stuttgart was rather late in having anti-Semitism\nvisible. I did know that \u2014 I think in 1938 perhaps, I was no longer allowed to go to\nOctober 15, 2010\nthe swimming pool. But I stayed in school, I think until early in 1939. However, in\n1938, my father lost his medical license, and on Kristallnacht he was arrested and\nhe was sent to Dachau. Now, in those days, apparently, you could still get out\nafter a fo \u2014 short period. And he was there for a month, and the requirements for\nleaving at that time, as far as I know, were that you had already applied for a visa\nto leave Germany, and that you had served in the German army in World War I.\nAnd my father was in the German army as a medic in World War I, but he was\nsent to Dachau. And then, we\u2019re not a hundred percent sure if the story is true, but\nI was told that the police chief in Stuttgart had a six year old son, and my father\nwas the family doctor, and they say that my father saved the child\u2019s life. And that\nwhen this police chief heard that my father was in Dachau, and had already\napplied for a visa and had served in the army in World War I, he also helped him.\nSo my father got out of Dachau after a month, after he had to have surgery which\nwas caused by his stay in Dachau, where they ruined his sinuses. He left through\nSwitzerland and then went to England. And he came to England in September of\n1939. My brother, my sister and I were sent to England in, I think April of 1939,\non the Kindertransport.\nOctober 15, 2010\ngo to the swimming pool any more. Do you remember anything else happening at\n\u2014 you know, your father losing his practice, but I mean, did children treat you\ndifferently at school?",
        "A: No, no. No one treated me differently while I was still in school. My teacher\ndidn\u2019t, my friends didn\u2019t. So it really didn\u2019t affect me too much. And I was\nprobably doing something very silly, I\u2014 my mother did let me have English\nlessons for a short while. And I remember going on the street and practicing my\nlittle English sayings, which of course was not very smart, because if anyone had\nheard me, there might have been a problem, but fortunately no one ever heard me\nor paid attention.",
        "A: Yes. I think I probably was taken out of school few weeks or months, I really\ndon\u2019t remember how long. But I know that my mother had lots of clothes made for\nme to take to England, and I did have these English lessons, but I don\u2019t remember\nhow long I was out of school.",
        "A: No, no.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: No, the only thing I remember is that the night my father was arrested, my\nmother woke me up and I remember having to say goodbye to my father, but that\u2019s",
        "A: That\u2019s all \u2014",
        "A: About a month, I think.",
        "A: I don\u2019t really remember. I don\u2019t remember whether my mother ever explained\nit to me. It was through my mother that we were able to get out, because she did\nall this while my father was in Dachau.",
        "A: I think we left in April 1939.",
        "A: My mother had lots of clothes made, and I had a ba \u2014 brand new quilt for my\nbed, and she packed all my things, and I had some of my favorite books. One was\nabout three Teddy bears, another one was about Kaspalay(ph), which is a puppet.\nOctober 15, 2010\nAnd [| also had family photo albums that she gave me. And \u2014 but I really don\u2019t\nremember being scared or traumatized. I-I just didn\u2019t really know what was going\non, I was nine years old.",
        "A: Yes, we all three left together. Now, I\u2019m sure that my sister, who was 14, and\nmy brother, who was 12, have more memories of it than I did. My brother, for\nexample, remembers my mother saying goodbye to us at the railroad station. And\nI\u2019ve read recently that Nazis did not want parents on the station \u2014 on the platform,\nbut apparently my mother did go, and my brother remembers that. I don\u2019t\nremember that at all.",
        "A: No, not really.",
        "A: A little bit. I played the violin at that time, and I know they made me play the\nviolin on the train, because many Jewish families bought expensive musical\ninstruments to give to their children to take out, so that they could be sold for\nmoney later. And so the Nazis wanted to make sure that I could play the violin,\nOctober 15, 2010\nand I did, and I remember I played \u201cAch du lieber Augustine,\u201d which was a\nfamous song at the time for children. But that\u2019s all I really remember.",
        "A: I think so, and then by whatever to England, and we went to London where\nthe three English families that were taking us, met us. And my sister went to\nBuxton, my brother went to Harrow, and I went to Marple, which is outside\nManchester.",
        "A: My foster father was professor of engineering at the University of Manchester,\nand his wife Edith. And they had twin daughters who were about six months older\nthan I, Joyce and Kathleen. And the day that I arrived, and we went to Marple,\nmy English family had a high tea in my honor. And I was very surprised, because I\nthought my foster mother spoke fluent German, I thought this is very easy to\nunderstand. And then when it was bedtime, the woman I thought was my foster\nmother disappeared. Turns out that my foster parents had invited the German\nteacher from the high school to come for the day and make my transition less\ntraumatic. But from then on, I was on my own. But they were wonderful. And I\nam still in touch with them, and in 2008 I went to England for the twins 80\"\nbirthday. And we correspond, we send each other letters with pictures of our\nOctober 15, 2010\ngrandchildren, and we\u2019re still very close. The only one in the family who is that\nway with the English family is I. My brother and sister did not keep in touch with\ntheirs until a few years later.\nwas different from home?",
        "A: Well, the one that I remember \u2014 and at \u2014 at this time, you could still write to\nGermany from England. My English foster mother always gave me tea, like\neveryone else in the family, but I refused to have milk in it, and she thought that\nthat might not be good for me, so she wrote to my mother and asked whether it\nwas all right for me to have tea without milk in it. And my mother said, oh yes,\nshe has tea at home all the time. Well, what my mother didn\u2019t realize is that\nEnglish tea is very strong and very dark, whereas in Germany tea is fairly weak.\nAnd so my mother said no, it\u2019s fine. So I learned to drink English tea, but was not\nvery fond of it. And I wasn\u2019t too fond of mutton either, although I did like\nShepherd\u2019s pie, which is ground mutton with mashed potatoes and gravy.",
        "A: And high tea, I liked high tea. And I had never had Jell-O, and very often my\nEnglish foster mother made a dessert with different colors of Jell-O that was all\nchopped up and very pretty. And she also made lemon curd, which I\u2019d never had\nOctober 15, 2010\nbefore. And she always told me when I met them later in 1980, that I would come\nto the kitchen and I would try to help, and I would say, I will make \u2014 meaning that\nI would help her. And I remember squeezing lots of lemons for lemon curd.",
        "A: I guess so, although I really don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Yes, I went to school a week after I got there. I went to Manchester High\nSchool for girls, which was an elementary school in Manchester, so we\ncommuted from Marple to Manchester, and the twins went with me. I think they\nwere probably a year ahead of me in school. And I remember loving my school.\nAnd then when the war started in September, after a while, when bombing started\nin Manchester, like many other British children, we were evacuated to the\ncountryside. So I had another English family, a Mrs. Emerson and her daughter,\nwho was in her 20s. She was the \u2014 the \u2014 Mrs. Emerson was a widow. And I went\nto the Cheadle Hulme school, which was an affiliate of the school in\nManchester.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: No, the twins went to boarding school. And the school I went to was a boarding\nschool, but I went as a day student.",
        "A: My brother was in Harrow with his English family, and my sister was in\nBuxton with hers. My brother\u2019s family had a daughter who was a little bit older\nthan my brother, and my sister\u2019s family I think had four children. And I saw them\nonce while I was in England, we all got together in Harrow.",
        "A: I went there I think on weekends, or whatever. I just didn\u2019t go to school in\nManchester any more.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Not really. I knew that there was a war. The one thing I do remember 1s that\nPrincess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose, spoke on the radio every week\nto the children of Great Britain to keep our courage up. And that\u2019s about all I\nremember.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: I was there for about a year.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t remember, but I know in the beginning. Now, my mother stayed\nin Germany because she didn\u2019t have a German visa, she was born in \u2014 in Prague,\nso she had a Czech visa. And there \u2014 it wasn\u2019t quite as rapid. And she eventually,\nshe tried to pack up our \u2014 all our house, and our paintings, our \u2014 all our belongings\nto send to the United States, and of course nothing was ever delivered. My\nparents lost everything. But she left to go to Italy where my maternal grandparents\nhad a house, which she inherited. So she went to Italy on the pretense of going to\nsell that house, and she never left Italy. And she then went through Portugal in\nSeptember of 1940 and came directly to the United States. So I hadn\u2019t seen her\nfor a year and a half.",
        "A: He left, and came through Switzerland to Harrow. He lived in a boarding\nhouse in Harrow, so he and my brother did see each other while they were there.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: I saw him once, the one time that I went to Harrow. And then in April or May\nof 1940, my brother, my sister, I and my father all came over by boat on the\nBritannic to the United States. And my father had a research fellowship in\nYpsilanti, Michigan, because he couldn\u2019t practice medicine yet. And then a year\nlater he passed the medical exam and then he moved to Massachusetts with us.\nAnd the reason we went to Massachusetts is there were very few states where you\ncould practice medicine without being a citizen, and Massachusetts was one of\nthem. So we moved to Braintree, Massachusetts, which is just outside Boston,\nand he started his practice again, and after a beginning struggle, he became very\nsuccessful and eventually taught at Tufts Medical School, and put all three of us\nthrough college.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: \u00b039.",
        "A: No, 1940 we emigrated. We left Germany in \u201939, left England in 1940.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Yes, my maternal grandparents had died early in the 30s, but my paternal\ngrandparents, my grandfather was also a physician, they lived in Ulm. And it\nwasn\u2019t until 1942 that they were sent out of Ulm. They were told they were going\nto a Jewish retirement settlement, they couldn\u2019t pack very much. And they were\nsent to Theresienstadt, and they died in Theresienstadt within a week of each\nother in January of 1943. Now, my parents didn\u2019t know that until after the war.\nMy parents tried to get them out of Germany and couldn\u2019t. And so it wasn\u2019t until\nafter war that my father found out that my grandparents had died.",
        "A: Yes, they did. My brother in Harrow, his family was as wonderful, and in fact,\nhis foster mother eventually came to the United States, because his \u2014 their\ndaughter eventually married an American serviceman, and then brought her\nmother over to the United States. My sister\u2019s family also was very nice to her,\nexcept in the beginning. My sister at that time was 14, and they sort of treated her\nas a au pair, a household helper. And it \u2014 that didn\u2019t stop until a cousin of my\nfather\u2019s from India came to visit and explained to them that, you know, she had\nbeen brought up in a very privileged household, and that she shouldn\u2019t be treated\nlike a servant. And everything was fine from then on, and you know, she was quite\nOctober 15, 2010\nhappy, I\u2019m sure. Although, she was 14, and that\u2019s not a \u2014 an easy age to, you\nknow, uproot. But one of the children of that family did visit us in Massachusetts\nwhen I was in college. I remember he came \u2014 Aubrey came to visit. But my sister\nhasn\u2019t kept in touch with them, and my brother really didn\u2019t keep in touch with his\neither.",
        "A: Yes, my best friend from Germany",
        "A: \u2014 was named Ursula Meyer. And I did visit her in England once. I don\u2019t know\nwhere, all I know is it was near the ocean somewhere because there is a\nphotograph of the two of us on the beach in bathing suits. And I don\u2019t know what\never happened to her, we lost touch when I came to the United States. And I was\njust curious to see whether she was still alive, and whether she had stayed in\nEngland, or whether she got married, or what, I had no idea. And I first got in\ntouch with the Kindertransport Association, to find out whether they could find\nher on a list anywhere. And they did find an Ursula Meyer, but it was am-\u2014a\nmarried name, not her m \u2014 her maiden name.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: I was nine.",
        "A: Oh, when I was s \u2014 came to the United States, I was 10. Yes, I\u2014I first went to\nschool in New York City for a few weeks, until my father got the research\nfellowship in Michigan. And then I went to elementary school in Michigan for a\nyear. And then I\u2014 we moved to Braintree, and I skipped a grade, because they\nsaid I\u2019d had so much education in Germany and England that I was ready for the\neighth grade, I should really have been in seventh. And then I stayed, I went all\nthrough high school in Braintree.\nGermany and then England \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Not for me, I \u2014 I\u2014 you know, I remember my childhood as being a very happy\nchildhood and I guess I was always happy from the time I was young, and I don\u2019t\nremember really, any traumatic incidences at all, except for one in England,\nwhich I considered traumatic. My mother, when she was still able to send me\npackages from Germany had sent me a box of cherries from our Bing cherry tree\nOctober 15, 2010\nin Stuttgart. And one night we were to take a bath, and it was my turn to take a\nbath first. And the bathroom was quite chilly, but there was a nice little cabinet or\ncloset where the hot water heater was, and it was quite warm in there, and you\nusually dried yourself in there. And I was in there drying myself when I heard one\nof the twins come up for her bath. And I thought that it was Kathleen, who was\nthe very outgoing twin, and I thought, now wouldn\u2019t it be fun to close the cabinet\ndoor and then open it and suddenly say boo. Well, I had made a mistake and it was\nnot Kathleen, it was Joyce, who was a little more nervous. And of course, she\ncried and shrieked and Uncle Cornish(ph), my foster father, sent me to my room\nfor what I considered just fun, but apparently he was concerned because one of the\ntwins was crying. So I remember sitting on my bed on my beautiful new quilt,\nopening my box of cherries, and I ate every cherry one by one and I kept\nmuttering to myself, and you won\u2019t have any, I will eat them all by myself. And\nthen in 1980, when I went back to England for my foster mother\u2019s 80\" birthday, I\ntold him the story and he couldn\u2019t remember it at all. But that\u2019s about the only\ntraumatic experience I had. And the only other one was in New York, when I was\nin school for a few weeks. I remember standing up at my desk to answer a\nquestion, and the little boy behind me was measuring the length of my dress with a\nruler. And apparently my German dresses had gotten a little short as I got a year\nOctober 15, 2010\nolder, and I remember him measuring the length of my skirt. But that\u2019s about the\nonly traumatic experiences.",
        "A: No, I really don\u2019t remember. I mean, she packed everything in my trunk, you\nknow, that she thought I might want to have, like my Teddy bear and my books,\nand I don\u2019t remember too many other letters from her.",
        "A: No, no, nothing, nothing.",
        "A: Oh yes, and I \u2014I distinctly remember Roosevelt\u2019s death, because that came\nover the radio and I remember how shocked my parents were when they heard\nthat. I was actually on \u2014 on Cape Cod when World War II ended, and I heard over\nthe radio, and we all celebrated.",
        "A: No.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: I have two daughters, and I have five grandchildren.",
        "A: I got married what at that time was considered late in life. I was 27 and my\nhusband was 31 and in those days, in 1956 that was considered over the hill. Most\nof my college friends were already mothers. But I got married in 1956 and I got\nmarried at the Harvard chapel, which solved all of the religious problems \u2014 my\nhusband was Jewish. And anyone who went to Harvard, which I did, and he went\nto the Harvard Business School, was able to get married at the Harvard chapel,\nso that\u2019s where we got married and it solved all the problems of who was going to\nmarry us, and how, and what, and everybody was happy.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I majored in English and American literature.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: No, no. He actually went to the business school after I graduated. He worked\nfor a few years before he went to graduate school. So I graduated in 1950, and this\nyear was my 60\" reunion.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, it was wonderful.",
        "A: It was a great reunion.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve talked to my d \u2014 my daughters, you know, about it, and a little bit to\nmy grandchildren. But that\u2019s really why I wrote my memoir, so that they would\nknow. And you know, what they know about the Holocaust they read in \u2014 in their\nhistory textbooks, and they know what happened politically, but I don\u2019t think they\never fully realized how it affects individuals. And I thought they should know how\nit affected my family, and what happened to me when I was nine years old. And\nthat\u2019s really why I wrote the memoir. And my husband kept insisting that I should\nwrite that and \u2014 for the grandchildren, primarily.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, thank you, thank you.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I mean, they\u2019ve always known what it was like fo \u2014 you know,\nwhen I was a child from what I told them, but I don\u2019t think it really affected them.\nAs I said, my husband was Jewish, but he also did not practice his religion really,\nafter he was in his 20s. And so we did a little bit of everything, you know. We\npracticed some Jewish holidays because his side of the family did practice them.\nBut we also practiced Christmas, which is what my side of the family did, and so I\nthink I\u2019ve tried to make them non-prejudiced, and \u2014 and, you know, have respect\nfor all religions and all races. But other than that, I don\u2019t think it really influenced\nmy raising my children in any way.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Not really. My father, for example, never talked about Dachau and we never\nasked him. And it wasn\u2019t until he wrote a very small autobiography in 1972 that I\nlearned a little bit about his experiences in Dachau. And I know he told me in that\nautobiography that two other people from Stuttgart that were sent to Dachau with\nhim, died. One, because he was a diabetic and was not given insulin, and the other\nfrom some kind of intestinal infection. And as I said, my father suffered from\nsome kind of sinus problems which had to have surgery once he got out of the\nhospital \u2014 I mean, out of Dachau and he went to the hospital in Stuttgart, before\nhe went to Switzerland.",
        "A: Not really. We really didn\u2019t talk very much about it. And it was just there, you\nknow, we knew that that\u2019s what we had gone through. And the only thing \u2014 you\nasked whether my parents were able to save anything. The only thing that they\nwere able to save \u2014 and this is a\u2014 a rather unique story, a good friend of theirs was\nEmma Goering, who was a distant cousin of Goering\u2019s, who was, of course, one\nof the biggest Nazis. She was very anti-Nazi, and very outspoken, but they never\narrested her or bothered here, I guess because she was related to him. But she was\na good friend of my parents. And when my mother was getting everything ready,\nOctober 15, 2010\npacked to go to the United States, you were not supposed to take any jewelry or\nsilver, you had to declare that and give it to the government. Well, my mother\ndidn't want to do that. And Emma Goering suggested that she \u2014 my mother give it\nto her and she would bury it in her garden, in a box, which she did. And during the\nwar, my brother was in the army for four years, and toward the end he was on a\nleave, and he went to visit Emma Goering, to see if she was still al-alive. And\nEmma Goering said to him, I have something that belongs to your mother. And\nthey went into her garden, dug up the box, and because he was already a US.\ncitizen and a serviceman, he was allowed to send it to the United States. So my\nmother got back all of the jewelry that she had inherited from her grandmother and\ngreat-grandmother, her German silverware. And then several years later Emma\nGoering visited my husband and me in New York City, and she was a charming,\ncharming lady. And so that\u2019s the only thing my parents did save, and it was\nbecause of her.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: He was in Patton\u2019s army for four years.",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 no, he \u2014 he was \u2014 when we immigrated, he was 13 \u2014 14 \u2014",
        "A: He went to high school in Michigan. And then he had started the University of\nMichigan when he was drafted, and then he went in the army, and he was in the\narmy for four years.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s just that I \u2014 I guess I was a \u2014 a very, very lucky child, because my\nEnglish foster family was just \u2014 just wonderful. And as I said, I saw them again in\n1980 for my foster mother\u2019s 80\" birthday. And then I went back to England in\n2008 for the twins\u2019 80\" birthday party. And they were just so compassionate and\nloving, and so was Mrs. Emerson. And it taught me a good lesson, that\ncompassion and friendliness and love and just being good people is important, and\nI\u2019ve tried to teach that to my children.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I went back to Germany first in 1951 with my sister, we went to Europe\nfor three months. And we visited our house in Stuttgart, and then I went back\nagain in 1982, to visit my German cousins on my mother\u2019s side of the family,\nwhom I hadn\u2019t seen until the mid-30s. And we\u2019ve become very close friends and\nSO we\u2019ve gone back to Europe two or three times for birthdays and travel, and \u2014\nwith them. And so I\u2019ve been back, yes. And when I went back in 1982, we went to\nStuttgart, and the people who owned my parents\u2019 house took my husband and me\nthrough it, to show us what it was like.",
        "A: And then \u2014 not really. Apparently it was damaged a little bit during the war, but\nnot badly. And the interesting thing is, as we were leaving, a woman next door\nleaned over the fence and said, Erica, what are you doing here? In German. And it\nturns out that she was my sister\u2019s friend. She was my sister\u2019s age, and for some\nreason she recognized me after all those years. And so I explained to her what\nhappened to us. And so we did see the house in 1982.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Not really, no. I think once we came to the United States and my father\ndecided we were now going to be Americans, and you know, we really didn\u2019t\nspeak much German. But I can still speak it, and I speak it with a strong\n[indecipherable] accent, and I can understand most German. I can\u2019t understand\nlegal German or technical German, but I can read German.",
        "A: No, I\u2019m just, you know, as I said, I was very lucky, I had a wonderful English\nfamily. I know not everyone was as lucky as I was. And we\u2019ve stayed very close\nfriends, and I\u2019ve just recognized how \u2014 what a big sacrifice it was for these people,\nbecause they didn\u2019t know whether they were going to have us for a month or a\nyear or forever. I know there are some Kindertransport children who\u2019ve been\nthere, you know, were there for seven, eight, nine years. And I was only there for a\nyear. But both families were just wonderful to us, really.",
        "A: And they \u2014 be \u2014 ma \u2014 my English foster family remained friends with my\nparents and came to visit them in the United States. And then my parents visited\nthem in England, too.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: So, it was a nice relationship.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, sure, yeah, come and sit.",
        "A: Well, in the beginning, I have pictures of my father and my uncle and my aunt,\nand those have interesting stories. My uncle, who was an entomologist, left\nGermany in 1933, went first to Palestine for a few years, then to Venezuela, and\neventually ended up in Mexico City, where he became a professor at University of\nMexico, as an entomologist. My aunt, whose husband had factories that\nmanufactured felt for printing in both Germany and Italy, left in 1936 and moved\nto Italy, and a farmer hid him as a farm helper during the war. And my aunt and\nmy three cousins were saved by Italian nuns, who took them to a nunnery. So\nanyway, these are pictures of my father, and these are pictures of my mother in her\nchildhood.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, and she, you know, really grew up sort of like a debutante. And then,\nthese are the pictures of my grandparents, Dr. Ludwig, and [indecipherable]\nHecht. And they are the ones who died in Theresienstadt in 1943. And the reason\nI know that they didn\u2019t go there until 1942, late in the year was that there\u2019s a letter\nfrom them to my cousin in Italy, saying that they were going to have to leave in\nAugust of 1942. And then it wasn\u2019t til after the war that we found out that they had\ndied, but here\u2019s a picture of them.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, they stayed in Ulm until then. And these are my maternal grandparents,\nwho died early in the 30s. And they\u2019re the ones who had the \u2014 the estate in\nCzechoslovakia where I st-stayed every summer until I was probably seven or\neight. And here, this is pictures of Stuttgart, where I grew up. And this is our\nhouse and there are my brother and sister. That\u2019s me at the age of three. And there\nare my brother and I with our Steiff Teddy bears, who had a webbing.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: And then here\u2019s me learning to ski at four, and learning gymnastics. And here\nare our nannies or au pairs, or whatever they were called. And here \u2014 when I was\nlittle. And here my school friends, and here\u2019s Ursula Meyer, my best friend.",
        "A: Yes, oh, she had lo \u2014 and big, blue eyes, she was very, very pretty. And then,\nthis is the castle that my grandparents had in \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in Czechoslovakia, where I went every summer. And there I am, and here\nI\u2019m learning how to ride a bike. And here\u2019s my grandfather taking a nap after\nlunch. And this was our cook in Germany, who used to come with us 1n the\nsummer to help. And here\u2019s our nanny, or au pair. And these are relatives who\nwere visiting. And here we are outdoor bowling. And this is all in \u2014 in\nCzechoslovakia. And this place 1s also a religions shrine, so this is \u2014 this was how\nit fell apart in the 90s, and this 1s how it\u2019s now renovated.",
        "A: And it\u2019s still a\u2014 considered a religious shrine. These are paintings that my\nbrother did when he was little. Then here\u2019s another picture \u2014 oh, here\u2019s my English\nfoster family, Raun(ph) and Edith Cornish(ph). And this is their house in\nMarple. And this is the one time that I visited my brother in Harrow. And here I\nOctober 15, 2010\nam in Wales, the summer of 1939, we went camping in Wales, in Saint David\u2019s.\nAnd here I am, here\u2019s my school blazer. You see we\u2019re not wearing our blazers.\nBlack, with yellow trim. And here\u2019s Ursula Meyer, my best friend. And here\u2019s\nmy other English foster family, Mrs. Emerson and her daughter. And this is my\nfavorite teacher, she was my English teacher, Miss Andrew. And this is Cheadle\nHulme, the school I went to when the war started in \u2014 in England. And then all\nthe other photographs \u2014 oh, this is the \u2014 the boat we came over on in 1940. And\nhere\u2019s our first apartment in Michigan, very tiny apartment. And here\u2019s Eloise\nHospital in Ypsilanti, where my father got his research grant for the first year.\nAnd here\u2019s me in an evening gown because I played the violin with the Detroit\nSymphony [indecipherable]. Here\u2019s my eighth grade high s \u2014 eighth grade\ngraduation picture, my sister and our dog and my brother on a furlough before he\nwas sent overseas. And then the rest are all just pictures of me growing up, high\nschool, college. And then when we moved to massachu \u2014 to New Jersey, and I\nworked in Manhattan. Here\u2019s our wedding at the Harvard chapel.",
        "A: And here\u2019s me helping to decorate \u2014 the club let me finish decorating my\nwedding cake. And then these are our wedding pictures, our honeymoon and\nthere\u2019s our first daughter.\nOctober 15, 2010",
        "A: Milton Kanter.",
        "A: There, with a copy of Dr. Spock. And this was our wonderful, loyal Willie,\nwho took care of my daughters the \u2014 the day I went to the office. I had special\npermission to come to the office only one day a week and work at home the rest of\nthe time \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 which was very unusual in the late 50s, early 60s. But I did that for 13 years,\nuntil the children were 13 and 11, then I went back to work full time.",
        "A: At Harcourt Brace, which was the \u2014 one of the largest textbook publishers in\nthe United States, and I was editor-in-chief there from 1980 to 1990.

        "A: \u2014 the husb \u2014 my husband had to go there on business and I was invited to go.\nAnd family birthdays and all kinds of pictures like this, and then, at the back of the\nOctober 15, 2010\nbook, I have pictures of my five grandchildren, to whom this book is dedicated\nand let\u2019s see where they are. Here. This is the oldest, he\u2019s now 21, from the time\nhe was little until now. And here\u2019s the next one, who\u2019s 20, and now.

        "A: Yeah, well, I put in all the photographs because fir \u2014 first of all, in a sense, all\nthese photographs are my husband\u2019s legacy to his grandchildren.
