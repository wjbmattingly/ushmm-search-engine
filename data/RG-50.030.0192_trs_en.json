        "Q: Would you tell me your name please?",
        "A: My name is Barbara Rodbell, currently. My maiden was Lederman.",
        "Q: And where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Berlin, Germany, September 4, 1925. My mother's name was Else Citroen\nCiton, which means lemon, and it is a Dutch name because her father was from Holland had\ncome from -- to Germany from Holland, and married my grandmother, Ellen Citreon\nSileppe. Her name was Sileppe in Berlin. And so that is how the Dutch family lived in Berlin\nbecause that's where they married. They were three children, the old\u2014 four children\nactually, the oldest died very -- at 18. She was a poet and a wonderfully, well loved child,\nand she had a brain tumor and died. It took a while year and my youngest uncle tells that he\nhas never seen his mother in anything but black ever after. So I saw her in other clothes, but\nhe never saw her in anything but black as he grew up. At least that's how he sees it. People\nsees things in different ways. My mother, I remember as a childhood, as being relatively\nhappy and her oldest brother was Paul, and he was lively and he was a painter. Didn't pay\nattention to anything but painting and art. And then she -- then it was she, and then it was a\nbrother, Hans who also survived the war. The -- they all -- the brothers survived the war.\nEach of them had their own story, but they all survived the war. We lived in Berlin, and I\nhad a sister, named Susannah who was three years younger than I was. And we -- my father\nwas a lawyer, born in Hisberg, Silesian, over Silesian, and in Germany and studied in\nVerslomberland, later in Geneva for his Ph.D. in law. And he had a good practice. And he\nwas quite old really. He was 35 when he married my mother. My mother was 20. That was\ndone that way, that way, in those days. Anyway, I was born a year later and I remember my\nchildhood in Berlin as being wonderful. It was -- my father loved Berlin, and we went all\nover Berlin as soon as I could walk. And he showed me absolutely everything. Every little\ncomer, and he liked history and music and we went to museums and I still remember where\nthe Rembrandt hung in this museum in Ber-- in Berlin because he loved it so. And I\nremember the trains from Casovillan trains, and the stories he told me about how Casovillan\nused to have big dinners in those trains, and he was a very faster easter, Casovillan was.\nNobody ever got anything to eat because he was always finished before the last person was\nserved and everybody had to leave very hungry. This was one of my father's story, stories.\nAnd my sister was born three years later, and we were very happy. We always went to\nHolland on vacation. And in 1933, when we went to Holland on vacation, one of my many\ncousins of my father's, Uncle Biet Pierson who was a journalist, a editor of a paper in The\nHague said to my mother he felt that she should not go back. This was 1933. And Uncle Biet\nhad, when he was very young -- when he was 19 and, and just learning to be a journalist, he\nhad been sent to Munich to cover a trial. And nobody in Holland paid in attention to this\ntrial. And when he came back and he wrote up his paper, they said to him, \"Why are you\nmaking such a fuss?\" And he said, \"You pay attention to this trial. This is going to end up\nbeing something quite awful and better everybody pay attention.\u201d It was Hitler's trial in\n1923. And he was, you know, he was the only of them paid any attention to it. Took 10 years\ntil things really heated up. So my mother, who always listened to my father because my\nfather was the older one and, you know, he was the leader in our family said to my father, \"I\nthink we shouldn't go back.\u201d And my father said, \"What does a lawyer do in a foreign\ncountry?\" That's not a very good idea, and what am I going to do?\" And she said, \"Well, I\ndon't know. You'll find something to do. It's -- I really think we should not go back.\u201d And so\nfather said, \"Well, I'm going to go back and see what I can do.\u201d I mean he had -- I think he\ngraduated he'd already been a lawyer for 25 years. I mean it was -- it was practically\nimpossible for him to start over. He spoke a few words of Dutch, but not very much. He got\nto Berlin and he went into his office and there were his secretaries and his assistants and\nstuff. There was also a big letter from the government, which said that from now on, he\ncould only have Jewish clients. My father had no -- had very few, I should say, Jewish\nclients. I didn't know any Jewish clients that he had. But he had things like the Mid-\nEuropean Watch Industry, a ___, Swiss Watch industry. He had big companies that were\nhis clients, and now he could not represent them anymore. He packed up. And we could still\n-- I mean he could ship as much as he wanted to Holland. And we had two grand pianos, and\nhe sold them because he didn't think that we could -- would have the money to have enough\nhouse or an apartment big enough to hold grand pianos so there was a big change in our\nstandard of living. I mean I was raised with nurses and governesses and with English and\nFrench and you have Dutch and all those various things, with horse back riding and good\nschools. And when we got to Holland, of course, we had a little apartment. My father had to\ngo back to school, to the -- to the university. He worked for a Dutch ____. He worked for a\nDutch lawyer, but he had to learn Dutch, of course. He handled the clients who were very\nmuch like him who had come to Holland and, you know, he couldn't practice along because\nhe didn't have the Dutch degree. So he went to the university, and I think he was now -- how\nold was he in \u201834, \u00b035? He graduated in three years in a foreign language. I was -- we were\nvery proud of him. It was very hard. He also worked at the same time. There was a big party\nand everybody came and then a few years later the Germans walked in, and it was all over.\nWe are now getting to the point where my -- Let me go back and say that when we got to\nHolland and I got to my first school, in my class was a girl named Margo Frank. And they\nlived right behind us on the ___. We lived at the _____\u2014\u2014_\u2014w which was the back of the\nsame kind of development that they lived in. And we -- we always played at ___. That's\nhow we met. And then our parents, of course, met, having coming from Germany the same\nyear and having a lot of common and the Frank's and my parents socialized a lot and, of\ncourse, the kids played. As a matter of fact, Margo dragged me through school. Without her,\nI would have never made anything done anything because I was full of play and I was --\nwanted to become a dancer and I worked very, very hard at that, but not at much else. So\nwithout her saying, \"Today, we study,\" I wouldn't have been able to get through. So here we\nare in school and working hard and my sister's doing very, very well. She was very smart.\nAnd my father had great hopes she'd become a lawyer like he was. He would've like me to\nbecome a lawyer, but I think he gave up on me long -- very early because that was not my\nthing. I was more the way my mother's family was. More playful and -- and liked imaginary\ngames and things like that. Let's see, where shall we go now?",
        "Q: Let's -- let's talk a little more about your friends and your childhood. Did you meet Ann\nFrank too?",
        "A: Well, of course, we all played together, you know. And Ann came to the house a lot and we\nwent to her house a lot. When my kids grew up, I -- I could see that, you know, the same\nkind of thing, you know. You -- you go around to the people in your neighborhood and you\nwork together for the schools and you do various things and My sister was a lot more\nserious than Ann was. Anne liked games the way I did. And she liked to play and have\nimagina -- imaginary games, and she was very high strung -- very easily upset, and -- . My\nsister tried to get along with all that, but it wasn't always easy. Ann was a very difficult\nchild, an extremely difficult child. And not just for her family, but in school and she went to\na special school, a Montessori kind of school I think or Dalton in one of those two kinds of\nschool. And she did very well there. Not as well as Margaret, who was an absolute genius, if\nyou ask me. But who -- Margaret also was very calm, and at least what I always saw of her\nwas very calm, very deliberate, very, very beautiful. Margaret was very beautiful. Had great\nbig brown eyes -- a very serious person. She would have made a real mark in the world. I\nknow that. Just like my sister. My sister -- .I can't even imagine how wonderful she would\nhave been. She was so smart and so sweet and -- and she was very anxious to be very close\nto me which was amazing, you know, for a young girl. She wanted to see what I was doing\nand later on, as I got older, she was very interested in my friends and she always had very --\na lot of good advice for me. This is no good, and this is very good, and you know, she was\njust -- and she was so sensible. It was amazing! One of the letters I gave you 1s from her, and\nthere you will see all that. It's a very good letter. Very, very young girl! Anyway, we had a\nnormal, very happy kind of childhood with a lot of music and my Uncle Paul was a painter\nand a Dutchman, a Dutch painter, with a enormous German accent, but his nationality was\nDutch. He was born in Berlin, but at 18 he had to choose whether he wanted to be German or\nDutch because he was born in Germany but -- but he had a Dutch passport because of his\nfather. And something in him made him make the right choice and he chose Holland and he\nwent to Holland and -- and lived there even since, and became quite a well known painter\nand had a very happy life in -- in Holland. Married a beautiful woman, had a daughter, and I\nhave two very close relatives about my same age. One is his daughter, Paulinka, and one is\nthe daughter of my Uncle Hans, the younger brother of my mother who is Tamara and she 1s\nin Israel. She lives in Israel with her family. And now why was I telling you all this?",
        "Q: Family and friends.",
        "A: Family and friends. Yes.",
        "Q: Can we go back a little bit? I would like to go back just cause it has some relevance to your\nchildhood. There was a group of friends with you and Ann Frank and Margo. You had talked\nHanna. You had talked about Tummi. And there's a picture all of you playing at the party.",
        "A: Yes. Well",
        "Q: Tell us about that circle and tell us about that party.",
        "A: Well, these were -- these were mostly -- mostly, because on some of those pictures are also a\nlot of Dutch kids who were playing also who only were living in the same neighborhood. By\nthe neighborhood was entirely mixed. Wasn't all Jewish. Was a completely mixed\nneighborhood. And as far as I knew the Dutch Jews and the Germans Jews got along very\nwell. And I have just read a book which said that they were really pretty separate when it\ncame to it..you know when things got tight. But I personally have never -- have never\nexperienced that. And when I got to think about it not until I got in with a group of young\npeople who were stridently trying to survive was it really all German? -- at that point I\nrealize it was all German. It wasn't really my family that created that kind of atmosphere, but\nit was more when we were on our own, without family, you know, that it suddenly appeared\nthat I really was in a German Jewish circle. This was when we were trying to save ourselves,\nyou understand? As -- as children we played altogether -- everybody played together and\nwas very good relationships between everybody. I've never heard my parents or Otto Frank,\nwho by the way was an absolute angel, ever, you know, say anything nasty or have -- had\nany kind of problem with Dutch with the Dutch people. And, of course, I was half Dutch\nanyway. And the first time I realized I really wasn't Dutch was when the Germans came to\nHolland and there was five days where -- before -- before the Queen left Holland, while the\nGermans were there -- while the Dutch were fighting the Germans we were not allowed --\nwe had a great curfew. We were not allowed in the streets. And my grandparents and my\nneighbors had to bring -- my grandmother and my neighbor had to bring us food and\neverything because they wouldn't allow Germans -- we were then taken as Germans, not --\nnot as German Jews, but as Germans, and we weren't allowed to go out and to buy food\nexcept very limited periods of time during the day. It was the first time that I realized that\n\"Hey. Hey. I'm really German. I'm not really Dutch.\u201d I never, you know, it -- I wasn't even\naware of it, except when I came from Berlin and I went to school. I was in the -- I was in the\n3rd Grade. I was put into the 3rd Grade. I was eight years old. And I had to write what they\ncalledin____\u2014\u2014\u2014sw which write, you know, somebody reads something to you and you write\nit down. I had 40 mistakes I think in -- in 30 words, or something like that because I couldn't.\nI think even Margo had 25 mistakes, but still it was a lot less than I had. That was -- you\nknow, there I realized, you know, that it..that 1t was hard. And my clothes were all wrong.\nBecause Berlin was very -- we were very elegant in Berlin, you know. I had fur coats and a\nhat -- you know, ridiculous really if you think about it now, it's -- but that's how it was in\nthose days. In Holland, the kids were pretty much more still more ____, more plain, even in\nAmsterdam. And the clothes I had were absolutely inappropriate. So at some point there, I\nsaid to my mother, \"This is 1t. That coat goes.\" I had a Russian -- I had Russian\ncoat which was embroidered with a Russian hat, you know, with the embroidery around and\nstuff and I said, \"Never am I going to wear this thing again.\u201d \"You give it away to somebody\nin Germany.\u201d I mean I -- I -- it was too embarrassing. Nobody wore clothes that. So I had to\nget used to, you know, a lot of things like that. But I had lot more freedom than I had in\nBerlin. I mean Berlin was a big city and playing out in the street was impossible. And it -- it -\n- it was a very different life. It was a certain kind of freedom and relaxation. I didn't have a\nnurse or a governess with me all the time. I could go, you know -- I wasn't supposed to, but I\ngo more or less where I wanted to. And it was a more relaxed life. It was very hard for my\nmother, although I didn't hear her ever complain. And my -- I have a cousin who came to\nvisit the other day from Holland and she's much younger. She was much younger than my\nmother, and she said that my mother never complained. Never! Never! And -- my mother -- I\nmean she'd had a -- a cook, a cleaning woman, a maid, a nurse for governess for us. You\nknow, she never had anything like that to do. She did that social work. That's what people\ndid. And of course, not for pay. I mean she did social work and now she had to learn to cook.\nMy mother never knew had to cook. So she -- her mother was there. My -- my grandmother\nhad gone to Holland before my -- my -- my parents and she taught my mother how to cook\nbecause my mother didn't know how. And she -- she had -- I think she had some help every\nday for a few hours, but that was -- I mean for her, 1t must have been an enormous change.\nAn apartment, it had two stories but it was still a relatively small apartment compared to\nwhat she used to have and -- Of course, she was surrounded by family which she had not --\nnever had her own family. She had a lot of my father's family, but never much of her own.\nAnd here it was very different. And because the family was Dutch, of course, we slid very\nfast into the Dutch way of life and aside from my father and my mother and for the children,\nit was very nice. So I loved it in -- in Holland.",
        "Q: You had again the friends of the children you played with these photographs that you\nshowed us of all of you in a sandbox. and the more famous of one actually shows Ann Frank\nin there, but all of you were together. Can you tell us about the children in that sandbox.\nWhat were you doing and what was it like?",
        "A: Well, we had -- I think we had a -- I don't remember now exactly, but my cousin she's now\ncalled Tamera Cidor, but her name was Dolly Citreon . And -- and she was visiting and we\ntook her over to other family of ours who lived also on the _____\u2014\u2014_, who _ lived downstairs\nso they had a garden. And they had also a little baby or a brother. She was now | years old.\nHanna too -- Hanna was her name. And we went over there to play, so there was my --\nmyself, my sister, Dolly, my cousin, and Hanna, Tobby, and we were a family. And then\nHanna ____ and Ann Frank also came because they were friends of my sisters. So we\nwere all playing there in the garden. And then my mother came and said, \"I'm going to take -\n- let me take a picture of all of you because we're together here.\u201d And she took what is now\nknown as the sandbox picture. And Ann is in there. Then later on she says, \"Well now -- no -\n- only the family.\u201d Oh, the poor kids -- I can hear it. So..uh Ann and Hanna -- Hanna --\n.Hanna went away and we put the baby between us on -- at the -- on the table, and you have\nthat picture. She took that picture. On the second tape that you have, there is the mother of\nHanna, now of course much older, and she said she took the picture. I was so surprised. I\ncouldn't believe it. My mother took the picture. It's in my album and it's a long time ago.\nEven so, one could confused.",
        "Q: Sure you could.",
        "A: Yai.",
        "Q: You -- you said before that your sister, Susannah, was friends with Ann Frank.",
        "A: Yal.",
        "Q: Can you tell us the kinds of things that they did?",
        "A: Well, to my great surprise it seems they were much closer than -- than I had thought because\nagain this cousin from Holland who came to visit recently and who told that my mother was\n-- was never complaining and working very hard and really wasn't very strong, she was\ntelling me that my sister, Susannah, used to bring Anna -- Ann Frank with her every time\nthey came to visit. And they would visit in -- in The Hague, and they would visit in Glebare,\nwhere they had a little summer house, and they would stay for weeks and she describes on\nthe tape, which by the way, I do have but I didn't bring with me she describes how difficult\nAnna was. And she says how -- now they were older then. I think -- let me see -- I'm -- I was\n16 so my sister was 13, and Anna was maybe 12 at that time. So this is a later period that we\nare actually talking about now. And she describes that Anna was so very much more\ndeveloped than my sister. Although my sister was only a year older, and how her interests\nwere so very difficult and how difficult it was to keep her calm and interested and\nuncomplaining and -- and just regular you know. It's a very cute tape actually that little piece\nof it about Ann. It -- 1t was amazing to -- to most people, you know. I mean the book is, but -\n- but I could see a little bit of that I could see that she was thinking about many things. She\nthought about boys way before Susie ever dreamed of boys. And -- and she -- she would tell\nme that Susie is really very childish. Susie would say to me, \"Ann 1s just silly. Always with\nthese boys. Who watches that,\" she says. You know, she didn't want to play. So that's why I\nwas surprised when I heard that at the very end even Ann would go with Susie visiting of --\nour family and stuff. Yal. The families were very close. I mean it was due to the fact that it\ngot -- .they're at the time and they were in the same same age more or less. The children\nwere the same age. The interests were a lot alike. My father was a lawyer and -- and Otto, of\ncourse, had a business. I don't know if my father worked for him or anything or if he did any\nof his work, but I'm sure he helped him if there were any problems. So there were a lot of -- a\nlot of reasons that our families were close. One forgets, you know. One forgets how -- how\nlogical these things develop. There's nothing special. On that other tape that I gave you,\nBarry Spaanyard keeps asking the mother of Hanna -- Hanna's mother -- keeps saying, \"Now\nhow come you didn't know Anna so well? Anna's family. How come you didn't know the\nFrank's so well? Or how come you didn't -- \" And she finally gets impatient with him and\nshe said, \"Well, we were families with the Ledermann's and it was just through them that\nAnna Frank came to play with us.\u201d They were not that friendly. I mean it's just -- why should\nbe friend -- nobody is friendly with everybody. So there was no special reason or dislike or\nlike or anything. You know, people know each other or they don't know each other. So that's\nwas it.",
        "Q: What..what were the the Frank parents like. Otto --",
        "A: Uh Well, I said already, you know, how fantastic Otto was. He was wonderful with children.\nHe was just incredible with children. He was patient. He was loving. He was everything you\nsort of wanted somebody -- he was also patient with this whole situation -- with the fact that\nhe had to leave all of a sudden. I'm sure they came from the kind of background we did --\nand they were reduced to what we were. I think they would probably this was very much the\nsame. It was very much the same. He was very patient with it, and he worked very hard in\nhis business, and he did well for the short time, you know, that -- that he had it. And now the\nmother -- I don't have that much of an impression of her. I can see her. And, again, I see this\nbeautiful woman. I mean the eyes, and the hair, and just a beautiful woman. And, of course,\nI'm looking at her now not the way a child would. You know, I'm looking at her from my\npoint of view now. And I realize what in the world she went through. I mean for a woman --\nshe came from the way my mother was -- had been and -- and she didn't have the the ____.\nShe had to stay in the house with children and deal with every day things -- her own\nshopping, doing her grocery, her own cooking, her own -- It was very different from the\nway she was brought up. Anyway, she was not as patient. She didn't have the patience for\nAnn who was really extremely difficult. I mean I wasn't easy at all, but Ann was impossible\npractically. I mean she was she was difficult. And -- and -- Edith did not have that -- .the\npatience for her. She did what she could. She was not a nasty mother or an angry mother or\nhitting mother or anything. She would -- she did what she could and Ann was very luck to\nhave Otto and -- and to calm the waters between her and her mother. So it was a happy\nfamily really. And Otto had to work hard to keep Edith happy and to .to keep everything\ngoing. And, of course, Margaret did her best. She was more like her father. And it was a\nhappy family. And we saw a lot of them. All the time! I just read a book, which I gave to\nyou. The one on the ______ and in the book, it tells something about Edith, and that's it's the\nmost amazing thing. They interviewed -- the people who wrote the book, the writers,\ninterviewed two women who had been saved from -- in Auschwitz -- from Auschwitz. And\nwhat had happened was, of course, they got ill like everybody else. I don't know if it was\ntyphoid or diphtheria or one of those horrible diseases, and she said there were two women\nwho didn't give a hoot about what -- whether they would be punished or not punished or\nwhatever they did, and they were very strong. And they knew that that one of the barracks in\nAuschwitz -- that everybody had already been sent away. And they put these two girls in\nthose empty barracks, and they stole food and they gave -- fed them, and they took care of\nthem, and they survived because of these two women. And one of them was Edith Frank.\nAnd I don't think that..that there's anybody who knew about that, because I had never heard\nanything like it. And I wonder if Otto knowed, because the book just came out now. And I\ndon't know if -- you know, he'd dead. I don't know if he ever knew how fantastic she was.\nShe found her -- she found her feet -- her sea legs, you know. And she -- she -- she decided,\nyou know -- she didn't see her own kids, so she decided: Go for it! She did it. And I'm very\nhappy to hear that. I sort of heard the same sort of thing about my mother and she -- .not\nabout Auschwitz, because I don't know what happened to my mother in Auschwitz. But I\nhave a friend who got relieved from -- I think it was from Bergen-Belsen. She had a sister in\nSweden. This was Anna Marie Rosenbaum. And Anna Marie had a sister in Sweden, and\nthis -- and she..they got exchanged. She got exchanged, I think, for Germans who had -- I\ndon't know exactly how it all got together. Anyway, she managed to get exchanged, and she\ngot to Sweden. And, of course, she had -- had it very tough in Sweden. She had to work as a\nmaid for years and things like that. Nevertheless, she made it through. And Anna Marie had\ntalked to my mother in Westerborg, and my mother had told Anna Marie that when it was --\nif she ever got out of this alive, she was going to go to the university and become a\nprofessional social worker and she was going to make a life of her own and she finally\ndecided to do something for herself. Something that was important for her rather than just\nworking for the family and doing what my father wanted and -- The fellow who saved my\nlife and myself -- one of the reason we didn't end up married after the war was that we had\nthe most terrible fights. And one of the fights was about the fact that he would say that my\nfather murdered my whole family and my -- because by not wanting to go underground --\nHe had gotten papers for my mother and my sister and my father -- this friend of mine. His\nname was Monfred. Monfred had gotten papers for all of us. I had 1t way before from\nsomebody else, but he also got papers for the rest. And my mother had given him the mother\nfor it, so he could get it for her. And, of course, they didn't use it. I will tell later, you know,\nhow -- how this all came about. But they didn't use it. But Monfred used to say, \"He killed\nyour mother. He killed your mother.\u201d You know, and I would -- I mean we were young.\nRight? I was like 18 -- 17 or 18. I -- I-- no, you didn't -- and I practically would even scratch\nhim and fight and argue and -- Now, I -- I mean it's impossible to point blame. I mean it's\nimpossible. But I think women now would have thought a little bit more for themselves --\nmaybe for herself. Maybe she would have said -- a woman now would have said, \"Well, my\ndear. As much as I hate it, you know, you do your thing. But this is my life. And this is my\nchild's life, and we are staying. We are taking a chance.\u201d My father -- he was older than my\nmother. And he was more staid, and he was -- and she wouldn't leave him. I mean when it\ncame to it, she went along. And when she went, my sister went, who was only 14 then, you\nknow, although I had told her -- we all had told her, you know, that we would take care of\nher and we had a place for her and all that kind of thing.",
        "Q: Let's see if we can get this in the -- in some sequence.",
        "A: It would be better to have it in sequence.",
        "Q: Let's go back and do it and so we know what happened. You've had this child -- you're\ngrowing up. We're coming to the late \u201830s. Tell us what happened as the war came closer.",
        "A: Well, as far as I was concerned, until the Germans walked into Holland, I didn't know very\nmuch about anything. I mean I knew that there was Hitler and that Germany was __ for us,\nyou know. Things were bad. But I was just playing and going to school and dancing and\nhaving a good, you know, a good time. And then one day there was -- the radio started\ntalking and -- and then we heard this lot of noise and we heard the bombardment of\nRotterdam. We heard it all the way in Amsterdam. I mean it was just -- the planes, the low\nhum of the planes, and the wait of it. And I remember standing at the window and my father,\nyou know -- the Germans were marching 1n right through our street which was the main\nstreetin_____\u2014\u2014_. It now has a different name, but it was then. I see them singling\n____ marching in_______-\u2014: you know, marching into, over the ____ into the through the\n____ toward the center of the town. And my father standing in the window and saying to me,\n\"Take care of your mother.\u201d I was 15. Take care of the -- your mother. You know, they'll\ncome for me tomorrow. And my -- my father was not political. He'd never been political.\nAnd that's probably..that's one of the things I'd like to talk about -- about the intellectuals in\nGermany who felt that they were too good to talk politics. To talk politics was a terrible\nthing, and you didn't talk. It was for -- for who -- not very good people. I mean you couldn't -\n- you shouldn't talk politics, you know. So they didn't. And it's we all must be involved\nand..and fight against things that are bad now, you know, so it doesn't -- terrible things don't\nhappen later. But that's not what they did. And then -- so he thought he was going to be\npicked up tomorrow. Of course, it took a year and a half, but, you know, it did happen in the\nend. The -- the first thing that happened, well, many terrible things happened then. People\nstarted -- Jews starting jumping out of windows and out of -- of balconies and -- and into --\nkilled themselves with gas and I remember standing on the balcony. We lived on the third\nfloor, and the balcony was on the back of the house and -- and there was a center which had\nthe -- had the gardens in -- in the bottom and then balconies everywhere, three stories high.\nAnd I remember a man being saved from trying to gas himself and him yelling and\nscreaming I don't want to. Don't do this. Don't do this, you know. Don't save me, you know. I\nwant to die. I want to die, you know. And I was 15. I mean this made a helluva impression\non me. And I said to me mother, \"What -- why does he want to die?\" You know, I mean\nwho wants to die? And then there was -- I mean a period there where people it wasn't one or\ntwo -- that's what I want to say. It was heaps of people killed themselves. And then my\nparents told me it's because they're Jews and -- and Hitler, you know, doesn't like Jews and it\nwas the first time I was really aware of -- We're weren't religious so we'd never had any\nkind of -- or very little connection with it, although my grandparents, I think, were. And I\nremember going to temple with my grandfather when he was still alive and in -- in Berlin.\nHe died in early -- in Berlin while we still living in Berlin. And I remember it being a happy\nexperience. He put me on his back. It was the -- I -- what -- what is the day when when they\nfinish reading the Torah and they start over. Which one? Whatever. And he put me on his\nback and they danced around, you know, and stuff like that. I -- it was pretty wonderful. And\nI remember him laying the Tefillin and I never knew what it meant and and we had\nChristmas at home. I remember the Christmas tree in Berlin was great, with the real candles\nand the applies and the ___ and the nuts and the the gifts for..for the maids and for\neverybody, you know. Everybody had gifts and presents. Took my mother two months to get\nready for Christmas. And I don't remember Hanukkah in Germany at all. And I don't\nremember it really until the Germans came into Holland. Then that year -- and I think it was\nthe Frank's also -- I think we -- we joined for the first time a reformed temple. I remember\nthe Rabbi\u2019s name. His name was Malhe, and that was spelled with a E, not an A. And I\nremember him so -- so clearly, and I even learned to read a little bit of Hebrew which I have\nentirely forgotten because it only lasted a year. And my sister also went there, and I think\nMargaret and Ann and -- and quite a lot of..of people. That was the occasion. I mean once\nthe Hitler didn't shove us back into the old mold of life. And 1t made a big difference in any\ncase.",
        "Q: What was your question?",
        "A: You're doing just fine. Just tell us what happened now.",
        "A: Okay. School. We went to school and we had a headmaster who was very anti-Nazi. And\nmuch too outspoken. I mean nobody knew what to do and how to behave in those days.\nThere was one group who knew a little bit and that was the communists. But I didn't -- didn't\nknow anything about communists, but they were the ones who knew already a little bit\nbecause they had had some people who had escaped from camps in German, you know. That\nwas possible to escape. I mean at the very beginning in 1940, \u201841, people could escape from\ncamps in Germany. And these -- these communists had already been picked up in Germany,\nput in camps, and they had come through Holland and they had told a little bit of what they\nhad seen and what they had heard. And so they informed their Dutch friends -- the Dutch\ncommunists, a little bit about things -- what things were like. So the communists were a little\nbit prepared, but nobody else was prepared in Holland. And",
        "Q: What happened to you? You started to say --",
        "A: The school. The school. Well, the -- the headmaster called assembly and made a large, big\nspeech about the fact that, you know, about the Germans and that we were a free country and\nwe shall remain free and we all sang the song, you know, the national anthem, and.\nAnyway, he got picked up very early, and he died very early because that was -- somebody,\nof course, told on him. They were fascists in the schools. And then one started to hear about\nfascists right and left. And one started to hear about our neighbors downstairs who turned out\nto be not too good, and then we suddenly started to hear things like our neighbors on the\nother side -- well, he was Jewish, but she was not. Boy, they're lucky. I mean things like that,\nyou know, which you'd never -- I'd never thought they were lucky. I -- you know, I mean,\nthey're know different from us, and weird things -- weird things like that. As far as the school\nwas concerned, I think we could go to school for a little while, but then, again, there was an\nassembly and we were told that the Jewish kids now had to leave the school and go to a -- a\nJewish school, and have be separated from the others. And I went to my parents and -- and I\nsaid, \"I don't want to go to a Jewish school. I'm not going to a Jewish school. I will not go to\na Jewish school.\u201d And I can just see my children coming to me and saying I'm not going to\ngo to this school. You know, I can just see the shock. I -- it was impossible. I was really\nimpossible. I got to be very, very rebellious in every way, and I would not go to school. My\nsister did. She went to a Jewish school. And it was very frightening because what the\nGermans started to do 1s to isolate the Jews into various groups. I mean they -- at a later date,\nnot right then in the beginning, but at a later date, they would go and pick up the kids 1n the\nschool, and then make the parents come to get the kids and, of course, keep the parents and\nthat was the end of that you know. Some people were then sent home again if their parents\nhad good papers, you know some kind of exceptional papers. But I was -- every time I heard\nthat the school -- the Germans or -- or green police or the Dutch cooperators -- the Nazis, the\nDutch Nazi, and anaspears. They were called then anaspears marching toward the school,\nyou know, I would run to that school and finally after I had Monfred as a friend, he said to\nme, \"The one thing you do when the Germans go somewhere 1s not go there.\u201d You know, I\nmean I was so stupid, but we all -- most of us were because what did we know, you know,\nabout how to save yourself and that you had to save yourself. You had to be careful. You\nhave to learn to be scared. And I was not that scared. You know, I was dumb. I was plain old\ndumb. But it was very frightening to have my sister in a Jewish school separated in the\neastern part of Amsterdam. We lived in the south and they had to go to_Oster, Amsterdam --\nAmsterdam ost . to school. Most of my friends did do that. Most of my friends that were\nJewish did go to school. Some of them were picked up, and their parents and them shipped\noff. Others, somehow, survived, you know, just like me. You never know what's going to\nhappen to you.",
        "Q: What did you do during the day?",
        "A: I went -- I had to go to school. And I wanted -- I told you I wanted to be a dancer. And there\nwas school ran by Alice Kayser in Amsterdam, in___. And she had a dancing school as\nwell, where you learned other things as well. So it was -- it was recognized as a school. And\nmy Uncle Paul came and talked my parents into into letting me go. He was always my\nsavior in that respect because he had -- .my father was just adamant I was going to go to a\nacademic school. He didn't understand what was going on at all. I don't know if it was a wish\ndream, if it was something he didn't want to understand, or whether it was just\nincomprehensible to him because he had been raised in a human -- humanitarian fashion and\nthe Germans he knew were like that. He knew many, many good Germans, and, of course,\nthere were many, many good Germans. What -- but they -- they didn't have any power. So\nmy father had trouble to understand and to -- he had great trouble to go along and make wise\ndecisions in regard to the situation which -- which deteriorated from day to day. the first\nthing that happened was that the Germans took the German passport that my father had, so\nhe had no nationality. He was stateless. We had applied for Dutch citizenship. You had to be\nthere five years or I forget how many years before you could apply for Dutch citizenship and\nit's going to be granted in May of 1940. And the Germans got there just a bit too fast. It --\nthis is very bad for me later on, because the Dutch -- dear Dutch after the war when, you\nknow, my parents were dead. I was alone and they would not give me the Dutch citizenship,\nbecause they said your father applied, not you -- that your father applied. Now at the time, I\nwas under 16 and if you were under 16 the whole family was all naturalized at the same\ntime. But after the war, you know, I was nearly 20 and I was so called a grown-up and I had\nto apply for myself and they -- even though, you know, I went through all this S-H-I-T, and\nthey would not give me that citizenship. They sent me back the money. My father had paid\n200 Gilden, and they sent it back I mean the bureaucracy was just so incredible. There were\nmany other things which I'll tell when we get to that.",
        "Q: Let's get back.",
        "A: Yeah. So anyway, the school was -- I went to Alice Kayser, and I went there for -- as long as\nmy parents were there and could pay for it. I went to Alice Kayser. In the end she was also\ntaken away. And then that part of my life was over. My grandmother -- and I don't know the\nexact date now -- it was 19 -- it must be \u201842 my grandmother had a home for elderly people.\nThese were old people who brought their own furniture and their own things. They were --\nand she had nurses. It was like -- what would you call it now? A home for the elderly I mean.\nand she ran it. It was her. I mean she set it up. She -- she had to make -- to earn money and\nand this is what she did. She had help, of course. And one day they came and took\neverybody including her. They had just emptied out the place. The Germans they had came.\nAnd my mother was beside herself -- beside herself. What to do? We had to get her back.\nNow the youngest brother, my mother's youngest brother was -- lived in France, and if you\nwant to, I can tell that story. But he lived in France. The older brother lived in The Hague,\nnear The Hague in Gosmer and had no funds, you know, whatsoever. So my mother went\nand took our jewelry to a jeweler. She got in touch with a guy named Putcomer, who was\nknown to mediate between Germans and other people and -- to get people free. And he said\nto her that she had to give industrial -- the Germans would take industrial diamonds for my\ngrandmother. Well, my mother went and gave to____ Nave who was a jeweler, her jewelry\nand said, \"I need industrial diamonds. Just see what you can do.\u201d And Nave came back and\nsaid there are no more industrial -- you know, Holland was closed up and -- there were other\npeople besides us that were looking for that -- industrial diamonds and -- and he didn't have\nany more. So Putcomer told the Germans. The Germans came back and said we will take\ngold bullion -- gold bars, thick gold bars. So my mother said to Nave, \"It's gold bars. Get us\ngold bars.\u201d And then Nave managed to make or get or somehow gold bars, using my\nmother's jewelry as payment. And I remember that one day after my class at -- was it after\nclass -- I think -- well, whenever I was told to go on my bicycle and pick up a package from\nNave. And I had -- I had two bags, you know, these -- these Dutch bicycles -- these black\nbicycles with a -- with the saddle bags. In one side was my books and the other side was --\nwas -- the gold bouillon. And Nave just handled them to me. I think he wrapped him. Not\nvery much. I saw them. And I brought them to my mother. And my mother gave them to Mr.\nPutcomer and Mr. Putcomer gave them to the Germans and my grandmother got out. And\nshe then, of course, she couldn't live in her house because that was -- they closed the house\nthen. So she came and lived with us. And it was terrible. I mean, for my mother. It was\nextremely hard to have another mouth to feed. It was very -- it started -- you had to start\nbuying on the black market. It was starting to be very difficult. I don't know if we already\nhad ration coupons at this time or not but any case and my mother was so worried about my\ngrandmother -- that she would be sick. She was in pretty good shape, but she was a\ntyrannical old lady. And I can just see my poor mother between my father, who was so\nscared he was starting to get heart trouble and a little ulcer and -- and trying to keep us kids\ncalm and trying to run the house and trying to get the food on the table and we -- it must\nhave been -- and she started to get very, very thin. I mean my mother got very thin. And I -- I\nwas very busy with myself. I was discovering boys and I was 16 and, you know, I..and but I\neven noticed she was getting very, very thin. And I -- I loved her to distraction. I mean she\nwas my one solid -- my, you know, and -- and so was my father except I started to see he\nwas scared and that was very scary. Well, where were we? So anyway",
        "Q: Your grandmother has gotten out.",
        "A: The grandmother came back. Yal. That -- So one day my tyrannical smart, but what do you\ncall 1t when you -- impulsive grandmother said, I have to get some of my paintings. I have to\nget some of my rugs. I have to get some of my this, and I have to get my silver and my --\nElse, you need it, she said to my mother. You should have it. I mean why should the German\nget it. What the Germans used to do was after they took everybody out of the house, they\nwould go and take all the furniture and whatever was there and I am -- I don't know what\nthey did with it. I think they probably later on gave it to the people who were bombed out, or\nthey gave it to Goering and he took what he wanted and then gave it to -- I mean I just don't\nknow where the stuff went. But my grandmother went, without telling my mother, went to\nher house. Of course, she had the key and she went in and, of course, the house was being\nwatched, and my grandmother was taken again. And that was it. I mean there was no jewelry\nto sell. and Mr. Putcomer -- my mother starting running around to Putcomer, to this, to that,\nand she couldn't get my grandmother back out. And I have letters of hers and I mean which\nare so -- so touching. There's just no words for it, you know, I mean, where she says \u2014 \u201cOh,\nmy poor Mooty,\u201d she calls her Mooty, of course, \u201cand Mooty, she doesn't even have a\nblanket and she doesn't even have a sweater. I mean she just went there. Right? She does\nhave anything, and how am I going to get to her?\u201d And these letters are also a brother in\nVoltsneir who couldn't budge. He couldn't -- Anyway, and she managed, she got to\nsomebody who managed to bring my grandmother a blanket and to bring my grandmother a\nsweater and to bring her some shoes while she was still in -- on the ___, there was\nwhich was a Jewish theatre. It was in the Amsterdan Oldst, which had become a Jewish\nsection. There was a Jewish theatre where -- where plays and musicals and stuff were being\nperformed and that was now used for a collection place for Jews from Amsterdam and that\nwere going to be shipped to Westerborg. And while my grandmother was still in Westerborg\n-- sorry -- while she was still in this ____ there, my grand -- my mother managed to get\nthings to her. People took it in. I don't know how. But she managed it. And she agonized.\nAnd she got thinner and thinner. And then one horrible thing after another happened. My\nUncle Hans and Ava -- my cousin Ava, who came to visit me just now, told me these stories\nabout Ann that I mentioned. Hans and Ava who had a little baby did go underground. And\nmy -- my father was just so upset because he said oh, if they ever find them they will be\npunished more than the Jews are already punished. At the time they thought all Jews would\ngo to labor camp and just work, you know. And my father was very worried about that. Hans\nwas his favorite cousin and he really was worried about that. Anyway, Hans and Ava --\nYou want their story?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: You -- just very briefly. In fact, this is a good place to stop. I think we're going to change\ntape and then we'll pick up the story again.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: I'll like to come back to Grandma, would you please.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Would you both tell us her name and tell us what happened to her?",
        "A: Her name is Ellen Citreon Sleppe. Her name is Sleppe. I think I mentioned her when I spoke\nabout Berlin. What happened to her was that she was first sent to Westerborg, where she was\nquite awhile. She stayed quite awhile, and then she was sent to Bergen-Belsen which was, in\na way, not as bad as Auschwitz. It was bad enough and she did died there. She died of\nillness, but the stories that come back about her are fantastic. Again, this Anna Marie\nRosenbaum I talked about earlier who was exchanged to Sweden, she was telling about my\ngrandmother and she actually brought me a little purse which my grandmother -- .send it to\nme, which my grandmother had given her. she said that my grandmother always had some\ntea. If it was made out of thistles or if 1t was made out of anything you know or what I sent --\nI -- we did send packages to them in Westerborg. We managed to do that. And she had tea\nand she would have a -- a napkin over an orange crate and she would always have something\nwhen people came to visit, and she was always upbeat and she was always brave. And my\ngrandmother had been a volun -- done voluntary work as a nurse and she was doing that in\nthe camp. She was 72. She wasn't old. And she was extremely energetic, and so when she\nwas sent to Bergen-Belsen, she lasted quite awhile there, but in the end, she did die in\nBergen-Belsen. But we heard nothing but nice things about her. Anyway where shall we go\nnow?",
        "Q: What happened to you? Grandma has been taken away.",
        "A: Grandma has been taken away. And we are now starting to -- to get -- people my age -- I was\n-- let's say, I was 16 going on 17 I guess. The Germans started to call up young Jewish\nchildren like me who were 16 and up. At 16 you were considered a family on your own by\nthe Germans. And they would call up -- these German -- .young people by name, not in big\n___, but by name. And I had many friends who were called up and we used to have -- they\nhad parties before they -- the night before they went, they would have parties and they would\nsit around and they would say oh, what we're going to do. We're all going to get together. It\nwas like ___, you know, as if they were going to Israel, like it was going to be a -- a\nsummer camp or, you know, a holiday camp or something. Yes, we going to work very hard,\nbut in the evening we'll put on your lipstick and we'll all be together and we will sing and\nwhen the war is over, the Americans will come and we will be saved, you know -- this kind\nof atmosphere. Now when I was 16, I needed -- my father worked for the Yotsrat, which was\none of the things that gave you a permit to -- it postponed you're being, supposedly, your\nbeing taken away. And when I was 16 I had to get my own security. I didn't -- I wasn't secure\nanymore under his permit so I needed a permit of my own. And they looked around and\nthey looked around and it turned -- I managed -- they managed to get it for me. I don't know\nhow, but I had to go to work work in Amsterdam Oldst, -- eastern Amsterdam and I got a\nplace in what was called the Cultural Mission and it was to____. I think it was to\nI am not sure. That's the one that described in the book, and that's where I met Monfred, and\nthat's where -- I think that's where -- that was the ___. Now there it was mostly, perhaps\neven all, and I'm not sure of that, because I didn't pay attention to it, X-German Jews. It was -\n- and there was -- they were a lot of communists there. And that was the first time that I ever\nheard the word, and that I, you know, ever came near to hearing but there was some kind of\norganization. What happened was I had to work -- I worked 1n organizing courses. God help\nus. Courses for people who were going to be shipped and killed and murdered in various\nways which we supposedly didn't know, which -- but what I was -- which I was told by the\npeople for the first time are the people in___. They told me -- the young people there\n-- they were conscious. They were political, and they were conscious of what was going on\nand they said to me, \"All the young people that you're sitting around with -- you silly goose.\nThey're all going to be dead within two weeks.\u201d Now that might have not been true, but\nthat's what they told me. And I started -- I said that's not true. I went home and I told my\nfather. I said you know, I was told that. And he said, \"That's nonsense. Germans would never\ndo a thing like that.\u201d And -- and I -- at that time I had met Monfred and I told Monfred and\nMonfred, who was my friend -- my boyfriend, he was 20 -- .who became a boyfriend. Matter\nof fact, I met him in____.. I took courses as well as organizing the classes for others. And\nin one of the courses and, of course, on ___very necessary for people who were going to get\nkilled. And in a course on ___ I met -- there were two fellows actually that I liked, and one\nof them was Monfred. And Monfred and I started going out vaguely if there was such a\nthing. I mean he walked me home and, you know, picked me up and we walked. There was\nno transportation so we walked to __. And he said to me about this remark of my father's --\nGermans wouldn't do a thing like that. He said, \"But your father doesn't know these\nGermans. These are not the Germans your father knows -- knew. These are different\nGermans.\u201d He said to me, \"Look at the soldiers. Look at them. That's the kind of German.\nLook at the Nazi. Don't look at the kind of Germans -- the lawyers and doctors and the kind\nof people that your father knew in the voluntary organization. Look at who is running this\nplace.\u201d And he tried to educate me, you know, to tell me. It was hard because I believed my\nfather. You know, I mean he was my everything and I -- I couldn't believe it. But I told my\nmother. And my mother said, \"Mon might very well be right.\" And she said, \"Bring him\nhome.\u201d And I brought Monfred home and he and my mother and my sister became fast\nfriends. I mean they believed in Monfred, more than I believed in Monfred because I had\nsomething to protect. And so -- but he -- he -- he was everything they said he was, you know.\nHe was the rock of the ages, and at 20. He came from a different kind of family also from\nGermany, but very different. And he was political from a very, very early age, and so was his\n-- his sister was less political, but very conscious of the situation. And anyway Monfred told\nme that I would be murdered if I -- \"If you get called up,\" he said to me, \"you do not go.\u201d\nAnd I said, \"That is impossible. I mean what would happen to my parents if I don't go.\u201d And\nMonfred said to me, \"Nothing that wouldn't happen otherwise,\" he said. And it was terrible. I\nmean I said, \"What do you mean?\" And he said, \"Everyone who goes and gets into their\nhands will be killed.\u201d He said, \"They are all going to die.\u201d And I wouldn't believe it and I\ncouldn't believe it. So he took me to a party -- one of those parties with the kids and\neverybody was sitting around saying we're going tomorrow and rah rah -- and Monfred said\nto me, \"You see this guy over there, Leo Vials?\" \"Yes.\u201d He says, \"He's not going.\u201d I said,\n\"That's impossible.\u201d He's saying he's going. He said, \"That's what you have to do. Nobody\nhas to know that he's not going, but he's part of us. And he is not going.\u201d And then it took\nhim about three hours to explain to me how anybody could not go, and what you'd do if you\ndon't go. And -- and how you survive, and where do you get food. And where do you get\nmoney and -- And this was my first acquaintance with the possibility, you know, of not\ngoing. And then in my dance class -- I went after work to a dance class -- I met a fellow\nnamed ___ and he had a friend who he told me could get me false papers. Ike came to me\nand he said, \"It is time for you to start thinking.\u201d Now he was Dutch. He was not Jewish --\nand he said to me, \"It is time for you to start thinking about doing something about not\ngoing.\u201d I said, \"Where do you go come on. Where do you take it.\u201d He said, \"I have a friend\nwho told me all about it.\u201d He said, \"You need paper.\u201d And he said, \"It'll be 300 gilden.\u201d I\nremember that. 300 gilden. That was a lot of money you know. And I came home and I said\nto my Mother that I needed the money and she said, \"What for?\" And I said, \"For the\npapers.\u201d And she said, \"Tomorrow, when you go back to school you'll have it.\u201d And those\nwere my first false papers. And they were very bad. But they saved my life. And on the\npapers -- in -- in those days, at the early days, the -- the false papers were people who died or\npeople who had happened to have really lost them or various ways that you could get papers\nand what they would do 1s they would take out the picture of the person -- the original\nperson, and insert your -- your picture and your fingerprint and whatever else they had to\nchange -- to change. And, of course, these were not papers that had a J on it, which those\nwere identify papers without a J. They looked very authentic. Now mine was of a 22 year old\ngirl. | was 17 maybe and I looked like 13. Pigtails, little. So they were unlikely papers. If\nanybody really stood there and looked as it said, this girl is 22 years old you know. So those\nwere my papers. And I had them. And then one night -- oh, he also, Monfred also -- then I\ntold Monfred I had the papers and he looked at them and he said, \"They're not bad. They're\nnot bad. They're very good. Keep them where you can get to them.\u201d And then we went to\nanother party, and there he had organized that one of the escaped communists from Germany\nwas there and he took off his shirt and it was, you know, he had welts and -- and x-cuts and I\nmean it was pretty bad to look at it. And he -- and this guy told us that, you know, that he'd\ngotten that in one of the camps, you know, and he had -- I think Bergen-Belsen. He had\nescaped and he was, he was telling us about the camps. And he was telling us about the salt\nmines and he was telling us about all sorts of things, you know, that and when we were\nthrough with that, Monfred said to me, \"Do you believe me now?\" I believed him. I believed\nhim! And I came home and I said to my father -- I told my father I had the papers, my false\npapers and I said to him, \"I'm not going. Whenever they call me, \"I said, \"I'm not going.\u201d\nAnd my father said, \"You have to go.\u201d He said, \"What will happen to us.\u201d And there came\nthis beautiful guilt was put on me like a hood you know, all over. If you try to save yourself,\nthat's what it meant, you know, we will all die. Because in that -- in Westerborg, they had\nvarious kinds of barracks. They had barracks for -- the normal barracks for people were\npicked up normally, and they had barracks that had a big S on it for Straasburger, and in\nthose barracks were the people who had been bad, you know. And that would -- would be\nthem. And those people would go on transports first. They would -- in during the selections.\nI think because I know very well that some of them escaped and some of them got out and\nsome survived just as much I guess. Maybe a less percentage, but just as much as anybody\nelse, which in Holland wasn't good. So for months, I tried to live with that, you know, and\nsay, \"Okay. I can't kill my family.\u201d And my father, he felt he had calmed me down. And then\none night we were sitting on our big window in the living room and we were looking out. It\nwas -- already it was curfew. There were curfews at night. And all of a sudden, we see trucks\ncome out. Long rows of trucks. And they're starting at the ____ at the -- at the high rise\nthat you saw in the picture. On the _____\u2014s not on the ____ on ______ where we lived --\nand they were coming out. And I -- I mean I couldn't believe what was happening. They\nwere pick -- going into every -- the way this -- and the street is set up that they were -- every\nentrance had steps going up to a platform, and then a wide staircase going up to another\nplatform and on that platform were six apartments. I think there were six. And they would --\nat that point they did not just pick up everybody, you know. They -- they came with lists and\nthey picked up people by name and they took -- I know I remember it as today, they picked\nup old Mrs. Triman Mr. Triman was married to a Gentile lady and he was okay. But they\npicked up his mother. And she could hardly walk. She was a very old lady, and I -- my\nstomach -- they were good friends of ours. My stomach just turned. They picked up all the\npeople I knew. And they stopped about two stoops before ours -- two -- you know, two\nplatforms before ours. And, however, Monfred always knew what was going on. And he\nknew -- he lived in another part of town. And he knew that they were doing our street. And\nhe sent this Leo Vial that I mentioned -- the guy. He had good false papers. He was a\nGerman civilian -- German soldier of some sort. He had -- wore a long leather coat and he\nwas on a motor bike and had hood on. I mean you can imagine he looked like. And right in\nthe middle of all this going on, the door bell rang and, of course, we -- my parents thought\nthey were gonna -- I mean I thought I was gonna die and we thought how come. You know,\nthe trucks aren't this far away. They aren't at our house yet. How come? What's going on?\nAnd it was Leo Vial, and he came to get me. Monfred had sent him to get me. Right in the\nmiddle of all this thing going on. This curfew and everything! Right? So I put my false\npapers in my pocket and I said to my, of course, the J was not on my clothes. I took it off.\nAnd I said to my father, \"Goodbye.\u201d He grabbed me, and he kicked Leo down the stairs and\nLeo drove off and told Monfred, \"I can't get her. She -- they won't let her go. I can't make a\nfuss. If I make a fuss, I get arrested. So I can't, you know, make a fuss.\u201d So he left and I was\nleft there and, of course, that -- as I said, they stopped two platforms before us so nothing\nhappened to us that night. But that was -- after the next getting together I went to____ and\nI talked to all the people there and they didn't trust me because I was blabber mouth and\neverything, but they said -- they said to Monfred, \"Hide her if you can.\u201d And that's what\nhappened. Monfred's father had a factory where they made cosmetics, I think, and soap\nbottles and all this little stuff, and the first night I spent -- I was hidden in the factory. And it\nwas right close to Ann Frank were -- the Ann Frank house. I mean it was on the same kind of\na canal. I don't know if it was on the Frank's house, but it was on one of the canals. It was the\nsame building, the same situation. And I stayed there, but they weren't planning for me to\nstay there. They couldn't have people stay in that house, so some how Monfred had arranged\nfor me to go to a paisson where the woman didn't know anything about me. She got my false\npapers and she thought I was that person and she registered me with the police under that\nname and the police didn't you know, they just registered me and that was it. And I lived\nthere and that's where you have the pictures from -- the pictures of Monfred and me. They\nwere taken in my room at that paisson. That was -- that was my first underground place.\nAnd I even got mail. They arranged even for me to get mail so the woman wouldn't get\nsuspicious that I was alone -- a loner and that maybe, you know, there was something wrong\nwith me. And she got my coupons. I got food coupons, which Monfred somehow got. I had\neverything. I went to ballet class, a different school, of course, not -- because Alice Kayser\nhad already been picked up, so I went to a different school and I will tell you about that\nschool later, but in any case, I lived a relatively normal life. I was no more hungry than\nanybody else and -- and it wasn't so bad then anyway during that early period. And Monfred\nand I became very good friends and, you know, I couldn't go to _____ anymore, of course. I\nwas finished with that part of my life. I was underground. My parents were still there. You\nknow, I forgot -- let's see. My parents were picked up twice. And the first time it might have\nbeen before I finally left, but I'm not sure. Maybe it was. I came home. It might have been\nbefore I finally left. That was when Ike said, \"Now you need papers.\u201d ___ said -- . Yes it\nwas before I finally left. Again, I was sitting -- and was up in the attic with a girl from next\ndoor who was half Jewish, and we heard all that noise. And there was this during the day and\nthe green police were picking up everybody in the street, everybody who was Jewish on that\nstreet. And what they hadn't done -- they hadn't stopped the traffic and they hadn't stopped\nthe trollies. They hadn't stopped every -- anything. It was during the day and everything was\ngoing on normally and they were just having themselves a little rautsey_ there. And I -- the\ngirl next door went over the roof to her house and I went down and my father wasn't home\nbecause it was a working day, you know, and I took off the J and I took my false papers and\nI went -- no, I didn't have false papers. I had nothing! That's right. I had nothing. And I went\ndown the stairs and again with the pig tail, you know, the whole works. I came on the lower\nplatform and two German soldiers jumped up on it. And I was standing there in the middle.\nLittle German girl in pig tails. Right? Little bag that said gym class. And they said to me,\n\"Get the Hell out of here. We've got work to do\" or some kind of thing. __ That's what they\nsaid.___. And it -- and I went and then I went on the trolley. I mean the trolley was\nrunning. I went on the trolley and I went -- I went to -- to Ike __ mother house --\nmother's house. And he -- they hid me. And then when he said, \"You need false papers.\u201d\nThat's how it was -- coming back to me. That's when I got my first false papers. And his\nmother hid me for three days and during those three days I kept calling home and finally, of\ncourse, I didn't get an answer because they had taken my sister and my -- and my mother,\nand my father, of course, went there -- there too. They had taken them in some gym room of\na high school where they assembled them. And at that time my father's paper which said that\nhe was working for the Yotserat and had -- had given him a freedom a permit and he -- and\nthey let him out. They let my family out. And that was -- that was the first time they were\ntaken away. Now, here I'm now going back to where I was in this paission. My mother at\nthat time -- she had given some things to some Gentile neighbors below us. She had given\nsilver, some clothes, some valuables -- things that she wanted to keep that she thought might\nbe safer with them in case of an emergency. She had given things to one of my uncles,\nYohan ___, who later became the head -- the director of the big theatre in Amsterdam\nafter the war. paintings and stuff like that. Anyway, I'm in this _paission and I'm going to\nschool and everything. And I hadn't seen my parents for a long time. We talked over the\nphone. I -- I'm very homesick, very homesick. And they are -- they want to see me. Right?\nAnd it's -- it's going to be a holiday. It's something we call ___, which I think is ____ but\nI'm not sure. It was about June 18th that I went there or June 19th, 1942. And I -- Monfred\nsays to me, \"You are crazy. You should not do such a thing. You never know what's going to\nhappen, you know.\u201d I mean nothing has been announced. He hasn't heard through his\nsources that anything's going to happen, but you just don't know and it's better not and why\nshould you. You know, I had to put up a star and -- and a J to go to my -- to go home. I mean\nif the neighbors would see me without, you know, I mean, they would know that I was -- it\nwas ___ It was terribly dangerous. It was stupid. It was dangerous. And I did it anyway. I --\nI went to somebody's house, sewed on the J, lightly but I sewed it on, and I went to see my\nparents and my sister. And, of course, there was a lot of crying and there was a lot of\nhappiness that we were still there and we were still together and it's now 1943, June 1943.\nAnd everything goes fine that first evening and then the next morning at six, six o'clock -- in\nthe letter that I wrote later, I write the right time a woman we used to call Cassandra came --\ncomes up and said, \"I just heard. This whole area is closed off and we're all -- this 1s the big\ndeal for this area. All the Jews are going to go. This is not a little rautsey by name. This is\nnot by name. This is everything. Everybody!\" And I was there. I was there! I was caught! I\nwas -- I couldn't -- I mean it was terrible. At the same time, you know, I was with my family\nand if anything happened to them, it would happen to me and this was it, you know. And my\nmother said to my father, \"Frans, _____,\"\" which means Frans, she goes. She has to leave,\nyou know. And I had my papers. I had my papers. Couldn't take a thing. My father says to\nme, \"Bless you. Go. This is the end. I think this is it. This really is it. This is the last time.\nThis is it.\u201d He said, \"You go. You go. Try it. Doesn't matter anymore, you know. Just try it.\u201d\nAnd I didn't even think how fantastic that was, you know, that I had his -- at least at the last\nmoment that he said I agree with you, go. And not that it lessens the guilt. Really, it doesn't\nlessen the guilt of not being with them, you know, not participating in that thing that\nhappened to them. We had a hiding place in the house which was in the attic where there\nwere two nice rooms in the attic and there was a double wall and we had suitcases. They\nused to be called elephants. They were more like trunks with a rounded top and they were\ngrey, and that's why they're called elephants and on the back of one of those, my mother had\nmade a handle, and she had made a big hole in the wall and you know, Susie -- she promised\nme she would put Susie in that hole. And I said to her, we will come and get her, you know.\nAnd you can go in there too. She had papers. Monfred had gotten her papers, and had gotten\nSusie and -- and my father papers. He said, Monfred had said to me, \"You father will never\nuse them, but I don't want to have it on my conscious that he can't if he needs to, you know,\"\nand so as I left, you know, I said to them, \"Put Susannah in -- in there, you know, in that\nhole. Give her her papers. Make her pull the thing. And you to___, you know.\u201d All of\nyou. Go in there.\u201d And -- and, of course, they didn't, I mean. They didn't even use it. They\ndidn't use the papers. They didn't use -- they didn't go in the hole. They didn't do anything.\nAnyway, I went down -- down and it was a beautiful day. It was like this morning except\ncooler you know. Sunny, warm, June day in Holland. So beautiful. Little clouds and -- It's\nso easy to close a neighborhood off in Holland in Amsterdam because there are water\neverywhere. Right! All you have to do 1s stand on the bridges. Just stand on the bridges. You\ncan stop anybody. I didn't know where to go. I had no where to go. I didn't know the bridges\nwere closed off, so I went to the bridges. And I went to the first bridge and I saw there was\nsomebody standing in it. And then I remembered that there were people from ____ where I\nhad worked who had good hiding places, who were communists, you know, and who would\ncertainly hide a little blonde girl. Right? So I went there. And man, they were so angry. They\ntold me I'm stupid. I was endangering them. How would I dare come to a house, you know,\npeople might be watching me. I'm coming into a house -- nobody else is on the street and\nhere's this kid walking down the street and it's coming to their house, and they have to be\nsaved because they later on want to save Germany. Right? After the war, they want to make\ninto a great communist country. Or anyway they want to change Germany into something\ngood, and I was endangering them. And away with me! That was the end of my\ncommunisms if I ever had any. I'm telling you I didn't know what it was, but I -- right there,\nI knew that, you know, these people were no different from anybody else and it's dog eat dog\nand save yourself and, you know, I didn't think all of that right then. I just knew I had no\nplace to go. All of a sudden, loud speakers all over the place. \"All Jews had to prepare\nthemselves. Gentiles are not allowed in the streets.\u201d Loud and clear. All over. And I'm in the\nstreets. The only person in the street except for those damn people on the bridges. Right?\nThere were no trucks going yet, because they gave them an hour or something to get ready.\nSo I was the only one on the street. Of course, there were people in the windows, and they\nsaw me. Right? I was already out of my neighborhood, so it must probable that people who\nsaw didn't know who I was and and I'm walking along and I come to that -- to the first\nbridge, and there's two soldier, a green soldier, you know, and there is a black _-anspera_ on\nthat bridge. And I didn't know what to say, you know. And I go up there and I say and they\nsay, \"What the Hell are you doing.\u201d I mean I had -- there was nobody there. And I said,\n\"Well, I had come to that part of Amsterdam on the trolley in the morning to go swimming\nwith a girlfriend. We were going out far away and -- and anyway, I tell this long story and\nthey look and me and they say, \"Boy, you are lying because no trolley has come into this\nsection the entire morning.\u201d And I, of course, didn't know that. Trolleys start at six and I --\nSo they said, \"If we could get off this bridge, we'd take you to the police, but we're supposed\nto stand here and we're only ones on the bridge and we can't go anywhere, so -- \"They said,\n\"You better get away from here and go home. Go back to your girlfriend's house or\nsomething.\u201d So I went to the next bridge, and the next bridge I already know something you\nknow. I know. And I say, \"While I was staying over with a girlfriend overnight to -- to go\nswimming in the morning and now [I hear all this going on and I think my mother 1s going to\nbe very worried about me, and I better go back home and I -- I want to get home, and I have\nto go over there. And -- and he said, \"Like to make a date for you tonight, but right now, you\nknow, I can't get off the bridge and you can't go over there. It's against the rules and I can't --\nI can't do it.\u201d I'm getting very scared. I'm -- because it's only one more bridge that's not too\nfar before they come in with the trucks and I -- I thought what am I going to say? What am I\ngoing to say? And I couldn't think of anything to say. And I get to the bridge and there's one\nGerman soldier. Just a young, German soldier. And, again, this total surprise, you know.\nAnd he says,____\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014SSs Arn I'm ering. ____ 9 German, you know, and I'm crying\nand he gets all upset. You know, he's young. He thinks I am his sister no doubt. And he says\n___, Where is your mother? Where is she? AndI say_____\u2014CSCS<\u2018<2; PE \"Get\nover there. Hurry!\" That was it. Saved by life. Sunday, beautiful Sunday over there. People\ngoing to church. Quiet. Nothing going on. Two streets up nobody knows what's happening\none street further. I go to Monfred, not to my _passion because I'd said I'd be gone for several\ndays and I don't want to suddenly show you up, you know, on a day where there is a rausea\nin another place, you know. So I got to Monfred's house. They are sleeping. Now, you have\nto know that Monfred -- he says now, he's not tied in with anything. I don't know. He always\nknew. He always knew what was going in -- on, and he knew nothing. He knew nothing!\nThey had ways to get into closed off areas. Again, there were the leather coats and the\nGerman accents and the papers. They had everything. So they tried to get over there, to get\nmy parents, to get their friends. They couldn't. They couldn't get in. This time everything was\nclosed up. He couldn't believe it either. He just -- we tried everything. Just everything. Of\ncourse, the phones didn't work. I heard later that the Jews just came down the steps. They\njust came down the steps. And they just climbed on those wagons. They helped each other\nup there, and they sat and they were taken away. Now, you have to know that I had many\nfriends. I had a friend named Marie Austria, who was a photographer, my teacher --\nphotography teacher later on, and her sister _____ later on, and she lived on ___. She lived\nabout two of these stoops away from Ann Frank. And I had modeled for her. She's the one\nwho took all the pictures that you have -- the big ones. And she she decided -- she and her\nsister decided. This is big rausea. This is a mixed neighborhood. How do the -- this is\nSunday. How do they know who's where? Which door is what. It's not as if they come with a\nlist. They didn't come with a list. And so they had a hiding -- the same hiding place that we\nhad. You know, in the double wall behind -- with some -- well, I don't know what they had\nhiding that hole in the wall, but that's where they went. They went up. They never opened the\ndoor when they knocked on their door. They didn't open. And it was a big rausea, and they\ndidn't break any doors. They did nothing. They just passed that door up. Nobody opened the\ndoor. It might be people that are away on a trip. It's Sunday. They -- anyway, in the evening\nthey left. And they survived the war. I mean -- you know -- it's just -- there were other\ncircumstances that they survived the war and they had other dangers later on. But we're\ntalking about that moment of decision. That moment! That moment of decision. One little\nthing. One little thing. One decision made. I later heard of people -- actually friends of Marie\nAustria or a friend of Marie Austria, a woman who had been in Auschwitz and had lost most\nof her teeth, you know, and looked like Hell, and when the Germans left Auschwitz, they\nwalked the people. You have heard of that. and they walked them and many of them died\nbecause of the bombardments on the middle of the road, etc., like that. But she -- who was\nFrench. She was French. And she at one corner where all the Germans said, \"And now to the\nright,\" she went to the left. And she survived the war. She came home. Back to France. She\nfound her husband who really -- that was really a story. I mean I'm getting off the track here.",
        "Q: Let's -- Let's come back to you. Okay?",
        "A: Yal. Yal.",
        "Q: June \u201843, what did you do?",
        "A: Anyway, June 20th, so I went -- I went, after a few days, you know, I went back to my\npaission. I stayed with Monfred and his mother and his sister and her fiance. They all lived\ntogether in a -- how had they found the place where they were going to survive the war in 91\nValarstraats in Amsterdam. Monfred's sister, Marga, whose picture you have was a very\ninventive and a very intelligent, very bright young woman. She was -- I don't -- I imagine she\nwas three years or two years older than I was, maybe four. I'm not sure. But she had always\nsort of helped support with sewing. She was a genius in -- in clothing design and\nmanufacturing. And she always was much more practical. She wasn't at all a girl who went\nto school or anything, but she always had her hand in things. And she know how to get\nacquainted with people that were important. for her! For what she wanted! She saw an ad in\na paper for the upstairs of a house in the Valarstraat with a family of Anespairs -- actually\nDutch fascists. And she went there. And she said, \"We would like that. We would very much\nlike that and the apartment, and there will be various number of people because all of us\ntravel. We work for the German for the Wehrmacht and we do this and we do that -- you\nknow, speaking German very well. And this was a Dutch woman who could not speak\nGerman very well. Her husband was an Anespair and -- and she and her son were living\ndown stairs while the guy worked for the Germans somewhere in Germany. And that's how\nthey got that first apartment. So it was a pretty safe place to work -- live if you didn't give it\naway. If not something, you know, you couldn't have assemblies there. You couldn't -- you\nknow, you had to take into account what kind of place it was, but all of us, nearly all of us --\nof this particular group were not hidden away like Ann Frank was where you couldn't move.\nI mean we all were on the streets. It was dangerous, very dangerous. I mean I was well\nknown in Amsterdam. My family was well known in Amsterdam. It's a small town, you\nknow. It's not like now, millions of people. You -- you were very well known in your\nneighborhood. And I wasn't in the exact same neighborhood. I was still in Amsterdam south,\nbut it was the old south, rather than the new south. And I was not as well known there,\nexcept by a few people. So the way they made your papers, your false papers -- they gave\nyou the same first name that you really had. So if somebody would suddenly see you and\nyell, \"Hey, Barbara,\" 1t would be okay. You don't call each by the last name so you know --\nso-- That's my paper -- my name always was Barbara, which was very helpful. So that was\nwhy I went to see Monfred that night when we after -- or that morning after my parents were\ntaken. Anyway, I heard that they were all taken away, and they -- again, they tried to get free\nwith these papers, but the papers were now null and void. It was pass the period that these\npapers would do anything for anybody. And they were sent to Westerborg, which is the\nassembly camp. In the -- in the assembly camp was already my cousin Heinz. I've told you\nabout him and his wife. My cousin Heintz was hidden through the Dutch underground --\nsome kind of channel. The way -- the way it seemed to have happened was all through\nindividuals. You knew somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody. There wasn't a\ngreat big organization where people all knew each other. It was one person knew another\nknew another knew another. The less you knew the better, because if you get caught you can\ngive away maybe one person. Maybe! If you were not tough as nails. And this is what\nhappened with my aunt and uncle. They -- rather my cousin. They were hidden by a -- a\nDutch family, and it so happened that the son of that Dutch family also did other things.\nMost people who hid people were not allowed to do anything else, but they, of course, didn't\nknow about their son who was receiving weapons which were dropped by the British in\nHolland for the resistance -- to be used by the resistance in the middle of the night -- .planes\nthat flew low, you know, whatever it was. And he he was given away by somebody and they\ncame to that house and they took -- they took the men. Just the men. Not my cousin, my\ncousin Ava. They didn't take her or the wife. And Ava was immediately put somewhere else.\nBut Heinz was caught and he was then sent to Westerborg as a Jew. The -- This other person\n-- the Gentile survived the war which was a miracle, but he had somebody who got him out\nin somewhere.",
        "Q: Let's come back to you.",
        "A: To me. Okay. Well, my Uncle Heintz -- my cousin Heintz was already in -- in Westerborg,\nand he, of course, he saw his mother. He saw my mother. He saw my father. He saw my\nsister. He saw my grandmother. All going through there! And Heintz did survive the war in\nWesterborg. There were very, very few people who did. There were -- I think there were 300\nat the end. And he was one of them who survived. And they actually kept him in the camp\nfor a little while just to make sure he didn't happen to be -- because of his German, again, his\nGerman business. But he wasn't a German who was trying to hide as a Jew -- in a Jewish\ncamp, which happened a heck of a lot. I mean, any -- later on, it was the Germans who were\ntrying to save their lives and -- and hide and -- and try to stay alive. What about me? During\nthe war, I must say that most of the war really spent standing in line for food. Because of the\nway I looked I could do that. And we had -- we hid a lot of people. And that really was --\nafter reading the book, I realize that it was true, that what the little groups did was try to help\nthemselves and each other staying alive. It was less a big picture, you know, that you -- that\nthe underground would attack something or somebody, although I guess that happened, but\nnot with us.",
        "Q: Tell us about you!",
        "A: About me?",
        "Q: I'm not interested 1n the book right now. Okay? I want to know about you and what you did.",
        "A: Okay. I stood in line for food. I also did a few other things. I was -- as -- as I say, they had to\nbe careful with me because I was pretty stupid. And I -- they put me to work -- they put me --\nI was a dancer. Right? And there was a ballet company in Amsterdan run by Evan Geeorg1,\n-- Evan Geeorgi who was a great dancer from somewhere in Germany, and Hamburg or\nHanover -- something like that, and she was put by the Germans tn into the Dutch\nlarge state theater to run the ballet company. I went into her ballet school and took classes\nand I was then asked to join the company. And I asked if -- the underground, \"Was it\nalright?\" \"Oh, Yes!\" Because you got fantastic papers when you went there -- into this\ncompany. Because the company traveled, you got papers to be out after curfew. And that\nway I could help shift people from one hiding place to another or like American soldiers --\nshot down people other people who were underground -- . And let me tell you how this was\ndone. There were no more trucks, taxis. And there were very few cars, because there was no\ngasoline for them to use. So what they had was people on bicycles pulling, you know, like in\nthird world countries, they would pull little wagons behind them. Some of them were\ncovered so that when it rained, which it does a lot in Holland, you know, people wouldn't get\nwet. And others were open. All sorts of various ways of transportation. And the few people\nthat I moved were moved in the middle of the night, you know, I mean after curfew. With\nthem being the bench and me sitting, you know, sitting like this bent over and me sitting on\ntop on -- on sitting on their backs with a rather short skirt and my very good papers, with\nmake-up on still from the ballet and when the Germans stuck their -- when the Dutch police\nstuck their head in there and saying, \"What is this?\" you know. Curfew is on -- you could -- I\nwould have a smile and papers. And I shifted a lot of people. That way! You know, from one\nhiding place that had gotten dangerous to another one which is new, hopefully better. And I\ndid little things like that. Also, Monfred would distribute the ___ which was the communist\nnewspaper. Marga was distributing the __ which was the regular -- the -- the other\nnewspaper. And I would be sent carrying bags of those with lettuce and tomatoes and carrots\non top. And, again, you know I would be -- I would be told, \"You bring this to a certain little\nportal with and just somebody will come and get it.\u201d I didn't know who was going to get it. I\ndidn't know when they were there. If they were there before me or after me. I -- you know, I\nwould go. I would watch the portal and if I saw somebody go into a specific corner of it, and\nnot ring the bell or -- or, you know, whatever it was that I thought these were the right\npeople, I would walk up with the bag. And if they took it, they were the right people. If they\ndidn't, I would walk on. Little things like that. I also Marga's fiance -- we were constantly\nshort of money of course. That was a big problem. And Monfred in his letter to me just now\nsaid that some money we had because some more jewelry of my -- they had a lot of jewelry\nthat was being sold and I had little pieces left that I could sell. It was sold to Dutch people\nwho, you know, wanted it as an investment. And the money was used for us to eat and -- and\nlive, rent and stuff like that. Later on Leo Vial would transport Dutch workers to France. We\ntried to mix-up people, because the Germans were taking all the young people to Germany to\nwork in those factories, not particularly in concentration camps, just in factories while their\nown people went to the various fronts. And we would mix-up these. We would have\nFrenchmen in Holland, and Dutchman -- and when the Germans would find them, the\nFrench would say, \"We were sent here to work in -- in Holland and for the Dutch -- for the\nGerman industry,\" And the Dutchman in France would say, \"But we were shipped here by\nthe Germans to work for the for the French industry.\u201d I mean it was a total mix-up. Some\npeople also would be sent, if we were lucky, would be sent through France and Spain into\nPortugal and would then join the Dutch Free Forces on the British 8th Brigade in England if\none would be able to get there. But our Leo only took them to France. Well, on his way\nhome he would often bring suitcases full of lipsticks and , you know, all these\nwonderful French things that you couldn't get. And perfumes and other things that the\nFrench and that Holland didn't have. And then me, I would be sent to sell them. And I would\ngo to -- he even wrote the addresses down where I would go to sell them downtown in\nAmsterdam. And people would buy them like crazy. I mean I didn't -- I sold them wholesale.\nI sold the whole suitcase full all at once, and we would eat. And one time I came home and I\nsaw the Dutch police all over the place, watching -- in our house. Well, I knew enough,\nThank God, not to go home. So I stood on the corner watching til they came back out and --\nand they had made a mistake. Of course, they didn't. I don't know what Monfred did, but he\ngot rid of them. And -- I mean there -- there were always -- always these horrible moments,\nyou know, where you think, \"Now, this 1s it. This is it.\u201d And also one time I drove -- rode my\nbike up a one-way street the wrong way. I..I was really confused. It was downtown and there\nwas a lot of traffic. And I got stopped. And, of course, they looked at my papers. By that\ntime, I had much better papers. Now, with the dancing, that ended because somebody told\nEvan that I was Jewish. Now she was supposedly pro-Hitler and pro this and pro that, but\nshe knew that I was Jewish and she never did anything about it. Never! She called -- did call\nme in and she said, \"It would be better if you had a little more training before you go on\nfurther trips.\u201d\u2019 She put that very well. She never said, you know, \"I put you into this company\nbecause you were so good and what the Hell have you done to me?\" She said exactly what I\ntold you. She said, \"A little more training would be good for you, so just go to school.\u201d So\nthat she -- you know, wouldn't be endangered and I would be must less endangered. And the\nstrange thing was that she had been told by people who were actually watching out for me.\nWas a different group of people. It was Maria Austria and her friend, ___\u2014_\u2014, who are all in\nthe book who thought it was much too dangerous for me to do what I did, and who didn't\nwant me to do it. And I wouldn't listen. And so that's how they did it. They went and they\ntold Yvonne Geoorgi about that. So I have -- I have a picture of Yvonne Geeorg1 which\nshe had signed for me and -- and, you know, and I gave her her book and we -- we left. I\nnever did believe that was really a fascist. She was a artist who -- who maybe didn't have as\nmuch character as one was supposed to have, but she was a German and she was -- I don't\nknow. I -- who's going to throw the first stone. She didn't kill me. She was good to me.\nReally. And after the war, when all the artists marched -- you know in the -- in the -- what's\nthe big festival after we were liberated -- liberated? I was not allowed to march because I had\nworked for the German, you know, in the ballet, during -- Nobody ever said -- nobody ever\nsaid: But she did it because of the papers. The underground didn't say anything. Monfred\ndidn't say anything. Nobody -- I mean, Monfred probably didn't think it was very important.\nI thought it was terrible! I should have been able to march with the others and, anyway, this\nis after war stuff. That's German -- Dutch bureaucracy kicked in and -- and everything was --\nwas, you know, back to the way they thought life should be run.",
        "Q: Okay. We need to pause here and change tapes.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Okay. Now we go. You were going to tell us a little more\nabout your underground activities, particularly in smuggling packages?",
        "A: I didn't smuggle. I sent them by mail. The Germans would let you send packages to people in\nWesterborg, and I managed during the nine months that my parents were there -- I managed\nto send a lot of packages. And I was always collecting things, you know, as I went along.\nAnd, of course, we had ration coupons so it was hard, and I always got letters back. Actually,\nwe had mail from there. Regular mail -- .regular mail from my parents. And the mail I guess\nwas read, but it was sent on. And they received everything I sent. Nothing was dis -- had\ndisappeared. I also want to say that, you know, when they were taken away that I never knew\nthat they were in Auschwitz. I didn't know where they had gone. I heard they had been sent\non, and that was it. And it now appears that it was in January of \u201844. And it was -- it was a\nterrible shock. It was just really incredible shock. And I also want to say that I think I\nsurvived because I was 17 or you know, by that time 19. It's the sort and it was exciting, you\nknow, this living alone and not knowing -- everyday it was something else, and not knowing\nwhat was going to happen. The drudgery, you know, of trying to get food and of survival and\n-- Okay. At 19 they felt I was getting old enough to do some other things also. You know,\nsince I couldn't be in the ballet anymore, I had to be good for something. And besides\nstanding in line for food, which was hard in the winter in the rain and in the cold I can tell\nyou. We took care of a lot of other people who were underground who could not be out. I\nmean from the point of view of -- I didn't particularly see these people, but I had to supply\nfood, you know, get food for them. Somebody made me or helped me -- I forgot how, but I\nrented an apartment. Was the same apartment with the same street, the 91, you know, where\nwe had been before. This was now an 86. was on the second floor of 80 -- number 86 in the\nValarastratt. We might have just heard that it was coming free, you know, because we were\nright there in the neighborhood. Anyway, it was rented under my name my false name, of\ncourse. And then a very difficult time started. Very difficult! First of all, we went into the\nhunger winter. You know the time that the south was liberated, south being Braba -- north\nBraba, and all those. And that only did provinces around were still occupied and\n____s was coming up along the Rhine and we were stuck in that area. Not only us, but also\nthe Germans. They couldn't get out. And this was the first time that they also had less food.\nThey started to be hungry. And we started -- they started to be scared of the underground\nwho had all the weapons -- had so many weapons. And they had weapons, but they were\nmostly old men and kids, you know, and it was just a very, very scary situation. And during\nthat time I had the apartment and apartment had big windows. And I met the neighbors from\nacross the street, and they were telling me that the people downstairs would go upstairs to\nour apartment when we were out and steal the food out of the closet. Well, that was one\nthing. But we also were hiding people there. And that was another thing! Right? And the --\nimagine them running into these people. So we had hiding places. You know, we had closets\n-- what used to be closets, was now papered over and there was an entrance via the floor and\nthere was a rug that went up to it. And, of course, the people we hid knew how to get into\nthese closets. Of course, the Germans weren't stupid either and if something was going in --\non, you know, if they did have a rautsea,, if they did have a check into various apartments,\nthey would stick their bayonets into the walls and into the floors and, you know, looking for\npeople. And There was one guy which was assigned to our -- to my apartment where I lived\nwith Monfred and with various other people of the group whoever was around at the time.\nAnd this man was, I think, a Czech -- Czechish communist. And he would give lectures in\nour apartment and we weren't allowed to have more than three or four people, so this very\nscary, and I started to be very scared. And, first of all, I didn't like what he said and I said to\nMon, \"You know, I do not want this anymore. This is my apart -- you know, I hired under\nmy name and I would -- I'm responsible and it's dangerous. And these people, they will tell\non us. And Monfred said, It's nothing to be done. We have to have him.\u201d He also had to have\nhis wife on weekends. So she was hidden somewhere else. RIght? But on weekends, she\ncame to our place. And one day this -- this one woman and I who took care of the apartment\nwere told that the Germans were going to check into place, and in several in the\nneighborhood. So we had to move him. We had to move him. And we moved him at night\nsome -- to another apartment -- another place. And then we had to clean up to see that they\ndidn't see that there had been a man anywhere, because there was supposed to be two women\nliving in this apartment. So we started -- we went into his apartment -- into his room and he\nhad left everything. Cigars! First of all, how did he have cigars? Nobody had cigars. Apples!\nFoods! Cheese! We didn't give it to him. How did he get it? And when -- finally when all\nthis was over, you know, the Germans never did come to visit -- to us to check up, but when\nit was all over, I said to my friend, \"I do not want this guy.\u201d It's terrible. I mean he was a\nhoarder, somebody who hoarded things. We were supposed to share everything, you know.\nThis was very important. And he was a communist. He should know how to share. Anyway,\nhe -- I told Monfred, \"he has to go.\u201d And Monfred got very, very angry. They beat up on me\nbecause they were so angry that I would, you know, and I -- and they said, \"Well, what can\nyou do to us. You can't do anything anything to us.\u201d I said -- and I stupid -- my old stupid, I\nsaid, \"Yes, I can go to the police.\u201d Can you believe it? I was just impossibly stupid. I mean I\nwas so desperate. You know I thought we're all going to be caught. You know, we're all --\nand -- and I'll never forget that guy. It was awful, and his red headed wife. Impossible! So\nanyway, those are -- were some of the adventures, you know, during the -- and, of course,\nthe Americans -- New Year's Eve -- American soldiers, who had to be hidden, you know,\nfrom -- they would be shot down by the Germans over -- the -- the -- the planes would come\nflying. They were full of bombs, you know. And on the way home, he might have a bomb\nleft. And they would drop a bomb. They would just drop the bomb -- the -- the Americans.\nSo sometimes the Germans got one of those planes, and we got somebody to hide -- English,\nAmerican, whatever. New Year's Eve, the American went on the roof and shot off his gun. I\nmean I'm sorry. Ohhhh! So -- uh -- then the -- the hunger got so great that the -- and we got\nto the end -- toward the end, you know, the Germans knew -- toward the end. And they let\nthe Red Cross drop food in Amsterdam -- in and around Amsterdam. And the Red Cross --\nwe had flat roofs. You know, the roofs in Amsterdam behind the decorations are flat. So they\ndropped cases of food on the roofs or in the parks or in open space, and the Germans were so\nscared by that time they didn't dare to pick them up. And the underground and -- I -- the food\nwas distributed evenly, you know. You had to give whatever -- if you found one on your\nroof, you know, you better take it. And we were all starving. We were really -- the bread was\n-- had gone sour. We ate everything, you know, that -- that they dropped. And then the -- we\nheard that the Canadians were coming to liberate us. I haven't told you about Akmier.",
        "Q: I'd like you to go back and tell us about Akmier.",
        "A: Okay. Well, toward the end of the war, I kept hearing about a man man Almier who was a\nGerman, and who did fantastic things for the underground, the Dutch underground. And\nMonfred said one day that Akmier's place of hiding was not very good and Akmier should,\nperhaps, if it was alright -- it was my apartment -- right? -- Akmier should come to us. Well,\nAkmier came to visit -- to see if that was alright. Well we also arranged a girl for him to\ncome that he might like. We wanted him to come because it was dangerous for him. We\ndidn't want him to get into trouble. Now it turned out that -- that he was -- he really had to\nstay where he was he felt for a little while. And the underground came to him to Monfred\nand said you have to get him out of there because if he is -- when we get liberated, if he is\nwhere he is now, we might have to send him back to Germany or anyway he'll be in deep\ntrouble. And so they sent me to get him. And I went over there I said you have to come and\nstay us and you have to come. You have to come. So Akmier came. And then I heard his\nwhole story. He -- he was a German -- was involved in a Munich story where the six people\nwere hanged. Six students -- they turned over a whole suitcase full of pamphlets on -- on an\nassembly in -- of Munich University full of anti-Hitler propaganda. And in one -- of course,\nthey all got caught. I mean it was very early on and nobody knew what to do. So -- so in one\nof their books was his name? -- in one of his -- the notebooks, address books was his name,\nand somehow they managed to get him out of Germany. He had just finished his medical\nstudies and he was sent to Villemina Hot Towers in Amsterdam, which is a mental\ninstitution and hospital in Amsterdam, and he was supposed to study further psychiatry. He\nwanted to go into psychiatry. So he studied there and worked there, and he started working\nwith the underground. And he -- he's the one -- one of the people who supplied us with all\nthe serums -- of in..inoculations, of all the diseases you caught during the war. He got us a\npiece of soap once in awhile. He he helped people. He moved people from one place to -- he\ndid a whole lot probably that I don't even know about. And then the Germans shifted him to\nFrance because there were big battles going on in France, and they needed psychiatrists --\nsome people to help. And in France and once -- once he got there, the situation was so\ndisastrous that he was supposed to tell the soldiers 1t was worthwhile fighting for Germany.\nIt was worthwhile fighting. And he saw -- he couldn't do that It was idiotic. It was\nridiculous to fight. And one of the lucky things, then -- more or less, lucky -- was terrible for\nhim -- was that they needed surgeons worse than they needed psychiatrists in the end you\nknow. And he was made to work sewing up these left over pieces of flesh and he absolutely\nlost his mind. He just couldn't. That was not his nature. He couldn't stand -- stand it. And so\ntoward V-J day, he had a little Fiat -- little thing, you know, that they had the one -- for one\nperson like bug, they used to call little bug, and he got in it and he -- he rode. He got to\nBelgium ___ and there were Germans there and they painted big white zeros, circles on --\non all the cars that went through. So Akmier said to himself that doesn't look too good, you\nknow, why should I have a mark like that on my car. And he went to the next town and he\nwashed off the zero -- the -- the -- and he drove on and he heard shooting and he saw a whole\nlot of cars with big white zeros and there were men and women standing up against the cars\nbeing shot, one after the other. Deserters. Shooting the deserters! He didn't have a zero on his\ncar, and he made to Holland. And in Holland, he called the underground and the\nunderground -- the car had broken down so he had to walk a little bit. And in Holland the --\nthe underground brought him a suit, took his and buried it -- his uniform and buried it, and\ntook him to Amsterdam and hid him. And Akmier did a little bit of work, but not too much\nthen because he could -- what could he do, you know. He was, himself, endangered. And --\nand then after the wa, Akmier stayed in Holland. He got this -- you know, the Queen said he\nwas a guy and he could stay -- a good German, and he was -- he was really very marvelous.\nBut he had a lot of damage done to his physic during the war, and he never, you know, he\njust -- he was a psychiatrist and just -- just by himself you know. He didn't -- he worked as a\npsychiatrist, but not -- he doesn't share. He doesn't -- I often I always asked him, you know,\n\"Don't you share with others? Don't you discuss your cases with others, don't you?\" \u201cUh-\nhuh.\u201d Nothing. Nothing. Just sit. And",
        "Q: You and Akmier became involved.",
        "A: We became very involved, but in the end I decided to come to the States anyway. No, I -- I\nwanted children and Akmier did not want children. He said, \"This is not a world\" -- this is\none of the things that was done to him. I mean, what happened to him. He couldn't get passed\nit, shall we say. He said this is not a world for -- for any children. And he ended up marrying\na woman who already had a child and couldn't have anymore. I mean he really looked for\nsomebody like that and he found somebody who was divorced and had the kind of blood\ndisease that she couldn't have any more children then. He -- he -- it was terrible. It really was\nso sad. And he -- he had such talent. You know, he played the violin, and he was very well\neducated. His father was an incredible person. His father -- there were three sons. Now let\nme just say that because you have to hear something good about Germans. ______ His father\nwas the headmaster of a school and when this all came about and Hitler came up -- his father\ncalled his three sons and he said, \"There's only one God.\u201d They were all Catholic. \"There's\nonly one God and he 1s not on this earth. And there is only one law, and it's God's law.\u201d\nThat's what his father said. And all the boys were terrific. I mean two of them did go to the\nfront, but they all survived. But I mean there are people like that. And he lost his job. The\nfather was thrown out. Right? But they needed teachers so bad, he ended up teaching, just\nplain old teaching then.",
        "Q: Come back to you. The war's end is approaching.",
        "A: The war's ending. The war's ending, and people are showing up. People come popping out of\nthe woodwork. My cousin, Ava comes back. She says, \"Here I am.\u201d And she told me they\nwere all -- my cousins -- you know, I started learning who was alive and who was dead.",
        "Q: Tell us -- tell us about the day of liberation?",
        "A: Well, you know that was a day -- we knew -- there was a terrible thing that happened at the\nlast. You might have already have heard about that where the underground had been able to\nabsolutely -- and was not able to do anything because it -- you know -- it -- and they were so\nfrustrated. I mean they did do things like shoot a soldier -- shoot -- shoot somebody, you\nknow, or -- or blow up some trains. I -- I guess they did some things like that, you know. But\nthey had all these weapons. And they hadn't been able to get their hands on the Germans, and\nthey really wanted that. And in Amsterdam, you know, we knew the -- the Canadians were\ncoming and -- and everybody went downtown to the Dom, which 1s the big place in front of\nthe town. And on the Dam also was the German officer's Club, right -- I mean the Palace of\nthe Queen is, shall we say, to the north and officer's club just a little street apart, maybe 10\nfeet, 12 feet. There was the German Officers Club. And who was in this club? Old guys and\nboys of 15! I mean really the Germans had nobody left that, so the -- some how somebody\nhad a big shotgun tn -- in the Palace -- the underground had a big shotgun and shot into the\nclub. And, of course, the Germans then had to fight and I think since there were so many\npeople standing right there in the Dom, I think 147 people died -- and -- and I -- many\nGermans died. I mean it was totally useless. It was one of those things that happened in total\nconfusion and fear on both sides, fear and loathing on both sides, and just a horrible, stupid,\nawful thing. Well, during that period we were getting sort of ready. You knew you could\nalready go on the streets. You knew you didn't have to be as afraid. And they were coming.\nAnd they did come. They came. And I remember looking at the trucks coming and full of\nthese healthy pink and blond and blue and black-eyed guys. I -- I thought our -- our guys\nwere great looking, you know. I'd never seen so much flesh. I mean it was incredible. And,\nof course, we went out there and screamed. We just screamed. And all my dance buddies,\nyou know, my ballet -- my friends, they all -- I heard all of them -- they all had boyfriends.\nThey all got boyfriends, and this and that. I, of course, had a friend and I did not. I had\nalways been scared to death of any kind of soldiers, so I never had anything to do with any\nkind of soldier. Anyway, gun carrying, uniformed person. It was awful. It was -- I mean it\nwas wonderful. It was heavenly, and it was scary. Very, very scary! Because I didn't really\nknow where I belonged then, you know. I knew I had -- I had immediately withdrawn\nbecause I got into the ballet. The ballet 1945 was started right then. It had already been\nstarted for a whole month before that, and we had rehearsed to get ready for -- for the ballet.\nBut then it really started and I started to work nearly immediately after the war was over in\nthe Ballet 1945. Then later we came to the States, Ballet Company, ________ grew out of that.\nAnd then they had a festival, a wonderful festival. And, of course, there were no lights.\nThere was not yet any electricity. By that time we had to go down and get water to the third\nfloor in buckets between three and five, you get -- got assigned periods where you get water\nin buckets and we were pretty starved. I mean during that we ate from the fox kitchen. We\nate bulbs flower bulbs, soup made out of flower bulbs and we ate -- well, whatever the soup\nkitchen came up with, that's what we ate. You know, you had three little pots and one of you\nhad to go and get it. And the amazing thing was that the formerly poor people complained\nmuch more than the people who formerly had money. It was very, very funny. And the\narticles in the paper were a riot. But hunger was not funny. And we would go up and get up\nin the morning and have -- have a ship's cracker, you know, one of these hard tack things,\nand we haven't -- hadn't had any butter or fat for so long that we were freezing to death. I\nwas always cold. I was -- and this is still one of my greatest fear. I can stand hunger better\nthan cold. It was terribly cold. We would take -- there was six of us or seven of us in the\napartment -- we would go all in one bed and put everybody's blankets and mattresses on top\nof us and we still were cold, you know. And eat a hard tack before getting up, and then only\ncold water to wash with. And, of course, after -- right after -- oh, we had no coal to heat --\nheat the stove, which by the way was the only thing to cook on. Remember gas wasn't there\nanymore. So we got -- Monfred had a big __ he got a lot of peach from outside and -- and we\nbrought -- we had a whole room, small room, storage room full of peat. And we used the\npeat to -- to cook on the stove which was just a little heating, which also heated the room.\nAnd that peat was full of fleas and we had a flea plague on top of the cold and the hunger.\nAnd one night I caught 84 fleas. I killed 84 fleas. I mean we were covered, and actually we\ndidn't get rid of it til the Americans gave us some DDT, which was brand new then. I mean I\ndon't think there even. I mean it was just in total disaster. We were hungry, cold, and full of\nfleas by the end of the war. It was outrageous. And then there was this wonderful festival\nwhere they made fires everywhere and they had -- I don't know where they got lights, but at\nnight we had lights and boats were laid across the canals and you could walk from one side\nfrom one __ to the other just over -- over the boat. I was in love. And it was wonderful. It was\nthe most wonderful -- wonderful day in my -- I can ever remember. And I didn't think -- I\ndidn't let myself think about my parents and my -- for that one day. And then afterwards, I\nsaid, \"Now what? Now what?\" And then we started hearing that -- oh, they are lists. They\nare lists of people who were coming back, and your mother is on one of the lists. Well,\nMonfred said to me then, \"Don't believe it.\u201d And I -- I already hated him with a passion.\nRight? Because he had done all these horrible things. And he said, \"Don't believe it.\u201d And I\nsaid, \"I'm going to believe it.\u201d We then knew -- we knew about concentration camps. In \u201845.\nSo I started going to the train stations. And, of course, I stood there. When I had the time, I\nstood there and I stood there and I stood there. I asked -- and when I see these films, you\nknow, they are films made by the French. They were wonderful French films, but and -- and\nthey're these people going to -- other people coming out of trains, you know, and they have\ntheir shaved and they looked awful and there are these people coming back from camps and\nyou ask -- that's how it was -- and you asked, did you know so and so? Did you know so and\nson? No. No. No. Now I think that one of those people was somebody took my mother's\nname to get back to Holland. I'm sure of it. And recently somebody showed up with my\nsister's name. And, of course, when I started looking, she was gone. I mean there was\nnobody to find. And it's the same sort of thing and then I started waving goodbye to people. I\nhad girlfriends who met Americans and who married them. And I started seeing people who\nwere not good and women who were not good in the war. And I was waving goodbye to\nthem because they were marrying American soldiers. What do the American soldiers know?\nThey know nothing! And if they had known, what would it have mattered? They were in\nlove. You know, such 1s human nature.",
        "Q: We need to move. Can you tell me just tell me what, very briefly, what you did now and -- .",
        "A: Well, after the war, of course, I -- I worked for two years in the Ballet. I danced. That's how I\nmake money. And I started to realize that every time I got a job, they had to ask for a work\npermit because I was not a Dutch citizen. And it was a lot of work for them and bless them,\nthey did it. I mean I did not -- I thought I wouldn't have done it. I can get another girl, you\nknow. But I always had a job. And Akmier, of course, was working by that time, and so we\nmanaged. But when I decided -- a friend of my family Lotta Kalinaski, also from Berlin who\nwas -- 1S quite a well known psychiatrist here in the States I think -- .[ went for shock\ntreatments and things. And Lotta was looking for my parents. I had gone to my older\napartment -- our -- our apartment where I lived with my family and had told the woman there\nwhere I was living and to please forward any mail that she would get and to please let me\nlook in the hiding places that we had around the house. And, of course, she'd found the\nhiding places. There was nothing there. And then the woman below us, who was a fascist\nduring the war, she said, \"I saw you got on -- you know, it was dangerous for her --\ndangerous period for her. She might have been shipped to Germany or killed by the\nwhere all the Dutch wanted to take revenge on their people -- and she said, \"I didn't give you\naway when you ran away. You helped me.\u201d And I said, \"You were helped enough.\u201d Because\nshe had a lot of our stuff, and I didn't get anything back. So I -- I said, \"I won't give you\naway, just like you didn't give me away.\u201d And that was all I ever did for her. I didn't give her\naway. I said, \"If they catch on to you, that's not my fault. I don't -- you know, it's your.\u201d\nAnyway, I got a -- I got a lot of mail from all over the world, from Australia, from Canada,\nfrom America, from -- all -- all over the world where people had managed to escape to. And\none of the letters I got was from the Kanaski's and they asked me to come to the States. At\nthe time I was in the Ballet and I was with Akmier and I thought Akmier would get over the\nfact that he didn't want to have children, which I knew I had to have children. So I said to\nKanaski, let's wait. Let's wait. He said, \"I'll give you an affidavit and you come.\u201d And he\nkept coming by because he -- he went to Berlin to lecture. He helped set up the free\nuniversity of Berlin as psychiatry -- department of psychiatry there, and giving lectures. So\nhe came every year two or three times and he said, 'Now you must come.\u201d And made -- he\nsent me the affidavit and made me sign it, and by that time I thought it would be better and\nthat's how I came to the States. He was very -- they were very good to me -- very good to\nme. And I also have other family here. They were also good to me. So -- and I worked as a\nballet -- as a dancer. And that's it! Thank you.",

        "A: My name is Barbara Rodbell, currently. My maiden was Lederman.",
        "A: I was born in Berlin, Germany, September 4, 1925. My mother's name was Else Citroen\nCiton, which means lemon, and it is a Dutch name because her father was from Holland had\ncome from -- to Germany from Holland, and married my grandmother, Ellen Citreon\nSileppe. Her name was Sileppe in Berlin. And so that is how the Dutch family lived in Berlin\nbecause that's where they married. They were three children, the old\u2014 four children\nactually, the oldest died very -- at 18. She was a poet and a wonderfully, well loved child,\nand she had a brain tumor and died. It took a while year and my youngest uncle tells that he\nhas never seen his mother in anything but black ever after. So I saw her in other clothes, but\nhe never saw her in anything but black as he grew up. At least that's how he sees it. People\nsees things in different ways. My mother, I remember as a childhood, as being relatively\nhappy and her oldest brother was Paul, and he was lively and he was a painter. Didn't pay\nattention to anything but painting and art. And then she -- then it was she, and then it was a\nbrother, Hans who also survived the war. The -- they all -- the brothers survived the war.\nEach of them had their own story, but they all survived the war. We lived in Berlin, and I\nhad a sister, named Susannah who was three years younger than I was. And we -- my father\nwas a lawyer, born in Hisberg, Silesian, over Silesian, and in Germany and studied in\nVerslomberland, later in Geneva for his Ph.D. in law. And he had a good practice. And he\nwas quite old really. He was 35 when he married my mother. My mother was 20. That was\ndone that way, that way, in those days. Anyway, I was born a year later and I remember my\nchildhood in Berlin as being wonderful. It was -- my father loved Berlin, and we went all\nover Berlin as soon as I could walk. And he showed me absolutely everything. Every little\ncomer, and he liked history and music and we went to museums and I still remember where\nthe Rembrandt hung in this museum in Ber-- in Berlin because he loved it so. And I\nremember the trains from Casovillan trains, and the stories he told me about how Casovillan\nused to have big dinners in those trains, and he was a very faster easter, Casovillan was.\nNobody ever got anything to eat because he was always finished before the last person was\nserved and everybody had to leave very hungry. This was one of my father's story, stories.\nAnd my sister was born three years later, and we were very happy. We always went to\nHolland on vacation. And in 1933, when we went to Holland on vacation, one of my many\ncousins of my father's, Uncle Biet Pierson who was a journalist, a editor of a paper in The\nHague said to my mother he felt that she should not go back. This was 1933. And Uncle Biet\nhad, when he was very young -- when he was 19 and, and just learning to be a journalist, he\nhad been sent to Munich to cover a trial. And nobody in Holland paid in attention to this\ntrial. And when he came back and he wrote up his paper, they said to him, \"Why are you\nmaking such a fuss?\" And he said, \"You pay attention to this trial. This is going to end up\nbeing something quite awful and better everybody pay attention.\u201d It was Hitler's trial in\n1923. And he was, you know, he was the only of them paid any attention to it. Took 10 years\ntil things really heated up. So my mother, who always listened to my father because my\nfather was the older one and, you know, he was the leader in our family said to my father, \"I\nthink we shouldn't go back.\u201d And my father said, \"What does a lawyer do in a foreign\ncountry?\" That's not a very good idea, and what am I going to do?\" And she said, \"Well, I\ndon't know. You'll find something to do. It's -- I really think we should not go back.\u201d And so\nfather said, \"Well, I'm going to go back and see what I can do.\u201d I mean he had -- I think he\ngraduated he'd already been a lawyer for 25 years. I mean it was -- it was practically\nimpossible for him to start over. He spoke a few words of Dutch, but not very much. He got\nto Berlin and he went into his office and there were his secretaries and his assistants and\nstuff. There was also a big letter from the government, which said that from now on, he\ncould only have Jewish clients. My father had no -- had very few, I should say, Jewish\nclients. I didn't know any Jewish clients that he had. But he had things like the Mid-\nEuropean Watch Industry, a ___, Swiss Watch industry. He had big companies that were\nhis clients, and now he could not represent them anymore. He packed up. And we could still\n-- I mean he could ship as much as he wanted to Holland. And we had two grand pianos, and\nhe sold them because he didn't think that we could -- would have the money to have enough\nhouse or an apartment big enough to hold grand pianos so there was a big change in our\nstandard of living. I mean I was raised with nurses and governesses and with English and\nFrench and you have Dutch and all those various things, with horse back riding and good\nschools. And when we got to Holland, of course, we had a little apartment. My father had to\ngo back to school, to the -- to the university. He worked for a Dutch ____. He worked for a\nDutch lawyer, but he had to learn Dutch, of course. He handled the clients who were very\nmuch like him who had come to Holland and, you know, he couldn't practice along because\nhe didn't have the Dutch degree. So he went to the university, and I think he was now -- how\nold was he in \u201834, \u00b035? He graduated in three years in a foreign language. I was -- we were\nvery proud of him. It was very hard. He also worked at the same time. There was a big party\nand everybody came and then a few years later the Germans walked in, and it was all over.\nWe are now getting to the point where my -- Let me go back and say that when we got to\nHolland and I got to my first school, in my class was a girl named Margo Frank. And they\nlived right behind us on the ___. We lived at the _____\u2014\u2014_\u2014w which was the back of the\nsame kind of development that they lived in. And we -- we always played at ___. That's\nhow we met. And then our parents, of course, met, having coming from Germany the same\nyear and having a lot of common and the Frank's and my parents socialized a lot and, of\ncourse, the kids played. As a matter of fact, Margo dragged me through school. Without her,\nI would have never made anything done anything because I was full of play and I was --\nwanted to become a dancer and I worked very, very hard at that, but not at much else. So\nwithout her saying, \"Today, we study,\" I wouldn't have been able to get through. So here we\nare in school and working hard and my sister's doing very, very well. She was very smart.\nAnd my father had great hopes she'd become a lawyer like he was. He would've like me to\nbecome a lawyer, but I think he gave up on me long -- very early because that was not my\nthing. I was more the way my mother's family was. More playful and -- and liked imaginary\ngames and things like that. Let's see, where shall we go now?",
        "A: Well, of course, we all played together, you know. And Ann came to the house a lot and we\nwent to her house a lot. When my kids grew up, I -- I could see that, you know, the same\nkind of thing, you know. You -- you go around to the people in your neighborhood and you\nwork together for the schools and you do various things and My sister was a lot more\nserious than Ann was. Anne liked games the way I did. And she liked to play and have\nimagina -- imaginary games, and she was very high strung -- very easily upset, and -- . My\nsister tried to get along with all that, but it wasn't always easy. Ann was a very difficult\nchild, an extremely difficult child. And not just for her family, but in school and she went to\na special school, a Montessori kind of school I think or Dalton in one of those two kinds of\nschool. And she did very well there. Not as well as Margaret, who was an absolute genius, if\nyou ask me. But who -- Margaret also was very calm, and at least what I always saw of her\nwas very calm, very deliberate, very, very beautiful. Margaret was very beautiful. Had great\nbig brown eyes -- a very serious person. She would have made a real mark in the world. I\nknow that. Just like my sister. My sister -- .I can't even imagine how wonderful she would\nhave been. She was so smart and so sweet and -- and she was very anxious to be very close\nto me which was amazing, you know, for a young girl. She wanted to see what I was doing\nand later on, as I got older, she was very interested in my friends and she always had very --\na lot of good advice for me. This is no good, and this is very good, and you know, she was\njust -- and she was so sensible. It was amazing! One of the letters I gave you 1s from her, and\nthere you will see all that. It's a very good letter. Very, very young girl! Anyway, we had a\nnormal, very happy kind of childhood with a lot of music and my Uncle Paul was a painter\nand a Dutchman, a Dutch painter, with a enormous German accent, but his nationality was\nDutch. He was born in Berlin, but at 18 he had to choose whether he wanted to be German or\nDutch because he was born in Germany but -- but he had a Dutch passport because of his\nfather. And something in him made him make the right choice and he chose Holland and he\nwent to Holland and -- and lived there even since, and became quite a well known painter\nand had a very happy life in -- in Holland. Married a beautiful woman, had a daughter, and I\nhave two very close relatives about my same age. One is his daughter, Paulinka, and one is\nthe daughter of my Uncle Hans, the younger brother of my mother who is Tamara and she 1s\nin Israel. She lives in Israel with her family. And now why was I telling you all this?",
        "A: Family and friends. Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Well",
        "A: Well, these were -- these were mostly -- mostly, because on some of those pictures are also a\nlot of Dutch kids who were playing also who only were living in the same neighborhood. By\nthe neighborhood was entirely mixed. Wasn't all Jewish. Was a completely mixed\nneighborhood. And as far as I knew the Dutch Jews and the Germans Jews got along very\nwell. And I have just read a book which said that they were really pretty separate when it\ncame to it..you know when things got tight. But I personally have never -- have never\nexperienced that. And when I got to think about it not until I got in with a group of young\npeople who were stridently trying to survive was it really all German? -- at that point I\nrealize it was all German. It wasn't really my family that created that kind of atmosphere, but\nit was more when we were on our own, without family, you know, that it suddenly appeared\nthat I really was in a German Jewish circle. This was when we were trying to save ourselves,\nyou understand? As -- as children we played altogether -- everybody played together and\nwas very good relationships between everybody. I've never heard my parents or Otto Frank,\nwho by the way was an absolute angel, ever, you know, say anything nasty or have -- had\nany kind of problem with Dutch with the Dutch people. And, of course, I was half Dutch\nanyway. And the first time I realized I really wasn't Dutch was when the Germans came to\nHolland and there was five days where -- before -- before the Queen left Holland, while the\nGermans were there -- while the Dutch were fighting the Germans we were not allowed --\nwe had a great curfew. We were not allowed in the streets. And my grandparents and my\nneighbors had to bring -- my grandmother and my neighbor had to bring us food and\neverything because they wouldn't allow Germans -- we were then taken as Germans, not --\nnot as German Jews, but as Germans, and we weren't allowed to go out and to buy food\nexcept very limited periods of time during the day. It was the first time that I realized that\n\"Hey. Hey. I'm really German. I'm not really Dutch.\u201d I never, you know, it -- I wasn't even\naware of it, except when I came from Berlin and I went to school. I was in the -- I was in the\n3rd Grade. I was put into the 3rd Grade. I was eight years old. And I had to write what they\ncalledin____\u2014\u2014\u2014sw which write, you know, somebody reads something to you and you write\nit down. I had 40 mistakes I think in -- in 30 words, or something like that because I couldn't.\nI think even Margo had 25 mistakes, but still it was a lot less than I had. That was -- you\nknow, there I realized, you know, that it..that 1t was hard. And my clothes were all wrong.\nBecause Berlin was very -- we were very elegant in Berlin, you know. I had fur coats and a\nhat -- you know, ridiculous really if you think about it now, it's -- but that's how it was in\nthose days. In Holland, the kids were pretty much more still more ____, more plain, even in\nAmsterdam. And the clothes I had were absolutely inappropriate. So at some point there, I\nsaid to my mother, \"This is 1t. That coat goes.\" I had a Russian -- I had Russian\ncoat which was embroidered with a Russian hat, you know, with the embroidery around and\nstuff and I said, \"Never am I going to wear this thing again.\u201d \"You give it away to somebody\nin Germany.\u201d I mean I -- I -- it was too embarrassing. Nobody wore clothes that. So I had to\nget used to, you know, a lot of things like that. But I had lot more freedom than I had in\nBerlin. I mean Berlin was a big city and playing out in the street was impossible. And it -- it -\n- it was a very different life. It was a certain kind of freedom and relaxation. I didn't have a\nnurse or a governess with me all the time. I could go, you know -- I wasn't supposed to, but I\ngo more or less where I wanted to. And it was a more relaxed life. It was very hard for my\nmother, although I didn't hear her ever complain. And my -- I have a cousin who came to\nvisit the other day from Holland and she's much younger. She was much younger than my\nmother, and she said that my mother never complained. Never! Never! And -- my mother -- I\nmean she'd had a -- a cook, a cleaning woman, a maid, a nurse for governess for us. You\nknow, she never had anything like that to do. She did that social work. That's what people\ndid. And of course, not for pay. I mean she did social work and now she had to learn to cook.\nMy mother never knew had to cook. So she -- her mother was there. My -- my grandmother\nhad gone to Holland before my -- my -- my parents and she taught my mother how to cook\nbecause my mother didn't know how. And she -- she had -- I think she had some help every\nday for a few hours, but that was -- I mean for her, 1t must have been an enormous change.\nAn apartment, it had two stories but it was still a relatively small apartment compared to\nwhat she used to have and -- Of course, she was surrounded by family which she had not --\nnever had her own family. She had a lot of my father's family, but never much of her own.\nAnd here it was very different. And because the family was Dutch, of course, we slid very\nfast into the Dutch way of life and aside from my father and my mother and for the children,\nit was very nice. So I loved it in -- in Holland.",
        "A: Well, we had -- I think we had a -- I don't remember now exactly, but my cousin she's now\ncalled Tamera Cidor, but her name was Dolly Citreon . And -- and she was visiting and we\ntook her over to other family of ours who lived also on the _____\u2014\u2014_, who _ lived downstairs\nso they had a garden. And they had also a little baby or a brother. She was now | years old.\nHanna too -- Hanna was her name. And we went over there to play, so there was my --\nmyself, my sister, Dolly, my cousin, and Hanna, Tobby, and we were a family. And then\nHanna ____ and Ann Frank also came because they were friends of my sisters. So we\nwere all playing there in the garden. And then my mother came and said, \"I'm going to take -\n- let me take a picture of all of you because we're together here.\u201d And she took what is now\nknown as the sandbox picture. And Ann is in there. Then later on she says, \"Well now -- no -\n- only the family.\u201d Oh, the poor kids -- I can hear it. So..uh Ann and Hanna -- Hanna --\n.Hanna went away and we put the baby between us on -- at the -- on the table, and you have\nthat picture. She took that picture. On the second tape that you have, there is the mother of\nHanna, now of course much older, and she said she took the picture. I was so surprised. I\ncouldn't believe it. My mother took the picture. It's in my album and it's a long time ago.\nEven so, one could confused.",
        "A: Yai.",
        "A: Yal.",
        "A: Well, to my great surprise it seems they were much closer than -- than I had thought because\nagain this cousin from Holland who came to visit recently and who told that my mother was\n-- was never complaining and working very hard and really wasn't very strong, she was\ntelling me that my sister, Susannah, used to bring Anna -- Ann Frank with her every time\nthey came to visit. And they would visit in -- in The Hague, and they would visit in Glebare,\nwhere they had a little summer house, and they would stay for weeks and she describes on\nthe tape, which by the way, I do have but I didn't bring with me she describes how difficult\nAnna was. And she says how -- now they were older then. I think -- let me see -- I'm -- I was\n16 so my sister was 13, and Anna was maybe 12 at that time. So this is a later period that we\nare actually talking about now. And she describes that Anna was so very much more\ndeveloped than my sister. Although my sister was only a year older, and how her interests\nwere so very difficult and how difficult it was to keep her calm and interested and\nuncomplaining and -- and just regular you know. It's a very cute tape actually that little piece\nof it about Ann. It -- 1t was amazing to -- to most people, you know. I mean the book is, but -\n- but I could see a little bit of that I could see that she was thinking about many things. She\nthought about boys way before Susie ever dreamed of boys. And -- and she -- she would tell\nme that Susie is really very childish. Susie would say to me, \"Ann 1s just silly. Always with\nthese boys. Who watches that,\" she says. You know, she didn't want to play. So that's why I\nwas surprised when I heard that at the very end even Ann would go with Susie visiting of --\nour family and stuff. Yal. The families were very close. I mean it was due to the fact that it\ngot -- .they're at the time and they were in the same same age more or less. The children\nwere the same age. The interests were a lot alike. My father was a lawyer and -- and Otto, of\ncourse, had a business. I don't know if my father worked for him or anything or if he did any\nof his work, but I'm sure he helped him if there were any problems. So there were a lot of -- a\nlot of reasons that our families were close. One forgets, you know. One forgets how -- how\nlogical these things develop. There's nothing special. On that other tape that I gave you,\nBarry Spaanyard keeps asking the mother of Hanna -- Hanna's mother -- keeps saying, \"Now\nhow come you didn't know Anna so well? Anna's family. How come you didn't know the\nFrank's so well? Or how come you didn't -- \" And she finally gets impatient with him and\nshe said, \"Well, we were families with the Ledermann's and it was just through them that\nAnna Frank came to play with us.\u201d They were not that friendly. I mean it's just -- why should\nbe friend -- nobody is friendly with everybody. So there was no special reason or dislike or\nlike or anything. You know, people know each other or they don't know each other. So that's\nwas it.",
        "A: Uh Well, I said already, you know, how fantastic Otto was. He was wonderful with children.\nHe was just incredible with children. He was patient. He was loving. He was everything you\nsort of wanted somebody -- he was also patient with this whole situation -- with the fact that\nhe had to leave all of a sudden. I'm sure they came from the kind of background we did --\nand they were reduced to what we were. I think they would probably this was very much the\nsame. It was very much the same. He was very patient with it, and he worked very hard in\nhis business, and he did well for the short time, you know, that -- that he had it. And now the\nmother -- I don't have that much of an impression of her. I can see her. And, again, I see this\nbeautiful woman. I mean the eyes, and the hair, and just a beautiful woman. And, of course,\nI'm looking at her now not the way a child would. You know, I'm looking at her from my\npoint of view now. And I realize what in the world she went through. I mean for a woman --\nshe came from the way my mother was -- had been and -- and she didn't have the the ____.\nShe had to stay in the house with children and deal with every day things -- her own\nshopping, doing her grocery, her own cooking, her own -- It was very different from the\nway she was brought up. Anyway, she was not as patient. She didn't have the patience for\nAnn who was really extremely difficult. I mean I wasn't easy at all, but Ann was impossible\npractically. I mean she was she was difficult. And -- and -- Edith did not have that -- .the\npatience for her. She did what she could. She was not a nasty mother or an angry mother or\nhitting mother or anything. She would -- she did what she could and Ann was very luck to\nhave Otto and -- and to calm the waters between her and her mother. So it was a happy\nfamily really. And Otto had to work hard to keep Edith happy and to .to keep everything\ngoing. And, of course, Margaret did her best. She was more like her father. And it was a\nhappy family. And we saw a lot of them. All the time! I just read a book, which I gave to\nyou. The one on the ______ and in the book, it tells something about Edith, and that's it's the\nmost amazing thing. They interviewed -- the people who wrote the book, the writers,\ninterviewed two women who had been saved from -- in Auschwitz -- from Auschwitz. And\nwhat had happened was, of course, they got ill like everybody else. I don't know if it was\ntyphoid or diphtheria or one of those horrible diseases, and she said there were two women\nwho didn't give a hoot about what -- whether they would be punished or not punished or\nwhatever they did, and they were very strong. And they knew that that one of the barracks in\nAuschwitz -- that everybody had already been sent away. And they put these two girls in\nthose empty barracks, and they stole food and they gave -- fed them, and they took care of\nthem, and they survived because of these two women. And one of them was Edith Frank.\nAnd I don't think that..that there's anybody who knew about that, because I had never heard\nanything like it. And I wonder if Otto knowed, because the book just came out now. And I\ndon't know if -- you know, he'd dead. I don't know if he ever knew how fantastic she was.\nShe found her -- she found her feet -- her sea legs, you know. And she -- she -- she decided,\nyou know -- she didn't see her own kids, so she decided: Go for it! She did it. And I'm very\nhappy to hear that. I sort of heard the same sort of thing about my mother and she -- .not\nabout Auschwitz, because I don't know what happened to my mother in Auschwitz. But I\nhave a friend who got relieved from -- I think it was from Bergen-Belsen. She had a sister in\nSweden. This was Anna Marie Rosenbaum. And Anna Marie had a sister in Sweden, and\nthis -- and she..they got exchanged. She got exchanged, I think, for Germans who had -- I\ndon't know exactly how it all got together. Anyway, she managed to get exchanged, and she\ngot to Sweden. And, of course, she had -- had it very tough in Sweden. She had to work as a\nmaid for years and things like that. Nevertheless, she made it through. And Anna Marie had\ntalked to my mother in Westerborg, and my mother had told Anna Marie that when it was --\nif she ever got out of this alive, she was going to go to the university and become a\nprofessional social worker and she was going to make a life of her own and she finally\ndecided to do something for herself. Something that was important for her rather than just\nworking for the family and doing what my father wanted and -- The fellow who saved my\nlife and myself -- one of the reason we didn't end up married after the war was that we had\nthe most terrible fights. And one of the fights was about the fact that he would say that my\nfather murdered my whole family and my -- because by not wanting to go underground --\nHe had gotten papers for my mother and my sister and my father -- this friend of mine. His\nname was Monfred. Monfred had gotten papers for all of us. I had 1t way before from\nsomebody else, but he also got papers for the rest. And my mother had given him the mother\nfor it, so he could get it for her. And, of course, they didn't use it. I will tell later, you know,\nhow -- how this all came about. But they didn't use it. But Monfred used to say, \"He killed\nyour mother. He killed your mother.\u201d You know, and I would -- I mean we were young.\nRight? I was like 18 -- 17 or 18. I -- I-- no, you didn't -- and I practically would even scratch\nhim and fight and argue and -- Now, I -- I mean it's impossible to point blame. I mean it's\nimpossible. But I think women now would have thought a little bit more for themselves --\nmaybe for herself. Maybe she would have said -- a woman now would have said, \"Well, my\ndear. As much as I hate it, you know, you do your thing. But this is my life. And this is my\nchild's life, and we are staying. We are taking a chance.\u201d My father -- he was older than my\nmother. And he was more staid, and he was -- and she wouldn't leave him. I mean when it\ncame to it, she went along. And when she went, my sister went, who was only 14 then, you\nknow, although I had told her -- we all had told her, you know, that we would take care of\nher and we had a place for her and all that kind of thing.",
        "A: It would be better to have it in sequence.",
        "A: Well, as far as I was concerned, until the Germans walked into Holland, I didn't know very\nmuch about anything. I mean I knew that there was Hitler and that Germany was __ for us,\nyou know. Things were bad. But I was just playing and going to school and dancing and\nhaving a good, you know, a good time. And then one day there was -- the radio started\ntalking and -- and then we heard this lot of noise and we heard the bombardment of\nRotterdam. We heard it all the way in Amsterdam. I mean it was just -- the planes, the low\nhum of the planes, and the wait of it. And I remember standing at the window and my father,\nyou know -- the Germans were marching 1n right through our street which was the main\nstreetin_____\u2014\u2014_. It now has a different name, but it was then. I see them singling\n____ marching in_______-\u2014: you know, marching into, over the ____ into the through the\n____ toward the center of the town. And my father standing in the window and saying to me,\n\"Take care of your mother.\u201d I was 15. Take care of the -- your mother. You know, they'll\ncome for me tomorrow. And my -- my father was not political. He'd never been political.\nAnd that's probably..that's one of the things I'd like to talk about -- about the intellectuals in\nGermany who felt that they were too good to talk politics. To talk politics was a terrible\nthing, and you didn't talk. It was for -- for who -- not very good people. I mean you couldn't -\n- you shouldn't talk politics, you know. So they didn't. And it's we all must be involved\nand..and fight against things that are bad now, you know, so it doesn't -- terrible things don't\nhappen later. But that's not what they did. And then -- so he thought he was going to be\npicked up tomorrow. Of course, it took a year and a half, but, you know, it did happen in the\nend. The -- the first thing that happened, well, many terrible things happened then. People\nstarted -- Jews starting jumping out of windows and out of -- of balconies and -- and into --\nkilled themselves with gas and I remember standing on the balcony. We lived on the third\nfloor, and the balcony was on the back of the house and -- and there was a center which had\nthe -- had the gardens in -- in the bottom and then balconies everywhere, three stories high.\nAnd I remember a man being saved from trying to gas himself and him yelling and\nscreaming I don't want to. Don't do this. Don't do this, you know. Don't save me, you know. I\nwant to die. I want to die, you know. And I was 15. I mean this made a helluva impression\non me. And I said to me mother, \"What -- why does he want to die?\" You know, I mean\nwho wants to die? And then there was -- I mean a period there where people it wasn't one or\ntwo -- that's what I want to say. It was heaps of people killed themselves. And then my\nparents told me it's because they're Jews and -- and Hitler, you know, doesn't like Jews and it\nwas the first time I was really aware of -- We're weren't religious so we'd never had any\nkind of -- or very little connection with it, although my grandparents, I think, were. And I\nremember going to temple with my grandfather when he was still alive and in -- in Berlin.\nHe died in early -- in Berlin while we still living in Berlin. And I remember it being a happy\nexperience. He put me on his back. It was the -- I -- what -- what is the day when when they\nfinish reading the Torah and they start over. Which one? Whatever. And he put me on his\nback and they danced around, you know, and stuff like that. I -- it was pretty wonderful. And\nI remember him laying the Tefillin and I never knew what it meant and and we had\nChristmas at home. I remember the Christmas tree in Berlin was great, with the real candles\nand the applies and the ___ and the nuts and the the gifts for..for the maids and for\neverybody, you know. Everybody had gifts and presents. Took my mother two months to get\nready for Christmas. And I don't remember Hanukkah in Germany at all. And I don't\nremember it really until the Germans came into Holland. Then that year -- and I think it was\nthe Frank's also -- I think we -- we joined for the first time a reformed temple. I remember\nthe Rabbi\u2019s name. His name was Malhe, and that was spelled with a E, not an A. And I\nremember him so -- so clearly, and I even learned to read a little bit of Hebrew which I have\nentirely forgotten because it only lasted a year. And my sister also went there, and I think\nMargaret and Ann and -- and quite a lot of..of people. That was the occasion. I mean once\nthe Hitler didn't shove us back into the old mold of life. And 1t made a big difference in any\ncase.",
        "A: You're doing just fine. Just tell us what happened now.",
        "A: Okay. School. We went to school and we had a headmaster who was very anti-Nazi. And\nmuch too outspoken. I mean nobody knew what to do and how to behave in those days.\nThere was one group who knew a little bit and that was the communists. But I didn't -- didn't\nknow anything about communists, but they were the ones who knew already a little bit\nbecause they had had some people who had escaped from camps in German, you know. That\nwas possible to escape. I mean at the very beginning in 1940, \u201841, people could escape from\ncamps in Germany. And these -- these communists had already been picked up in Germany,\nput in camps, and they had come through Holland and they had told a little bit of what they\nhad seen and what they had heard. And so they informed their Dutch friends -- the Dutch\ncommunists, a little bit about things -- what things were like. So the communists were a little\nbit prepared, but nobody else was prepared in Holland. And",
        "A: The school. The school. Well, the -- the headmaster called assembly and made a large, big\nspeech about the fact that, you know, about the Germans and that we were a free country and\nwe shall remain free and we all sang the song, you know, the national anthem, and.\nAnyway, he got picked up very early, and he died very early because that was -- somebody,\nof course, told on him. They were fascists in the schools. And then one started to hear about\nfascists right and left. And one started to hear about our neighbors downstairs who turned out\nto be not too good, and then we suddenly started to hear things like our neighbors on the\nother side -- well, he was Jewish, but she was not. Boy, they're lucky. I mean things like that,\nyou know, which you'd never -- I'd never thought they were lucky. I -- you know, I mean,\nthey're know different from us, and weird things -- weird things like that. As far as the school\nwas concerned, I think we could go to school for a little while, but then, again, there was an\nassembly and we were told that the Jewish kids now had to leave the school and go to a -- a\nJewish school, and have be separated from the others. And I went to my parents and -- and I\nsaid, \"I don't want to go to a Jewish school. I'm not going to a Jewish school. I will not go to\na Jewish school.\u201d And I can just see my children coming to me and saying I'm not going to\ngo to this school. You know, I can just see the shock. I -- it was impossible. I was really\nimpossible. I got to be very, very rebellious in every way, and I would not go to school. My\nsister did. She went to a Jewish school. And it was very frightening because what the\nGermans started to do 1s to isolate the Jews into various groups. I mean they -- at a later date,\nnot right then in the beginning, but at a later date, they would go and pick up the kids 1n the\nschool, and then make the parents come to get the kids and, of course, keep the parents and\nthat was the end of that you know. Some people were then sent home again if their parents\nhad good papers, you know some kind of exceptional papers. But I was -- every time I heard\nthat the school -- the Germans or -- or green police or the Dutch cooperators -- the Nazis, the\nDutch Nazi, and anaspears. They were called then anaspears marching toward the school,\nyou know, I would run to that school and finally after I had Monfred as a friend, he said to\nme, \"The one thing you do when the Germans go somewhere 1s not go there.\u201d You know, I\nmean I was so stupid, but we all -- most of us were because what did we know, you know,\nabout how to save yourself and that you had to save yourself. You had to be careful. You\nhave to learn to be scared. And I was not that scared. You know, I was dumb. I was plain old\ndumb. But it was very frightening to have my sister in a Jewish school separated in the\neastern part of Amsterdam. We lived in the south and they had to go to_Oster, Amsterdam --\nAmsterdam ost . to school. Most of my friends did do that. Most of my friends that were\nJewish did go to school. Some of them were picked up, and their parents and them shipped\noff. Others, somehow, survived, you know, just like me. You never know what's going to\nhappen to you.",
        "A: I went -- I had to go to school. And I wanted -- I told you I wanted to be a dancer. And there\nwas school ran by Alice Kayser in Amsterdam, in___. And she had a dancing school as\nwell, where you learned other things as well. So it was -- it was recognized as a school. And\nmy Uncle Paul came and talked my parents into into letting me go. He was always my\nsavior in that respect because he had -- .my father was just adamant I was going to go to a\nacademic school. He didn't understand what was going on at all. I don't know if it was a wish\ndream, if it was something he didn't want to understand, or whether it was just\nincomprehensible to him because he had been raised in a human -- humanitarian fashion and\nthe Germans he knew were like that. He knew many, many good Germans, and, of course,\nthere were many, many good Germans. What -- but they -- they didn't have any power. So\nmy father had trouble to understand and to -- he had great trouble to go along and make wise\ndecisions in regard to the situation which -- which deteriorated from day to day. the first\nthing that happened was that the Germans took the German passport that my father had, so\nhe had no nationality. He was stateless. We had applied for Dutch citizenship. You had to be\nthere five years or I forget how many years before you could apply for Dutch citizenship and\nit's going to be granted in May of 1940. And the Germans got there just a bit too fast. It --\nthis is very bad for me later on, because the Dutch -- dear Dutch after the war when, you\nknow, my parents were dead. I was alone and they would not give me the Dutch citizenship,\nbecause they said your father applied, not you -- that your father applied. Now at the time, I\nwas under 16 and if you were under 16 the whole family was all naturalized at the same\ntime. But after the war, you know, I was nearly 20 and I was so called a grown-up and I had\nto apply for myself and they -- even though, you know, I went through all this S-H-I-T, and\nthey would not give me that citizenship. They sent me back the money. My father had paid\n200 Gilden, and they sent it back I mean the bureaucracy was just so incredible. There were\nmany other things which I'll tell when we get to that.",
        "A: Yeah. So anyway, the school was -- I went to Alice Kayser, and I went there for -- as long as\nmy parents were there and could pay for it. I went to Alice Kayser. In the end she was also\ntaken away. And then that part of my life was over. My grandmother -- and I don't know the\nexact date now -- it was 19 -- it must be \u201842 my grandmother had a home for elderly people.\nThese were old people who brought their own furniture and their own things. They were --\nand she had nurses. It was like -- what would you call it now? A home for the elderly I mean.\nand she ran it. It was her. I mean she set it up. She -- she had to make -- to earn money and\nand this is what she did. She had help, of course. And one day they came and took\neverybody including her. They had just emptied out the place. The Germans they had came.\nAnd my mother was beside herself -- beside herself. What to do? We had to get her back.\nNow the youngest brother, my mother's youngest brother was -- lived in France, and if you\nwant to, I can tell that story. But he lived in France. The older brother lived in The Hague,\nnear The Hague in Gosmer and had no funds, you know, whatsoever. So my mother went\nand took our jewelry to a jeweler. She got in touch with a guy named Putcomer, who was\nknown to mediate between Germans and other people and -- to get people free. And he said\nto her that she had to give industrial -- the Germans would take industrial diamonds for my\ngrandmother. Well, my mother went and gave to____ Nave who was a jeweler, her jewelry\nand said, \"I need industrial diamonds. Just see what you can do.\u201d And Nave came back and\nsaid there are no more industrial -- you know, Holland was closed up and -- there were other\npeople besides us that were looking for that -- industrial diamonds and -- and he didn't have\nany more. So Putcomer told the Germans. The Germans came back and said we will take\ngold bullion -- gold bars, thick gold bars. So my mother said to Nave, \"It's gold bars. Get us\ngold bars.\u201d And then Nave managed to make or get or somehow gold bars, using my\nmother's jewelry as payment. And I remember that one day after my class at -- was it after\nclass -- I think -- well, whenever I was told to go on my bicycle and pick up a package from\nNave. And I had -- I had two bags, you know, these -- these Dutch bicycles -- these black\nbicycles with a -- with the saddle bags. In one side was my books and the other side was --\nwas -- the gold bouillon. And Nave just handled them to me. I think he wrapped him. Not\nvery much. I saw them. And I brought them to my mother. And my mother gave them to Mr.\nPutcomer and Mr. Putcomer gave them to the Germans and my grandmother got out. And\nshe then, of course, she couldn't live in her house because that was -- they closed the house\nthen. So she came and lived with us. And it was terrible. I mean, for my mother. It was\nextremely hard to have another mouth to feed. It was very -- it started -- you had to start\nbuying on the black market. It was starting to be very difficult. I don't know if we already\nhad ration coupons at this time or not but any case and my mother was so worried about my\ngrandmother -- that she would be sick. She was in pretty good shape, but she was a\ntyrannical old lady. And I can just see my poor mother between my father, who was so\nscared he was starting to get heart trouble and a little ulcer and -- and trying to keep us kids\ncalm and trying to run the house and trying to get the food on the table and we -- it must\nhave been -- and she started to get very, very thin. I mean my mother got very thin. And I -- I\nwas very busy with myself. I was discovering boys and I was 16 and, you know, I..and but I\neven noticed she was getting very, very thin. And I -- I loved her to distraction. I mean she\nwas my one solid -- my, you know, and -- and so was my father except I started to see he\nwas scared and that was very scary. Well, where were we? So anyway",
        "A: The grandmother came back. Yal. That -- So one day my tyrannical smart, but what do you\ncall 1t when you -- impulsive grandmother said, I have to get some of my paintings. I have to\nget some of my rugs. I have to get some of my this, and I have to get my silver and my --\nElse, you need it, she said to my mother. You should have it. I mean why should the German\nget it. What the Germans used to do was after they took everybody out of the house, they\nwould go and take all the furniture and whatever was there and I am -- I don't know what\nthey did with it. I think they probably later on gave it to the people who were bombed out, or\nthey gave it to Goering and he took what he wanted and then gave it to -- I mean I just don't\nknow where the stuff went. But my grandmother went, without telling my mother, went to\nher house. Of course, she had the key and she went in and, of course, the house was being\nwatched, and my grandmother was taken again. And that was it. I mean there was no jewelry\nto sell. and Mr. Putcomer -- my mother starting running around to Putcomer, to this, to that,\nand she couldn't get my grandmother back out. And I have letters of hers and I mean which\nare so -- so touching. There's just no words for it, you know, I mean, where she says \u2014 \u201cOh,\nmy poor Mooty,\u201d she calls her Mooty, of course, \u201cand Mooty, she doesn't even have a\nblanket and she doesn't even have a sweater. I mean she just went there. Right? She does\nhave anything, and how am I going to get to her?\u201d And these letters are also a brother in\nVoltsneir who couldn't budge. He couldn't -- Anyway, and she managed, she got to\nsomebody who managed to bring my grandmother a blanket and to bring my grandmother a\nsweater and to bring her some shoes while she was still in -- on the ___, there was\nwhich was a Jewish theatre. It was in the Amsterdan Oldst, which had become a Jewish\nsection. There was a Jewish theatre where -- where plays and musicals and stuff were being\nperformed and that was now used for a collection place for Jews from Amsterdam and that\nwere going to be shipped to Westerborg. And while my grandmother was still in Westerborg\n-- sorry -- while she was still in this ____ there, my grand -- my mother managed to get\nthings to her. People took it in. I don't know how. But she managed it. And she agonized.\nAnd she got thinner and thinner. And then one horrible thing after another happened. My\nUncle Hans and Ava -- my cousin Ava, who came to visit me just now, told me these stories\nabout Ann that I mentioned. Hans and Ava who had a little baby did go underground. And\nmy -- my father was just so upset because he said oh, if they ever find them they will be\npunished more than the Jews are already punished. At the time they thought all Jews would\ngo to labor camp and just work, you know. And my father was very worried about that. Hans\nwas his favorite cousin and he really was worried about that. Anyway, Hans and Ava --\nYou want their story?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Her name is Ellen Citreon Sleppe. Her name is Sleppe. I think I mentioned her when I spoke\nabout Berlin. What happened to her was that she was first sent to Westerborg, where she was\nquite awhile. She stayed quite awhile, and then she was sent to Bergen-Belsen which was, in\na way, not as bad as Auschwitz. It was bad enough and she did died there. She died of\nillness, but the stories that come back about her are fantastic. Again, this Anna Marie\nRosenbaum I talked about earlier who was exchanged to Sweden, she was telling about my\ngrandmother and she actually brought me a little purse which my grandmother -- .send it to\nme, which my grandmother had given her. she said that my grandmother always had some\ntea. If it was made out of thistles or if 1t was made out of anything you know or what I sent --\nI -- we did send packages to them in Westerborg. We managed to do that. And she had tea\nand she would have a -- a napkin over an orange crate and she would always have something\nwhen people came to visit, and she was always upbeat and she was always brave. And my\ngrandmother had been a volun -- done voluntary work as a nurse and she was doing that in\nthe camp. She was 72. She wasn't old. And she was extremely energetic, and so when she\nwas sent to Bergen-Belsen, she lasted quite awhile there, but in the end, she did die in\nBergen-Belsen. But we heard nothing but nice things about her. Anyway where shall we go\nnow?",
        "A: Grandma has been taken away. And we are now starting to -- to get -- people my age -- I was\n-- let's say, I was 16 going on 17 I guess. The Germans started to call up young Jewish\nchildren like me who were 16 and up. At 16 you were considered a family on your own by\nthe Germans. And they would call up -- these German -- .young people by name, not in big\n___, but by name. And I had many friends who were called up and we used to have -- they\nhad parties before they -- the night before they went, they would have parties and they would\nsit around and they would say oh, what we're going to do. We're all going to get together. It\nwas like ___, you know, as if they were going to Israel, like it was going to be a -- a\nsummer camp or, you know, a holiday camp or something. Yes, we going to work very hard,\nbut in the evening we'll put on your lipstick and we'll all be together and we will sing and\nwhen the war is over, the Americans will come and we will be saved, you know -- this kind\nof atmosphere. Now when I was 16, I needed -- my father worked for the Yotsrat, which was\none of the things that gave you a permit to -- it postponed you're being, supposedly, your\nbeing taken away. And when I was 16 I had to get my own security. I didn't -- I wasn't secure\nanymore under his permit so I needed a permit of my own. And they looked around and\nthey looked around and it turned -- I managed -- they managed to get it for me. I don't know\nhow, but I had to go to work work in Amsterdam Oldst, -- eastern Amsterdam and I got a\nplace in what was called the Cultural Mission and it was to____. I think it was to\nI am not sure. That's the one that described in the book, and that's where I met Monfred, and\nthat's where -- I think that's where -- that was the ___. Now there it was mostly, perhaps\neven all, and I'm not sure of that, because I didn't pay attention to it, X-German Jews. It was -\n- and there was -- they were a lot of communists there. And that was the first time that I ever\nheard the word, and that I, you know, ever came near to hearing but there was some kind of\norganization. What happened was I had to work -- I worked 1n organizing courses. God help\nus. Courses for people who were going to be shipped and killed and murdered in various\nways which we supposedly didn't know, which -- but what I was -- which I was told by the\npeople for the first time are the people in___. They told me -- the young people there\n-- they were conscious. They were political, and they were conscious of what was going on\nand they said to me, \"All the young people that you're sitting around with -- you silly goose.\nThey're all going to be dead within two weeks.\u201d Now that might have not been true, but\nthat's what they told me. And I started -- I said that's not true. I went home and I told my\nfather. I said you know, I was told that. And he said, \"That's nonsense. Germans would never\ndo a thing like that.\u201d And -- and I -- at that time I had met Monfred and I told Monfred and\nMonfred, who was my friend -- my boyfriend, he was 20 -- .who became a boyfriend. Matter\nof fact, I met him in____.. I took courses as well as organizing the classes for others. And\nin one of the courses and, of course, on ___very necessary for people who were going to get\nkilled. And in a course on ___ I met -- there were two fellows actually that I liked, and one\nof them was Monfred. And Monfred and I started going out vaguely if there was such a\nthing. I mean he walked me home and, you know, picked me up and we walked. There was\nno transportation so we walked to __. And he said to me about this remark of my father's --\nGermans wouldn't do a thing like that. He said, \"But your father doesn't know these\nGermans. These are not the Germans your father knows -- knew. These are different\nGermans.\u201d He said to me, \"Look at the soldiers. Look at them. That's the kind of German.\nLook at the Nazi. Don't look at the kind of Germans -- the lawyers and doctors and the kind\nof people that your father knew in the voluntary organization. Look at who is running this\nplace.\u201d And he tried to educate me, you know, to tell me. It was hard because I believed my\nfather. You know, I mean he was my everything and I -- I couldn't believe it. But I told my\nmother. And my mother said, \"Mon might very well be right.\" And she said, \"Bring him\nhome.\u201d And I brought Monfred home and he and my mother and my sister became fast\nfriends. I mean they believed in Monfred, more than I believed in Monfred because I had\nsomething to protect. And so -- but he -- he -- he was everything they said he was, you know.\nHe was the rock of the ages, and at 20. He came from a different kind of family also from\nGermany, but very different. And he was political from a very, very early age, and so was his\n-- his sister was less political, but very conscious of the situation. And anyway Monfred told\nme that I would be murdered if I -- \"If you get called up,\" he said to me, \"you do not go.\u201d\nAnd I said, \"That is impossible. I mean what would happen to my parents if I don't go.\u201d And\nMonfred said to me, \"Nothing that wouldn't happen otherwise,\" he said. And it was terrible. I\nmean I said, \"What do you mean?\" And he said, \"Everyone who goes and gets into their\nhands will be killed.\u201d He said, \"They are all going to die.\u201d And I wouldn't believe it and I\ncouldn't believe it. So he took me to a party -- one of those parties with the kids and\neverybody was sitting around saying we're going tomorrow and rah rah -- and Monfred said\nto me, \"You see this guy over there, Leo Vials?\" \"Yes.\u201d He says, \"He's not going.\u201d I said,\n\"That's impossible.\u201d He's saying he's going. He said, \"That's what you have to do. Nobody\nhas to know that he's not going, but he's part of us. And he is not going.\u201d And then it took\nhim about three hours to explain to me how anybody could not go, and what you'd do if you\ndon't go. And -- and how you survive, and where do you get food. And where do you get\nmoney and -- And this was my first acquaintance with the possibility, you know, of not\ngoing. And then in my dance class -- I went after work to a dance class -- I met a fellow\nnamed ___ and he had a friend who he told me could get me false papers. Ike came to me\nand he said, \"It is time for you to start thinking.\u201d Now he was Dutch. He was not Jewish --\nand he said to me, \"It is time for you to start thinking about doing something about not\ngoing.\u201d I said, \"Where do you go come on. Where do you take it.\u201d He said, \"I have a friend\nwho told me all about it.\u201d He said, \"You need paper.\u201d And he said, \"It'll be 300 gilden.\u201d I\nremember that. 300 gilden. That was a lot of money you know. And I came home and I said\nto my Mother that I needed the money and she said, \"What for?\" And I said, \"For the\npapers.\u201d And she said, \"Tomorrow, when you go back to school you'll have it.\u201d And those\nwere my first false papers. And they were very bad. But they saved my life. And on the\npapers -- in -- in those days, at the early days, the -- the false papers were people who died or\npeople who had happened to have really lost them or various ways that you could get papers\nand what they would do 1s they would take out the picture of the person -- the original\nperson, and insert your -- your picture and your fingerprint and whatever else they had to\nchange -- to change. And, of course, these were not papers that had a J on it, which those\nwere identify papers without a J. They looked very authentic. Now mine was of a 22 year old\ngirl. | was 17 maybe and I looked like 13. Pigtails, little. So they were unlikely papers. If\nanybody really stood there and looked as it said, this girl is 22 years old you know. So those\nwere my papers. And I had them. And then one night -- oh, he also, Monfred also -- then I\ntold Monfred I had the papers and he looked at them and he said, \"They're not bad. They're\nnot bad. They're very good. Keep them where you can get to them.\u201d And then we went to\nanother party, and there he had organized that one of the escaped communists from Germany\nwas there and he took off his shirt and it was, you know, he had welts and -- and x-cuts and I\nmean it was pretty bad to look at it. And he -- and this guy told us that, you know, that he'd\ngotten that in one of the camps, you know, and he had -- I think Bergen-Belsen. He had\nescaped and he was, he was telling us about the camps. And he was telling us about the salt\nmines and he was telling us about all sorts of things, you know, that and when we were\nthrough with that, Monfred said to me, \"Do you believe me now?\" I believed him. I believed\nhim! And I came home and I said to my father -- I told my father I had the papers, my false\npapers and I said to him, \"I'm not going. Whenever they call me, \"I said, \"I'm not going.\u201d\nAnd my father said, \"You have to go.\u201d He said, \"What will happen to us.\u201d And there came\nthis beautiful guilt was put on me like a hood you know, all over. If you try to save yourself,\nthat's what it meant, you know, we will all die. Because in that -- in Westerborg, they had\nvarious kinds of barracks. They had barracks for -- the normal barracks for people were\npicked up normally, and they had barracks that had a big S on it for Straasburger, and in\nthose barracks were the people who had been bad, you know. And that would -- would be\nthem. And those people would go on transports first. They would -- in during the selections.\nI think because I know very well that some of them escaped and some of them got out and\nsome survived just as much I guess. Maybe a less percentage, but just as much as anybody\nelse, which in Holland wasn't good. So for months, I tried to live with that, you know, and\nsay, \"Okay. I can't kill my family.\u201d And my father, he felt he had calmed me down. And then\none night we were sitting on our big window in the living room and we were looking out. It\nwas -- already it was curfew. There were curfews at night. And all of a sudden, we see trucks\ncome out. Long rows of trucks. And they're starting at the ____ at the -- at the high rise\nthat you saw in the picture. On the _____\u2014s not on the ____ on ______ where we lived --\nand they were coming out. And I -- I mean I couldn't believe what was happening. They\nwere pick -- going into every -- the way this -- and the street is set up that they were -- every\nentrance had steps going up to a platform, and then a wide staircase going up to another\nplatform and on that platform were six apartments. I think there were six. And they would --\nat that point they did not just pick up everybody, you know. They -- they came with lists and\nthey picked up people by name and they took -- I know I remember it as today, they picked\nup old Mrs. Triman Mr. Triman was married to a Gentile lady and he was okay. But they\npicked up his mother. And she could hardly walk. She was a very old lady, and I -- my\nstomach -- they were good friends of ours. My stomach just turned. They picked up all the\npeople I knew. And they stopped about two stoops before ours -- two -- you know, two\nplatforms before ours. And, however, Monfred always knew what was going on. And he\nknew -- he lived in another part of town. And he knew that they were doing our street. And\nhe sent this Leo Vial that I mentioned -- the guy. He had good false papers. He was a\nGerman civilian -- German soldier of some sort. He had -- wore a long leather coat and he\nwas on a motor bike and had hood on. I mean you can imagine he looked like. And right in\nthe middle of all this going on, the door bell rang and, of course, we -- my parents thought\nthey were gonna -- I mean I thought I was gonna die and we thought how come. You know,\nthe trucks aren't this far away. They aren't at our house yet. How come? What's going on?\nAnd it was Leo Vial, and he came to get me. Monfred had sent him to get me. Right in the\nmiddle of all this thing going on. This curfew and everything! Right? So I put my false\npapers in my pocket and I said to my, of course, the J was not on my clothes. I took it off.\nAnd I said to my father, \"Goodbye.\u201d He grabbed me, and he kicked Leo down the stairs and\nLeo drove off and told Monfred, \"I can't get her. She -- they won't let her go. I can't make a\nfuss. If I make a fuss, I get arrested. So I can't, you know, make a fuss.\u201d So he left and I was\nleft there and, of course, that -- as I said, they stopped two platforms before us so nothing\nhappened to us that night. But that was -- after the next getting together I went to____ and\nI talked to all the people there and they didn't trust me because I was blabber mouth and\neverything, but they said -- they said to Monfred, \"Hide her if you can.\u201d And that's what\nhappened. Monfred's father had a factory where they made cosmetics, I think, and soap\nbottles and all this little stuff, and the first night I spent -- I was hidden in the factory. And it\nwas right close to Ann Frank were -- the Ann Frank house. I mean it was on the same kind of\na canal. I don't know if it was on the Frank's house, but it was on one of the canals. It was the\nsame building, the same situation. And I stayed there, but they weren't planning for me to\nstay there. They couldn't have people stay in that house, so some how Monfred had arranged\nfor me to go to a paisson where the woman didn't know anything about me. She got my false\npapers and she thought I was that person and she registered me with the police under that\nname and the police didn't you know, they just registered me and that was it. And I lived\nthere and that's where you have the pictures from -- the pictures of Monfred and me. They\nwere taken in my room at that paisson. That was -- that was my first underground place.\nAnd I even got mail. They arranged even for me to get mail so the woman wouldn't get\nsuspicious that I was alone -- a loner and that maybe, you know, there was something wrong\nwith me. And she got my coupons. I got food coupons, which Monfred somehow got. I had\neverything. I went to ballet class, a different school, of course, not -- because Alice Kayser\nhad already been picked up, so I went to a different school and I will tell you about that\nschool later, but in any case, I lived a relatively normal life. I was no more hungry than\nanybody else and -- and it wasn't so bad then anyway during that early period. And Monfred\nand I became very good friends and, you know, I couldn't go to _____ anymore, of course. I\nwas finished with that part of my life. I was underground. My parents were still there. You\nknow, I forgot -- let's see. My parents were picked up twice. And the first time it might have\nbeen before I finally left, but I'm not sure. Maybe it was. I came home. It might have been\nbefore I finally left. That was when Ike said, \"Now you need papers.\u201d ___ said -- . Yes it\nwas before I finally left. Again, I was sitting -- and was up in the attic with a girl from next\ndoor who was half Jewish, and we heard all that noise. And there was this during the day and\nthe green police were picking up everybody in the street, everybody who was Jewish on that\nstreet. And what they hadn't done -- they hadn't stopped the traffic and they hadn't stopped\nthe trollies. They hadn't stopped every -- anything. It was during the day and everything was\ngoing on normally and they were just having themselves a little rautsey_ there. And I -- the\ngirl next door went over the roof to her house and I went down and my father wasn't home\nbecause it was a working day, you know, and I took off the J and I took my false papers and\nI went -- no, I didn't have false papers. I had nothing! That's right. I had nothing. And I went\ndown the stairs and again with the pig tail, you know, the whole works. I came on the lower\nplatform and two German soldiers jumped up on it. And I was standing there in the middle.\nLittle German girl in pig tails. Right? Little bag that said gym class. And they said to me,\n\"Get the Hell out of here. We've got work to do\" or some kind of thing. __ That's what they\nsaid.___. And it -- and I went and then I went on the trolley. I mean the trolley was\nrunning. I went on the trolley and I went -- I went to -- to Ike __ mother house --\nmother's house. And he -- they hid me. And then when he said, \"You need false papers.\u201d\nThat's how it was -- coming back to me. That's when I got my first false papers. And his\nmother hid me for three days and during those three days I kept calling home and finally, of\ncourse, I didn't get an answer because they had taken my sister and my -- and my mother,\nand my father, of course, went there -- there too. They had taken them in some gym room of\na high school where they assembled them. And at that time my father's paper which said that\nhe was working for the Yotserat and had -- had given him a freedom a permit and he -- and\nthey let him out. They let my family out. And that was -- that was the first time they were\ntaken away. Now, here I'm now going back to where I was in this paission. My mother at\nthat time -- she had given some things to some Gentile neighbors below us. She had given\nsilver, some clothes, some valuables -- things that she wanted to keep that she thought might\nbe safer with them in case of an emergency. She had given things to one of my uncles,\nYohan ___, who later became the head -- the director of the big theatre in Amsterdam\nafter the war. paintings and stuff like that. Anyway, I'm in this _paission and I'm going to\nschool and everything. And I hadn't seen my parents for a long time. We talked over the\nphone. I -- I'm very homesick, very homesick. And they are -- they want to see me. Right?\nAnd it's -- it's going to be a holiday. It's something we call ___, which I think is ____ but\nI'm not sure. It was about June 18th that I went there or June 19th, 1942. And I -- Monfred\nsays to me, \"You are crazy. You should not do such a thing. You never know what's going to\nhappen, you know.\u201d I mean nothing has been announced. He hasn't heard through his\nsources that anything's going to happen, but you just don't know and it's better not and why\nshould you. You know, I had to put up a star and -- and a J to go to my -- to go home. I mean\nif the neighbors would see me without, you know, I mean, they would know that I was -- it\nwas ___ It was terribly dangerous. It was stupid. It was dangerous. And I did it anyway. I --\nI went to somebody's house, sewed on the J, lightly but I sewed it on, and I went to see my\nparents and my sister. And, of course, there was a lot of crying and there was a lot of\nhappiness that we were still there and we were still together and it's now 1943, June 1943.\nAnd everything goes fine that first evening and then the next morning at six, six o'clock -- in\nthe letter that I wrote later, I write the right time a woman we used to call Cassandra came --\ncomes up and said, \"I just heard. This whole area is closed off and we're all -- this 1s the big\ndeal for this area. All the Jews are going to go. This is not a little rautsey by name. This is\nnot by name. This is everything. Everybody!\" And I was there. I was there! I was caught! I\nwas -- I couldn't -- I mean it was terrible. At the same time, you know, I was with my family\nand if anything happened to them, it would happen to me and this was it, you know. And my\nmother said to my father, \"Frans, _____,\"\" which means Frans, she goes. She has to leave,\nyou know. And I had my papers. I had my papers. Couldn't take a thing. My father says to\nme, \"Bless you. Go. This is the end. I think this is it. This really is it. This is the last time.\nThis is it.\u201d He said, \"You go. You go. Try it. Doesn't matter anymore, you know. Just try it.\u201d\nAnd I didn't even think how fantastic that was, you know, that I had his -- at least at the last\nmoment that he said I agree with you, go. And not that it lessens the guilt. Really, it doesn't\nlessen the guilt of not being with them, you know, not participating in that thing that\nhappened to them. We had a hiding place in the house which was in the attic where there\nwere two nice rooms in the attic and there was a double wall and we had suitcases. They\nused to be called elephants. They were more like trunks with a rounded top and they were\ngrey, and that's why they're called elephants and on the back of one of those, my mother had\nmade a handle, and she had made a big hole in the wall and you know, Susie -- she promised\nme she would put Susie in that hole. And I said to her, we will come and get her, you know.\nAnd you can go in there too. She had papers. Monfred had gotten her papers, and had gotten\nSusie and -- and my father papers. He said, Monfred had said to me, \"You father will never\nuse them, but I don't want to have it on my conscious that he can't if he needs to, you know,\"\nand so as I left, you know, I said to them, \"Put Susannah in -- in there, you know, in that\nhole. Give her her papers. Make her pull the thing. And you to___, you know.\u201d All of\nyou. Go in there.\u201d And -- and, of course, they didn't, I mean. They didn't even use it. They\ndidn't use the papers. They didn't use -- they didn't go in the hole. They didn't do anything.\nAnyway, I went down -- down and it was a beautiful day. It was like this morning except\ncooler you know. Sunny, warm, June day in Holland. So beautiful. Little clouds and -- It's\nso easy to close a neighborhood off in Holland in Amsterdam because there are water\neverywhere. Right! All you have to do 1s stand on the bridges. Just stand on the bridges. You\ncan stop anybody. I didn't know where to go. I had no where to go. I didn't know the bridges\nwere closed off, so I went to the bridges. And I went to the first bridge and I saw there was\nsomebody standing in it. And then I remembered that there were people from ____ where I\nhad worked who had good hiding places, who were communists, you know, and who would\ncertainly hide a little blonde girl. Right? So I went there. And man, they were so angry. They\ntold me I'm stupid. I was endangering them. How would I dare come to a house, you know,\npeople might be watching me. I'm coming into a house -- nobody else is on the street and\nhere's this kid walking down the street and it's coming to their house, and they have to be\nsaved because they later on want to save Germany. Right? After the war, they want to make\ninto a great communist country. Or anyway they want to change Germany into something\ngood, and I was endangering them. And away with me! That was the end of my\ncommunisms if I ever had any. I'm telling you I didn't know what it was, but I -- right there,\nI knew that, you know, these people were no different from anybody else and it's dog eat dog\nand save yourself and, you know, I didn't think all of that right then. I just knew I had no\nplace to go. All of a sudden, loud speakers all over the place. \"All Jews had to prepare\nthemselves. Gentiles are not allowed in the streets.\u201d Loud and clear. All over. And I'm in the\nstreets. The only person in the street except for those damn people on the bridges. Right?\nThere were no trucks going yet, because they gave them an hour or something to get ready.\nSo I was the only one on the street. Of course, there were people in the windows, and they\nsaw me. Right? I was already out of my neighborhood, so it must probable that people who\nsaw didn't know who I was and and I'm walking along and I come to that -- to the first\nbridge, and there's two soldier, a green soldier, you know, and there is a black _-anspera_ on\nthat bridge. And I didn't know what to say, you know. And I go up there and I say and they\nsay, \"What the Hell are you doing.\u201d I mean I had -- there was nobody there. And I said,\n\"Well, I had come to that part of Amsterdam on the trolley in the morning to go swimming\nwith a girlfriend. We were going out far away and -- and anyway, I tell this long story and\nthey look and me and they say, \"Boy, you are lying because no trolley has come into this\nsection the entire morning.\u201d And I, of course, didn't know that. Trolleys start at six and I --\nSo they said, \"If we could get off this bridge, we'd take you to the police, but we're supposed\nto stand here and we're only ones on the bridge and we can't go anywhere, so -- \"They said,\n\"You better get away from here and go home. Go back to your girlfriend's house or\nsomething.\u201d So I went to the next bridge, and the next bridge I already know something you\nknow. I know. And I say, \"While I was staying over with a girlfriend overnight to -- to go\nswimming in the morning and now [I hear all this going on and I think my mother 1s going to\nbe very worried about me, and I better go back home and I -- I want to get home, and I have\nto go over there. And -- and he said, \"Like to make a date for you tonight, but right now, you\nknow, I can't get off the bridge and you can't go over there. It's against the rules and I can't --\nI can't do it.\u201d I'm getting very scared. I'm -- because it's only one more bridge that's not too\nfar before they come in with the trucks and I -- I thought what am I going to say? What am I\ngoing to say? And I couldn't think of anything to say. And I get to the bridge and there's one\nGerman soldier. Just a young, German soldier. And, again, this total surprise, you know.\nAnd he says,____\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014SSs Arn I'm ering. ____ 9 German, you know, and I'm crying\nand he gets all upset. You know, he's young. He thinks I am his sister no doubt. And he says\n___, Where is your mother? Where is she? AndI say_____\u2014CSCS<\u2018<2; PE \"Get\nover there. Hurry!\" That was it. Saved by life. Sunday, beautiful Sunday over there. People\ngoing to church. Quiet. Nothing going on. Two streets up nobody knows what's happening\none street further. I go to Monfred, not to my _passion because I'd said I'd be gone for several\ndays and I don't want to suddenly show you up, you know, on a day where there is a rausea\nin another place, you know. So I got to Monfred's house. They are sleeping. Now, you have\nto know that Monfred -- he says now, he's not tied in with anything. I don't know. He always\nknew. He always knew what was going in -- on, and he knew nothing. He knew nothing!\nThey had ways to get into closed off areas. Again, there were the leather coats and the\nGerman accents and the papers. They had everything. So they tried to get over there, to get\nmy parents, to get their friends. They couldn't. They couldn't get in. This time everything was\nclosed up. He couldn't believe it either. He just -- we tried everything. Just everything. Of\ncourse, the phones didn't work. I heard later that the Jews just came down the steps. They\njust came down the steps. And they just climbed on those wagons. They helped each other\nup there, and they sat and they were taken away. Now, you have to know that I had many\nfriends. I had a friend named Marie Austria, who was a photographer, my teacher --\nphotography teacher later on, and her sister _____ later on, and she lived on ___. She lived\nabout two of these stoops away from Ann Frank. And I had modeled for her. She's the one\nwho took all the pictures that you have -- the big ones. And she she decided -- she and her\nsister decided. This is big rausea. This is a mixed neighborhood. How do the -- this is\nSunday. How do they know who's where? Which door is what. It's not as if they come with a\nlist. They didn't come with a list. And so they had a hiding -- the same hiding place that we\nhad. You know, in the double wall behind -- with some -- well, I don't know what they had\nhiding that hole in the wall, but that's where they went. They went up. They never opened the\ndoor when they knocked on their door. They didn't open. And it was a big rausea, and they\ndidn't break any doors. They did nothing. They just passed that door up. Nobody opened the\ndoor. It might be people that are away on a trip. It's Sunday. They -- anyway, in the evening\nthey left. And they survived the war. I mean -- you know -- it's just -- there were other\ncircumstances that they survived the war and they had other dangers later on. But we're\ntalking about that moment of decision. That moment! That moment of decision. One little\nthing. One little thing. One decision made. I later heard of people -- actually friends of Marie\nAustria or a friend of Marie Austria, a woman who had been in Auschwitz and had lost most\nof her teeth, you know, and looked like Hell, and when the Germans left Auschwitz, they\nwalked the people. You have heard of that. and they walked them and many of them died\nbecause of the bombardments on the middle of the road, etc., like that. But she -- who was\nFrench. She was French. And she at one corner where all the Germans said, \"And now to the\nright,\" she went to the left. And she survived the war. She came home. Back to France. She\nfound her husband who really -- that was really a story. I mean I'm getting off the track here.",
        "A: Yal. Yal.",
        "A: Anyway, June 20th, so I went -- I went, after a few days, you know, I went back to my\npaission. I stayed with Monfred and his mother and his sister and her fiance. They all lived\ntogether in a -- how had they found the place where they were going to survive the war in 91\nValarstraats in Amsterdam. Monfred's sister, Marga, whose picture you have was a very\ninventive and a very intelligent, very bright young woman. She was -- I don't -- I imagine she\nwas three years or two years older than I was, maybe four. I'm not sure. But she had always\nsort of helped support with sewing. She was a genius in -- in clothing design and\nmanufacturing. And she always was much more practical. She wasn't at all a girl who went\nto school or anything, but she always had her hand in things. And she know how to get\nacquainted with people that were important. for her! For what she wanted! She saw an ad in\na paper for the upstairs of a house in the Valarstraat with a family of Anespairs -- actually\nDutch fascists. And she went there. And she said, \"We would like that. We would very much\nlike that and the apartment, and there will be various number of people because all of us\ntravel. We work for the German for the Wehrmacht and we do this and we do that -- you\nknow, speaking German very well. And this was a Dutch woman who could not speak\nGerman very well. Her husband was an Anespair and -- and she and her son were living\ndown stairs while the guy worked for the Germans somewhere in Germany. And that's how\nthey got that first apartment. So it was a pretty safe place to work -- live if you didn't give it\naway. If not something, you know, you couldn't have assemblies there. You couldn't -- you\nknow, you had to take into account what kind of place it was, but all of us, nearly all of us --\nof this particular group were not hidden away like Ann Frank was where you couldn't move.\nI mean we all were on the streets. It was dangerous, very dangerous. I mean I was well\nknown in Amsterdam. My family was well known in Amsterdam. It's a small town, you\nknow. It's not like now, millions of people. You -- you were very well known in your\nneighborhood. And I wasn't in the exact same neighborhood. I was still in Amsterdam south,\nbut it was the old south, rather than the new south. And I was not as well known there,\nexcept by a few people. So the way they made your papers, your false papers -- they gave\nyou the same first name that you really had. So if somebody would suddenly see you and\nyell, \"Hey, Barbara,\" 1t would be okay. You don't call each by the last name so you know --\nso-- That's my paper -- my name always was Barbara, which was very helpful. So that was\nwhy I went to see Monfred that night when we after -- or that morning after my parents were\ntaken. Anyway, I heard that they were all taken away, and they -- again, they tried to get free\nwith these papers, but the papers were now null and void. It was pass the period that these\npapers would do anything for anybody. And they were sent to Westerborg, which is the\nassembly camp. In the -- in the assembly camp was already my cousin Heinz. I've told you\nabout him and his wife. My cousin Heintz was hidden through the Dutch underground --\nsome kind of channel. The way -- the way it seemed to have happened was all through\nindividuals. You knew somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody. There wasn't a\ngreat big organization where people all knew each other. It was one person knew another\nknew another knew another. The less you knew the better, because if you get caught you can\ngive away maybe one person. Maybe! If you were not tough as nails. And this is what\nhappened with my aunt and uncle. They -- rather my cousin. They were hidden by a -- a\nDutch family, and it so happened that the son of that Dutch family also did other things.\nMost people who hid people were not allowed to do anything else, but they, of course, didn't\nknow about their son who was receiving weapons which were dropped by the British in\nHolland for the resistance -- to be used by the resistance in the middle of the night -- .planes\nthat flew low, you know, whatever it was. And he he was given away by somebody and they\ncame to that house and they took -- they took the men. Just the men. Not my cousin, my\ncousin Ava. They didn't take her or the wife. And Ava was immediately put somewhere else.\nBut Heinz was caught and he was then sent to Westerborg as a Jew. The -- This other person\n-- the Gentile survived the war which was a miracle, but he had somebody who got him out\nin somewhere.",
        "A: To me. Okay. Well, my Uncle Heintz -- my cousin Heintz was already in -- in Westerborg,\nand he, of course, he saw his mother. He saw my mother. He saw my father. He saw my\nsister. He saw my grandmother. All going through there! And Heintz did survive the war in\nWesterborg. There were very, very few people who did. There were -- I think there were 300\nat the end. And he was one of them who survived. And they actually kept him in the camp\nfor a little while just to make sure he didn't happen to be -- because of his German, again, his\nGerman business. But he wasn't a German who was trying to hide as a Jew -- in a Jewish\ncamp, which happened a heck of a lot. I mean, any -- later on, it was the Germans who were\ntrying to save their lives and -- and hide and -- and try to stay alive. What about me? During\nthe war, I must say that most of the war really spent standing in line for food. Because of the\nway I looked I could do that. And we had -- we hid a lot of people. And that really was --\nafter reading the book, I realize that it was true, that what the little groups did was try to help\nthemselves and each other staying alive. It was less a big picture, you know, that you -- that\nthe underground would attack something or somebody, although I guess that happened, but\nnot with us.",
        "A: About me?",
        "A: Okay. I stood in line for food. I also did a few other things. I was -- as -- as I say, they had to\nbe careful with me because I was pretty stupid. And I -- they put me to work -- they put me --\nI was a dancer. Right? And there was a ballet company in Amsterdan run by Evan Geeorg1,\n-- Evan Geeorgi who was a great dancer from somewhere in Germany, and Hamburg or\nHanover -- something like that, and she was put by the Germans tn into the Dutch\nlarge state theater to run the ballet company. I went into her ballet school and took classes\nand I was then asked to join the company. And I asked if -- the underground, \"Was it\nalright?\" \"Oh, Yes!\" Because you got fantastic papers when you went there -- into this\ncompany. Because the company traveled, you got papers to be out after curfew. And that\nway I could help shift people from one hiding place to another or like American soldiers --\nshot down people other people who were underground -- . And let me tell you how this was\ndone. There were no more trucks, taxis. And there were very few cars, because there was no\ngasoline for them to use. So what they had was people on bicycles pulling, you know, like in\nthird world countries, they would pull little wagons behind them. Some of them were\ncovered so that when it rained, which it does a lot in Holland, you know, people wouldn't get\nwet. And others were open. All sorts of various ways of transportation. And the few people\nthat I moved were moved in the middle of the night, you know, I mean after curfew. With\nthem being the bench and me sitting, you know, sitting like this bent over and me sitting on\ntop on -- on sitting on their backs with a rather short skirt and my very good papers, with\nmake-up on still from the ballet and when the Germans stuck their -- when the Dutch police\nstuck their head in there and saying, \"What is this?\" you know. Curfew is on -- you could -- I\nwould have a smile and papers. And I shifted a lot of people. That way! You know, from one\nhiding place that had gotten dangerous to another one which is new, hopefully better. And I\ndid little things like that. Also, Monfred would distribute the ___ which was the communist\nnewspaper. Marga was distributing the __ which was the regular -- the -- the other\nnewspaper. And I would be sent carrying bags of those with lettuce and tomatoes and carrots\non top. And, again, you know I would be -- I would be told, \"You bring this to a certain little\nportal with and just somebody will come and get it.\u201d I didn't know who was going to get it. I\ndidn't know when they were there. If they were there before me or after me. I -- you know, I\nwould go. I would watch the portal and if I saw somebody go into a specific corner of it, and\nnot ring the bell or -- or, you know, whatever it was that I thought these were the right\npeople, I would walk up with the bag. And if they took it, they were the right people. If they\ndidn't, I would walk on. Little things like that. I also Marga's fiance -- we were constantly\nshort of money of course. That was a big problem. And Monfred in his letter to me just now\nsaid that some money we had because some more jewelry of my -- they had a lot of jewelry\nthat was being sold and I had little pieces left that I could sell. It was sold to Dutch people\nwho, you know, wanted it as an investment. And the money was used for us to eat and -- and\nlive, rent and stuff like that. Later on Leo Vial would transport Dutch workers to France. We\ntried to mix-up people, because the Germans were taking all the young people to Germany to\nwork in those factories, not particularly in concentration camps, just in factories while their\nown people went to the various fronts. And we would mix-up these. We would have\nFrenchmen in Holland, and Dutchman -- and when the Germans would find them, the\nFrench would say, \"We were sent here to work in -- in Holland and for the Dutch -- for the\nGerman industry,\" And the Dutchman in France would say, \"But we were shipped here by\nthe Germans to work for the for the French industry.\u201d I mean it was a total mix-up. Some\npeople also would be sent, if we were lucky, would be sent through France and Spain into\nPortugal and would then join the Dutch Free Forces on the British 8th Brigade in England if\none would be able to get there. But our Leo only took them to France. Well, on his way\nhome he would often bring suitcases full of lipsticks and , you know, all these\nwonderful French things that you couldn't get. And perfumes and other things that the\nFrench and that Holland didn't have. And then me, I would be sent to sell them. And I would\ngo to -- he even wrote the addresses down where I would go to sell them downtown in\nAmsterdam. And people would buy them like crazy. I mean I didn't -- I sold them wholesale.\nI sold the whole suitcase full all at once, and we would eat. And one time I came home and I\nsaw the Dutch police all over the place, watching -- in our house. Well, I knew enough,\nThank God, not to go home. So I stood on the corner watching til they came back out and --\nand they had made a mistake. Of course, they didn't. I don't know what Monfred did, but he\ngot rid of them. And -- I mean there -- there were always -- always these horrible moments,\nyou know, where you think, \"Now, this 1s it. This is it.\u201d And also one time I drove -- rode my\nbike up a one-way street the wrong way. I..I was really confused. It was downtown and there\nwas a lot of traffic. And I got stopped. And, of course, they looked at my papers. By that\ntime, I had much better papers. Now, with the dancing, that ended because somebody told\nEvan that I was Jewish. Now she was supposedly pro-Hitler and pro this and pro that, but\nshe knew that I was Jewish and she never did anything about it. Never! She called -- did call\nme in and she said, \"It would be better if you had a little more training before you go on\nfurther trips.\u201d\u2019 She put that very well. She never said, you know, \"I put you into this company\nbecause you were so good and what the Hell have you done to me?\" She said exactly what I\ntold you. She said, \"A little more training would be good for you, so just go to school.\u201d So\nthat she -- you know, wouldn't be endangered and I would be must less endangered. And the\nstrange thing was that she had been told by people who were actually watching out for me.\nWas a different group of people. It was Maria Austria and her friend, ___\u2014_\u2014, who are all in\nthe book who thought it was much too dangerous for me to do what I did, and who didn't\nwant me to do it. And I wouldn't listen. And so that's how they did it. They went and they\ntold Yvonne Geoorgi about that. So I have -- I have a picture of Yvonne Geeorg1 which\nshe had signed for me and -- and, you know, and I gave her her book and we -- we left. I\nnever did believe that was really a fascist. She was a artist who -- who maybe didn't have as\nmuch character as one was supposed to have, but she was a German and she was -- I don't\nknow. I -- who's going to throw the first stone. She didn't kill me. She was good to me.\nReally. And after the war, when all the artists marched -- you know in the -- in the -- what's\nthe big festival after we were liberated -- liberated? I was not allowed to march because I had\nworked for the German, you know, in the ballet, during -- Nobody ever said -- nobody ever\nsaid: But she did it because of the papers. The underground didn't say anything. Monfred\ndidn't say anything. Nobody -- I mean, Monfred probably didn't think it was very important.\nI thought it was terrible! I should have been able to march with the others and, anyway, this\nis after war stuff. That's German -- Dutch bureaucracy kicked in and -- and everything was --\nwas, you know, back to the way they thought life should be run.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: I didn't smuggle. I sent them by mail. The Germans would let you send packages to people in\nWesterborg, and I managed during the nine months that my parents were there -- I managed\nto send a lot of packages. And I was always collecting things, you know, as I went along.\nAnd, of course, we had ration coupons so it was hard, and I always got letters back. Actually,\nwe had mail from there. Regular mail -- .regular mail from my parents. And the mail I guess\nwas read, but it was sent on. And they received everything I sent. Nothing was dis -- had\ndisappeared. I also want to say that, you know, when they were taken away that I never knew\nthat they were in Auschwitz. I didn't know where they had gone. I heard they had been sent\non, and that was it. And it now appears that it was in January of \u201844. And it was -- it was a\nterrible shock. It was just really incredible shock. And I also want to say that I think I\nsurvived because I was 17 or you know, by that time 19. It's the sort and it was exciting, you\nknow, this living alone and not knowing -- everyday it was something else, and not knowing\nwhat was going to happen. The drudgery, you know, of trying to get food and of survival and\n-- Okay. At 19 they felt I was getting old enough to do some other things also. You know,\nsince I couldn't be in the ballet anymore, I had to be good for something. And besides\nstanding in line for food, which was hard in the winter in the rain and in the cold I can tell\nyou. We took care of a lot of other people who were underground who could not be out. I\nmean from the point of view of -- I didn't particularly see these people, but I had to supply\nfood, you know, get food for them. Somebody made me or helped me -- I forgot how, but I\nrented an apartment. Was the same apartment with the same street, the 91, you know, where\nwe had been before. This was now an 86. was on the second floor of 80 -- number 86 in the\nValarastratt. We might have just heard that it was coming free, you know, because we were\nright there in the neighborhood. Anyway, it was rented under my name my false name, of\ncourse. And then a very difficult time started. Very difficult! First of all, we went into the\nhunger winter. You know the time that the south was liberated, south being Braba -- north\nBraba, and all those. And that only did provinces around were still occupied and\n____s was coming up along the Rhine and we were stuck in that area. Not only us, but also\nthe Germans. They couldn't get out. And this was the first time that they also had less food.\nThey started to be hungry. And we started -- they started to be scared of the underground\nwho had all the weapons -- had so many weapons. And they had weapons, but they were\nmostly old men and kids, you know, and it was just a very, very scary situation. And during\nthat time I had the apartment and apartment had big windows. And I met the neighbors from\nacross the street, and they were telling me that the people downstairs would go upstairs to\nour apartment when we were out and steal the food out of the closet. Well, that was one\nthing. But we also were hiding people there. And that was another thing! Right? And the --\nimagine them running into these people. So we had hiding places. You know, we had closets\n-- what used to be closets, was now papered over and there was an entrance via the floor and\nthere was a rug that went up to it. And, of course, the people we hid knew how to get into\nthese closets. Of course, the Germans weren't stupid either and if something was going in --\non, you know, if they did have a rautsea,, if they did have a check into various apartments,\nthey would stick their bayonets into the walls and into the floors and, you know, looking for\npeople. And There was one guy which was assigned to our -- to my apartment where I lived\nwith Monfred and with various other people of the group whoever was around at the time.\nAnd this man was, I think, a Czech -- Czechish communist. And he would give lectures in\nour apartment and we weren't allowed to have more than three or four people, so this very\nscary, and I started to be very scared. And, first of all, I didn't like what he said and I said to\nMon, \"You know, I do not want this anymore. This is my apart -- you know, I hired under\nmy name and I would -- I'm responsible and it's dangerous. And these people, they will tell\non us. And Monfred said, It's nothing to be done. We have to have him.\u201d He also had to have\nhis wife on weekends. So she was hidden somewhere else. RIght? But on weekends, she\ncame to our place. And one day this -- this one woman and I who took care of the apartment\nwere told that the Germans were going to check into place, and in several in the\nneighborhood. So we had to move him. We had to move him. And we moved him at night\nsome -- to another apartment -- another place. And then we had to clean up to see that they\ndidn't see that there had been a man anywhere, because there was supposed to be two women\nliving in this apartment. So we started -- we went into his apartment -- into his room and he\nhad left everything. Cigars! First of all, how did he have cigars? Nobody had cigars. Apples!\nFoods! Cheese! We didn't give it to him. How did he get it? And when -- finally when all\nthis was over, you know, the Germans never did come to visit -- to us to check up, but when\nit was all over, I said to my friend, \"I do not want this guy.\u201d It's terrible. I mean he was a\nhoarder, somebody who hoarded things. We were supposed to share everything, you know.\nThis was very important. And he was a communist. He should know how to share. Anyway,\nhe -- I told Monfred, \"he has to go.\u201d And Monfred got very, very angry. They beat up on me\nbecause they were so angry that I would, you know, and I -- and they said, \"Well, what can\nyou do to us. You can't do anything anything to us.\u201d I said -- and I stupid -- my old stupid, I\nsaid, \"Yes, I can go to the police.\u201d Can you believe it? I was just impossibly stupid. I mean I\nwas so desperate. You know I thought we're all going to be caught. You know, we're all --\nand -- and I'll never forget that guy. It was awful, and his red headed wife. Impossible! So\nanyway, those are -- were some of the adventures, you know, during the -- and, of course,\nthe Americans -- New Year's Eve -- American soldiers, who had to be hidden, you know,\nfrom -- they would be shot down by the Germans over -- the -- the -- the planes would come\nflying. They were full of bombs, you know. And on the way home, he might have a bomb\nleft. And they would drop a bomb. They would just drop the bomb -- the -- the Americans.\nSo sometimes the Germans got one of those planes, and we got somebody to hide -- English,\nAmerican, whatever. New Year's Eve, the American went on the roof and shot off his gun. I\nmean I'm sorry. Ohhhh! So -- uh -- then the -- the hunger got so great that the -- and we got\nto the end -- toward the end, you know, the Germans knew -- toward the end. And they let\nthe Red Cross drop food in Amsterdam -- in and around Amsterdam. And the Red Cross --\nwe had flat roofs. You know, the roofs in Amsterdam behind the decorations are flat. So they\ndropped cases of food on the roofs or in the parks or in open space, and the Germans were so\nscared by that time they didn't dare to pick them up. And the underground and -- I -- the food\nwas distributed evenly, you know. You had to give whatever -- if you found one on your\nroof, you know, you better take it. And we were all starving. We were really -- the bread was\n-- had gone sour. We ate everything, you know, that -- that they dropped. And then the -- we\nheard that the Canadians were coming to liberate us. I haven't told you about Akmier.",
        "A: Okay. Well, toward the end of the war, I kept hearing about a man man Almier who was a\nGerman, and who did fantastic things for the underground, the Dutch underground. And\nMonfred said one day that Akmier's place of hiding was not very good and Akmier should,\nperhaps, if it was alright -- it was my apartment -- right? -- Akmier should come to us. Well,\nAkmier came to visit -- to see if that was alright. Well we also arranged a girl for him to\ncome that he might like. We wanted him to come because it was dangerous for him. We\ndidn't want him to get into trouble. Now it turned out that -- that he was -- he really had to\nstay where he was he felt for a little while. And the underground came to him to Monfred\nand said you have to get him out of there because if he is -- when we get liberated, if he is\nwhere he is now, we might have to send him back to Germany or anyway he'll be in deep\ntrouble. And so they sent me to get him. And I went over there I said you have to come and\nstay us and you have to come. You have to come. So Akmier came. And then I heard his\nwhole story. He -- he was a German -- was involved in a Munich story where the six people\nwere hanged. Six students -- they turned over a whole suitcase full of pamphlets on -- on an\nassembly in -- of Munich University full of anti-Hitler propaganda. And in one -- of course,\nthey all got caught. I mean it was very early on and nobody knew what to do. So -- so in one\nof their books was his name? -- in one of his -- the notebooks, address books was his name,\nand somehow they managed to get him out of Germany. He had just finished his medical\nstudies and he was sent to Villemina Hot Towers in Amsterdam, which is a mental\ninstitution and hospital in Amsterdam, and he was supposed to study further psychiatry. He\nwanted to go into psychiatry. So he studied there and worked there, and he started working\nwith the underground. And he -- he's the one -- one of the people who supplied us with all\nthe serums -- of in..inoculations, of all the diseases you caught during the war. He got us a\npiece of soap once in awhile. He he helped people. He moved people from one place to -- he\ndid a whole lot probably that I don't even know about. And then the Germans shifted him to\nFrance because there were big battles going on in France, and they needed psychiatrists --\nsome people to help. And in France and once -- once he got there, the situation was so\ndisastrous that he was supposed to tell the soldiers 1t was worthwhile fighting for Germany.\nIt was worthwhile fighting. And he saw -- he couldn't do that It was idiotic. It was\nridiculous to fight. And one of the lucky things, then -- more or less, lucky -- was terrible for\nhim -- was that they needed surgeons worse than they needed psychiatrists in the end you\nknow. And he was made to work sewing up these left over pieces of flesh and he absolutely\nlost his mind. He just couldn't. That was not his nature. He couldn't stand -- stand it. And so\ntoward V-J day, he had a little Fiat -- little thing, you know, that they had the one -- for one\nperson like bug, they used to call little bug, and he got in it and he -- he rode. He got to\nBelgium ___ and there were Germans there and they painted big white zeros, circles on --\non all the cars that went through. So Akmier said to himself that doesn't look too good, you\nknow, why should I have a mark like that on my car. And he went to the next town and he\nwashed off the zero -- the -- the -- and he drove on and he heard shooting and he saw a whole\nlot of cars with big white zeros and there were men and women standing up against the cars\nbeing shot, one after the other. Deserters. Shooting the deserters! He didn't have a zero on his\ncar, and he made to Holland. And in Holland, he called the underground and the\nunderground -- the car had broken down so he had to walk a little bit. And in Holland the --\nthe underground brought him a suit, took his and buried it -- his uniform and buried it, and\ntook him to Amsterdam and hid him. And Akmier did a little bit of work, but not too much\nthen because he could -- what could he do, you know. He was, himself, endangered. And --\nand then after the wa, Akmier stayed in Holland. He got this -- you know, the Queen said he\nwas a guy and he could stay -- a good German, and he was -- he was really very marvelous.\nBut he had a lot of damage done to his physic during the war, and he never, you know, he\njust -- he was a psychiatrist and just -- just by himself you know. He didn't -- he worked as a\npsychiatrist, but not -- he doesn't share. He doesn't -- I often I always asked him, you know,\n\"Don't you share with others? Don't you discuss your cases with others, don't you?\" \u201cUh-\nhuh.\u201d Nothing. Nothing. Just sit. And",
        "A: We became very involved, but in the end I decided to come to the States anyway. No, I -- I\nwanted children and Akmier did not want children. He said, \"This is not a world\" -- this is\none of the things that was done to him. I mean, what happened to him. He couldn't get passed\nit, shall we say. He said this is not a world for -- for any children. And he ended up marrying\na woman who already had a child and couldn't have anymore. I mean he really looked for\nsomebody like that and he found somebody who was divorced and had the kind of blood\ndisease that she couldn't have any more children then. He -- he -- it was terrible. It really was\nso sad. And he -- he had such talent. You know, he played the violin, and he was very well\neducated. His father was an incredible person. His father -- there were three sons. Now let\nme just say that because you have to hear something good about Germans. ______ His father\nwas the headmaster of a school and when this all came about and Hitler came up -- his father\ncalled his three sons and he said, \"There's only one God.\u201d They were all Catholic. \"There's\nonly one God and he 1s not on this earth. And there is only one law, and it's God's law.\u201d\nThat's what his father said. And all the boys were terrific. I mean two of them did go to the\nfront, but they all survived. But I mean there are people like that. And he lost his job. The\nfather was thrown out. Right? But they needed teachers so bad, he ended up teaching, just\nplain old teaching then.",
        "A: The war's ending. The war's ending, and people are showing up. People come popping out of\nthe woodwork. My cousin, Ava comes back. She says, \"Here I am.\u201d And she told me they\nwere all -- my cousins -- you know, I started learning who was alive and who was dead.",
        "A: Well, you know that was a day -- we knew -- there was a terrible thing that happened at the\nlast. You might have already have heard about that where the underground had been able to\nabsolutely -- and was not able to do anything because it -- you know -- it -- and they were so\nfrustrated. I mean they did do things like shoot a soldier -- shoot -- shoot somebody, you\nknow, or -- or blow up some trains. I -- I guess they did some things like that, you know. But\nthey had all these weapons. And they hadn't been able to get their hands on the Germans, and\nthey really wanted that. And in Amsterdam, you know, we knew the -- the Canadians were\ncoming and -- and everybody went downtown to the Dom, which 1s the big place in front of\nthe town. And on the Dam also was the German officer's Club, right -- I mean the Palace of\nthe Queen is, shall we say, to the north and officer's club just a little street apart, maybe 10\nfeet, 12 feet. There was the German Officers Club. And who was in this club? Old guys and\nboys of 15! I mean really the Germans had nobody left that, so the -- some how somebody\nhad a big shotgun tn -- in the Palace -- the underground had a big shotgun and shot into the\nclub. And, of course, the Germans then had to fight and I think since there were so many\npeople standing right there in the Dom, I think 147 people died -- and -- and I -- many\nGermans died. I mean it was totally useless. It was one of those things that happened in total\nconfusion and fear on both sides, fear and loathing on both sides, and just a horrible, stupid,\nawful thing. Well, during that period we were getting sort of ready. You knew you could\nalready go on the streets. You knew you didn't have to be as afraid. And they were coming.\nAnd they did come. They came. And I remember looking at the trucks coming and full of\nthese healthy pink and blond and blue and black-eyed guys. I -- I thought our -- our guys\nwere great looking, you know. I'd never seen so much flesh. I mean it was incredible. And,\nof course, we went out there and screamed. We just screamed. And all my dance buddies,\nyou know, my ballet -- my friends, they all -- I heard all of them -- they all had boyfriends.\nThey all got boyfriends, and this and that. I, of course, had a friend and I did not. I had\nalways been scared to death of any kind of soldiers, so I never had anything to do with any\nkind of soldier. Anyway, gun carrying, uniformed person. It was awful. It was -- I mean it\nwas wonderful. It was heavenly, and it was scary. Very, very scary! Because I didn't really\nknow where I belonged then, you know. I knew I had -- I had immediately withdrawn\nbecause I got into the ballet. The ballet 1945 was started right then. It had already been\nstarted for a whole month before that, and we had rehearsed to get ready for -- for the ballet.\nBut then it really started and I started to work nearly immediately after the war was over in\nthe Ballet 1945. Then later we came to the States, Ballet Company, ________ grew out of that.\nAnd then they had a festival, a wonderful festival. And, of course, there were no lights.\nThere was not yet any electricity. By that time we had to go down and get water to the third\nfloor in buckets between three and five, you get -- got assigned periods where you get water\nin buckets and we were pretty starved. I mean during that we ate from the fox kitchen. We\nate bulbs flower bulbs, soup made out of flower bulbs and we ate -- well, whatever the soup\nkitchen came up with, that's what we ate. You know, you had three little pots and one of you\nhad to go and get it. And the amazing thing was that the formerly poor people complained\nmuch more than the people who formerly had money. It was very, very funny. And the\narticles in the paper were a riot. But hunger was not funny. And we would go up and get up\nin the morning and have -- have a ship's cracker, you know, one of these hard tack things,\nand we haven't -- hadn't had any butter or fat for so long that we were freezing to death. I\nwas always cold. I was -- and this is still one of my greatest fear. I can stand hunger better\nthan cold. It was terribly cold. We would take -- there was six of us or seven of us in the\napartment -- we would go all in one bed and put everybody's blankets and mattresses on top\nof us and we still were cold, you know. And eat a hard tack before getting up, and then only\ncold water to wash with. And, of course, after -- right after -- oh, we had no coal to heat --\nheat the stove, which by the way was the only thing to cook on. Remember gas wasn't there\nanymore. So we got -- Monfred had a big __ he got a lot of peach from outside and -- and we\nbrought -- we had a whole room, small room, storage room full of peat. And we used the\npeat to -- to cook on the stove which was just a little heating, which also heated the room.\nAnd that peat was full of fleas and we had a flea plague on top of the cold and the hunger.\nAnd one night I caught 84 fleas. I killed 84 fleas. I mean we were covered, and actually we\ndidn't get rid of it til the Americans gave us some DDT, which was brand new then. I mean I\ndon't think there even. I mean it was just in total disaster. We were hungry, cold, and full of\nfleas by the end of the war. It was outrageous. And then there was this wonderful festival\nwhere they made fires everywhere and they had -- I don't know where they got lights, but at\nnight we had lights and boats were laid across the canals and you could walk from one side\nfrom one __ to the other just over -- over the boat. I was in love. And it was wonderful. It was\nthe most wonderful -- wonderful day in my -- I can ever remember. And I didn't think -- I\ndidn't let myself think about my parents and my -- for that one day. And then afterwards, I\nsaid, \"Now what? Now what?\" And then we started hearing that -- oh, they are lists. They\nare lists of people who were coming back, and your mother is on one of the lists. Well,\nMonfred said to me then, \"Don't believe it.\u201d And I -- I already hated him with a passion.\nRight? Because he had done all these horrible things. And he said, \"Don't believe it.\u201d And I\nsaid, \"I'm going to believe it.\u201d We then knew -- we knew about concentration camps. In \u201845.\nSo I started going to the train stations. And, of course, I stood there. When I had the time, I\nstood there and I stood there and I stood there. I asked -- and when I see these films, you\nknow, they are films made by the French. They were wonderful French films, but and -- and\nthey're these people going to -- other people coming out of trains, you know, and they have\ntheir shaved and they looked awful and there are these people coming back from camps and\nyou ask -- that's how it was -- and you asked, did you know so and so? Did you know so and\nson? No. No. No. Now I think that one of those people was somebody took my mother's\nname to get back to Holland. I'm sure of it. And recently somebody showed up with my\nsister's name. And, of course, when I started looking, she was gone. I mean there was\nnobody to find. And it's the same sort of thing and then I started waving goodbye to people. I\nhad girlfriends who met Americans and who married them. And I started seeing people who\nwere not good and women who were not good in the war. And I was waving goodbye to\nthem because they were marrying American soldiers. What do the American soldiers know?\nThey know nothing! And if they had known, what would it have mattered? They were in\nlove. You know, such 1s human nature.",
        "A: Well, after the war, of course, I -- I worked for two years in the Ballet. I danced. That's how I\nmake money. And I started to realize that every time I got a job, they had to ask for a work\npermit because I was not a Dutch citizen. And it was a lot of work for them and bless them,\nthey did it. I mean I did not -- I thought I wouldn't have done it. I can get another girl, you\nknow. But I always had a job. And Akmier, of course, was working by that time, and so we\nmanaged. But when I decided -- a friend of my family Lotta Kalinaski, also from Berlin who\nwas -- 1S quite a well known psychiatrist here in the States I think -- .[ went for shock\ntreatments and things. And Lotta was looking for my parents. I had gone to my older\napartment -- our -- our apartment where I lived with my family and had told the woman there\nwhere I was living and to please forward any mail that she would get and to please let me\nlook in the hiding places that we had around the house. And, of course, she'd found the\nhiding places. There was nothing there. And then the woman below us, who was a fascist\nduring the war, she said, \"I saw you got on -- you know, it was dangerous for her --\ndangerous period for her. She might have been shipped to Germany or killed by the\nwhere all the Dutch wanted to take revenge on their people -- and she said, \"I didn't give you\naway when you ran away. You helped me.\u201d And I said, \"You were helped enough.\u201d Because\nshe had a lot of our stuff, and I didn't get anything back. So I -- I said, \"I won't give you\naway, just like you didn't give me away.\u201d And that was all I ever did for her. I didn't give her\naway. I said, \"If they catch on to you, that's not my fault. I don't -- you know, it's your.\u201d\nAnyway, I got a -- I got a lot of mail from all over the world, from Australia, from Canada,\nfrom America, from -- all -- all over the world where people had managed to escape to. And\none of the letters I got was from the Kanaski's and they asked me to come to the States. At\nthe time I was in the Ballet and I was with Akmier and I thought Akmier would get over the\nfact that he didn't want to have children, which I knew I had to have children. So I said to\nKanaski, let's wait. Let's wait. He said, \"I'll give you an affidavit and you come.\u201d And he\nkept coming by because he -- he went to Berlin to lecture. He helped set up the free\nuniversity of Berlin as psychiatry -- department of psychiatry there, and giving lectures. So\nhe came every year two or three times and he said, 'Now you must come.\u201d And made -- he\nsent me the affidavit and made me sign it, and by that time I thought it would be better and\nthat's how I came to the States. He was very -- they were very good to me -- very good to\nme. And I also have other family here. They were also good to me. So -- and I worked as a\nballet -- as a dancer. And that's it! Thank you.",
        "A: Thank you. You're welcome. You don't want to know I have four children.",
        "A: No. That's alright.",
        "A: I just wanted to say that -- you know, you hear all these horrible, horrible stories that I made\nit through and I have a nice husband and four children , who are very, very happy. And my\nhusband's name is Mike Rodbell. And we live in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and\neverything's fine. I survived. Yal",
