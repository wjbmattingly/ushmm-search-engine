        "Q: Okay. So, how old were you at the time of the Holocaust?",
        "A: At the time I probably was like seven years old?",
        "Q: And your family consisted of how many people?",
        "A: Yes, we were a family of five, I had three sisters, I was the middle daughter, and\nmy father was \u2014 name was Joseph, or Jossul in Yiddish. My mother\u2019s name was\nEsther.

        "A: No, I never went. I-I was supposed to \u2014 I remember that I was supposed to go\nthat year to school when the Germans came in. So I never actually went to school.",
        "Q: Were your other sisters on \u2014",
        "A: The older sister must have gone to school, but I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I\u2019m sure she did, because she was much older. Like, I was closer to the\nyounger one, you know, and there was probably quite a few difference between the\nolder and myself and my younger sister.",
        "Q: And how \u2014 how many years are there in between your sisters and you?",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t know, you know, I\u2019m just sort of imagining that sh \u2014 the older one\nmust have been like at least three years older, because I remember her \u2014 you know,\nbeing that I was little, I thought she was big. But the truth is, I don\u2019t know. And the\nyounger sister was wa \u2014 not too \u2014 too much younger than I was.",
        "Q: Okay, so wh-what do you remember about the [indecipherable]",
        "A: About the home life I don\u2019t remember too much. We lived in a very beautiful\nstreet by the name of Panienska. And I know that the fi \u2014 people who know\nanything about Dubno, and if you tell them Panienska street, they know that that\nwas a very beautiful street. My parents had like a little \u2014 I would say they called it a\nNovember 8, 2008\nkiosk, like they was having candy and things like that. So my parents were hardly at\nhome. But they had one of \u2014 a\u2014 a-\u2014a Christian, actually a Ukrainian woman by the\nname of Lerna(ph), and she was raising us. She was really more like my mother \u2014\nlike a mother to me than my own mother, because she was always with the girls, my\nmother was busy in the store. So, I loved her very much, and she loved the children.\nShe was very devoted person to us. And in fact, she was the one that saved me, at\nthe end. So, too much about the life before that, I don\u2019t remember too much. But I\ndo remember when the Germans came in, and I\u2019ll never forget one of my cousins\ncame and they said, you know, you have to leave your home, and we have to all\nmove to a ghetto, which was a Dubno ghetto. And then wi \u2014 all of \u2014 the whole\nfamily, like my mo \u2014I remember my grandmother was there and my father\u2019s\nbrother also lived there, and they had many children, like at least four or five\nchildren. But I don\u2019t remember, you know, their ages or their names, I hardly\nremember that.",
        "Q: So they were all gather at the ghetto.",
        "A: And \u2014 and they \u2014 we were all in the ghetto, and la \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. Ah \u2014 hah \u2014 sorry, just have a quick question, sorry.",
        "A: No, it \u2014\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "Q: How did you know that \u2014 I mean, you were seven years old, how did you know\nthat this was the Germans? Did you also see local people involved in gathering\nJewish people and taking them to the ghetto?",
        "A: Well, to tell you the truth, I didn\u2019t see Germans until I was in the ghetto, and\nthen I did see Germans. They used to come every once in awhile, they would say \u2014\nyou know, they used to call it an oblava(ph), which means like \u2014 you know, they\nwould decide that they would \u2014 gonna come into the ghetto, and let\u2019s say, whoever\nwas outside, they would kill. And I do remember seeing them.",
        "Q: Did you recognize them in their uniforms?",
        "A: Uniforms, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. Were they a different color than other people? Was \u2014",
        "A: Well, it was the German uniforms \u2014",
        "Q: It was German.",
        "A: I remember their hats, it was like a greenish uniform.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And, you know, people would alert us, so, the Germans are coming, so we used\nto hide.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yeah.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "Q: So, the ghetto, how many people of your family do you \u2014 do you recall more or\nless? I mean, a \u2014 yo-you just mentioned that you met there your aunts and \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, there was \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 cousins.",
        "A: \u2014 well, I\u2014as I said, I don\u2019t \u2014 I know he had a wife, and I know we had cousins, I\ndon\u2019t remember how many and how old they were. But, you know, I know we lived\nin the si \u2014 all th \u2014 all in the same house, you know, in \u2014 in the ghetto. And in the\nghetto, I don\u2019t know, I remember playing like outside a little bit with, you know,\nother kids. And \u2014 and then I also remember that m-my uncle and my father, they\nmade like a hiding place. They called it a schron, which means like an underground\nbunker, I would say a bunker. And whenever there was rumors that the Germans are\ncoming, or that the end was gonna come or whatever, we used to hide in that place.\nAnd once it was over, everybody came out. So I do remember that.",
        "Q: And was it only your sisters and you that hid there, or was also the other \u2014",
        "A: No, e-everybody.",
        "Q: \u2014 cousins, and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: Everybody.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "Q: Okay, so others as well?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. So, what happened afterwards?",
        "A: What happened afterwards, of course you know the life in the ghetto was a \u2014\npretty miserable. I remember even I \u2014 I \u2014 I'll never forget that one day we were\noutside and the Germans came, and I remember they took like a little kid, and they\nthrew them in the barrel of water, like rainwater, you know, the barrels used to\ncollect rainwater? And that image stayed with me for a long time. But what\nhappened is, towards the end, I remembered also again, people came \u2014 well, first of\nall, you know my father was in touch with le -- Lerna(ph), that\u2019s the nanny that I\nwas telling you about. And what happened was, the ghetto was built by Jews, and\nthey were built by planks, you know, there were planks? And they like left one\nplank open, and she used to come and ge \u2014 bring us food. And one time she actually\ncame and said that she wanted to take me, and you know, to save me, and \u2014 and \u2014\nand so on. And she did take me out of the ghetto, I don\u2019t remember how, but I\nremember that my father was like crying when I left. And in the middle of the night,\nshe took me to her place where she lived, not too far away from the ghetto.",
        "Q: Do you know why \u2014 why you, and maybe not your younger sister, or your other\nsister, yeah.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I always wondered. I always wondered. That\u2019s something that I\nalways, always have in mind, why me, you know? But I think that what happened,\nthat it was circumstances, because we \u2014 yeah, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know really why.\nBut the first time that she took me out, in the middle of the night, I sort of got \u2014 got\nscared, you know, that I\u2019m away from my parents, so I came back by myself, I\ndon\u2019t know how.",
        "Q: How old were you still?",
        "A: \u2019'm maybe seven years old.",
        "Q: Seven, okay.",
        "A: And I came back and I still remember that at the ghetto gate, they used to have\nJewish, I don\u2019t know, I want to call them policemen, but guards, let\u2019s say guards.\nAnd I still remember that one of them said, look at her, she\u2019s coming from the\noutside and she didn\u2019t bring anything. Cause all I did was, you know, just come\nhome. And this Lerna(ph), who was the one that, you know, I was with, woke up in\nthe morning and I was gone, and she was like really panicky. So she came to the\nghetto and she said to my father, I don\u2019t know what happened, I don\u2019t have the\nchild. And he said, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s here. So that\u2019s \u2014 I remained in the ghetto with\nmy family, until the very end when they announced an akeja \u2014 an akcja mean \u2014\nmeant that they were liquidating the ghetto.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "Q: This was in \u2014 was it years later, or \u2014",
        "A: Well, we were occupied in \u201941, and this must have been, I don\u2019t know. To \u2014 to\ntell you the truth, I don\u2019t know exactly whether it was a year or two later.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Whatever the ghetto, you know, that probably could be documented. But I do\nremember that somebody came to my father and said, listen, Lerna(ph) 1s at the\ngate, you know, because we were all gated in. It\u2019s not like today\u2019s gated\ncommunities, yeah. And they said, you know, if you have a \u2014 a child, just, you\nknow, throw her out, like bring her out. So I remembered like they picked me up\nphysically and brought me to the gate. By that time the Germans were already \u2014\nthey were on their way to come to liquidate the ghetto. And she was waiting for me,\nshe took me by the hand like this, and we started walking, just walking. And I \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know, I was just very pliable, I guess, and this time I just went with her. And\nin fact, on the way \u2014 on the way, as we were walking, we were caught by the\nUkrainian police, and we were taken into a pla \u2014 a room, and I remember sitting\nwith her, just like today, like she was sitting and I was sitting. And the policeman\nwas called away for some reason. There was a woman scrubbing the floor and she\nsaid, what are you sitting here? Go. He\u2019s not here, get out of here. And so she took\nme again by the hand and she \u2014 we walked out of there, which was again a miracle,\nNovember 8, 2008\nI guess in Jewish you would say bashert. And we just walked and walked and\nwalked until we hitchhiked. We hitchhiked, and she had a brother that lived on a\nfarm, I don\u2019t know how many kilometers away, because I have no idea of things\nlike this. We came to her brother, and I remember she put me up like in a part\nwhere, you know, nobody could see me. And I was there for maybe a week or so, I\ndon\u2019t know how long either, because I have no \u2014 I had no perception of time\nwhatsoever. And after awhile the brother said to her, listen, you can\u2019t stay here,\nbecause if they discover that you have a Jewess here, then you know what\u2019s gonna\nhappen, we\u2019re all gonna get killed. So \u2014",
        "Q: Just a quick question again, sorry.",
        "A: No, that al \u2014",
        "Q: Was this the house of her brother or were you in \u2014 in [indecipherable]. Was this\na house, a farm?",
        "A: It was a farm.",
        "Q: It was a farm.",
        "A: Definitely a farm. I\u2019m \u2014 he lived there, you know, with his wife, I guess, and \u2014\nand her mother was still alive, I remember that. You know, an older woman.",
        "Q: So, were you allowed to go into all the rooms inside the house?\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: No, I\u2014I was just like \u2014 they used to say, like an apprivichik(ph), I don\u2019t know\nhow to explain it, but they had like a wooden stove, and then on top used to be like\nwarm, you know? And I remember s \u2014 being there, like cooped up, you know,\nhidden. And so she said, you know what? I'll go back and I\u2019Il see, because you\nknow, she didn't know what happened. So I remember she went away for a day or\nso, whatever, I don\u2019t know how long it took. And when she came back she said, I\ncan\u2019t take her back because nobody\u2019s there any more, they\u2019re all killed.",
        "Q: So she went back to look for your family?",
        "A: She went back to the family, to the ghetto, and the ghetto by that time was\ncompletely liquidated, nobody was there. So she came back and then she had\nanother sister that lived also on a farm, but the farm was called the a houtur(ph)\nwhich means that it was isolated. It was like the farm, and then it was nobody all\naround, you know, not too many people around. So we stayed with that sister for\nquite awhile. And I don\u2019t know what I was doing, I remember going out with the\ncows, or with the horses and you know, li \u2014 she had one son, and it was very good\nto me. I would \u2014 never had any suffering, I never had \u2014 I was never hungry, because\non a farm, you know? And this woman, Lerna(ph) who took me, she was like crazy\nabout me, and I loved her so much, that she was everything to me, you know?",
        "Q: Right.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: And I was very lucky, because I was beloved by her, so I didn\u2019t feel \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nfeel like, you know, like I was trash and something like that. And I don\u2019t know how\nlong we stayed there. We stayed there for quite awhile. And then she had another\nsister by the name of Anya, and she lived in the city, which was not any more the\ncity of Dubno, but it was called Rovna. Was Rovna, let\u2019s see, what was it? No, not\nRovna. | \u2014 I have to think of the name. In Russian it was called Krasnoarmiisk.\nBut really, 1t was Radziwillow, you know, and th \u2014 when the Russians were there\nbecause it was constantly Russian, Polish, German, Russian. So it was\nRadziwill\u00e9w. And there we had an apartment, and I lived with Lerna(ph) and her\nsister Anya. And in fact, you know, when the Russians came, they \u2014 the bombings\nwere there and we were like in a \u2014 sort of in a bunker hiding from the bombs, and\nher sister was hit with the shrapnel in her arm; I was sitting right next to her. And I\nremember there was a certain flower on the table, that for years afterwards I\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 cause the mingling with the blood and everything, I couldn\u2019t smell those\nflowers, you know, like every time I s \u2014 had those flowers, I s \u2014 like nauseous. And\nyou know, during the time, I can\u2019t like tell you everything. The way I went to\nchurch, and you know, wearing the cross and I used to play with the kids, and some\nof the kids said that I\u2019m a \u2014 a-\u2014a Jewess, you know, and she denied it because she\nsaid that I was her child, that\u2019s how I survived, as a child of Lerna(ph).\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "Q: Were you \u2014 were you then raised as a Christian?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes, but at night she used to remind me, because she was so wonderful that I\ncan\u2019t even begin to tell you. And I didn't want to \u2014 I \u2014 be \u2014 be reminded that I\u2019m\nJewish, I really didn\u2019t want to, you know, but at night she kept saying to me, you\nknow, I don\u2019t remember if she talked Jewish to me or something, couple of words,\nwhatever. But yes, I was running around as a Christian girl. And \u2014 and, you know,\nso then after the war, when \u2014 not \u2014 it wasn\u2019t really after the war, it was just a time\nwhen our town was liberated. So I had an uncle, my father\u2019s brother, his wife and\ntheir son, they were saved in Russia and they lived in Siberia. So, they had written\nto our town, if there\u2019s anybody left from \u2014 my maiden name was Leviatin(ph) \u2014\nLev -- Leviatin(ph), but you know, you have to s \u2014 in English it\u2019s Leviatin(ph). So\nshe had written to somebody, I don\u2019t know to whom, and they said they think that\none child was left. And on that score, she came all the way from Siberia, and she\nmet me. I was at that time running like to school, and she met me on the street, and\nshe said, oh my God, you know, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m Janyet(ph), her name was Janyet(ph),\nand \u2014 and I \u2014",
        "Q: She was their sister?\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: She was my aunt through marriage. Her husband and my father were brothers.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I ran away from her. I said, I\u2019m not Jewish, I\u2019m a Ukrainian. \u2019m\u2014I-\u2014Pma\ndevoted \u2014 I even remember, because she reminded me. I didn\u2019t remember that, but\nshe reminded me afterwards that I said, I\u2019m \u2014 you know, like an \u2014 in Russian I said,\nI\u2019m a steeron(ph) kryinka(ph), which means that I\u2019m a devoted Ukrainian, and I\nran away from her. But she persisted and she came back and \u2014 and she took me\nback with her. And Lerna(ph) said the only reason she\u2019s giving me up is because\nshe fi \u2014 felt that I would have a better life with them than with her, because they\ncould give me papers and pencils and I could be educated, whereas she hardly had\nanything. So, my aunt took me, and she took me back to Siberia, to her. And I was\ndevastated. To leave Lerna(ph) was like worse than when I left my parents,\nbecause, I mean, she was everything to me. And \u2014 and I stayed with them, and then\nwhen the Russians said that, you know, Polish citizens can go back, we all went\nback to \u2014 first to \u2014 was, you know a \u2014 a trip from Russia almost took a month, I\nremember. And we came to Poland, Lodz, and then from there to Czechoslovakia,\nfrom Czechoslovakia to Germany, and at that time we were in a DP camp which\nwas called Bad Reichenhall. And that was in Germany. And there we stayed for\nquite awhile. And then my aunt, for whatever reason, she had a sister in the United\nNovember 8, 2008\nStates, so she said \u2014 you know, there was an orphanage called preen \u2014\npreenum(ph) kindsai(ph) in Germany. And she decided to send me and her son,\nher own son Victor, as my brother to this camp, because she wanted us to come to u\n\u2014 the United States, where she had a sister. But unbeknownst to us \u2014 so we were in\nthat camp for about a year, and finally, you know, our quota came through and I\ncame to the United States on a boat called General Black, with my cousin, who\nwas my bra \u2014 you know, like my brother. And when we got to the United States we\ndiscovered that the aunt who was supposed to be like everything to us, prepare a\nhouse for us and money and you know, all the things and take us in and blah, blah,\nblah, but she died away \u2014 she died three weeks before we came.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And \u2014 and she \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to let us know, you know? So, they had a\ndaughter by berni \u2014 by the name of Bernice, she was sic \u2014 all of 16 years old, she\nwas the one that took us, both myself and my cousin, my \u2014 Victor. And they lived\nin Freeport, Long Island at the time. Her f-\u2014 their father was very busy, and it\u2019s\nfunny \u2014 irony that he also had the \u2014 like a candy store, so he was busy night and\nday. And we remained with these \u2014 with this cousin, and you know, with all kinds\nof troubles. I mean, she liked me, she didn\u2019t like him, he had to go live someplace\nelse. But eight months later, my \u2014 the same aunt, Anya and uncle, my father\u2019s\nNovember 8, 2008\nbrother, came to the u \u2014 finally came to the United States, and we sort of became a\nfamily again, whole again, and \u2014",
        "Q: With Victor?",
        "A: With Victor, right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You remember.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And by that time, actually Bernice\u2019s father, by the name of Norman, he got us\nan apartment in the Bronx, and they registered me to school, to high school. I don\u2019t\nknow, I \u2014 I think I lied about my age, cause my cousin was there, so I wanted to be\nin the high school too, and I don\u2019t know, they accepted me, don\u2019t ask me how,\nbecause I really did not have any education whatsoever. How I pulled through, I\ndon\u2019t know, but I did graduate high school.",
        "Q: You know roughly how old you were at that time?",
        "A: When \u2014 when I came here to the States, I was like 12 and a half or 13.",
        "Q: Wow. So six years of suffering, and then \u2014",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Six years, roughly six years of suffering.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "Q: Moving in \u2014 from one place to the other.",
        "A: Oh yeah, right, definitely. I mean, and you know, I can\u2019t tell you everything. I\nmean, like, when I was with Lerna(ph), you know, we \u2014 I used to go to funerals.\nNow I think back of it, because you know, you don\u2019t think about those things. I\nremember going to wakes, you know, because the kids used to have \u2014 on a grenade,\nthey would si \u2014 go on the grenade at \u2014 after the war, even, and blown up and then I\nused to have like nightmares, you know? Nothing, so then I \u2014 you know, went here\nto school, in \u2014 in the Bronx, Taft High School, I graduated, and right after that I\nmet my husband, we got married. He was taken into the army after we got married,\nI was pregnant. So, my son was like \u2014 you know, we got an apartment, I was alone\nfor nine months. When he came back, my son was nine months old, and he was\nactually born in an army hospital in \u2014 where was it? On Staten Island, Governor\u2019s\nIsland, you know.

We\nused to go to congressmen, and to the rabbi and everything to say that, you know,\nI\u2019m alone and I\u2019m with child and I can\u2019t be without him, but nothing helped. But the\njudge delayed it so that he was just away nine months. You know what I mean?\nBecause by the time they process the papers and everything \u2014 he was stationed\nsomeplace in California.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Everything is important. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, you know. So, I lived with one family, and \u2014 and she was very mean to us,\nSO We moved out and we lived with another family, and then finally we got our own\napartment. And the other story is that, miraculously, I found my mother\u2019s sister here\nNovember 8, 2008\nin the States. It\u2019s not that I found her. I remembered something, that there\u2019s an aunt\nin the United States, but I did not know her name, I didn\u2019t know \u2014 you know, New\nYork, number one. There was no way for me to find out anything. But one of our\nlandsmen, who came from our town, it was just this crazy, crazy thing. He was\nwalking on Pitkin Avenue, and he was looking for somebody else. So they \u2014 he wa\n\u2014 went into a tobacco shop, and he was looking for a Mr. Guyer(ph). So he went in\nand he asked him whether he\u2019s related to other Guyers(ph) from \u2014 that were in\nIsrael. So he said no, but then he asked him, where do you come from? And he\nsaid, I come from Dubno. And he said, you know, I have a niece that comes from\nDubno, too. And the niece turned out to be my mother\u2019s sister. And she came, she\nreally saved my life, because when I was all alone with my son, I didn't know\nanything about raising the kid. And she came and she stayed with me, and she\nhelped me, you know, to tell me what to do and, you know, how to feed him and so\non and so forth. And you know, from that time on, we \u2014 we sort of picked ourselves\nup. He came back and he worked in a bakery, then he had this own bakery, and\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s a \u2014 I\u2019d \u2014 I think it\u2019s like \u2014 more or less, in short, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: A short history.",
        "Q: An amazing \u2014 an amazing story, really. During your \u2014\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: Oh, the other thing that I wanted to tell you, which I think is very important,\nbecause after our city was liberated, my mother had, you know, given a few things\nto a Czech woman, because I was like very peculiar, I had to sit in my own seat and\nI had my own chair and all that, and I wouldn\u2019t eat unless it\u2019s my own spoon. So,\nwhen she \u2014 Lerna(ph), the one that saved me, came to this Czech woman, and she\nwanted to say \u2014 to get some things that my mother left with her. She said, you better\nget out of here, or I\u2019m gonna say that you have a chi \u2014 a\u2014 a Jewess with you. But\nthe only thing that she did give me is the spoon, like a soup spoon, which I have to\nthis day. And I don\u2019t know if you want to ask me anything else.",
        "Q: Yes. I\u2019d like to know if you ever went back to Dubno?",

        "A: No, I never went back, no.",
        "Q: And wha \u2014 did you ever hear again from Lerna(ph)?",
        "A: So this \u2014 from Le-Lerna(ph)? Since I married, forever, I\u2019ve been sending her\nmoney and packages and we \u2014 I| have beautiful letters from her, beautiful. And, you\nknow, I was like \u2014 you know, we ourselves were very poor, I couldn\u2019t take her here,\nso I never saw her again. But we \u2014 I have a lot of correspondence with her, and we\nhelped her as much as possible, and I have pictures of her. And what happened, she,\nNovember 8, 2008\nof course, eventually passed away. And her sister Anya, with whom I lived towards\nthe end of the war, the one that was hit on the shrapnel, when Lerna(ph) died, I\nbecame her surrogate, more or less, you know, sending her things. And now that she\nwas passed away, I\u2019m \u2014 to this day, in fact I have now a package again to send to\nher daughter. And the daughter lives in Lviv \u2014 Lvov, the u \u2014 the Ukraine. And she\njust called me the other day, so I\u2019ve always been sending money, packages, and I\u2019ve\nalways been in touch with her.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I have one last \u2014",
        "A: The only thing that I didn\u2019t do, and I really regret it, I guess maybe it\u2019s not too\nlate, she was a Righteous Gentile and I somehow never went to Yad Vashem to\nreport that.",
        "Q: Well, you can still do that.",
        "A: Yeah, I was gonna say that I could still do that. But, you know, being \u2014 we were\nyoung, we were s \u2014 you know, struggling ourselves, raising the children.",
        "Q: Under such circumstances, yeah.",
        "A: And I wasn\u2019t \u2014 you know, I wasn\u2019t such a big hero, you know what I mean?\nLike, I don\u2019t know, we just neglected it, I guess. But I didn\u2019t neglect her. I just\nNovember 8, 2008\nneglected to, you know, make it \u2014 and I never talked about it, now fi \u2014 finally we\ntalk about it. I never talked to my children, I have three children, six grandchildren,\nand I din \u2014I did not like to talk about it.

And | had a sister by the name of Pearl. I was the middle child, my name\nwas Shifra in Yiddish, and then I had a younger sister that was Bella.\nNovember 8, 2008",

        "A: The older sister must have gone to school, but I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: But I\u2019m sure she did, because she was much older. Like, I was closer to the\nyounger one, you know, and there was probably quite a few difference between the\nolder and myself and my younger sister.",

But the truth is, I don\u2019t know. And the\nyounger sister was wa \u2014 not too \u2014 too much younger than I was.",
        "A: About the home life I don\u2019t remember too much. We lived in a very beautiful\nstreet by the name of Panienska. And I know that the fi \u2014 people who know\nanything about Dubno, and if you tell them Panienska street, they know that that\nwas a very beautiful street. My parents had like a little \u2014 I would say they called it a\nNovember 8, 2008\nkiosk, like they was having candy and things like that. So my parents were hardly at\nhome. But they had one of \u2014 a\u2014 a-\u2014a Christian, actually a Ukrainian woman by the\nname of Lerna(ph), and she was raising us. She was really more like my mother \u2014\nlike a mother to me than my own mother, because she was always with the girls, my\nmother was busy in the store. So, I loved her very much, and she loved the children.\nShe was very devoted person to us. And in fact, she was the one that saved me, at\nthe end. So, too much about the life before that, I don\u2019t remember too much. But I\ndo remember when the Germans came in, and I\u2019ll never forget one of my cousins\ncame and they said, you know, you have to leave your home, and we have to all\nmove to a ghetto, which was a Dubno ghetto. And then wi \u2014 all of \u2014 the whole\nfamily, like my mo \u2014I remember my grandmother was there and my father\u2019s\nbrother also lived there, and they had many children, like at least four or five\nchildren.

        "A: Well, to tell you the truth, I didn\u2019t see Germans until I was in the ghetto, and\nthen I did see Germans. They used to come every once in awhile, they would say \u2014\nyou know, they used to call it an oblava(ph), which means like \u2014 you know, they\nwould decide that they would \u2014 gonna come into the ghetto, and let\u2019s say, whoever\nwas outside, they would kill.

But, you know, I know we lived\nin the si \u2014 all th \u2014 all in the same house, you know, in \u2014 in the ghetto. And in the\nghetto, I don\u2019t know, I remember playing like outside a little bit with, you know,\nother kids. And \u2014 and then I also remember that m-my uncle and my father, they\nmade like a hiding place. They called it a schron, which means like an underground\nbunker, I would say a bunker. And whenever there was rumors that the Germans are\ncoming, or that the end was gonna come or whatever, we used to hide in that place.\nAnd once it was over, everybody came out. So I do remember that.",

        "A: Everybody.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: What happened afterwards, of course you know the life in the ghetto was a \u2014\npretty miserable. I remember even I \u2014 I \u2014 I'll never forget that one day we were\noutside and the Germans came, and I remember they took like a little kid, and they\nthrew them in the barrel of water, like rainwater, you know, the barrels used to\ncollect rainwater? And that image stayed with me for a long time. But what\nhappened is, towards the end, I remembered also again, people came \u2014 well, first of\nall, you know my father was in touch with le -- Lerna(ph), that\u2019s the nanny that I\nwas telling you about. And what happened was, the ghetto was built by Jews, and\nthey were built by planks, you know, there were planks? And they like left one\nplank open, and she used to come and ge \u2014 bring us food. And one time she actually\ncame and said that she wanted to take me, and you know, to save me, and \u2014 and \u2014\nand so on. And she did take me out of the ghetto, I don\u2019t remember how, but I\nremember that my father was like crying when I left. And in the middle of the night,\nshe took me to her place where she lived, not too far away from the ghetto.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I always wondered. I always wondered. That\u2019s something that I\nalways, always have in mind, why me, you know? But I think that what happened,\nthat it was circumstances, because we \u2014 yeah, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know really why.\nBut the first time that she took me out, in the middle of the night, I sort of got \u2014 got\nscared, you know, that I\u2019m away from my parents, so I came back by myself, I\ndon\u2019t know how.",
        "A: \u2019'm maybe seven years old.",
        "A: And I came back and I still remember that at the ghetto gate, they used to have\nJewish, I don\u2019t know, I want to call them policemen, but guards, let\u2019s say guards.\nAnd I still remember that one of them said, look at her, she\u2019s coming from the\noutside and she didn\u2019t bring anything. Cause all I did was, you know, just come\nhome. And this Lerna(ph), who was the one that, you know, I was with, woke up in\nthe morning and I was gone, and she was like really panicky. So she came to the\nghetto and she said to my father, I don\u2019t know what happened, I don\u2019t have the\nchild. And he said, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s here. So that\u2019s \u2014 I remained in the ghetto with\nmy family, until the very end when they announced an akeja \u2014 an akcja mean \u2014\nmeant that they were liquidating the ghetto.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: Well, we were occupied in \u201941, and this must have been, I don\u2019t know. To \u2014 to\ntell you the truth, I don\u2019t know exactly whether it was a year or two later.",
        "A: Whatever the ghetto, you know, that probably could be documented. But I do\nremember that somebody came to my father and said, listen, Lerna(ph) 1s at the\ngate, you know, because we were all gated in. It\u2019s not like today\u2019s gated\ncommunities, yeah. And they said, you know, if you have a \u2014 a child, just, you\nknow, throw her out, like bring her out. So I remembered like they picked me up\nphysically and brought me to the gate. By that time the Germans were already \u2014\nthey were on their way to come to liquidate the ghetto. And she was waiting for me,\nshe took me by the hand like this, and we started walking, just walking. And I \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know, I was just very pliable, I guess, and this time I just went with her. And\nin fact, on the way \u2014 on the way, as we were walking, we were caught by the\nUkrainian police, and we were taken into a pla \u2014 a room, and I remember sitting\nwith her, just like today, like she was sitting and I was sitting. And the policeman\nwas called away for some reason. There was a woman scrubbing the floor and she\nsaid, what are you sitting here? Go. He\u2019s not here, get out of here. And so she took\nme again by the hand and she \u2014 we walked out of there, which was again a miracle,\nNovember 8, 2008\nI guess in Jewish you would say bashert. And we just walked and walked and\nwalked until we hitchhiked. We hitchhiked, and she had a brother that lived on a\nfarm, I don\u2019t know how many kilometers away, because I have no idea of things\nlike this. We came to her brother, and I remember she put me up like in a part\nwhere, you know, nobody could see me. And I was there for maybe a week or so, I\ndon\u2019t know how long either, because I have no \u2014 I had no perception of time\nwhatsoever. And after awhile the brother said to her, listen, you can\u2019t stay here,\nbecause if they discover that you have a Jewess here, then you know what\u2019s gonna\nhappen, we\u2019re all gonna get killed. So \u2014",
        "A: No, that al \u2014",
        "A: It was a farm.",
        "A: Definitely a farm. I\u2019m \u2014 he lived there, you know, with his wife, I guess, and \u2014\nand her mother was still alive, I remember that. You know, an older woman.",
        "A: No, I\u2014I was just like \u2014 they used to say, like an apprivichik(ph), I don\u2019t know\nhow to explain it, but they had like a wooden stove, and then on top used to be like\nwarm, you know? And I remember s \u2014 being there, like cooped up, you know,\nhidden. And so she said, you know what? I'll go back and I\u2019Il see, because you\nknow, she didn't know what happened. So I remember she went away for a day or\nso, whatever, I don\u2019t know how long it took. And when she came back she said, I\ncan\u2019t take her back because nobody\u2019s there any more, they\u2019re all killed.",
        "A: She went back to the family, to the ghetto, and the ghetto by that time was\ncompletely liquidated, nobody was there. So she came back and then she had\nanother sister that lived also on a farm, but the farm was called the a houtur(ph)\nwhich means that it was isolated. It was like the farm, and then it was nobody all\naround, you know, not too many people around. So we stayed with that sister for\nquite awhile. And I don\u2019t know what I was doing, I remember going out with the\ncows, or with the horses and you know, li \u2014 she had one son, and it was very good\nto me. I would \u2014 never had any suffering, I never had \u2014 I was never hungry, because\non a farm, you know? And this woman, Lerna(ph) who took me, she was like crazy\nabout me, and I loved her so much, that she was everything to me, you know?\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: And I was very lucky, because I was beloved by her, so I didn\u2019t feel \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nfeel like, you know, like I was trash and something like that. And I don\u2019t know how\nlong we stayed there. We stayed there for quite awhile. And then she had another\nsister by the name of Anya, and she lived in the city, which was not any more the\ncity of Dubno, but it was called Rovna. Was Rovna, let\u2019s see, what was it? No, not\nRovna. | \u2014 I have to think of the name. In Russian it was called Krasnoarmiisk.\nBut really, 1t was Radziwillow, you know, and th \u2014 when the Russians were there\nbecause it was constantly Russian, Polish, German, Russian. So it was\nRadziwill\u00e9w. And there we had an apartment, and I lived with Lerna(ph) and her\nsister Anya. And in fact, you know, when the Russians came, they \u2014 the bombings\nwere there and we were like in a \u2014 sort of in a bunker hiding from the bombs, and\nher sister was hit with the shrapnel in her arm; I was sitting right next to her. And I\nremember there was a certain flower on the table, that for years afterwards I\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 cause the mingling with the blood and everything, I couldn\u2019t smell those\nflowers, you know, like every time I s \u2014 had those flowers, I s \u2014 like nauseous. And\nyou know, during the time, I can\u2019t like tell you everything. The way I went to\nchurch, and you know, wearing the cross and I used to play with the kids, and some\nof the kids said that I\u2019m a \u2014 a-\u2014a Jewess, you know, and she denied it because she\nsaid that I was her child, that\u2019s how I survived, as a child of Lerna(ph).\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, but at night she used to remind me, because she was so wonderful that I\ncan\u2019t even begin to tell you. And I didn't want to \u2014 I \u2014 be \u2014 be reminded that I\u2019m\nJewish, I really didn\u2019t want to, you know, but at night she kept saying to me, you\nknow, I don\u2019t remember if she talked Jewish to me or something, couple of words,\nwhatever. But yes, I was running around as a Christian girl. And \u2014 and, you know,\nso then after the war, when \u2014 not \u2014 it wasn\u2019t really after the war, it was just a time\nwhen our town was liberated. So I had an uncle, my father\u2019s brother, his wife and\ntheir son, they were saved in Russia and they lived in Siberia. So, they had written\nto our town, if there\u2019s anybody left from \u2014 my maiden name was Leviatin(ph) \u2014\nLev -- Leviatin(ph), but you know, you have to s \u2014 in English it\u2019s Leviatin(ph). So\nshe had written to somebody, I don\u2019t know to whom, and they said they think that\none child was left. And on that score, she came all the way from Siberia, and she\nmet me. I was at that time running like to school, and she met me on the street, and\nshe said, oh my God, you know, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m Janyet(ph), her name was Janyet(ph),\nand \u2014 and I \u2014\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: She was my aunt through marriage. Her husband and my father were brothers.",
        "A: And I ran away from her. I said, I\u2019m not Jewish, I\u2019m a Ukrainian. \u2019m\u2014I-\u2014Pma\ndevoted \u2014 I even remember, because she reminded me. I didn\u2019t remember that, but\nshe reminded me afterwards that I said, I\u2019m \u2014 you know, like an \u2014 in Russian I said,\nI\u2019m a steeron(ph) kryinka(ph), which means that I\u2019m a devoted Ukrainian, and I\nran away from her. But she persisted and she came back and \u2014 and she took me\nback with her. And Lerna(ph) said the only reason she\u2019s giving me up is because\nshe fi \u2014 felt that I would have a better life with them than with her, because they\ncould give me papers and pencils and I could be educated, whereas she hardly had\nanything. So, my aunt took me, and she took me back to Siberia, to her. And I was\ndevastated. To leave Lerna(ph) was like worse than when I left my parents,\nbecause, I mean, she was everything to me. And \u2014 and I stayed with them, and then\nwhen the Russians said that, you know, Polish citizens can go back, we all went\nback to \u2014 first to \u2014 was, you know a \u2014 a trip from Russia almost took a month, I\nremember. And we came to Poland, Lodz, and then from there to Czechoslovakia,\nfrom Czechoslovakia to Germany, and at that time we were in a DP camp which\nwas called Bad Reichenhall. And that was in Germany. And there we stayed for\nquite awhile. And then my aunt, for whatever reason, she had a sister in the United\nNovember 8, 2008\nStates, so she said \u2014 you know, there was an orphanage called preen \u2014\npreenum(ph) kindsai(ph) in Germany. And she decided to send me and her son,\nher own son Victor, as my brother to this camp, because she wanted us to come to u\n\u2014 the United States, where she had a sister. But unbeknownst to us \u2014 so we were in\nthat camp for about a year, and finally, you know, our quota came through and I\ncame to the United States on a boat called General Black, with my cousin, who\nwas my bra \u2014 you know, like my brother. And when we got to the United States we\ndiscovered that the aunt who was supposed to be like everything to us, prepare a\nhouse for us and money and you know, all the things and take us in and blah, blah,\nblah, but she died away \u2014 she died three weeks before we came.",
        "A: And \u2014 and she \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to let us know, you know? So, they had a\ndaughter by berni \u2014 by the name of Bernice, she was sic \u2014 all of 16 years old, she\nwas the one that took us, both myself and my cousin, my \u2014 Victor. And they lived\nin Freeport, Long Island at the time. Her f-\u2014 their father was very busy, and it\u2019s\nfunny \u2014 irony that he also had the \u2014 like a candy store, so he was busy night and\nday. And we remained with these \u2014 with this cousin, and you know, with all kinds\nof troubles. I mean, she liked me, she didn\u2019t like him, he had to go live someplace\nelse. But eight months later, my \u2014 the same aunt, Anya and uncle, my father\u2019s\nNovember 8, 2008\nbrother, came to the u \u2014 finally came to the United States, and we sort of became a\nfamily again, whole again, and \u2014",
        "A: With Victor, right.",
        "A: You remember.",
        "A: And by that time, actually Bernice\u2019s father, by the name of Norman, he got us\nan apartment in the Bronx, and they registered me to school, to high school. I don\u2019t\nknow, I \u2014 I think I lied about my age, cause my cousin was there, so I wanted to be\nin the high school too, and I don\u2019t know, they accepted me, don\u2019t ask me how,\nbecause I really did not have any education whatsoever. How I pulled through, I\ndon\u2019t know, but I did graduate high school.",
        "A: When \u2014 when I came here to the States, I was like 12 and a half or 13.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Oh, yeah.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: Oh yeah, right, definitely. I mean, and you know, I can\u2019t tell you everything. I\nmean, like, when I was with Lerna(ph), you know, we \u2014 I used to go to funerals.\nNow I think back of it, because you know, you don\u2019t think about those things. I\nremember going to wakes, you know, because the kids used to have \u2014 on a grenade,\nthey would si \u2014 go on the grenade at \u2014 after the war, even, and blown up and then I\nused to have like nightmares, you know? Nothing, so then I \u2014 you know, went here\nto school, in \u2014 in the Bronx, Taft High School, I graduated, and right after that I\nmet my husband, we got married. He was taken into the army after we got married,\nI was pregnant. So, my son was like \u2014 you know, we got an apartment, I was alone\nfor nine months. When he came back, my son was nine months old, and he was\nactually born in an army hospital in \u2014 where was it? On Staten Island, Governor\u2019s\nIsland, you know. And I \u2014 you know, I mean, you can\u2019t tell everything, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you can imagine my feelings. I used to go to the army doctors, and I didn't\nknow anything about children, cause I was never around children, I never knew\nanything about it. And I mean, crying like Niagara Falls every single day. And I\ndon\u2019t know, somehow you survive, you know.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: You \u2014 you mean my husband?",
        "A: Well, na \u2014 yeah, well what happened was, we tried to postpone his service. We\nused to go to congressmen, and to the rabbi and everything to say that, you know,\nI\u2019m alone and I\u2019m with child and I can\u2019t be without him, but nothing helped. But the\njudge delayed it so that he was just away nine months. You know what I mean?\nBecause by the time they process the papers and everything \u2014 he was stationed\nsomeplace in California.",
        "A: When he came back, my son was already nine months old. And I don\u2019t know,\nslowly but surely, I mean, there\u2019s other things, you know. When we got married we\nlived in a one room apartment by other people, and you know, it\u2019s \u2014 all these things\nare \u2014 I don\u2019t know how important they are to this conversation.",
        "A: Well, you know. So, I lived with one family, and \u2014 and she was very mean to us,\nSO We moved out and we lived with another family, and then finally we got our own\napartment. And the other story is that, miraculously, I found my mother\u2019s sister here\nNovember 8, 2008\nin the States. It\u2019s not that I found her. I remembered something, that there\u2019s an aunt\nin the United States, but I did not know her name, I didn\u2019t know \u2014 you know, New\nYork, number one. There was no way for me to find out anything. But one of our\nlandsmen, who came from our town, it was just this crazy, crazy thing. He was\nwalking on Pitkin Avenue, and he was looking for somebody else. So they \u2014 he wa\n\u2014 went into a tobacco shop, and he was looking for a Mr. Guyer(ph). So he went in\nand he asked him whether he\u2019s related to other Guyers(ph) from \u2014 that were in\nIsrael. So he said no, but then he asked him, where do you come from? And he\nsaid, I come from Dubno. And he said, you know, I have a niece that comes from\nDubno, too. And the niece turned out to be my mother\u2019s sister. And she came, she\nreally saved my life, because when I was all alone with my son, I didn't know\nanything about raising the kid. And she came and she stayed with me, and she\nhelped me, you know, to tell me what to do and, you know, how to feed him and so\non and so forth. And you know, from that time on, we \u2014 we sort of picked ourselves\nup. He came back and he worked in a bakery, then he had this own bakery, and\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s a \u2014 I\u2019d \u2014 I think it\u2019s like \u2014 more or less, in short, you know.",
        "A: A short history.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: Oh, the other thing that I wanted to tell you, which I think is very important,\nbecause after our city was liberated, my mother had, you know, given a few things\nto a Czech woman, because I was like very peculiar, I had to sit in my own seat and\nI had my own chair and all that, and I wouldn\u2019t eat unless it\u2019s my own spoon. So,\nwhen she \u2014 Lerna(ph), the one that saved me, came to this Czech woman, and she\nwanted to say \u2014 to get some things that my mother left with her. She said, you better\nget out of here, or I\u2019m gonna say that you have a chi \u2014 a\u2014 a Jewess with you. But\nthe only thing that she did give me is the spoon, like a soup spoon, which I have to\nthis day. And I don\u2019t know if you want to ask me anything else.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I never went back, no.",
        "A: So this \u2014 from Le-Lerna(ph)? Since I married, forever, I\u2019ve been sending her\nmoney and packages and we \u2014 I| have beautiful letters from her, beautiful. And, you\nknow, I was like \u2014 you know, we ourselves were very poor, I couldn\u2019t take her here,\nso I never saw her again. But we \u2014 I have a lot of correspondence with her, and we\nhelped her as much as possible, and I have pictures of her. And what happened, she,\nNovember 8, 2008\nof course, eventually passed away. And her sister Anya, with whom I lived towards\nthe end of the war, the one that was hit on the shrapnel, when Lerna(ph) died, I\nbecame her surrogate, more or less, you know, sending her things. And now that she\nwas passed away, I\u2019m \u2014 to this day, in fact I have now a package again to send to\nher daughter. And the daughter lives in Lviv \u2014 Lvov, the u \u2014 the Ukraine. And she\njust called me the other day, so I\u2019ve always been sending money, packages, and I\u2019ve\nalways been in touch with her.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The only thing that I didn\u2019t do, and I really regret it, I guess maybe it\u2019s not too\nlate, she was a Righteous Gentile and I somehow never went to Yad Vashem to\nreport that.",
        "A: Yeah, I was gonna say that I could still do that. But, you know, being \u2014 we were\nyoung, we were s \u2014 you know, struggling ourselves, raising the children.",
        "A: And I wasn\u2019t \u2014 you know, I wasn\u2019t such a big hero, you know what I mean?\nLike, I don\u2019t know, we just neglected it, I guess. But I didn\u2019t neglect her. I just\nNovember 8, 2008\nneglected to, you know, make it \u2014 and I never talked about it, now fi \u2014 finally we\ntalk about it. I never talked to my children, I have three children, six grandchildren,\nand I din \u2014I did not like to talk about it. But I think now, sort of, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s\namaze \u2014 I\u2019m amazed myself that I\u2019m even talking.",
