        "A: In talking to you, I realize my parents must have really, really \u2014 not wanted us\nexposed. I mean, that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting from this conversation. Kwi \u2014 otherwise\nI\u2019d know more, wouldn\u2019t I?",

        "Q: Okay. So, bring me up to the point where, you know, when you\u2019re discussing\nthings earlier, 1t sounds like it was as a family that you were trying to fi \u2014 everyone\nwas trying to find a way to get out.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: All right. How did things progress that it ended up being just the two of you, the\ntwo girls?\nApril 27, 2017",
        "A: Well, if \u2014 as I recall, totally my mother\u2019s doing, cause we were \u2014 I thought we\nwere the last children\u2019s transport, but I\u2019ve since learned we were the one before.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But my mother did that with the rabbi. And he met us when we got to England,\nand we were put in what they called the hostel, but what it was, that they had these\nhomes where usually a couple, which is where we stayed, they took in.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come to that.",
        "A: Oh, okay.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m thinking more of before you\u2019re leaving. At what\npoint did the decision come that it will just be the two of you, and not your mother\nand father together?",
        "A: Because they couldn\u2019t get out.",
        "Q: Okay. And was your father okay with you and your sister leaving?",
        "A: I guess, because we did.",
        "Q: Do you \u2014 did they ac \u2014 do you remember when you said goodbye to them? Did\nyou remember\u2019?",
        "A: Very vividly.",
        "Q: Tell me about that.\nApril 27, 2017",
        "A: They \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s just so unbelievable. You know, it all happ \u2014 I think it all\nhappened pretty quickly, actually.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they took us to the train station, we got on the train, and at the \u2014",
        "Q: Did your \u2014 mm-hm?",
        "A: \u2014 at the time, we were hoping we would meet them again, because there was a\nplan that they were supposed to come to England, meet us, and then come to\nAmerica. We wer \u2014 there \u2014 there was such a plan. And when war broke out, of\ncourse, a month later, I mean, everything stopped.",
        "Q: Then it means \u2014 excuse me, I\u2019m going to step back a bit, you\u2019re right. War broke\nout September 1*', 1939, which means Kristallnacht was ni \u2014 November 38.\nThat\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: I keep getting mixed up with those two dates. So, when did you leave Berlin, at\nwhat point was this? Was this still \u00b039?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay, so it must have been \u2014",
        "A: August.",
        "Q: August of \u00b039.\nApril 27, 2017\nA2: It was August of 39. It was right before the war.",
        "Q: Right before the war, right before the war. So \u2014 so yes, you were \u2014 you were\nthere during Kristallnacht, and then it must have been all of the efforts to try to get\nyou out.",
        "A: Quickly.",
        "Q: Yeah, quickly. And \u2014 and then they would come, and of course, if war breaks out\nSeptember first, then \u2014",
        "A: That was the end of that.",
        "Q: Okay. Did you have letters back and forth with them?",
        "A: I have a couple of letters, and the last one is in the papers that I have for you \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 from the Red Cross.",
        "Q: Okay. How long did the letters \u2014 and what were the final dates of those letters?",
        "A: I\u2014 we'd have to look.",
        "Q: We'll look later. We\u2019ll look later. I mean, when I ask for things like dates, I\nknow that most of the time, one wouldn\u2019t remember. But I ask anyway.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Those are the \u2014 the hardest things to remember.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s one other, I think, important element.\nApril 27, 2017",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Which is, my parents were in hiding, and they survived til \u2014 I think it was \u00b045,\nwasn\u2019t it?\nA2: Forty-four.",
        "A: Forty-four.",
        "Q: Your parents survived until 1944.",
        "A: They did. That\u2019s what\u2019s so tragic. They would \u2014 they almost made it. And they\nwere in hiding by non-Jews.",
        "Q: Do you know who\u2019?",
        "A: No. And then another Jew told about their hiding place, hoping it would save his\nlife, and they were all taken, including the people who hid them. So the tragedy is,\nthey almost made it. I mean, they survived.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. So when you were saying that your father was never sent to a\nconcentration camp, 1-it was \u2014 it was that he went into hiding, so that \u2014",
        "A: Well, fir \u2014 we just learned that first, when Kurt [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Wrote that, yeah.",
        "A: And saw them last, he \u2014 they took my father to work for the war effort, in a\nfactory.April 27, 2017\nA2: Because he was a chemist, he ended up working in some \u2014 some chemical\ncompany that was considered part of the war effort.",
        "Q: So your fath \u2014 okay, let\u2019s repeat that so that we hear it on \u2014 on tape, is that your\nfather was actually not only not deported, but taken to work as a chemist.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And was your mother in hiding as he \u2014 when he was doing that?",
        "A: Well, my mother was still living in the apartment when Kurt went to visit them.",
        "Q: So tell us now about Kurt Roberg, and how his story intersects with your\nparents.",
        "A: His \u2014",
        "Q: Who is Kurt Roberg?",
        "A: Kurt Roberg was a close friend of my aunt\u2019s, and his mother. They lived in this\nrelatively small town, Celle.",
        "Q: Celle, uh-huh.",

        "Q: Which aunt?",
        "A: Berta(ph).",
        "Q: Berta(ph).",
        "A: The one who was the most important person in \u2014\nApril 27, 2017",

        "A: \u2014 my life.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And they remained friends, and he \u2014 his mother and my Aunt Berta(ph) were\nvery close. And their lives kind of intersected. And \u2014",
        "Q: And Kurt then, how did \u2014 how did he come to be in Berlin to visit your parents?",
        "A: Because they were friends.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And he was mo \u2014 leaving from Holland. He left after the war \u2014",
        "Q: So he did \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 started.",
        "Q: Oh, he left after the war started.",
        "A: So he was in Holland.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then trying to get to America, and en route, he was in Berlin. And that\u2019s\nwhat we were reading about yesterday, and you can read it in there.",
        "Q: Tell us about what it was that he writes, so that we\u2019 ll have it on camera.",
        "A: Well, could \u2014 Stephen, you could \u2014 do you mind doing that?\nA2: I think they want to hear it from you.\nApril 27, 2017",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: My reading is \u2014",
        "Q: It is \u2014 do you remember the details of it?",
        "A: Only what he wrote.",
        "Q: Only what he wrote. Okay, so let\u2019s do that, at least. Okay.",
        "A: I hate to tell you, my eyes aren\u2019t that great.",
        "Q: Well, as much as you can, you know.",
        "A: Okay. \u201c[indecipherable] the news from Amsterdam about our transit visas was\nnot very encouraging.\u201d",

        "A: Yeah, I think I want \u2014 [break]",
        "Q: Okay, okay, during \u2014",
        "A: \u201cMy first weeks in Berlin, when we had already become \u2014 when it had already\nbecome clear that I would not leave according to my original schedule, I planned to\nvisit the sister of Berta(ph) Solomon(ph), Rosie Coen(ph), my mother, who lived\nin Berlin. Remembered how helpful the Coens had been to my father when he and\nHans Solomon(ph) \u2014 many siblings were \u2014 were married to Leo Coen(ph), my\nfather. It \u2014 a pharmacist, the Coens had two little girls, Doris and Hannah(ph), who\nthey had managed to send to England with the last Kindertransport, in AugustApril 27, 2017\n1939, days before the outbreak of the war. Rosie and Leo Coen, unable to leave,\nremained in Berlin, and so now that I was here, I planned to visit. My mother had\nstayed in contact with Hans and Berta(ph), who like my release from K2,\u201d\nwhatever that is, \u201cthe only place opened to them was Shanghai, and through the\nSuez canal to China, I had gotten their address from my mother, before she left for\nAmerica. You never knew where you would end up, so it was good to have\ncontacts, and keep up connections with landsleute.\u201d",
        "Q: Yeah, people from your country.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Fellow countrymen.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Overmen. \u201cSo, one afternoon, I made my way \u2014 my way to Berlin,\nBierstich(ph) Gardner Strasse, and the pharmacy was, of course, no longer owned\nby Leo Coen. It had been Aryanized after KristallInacht. So when I came to the\napartment, only Rosie was at home. She was surprised to see me, because I had\ncome unexpected, but had brought along some tea that,\u201d oh, his mother, I guess\n\u201chad sent to me. Remembering my mother always reminded me never to come\nempty handed. And ...\u201d I[\u2014I\u2019m sorry, my eyes \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 27, 2017",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: \u2014 are not so good with this. \u201c\u201cWhen our respective family histories, Rosie was\nhappy to hear that my parents and brother were already in America, and that I was\non my way as well. Of her 10 brothers and sisters, Rosie was the only one who had\nnot been able to emigrate. Her husband Leo, a trained pharmacist, was now working\nin a chemical factory that was making war materials. I understand that, as such, he\nwould never get a permit to leave. He was now a member of the war essential work\nforce, assigned to work far beneath his qualifications, at wages set arbitrar \u2014\narbitrarily by the Nazis. Since the war had started in September 1939, Rosie had\nheard only sporadically about their two girls, Doris and Hannah(ph), since they\nhad left for England. Direct communication between England and Germany was\nno longer possible, and it will come directly through friends or relatives in neutral\nplaces, like America, or Shanghai, or some South American countries. I had met\nDoris about five years earlier, when she was visiting her Aunt Berta(ph) in Celle,\nand I was happy that she and Hannah(ph) were safely in England. I was also glad\nto have made this visit to her mother, because she and her husband had helped my\nfather.\u201d",
        "Q: So this is the last \u2014 this is the last sort of witness report \u2014",
        "A: Yes.April 27, 2017",

        "Q: \u2014 from Kurt.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay. And then after that you learn that \u2014 you learn after the war, that they went\ninto hiding.",
        "A: Yes. My father had a friend who worked for the American government.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And it was really much later that he \u2014 he was able to go to Germany before, you\nknow, a lot of the history was discovered. And he\u2019s the one \u2014 but we were already\nhere.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And it was much later. He\u2019s the one who found out what happened, and let my\naunt know, and us know.",
        "Q: So, it was years later. Do you ever \u2014 did he ever tell you the name of the \u2014 there\nis a German term for the Jews \u2014 and there were some very famous ones in Berlin,\nwho, in trying to save their own lives, would betray other Jews in hiding. Whether it\nwas schnauper(ph) or \u2014 some sort of a \u2014 a term for them.",
        "A: Right.\nApril 27, 2017",
        "Q: Did you ever find out the name of the person who betrayed them?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: As well as \u2014 you never knew the names of the people who had saved them?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: And then, do you know what happened to your parents, in the sense of how they\ndied?",
        "A: When, years later, my sister, her husband and I, we went to Berlin, and we \u2014 we\ntried to find, you know, the records, and we learned that they were sent to\nAuschwitz. And we have the dates, that\u2019s in \u2014 in the papers there. My sister found\nthat out.",
        "Q: Okay. And then that was pretty late.",
        "A: That was late. And that \u2014 I have that for you, in the papers.",
        "Q: Thank you. Thank you. It takes such a long time to piece just these few\nfragments of details.",
        "A: I know.",
        "Q: You know? I can\u2019t imagine what it was like for you not to know.",
        "A: Well, you \u2014 you know, a couple of things happened when we went to England.\nIt \u2014 because war broke out, they evacuated the entire school. So all of the English\nkids who were in our school, were in the exactly the same position as we were. So it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 27, 2017\nwasn\u2019t as traumatic, it wasn\u2019t like we were the only ones who were separated from\nour parents. It was, they put the school on a train, they sent you to these remote\nplaces, where mostly really poor people had volunteered to take the children, and\nthey got some money. So, you get off the train. They walk you down \u2014 down the\nstreet, knock on the door, here are two kids, here are two kids. And we \u2014 we were\nall \u2014 the English kids were in exactly the same position.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a shared experience in some ways.",
        "A: So it wasn\u2019t like we were the only \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 non-English speaking German sad little girls, because all the other kids were in\nthe same position. And then \u2014 so \u2014 and then we still had hope that, you know, my\nparents, we were going to get together.",
        "Q: Yes. That\u2019s early on?",
        "A: It was early on, and there was hope that they \u2014 we would meet, and all come to\nAmerica together. I think that kind of saved the total shock. The other thing that\nhappened is \u2014 course, we didn\u2019t speak the language. So, there were a few German\nkids, and they sent us to whatever the local school was. I practically had no\neducation.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about in the countryside.April 27, 2017",
        "A: In the countryside. So the German kids stuck together, and then the teacher\nseparated us, so that we would speak English. And the funniest thing happened.\nBecause one of the German kids, somebody said to her, where \u2014 you know, where\ndid you get your accent from? She picked up my accent. So, you know, was really\nfunny, because she sounded more German than \u2014",
        "Q: Than you did.",
        "A: \u2014 than I did. And of course, we had to learn English.",
        "Q: Of course. Of course.",
        "A: And then it was a crazy time, because \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019 ve watched\nany of this, or this German stuff coming back now. We spent half our time in air\nraid shelters. We basically had no education.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s loop back a little bit then, to the very beginning of your time in \u2014 in\nGermany \u2014 in \u2014 in Britain. You went by train?",

        "A: Yes, very much so.",
        "Q: And it probably \u2014 I\u2019m interpreting here, but I\u2019m \u2014 probably helped you during\nthis \u2014 these times when you didn\u2019t have your parents.\nApril 27, 2017",
        "A: I think so. Cause there wasn\u2019t much \u2014 you know, wherever we lived in England,\nthey were all non-Jewish, I mean, all the families were not Jewish. I think the only\nJewish family is the girl that I lived with in the end. I\u2019m sure they were Jewish.",

        "A: \u20141in\u2014I\u2014Thave those papers somewhere. And she \u2014 she was tiny, but she kept\nthe entire large family together. And she was never going to go to Germany, hated\neverything German. But then she got this offer to go to Fulda, where they were\nrecreating the Hebrew school that they went to. There weren\u2019t any Jews left, but \u2014\nbut Fulda, and the mayor, and you know, they\u2019re part of the restitution. And a\nwhole lot of us went. I \u2014",

        "A: We just went through that.",
        "Q: I think we did, but I\u2019d like to ground this chronologically. Was this where you\nsaid your daughter was three years old, and now she\u2019s \u2014\nA2: It was 1987.",
        "Q: 1987. Okay. So 19 eight \u2014",
        "A: And that was actually very meaningful for everybody.\nA2: It was \u2014 we went back in May of 1987.",
        "Q: And did you \u2014 was this the first time you were back in Germany\u2019",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. So tell me about that trip.",
        "A: Well, first of all, it was really interesting, because my aunt, who said she\u2019d never\ngo, since I was free, and \u2014 her family was going. There were a whole lot of us. A lot\nof her sisters and brothers of my family. We \u2014 we were a whole group. And it \u2014 it\nwas very meaningful to the family as a group, because you know, Steven came, my\ncousins from \u2014 Berta\u2019s(ph) own children came. Other children from these 11\noffspring came. And \u2014 and it was very well organized. I mean, we met in the\nschloss, which wasn\u2019t hurt at all. Fulda is very historic, so \u2014\nApril 27, 2017",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 it was interesting.",
        "Q: Yes, it\u2019s a pretty city.",
        "A: Because, you know, it wasn\u2019t really demolished, I mean, so it had a lot of the\noriginal history. And so many people came from Israel, from all over the place.\nAnd then there\u2019s just a small, funny aside, and a lot of religious people cou \u2014 course\nit was \u2014 the mayor, and another person who\u2019d come from Israel, I mean, they \u2014\nthey worked it out. And the people who went to this school were paid for, but all the\nrelatives who came, we all paid for ourselves.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So it turned out to be a much bigger group than they were expecting. Lufthansa\nca-catered the kosher food. That to me was such an irony, because they were\nunprepared for, you know, the many people that would show up.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And I think for Steven \u2014",
        "Q: Your son.",
        "A: \u2014 it was really important. And \u2014",
        "Q: How was it meaningful for you?\nApril 27, 2017",
        "A: For me it was meaningful because I had refused to speak German. In fact, I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 I never talked it. So when we got the first day \u2014 I had a ca \u2014 bad \u2014 my aunt\nhad a daughter who was very interested in keeping in touch with whatever groups\nthere were. Unfortunately, she\u2019s not alive any more. But she had written to Judith\nMiller.",
        "Q: An author of a book called, \u201cOne by One by One.\u201d",
        "A: Right. Who happened to be in Germany covering the Nuremberg trials, or\nsomething. And she showed up the next day, came up to me, and said, can you tell\nme who Nancy Kamp(ph) is, my cousin is, and I said yes, she\u2019s over there. So\nJudith Miller talked to Nancy. Really liked Steven because he was young, and not\nan old refugee, and cottoned onto him. I think he \u2014 he \u2014 you were at Harvard at the\ntime, right?\nA2: Yeah.",
        "A: So \u2014 you know, so she held onto me, and to Steven.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they started the speeches. So Steven is saying, what are they saying, and\nJudith is saying, what are they saying. My German came back. And suddenly \u2014 I\ncouldn\u2019t read it in the paper the next day, but I was able to translate.",
        "Q: And you hadn\u2019t spoken it?April 27, 2017",
        "A: And I hadn\u2019t spoken it.",
        "Q: Since UK?",
        "A: Right.",

        "A: Exactly. And it just \u2014 it came back.",
        "Q: So when you were now living \u2014",
        "A: Do you remember that?\nA2: Very, very well.",
        "A: So I was able to translate, but I hadn\u2019t talked \u2014 I hadn\u2019t talked it. And when I\nwent to \u2014 the paper was full of it, I mean, we had reams this thick. I couldn\u2019t read\nthe German, but I definitely was able to translate.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting too, that when you went to live with your relatives once you\narrived in Brooklyn, that that means you didn\u2019t speak German with each other at\nhome. You must have spoken English.",
        "A: We did.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s a switch, because you had spoken German with each other when you\nlived in Germany.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay. But it didn\u2019t feel \u2014\nApril 27, 2017",
        "A: And to this day, I hate speaking it, but I can tell you I was able \u2014 I was able to\ntranslate pretty well, wasn\u2019t I?\nA2: I\u2014I was shocked, because I\u2019d never heard you speak German.",
        "A: I know, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\nA2: You didn\u2019t just translate, you spoke it, too.",
        "A: I just couldn\u2019t believe it.",
        "Q: Okay.\nA2: So that was 1987.",
        "Q: It was \u2014 yeah.\nA2: You left in 1939, so \u201949, \u201959, \u201969, \u00b079.",
        "Q: Forty \u2014 almost 50 years.\nA2: Almost \u2014 right? Cause it was 1987, you left in 39. So let\u2019s do this.",
        "Q: Almost 50 years.\nA2: Almost 50 years, and suddenly.",
        "Q: It comes back to you.\nA2: You were speaking perfectly \u2014",
        "A: That was astounding.",
        "Q: And so then, did you commu \u2014 with the locals \u2014",
        "A: No, then I gave it up.April 27, 2017",
        "Q: Okay, okay. But you were there in Fulda, and what other parts were meaningful\nfor you?",

        "Q: What about connections or contact with the local Germans? Did anything like\nthat happen?",
        "A: It \u2014 there was a lot of \u2014 more people that were my aunt\u2019s vintage.",

        "A: Cause you know, I was really \u2014",
        "Q: A child.",
        "A: \u2014 much younger. But the whole experience was very positive. I mean, the\nGermans did a great job arranging for these groups. Oh, then the other thing thatApril 27, 2017\nwas very meaningful was, we went \u2014 again, the members of my family, including \u2014\nwe went to my grandparents\u2019 house.",

        "Q: Okay. And you were with your mom and your aunts, and the large family, when\nthey went back for the first time, to Germany in 1987.\nA2: Yes.",
        "Q: And your mom wanted also to have you share what your experiences were at\nthat point, and particularly in the home that used to belong to the Lump family,\nbecause that was your grandmother\u2019s maiden name. Okay, so take it from there.\nA2: Okay, great. [break]",
        "Q: Okay Steve, so tell us. What do you remember from that?\nA2: Oh, so this was 1987, so how long ago was that?",
        "Q: Thirty years.\nA2: Thirty years ago. I remember \u2014 I remember it pretty vividly. There was a large\ngroup, and the town, and the press really beyond the town, in Germany, | guess this\nwas a time when there was a lot of interest in Germany about Jews coming back to\nvisit. And I remember getting off the plane when we first arrived in Germany, and\nApril 27, 2017\ndeparting off the plane with my mother and the whole group. And there were news\ncameras recording us getting off the plane, and it was a little jarring, and \u2014",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t expect that.\nA2: Not at all. And then \u2014 and then the next day we looked, and you know, the \u2014 the\nlocal TV station, and I think even beyond the local TV station had, you know, news\nreports about the Jews of Fulda coming back. And I must say, it was quite\narresting, because I-I have never really f-felt so much like, you know, the Jews\ncoming back, it was just weird to be \u2014",
        "Q: In a group like that?\nA2:\u20141in a group like that, and I guess the \u2014 Fulda had had a large Jewish\npopulation before and during the war, that there were \u2014",
        "A: Very Orthodox.\nA2: I think when we came back, there were 60,000 people in the town of Fulda,\nand maybe 30 Jews.",
        "Q: Who st \u2014 who were local there, and lived there.\nA2: Yes, in other words, the population had gone from 1200 to 30.",
        "Q: Twelve hundred in 19 \u2014\nA2: Probably 1200 to zero, and then some came back, but \u2014April 27, 2017",
        "Q: All right. So 1200 pre-war, and to the \u2014 okay. Did you meet any of the local\nJews who \u2014 who stayed and lived in Fulda?",
        "A: No.\nA2: I don\u2019t remember doing that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think there were any.\nA2: Yeah, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think there were \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. Any of the 12, for example.\nA2: I\u2014I-\u2014 my belief is that there were no Jews that survived in Fulda, that some\nhad come back \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.\nA2: \u2014 between the end of the war and 1987. But 30, that\u2019s not a huge number.",
        "Q: No, 30 is not a lot.\nA2: And the town made a big effort, and the mayor of the town, who I think later\nhad a more prominent political, you know, career in ger \u2014 in modern Germany, had\n\u2014 one of his initiatives was to try and rebuild a temple in Fulda, as a way of\nemphasizing, you know, a new \u2014 a new post-Nazi view, and \u2014 and I think he was\nthe one behind organizing \u2014",
        "A: Right.April 27, 2017\nA2: \u2014 the Jews in Fulda to return. But it \u2014 it was \u2014 it was very intensely personal for\nmy mother and her family and our family, but you couldn\u2019t miss the fact that it had\nthis political significance. The way it was covered by the press. Frankly, the\nsecurity. It was a little eerie, because everywhere we went, it was fairly subtle, but\nthere was \u2014",
        "Q: Coverage.\nA2: Well, there was coverage, but we had armed military, not just local police, but",
        "Q: To protect you?\nA2: T \u2014 yes. Because there was the belief \u2014 I think Germany felt that there was all\n\u2014 you know, in 1987, there were a variety of \u2014",
        "A: Anti-Semitism left, do you think?\nA2: I think there was that, I think there was just terrorism.",
        "Q: Yeah, it could have very well been, yeah.\nA2: There was a lot of \u2014",
        "Q: There was the Israeli \u2014 I don\u2019t know what year that \u2014 that massacre happened in\nmu \u2014 in Munich, but it might have been in the 80s, during, I think the Olympics?\nA2: Well, that happened previously \u2014",
        "Q: Previously.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 27, 2017\nA2: \u2014 but there were \u2014 there was \u2014 it wasn\u2019t necessarily German anti-Semitism, I\nthink there was a fear that \u2014",
        "A: A lot of unrest, I guess.\nA2: Well, in midde \u2014 there \u2014 you know \u2014",
        "Q: Mideast terrorism.\nA2: Exactly. So, and I think Germany felt, and the mayor felt that, to invite the\nJews back to Fulda, make a big statement about reconciliation, and have a terrorist\nincident, would not be a good thing. But the \u2014 but the level of security, maybe it\nwasn\u2019t necessary, and \u2014 but it was \u2014 it added a level of \u2014",
        "A: Drama, I think.\nA2: \u2014 drama, to something that was already pretty dramatic. But, for example, when\nwe went to the \u2014",
        "A: Castle?\nA2: Well, not the ca \u2014 when we went to the ceremony, to dedicate the reopening of\nthe synagogue in Fulda \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you remember that, there was \u2014 it was \u2014\nthere was an open street, and they \u2014 they had \u2014 they had a \u2014 you know, si \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow if it was buses, or cement trucks, but they had \u2014 they had obstacles closing off\nthe street, to make sure that \u2014 th \u2014 you know, if you looked \u2014 it was subtle, but if\nyou looked carefully, the level of security was \u2014April 27, 2017",
        "Q: It was there.\nA2: I-It wasn\u2019t just local police, it was way beyond that.",
        "Q: Okay.\nA2: And, you know, it was \u2014 it was \u2014 you know, it wa \u2014 it wa \u2014 it was a f \u2014 it was\njust int \u2014 it was just a little unnerving, really. So I remember that. I remember being\nshocked, because I thought I knew my mother. How old was I? I was probably in\nlaw school at the time, so in my mid-20s. I had never really heard my mother speak\nGerman. I didn\u2019t think she spoke German. And the second \u2014",
        "Q: And then all of a sudden \u2014\nA2: All of a sudden, as she said, I \u2014",
        "A: As Judith saying was \u2014 what\u2019s he saying, and Steven, what\u2019s he saying?\nA2: And then my mother started translating. And then people \u2014 we would be going\nsomewhere, and we would try and be lost, and my mother would stop and ask\nsomeone in German what the directions were, and seemed to converse \u2014",
        "Q: Wow.\nA2:\u2014 completely in German.",
        "A: You know, that was really a shock to me.\nA2: Yeah. It was kind of amazing. So I remember that. I think \u2014 you know, it was a\nlittle \u2014 I-I-I think for a lot of the people in the family, 1-1-it\u2019s almost as if they \u2014\nApril 27, 2017\nthere was this mind shift, where suddenly, you know, you felt what it must have\nbeen like to be there Juden, you know, and like different in this place. And you\nknow, it was touching, but it was just \u2014 it \u2014 it was just \u2014 I think it affected everyone\nvery deeply. The way you suddenly started speaking German, you know, everyone\nreacted differently. Batta(ph), who my mother was talking about.",
        "Q: Aunt Bertha(ph).\nA2: Aunt Bertha(ph).",
        "A: She was interviewed in the radio.\nA2: Yeah.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 covered her.",
        "Q: But she was the one who was so set against going.",
        "A: Yes, totally.",
        "Q: And when she actually did go, and was interviewed, what was it that she said?\nWhat was it that she \u2014 did that change, I mean, clearly?\nApril 27, 2017\nA2: I think the local radio station wa \u2014 you know, she was one of the people they\ninterviewed about coming back. You know, Bertha(ph) was very \u2014 is \u2014 was \u2014 as\nmy mother said, very slight.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nA2: Very magnetic, big personality. And \u2014 and she wasn\u2019t trying to be a big\npersonality, she was \u2014 she just \u2014",
        "Q: She was being herself.\nA2: She was being herself, and it wa \u2014 it was, you know, magnetic. She wasn\u2019t\nbitter, but she was very straightforward about things, and she didn\u2019t sugarcoat it. I\ndon\u2019t remember the interview, cause it was in German, and I didn\u2019t understand that.\nBut I \u2014 I remember very well that we were in a coffee shop.",
        "A: Listening to her.\nA2: We were sitting around a table with her, and it was just a small group, and she\nwas describing a \u2014 a very bad incident, in which \u2014",
        "A: Her sister was \u2014 not raped, but \u2014 by a German. Is \u2014 isn\u2019t \u2014 isn\u2019t that what it was?\nA2: The one I remember is where just the Jews in \u2014 in Fulda were being rounded\nup, and that the local people, they had had good friends, but their \u2014 the local \u2014 there\nwas a mob that was sort of \u2014",
        "A: Not \u2014 not sympathetic.\nApril 27, 2017\nA2: Just sort of cheering on the Nazis, you know.",
        "Q: As they\u2019re rounding the people up, mm-hm.\nA2: Yes. And Bertha(ph) was speaking about it, you know, very directly, pretty\nyou know, angrily, but just matter of fact. And I remember it was just jarring,\nbecause he we are sitting, listening to her, and there was like a table adjacent to it,\nwith like a \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that.\nA2: \u2014a\u2014a German woman, who was of sort of a similar age. And she just had this\nlike stricken look on her face. You know, just sort of horribly upset to be hearing\nthis, and it was just interesting. Bat \u2014 Bertha(ph) was not aware of this other person\nwho was like overhearing and listening. But it just struck me that Bertha(ph) was\ntelling her story, and this woman was \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t read her mind, but it\nseemed like some combination of just being horribly upset \u2014 but not necessarily\nsympathetic, just upset that someone was stirring up the pot, you know. D-Do you\nunderstand?",
        "Q: [indecipherable] talking about that, yeah.\nA2: So I remember that.",
        "Q: Okay.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 27, 2017\nA2: And then the one other memory \u2014 many, but one memory I have is that my\nmother had spoken so much about visiting her grandmother, and in the bed, in that\nhouse. And \u2014 so I remember at some point \u2014",

So I remember we were like looking, and peering around, and I\nremember someone went to the back and said, oh look, the barn\u2019s still there, or\nsomething like that. And then the shutters open a little bit, and someone looks out\nfrom the second floor, and then the shutters close again. And then that happened\nlike two or three times. And I think we rang on the doorbell. No one answered. And\nthen we rang the doorbell a-again, and a woman opened the door, and she was \u2014 it \u2014\nthe whole dynamic really suggested that the person there just really didn\u2019t want\nthese visitors and would \u2014 would like them to go away, and \u2014",

        "A: She was very reluctant.\nA2: She didn\u2019t like that idea at all, and she finally allowed, I think, a \u2014 a f\u2014 the\ngroup to come in, in like stages. And I\u2014 I remember going in with you, and first of\nall, to me \u2014 well, I didn\u2019t really remember the details of the house. I remember theApril 27, 2017\ndetails of the reaction this woman had, because you \u2014 you couldn\u2019t fail, just based\non her age and her reactions, to think that thi \u2014 that this was the person who \u2014",
        "A: Who took over.\nA2:\u2014 who owned the house after \u2014",
        "Q: After you all either were thrown out or left, or whatever, however.\nA2: When it was taken.",

        "A: Everybody would \u2014 everyone had gone my \u2014 to the contra \u2014 concentration camp.\nA2: And I think that the local Gestapo, or local party, you know, would \u2014 you\nknow, designate who could take over, so it was often people who were, you know \u2014",
        "A: Connected.\nA2: \u2014 friends of the Nazi party.",
        "Q: These are suppositions, but this is what comes through your mind as you\u2019re \u2014\nA2: No, I remember someone telling me at the \u2014 cause I remember after it, thinking\nlike \u2014 asking like, how is it \u2014 how di\u2014 when a house got vacated, who determined\nwho got it.",
        "Q: Got it, okay.\nA2: And so someone se \u2014 told me, well, this is how it usually worked.",
        "Q: Okay.\n107\nApril 27, 2017\nA2: That it \u2014 that it was \u2014 the party would allocate who got it, or 1t was put up for\nauction, but the auction was rigged, you know.",
        "Q: So how did this lady react?\nA2: So, this is the part I remember. And then, if it\u2019s all right, because this was a\nwhile ago, this reporter my mother mentioned, did write a book about it. We found\nthe passage. So [Il tell you what I remember, and then III \u2014 I'll read you what \u2014",
        "Q: The passage was.\nA2: Yeah.",
        "Q: Sure.\nA2: Which hopefully \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.\nA2: \u2014 matches up a little bit.",
        "Q: Okay.\nA2: I remember going to the room that my mother had described \u2014 cause I would\nask her, well what \u2014 what\u2019s your memory of your grandmother. And this was \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. The one she thought was so \u2014 she felt so warm to, who was so sickly.\nA2: Right.",
        "Q: And a wise lady \u2014\nA2: In her bed.April 27, 2017",

        "Q: Thank you.\nA2: So [remember going to that room, that living room. And I remember you kind\nof reacting very greatly to like, this 1s exact \u2014 it doesn\u2019t look anything like \u2014 all the\nfurniture is different, it doesn\u2019t look anything, but this exactly \u2014",
        "Q: The room.\nA2: \u2014 the room. This is the room where I would say \u2014",
        "A: And this big cross.\nA2: Yes. And you told me, the one thing that\u2019s different is, there 1s \u2014 there was this\nhuge cross that would have been like, over the bed \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right.\nA2: \u2014 you know. So I remember that, but the thing that I remember the most is that\nyou know, every \u2014 the group \u2014 everyone was aware that this woman didn\u2019t have to\nlet us in, you know, we had asked if we could see it, and everyone was trying to\nApril 27, 2017\nkind of \u2014 and it was clear that sh \u2014 who \u2014 di\u2014 who \u2014 everyone sensed that she had\nthis feeling like oh, they\u2019re going to take it away, they\u2019re going to take the house\naway from me, or something. So we were trying very hard to be like reassuring, and\nyou know, kind of very appreciative that she was letting us see the house. And the\nrest of my mother and the relatives were sort of going back, looking through the\nhouse, and she kind of turned to me, and I was kind of more wa \u2014 I was kind of\nrunning interference. I was like talking to her, and letting everyone else see the\nhouse. And there wa \u2014 and I said, thank you for letting us see the house, it really\nmeans a lot, you know. And she said, it\u2019s okay. And then there was a silence. And\nthen she looked at me, and she looked down, and she said, you know, these shoes\nare terrible. These shoes hurt so much. I cannot get a pair of shoes that fit me, and I\nhave a ki\u2014 you know, my feet really ache, it\u2019s very hard to walk. I\u2019m so\nuncomfortable, my \u2014 it\u2019s very uncomfortable my f\u2014 terrible, my shoes really hurt.",

        "Q: Well, there\u2019s a significant moment. She realizes who the people are who have\ncome back, and instead of somehow or other acknowledging this significant\n110\nApril 27, 2017\nmoment, this is what she 1s \u2014 this is what \u2014 how she is able to handle it, in other\nwords. Or not handle it.\nA2: I\u2014 look, I\u2014 we couldn\u2019t read her mind.",
        "Q: Of course not.\nA2: But, I-I believe that she was \u2014",
        "A: She was asking you to give some money for shoes?\nA2: No, no, no, I don\u2019t think that at all.",
        "Q: I mean, that thought crossed my mind, too, maybe.\nA2: No, I\u2014 she \u2014 I didn\u2019t think she was asking, I think she was feeling extremely\nuncomfortable. I th \u2014 I took it that she felt \u2014 well, let me go on, and then I'll tell you\nwhat \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.\nA2: \u2014 how I \u2014 how \u2014 [Il \u2014 I'll just tell you the facts.",
        "Q: How you \u2014 how you took it, yeah.\nA2: And then III tell you how I took it.",
        "Q: Right.\nA2: It was very odd for us to be there, and for her to be \u2014 she wasn\u2019t saying, give\nme money for a new pair of shoes. She was saying, it\u2019s terrible, these shoes, they \u2014",

And I was sort of ext \u2014 I was\nkind of nodding and, you know, kind of saying that, gee, that\u2019s a shame. And I was\nthinking to myself, you know, you\u2019re \u2014 you seem \u2014 oh, I remember, there was one\nother thing. I said like, oh, you know, how long have you lived here?

        "Q: Yeah.\nA2: And I think she was feeling \u2014 and I think that she realized no one was going to\nbe making a claim against her. This was simply us remembering the \u2014 the place\nwhere we had been harmed, and exiled, or my family had been. And I don\u2019t think\nshe could handle it.

        "Q: Okay.\nA2: So it says: \u201cBut with the surfacing of good memories, came the bad and the\nambivalent. One day, for example, some of the Lumps mustered the courage to\nvisit their former home. It had been occupied for years by a woman, now very old,\nwhose husband had probably bought it at auction from the Nazis.\u201d Presumably, the\nauthor of this book researched it, and got her own information. \u201cShe let us enter in\nstages, said Doris Fingerhood, Rosie\u2019s daughter, who had left Germany for\nEngland when she was 11 years old. The house looked physically much as I\nremembered it, only much smaller. I kept thinking, where did my parents put 11\nchildren? But I had remembered the house as full of character, now it was\npeculiarly devoid of any. The woman who owned it,\u201d \u2014 this is my mother speaking\n\u2014 \u201cthe woman who owned it was 80. She kept saying that she had lived there for 20\nyears, but knew nothing about how her husband, who was dead, had acquired it. She\nwas crusty, and very formal, typically German. I didn\u2019t know what to believe, and\nthat made me uncomfortable. She comp \u2014 she complained about her health, about\nthe cost of keeping up the house. It was so expensive to maintain that she couldn\u2019t\ntravel, Doris said. Finally, she looked at Steven and me, at our blondish hair and\nApril 27, 2017\nblue eyes, and said, you don\u2019t look like the Lumps. There was a final shock\nawaiting them. Regina\u2019s bedroom was virtually unchanged from the day she had\ndied there, with one exception. Over what had been the Lump family\u2019s old double\nbed hung a large wooden cross. I\u2019m glad my mother could not see it, Doris said\nsoftly.\u201d And then it goes on to talk about other things.",

And\nPll preface that also with a thought. I usually try not to be leading, but I get the\nimpression, after talking to so many people, that one of the most difficult aspects in\nthis story is \u2014 the large story, is the loss of trust, and can trust ever be regained? And\nI wonder if that plays a role here. So there\u2019s really two questions.\n118\nApril 27, 2017",

        "A: \u2014 older \u2014 or soccer, or whatever he did. But they met Germans whom they knew,\nand they made it possible \u2014 they had teas, or coffee, or you know, they had \u2014 they\nmet that older group, with other older groups, and they actually interact \u2014 acted.\nNow, I wasn\u2019t part of that, but they had the opportunity to meet people that they\nknew when they were younger, and growing up.",
        "Q: During this trip to ful \u2014",
        "A: During this trip to Fulda. Th-There were definite meetings, when the Germans\ncould meet the people like my relatives who had lived in Fulda. How it went, I\ncan\u2019t really tell you.\nA2: You don\u2019t remember any comment?",

        "A: I was just glad I wasn\u2019t there any more. I mean, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t like Germany, I\ndidn\u2019t like the atmosphere.",
        "Q: Even then, in 1987, in Fulda.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I was glad I was there, that I could absorb. Like we went to my\ngrandmother\u2019s grave, and that was very important to me. I was glad to have the\nconnection more personally, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be there.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: What about you?\nA2: Well, I kind of had to somewhat \u2014",
        "Q: And I\u2019m not just talking about the Fulda trip, but if that 1s the catalyst, if that\u2019s\nthe only time you were there \u2014\nA2: No, I\u2019ve been there s-since.",
        "A: But not in that context.\nApril 27, 2017\nA2: No, not in that context. You know, I think that \u2014 I think that it\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I-I\nthink two things. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nearly as simple as, the\nGermans did something bad to the Jews. That\u2019s certainly true, but it\u2019s also true \u2014\nalthough it\u2019s horrific to say \u2014 that there were Gentile friends of Rose and Leo who\nrisked their lives to save \u2014 to hide them, until 1944.

So I\u2019m \u2014 but, you know, I don\u2019t think \u2014 it\u2019s one thing to read about\nhorrible things in the paper, or in history books, but when you see it through your\nown family, or your mother or grandparents, it\u2019s very dark.

        "A: Hard to believe.\nA2: \u20141s nonsense. And \u2014 and it \u2014 to me, it was the little things, like the reaction of\nthis woman, that just betrayed the fact that \u2014 you know, there was lots of complicity\nin \u2014 in bad acts. And so, I don\u2019t feel like, oh I can\u2019t trust Germans. And I\u2019ve been to\nGermany a lot, and \u2014",
        "Q: Since then?\nApril 27, 2017\nA2: Yes. And you know, in the modern wor \u2014 I mean, the interesting thing, by the\nway, is that one big contingent of visitors on this trip to Fulda were Germans who\nhad emigrated to Israel. And they \u2014 and you know, Israel and Germany have a\nvery functional relationship right now. And Germany is important to Israel\u2019s\neconomy. And what I found interesting was that the Israelis had \u2014 had gotten over\nthis a long time ago. Israelis did not exhibit a lot of ambivalence, or \u2014",
        "A: Interesting.\nA2: \u2014 you know, emotional complication. American Jews did. Israeli Jews had\nother problems.",

I found the\nexperience scarring, you know, just kind of feeling like I was reliving through my\nmother, you know, or her relatives, like what had happened. I think it was a hugely\ntraumatic thing. And I think everyone has, you know, lived remarkably good lives,\ngiven such a rip in the entire family support system, fabric. And look, that happened\nto a lot of people in that time, but this was really acute.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n122April 27, 2017",
        "Q: One reason that I ask that, is that willy or nilly, we are having this conversation\nseveral generations after the events.

How you speak\nof something \u2014 you don\u2019t have different facts, but how you speak of the facts 10\nyears afterwards, two years afterwards, and 50 years afterwards, changes somewhat,\nis influenced by things.

And part of why I\u2019m\nasking these questions is to provide a window to what makes \u2014 if that is the case, or\nnot, you know? Does that \u2014\nA2: Let me take that point and narrow it into like a very specific mini-example,\ncause I understand that feeling. So when we were on this trip, my mother said, this\nat the beginning, Lufthansa provided transportation, or was part of it, and there was\na sizable contingent of people who were kosher, who were Orthodox and kosher.\nAnd the \u2014 some of the events that someone in Germany catered was, they had toApril 27, 2017\nprovide kosher food. Well, there are, you know 30 Jews in \u2014 in \u2014 in Fulda at the\ntime, and it was a \u2014 it was a production. And I don\u2019t really know how they did it,\ncause we don\u2019t keep kosher, but I think it involved getting food from, you know,\nfurther away places. And I remember at one of these events, speaking not to a\ndignitary or anything like that, just to some \u2014 some kind of a guy who was working\n\u2014 I forget if he was part of the catering, or part of Lufthansa, but he was one of the\npeople that arranged for this food to be provided to the kosher people. And I was\nmaking \u2014 you know, I was sort of just having casual conversation with him, sort of,\nbecause it was \u2014 I w \u2014 it was just interesting to me that thi-this was like a very \u2014 I\nwas part of this visible, the Jews of Fulda back there. And I said something like\nwow, quite an event, and I think he spoke reasonable enough English. And he said\nyes. And he said, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 he basically said it\u2019s really very expensive, and\nvery difficult to have to get this kosher food. And it\u2019s really a big production, and\nwe \u2014 he \u2014I don\u2019t think he \u2014 he basically said, we have better things to do.",
        "Q: Ah, so it was with this kind of attitude.\nA2: It was like \u2014 and \u2014 and I don\u2019t think he was being angry, but it was very\ninteresting, because his perception was exactly what you were saying about like\nwhy \u2014 I\u2019m not res \u2014 his whole perception was, look, I-I\u2019m a young person, I\u2019m not\nresponsible for whatever happened in the past. Somehow or another, we have to run\n124\nApril 27, 2017\nall over the place to get this kosher food, for this group of people that are visiting.\nWhy do we have to do this, you know?

It was\nmore like, why the hell am I doing this? And I thought to myself, well, you know, if\n\u2014if this group hadn\u2019t killed, or exiled these people, they would have their own\nthriving community, they could get their own kosher foods, so it\u2019s really the least\nyou can do, to be inconvenienced.",

Before the break, we were talking about your \u2014\nyour journey from Berlin to England, and your first impressions there.

        "Q: And your mom wanted also to have you share what your experiences were at\nthat point, and particularly in the home that used to belong to the Lump family,\nbecause that was your grandmother\u2019s maiden name. Okay, so take it from there.\nA2: Okay, great. [break]",
        "Q: Okay Steve, so tell us. What do you remember from that?\nA2: Oh, so this was 1987, so how long ago was that?",
        "Q: Thirty years.\nA2: Thirty years ago. I remember \u2014 I remember it pretty vividly. There was a large\ngroup, and the town, and the press really beyond the town, in Germany, | guess this\nwas a time when there was a lot of interest in Germany about Jews coming back to\nvisit. And I remember getting off the plane when we first arrived in Germany, and",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t expect that.\nA2: Not at all. And then \u2014 and then the next day we looked, and you know, the \u2014 the\nlocal TV station, and I think even beyond the local TV station had, you know, news\nreports about the Jews of Fulda coming back. And I must say, it was quite\narresting, because I-I have never really f-felt so much like, you know, the Jews\ncoming back, it was just weird to be \u2014",
        "Q: In a group like that?\nA2:\u20141in a group like that, and I guess the \u2014 Fulda had had a large Jewish\npopulation before and during the war, that there were \u2014",
        "Q: Who st \u2014 who were local there, and lived there.\nA2: Yes, in other words, the population had gone from 1200 to 30.",
        "Q: Twelve hundred in 19 \u2014\nA2: Probably 1200 to zero, and then some came back, but \u2014April 27, 2017",
        "Q: All right. So 1200 pre-war, and to the \u2014 okay. Did you meet any of the local\nJews who \u2014 who stayed and lived in Fulda?",
        "Q: Okay. Any of the 12, for example.\nA2: I\u2014I-\u2014 my belief is that there were no Jews that survived in Fulda, that some\nhad come back \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.\nA2: \u2014 between the end of the war and 1987. But 30, that\u2019s not a huge number.",
        "Q: No, 30 is not a lot.\nA2: And the town made a big effort, and the mayor of the town, who I think later\nhad a more prominent political, you know, career in ger \u2014 in modern Germany, had\n\u2014 one of his initiatives was to try and rebuild a temple in Fulda, as a way of\nemphasizing, you know, a new \u2014 a new post-Nazi view, and \u2014 and I think he was\nthe one behind organizing \u2014",
        "Q: Coverage.\nA2: Well, there was coverage, but we had armed military, not just local police, but",
        "Q: To protect you?\nA2: T \u2014 yes. Because there was the belief \u2014 I think Germany felt that there was all\n\u2014 you know, in 1987, there were a variety of \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, it could have very well been, yeah.\nA2: There was a lot of \u2014",
        "Q: There was the Israeli \u2014 I don\u2019t know what year that \u2014 that massacre happened in\nmu \u2014 in Munich, but it might have been in the 80s, during, I think the Olympics?\nA2: Well, that happened previously \u2014",
        "Q: Previously.",
        "Q: Mideast terrorism.\nA2: Exactly. So, and I think Germany felt, and the mayor felt that, to invite the\nJews back to Fulda, make a big statement about reconciliation, and have a terrorist\nincident, would not be a good thing. But the \u2014 but the level of security, maybe it\nwasn\u2019t necessary, and \u2014 but it was \u2014 it added a level of \u2014",
        "Q: It was there.\nA2: I-It wasn\u2019t just local police, it was way beyond that.",
        "Q: Okay.\nA2: And, you know, it was \u2014 it was \u2014 you know, it wa \u2014 it wa \u2014 it was a f \u2014 it was\njust int \u2014 it was just a little unnerving, really. So I remember that. I remember being\nshocked, because I thought I knew my mother. How old was I? I was probably in\nlaw school at the time, so in my mid-20s. I had never really heard my mother speak\nGerman. I didn\u2019t think she spoke German. And the second \u2014",
        "Q: And then all of a sudden \u2014\nA2: All of a sudden, as she said, I \u2014",
        "Q: Wow.\nA2:\u2014 completely in German.",
        "Q: Aunt Bertha(ph).\nA2: Aunt Bertha(ph).",
        "Q: Oh, was she?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: But she was the one who was so set against going.",
        "Q: And when she actually did go, and was interviewed, what was it that she said?\nWhat was it that she \u2014 did that change, I mean, clearly?",
        "Q: Yeah.\nA2: Very magnetic, big personality. And \u2014 and she wasn\u2019t trying to be a big\npersonality, she was \u2014 she just \u2014",
        "Q: She was being herself.\nA2: She was being herself, and it wa \u2014 it was, you know, magnetic. She wasn\u2019t\nbitter, but she was very straightforward about things, and she didn\u2019t sugarcoat it. I\ndon\u2019t remember the interview, cause it was in German, and I didn\u2019t understand that.\nBut I \u2014 I remember very well that we were in a coffee shop.",
        "Q: As they\u2019re rounding the people up, mm-hm.\nA2: Yes. And Bertha(ph) was speaking about it, you know, very directly, pretty\nyou know, angrily, but just matter of fact. And I remember it was just jarring,\nbecause he we are sitting, listening to her, and there was like a table adjacent to it,\nwith like a \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable] talking about that, yeah.\nA2: So I remember that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see the old house, yeah.\nA2: Is it still there? And s \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember the street 1t was on? What the name of the street it was on?\nA2: You know, it was chronicled in this book, so I\u2019m gonna \u2014 I don\u2019t know if they\nhave the address, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Okay. They may not.\nA2: So we went there, I think we took a cab there, maybe \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, so it would have been in the news.\nA2: Yes, absolutely, TV, news \u2014",
        "Q: And what did the house look like?\nA2: It was a nice enough house, it was big.",
        "Q: Stucco?\nA2: I think it was stucco, but I don\u2019t remember it very well. What I remember is,\nthere were shutters.",
        "Q: Single family?\nA2: Yes.",
        "Q: Garden around?",
        "Q: No.\nA2: No.",
        "Q: Okay, so this is not the center of Fulda.",

        "Q: Single family, two-story type of house.\nA2: Does that sound right?",
        "Q: Yeah.\nA2: It definite \u2014 1t \u2014 it \u2014 I think it was two-story.",
        "Q: Okay.\nA2: Single family. So I remember we were like looking, and peering around, and I\nremember someone went to the back and said, oh look, the barn\u2019s still there, or\nsomething like that. And then the shutters open a little bit, and someone looks out\nfrom the second floor, and then the shutters close again. And then that happened\nlike two or three times. And I think we rang on the doorbell. No one answered. And\nthen we rang the doorbell a-again, and a woman opened the door, and she was \u2014 it \u2014\nthe whole dynamic really suggested that the person there just really didn\u2019t want\nthese visitors and would \u2014 would like them to go away, and \u2014",
        "Q: After you all either were thrown out or left, or whatever, however.\nA2: When it was taken.",
        "Q: \u2014 was taken \u2014",
        "Q: These are suppositions, but this is what comes through your mind as you\u2019re \u2014\nA2: No, I remember someone telling me at the \u2014 cause I remember after it, thinking\nlike \u2014 asking like, how is it \u2014 how di\u2014 when a house got vacated, who determined\nwho got it.",
        "Q: Got it, okay.\nA2: And so someone se \u2014 told me, well, this is how it usually worked.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So how did this lady react?\nA2: So, this is the part I remember. And then, if it\u2019s all right, because this was a\nwhile ago, this reporter my mother mentioned, did write a book about it. We found\nthe passage. So [Il tell you what I remember, and then III \u2014 I'll read you what \u2014",
        "Q: The passage was.\nA2: Yeah.",
        "Q: Sure.\nA2: Which hopefully \u2014",

And I was sort of ext \u2014 I was\nkind of nodding and, you know, kind of saying that, gee, that\u2019s a shame. And I was\nthinking to myself, you know, you\u2019re \u2014 you seem \u2014 oh, I remember, there was one\nother thing. I said like, oh, you know, how long have you lived here? And she said,\noh, you know, a very long time. And I said oh, like when \u2014 like, since when? And\nshe said oh \u2014 she didn\u2019t \u2014 she said a lon \u2014 you know, had it for a long time.

This was simply us remembering the \u2014 the place\nwhere we had been harmed, and exiled, or my family had been. And I don\u2019t think\nshe could handle it.

One day, for example, some of the Lumps mustered the courage to\nvisit their former home. It had been occupied for years by a woman, now very old,\nwhose husband had probably bought it at auction from the Nazis.\u201d Presumably, the\nauthor of this book researched it, and got her own information. \u201cShe let us enter in\nstages, said Doris Fingerhood, Rosie\u2019s daughter, who had left Germany for\nEngland when she was 11 years old. The house looked physically much as I\nremembered it, only much smaller. I kept thinking, where did my parents put 11\nchildren?

I didn\u2019t know what to believe, and\nthat made me uncomfortable. She comp \u2014 she complained about her health, about\nthe cost of keeping up the house. It was so expensive to maintain that she couldn\u2019t\ntravel, Doris said. Finally, she looked at Steven and me, at our blondish hair and",

And\nPll preface that also with a thought. I usually try not to be leading, but I get the\nimpression, after talking to so many people, that one of the most difficult aspects in\nthis story is \u2014 the large story, is the loss of trust, and can trust ever be regained? And\nI wonder if that plays a role here. So there\u2019s really two questions.",

        "Q: Since then?",
        "Q: So, that\u2019s also interesting.\nA2: So I-I guess \u2014 first of all, [indecipherable] fascinated \u2014",
        "Q: One reason that I ask that, is that willy or nilly, we are having this conversation\nseveral generations after the events. And the fact that we have it so many years,\ndecades after the events, when there are several \u2014 that influences us. How you speak\nof something \u2014 you don\u2019t have different facts, but how you speak of the facts 10\nyears afterwards, two years afterwards, and 50 years afterwards, changes somewhat,\nis influenced by things. And today, there are young Germans who, I\u2019ve heard often\nsay \u2014 and it\u2019s not the only voice. It\u2019s not the only voice, but they say, this happened\nsuch a long time ago. This has nothing to do with me. Why can\u2019t I be taken by who\nIam \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 rather than by all this? Why do I have to apologize for something that even not\nmy parents did, but maybe even my grandparents didn\u2019t? And part of why I\u2019m\nasking these questions is to provide a window to what makes \u2014 if that is the case, or\nnot, you know? Does that \u2014\nA2: Let me take that point and narrow it into like a very specific mini-example,\ncause I understand that feeling. So when we were on this trip, my mother said, this\nat the beginning, Lufthansa provided transportation, or was part of it, and there was\na sizable contingent of people who were kosher, who were Orthodox and kosher.\nAnd the \u2014 some of the events that someone in Germany catered was, they had toApril 27, 2017\nprovide kosher food. Well, there are, you know 30 Jews in \u2014 in \u2014 in Fulda at the\ntime, and it was a \u2014 it was a production. And I don\u2019t really know how they did it,\ncause we don\u2019t keep kosher, but I think it involved getting food from, you know,\nfurther away places. And I remember at one of these events, speaking not to a\ndignitary or anything like that, just to some \u2014 some kind of a guy who was working\n\u2014 I forget if he was part of the catering, or part of Lufthansa, but he was one of the\npeople that arranged for this food to be provided to the kosher people. And I was\nmaking \u2014 you know, I was sort of just having casual conversation with him, sort of,\nbecause it was \u2014 I w \u2014 it was just interesting to me that thi-this was like a very \u2014 I\nwas part of this visible, the Jews of Fulda back there. And I said something like\nwow, quite an event, and I think he spoke reasonable enough English. And he said\nyes. And he said, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 he basically said it\u2019s really very expensive, and\nvery difficult to have to get this kosher food. And it\u2019s really a big production, and\nwe \u2014 he \u2014I don\u2019t think he \u2014 he basically said, we have better things to do.",
        "Q: Ah, so it was with this kind of attitude.\nA2: It was like \u2014 and \u2014 and I don\u2019t think he was being angry, but it was very\ninteresting, because his perception was exactly what you were saying about like\nwhy \u2014 I\u2019m not res \u2014 his whole perception was, look, I-I\u2019m a young person, I\u2019m not\nresponsible for whatever happened in the past. Somehow or another, we have to run",
        "Q: Pain.\nA2: \u2014 burden. It\u2019s a big pain. And I don\u2019t get it. And so he was not, at all, welcome\nback, you know, I know a bad thing happened, we\u2019re making a huge effort. It was\nmore like, why the hell am I doing this? And I thought to myself, well, you know, if\n\u2014if this group hadn\u2019t killed, or exiled these people, they would have their own\nthriving community, they could get their own kosher foods, so it\u2019s really the least\nyou can do, to be inconvenienced.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nA2: So \u2014 but there are both sides, you know. I don\u2019t know what to say.",
        "Q: So you could see \u2014 you could see his point of view.\nA2: I c\u2014I understand someone saying, we didn\u2019t do this. Hell, you Americans, I \u2014\nwhat are you doing for the native American Indians, or you know, or \u2014 that\u2019s your\npromise?

And it\u2019s not a finished story.",
        "Q: Sure.\nA2: \u2014 and I am s \u2014 rem \u2014 so removed from it, but my impression is that \u2014 you know,\nWeimar Germany, | guess, was really collapsing. People turned to a strong,\nauthoritarian dictator because they thought it was the only way to get things done.\nAnd I think once Hitler \u2014 I think Hitler very quickly, you know, empowered the\nworst, lowest, most brutal, most criminal elements. And I think once that happened,\nyou know, there were lots of decent people who were terrified. And so I\u2019m not too\n127\nApril 27, 2017\nsure \u2014 I\u2019m not excusing it, I\u2019m just explaining it, because I think people do bad\nthings when they feel \u2014",

Of her 10 brothers and sisters, Rosie was the only one who had\nnot been able to emigrate. Her husband Leo, a trained pharmacist, was now working\nin a chemical factory that was making war materials. I understand that, as such, he\nwould never get a permit to leave. He was now a member of the war essential work\nforce, assigned to work far beneath his qualifications, at wages set arbitrar \u2014\narbitrarily by the Nazis. Since the war had started in September 1939, Rosie had\nheard only sporadically about their two girls, Doris and Hannah(ph), since they\nhad left for England. Direct communication between England and Germany was\nno longer possible, and it will come directly through friends or relatives in neutral\nplaces, like America, or Shanghai, or some South American countries.

Other children from these 11\noffspring came. And \u2014 and it was very well organized. I mean, we met in the\nschloss, which wasn\u2019t hurt at all.

        "A: But I was glad I was there, that I could absorb. Like we went to my\ngrandmother\u2019s grave, and that was very important to me. I was glad to have the\nconnection more personally, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be there.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nearly as simple as, the\nGermans did something bad to the Jews. That\u2019s certainly true, but it\u2019s also true \u2014\nalthough it\u2019s horrific to say \u2014 that there were Gentile friends of Rose and Leo who\nrisked their lives to save \u2014 to hide them, until 1944.

So I\u2019m \u2014 but, you know, I don\u2019t think \u2014 it\u2019s one thing to read about\nhorrible things in the paper, or in history books, but when you see it through your\nown family, or your mother or grandparents, it\u2019s very dark.

And you know, in the modern wor \u2014 I mean, the interesting thing, by the\nway, is that one big contingent of visitors on this trip to Fulda were Germans who\nhad emigrated to Israel. And they \u2014 and you know, Israel and Germany have a\nvery functional relationship right now. And Germany is important to Israel\u2019s\neconomy.

I found the\nexperience scarring, you know, just kind of feeling like I was reliving through my\nmother, you know, or her relatives, like what had happened. I think it was a hugely\ntraumatic thing.
