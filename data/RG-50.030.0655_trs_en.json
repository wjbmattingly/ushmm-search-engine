This this week, it is it is Thursday, the other week it\nwas Friday, the other week it was Monday. You see? But the families that still hold the\nreligion, it was very, very hard. If somebody didn't come to do work, he was fired and\nhe you looked for all kinds of how to how to keep a little bit of Shabbas, to not to forget\nthat there is a Shabbas.

And the Lubavitcha Rebbe thought before before the war it was a question that\nmy family has to go to AustraliA: So, the Lubavitcha Rebbe, in the first letter, where\nhe good wishes for coming out from Russia and escaping Russia and this. And he said,\nyour family, that were with you in contact from Australia is still there. And it's worthful\nto start again about papers to go to AustraliA: Okay. And then after the one month, you\ngo ina the DP camp in Austria for a half a year, about six month.

        "Q: Now, Mr. Wilschanski, one last question. And so much of your experience during the\nwar was around this group of people, a very, very important story for you. And just\ntaking from that and the in the larger experience, what in in your your sense, in your\nspirit, what message would you want to pass on to the younger generation in that kind of\nHashkafic message to future generations, what happened to you and your family, what\nare the if I can put it in that way, what are the lessons from your experience?",
        "A: I see that the one thing that helped us to go through all this difficult times, for us,\nus us youths, us kids, and then with us young boys, and later, 1s because we were very,\nvery strong with the way that the older generation made it for us. All the prescriptions, I\nsay, the terror, the rebbeshte, the Rebbe, Lubavitcha Rebbe, was always holding us in\ndas inthe in the hardest times. It was the only the only wish, that once it will come that\nwe can be together and practice our religion openly without any persecutions, without\nany difficulties. And that's it. That's what holded us. And when you we came in a free\nland. It's much difficult more difficult than it was there to see you. Because\nyou you you know how the Talmud say, the eyes see and the heart want it. There\nyou you know that you can't go left or right. You have to go in the right way, in the\nmiddle way. And that has the younger generation generation to look and to learn from\nthe older ones. We learned this from before us. Say later I'm not too much learn from us\nbut still, they can look it was every generation has to look for the other. And, most of all,\nwe have we have where to go. We have an open way, a very, very wide way and a good\nway. And that what holded us for the thousands of years and that's what hold us now.\nAnd that's the biggest miracle in the world. The Rabbi gezucht, you wanna make revenge,\nthe Yiddish word from Hitler, go in the Jewish in Jewish way; that will be the biggest\nvengeance, zestas (ph), against Hitler, a yemach shemo v'zechrai. I have a an anichle.\nAnd he's now in in Milana, in das. And there in Milana a family is a man and a wife and\nan aunt. That's a family. Not us. And he, Baruch HaShem, have four kinderlach. Then\nmaybe he got three. And he come in tram train. Come here, kinderlach. No, tati, tati, tati,\ntati. In Italiano, \"Lady, nu, that's all what you have? That's it? Yes? And you you plan to\nhave more\"? \"Yeah.\" \"How much? How much?\" Das. \"Six million,\" he told her. And\nthat's all your your fault. Yiddin doffin nissin, doffin gein in de richten de vag. And that\nwill be the biggest, the biggest revenge against our enemies. And, Zecher, with HaShem\nhelp, that we will be the victorious. We will das, das.",

And that's what\nthey did. Because they didn't want to to the religion, it wasn't a Shabbas. It wasn't\nlahaudil, a Sunday. No religion. This this week, it is it is Thursday, the other week it\nwas Friday, the other week it was Monday. You see? But the families that still hold the\nreligion, it was very, very hard. If somebody didn't come to do work, he was fired and\nhe you looked for all kinds of how to how to keep a little bit of Shabbas, to not to forget\nthat there is a Shabbas.

Every time that the Russian took another another city, where they\ntook over back, it come a new new new details of all these things. We didn't knew\nexactly think that Auschwitz, Dachau, these things. Later we heard that it was special\ncamps. But we knew that it was an extermination. How it come exactly, we didn't knew\nthe first ttme. Then it people come from there, every everything is is no families, no\nnothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing from from big families, that's it.

But we didn't knew exactly what's going\non later, you see? We hear that later later it was very, very hard. That was people that\ncome later and they said that it's not better than it was before. And even even till '53,\nwhen Stalin, Stalin was dead, they said it was even worse. Because he was a maniac and\nhe started again and again and again to exterminate all whatever it took. He thought that\nit's against him. And that's what we heard already when we were out. Because it it it\ndidn't took a long time, a few time till they started again back.

        "A: parted. Four sections, yes. American, French, Russia and and English. And we were\nin the American section. And from there, writing to the Rebbe. One month we stayed in\nViennA: Before the American UNRAA, that's the UN the UNRRA, they put every\npeople in another another DP loggers, DP camps. So we wrote a letter to the Lubavitcha\nRebbe. And the Lubavitcha Rebbe thought before before the war it was a question that\nmy family has to go to AustraliA: So, the Lubavitcha Rebbe, in the first letter, where\nhe good wishes for coming out from Russia and escaping Russia and this. And he said,\nyour family, that were with you in contact from Australia is still there. And it's worthful\nto start again about papers to go to AustraliA: Okay. And then after the one month, you\ngo ina the DP camp in Austria for a half a year, about six month.

And and the director of this of this office, he took he\nmade made he spoke about papers for for the Lubavitcha people people from our from\nour camp to come to to Paris. And that was in May, in May, 1947, that we came a a\ngroup of 35 families, the first group in Paris. And it it doesn't want it. French doesn't\nwant people, too much refugees, to have there. But it it called that we are going through\nto another I don't remember exact to which to which country. I have somewhere the still\neven the visA: Okay.

When they come, I write the Rebbe, now the\nyeshiva is here and I would like to go back to the yeshivA: And the Rebbe answered me,\na kotzin letter, not not a longer letter like before, the whole the whole goal of learning\nTorah with Talmud is to know how to turn to do a good thing for another Yid. You have\nto work to help in the office that's all and HaShem will help you. And there.",
        "So my whole family was working about going to AustraliA: And I stayed in Paris. And\nthen I from about about a year later, I married there. And I continued to work all the all\nthe time in in the Lubavitcha office there.",
        "A: Twentyfive years.",
        "A: Thirtyfive years. From '47 to '72. The family things, my first wife, La Hasholem, Olah\nV'Shalom, got to leave us, with this Rebbe says coming, this Rebbe already, and I\ncontinued to work here till about 10 years ago, something like this, I was all working for\nthe office in a in Paris. That's it.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Yes.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay. Coming coming to Paris, nothing now, Paris is very, very very big\nLubavitcher community. Young people, young young generation. But a very it's\nvery there is five big schools what have about about 2,000 kids, Lubavitcher schools.",
        "A: That's in Paris and around Paris. And synagogues for Lubavitch, special synagogues in\ntowns. It all started from our office, a round little office. It was printed things mit us\ncoming here. As I say, that is in the City of Vedicu, very known Yiddish and das. And, as\nI told you, here is here it says underground religious academy underground religious\nacademy in the City of Vedicu. And here is no no date. No date. Nothing down here.\nHere we are the the students, to say say like this. Here I am. This is Iam here. And I\nwas in this time, I was the youngest one of this whole group. And when this that was\ntaking this photograph, I was I was teves 13 years and three months. Thirteen years and\nthree months. And it was in December, 1937. We were sitting in a little shul, in a little\nshul. That's the guardian of the shul. We were sitting in the basement, but not a basement.\nIt's a cave. We were sitting all together with our teacher. That's our teacher. He came",
        "from BelarusiA: And he knew everybody knew that this very, very dangerous to learn\nwith kids, when this Soviet government has to learn communism. And that's his\ncontribution. Contribution. But that was the goal of of giving over to the coming\ngeneration. And that was the the mission with the Lubavitcha Rebbe gave when a when\nhe left Russia: Not to leave the religion to go out. And it has to go do without thinking\nabout themself.\nThat's in in the guardian. That's that's this one is now in an old age home here in\nBrooklyn. This one is down in Brooklyn still. And and that's all what's what's what's\nleft from this from this photography. And that's it.",
        "A: Nu.",
        "A: How come? Because now, in this time, you can you can go there. They find out the\nwhole the whole the whole the whole tik, nu? The whole nu the whole papers from\nthere, what was going on, the whole interrogations mit all these things. Nu?",
        "A: Sure. But but now they give it out. They give it out. It's one of mine mine the son of\nthis one, you you you he went to RussiA: And this one, the son of him. And he found\nout this papers and he made it and das it. Here it say.",
        "A: I see that the one thing that helped us to go through all this difficult times, for us,\nus us youths, us kids, and then with us young boys, and later, 1s because we were very,\nvery strong with the way that the older generation made it for us. All the prescriptions, I\nsay, the terror, the rebbeshte, the Rebbe, Lubavitcha Rebbe, was always holding us in\ndas inthe in the hardest times. It was the only the only wish, that once it will come that\nwe can be together and practice our religion openly without any persecutions, without\nany difficulties. And that's it. That's what holded us. And when you we came in a free\nland. It's much difficult more difficult than it was there to see you. Because\nyou you you know how the Talmud say, the eyes see and the heart want it. There\nyou you know that you can't go left or right. You have to go in the right way, in the\nmiddle way. And that has the younger generation generation to look and to learn from\nthe older ones. We learned this from before us. Say later I'm not too much learn from us\nbut still, they can look it was every generation has to look for the other. And, most of all,\nwe have we have where to go. We have an open way, a very, very wide way and a good\nway. And that what holded us for the thousands of years and that's what hold us now.\nAnd that's the biggest miracle in the world. The Rabbi gezucht, you wanna make revenge,\nthe Yiddish word from Hitler, go in the Jewish in Jewish way; that will be the biggest\nvengeance, zestas (ph), against Hitler, a yemach shemo v'zechrai. I have a an anichle.\nAnd he's now in in Milana, in das. And there in Milana a family is a man and a wife and\nan aunt. That's a family. Not us. And he, Baruch HaShem, have four kinderlach. Then\nmaybe he got three. And he come in tram train. Come here, kinderlach. No, tati, tati, tati,\ntati. In Italiano, \"Lady, nu, that's all what you have? That's it? Yes? And you you plan to\nhave more\"? \"Yeah.\" \"How much? How much?\" Das. \"Six million,\" he told her. And\nthat's all your your fault. Yiddin doffin nissin, doffin gein in de richten de vag. And that\nwill be the biggest, the biggest revenge against our enemies. And, Zecher, with HaShem\nhelp, that we will be the victorious. We will das, das.",
