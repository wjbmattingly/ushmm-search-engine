Your father is the one\nwho forced you to be drafted, and then you could leave that. How did you come to\nknow, or come to believe that the allies would win the war, and the Germans would\nlose it?

Your father is the one\nwho forced you to be drafted, and then you could leave that. How did you come to\nknow, or come to believe that the allies would win the war, and the Germans would\nlose it? That\u2019s thinking about strategy, about military, about where the war is going.\nNot everybody would have had that opinion. They would have just slogged on.",
