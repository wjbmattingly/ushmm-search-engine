        "Q: This \u2014 yeah. One of the reasons I ask this is that \u2014 is just it\u2019s, in today\u2019s world,\nwhen we\u2019re talking in 2015, it sounds almost inconceivable, that with our means of\ninformation and communication, that we wouldn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on ina\ncountry that\u2019s next to our own, because you find out so quickly.",
        "A: Well, Russians, who had a clamp on everything, on \u2014 on \u2014 on whatever was\nhappening, the government had a clamp on it. The propaganda came right from the\nmain \u2014 from Moscow. There people are not allowed to listen to radio. Of \u2014 what\nthey were reading in the papers was written by the government.

        "Q: In the late 30s, of course, as you say, there was talk of war. Do you remember\nwhat the summer of 1939 was like, what you were doing?",
        "A: Well, yes, the international situation was very on the edge, very s \u2014 on the edge,\nas you \u2014 Germans were pressing more and more for that territory, and threatening,\nand Poland had a problem, because for practically 150 years, Poland as a nation, as\na country in Europe did not exist. It was not on the map of Europe. It was divided\ninto three parts. Parts of Russia, parts of Germany, parts of Austria. Those\ncountries tr \u2014 took advantage of Poland\u2019s production, they \u2014 they milked Poland to\ndeath, taking advantage of everything. So, from 1920 to 1939, it wasn\u2019t even 20\nyears that Poland was a free country, taking care of its own. So we didn\u2019t \u2014 we\nwere not prepared for any kind of war. We were \u2014 Poland was building schools,\nroad, bridges, railroads. We were not prepared for the war, and it \u2014 but war was on\nthe \u2014 on the horizon.",
        "Q: That summer, did you \u2014 were you at home, were you on \u2014 in vacation, where \u2014\nwhat were you doing right before the war started?\nJanuary 25, 2015",

        "Q: Do you remember where you were?",
        "A: \u2014 no, we were \u2014 we were at home. As a matter of fact, wa \u2014 was \u2014 what I\nremember distinctly, we had two beautiful German Shepherd dogs. They were\nyoung dogs, they\u2019re guard dogs. And from the early morning, they were howling.\nThey were howling, and we didn\u2019t know what happened until we heard on the radio\nthat Germany attacked Poland. And that wa \u2014 so, very early in the morning on the\n19 \u2014",
        "Q: September first, yeah.",
        "A: Th-Th \u2014 oh \u2014 that was September, right?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, September first.",
        "A: First, that Germany attacked Poland. Within the next day, my father got his\norders to report to the town of Zhest(ph), where there was a big Polish army unit.",
        "Q: And where is Zhest(ph)?",
        "A: Zhest(ph) was the ep \u2014 west of \u2014 west of Nowogrodek. It divides \u2014 it\u2019s right on\nthe river, and it\u2019s \u2014 1t was like a fortress in the years past, and there was a thi \u2014\nJanuary 25, 2015\nthat\u2019s where my father was assigned to. He was reporting \u2014 had to report to his unit\nover there. I remember he li \u2014 leaving the town. We cried. I remember he went to\nhis bedroom, and on the wall there was a picture of Holy Mary, and he cried.",
        "Q: He cried.",
        "A: Because he had to leave his family. And I hold his \u2014 I was holding his hand, and\nI wa \u2014 cried with him. And he \u2014 we took him to the bus, he took a bus to Zhest(ph).",
        "Q: Hm. It\u2019s interesting. What do you think the dogs were howling at?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how, they had a feeling that some \u2014 some \u2014 something was\nhappening. And I \u2014 it was scary. It was really scary.",
        "Q: What happened after that?",
        "A: Well, lotta \u2014 lotta young people were drafted right away. They had to report to\nhis \u2014 to their military units. And within a few days, there was a \u2014 there were a\ncouple instances where German planes flew over Nowogrodek, but they \u2014 they\ndidn\u2019t drop a single bomb.",
        "Q: So, did you continue going to school?",
        "A: Yes, we continued going to school. Within about 10 days, my father came back.\nLet\u2019s face it, my father was in his lates \u2014 late 40s. There were, in the unit that my\nfather was assigned to, there were a lot of young officers that were very well\nJanuary 25, 2015\nprepared. My father was an old man already, considered in those times. So he was\nput on a standby and came home, in the uniform, and \u2014",
        "Q: That must have been a relief.",
        "A: Well, for us it was a \u2014 oh God, it was a real wonderful surprise. But it didn\u2019t last\nlong because on the 17\" of September, Russians march into Poland. Of course, we\ndidn\u2019t know at that time that they \u2014 what they had the agreement with Germany,\nthat as soon as Germany attacks Poland from the west, Russians will attack\nPoland from the east. Our forces were fighting as hard as they could to keep ra \u2014\nGermans from marching far into Poland, but eventually they did get all the way to\nWarsaw, to capital. But in the meantime, Russians took over the whole eastern part\nof Poland.",
        "Q: So, if they attacked, or marched in on September 17\", they must have reached\nNowogrodek within an hour.",
        "A: They were second day. They were second day they were 1n pol \u2014 in\nNowogrodek. We couldn\u2019t \u2014 we couldn\u2019t understand some Belarussians and Jews\nwere greeting them. They were greeting Russian soldiers marching into\nNowogrodek, and they were \u2014 the orang \u2014 Russian army was pitiful.",
        "Q: What do you mean \u2014 what do \u2014 why do you say that?\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: Neglected \u2014 neglected only \u2014 the ones on the horses, the horses were \u2014 some of\nthem were like skeletons. People were dirty in the \u2014 I could \u2014 it\u2019s hard to explain.\nWe had to c-compare what we were comparing to our soldiers that were really, you\nknow, sharp looking. This was misery. But they were in power, so what can we do?\nAnd within a \u2014 one day of getting into Nowogrodek, the terror s-started. Russians,\nwith the help of the local communists were arresting policemen, government\npeople, any military, teachers, priests, they were arresting. Pretty soon the local jail\nwas full of our local best \u2014 our local people. Of course \u2014",
        "Q: Did you know anybody \u2014",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Do you \u2014 do you know \u2014 did you pers \u2014",
        "A: Most of \u2014 most of our friends\u2019 fathers were in there. And of course, the second\nsay, my father was arrested. And the I \u2014 they arrested him 1n town, but in the\nafternoon he came home. They \u2014 they questioned him and released him, and I\nremember hearing my parents whispering, talking. My mother insisted that he\nleaves Nowogro\u00e9dek and goes over to the German side, to the town where he is\nfrom, where his family was, and my father didn\u2019t want to go because he wa \u2014 didn\u2019t\nwant to leave the family alone. Well, he \u2014 he \u2014 they didn\u2019t have to make a decision,\nbecause that night we were already in bed, some of us, some of them were going to\nJanuary 25, 2015\nbed. There was a \u2014 rifle butts against the doors, banging on the doors. Local Jews \u2014\nJew, with a red band just [indecipherable] that he was a \u2014 one of the commissars\nthat became communist commissar, led three or four, I don\u2019t remember now,\nRussian soldiers with the rifles with bayonets. They took my father, they put the br\n\u2014 put him [indecipherable] and marched him, and that was the last time we seen\nhim.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: We haven\u2019t seen him since. For \u2014 for quite a while, it got to be known that if the\njail would allow us to be \u2014 to give some food parcel or clothes parcel to the people\nin jail, that meant that the person was still in jail. After about two or three weeks,\nthey stopped taking parcels. That was indication that my father was not in local jail\nany more. Where, or how, we don\u2019t know. We could never, during the war, after the\nwar, we could never find out what happened to him.",
        "Q: Did you know \u2014",
        "A: And du \u2014 du \u2014 his main sin was that he was active in a community life, that he\nfought at least Russians in 1920. Russians and Germans practiced the same thing. If\nyou eliminate leaders of the community, it\u2019s going to be that much easier to run the\ncommunity. Well, that was my father\u2019s problem. He was active of the \u2014 in his\ncommunity life, so they had to get rid of him.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "Q: Well, when they came into the house, did they give a reason?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: They searched, of course, they searched the house, and \u2014 and \u2014",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And \u2014 and \u2014 but it turn out there were a lot of Jews in Poland that were\ncommunists, and there were some \u2014 there were some [indecipherable] people that\nwere communists. And they, of course, right away worked for Russians, worked for\ncommunists.",
        "Q: Were there \u2014 was there a Polish communist party?",
        "A: There \u2014 not legal.",

        "A: Of course, of course, of course.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "Q: Okay. What a terror for your family.",
        "A: Oh God, it was terrible. On top of it, within a couple weeks of arresting my\nfather, Russians authorities came, lived on the edge of the town \u2014 and like I said, we\nhad a big house, we had a big barn, they wanted our property, because they wanted\nto \u2014 for Russian people to take to live in there. My mother insisted that we will\nmove if they give us a house to move in. And that\u2019s why we did \u2014 we were not very\nsurprised when on the 10\" of February, 1940, again a Russian officer with a \u2014 some\nsoldiers, at night \u2014 they always done all those arresting and deporting at night. They\n\u2014 it was the middle of the winter, cold, about a foot or so of snow. They marched to\nour house and told us to get ready, pick \u2014 get ready, pick up whatever you can carry,\nbecause you\u2019re getting deported.",
        "Q: Was this the same house, or had you moved?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s the same house. But we were \u2014 we were thought that we were being\ndeported from our house to the other house. We were \u2014 we went \u2014 we didn\u2019t know\nwe were being deported to Russia, to Siberia. So 1t was quite a shock.",
        "Q: Oh my. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about the months in between. Did you ever go to the\nprison where your father was, to bring food?",
        "A: My mother used to.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: My mother used to, at least few times a week. Sh \u2014",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You know, from the street, I seen the entrance to it, was big \u2014",
        "Q: Was it \u2014 was it a city jail, or something?",
        "A: It was a city jail, yes.",
        "Q: And how long was it that your father was held there, you think?",
        "A: Well, we\u2019re \u2014 as a matter of fact, we were pretty sure that, although they were\nnot taking parcels to him, that he was still there, because there was my sister\u2019s\nfriend, my gir \u2014 her girlfriend, when she wasn\u2019t a \u2014 she wasn\u2019t deported, so she was\nthere, and she, after the war, she told us that she saw my father about a month \u2014\nmonth or so after we were deported, he was being led to the railroad by \u2014 with a\ngroup of other prisoners, and she knew my father well. And, as a matter of fact,\nsupposedly my father asked her, cause when he spotted her, where are we? What\nJanuary 25, 2015\nhappened to his family. And of course she said that she told him that we were\nalready deported to Russia. And that\u2019s what happened. After the war she told us.\nThat\u2019s when she told us.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s talk about this a little bit more. You say you never found out what\nhappened to your father. That is, in \u2014 where \u2014 what his destiny was, where he was\ntaken, or anything. Is that \u2014 that so?",
        "A: That\u2019s correct, yes. We tried, through Red Cross, we \u2014 all kinds of institutions\nthat had lists of \u2014 of our people that were murdered, in Katyn forest, in other areas.\nWe \u2014 n-none of those lists have my father\u2019s name.",
        "Q: So this \u2014",
        "A: But then, of course, they were \u2014 lot of our people, lot of men and women were\nmurdered in the small towns and buried right there, close to it. And some cemeteries\nwere never found out, never opened, never found out where, who was.",
        "Q: Yeah. And did you ever go back to Nowogrodek after the war?",
        "A: I did not. My brother and my sister did. As a matter of fact, they went to there, to\nour house, our \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 original house. And people were afraid. They thought that they were coming to\ntake over, because there were people living there.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "Q: Yeah. What years did they go, or what year did they go there?",
        "A: Oh, this must be about \u2014 at least 10 years ago.",
        "Q: So would be like 2005?",
        "A: Yeah, something like that, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, so would have been, oh man, 65 years after \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 afterwards.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And in 2005 if they were there, then it was Belarus.",
        "A: Belarus, yes. They flew from Warsaw to Linz, and then they took a \u2014 I think a\ncar, and drove to Nowogrodek.",
        "Q: And was it feasible, or was it already, you know, no ho \u2014 no hope that there\nmight be some information in the municipal records about your father?",
        "A: Nothing, nothing, nothing could be found.",
        "Q: They looked? Or they tried?",
        "A: They \u2014 they s \u2014 they tried, yes. Nothing could be found of what happened to my\nfather, which 1s so painful that we still don\u2019t know what happened to him.",
        "Q: About \u2014 did \u2014 was there ever any story about, or any research done on any of the\nprisoners, or of the \u2014 the fact that they were held in this city jail for \u2014 you know, the\nJanuary 25, 2015\nja\u2014as you Said, the jails filled up so quickly after the Soviets marched in, and what\nhappened to most of the people there.",
        "A: Well, si\u2014 you see, the Russians, probably some of the lists of people that they\nwere arrested, and some of the people that they murdered, it j \u2014 it just happens that\nBelarussians do also have lists of people that they arrested. They were arrested in\nthat territory.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And th-they were \u2014 for some stupid reason, they will not release that list. So\nthere is possibility that my father could be on that list, but th-th \u2014 the \u2014 the existing\ngovernment of Belarus will not \u2014 not release that list.",
        "Q: Won\u2019t \u2014 so that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 yeah, I understand. I understand. Before we go to\nthat night where you thought you were being taken to your second home in \u2014 or\nanother house, and it turned out not to be the case, tell me a little bit about those\nmonths in between, about October, November, December. How did life progress?\nWhat was going on with your mother, your \u2014 your businesses?",
        "Q: Well, well, the business they took over right away. Within a week they took over\nthe business, and my mother worked for them. She had to work for them, and so it\nwasn\u2019t our business any more. As far as the life, right away there were shortages of\njust about everything. Even the \u2014 such a thing as salt, y-you had to queue \u2014 line up\nJanuary 25, 2015\nfor hours sometime to get some salt. Sugar was hardly ever in the stores. Meat. The\nonly thing that we could get pretty easy was bread, but otherwise, there were\nshortages of everything.",
        "Q: How do you explain that?",
        "A: Well, Russians were exporting \u2014 taking everything into Russia. There were\ntrains being loaded and taken into the deep Russia.",
        "Q: And of course, supply lines were \u2014 were cut.",
        "A: Acor \u2014 of course. So \u2014 and of course the \u2014 the life was miserable. Everybody \u2014\nthe fear \u2014 this 1s the way they run the country, fear. One person against the other.\nAnd they, right away that \u2014 did that fear took over the whole town. People were\nafraid, they were li \u2014 would \u2014 before they would say anything, they would look\naround if there was anybody listening. Because all you had to do was say something\nabout that you were not pleased what was happening, you can wind up in jail right\naway.",
        "Q: Did this extend to school, as well?",
        "A: Well, of course, the teachers were our old teachers, but at least once a week we\nwould have to have special classes, where they would try to convince us of what a\nwonderful country, what a free country Russia is, how \u2014 how advanced, how \u2014 of\ncourse, we knew better, even though we were children.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "Q: So, what \u2014 what happened to that gentleman, you said his name was Alex, or\nAlexi, who was working with you \u2014 working for your father?",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 he left us. As soon as Russians came in, he left. He ma \u2014 he was there\nmaybe a couple days and he left. I don\u2019t know what \u2014 what happened. Maybe he\nwas afraid that they would put him in jail, too, because he escaped from there. But\nh-he left and ru \u2014 I don\u2019t recall ever seeing him, or hearing of him again.",
        "Q: Okay. Now Id like to \u2014 I\u2019d like to broach a subject that is a \u2014 a painful one, and\na very sensitive one, but you \u2014 you mentioned that it was a local Jewish communist\nwho came in when \u2014 when they arrested your father, and took him away. How \u2014\nhow did people \u2014 did people say, uh-huh, the Jews have betrayed us? Was that a\nsentiment?",
        "A: Exactly. That was the feeling. That was \u2014 there were \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say they were\nall \u2014 all of them were communists, but there was quite a few of them, and the ones\nthat did it, right away took \u2014 took over some th \u2014 important position in local\ngovernment. They \u2014 they \u2014 quite a few of them.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: But not all of them.",
        "Q: Were there any people who, let\u2019s say were Jewish and well-to-do, who were also\narrested?\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: Not \u2014 no \u2014 not that I know of.",
        "Q: I see.",

        "Q: Or deported, for example?",
        "A: Not at that time. Later on I was told that they were, later on, just before\nGermany attacked Russia, there were some Russians \u2014 some jer \u2014 Jews were\narrested and deported into the deep Russia.",
        "Q: Before the war, how were relations \u2014 I mean, many Jewish people say that Poles\nare very anti-Semitic, or that anti-Semitism was rampant in Poland.",
        "A: Well, a lot of it 1s true, a lot of it is true. But, at the same time, if you know the\nreal life in all the European countries, Poland was pretty free [indecipherable] as\nfar as the religion is concerned.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, whoever \u2014 whatever religion you were, you were free to practice it. Before,\nin the first \u2014 30s, where Nazis took over Germany, they deported a lot of Jews to\nPoland, or a lot of Jews came into Poland for escape from Germany to Poland,\nand they were doing pretty good. But you have to realize that most of the industry,\nmost of the business in Poland was in Jews\u2019 hands. Jew \u2014 Jews had a saying that\nwas very popular, you have the streets, but we have the buildings on them. Which\nJanuary 25, 2015\nmeant that they \u2014 they were in control of quite a bit of industry, quite a bit of \u2014 bit\nof business. Now, there \u2014 they were known for being bankers, for \u2014 for doing lot of\ntrading and that. And sorry to say, but our average people don\u2019t like rich, rich\npeople. And they were \u2014 they represented the rich people. So lot of common people\nwere, of course, hateful of them. Wa \u2014 but we didn\u2019t have any \u2014 with Russians were\ndoing those pogroms and that, we de \u2014 we didn\u2019t have anything like that. But fact\nwas, we didn\u2019t like them, yes.",
        "Q: Were there any Jewish kids in your classes at school?",
        "A: Of course, of course. But there were some good Jews, and I have an example. I\nwas going to tell you that later. I will tell you later.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. I know that this is a very \u2014",
        "A: Touchy [indecipherable] subject.",
        "Q: \u2014 touchy \u2014 touchy sensi \u2014 it\u2019s very sensitive subject, but in \u2014 particularly in the\nareas of the kressi(ph), where there were so many different occupations and\noccupations by \u2014 by different forces, armies and \u2014 and so on. It was one of the\nreasons why I was asking you too, wha-what was the make-up of the towns, and the\npeople, and so on.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: Well, yes, like the \u2014 in Nowogro\u00e9dek there was a \u2014 quite a good sized population\nof Jews, but then there was also Belarussian and the Poles. It was pretty \u2014 I would\nsay it was evenly divided.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, we\u2019ll break for lunch right now.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: And come back and talk later \u2014",
        "A: Good.",
        "Q: \u2014 for \u2014 and take the story forward when \u2014",
        "A: Good.",
        "Q: \u2014 after you\u2019re arrested. Thank you.",
        "A: Good, good. I\u2019Il be here.\nEnd of File One\nJanuary 25, 2015\nBeginning File Two",
        "Q: Okay, so Mr. Szymel, we s \u2014 what we see here is a photograph. Tell me who is\nin the photograph?",
        "A: They\u2019re my family. My father, my mother, my grandmother, my older sister and\nme when I was one year old, practically one year old.",
        "Q: So that means it was taken in 1928.",
        "A: \u201829.",
        "Q: Oh, 1929.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how is it that you came to have this photograph?",
        "A: My parents send it to our relatives in Poland at that time, and when we were\nvisiting them after the war, we found it and they made a copy of it, and they \u2014 here\nitis. To me, it\u2019s a relic. It\u2019s \u2014 1t\u2019s something that I cherish, because that\u2019s the only\npicture of our childhood with our \u2014 babyhood, not just childhood.",
        "Q: Is it the only photo you have of your father?",
        "A: No, I have some others.",
        "Q: You have some others.",
        "A: Yes.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "Q: Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much, we can put it to the side now. Okay,\nbefore the break, we kind of stopped at the point where in February 10\", 1940,\nsoldiers came to your home again and in the middle of the night, knocked on the\ndoor and told you you are going to have to leave. Can you remember how long you\nhad to put your things together?",
        "A: They gave us about a half an hour, they told us that we have half an hour to pack\nwhatever we can carry. And of course, I was \u2014 we were being deported from our\nhouse. And \u2014 now this is the middle of the severe Polish kind of winter, about 25\ndegrees below zero, but at least a foot of snow on the ground. And middle of the\nnight, we \u2014 my grandmother and my brother and my sister, were put on this sled,\nhorse-drawn sled and my mother, my older sister and me, we walked. We walked,\nand we were taken to the government building, not far from railroad station, and the\nbuilding was pretty soon being filled up with a family li \u2014 just like ours. All the\npeople from Nowogrd\u00e9dek, most of them women and children, because most of the\nmen were either in jail, or \u2014 or gone somewhere. So, this is \u2014 this 1s the first day,\nfirst night of our experience, when they were being de \u2014 we were being deported to\nRussia.",
        "Q: What did you manage to take with you?\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: Well, most of we \u2014 what we tried, was we took clothing, some clothes, because\nof the fact that it was so cold, winter, and with that, there was hardly anything we\ncould carry. There were a few things that were put on the sled, but otherwise we had\nto carry everything. So most of 1t we \u2014 we took with us was clothes.",
        "Q: Okay. I-In that government building, you said there were families like your own.\nDid you recognize any of them?",
        "A: Of course, most of them were friends of our parents, and of us children. And so\nwe knew just about \u2014 at least 90 percent of people, they were either acquaintances,\nor friends of ours.",
        "Q: Then what happened?",
        "A: The next morning \u2014 the next morning they packed us \u2014 they told us we have to\nmarch to the railroad station. When we got there, there was a whole line of freight\ncars that were prepared for transporting mass people. The way it was built, on each\nend of the \u2014 the freight car, there were shelves, two shelves on each end, where they\npacked us, about 40 people to each car, which meant that we were to lay down like\nsardines, you know, one \u2014 you know, next to each other, on the mi \u2014 in the middle\nof the \u2014 th-the wa \u2014 the wagon, there was a coal \u2014 there was a cast iron stove, to\nprovide heat. And then on the side there was a hole in the floor of the car, as a \u2014 to\nserve as a toilet.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "Q: And that was it.",
        "A: And that was it.",

        "A: No, they were \u2014 they were \u2014 they were just managed.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We just managed to be either sitting down, or laying down on those platforms.\nOn this \u2014 on the top sides on each side there were small windows, with the crates \u2014\nwith the crates so, you know, nobody could get out.",
        "Q: With grates, mm-hm.",
        "A: And the \u2014 of course, the whole train was surrounded by Russian soldiers with\nrifles, so there was no way to get in or get on of the train. We were totally captive.",
        "Q: Did anybody at any point official, tell you why you had been arrested, or where\nyou were going?",
        "A: Not \u2014 not at all, not at all. Nothing, nothing there \u2014 there \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t ask us,\nthey wouldn\u2019t tell us, they were just giving us orders, do this, do that.",
        "Q: And the orders were, I take it, in Russian, yes?",
        "A: Of course, ti \u2014 only Russian.",
        "Q: Could \u2014 could you understand what they were saying?\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: Well, most of it, but 1f not, my mother would translate it to us.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: There were a lot of people that did not understand Russian, but like I say, lucky\nthere were a few people that would translate it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: There were no Polish, or Jewish, or Belarussian civilians involved in this. This\nwas strictly Russian soldiers that were guards.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And tha \u2014 and that was it.",
        "Q: Okay. Did that little \u2014 what place did you have? Di\u2014 were you in a bottom\nplatform, or a top platform?",
        "A: No, we were on the very top, on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the second level.",
        "Q: And were you able to see out a window, or \u2014",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 we would \u2014 we would, you know, if we \u2014 if you were next to the side\nof the \u2014 the wagon, or the car, then you could lock out \u2014 look out.",
        "Q: And was the win \u2014 did the window have glass, or not?",
        "A: Yes \u2014",
        "Q: It did.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 it had glass. It was so cold, and with some of the moisture in the air from\nbreathing, all the metal parts eventually were covered with a \u2014 ice.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: So that\u2019s how cold it was.",
        "Q: So that stove didn\u2019t do much good.",
        "A: Well, if you were next to it, yes. So we \u2014 we had everything that we brought\nwith us, we \u2014 were dressed in it. Later, when the doors were closed completely, it\nwi \u2014 it did warm up to the extent that we could take some of the clothes off.",
        "Q: Did you have any food with you?",
        "A: We brought si \u2014 very little, very little, but we did bring some.",
        "Q: Were you fed on the train?",

That was it.",
        "Q: Oh my. And \u2014 and then, when did the train start moving?",
        "A: Very next day. Very next day you started moving through the \u2014 we-went through\nthe \u2014 Baranowice, which was a big railroad center first. It was close to Russian\nJanuary 25, 2015\nborder. And then next day we crossed the \u2014 the border between Russia and Poland,\nall border.",
        "Q: How did you know when you got to the border that you were crossing 1t?",
        "A: Well, we would \u2014 we would read the signs. We could read the signs only \u2014 also,\nwe would see the miserable view of people. People were dressed in a shabby\nclothes, in a padded \u2014 women and men in the same, with the padded pants and\ncoats, miserable looking people, moving around like robots. And we \u2014 you could\ntell that it was not Poland any more.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did you have a sense of what your final destination would be?",
        "A: Well, by that time they did ha \u2014 it did come \u2014 I don\u2019t know how it \u2014 it was told\nus that \u2014 we were told we\u2019re being deported to Siberia, but where Siberia, we\ndidn\u2019t have the slightest idea.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did people get sick on the train journey?",
        "A: Well, not so much physically, but emotionally. There was a lot of crying. There\nwas lot of \u2014 most of it was, I would say crying and sobbing from all the mothers\nthat were there with all the small children. It was \u2014 the feeling was terrible, terrible.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You have to realize that we were not a priority, so the train sometime would stop\nfor the longest time on the sidings, and then we\u2019d continue going. And eventually\nJanuary 25, 2015\nwe atrived in Moscow. The reason we knew, because we could see the signs,\nMoscow on the \u2014 on \u2014 in the station.",

        "A: Before we were going east, now we were going straight north.",
        "Q: And how could you tell?",
        "A: Well, we could tell by sun, by \u2014 most of it sun, you know, that\u2019s we \u2014 we\nchanged the direction. And of course the \u2014 the \u2014 the countryside that we would see\nthrough those windows was changing gradually too. There were more snow, more \u2014\nit was getting colder, and there were more and more forests. And we traveled\nanother two \u2014 after Moscow, we traveled another two weeks, directly north.",
        "Q: Oh wow. So, it took a long time actually.",
        "A: Totally it took us three weeks on the train. By the time we got to our destination,\nwhich we didn\u2019t know it was our destination, but the \u2014 the name of the town was\nJanuary 25, 2015\nVowogda(ph), which was a big railroad center. And up there we were told to get\nout of the train, and they put us on a slow horse-drawn sleds. And again, the grown-\nups and older children had to walk. Only the smaller and old were riding 1-1n the\nsled. And for three days we traveled to our final destination, staying at night,\nstaying at the local schools. And few of them, we could see there was somebody\nspending nights up there before, most likely people just like us, the deportees, that\nthey were spending nights up there. And thi \u2014",

        "A: My mother was a trooper. She was so strong. She was so \u2014 how shall I put it?\nShe \u2014 she could practically do miracles. She would, if she had the chance, she\nwould warm up some water for us so we could drink s \u2014 warm water. She would\ndivide pieces of bread into few pieces so every few hours we would have a few\nbites of bread. She was unbelievably strong.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did \u2014 did she cry during the trip?",
        "A: Not that I seen here. She was \u2014 she wa \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t allow herself to see us that\nshe cried.",

        "Q: And, were you thinking of what your father had said before?",
        "A: Well, not at that time, but after that, when I grew up, many a times it came to my\nmind what \u2014 what he meant.",
        "Q: Because at that time it sounds like your mother was taking the burdens on her\nshoulders.",
        "A: She \u2014 totally, totally. She was in charge. She was in charge.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "Q: When you \u2014 when did you \u2014 where did you end up being your \u2014 what ended up\nbeing your final destination?",
        "A: Well, on the third day we arrived what \u2014 which was a logging camp. There were\nabout five bar \u2014 wooden, log barra \u2014 barracks, designed for the people that would\nwork f-falling timber \u2014 logging. And \u2014",
        "Q: What was the name of this place?",
        "A: The \u2014 the name was Rzhavka(ph), which took the name from the small river that\nflow through it. The ri \u2014 the name of the river was Rzhavka(ph), which means\nrusty. And the \u2014 the reason it was rusty \u2014 called rusty, because the water in it was\ncolored of \u2014",
        "Q: Of rust?",
        "A: \u2014 rust, yes. From the vegetation that it flowed, the \u2014 most of the area were\nmarshes, and the \u2014 our camp was on the lower hill, among marshes, right in the\nmiddle of virgin forests.",
        "Q: That sounds very pretty, actually.",
        "A: It \u2014 1t wasn \u2014 part of it was beautiful, not just pretty, 1t was beautiful. The nature\ncan be that way, but it \u2014 they \u2014 also can be cruel, because of the cold, because of the\nterrain and whatever.",
        "Q: So your \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 settlement that you go to is Rzhavka(ph), yeah?\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And they \u2014 it\u2019s made of \u2014 it\u2019s comprised of five log cabins?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a rather small place \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s not a cabin, it\u2019s a big building.",
        "Q: Oh, big buildings, okay.",
        "A: Big building, well, I would say the length of my \u2014 this, my house, and there be\nanywhere 30 to 40 people in each building.",
        "Q: So it was like a barracks?",
        "A: It was a barrack, yes. And 1n \u2014 each side had a couple windows in it, and a big\nstove, and brick stove for heat, and for you \u2014 there was some cooking you could\ncook up there, but it was a big stove.",
        "Q: So di \u2014 were \u2014 was everybody responsible for their own food, their own cooking\nat this place?",
        "A: Well, there was \u2014 we didn\u2019t have t \u2014 anything to cook, first of all.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So we were rely \u2014 we had to rely on what was in the camp. There was a bakery,\nand there was a, what they called restaurant, where, if you had money, and you had\na coupon, you could buy some soup, and of course, you could buy your allowance\nJanuary 25, 2015\nof bread. Everybody, every person, child and old people were assigned 200 grams\nof bread, black bread, which amounted sometime to a couple of slices. We were\nassigned that much a day, and we could buy it. That \u2014 no more, no less, but that was\nwhat we could buy.",
        "Q: So, in other words, you weren\u2019t given food.",
        "A: No, we had to buy it.",
        "Q: And in the beginning, how did you buy it, if you had no money\u2019?",
        "A: Well, we had some money with us.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: We brought some money because at that time in \u2014 in Nowogrodek, the \u2014 the\ncurrency already was Russian dru \u2014 ruble.",
        "Q: Okay, let me go back for that, I didn\u2019t think of this before. Your family had been\nwell-to-do, and when the Soviets took over, then they nationalized and took away\nyour businesses. But wer \u2014 were you given any compensation?",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t know, but my mother would get paid \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 for her work.",
        "Q: And so that\u2019s where she had the rubles from.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: Well, we also had \u2014 it turned out my mother has quite a bit of money. We,\namong other things we had a beautiful horse. And the young man that worked for\nus, and he still lived with us when Russians came in, told my mother that he heard,\namong men, that they were goin \u2014 the Russians were going to take our horse away.\nBut he suggested that he \u2014 he even had the person that was willing to buy our horse,\nsomebody connected to the Russians, that he would buy our horse. And my mother\nsold that horse, and she got quite a bit of money for it.",
        "Q: And she took that one you left.",
        "A: And sh \u2014 and it turned out, that was the money that saved us in Russia.",
        "Q: That\u2019s an interesting point. I wanted to \u2014 to get a sense of when you had \u2014",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 when you took clothes and no food, then you were in a \u2014 in \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, I \u2014 I\u2014 w-we never seen the money, my mother never showed it to us. But\nI know that for a fact, that she sold the horse, and I didn\u2019t know how much she got.\nOf course, I got to know it later, when we were outside Russia.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So when you first got there, she had a way of being able to buy food for\nyou.",
        "A: Well, it was \u2014 you know, whatever was assigned to us. And of course, she got \u2014\nshe was one of the first that she got a job. Her job was to bring water from the river,\nJanuary 25, 2015\nthat was farther on, not wer \u2014 next to our camp, there was a area about a couple\nkilometers from there, where there was a spring. And she would bring clear water.\nSh \u2014 what she would have to do 1s fill the wooden barrels, which were on this wood\n\u2014 on this horse-drawn sled. She would have to go to the \u2014 chop the ice, fill ti \u2014 with\nthe bucket, walk up and fill up the barrels, and then take it to the bakery, take the\nwater there. Again, dip the water out of the barrels and take it to the barrels inside\nthe bakery. She would do that all day long. It wou \u2014 believe me, I helped her\nsometime, it was a back blake \u2014 breaking job. And especially, she used to wear a\nsack in front of her as a apron. From splashing water and freezing, she sounded like\nshe was a\u2014 she was armor, th-the \u2014 the ice so \u2014",
        "Q: It would freeze, huh?",
        "A: \u2014 freeze, it would freeze. She \u2014 but she never gave up, she worked, because she\nhad six mouths to feed.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Your grandmother too.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s right. Well, all of us, were si-six of us.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, she worked very hard.",
        "Q: Was your sister put to work?\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: When my sister turned 16, I believe \u2014 anybody over the age of 16 had to work.\nAnd lucky for \u2014 for her, she got a job in the local nursery, so she took care of little\nchildren. At least she didn\u2019t have to work in \u2014 because the \u2014 all the other \u2014 and the\nother industry was logging.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And eventually my mother worked there too. What the de \u2014 women would do,\nwhen the men felled the trees, the women would chop the branches, and clear the\nsnow so the \u2014 the horse-drawn drivers would haul the logs up to main drag, and\nthen big, huge sleds, pulled by the tractors, would dr-draw \u2014 would draw those logs\nto the river, which again in the spring would be floated to the destination whate \u2014\nwhatever it was.",
        "Q: I want to go back to one point, just to make it clear, and it\u2019s about the food. That\nis, you were able to buy food for yourselves if you had the money, but not as much\nas you wanted to.",
        "A: Only one bre \u2014 specially the bread, that was assigned to you.",
        "Q: So in other words, it was rationed, but it wasn\u2019t handed out.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: It was rationed in the sense that you could only get a certain portion.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "Q: And you had to pay for it.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay. And that was with all food?",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The \u2014 the only thing is, all the time we were there, we never had any \u2014 even the\nsmallest amount of sugar. The \u2014 n-no butter, no meat. I nev \u2014",
        "Q: So what did you have, what did you eat?",
        "A: Bread.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Moi-\u2014 mainly bread. Sometime later, in \u2014 when we were already a couple years\nin Russia, in there \u2014 well, maybe a year, they allowed f\u2014 us to receive parcels from\nPoland. And sometime \u2014 my grandmother, sometime some friends \u2014 as a matter of\nfact, we received a package of food from one of the Jews of Nowogrodek that owed\nmy father some money. And he \u2014 he looked into it and found our address where we\nwere at, and send us lifesaving food that we\u2019re \u2014 I\u2019m still grateful for it. So, like I\nsaid before, there were Jews, and there were Jews.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Just like there are Poles and there are Poles.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "Q: Thank you for that. Thank you for sharing that. Oh, do you remember what it\nwas that was in that package?",
        "A: I think it \u2014 most of it was pork belly, which is, to us, was \u2014 God, 1t was \u2014",
        "Q: There\u2019s a lot you can do with pork belly.",
        "A: Exactly. Especially when you\u2019re starving, a little bit of fat \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 1s \u2014 it\u2019s a treasure.",
        "Q: Yeah. So, did anyone get sick here?",
        "A: Lot of people. Within a, I would say six months of being in that camp, we started\nlosing some infants, some babies. There was no \u2014 women didn\u2019t have enough milk\nto feed the babies, there was no milk to be had. The babies were starving, they were\ndying. Pretty soon, about a kilometer behind our camp, on a little hill, started appear\nwood crosses. And after children, little children, the older people started dying.\nWithin a year, we must have lost oh, at least 50 people, older people. Our camp\nconsisted of people from two different parts of Poland. Half of us were from\nNowogrodek, and half were from the southern part of where \u2014 what was \u2014 what is\nnow Ukraine, close to the Lwow. So there were people from two \u2014 two different\nparts of Poland.",
        "Q: In \u2014 how large was the camp, population-wise.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: It was about, I would say, close to 500 people.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s a lot.",
        "A: Quite a few. There were, as far as Russians, there was one man, commander \u2014\ncommandant, we called him commandant. And there was one KGB man, and one\nbakers with his family. And there was one Russian 1-1n th \u2014 a woman, which wer \u2014\nshe was in charge of the restaurant.",
        "Q: That\u2019s an important position.",
        "A: Very important. The rest of it was Polish people.",
        "Q: And \u2014 how \u2014 what was their manner towards you, how did they behave towards\nyou?",
        "A: Well, of course, the \u2014 the commandant wasn\u2019t bad man, but the \u2014 but the KGB,\nhe was typical communist. To him, the only thing that mattered was his party, his\nnation, and he tried to convince us that we should be grateful that we wound up in\nRussia. Within about six months, they opened a school, wi-with one teacher,\nRussian, of course. And everybody, all the children, until 16 years, they had to go to\nschool. And of course, we didn\u2019t mind subjects like math and arc \u2014 physics,\nchemistry, or whatever. But of course they also tried to convince us again of the\nadvantages of communist system, which didn\u2019t work with us at all.",
        "Q: So how did it \u2014 did children just stay silent when this sort of \u2014\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we learn how to go along with them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Just to get a ga \u2014 got along them. They \u2014 I \u2014 I was already twel \u2014 like I said, I\nwas 12 years old, and what happened to me once, sometime we would sit on the\nbench, couple of our boys, and we sing our Polish national songs. And they through\n\u2014 we were trying to get our teacher mad. And one day he called me in and he told\nme if I keep it up, nothing may happen to me, but my mother wi \u2014 may wind up in \u2014\nin jail. So of course, we stopped doing that, too.",
        "Q: What kind of interaction was there with the KGB men? Like what \u2014 what was\nhis \u2014 what was his function? How did he \u2014 how did he \u2014 what was his role in your\nlife? Did he come and just talk to people, or did he \u2014",
        "A: Well, he wanted \u2014 he wanted to make sure we were afraid of him.",
        "Q: So how did he ensure that?",
        "A: Well, his manner, first of all, his manner. He would march into to the room, told\nthe kids, sit down. You know, his voice, his manner, and h-he would really rough\nkind of a talk, let us know that he was in a cha \u2014 in charge, he was the boss.",
        "Q: Was there informing going on?",
        "A: Very \u2014 if there was, it must have been very little, because we were \u2014 pe-people\nwere very, very well in touch with another. If there was, I never heard of any.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "Q: Okay. So it wasn\u2019t the same sort of situation as even back home, where people\nstarted being afraid of what they would say in \u2014 in public.",
        "A: No, in the camp \u2014 in the camp, wa-wa-wa \u2014 it was w-w-wa \u2014 solidarity was a\nmain thing.",
        "Q: And, where did these officials live? How did they live?",
        "A: They had their own quarters. There was special barrack. In this special barrack\nthey \u2014 the baker has his couple rooms in there, next to the bakery, and so the \u2014 the\nwoman that\u2019s in charge of restaurant, and the KGB and \u2014 and the commander was \u2014\nthey had th-their own \u2014 their own building.",
        "Q: And you said the commandant was not such a bad guy.",
        "A: No, he \u2014 he \u2014 he was authority, but he didn\u2019t over \u2014 didn\u2019t abuse it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He \u2014 maybe he felt sorry for us, of anything.",
        "Q: Okay. And so it was mostly what he didn\u2019t do, rather than what he did.",
        "A: Exactly, exactly.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So, you \u2014 it took half a year for you to be in school after you arrived, so\nwhat did you do in that half year?",
        "A: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing. In the winter, there wasn\u2019t\nmuch you could do really, because eventually there were either four or five feet of\nJanuary 25, 2015\nsnow sometime. And in the \u2014 you were sometimes so cold that you couldn\u2019t even\nbreathe in the cold air, because 1t was \u2014 when you \u2014 if you didn\u2019t have anything in\nfront of your mouth, you could feel like knives, okay, cutting into your lungs. So\nyou always had to have something in you \u2014 in front of your face.",
        "Q: And your mother would work in this sort of situation?",
        "A: Yes, she did. Unless it got to be about \u2014 below 40 degrees, then nobody worked.\nBut if it was warmer than that, then everybody had to go work, and men w-worked\nfalling trees, and women doing the rest of it.",
        "Q: Here\u2019s a part I don\u2019t understand. I understand that she goes to a spring to get\nwater in the summertime, to haul it back up, but in the winter there\u2019s all this snow\noutside.",
        "A: Well, di \u2014 di \u2014 you had to shovel \u2014 you have to shovel the snow wherever you\ncould. Sometime it was like a tunnel between the \u2014 on the each side there be about\nfive feet of snow, and you just go. And the roads, with the passing of the sleds,\neventually, you know, it was a track that you could go by.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And of course, the snow lasted about Ma-May \u2014 May sometime, middle of May,\nbefore the snows would start to melt.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a long time.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: That\u2019s a long time. By June, it wer \u2014 snow was gone and then summer right\naway would start.",
        "Q: Would it be hot in summer?",
        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t say hot, but it was nice and warm, and it\u2019s \u2014 the beauty of\nnature up there at that time, everything explodes. Everything grows so fast, I never\nseen anything grow that fast in that humid, warm air. And as a matter of fact, if it\nwasn\u2019t for nature, I don\u2019t know if we would have survived. As soon as it got warm,\nsome \u2014 a different kind of mushrooms would appear in the forest. And children \u2014\nand I was among them, we would spend at least half a day, every other day, picking\nmushrooms. And later on, all kinds of berries: blackberries, raspberry \u2014 wild\nraspberries. And like I said before, if 1t wasn\u2019t for nature, I don\u2019t know if we would\nhave survived. The problem was, we could not preserve any of it for wintertime, so\nwe had to consume it right there. Sometime we would bring a bucketful of\nmushrooms, cook it and eat it for next couple meals. And that was my job, picking\nmushrooms, picking berries.",
        "Q: Had you done that at home?",
        "A: Mushrooms, yes, and berries of course, too. But I do \u2014 I done it for different\nreasons.",
        "Q: For pleasure.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: For pleasure. Here, it was to survive.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And that was the summertime.",
        "A: Summer \u2014",
        "Q: So the \u2014 so there was no \u2014 like a fence around this settlement. You were allowed\nto go into \u2014",
        "A: We were allowed, but there were hundreds and hundreds of kilometers of\nnothing but virgin forest. And we were not in touch with any \u2014 eight kilometer from\nour camp was the \u2014 what Russians call was baza, which is like a center, gog \u2014\ngovernment\u2019s center, where they control all the activities in the neighborhood, for \u2014\nwhere were \u2014 they just decided where the logging would be. It was all run by \u2014 by\nRussians, of course. And about 20 some kilometers farther, there were a couple of\nRussian villages, which at time, we were given permission \u2014 we were given the\npass, that we could go to those villages and trade, barter for some of the clothes that\nwe brought with us from Poland for some food.",
        "Q: And did you?",
        "A: Oh yes, I would go with my mother and carry a sack, maybe oh, 20 \u2014 20 some\npounds of flour, or some \u2014 some wa \u2014 whatever else we could. That helped, of\ncourse, sur \u2014 to survive.",
        "Q: But other than that, you didn\u2019t have any contact with any local people.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: The \u2014 the only other person that I remember, there was a young woman. She was\nabout 18 years old. She was a mail girl, she used to bring our mail from the baza to\nour camp, and she would carry that, pass it on to every barrack. And she was a\u2014a\nthink when we got there, she was a hundred percent communist. She would t \u2014\nalways tell how much she hated us, and for all different reasons that she would give.\nBut be \u2014 by the time we were leaving camp, she was our best friend. She would\ncome and pray with us, as a matter of fact.",
        "Q: How did that happen?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how it happened, but she finally came to conclusion that we were\nthe ones who were suffering, and we were the ones that were penalized for no\nreason at all.",
        "Q: And that was without you telling her so?",
        "A: Well, she became a \u2014 one of the friends.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I \u2014 I \u2014 it was like a miracle. She ta \u2014 changed her feelings completely. Her\nname was Lisa.",
        "Q: Lisa.",
        "A: Lisa.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: And we \u2014 just happened that in our camp was a nun. She was a sister of my\nfather\u2019s friend. And Russians didn\u2019t know she was a nun. If she \u2014 if they did, most\nlikely she would wind up in jail somewhere. But she would have classes, religion\nclasses with us. Boys would stand guard around the barracks, in all corners, and she\nwould talk to children, small children, about religion, about Christ and that. And\nwhy we were watching, making sure that nobody would spot us.",
        "Q: And nobody did?",
        "A: And nobody did. As a matter of fact, she was saved. She wa \u2014 she was \u2014 she\nwent back to Poland, and she even \u2014 she was in charge of monastery later, in one of\nthe Polish towns, and she visited my grandmother when my \u2014 my grandmother went\nback to Poland from India.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness.",
        "A: Yes. We called her sister wi \u2014 not so much sister, as ciocia, which means aunt.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Sh\u2014 God. Last name was Petrowski(ph).",
        "Q: Petrowski(ph).",

        "A: We were \u2014 we were getting some mail from Poland, but whenever people tried\nto tell us something, it was cut out by censorship. We would get the letters with the\nparts of it cut out.",
        "Q: I see.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I see. So the second winter was a lot harder than the first one?",
        "A: Positively, positively, positively. Our clothes were already in shreds, and we\nwere very, very bad shape physically. Wit \u2014 what\u2019s happened, second summer, the\nauthorities told us that we can try to have a gardens.",
        "Q: Oh, you were allowed to have ga \u2014",
        "A: We were allowed to \u2014 to have a gardens. So we \u2014 they divided some of the open\narea in the camp into plots, and it \u2014 we drew lots, and it just happened that we \u2014 our\npart \u2014 our lot was very far in the \u2014 practically in the woods. What turned out that\nnobody drew a lot which was right in front of our barrack. So my mother went to\nthe \u2014 the ca \u2014 ca \u2014 our commander, and ask him if she could cha \u2014 trade the \u2014 the \u2014\nand she did. So we had a \u2014 about, I would say 50 by 50 feet plot of land that we\ncould \u2014 we could \u2014",
        "Q: Plant.",
        "A: \u2014 plant. It just happened, this is a story in itself. Second summer, my mother and\nI, we went to the village, which is located about 28 kilometers, to trade, I think it\nwas my father\u2019s jacket or something, for some 60 or 80 pounds of potatoes. The\nproblem was that we\u2019d had no means of bringing those potatoes to the camp. So we\ntold the Russians people to keep it for us, and we will come back for it in the winter.\nJanuary 25, 2015\nIt just again happened that my mother was sick. She lifted something heavy while\nshe was working in the woods, and hurt her back, she couldn\u2019t get up. She was in\nbed. And th \u2014 we were really starving. We had a family get together, and decided\nthat we have t \u2014 my brother, who was that time just eight years old \u2014 no, I\u2019m sorry,\nhe was practically nine already. No, he was eight years old. And I was practically\n13 \u2014 no, I was 13 years old. So, that were two of us, right in the middle of winter,\nwe have to go and get those potatoes. Twenty-eight kilometers in the winter, 30\nbelow zero.",
        "Q: Oh my gosh.",
        "A: I, previous summer, I work \u2014 I made a sled, I built a s \u2014 myself a sled. We were\ngonna use that sled to bring those potatoes. So, my mother gave me and my brother\nslice of bread. That had to last us two days. And early in the morning we marched\nwith dragging that sled. We went to, a 13 and a eight, practically nine year old boys,\n28 kilometers to bring the 60 or 80 pounds of potatoes.",
        "Q: Potatoes. And you did?",
        "A: We walked all day. When I close my eyes now, I still see when we got out of the\nwoods, there was a small hill, and on top of the hill there were some hats \u2014 hats,\nwith the chimneys, and the smoke coming from the chi \u2014 it looked like picture from\nheaven, after walking all day. I found the hats, with my \u2014 where the potatoes were.\nJanuary 25, 2015\nWe got in hat \u2014 the room was full of people. Turned out there were people that were\ngoing, men mostly, that were going to go to our camp with horses and \u2014 to help\nworking in the woods, in the logging. I still remember the smell of the sweat,\nbodies, and the cigars, or smo \u2014 I mean, s \u2014 pipes and smoking. We slept all on the\ngrou \u2014 on the floor. Woke up in next morning about five, six o\u2019clock in the\nmorning. I went outside. Turned out during the night, about 12 inches of snow fell.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness. You were saved. You were saved, cause it could have fallen on\nyou.",
        "A: But this was \u2014 going through the virgin forest was just a, you know, path cut out\nthrough the \u2014 through the woods. I had the idea. I started going to every man,\nasking if they will allow us to tie our sled to their horse \u2014 horse drawn sled, you\nknow, to help us.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: None of them would allow it.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Finally, there was a woman with a young girl, most likely my age. And I ask her.\nFirst she refuse, and then she change her mind. She says, all right, you can do it on\none condition, that you lead my horse. Of course, I agreed to it. So we put our bag\nof potatoes on the sled, covered it with the blanket and some straw. My son \u2014 my\nJanuary 25, 2015\nbrother would sit on it, and the \u2014 the sled was full of about five feet high with hay\nfor the horses that would be fed on the \u2014 1n our camp. And the two women climbed\non the top of that sled hay, and I would lead it. We were about the last ones of the\nwhole caravan of those sleds. E-Everything was fine, until we got to about the\nmiddle of the distance to our camp. There was a steep hill, downwards went the\nroad, and on the bottom there was a stream, which of course was frozen solid now.\nAnd there the pass \u2014 the road turned left. Well, we were coming down th-the sleds\nthat went ahead of us, cleaned the road pretty well, so when we were coming, it was\npretty slick going. I kept holding the horse as much as I could, but the \u2014 gradually\nhorse start to galloping, faster and faster. Finally I couldn\u2019t keep up with him, so I\nlet go. The sled with the \u2014 went all the way down to the hill, and made the turn. As\nit made the turn to the left, it slid sideways, hit the embankment of snow, and the\ntwo women were catapult out of the top of the sled, into the big pile of snow. All I\ncould see is two pair of legs sticking out. Of course, my brother turn over too.",
        "Q: What happened to the potatoes?",
        "A: Well, they were \u2014 they were turned over too, into the snow. It took us about half\nan hour to straighten out the sled, and put back the potatoes on \u2014 on the sled\n[indecipherable] with my little sled, my brother on it. By the end of the day, we\nwere at our camp.\n100January 25, 2015",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: Next day I was walking, and I seen that woman splitting logs for her fireplace.\nShe wasn\u2019t much good at it, but I was. For next hour or so I split all the wood that\nshe had. That was my thank you to her for being so good and help us, because I\ndon\u2019t know how we would have made it back that night, to the camp. So she was\ngood to me, and I repaid it by \u2014",
        "Q: Splitting her logs.",
        "A: \u2014 splitting her woods for her.",
        "Q: Amazing.",
        "A: Amazing.",

        "A: And when I think about it now, my brother wasn\u2019t even nine years old.",
        "Q: And the potatoes, did they help?",
        "A: Oh, God. Wa \u2014 there were \u2014 there were \u2014 that \u2014 I don\u2019t remember how long ago\nwe went to sleep with our bellies full. The potatoes tasted better than any before and\nany time after, when they did. And for next month or so, and when \u2014 when we got\nthe plot of land, when my mother would peel the potatoes, her \u2014 she \u2014 when there\nwas a eye, with the possibility of growing, she would make a big, deep cut and save\n101January 25, 2015\nit. So we planted those pieces, and next year we had a \u2014 some \u2014 our own fresh\npotatoes growing.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: That was part of the good story.",
        "Q: It is. It is, but what a difficult \u2014 what a difficult thing to do. And for little boys, I\nmean, as you were starting to tell this, I was thinking, my goodness, those potatoes\nwill freeze on that \u2014 on that journey.",
        "A: Well, it was like I said, we covered with \u2014 with the straw, with the blanket, and\nmy brother was sitting on \u2014",
        "Q: Sitting on top of it, like a chicken on some eggs.",
        "A: Exactly, yes.",
        "Q: So, by this time, let\u2019s say, the second winter goes by, and that\u2019s the winter of\n1941, and then the summer is when you plant, or \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did your lives change after that?",
        "A: Well, the irony of it, that we, that year we got what Russians call the amnesty.\nTo have \u2014 to have amnesty, you have to commit something, right?",

        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know what we committed.",
        "Q: But you got amnesty anyway.",
        "A: But we got amnesty anyway. And who do we thank for that?",
        "Q: Who?",
        "A: Hitler. So, is it the irony that we have Hitler to thank for our freedom. Now, the\nway it worked, Russians at that time, when Germany attacked Russia, were in such\na bad shape, within a few months, Germany was right into the Russian territory.\nThey went through the eastern Poland, into German authority. Russians were\nlooking for help, for allies. At that time, Russia held about a quarter of a million\nPolish soldiers in it \u2014 prison of war camps. Russians wanted to use those men to\ndefend Russia. They tr \u2014 to \u2014 got in touch with Polish government in exile in ri \u2014 in\nLondon, to form Polish army in Russia. They agreed \u2014 Polish government agreed\non one condition. That they will release rest of the people, too. That included us. So\nthat\u2019s what the amnesty was about. And we were officially told by \u2014 by officials.\n103January 25, 2015",

We were told that there\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s\nwhere the Polish army is being organized. But how do we get there? This 1s 3,000\nkilometers from where we are. Now, it was due south wi \u2014 by this time the German\narmies were already approaching Moscow, so there was no way we could go\nstraight south. A lot of people were hesitating, didn\u2019t want to leave the camp\nbecause after all, there was some security here, and if we leave camp, who \u2014 then\nwhat? My mother was a different \u2014 of different opinion. She says she won\u2019t stay\nhere any more, we have to leave. And sure enough, we \u2014 my sister went to a \u2014 the\nvillage, which was about 20 some mi \u2014 kilometers to, from \u2014 from our camp, and\nnext thing we know, she came back couple days later with the horse-drawn sled,\nwith the farmer, and that we can leave the camp \u2014",

Again, my mother\nbribed some of the people over there with some tobacco. And they told us that we\ncan load in, into the \u2014 get into one of the freight cars that was bringing supplies,\nrailroad supplies, and we traveled about three days. They closed the doors\ncompletely because they didn\u2019t want anybody know what we \u2014 we were in the car.\nIt was freezing. We had to walk most of the time to \u2014 to \u2014 not to freeze.",

What would happen,\nwe would get to the station, and people, some people from each car would run to the\ncenter of the town to see if they could buy, steal or whatever some food. And\nsometime when they were there, the train would go \u2014 would start going, and leave\nthem behind. And like I said, most of the time, when train would leave those\npeople, we never seen them again.",
        "Q: So what happened with your mother?\n107January 25, 2015",
        "A: My mother was one of the people that went to get some food. In the meantime,\nthey took our train and just moved it to different siding. When my mother came\nback to the original spot, who \u2014 the \u2014 whoever was in charge told her that our train\nleft. She jumped on the next train and traveled for about three days, without sign of\nour train. So she decided that she must have missed it, and she started coming back.\nAnd would you know, she found us. Not only did she found us, but she brought\nabout two loaves of bread with her.",
        "Q: What a miracle.",
        "A: Was a miracle. We were desperate. We were four children, and their grandma.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: Four children and their grandma.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: My dear, we were creatures from hell. Dirty. All through those three months, we\nnever change clothes, we never washed. There was enough water for drinking,\nnever mind washing or \u2014 or \u2014 our clothes or washing yourself. Can you imagine the\nstink? Forty people in the car. We were in one of the towns, I don\u2019t remember the\nname now, big town. And all of a sudden, all through the train went the news that\non a different siding, there\u2019s a train just like ours, and in that train, there\u2019s a priest\nthat\u2019s gonna say a mass. Believe me, everybody, whoever could stand on their feet,\n108January 25, 2015\nwe run to that siding, and sure enough, there was in one of the cars, the gate \u2014 door\nwas open, there was a table, and a young priest was saying a mass. He was in a\nshreds of clothes just like we were. Dirty, filthy, but you could tell he was a God\u2019s\nman. We were kneeling on the snow, we were praying. We were singing Polish\nsongs. At the end of 1t we usually sing a song which says, God, let us \u2014 give us \u2014\ngive us a chance to get to freedom, get to pola \u2014 get back to Poland, to our cri \u2014 our\ncountry.",
        "Q: I can\u2019t imagine what that scene must have been like.",
        "A: It gaved us spirit. It gave us a reason to live again. Believe me, it was one of the\nmiracles that makes human do things that sometime you don\u2019t think you can do it.\nWell, our luck was with us anyway. We got through Kazakhstan \u2014 just one \u2014 I\nwrote it in my life story. When we were going through Kazakhstan, the \u2014 the\nscenery was totally flat steppe.",
        "Q: The steppes.",

Was running\nparallel to a train, but at least he knew \u2014 you could tell he knew exactly where he\nwas going, and we didn\u2019t have the slightest idea where we were going.",
        "Q: Oh my. Yeah.\n109January 25, 2015",

        "A: Kolkhoz is a government farm.",
        "Q: Okay.",

This is main there, that\u2019s what they grow in that part\nof Uzbekistan. Well, they assign us to the Uzbek family. They gave us a little room\nwith a dirt floor, and my mother and my young \u2014 my older sister worked in the\nfields, and I worked 1n the smith shop.",
        "Q: Was this Polish authorities, or Russian authorities?",
        "A: Russian authorities. But turned out that there were already some Polish\nauthorities in the area, too. Finally we contacted them. And they kept us \u2014 kept\ntelling us to sit tight, they\u2019Il notify us where and when we have to go. We spend, I\ndon\u2019t know, about four months up there, and working pretty hard. Finally, my\n110January 25, 2015\nmother again, she has enough. With the last thing that she still had \u2014 there were two\nmore Polish families in the area.

Sure enough, we unloaded at night, and we\nwere sit \u2014 by this time it was nice and warm up there. This is south of Russia.

        "Q: Did people know about the famine that was in the Ukraine?",
        "Q: This \u2014 yeah. One of the reasons I ask this is that \u2014 is just it\u2019s, in today\u2019s world,\nwhen we\u2019re talking in 2015, it sounds almost inconceivable, that with our means of\ninformation and communication, that we wouldn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on ina\ncountry that\u2019s next to our own, because you find out so quickly.",
        "Q: Yeah. Were there different political parties in Nowogrodek?",

        "Q: What happened after that?",
        "Q: So, did you continue going to school?",
        "Q: That must have been a relief.",

        "Q: Well, when they came into the house, did they give a reason?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: You say there was a local Jewish person who \u2014",

        "Q: Was this the same house, or had you moved?",
        "Q: Oh my. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about the months in between. Did you ever go to the\nprison where your father was, to bring food?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Had you ever been to this place?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t know what it looked like?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Was it \u2014 was it a city jail, or something?",
        "Q: And how long was it that your father was held there, you think?",
        "Q: Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s talk about this a little bit more. You say you never found out what\nhappened to your father. That is, in \u2014 where \u2014 what his destiny was, where he was\ntaken, or anything. Is that \u2014 that so?",
        "Q: So this \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. And did you ever go back to Nowogrodek after the war?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. What years did they go, or what year did they go there?",
        "Q: So would be like 2005?",
        "Q: Yeah, so would have been, oh man, 65 years after \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 afterwards.",
        "Q: And in 2005 if they were there, then it was Belarus.",
        "Q: And was it feasible, or was it already, you know, no ho \u2014 no hope that there\nmight be some information in the municipal records about your father?",
        "Q: They looked? Or they tried?",
        "Q: About \u2014 did \u2014 was there ever any story about, or any research done on any of the\nprisoners, or of the \u2014 the fact that they were held in this city jail for \u2014 you know, the",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Won\u2019t \u2014 so that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 yeah, I understand. I understand. Before we go to\nthat night where you thought you were being taken to your second home in \u2014 or\nanother house, and it turned out not to be the case, tell me a little bit about those\nmonths in between, about October, November, December. How did life progress?\nWhat was going on with your mother, your \u2014 your businesses?",
        "Q: Well, well, the business they took over right away. Within a week they took over\nthe business, and my mother worked for them. She had to work for them, and so it\nwasn\u2019t our business any more. As far as the life, right away there were shortages of\njust about everything. Even the \u2014 such a thing as salt, y-you had to queue \u2014 line up",
        "Q: How do you explain that?",
        "Q: And of course, supply lines were \u2014 were cut.",
        "Q: Did this extend to school, as well?",
        "Q: So, what \u2014 what happened to that gentleman, you said his name was Alex, or\nAlexi, who was working with you \u2014 working for your father?",
        "Q: Okay. Now Id like to \u2014 I\u2019d like to broach a subject that is a \u2014 a painful one, and\na very sensitive one, but you \u2014 you mentioned that it was a local Jewish communist\nwho came in when \u2014 when they arrested your father, and took him away. How \u2014\nhow did people \u2014 did people say, uh-huh, the Jews have betrayed us? Was that a\nsentiment?",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "Q: Were there any people who, let\u2019s say were Jewish and well-to-do, who were also\narrested?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Or deported, for example?",
        "Q: Before the war, how were relations \u2014 I mean, many Jewish people say that Poles\nare very anti-Semitic, or that anti-Semitism was rampant in Poland.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Were there any Jewish kids in your classes at school?",
        "Q: Okay, okay. I know that this is a very \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 touchy \u2014 touchy sensi \u2014 it\u2019s very sensitive subject, but in \u2014 particularly in the\nareas of the kressi(ph), where there were so many different occupations and\noccupations by \u2014 by different forces, armies and \u2014 and so on. It was one of the\nreasons why I was asking you too, wha-what was the make-up of the towns, and the\npeople, and so on.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, we\u2019ll break for lunch right now.",
        "Q: And come back and talk later \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 for \u2014 and take the story forward when \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 after you\u2019re arrested. Thank you.",
        "Q: Okay, so Mr. Szymel, we s \u2014 what we see here is a photograph. Tell me who is\nin the photograph?",
        "Q: So that means it was taken in 1928.",
        "Q: Oh, 1929.",
        "Q: And how is it that you came to have this photograph?",
        "Q: Is it the only photo you have of your father?",
        "Q: You have some others.",
        "Q: Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much, we can put it to the side now. Okay,\nbefore the break, we kind of stopped at the point where in February 10\", 1940,\nsoldiers came to your home again and in the middle of the night, knocked on the\ndoor and told you you are going to have to leave. Can you remember how long you\nhad to put your things together?",
        "Q: What did you manage to take with you?",
        "Q: Okay. I-In that government building, you said there were families like your own.\nDid you recognize any of them?",
        "Q: Then what happened?",
        "Q: And that was it.",
        "Q: Were there \u2014 was there anybody who didn\u2019t have \u2014 who didn\u2019t fit on those two\nplatforms, who was in the middle of the car?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: With grates, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did anybody at any point official, tell you why you had been arrested, or where\nyou were going?",
        "Q: And the orders were, I take it, in Russian, yes?",
        "Q: Could \u2014 could you understand what they were saying?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. Did that little \u2014 what place did you have? Di\u2014 were you in a bottom\nplatform, or a top platform?",
        "Q: And were you able to see out a window, or \u2014",
        "Q: And was the win \u2014 did the window have glass, or not?",
        "Q: It did.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: So that stove didn\u2019t do much good.",
        "Q: Did you have any food with you?",
        "Q: Were you fed on the train?",
        "Q: Oh my. And \u2014 and then, when did the train start moving?",
        "Q: How did you know when you got to the border that you were crossing 1t?",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did you have a sense of what your final destination would be?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did people get sick on the train journey?",
        "Q: Did you know the other people who were 1n your wagon?",
        "Q: Okay, so in this wagon you weren\u2019t \u2014 you weren\u2019t with strangers, you were \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. What kind \u2014 was there any conversation going on?",
        "Q: Were there any men on the \u2014 on the \u2014 in your wagon?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So that does present a very sad picture.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did \u2014 so, but did everybody make it, that is, to the final destination?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Did you see anything of the city?",
        "Q: Through the \u2014 through the wi \u2014 little window? No?",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "Q: And how could you tell?",
        "Q: Oh wow. So, it took a long time actually.",
        "Q: How wa \u2014 how was your mother holding out in all of this?",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did \u2014 did she cry during the trip?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So \u2014 and your brothers and \u2014 and your brother and sisters?",
        "Q: All four of you were deported, yes?",
        "Q: So your family was a little bit older, in the sense that there were no infants.",
        "Q: Yeah. And were you amongst those who had to walk beside the \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 the sleigh?",
        "Q: And, were you thinking of what your father had said before?",
        "Q: Because at that time it sounds like your mother was taking the burdens on her\nshoulders.",
        "Q: When you \u2014 when did you \u2014 where did you end up being your \u2014 what ended up\nbeing your final destination?",
        "Q: What was the name of this place?",
        "Q: Of rust?",
        "Q: That sounds very pretty, actually.",
        "Q: So your \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 settlement that you go to is Rzhavka(ph), yeah?\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "Q: And they \u2014 it\u2019s made of \u2014 it\u2019s comprised of five log cabins?",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a rather small place \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, big buildings, okay.",
        "Q: So it was like a barracks?",
        "Q: So di \u2014 were \u2014 was everybody responsible for their own food, their own cooking\nat this place?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, in other words, you weren\u2019t given food.",
        "Q: And in the beginning, how did you buy it, if you had no money\u2019?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Okay, let me go back for that, I didn\u2019t think of this before. Your family had been\nwell-to-do, and when the Soviets took over, then they nationalized and took away\nyour businesses. But wer \u2014 were you given any compensation?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: And so that\u2019s where she had the rubles from.",
        "Q: And she took that one you left.",
        "Q: That\u2019s an interesting point. I wanted to \u2014 to get a sense of when you had \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 when you took clothes and no food, then you were in a \u2014 in \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So when you first got there, she had a way of being able to buy food for\nyou.",
        "Q: It would freeze, huh?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Your grandmother too.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was your sister put to work?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: I want to go back to one point, just to make it clear, and it\u2019s about the food. That\nis, you were able to buy food for yourselves if you had the money, but not as much\nas you wanted to.",
        "Q: So in other words, it was rationed, but it wasn\u2019t handed out.",
        "Q: It was rationed in the sense that you could only get a certain portion.",
        "Q: And you had to pay for it.",
        "Q: Okay. And that was with all food?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So what did you have, what did you eat?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Thank you for that. Thank you for sharing that. Oh, do you remember what it\nwas that was in that package?",
        "Q: There\u2019s a lot you can do with pork belly.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Yeah. So, did anyone get sick here?",
        "Q: In \u2014 how large was the camp, population-wise.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s a lot.",
        "Q: That\u2019s an important position.",
        "Q: And \u2014 how \u2014 what was their manner towards you, how did they behave towards\nyou?",
        "Q: So how did it \u2014 did children just stay silent when this sort of \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: What kind of interaction was there with the KGB men? Like what \u2014 what was\nhis \u2014 what was his function? How did he \u2014 how did he \u2014 what was his role in your\nlife? Did he come and just talk to people, or did he \u2014",
        "Q: So how did he ensure that?",
        "Q: Was there informing going on?",
        "Q: Okay. So it wasn\u2019t the same sort of situation as even back home, where people\nstarted being afraid of what they would say in \u2014 in public.",
        "Q: And, where did these officials live? How did they live?",
        "Q: And you said the commandant was not such a bad guy.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. And so it was mostly what he didn\u2019t do, rather than what he did.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So, you \u2014 it took half a year for you to be in school after you arrived, so\nwhat did you do in that half year?",
        "Q: And your mother would work in this sort of situation?",
        "Q: Here\u2019s a part I don\u2019t understand. I understand that she goes to a spring to get\nwater in the summertime, to haul it back up, but in the winter there\u2019s all this snow\noutside.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a long time.",
        "Q: Would it be hot in summer?",
        "Q: Had you done that at home?",
        "Q: For pleasure.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And that was the summertime.",
        "Q: So the \u2014 so there was no \u2014 like a fence around this settlement. You were allowed\nto go into \u2014",
        "Q: And did you?",
        "Q: But other than that, you didn\u2019t have any contact with any local people.",
        "Q: How did that happen?",
        "Q: And that was without you telling her so?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Lisa.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And nobody did?",
        "Q: Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "Q: Petrowski(ph).",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay. So summertime was a reprieve from the cold.",
        "Q: Between you.",
        "Q: What was that?",
        "Q: Teasing.",
        "Q: On your seat.",
        "Q: Oh man, I just had another question about this, and \u2014 let me think. Clothes \u2014\nhygiene.",
        "Q: Did it?",
        "Q: Oh my. Oh my.",
        "Q: Not to be able to do something as simple as have some soap, and wash.",
        "Q: And \u2014 but 1\u2014 was this called a banya(ph)? These \u2014 these \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm, so it\u2019s something like a sauna.",
        "Q: Well, yeah.",
        "Q: No lice, no equipment.",
        "Q: I talked about \u2014 so we talked about hyg \u2014 what about, in the forest, were there\never any little animals?",
        "Q: That evening, yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s like about 18 inches, 20 inch long catfish.",
        "Q: Yeah, even two feet.",
        "Q: And how \u2014 without a fishing rod?",
        "Q: Into the sack, okay.",
        "Q: Were there ever official meetings that were held for the entire settlement, that\nyou had to go to, or anything?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So he would come in and hold a meeting for the whole barracks?",
        "Q: And what would he usually talk about?",
        "Q: Was there a radio in the camp?",
        "Q: Were there newspapers that were ever delivered?",
        "Q: Oh really.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: How often would there be visits to the settlement from the outside? Like the post\ngirl, would she come once a week, or \u2014",
        "Q: Couple of ti\u2014 was this about the only communication that there would be with\nsomebody\u201d?",
        "Q: So it \u2014 it really gets \u2014 it sounds like you were very remote, and quite isolated.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Isn\u2019t that interesting, that an older generation saw through that, wasn\u2019t convinced\nof it.",
        "Q: This would be when you would be going to trade, or something like that?",
        "Q: Would you like some water?",
        "Q: Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s cut then, yeah. [break]. Okay, so tell me, is there anything else that\nI haven\u2019t asked about, about life in the settlement, life in the camp, that you think is\nimportant for people to know about?",
        "Q: They retreat in themselves.",
        "Q: So people changed?",
        "Q: So were there people who were deported without their families, for example.",
        "Q: And th \u2014 so if you were alone, you had far less chance.",
        "Q: So you went through the winter of 1940, the summer of 1940 and the winter of\n1941. And, was that second winter pretty similar to the first?",
        "Q: Okay, ec \u2014 describe it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you were weaker with \u2014",
        "Q: So did they commit suicide?",
        "Q: They just died.",
        "Q: Were there any other transports that came after you?",
        "Q: Okay, you would have been the only ones.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: I see. So the second winter was a lot harder than the first one?",
        "Q: Oh, you were allowed to have ga \u2014",
        "Q: Plant.",
        "Q: Oh my gosh.",
        "Q: Potatoes. And you did?",
        "Q: Oh my goodness. You were saved. You were saved, cause it could have fallen on\nyou.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: What happened to the potatoes?",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "Q: Splitting her logs.",
        "Q: Amazing.",
        "Q: Amazing.",
        "Q: And the potatoes, did they help?",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "Q: It is. It is, but what a difficult \u2014 what a difficult thing to do. And for little boys, I\nmean, as you were starting to tell this, I was thinking, my goodness, those potatoes\nwill freeze on that \u2014 on that journey.",
        "Q: Sitting on top of it, like a chicken on some eggs.",
        "Q: So, by this time, let\u2019s say, the second winter goes by, and that\u2019s the winter of\n1941, and then the summer is when you plant, or \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 yes, you plant those \u2014",
        "Q: Now, in June 1941 is when Germany attacked the Soviet Union.",
        "Q: Did your lives change after that?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: But you got amnesty anyway.",
        "Q: Who?",
        "Q: By the commandant, or \u2014",
        "Q: Not the KGB man.",
        "Q: Legitimization.",
        "Q: And when did this \u2014 when did this come? When did this happen?",
        "Q: So, it was several months after Germany attacked.",
        "Q: So in the fall of \u00b041, when you finally have some potatoes of your own.",
        "Q: Your ha \u2014 you\u2019re told that you are free to go.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: With him?",

If\nyou eliminate leaders of the community, it\u2019s going to be that much easier to run the\ncommunity. Well, that was my father\u2019s problem. He was active of the \u2014 in his\ncommunity life, so they had to get rid of him.\nJanuary 25, 2015",

        "A: There \u2014 not legal.",

        "A: Oh God, it was terrible. On top of it, within a couple weeks of arresting my\nfather, Russians authorities came, lived on the edge of the town \u2014 and like I said, we\nhad a big house, we had a big barn, they wanted our property, because they wanted\nto \u2014 for Russian people to take to live in there. My mother insisted that we will\nmove if they give us a house to move in. And that\u2019s why we did \u2014 we were not very\nsurprised when on the 10\" of February, 1940, again a Russian officer with a \u2014 some\nsoldiers, at night \u2014 they always done all those arresting and deporting at night. They\n\u2014 it was the middle of the winter, cold, about a foot or so of snow.

And, as a matter of fact,\nsupposedly my father asked her, cause when he spotted her, where are we? What\nJanuary 25, 2015\nhappened to his family. And of course she said that she told him that we were\nalready deported to Russia. And that\u2019s what happened. After the war she told us.\nThat\u2019s when she told us.",

        "A: Well, si\u2014 you see, the Russians, probably some of the lists of people that they\nwere arrested, and some of the people that they murdered, it j \u2014 it just happens that\nBelarussians do also have lists of people that they arrested. They were arrested in\nthat territory.",
        "A: And th-they were \u2014 for some stupid reason, they will not release that list. So\nthere is possibility that my father could be on that list, but th-th \u2014 the \u2014 the existing\ngovernment of Belarus will not \u2014 not release that list.\nJanuary 25, 2015\nfor hours sometime to get some salt.

        "A: Well, Russians were exporting \u2014 taking everything into Russia. There were\ntrains being loaded and taken into the deep Russia.",
        "A: Acor \u2014 of course. So \u2014 and of course the \u2014 the life was miserable. Everybody \u2014\nthe fear \u2014 this 1s the way they run the country, fear.

Because all you had to do was say something\nabout that you were not pleased what was happening, you can wind up in jail right\naway.",
        "A: Well, of course, the teachers were our old teachers, but at least once a week we\nwould have to have special classes, where they would try to convince us of what a\nwonderful country, what a free country Russia is, how \u2014 how advanced, how \u2014 of\ncourse, we knew better, even though we were children.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 he left us. As soon as Russians came in, he left. He ma \u2014 he was there\nmaybe a couple days and he left. I don\u2019t know what \u2014 what happened.

        "A: Well, a lot of it 1s true, a lot of it is true. But, at the same time, if you know the\nreal life in all the European countries, Poland was pretty free [indecipherable] as\nfar as the religion is concerned.",
        "A: So, whoever \u2014 whatever religion you were, you were free to practice it. Before,\nin the first \u2014 30s, where Nazis took over Germany, they deported a lot of Jews to\nPoland, or a lot of Jews came into Poland for escape from Germany to Poland,\nand they were doing pretty good. But you have to realize that most of the industry,\nmost of the business in Poland was in Jews\u2019 hands. Jew \u2014 Jews had a saying that\nwas very popular, you have the streets, but we have the buildings on them. Which\nJanuary 25, 2015\nmeant that they \u2014 they were in control of quite a bit of industry, quite a bit of \u2014 bit\nof business. Now, there \u2014 they were known for being bankers, for \u2014 for doing lot of\ntrading and that. And sorry to say, but our average people don\u2019t like rich, rich\npeople. And they were \u2014 they represented the rich people. So lot of common people\nwere, of course, hateful of them. Wa \u2014 but we didn\u2019t have any \u2014 with Russians were\ndoing those pogroms and that, we de \u2014 we didn\u2019t have anything like that. But fact\nwas, we didn\u2019t like them, yes.",
        "A: Of course, of course. But there were some good Jews, and I have an example. I\nwas going to tell you that later. I will tell you later.",

And up there we were told to get\nout of the train, and they put us on a slow horse-drawn sleds. And again, the grown-\nups and older children had to walk. Only the smaller and old were riding 1-1n the\nsled. And for three days we traveled to our final destination, staying at night,\nstaying at the local schools.

        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t know, but my mother would get paid \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for her work.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: Well, we also had \u2014 it turned out my mother has quite a bit of money. We,\namong other things we had a beautiful horse. And the young man that worked for\nus, and he still lived with us when Russians came in, told my mother that he heard,\namong men, that they were goin \u2014 the Russians were going to take our horse away.\nBut he suggested that he \u2014 he even had the person that was willing to buy our horse,\nsomebody connected to the Russians, that he would buy our horse. And my mother\nsold that horse, and she got quite a bit of money for it.",
        "A: And sh \u2014 and it turned out, that was the money that saved us in Russia.",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, I \u2014 I\u2014 w-we never seen the money, my mother never showed it to us. But\nI know that for a fact, that she sold the horse, and I didn\u2019t know how much she got.\nOf course, I got to know it later, when we were outside Russia.",
        "A: Well, it was \u2014 you know, whatever was assigned to us. And of course, she got \u2014\nshe was one of the first that she got a job. Her job was to bring water from the river,\nJanuary 25, 2015\nthat was farther on, not wer \u2014 next to our camp, there was a area about a couple\nkilometers from there, where there was a spring. And she would bring clear water.\nSh \u2014 what she would have to do 1s fill the wooden barrels, which were on this wood\n\u2014 on this horse-drawn sled. She would have to go to the \u2014 chop the ice, fill ti \u2014 with\nthe bucket, walk up and fill up the barrels, and then take it to the bakery, take the\nwater there. Again, dip the water out of the barrels and take it to the barrels inside\nthe bakery. She would do that all day long. It wou \u2014 believe me, I helped her\nsometime, it was a back blake \u2014 breaking job. And especially, she used to wear a\nsack in front of her as a apron. From splashing water and freezing, she sounded like\nshe was a\u2014 she was armor, th-the \u2014 the ice so \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 freeze, it would freeze. She \u2014 but she never gave up, she worked, because she\nhad six mouths to feed.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s right. Well, all of us, were si-six of us.",
        "A: So, she worked very hard.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: When my sister turned 16, I believe \u2014 anybody over the age of 16 had to work.\nAnd lucky for \u2014 for her, she got a job in the local nursery, so she took care of little\nchildren. At least she didn\u2019t have to work in \u2014 because the \u2014 all the other \u2014 and the\nother industry was logging.",
        "A: And eventually my mother worked there too. What the de \u2014 women would do,\nwhen the men felled the trees, the women would chop the branches, and clear the\nsnow so the \u2014 the horse-drawn drivers would haul the logs up to main drag, and\nthen big, huge sleds, pulled by the tractors, would dr-draw \u2014 would draw those logs\nto the river, which again in the spring would be floated to the destination whate \u2014\nwhatever it was.",
        "A: Only one bre \u2014 specially the bread, that was assigned to you.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",

        "A: The \u2014 the only thing is, all the time we were there, we never had any \u2014 even the\nsmallest amount of sugar. The \u2014 n-no butter, no meat. I nev \u2014",
        "A: Bread.",
        "A: Moi-\u2014 mainly bread. Sometime later, in \u2014 when we were already a couple years\nin Russia, in there \u2014 well, maybe a year, they allowed f\u2014 us to receive parcels from\nPoland. And sometime \u2014 my grandmother, sometime some friends \u2014 as a matter of\nfact, we received a package of food from one of the Jews of Nowogrodek that owed\nmy father some money. And he \u2014 he looked into it and found our address where we\nwere at, and send us lifesaving food that we\u2019re \u2014 I\u2019m still grateful for it. So, like I\nsaid before, there were Jews, and there were Jews.",
        "A: Just like there are Poles and there are Poles.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: I think it \u2014 most of it was pork belly, which is, to us, was \u2014 God, 1t was \u2014",
        "A: Exactly. Especially when you\u2019re starving, a little bit of fat \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 1s \u2014 it\u2019s a treasure.",
        "A: Lot of people. Within a, I would say six months of being in that camp, we started\nlosing some infants, some babies. There was no \u2014 women didn\u2019t have enough milk\nto feed the babies, there was no milk to be had. The babies were starving, they were\ndying. Pretty soon, about a kilometer behind our camp, on a little hill, started appear\nwood crosses. And after children, little children, the older people started dying.\nWithin a year, we must have lost oh, at least 50 people, older people. Our camp\nconsisted of people from two different parts of Poland. Half of us were from\nNowogrodek, and half were from the southern part of where \u2014 what was \u2014 what is\nnow Ukraine, close to the Lwow. So there were people from two \u2014 two different\nparts of Poland.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: It was about, I would say, close to 500 people.",
        "A: Quite a few. There were, as far as Russians, there was one man, commander \u2014\ncommandant, we called him commandant. And there was one KGB man, and one\nbakers with his family. And there was one Russian 1-1n th \u2014 a woman, which wer \u2014\nshe was in charge of the restaurant.",
        "A: Very important. The rest of it was Polish people.",
        "A: Well, of course, the \u2014 the commandant wasn\u2019t bad man, but the \u2014 but the KGB,\nhe was typical communist. To him, the only thing that mattered was his party, his\nnation, and he tried to convince us that we should be grateful that we wound up in\nRussia. Within about six months, they opened a school, wi-with one teacher,\nRussian, of course. And everybody, all the children, until 16 years, they had to go to\nschool. And of course, we didn\u2019t mind subjects like math and arc \u2014 physics,\nchemistry, or whatever. But of course they also tried to convince us again of the\nadvantages of communist system, which didn\u2019t work with us at all.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we learn how to go along with them.",
        "A: Just to get a ga \u2014 got along them. They \u2014 I \u2014 I was already twel \u2014 like I said, I\nwas 12 years old, and what happened to me once, sometime we would sit on the\nbench, couple of our boys, and we sing our Polish national songs. And they through\n\u2014 we were trying to get our teacher mad. And one day he called me in and he told\nme if I keep it up, nothing may happen to me, but my mother wi \u2014 may wind up in \u2014\nin jail. So of course, we stopped doing that, too.",
        "A: Well, he wanted \u2014 he wanted to make sure we were afraid of him.",
        "A: Well, his manner, first of all, his manner. He would march into to the room, told\nthe kids, sit down. You know, his voice, his manner, and h-he would really rough\nkind of a talk, let us know that he was in a cha \u2014 in charge, he was the boss.",
        "A: Very \u2014 if there was, it must have been very little, because we were \u2014 pe-people\nwere very, very well in touch with another. If there was, I never heard of any.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: No, in the camp \u2014 in the camp, wa-wa-wa \u2014 it was w-w-wa \u2014 solidarity was a\nmain thing.",
        "A: They had their own quarters. There was special barrack. In this special barrack\nthey \u2014 the baker has his couple rooms in there, next to the bakery, and so the \u2014 the\nwoman that\u2019s in charge of restaurant, and the KGB and \u2014 and the commander was \u2014\nthey had th-their own \u2014 their own building.",
        "A: No, he \u2014 he \u2014 he was authority, but he didn\u2019t over \u2014 didn\u2019t abuse it.",
        "A: He \u2014 maybe he felt sorry for us, of anything.",
        "A: Exactly, exactly.",
        "A: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing. In the winter, there wasn\u2019t\nmuch you could do really, because eventually there were either four or five feet of\nJanuary 25, 2015\nsnow sometime. And in the \u2014 you were sometimes so cold that you couldn\u2019t even\nbreathe in the cold air, because 1t was \u2014 when you \u2014 if you didn\u2019t have anything in\nfront of your mouth, you could feel like knives, okay, cutting into your lungs. So\nyou always had to have something in you \u2014 in front of your face.",
        "A: Yes, she did. Unless it got to be about \u2014 below 40 degrees, then nobody worked.\nBut if it was warmer than that, then everybody had to go work, and men w-worked\nfalling trees, and women doing the rest of it.",
        "A: Well, di \u2014 di \u2014 you had to shovel \u2014 you have to shovel the snow wherever you\ncould. Sometime it was like a tunnel between the \u2014 on the each side there be about\nfive feet of snow, and you just go. And the roads, with the passing of the sleds,\neventually, you know, it was a track that you could go by.",
        "A: And of course, the snow lasted about Ma-May \u2014 May sometime, middle of May,\nbefore the snows would start to melt.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: That\u2019s a long time. By June, it wer \u2014 snow was gone and then summer right\naway would start.",
        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t say hot, but it was nice and warm, and it\u2019s \u2014 the beauty of\nnature up there at that time, everything explodes. Everything grows so fast, I never\nseen anything grow that fast in that humid, warm air. And as a matter of fact, if it\nwasn\u2019t for nature, I don\u2019t know if we would have survived. As soon as it got warm,\nsome \u2014 a different kind of mushrooms would appear in the forest. And children \u2014\nand I was among them, we would spend at least half a day, every other day, picking\nmushrooms. And later on, all kinds of berries: blackberries, raspberry \u2014 wild\nraspberries. And like I said before, if 1t wasn\u2019t for nature, I don\u2019t know if we would\nhave survived. The problem was, we could not preserve any of it for wintertime, so\nwe had to consume it right there. Sometime we would bring a bucketful of\nmushrooms, cook it and eat it for next couple meals. And that was my job, picking\nmushrooms, picking berries.",
        "A: Mushrooms, yes, and berries of course, too. But I do \u2014 I done it for different\nreasons.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: For pleasure. Here, it was to survive.",
        "A: Summer \u2014",
        "A: We were allowed, but there were hundreds and hundreds of kilometers of\nnothing but virgin forest. And we were not in touch with any \u2014 eight kilometer from\nour camp was the \u2014 what Russians call was baza, which is like a center, gog \u2014\ngovernment\u2019s center, where they control all the activities in the neighborhood, for \u2014\nwhere were \u2014 they just decided where the logging would be. It was all run by \u2014 by\nRussians, of course. And about 20 some kilometers farther, there were a couple of\nRussian villages, which at time, we were given permission \u2014 we were given the\npass, that we could go to those villages and trade, barter for some of the clothes that\nwe brought with us from Poland for some food.",
        "A: Oh yes, I would go with my mother and carry a sack, maybe oh, 20 \u2014 20 some\npounds of flour, or some \u2014 some wa \u2014 whatever else we could. That helped, of\ncourse, sur \u2014 to survive.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: The \u2014 the only other person that I remember, there was a young woman. She was\nabout 18 years old. She was a mail girl, she used to bring our mail from the baza to\nour camp, and she would carry that, pass it on to every barrack. And she was a\u2014a\nthink when we got there, she was a hundred percent communist. She would t \u2014\nalways tell how much she hated us, and for all different reasons that she would give.\nBut be \u2014 by the time we were leaving camp, she was our best friend. She would\ncome and pray with us, as a matter of fact.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how it happened, but she finally came to conclusion that we were\nthe ones who were suffering, and we were the ones that were penalized for no\nreason at all.",
        "A: Well, she became a \u2014 one of the friends.",
        "A: And I \u2014 I \u2014 it was like a miracle. She ta \u2014 changed her feelings completely. Her\nname was Lisa.",
        "A: Lisa.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: And we \u2014 just happened that in our camp was a nun. She was a sister of my\nfather\u2019s friend. And Russians didn\u2019t know she was a nun. If she \u2014 if they did, most\nlikely she would wind up in jail somewhere. But she would have classes, religion\nclasses with us. Boys would stand guard around the barracks, in all corners, and she\nwould talk to children, small children, about religion, about Christ and that. And\nwhy we were watching, making sure that nobody would spot us.",
        "A: And nobody did. As a matter of fact, she was saved. She wa \u2014 she was \u2014 she\nwent back to Poland, and she even \u2014 she was in charge of monastery later, in one of\nthe Polish towns, and she visited my grandmother when my \u2014 my grandmother went\nback to Poland from India.",
        "A: Yes. We called her sister wi \u2014 not so much sister, as ciocia, which means aunt.",

        "A: Petrowski(ph), but 1\u2014 I don\u2019t remember her \u2014 her monastery\u2019s name. I don\u2019t\nremember that.\nJanuary 25, 2015",
        "A: Oh God, it was. But you have to realize, our clothes, my first year, were in\nshreds. I \u2014 my older sister and I had one pair of shoes \u2014",

We happened\nto receive a parcel from Poland. I don\u2019t remember who it was from, but whoever\nsent it, wrapped it in a piece of cloth. My grandmother says, Adam, I\u2019m going to\nmake you a pair of pants from it. And she did. She sewed it by hand, can you\nimagine that? And she made me a pair of pants. There was one problem with it.",
        "A: On my seat, there was a permanent marker\u2019s address. I \u2014 I had la \u2014 I had to su-\nsur-survive lot of ho \u2014 laughs \u2014",

The pi \u2014 oh \u2014 only laundry you could do was in the water\nwithout any soap, and lack of clothes breeds all kinds of filth, lice among them. So\nmy mother had a routine.

        "A: No equipment.",
        "A: This was a part of it that still, you know, I still \u2014 when I remember it, comes to\nmy mind. Normally you would expect to have some wolves, bears. There were\nnone. There were totally none. The \u2014 the smallest \u2014 the animals that I seen were\nweasels. And of course, you couldn\u2019t even come close to, they were so fast. The\nonly other thing th \u2014 as a kid, I would try to do some fishing, and sometime with the\nsuccess, which meant that we had a feast.",

        "A: We were allowed to \u2014 to have a gardens. So we \u2014 they divided some of the open\narea in the camp into plots, and it \u2014 we drew lots, and it just happened that we \u2014 our\npart \u2014 our lot was very far in the \u2014 practically in the woods. What turned out that\nnobody drew a lot which was right in front of our barrack. So my mother went to\nthe \u2014 the ca \u2014 ca \u2014 our commander, and ask him if she could cha \u2014 trade the \u2014 the \u2014\nand she did. So we had a \u2014 about, I would say 50 by 50 feet plot of land that we\ncould \u2014 we could \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 plant. It just happened, this is a story in itself. Second summer, my mother and\nI, we went to the village, which is located about 28 kilometers, to trade, I think it\nwas my father\u2019s jacket or something, for some 60 or 80 pounds of potatoes. The\nproblem was that we\u2019d had no means of bringing those potatoes to the camp. So we\ntold the Russians people to keep it for us, and we will come back for it in the winter.\nJanuary 25, 2015\nIt just again happened that my mother was sick. She lifted something heavy while\nshe was working in the woods, and hurt her back, she couldn\u2019t get up. She was in\nbed. And th \u2014 we were really starving. We had a family get together, and decided\nthat we have t \u2014 my brother, who was that time just eight years old \u2014 no, I\u2019m sorry,\nhe was practically nine already. No, he was eight years old. And I was practically\n13 \u2014 no, I was 13 years old. So, that were two of us, right in the middle of winter,\nwe have to go and get those potatoes. Twenty-eight kilometers in the winter, 30\nbelow zero.",
        "A: I, previous summer, I work \u2014 I made a sled, I built a s \u2014 myself a sled. We were\ngonna use that sled to bring those potatoes. So, my mother gave me and my brother\nslice of bread. That had to last us two days. And early in the morning we marched\nwith dragging that sled. We went to, a 13 and a eight, practically nine year old boys,\n28 kilometers to bring the 60 or 80 pounds of potatoes.",
        "A: We walked all day. When I close my eyes now, I still see when we got out of the\nwoods, there was a small hill, and on top of the hill there were some hats \u2014 hats,\nwith the chimneys, and the smoke coming from the chi \u2014 it looked like picture from\nheaven, after walking all day. I found the hats, with my \u2014 where the potatoes were.\nJanuary 25, 2015\nWe got in hat \u2014 the room was full of people. Turned out there were people that were\ngoing, men mostly, that were going to go to our camp with horses and \u2014 to help\nworking in the woods, in the logging. I still remember the smell of the sweat,\nbodies, and the cigars, or smo \u2014 I mean, s \u2014 pipes and smoking. We slept all on the\ngrou \u2014 on the floor. Woke up in next morning about five, six o\u2019clock in the\nmorning. I went outside. Turned out during the night, about 12 inches of snow fell.",
        "A: But this was \u2014 going through the virgin forest was just a, you know, path cut out\nthrough the \u2014 through the woods. I had the idea. I started going to every man,\nasking if they will allow us to tie our sled to their horse \u2014 horse drawn sled, you\nknow, to help us.",
        "A: None of them would allow it.",
        "A: Finally, there was a woman with a young girl, most likely my age. And I ask her.\nFirst she refuse, and then she change her mind. She says, all right, you can do it on\none condition, that you lead my horse. Of course, I agreed to it. So we put our bag\nof potatoes on the sled, covered it with the blanket and some straw. My son \u2014 my\nJanuary 25, 2015\nbrother would sit on it, and the \u2014 the sled was full of about five feet high with hay\nfor the horses that would be fed on the \u2014 1n our camp. And the two women climbed\non the top of that sled hay, and I would lead it. We were about the last ones of the\nwhole caravan of those sleds. E-Everything was fine, until we got to about the\nmiddle of the distance to our camp. There was a steep hill, downwards went the\nroad, and on the bottom there was a stream, which of course was frozen solid now.\nAnd there the pass \u2014 the road turned left. Well, we were coming down th-the sleds\nthat went ahead of us, cleaned the road pretty well, so when we were coming, it was\npretty slick going. I kept holding the horse as much as I could, but the \u2014 gradually\nhorse start to galloping, faster and faster. Finally I couldn\u2019t keep up with him, so I\nlet go. The sled with the \u2014 went all the way down to the hill, and made the turn. As\nit made the turn to the left, it slid sideways, hit the embankment of snow, and the\ntwo women were catapult out of the top of the sled, into the big pile of snow. All I\ncould see is two pair of legs sticking out. Of course, my brother turn over too.",
        "A: Well, they were \u2014 they were turned over too, into the snow. It took us about half\nan hour to straighten out the sled, and put back the potatoes on \u2014 on the sled\n[indecipherable] with my little sled, my brother on it. By the end of the day, we\nwere at our camp.\n100January 25, 2015",
        "A: Next day I was walking, and I seen that woman splitting logs for her fireplace.\nShe wasn\u2019t much good at it, but I was. For next hour or so I split all the wood that\nshe had. That was my thank you to her for being so good and help us, because I\ndon\u2019t know how we would have made it back that night, to the camp. So she was\ngood to me, and I repaid it by \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 splitting her woods for her.",
        "A: Amazing.",
        "A: And when I think about it now, my brother wasn\u2019t even nine years old.",
        "A: Oh, God. Wa \u2014 there were \u2014 there were \u2014 that \u2014 I don\u2019t remember how long ago\nwe went to sleep with our bellies full. The potatoes tasted better than any before and\nany time after, when they did. And for next month or so, and when \u2014 when we got\nthe plot of land, when my mother would peel the potatoes, her \u2014 she \u2014 when there\nwas a eye, with the possibility of growing, she would make a big, deep cut and save\n101January 25, 2015\nit. So we planted those pieces, and next year we had a \u2014 some \u2014 our own fresh\npotatoes growing.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That was part of the good story.",
        "A: Well, it was like I said, we covered with \u2014 with the straw, with the blanket, and\nmy brother was sitting on \u2014",
        "A: Exactly, yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.\n102January 25, 2015",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, the irony of it, that we, that year we got what Russians call the amnesty.\nTo have \u2014 to have amnesty, you have to commit something, right?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know what we committed.",
        "A: But we got amnesty anyway. And who do we thank for that?",
        "A: Hitler. So, is it the irony that we have Hitler to thank for our freedom. Now, the\nway it worked, Russians at that time, when Germany attacked Russia, were in such\na bad shape, within a few months, Germany was right into the Russian territory.\nThey went through the eastern Poland, into German authority. Russians were\nlooking for help, for allies. At that time, Russia held about a quarter of a million\nPolish soldiers in it \u2014 prison of war camps. Russians wanted to use those men to\ndefend Russia. They tr \u2014 to \u2014 got in touch with Polish government in exile in ri \u2014 in\nLondon, to form Polish army in Russia. They agreed \u2014 Polish government agreed\non one condition. That they will release rest of the people, too. That included us. So\nthat\u2019s what the amnesty was about. And we were officially told by \u2014 by officials.\n103January 25, 2015",
        "A: By the commandant.",
        "A: No, no, commandant, that we are free people. We were given passes, legi \u2014 le \u2014\nlegitimacy.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That we could travel in Russia, that we can get supply of bread\nwhenever w \u2014 it was available. But we were \u2014 main thing, we were free to leave the\ncamp.",
        "A: This was fall of \u201941.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s true, that\u2019s very true.",
        "A: We were free to go, but go fra \u2014 where?\n104January 25, 2015",
        "A: We were told that there\u2019s a Polish army being organized in the southern Russia,\nin the \u2014 in the Kazakhstan, in the Uzbekistan. We were told that there\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s\nwhere the Polish army is being organized. But how do we get there? This 1s 3,000\nkilometers from where we are. Now, it was due south wi \u2014 by this time the German\narmies were already approaching Moscow, so there was no way we could go\nstraight south. A lot of people were hesitating, didn\u2019t want to leave the camp\nbecause after all, there was some security here, and if we leave camp, who \u2014 then\nwhat? My mother was a different \u2014 of different opinion. She says she won\u2019t stay\nhere any more, we have to leave. And sure enough, we \u2014 my sister went to a \u2014 the\nvillage, which was about 20 some mi \u2014 kilometers to, from \u2014 from our camp, and\nnext thing we know, she came back couple days later with the horse-drawn sled,\nwith the farmer, and that we can leave the camp \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and he will take us to the \u2014 that village, and from there there was only few\nkilometers to the railroad station \u2014 railroad that was being built. It \u2014 it wasn\u2019t built\nyet, they were just building the railroad. So we packed whatever we still had, things,\nand traveled over for a day and a half, we traveled to that village.",
        "A: We - we left, it was \u2014 was winter of \u201942.\n105January 25, 2015",
        "A: I think it was January \u2014 January something, beginning of January, I think we left\nthe camp. We got to that town, that village, and it turned out it was about 10\nkilometers to the railroad sta \u2014 railroad. Not station, but railroad. Again, my mother\nbribed some of the people over there with some tobacco. And they told us that we\ncan load in, into the \u2014 get into one of the freight cars that was bringing supplies,\nrailroad supplies, and we traveled about three days. They closed the doors\ncompletely because they didn\u2019t want anybody know what we \u2014 we were in the car.\nIt was freezing. We had to walk most of the time to \u2014 to \u2014 not to freeze.",
        "A: To keep warm. Finally we got to the town that we were originally dropped off \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 where we were brought.",
        "A: We got \u2014 turns out there were thousand people just like us out there, from\ndifferent camps all over ye \u2014 Russia, that part of Russia. And within a few days the\nconditions were terrible, unbelievably terrible.\n106January 25, 2015",
        "A: The railroad station. Finally is \u2014 we \u2014 somehow we found out that there was a\ntrain preparing to go south, which had some of those cars prepared for traveling, for\ndeporting [indecipherable] people. So we got on the train.",
        "A: It wa \u2014 well, there were some empty cars, but just about everybody that was on\nthat station, got on that train. Of course Polish people. Three months we traveled on\nthat train.",
        "A: Three months we traveled on that train. We lost more people on that train than in\nthe camp.",
        "A: The worst \u2014 the worst was when somebody got lost from the train, we never \u2014\nwe never found them. It just happened that my mother got lost. What would happen,\nwe would get to the station, and people, some people from each car would run to the\ncenter of the town to see if they could buy, steal or whatever some food. And\nsometime when they were there, the train would go \u2014 would start going, and leave\nthem behind. And like I said, most of the time, when train would leave those\npeople, we never seen them again.\n107January 25, 2015",
        "A: My mother was one of the people that went to get some food. In the meantime,\nthey took our train and just moved it to different siding. When my mother came\nback to the original spot, who \u2014 the \u2014 whoever was in charge told her that our train\nleft. She jumped on the next train and traveled for about three days, without sign of\nour train. So she decided that she must have missed it, and she started coming back.\nAnd would you know, she found us. Not only did she found us, but she brought\nabout two loaves of bread with her.",
        "A: Was a miracle. We were desperate. We were four children, and their grandma.",
        "A: Four children and their grandma.",
        "A: My dear, we were creatures from hell. Dirty. All through those three months, we\nnever change clothes, we never washed. There was enough water for drinking,\nnever mind washing or \u2014 or \u2014 our clothes or washing yourself. Can you imagine the\nstink? Forty people in the car. We were in one of the towns, I don\u2019t remember the\nname now, big town. And all of a sudden, all through the train went the news that\non a different siding, there\u2019s a train just like ours, and in that train, there\u2019s a priest\nthat\u2019s gonna say a mass. Believe me, everybody, whoever could stand on their feet,\n108January 25, 2015\nwe run to that siding, and sure enough, there was in one of the cars, the gate \u2014 door\nwas open, there was a table, and a young priest was saying a mass. He was in a\nshreds of clothes just like we were. Dirty, filthy, but you could tell he was a God\u2019s\nman. We were kneeling on the snow, we were praying. We were singing Polish\nsongs. At the end of 1t we usually sing a song which says, God, let us \u2014 give us \u2014\ngive us a chance to get to freedom, get to pola \u2014 get back to Poland, to our cri \u2014 our\ncountry.",
        "A: It gaved us spirit. It gave us a reason to live again. Believe me, it was one of the\nmiracles that makes human do things that sometime you don\u2019t think you can do it.\nWell, our luck was with us anyway. We got through Kazakhstan \u2014 just one \u2014 I\nwrote it in my life story. When we were going through Kazakhstan, the \u2014 the\nscenery was totally flat steppe.",
        "A: Steppes, yes. And I was looking through that small window, and what do I see?\nRight along the railroad tracks, on the snow, there\u2019s a fox, a red fox. Was running\nparallel to a train, but at least he knew \u2014 you could tell he knew exactly where he\nwas going, and we didn\u2019t have the slightest idea where we were going.\n109January 25, 2015",
        "A: It\u2019s stuck in my mind now. Anyway, finally we got to the end \u2014 to bekist \u2014 paki\n\u2014 not Pakistan, it was Bekistan(ph). And there they told us to unload at one of the\nstations, I don\u2019t remember now which one.",
        "A: No, no, it wasn\u2019t Tashkent. But not far from it. And we \u2014 there were \u2014 they put\nis in the kolkhoz. You know what kolkhoz is?",
        "A: Kolkhoz is a government farm.",
        "A: Where people don\u2019t own anything, they just work for a government farm. A farm\nwas \u2014 they were raising cotton. This is main there, that\u2019s what they grow in that part\nof Uzbekistan. Well, they assign us to the Uzbek family. They gave us a little room\nwith a dirt floor, and my mother and my young \u2014 my older sister worked in the\nfields, and I worked 1n the smith shop.",
        "A: Russian authorities. But turned out that there were already some Polish\nauthorities in the area, too. Finally we contacted them. And they kept us \u2014 kept\ntelling us to sit tight, they\u2019Il notify us where and when we have to go. We spend, I\ndon\u2019t know, about four months up there, and working pretty hard. Finally, my\n110January 25, 2015\nmother again, she has enough. With the last thing that she still had \u2014 there were two\nmore Polish families in the area. They bribed drivers that were going \u2014 what we\nheard was town about hundred kilometers from where we were at, where there was\nalready Polish army post. So, one day we loaded up on the \u2014 on the truck, open\ntruck, and for next 24 hours \u2014 it took them 24 hours to drive us that hundred\nkilometers. Every 20 some kilometers, they had to change the tires on the truck.",
        "A: That good. Finally, at night, we arrived on that station, where we\u2019re su \u2014 we\nwere told that there\u2019s a Polish outpost. Sure enough, we unloaded at night, and we\nwere sit \u2014 by this time it was nice and warm up there. This is south of Russia. So, I\nthink it was some time in March or April already, and we were sitting against the\nwall on the \u2014 on the station. It started getting light, and we could hear men\u2019s walk is\nwith the military boots on the \u2014 on the platform. My mother jumped up and there\nwas a\u2014 one sergeant and two soldiers coming towards us. My mother looked at him\nand run to him and started hugging him. He was a policeman from the\nVorudek(ph).",
        "A: He was \u2014 the man was a \u2014 the sergeant was a policeman from the Vorudek(ph),\nthat knew my parents very well.\n111January 25, 2015",
        "A: From that time on our lives changed. Turned out that a quartermaster of the 22\"\nregiment, that was stationed in the place \u2014 place was called Karmana. And he was\na buddy of my father\u2019s. Quartermaster. He made my mother seamstress, she \u2014 she\nput \u2014 he put her to work. My older sister wer \u2014 couldn\u2019t go anywhere, because she\nsuffered \u2014 she infect \u2014 got infected with typhoid. But my younger sister was \u2014\njoined the girls \u2014 yo-young girls\u2019 camp. My brother and I, we went to the boys\u2019\ncamp. And also turned out \u2014 turned out that one day, while I was in the camp, I was\ntold that I have to report to the colonel that was in charge of 22\u2122 regiment. I got\nscared. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, I \u2014 I saluted everybody, and here I am told to\nreport \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to the colonel, of \u2014 of all the people. Turned out he knew my father when they\nwere young officers in the 1920. When he seen my name, he wanted to know if we\nknow what happened to father. So that\u2019s what he wanted me to report to him. But\nlike I said, from that time on, our lives changed. Mother was secure, thi \u2014 we were\nsecured.\n112January 25, 2015",
        "A: Oh God. First time I was taken to the military mess, they get me vast pool of rice\nand r \u2014 and raisins. I ate about quarter of it and I couldn\u2019t eat no more. I could not. I\nsat there and I cried because I can\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t swallow any more.",
        "A: I guess my stomach shrunk so that it \u2014 there was no room for it already. But\neventually, that went by. On the middle of August, 1942, we were put on the train\nfrom the Karmana, from the camp, and taken to the port on the Caspian Sea.",
        "A: Krasnovodsk.",
        "A: Krasnovodsk. We were put on the Russian ship. They \u2014 we were loaded,\nstanding room only, practically.",
        "A: Like sardines. My brother was on that ship, too. He was very sick. He wa \u2014 he\nhad dysentery, which sometime it can kill you.",

        "A: Well, n\u2014 on the camp, there was j \u2014 on that ship there was just two of us. My\nmother stayed behind with my grandmother and two sisters. They left about two\nweeks later. We arrived in [indecipherable] at that time was Persia, now it\u2019s Iran.\nPort of Baklevy(ph).",
        "A: Baklevy(ph), we arrived there. Finally, we were free. We could really say we\nwere free.",
        "A: It\u2019s like a \u2014 when the weight 1s dropped off your shoulders. That you could speak\nfreely without, you know, looking if someone is watching you. That you\u2019re your\nown master, you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re free. I was 14 years old. My \u2014 at that time, I\nwas still in Russia, I was assigned to the military band, and I was learning how to\nplay clarinet and violin. Clarinet, I was doing fine. Violin, I wasn\u2019t. But our main\njob was drumming. When the orchestra was marching, we were, the eight of us,\nlined up in the front, drummers. And also, whenever we had to \u2014 other parades, we\nwould take part of it. With that orchestra, I got out \u2014 I got out of Russia, and I got\nto \u2014 we got \u2014 from Persia we got to Camp Khanagin in Iraq.",

So I seen him when got to Iraq, and later we missed \u2014 we lost contact\nfor a while. And then in January 1943, we got orders to leave Iraq and go to\nPalestine, to join Polish military schools. There were so many of young boys that\nwas rescued from Russia, from all different camps. They formed schools, from\ngrade school that my \u2014 my brother was at \u2014 finally went through.
