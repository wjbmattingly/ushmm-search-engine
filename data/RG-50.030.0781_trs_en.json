        "Q: I wanted to ask about that.",
        "A: \u2014 it was like a [indecipherable] eastern. So that I \u2014 I really don\u2019t know what the\npopulation of the town would be, but it had a beautiful Russian Orthodox church,\nthere was a Catholic church, as I remember. And there were \u2014 there was a\nsynagogue or two, and there were restaurants, bookstores, because I very \u2014 my pa \u2014\nmy mother would take me to book stores, and I loved that, because it\u2019s got nice\npictures in the books.",

Especially apricots and\nyou could just go and pick them up.",
        "Q: Oh, how lovely.",
        "A: And in front there was a road, and \u2014 but it was all \u2014 the way I recall it, it was not\n\u2014 there were not many houses around us. Going down towards the river, more and\nmore houses were built like \u2014 were there.",
        "Q: So maybe you were on the outskirts of the town?",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 well, not outskirts, but I would say outskirts of the area where perhaps\npeople preferred to live, because it was near to the river, and there was a beautiful\nsight of the mountains on the Romanian side.",

But\nthen, since they saw that I was \u2014 I did it \u2014 you probably \u2014 no, you wouldn\u2019t know it\n\u2014 maybe your parents were \u2014 you know, over the sinks, where the faucet was, there\nwas something hanging there that was nicely embroidered, but \u2014 so they took that\npiece and gave it to me and said here, you want to cut anything, cut that.

And it was a \u2014 to this day I\nremember the beautiful forests, beautiful. And when the storm came, trees were\nknocked down. I remember being taken by my father, and he was showing it to me.\nWe were \u2014 the reason we really went to \u2014 to Ratzkibor(ph) was because there was\na camp for these young guys from high schools and so on, and my father was\ninvolved with them.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Yeah, they called him Mussolini, because he \u2014 he always would \u2014 he had very\nnice hair, but he always would really shave his head, because he thought that was\nreally healthier not to have it. Could we stop for one minute?",

Now, in \u201939, you\u2019re a child, you\u2019re a little girl, so I don\u2019t as \u2014 suspect that\n\u2014 that mu \u2014 much of the \u2014 of whatever discussions might have been, would have \u2014\nwould have reached you, but perhaps some did. Were the grown-ups talking about \u2014\nabout anything that had to do with politics, that you remem \u2014",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My parents, since they were brought up in the west, knew Germany very well.\nTo this day again, I remember my father putting on the radio, and listened to the\ninsane, hysterical speeches by Hitler. And everybody was apprehensive, but when\nthe day came when \u2014 a-after \u2014 it was already after the war started, and my father \u2014\nand that \u2014 that\u2019s a later story, but a \u2014 the last days really, of Polish resistance to the\n\u2014 to Germany. My mother, to \u2014 for a long time was saying that Father said, stay\nhere, stay here. This will be a very short war, because the bri \u2014 Great Britain will\nJanuary 30, 2015\nbe coming to help. Well. But yes, there was a lot of \u2014 I could feel that something\nhorrible was coming, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. So your \u2014 it reached down to the children, it reached down to you.",
        "A: Oh yeah, we \u2014 we knew that sa \u2014 something was going on, you know. And th \u2014\nof course, when the war started, that\u2019s another long story.",
        "Q: We will talk about that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, this last summer, after \u2014 after this vacation, you returned to \u2014 I forget how to\nsay this.",
        "A: Zaleszezyki.",
        "Q: Zaleszezyki.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You returned \u2014 the family returned to Zaleszezyki.",

        "Q: Okay. And you returned then to Zaleszezyki.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And did your father stay around, or did \u2014 was he called up for mobilization?",
        "A: He \u2014 he stayed around, because he was also not only taking care of the young,\nbut he was involved in the border corps.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But \u2014",
        "Q: What was the border corps?",
        "A: It was called cop(ph). And \u2014 but again, I \u2014 I am not sure that \u2014 there must have\nbeen some reason for transferring him from the west to the east. I don\u2019t know if that\nmove \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m sa \u2014 excuse me, I \u2014 I\u2019m just overthinking maybe, but I think the\nmove was not smart, because my father and my family didn\u2019t know anything about\nthe Soviets, really, they were more anti-German than the \u2014 they didn\u2019t know about\nwhat \u2014 what Poland endured in \u2014 on the eastern front, you know, so \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: Mm-hm, they were western Poles.",
        "A: Right, yeah, you know. So \u2014 but anyway, so he \u2014 no, he was not called.",
        "Q: He was not called.",
        "A: Th-The \u2014 September first came, and I re \u2014 that I remember too, it sort of sticks in\nmy mind. I was at home with our housekeeper, and my mother apar \u2014 went for a\nhair \u2014 to have her hair done. And I saw her we \u2014 ma \u2014 the housekeeper, I think,\nalready knew that some \u2014 he \u2014 she heard it on the radio that the \u2014 that the war\nmaybe started, because she took me to the window, and we were all way \u2014 both of\nus are waiting for Mother to come, to sort of confirm it, or whatever. And yes, she\ncame, and it \u2014 and again, it was sort of a\u2014 something horrible. Something is\nhappening anyway, horrible or not, yeah, at that point.",
        "Q: What was your housekeeper\u2019s name?",
        "A: Don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: And your dog\u2019s name?",
        "A: Sotka(ph).",
        "Q: Sotka(ph).",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And another question, since you were so close to the Romanian border, you were\nseparated just by the river Dniester?\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did you ever go on the other side?",
        "A: Ah yes, I was very proud of it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: A bridge was built across the Dniest from Poland to Romania, and there was a\ndedication of the bridge. And Father and I \u2014 I don\u2019t know if Mother went with us \u2014\nwent across the bridge, you know, because this was an opening, and I-I guess he\nwas one in \u2014 of the sort of \u2014",
        "Q: Dignitaries.",
        "A: Yes, maybe. So we went, and I was then, again, very proud of myself, because I\nbrought home, in a bag, grapes. And it was smuggling them, you know.",
        "Q: Oh my. The grapes were from the Romanian side?",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: Was there a similar town on the other side of the river? Or was it \u2014 or was there\nno settlement there?",
        "A: No, the \u2014 on the other side, a mountain is, really, mountains were. There were\nmountains. There were \u2014 was no beach or anything on the other side, very \u2014",
        "Q: No town?\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: There was a town, but I don\u2019t remember the town at all. I just remember go over,\nand then coming back. And I guess my mother wasn\u2019t there, because I brought these\ngrapes to my mother, I was smuggling them.",
        "Q: Do you remember the color of the grapes?",
        "A: Green.",
        "Q: Green. And so this was your one and only time in Romania?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. So the bridge must have been quite new.",
        "A: Oh, brand new, there was the opening of the bridge. I don\u2019t know what year it\nwas, you know, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and the bridge itself was \u2014 it \u2014 did \u2014 were motor vehicles able to cross it?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes, absolutely yes.",
        "Q: Pedestrians too?",
        "A: Pedestrians, but \u2014 yes, because I \u2014 we \u2014 we walked across.",
        "Q: And do you remember seeing any of the Romanian soldiers in their uniforms or\nanything?",
        "A: No, no, n\u2014I don\u2019t remember that at all, no.\nJanuary 30, 2015",

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 and your mother comes back from the hairdresser, and it\u2019s confirmed that there\nis this war \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 that has started, and by Germany attacking Poland. And then what happened?",
        "A: Well then, what starts is, first of all, there are \u2014 let me see what comes first? No\n\u2014 yeah, this is what comes first. So then, schools are closed, and my mother takes to\nschools, all blankets and pillows, and goes there to set up beds, because everybody\nis thinking that the wounded, and people, refugees would be coming from the west,\nwhich 1s true, they later come. So th-th-the \u2014 everybody was preparing for, really,\nthe influx of \u2014",
        "Q: Of people.",
        "A: \u2014 people from the west, and \u2014 but then also \u2014 which was, you know, one night \u2014\nand now I look, it was foolish, but there were trenches being built so \u2014 in case of\nbombs dropping, we would go into those trenches and hide. We went \u2014 when there\nwere alarms, we used to even go under beds, you know, and into the orchards there.\nBut it \u2014 when these trenches were being dug, I thought it was great, because they\nallowed me to do something too, so I was \u2014 felt very important, I remember that.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: It was exciting.",
        "A: Absolutely exciting. And then \u2014 there were quite a few alarms that the bombs\nwere, but only one bomb f-fell on Zaleszezyki, which is am \u2014",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, because was way \u2014",
        "Q: In the corner.",
        "A: Southeast corner.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But each time there would be an alarm, I would fuss, and insist that this dog is\ntaken with us, you know, and sometimes wit \u2014 they \u2014 we were \u2014 w-we didn\u2019t know\nwhether the bombs were co \u2014 ba \u2014 the planes were coming to bomb us. So I can\nimagine they were very mad at me, because they would has \u2014 somebody would\nhave to go back to get the dog, and then we\u2019ll hide, you know, and \u2014 as a matter of\nfact, very often we hid in that hut where our landlady lived, under her bed, because\nit was lower, and so on.",
        "Q: So her hut was close to the house she had built?",
        "A: Yes, yes, it was very unusual sit \u2014 set \u2014 set-up, so to speak.",
        "Q: Well, I could understand if she had no income, then the house she built provided\nher with income.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Exactly, exactly, yes, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because I don\u2019t think there was any th \u2014 she didn\u2019t have any relatives there,\nthat\u2019s true.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Was your father with you during these alarms, or was he first \u2014",
        "A: No, he was away. I don\u2019t know what \u2014 you know, what he was doing.",
        "Q: But he was still in Zaleszezyki?",
        "A: Zaleszcezyki, he \u2014 yes.",
        "Q: Okay. All right, so there were alarms, there were trenches being built, the school\nwas being prepared for refugees. What happened after that?",
        "A: After that, I remember also \u2014 that must have been already when the family from\nWarsaw came, as a refugees to our home, because I wa \u2014 I remember that the \u2014 the\nson in that family, who I don\u2019t know, he was me \u2014 he was like a teenager maybe ni\n\u2014 maybe 18, and this \u2014 took me, with little flowers, and lifted me wa \u2014 up at one\ntime, as the recruits were going to be put on \u2014 they had trains to go to fight the\nGermans in the west. So, you know, I was giving flowers to \u2014 to these soldier.",

        "A: We probably went there and \u2014 knowing that they will be leaving, you know,\neverybody was saying goodbye, and you know, really trying to-to \u2014 to-to give them\ncourage to go, you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you remember that incident?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and so, why did the family from Warsaw come?",
        "A: Well, they came because the \u2014 Warsaw by then was being bombed, life wa \u2014\nbombed out, and they came to us because my father and the \u2014 the father of that\nfamily that was \u2014 the name was Zhaglietski(ph). He \u2014 my father and he served\ntogether in Czarkow before that guy wa-was transferred to Warsaw.",
        "Q: Got it.",
        "A: And there are some politics involved, but I won\u2019t go in.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, does that have something to do with your story, this \u2014 the \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: No. Okay.\nJanuary 30, 2015",

        "Q: Did people think that they\u2019re being abandoned?",
        "A: Absolutely, you know, th-th-this was not the way to do it. Now, on the other\nhand, if they didn\u2019t \u2014 even my father didn\u2019t cross, and th-they were then interned in\nPole \u2014 in rem \u2014 Romania, in camps, because Romania joined the Germans, as one\nof their \u2014 for \u2014 for a while there was a neutral country. Many people also crossed to\nHungary, you know, but absolutely, yes. On the other hand, they were in between\nGermany and Russia. If the ones that were caught by the Russians ended up in \u2014 in\nthe slaughterhouses in Katyn, Starobielsk, you know, and so on, so it\u2019s the 15,000\nPolish officers and policemen were just shot in the back of the head, you know.",

And as I say,\nnobody \u2014 that I know for sure, nobody thought that the Russians will just enter from\nthe east, you know. There was no resistance to them, you know.",
        "Q: And so this must have been in those first two weeks?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",

        "A: Oh, absolutely.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: \u2014 imagine. Okay.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Well, you know, maybe not at the time when all this was going on,\nbecause nobody had the time to think about it. But \u2014 but right now, you know, years\nlater, after we escaped from really, Russia, everybody starts to talking about it, yes.\nBut no \u2014 nobody considered Smigty Rydz to be a good leader anyway.",
        "Q: Ah. So \u2014",

        "Q: He \u2014 why wasn\u2019t he respected as much?\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: He was not respected because I \u2014 I don\u2019t believe he has known much about\npolitics. There were many factions at that time in Poland. I \u2014 y-you know sa \u2014 some\npeople wanted s \u2014 si \u2014 thought that it would be better to sort of la \u2014 give concessions\nto the Germans, you know, because it supposedly all started about the corridor up\nthere, which is f \u2014 a farce. Some said, well, you know, we are Slavs, maybe we\nshould be looking to the east. So then \u2014 Poland was only free for how many years?\nTwenty-five years or so? And that \u2014 so there were \u2014 there was a lot going on in\npolitics. Of course, I\u2019m reading about it now, so I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So this is not your direct memory \u2014",
        "A: No-",
        "Q: \u2014 this is just what you\u2019ve learned afterwards.",
        "A: \u2014 no, no, that\u2019s not my \u2014 no, no.",
        "Q: No, no. And I try to distinguish that because \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u20141n some ways, we have to know the context, and you can only explain the\ncontext from what you find out later.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: But at the same time, we need to know where is it I directly remember this, but I\ndon\u2019t, you know \u2014 and si \u2014 and you\u2019ve been telling me very accurately.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and I appreciate that. You \u2014 you dig the trenches, cause they\u2019re exciting.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Because you\u2019re a little girl, you\u2019re seven years old, you know, that \u2014 that\u2019s how\nchildren respond.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and so that was the last time you saw your father?",
        "A: Yes, this is the last time I saw my father for 12 \u2014 13 years, you know. So \u2014 so\nthen, within weeks, really \u2014 I don\u2019t know how long after \u2014 I don\u2019t know even when\n\u2014 when they \u2014 this happened, but anyway, weeks later, sometime \u2014 by then it started\nraining, you know, and I remember, you know, statements to the effect, oh why\ndidn\u2019t it rain sooner? The times would be \u2014 would have been stopped, you know,\nthe Germans would have been really buried in the mud. It was raining very hard,\nand it \u2014 I know now that it was September 17, but I didn\u2019t know what \u2014",

        "Q: Okay. All right, so September 17 \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Seventeen, it \u2014 I remember being taken to the window, and it was pouring rain\nwhen the so \u2014 Russian soldiers were coming in. And they were \u2014 again, maybe I\ndon\u2019t remember it, maybe I heard it, but they were very poorly dressed. They bayon\n\u2014 their guns were, you know, on \u2014 on pieces of rope, and so on. And so I was taken\nto the window to just, apparently show \u2014 to \u2014 to see who was coming, and they were\ncoming and coming. Very soon after, we \u2014 schools opened again, you know. Now\nRussians are in, and while I hated school when the school started under the Polish \u2014\nyou know, when I was still free.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh, I just thought it was terrific, because they took me, with a red flag, on a\nparade. I didn\u2019t have to \u2014 to \u2014 what I recall on the Polish schools is the fact that I\nhad to \u2014 to ra \u2014 not \u2014 not to write even letters, but to make little, you know \u2014 learn\nhow to stay within the lines. I hated it. I also remember from the Polish school, and\nI\u2019m not sure why, when the priest came in this long robe, and told us a story, and I\nthought it was horrific \u2014 I-I guess he, I don\u2019t know in connection with what, that\nthere was this stork eating frogs, you know. I don\u2019t know why I remember.",
        "Q: There was a story and it had storks, and it had frogs, and you weren\u2019t very\nimpressed by it.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: No. But, when \u2014 when the Russians took me on a parade, and told me to wave a\nred flag, you know, and do nothing really, in school \u2014",
        "Q: That was fine.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That was fine.",
        "A: Terrible.",
        "Q: Were there still refugees who had wanted to go to Romania when the Russians\narrived, do you think?",
        "A: Well, there were a \u2014 yes, as many wounded soldiers, many wounded officers,\nmany pe \u2014 refugees continued to \u2014 to really a \u2014 during the nights and so on, bribe, or\nhave guides take them over the Dniest to Romania and Hungary. Yes, many pe \u2014\nmany \u2014 really civilians also escaped that way.",
        "Q: Even when the Russians were already there?",
        "A: Absolutely, yes.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: Because when the Russians came in, I mean, I think they were rather\ndisorganized at first, that \u2014 that \u2014 but it was very \u2014 1t was dangerous to cross the pa\n\u2014 to go across the river.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: Okay. So at one point it wa \u2014 you know, when peop \u2014 before they came, there\nwas uncertainty when people crossed, in that on the Romanian side, they were\ninterned in camps \u2014",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: \u2014 but there wasn\u2019t any danger from the Polish side, of letting people go. But\nwhen the Russians came, there was \u2014 it was dangerous then.",

And I hate to say it, but it was a young Jewish fellow \u2014 I \u2014I don\u2019t\nknow the fellow, but I know that there were people that work in the city\ngovernment, and they tried to s \u2014 to probably save their own skins, too. So this\nyoung guy, one night, I remember him, how he looked, came with a group of what\u2019s\nek \u2014 now KGB, or was KGB, NKVD [indecipherable]\nJanuary 30, 2015",

        "A: Soldiers, they would \u2014 they surrounded the house outside with these huge guns,\nand they always would come, as I recall, we would be sleeping, and around \u2014\nsoundly, and there would be pounding on the door, and they would come in,\nsurround the house, go in, stand inside. They would line us around at the walls, and\nthey would start saying, where is my father, and he \u2014 he\u2019s going to be hanging, or\nyou know, we cut his throat, and so on. And my mother did not know Russian. She\nknew German quite well, but not Russian, and had one time \u2014 this \u2014 this \u2014 this was\nfunny. I, of course, don\u2019t remember that, but I heard it now several times. I mean,\nbefore, several times. They came, and they would open everything and steal,\nbecause they would \u2014 they had let all the criminals out of the prisons, saying that\nthey were really suppressed by the [indecipherable] capitalists of Poland, right? So\nthey were free now.",
        "Q: So the \u2014 excuse me, I\u2019m going to interrupt right here.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: You \u2014 you\u2019re talking about the first time, and then several subsequent times?",

        "Q: And did you know him from earlier?",
        "A: Not \u2014 not I, but my mother recognized him as a clerk from the city hall.",

        "A: Oh [indecipherable] the Russians, really.",
        "Q: Okay, so, now here I have another discrepancy in here. Was it Russian soldiers\nwho came to the house, or these released thieves from the Polish \u2014",
        "A: Russian soldiers.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Russian soldiers.",

        "A: Oh yes. They \u2014 and they would open everything, and you know, ward \u2014 it\u2019s\ncalled wardrobe, I think \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, a wardrobe \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",

        "A: Several times, almost one night after another, and supposedly looking for my\nfather, but it was \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 wa \u2014 it was extremely difficult for any human being\nthat is thinking or reasonable, to see the reasons why things were happening, they\nwere \u2014 and why we were even taken to Russia, right? Why\u2019? What \u2014 how did we\ncontribute to economy of Russia? Nobody \u2014 right? No ha \u2014 right, correct? I mean \u2014",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That all this I\u2014 also was done because supposedly when the Russians entered,\nthey asked \u2014 they wanted to register everybody, and asked people whether it\u2019s \u2014\nthey were from \u2014 originally from west or east. And of course by then, when we saw\nRussians, my mother, of course, went and registered that she\u2019s from the west.

And you know, I grabbed, of course, the dog, and we were put on \u2014 on\nthese carts driven by horses, with again soldiers surrounding it. And we didn\u2019t know\nwhere they would drive us, but they drove us to a small village called Tluszez \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 which means fat.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: You still have the suitcase?",
        "A: Yes, yes. It\u2019s little. And it was, as a matter of fact, purchased way back in\nVienna, when we went, you know, for \u2014 on a last vacation.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. So \u2014 so, from your home \u2014 did you at least\ndress like wintertime, or were you put in \u2014",

        "A: No, everything was left \u2014 I mean now, everything you had, you know, what \u2014\nwhat you had. Dishes, everything was left behind.",
        "Q: And so then you \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Pictures on the walls, you know, things like that. Oh, by the way, pictures on the\nwalls, and silver \u2014 I remember this one time, even prior we \u2014 th \u2014 prior to when the\nRussians came, there was somebody, and I somehow recall this was a teacher who\nlived down the street. And one night the raincoats were put down on the floor, and\none \u2014 because we didn\u2019t have many valuable, but one valuable painting, and then\nsilver was wrapped in different raincoats, and the guy took it, and buried it in his\nbackyard. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not there.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re put in one room, together with the Zhaglietskis(ph)?",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 in this one room. What did that room look like?",
        "A: Well, it was still heaven compared to \u2014 to \u2014 to what we had in Russia.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know that yet.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So what did that room look like?",
        "A: Like any room. It still had electricity even, I think, as I recall. Yeah.",
        "Q: So was it a small house, a small hut, or \u2014",
        "A: It was on the second floor, so it must have been some two story house. I don\u2019t\nknow who lived on the bottom floor. But it was very cold all the time, and we were\nhungry all the time, because by then there was nothing, and the winter set in. I do\nnot remember \u2014 you ask me about Christmas \u2014 I don\u2019t even \u2014 I don\u2019t remember, I \u2014\nthere was no Christmas.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "A: There was no Christmas. A \u2014 I \u2014 the \u2014 my \u2014 my father, who was, as I mentioned,\nhe was outgoing, and he was a very fair man, and he \u2014 you \u2014 minority, so-called\nJanuary 30, 2015\nminorities really, were very much favorably inclined towards him, although\nsometimes military men were not exactly viewed favorably. So, there was another\nhouse where a \u2014 a Ukrainian family lived, in Tluszez. And I also remember that\nthey were very nice to us, and th-that they warned my mother that we will be\ndeported, you know. But what can you do by then?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Was there any word from your father, as to where he was?",
        "A: None. None.",
        "Q: So you had no idea?",
        "A: No, no, no. Well, I \u2014 the feeling all \u2014 always was, you know, he just wants to \u2014\nto stay and live, and you don\u2019t know what the next day will bring. I \u2014 you sort of \u2014\nyou develop that kind of a sense, you know.",
        "Q: So how was your mother, was she s \u2014 was she increasingly still more nervous\nand more tense, by the time you were in this place?",
        "A: Not maybe increasingly, but it was the same, just sort of \u2014",
        "Q: As before.",
        "A: \u2014 nervous, yeah. Nervous feeling.",

        "A: Well, these two young people already, were fine.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Mrs. Zhaglietska(ph), whom I called aunt because, as I say, we first met in\nCzarkow, you know, so I \u2014 I like her very much, and she was a very \u2014 she \u2014 she\nwas a very \u2014 she had the great sense of humor, so even in horrible situations, she\nwould come up with some silly joke, or whatever. But a \u2014 so y-yo \u2014 she \u2014 she really\nkept us in good spirits. In a way it was \u2014 I don\u2019t know if Mother and I would have\nsurvived without that family. I mean it, because my mother became pr \u2014 wa-was not\nwell at all, physically, and otherwise.",
        "Q: Tough, very tough.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So, how long did you stay in this place?",
        "A: Okay, then we spent the winter there, until April, but April was still very cold,\nApril \u2014 so no \u2014 we were fore \u2014 forewarned that we\u2019ll be deported, by the Ukrainians\nnext door, and \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to interrupt. Was this a large village, or a small village?",
        "A: Very small. A hole in the ground, you know.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: And very far from your home?",
        "A: That I am not sure, you know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Iam not sure. I don\u2019t even remember how long it took us to get there from\nZaleszczyki, I really don\u2019t remember that.",
        "Q: That\u2019s close enough that the Ukrainians \u2014 neighbors knew your father?",
        "A: Knew \u2014 correct, yeah. Because it was a \u2014 yeah, it was a \u2014 yes, very true.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You know that everything was sort of sparsely populated at that time, it\u2019s not so\n\u2014 yes, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay. So they\u2019ve given you a warning.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you know it\u2019s going to happen \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 you just don\u2019t know when.",
        "A: Correct. And you are a \u2014 you didn\u2019t know when. So we would go to sleep, but\nwe didn\u2019t know whether anybody would be coming or not. So on night,\nJanuary 30, 2015\n[indecipherable] was pounding on the door. Very, very cold night, that I\nremember. Extremely cold, snowing and so on. And the \u2014 the Russian soldiers came\nin, and told us [speaks Russian] again, you know, get out, get out. So ya \u2014 you are\nsleeping soundly, and then you are ar-ar-aroused from sleep, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014\neverybody was sort of 1n a daze, and I remember that pi \u2014 Mrs. Zhaglietska(ph),\nwho as I say, had a sense of humor and so on, when \u2014 she was very emotional, too.\nSo she started throwing things at the soldiers. I remember that, you know. So we \u2014\nwe just put whatever we had on ourselves \u2014 and of course I had my suitcase, you\nknow. But the dog, I-I was saying well, the dog has to come with us. But somehow,\nthat \u2014 that Ukrainian ca \u2014 ne \u2014 next door, they\u2019Il take \u2014 they said they\u2019II take care of\nthe dog. So they took the d \u2014 Sotka(ph).",
        "Q: The dog.",
        "A: And I also remember \u2014 so then they packed us onto these sleighs, horse-drawn,\nextremely cold. And this one Russian sol \u2014 I remember that, he took his coat, or\nwhatever he had on top of his coat, and put it on me, you know, bi \u2014 tha \u2014 tha-that\ntime I think I \u2014 as I recall, I really felt scared.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. Did you cry, do you remember?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t cry, but I felt it. No.",
        "Q: You felt the fear.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I think if I cry, that it would freeze.",
        "Q: And what happened?",
        "A: So, by \u2014 it took hours to get to the station, and I don\u2019t know what the station was,\nwhat the name of the town was. But by then it was light, and there were people\nstanding and some of them with bread, and whatever, to give to us. So then they\npacked us in \u2014 into the cattle wagons. And I don\u2019t know how to, again, cause there\nwere \u2014 on both sides of the cattle wagon there were these platforms, I think two of\nthem. And we landed on the uppermost one, and I don\u2019t know how long it took\nthem, but it probably took them a long \u2014 th-the \u2014 a whole day. And then they shut\nthe \u2014",
        "Q: Were you able to ta \u2014 get any food from those people?",
        "A: Yes, yes, we did. We did get some food from the people, yes.",
        "Q: So you weren\u2019t completely \u2014 you had at least something \u2014",
        "A: Absolutely, yes, yes. And \u2014 but it was great that these people wanted to do it,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: SoI\u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: How many people do you think were in your wagon?",
        "A: Oh my. Many. I would say maybe a hundred or more.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: But I may be wrong. On every platform, 25 or so on every platform.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Oh yeah, packed together, you know. But that was good, because then ke-kept us\nwarm, you know. No, I mean, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m joking.",
        "Q: So you were laying down.",
        "A: So was \u2014 I remember sitting in the corner, they put me in the corner on the upper\nshelf.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I was \u2014 my \u2014 my mother and Auntie Zhaglietska(ph) and her two kids. And\nthere are \u2014 then, on the other side, I know there was somebody that was very sick,\nold, because he was right \u2014 right away lying down. And there was a little baby, I\nknow, but I don\u2019t remember much, you know, of the \u2014",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know any of the other people on there?",
        "A: No, no, we didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So the \u2014 so then the journey started, you know.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: Was \u2014 were people standing as well?",
        "A: No. Nobody was standing. Everybody was on \u2014 on these platforms, nobody was\nstanding, no.",
        "Q: Okay. Was there any kind of heating in the place, in the \u2014",
        "A: I think there was in the \u2014 in the middle, in between, something, but I \u2014 I frankly\ndon\u2019t remember that. I only remember a hole in \u2014 in \u2014 in the middle, where one had\nto relieve oneself. I don\u2019t remember a little sto \u2014 but there must have been\nsomething, because it \u2014 we would have frozen.",
        "Q: Okay. I have a very sort of unhygienic question, but I want to understand things.\nWas that hole covered, or was it open?",
        "A: No, it was open. No, that \u2014",
        "Q: It was open \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: So, not only was it there for everybody to relieve themselves, but cold air could\ncome in through that.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. So the stove wouldn\u2019t help much, if it was \u2014",
        "A: No, no, the stove \u2014 but I\u2014 I\u2014 Iam \u2014I somehow think there was a stove, but I\ndon\u2019t remember it.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That hole I remember well. You know, later on, people would say oh, another \u2014\nthe transport already came by. Because if you looked through \u2014 you know, you \u2014\nthere were no windows, but if you looked, behind the train there was a \u2014 a really\nexcrements all over the tracks. And I \u2014 I remember.",
        "Q: Ew. But you could see it, huh?",
        "A: Oh yes, you could see it.",
        "Q: You saw it through the hole?",
        "A: No, I saw it \u2014 I \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s in the \u2014 the wall of the train, there were, you know, a \u2014\nslits.",
        "Q: Sl \u2014 ah, slats, or s \u2014 slit.",
        "A: Slit.",
        "Q: Slits, you could see that \u2014",
        "A: They somehow even told me to look. So \u2014",
        "Q: What happened after that?",
        "A: So, for about \u2014 for \u2014 for three we \u2014 21 days we were inside the-these \u2014 these\nwagons, and the train would go very slowly, stop whenever they wanted, I think.\nAnd the only food that we got from \u2014 from the soldiers that were all around, and\nthey were, I think in \u2014 in the front, in the back of the train, very, very salty dried, or\nJanuary 30, 2015\nfrozen fish. And the water you had to \u2014 to get by going to the front of the lock \u2014 of\nthe train, to where the locomotive was, because these were steam engines, I\nimagine. You got kipyatok, hot water from there.",
        "Q: Is kipyatok a Russian word?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Kipyatok.",
        "A: Hot water.",
        "Q: I want to ask a couple of things. Do you remember how many wagons made up\nthis train?",
        "A: Oh, I do not know, but it was long. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: So what would they do, they would open the doors and allow people to go to the\nfront?",
        "A: One \u2014 one or two would go, they wou \u2014 they would have to rush for the water\nwi-with a pail \u2014 I don\u2019t know that we had, or they gave us a pail \u2014 and would bring\nit in. But if somebody decided to stay in the train, they will be left there \u2014",
        "Q: On the side.",
        "A: \u2014 in the middle of nowhere.",
        "Q: Did that happen?",
        "A: Yes, several times. You know, not in my \u2014 not in our \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: Wagon.",
        "A: \u2014 wagon, but it happened. But anyway, so they would bring the water, and you \u2014\nth-the fish you couldn\u2019t almost eat, whether you were hungry anything. And that\nwas our \u2014 for days, that\u2019s what it was, for about what? Twenty-one days was \u2014 was\nno food [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So it was one pail of water for a hundred people on the \u2014 on the wagon, or\nhowever many there were.",
        "A: Well yeah, you didn\u2019t \u2014 this was hot water, it was cold, so nobody \u2014 I \u2014 we were\nnot \u2014 I don\u2019t remember drinking much.",
        "Q: But did everybody get some? Could one pail sa \u2014 you know \u2014",
        "A: Probably not. I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember that, you know, I can\u2019t rem \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 you know. One sort of becomes occupied with what is there, oneself, so to\nspeak.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. So they would go to the front, and I \u2014 I\u2014 I also need to understand,\nbut maybe you can\u2019t explain this to me, it was hot water from the locomotive?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But, I would think that water wouldn\u2019t be particularly clean.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It was hot \u2014 th-tha-that \u2014 it probably wasn\u2019t, but I\u2014 I can\u2019t\nremember.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] yeah. That could be also a technical question. Because maybe",
        "A: That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 maybe there is a way \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 th-that \u2014 because if it really wasn\u2019t clean, then a lot of people would have died.",

        "Q: Do you remember it?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Could you si \u2014",
        "A: No, don\u2019t ask me.",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: Really, please. Because I\u20191l become emotional. I really do. To this day. It\u2019s\ncrazy.",
        "Q: You sure you don\u2019t want to share that with us?",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: So that people would hear?",
        "A: This is crazy on my part [sings in Polish]",
        "Q: Thank you. Thank \u2014",
        "A: Sorry.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: No, I\u2014I-\u2014I-TI appreciate that even though there is a cost, that you were willing\nto do that. I want to have peop \u2014 for people to have a sense of \u2014 of what \u2014 what was\ngoing on in the hearts of those who were being taken over \u2014 taken across the border.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you see other things through the slats in the windows 1-in the car, you know,\nthe sla \u2014 the little slits?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. No. No, I d\u2014I don\u2019t even remember looking much, except as \u2014 as\nwe \u2014 Il am \u2014I-\u2014I confirmed it with the Zhaglietska(ph) \u2014 Marisha(ph), the \u2014 the\ndaughter. I said to her, am I hallucinating, or \u2014 I believe when we were crossing the\nUral mountains from \u2014 from European Russia to the Asian Russia, we stopped;\nbecause I remember we stopped, and they opened the doors. And there was a\nbeautiful field of flowers; yellow, I \u2014 I-\u2014 by then it was spring. Yellow, beautiful\nflowers. And she confirmed, she said yes, it happened.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Oh, that was \u2014",
        "Q: So your memory was not playing tricks on you.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: It was beautiful. To this day I remember it. Maybe also being cooped up so long,\neverything looked more beautiful when \u2014 when you are in the open, you know?",
        "Q: So \u2014 so that \u2014 were you allowed to go out of the train at that point?",
        "A: Yes, yeah, I remember being on the ground, yeah. It \u2014 again, we were probably\nin the middle of nowhere, but yes, we were allowed to go out.",
        "Q: Okay. What was your final destination?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know, and they would just put us here and tha-that is a \u2014 sometimes\nthe train would stop, towards the end of the journey, and some wagons were\ndetached, and we didn\u2019t \u2014 we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know, you know, who \u2014 whose wagon\nwill be detached. And then from those wagons, the people would be taken\nsomewhere. And when one point, after about 21 days, the wagons stopped, and it\nwas \u2014 wa \u2014 we [indecipherable] Kazakhstan, you know, and they let us out, and\nthey \u2014 they \u2014 thank you.",
        "Q: You\u2019re welcome.",
        "A: And this is how, in the middle, it was steps, open steps.",
        "Q: Fields?",
        "A: Fields, st \u2014",
        "Q: Tell me what did \u2014",
        "A: S-t-e-p-p-e, steppe.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: Tell \u2014 ex \u2014 describe to somebody who\u2019s never been and never will be on a\nsteppe, what does a steppe look like?",
        "A: It\u2019s like an open, flat prairie, going f-forever. Flat.",
        "Q: Does it look just like a prairie?",
        "A: Oh, well, it all depends on the time of the year.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But 1-1n the s \u2014 in the summer when we were there, the whole steppe, just like\nthe prairie, bloomed beautifully, gr-grass was growing. But I would say it\u2019s very\nsimilar to a prairie, yes, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay. Did you have any documents with you? Like I.D.s or passports, or\nanything like that?",
        "A: No, I do \u2014 no, nothing. No, nothing. We had \u2014",
        "Q: You just had your little s \u2014",
        "A: There was no I.D., nothing, yeah.",
        "Q: So you just had your little suitcase from Wilno.",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm, and I \u2014 whatever I put there. And I had, apparently, a few of the\nphotographs, because later on I started drawing something on the back, since there\nwas no paper.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: Oh, yeah. So \u2014 so people were let out, towards the end of the journey, in\ndifferent places.",
        "A: Correct. They \u2014 and they were then taken to collective farms, different collective\nfarms. But before \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I would like to say something else too. As we crossed the\nUral mountains, and then I know we were in a \u2014 well, really \u2014 Siberia really is \u2014 is\njust an imaginary kind of a\u2014 a place. But where Siberia sort of borders\nKazakhstan, we crossed to Kazakhstan. The tow-town was called Nowosibirsk.",
        "Q: Nowosibirsk, mm-hm.",
        "A: Si\u2014 very big town. We were taken to be deloused, because the Russian thought\nthat Poles are really a-absolutely uncivilized, because they don\u2019t have delousing\nstations. So we were \u2014 we were taken t-to \u2014 for a ba \u2014 for a shower, or whatever it\nwas, but it \u2014 to clean ourselves, and to be deloused. And in order to be deloused,\neverything was taken from us and put into, I don\u2019t know, hot ovens, or whatever. So\nthat no matter where \u2014 you had to give everything up, so whoever had anything\nmade out of leather became nothing, because it was shrunken, you know, almost\nburned. I remember gloves like that.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Leather gloves, and then they come back \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Yes, leather gloves, nothing, you know. So then \u2014 so, after delousing and a bath,\nwe then proceeded to \u2014 to where \u2014 oh, the \u2014 our wagons were left behind, and the\nrest went elsewhere, I am sure, you know, to other collective farms, and we were\nput on a carts driven then, because that\u2019s Kazakhstan, oxen. And very slowly we\ngot to this collective farm. The \u2014 the village was called Peschanka, and the farm\nwas a sovkhoz which was even higher than a collective farm, it was Soviet\ncollective farm, and it was a \u2014 a \u2014 of the name of Lenin, you know, Lenin\u2019s.",
        "Q: So it was Lenin\u2019s sovkhoz?",
        "A: Sovkhoz, that\u2019s right, s \u2014 Lenin\u2019s sovkhoz. So, this was a pig farm. So, w-when\nwe arrived there, there were already some deportees from Russia itself. When\nStalin took over, there were ex-Russian Orthodox priests, and intellectual \u2014 some\nintellectuals \u2014 I don\u2019t know, of course, who was who. But th \u2014 I remember they\nwere standing, and as we got off, they were sort of \u2014 their heads were \u2014 shaking\ntheir heads, saying that we \u2014 we will get used to it. Neechyebol (ph) privyknesh\u2019,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Neechyebol(ph) privyknesh\u2019.",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s the attitude, I think to this day. Now they have neechyebol(ph)\nprivyknesh\u2019 for Putin. But anyway \u2014 so, this is how is \u2014 our life started on this\ncollective farm, you know.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s cut for a second. [break] Okay, before the break, we were talking\nabout the journey to Siberia: that it took 21 days, and that by the time you arrived,\nit was already spring. And that your mother was sent \u2014 I mean, you and your mother\nwere sent to a sovkhoz, Lenin\u2019s sovkhoz, and it was a pig farm.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Tell me, did anybody come at any time, from the time you were, you know,\nreleased from the train, to the s \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable|",
        "Q: \u2014 to the sovkhoz, and tell you why you had been arrested, or where you were\ngoing, or \u2014 or anything official at all?",
        "A: Not a single word. We just were put a \u2014 and there were other Polish family, off\nthe wagon, or maybe two, three wagons, really, quite a few families. And some\nwere from Zaleszezyki, the same time \u2014 town, but some were not. Nobody told us\nanything, we were all put into a hall, wh-which was a hall in a school. But that\nschool was not really operating, there were no students there, it was ju \u2014 So we were\nfirst put to there. And I frankly don\u2019t remember what \u2014 what we \u2014 whether we were\ngiven anything to eat, or anything of that sort, but I \u2014 th-this was memorable,\nbecause we \u2014 we were put on the ground, you know, because there was nothing,\nJanuary 30, 2015\nwe\u2019re just on the floor, rather. And all of a sudden they showed us a movie with\nJeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.",
        "Q: In the middle of Kazakhstan?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yeah, I \u2014 don\u2019t ask me why. So I remember that, and I know that it\nhappened, because I\u2019m \u2014 as I say, on one or two photographs I have, on the back, I\npictured, I think, I know what \u2014 how the costumes were, or whatever. I drew it. So\nno, nobody was telling us anything, and ah \u2014 so that was spring. I remember co \u2014 to\ncontinue living in that place until winter, or maybe the beginning of \u2014 you know,\nwinter starts earlier there. So 1t was maybe no \u2014 I don\u2019t know what month, but it\nwas snowing. And one time it snowed so much, and that \u2014 there \u2014 the \u2014 we couldn\u2019t\nget out, because it\u2019s similar to what\u2019s happening in the east now, or was, anyway.",
        "Q: Okay, well right now we\u2019re talking \u2014 you\u2019re referring to a recent snowstorm, 1n\nthe past \u2014",
        "A: Correct. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: \u2014 few days, in January 2015.",
        "A: Correct, on the east coast. You \u2014 you couldn\u2019t get out, and you sort of looked\ndown and you had to dig yourself out of that of that [indecipherable]. It was\nextremely cold, crowded, and \u2014",
        "Q: This is where you lived for \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 several months?",
        "A: Several months before we were then allotted, or put into a hut that was half dug\nin the \u2014",
        "Q: Ground?",
        "A: \u2014 and half outside. It was made of mud, really, with straw in it, for some reason.",
        "Q: What was the name of this place? Do you remember what the place name itself\nwas?",
        "A: The place of the name was Peschanka.",
        "Q: Peschanka.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. You know, later on I rem \u2014 I probably don\u2019t \u2014 but later on when I started\nwriting \u2014 I started writing in the camp around Teheran. | have diaries, that\u2019s why I\nremember some of this stuff.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, very good.",
        "A: Pll show you one of them.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. So, you were in Peschanka for at least four or five months in the\nschool \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Correct. That\u2019s the \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 hall, and then in a hut nearby.",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "Q: Did your mother have to go work?",
        "A: My mother was not working. Everybody else went working, because if you don\u2019t\n\u2014 didn\u2019t work, you didn\u2019t get this bread that\u2019s as \u2014 you would not call bread, but you\nknow, that was all rations. Was like a piece of heavy mud, but it was fa \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have to buy it, or was it given to you?",
        "A: Hm. No, it was given to us. We didn\u2019t get any money, you know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No. No money was exchanged. And even if we had money, there was nothing to\nbuy anyway. It was all a \u2014 like a barterer economy. You \u2014 we \u2014 in order to \u2014 to\nexchange anything for food, you gave what you had, you know: a coat, gloves that\nwere shrunken, but a \u2014 just a \u2014 one item for another.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Material item. So, I did not go to school, but there was a family with us, who\nwere again, teenagers, and they appealed to me because they were teenagers. And\nall of a sudden it just \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 one of them became sort of my teacher, or\nwhatever, and I sort of started writing. I didn\u2019t mind writing on pieces of\nJanuary 30, 2015\neverything, and it was no longer a chore. All of sudden I hated every Russian,\nmaybe. I was very mad at them, at what they were doing to us. I don\u2019t remember\nbeing very frightened, but I was always sort of angry.",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a very natural response. Your mother \u2014 now, you said that when\nyou had, even at that beginning of the deportation, your mother was not quite well.",
        "A: Correct. She had that \u2014",
        "Q: So what happened?",
        "A: Well, she had the heart problem to begin with. So, it got progressively worse,\nbecause I\u2019m sure she was very much upset, and so on. So, there were, of course,\nexiled Russian doctors in Peschanka too, but they had nothing to give you to help\nyou when you were sick. But they were extremely good doctors. But they were\nexiled like we, because they were doctors, they were enemies of the state again. So,\nthey somehow wrote that my mother didn\u2019t have to work, which was worse,\nbecause then we didn\u2019t get that piece of bread, but the Zhaglietska(ph) family\nshared with us, you know.",
        "Q: I see, so you were kept alive \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Beca \u2014 and did all three of them work?\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Yes. And one of them, the \u2014 the brother worked as a laborer in \u2014 in some factory\nwith Russian workers. And he \u2014 one time obviously, without knowing how, that\neveryone spied on everyone, said that Polish workers had it much better than the\nRussian workers, and they \u2014 somebody in that factory denounced him. So, of\ncourse, I don\u2019t know how many days after, maybe very soon after, again, soldiers\ncame, surrounded us, and surro \u2014 came into the \u2014 where we were staying, and\nshoved us again together, and took him to the gulag, you know. He was 19. So he\nended \u2014 and the mother went crazy, you know, just crazy. So that he \u2014 he ended up\ni-in the gulag itself, in the prison camps. Fortunately, he survived, but he had many\nstories to tell too, as I recall, after that, because he met such strange and different\npeople, and of course was awful, awful. Worse than on a collective farm.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. All because he had said \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 that Polish workers had it better.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Because you know, what\u2019s the purpose of communism, right? To\nimprove the workers\u2019 conditions, so \u2014",
        "Q: So then there were two of them left to work for four people, basically.",
        "A: Correct. Yes. But then, the gir \u2014 young woman, Marisha(ph) \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhat she did before, but again, the winter \u2014 after winter, then \u2014 then there was\nJanuary 30, 2015\nspring, but in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in summer, I remember that Marisha(ph) worked in the\npig farm, and then they gave me a job of being her assistant, because you had to sort\nof herd the pigs in the steppes, otherwise they would go, and be \u2014",
        "Q: They would run away.",
        "A: Of course, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So \u2014 but that was a pass, because then we would si \u2014 well, we would really steal\nfrom the pigs. Of course, if you were caught, that was gulag again, but fortunately \u2014",
        "Q: How could you steal from a pig?",
        "A: Well, the pigs ate something which 1s called makukhay(ph), and it was what the\npigs were eating, and they even \u2014 even ha-had some milk, which we never saw. And\nthat we didn\u2019t steal, because you couldn\u2019t take it with you. But makukhay(ph) is a\nsunflower from which the oil, sunflower oil \u2014",
        "Q: Is pressed.",
        "A: \u2014 1s pressed out, and it\u2019s sort of smooshed together, and it\u2019s rather hard, but you\nknow, is given to the pigs, and we ate that. So that was a plus, in a way, because\nthere were some \u2014 some vitamins 1n it, I imagine, you know.",
        "Q: So it was already prepared food for the pigs \u2014",
        "A: For the \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: \u2014 for the pigs.",
        "A: Mm-hm, right.",
        "Q: And when you would take them out to keep watch on them, you would be able to\neat whatever \u2014",
        "A: Whatever we found, yes. We sometimes also ate what grew in the steppes, like, I\ndon\u2019t know, grass that was sort of tasty.",
        "Q: Yeah. And \u2014 and so you were helping her.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You were helping her by \u2014 by \u2014 how many pigs did you have to keep watch on?",
        "A: Oh, I have no idea.",
        "Q: Was it a lot?",
        "A: Many.",
        "Q: Many, okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And were the pigs slaughtered on this farm as well?",
        "A: No. I\u2014 no, they were taken somewhere, and of course, sold to the elite. You\nknow, Moscow, Leningrad, or whatever \u2014 Stalingrad, rather, you know, and\neverywhere.",
        "Q: So, you never saw any meat, you never saw any pork?\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: No, not a single piece of meat, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No meat. There were some cows around. I don\u2019t remember drinking milk.\nBasically it was da \u2014 the \u2014 th-that bread, and what we could steal. Some people\nworked digging \u2014 digging out potatoes, and they would steal potatoes by putting\nthem \u2014 you know, you had a coat, and you put it in between. So they \u2014 some people\nwere very heavy with that, but y-you were \u2014 had to be very careful, because that\nmeant again, gulag, if you were caught.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But again, the Russians did not have it better, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Except they ate maybe a li \u2014 they ate better, because they probably here and\nthere had the garden, I don\u2019t remember now.",
        "Q: So that you were in the hut together with \u2014 I forget the fa \u2014 na \u2014 family name.",
        "A: Zhaglietska(ph) family.",
        "Q: Zhaglietska(ph) family.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And you shi \u2014 the four of you, after the boy, and what was his name, the 19 year\nold?\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Zbishu(ph) Zbigniew.",
        "Q: Zbigniew.",
        "A: Like Zb",
        "Q: Yeah, so Zbigniew Zhaglietski(ph), after he was then sent to the gulag, it was\nthe four of you in the hut.",
        "A: Correct. Yes.",
        "Q: And when you\u2019re \u2014 when you went out with Marisha(ph), was that her name?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And her mother, to work, your mother was left in the hut?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Did she cook for any \u2014 for everybody? What did she do?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s wha-what she did, but mo-mo-mostly, she endless \u2014 spent endless\nday \u2014 days being interrogated by \u2014 by the secret police in that vi \u2014 stupid village,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: Oh yes, endlessly. Endlessly asking her wh-wh-where is my father, and that\nshe\u2019s spying. I mean, you couldn\u2019t do anything there, but \u2014 but so, she would go,\nand I never knew that she would be coming back. And of course, one time she was\neven denounced, again by a\u2014 an elderly woman who had a \u2014 a daughter, and the \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015\nthat daughter was sickly, so she did it for an egg, because she thought that the\ndaughter\u2019s sickness, which was \u2014 I think she had TB, but I don\u2019t remember now \u2014\nthat eggs will help her. I remember her taking the egg, taking the eggshell, and\ncrushing it, and giving it to that \u2014 you know, with the egg, because she thought, you\nknow, that consuming the eggshell would help her. So \u2014",
        "Q: And in order to get the egg, she did \u2014 how wa \u2014 how did you find out then? What\ndid she do?",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it \u2014 1t was obvious, because she would \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I wa \u2014 didn\u2019t do\n\u2014 didn\u2019t look at it that way. I only saw the egg, and then the \u2014 I \u2014 you know, what \u2014\nwhat was said among us, that she was spying on us.",
        "Q: I see. Was sh \u2014",
        "A: On everybody, not only on my mother, yeah.",
        "Q: Was she also one of those who was deported?",
        "A: Yes, of cour \u2014 yes, yeah. An elderly woman, and it wa \u2014 she was from\nZaleszezyki too, with her \u2014 she was deported with her daughter, and a little\ngrandson.",
        "Q: That must have been very bitter, that \u2014",
        "A: Oh \u2014 oh yes, yeah. But somehow \u2014 later on we met in Teheran with this family,\nand it \u2014 we became reconciled. We did not feel any \u2014 because we knew \u2014 y-you\nJanuary 30, 2015\nknow, people, I \u2014 I guess, react strangely, you know, and the \u2014 we are hungry, or we\nare desperate to save your own child. They emigrated to South Africa then.",
        "Q: After that.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: From Teheran, yeah.",
        "Q: So, your mother, even though she got a certificate that she was ill and couldn\u2019t\nwork, was nevertheless called to be interrogated \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes. That wa \u2014 that \u2014 I \u2014 the two had n-no connection.",
        "Q: Nothing to do with it.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay. I see. She must have been in quite a nervous state.",
        "A: She was, and th-this is \u2014 th-this was tough for \u2014 for me in that time. So \u2014 because\nI would wait, and I never \u2014 and it was endlessly she would be called, and I \u2014 it was\nfutile, I mean, just think of it. In the middle of nowhere, wha-what is she doing se \u2014\nwhat is she sending, anyway? You couldn\u2019t do anything.",
        "Q: Yeah, what could she \u2014",
        "A: There was no electricity, no radios, no nothing.",
        "Q: What kind of a spy could you be?\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Right, but \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s a nice system.",
        "Q: And very tough on a child, very tough. Were you \u2014 it sounds like that you\ncouldn\u2019t really turn to her for comfort, because \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s true. I \u2014 this is why I \u2014 as I mentioned before, I think \u2014 I mean,\nunfortunate as it was for them to be deported with us, the Zhaglietski(ph) \u2014\nespecially the mother Zhaglietski(ph) \u2014 Zhaglietska(ph) had me \u2014 ha-had us both\nreally. Me.",
        "Q: Yeah, so you gu \u2014 so if you had some issue, or some problem, would you go to\nher?",
        "A: Ah, yes, yeah, I would, but I don\u2019t remember that I ever really complained about\nanything to anybody. I was always angry at the Russians.",
        "Q: Are you still?",
        "A: Yes, but I\u2014 well, for a while that dropped off, thinking oh, poor people, they \u2014\nbecause we knew that they suffered too. But after they won so-called freedom with\nGorbachev and so on, the Perestroika, I said well, great, they will be on the way\nJanuary 30, 2015\nnow, let\u2019s see. And look what\u2019s happening. It \u2014 it\u2019s really \u2014 it seems to be in the\nRussians\u2019 character to \u2014 to have some \u2014 to \u2014 to like to be dictated, and be enslaved,\nreally, you know. I mean, we \u2014 they have a dictator now, and for the sake of the\ngreat Russia \u2014 they love their country, they love their piece of land, but th-they \u2014\nsomebody said that the Russians are \u2014 are \u2014 are good friends, but bad citizens, and I\nthink that\u2019s true.",
        "Q: Okay. How did things go forward? How did they progress?",
        "A: So when, as I mentioned, which is very interesting, there were German co-\ncolonies, or really collective farms, because apparently, when the communism\nthrived in the \u2014 Russia \u2014 or thrived maybe it is bad word \u2014 some Germans\nemigrated, really, to Russia, and they were put on collective farms, and those farms\nwhen \u2014 were run better than the \u2014",
        "Q: Sovkhoz?",
        "A: \u2014 So-Soviet \u2014 Soviet farms. So, since Mother knew German, in order to get\nanything again \u2014 not for money, but for a piece \u2014 say, a good tooth, or whatever, she\nwould go and once she brought honey, I \u2014 I \u2014 I remember. So the \u2014 the \u2014 we lived,\nand we \u2014 we tried to \u2014 to \u2014 to really eat as well as we could, here and there, you\nknow, not to starve. I know I was sick. I don\u2019t know if I had scarlet fever, which is\nnow very \u2014 or \u2014 or something else, but I was very sick once in Russia, but not \u2014 not\nJanuary 30, 2015\n\u2014 not very sick otherwise. And so I \u2014 I and Marisha(ph) worked with the pigs, and\nwe didn\u2019t know what to expect. And wh-when winter came you really \u2014 I mean, our\nbreath would freeze. We would be unable, or even don\u2019t want to go outside,\nbecause \u2014",
        "Q: This was the winter of 1941?",
        "A: Correct. 1941? Yes. So we all, in 1941 then, in June, all of a sudden the news\ncame \u2014 and of course there were no radios, there were just loudspeakers sometimes,\nbut that was not announced during \u2014 by a loud speaker. Somebody came in June\n41, and told us that the Germans attacked Russia. So everybody was ecstatic about\nit, people were happy, including the Russians that were there. Because finally the\nStalin era will perhaps be finished, you know. And I don\u2019t know how, but \u2014 how\nwe got the news that the Polish government in exile in Great Britain started\nnegotiations already, talks through the \u2014 the British officials, with Stalin, or\nwhoever was th \u2014 one of the other henchmen in Russia, they started looking for the\ndeported Poles, you know, and especially officers, you know, so \u2014 so \u2014",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know that at the time, when you were in this farm in\nKazakhstan?",
        "A: No. No, no.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: I wanted to ask something else: aside from how you were greeted by these\nRussian exiles, who said you will get used to it, you will get used to it \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 and the doctors who were good, and tried to treat \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 your mother, but had no \u2014 did you have contact with these Russian deportees\nand exiles? Did \u2014 was there talk and \u2014 and communication with them?",
        "A: There was not much talking with them, because my \u2014 very few people spo-spoke\nRussian, and there was not much talking with them. And as far as me as a child is\nconcerned, I did play with chi \u2014 Russian children, you know. And there were two\nboys, and the father was in charge of some sort of a \u2014 like a lumberyard, I\nremember. So \u2014 but there was not much of a contact otherwise. No, and there was\nno \u2014 no \u2014 no \u2014 you e \u2014 I think that perhaps nobody was discussing anything with\neach other because everybody was afraid of everybody, you know. You could go \u2014",
        "Q: You \u2014 your own circle, that is you, Mrs. Zhaglietski(ph), and your daughter, yo\n\u2014 that didn\u2019t affect you. You were like a cell. You \u2014",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: \u2014 you \u2014 you trusted one another.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: You were like \u2014",
        "A: And all the po \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Basically, all the Poles were like that, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Except the grandma, who needed the egg.",
        "A: Yes, yeah. I don\u2019t remember anyone \u2014 I then heard later on that there was\nsomebody else, but I don\u2019t even know if it was in our \u2014 on our collective farm, that\nwas like that. But there were people that were trying to save their own lives, and\ndenouncing others.",
        "Q: The winter of \u201941, you stayed inside, you said because it was so cold.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: When spring came, were you working again, helping Marisha(ph), or \u2014",
        "A: No. They some \u2014 they threw me off of that.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. Maybe you were eating too much of the pigs\u2019 food, you never\nknow.",
        "A: Probably. No, I hope they didn\u2019t know about.",
        "Q: Okay. So in June *41, you do learn that Germany attacks the Soviet Union.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: But the other developments, you don\u2019t know about yet.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: The ones about the negotiations for Polish officers, and so \u2014 and how \u2014 how did\nthat summer progress? What were you doing, and what was your mother doing\nduring that summer? Was she still being interrogated?",
        "A: All of us \u2014 all \u2014 yeah \u2014 I don\u2019t remember that that month she was or \u2014 you know,\nwhat month it\u2019s ended, or whatever \u2014 her interrogations or whatever they \u2014 you\nknow. Really, intimidation and harassment, you know. But what \u2014 after that \u2014 that\nwas announced that \u2014 it was announced that we have amnesty, that we can move\nfreely through Russia. Well, now \u2014 now, think of it. You are in the middle of\nnowhere, and you are going to move freely in Russia. So all the Poles \u2014 again, I\ndon\u2019t know how we found out all this, but somehow all the Poles tried to get out\nfrom collective farms, which was not easy. They didn\u2019t want to let us go, and of\ncourse they did \u2014 physically it was almost impossible. So I can\u2019t tell you though,\nhow the news that the Polish government was sending emissaries, or representatives\nto try \u2014 trying to find us, I don\u2019t know how we got the news. But Zhaglietskis(ph),\nmy mother, and some other family decided to get out of the sovkhoz \u2014 called\nsovkhoz house and go, move towards a city, and Semipalatinsk was the city.",
        "Q: How do you say that again?",
        "A: Semipalatinsk.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: Semipalatinsk.",
        "A: Semipalatinsk.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 was known when they started to sending Sputniks\ndown.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s Kazakhstan nearby. So, by whatever means again, bribery\nthrough \u2014 not \u2014 not so mu \u2014 mun \u2014 there was no money, but whatever you had, you\nknow.",
        "Q: To sell.",
        "A: Yes. To exchange. So we somehow got out of Peschanka to a port on a river\nthat\u2019s Irtysh river, because I remember that, getting on a\u2014 some boat. And we then\nproceeded south, to Semipalatinsk, and I also remember that there were \u2014 I\nremember seeing it somehow, in that the German colonists that were before, really\nhighly \u2014 in a way fr \u2014 relatively highly regarded, because they settled in communist\ncountry \u2014",
        "Q: So they have been German [indecipherable]\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 they were being deported because the Russians attacked from the west. So they\nwere now taken o-off of their collective farms and thrown out. The Russian\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Because Germany was attacking.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Because Germans were attacking.",
        "A: Yes. So they were taking over, yes.",
        "Q: So \u2014 but these must have been German communists, or people who were \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, absolutely, yes.",
        "Q: They were people who ideologically were for the social system.",
        "A: [indecipherable] Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: I see. Okay.",
        "A: Mm-hm. So \u2014 so then a \u2014 aw \u2014 down the Irtysh we somehow \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhat the \u2014 what means of transportation we took or may \u2014 because I don\u2019t think\nSemipalatinsk is on the Irtysh. We landed in Semipalatinsk, where also\nZbishu(ph) who was released from prison, because the amnesty was proclaimed for\nall, found himself there, and found a room with Russia \u2014 Russian couple, and it was\nthe \u2014 so when we first arrived, I'll never forget, we went to see wh-where we were\ngoing to stand \u2014 and again, quite a few Poles living together, but it was in the city,\nJanuary 30, 2015\nand so on. But anyway, that \u2014 the landlady and her husband were eating potatoes\njust covered with butter, I \u2014 I\u2014 I almost fainted right there. Food was always on\none\u2019s mind. But the \u2014 the landlady\u2019s husband was a chef at some cadet school, so he\nwould steal from them. This is how they had lots of food, but they don\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t\nshare it with us. Instead again, we stole from them, because the landlady had in \u2014 in\nher \u2014 like basement, da \u2014 un-under \u2014 dungeon-like area, really. She had like a tall \u2014\ntoasted dark bread. So we si\u2014 we would position guards to see if she was coming,\nand one would go down and steal.",
        "Q: To be \u2014 everybody needed to eat.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Right, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. So Zbigniew had found a room in their place?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And then all five of you were in this room?",
        "A: All five plus a \u2014 one more fellow whose mother died in Peschanka, and we\nburied her in the steppes, so there were six of us \u2014",
        "Q: Six people.",
        "A: \u2014 s1x people. And Semipalatinsk then did get some \u2014 some representative of the\nPolish government, you know, they were sent all over Russia to be looking whose \u2014\nwho \u2014 who is there. Nobody knew what happened to the 15,000 Polish officers, you\nJanuary 30, 2015\nknow, nobody knew. So, we then found out that there is a Polish army under the\nBritish \u2014 British are \u2014",
        "Q: Authorities?",
        "A: Authority, correct.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: For \u2014 being formed in the south, in \u2014 in Uzbekistan. So, since everybody wanted\nto get the heck out of Russia, you know, maybe we \u2014 we should be going south. So\neverybody from [indecipherable] to the north, everybody was trying to get south.\nAnd again, you had to bri \u2014 in the meantime, war is going on, as far as Russia is\nconcerned. So \u2014",
        "Q: Can we interrupt just for a second?",
        "A: Yes, sorry.",
        "Q: When you say Russia, do you mean the Soviet Union?",
        "A: Yes, I do, sorry, yeah.",
        "Q: Because \u2014",
        "A: I know.",
        "Q: \u2014 Kazakhstan is not part of Russia, nor is Uzbekistan, but they were all part of\nthe Soviet Union.",
        "A: Absolutely true, yes.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: Okay, okay, just wanted to make sure \u2014",
        "A: Norman Davis.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, he\u2019s absolutely right, yes, absolutely. Soviet Union.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: So we \u2014 we somehow \u2014 we started going south.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And it is 1941, already maybe fall.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And of course we \u2014 it takes a \u2014 days to get to where supposedly the Polish army\nis being formed. And I \u2014 again, you have to \u2014 the trains are slow, overloaded. You\nwait at stations, you wait at different stations, and lice is all over, all over.",
        "Q: That\u2019s why they had delousing stations?",
        "A: Uh-huh. You \u2014 you \u2014 you wait in the station, you s \u2014 you know, it\u2019s crowded,\nand so on. So li\u2014 you \u2014 you open that \u2014 you \u2014 you look \u2014",
        "Q: In your sleeves?",
        "A: \u2014 a long \u2014 you have sleeves like that, and they are crawl \u2014 marching, you know,\nevery \u2014 marching. But again, the Russians would say, oh, don\u2019t worry. When new\nJanuary 30, 2015\npeople, cleaner people come to the station, the lice with leave you. And do you\nknow that supposedly they did, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: I want to ask something; when you were able to leave Peschanka, is that the\nplace?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were you issued any documents, or any permission, so that if anybody stopped\nyou \u2014",
        "A: Yes, I believe, I believe so, but I\u2014 I wouldn\u2019t know it, you know.",
        "Q: Okay. So you got some piece of paper that showed you are allowed to go?",
        "A: Yes, I believe so.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I would \u2014 I\u2014 I can\u2019t guarantee it, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So there you were at the stations, together with lice who also want to leave the\nSoviet Union, and you are trying to get south.",
        "A: Yes. So we get south, and by then it\u2019s b \u2014 the \u2014 almost December.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: So we get south, and there is nothing but some tents and a few Polish men who\nescaped, or walked \u2014 and people walked thousands of miles. Sa \u2014 some people ca \u2014\nsome \u2014 in some families, mother and father were dead, and th-the eldest child would\ncarry youngest one. So this \u2014 just tragic stories, you will hear them probably. Awful\nstories. But anyway \u2014 so, we arrive and there\u2019s nothing. And when we \u2014 but a few\ntents, and a few men that still don\u2019t have uniforms, nothing.",
        "Q: So where was this place that you arrived to?",
        "A: Yangiyul, it was called.",
        "Q: Yangiyul.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, okay.",
        "A: So \u2014 so, there is nothing. Nobody is \u2014",
        "Q: Waiting for you?",
        "A: \u2014 doing anything. And we were not the only one doing this, but we never \u2014 I not\n\u2014 don\u2019t remember ever meeting anybody else in that place where there was nothing.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So we then \u2014 this \u2014 deci \u2014 we decide to go back, because at least we know \u2014 to\nSemipalatinsk.",
        "Q: Okay.\n100January 30, 2015",
        "A: Because if you didn\u2019t go back, you would end up on another collective farm,\nworse than the one you were probably in, because that is Uzbekistan, you know,\nthere\u2019s not really, I don\u2019t know, sheep.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And again, later on I find out that many people just disappeared, because they \u2014\nthey stayed on another collective farm, and that was the end of them, you know. It\u2019s\njust \u2014 just not ba \u2014",
        "Q: So they were forgotten, they were never registered, never \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, right, right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So we go \u2014 we start going back, which was worse than coming \u2014 going south.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Winter is \u2014 1s \u2014 it is \u2014 is there, cold. So when we arrived in Semipalatinsk, I\ndidn\u2019t have any shoes on, and of course, cold, and I \u2014 I\u2014 my feet were frostbitten,\nand they don\u2019t bother me now, but they bothered me England, because we came\nfrom warm climate to ba \u2014 anyway, so there we arrive, and the \u2014 the room was still\nthere, because maybe one of the guys still was there, I don\u2019t remember now.",
        "Q: Okay.\n101January 30, 2015",
        "A: So we go, and we then \u2014 there is a representative of the Polish government in the\n\u2014 established in Semipalatinsk. And material help comes from U.S. and Great\nBritain, for example, shoes and so on. And again \u2014 but it all takes time. So we then\nstart back to go south in \u2014 in the summer.",
        "Q: So you stayed the whole winter in Semipal-palatinsk?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: [phone ringing] Can I cut please? [break] So, you stayed the winter in\nSemipalatinsk?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you lived in this one room?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you got some sort of material help from the Polish authorities, that was sent\nthrough Americans and British?",
        "A: Correct, yes.",
        "Q: And then, you\u2019re there for several months, and in the summer you start to go\nsouth again.",
        "A: Correct. Yes.",
        "Q: And \u2014 why\u201d?",
        "A: Why? In order to escape.\n102January 30, 2015",
        "Q: So-",
        "A: And by now we know that there 1s \u2014 that there \u2014 there are -- Zbishu(ph), the \u2014\nthe Zhaglietski\u2019s(ph) son, already joined the \u2014 I think he was, later on he was in the\nair force, but he went south before us.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But of course, there\u2019s no communication, it\u2019s just tha \u2014 with this representative\nhere, that \u2014 tha-that \u2014 so we \u2014 we start going south again. And \u2014",
        "Q: This is now summer of \u201942?",
        "A: Correct. It\u2019s now easier, because it\u2019s summer. But I do remember by then, trains\nfilled with wounded Russian soldiers being transported. I mean, on \u2014 not even under\ncover. There were many wounded. I\u2019m sure they went the \u2014 ended up in gulag later\non. But anyway \u2014 but a \u2014 so we \u2014 when we then arrive in Yangiyul \u2014",
        "Q: Again, the same place.",
        "A: Correct. There is \u2014 oh, there are tents and there are many Polish civilians there,\nbut \u2014 and the Polish soldiers, th-their rations came from the British army. So they\nshared the food with us, because Stalin didn\u2019t want to give any food to us at all. So\nthey shared the food, and prior to our arrival, there were already two \u2014 two\ntransports out of Russia, over the Caspian Sea to Teheran. So we then end up\nreally closing the camp, and whatever civilians are there \u2014 and again, you know,\n103January 30, 2015\nwhen you arrived in the south, and you started to eat a little bit better, everybody\nwas getting si \u2014 ty-typhoid, dysentery. Lack of vitamins, you know, I was covered\nwith something, I don\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called.",
        "Q: Sores, or \u2014",
        "A: Sores, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, some sores.",
        "A: Oh \u2014 yeah. Lack of vitamins, I wa \u2014",
        "Q: So were you able \u2014 I mean, were \u2014 were you able to leave because your father\nwas a military officer?",
        "A: No, it \u2014 it\u2019s just that we were able to li\u2014 leave because we were lucky.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "A: Really.",
        "Q: So it wa \u2014 it \u2014 his \u2014 that he was in the military had nothing to do with it.",
        "A: No, nothing whatsoever, no, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Well, the worst really was for the so-called minorities, because from day one,\nJews were considered to be citizens of \u2014 of Russia. They \u2014 Russians were their\nsaviors. So it was very difficult at times to \u2014 for a Jew \u2014 Polish Jew \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.\n104January 30, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 to emi \u2014 to go \u2014 get out of ru \u2014 Soviet Union, I\u2019m sorry, with us, you know.",
        "Q: So because \u2014 okay, because they weren\u2019t considered Polish citizens.",
        "A: Correct. They \u2014 they were deported to be saved by the Russians. Well, anyway,\nso then, after everything was being liquidated, the rast \u2014 last group of the soldiers,\nand of \u2014 very many were very sick, you know, as I say. Well, once you start eating,\nand you were starved so many years. So we then, from yangilu \u2014 Yangiyul, go to\nsomething called Krasnovodsk, which was on the cas \u2014 port on the Caspian Sea.\nAnd on \u2014 with the last transport from Russia, we escape. Again, you have to leave\neverything on the ground. By then it\u2019s very hot, and we are from very cold north.\nNo shoes, so now the feet are absolutely suffering because it\u2019s so hot. But anyway,\nto the very end, we are not sure that we\u2019ll get on that ship. The ship was overloaded,\neverybody was sick on the ship, and we crossed the Caspian Sea to what used to be\ncalled Pahlavi, for the shah of Pahlavi, now it\u2019s a different name, because \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, I want to interrupt right here. You mentioned before that for minorities;\nand you gave us an example; Jews who were from Poland who were deported, had\ndifficulties leaving. Did you know, or did you see any Jewish people who were in\nyour wagon, or in the \u2014 or in Peschanka, [| think it was that you \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: We \u2014 did you know of \u2014 of such families, or such individuals who would \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: I only knew of one. I wouldn\u2019t recognize a Jew from non-Jew, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I knew of one Jewish person, and she was with us almost throughout this \u2014\nthis experience. She was a \u2014 a wife of a Polish major.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And she had two sons. And they \u2014 of course, again, she \u2014 she was left with us, I\ndon\u2019t know where she was in pa \u2014 Semipalatinsk, I \u2014 maybe she even lived with\nthem, I don\u2019t remember. But anyway, sh-she \u2014 but she, perhaps because she was\nmarried to a Polish military man, it was easier for her. And no, she didn\u2019t regard\nherself maybe as \u2014 as a Jew.",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "A: Yes, Maria Kuska(ph).",
        "Q: Maria Kuska(ph).",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And her two sons had been deported with her?",
        "A: Yes. Yeah.",
        "Q: And they had gone to the same pig farm?",
        "A: No, a\u2014I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t remember them from the pig farm.",
        "Q: Okay, you remember them in Semipalatinsk.\n106January 30, 2015",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then they were very nice to me, because they \u2014 they \u2014 then tha \u2014 joined the\nPolish army, so we reconnected with everybody in Teheran, and of course they \u2014 I\nwas small, and ti \u2014",
        "Q: And everybody liked you.",
        "A: \u2014 so they \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: Everybody liked you, yeah.",
        "A: They took me for \u2014 for ice cream, and they were already in the army, so they had\nmoney, you know.",
        "Q: So \u2014 okay, so let\u2019s go back to the ship. You say it was overcrowded?",
        "A: Oh yes. That was a nightmare, really. So, we are on the ship, and I don\u2019t know\nhow long it took to cross to Pahlavi. We cross in Pahlavi and we are just down t \u2014\non the beach.",
        "Q: Shore, mm-hm.",
        "A: And there 1s trans \u2014 transit ca-camp, really, in Pahlavi, because I \u2014 all the\ntransport were coming. Not all. I\u2014 I should \u2014I should not say it because some\npeople went o-ov-over land, to Isfahan, which 1s another \u2014 I think Adamchik(ph)\nwent that way, but I wouldn\u2019t bet. Yeah, I think Adamchik(ph) went that way. But\n107January 30, 2015\nanyway, SO we just are dumped in that transit camp, and dysentery is everywhere. I\n\u2014 and there are \u2014 there is nothing but sort of walls made of like reeds, or whatever.\nWe were not there too long, and then we were put \u2014 maybe because we were almost\nthe last coming out of the \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember \u2014 did you leave in which month in the summer of \u201942?",
        "A: I think it was August, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I can go to my diary. No, I am joking.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: So-",
        "Q: Oh, and excuse me, you had said you had to leave everything behind, but you\nhad your little suitcase.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: So you could take your suitcase with you.",
        "A: I definitely carried it all. I\u2014 don\u2019t ask me how. I have it still.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: Is na \u2014 wasn\u2019t probably nothing in it. But you know, rings, and all that \u2014 if any \u2014\nbut, of course, nothing was by then left. But if you ha \u2014 even had a pillow, you had\nto le-leave it on there.\n108January 30, 2015",
        "Q: Okay. And the reason for that?",
        "A: I think one of the reasons [indecipherable] thinking now, was that in order to \u2014\nto fit the \u2014 all the people that were trying to be on that ship, you had \u2014 y-y-you\ncould not \u2014 y \u2014 th-the less you took, the more people \u2014",
        "Q: Could go.",
        "A: \u2014 could go.",
        "Q: I see. I see. Okay. So, you\u2019re in Pahlavi, and then from there what happens?",
        "A: On buses we are take \u2014 we are \u2014 we drive through the Iranian mountains, very\nsteep precipices, you know, one or two buses fell down.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Really, yeah, really. A-And very na \u2014 well, you know, when they \u2014 in the\nmountains it\u2019s very dangerous, you know, it \u2014 to be on the mountain. But anyway,\nSO we arrive in Teheran, and we are put in camp number one, which has nothing,\nyou know, just a piece of land, very dry, hot. And there is \u2014 was a building which\nwas a hospital, because many people right away \u2014 a very primitive hospital, but a\nbuilding. So, we are in camp number one, and I don\u2019t know, there were about three\nor four camps. And \u2014",
        "Q: So you were on the outskirts of Teheran?\n109\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes, no, not Teheran itself, no. And there are many other camps\naround Teheran, mainly of military camps. Indian \u2014 the Sikhs, the Gurkhas, I\nmean al-all \u2014 almost every country was re \u2014 military was presented militarily\naround there. But th-this was a refugee camp. So there \u2014 there\u2019s nothing at first, and\nslowly they build again, like a platform where we just sit and I \u2014 the w \u2014 the \u2014 they\nthen give us \u2014 they carry food in pails to us, you know, and it\u2019s all \u2014 usually it was\nsomething with rice, you know. But oh \u2014 I all \u2014 we always have this food on mind.\nWhen I look \u2014",
        "Q: You're still hungry. At that point you\u2019re still hungry.",
        "A: Well, we all \u2014 yeah, I mean, food was some sort of an obsession. I \u2014 I mean, the\nfact that maybe one had food, one wanted more, I don\u2019t know. But anyways \u2014",
        "Q: Hunger.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Hunger.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Would do it.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. So \u2014 a-and of course, schools are already set \u2014 Poli \u2014 Polish\ngovernment in exile again, I mean, I don\u2019t know how they did it, but they set up\nschools right there. I was two years behind, so they \u2014 I have to study faster, but we\n110January 30, 2015\nsit on \u2014 literally on the ground, studying. We have teachers, we don\u2019t have any\nbooks, but we \u2014 we slowly start schooling again.",
        "Q: Did you write between the line now?",
        "A: Yes. No, there were no lines.",
        "Q: There were no lines any more.",
        "A: None, no, no. But I wrote in my diary.",
        "Q: So you started writing a diary?",
        "A: Oh yes, I started writing the diary in the camp.",
        "Q: And you were how year \u2014 how many years old there?",
        "A: Ten.",
        "Q: You were 10 years old?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did you have the idea by yourself, or did somebody suggest it to you?",
        "A: Nobody suggested it to me.",
        "Q: What are the things that you wrote in that diary? Do you remember?",
        "A: Today I\u2014 I am \u2014I am very mad, because they not only looked for lice at \u2014 when\nI was at school, but when I came to my barracks. That was what. And today was a\ngreat dinner, because we ate so much. And then I wrote about the people that w \u2014\nthat we lived with on this platform first, and then they build barracks. So \u2014 but the\n111January 30, 2015\nworst part for me, and for many children, because we \u2014 there was something called\nEgyptian eye infection.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Oh, the headache was splitting, the eyes were puffed up, filled with \u2014",
        "Q: Mucus?",
        "A: \u2014 pus, yeah.",
        "Q: Pus, mm-hm.",
        "A: And you couldn\u2019t open them, and then they would, of course, try to \u2014 to finish\nthat infection and they would line us up outside in this heat, dry heat, and with the\nsand or soil just in \u2014 in the air, and you stood there, and they would give you, you\nknow, drops into the eyes. It was \u2014 it was excruciating. And one time, we still were\non these plat \u2014 there was no cover, of any sort. And the toilet facilities were\nsomething else. No, ju-just a hole, a huge, long hole dug in the ground, with planks\nput over it, you know. Nothing else. And one night, you know, I \u2014 I endlessly\nprobably cried, because you couldn\u2019t open eyes, so my mother takes me to that \u2014 I\nneed to go, she takes me there, and I fell inside. It was horrible. Because you \u2014 you\ndon\u2019t have any facilities to wash yourself.",
        "Q: Oh yeah, yeah.\n112January 30, 2015",
        "A: She \u2014 I don\u2019t know how she \u2014 but it \u2014 well, it \u2014 1t was cured, you know, but it\nwas one of the horrific pains. But anyway \u2014 so, the school started in that camp, you\nknow, and we slow \u2014 slowly started.",
        "Q: How was your mother\u2019s health, now that she was in a \u2014",
        "A: Well, she again was \u2014 she again was hospitalized in that building, I remember,\nthat was the only building, because she had heart problems, no question.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And in this camp, were you able to inquire about your father and where\nhe might be?",
        "A: No, not yet.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It wa \u2014 came later.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t know if he was dead or alive?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t know where he was.",
        "Q: Okay. How long did you stay there?",
        "A: In that camp? Let me see. I would say, no \u2014 not very long, about maybe six\nmonths. Because Mother then got a position at this Polish military headquarters\nwhere she went around the camps, doling out money to the wives of officers. And \u2014",
        "Q: Like she was. She was a wife of an officer.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yeah.\n113\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "Q: Okay. So this would have been, let\u2019s say, in the winter of \u201943, if you were there\nfor \u2014",
        "A: Correct, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, about half a year, so winter, spring, \u201943.",
        "A: Correct, right. So we moved, since Mother gets the job, and so did Marisha(ph).\nWe moved to \u2014 on \u2014 in \u2014 1n a room in a home of a Persian \u2014 it \u2014 Iranians.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The home \u2014 the home 1s on \u2014 and there are just a few homes, and in the middle\nthere is a little pool. It-It\u2019s like a inya \u2014",
        "Q: Courtyard?",
        "A: Courtyard, yeah. That \u2014 that was \u2014",
        "Q: Sounds pretty.",
        "A: \u2014 usually [indecipherable]. Very pretty, but 1t was very small. Oh yes, very\npretty, but \u2014 so, we move there, and \u2014",
        "Q: This is still Teheran?",
        "A: Yes, Teheran. And the la-landlady lost her husband, we are told, because a\nPolish Jewish lady sto-stole him from \u2014 but, she had the brother who \u2014 who was \u2014\nthey were Muslims. He was an extremist. On \u2014 on the holiday of Ramadan, he\nwould go and beat himself with chains and so on. But, she had a cat, which I liked.\n114\nJanuary 30, 2015",

        "Q: Oh, oh wow.",
        "A: Which I did. So, from time to time then, in my diary I write, today, mean Iranian\ngirls pulled my hair and so on. But overall, Azar(ph) was very good, and Azar(ph)\nwrote in my memory book, or whatever it\u2019s called, in Farsi. I tried to have it\ntranslated. It was translated once correctly, and then Adamchik(ph) lost it.",
        "Q: Oh, the translation?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Because he wanted to see it. But so, it\u2019s something in there, since you know,\nflowers fade, but words stay, and maybe a hundred years from now they\u2019 LI still live.\nSomething like that.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a lovely thought.\n115\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Very lovely, yeah.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: But did you see lots of different kinds of officials and vehicles, and things like\nthat?",
        "A: No, you know, because it was very deep inside some gar \u2014 this\n[indecipherable]. No, but we knew it was there.",
        "Q: Okay. And you knew they were there.",
        "A: Yes. So, in Teheran, Marisha(ph) loved to go to the movies, so we \u2014\nMarisha(ph) and I would go to American movies, where American edwa \u2014 soldiers\nwould look and offer us once gum, and we didn\u2019t know what tha \u2014 to do with\nchewing gum. And in Teheran, the ice cream, the Iranian ice cream, I think it was\nmaybe \u2014 wasn\u2019t it invented, sorbet and ice cr \u2014 invented? Excellent ice cream, so we\nate that. And of course, again we were fixated on food. So it was \u2014 and we didn\u2019t\nhave that much money. So I remember, you know, in this street, Lazar(ph), there\nwas some club or something, where the American soldiers were going boogie-\nwoogie. Really. And then they would come out, which was even worse for me, they\nwould have this white bun with lots of ham in it. And I said to myself, if I could\nonly have half of it.",

In the meantime, the British let criminals\nout of the prisons, and there comes a Muslim \u2014 in that village, I must say, there are\ntwo so-called muftis, one \u2014 or leaders, one is Muslim, and one is Christian in this\nvillage where \u2014 Ei-Ein Karem. It\u2019s on \u2014 I remember it well, because it was \u2014",

And we are sitting \u2014 I mean, consider is no electricity,\nso sit and enjoys \u2014 well, enjoys life maybe better because of it. But anyway \u2014 and\nall of a sudden we hear a shot. This criminal, Muslim criminal that was let out of\nprison, killed the mu \u2014 Christian mufti. From then on there was chaos in the village,\n128January 30, 2015\nand again there was endlessly alarmed that the Jews are coming, when Jews aren\u2019t \u2014\nwere not coming. Very few Poles left. My bri \u2014 English teacher was still there. He\nwas from \u2014 Polish American from Pittsburgh, I think. So he saw there was strength\nto negotiate for the whole group, there were maybe about 50 of us left, just women\nwith children. And the school closed in \u201947, only half a year, you know, of\nschooling, because the war \u2014 this was going on, shoot \u2014 shootouts were going on.\nSo, in Ein Karem also, there was a \u2014 a \u2014 it\u2019s like in a valley, there was a mountain\non which there was \u2014 it was called Moscow B, where the Russian nuns resided\nsince Tsarists time. They had their little houses, their little church. And of course\nthey \u2014 th-the Muslim Arabs really, were accusing them of again giving signals to\nthe Jews, you know, just too totally ridiculous. But anyway, we were used to go\naround the village, and nobody bothered us, but when we \u2014 we would now go, and\none of us had eyeglasses, these Muslim are \u2014 I don\u2019t know where they even came\nfrom, but anyway, they \u2014 they would \u2014 right away would ask us if we are Jews.\nYehudi, Yehudi? Becau \u2014 and there were guns, you know. Because you had\neyeglasses, you know, things like that. But anyway, so we were pressured to \u2014 to \u2014\nto be repatriated to Poland, Mother then stopped us, really insisted that we cannot\ndo it, so about 50 of us, women with children, through this \u2014 in a red \u2014 Red Cross \u2014\nreally with Red Cross signs, go, during the shootouts from \u2014 we are driven to\n129January 30, 2015\nLebanon, where there are still schools, or maybe one left. Were tall like that one\nyou see.",

        "A: Yeah, well, they didn\u2019t know where to take us. We were in Lebanon then, not \u2014\nI shouldn\u2019t say we, but Mother was pressured to emigrate to Australia because\nAustralia was filled with men, but no women. And final \u2014 and my mother, we\nknew in that, then we would never be reunited with my father because Australia\nwas not accepting men that were over 50, my father was 51.

There were\nprofessors from a university even in Wilno that were teaching us, you know. So, we\ngo to England on a ship, in 40 \u2014 oh no, now it\u2019s \u201949, 49.",

So then Mother and I go to join my father in\nGermany, and after 12 years it was really \u2014 I mean, I can\u2019t say it\u2019s a shock, but it\nwas like meeting a stranger, you know, there was this small station in Wentorf, was\nthe name of the town, German town. We get off the bus, and there is this man, we\ndon\u2019t know what to do with him, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.\n134January 30, 2015",
        "A: So, but anyway, you know, it \u2014 after 12 years it\u2019s tough for anybody to get\nanywhere together, but \u2014 but we did. It worked out, to a point. But anyway, so then,\nwe \u2014 we are 1n a transit camp in \u2014",
        "Q: Together.",
        "A: \u2014 Wentorf, and of course, you have to go through numerous interrogations\nagain. Not only interroga \u2014 physical examinations, everything. It took a month, or a\nmonth and a half, you know, and the \u2014 you do help in the camp, which is fine. And I\n\u2014 the \u2014 finally we are put in front of the American representative, I think equivalent\nto a consul \u2014 you know, coun \u2014 someone from the American consulate, on the\ngrounds of the camp. And finally he said yes, but it\u2019s still not certain that U.S.\nwants to accept us because my mother has a heart problem, so how are we going to\nsupport ourselves? So, we said, well, we both will work mad \u2014 I and \u2014 and my\nfather. So finally 1t\u2014 we are accepted, and we then leave our \u2014 our \u2014 how many\nmonths later we left, I don\u2019t know, about two, three months, through all this. And\nwe leave from Bremenhaven(ph).",
        "Q: Bremerhaven.",
        "A: Right. On a ship called the General Macrae(ph) with other refugees from other\ncountries too; Latvia, you know, and Estonia even \u2014 Lithuania I didn\u2019t, but Latvia\nI remember, a very nice couple. So then we \u2014 it\u2019s October, the seas were rough, but\n135January 30, 2015\nwe somehow made it, and we arrive in New York, and we very quickly then, within\nhours, get on a train, and arrive in Chicago, Dearborn station, which nonexistent.\nThey preserve the building, but that\u2019s \u2014 I think it\u2019s like a shopping mall there. But \u2014\nso we then stay with our sponsors and literally the next day, Father goes to work at\nCherriads\u2019(ph) lumber company, although he doesn\u2019t know how to be a carpenter,\nor whatever it\u2019s on \u2014 and I go to to work for Butler\u2019s Specialty company, where\nthere is the mean owner, not \u2014 I \u2014 I mean, he \u2014 he \u2014 he thought I was scum, but he\nalso was very mean, I remember, because he was \u2014 I was not used for \u2014 to people\nwho were really disrespectful to elders. And this guy, I find out, is \u2014 is just awful to\nhis uncle who is an old Jew \u2014 these were Jewish people \u2014 I mean, he was awful. But\nanyway, so I work there, and in the meantime, the my \u2014 the director of our school in\nEngland keeps writing, continue studying, because I studied quite well, you know.\nSo I am \u2014 I try to look, but you are lost, you are the only one, you know. I work in\nthis factory, on an assembly line, and I \u2014 as I am closing the boxes, I am reciting\nPolish poetry. But I met very nice Mexican girl there, but the Polish ladies were\nsaying, why do you want to study, you know, it\u2019s the \u2014 you know, just keep\nworking, you know. So I was sort of a black sheep, because I wanted to study. So I\nstart \u2014 this Polish director from the Polish school, Dr. Falinski(ph) sends me to\nsome priest, who wants to put me in the high school, and I don\u2019t need to go to the\n136January 30, 2015\nhigh school any more. And then he also tells me well, there is a mission in Africa,\nmaybe you like [indecipherable]. No. So then wa \u2014 sends to another Polish\norganization which they tell me, why don\u2019t you learn to type. That\u2019s it, you know.\nAnd I said \u2014 I said to myself, well, I can learn how to type at home\n[indecipherable]. But anyway, so we stay for a short time already, with the\nsponsors. I work at Butler\u2019s Specialty company. And then we find a room. Again,\nit\u2019s all very near to the U.S. Steel Corporation, you know, where many Poles lived,\nand there was a Polish kind of a community there, on the south side, which is\nunlike, you know, the Polish [indecipherable]. So, the landlady\u2019s name is\nPiney(ph) Biernatska(ph), and she\u2019s just a\u2014 she le-learned how to write and read\nby herself. Her husband died very early because he worked in the steel mills. The\nair was polluted like heck there, you know, because of dust, in that time, you know.\nIt\u2019s amazing what happened since. So then I se \u2014 I \u2014 Tolek(ph) \u2014",
        "Q: Your friend from Lebanon.",
        "A: Lebanon, and a guy with whom I was in the same classroom, start writing to me\n\u2014 they were in Baltimore somewhere \u2014 and saying well, you know, you have to \u2014\nyou should apply directly to a university because you know, they were at Johns\nHopkins already, and they accept our matriculation, which was a surprise because it\nwas \u2014 but anyway, so okay, okay, so I\u2019m sitting, working at the factory, then I get a\n137January 30, 2015\nbetter job.

But anyway, I come back,\nand again \u2014 I one time, because we shared the bathroom with our landlady, and\nlandlady had two si \u2014 by then one married son, and two unmarried ones, and one\nstill lived with her. And I\u2019m 1n that bathroom, I am sorry to tell you, and I am\nlooking into the wastepaper basket, and I find a \u2014 a bulletin from Illinois Institute\nof Technology. And I don\u2019t know any better, but I look and I say, this is near.\nBecause my zip is 17, and IIT is 16. It wasn\u2019t near. In the meantime, Tolek(ph), he\nsays well, try it. We, of course, don\u2019t have the telephone. I use somebody else\u2019s\ntelephone. And I then meet the dean of the evening school, it was called. And yes,\nhe said, yeah. Oh, they know about po \u2014 our Polish schools in exile. And I started\nthen \u2014 very soon I \u2014 I worked, but I then after work from Wilson and company went\nto the evening school at WT.

        "Q: Okay. A question that\u2019s a little bit delicate. In some ways, did you lose your\nfather when he left for Romania, and \u2014 in 1939, and you didn\u2019t see him for 12\nyears?",
        "A: I think so, yes, I think so. But it didn\u2019t stop me from sort of really wanting to\nfind him, to have him. That\u2019s very true. He was a very bitter man towards the end,\nafter we arrived here. Very bitter, very bitter.",

And we then \u2014 that was very interesting, because we stood a long time at the\nborder between East and West Germany, and there were the Russian soldiers with\ntheir little red stars. And s \u2014 but then, after we crossed the border, going through\nEast Germany, they would \u2014 they had stopped the bus once again, the East German\nsoldiers, with machine guns, you know, how much money you have? And you went\nthrough East Germany, and really, this was a depressing view, again. Just\ndepressing. So then, we arrive rather late on the border between East Germany and\n142January 30, 2015\nPoland, and these were everyb \u2014 those women, everybody that was there, you\nknow, they ha \u2014 they bought lots \u2014 they said, oh no, they\u2019ll stop us, and then look\nthrough all of this.

Because all of a sudden you \u2014 you \u2014 you really saw \u2014 and the ba \u2014 I\nmust say that compared to the East German soldiers, these Polish soldiers were so\nnice, you know. Elegant. And all of a sudden, there was a storm coming, and I \u2014\nthere were farmers, you know, in the \u2014 and they were speaking \u2014 I her \u2014 we heard\nthem, you know, speaking Polish.

        "A: Yeah, was very, very strange that nobod \u2014 but yeah, they would follow you on\nthe streets at that time still. The second time when I went, I didn\u2019t feel that anybody\nwas following me. I did register, but it was a nothing \u2014 1970s, late 1970s. The\nsecond time I went because my \u2014 my one cousin I wa \u2014 th-the letters that were\ncoming were rather strange, that he was jailed, and so on. That was my uncle\u2019s two\nsons, so it was again a very strange, because one was in the army, and obviously\nsold himself just to make his living [indecipherable]. And the other one, I \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow what was the matter, but he was in jail. So I thought of helping. We \u2014 we\nhelped \u2014",

But anyway, so he served in the German army, and then he\nserved \u2014 he \u2014 not served, but then the \u2014 in the western Poland, in Poznan, around\nPoznan, his brother and he were involved in the uprising against the Germans, or\nthe Pr-Prussia. And so he fought in that, and then of course, after the Po-Poland\nbecame free, he was \u2014 he m \u2014 went to \u2014 I won\u2019t say it\u2019s equivalent to West Point,\nbut it was a little bit less than that. I\u2014 I \u2014 I would say a military junior college, I\ndon\u2019t know. But he then finished that, and became a professional officer in the\nJanuary 30, 2015\nPolish army, and then when the Bolsheviks attacked Poland, after the 1917\nrevolution, he wen \u2014 he went to fight the Bolsheviks, and he was wounded again.\nBut these wounds were not exactly critical, and so \u2014 so then, he continued really to\nadvance to the \u2014 the ra-rank of cap-captain, and of course then there was \u2014\ntransferred \u2014 as I say, I think I was about two, to eas \u2014 eastern \u2014 southeastern\nPoland.",

        "A: Yes. He wen \u2014 definitely.

The\nweather was \u2014 in summer is very beautiful in that part of Poland. We would go to\nthe river, to the little beach \u2014 at that point in the beach was nothing like it is now,\nwhat I see.

        "A: But in the meantime \u2014 excuse me, I \u2014 I Just want to make a point.",
        "A: That all this I\u2014 also was done because supposedly when the Russians entered,\nthey asked \u2014 they wanted to register everybody, and asked people whether it\u2019s \u2014\nthey were from \u2014 originally from west or east. And of course by then, when we saw\nRussians, my mother, of course, went and registered that she\u2019s from the west. And\neverybody thought that if \u2014 and that\u2019s what they \u2014 the Russians assured us that if\nyou were from the west, you would go back to say, you know [indecipherable] in\nPoznan, where my mother\u2019s family was. But this was a trick. It\u2019s just to get\neverybody on the list, to know who is who, where and how. And then that \u2014 those\nJanuary 30, 2015\nlists were used to deport us to Russia.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: \u2014 again \u2014 again, they came, they pounded on the door, surrounded the house, get\nup, get up. And you know, I grabbed, of course, the dog, and we were put on \u2014 on\nthese carts driven by horses, with again soldiers surrounding it. And we didn\u2019t know\nwhere they would drive us, but they drove us to a small village called Tluszez \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 which means fat.",
        "A: But \u2014 and they put us in one room. There were the pe \u2014 the family of\nZhaglietski(ph) there, th-the ones that escaped Warsaw \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 except \u2014",

        "A: Yes, yes. It\u2019s little. And it was, as a matter of fact, purchased way back in\nVienna, when we went, you know, for \u2014 on a last vacation.\nJanuary 30, 2015",

Oh, by the way, pictures on the\nwalls, and silver \u2014 I remember this one time, even prior we \u2014 th \u2014 prior to when the\nRussians came, there was somebody, and I somehow recall this was a teacher who\nlived down the street. And one night the raincoats were put down on the floor, and\none \u2014 because we didn\u2019t have many valuable, but one valuable painting, and then\nsilver was wrapped in different raincoats, and the guy took it, and buried it in his\nbackyard.

        "A: Like any room. It still had electricity even, I think, as I recall. Yeah.",
        "A: It was on the second floor, so it must have been some two story house. I don\u2019t\nknow who lived on the bottom floor. But it was very cold all the time, and we were\nhungry all the time, because by then there was nothing, and the winter set in. I do\nnot remember \u2014 you ask me about Christmas \u2014 I don\u2019t even \u2014 I don\u2019t remember, I \u2014\nthere was no Christmas.",

A \u2014 I \u2014 the \u2014 my \u2014 my father, who was, as I mentioned,\nhe was outgoing, and he was a very fair man, and he \u2014 you \u2014 minority, so-called\nJanuary 30, 2015\nminorities really, were very much favorably inclined towards him, although\nsometimes military men were not exactly viewed favorably. So, there was another\nhouse where a \u2014 a Ukrainian family lived, in Tluszez. And I also remember that\nthey were very nice to us, and th-that they warned my mother that we will be\ndeported, you know. But what can you do by then?",
        "A: None. None.",
        "A: No, no, no. Well, I \u2014 the feeling all \u2014 always was, you know, he just wants to \u2014\nto stay and live, and you don\u2019t know what the next day will bring. I \u2014 you sort of \u2014\nyou develop that kind of a sense, you know.",
        "A: Not maybe increasingly, but it was the same, just sort of \u2014",

But a \u2014 so y-yo \u2014 she \u2014 she really\nkept us in good spirits. In a way it was \u2014 I don\u2019t know if Mother and I would have\nsurvived without that family.

So on night,\nJanuary 30, 2015\n[indecipherable] was pounding on the door. Very, very cold night, that I\nremember. Extremely cold, snowing and so on. And the \u2014 the Russian soldiers came\nin, and told us [speaks Russian] again, you know, get out, get out. So ya \u2014 you are\nsleeping soundly, and then you are ar-ar-aroused from sleep, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014\neverybody was sort of 1n a daze, and I remember that pi \u2014 Mrs. Zhaglietska(ph),\nwho as I say, had a sense of humor and so on, when \u2014 she was very emotional, too.\nSo she started throwing things at the soldiers. I remember that, you know. So we \u2014\nwe just put whatever we had on ourselves \u2014 and of course I had my suitcase, you\nknow. But the dog, I-I was saying well, the dog has to come with us. But somehow,\nthat \u2014 that Ukrainian ca \u2014 ne \u2014 next door, they\u2019Il take \u2014 they said they\u2019II take care of\nthe dog. So they took the d \u2014 Sotka(ph).",
        "A: And I also remember \u2014 so then they packed us onto these sleighs, horse-drawn,\nextremely cold. And this one Russian sol \u2014 I remember that, he took his coat, or\nwhatever he had on top of his coat, and put it on me, you know, bi \u2014 tha \u2014 tha-that\ntime I think I \u2014 as I recall, I really felt scared.",

        "A: So, by \u2014 it took hours to get to the station, and I don\u2019t know what the station was,\nwhat the name of the town was. But by then it was light, and there were people\nstanding and some of them with bread, and whatever, to give to us. So then they\npacked us in \u2014 into the cattle wagons. And I don\u2019t know how to, again, cause there\nwere \u2014 on both sides of the cattle wagon there were these platforms, I think two of\nthem. And we landed on the uppermost one, and I don\u2019t know how long it took\nthem, but it probably took them a long \u2014 th-the \u2014 a whole day. And then they shut\nthe \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, we did. We did get some food from the people, yes.",

And\nthere are \u2014 then, on the other side, I know there was somebody that was very sick,\nold, because he was right \u2014 right away lying down.

        "A: But 1-1n the s \u2014 in the summer when we were there, the whole steppe, just like\nthe prairie, bloomed beautifully, gr-grass was growing. But I would say it\u2019s very\nsimilar to a prairie, yes, mm-hm.",

        "A: Correct. They \u2014 and they were then taken to collective farms, different collective\nfarms. But before \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I would like to say something else too. As we crossed the\nUral mountains, and then I know we were in a \u2014 well, really \u2014 Siberia really is \u2014 is\njust an imaginary kind of a\u2014 a place.

        "A: Si\u2014 very big town. We were taken to be deloused, because the Russian thought\nthat Poles are really a-absolutely uncivilized, because they don\u2019t have delousing\nstations. So we were \u2014 we were taken t-to \u2014 for a ba \u2014 for a shower, or whatever it\nwas, but it \u2014 to clean ourselves, and to be deloused. And in order to be deloused,\neverything was taken from us and put into, I don\u2019t know, hot ovens, or whatever. So\nthat no matter where \u2014 you had to give everything up, so whoever had anything\nmade out of leather became nothing, because it was shrunken, you know, almost\nburned.

So then \u2014 so, after delousing and a bath,\nwe then proceeded to \u2014 to where \u2014 oh, the \u2014 our wagons were left behind, and the\nrest went elsewhere, I am sure, you know, to other collective farms, and we were\nput on a carts driven then, because that\u2019s Kazakhstan, oxen. And very slowly we\ngot to this collective farm. The \u2014 the village was called Peschanka, and the farm\nwas a sovkhoz which was even higher than a collective farm, it was Soviet\ncollective farm, and it was a \u2014 a \u2014 of the name of Lenin, you know, Lenin\u2019s.",

When\nStalin took over, there were ex-Russian Orthodox priests, and intellectual \u2014 some\nintellectuals \u2014 I don\u2019t know, of course, who was who. But th \u2014 I remember they\nwere standing, and as we got off, they were sort of \u2014 their heads were \u2014 shaking\ntheir heads, saying that we \u2014 we will get used to it.

        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s the attitude, I think to this day. Now they have neechyebol(ph)\nprivyknesh\u2019 for Putin. But anyway \u2014 so, this is how is \u2014 our life started on this\ncollective farm, you know.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: [indecipherable|",
        "A: Not a single word. We just were put a \u2014 and there were other Polish family, off\nthe wagon, or maybe two, three wagons, really, quite a few families. And some\nwere from Zaleszezyki, the same time \u2014 town, but some were not. Nobody told us\nanything, we were all put into a hall, wh-which was a hall in a school. But that\nschool was not really operating, there were no students there, it was ju \u2014 So we were\nfirst put to there. And I frankly don\u2019t remember what \u2014 what we \u2014 whether we were\ngiven anything to eat, or anything of that sort, but I \u2014 th-this was memorable,\nbecause we \u2014 we were put on the ground, you know, because there was nothing,\nJanuary 30, 2015\nwe\u2019re just on the floor, rather. And all of a sudden they showed us a movie with\nJeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yeah, I \u2014 don\u2019t ask me why. So I remember that, and I know that it\nhappened, because I\u2019m \u2014 as I say, on one or two photographs I have, on the back, I\npictured, I think, I know what \u2014 how the costumes were, or whatever. I drew it. So\nno, nobody was telling us anything, and ah \u2014 so that was spring. I remember co \u2014 to\ncontinue living in that place until winter, or maybe the beginning of \u2014 you know,\nwinter starts earlier there. So 1t was maybe no \u2014 I don\u2019t know what month, but it\nwas snowing. And one time it snowed so much, and that \u2014 there \u2014 the \u2014 we couldn\u2019t\nget out, because it\u2019s similar to what\u2019s happening in the east now, or was, anyway.",
        "A: Correct. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Correct, on the east coast. You \u2014 you couldn\u2019t get out, and you sort of looked\ndown and you had to dig yourself out of that of that [indecipherable]. It was\nextremely cold, crowded, and \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014",
        "A: Several months before we were then allotted, or put into a hut that was half dug\nin the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and half outside. It was made of mud, really, with straw in it, for some reason.",
        "A: The place of the name was Peschanka.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. You know, later on I rem \u2014 I probably don\u2019t \u2014 but later on when I started\nwriting \u2014 I started writing in the camp around Teheran. | have diaries, that\u2019s why I\nremember some of this stuff.",
        "A: Pll show you one of them.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Correct. That\u2019s the \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "A: My mother was not working. Everybody else went working, because if you don\u2019t\n\u2014 didn\u2019t work, you didn\u2019t get this bread that\u2019s as \u2014 you would not call bread, but you\nknow, that was all rations. Was like a piece of heavy mud, but it was fa \u2014",
        "A: Hm. No, it was given to us. We didn\u2019t get any money, you know.",
        "A: No. No money was exchanged. And even if we had money, there was nothing to\nbuy anyway. It was all a \u2014 like a barterer economy. You \u2014 we \u2014 in order to \u2014 to\nexchange anything for food, you gave what you had, you know: a coat, gloves that\nwere shrunken, but a \u2014 just a \u2014 one item for another.",
        "A: Material item. So, I did not go to school, but there was a family with us, who\nwere again, teenagers, and they appealed to me because they were teenagers. And\nall of a sudden it just \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 one of them became sort of my teacher, or\nwhatever, and I sort of started writing. I didn\u2019t mind writing on pieces of\nJanuary 30, 2015\neverything, and it was no longer a chore. All of sudden I hated every Russian,\nmaybe. I was very mad at them, at what they were doing to us. I don\u2019t remember\nbeing very frightened, but I was always sort of angry.",
        "A: Correct. She had that \u2014",
        "A: Well, she had the heart problem to begin with. So, it got progressively worse,\nbecause I\u2019m sure she was very much upset, and so on. So, there were, of course,\nexiled Russian doctors in Peschanka too, but they had nothing to give you to help\nyou when you were sick. But they were extremely good doctors. But they were\nexiled like we, because they were doctors, they were enemies of the state again. So,\nthey somehow wrote that my mother didn\u2019t have to work, which was worse,\nbecause then we didn\u2019t get that piece of bread, but the Zhaglietska(ph) family\nshared with us, you know.",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Yes. And one of them, the \u2014 the brother worked as a laborer in \u2014 in some factory\nwith Russian workers. And he \u2014 one time obviously, without knowing how, that\neveryone spied on everyone, said that Polish workers had it much better than the\nRussian workers, and they \u2014 somebody in that factory denounced him. So, of\ncourse, I don\u2019t know how many days after, maybe very soon after, again, soldiers\ncame, surrounded us, and surro \u2014 came into the \u2014 where we were staying, and\nshoved us again together, and took him to the gulag, you know. He was 19. So he\nended \u2014 and the mother went crazy, you know, just crazy. So that he \u2014 he ended up\ni-in the gulag itself, in the prison camps. Fortunately, he survived, but he had many\nstories to tell too, as I recall, after that, because he met such strange and different\npeople, and of course was awful, awful. Worse than on a collective farm.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Because you know, what\u2019s the purpose of communism, right? To\nimprove the workers\u2019 conditions, so \u2014",
        "A: Correct. Yes. But then, the gir \u2014 young woman, Marisha(ph) \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhat she did before, but again, the winter \u2014 after winter, then \u2014 then there was\nJanuary 30, 2015\nspring, but in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in summer, I remember that Marisha(ph) worked in the\npig farm, and then they gave me a job of being her assistant, because you had to sort\nof herd the pigs in the steppes, otherwise they would go, and be \u2014",
        "A: Of course, yeah.",
        "A: So \u2014 but that was a pass, because then we would si \u2014 well, we would really steal\nfrom the pigs. Of course, if you were caught, that was gulag again, but fortunately \u2014",
        "A: Well, the pigs ate something which 1s called makukhay(ph), and it was what the\npigs were eating, and they even \u2014 even ha-had some milk, which we never saw. And\nthat we didn\u2019t steal, because you couldn\u2019t take it with you. But makukhay(ph) is a\nsunflower from which the oil, sunflower oil \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 1s pressed out, and it\u2019s sort of smooshed together, and it\u2019s rather hard, but you\nknow, is given to the pigs, and we ate that. So that was a plus, in a way, because\nthere were some \u2014 some vitamins 1n it, I imagine, you know.",
        "A: For the \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Mm-hm, right.",
        "A: Whatever we found, yes. We sometimes also ate what grew in the steppes, like, I\ndon\u2019t know, grass that was sort of tasty.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, I have no idea.",
        "A: Many.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No. I\u2014 no, they were taken somewhere, and of course, sold to the elite. You\nknow, Moscow, Leningrad, or whatever \u2014 Stalingrad, rather, you know, and\neverywhere.",
        "A: No, not a single piece of meat, no.",
        "A: No meat. There were some cows around. I don\u2019t remember drinking milk.\nBasically it was da \u2014 the \u2014 th-that bread, and what we could steal. Some people\nworked digging \u2014 digging out potatoes, and they would steal potatoes by putting\nthem \u2014 you know, you had a coat, and you put it in between. So they \u2014 some people\nwere very heavy with that, but y-you were \u2014 had to be very careful, because that\nmeant again, gulag, if you were caught.",
        "A: But again, the Russians did not have it better, you know?",
        "A: Except they ate maybe a li \u2014 they ate better, because they probably here and\nthere had the garden, I don\u2019t remember now.",
        "A: Zhaglietska(ph) family.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Zbishu(ph) Zbigniew.",
        "A: Like Zb",
        "A: Correct. Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s wha-what she did, but mo-mo-mostly, she endless \u2014 spent endless\nday \u2014 days being interrogated by \u2014 by the secret police in that vi \u2014 stupid village,\nyou know.",
        "A: Oh yes, endlessly. Endlessly asking her wh-wh-where is my father, and that\nshe\u2019s spying. I mean, you couldn\u2019t do anything there, but \u2014 but so, she would go,\nand I never knew that she would be coming back. And of course, one time she was\neven denounced, again by a\u2014 an elderly woman who had a \u2014 a daughter, and the \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015\nthat daughter was sickly, so she did it for an egg, because she thought that the\ndaughter\u2019s sickness, which was \u2014 I think she had TB, but I don\u2019t remember now \u2014\nthat eggs will help her. I remember her taking the egg, taking the eggshell, and\ncrushing it, and giving it to that \u2014 you know, with the egg, because she thought, you\nknow, that consuming the eggshell would help her. So \u2014",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it \u2014 1t was obvious, because she would \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I wa \u2014 didn\u2019t do\n\u2014 didn\u2019t look at it that way. I only saw the egg, and then the \u2014 I \u2014 you know, what \u2014\nwhat was said among us, that she was spying on us.",
        "A: On everybody, not only on my mother, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, of cour \u2014 yes, yeah. An elderly woman, and it wa \u2014 she was from\nZaleszezyki too, with her \u2014 she was deported with her daughter, and a little\ngrandson.",
        "A: Oh \u2014 oh yes, yeah. But somehow \u2014 later on we met in Teheran with this family,\nand it \u2014 we became reconciled. We did not feel any \u2014 because we knew \u2014 y-you\nJanuary 30, 2015\nknow, people, I \u2014 I guess, react strangely, you know, and the \u2014 we are hungry, or we\nare desperate to save your own child. They emigrated to South Africa then.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: From Teheran, yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes. That wa \u2014 that \u2014 I \u2014 the two had n-no connection.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: She was, and th-this is \u2014 th-this was tough for \u2014 for me in that time. So \u2014 because\nI would wait, and I never \u2014 and it was endlessly she would be called, and I \u2014 it was\nfutile, I mean, just think of it. In the middle of nowhere, wha-what is she doing se \u2014\nwhat is she sending, anyway? You couldn\u2019t do anything.",
        "A: There was no electricity, no radios, no nothing.",

        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s a nice system.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s true. I \u2014 this is why I \u2014 as I mentioned before, I think \u2014 I mean,\nunfortunate as it was for them to be deported with us, the Zhaglietski(ph) \u2014\nespecially the mother Zhaglietski(ph) \u2014 Zhaglietska(ph) had me \u2014 ha-had us both\nreally. Me.",
        "A: Ah, yes, yeah, I would, but I don\u2019t remember that I ever really complained about\nanything to anybody. I was always angry at the Russians.",
        "A: Yes, but I\u2014 well, for a while that dropped off, thinking oh, poor people, they \u2014\nbecause we knew that they suffered too. But after they won so-called freedom with\nGorbachev and so on, the Perestroika, I said well, great, they will be on the way\nJanuary 30, 2015\nnow, let\u2019s see. And look what\u2019s happening. It \u2014 it\u2019s really \u2014 it seems to be in the\nRussians\u2019 character to \u2014 to have some \u2014 to \u2014 to like to be dictated, and be enslaved,\nreally, you know. I mean, we \u2014 they have a dictator now, and for the sake of the\ngreat Russia \u2014 they love their country, they love their piece of land, but th-they \u2014\nsomebody said that the Russians are \u2014 are \u2014 are good friends, but bad citizens, and I\nthink that\u2019s true.",
        "A: So when, as I mentioned, which is very interesting, there were German co-\ncolonies, or really collective farms, because apparently, when the communism\nthrived in the \u2014 Russia \u2014 or thrived maybe it is bad word \u2014 some Germans\nemigrated, really, to Russia, and they were put on collective farms, and those farms\nwhen \u2014 were run better than the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 So-Soviet \u2014 Soviet farms. So, since Mother knew German, in order to get\nanything again \u2014 not for money, but for a piece \u2014 say, a good tooth, or whatever, she\nwould go and once she brought honey, I \u2014 I \u2014 I remember. So the \u2014 the \u2014 we lived,\nand we \u2014 we tried to \u2014 to \u2014 to really eat as well as we could, here and there, you\nknow, not to starve. I know I was sick. I don\u2019t know if I had scarlet fever, which is\nnow very \u2014 or \u2014 or something else, but I was very sick once in Russia, but not \u2014 not\nJanuary 30, 2015\n\u2014 not very sick otherwise. And so I \u2014 I and Marisha(ph) worked with the pigs, and\nwe didn\u2019t know what to expect. And wh-when winter came you really \u2014 I mean, our\nbreath would freeze. We would be unable, or even don\u2019t want to go outside,\nbecause \u2014",
        "A: Correct. 1941? Yes. So we all, in 1941 then, in June, all of a sudden the news\ncame \u2014 and of course there were no radios, there were just loudspeakers sometimes,\nbut that was not announced during \u2014 by a loud speaker. Somebody came in June\n41, and told us that the Germans attacked Russia. So everybody was ecstatic about\nit, people were happy, including the Russians that were there. Because finally the\nStalin era will perhaps be finished, you know. And I don\u2019t know how, but \u2014 how\nwe got the news that the Polish government in exile in Great Britain started\nnegotiations already, talks through the \u2014 the British officials, with Stalin, or\nwhoever was th \u2014 one of the other henchmen in Russia, they started looking for the\ndeported Poles, you know, and especially officers, you know, so \u2014 so \u2014",
        "A: No. No, no.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: I wanted to ask something else: aside from how you were greeted by these\nRussian exiles, who said you will get used to it, you will get used to it \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: There was not much talking with them, because my \u2014 very few people spo-spoke\nRussian, and there was not much talking with them. And as far as me as a child is\nconcerned, I did play with chi \u2014 Russian children, you know. And there were two\nboys, and the father was in charge of some sort of a \u2014 like a lumberyard, I\nremember. So \u2014 but there was not much of a contact otherwise. No, and there was\nno \u2014 no \u2014 no \u2014 you e \u2014 I think that perhaps nobody was discussing anything with\neach other because everybody was afraid of everybody, you know. You could go \u2014",

        "A: Yes, yeah. I don\u2019t remember anyone \u2014 I then heard later on that there was\nsomebody else, but I don\u2019t even know if it was in our \u2014 on our collective farm, that\nwas like that. But there were people that were trying to save their own lives, and\ndenouncing others.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No. They some \u2014 they threw me off of that.",
        "A: Probably. No, I hope they didn\u2019t know about.",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: No.",
        "A: All of us \u2014 all \u2014 yeah \u2014 I don\u2019t remember that that month she was or \u2014 you know,\nwhat month it\u2019s ended, or whatever \u2014 her interrogations or whatever they \u2014 you\nknow. Really, intimidation and harassment, you know. But what \u2014 after that \u2014 that\nwas announced that \u2014 it was announced that we have amnesty, that we can move\nfreely through Russia. Well, now \u2014 now, think of it. You are in the middle of\nnowhere, and you are going to move freely in Russia. So all the Poles \u2014 again, I\ndon\u2019t know how we found out all this, but somehow all the Poles tried to get out\nfrom collective farms, which was not easy. They didn\u2019t want to let us go, and of\ncourse they did \u2014 physically it was almost impossible. So I can\u2019t tell you though,\nhow the news that the Polish government was sending emissaries, or representatives\nto try \u2014 trying to find us, I don\u2019t know how we got the news. But Zhaglietskis(ph),\nmy mother, and some other family decided to get out of the sovkhoz \u2014 called\nsovkhoz house and go, move towards a city, and Semipalatinsk was the city.",

        "A: Yes. To exchange. So we somehow got out of Peschanka to a port on a river\nthat\u2019s Irtysh river, because I remember that, getting on a\u2014 some boat. And we then\nproceeded south, to Semipalatinsk, and I also remember that there were \u2014 I\nremember seeing it somehow, in that the German colonists that were before, really\nhighly \u2014 in a way fr \u2014 relatively highly regarded, because they settled in communist\ncountry \u2014\nJanuary 30, 2015",

We landed in Semipalatinsk, where also\nZbishu(ph) who was released from prison, because the amnesty was proclaimed for\nall, found himself there, and found a room with Russia \u2014 Russian couple, and it was\nthe \u2014 so when we first arrived, I'll never forget, we went to see wh-where we were\ngoing to stand \u2014 and again, quite a few Poles living together, but it was in the city,\nJanuary 30, 2015\nand so on. But anyway, that \u2014 the landlady and her husband were eating potatoes\njust covered with butter, I \u2014 I\u2014 I almost fainted right there. Food was always on\none\u2019s mind. But the \u2014 the landlady\u2019s husband was a chef at some cadet school, so he\nwould steal from them. This is how they had lots of food, but they don\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t\nshare it with us. Instead again, we stole from them, because the landlady had in \u2014 in\nher \u2014 like basement, da \u2014 un-under \u2014 dungeon-like area, really. She had like a tall \u2014\ntoasted dark bread. So we si\u2014 we would position guards to see if she was coming,\nand one would go down and steal.",

Nobody knew what happened to the 15,000 Polish officers, you\nJanuary 30, 2015\nknow, nobody knew. So, we then found out that there is a Polish army under the\nBritish \u2014 British are \u2014",

        "A: So we \u2014 we somehow \u2014 we started going south.",
        "A: And it is 1941, already maybe fall.",
        "A: And of course we \u2014 it takes a \u2014 days to get to where supposedly the Polish army\nis being formed. And I \u2014 again, you have to \u2014 the trains are slow, overloaded. You\nwait at stations, you wait at different stations, and lice is all over, all over.",
        "A: Uh-huh. You \u2014 you \u2014 you wait in the station, you s \u2014 you know, it\u2019s crowded,\nand so on. So li\u2014 you \u2014 you open that \u2014 you \u2014 you look \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 a long \u2014 you have sleeves like that, and they are crawl \u2014 marching, you know,\nevery \u2014 marching. But again, the Russians would say, oh, don\u2019t worry. When new\nJanuary 30, 2015\npeople, cleaner people come to the station, the lice with leave you. And do you\nknow that supposedly they did, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I believe, I believe so, but I\u2014 I wouldn\u2019t know it, you know.",
        "A: Yes, I believe so.",
        "A: But I would \u2014 I\u2014 I can\u2019t guarantee it, no.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes. So we get south, and by then it\u2019s b \u2014 the \u2014 almost December.\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: So we get south, and there is nothing but some tents and a few Polish men who\nescaped, or walked \u2014 and people walked thousands of miles. Sa \u2014 some people ca \u2014\nsome \u2014 in some families, mother and father were dead, and th-the eldest child would\ncarry youngest one. So this \u2014 just tragic stories, you will hear them probably. Awful\nstories. But anyway \u2014 so, we arrive and there\u2019s nothing. And when we \u2014 but a few\ntents, and a few men that still don\u2019t have uniforms, nothing.",
        "A: Yangiyul, it was called.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So \u2014 so, there is nothing. Nobody is \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 doing anything. And we were not the only one doing this, but we never \u2014 I not\n\u2014 don\u2019t remember ever meeting anybody else in that place where there was nothing.",
        "A: So we then \u2014 this \u2014 deci \u2014 we decide to go back, because at least we know \u2014 to\nSemipalatinsk.\n100January 30, 2015",
        "A: Because if you didn\u2019t go back, you would end up on another collective farm,\nworse than the one you were probably in, because that is Uzbekistan, you know,\nthere\u2019s not really, I don\u2019t know, sheep.",
        "A: And again, later on I find out that many people just disappeared, because they \u2014\nthey stayed on another collective farm, and that was the end of them, you know. It\u2019s\njust \u2014 just not ba \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, right, right.",
        "A: So we go \u2014 we start going back, which was worse than coming \u2014 going south.",
        "A: Winter is \u2014 1s \u2014 it is \u2014 is there, cold. So when we arrived in Semipalatinsk, I\ndidn\u2019t have any shoes on, and of course, cold, and I \u2014 I\u2014 my feet were frostbitten,\nand they don\u2019t bother me now, but they bothered me England, because we came\nfrom warm climate to ba \u2014 anyway, so there we arrive, and the \u2014 the room was still\nthere, because maybe one of the guys still was there, I don\u2019t remember now.\n101January 30, 2015",
        "A: So we go, and we then \u2014 there is a representative of the Polish government in the\n\u2014 established in Semipalatinsk. And material help comes from U.S. and Great\nBritain, for example, shoes and so on. And again \u2014 but it all takes time. So we then\nstart back to go south in \u2014 in the summer.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Correct, yes.",
        "A: Correct. Yes.",
        "A: Why? In order to escape.\n102January 30, 2015",
        "A: And by now we know that there 1s \u2014 that there \u2014 there are -- Zbishu(ph), the \u2014\nthe Zhaglietski\u2019s(ph) son, already joined the \u2014 I think he was, later on he was in the\nair force, but he went south before us.",
        "A: But of course, there\u2019s no communication, it\u2019s just tha \u2014 with this representative\nhere, that \u2014 tha-that \u2014 so we \u2014 we start going south again. And \u2014",
        "A: Correct. It\u2019s now easier, because it\u2019s summer. But I do remember by then, trains\nfilled with wounded Russian soldiers being transported. I mean, on \u2014 not even under\ncover. There were many wounded. I\u2019m sure they went the \u2014 ended up in gulag later\non. But anyway \u2014 but a \u2014 so we \u2014 when we then arrive in Yangiyul \u2014",
        "A: Correct. There is \u2014 oh, there are tents and there are many Polish civilians there,\nbut \u2014 and the Polish soldiers, th-their rations came from the British army. So they\nshared the food with us, because Stalin didn\u2019t want to give any food to us at all. So\nthey shared the food, and prior to our arrival, there were already two \u2014 two\ntransports out of Russia, over the Caspian Sea to Teheran. So we then end up\nreally closing the camp, and whatever civilians are there \u2014 and again, you know,\n103January 30, 2015\nwhen you arrived in the south, and you started to eat a little bit better, everybody\nwas getting si \u2014 ty-typhoid, dysentery. Lack of vitamins, you know, I was covered\nwith something, I don\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called.",
        "A: Sores, yeah.",
        "A: Oh \u2014 yeah. Lack of vitamins, I wa \u2014",
        "A: No, it \u2014 it\u2019s just that we were able to li\u2014 leave because we were lucky.",
        "A: Really.",
        "A: No, nothing whatsoever, no, no.",
        "A: Well, the worst really was for the so-called minorities, because from day one,\nJews were considered to be citizens of \u2014 of Russia. They \u2014 Russians were their\nsaviors. So it was very difficult at times to \u2014 for a Jew \u2014 Polish Jew \u2014\n104January 30, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 to emi \u2014 to go \u2014 get out of ru \u2014 Soviet Union, I\u2019m sorry, with us, you know.",
        "A: Correct. They \u2014 they were deported to be saved by the Russians. Well, anyway,\nso then, after everything was being liquidated, the rast \u2014 last group of the soldiers,\nand of \u2014 very many were very sick, you know, as I say. Well, once you start eating,\nand you were starved so many years. So we then, from yangilu \u2014 Yangiyul, go to\nsomething called Krasnovodsk, which was on the cas \u2014 port on the Caspian Sea.\nAnd on \u2014 with the last transport from Russia, we escape. Again, you have to leave\neverything on the ground. By then it\u2019s very hot, and we are from very cold north.\nNo shoes, so now the feet are absolutely suffering because it\u2019s so hot. But anyway,\nto the very end, we are not sure that we\u2019ll get on that ship. The ship was overloaded,\neverybody was sick on the ship, and we crossed the Caspian Sea to what used to be\ncalled Pahlavi, for the shah of Pahlavi, now it\u2019s a different name, because \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I only knew of one. I wouldn\u2019t recognize a Jew from non-Jew, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: But I knew of one Jewish person, and she was with us almost throughout this \u2014\nthis experience. She was a \u2014 a wife of a Polish major.",
        "A: And she had two sons. And they \u2014 of course, again, she \u2014 she was left with us, I\ndon\u2019t know where she was in pa \u2014 Semipalatinsk, I \u2014 maybe she even lived with\nthem, I don\u2019t remember. But anyway, sh-she \u2014 but she, perhaps because she was\nmarried to a Polish military man, it was easier for her. And no, she didn\u2019t regard\nherself maybe as \u2014 as a Jew.",
        "A: Yes, Maria Kuska(ph).",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah.",

        "A: Correct.",
        "A: And then they were very nice to me, because they \u2014 they \u2014 then tha \u2014 joined the\nPolish army, so we reconnected with everybody in Teheran, and of course they \u2014 I\nwas small, and ti \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 so they \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: They took me for \u2014 for ice cream, and they were already in the army, so they had\nmoney, you know.",
        "A: Oh yes. That was a nightmare, really. So, we are on the ship, and I don\u2019t know\nhow long it took to cross to Pahlavi. We cross in Pahlavi and we are just down t \u2014\non the beach.",
        "A: And there 1s trans \u2014 transit ca-camp, really, in Pahlavi, because I \u2014 all the\ntransport were coming. Not all. I\u2014 I should \u2014I should not say it because some\npeople went o-ov-over land, to Isfahan, which 1s another \u2014 I think Adamchik(ph)\nwent that way, but I wouldn\u2019t bet. Yeah, I think Adamchik(ph) went that way. But\n107January 30, 2015\nanyway, SO we just are dumped in that transit camp, and dysentery is everywhere. I\n\u2014 and there are \u2014 there is nothing but sort of walls made of like reeds, or whatever.\nWe were not there too long, and then we were put \u2014 maybe because we were almost\nthe last coming out of the \u2014",
        "A: I think it was August, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it.",
        "A: I can go to my diary. No, I am joking.",
        "A: So-",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: I definitely carried it all. I\u2014 don\u2019t ask me how. I have it still.",
        "A: Is na \u2014 wasn\u2019t probably nothing in it. But you know, rings, and all that \u2014 if any \u2014\nbut, of course, nothing was by then left. But if you ha \u2014 even had a pillow, you had\nto le-leave it on there.\n108January 30, 2015",
        "A: I think one of the reasons [indecipherable] thinking now, was that in order to \u2014\nto fit the \u2014 all the people that were trying to be on that ship, you had \u2014 y-y-you\ncould not \u2014 y \u2014 th-the less you took, the more people \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 could go.",
        "A: On buses we are take \u2014 we are \u2014 we drive through the Iranian mountains, very\nsteep precipices, you know, one or two buses fell down.",
        "A: Really, yeah, really. A-And very na \u2014 well, you know, when they \u2014 in the\nmountains it\u2019s very dangerous, you know, it \u2014 to be on the mountain. But anyway,\nSO we arrive in Teheran, and we are put in camp number one, which has nothing,\nyou know, just a piece of land, very dry, hot. And there is \u2014 was a building which\nwas a hospital, because many people right away \u2014 a very primitive hospital, but a\nbuilding. So, we are in camp number one, and I don\u2019t know, there were about three\nor four camps. And \u2014\n109\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes, no, not Teheran itself, no. And there are many other camps\naround Teheran, mainly of military camps. Indian \u2014 the Sikhs, the Gurkhas, I\nmean al-all \u2014 almost every country was re \u2014 military was presented militarily\naround there. But th-this was a refugee camp. So there \u2014 there\u2019s nothing at first, and\nslowly they build again, like a platform where we just sit and I \u2014 the w \u2014 the \u2014 they\nthen give us \u2014 they carry food in pails to us, you know, and it\u2019s all \u2014 usually it was\nsomething with rice, you know. But oh \u2014 I all \u2014 we always have this food on mind.\nWhen I look \u2014",
        "A: Well, we all \u2014 yeah, I mean, food was some sort of an obsession. I \u2014 I mean, the\nfact that maybe one had food, one wanted more, I don\u2019t know. But anyways \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. So \u2014 a-and of course, schools are already set \u2014 Poli \u2014 Polish\ngovernment in exile again, I mean, I don\u2019t know how they did it, but they set up\nschools right there. I was two years behind, so they \u2014 I have to study faster, but we\n110January 30, 2015\nsit on \u2014 literally on the ground, studying. We have teachers, we don\u2019t have any\nbooks, but we \u2014 we slowly start schooling again.",
        "A: Yes. No, there were no lines.",
        "A: None, no, no. But I wrote in my diary.",
        "A: Oh yes, I started writing the diary in the camp.",
        "A: Ten.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Nobody suggested it to me.",
        "A: Today I\u2014 I am \u2014I am very mad, because they not only looked for lice at \u2014 when\nI was at school, but when I came to my barracks. That was what. And today was a\ngreat dinner, because we ate so much. And then I wrote about the people that w \u2014\nthat we lived with on this platform first, and then they build barracks. So \u2014 but the\n111January 30, 2015\nworst part for me, and for many children, because we \u2014 there was something called\nEgyptian eye infection.",
        "A: Oh, the headache was splitting, the eyes were puffed up, filled with \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 pus, yeah.",
        "A: And you couldn\u2019t open them, and then they would, of course, try to \u2014 to finish\nthat infection and they would line us up outside in this heat, dry heat, and with the\nsand or soil just in \u2014 in the air, and you stood there, and they would give you, you\nknow, drops into the eyes. It was \u2014 it was excruciating. And one time, we still were\non these plat \u2014 there was no cover, of any sort. And the toilet facilities were\nsomething else. No, ju-just a hole, a huge, long hole dug in the ground, with planks\nput over it, you know. Nothing else. And one night, you know, I \u2014 I endlessly\nprobably cried, because you couldn\u2019t open eyes, so my mother takes me to that \u2014 I\nneed to go, she takes me there, and I fell inside. It was horrible. Because you \u2014 you\ndon\u2019t have any facilities to wash yourself.\n112January 30, 2015",
        "A: She \u2014 I don\u2019t know how she \u2014 but it \u2014 well, it \u2014 1t was cured, you know, but it\nwas one of the horrific pains. But anyway \u2014 so, the school started in that camp, you\nknow, and we slow \u2014 slowly started.",
        "A: Well, she again was \u2014 she again was hospitalized in that building, I remember,\nthat was the only building, because she had heart problems, no question.",
        "A: No, not yet.",
        "A: It wa \u2014 came later.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t know where he was.",
        "A: In that camp? Let me see. I would say, no \u2014 not very long, about maybe six\nmonths. Because Mother then got a position at this Polish military headquarters\nwhere she went around the camps, doling out money to the wives of officers. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, yeah.\n113\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Correct, yeah.",
        "A: Correct, right. So we moved, since Mother gets the job, and so did Marisha(ph).\nWe moved to \u2014 on \u2014 in \u2014 1n a room in a home of a Persian \u2014 it \u2014 Iranians.",
        "A: The home \u2014 the home 1s on \u2014 and there are just a few homes, and in the middle\nthere is a little pool. It-It\u2019s like a inya \u2014",
        "A: Courtyard, yeah. That \u2014 that was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 usually [indecipherable]. Very pretty, but 1t was very small. Oh yes, very\npretty, but \u2014 so, we move there, and \u2014",
        "A: Yes, Teheran. And the la-landlady lost her husband, we are told, because a\nPolish Jewish lady sto-stole him from \u2014 but, she had the brother who \u2014 who was \u2014\nthey were Muslims. He was an extremist. On \u2014 on the holiday of Ramadan, he\nwould go and beat himself with chains and so on. But, she had a cat, which I liked.\n114\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Yes. And I have a\u2014 even a picture of that cat. And she had a daughter, whose\nname was Azar(ph).",
        "A: And Azar(ph) and I became friends, because we were almost the same age. And\nAzar(ph) and I would go to the bazaar, and I learned Farsi. I did speak Farsi, and I\nknow how to write my name in Farsi.",
        "A: Which I did. So, from time to time then, in my diary I write, today, mean Iranian\ngirls pulled my hair and so on. But overall, Azar(ph) was very good, and Azar(ph)\nwrote in my memory book, or whatever it\u2019s called, in Farsi. I tried to have it\ntranslated. It was translated once correctly, and then Adamchik(ph) lost it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Because he wanted to see it. But so, it\u2019s something in there, since you know,\nflowers fade, but words stay, and maybe a hundred years from now they\u2019 LI still live.\nSomething like that.\n115\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Very lovely, yeah.",
        "A: So \u2014 and so, when we lived in Teheran, there were schools in Teheran, Polish\nschools in Teheran.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So, in Teheran, the \u2014 the Polish school I \u2014 I had to go \u2014 I went to Polish school\nin the city itself. The school was near some huge palace, and park, where at one\ntime, Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin met. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And of \u2014 they were \u2014 we were \u2014 we would go by while they were there.",
        "A: Yes. But we off \u2014 never saw.\n116January 30, 2015",
        "A: No.",

        "A: Yes. So, in Teheran, Marisha(ph) loved to go to the movies, so we \u2014\nMarisha(ph) and I would go to American movies, where American edwa \u2014 soldiers\nwould look and offer us once gum, and we didn\u2019t know what tha \u2014 to do with\nchewing gum. And in Teheran, the ice cream, the Iranian ice cream, I think it was\nmaybe \u2014 wasn\u2019t it invented, sorbet and ice cr \u2014 invented? Excellent ice cream, so we\nate that. And of course, again we were fixated on food. So it was \u2014 and we didn\u2019t\nhave that much money. So I remember, you know, in this street, Lazar(ph), there\nwas some club or something, where the American soldiers were going boogie-\nwoogie. Really. And then they would come out, which was even worse for me, they\nwould have this white bun with lots of ham in it. And I said to myself, if I could\nonly have half of it.\n117\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: That \u2014 the \u2014 Teheran was overrun with every kind of, you know, mili \u2014 because\nshah was \u2014 people were \u2014 even Russians were there, which is military Russians.\nAnd there was the German spy, fifth column sp fi \u2014 fi-fifth \u2014 I mean, German spies\nwere there too.

And we are sitting \u2014 I mean, consider is no electricity,\nso sit and enjoys \u2014 well, enjoys life maybe better because of it. But anyway \u2014 and\nall of a sudden we hear a shot. This criminal, Muslim criminal that was let out of\nprison, killed the mu \u2014 Christian mufti. From then on there was chaos in the village,\n128January 30, 2015\nand again there was endlessly alarmed that the Jews are coming, when Jews aren\u2019t \u2014\nwere not coming. Very few Poles left. My bri \u2014 English teacher was still there. He\nwas from \u2014 Polish American from Pittsburgh, I think. So he saw there was strength\nto negotiate for the whole group, there were maybe about 50 of us left, just women\nwith children. And the school closed in \u201947, only half a year, you know, of\nschooling, because the war \u2014 this was going on, shoot \u2014 shootouts were going on.\nSo, in Ein Karem also, there was a \u2014 a \u2014 it\u2019s like in a valley, there was a mountain\non which there was \u2014 it was called Moscow B, where the Russian nuns resided\nsince Tsarists time. They had their little houses, their little church. And of course\nthey \u2014 th-the Muslim Arabs really, were accusing them of again giving signals to\nthe Jews, you know, just too totally ridiculous. But anyway, we were used to go\naround the village, and nobody bothered us, but when we \u2014 we would now go, and\none of us had eyeglasses, these Muslim are \u2014 I don\u2019t know where they even came\nfrom, but anyway, they \u2014 they would \u2014 right away would ask us if we are Jews.\nYehudi, Yehudi? Becau \u2014 and there were guns, you know. Because you had\neyeglasses, you know, things like that. But anyway, so we were pressured to \u2014 to \u2014\nto be repatriated to Poland, Mother then stopped us, really insisted that we cannot\ndo it, so about 50 of us, women with children, through this \u2014 in a red \u2014 Red Cross \u2014\nreally with Red Cross signs, go, during the shootouts from \u2014 we are driven to\n129January 30, 2015\nLebanon, where there are still schools, or maybe one left. Were tall like that one\nyou see.",
        "A: So, again I had to catch up, because again I was half a year behind in schooling.\nBut then again, Lebanon is beautiful, beautiful. Lebanon \u2014",
        "A: Absolutely, was beautiful and quiet, the Mediterranean Sea, all that. So, we\nwere in Lebanon, and \u2014",

We were in Lebanon then, not \u2014\nI shouldn\u2019t say we, but Mother was pressured to emigrate to Australia because\nAustralia was filled with men, but no women. And final \u2014 and my mother, we\nknew in that, then we would never be reunited with my father because Australia\nwas not accepting men that were over 50, my father was 51.

There were\nprofessors from a university even in Wilno that were teaching us, you know. So, we\ngo to England on a ship, in 40 \u2014 oh no, now it\u2019s \u201949, 49.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. And in England, we end in \u2014 there are so-called hostels, where the\nfamilies of \u2014 well, after the war, as I say, Great Britain accepted \u2014\n131January 30, 2015",

        "A: Oh, it is a\u2014a building that was built for \u2014 during the second World War. It\u2019s sort\nof made of tin, the semi-circle \u2014",

Usually these camps were \u2014 were the flyers,\nespecially American flyers used to live, and then they were give \u2014 just left there, so\nwe occupied them. So after a while, I want to continue, because in Europe we not\nonly have the high school, but we have two more years lytseum(ph) \u2014 lyceum. So \u2014\nand of course, by then you had to also have some British certificate that you did\nsomething in schools.",

And this is when my frozen-bitten f-feet start hurting very much,\nalmost like wounds, you know.

In the\nmeantime, my mother was corresponding to \u2014 with my father, and he then wrote,\nyou know, that we \u2014 he has a sponsor in the U.S. So the sponsor in U.S. then \u2014 a\nsponsor meant that you have to guarantee somebody\u2019s place to live in and work.\nYou had to have guaranteed position where you worked, in factory, of course, but\nyou had \u2014 so we then, Mother and I, I was in \u2014 1n that school for one year, in \u201951 by\nnow, I think, \u201950 \u2014 \u201950, \u201951.",
        "A: Forty-nine. So yeah, \u201950 - \u00b051. So then Mother and I go to join my father in\nGermany, and after 12 years it was really \u2014 I mean, I can\u2019t say it\u2019s a shock, but it\nwas like meeting a stranger, you know, there was this small station in Wentorf, was\nthe name of the town, German town. We get off the bus, and there is this man, we\ndon\u2019t know what to do with him, you know.\n134January 30, 2015",
        "A: So, but anyway, you know, it \u2014 after 12 years it\u2019s tough for anybody to get\nanywhere together, but \u2014 but we did. It worked out, to a point. But anyway, so then,\nwe \u2014 we are 1n a transit camp in \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Wentorf, and of course, you have to go through numerous interrogations\nagain. Not only interroga \u2014 physical examinations, everything. It took a month, or a\nmonth and a half, you know, and the \u2014 you do help in the camp, which is fine. And I\n\u2014 the \u2014 finally we are put in front of the American representative, I think equivalent\nto a consul \u2014 you know, coun \u2014 someone from the American consulate, on the\ngrounds of the camp. And finally he said yes, but it\u2019s still not certain that U.S.\nwants to accept us because my mother has a heart problem, so how are we going to\nsupport ourselves? So, we said, well, we both will work mad \u2014 I and \u2014 and my\nfather. So finally 1t\u2014 we are accepted, and we then leave our \u2014 our \u2014 how many\nmonths later we left, I don\u2019t know, about two, three months, through all this. And\nwe leave from Bremenhaven(ph).",
        "A: Right. On a ship called the General Macrae(ph) with other refugees from other\ncountries too; Latvia, you know, and Estonia even \u2014 Lithuania I didn\u2019t, but Latvia\nI remember, a very nice couple. So then we \u2014 it\u2019s October, the seas were rough, but\n135January 30, 2015\nwe somehow made it, and we arrive in New York, and we very quickly then, within\nhours, get on a train, and arrive in Chicago, Dearborn station, which nonexistent.\nThey preserve the building, but that\u2019s \u2014 I think it\u2019s like a shopping mall there. But \u2014\nso we then stay with our sponsors and literally the next day, Father goes to work at\nCherriads\u2019(ph) lumber company, although he doesn\u2019t know how to be a carpenter,\nor whatever it\u2019s on \u2014 and I go to to work for Butler\u2019s Specialty company, where\nthere is the mean owner, not \u2014 I \u2014 I mean, he \u2014 he \u2014 he thought I was scum, but he\nalso was very mean, I remember, because he was \u2014 I was not used for \u2014 to people\nwho were really disrespectful to elders. And this guy, I find out, is \u2014 is just awful to\nhis uncle who is an old Jew \u2014 these were Jewish people \u2014 I mean, he was awful. But\nanyway, so I work there, and in the meantime, the my \u2014 the director of our school in\nEngland keeps writing, continue studying, because I studied quite well, you know.\nSo I am \u2014 I try to look, but you are lost, you are the only one, you know. I work in\nthis factory, on an assembly line, and I \u2014 as I am closing the boxes, I am reciting\nPolish poetry. But I met very nice Mexican girl there, but the Polish ladies were\nsaying, why do you want to study, you know, it\u2019s the \u2014 you know, just keep\nworking, you know. So I was sort of a black sheep, because I wanted to study. So I\nstart \u2014 this Polish director from the Polish school, Dr. Falinski(ph) sends me to\nsome priest, who wants to put me in the high school, and I don\u2019t need to go to the\n136January 30, 2015\nhigh school any more. And then he also tells me well, there is a mission in Africa,\nmaybe you like [indecipherable]. No. So then wa \u2014 sends to another Polish\norganization which they tell me, why don\u2019t you learn to type. That\u2019s it, you know.\nAnd I said \u2014 I said to myself, well, I can learn how to type at home\n[indecipherable]. But anyway, so we stay for a short time already, with the\nsponsors. I work at Butler\u2019s Specialty company. And then we find a room. Again,\nit\u2019s all very near to the U.S. Steel Corporation, you know, where many Poles lived,\nand there was a Polish kind of a community there, on the south side, which is\nunlike, you know, the Polish [indecipherable]. So, the landlady\u2019s name is\nPiney(ph) Biernatska(ph), and she\u2019s just a\u2014 she le-learned how to write and read\nby herself. Her husband died very early because he worked in the steel mills. The\nair was polluted like heck there, you know, because of dust, in that time, you know.\nIt\u2019s amazing what happened since. So then I se \u2014 I \u2014 Tolek(ph) \u2014",
        "A: Lebanon, and a guy with whom I was in the same classroom, start writing to me\n\u2014 they were in Baltimore somewhere \u2014 and saying well, you know, you have to \u2014\nyou should apply directly to a university because you know, they were at Johns\nHopkins already, and they accept our matriculation, which was a surprise because it\nwas \u2014 but anyway, so okay, okay, so I\u2019m sitting, working at the factory, then I get a\n137January 30, 2015\nbetter job. I get a job in the slaughterhouses in Wilson and company, meat\ncompany, on the sou \u2014 on the way away from us, I have to go hours before I get\nthere. I am a messenger there, okay.

But anyway, I come back,\nand again \u2014 I one time, because we shared the bathroom with our landlady, and\nlandlady had two si \u2014 by then one married son, and two unmarried ones, and one\nstill lived with her. And I\u2019m 1n that bathroom, I am sorry to tell you, and I am\nlooking into the wastepaper basket, and I find a \u2014 a bulletin from Illinois Institute\nof Technology. And I don\u2019t know any better, but I look and I say, this is near.\nBecause my zip is 17, and IIT is 16. It wasn\u2019t near. In the meantime, Tolek(ph), he\nsays well, try it. We, of course, don\u2019t have the telephone. I use somebody else\u2019s\ntelephone. And I then meet the dean of the evening school, it was called. And yes,\nhe said, yeah. Oh, they know about po \u2014 our Polish schools in exile. And I started\nthen \u2014 very soon I \u2014 I worked, but I then after work from Wilson and company went\nto the evening school at WT. My 101 English was the first class. And then for five\nyears I then went to evening school. After Wilson and company, I got a job at the\nsavings and loan, Calumet Savings and Loan, where it\u2019s \u2014 savings and loans were\nstill sort of an ethnic kind of \u2014\n138January 30, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 financial institution, so they needed someone with Polish and English; some\npeople didn\u2019t speak. So I worked there while I went for five years to the evening\nschool, and my mother, of course, worried every \u2014 every evening because \u2014 but I \u2014\nthis was \u2014 at this point I would never venture to do it, but, I mean, 11 o\u2019clock I was\nstanding with U.S. Steel workers waiting to another bus, and all was well, you\nknow.",
        "A: Not any more. So \u2014 so \u2014",
        "A: And then \u2014 yeah, then I transferred to the day school, and I finished it in two\nyears, th-the undergraduate, and then they gave me teaching fellowship \u2014 teaching\nsi \u2014 assistantship there at IT, so \u2014 and I got my Masters there.",
        "A: In business and economics.",
        "A: And then they gave me \u2014 they \u2014 they gave me \u2014 UFC gave me a fellowship, and\nso I\u2014I have one year towards my PhD., but I \u2014 by then my mother died, and my\nfather was losing his job, and I had to work and it was too much for me. I quit after\na year.\n139\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: I think so, yes, I think so. But it didn\u2019t stop me from sort of really wanting to\nfind him, to have him. That\u2019s very true. He was a very bitter man towards the end,\nafter we arrived here. Very bitter, very bitter.",
        "A: Totally. Very bitter.",
        "A: Yes, very hard. That has been very hard, because I sort of idolized him, you\nknow. Everybody was having fathers coming back, they were all ha-happy, you\nknow when they saw fathers, and here it was, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s exa \u2014 precisely. I think that that\u2019s what really was killing me, because\nit\u2019s only towards the end of her life, which was \u2014 my mother died at 54.",
        "A: Yes, well \u2014\n140\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: So it was only \u2014 she died in \u201956, so it was only five \u2014 four years. Towards the\nend they sort of were getting along better, I thought, you know. It was \u2014 nothing\nwas \u2014 there were no quarrels, maybe it was better if there were, but th-there was a\nfeeling that it just was not working.",
        "A: Mm-hm, well \u2014",

        "A: Zaleszezyki.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s now Ukraine. I went twice to Poland. Once in the 50s, after my\nmother died, and that was really emotional. That was still under communists \u2014\ncommunism, and I-I took \u2014 I flew to England, and then England \u2014 there was an\nAnglo-Polish li \u2014 bus lines, because many Poles would go to England to shop, the\nones that could. So I then arrived in England, and again, I sort of got reunited with\nMarisha(ph).",
        "A: By then she had three children, and I then want \u2014 took the bus \u2014 we crossed the\nchannel, and in Ostend we took the bus through several \u2014 several countries, you\nknow, th-the west \u2014 th-the western countries in Europe there. Ho-Holland, and so\non. And we then \u2014 that was very interesting, because we stood a long time at the\nborder between East and West Germany, and there were the Russian soldiers with\ntheir little red stars. And s \u2014 but then, after we crossed the border, going through\nEast Germany, they would \u2014 they had stopped the bus once again, the East German\nsoldiers, with machine guns, you know, how much money you have? And you went\nthrough East Germany, and really, this was a depressing view, again. Just\ndepressing. So then, we arrive rather late on the border between East Germany and\n142January 30, 2015\nPoland, and these were everyb \u2014 those women, everybody that was there, you\nknow, they ha \u2014 they bought lots \u2014 they said, oh no, they\u2019ll stop us, and then look\nthrough all of this. They let us through, they didn\u2019t look at anything. But this was\nreally emotional again. Very emotional.",
        "A: Yeah, very. Because all of a sudden you \u2014 you \u2014 you really saw \u2014 and the ba \u2014 I\nmust say that compared to the East German soldiers, these Polish soldiers were so\nnice, you know. Elegant. And all of a sudden, there was a storm coming, and I \u2014\nthere were farmers, you know, in the \u2014 and they were speaking \u2014 I her \u2014 we heard\nthem, you know, speaking Polish. They were doing something with str \u2014 you know,\nstr \u2014 you know, st-straw \u2014",

        "A: Correct.\n143\nJanuary 30, 2015",
        "A: Yes. And the second trip I \u2014 I made in the 70s, still communist. The first trip\nthey even \u2014 th-th-they \u2014 you \u2014 you had to go and register. In Poznan I went to\nregister. And the guy asked me so, why didn\u2019t I return to Poland? But I told him all\nright.",
        "A: Yeah, was very, very strange that nobod \u2014 but yeah, they would follow you on\nthe streets at that time still. The second time when I went, I didn\u2019t feel that anybody\nwas following me. I did register, but it was a nothing \u2014 1970s, late 1970s. The\nsecond time I went because my \u2014 my one cousin I wa \u2014 th-the letters that were\ncoming were rather strange, that he was jailed, and so on. That was my uncle\u2019s two\nsons, so it was again a very strange, because one was in the army, and obviously\nsold himself just to make his living [indecipherable]. And the other one, I \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow what was the matter, but he was in jail. So I thought of helping. We \u2014 we\nhelped \u2014",

They gave me some position at the\nsavings and loan, but the owner\u2019s son was an idiot, excuse me, you know. You\nknow, he \u2014 he would not tell me that the customers were coming in, you know, and\nI don\u2019t know what that was about. But anyway, so then I got a \u2014 I started looking\nfor a job, and got a job at the Harris bank, which still exists [indecipherable]\nHarris bank. And again, I\u2014I was very much surprised that the human resource\nperson knew, oh yes, the \u2014 some doorman that had apartment went through \u2014\nthrough experiencing the war, and he was happy now to be a doorman, which is\ntrue. We would \u2014 all wanted to be free. But I \u2014 so I start \u2014 they \u2014I got the job as a\ncommercial credit analyst. What we did \u2014 what I did, there were only three women\nin a department of 15, and one of them was my husband, he was also a commercial\n\u2014 except we women wouldn\u2019t be in any way considered to become commercial\nlending officers. We were there to look at the work o-of all these men, their analysis\nof a particular request for a commercial loan, and decide what was wrong, or what \u2014\nso that\u2019s how I met my husband. The first time I met him, he\u2019s big, and I said oh,\n145January 30, 2015\nthis guy looks like a true American bully \u2014 excuse me guys.
