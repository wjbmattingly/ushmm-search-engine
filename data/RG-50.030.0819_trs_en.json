        "Answer: Mm-hm. The loss of my wife was severe. It was a shock to me, but it was\nimmediate. My wife was my partner in everything that I did, my entire life, for 67\nyears. She would have wanted \u2014 she would have wanted to be here, she would have\nwanted to see the interview going on, because she knew all of the experiences that I\nwill talk about. And \u2014 and that bolstered me, and I \u2014 I decided that yes, she would\ndefinitely want me to do this, and thus \u2014 I did not make the call, but I might have\nmade, to you, Ina.",

        "A: There\u2019s a lot of question \u2014 questioning and doubt about it. Some tell me that it\nwasn\u2019t Max, some tell me it was Marx, and I learned just a few years ago, that it\nwas really Manczyk, m-a-n-c-z-y-k, and we had relatives in Brazil, the Mancezyk\nfamily.",

And the house was directly across the street from a\nreservoir, which year \u2014 years later, when I went back to see if the home was still\nthere, the home was, but the reservoir was gone.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015",

        "Q: What about your parents\u2019 own home? How many rooms did it have?",
        "A: It\u2019s hard for me to remember, I was very young when we moved from there. But,\nin fact, I don\u2019t really rem \u2014 I think there were two bedrooms, there was a living\nroom, there was a dining room, and that was \u2014 and the bathroom, a bathroom, and\nthat was about it.",
        "Q: Okay. It sounds very modest for the owe \u2014 well, the part owner, partial owner of\na company.",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 it was not really a big business, and we have five brothers all\nworking together, they all drain off the business. So we \u2014 let\u2019s say friends,\nacquaintances, always thought they were wealthier than they really were. So we\nlived in a \u2014 yes, in a modest home.",
        "Q: And you say you moved from there at some point?July 14, 2015",
        "A: We moved from there to another section in Newark, the \u2014 the westernmost \u2014\nmost section, in the Vailsburg section of Newark, which is bordering on the town\nof South Orange. And I will tell you, when we moved, it \u2014 well, the family got\ntogether, had a going away party. We were still in Newark, but they considered that\nso distant, that they had to have a party for us.",
        "Q: So the rest of the uncles stayed on \u2014 there?",
        "A: They remained in \u2014 no, they moved to the suburbs, too.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was very common in Newark during those years, for je \u2014 for Jewish families\nin particular, to move, when they\u2019re able to, to move to the suburban areas. And\neach of the \u2014 as I recall, each of the brothers did move to a different suburban town\nin New Jersey.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 was the strai \u2014 did you live \u2014 in the original place, was the street that you\nlived on almost exclusively Jewish? Were you in a Jewish neighborhood, or was it\nmixed?",
        "A: It was totally mixed.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I\u2014I never lived in the Jewish neighborhood. I was going to say I never had the\nprivilege of living in a Jewish neighborhood. I suppose I would have liked it. ButJuly 14, 2015\nno, we \u2014 we were in mixed neighborhoods, where our neighbors were \u2014 I know a\nnumber of them were Italians, and Poles. I don\u2019t recall if there were any Jews even,\nin the area where we were. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So you could have been the only family.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: You could have been the only Jewish family.",
        "A: Just the \u2014 the next door \u2014 the house next door, as I mentioned before, was wa \u2014\none of my uncles. And we were the \u2014 I think the only Jewish people in the area,\nyeah.",
        "Q: How old were you when you an \u2014 when you moved?",
        "A: I try to remember, but it was probably kindergarten age, because I remember I\nentered another school. No, I do \u2014 no, I did, before we moved, I did have\nkindergarten 1n a local school there. So I would \u2014 would have been what, six or\nseven when we moved.",
        "Q: And in that \u2014 in those first six or seven years, are there any incidents from your\nchildhood that you still remember today, that kind of stand out?",
        "A: Yeah, one that I keep \u2014 keep thinking about, certainly around Christmastime.\nNow, we were observant, we belonged to a Reform congregation, but my father\nalways insisted as dressing up as Santa Claus.July 14, 2015",
        "Q: Did he really?",
        "A: Yes. And he \u2014 and I \u2014 and I re \u2014 remember. There was an alleyway along \u2014\nalongside of the house, and I remember his going up that alleyway, going, ho, ho,\nho, ho, ho, imitating Santa. And \u2014 and gifts and all that. So, really in a \u2014 and \u2014 and\nit was a very strange thing, because we were very closely related to the \u2014 to a\nsynagogue, and yet, we observed Christmas.",
        "Q: Did you know it was him, or did you think it was Santa?",
        "A: Oh, it took me a while to get to know it, but after a while I knew it, and, you\nknow, he was exposed, and he stopped doing it after that, but \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, when I was \u2014 when \u2014 in the very, very beginning, I \u2014 I wasn\u2019t quite\nsure, but after a while, it was \u2014 became obvious. Were \u2014",
        "Q: Well, did it \u2014 did it feel strange to be observing Christmas when you were little,\nor this is something you just think about now, as an adult?",
        "A: It was just a natural thing.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because we were in that kind of a neighborhood, and everybody else observed it,\nand so we did, too. Even though we, again, continued to practice our Judaism, we\nstill observed, to be part of the neighborhood.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015",
        "Q: What\u2019s your first memory, or maybe amongst your first memories, of going to a\nsynagogue, of becoming part of the community, the Jewish community?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Well, going to synagogue, we belonged to a congregation in Newark,\nNew Jersey, B\u2019Nai Jeshurun, was extreme Reform. A very, very, very li-liberal\ncongregation. And I remember my parents going there, and then when I was old\nenough, I started to go there, too. But we moved before I \u2014 there was anything\nsignificant, but we maintained our membership in that congregation. It was on High\nStreet in Newark. And I don\u2019t remember anything particular about \u2014 about it, just\nthat my mother was very particular about Friday nights, and Saturday mornings.\nAnd people don\u2019t always think that, well, you were a Reform Jew, so you\u2019re not\nthat ritualistic, I mean, you\u2019re not that tied to it. But m-m-my mother was.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that carried on through my youth. Friday nights were always \u2014 always\nsacrosanct. You went to temple Friday night, and that\u2019s what I did.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s some \u2014 that\u2019s something that \u2014 that Just stayed constant from your\nvery earliest years?",
        "A: From my earliest years. As a matter of fact, when we moved to the Vailsburg\nsection, I was athletic, and I was part of an athletic group. Just a group that\neventually just \u2014 was just below semi-professional. There were oth \u2014 there was onlyJuly 14, 2015\none other Jew in the group, the others were all Christians. There were Poles and\nItalians. This is in the Vailsburg section of Newark. They knew, though, and they\nrespected the fact that Friday nights I would not hang out with them at the local\nsoda shop. And they respected that very, very highly, as I respected their Christian\nfaith, too. And I \u2014 well, some \u2014 some \u2014 some \u2014 sometime later, when it came time\nfor my first Bar Mitzvah \u2014 this is something that I \u2014 I \u2014 I remember so vividly\nbecause it was so unusual. I invited all of the \u2014 the athletic group to my Bar Mitzvah\nservice. And when I say the temple B\u2019Nai Jeshurun was ultra, ultra liberal, the Bar\nMitzvah boy did not read from the Torah. All I did was prayer, the prayer before\nand after the reading of the Torah, and a speech. Now it\u2019s Saturday morning, and\nI\u2019m at my Bar Mitzvah, and I \u2014 I get up to make a speech. And I do, the typical\nboys\u2019 Bar Mitzvah, so today I am a man, etcetera. And when I finish \u2014 these guys,\nthere must have been 10 or 11 of them, they got up, and they started to clap. Yo,\nBobby. They cheered, they whistled. The decorum, mostly on a Saturday morning,\nelderly women, very reserved, and so forth, they looked, and I saw the heads \u2014 I\ncould see from the \u2014 from the bema, the heads of the people just dropped, oh my\nGod. They\u2019re just wa \u2014 wa-waving their heads from side to side. They had never\nseen a demonstration like that before. However, as I say, my \u2014 my friends,\nChristians, were very ver \u2014 very, very well aware that Friday night I would not hangJuly 14, 2015\nout. But I \u2014 as \u2014 in recip \u2014 reciprocating for their coming to my Bar Mitzvah, I\nattended Catholic midnight mass \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, did you really?",
        "A: \u2014 that year, yes, I went to the Sacred Heart church in Vailsburg section in\nNewark, to be, because they were all Christians, and they were there at the church,\nso I said, I will come to your church now. And I did.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a very unusual story.",
        "A: Its a\u2014",
        "Q: You know, it\u2019s a very unusual sort of ex \u2014 set of experiences for the early 1930s,\nor the mid-1930s.",
        "A: It \u20141t would \u2014 I \u2014 I think it was probably unique, because most everybody I\nknew, as \u2014 over the years, as I\u2019ve grown up, most everybody I knew, certainly in the\nJewish world, that ber \u2014 that grew up in Newark, grew up in the Weequahic\nsection of Newark, which was \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I think of it as a rich man\u2019s ghetto, because\nit was all Jewish, but there were nice homes, and well-to-do people. Others that\nwere not well-to-do, too, but it was preserved very, very well, as long as they were\nthere. So I always felt that I missed out on something that was significant. I never\nhad \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014I did not live in wa \u2014 in a Jewish section, did not live near Jewish\npeople, but I never had any acts of anti-Semitism, despite the fact that I \u2014 I evolved,July 14, 2015\ncircu \u2014 circulated in a Christian world. Just never ran into it. And somehow I \u2014 I felt\neven deprived, because of the experience. You have to know what anti-Semitism is,\nyou have to feel it yourself, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve always believed, and I fe \u2014 I didn\u2019t feel it. It\nwasn\u2019t until later on in life that I really got to understand it. Well, I studied it more,\nand became active in community life things. But no, I was deprived of one of the \u2014 I\nshouldn\u2019t call it a joy, but one of the experiences that many young Jewish boys went\nthrough.",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a nice \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 as deprivations go, this 1s probably one that one\nwould want to have, you know?",
        "A: As nice a one as I could have wanted, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about family dynamics. Your \u2014 you had an older\nbrother, eight years older. Wha \u2014 what was your relationship with him like?",
        "A: Like father and son. My father worked very often in the eve \u2014 evenings. And\nLester \u2014 eight years older, it was a pretty big spread. He took over as \u2014 as my\nfather. At the age of three \u2014 I have pictures of that remarkable \u2014 he bought me a\nNew York Yankee baseball uniform; cleats, a glove, bat and ball.",
        "Q: Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.",
        "A: And he wa \u2014 he wou \u2014 the house that we lived on, that I mentioned, on South\nOrange Avenue in Newark, had a backyard, and there was a fence separating itJuly 14, 2015\nfrom the house behind. He pitched to me. Now, I shouldn\u2019t say \u2014 and \u2014 and I swung\nthe bat, but really, he was a good pitcher, and he would hit the bat. He kept my\nbatting average \u2014 and the best that I can remember, one season he had me batting\n.575. Now that was even bigger \u2014 much, much bigger than Ted Williams .400\nbatting average, you know\u201d? And he kept record of homeruns, the fence was about\nmaybe a hundred feet away, li\u2014 and so, every now and then he would hit the bat\nperfectly, and I would swing a little bit, and we go over the fence. So we kept my\nhomerun record, and all of that. He taught me baseball, took me to Rupert Stadium\nin Newark, the trolley was right across the street from our house, took us down to\nNewark, and followed the New York Yankee, the farm team, the Newark Bears.\nBut \u2014 so he \u2014 he re-really \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014I guessed, introduced me to sports, all sports, and\nI think acted very much like a \u2014 a \u2014a father. When he \u2014",
        "Q: He sounds like a wonderful older brother.",
        "A: It wa \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was a \u2014 just a marvelous rel-relationship. And during the war \u2014\nyou know, World War II was partially \u2014 par-partially financed by the American\npeople. There were signs all over, buy war bonds. And so he bought war bonds for\nme. I was just \u2014 just a young kid yet. So I already had war bonds going for me. He\nwas that \u2014",
        "Q: When did he buy them? What year would have this been?July 14, 2015",
        "A: Oh, that would have been \u2014 well, surely after war was de-declared, so the early \u2014",
        "Q: It \u2014 after 41.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: After \u00b041.",
        "A: After \u201941, right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 and the bonds were av-available, so he bought some. And when he went\ninto the service too, he bought bonds, even he had allocation taken out of his pay,\nwhich was very moderate, and he was married at the time, and he had an allocation\ntaken out in war \u2014 in bonds bought for me. Very, very strong relationship.",
        "Q: What els \u2014 what did he teach you? What do you \u2014 what are some of the \u2014 you\nknow, clearly, he showed an absolute adoration of a little boy \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 to buy him a baseball suit \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 and \u2014 and make sure that he bats, and \u2014 and builds his confidence, and \u2014 and\nhas a great homerun score, and a batting average score. What kind of a personality\nwas he, and what are the things that he bequeathed to you from that?July 14, 2015",
        "A: Well, try \u2014 he was a \u2014 he was basically a \u2014 a good person, so what he was doing\nfor me, I don\u2019t know that he did a great deal in philanthropy, or charity, and all that,\nbut he was just basically very good. Had strong, strong ties to family. And he\nremembered my birth, which was in a \u2014 it was a private home, they called it Essex\nGeneral Hospital, but it was somebody\u2019s home, and I was born in a bedroom in\nthat home. And he reminded me time and time again, that he saw me at birth, lying\n\u2014 just \u2014 just after birth, lying out in the hallway of that house, in a leather covered \u2014\nlea-leather seat, a chair, a little \u2014 he said, you were about this big. He used to\ndescribe it to me often. So, I \u2014 I guess in a se \u2014 in \u2014 1n a sense, he \u2014 he \u2014 he was\nthere at the very, very beginning, and just \u2014 I was the first child after him, and he\ntook a responsibility. He was eight years old at the time, and was mature enough to\nsay, this is my little brother. And somewhere within him, he must have said, and\nI\u2019m going to see that he \u2014 I\u2019m going to care for him, cause Papa\u2019s not around\nenough, and Mama has her things to do. But I\u2019m going to see that he gets well cared\nfor, and he did, the rest of his life.",
        "Q: Wow. I would usually save this for another part of our interview, but I\u2019d like to\ntalk to you about your brother a little bit more. You say he all \u2014 I\u2019d like to find out\nwhat his destiny was. So, let\u2019s start with the war.",
        "A: Mm-hm.July 14, 2015",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did he volunteer, or was he drafted? Wha \u2014 how did that \u2014 what happened?",
        "A: Okay, he volunteered.",
        "Q: Okay. And where did he serve?",
        "A: He served the European theater, and I\u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I possibly should be telling you\nthis later on, because in sequence \u2014 it\u2019s out of sequence.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I think it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s more important that it relates to the kind of person he was\n[indecipherable]. If I get into th \u2014 in \u2014 in\u2014 I\u2019m \u2014I\u2019m jumping ahead very far, I \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 wartime experience, yes.",
        "Q: Okay, then in that case we\u2019ll hold on to it.",

        "Q: And we\u2019ll postpone some of the discussion on what his experiences were, for a\nlittle bit. Let\u2019s go back to talk about some of your other family members. You had a\nlittle sister.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Her name was Ruth.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And, tell me a little bit about Ruth, and about the relationship that you guys had.",
        "A: We grew up as typical brother sister. She had her group, I had my group.",
        "Q: Did she tag along behind you?",
        "A: No, she didn\u2019t. She was independent. She had, as I say, her own group of young\nladies, and I had my athletic group. They didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t mix, really. We were\ntwo different \u2014 different types of \u2014 of groups. So I really didn\u2019t have much\ninteraction with her. We were, in a sense, a close-knit family, but not that we played\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\ntogether. We went together. We would make many trips to Atlantic City, Mother,\nFather, Sister and me, but not my older brother. Again, eight years older, he was\nlike in another world, and as I mentioned, he was like my \u2014 like a father to me. So\nhe had his activities going. He went to college long before I was eligible for that,\nand so we \u2014 we were not that close, other than the fact that, as I mentioned, he was\nso, So close to me. So, we had our relationship, and my sister was pretty much out\nof \u2014 out of it.",
        "Q: What about your parents now? Tell me a little bit about their personalities. What\nkind of people were they?",
        "A: I said before that my father was president of the company. He was appointed so\nby his father, because he was the oldest. He was not a leader type to the younger\nbrothers. Plus, a bookkeeper really ran that business. My father was content to fix\nmilk boxes with hammers and nails. So it was in \u2014 it was in a \u2014 an uncomfortable\nrole for him, and he signed checks as president of the company, and people outside\nin the \u2014 at our Jewish world, knew that he was president of the company, and there\nwas prestige that went with it, and all, but act \u2014 in actuality he did not play that\nactive arole. When I say that my brother took over because my father was often\naway at night, he was running trucks. He was delivering milk.",
        "Q: Your father?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015",
        "A: My father, yes, he\u2019s president of the company, but he da \u2014 so, he was just a\ndifferent kind \u2014 different kind of per \u2014 of a person, and \u2014",
        "Q: Was he a quiet person?",
        "A: Yeah, he was pretty quiet. I wouldn\u2019t say substantially so, but you know, not a\nboisterous kind of person, not a happy-go-lucky, jovial type person. Pretty sedate.\nBut, I always thought, a good father. He \u2014 he always did things for me. We had\nspecial trips we \u2014 1n those days, going \u2014 take \u2014 going out and \u2014 in the evening,\ngetting in the car, because we didn\u2019t have air conditioning, you want to cool off\nduring the summer, you take a ride in the car. We used to go down route 20 \u2014 it was\nroute 22 then, it\u2019s route 29, national, now. And route tw \u2014 222, I\u2019m sorry, national\nnow, we used to call it route \u2014 local, New Jersey, route 29. And it was called \u2014 I\ncalled it the hamburger route, because my father used to put us in the car on a\nsummer evening, and go down the road, and there was a hamburger stand down\nthere, and I liked the hamburgers. To get me to go to Friday night services, after\nservices, there were two places we went on Friday nights. One was Eddis\u2019s(ph), a\nmalted shop in Newark, and the other was a pizza \u2014 I can\u2019t remember the name of\nit, star. Star Pizzeria. There is one today, it\u2019s in Orange, but it\u2019s not the same\nfamily. Star Pizzeria. And because my father helped them with a connection, that\nthey got their liquor license, they used to have \u2014 Friday nights, after service, we\u2019dJuly 14, 2015\ngo into the kitchen, these big, huge ovens, and they were cooking, making these\npizzas there. And they were pizzas not quite the way they\u2019re made today. They were\nmade oh, olive oil, and spices and tomato \u2014 tomato \u2014 just \u2014 just \u2014",
        "Q: Sounds delicious.",
        "A: And very, very thin, very thin crust. But anyway, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of\nrelationship we \u2014 we had, in taking \u2014 so he was good to the family. Took us fairly\nfrequently to Atlantic City for a weekend. I loved staying in hotels. Sunday\nmorning breakfast was just great. So he was \u2014 he was good to us.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and your mom? Tell me a little bit about her, what was she like?",
        "A: Again, a\u2014 a\u2014 avery good mother. Wonderful cook. Really cared for her \u2014 her\nchildren. She used to take me and my sister to Newark, downtown Newark\nfrequently, when Newark was one of the great cities in America. She would take\nus there for lunch, to a movie. There were more movie houses then, than there are\ntoday, and all that. But I would say both, they were both really, really good parents\nto us. One thing that I\u2019ve always regretted. If they wanted to talk so that we didn\u2019t\nunderstand, they\u2019d talk Yiddish. And \u2014",
        "Q: That was going to be one of my questions.",
        "A: Yeah, they talked Yiddish, but never enough in our presence, for us to acquire.\nAnd I always \u2014 always felt that in a \u2014 in a sense, they let us down, because theyJuly 14, 2015\nused to talk between themselves, but I didn\u2019t learn very much from my parents. And\nI had to learn it mostly in my own way, starting to read newspapers \u2014",
        "Q: And did you?",
        "A: \u2014 listening to radio. Pardon?",
        "Q: And did you?",
        "A: I did. Oh, I\u2014 I - at a pri \u2014 fairly early age, I st \u2014 I did read newspapers, more\nthan just the comics, and I did listen to \u2014 I listened to radio \u2014 radio news broadcasts.\nBut there were a lot of \u2014 a lot of things that I always begrudged the fact that they\ndidn\u2019t admit \u2014 they weren\u2019t conscious \u2014 conscious of it. They could have instructed\nus on a lot of things. I usually go to the polls during elections and all that, and we\nwere never taught politics. I always wished that, you know, they \u2014 they knew no \u2014\nsomething about \u2014 we had a Jewish mayor at one point, Mayor ma \u2014 Meyersee(ph)\n\u2014 whose name \u2014 well, slips me for the moment.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, in the 30s.",
        "A: But anyway, the only \u2014 the only Jewish mayor in newar \u2014 in Newark\u2019s history,\nand all the \u2014 so my father knew some of these people, but there were never any\nintroductions, never any background with these people, never what the political\nscene was like, and so forth.July 14, 2015",
        "Q: So, does the conversation then \u2014 it was it \u2014 the conversation at home didn\u2019t\nrevolve around the wild \u2014 wider world.",
        "A: No, it didn\u2019t. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay. And what \u2014 was that because your parents didn\u2019t have that kind of\ninterest, even though they might have had the connection?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it was the interest, I th \u2014 I think it was just not the awareness.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I\u2014I think, maybe at that time some \u2014 probably a lot of parents were that way.\nVery, very different, as the decades went on, parents, you know, dinner table, you\ndiscuss issues of importance, and where you\u2019re going to college, and what you field\nof studies are going to be. And here\u2019s some of my experience as \u2014 as a doctor, or\nwha \u2014 whatever. World affairs, politics on occasion. We didn\u2019t do any of that. And\n\u2014 and \u2014 and I\u2014I missed it.",
        "Q: Did you know your grandparents, aside from the grandpa who had the Cadillac?",
        "A: Yeah, my grandfather I did it \u2014 didn\u2019t know for very long, because he died\nbefore he was 50.",
        "Q: Yeah.July 14, 2015",
        "A: My grandmother though, was always considered a great, great old lady. Well, I\nshouldn\u2019t say that. A great person. She lived \u2014 well, it must have been probably\nsomewhere around 90, which was extremely high in those day \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 in those days. She \u2014 she never learned to read or write English. She \u2014 she\nspoke \u2014",
        "Q: Did she speak it?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Did she speak it?",
        "A: Did she speak \u2014",
        "Q: English.",
        "A: English? Yes, yeah. She acquired enough. Not a very, very good English, but\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 could not write. And I remember Shirley, my wife, getting a letter once\nfrom her. It was in hebe \u2014 it \u2014 it was in Yiddish, and she had to get somebody to\ninterpret it for us. So, she could write in Yiddish, read Yiddish, whatever reading\nshe did. Her produ \u2014 her dominant responsibility was running a household, and a \u2014\nand a kitchen for, I think it was 10 to 20 people. The people who wor \u2014 my\ngrandfather had a farm \u2014 I said the milk business. The milk bus \u2014 retail milkJuly 14, 2015\nbusiness evolved from the farm. They kept the \u2014 they owned \u2014 my grandfather\nowned what \u2014 a good \u2014 big part of what became Irvington Center.",
        "Q: Oh, wow.",
        "A: And we always begrudged his \u2014 his act-activities, his \u2014 his traveling, and all that.\nWhat he did was to sell off parcels of land there, that later would have enriched his\nfamily so much, because it grew in value. He kept selling off parcels of land so he\ncould go with his re \u2014 maroon Cadillac, and the chauffeur, and travel all over the\ncountry.",
        "Q: And your grandmother, or not?",
        "A: But \u2014 but she, now she \u2014 she had to carry the burden, because all the people they\nhad working on the farm, and the \u2014 and the \u2014 the brothers and sisters, she cooked.\nShe was a marvelous, marvelous cook, but that\u2019s what she did, virtually all day,\ncooking and cleaning and laundry. That was her life.",
        "Q: Oh my God, it\u2019s a hard life.",
        "A: Yes, yes, but sh \u2014 physically very, very active, until they had a \u2014 they had a\nhouse at \u2014 in Bradley Beach, New Jersey, in addition to living here, on\n[indecipherable] Street in Newark. They had a house, and a small house in the\nback. Ma \u2014 the \u2014 my grandmother ha-had the \u2014 her house, the families used to come\ndown and occupy the big house for weekends, and so forth. She did all the cooking,July 14, 2015\nshe did all the cleaning, she did everything herself. There were never any help. I\ndon\u2019t think any vi \u2014 any of the daughters or daughters-in-law even helped. All of\nthat. And her career, her active, physical career, doing things like that, ended when\none of her sons, one of my uncles, drove down to Bradley Beach, and drives into\nthe driveway, and there is this house in the back. She\u2019s up on the roof nailing\nthings. She\u2019s almost 90 na \u2014 90 at that time, well into her 80s, and she was nailing.\nAnd he said, Mom, Mom, come down from there, you know, don\u2019t ever \u2014 and they\nprohibited her from doing anything like that. She deteriorated after that. But she\nwas always regarded as a great, great lady. Without, again, the s \u2014 the reading \u2014\nwriting skills, and the reading, any of that \u2014",
        "Q: Well, she kept the whole thing going.",

        "A: Not as well, but most often, on Sundays, we traveled to Kearny, which is where\nthe Kahns, they\u2019re k-a-h-n, the grandparents, they lived on Chestnut Street. I\nalmost \u2014 almost remember the number, but Chestnut Street in Kearny. And that\nwas our Sunday activity, we\u2019d drive over. And \u2014 and she would always make\nFrench style chicken fricassee. She came from France. Chicken fricassee. And my\nmother could make that, too. And I used to talk to Shirley a lot, sh \u2014 sh \u2014 about,\nShirl, get the recipe, make chicken fricassee. She made her own version of it. Was\n\u2014 it was good, but not quite she same as Kearny er \u2014 gr \u2014 Kearny grandma made \u2014",

So that was them, and I didn\u2019t know wha \u2014 they were in the cattle\nbusiness on farms, and all their sons were in the cattle business, except one, A-\nAaron, who was in the milk business, 1n competition, in a sense, with my father.\nBut he used to drive up to our house. I mentioned that I \u2014 I was born on South\nOrange Avenue in Newark. And fairly often wou \u2014 I would look out the window\nand see a horse drawn wagon, big milk \u2014 big bottle of milk painted on it, and all\nthat. That was Uncle Aaron, would come by on his route, would come by, stop in\nand have a cup of coffee with us. And after, he became \u2014 no education, but there\u2019s a\npainting in my bedroom that he did. After he retired from that activity, he became a\npainter, and did marvelous flower paintings, and all that. So, that was the \u2014",

        "Q: But those were the years.",
        "A: It was. Actually though, the milk that my father sold came from upper New\nYork state.",
        "Q: Oh, really?July 14, 2015",
        "A: Yeah, so farms up there. I think these people were related somehow, to one of\nmy uncles, and all. But they, every \u2014 every day, every day, the bi \u2014 the bi \u2014 the big\ndeal at the dairy would be, oh, the trailer\u2019s coming, the trailer\u2019s coming.

        "A: Yeah, they didn\u2019t \u2014 the \u2014 they didn\u2019t, and so they weren\u2019t progressive. My\nbrother, again, back to my brother, on su-summers, he would work there at the\ndairy. And there was jealousy that went on, say he never \u2014 they never really gaveJuly 14, 2015\nhim much of a chance. They wa \u2014 the uncles were \u2014 were not kind, not particularly\ncongenial toward him, and we \u2014 my brother and I talked later on, and said, if they \u2014\nif they had, if the brothers had had the sense enough to allow my brother and me to\ncome in, the next generation, and run the business, it would have been a successful\nbusiness. But when you \u2014 when you have brothers in the business, and they spend a\ngood part of their time arguing or fighting with one another, and who\u2019s taking more\nvacation time, and tho \u2014 those kinds of things happen there.

        "Q: Yeah. Well, you know, it also depends on \u2014 on the f \u2014 the \u2014 the previous\ngeneration from that too, you know. If your grandfather wasn\u2019t really interested in\nmaking sure that things were divided equally, that kind of set things up too,\nsometimes.",

        "Q: Was it \u2014 was there any talk anywhere? Like in school, or in your world? I guess\nI\u2019m trying to get a sense of how did events that were going on in Germany, when\ndid they become part of at least something you were aware of?",
        "A: It\u2019s very vague with \u2014 in my mi \u2014 my memory, very vague. And the best I can\nthink of, probably not until high school, til I got into high school, that I started to\nbecome interested in world affairs, started to read newspapers re-regularly.",
        "Q: Yeah, that would have been \u2014",
        "A: And then I knew \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 what was going on. But I had to be, you know, 14, 15, 16.",

        "A: And it started, right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Right. So I didn\u2019t know a great deal about it, until Is \u2014 as I say, I started reading\nmy \u2014 on my own, in newspapers.",
        "Q: Did you have a radio at home?",
        "A: We did have radio. We listened to radio a great deal. I very often listened to Joe\n\u2014 Joe Louis\u2019 bouts. And oh, he was amazing. I \u2014 I\u2014 I think about that, when people\n\u2014 when we talk today about \u2014 when those days we didn\u2019t have TV. We certainly\ndidn\u2019t have computers and all that. What did you do? Well, we listened to radio.\nWhat \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 what did you see? We didn\u2019t see. We saw in our own minds.\nAnd I \u2014I fought every round with Joe Louis in those bouts, just listening on a big\nbox radio, and I could point \u2014 the announcers had to be very good, and they were.\nAnd I could really, really feel that I saw Louis in those great bouts, in the Louis \u2014\nBraddock \u2014 or mac \u2014 Max Baer, Jimmy Braddock championship fight. Well,\nMax Baer was our hero. Remember, he wore the Jewish star, and \u2014 and he was a\nbraggadocios ki \u2014 kind of guy. Glamorous sor \u2014 sort of. And then defi \u2014 defeated by\nthis small time boxer, really, from New Jersey. But, listening on radio, it was \u2014 it\nwas \u2014 it was very real, and we could see it \u2014 you know, we didn\u2019t \u2014 listening now 1s\nquite different, because we ha \u2014 we\u2019ve been exposed to TV. But, it was real.July 14, 2015",
        "Q: This \u2014 sou-sound has a magical quality.",
        "A: It has. It has. And even ba-baseball games, except for one incident I remember, a\nbaseball announcer \u2014 and you know, President Reagan wa-wa-was a baseball a-\nannouncer, sportscaster and all. But the Newark Bears were the yank \u2014 New York\nYankees farm team, A number one farm team. They had an announcer by the name\nof Earl Harper. And I used to listen to baseball \u2014 again, my \u2014 I mentioned my\nbrother had really introduced me to baseball, maybe a New York Yankee. And so I\nused to listen to the Yankee game certainly, but I listened to the Newark Bears\ngames, too, and Earl Harper was the announcer. They had to describe what was\ngoing on in the field, to gi \u2014 give you on \u2014 the only representation you could get,\nwhat, literally, was happening. So I remember Earl Harper, I sit down, and I was\nlistening, he said, the si\u2014 the wind-up, the pitcher wind-up, the stretch, the pitch,\nand there goes a booming drive, going \u2014 look a \u2014 deep, deep center field, and \u2014 and\n\u2014 and a\u2014 and Roy Schalk steps back on the grass and takes it. Roy Schalk was\nsecond baseman. So that description of this long, long drive going out to center\nfield, was really caught by the second baseman, who just stepped back onto the\ngrass, and all that. So sometimes you got vivid descriptions that weren\u2019t very real.\nAnd they could color them if they wanted to, and some of them did, or they couldJuly 14, 2015\nma-make errors, and sometime they did that too, but \u2014 but anyway, radio was real to\nus.",
        "Q: And so, were there other types, non-sports programs that the family listened to?",
        "A: Yeah, I think my mother had her favorite morning drama \u2014 drama. So morning,\nwhen we\u2019re cooking, preparing lunch, and preparing for the evening meal, there\nwere \u2014 there were drama shows on radio, and she, I think, used to listen to those. I\nused to listen to a lot of music. I became a musician. And I got fascinated with Big\nBand Swing, which was the music of that era. So I listened to a great, great deal of\nthat.",
        "Q: What about December 7\", 1941?",

        "A: I must have known about it before, because I knew the two Japanese\nambassadors, Nomura, began with a C, and an N, and a C, but the two Japanese\nwere in the White House at the time. They knew the attack was coming, as it was\nreported later on, and they knew it, and they were negotiating with the president.\nSo, it was really a dastardly, dastardly act. Their planes were already on the way to\nPearl Harbor, and they were still talking with the president of the United States,\nin the White House.",
        "Q: And you knew of this before his speech goes on. That is, people in the area\nwould have known this already, or not? No.",

        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. For wa \u2014 for wa \u2014 for one thing, we weren\u2019t as alert, or\ninterested in the rest of the world, we had a literal enclaves that we lived in. And so,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nwe didn\u2019t need the exposure that people need today, that we had. And so what \u2014\nwhat we did get, on newscasts, was, you know, it was sufficient for us, at that time.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s important to know.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",

        "A: Oh, a very different world, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. And one other question that I\u2019ve got is background question. What kind of\nimage did you have in your mind, of what Europe was, based again, on family.\nBecause most Americans, when they came, most Americans at that time, would not\nhave been immigrants from the second or third generation, they would have been\nearlier, you know?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And Europe is very distant. What was \u2014 how was Europe painted for you, given\nthat your mother comes from western Europe, and your father\u2019s family came from\neastern Europe?",
        "A: Even though they came from there, I had no \u2014 no knowledge really, of central\nEurope, of eastern Europe. To me, Europe was Paris and London, Spain. Strictly\nthe western \u2014 the nations in Europe. But just \u2014 just Europe seemed so distant. It\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nwas another world. Today it\u2019s very different, it\u2019s in our \u2014 it\u2019s in our backyard, and\nyou travel to it all the time. But it was very, very rare for anybody to travel even, to\nEurope. So, it didn\u2019t play much of a role in our lives. Just a fascination, something\nout there that\u2019s very alluring to us, but we\u2019d \u2014 we didn\u2019t think, we didn\u2019t travel the\nway people travel today.

        "Q: Yeah.",

        "A: Right.",

        "A: Well, obviously, I was aware that the Japanese had struck, and we were in a war\nin the Pacific islands. It didn\u2019t affect me very, very much, until, you know, four\ndays later, December 11, 1941, that Adolf Hitler declared war on America. Now itJuly 14, 2015\nwas a different \u2014 different story. First of all, Hitler, Nazi \u2014 Nazi Germany, Jews,\nall of that began to register on me, as I \u2014 as I mentioned, I read newspapers, so I\nknew what was going on. That started to register. In 1941, I graduated high school,\nthen 1942, headed for college.",
        "Q: Where?",
        "A: September of 1942, I guess that\u2019s when it was. Pretty sure. And I was what, 19 at\nthe time. Oh, I\u2019m s \u2014I\u2019m sorry. My first year, I did not go to Ohio University. My\nfirst year wa \u2014 I went to New York University. It was convenient, I didn\u2019t have to\ngo traveling any place. I could just \u2014 oh, about a half mile from my home, I could\nget on a bus, and travel to Newark, take a train into New York, and I went to New\nYork University, the fi-first \u2014 first year. And that\u2019s when I read newspapers a great\ndeal, during \u2014 during travel to and from the city. And that\u2019s when I \u2014 I knew what\nwas going on, and \u2014 with Nazis. I knew the concentration camps were be \u2014\nbeginning, Hitler\u2019s plan of the \u2014 his gru \u2014 his \u2014 his book.",

I had terrible sinusitis, and the doctor\nsaid, you must get out of this area, because otherwise you\u2019re going to have trouble\nbreathing, constantly. Pick an area out in the Midwest. I had a classmate, who knewJuly 14, 2015\nI was ma \u2014 m-majoring in journalism, had a classmate, who told me about this\nlovely, little school, small town in Ohio, Athens, Ohio. Ohio University.

And you know, they had\na band, a swing band, and his name was Jack Leonard. He had been with the\nTommy Dorsey orchestra. He preceded Frank Sinatra as the vocalist for that\norchestra. So he \u2014 like ma \u2014 like so many of the musa \u2014 musicians, so many, many\nof them, the bandleaders and all, they all volunteered, and went in the service.\nGlenn Miller, you know what happened to him.",

They had one\nof the most popular ones, had a unique sound, that he created for his orchestra. And\nhe \u2014 I believe he volunteered. He became a captain, then a major, and he was\nleading \u2014 he had a\u2014 a\u2014 a World War II band, a counterpart of what he had in\ncivilian life. And they played some of the same music, again. And he used to travel\nto the bases, where the troops were, overseas, and play concerts, jazz co \u2014 swing\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nconcerts for them.

        "A: \u2014 was hit, and was \u2014 and disappear \u2014 dis-disappeared.

I \u2014\nI played in local bands here. So I played clarinet and saxophone. So I get there, and\nI\u2019m called into the office. And they tell me that Jack Leonard would like to see\nyou. I says, why would he want to see me? So I went to him. He said, kid, I see you\nplay saxophone, clarinet. How could he know that? We didn\u2019t have computers in\nthose days, how did he know? Somehow it was on my record that I had been\nplaying with bands. He said, I\u2014 I\u2019m going to give you a weekend pass. I want you\nto come play in the \u2014 play wi \u2014 in the band here. And he give me a weekend pass.\nGo back to South Orange, come back with your instruments. And I did. It was a\ntotally different life. No more KP. I didn\u2019t have to even make my bed. Every \u2014\neverything was cared for me. I was now a musician among the elite, I guess. All I \u2014July 14, 2015\nI didn\u2019t have any chores, no potato peeling, nothing. And I practiced in the morning,\nwent to rehearsal. We rehearsed in the afternoon. We would broadcast on radio at\nnight.",

        "A: Live, yes, live broadcasts, and I \u2014 it was as great a life as anybody could\nimagine. I me \u2014 war\u2019s going on, here I am playing music here. I can play \u2014 I could\npossibly play \u2014 play the rest of the war, just sitting there, and playing with\nmusicians. I was intimidated, in a way. I looked around me \u2014 cause I \u2014 I used to\nfollow these big bands, and I knew \u2014 I knew who the \u2014 who the \u2014 the side men\nwere. And these were not musicians, frankly, like today\u2019s musicians. They were\ntrained in Juilliard, and places like that. They could orchestrate, arrange, compose.\nSo they were great musicians, the best of their day. And there I am sitting with\nthem, and trying to keep place with them. The very first number we play was a\nnumber from Benny g \u2014 Benny Goodman orchestra created, called \u201cSix Flats\nUnfurnished.\u201d That means the music is written in the \u2014 1n six flats, and six flats, it\nmakes it tougher to play. And here I am, sitting with all these great musicians, andJuly 14, 2015\nplaying a tough piece. And oh, tha-that was \u2014 that was \u2014 that was difficult. At any\nrate, that went on. Could have \u2014 could have remained.",

        "A: It could have been a great life. I think I could have spent probably the entire war\nplaying music. My name came up to be shipped out for basic training. Jack\nLeonard intervenes, and gets the name stripped off. And I say, Jack\n[indecipherable] he said. I said, I \u2014 I\u2014 Jack, I \u2014 I do want to g \u2014 want to go \u2014 yeah,\nI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m in the army, I\u2019m 20 years old.

I know many of my peep \u2014\nmy age, are going overseas, and they\u2019re \u2014 some of them probably losing their lives\n[indecipherable] and whatever. But my place is not here, it\u2019s there. So I say, Jack,\nI want to go out \u2014 I\u2014I want to \u2014 I want to go on the list again. I said, I\u2019ll go out, and\nyou know, eventually I\u2019Il come back here. He said, kid, you leave here, you\u2019re\nnever coming back again. And he was right, of course. I \u2014 I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t dictate to\nthe army where I go.

So, before the break, we were talking about your first days and weeks in\nthe military, and how you were in this wonderful band, but that you did not feel\nright staying at it, and asked that your name be put on the list to be called up for\nbasic training. Take us from there. Tell us where you went, and what this training\ninvolved.",
        "A: Well, so shortly after I made that determination, that I was \u2014 I was ready, I \u2014I\nwanted army life, I was put a \u2014 placed on an or \u2014 a shipping order, to be shipped\nout. And we took a very circuitous route. I don\u2019t know why in America, they felt\nthere may be threats, and we didn\u2019t go directly down to Alabama, but sort of\nweaved \u2014 weaved around. And I was told it was for security purposes. But we got to\nFort McClellan, deep into Alabama. And immediately I knew that I was going to\nhave a very, very hot summer.

What \u2014 what \u2014 one of the difficulties we had was that it was staffedJuly 14, 2015\nby what we called cadre, c-a-d-r-e, cadre. These are old-time army men who have\nbeen through the wars. And here was a bunch of young, college, smart-aleck kids\ncoming down. They were not going to let us get away with an easy training period.\nTraining was three months. They gave us the most difficult forced marches. One of\nthe \u2014 one of the ultimate requirements was that we march, fully loaded with\nequipment, backpacks, and all \u2014 all th \u2014 and all the \u2014 the equipment that we would\nnormally carry into battle. And we ru \u2014 march over Bain Gap. Bain Gap was a\nvery, very hilly mountain. And some had trouble making it. Certainly in the \u2014 in the\nhot temperatures in which we were marching. We did it. I think just not everybody\nmade \u2014 made the march. That irritated them, and they said, you\u2019re going back,\nyou\u2019re going to do it again. And they made us march over Bain Gap, twice.",
        "Q: The same day\u201d?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, we di \u2014 different dates.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But the \u2014 us-usually part of the training was for building your endurance, your\nability to survive in combat, where you have to do forced marches. But because we\nall made it, they \u2014 you know, thi-this was emotional, more \u2014 more than tactical. So,\nyou got to march again, so we had to go over it again. The obstacle courses they set\nup for us, were very, very difficult. Yeah, you\u2019re climbing walls out of \u2014 you \u2014 youJuly 14, 2015\nrun, cl \u2014 pull yourself on a rope, and go over. And jump over ponds, and you had to\njump far enough, otherwise you landed in the water. Rather tough exercises. So they\nput us through a very strenuous program. I believe at that time I \u2014 oh, I\u2014 I was a\nphysical en-enthusiast. I took the Charles Atlas bodybuilding course, because I was\nvery small, and I had to build up \u2014 if I was small \u2014 I may be small in stature, but I\nwill not be small in body and strength. So I took the Charles Atlas bodybuilding\ncourse, which was very popular at that time. So I had some things going for me\nalready. That, plus the training that we got at Fort McClellan, I \u2014 I think, to a large\nextent, saved my life later \u2014 later on. One of the difficult things that also happened\nat Fort McClellan, is that it was a\u2014 a \u20141t was a cu \u2014 a prisoner of war camp for\nGerman soldiers. And I didn\u2019t know, but they apparently, when they were captured\noverseas, some of them were sent over here, to s \u2014 to POW camps. Fort McClellan\nwas a POW camp. Now, their treatment of prisoners \u2014 our treatment of prisoners, I\nshould say, as opposed to theirs, very, very different. They \u2014 as we were marching\non the-these \u2014 these tough \u2014 these obstacle courses, the marches, they would stand\nin the fenced-in area, laughing at us, because we were being \u2014 we were the ones\nwho were being pushed, and they were living a \u2014 a wonderful life. They were\nbronzed. You know, they had no shirts, and they were absorbing the sun. They\ndidn\u2019t have to march in the sun, they just absorbed it. They had the rights to go toJuly 14, 2015\nthe post exchange, where they could get cigarettes, candy, any \u2014 anything that was\navailable. They were living wonderful lives, and there they were, ridiculing us, and\nlaughing \u2014 laughing at us. And so in \u2014 as I write, later on, I say, hm, but look at how\nthings turned out. The guy they were laughing at, turns out to have survived, and\nmany of them, I\u2019m sure, did not. That was compensation. So Fort McClellan,\nagain, was very difficult, but it did prepare us well for what lie ahead, and \u2014 lay\nahead. And then, after three months \u2014",
        "Q: How long did that last? Three months?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Three months?",
        "A: We\u2019ve had three months there, and really, it was a wa \u2014 it was a very good, a ver\n\u2014very good life. On Sunday mornings, we were pretty free, to do what \u2014 we could \u2014\nwe could go to the mess hall, and order up \u2014 what we used to order \u2014 to get at home.\nOn Sunday morning, get breakfast. I used to be able to go up and tell the chef \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t think we called them chef, we called them cooks, but I could tell him I wanted\neggs, bacon, toast on the side, yeah. Yeah. And we were getting that. And this was\narmy life? My gosh. It was a tough, tough camp, but sa \u2014 some of the relief on \u2014 on\n\u2014 on Sundays, made it palatable. The heat was so great, that it was not uncommon\nfor people to pass out on the parade ground, when we were being marched, and allJuly 14, 2015\nthat. And the only time in my life that I ever came about as close as you can get to\npassing out, I \u2014 I sustained myself. Hundred degree temperatures, sun pouring\ndown, and we\u2019re standing out in that sun, and we\u2019re marching and marching. And I\n\u2014I felt weakness, and I \u2014 I just didn\u2019t want to drop out. I remember getting to the\nbarracks, to the steps, and fine \u2014 just about making the few steps I had to my bed,\nand then throwing myself on my bed. But had the great satisfaction that I didn\u2019t\npass out on the parade ground. So again, very, very good, good basic training.\nTough but good, at Fort McClellan.",
        "Q: And after three months, what happened?",
        "A: Then we moved on. The army developed a \u2014 a program they called the Army\nSpecialized Training Program. It was to train soldiers, those who had some college\neducation \u2014 I believe that was the criteria that was used, you \u2014 you had to have\nsome education. You were being trained in one or two schools, either engineering \u2014\nthey always needed engineers, or foreign languages. Foreign languages would have\nbeen much more appropriate for me, because the last thing I \u2014 I \u2014 I was in \u2014 I was \u2014\nhad any talent for, was engineering. That\u2019s the way the army did things, though.\nThey always wanted to train you the army way, not some habit you might have\npicked up in civilian life. And so, because I knew nothing about engineering, that\u2019s\nthe school I went to. So, from Fort McClellan, I went to Alabama PolytechnicJuly 14, 2015\nInstitute. Later became Auburn University. We had a campus life, we \u2014 we lived\nin dorms on the campus. We still had marching drills, but we had classroom studies.",
        "Q: Was this training to be an officer as well, or \u2014 or was that still part of being a\nprivate?",
        "A: That came later on, when we \u2014 I\u2014 when we tried to go to officer candidate\nschool.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: [\u2019ll come to that in a \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 ina few minutes. Because it all started where we \u2014 where we\u2019re at now \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 at Auburn University. We \u2014 so we attended class. We didn\u2019t \u2014 we di \u2014 did\nmilitary drills, and \u2014 and got some lectures on military stuff. But we attended class.\nThe \u2014 they had to reach far and wide to get in st \u2014 enough instructors for those\nprograms. And I remember the instructor I had in engineering, was an English tea \u2014\nprofessor in college. So, he was only a few pages ahead of us. And some of the guys\nwho I was with, were really engineering oriented people, and they were being held\nback. For me it was o \u2014 okay, cause I knew nothing about engineering, but that\u2019s the\nway they did things. We \u2014 so, in addition to our studies, we had our weekendsJuly 14, 2015\nreasonably free. There were four of us from the New York area, people \u2014 people\nthat I knew, and we formed a \u2014 a group \u2014 like, we \u2014 we were what was a \u2014 musical\npromotors. We \u2014 on Saturday nights, we would have concerts. What were the\nconcerts? The big bands of the day were the \u2014 we had a-all on record, in my\ndormitory room, and we would invite everybody in, we\u2019d have drinks and \u2014 and \u2014\nand \u2014",
        "Q: Play music.",
        "A: \u2014 was just \u2014 huh? Music, we had music. And I remember the kickoff \u2014 I think it\nwas the kickoff concert we had, was \u2014 we called it an awa \u2014 it \u2014 it was the bu \u2014 the\n\u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the finest black musicians of their day. And there were many, many,\nreally some of the top, top musicians. And we had all them, you know, Count\nBasie, Duke Eli-Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald. You know, all the great, great artists.\nAnd \u2014 and that was all records, so people poured into the dormitory. So that was our\n\u2014 our release, our relief from the pressures we were under.",
        "Q: Here\u2019s a question. You grew up in Newark in a mixed community. It wasn\u2019t just\nJewish, it was also Gentile, it was also different ethnic groups, and so on. What\nabout army life? Were there \u2014 was \u2014 did you get exposed to people, and populations\nand different kinds of young guys that you never would have met otherwise, and\nwere they \u2014 how was that for you, and describe that a little bit.July 14, 2015",
        "A: Yes, because the people \u2014 th-those who \u2014 those of us that they brought together\nwere from all parts of the country, and so obviously we met new acquaintances,\nwho became some of the \u2014 who became buddies, and friends. And enemies, too.\nThe reason I knew that the \u2014 when I say enemies \u2014 the reason I knew that we were \u2014\nthat I had gotten some real good out of the training at Fort McClellan, was that\nwhile we were there, we had one guy, he was about \u2014 he was over six feet tall, well\nbuilt, and all that. And he was too \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what we called him, but too\nG.I. He \u2014 he \u2014 he fa \u2014 every \u2014 everything \u2014 the script \u2014 you had to be right,\nmilitarily do this right, march right, you know, everything like that. And it bothered\nthe other guys. I mean, we were normal \u2014 normal boys, you know, thrown into army\nlife, and he was very militaristic, and he got on their nerves. And one day, I\u2014 we\ngot into an argument, and I just was determined on ma \u2014 I\u2019m many inches shorter\nthan he, I\u2019m lots smaller, lighter in weight, but I\u2019m going to take this guy on. And I\ndid, and I beat him. You know, wrestling, and stren \u2014 very strenuous wrestling, and\nI brought him down. And \u2014 and \u2014 and the \u2014 and the guys cheered, you know, and \u2014\nand it helped build relationships. I remember his name, Bob \u2014 Bob Loring(ph).\nAnd I remember that. But the \u2014 anyway, so our experience there was interesting, but\nit was going nowhere. The battle losses in Europe were becoming very heavy.July 14, 2015",
        "Q: So \u2014 excuse me [coughing][break] So was this after D-Day? You were still in\nAlabama when Normandy was \u2014 you know, after D-Day on Normandy?",
        "A: June \u2014 that was June 6\", 1944.",
        "Q: Forty-four, yeah.",
        "A: Four \u2014 no, I think \u2014 I think on the landing \u2014 oh yeah, it had to be \u2014 yes, it had to\nbe after the landing, because our troops had \u2014 had landed, and they were engaged in\nbattle, acro \u2014 acro \u2014 across France, and all that, and our losses. Even though we\nmoved rapidly \u2014 the British and American forces did move rapidly after \u2014 they were\nbogged down in Saint-L6. And then after they broke out of there, and then they\nmoved right across. But the \u2014 1n doing so, the losses were heavy, and with those\nlosses building up, the army looked at programs like ASTP, and said, we have to\nabandon them, because we need ground troops overseas. So they did. And we were",
        "Q: ASTP was your engineering school.",
        "A: Engineering school, American special \u2014 Army Specialized Training Program.\nThe navy had a counterpart to that. The \u2014 so that program was to be abandoned, and\nwe were going to go into the infantry. That didn\u2019t sound very glamorous, so a whole\nbunch of us applied in two directions; one, to officer candidate school. Now, we \u2014\nwe didn\u2019t know at the time, if you \u2014 if you go to officer candidate school, youJuly 14, 2015\ngraduate, you become a lieutenant, a let \u2014 lieutenant\u2019s place was at the front, not in\nthe back. If you were a major, you could be in the back, but as a lieutenant, you\nwere more exposed than anybody else. But we just liked the idea. I did, anyway. I\nwanted to become an officer. And I always had \u2014 had second thoughts about that,\nbecause I was small. I wanted to be good. And I was so young. By this time, I was\n21. And I said, many of the people I will be leading, though, many of these guys,\nthey\u2019re going to be older than I, they\u2019re going to be bigger than I, and I \u2014 can I\ncommand their respect? It was \u2014 there were doubts that I had. But nevertheless,\nrather than fight in the \u2014 in the ground \u2014 ground \u2014 in the ground troops, it would be\nnice to be an officer. And the other thing that we went for, air ca \u2014 air cadet \u2014 the air\ncadet academy in \u2014 it was in \u2014 in Georgia. We a \u2014 I just became fascinated, and\nmost of us did, with aircraft. Like, you wouldn\u2019t have to be on the ground, and in\nthe mud, and all that, you\u2019d be flying in the air. You know, like 1t was a\u2014a-\u2014 an\neasy job. It certainly wasn\u2019t. The dangers that they were exposed to were as bad as\nanything on the ground. But anyway, a whole group of us applied for both. I\nremember going to the interview for a \u2014 for a\u2014 to become an officer. It was the\nmost austere setting I can ever, ever remember. I walk into this room, and all I see is\na long, long table, as far as I can see, of men sitting. Brass, all officers, high-rankingJuly 14, 2015\nofficers. I\u2019d never seen so much brass in my \u2014 in my life. And not a smile on\nanyone\u2019s face.",
        "Q: Oh gosh.",
        "A: And I had to be interviewed by them. I\u2019m 20 \u2014 you know, 21 years old, I had\nnever been subjected to anything like that. It was grueling, but I think I did well,\nand I think everybody thought they did well enough. On the \u2014 then we had to take\nwritten exams. We never did find out how we did on the written exams. During that\nsame time, I don\u2019t rem-remember who was there before or after, we applied to \u2014 to\ngo to air \u2014 the air academy and become fliers. So we did the same thing there, appli\n\u2014 applied there. In each \u2014 oh, and \u2014 and we became so infatuated with aircraft, that\nwe s \u2014 instead of doing our studies at ASTP, at night we\u2019d run through the halls,\nflying like planes. You know, we\u2019re young guys still, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re airplanes now.\nAnd we learned the silhouettes of every plane. We could identify every American\nand every German plane. Which was important to know, whether it\u2019s your enemy\ncoming at you, or one of your \u2014",
        "Q: One of yours.",
        "A: \u2014 or one of your \u2014 one of your own. So, w-we \u2014 we were all air-minded by that\ntime. We were all ready to go off to the air. As it turned out, because of the huge\nneeds now overseas for ground troops, both programs were canceled, and we\u2019re all\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nsent on our way. We went to \u2014 oh, oh, for \u2014 for \u2014 for more \u2014 now, combat training,\nfirst was basic training, combat training, so I then \u2014 I was sent to \u2014 to Indiana,\nCamp Atterbury in \u2014 near Indianapolis, in Indiana. And there were got combat\ntraining. I learned to be able to, in the dark, strip down my \u2014 strip down and put\ntogether my rifle. You had to be ab \u2014 you had to be able to do that, because who\nknow \u2014 under battle conditions, it may be nighttime, and yet your battle \u2014 your \u2014\nyour rifle was your best friend in combat. If you were without that, you were in\ntrouble. So we learned to do that. But one of the things that the army did again, as\nthey did with ASTP, they assigned you to units in which you had no experience. I\nwas assigned to the motor pool. I knew not much more about an automobile engine\nthan the fact that \u2014 I knew there was a carburetor, I knew there were spark plugs,\nand I knew somewhere, something created a spark, and that ignited the gasoline,\nand that created the power. That\u2019s all I knew, but I \u2014 about wha \u2014 what was under\nthe hood, I never had any experience with. So I\u2019m assigned to the motor pool. So in\naddition to ki \u2014 getting combat training, I got training in mechanics, and that. And\nso that \u2014 that\u2019s what I did for a very, very short time. Again, they had to abbreviate\nit, because we\u2019re now needed overseas. So I shipped out of there.",
        "Q: When?",
        "A: Oh, I just don\u2019t remember whe-when it was.July 14, 2015",
        "Q: Was it the fall of 44?",
        "A: Fall of \u201944?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Forty four? Probably so. Probably so. See, I landed on Omaha Beach in\nSeptember \u2014 let me see, the initial landing was 19 \u2014",
        "Q: Forty-four?",
        "A: \u2014 44.",
        "Q: June. So three months later.",
        "A: June, for \u2014 three months exactly. Three months later, in September, when I\nlanded on Omaha Beach. But \u2014 so we were \u2014 we were shipped out.",
        "Q: Direct from the States, or through England, through the U.K.?",
        "A: No, to the U.K. We shipped out from Fort Meade, Maryland, and sailed on the\n\u2014 oh dear, dear \u2014 a bri \u2014 a \u2014 a British luxury line \u2014 liner. Which was an indication of\nhow everybody, everybody, every business, every everything \u2014 everything was\ndevoted to the war. General Motors stopped making automobiles, they made tanks,\ninstead. The luxury bo-bo-boats were converted into troop carriers, and so I was on\nthis luxury troop carrier. We sailed overseas, and landed in \u2014 landing in Liverpool.\nWhen we got to liver \u2014 to Liverpool, that was just a weigh station, waiting to take\nus across the English channel. We made it to Liverpool, and I remember standing\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nup on the deck and looking down, and there were people holding newspapers, s \u2014\nMauritania, the SS Mauritania, which what we sailed on, SS Mauritania sunk.\nWell, there \u2014 there were Nazi submarines all across the Atlantic, and the navigators\non those ships had to weave their way across to try to avoi-void them. Many of our\ntr \u2014 many of our supply carrier ships were \u2014 were \u2014 were bombed, wa-was \u2014 were \u2014\nwere destroyed in the Atlantic Ocean, never getting overseas. And some troop\ncarriers were hit. But anyway, we get there, and th-the paper said, Mauritania\nsunk. And we\u2019re looking down, we\u2019re here. So we trained a little bit more.",
        "Q: So that meant you had been on the Mauritania before it was sunk?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t sunk.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t sunk, okay.",

        "Q: Scoop.",
        "A: And there were to defy his scoop. So, we did land, and we trained a li-little bit\nmore in Liverpool, and then set sail on a Liberty ship, across the English channel.\nNow, we were to link up with units we were going to battle with \u2014 that we wereJuly 14, 2015\ngoing to battle for \u2014 with. And sailing across the English channel was not a simple\nthing. You started off in a Liberty ship, which 1s a very small, small version of\nthese large, bi-big ocean liners. Started off in one of those. But to get to shore, you\nhad to go \u2014 you had to descend from that ship, to an LST, yeah, a landing ship tank.\nThere was different versions of that, they were called different names, but I think\nthe one we were on was an LST. And you probably have seen pictures of landing\ntroops during D-Day \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 those \u2014 those little boats that came into shore, as close as they could get, then\nthese big doors come down.",
        "Q: Correct.",
        "A: And then the soldiers are off, into the water. St \u2014 the big \u2014 the most difficult part\nof that trip was fir-fir-first of all recognizing, you know, now \u2014 now, this 1s for real,\nbecause you \u2014 you \u2014 your \u2014 you\u2019re di \u2014 you\u2019re going to face the enemy pretty soon.\nNow you have gas masks, rifles on \u2014 on your \u2014 on your shoulders, and on your\nback. And so this is \u2014 this is combat. The treacherous part of that trip was the\nexchange you made from the liberty ship, down to the LST, because you had to\nclimb down on a net. And we were warned in advance, one false step, and it may\nmean your life. So you had to place each foot perfectly. We had about 30 pounds ofJuly 14, 2015\nequipment on our backs; rifles, gas masks, everything we would carry into battle.\nSo, you had to si \u2014 watch your step. I was very, very careful. Some did not make it.\nI heard stories about many on D-Day who slipped and fell between the ships. Now,\nthe little ship 1s bobbing, and there \u2014 the two ships are crashing together. Some were\ncrushed before they ever even got to shore. So I climbed down cautiously, and got\ninto the ship. Now, for some strange reason, this \u2014 I mentioned earlier, this group\nwith me at \u2014 that ran the concerts, the \u2014 one of them was with me yet. He turned out\nlater in life to be in adver \u2014 an advertising executive for one of the big advertising\nfirms in New York. But he wa \u2014 he was that kind of a person. For some reason he\nbought a camera, he brought a camera. We\u2019re going into combat, and Herb has a\ncamera. And he says, Bob, tell you what to do. As soon as that door goes down, I\u2019m\ngoing to be right up front, I\u2019m going to get off first, and then I want you to come\nout, and I\u2019m going to take a picture of you landing on Omaha Beach. And he did.\nHe got a \u2014 and the \u2014 and the door goes down, you know. And this \u2014 this is crazy,\nreally crazy thi-thinking, to begin with. You\u2019re going into combat, maybe just hours\naway from the enemy, and you\u2019re taking a photograph. Anyway, Herb did take that\nphotograph. I never did see it. Along the way, we separated, he went to another unit,\nand \u2014 and I saw him in New York after the war, and Herb \u2014 he was with a big\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nadvertising company.

        "Q: Yeah, they\u2019re so adventurous.",
        "A: We were not \u2014 we were not yet mature soldiers. It would take a little seasoning,\nunder ca \u2014 under combat conditions, for us to wise up to what it was all about. And\nthat, as a matter of fact, was characteristic of my early days in combat. I still did not\nrecognize that this is a very serious business. But anyway, I was assigned to the six\n\u2014 sixth armored, and we did land, climbed that route up in the mountains. Enemy\nfire was not too far away. I was assigned to the Sixth Armored Infantry Division.\nWe rode half-tracks.",
        "Q: What\u2019s that?",
        "A: Half-tracks are \u2014 are vehicles that have \u2014 they have an area \u2014 there\u2019s the \u2014 the\ndriver\u2019s ca \u2014 ca \u2014 ca \u2014cabin. Next to the driver sits the officer in charge, and the\ndriver \u2014 and then there\u2019s an ope \u2014 big open area, wall \u2014 sides on \u2014 on the thing, but\nit\u2019s open on the top, and there are benches on each side. Anywhere from four to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\neight \u2014 eight, four on each side, would sit in that. The back end had tracks, just like\n\u2014likea-\u2014a-",
        "Q: A tank.",
        "A: \u2014a tanks. They had those kind of tracks, and wheels in the front. But the tracks\nto give tr-traction, and the wheels to be able to guide and make quicker turns than a\ntank could make. And that was our \u2014 that was our home. That\u2019s wha \u2014 where we\nfought from.",
        "Q: Oh, wow.",
        "A: Until they became obsolescent. And I\u2019Il explain that in a \u2014 in a\u2014 1n a moment.\nBut anyway, there we were, and we were assi \u2014 and I \u2014 I was assigned to that \u2014 to A\ncompany in tha \u2014 1n a platoon, and \u2014 and to that half-track. First days in combat, it\nwas, you know, it was still \u2014 still not real yet.",
        "Q: This was still in France, though?",
        "A: We\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re in France now. Now we\u2019re driving across France to engage the\nenemy. We \u2014 the first day in camp, we are shelled by enemy forces. And those\nshells come over. It\u2019s a frightening feeling, but I still \u2014 still, 1t didn\u2019t register on me\nyet, because they \u2014 they passed over \u2014 the ones you hear are okay, the \u2014 you know,\nthey pass \u2014 they passed you. The ones that hit you are the ones you don\u2019t hear. You\ndon\u2019t hear the ones that hit you, because that \u2014 that sound passing overhead doesn\u2019tJuly 14, 2015\nget there. They \u2014 they come right at you. Anyway, those shells were passing\noverhead. We had a ca \u2014 a few in our half-track who had fought 1n the north African\ncampaign, they were used to this. And they knew when shells come in, that\u2019s\ndangerous. And they jumped \u2014 dropped to the floor, and I \u2014 I looked, and I\nwondered why. Well, th-they \u2014 they knew what \u2014 the seriousness of it. I still didn\u2019t\nknow. We \u2014 there were some German soldiers came out of the woods, they were g1-\ngi-giving up, with their hands up, threw their rifles away. And we had a machine-\ngunner on our vehicle who was firing at them. And I yelled, we all yelled, stop,\nstop, they\u2019re surrendering. And so other troops, other American troops came by,\ntook them away, and we continued the \u2014 the \u2014 we were a-a-approaching enemy\nterri-territory, and shells started to come in. The last place you want to be in a half-\ntrack is on a road that\u2019s zeroed in by en-enemy heavy artillery. And so we pulled it\noff the road. Now, we\u2019re off the road, but we\u2019re still being shelled. We sought\ncover. I jumped out of the half-track, because we were targets in there, no \u2014 no \u2014 no\nroof. And I \u2014 I jumped be \u2014 on the be \u2014 and I lay down on the back end of that.\nSome of the other fellows were in the front. I waved to them, there in the front,\nlooking back toward us, under \u2014 under the front axle of the vehicle. And they\u2019re\nlooking \u2014 and I\u2019m waving, they\u2019re not waving back. And again, I still hadn\u2019t gotten\nthe reality of warfare. This is very, very serious business. And then I see themJuly 14, 2015\ntaking stretchers, some of our men had been hit. It begins to have an effect, I said,\nyou know, this is a \u2014 a serious business. The next morning, I found out how serious\nit was. We \u2014 we pulled into a field, there were tanks, and there are half-tracks, and\nwe were told to dig in. Mean, you \u2014 you build a bu \u2014 you dig a bunker. I was still\nnot oriented yet to military life. I was a defiant, young, 21 year old, and ah, bunker.\nYou know, we\u2019ll be moving on, and all the \u2014 all the effort of going through a\nbunker. I didn\u2019t dig a bunker. Shellfire is in the morning, early. We call it incoming\nmail. The enemy always strikes at dawn. Incoming mail, those are the bombs are \u2014\nthese \u2014 these shells are \u2014 are landing. All of a sudden, my rifle is blown out of my\nhand, my hand stings. I look at my rifle lying on the ground, there\u2019s a hole in the \u2014\nin the ba \u2014 in the barrel of the rifle. So, a shell \u2014 a shell pierced the rifle, could have\npierced me, but didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Close.",
        "A: Yeah, but a quick, quick lesson. Suddenly it hits me, this is very serious\nbusiness. Every moment you\u2019re out here on this \u2014 on this field or any other battle\nfield, your life is in danger. So, quick, quick realization. From somewhere,\nsomebody came up and handed \u2014 and ga-gave me a rifle. So now I was in combat. I\nnever, never disobeyed that command again, to di-dig when \u2014 when we\u2019re \u2014 whenJuly 14, 2015\nwe\u2019re stopped for a while, you dig yourself a foxhole, and it could save your life,\nwhich it did \u2014 did. So that was my introduction to combat.",
        "Q: Was that the first time you saw casualties, where you saw people being killed?",
        "A: It \u2014 1t was, and it was a strange, strange feeling. After a while, we abandoned the\nhalf-tracks, so we were on foot. And I remember proceeding on foot. We were\nfacing an enemy, we were firing, they were firing. The man in front of me, the man\nbehind me were both hit. And wa \u2014 my \u2014 first time I had seen anybody killed in\neven civilian life. And I stopped and I paused. Troops were moving on, and I just\npaused, and I looked at these two men, and I started to think, all the wonderful\nthings in life they will never see, never feel again. I \u2014 those thoughts just ran\nthrough my mind, not very formally, but tho \u2014 those kind of thoughts. And then I\nfound myself thinking about their families, they\u2019Il never be the same again, cause\nthe father, the brother, an uncle, aunt \u2014 an uncle, they were gone. And so, now I was\nreally introduced to warfare, and I took it very seriously from that \u2014 that point on.",
        "Q: Sounds like it was a wake-up call.",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was my wake-up call.",
        "Q: Yeah.July 14, 2015",
        "A: I realized this is it. You \u2014 you protect yourself, you go after the enemy, but don\u2019t\nforget about protecting yourself, because if you don\u2019t, you may end up like that.\nYou may end up anyway \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 like \u2014 like that.",
        "Q: Did you know their names?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you know who they were? Or they just happened to be in front of you?",
        "A: I think \u2014 I think I had some casual relationship with them, because we were, you\nknow, together. It\u2019s a casual relationship, but I don\u2019t think I knew much about e1-\neither of them.",
        "Q: Now, why is that you abandoned the half-tracks?",
        "A: Why did what?",
        "Q: Why did you abandon \u2014 why did \u2014",
        "A: The half-track?",
        "Q: Yeah, why would they abandon them?",
        "A: Because they were sitting targets. They\u2019re a v \u2014 a large enough vehicle, that you\ndon\u2019t have to be that accurate with shellfire. And whereas with troops \u2014 first of all,\ntroops have \u2014 have a way of separating, or getting into foxholes, and all that.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nThey\u2019re not quite tha-that kind of vulnera-vulnerability. But a half-track, sitting\nduck. It was a big enough vehicle to be a target, and \u2014 and they were hit \u2014",
        "Q: And a tank \u2014 and a tank has enough protection?",
        "A: A tank has much, much more protection. We had no protection. We had no \u2014 no\ntop. Tanks are \u2014 are \u2014 the armor 1s much, much thicker than we had, and they had\nprotection on all sides. So, we didn\u2019t have any of that protection. And that was just\n\u2014 those things that we rode in, those half-tracks, they were just vehicles to move us\nfaster. Otherwise, troops had to be moved by trucks, to get them up to s-speed, and\npart of \u2014 part of it was marching. But a good part of the time to get \u2014 get them up on\nbat \u2014 in \u2014 in the battlefield, was by truck. So, we had a lot of those trucks going. But\nyeah, we were too vulnerable, so we were the \u2014",
        "Q: Do you know where in France you were at this point?",
        "A: No, I had no idea.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No idea. Didn\u2019t \u2014 I do remember that one of the battles that we fought, and I did\nsee it on a map later on, was the Battle of hans \u2014 hi \u2014 Han-sur-Nied, h-a-n-s-u-r-n-\ni-e-d. It was the first real, big battle that we, the unit that I was with, faced. We had\nto cross the Hans-sur-Nieds river. The Germans \u2014 we had driven the Germans over\nthat river.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015",
        "Q: It sounds like a German, or a Belgian ka \u2014 or a Flemish kind of name, rather than\na French one.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, do \u2014 I don\u2019t even reca \u2014 we \u2014 we were in France yet, but I don\u2019t\nremember any more of it than that \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 just what it was called [indecipherable] and the river was named \u2014 what then\n\u2014 was named after the river. The Germans had just retreated over that river, and\nthey were sitting up on a hill above, and zeroed in right on the spot. A \u2014 very, very\neasy to zero in on any troops, or any vehicles certainly, coming across. So we\ncrossed \u2014 and I remember scuttlebutt among the troops was that we\u2019re going into a\nvery dangerous battle. How we knew, or how they knew, I do \u2014 I don\u2019t know, but a\nvery dangerous battle. We have to cross a river up there, and we think the odds of\ngetting across are not very great. So here\u2019s my introduction really, to combat\nconditions. So we \u2014 we did go on \u2014 on foot. We crossed the river.",
        "Q: Over a bridge?",
        "A: There was a \u2014 a \u2014 it was a \u2014 a structured bridge, structured by probably the\nGerman troops, I don\u2019t \u2014 yeah, they had to be by the German troops, but as\nstructured for hev \u2014 strong enough to carry vehicles across. So we crossed that\nbridge, facing enemy fire as we \u2014 as we did. And they retreated, we dro \u2014 drove\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nthem back, and the battle was \u2014 was an accomplishment, and it was a je \u2014 the\ngeneral \u2014 a famous general, Third Army.

We were operating within the thir \u2014 his Third Army. But\nit was a\u2014a-\u2014a victory. And then, obviously, we moved on from there.",
        "Q: What was the weather like at that point?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember it very well. I don\u2019t think it was yet what we \u2014 it was probab \u2014\nwe were probably in November weather, October, November, as we fought. So it\nwasn\u2019t real cold yet. That was about to come, as we moved into December, and\nheaded toward my next major battle. And that turned out to be the Battle of the\nBulge.",
        "Q: Okay, before we get there, as you\u2019re crossing the river, and the German army is\nretreating, were you involved in combat, or was it there was \u2014 there were m \u2014\nsoldiers and infantry in front of you who were engaging with them, and you were\nfollowing behind?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember where I was positioned, but we were firing.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we were firing on the enemy, and they were retreating. We moved through\nwith a \u2014 with a heavier force, apparently, and because the bridge was built strongJuly 14, 2015\nenough, our tanks were able to get through, too. So, the Germans were being\nsubjected to heavy fire.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to piece this together as best as I can remember \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: \u2014 and a lot of it is very vague.",
        "Q: I can imagine. I can imagine, yeah.",
        "A: But \u2014 but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m thi \u2014 thinking two things. One, that I remember precisely,\nthe other I\u2019m estimating what we must have been doing at \u2014 at the time, how we\nmust have been fi-fighting then. They were retreating, so we must have been firing",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014a lot of heavy stuff at them \u2014 at them. So, that went on, and \u2014 and \u2014 and battles\ncontinued until December 16, 1944.",
        "Q: And what happened then? What happened?",
        "A: That was \u2014 that was the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the Germans have been driven back that far.\nThis was their last major, major thrust. And that was to turn their \u2014 that was in their\nview, to turn the tide of battle against the allied forces. And our forces were arrayed\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nnorth and south along \u2014 alo \u2014 a long, long, long corridor, so to speak. And that was\ntheir major thrust.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know it at the time, did you?",
        "A: Didna \u2014 didn\u2019t \u2014 had no idea what it was, and what it was going to be called. All\nwe knew, that we were facing heavy, heavy artillery.",
        "Q: And you were \u2014 were you in Belgium, or were you still in France? Where wer \u2014\nwhere do you think you were?",
        "A: I\u2014I was in \u2014 in Belgium, very southern tip of Belgium, near Bastogne, in \u2014\nnear \u2014 right outside of Marvie, m-a-r-v-i-e, Marvie, Belgium, southeastern corner,\njust above Germany, just north of Germany. And so, heavy, heavy shellfire poured\nin on us. We were bogged down. The unit that I had \u2014 the \u2014 the company \u2014",
        "Q: Were you in a field, in a forest, in a town?",
        "A: Lots of forests. It was \u2014 it was called \u2014 th-the battle itself, I had fought through\ntwo other major battles across France, this was my third battle. It was called the\nArdennes campaign, because it was being fought in the Ardennes forest, heavily\ntreed. And that was southeastern Belgium, and northwe \u2014 northeastern Germany.",
        "Q: Northwestern, excuse me for correcting, but just for the future, northwestern\nGermany. Cause the east would be near Poland.July 14, 2015",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, oh of \u2014 oh, of \u2014 oh, of course. Of course northwestern Germany,\nof course.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The surprise \u2014 and what \u2014 the \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I was \u2014 I learned to believe, let\u2019s\nsay, from what I read later on, that the Americans expected a major thrust, because\nthe Germans could be driven just back \u2014 back just so far. And they had tremendous,\nheavy artillery. Their tank corps were probably superior to the American. And so I\nth \u2014 I believe that our top command expected that, but nevertheless, the \u2014 the\nmagnitude of the attack was just overpowering. The company that I had trained\nwith, the 106\" infantry division, in the U.S., on that first day of battle, lost 75\npercent of its troops, killed, wounded or captured, or missing. Seventy-five percent\nin one day. The word was that that division that I trained with \u2014 and I left early, to\nbe shipped over as a replacement, they were not ready yet for combat. They were\ngreen. And you read the accounts of \u2014 of \u2014 of that unit, the 106\" infantry division,\nand you realize how poorly prepared they were. They were scattered, they ran in all\ndirections. Some of them shot their own men. They were just firing at anything they\nsaw. They were such in \u2014 in that kind of disarray. And I hate to think about that\nwith an American unit, particularly one that I trained with. But nevertheless, the\nGermans were well-equipped, well trained, well prepared, and they \u2014 they \u2014 andJuly 14, 2015\nthen they \u2014 they drove 1n-into us. The report that I read later on, when I was\nreported missing in action, was that the unit I was with had been subjected to heavy\nenemy fire. And in the process, troops were scattered, and got lost. And thus, I was\nreported missing in action, because I was \u2014 I was not present, not account \u2014\naccounted \u2014 I couldn\u2019t be accounted for.",
        "Q: So, what happened to you?",
        "A: Ah, that\u2019s \u2014 see, they didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t have that \u2014 they didn\u2019t have that. All\nthey knew was that I was \u2014 I was missing. When you tally up your troops afterward,\nyou say, this guy\u2019s missing. They had no idea what happened to me. We had been\nfighting, the German attacked, and I was with the unit, I was on the line, I was\nfighting. We were face to face with the enemy, we were fi-fighting. And then I and\nothers were \u2014 were ordered back behind the lines, because this had been going on\nfor days, and I was weary. So yeah, they figured the troops need some rest, go back\nbehind the lines, get some rest, get some food, and then you\u2019ll resume later on. So\nwhen I got behind \u2014 behind the lines, I was now with all allied forces, the ger \u2014\nGermans were far removed, I heard somebody say, we need volunteers. We\u2019ve lost\nradio contact. The Germans have apparently knocked out our radio contact with\nfront line troops. So we have to establish where our \u2014 our lines are. We need vala \u2014\nvolunteers to do that. I was still 21, I think, so I was young, and adventurous. I\u2019dJuly 14, 2015\njust begun to learn what war was about. But I also felt that 1t was a mission.\nSomething moved me, and \u2014 and I said, yeah. So Pll vol \u2014 Pll volunteer. I saw a\nJeep in the di \u2014 in the distance, and I said, I'll get that Jeep. And I signaled to five\nothers, and they joined me. We said, we \u2014 we \u2014 we'll be a volunteer task force,\nwe'll go as far as we can go, and see if we can identify where our lines are. High\ncommand cannot pri \u2014 plan strategy, unless they know where the lines are. So,\nthat\u2019s what we started out to do. So, we\u2019re in this Jeep, it\u2019s now \u2014 the vision is not\nvery clear, it\u2019s an overcast sky. I remember driving the Jeep, the roads are covered\nwith 1\u2014 snow and ice. We round a curve, and just about \u2014 maybe about 10 to 15\nyards ahead of me, there\u2019s a German 88 millimeter cannon pointed right at the Jeep,\nright at us. And it\u2019s mounted on an 80 \u2014 on a\u2014 a\u2014 a German ta-tank. And so, you\nknow, anybody pulled that trigger, we were gone. And I can talk, and I do talk man\n\u2014many, many times, the number of times that you are exposed to killing, to being\nkilled, and that was \u2014 that was one of them, and there were many, many others. So\nit\u2019s, you know, miracles take place, and you don\u2019t get killed. But that was one that\nthey certainly \u2014 somebody should have pulled the trigger, and we would have been\ngone. They didn\u2019t. I jammed on the brakes, we skidded off the road. All of a\nsudden, fire from rifles \u2014 apparently mi \u2014 rifles and machine-guns, small arm fire, is\npouring in from our right. And we \u2014 none of us were hit immediately. I \u2014 I say, we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nhave to \u2014 we have to defend ourselves yet. Have to find something, we can\u2019t do it\nfrom the Jeep here. We see a shack across the road, and I say, we move toward that\nshack. We did. One of the men had the perception to real-realize, we go near the\nmachine-gun \u2014 some \u2014 somebody\u2019s firing a lot of \u2014 lot of ri-rifle fire at us, or\nmachine-gun fire. So he too \u2014 he detached the one from the Jeep, and brought that\nwith us. So we start racing for the shack. One of our men is hit and killed on the\nway over. We get to the shack, and the enemy fire is still pouring in. We have to set\nup the machine-gun, some way, to fire back. And so there\u2019s a big bay window in the\nshack. The man who took the machine-gun, I think it was him, he sets it up in the\nwindow, and he starts firing. Within maybe a minute or so, he\u2019s hit, and he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s\nkilled. When I talk to student groups, I \u2014 I say sometimes people \u2014 un-understand,\nyou do things under battlefield conditions, you do things you would not normally\ndo, because you do it on your instinct. Something tells you that you have to take \u2014\nyou have to do something right now. So, my instinct, without thinking about the\nconsequences, I was wide open, I would be killed just like the other man was, your\ninstinct 1s a \u2014 1s a\u2014 jump behind that gun. Which is what I did, and I started firing.\nAnd I fired the machine gun at everything I saw move. I hit some, probably killed a\nnumber of their men. And that went on \u2014 that had started early in the morning \u2014 that\nwent on until late in the afternoon, we\u2019re running out of fire. We didn\u2019t \u2014 we had no\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nidea what we were against, at the time. I learned later on that there were at least a\nhundred \u2014 somewhere between a hundred and 200 si \u2014 over there, dug in, in\nfoxholes. And we were \u2014 we started out with six of us, one was killed immediately,\nso there were five of us, fighting them, and for a good part of the day. That\nmachine-gun really kept us going. When we ran low on ammunition, we had to\ndevise some strategy, how do we get out of this? We had two wounded. There was\nanother window, so two a \u2014 two of them were hit. I \u2014 I looked, and I saw a trap door\nin the floor of this shack, meaning there must be a cellar beneath. So the strategy\nwas simply this; we had to make them believe that they killed us off, or that we \u2014\nwe \u2014 we took off toward our \u2014 our rank, toward our \u2014 our la \u2014 our American and our\nBritish lines. And so, I figure, we'll climb down into this cellar, and then when it\u2019s\ndark, under cover of darkness, we\u2019ll emerge. If we can take those two wounded, we\nwill certainly do that, we certainly wanted to do that. And we \u2014 so that was the \u2014\nthat was the idea. We would infiltrate through their lines at night, under cover of\ndarkness, we possibly could do that.",
        "Q: So there were two of you who were not wounded yet?",
        "A: Ah, well there were \u2014 we started out with six, five me \u2014 six, one was hit. So there\nwere five of us. So there \u2014 there were two wounded, and three able-bodied. So we \u2014\nthat wa \u2014 that was the strategy, then we would come out and make our way back\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nthrough the lines. Because we had no ammunition, we absolutely ran out of a-\nammunition. Of about \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t know, it was about a half hour or so \u2014 no way to\nmeasure time, but I figured somewhere around there, I push open that trap door,\nmaybe we could come out now, maybe it\u2019s dark now, and what I saw \u2014 and I always\ntell people when I \u2014 when I talk to them, there\u2019s some things in battle, 11 combat, or\ncaptivity, that you don\u2019t remember, that you block out, and some of them are\nblocked out of your mind. Either you don\u2019t ca \u2014 you don\u2019t remember them, or you\ndon\u2019t want to remember them. Some that you have a vague re \u2014 recollection of, and\nothers that remain visible to you, perhaps for the rest of your life, as this one does\ntoday. So as I stand before you now, I can tell you, I see that rim of black, automatic\nguns, all pointed down, right at my face. And behind each of those guns is a white-\ncloaked, camouflaged German soldier, holding that gun, trigger finger poised, ready\nto fire at any moment. [doorbell]",
        "Q: Let\u2019s cut. [break] All right, so \u2014 so be-before the interruption, we\u2019re at a\nmoment that is defining. You open up this trap door, and you see these gun barrels\npointed at you, and behind them are these white, camouflaged soldiers.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: The enemy. What happened?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015",
        "A: The \u2014 the view is still \u2014 still vivid, right here til \u2014 to \u2014 to this day, what are we,\n70 years later, I can still see them there, stark as can be, in addition to all those \u2014\nthose guns, pointed right at me, the stark nature of the black against the white. And\nthey motioned, come up. And so we come up, and we take the wounded up with us.\nWhat \u2014 for whatever reason, they \u2014 this German sergeant takes me aside, the others\ntake the other Americans, and they\u2019re off. I never see them again, and the German\nsergeant is in charge of me now. And he\u2019s got a rifle barrel in my back, pushing me\naround. Usher him around the shack, to make sure there are no booby traps there,\nand then he pushes me, rifle in the back, across the road. This road, as I write about\nit, I call the moat. It was like a moat, it was \u2014 separated us, one from the other, and\nW-w-we were in our castle, that little shack, and the moat protecting us from the\nenemy. But we crossed the road, and just then \u2014 we get onto the other side, and just\nthen, art \u2014 heavy artillery comes in. I never knew, and don\u2019t know to \u2014 to \u2014 today,\nwhether it was British or American, but it\u2019s coming in. We had called for it early in\nthe day, and now it just starts coming in. It\u2019s dusk, it\u2019s \u2014 nightfall is coming on, and\nthese shells are landing. The German sergeant jumps into his bunker, his foxhole,\nand I motioned to come down. Nein, nein, he said, nein, nein, nein, nein, nein,\nnein. No, he would not let me come down. I need some shelter. I\u2019m now being\nexposed \u2014 remember, it\u2019s the Ardennes forest, trees all around, and that\u2019s one ofJuly 14, 2015\nthe worst things you can have, because you get shell blasts when those things hit,\nand that \u2014 that pieces of hot metal come pouring down at you. All you need is a\npiece in the wrong place, and your \u2014",
        "Q: You\u2019re gone.",
        "A: \u2014 you\u2019re dead.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that\u2019s the nature of things. I \u2014 I \u2014 I keep thinking of it so often \u2014 people\nremind me sometimes 1n talking, you had so many opportunities to die. That was\nanother one. I mean, the fact that you weren\u2019t hit, with all these shells coming in,\nwas amazing. Anyway, so the German is in his bunker, and the shellfire 1s coming\nin. I say to him, what are you going to do with me? I figure he doesn\u2019t \u2014 he speaks\nGerman. And he looks up at me, and he says, I have to kill you. In English. So here\nit is, the good fortune, you get a German who s \u2014 soldier who speaks English. So\nnow, you can converse. I have to kill you. The assumption is that he will. He\u2019s\ngoing to turn his rifle on me, and he will shoot.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s what he would have done, had he not been interrupted.",
        "A: Chances are yes, because the order had been issued, high command. This is late\nin the war now, and they\u2019re not to take any more allied prisoners alive. They just\ncan\u2019t cope with them. They have to deal with the enemy. So they just shoot them.July 14, 2015\nWe\u2019re not going to house them, and feed them. So, not to be taken alive. My\nassumption was, he was going to pull his gun, and fire.",
        "Q: I want to interrupt at one point, before we go on. Do you have any kind of\nthinking on why you were separated out? The four were taken by other guys, and\nwhy you were separated out?",
        "A: I think was pure chance.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Just the way we were set up, the others were sort of together, and somebody just\nmoved them away, and I was left with him. I think just chance.",
        "Q: And do you think they were then shot?",
        "A: I have no idea. I just don\u2019t know what happened to them. They might have been,\nbecause again, the order had been issued. They weren\u2019t \u2014 they just weren\u2019t taking\nany prisoners alive any more. They couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t afford to do that. So, that\nwas it, and when he said, I \u2014 I have to kill you, I assumed he would turn his rifle on\nme, and I looked down the road. Now, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s night, it\u2019s dark. There\u2019s a burning\ntank in a field nearby. And the ro \u2014 and that road we crossed over is lit up. Also at\nthe side of the road, at their side, I see these bunkers, one after another. And I see\ntwo silhouettes on each bunker, one is a German helmet, and the other is a machine-\ngun. So I know, that as far as I could see, the \u2014 there were bunkers. I had been aJuly 14, 2015\nsprinter in school, and I just, very, very briefly thought, my gosh, all that running\nexperience, if ever there was a time to use it, this is it. And I was gonna sprint dow\n\u2014 try to get out into the road and sprint down that road. Then I suddenly realized,\nyou'd be shot out of the starting block. They had all these guns trained on you. I\nmean, there was no way you could es \u2014 you could escape. Behind me, if I tried to\nrun there, there were guards there. There were other foxholes, so I \u2014 it was just no\nplace to go. And so I\u2014I se \u2014 I realized I had \u2014 the only option I had was\nconversation. But I\u2019m talking to a German. And so, what he \u2014 and then I\nremembered, just a moment ago he said, I have to shoot you, this man speaks\nEnglish. Maybe we can converse, and you know. So he says \u2014 he looks up at me \u2014\nwe pau \u2014 we paused for a while. I\u2019ve given up the idea of running. He looks up and\nhe says, why are you Americans here? This is not your war. I said, how \u2014 I said, you\nmade it our war, how can you say that? Conversation goes on. The reason that I\nthink this sequence would be so good on film, as opposed to just in print, you know,\nyou have to see a relationship developing between this German soldier, and this\nAmerican soldier. I\u2019m his captive, he\u2019s supposed to shoot me, and he doesn\u2019t.",
        "Q: What did he look like? Do you remember what he looked like?",
        "A: The one thing I don\u2019t remember, because I kept seeing that helmet on the \u2014 he\ndidn\u2019t look up all the time, like that. Sometimes he was looking straight ahead, andJuly 14, 2015\nwe were talking. And I\u2014I comment on that in my book, that while lying in the\nhospital and thinking of some of these events that occurred, I try to remember his\nface, and I can\u2019t, because again, I saw so little of it. Maybe his chin under that\nhelmet, but not the whole face. And the conversation goes on. He reaches down into\nhis pocket, and I figure he\u2019s got a pistol there. He\u2019s a noncommissioned officer,\nhe\u2019s probably allowed to carry a pistol, he\u2019s going to shoot me with a pistol instead\nof the rifle. Instead, he pulls out a wallet. He opens the wallet, and then he turns it\ntowards me, he shows me pictures of his wife and two children. And he says, next\nyear, we will be in New York City. That was his plan. He foresaw it. He was a\ngood Nazi, he believed that they were going to win the war, and he would \u2014 they\u2019d\ngo on vacation, and they\u2019d take, of all places in the world, New York City. To\nthem, it\u2019s like Paris is to us. And so, the conversation wears on, and we\u2019re talking.\nAnd I\u2014I ke \u2014I\u2014I feel a change in attitude. This guy is not the \u2014 he\u2019s not the\nenemy an-any more. And I don\u2019t think he sees me as the enemy either. And we\u2019re\ntalking. His English is more than good enough. I mean, I understand everything he\nis saying. And so, we converse. After a while \u2014 and as I say, attitude 1s changing,\nwe're \u2014 we\u2019re not antagonists. The way we were \u2014",
        "Q: Are the shells still falling?",
        "A: By this time, I think they had ceased. Yes, they had.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015",
        "Q: So, he\u2019s in the foxhole, and you\u2019re on the ground above it.",
        "A: I\u2019m standing above him, looking down.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re standing?",
        "A: I\u2019m standing. Oh yeah, I\u2019ve \u2014 I was completely vulnerable while the shells were\n\u2014 were landing. Oh, I \u2014 I was standing all the time. I didn\u2019t get an invitation to sit at\nthe edge of the foxhole and dangle my feet into it, nut \u2014 nut \u2014 you know, there was\nno \u2014 no invitation. I just \u2014 I stood all the time. But again, there\u2019s something\nchanging in our relationship. And finally, he looks \u2014 he looks up at me, he says, for\nyou, the war is over. And I assume he\u2019s going to turn his rifle on me, kill me. His\nnext statement is, I\u2019m going to send you to a prisoner of war camp. He knew, and he\nknew that I knew, in the POW camp, you don\u2019t have to fight any more, you get\nshelter, food, good treatment. They did \u2014 I\u2019m quite certain \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2014-I-\u2014I-\u2014I-\u2014I know\nthis, that they \u2014 they did follow the Geneva con \u2014 the rules of the Geneva\nconvention, and if I did go back to a prisoner of war camp, that I would not have to\nfight any more. And that was his way of ex \u2014 of recognizing gallantry. And he said\n\u2014 he went on to say \u2014 he says, we had many more men than you, but you fought\nwell. And as I said, how \u2014 I didn\u2019t think right at the moment, but later on when I \u2014\nwhen I thought back about that, what gallantry. You know, here\u2019s a German soldier,\nmy archenemy, and he\u2019s going to save my life, because he understood and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nappreciated the way we fought against these extreme odds. And he said, you killed\nmany of our men, but you fought well. And so he \u2014 he, in earnest, was about to save\nmy life. He orders over two guards to take me away. As they do, there\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re\nstopped along the way, and I can look \u2014 I can see by the things on the man\u2019s\nshoulder, or wherever they were, that he\u2019s an officer. And there\u2019s a German\nconversation that goes on. I don\u2019t know what the conversation 1s, but I soon\nrecognize what it was. No, I\u2019m not going to a prisoner of war camp, they don\u2019t take\nprisoners any more, I\u2019m going to become a slave laborer. Because one of the things\nthat they needed \u2014 and there were ma-many, a-as you well know, non-military men\nwho are forced into slave labor. And slave labor in many of the camps, existed.\nAnyway, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be.",
        "Q: And how do you understand this?",
        "A: What followed. I didn\u2019t understand what they were saying, but when I realized\nafterward, that no longer did I have those guards, somebody else took me, and\npushed me \u2014 al-always I \u2014 did I \u2014 rifle barrel was in the back, kept pushing me with\nthe rifle barrel, until suddenly, I\u2019m confronted with a bunch of soldiers; I don\u2019t\nrecognize the uniforms. As one of my friends, who\u2019s a historian told me, he a \u2014 he a\n\u2014 told me those were quite likely Russian troops, that had \u2014 then he describes how\nRussian troops would be in that area. And chances are they were, because they wereJuly 14, 2015\ncompletely foreign uniforms. They were not German, they were not British, they\nwere not American. And so I see all these uniforms, and others from different \u2014\nobviously some other countries involved in there. And I\u2019m pushed by rifle butt, and\nI \u2014 I fall to the ground. I see all these people around. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s all\nabout, I have no idea yet. So we \u2014 we sit there, we\u2019re sitting on snow, and finally, a\nrifle butt to the back again, up, and then the rife \u2014 he sort of motions up, up, and\nwe\u2019re into a forced march. Before they did that, though, they stripped me of my\nwinter coat, and the gloves. This is Germany\u2019s coldest winter on record. The\ntemperature during that period, I was told later, was between zero and five degrees\nFahrenheit. The coldest on record. So now I\u2019m going to go without any gloves, no\nwinter garments, just a thin jacket. That\u2019s it as I go ahead, forced marched with\nthese others.",
        "Q: Did they ever find identity papers on you? Did you have identity papers, did you\nhave \u2014",
        "A: All I had on me was my dog-tags that had a J. Some had a J, some had an H. I\nhad a J. I had two other things on me. One was a Mogen David, a Star of David, a\nJewish symbol, and the other was a miniature mezuzah, what we Jews put on our\ndoorposts. I wore them with my dog-tags. I was 21, and I was defiant. There was no\nway in the world that I was going to remove those. I was told, though I didn\u2019t see it,July 14, 2015\nbut I was told that some destroyed their dog-tags, because they didn\u2019t want to be\nidentified as Jews. But, I\u2014 I\u2014I1-I stuck steadfast to that, and I wore them. I didn\u2019t\n\u2014]\u2014J-\u2014J-\u2014TI didn\u2019t know what I \u2014 what I was getting into at this point, and nobody\nwas talking in English, so I had no idea where \u2014 where we were going, what we\nwere going to do.",
        "Q: Did they know you were Jewish?",
        "A: Not at that time, beca \u2014 remember this, they have \u2014 each \u2014 each of these soldiers\nhas a responsibility. Theirs was not ideology, theirs was not to eradicate all the Jews\nin the world. Theirs was to get work done. That work was rebuilding their railroads,\nbombed by allied planes. That was the only mission they had. So \u2014 but I didn\u2019t \u2014 I\ndid not know that. I did not know what we were going to be doing, what I wa \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t know what I was. I just knew that I was \u2014 I was thrust into something with a\nbunch of other men. I was nameless, numberless. I was just a body, working hands,\nand that\u2019s what I would be. And only later did I learn that I was there for slave\nlabor, and whether I lived or died, made no difference to them whatsoever.",
        "Q: How did you learn that you were there for slave labor? What told you that?",
        "A: Well, later on, when I saw what we were doing.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Now, it\u2019s ti\u2014 I don\u2019t know this yet.July 14, 2015",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we\u2019re being force marched. Darkness descends. When they took off my\ngloves and coat, I assumed that they were going to \u2014 I was a prisoner, I was their\nprisoner, I was going to go to a barracks someplace, and I\u2019d have shelter. That\nwasn\u2019t on \u2014 on their minds, at all. So when darkness fell, they motioned, down,\ndown, and pushed some of us down on the ground. On the ground. We\u2019re on a road.\nOff to the side they push us, and say \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what they said, but it was\nobvious we were going to lie there, and that\u2019s where we were going to sleep. The\nroads were covered, most of the time, with snow, or ice. Sometimes they\u2019re just\ndark, dirty \u2014 you know, dirt, you know, but most of the time was snow or ice. And\nthey had guards patrolling. That\u2019s where you spent the night. For the next 80 some\nodd, out of 90 nights, that\u2019s where I slept, without a coat, with no gloves, hands \u2014\nhands tucked in here, to try to keep warm. Toes moving constantly. Toes and\nfingers cons \u2014 constant movement. Otherwise, they would have frozen. Which they\ndid later anyway, I had frostbite. But this 1s one of the remarkable things that\nhappened during that period. Desperate, you\u2019re freezing, almost freezing to death,\nreally, because much more of that, and I would have. The only thing that could\nsustain me, was mental or emotional. And what I thought of was food. And one\nthing you never really want to think about when you\u2019re starving \u2014 I think everybodyJuly 14, 2015\nwould s \u2014 would s \u2014 would re \u2014 remember that, you don\u2019t think about food. But that\nhelped to sustain me. It\u2019s not only physical pain, but emotional pain that I was\ngoing through. And so, if I could draw some kind of an emotion, that would give\nme some hope for the future, maybe that would help to see me through whatever\nthis is that I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m getting 1n-into.",
        "Q: What did they feed you?",
        "A: What did they feed \u2014 feed me?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Crusts of dark brown bread. That was the standard. And that \u2014 most days \u2014 I\u2019m\nnot sure if we got that every day, but that was \u2014 that was the food. There were two\ncamps we passed through. Labor camps, not prisoner of war camps, but labor\ncamps. E-Even that would have been better than what we had. Cause I had the\nmaximum of exposure you could. But in the \u2014 in these camps, we \u2014 which we just\npassed through, only spent the day going through them, I remember in jeros \u2014 in\nPrum, p-r-u-m, Germany, a labor camp, we were given six, one inch in diameter\ncrackers, sort of dry cracker, and that was it for the day. We went on marching. We\ngot to Gerolstein in Germany, and there they gave us a can \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean a\ncanteen, the way the military has, but a ti \u2014 old \u2014 like an old, tin Campbell\u2019s soup\ncan. And old tin can, and in it was some hot water. There was a little piece of potatoJuly 14, 2015\nat the bottom, that was the flavoring. So that was called soup. And we drank that\nhot water, that was it for the day. I don\u2019t have to make any more clear than that how\nour \u2014 how our nutritional needs were not being met, and malnutrition set in rapidly,\nand you could feel it happening. But that essentially is \u2014 1s the \u2014 1s the amount of\nfood that we had.",
        "Q: How does one feel malnutrition? [technical interruption] How does one feel\nmalnutrition set in? What happens?",
        "A: You know \u2014",
        "Q: What happened to you?",
        "A: Consciously, you know, of course, that you\u2019re not being fed adequately. And just\nfrom logical standpoint, you begin to say that, you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 this can\u2019t go\non too long. So intellectually, you realize that something is going to be happening to\nyour body. Then you start to feel weakness. The marches are more difficult, they\u2019re\ngetting more and more difficult. You feel pain in your stomach, cause there\u2019s\nnothing to fill it, and that radiates through your body. So y-y-you \u2014 you know that\nthere\u2019re physical aspects taking shape now, and you know \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 I knew that\nbodies do deteriorate if you don\u2019t get \u2014 you know, I was brought up as a child, eat\nyour cereals, eat your vegetables, and so forth. You have to, to build your bodies.\nSo I knew I wasn\u2019t getting any of that, so my body had to deteriorate. After a whileJuly 14, 2015\n\u2014 that \u2014 that takes a lot of days, and maybe weeks before you really see it. And I\ncould feel my shoulders, they were very boney, and my arms were starting to lose\nsome of the flesh that they had. And so I began to realize that, yeah, there was some\nkind of deterioration going on here. But weakness probably was the greatest\nrecognition that I had, that something was happening to the body. Then, as we were\nbeing force marched, sometimes from location to location, when we worked on\nrailroads, people were dropping out along the way. And I realized that they were\ndropping out from weakness, from the malnutrition. Must be \u2014 must be a\u2014a\nchemical [indecipherable] condition, whatever it was. But they were \u2014",
        "Q: They were starving.",
        "A: \u2014 they were dropping along the way. Dropping out was not a good thing, because\nyou were no longer useful as a slave laborer, and so either \u2014 in some cases \u2014 why\nthey made the decision, I don\u2019t know, but in some cases, they left the man there to\ndie. In other cases, they shot the man. Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you see these things?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Did you see those things?",
        "A: I saw them. One of the \u2014 be-before I leave the subject altogether, I just want to\ngo back to that period of sleeping at night, and the food. And I thought about food.July 14, 2015\nIt sustained me emotionally, to be able to go on. Why? Because I figure someday\nI\u2019m going to get out of this, I d\u2014 I don\u2019t know how, but someday I will \u2014 I will \u2014\nthis will be over, and tho \u2014 and the wonderful foods \u2014 when you\u2019re starving, you\nthink about food. And I said, I ca \u2014 those wonderful foods, the things that my\nmother used to make, things we got in the pizza parlor. You know, all \u2014 all the\nwonderful thing, someday I\u2019m going to have that again. And that emotionally\nhelped to carry \u2014 carry me. So rather than \u2014 rather than drop out and die on th \u2014 on \u2014\non li \u2014 lying there, I was able to sustain myself with the belief that someday I would\nhave access to those foods. Months later, when I was hospitalized, I asked a nurse to\nbring me a little book \u2014 booklet of some sort that I could write on, I recorded that. I\nhave that here.",
        "Q: Oh wow.",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014I call it my little brown book. I recorded 84 foods. They\u2019re in that book, if\nyou want to see later, it\u2019s r\u2014 it\u2019s right in an envelope over there.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.July 14, 2015",
        "A: I have that book, along with the dog-tags with the Jewish emblems on them. I ha\n\u2014 have those here. So, might be nice to do that. But those \u2014 so I remembered the 84\nfoods, and that did, emotionally, it helped to sustain me.",
        "Q: I also \u2014 I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m interrupting, but I also have another question. You had\nsaid that your basic training in Alabama, in a hundred degree-plus heat \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 prepared you. Yet, when you were under the strain and you were in \u2014 captured,\nyou were at minus something Fahrenheit temperature. What about the basic\ntraining, then, was transferable from one climate to the other?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t the climate, but it was the bo \u2014 the strengthening of body.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They built our bodies, as I told \u2014 the exercise drills, were ve \u2014 were reasonably\nextreme. And so, I was probably in the best condition of my life, physi-physically.\nSo that\u2019s all. But wha-wha \u2014 what\u2019s \u2014 what\u2019s odd about that is that I went from the\nextremes in temperature in basic training, from a hundred \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 down to zero, you know.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015",
        "A: And that was \u2014 that was a gr \u2014 a great, great vari-variation. So these forced\nmarches went on. We stopped along the way, to work on the railroads, but to work\non the railroads, we had to move railroad tracks, long, heavy railroad tracks, one\narea to another. If their sup \u2014 to keep their supply line going to their troops, they\nhad to maintain the railroads. And so, we had to get tracks, sometimes from one\nabandoned railroad, to another that was in service, and needed. Mostly at night, we\nwere forced marched again, we had to carry those railroad tracks on our shoulders.\nNow, this is when I knew they \u2014 they became boney, because ri \u2014 they hurt. We\nwould carry them sometime, from one town to another, many miles. And I would\nhave one on my shoulder, and somebody in front would have ano \u2014 have the other\nend of it on his shoulder. So we had to carry those railroad tracks, town to town.",
        "Q: Did you ever speak with any of the other prisoners?",
        "A: Speech was not allowed, conversation was not allowed. If you \u2014 if they caught\nyou talking, they turned their gun on you. I don\u2019t remember seeing anybody shot,\nbecause we maintained the code of silence pretty well, I don\u2019t remember seeing.\nBut I have no doubt that if they \u2014 we were caught, we would have. What we did do\nthough, 1s to \u2014 when we could, when we saw there were no guards right around,\nwho could see it, we would exchange the sabotage work that we did on the\nrailroads. This was, again, youth, my youth, that I was yo \u2014 figures they\u2019re notJuly 14, 2015\ngoing to do this to me, I\u2019m not going to build anything that they can use. And the\nothers had similar attitudes. So, when we were required to build the railroads, these\n\u2014 these tracks, put them together, we didn\u2019t always line them up well. We didn\u2019t put\nthe pins in where they should. And that was with \u2014 with some pride, that we did\nthat. So, when we had the opportunity to exchange something, he \u2014 thi-this guy\nwould tell me what he did, and I would tell him, with delight, that I didn\u2019t put those\npins in there. And we \u2014 we felt we were \u2014 we were giving it back to the Germans.\nSo that \u2014 that continued, more and more star \u2014 started to decline in health. I have \u2014\ncan I show that shoe? It figured so \u2014",
        "Q: Can \u2014 can we cut for just a second? [break] Okay, okay, so we\u2019re rolling. So tell\nme, what about \u2014 what is this shoe?",
        "A: Symbolic of the torture \u2014 the torturous mind, that I also had \u2014 had to live with \u2014\nphysical torture, yes, but the mental, sometimes was even worse. I contracted\nfrostbite, particularly in my right foot.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And as we marched on and on, it became more and more painful. My foot was\nnow exceeding the size of the shoe. And I wanted to scre \u2014 yell out, the pain was\nthat great. I didn\u2019t dare, cause had I done that, I probably would have either been\npushed aside and left to die, or prob \u2014 quite possibly would have been shot.\n100\nJuly 14, 2015",
        "Q: Is this the shoe you wore?",
        "A: No, but this is exactly like the shoe. This \u2014 this is a shoe that I wore when I left\nlater on, I left the hospital, I was just \u2014 once I discharged. This was my discharged\nshoe.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: How it became torn, I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s very, very representative of the shoe\nthat I wore, which was \u2014 had been battered around quite a bit.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, I-",
        "Q: What does it mean to you, the shoe?",
        "A: It says to me that \u2014 it reminds me of what I went through, reminds me of the\nstruggle that I had, and the struggle that I was able to survive, because this \u2014 the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the emotional stress that this gave me, was as bad as the physical. To make the\ndecision. I\u2019m being force-marched, I can\u2019t drop out. If I do, may be my death. So\nwhat do I do? The pain is so incredibly great. [\u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014I\u2019ve gotta get this shoe off\nmy foot. Fortunately, there comes a break.",
        "Q: Now we can focus back on him. Did you bre \u2014 [break] \u2014 and you were say \u2014",
        "A: Fortunately, we\u2019re stopped along the way, and we\u2019re forced to sit down on the\nside of the road, fortuitous as could be, because I could not have gone any long \u2014July 14, 2015\nany \u2014 any longer. And so I made the decision. That was the emotional tug, do you\ntake a chance of \u2014 of dropping out along the side and trying to get that shoe off? If\nthey see you, you\u2019re shot. Do you do that, or do you continue, and try to stick it out?\nTake the pain, as bad as it is? And then comes this break, that we\u2019re stopped, and I\ncan now take my shoe off. I take it off, I don\u2019t want them to see it, so I throw it over\na hedge, or some kind of a bush. The only winter garment I have is a scarf. I take\nthe scarf from around my neck, and I wrap it around the foot. So I have one shoe\nand one scarf, and that\u2019s the way I conduct myself the rest of the time that I was a\nprisoner.",
        "Q: So you walked on a scarf?",
        "A: I walked on a scarf, on snow and ice. Periodically, we got some sunshine, and\nsome of the snow would melt, so that became wet. It didn\u2019t help the swelling in the\nfoot, but at least there was expansion that I didn\u2019t get from the shoe, so I could\nsurvive the pain. And so, that went on and on.",
        "Q: Did they find out that you were Jewish?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They never did, huh?\n102July 14, 2015",
        "A: No. Again, defiance, that I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m going to \u2014 I \u2014 I will do it. If they had ever\ninterrogated me, I would have \u2014 I would probably have been required to show my\ndog tags, at which time the others, that were attached to them \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: \u2014 would have \u2014 would have shown. So I had no reservation in that, but once you\nbecome a slave laborer, you\u2019re not \u2014 you\u2019re not anything. You\u2019re not registered, and\nthey don\u2019t care about your dog \u2014 dog tags, they don\u2019t care what you are, you just\nwork, or you die. That\u2019s just as si-simple as that. So ha-had they insisted I \u2014 I \u2014I\nidentify myself, of course I would have. But the fact that I didn\u2019t, what it would\nhave meant, would I be \u2014 have sacrificed my life? I don\u2019t know. Would I have been\nsent? Chances are I might have gone to a slave labor camp. Chances are\n[indecipherable] something like Berga, where so many of the Jewish soldiers were\nsent.",
        "Q: Jewish American, yeah.",
        "A: But that would have been \u2014 that would have been a lifesaver. As bad as the\ntreatment was, the treat \u2014 treatment at Berga was harsh, terribly harsh. And \u2014 but\nyet, I would not have been subjected to the exposure that I \u2014 that I was. So that\nmight have happened.\n103July 14, 2015",
        "Q: So, in this time \u2014 [break] Okay. So, during these 88 days, is that how many you\nwere sleeping on the ground?",
        "A: I\u2014TIl explain. There were 90 days altogether. I'll explain where the other six\ndays \u2014 other 10 days come in. And just \u2014 I was just about to get to that.",
        "Q: What was my question, oh my. In this time, you had neither a name, nor a\nnumber \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 nor anything that \u2014 no \u2014 you were anonymous to your captors.",
        "A: Anonymous, I was \u2014 I was not a human being.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. How did they \u2014 did they yell at people, did they kick them, did they \u2014\nhow did they behave?",
        "A: Raus, raus, gemma(ph), gemma(ph), gemma(ph). Yes, there were shouts in\nGerman. We got to know what they \u2014 what they meant. And usually the ri \u2014 the rifle\np \u2014 the point of the rifle usually was the indication of what we were supposed to do.\nGo this way, go that way, get up, up, down, down. They used that most often, but\nthere were a few German expressions that they use, and we got to know what they\nmeant.",
        "Q: So raus means get up, get out.",
        "A: Raus, raus, get up, mm-hm.\n104\nJuly 14, 2015",

And I guess, maybe get\nregimented, get in line, get wa \u2014 wa \u2014 whatever it was. But I just did whatever the\nothers did, and wa \u2014 and that\u2019s the [indecipherable] if that\u2019s the [indecipherable]\nwhat they wanted, fine.",
        "Q: Were there any \u2014 did you ever find out whether there were any other Americans\nin this particular colon \u2014 colony, or column of slave laborers?",
        "A: I am quite certain there were other Americans. There was no buddy-buddy\nsystem.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I knew mi \u2014I knew so many different troops, I don\u2019t know any of them. I \u2014 I\u2014I\n\u2014I\u2014we-\u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 there was not even a buddy system, because you were\nconstantly living to survive for yourself. And I was about to get to that now \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, fine.",
        "A: \u2014 the next \u2014 the next stage. Now the tide of battle turned. The allied forces had\nregrouped, they were driving the Germans back. They had to move us faster. They \u2014\nboxcars. Those same boxcars that transported Jews and others to the concentration\ncamps, that was where \u2014 that was our destiny.\n105\nJuly 14, 2015",
        "Q: Okay, go ahead.",
        "A: There\u2019s one thing I wa \u2014 wanted to mention too, that I didn\u2019t, that made travel\nduring these forced marches, more difficult. Most of the marches were at night. The\nrailroad tracks were carried at night. Some of them were in the daytime. When they\nwere, often, we were fired upon by allied aircraft. From 10,000 feet in the air, you\ncan\u2019t distinguish the s \u2014 the soldiers marching, are they British, American, or\nGerman uniform? You can\u2019t tell from the air. And they would fire on us.",
        "Q: Did they ever hit?",
        "A: Huh? Oh yeah, yeah, they hit some. Some were killed. And that was very, very\ndifficult to take. Even worse \u2014 well, I shouldn\u2019t say even worse, but also,\nemotionally, what really hit me so much, and maybe the others, the physical aspect,\nof course, the danger of being sh-shot and killed was bad enough. But when I saw\nthose planes finish their run \u2014 and mind you, I knew something about the air force,\nbecause we all \u2014 I and those who were with me at the time, wanted to become\npilots. And I s \u2014 they swooped down, and they \u2014 they did their firing. When their\nrun was over, when they be \u2014 they proceeded ahead of the train, then I saw them\nmake the big U-turn, I knew they were heading back to their base in England.\nThere were officers in those planes, and I knew they were going to the officers\u2019\nclubs. And what were they going to do? They were going to get a nice, comfortable\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n106July 14, 2015\ncouch, warm room, cocktail, food, cigar. Nice, nice life. The frustration in realizing\nwhat they were going to, and we had \u2014 I had \u2014 had no future at that time. I didn\u2019t\nknow what was going to happen. I didn\u2019t know if I would be alive, dead, escaped,\nwhatever. Didn\u2019t know. So that was terribly frustrating, emotionally. It tore at me in\nsome respects, even more than the physical aspect of it. So now, we\u2019ve co \u2014 we\u2019re\ncontinuing, we\u2019re working on these railroads, or sabotaging them, and the tide of\nbattle does turn. We\u2019re now forced into these cattle cars. All it has, one big sliding\ndoor, no windows, no lights. And we\u2019re pushed in \u2014 they\u2019re called 40 and eights.\nEight horses can fit in, 40 humans. We were about 80. We were packed in, bodies\nstacked against body. And I knew \u2014 some people used to criticize me, on something\nso clich\u00e9, you said you were packed 1n like sardines? Well, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014 it\u2019s just\nprobably the be \u2014 most apt description I can give, because just the way they I-lay,\none over another. That\u2019s the way we were stacked. And there was no room to sit.\nOnce a day, that door would slide open, and they would throw in some crusts of\nbread. By this time, we\u2019re all quite weak. It \u2014 we couldn\u2019t attack one another with\nenough strength to harm, or certainly to kill one another, but we had be \u2014 we did\nbecome a\u2014a-\u2014a pack of of animals. We clo \u2014 we crawled and clawed our way to\nthose scraps of bread. As soon as a man got a scrap in his hand, he thrust it into his\nmouth; the hunger was fierce. The \u2014 we had no \u2014 no bathroom facilities, we used\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n107July 14, 2015\nour helmets. You can guess what the atmosphere was like in that car, 80 humans.\nSome started to die, some did die in the car. Some wou \u2014 became mentally\nderanged. Were they out of their minds? I don\u2019t know. But they certainly were \u2014\nhad no mental stability. And that\u2019s what we lived with for six days and nights.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: So when I say this kind of slave labor is distinguished from any kind of\ntreatment in captivity, in probably \u2014 in possibly any war. Finally, on the end of the\nsix days, that big door 1s swung open. They pull us out, and now it\u2019s a forced\nmarch. I only have one shoe, and I can\u2019t endure another march, certainly on snow\nand ice. I have to make a decision. I always knew that one option was escape, if a\ntime or situation presented itself. And I said, this is it. We were being \u2014 we were put\nin \u2014 in lines for forced march. I looked and saw where the guards were positioned,\nhere, here, so forth. It occurred to me that if we came to a curve 1n the road, there\nwould be maybe five to 10 seconds where we would be \u2014 not be vi \u2014 we, where we\nwere situated, would not be visible to a guard. There were two others near me. I\ndon\u2019t recall that I had any particular connection with them at all, but they were the\nnearest to me. And so I told them what I had whispered the \u2014 watch, and they made\nsure the guards don\u2019t see, and I would call them, when I give a nod, like this. And\nwe got to that position, when the guards were separated that far, I gave a nod, and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n108July 14, 2015\nthe three of us threw a \u2014 threw a \u2014 there was a \u2014 a hedge, some \u2014 something \u2014 some\ngrowth of some sort, we threw ourselves over it, and just lay there. I think the\ntroops behind us, recognizing what we did, used discretion, and said, I should clo \u2014\nwe should close up. They closed ranks, I think. I\u2019m not sure of that. But the fact that\nwe were not detected, that there were no soldiers out searching for us, suggested to\nme that maybe that\u2019s what happened. And that saved us. So they marched on by,\nand they were gone. We had gone through a town while we were on the train, not\ntoo long ago. And we could see through the cracks, there was something there, it\nwas a some \u2014 something, it was not just the treed areas that we had been through, so\nit was probably a village of some sort.",
        "Q: So, the train, when you were packed in like sardines, was moving. The cattle car\nwas moving during those six days?",

We crawl\ninto this town, and as we \u2014 we\u2019re coming down a hill. I have a picture of it, on back\nbehind the screen, I have a picture of that town. I never went back.

        "Q: Even in those cold temperatures.",
        "A: Even in those temperatures, lice on our bodies. But so my head was shaved. So I\nhad bristles, I just \u2014 just \u2014 dirty face, and just torn, the clothes were torn. And he\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n111July 14, 2015\ndoesn\u2019t know what to do. Looks at us. And I try to explain who we are, I don\u2019t think\nhe knew. He starts to close the door. I have one good foot and shoe, I stick the left\nfoot in the door. And then I hear voices from the rear. They sound like elderly\npeople. And he motioned for them to come to the door. They do, and it is this\nelderly couple. I notice the man takes a look on the jacket, I have a U.S. emblem,\nand he looks at it, and there\u2019s a\u2014 a smile on his face. I say, what \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014\nwhat\u2019s he smiling about? We\u2019re desperate here, and he\u2019s smiling at us. He comes\nwalking out to the porch, to look up and down, to see if there are any soldiers. He\nthen takes us \u2014 he then motions \u2014 he sees no soldiers \u2014 if they\u2019re captured \u2014 1-1f \u2014 if\n\u20141if\u20141f the g \u20141f the German soldiers come by, and we were in their house with\nthem, not only would we be shot, they would be shot as traitors. In all likelihood,\nthat\u2019s what would happen. So he has to look out and see if there are any soldiers.\nNone there. Motions for us to come in, and his wife joins us. She sees our condition,\nand almost without saying anything, she goes, I guess, to the kitchen, and she comes\nout with three ladles of so \u2014 ladles and some \u2014 some kind of cups of some sort, of\nhot soup, with a piece of meat in it. Perception on her part, she sees the condition,\nand she recognizes, more than anything. To us, just seeing a living quarters, it was\nso startling. I re \u2014 I remember just \u2014 just standing there, even before taking the food,\nand just looking. There were curtains, drapes, carpeting, furniture, lamps. We\n112July 14, 2015\nhadn\u2019t seen that in a long time, we were living just in the outdoors alone. So that\nwas striking. But then, the food was so delect \u2014 just absolutely delectable. I \u2014\nnormally when you\u2019re hungry, you \u2014 you gulp it down. But I \u2014 I savored it, just the\ntaste of food, was so great. After they fed us, we talked for a little bit. Amazingly,\nthey spoke reasonable English. Why did they want to save us? Some years earlier,\nthis couple had traveled to America. They spent time in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nTheir experience with Americans, and America, was so good, when he saw that\nemblem, that\u2019s what made him smile. And that\u2019s what probably \u2014 probably got\nthem to take the risk of bringing us into their home, and take \u2014 and take \u2014 you\nknow, and feeding us. After that experience, they then knew that they couldn\u2019t keep\nus there. They got a piece of paper, and they drew a map, showing us alleyways to\ngo through. We could hear shellfire, not \u2014 not small arms fire yet, but we knew we\nwere fairly close to allied lines. And they knew too, that the allies were near. So, if\nthey could get us to a safe place, they thought that in a few days, the way the allies\nwere moving, from reports they had, I guess, heard, or whatever, we would be\nrescued.",
        "Q: The two were \u2014 who were with you, were American, or not?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Oh, so you were three Americans.July 14, 2015",
        "A: They were two \u2014 there were \u2014 there were three americ \u2014 three American boys,\nyeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, they drew a map, and we followed that map, crawled through back alleys, to\n\u2014to a barn. We craw \u2014 got into that barn, we pulled ourselves up into a hayloft. I\ndon\u2019t remember how long we were there, two days, three days, just don\u2019t\nremember, no sense of time. But I do remember \u2014 I think it was a \u2014 the first\nmorning, I heard some scurrying down below. I separated the hay and looked\nthrough a crack. I saw a scene that is as clear today as that \u2014 as that scene I\nmentioned earlier, of the Germans standing over us with the guns. That is so clear. I\nsee a stool, I see a cow, and I see sitting on that stool, 1t must have been a German\nsoldier. Now, he had his top of his uniform off, and I could see that long, white\nunderwear, extending out of his black pants. Underwear, and black suspenders\nstretched over the underwear, and then the big, black boots he was wearing. And\nhe\u2019s milking a cow. I stirred a little bit, and some hay falls through the crack. This 1s\n\u2014 this is like a mo \u2014 a movie, you know, because \u2014 an-and I have to w \u2014 I watch, I\u2019m\nalmo \u2014 almost breathless, waiting to see where that \u2014 if it lands in front of him, that\nhay, he \u2014 he \u2014 he 1s likely \u2014 all likelihood, he is going to know there\u2019s something up\nthere, and whatever the consequences might be. Might he shoot, might he summon\n114\nJuly 14, 2015\ntroops? Whatever it would be, it probably would not be good for us. Because again,\nno prisoners taken alive. We were obviously Americans. But it [indecipherable]\nbehind him. So, it\u2019s of no real consequence, but I have that image of him. Must\nhave been a day or so later, we\u2019re lying in that hay, and again, aware that we\u2019re not\nfar from the allied troops, I\u2019m looking down an alleyway, through \u2014 must have\nbeen, you know, maybe it\u2019s a knothole, but I s \u2014 I can see down there to \u2014 down\nthere. At the end of that alleyway, something goes by \u2014 someone goes by, and he\u2019s\nwearing a helmet. Could be a German soldier, but then again, that helmet looks\nfamiliar. It looks like our helmet. I\u2019m not sure, and I wait, and I tell them. They \u2014\nthey \u2014 they don\u2019t know whether to believe me, I said, I think the American are here.\nYou \u2014 you\u2019re delirious. You\u2019re delirious, then \u2014 they couldn\u2019t be, we\u2019re not that\nclose yet. A few minutes later, a vehicle rolls by, and I see \u2014 [phone ringing]\n[break]",
        "Q: Okay, so you think that it\u2019s the American army troops that you see through that\nlittle peephole \u2014",
        "A: I see \u2014",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I think it might well be. And they think I\u2019m delusional, because they couldn\u2019t be\nthat close yet. A few minutes later, I see a vehicle go by, and it looks like a Jeep.\nNot only is it a Jeep, I see that white star on the hood. That\u2019s an American Jeep.\nYes, they are here. This time, they believe me. I say \u2014 we roll out of that hayloft, we\nliterally roll, we\u2019re so weak at this time, and I\u2019m almost deli \u2014 delirious. We\u2019re so \u2014\nyou know, we \u2014 the condition we were in. And I remember just rolling down that\nalleyway, and there, American soldiers, Third Armored Infantry division.",
        "Q: Excuse me.",
        "A: I don\u2019t even hear it. Fortunately, I don\u2019t. But the Third Armored Infantry\ndivision, again, Patton\u2019s Third Army, the \u2014 we were the first Americans they had\ncome across. They couldn\u2019t treat us with enough kindness. They tried to feed us.\nThe first thing they thought of \u2014 they were obviously not nutritionists, was\nchocolate. Bad, very bad. And then, any food they could get into us, they did. I \u2014 I -\nas I say, I was in very bad shape by then, I was mildly delirious. I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I\ncouldn\u2019t carry on a conversation with them. As I think I mentioned, we were the\nfirst Americans that they came across, so they treated us as well as they could.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n116July 14, 2015",
        "Q: Okay, I\u2019m interrupting at this point. I don\u2019t need to go into many graphic details,\nbut it\u2019s an unanswered question. When you say the chocolate was bad, what was\nbad about the chocolate?",
        "A: The sweetness of it, it just \u2014 we reacted, the stomach somehow, whatever the\nsystem is, that does whatever it does with your food after you\u2019ve eaten it, 1t just\ndidn\u2019t take to chocolate very well. It \u2014 I think the fact that 1t was rich, instead of just\nplain, ordinary taste, probably a leafy vegetable would have been easier to take. But\nthat made \u2014 the other two, I think, were sick, I was just delirious \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 so I don\u2019t remember what happened. But, the troops almost cradled us in their\narms, because again, you know, we were almost out of \u2014 out of it.",

        "Q: Scarf.",
        "A: \u2014 rag wrapped around it, and they knew there was something wrong there. They\nrushed me to a field hospital. It was a hospital very similar to, those who have seen\nthe TV show and the movie, \u201cM*A*S*H.\u201d Field set-up, doctors work \u2014 working\n117July 14, 2015\nunder very, very difficult conditions, but providing great, great service to men\nwounded on the battlefield. So, I don\u2019t remember where the operation took place,\nwhether it was in the field hospital \u2014 because my mind went blank. I did learn\nafterward, that from that field hospital, I was sent to the first general hospital in\nLiege, Belgium. And from there, transferred to the first general hospital in Paris,\nFrance. I don\u2019t remember any of that, at all, because as I say, I was delirious by\nthat time. I don\u2019t remember where the surgery was done on my foot, whether it was\nin Liege, Belgium, or in the field hospital. But they did, they had to cut away. The\nfoot \u2014 bottom of the foot was all black, and it would have continued on up my leg,\nand I probably would have lost part of the leg. So the timing was just right, and they\n\u2014 they caught it, but then I spent as \u2014 I\u2019d say, a month \u2014 a month to a month and a\nhalf, in the hospitals in \u2014 in Europe.",
        "Q: So, you lost a part of your foot?",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I have about 20 diseases, illnesses, fevers that I contracted during the 10 months\nof hospitalization. One of them was undulant fever. Now we didn\u2019t \u2014 in the hospital\nin France, in Paris, they didn\u2019t know what it was, but I had a raging fever. It was\ncaused by that incident with the cow, it was undulant fever. No doctor, no military\ndoctor was able to discover what it was. That kept me from going \u2014 getting back to\nAmerica, because they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they were going to fly me, which they did, I \u2014 I\nflew in a hospital plane. They wouldn\u2019t do that until they got the fever down, and\nthey couldn\u2019t get it down. Finally, they did force it down enough to get me on a\n120\nJuly 14, 2015\nplane and over to America. Years | \u2014 years later, I\u2014 I \u2014 I finished college, I\u2019m\nworking now, and I broke out in a sweat. Like the body just opened, water just\npoured out, and these little red dots all over. The doctor called it petechiae, and this\nwas a result of that incident. How was it discovered? The doctor that I \u2014 I had that\nnight, was substituting for another doctor. He was young, he was an intern, and he\nimmediately saw \u2014 thought that I had a contagious disease. And I was \u2014 and he\nordered an ambulance, they took me immediately, that night, from home, to 1 \u2014\nBelleville, New Jersey, to a \u2014 a hospital where children with polio were. It was an\nisolation hospital. And I was put on the isolation floor, with these children. I was\nthere a full month. My wife Shirley could only see me during that month, through\nglass. I was isolated because he thought that I had this contagious disease.",
        "Q: Did you?",
        "A: No. No. Fortunately, the doctor in that isolation hospital was very thorough, and\nvery smart. He said, you have this raging fever, and you\u2019re going to continue to get\nthese attacks. We have to find out what you have. We \u2014 so he says, I\u2019m going to ask\nyou a lot of questions. And he was so thorough. He took me through the whole\ncampaign.",
        "Q: Did he really?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n121July 14, 2015",
        "A: It turned out that he traced it back to that incident in the barn. He said, I believe\nthat you have something that\u2019s called \u2014 well, whatever feve \u2014 Ill think \u2014 PII think\nof it in a\u20141in a few moments. But you have that disease. Now, it\u2019s a\nMediterranean disease. But, I said, I wasn\u2019t in the Mediterranean. He said, but it\nalso \u2014 this was a very intelligent doctor \u2014 it also can be contracted from\nunpasteurized milk.

        "A: Okay. When I \u2014 in the ba \u2014 in the bulge, when I was captured, I was reported as\nmissing in action. Standard procedure, a telegram from the War Department to my\nparents. And months go by, these three months go by, and there\u2019s no word. I\nlearned later on that my mother had a nervous breakdown, because the assumption\nwas, if he\u2019s missing in action, after two month \u2014 two months [indecipherable] and\nthere\u2019s no word, he must be dead. So that was the \u2014 the a-assumption. There\u2019s a\nman in charge of communications, another soldier, an American soldier in charge of\ncommunications for another unit, perhaps another \u2014 probably another di \u2014 I think\nanother division, and a company within that division, he\u2019s the communications\nperson. When the report went out that I was missing in action, he learned of that. He\nstarted to send communication to other units in the area, have they come across a\nRobert Max?",

        "Q: Were n\u2014 when were you in shape \u2014 did the army ever ask you the details of\nwhat had happened to you when you got missing \u2014 when you went missing?",
        "A: I-",
        "Q: Were you ever debriefed, in other words?",
        "A: When I was debriefed? When I \u2014 not overseas, when I was in the hospital over\nhere, a military officer from \u2014 came from Washington to interview me, but the\ninterview was more about the war crimes commission, because I witnessed a killing\nof an American soldier. As I\u2019ve said, 1f you were unable to work, you were either\nleft to die, or you were shot. There was an American soldier who could not get up.\nHe was just that weak, that sick and this German soldier takes out a gun, shoots\nhim. I learned later that this German soldier\u2019s name is Eisenhauer, spelled h-a-u-e-\nr, instead of o-w-e-r. Somebody \u2014 I don\u2019t remember how I learned it, somebody\ntold me, because he was a notoriously bad actor, and so be \u2014 I\u2014 so I gave testimony\nabout that incident. I don\u2019t think I talked about my conditions. I don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t recall\nthat I talked with anybody na \u2014 na \u2014 officially. I just don\u2019t recall. Though, while I\nwas in the hospital, I remember being awarded the \u2014 the Purple Heart, and then a\nsecond award, with oak \u2014 the Oak Leaf clover, and then raised in rank from PFC to\n127\nJuly 14, 2015\ncorporal. So, the \u2014 you know, there was procedures, and officers came by, and \u2014 to\ndo the things while I\u2019m \u2014 while I\u2019m lying in bed, and all that. But I just don\u2019t recall\nanybody questioning me \u2014",
        "Q: About your experience.",
        "A: \u2014 about the experience. I don\u2019t remember at all. And that\u2019s why I ne \u2014 I never\ntalked about it, for all those years, it\u2019s 53 years \u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me, let\u2019s cut the camera, I\u2019m so sorry. [break] So, yes, you said that \u2014\nwas there anybody, or \u2014 put it this way, who was the first person you ever really\ntold what had happened to you? When was the first time you did that?",
        "A: Actually, I \u2014 I\u2014 I deviate from what I \u2014 what I\u2019ve said to you, that I never talk\nwith it \u2014 talked about it. When I got back to college \u2014 I\u2019m trying to remember the\nname of the unit, but they were a bu \u2014 a bunch of old men. And they \u2014 they met in,\nyou know, there \u2014 there \u2014 there are groups that meet. And I think I told you that\nwhen I got back to college, I had been interviewed on \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 network radio, and all of that. And \u2014 and so there was \u2014 there were people\nthere on the campus, who knew the experience that I went through, and something\nmust have gotten out to this senior men\u2019s group, and all that, so they asked me to\ncome to speak. The problem was, first of all, I didn\u2019t know what I was talking\n128\nJuly 14, 2015\nabout, you know? I hadn\u2019t really \u2014 really, really pulled together my \u2014 my \u2014 my\nexperience over there. But, I did \u2014 did talk to them and tell them. The problem was\nthat most of them couldn\u2019t hear what I was talking about. Some of them had \u2014 you\never \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in those times, there were still some who used ear trumpets.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: And \u2014 and what\u2019d I say? And they couldn\u2019t quite get it. And I guess that was\nwhen I decided that nobody\u2019s really interested, and I \u2014 I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\nWhy I to \u2014 and I just gave a few \u2014 a few highlights, that I was a soldier, and I fought\non y \u2014 but I\u2014I didn\u2019t go into any of the details at all, about it. Was just a\u2014a\nsoldier\u2019s s-story. But that was the only thing, and from that point on, that was when\nI decided, it\u2019s not pleasant, I don\u2019t want to talk about it, and I f\u2014 1 \u2014I stopped, for\n53 years after that, I didn\u2019t \u2014 but wa \u2014 over here, when did I decide that I should be\ntalking about it? In this room, my \u2014 I had two grandsons have, at that time they\nwere seven and nine years old. And one of them said \u2014 we\u2019re sitting here, and one\nsays, Poppy, were you in the war? And then, between the two of them, they fle \u2014\nthrowing questions at me. What di\u2014 where did you sleep, what did you eat? Did\nyou have a gun? Did you ever fire 1t? Did you ever kill anybody? And just\nsomething is triggering in my mind, as I say, my guess, if these kids are asking,\nmaybe I should be talking about it. In 1988, Shirley and I, we had set up a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n129July 14, 2015\nfoundation at Ohio University, to bri \u2014 well, it was b \u2014 bl \u2014 bla \u2014 based on religious\nlines, to bring religious elements on campus, so there should be no anti-Semitism\nand so on. It was a very \u2014 a very good thing We f \u2014 and so we founded this \u2014 this\norganization. One \u2014 in ni \u2014 1n 19 ay \u2014 in ninety \u2014 we did it before that \u2014 in 1988, we\ninvited Elie Wiesel, Elie Wiesel, to come to campus for a weekend, to talk. He\nagreed to do it, because there was a woman, a young woman, a student, a graduate\nstudent, who had written, and \u2014 a \u2014 a\u2014I guess her \u2014 her papers for her degree, on\nElie Wiesel, on either hi \u2014 one of his books, or on his life. She died a short time\nafterward. It was \u2014 it was an unfortunate illness, from something she ate. He was\naware of that. I don\u2019t recall how he was made aware of it, but she was someone\nspecial to him, and he was made aware, perhaps by his rabbi, who had been a rabbi\nat Hillel [indecipherable] University. And when he and \u2014 when he \u2014 and he agreed\nto come, but only on the condition that we memorialize her name. And so he came\nto the campus. I don\u2019t have to tell you \u2014 oh, he insisted on certain things being done.\nOne, that he speak [phone ringing, break]",
        "Q: So you were talking about Elie Wiesel.",
        "A: So \u2014 w-w \u2014 So w-we \u2014 so he \u2014 he is the weekend guest, and of \u2014 and \u2014 and\nShirley and I are also the guests, of the president of Ohio University. We \u2014 the\npresident\u2019s guest house is turned over to us. Elie Wiesel has the master bedroom,\n130July 14, 2015\nhis rabbi has another bedroom, and there\u2019s a third bedroom for Shirley and me. Elie\nWiesel comes to me, he says, Bob, take the be \u2014 master bedroom. I said, I \u2014 I \u2014 oh, I\n\u2014I-\u2014Icouldn\u2019t possibly even fit \u2014 think of doing that. That\u2019s your room. He said\nno, no, no, listen to me, believe me, take the master bedroom. We do. Next morning\n\u2014and so we go \u2014 go to bed at night. The next morning, we come down for\nbreakfast. We had ordered \u2014 this 1s a little town, we\u2019d ordered from a \u2014 a \u2014 a larger\ncity in Ohio, kosher food. Comes the breakfast, he eats a few grapes, you know, he\ndoesn\u2019t eat much of \u2014 much at all. He eats a few grapes, and all this kosher food that\nwe brought in, from Columbus, Ohio, nothing. He eats nothing. But he said, I hope\nyou slept well. I said well, you gave us the room. I said, did you sleep well? He\nsaid, well, he said, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t stay in the \u2014 1n this building. Wh-Wha-What \u2014\nwha-what \u2014 where did you go? He said, there was a little motel down the road. He\nasked somebody to make arrangements for him to go to the motel. They didn\u2019t have\nany rooms vacant. He had a little hole someplace. There was room enough for his\ntypewriter and him, and I guess maybe a place to lie down. I said, you spent last\nnight there? Why? Why would you do that? He said, I didn\u2019t want to wake you up.\nWhat do you mean wake us? He said, I do my writing, a lot of my writing \u2014",
        "Q: At night.\n131July 14, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 at mid \u2014 in the mid \u2014 middle of the night, in the morning, 2:30, 3:30, any time\nlike that. He used a typewriter. He said, if I were writing at night, I would keep you\nawake. Imagine this man, I would keep you awake. So I went out of my way to go\ndown to this little motel, I spent the night there. I was pleased, and I could do some\nwriting. He slept very, very little. My guess is probably maybe three, four hours a\nnight, at most. Ate very little. And \u2014",
        "Q: Quite a story.",
        "A: \u2014 it was a \u2014 but this aft \u2014 huh?",
        "Q: Quite a story.",
        "A: Incredible, the per-per-personality of \u2014 of \u2014 of this man. So here we are, now it\u2019s\nSaturday afternoon. We\u2019re in the living room of the president\u2019s guest house. There\nare three people there, Shirley, me, and Elie Wiesel. And I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m really\nmesmerized by him. I am not \u2014 up to that time, I still had not, other than that thing\nwith the el-el-elderly group, I had still not talked, and I didn\u2019t want to talk. If there\nwas anybody I suppose I should have talked with about my experiences, I guess it\u2019s\nElie Wiesel. I think I was intimidated, or either that, or I didn\u2019t think it would be\nvery important to him, based on what he had gone through, and what he had done.\nAnd so, I never talked about it with him. But just being in the room with him, and\ntalking other things with him, was, you know, I mean, a \u2014 a \u2014 a thrill beyond\n132July 14, 2015\nanything I can imagine. When I was influenced by the two boys, I attribute it also,\nthe fact maybe that sm \u2014 meeting with Elie Wiesel suggested to me, just as he had\nbeen talking about his experiences, maybe I should be doing th \u2014 maybe I should be\ndoing the same thing.",
        "Q: Did Shirley know everything?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think I ever talked with her about it, no. She only learned while we\nwere d \u2014 writing the book.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Although that she did go to a lo \u2014 so \u2014 a lot of the presentations that I talked. So\nshe learned, she learned that way abou \u2014 about it. And occasionally, you know,\nwe'll be having dinner or something, and something would occur to me, and I\nwould make some reference to the war. But \u2014 so \u2014 so, I think, when the kids started\ntalking \u2014 and then I\u2019m thinking Elie Wiesel, and then I reali \u2014 I \u2014I realized, we\nhave a Holocaust council here in the \u2014 in our federation, and Holocaust education 1s\nmandated in New Jersey. Now, I\u2019m not a Holocaust survivor, but I survived maybe\nthe equivalent to sa \u2014 to most of the survivors, and maybe \u2014 maybe in some sense,\nmaybe even worse. Not those who went to the death camps, of course, nothing\ncompared with that. But at least, may \u2014 and maybe \u2014 maybe this is a story that\nshould be preserved. I didn\u2019t know it was unique at the time, and I really didn\u2019t\n133\nJuly 14, 2015\nknow until Heidi became my editor, and she did a lot of research, and the man in\ncharge of \u2014 of th \u2014 of press for the city of Newark, was also a World War II\nhistorian.",
        "Q: Yeah, you mentioned him to me.",
        "A: I mentioned him. And so he di \u2014 he did a lot of research too, so he \u2014 he thought\nthere was something unique about it. But an-anyway, it was that combination. And\nthen somehow \u2014 and I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know how, the head of our Holocaust council\ngot word of my experience, and induced me to start talking to the school kids. So\nwhen I learned that that\u2019s what they were doing in New Jersey, so these young\npeople would grow up as being witnesses for the future, that seemed an imperative,\nand that\u2019s when I decided, time to start talking. And if you don\u2019t \u2014 may \u2014 make you\nfeel any happier, I don\u2019t hear that over here. You feel \u2014 remember, you feel it. Oh,\ndear. So that was the \u2014 that was what urged me.",
        "Q: And that was 50 year \u2014 more than 50 years later?",
        "A: Oh yeah, that was 53 years later, that I started talking.",
        "Q: So that would have been like 10 years ago, you would have started talking?",
        "A: I\u2019ve been doing it for about 10 years, right \u2014",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: \u2014 right. And \u2014\n134July 14, 2015",
        "Q: One other thing that I want to ask is, those 90 to a hundred days, what was\ndifferent about the person who came out of that, than the person who went into that?",
        "A: Was a totally different individual. I went \u2014 I went in as a\u2014a\u2014as a kid, very\nunsophisticated. And I knew something, because I did read newspapers, did know\nabout the war, and about concentration camps, and things of that nature, and a little\nbit of politics. But \u2014 but I was really very, very unsophisticated, and had no\nparticular design on life, I didn\u2019t know wha-what I wanted to be. So, very unsettled,\nI was still a student, and that was \u2014 that was all. My Jewish life was pretty much set\nby my mother, so I knew I had to go to synagogue, even though it was done in\nextreme form, like a Orthodoxy, and all that. But my shi \u2014 but my mother insisted,\nand I was brought up, you know, as a \u2014 as a good Jew. But when I \u2014 af-after going\nthrough what I did, I don\u2019t know what the maturation design was, but when I lie in\n\u20141n the hospital bed for those 10 months, I had many sleepless nights. Now, a lot of\nthem were because of physical conditions, and the pain was such that it was hard to\nsleep. But the others were just emotional, I \u2014 just thinking, thinking, thinking,\nconstantly. Some of that thinking would go back to incidents that took place during\nthe war. I constantly had an image of this elderly couple. I had an image of the\nhelmet of that sergeant, and I kept reaching for \u2014 trying to \u2014 trying to get his face.\nAnd I couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t get away from \u2014 from remembering that, and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n135July 14, 2015\nwhat \u2014 what \u2014 what I went through with him, and how \u2014 and the great good fortune\nthat I had, that it happened to be somebody like that, who was a humanitarian, as \u2014\nas \u2014 a-a-as well as a\u2014 a good soldier, I guess, and you know. He recognized valor,\na-and so, I \u2014 I had thoughts about them, and some of the instances, sometimes I\nwould get an image of that tank, like an ogre, a big monster, with that cannon. But\nmore \u2014 more often though, my thinking was about the future \u2014 wha \u2014 wa \u2014 what ha\n\u2014 how \u2014 how \u2014 how \u2014 wha-what-what 1 \u2014 what is ordained, what am I supposed to\ndo? I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s going to be a total change. Sure, I\u2019m gonna go back to\nschool, then I have to go to work, and all of that. But my life, somehow, it just feels\nvery, very different. I\u2019m not the person I was before. I\u2019m much more mature, for\none thing. I was a kid when I went in, now I\u2019m reasonably mature, and I start to\nthink. I was very, very lucky, as \u2014 as when I \u2014 when I talk to senior audiences, very\noften men will come up and surround me, and say, your life was a miracle. You \u2014\nyou should have been killed many, many times, but you\u2019re still here. So that \u2014 that\nthought ran through my head, and there was something urging me inside. I\u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow what it \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it was, but I\u2014 I knew I had to respond in some\nway, to what I had been through. And that some way happened to turn out to\ndevoting the rest of my life to Jewish causes, Jewish interests. When I was 83, I had\nmy second Bar Mitzvah, which is in the book, incidentally, my second Bar Mitzvah,\n136\nJuly 14, 2015\nhow that \u2014 how that came about. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s quite rare. Very, very few Jewish men\nhave a second Bar Mitzvah.",
        "Q: What is the purpose of a second Bar Mitzvah?",
        "A: The purpose of it is, back in \u2014 in David\u2019s time, bibli \u2014 [phone ringing, break]",
        "Q: So, you were saying \u2014",
        "A: According to the psalms \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: In King David\u2019s time, longevity was considered to be 70 years. If a man lived\nbeyond 70, he started life all over again. And so, 70, and recognizing that the age of\nBar Mitzvah for boys 1s usually 13, so you figure, if 70, life begins again, 13 years\nadded to that, 83. So at age 83, a Jewish man becomes eligible for a second Bar\nMitzvah.",
        "Q: And how does that change from the first Bar Mitzvah? What\u2019s different?",
        "A: Oh, it\u2019s a world of difference. It\u2019s a to-totally different world. It\u2019s always been\nmy belief that 13 may be a little bit too young for a boy to understand the ritual that\nhe was going through, and the me \u2014 what it meant to become \u2014 because you\nassumed new responsibility in life, a more mature responsibility, and you\u2019re\nresponsible for your actions, and your future. And you \u2014 I \u2014I find that hard, at 13,\n137\nJuly 14, 2015\nto be able to think that way. So 83, not only you have \u2014 you\u2019re well beyond that\npoint \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 you\u2019ve been thinking \u2014 thinking of your \u2014 your life, and planning for many,\nmany years. But your whole perspective on life is different, because you\u2019ve had a\nlife experience. In my case, I had an unusual life experience, the military life, and I\nhad a ga \u2014 an interesting Jewish experience, too, because my family, my mother\nwas rigid about it. We were not Orthodox, but we were Reform, but nevertheless, it\noccupied a big, big part of her life, and became part of my life.",
        "Q: It\u2019s like an identity.",
        "A: So a ritual was important. Pardon?",
        "Q: It\u2019s an identity, it\u2019s the forming of an identity.",
        "A: Exactly. I had \u2014 had a strong Jewish 1-1-ident \u2014 identity. So that I knew that I\nwanted the thing \u2014 to do things spiritually, but more in terms of aiding pe \u2014 aiding\npeople. If I survived what I did, there are other people who had difficult times, and I\nought to be able to do so \u2014 do things that would be helpful to those people. The bar\n\u2014 Bar Mitzvah was more symbolic than anything. It allowed me to restate my \u2014 my\n\u2014my Jewishness.",
        "Q: Yeah.\n138\nJuly 14, 2015",
        "A: And, as I say, 1t had meaning, it would \u2014 had me \u2014 real meaning. It was the first\ntime I had read from our sacred Torah. And that had a lot of meaning, because when\nI was 13, in Reform congregation, we didn\u2019t \u2014 the boy didn\u2019t read from the Torah.\nThis was my first opportunity to do that. So I learned to read Hebrew without the\nvowels underneath, and you had \u2014 were either experienced, or were very adept at\nlearning how to do it. And I did learn. It was my wife Shirley, who came up with\nthe idea. She said, Bob, you\u2019re 83 now, you know, you could \u2014 you could have a\nsecond Bar Mitzvah. I'd like you to have it. And so I did it, to a large extent, for\nher, because she wanted it. We had a rabbi at the time, who \u2014 who agreed \u2014 agreed\nabs-absolutely. And I spent sessions with her, preparing for it. And we \u2014 it was the\nmost \u2014 probably the most exciting event in my life.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: Well, I guess I have to say, second to my marriage. But \u2014 but it wa \u2014 1t wa \u2014 it\nwa \u2014 So exciting to be \u2014 now I felt more totally encompassed within the realm of\nJewishness. The things that I did in life, first of all, I\u2014 I became president of two\nsynagogues, and wherever I went, we were so deeply involved. Shirley every bit as\ninvolved, and you see in her obituary how totally committed she was to Jewish\ncauses. She sat federation boards, women\u2019s division boards, worked for\norganizations that were nationwide \u2014 Jewish nationwide, worldwide. Served on the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n139July 14, 2015\n\u2014 on those boards, and on committees, and all that. So, totally engaged. Well, that\nwas my \u2014 my role, too. I assumed the presidency of the state association of Jewish \u2014\nall Jewish federations in New Jersey, there were 16 at the time. You know, those\nkinds of roles.",
        "Q: And you think \u2014 yeah \u2014 you think that if 1t hadn\u2019t been for this experience, that\nyour life probably wouldn\u2019t have taken that direction?",
        "A: I think that is probably the case. I\u2014 I would not \u2014 I do \u2014 I\u2014I don\u2019t see how I\nwould have had any opening to that. I knew things about Jewish life, and Jewish\nphilanthropy, that I learned only late \u2014 later on. I didn\u2019t know as a \u2014 a youngster,\nand maybe I never would have come across it. The fact that I became president of\nHillel, a Jewish international organization, did help me a great deal, in\nunderstanding that a Jewish life is important, and saving j \u2014 other Jewish lives is\nimportant, too. So, when it came time to set up different type of operations, I set up\n\u2014 I \u2014I-congregational life was \u2014 was important. I sat on a number of different\nboards. I did fundraising for United Jewish Appeal, because that money went not\njust to people in need, an-an-and in many ca \u2014 1n some cases, not even to just\nJewish causes, cause many of the things that we did as Jews, went for the public at\nlarge. Many of our operations are required even by statute in the state, to serve other\npeople\u2019s needs. Jewish family service, Jewish vocational service. Social service\n140\nJuly 14, 2015\nagencies like that do provide services to people who are not Jewish. So, that was\nwhat I was committed. One of the places I \u2014 I became very much involved in, was\nthe Daughters of Israel Geriatric Center. This was a home for the aged. I had aging\nparents. I ha \u2014 I\u2014 I got to know the age \u2014 the aged there. They had lived full lives,\nnow they were in the last stages of their lives. I served there for about 15 years, I\nwas vice-president there. So \u2014 but getting to know them. So one of the kinds of\nthings that I set up, with another member of our Jewish community who had owned\nsome department stores and all that, we decided we wanted to do things for elderly\npeople, the late stages of life, and many of them had given up life. The retirement\nage \u2014 and I think it may still be today, still recognized, when you\u2019re 65, back in\nthose days, when I was a youth, that was automatic, 65 you closed the book, no\nmore work, you retired, and lived the golden years. I never have found out what\nthose golden years are.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re age what? Ninety-something now?",
        "A: Huh? Yeah.",
        "Q: How old are you now?",
        "A: Ni-\u2014 ninety-two.",
        "Q: Amazing. Amazing.\n141July 14, 2015",
        "A: But I never found out what the golden years are. I \u2014 I realize in some other\npeople\u2019s minds, it becomes stopping work and just enjoying yourself. You know,\ntravel, go see your grandkids, take vacations, things of that nature. Those are the\ngolden years. But I saw people in housing, senior housing in New Jersey. They\nwere not Jewish, just Jewish based. These were people who had given up on life. I\ndeveloped a program that would hand \u2014 may enable them to re-reengage with life,\nreinstitute things that they had done earlier in their lives. Some had been great\ncooks, some had worked in the industry, some had been musicians, and all that. But\nnow, you\u2019re over 65, so you stop doing all of that, and in the process, you lose the\nessence of life. You still have some years ahead. And so I wrote this program out,\nand my par-partner, he and \u2014 he had access to people who would fund it. We got the\nfunding, developed. That was a non-profit corporation. We didn\u2019t charge for the\nservices. We went throughout New Jersey, to homes for the aged. The experience\nwas not lectures, I didn\u2019t lecture to them, but there were big charts they had on the\nwall. And each of them would go to their chart, and they would plot out \u2014 I would le\n\u2014 give them leading questions, what were you \u2014 and they \u2014 and those questions\nbrought out their interests in life. What things that they did before. Some of them\nwere musicians, they gave that up, some were great-aunts and uncle \u2014 whatev \u2014 but\nwhatever it was that they were interested in life, some were great cooks. Whatever\n142\nJuly 14, 2015\nthey did, which they were doing no more. So they plotted that out. And I\u2014I go \u2014\nguided them through that. And many of them adopted new careers, absolutely\ncareers. The most \u2014 probably the most dynamic one in all of them was a Holocaust\nsurvivor in a home for the elderly in Cranford, New Jersey. A Holocaust survivor\nwas just waste \u2014 sitting out her \u2014 her closing years. And she was only about 65.",
        "Q: Oh wow.",
        "A: And she was re-ready to just \u2014",
        "Q: Pack it in.",
        "A: That\u2019s it. That was it. She didn\u2019t talk. I don\u2019t think that \u2014 I don\u2019t know that\nanybody else there knew that she was a survivor. But that came out. One of the\nleading questions that I would throw at them \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 brought it out. This was part of her life experience. She then started to talk\nwithin \u2014 with the group, started to talk about her experiences, which she had never\ndisclosed to anyone. Some months after that series of seminars, I got a letter from\nher. She had found a new life. She was speaking, not to Jewish \u2014 Jewish\norganizations, the YMCA. Those were people and children who wanted to know\nabout this thing, too. They knew there was something like a Holocaust.",
        "Q: But what was it, and \u2014\n143July 14, 2015",
        "A: But what was it? They had no idea. And they knew there was a war.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Course, they got a little exposure to that in school, but what was the Holocaust?\nAnd so, she was invited to many places. The place there wa \u2014 the Young Man\u2019s\nChristian Association [indecipherable], and places far and wild \u2014 wide. And so she\nwrote me this letter.",
        "Q: That must have been so gratifying.",
        "A: Oh, I mean, those are the kind of things that were so, so gratifying. And \u2014 and\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of stuff I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve done ever since. Raised a lot of money for\nJewish philanthropy and all, but \u2014",
        "Q: So, I wanted to turn in a little bit different way, but taking from this route of, you\nknow, how life changed, and how \u2014 what kind of a person it made you, through this\nexperience. Did you have conversations with God, while you were in captivity? Did\nyou have any before? Did you have any after?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know about during captivity. It\u2019s always been my belief that I\u2019m a\nmortal, and I don\u2019t have access to God. But I learned, through reconstructionist\nJudaism, when \u2014 when I decided we wanted to go that route, and I took a whole\ngroup, and we formed a new congregation, I learned that there\u2019s a spark of God \u2014\nwhen we are created, all of us, all the human being, there\u2019s a spark of God in each\n144July 14, 2015\nof us. And you can do something one way or another, with that spark. And I\u2019ve\nalways looked to that spark. Now, that wasn\u2019t during \u2014 during the war, because I\nhad not been exposed to reconstructionist Judaism yet, and I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know about\nthat. But I did appeal to some something, beyond mankind. I didn\u2019t know what the\nforce was. I didn\u2019t think I had the right to talk directly to God, but I appealed for\nsome kind of help, support. And then, as I got to know later on, then I \u2014 I \u2014 I reali \u2014\nbut in the hospital, there was a moving force. I could never identify what it was,\nsomething with \u2014 inside me, it\u2019s a quality, a character \u2014 each person has some kind\nof character within him. It was a character in me, I think 1t might have been an\nessence of guilt. The fact that I came through. Not the fact that I sacrificed so much\nwith the danger, and the torture of living as I did, and all that, but a feeling of\nmaybe guilt, that I\u2014 I \u2014 I was blessed. There are a lot of people in life that are going\nthrough torment in their lives. May not be what I went through, but 1t may be the\nloss of a family member, it may be a \u2014 a sickness, that your \u2014 your \u2014 you\u2019re\nconfined to. Whatever it is. But that\u2019s where my leanings ought to go, whatever I \u2014 I\n\u2014I can do that will help other people, you know. It sounds like pie in the sky.",
        "Q: No, no, no. I mean, this is very real.",
        "A: But it\u2019s re \u2014 re \u2014 very real. I \u2014 one place where I differed with Shirley, my wife\n[indecipherable], she was very social. She did wonderful things for \u2014 for the kind\n145\nJuly 14, 2015\nof organizations, I did, too, but she was very social. I \u2014 I\u2019m not that \u2014 that kind of a\nperson. To me there must be purpose. And I think that was a word that would\ndescribe most anything. There\u2019s a purpose in life, and I have to find what that\npurpose is, and always fulfill that purpose. I couldn\u2019t do it just sitting around a ca \u2014\na \u2014 and drinking beer with \u2014 with the guys at night. That didn\u2019t serve any particular\npurpose. But, sitting at a table, meeting with a group of people, functioning people,\nwho were doing good for some organization, an agency, social service agency, or\nany other type, that felt right to me. So, always purpose in life. Your meeting, your\n\u2014 your time. Your time is worth something. Use it in some good way. Just lounging\naround isn\u2019t going to do anything for anybody else, and in the process, doesn\u2019t do\nanything for you too \u2014 either. So there was some self-redemption that came out of\nit. Some \u2014 something selfish, yeah, I would get something out of it. And I do, and I\nhave. When I leave one of those schools, and I see these kids come up to me and\ntalk, and tell me about their grandfathers, and all that, and then I \u2014 I get the letters\nfrom them, and they say, your story was so real, I\u2014 I went home and I talked to my\nparents. I\u2019m going to talk about it, just as you said, I will talk about it with people,\nas long as I can. I \u2014 oh, kind of remarks like that, that\u2019s what moves me. Social\ncontext just don\u2019t. So that \u2014 that was \u2014 that was what evolved, and if you ask me to\n146\nJuly 14, 2015\ndescribe it clinically, why that happened, I couldn\u2019t. A psychologist, psychiatrist\nmight, but I\u2019m not sure they could either.",
        "Q: Oh, this is why I asked from the spiritual perspective. It is \u2014 it is \u2014",
        "A: Spiritual yes, preserving Judaism, because I got \u2014 even though I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not\nvery well informed on it, but from all that I have read, and all that I learned about\nwhat Judaism stand for, it\u2019s all the good things in life.

        "A: I read his book. I read that very book of \u2014 of his, and that \u2014 that struck me. Just\nfairly recently, this maybe a year or so ago. And I said \u2014 and I\u2014I wrote, and I\nwanted to put it in the text. And Heidi and I went over it. Didn\u2019t \u2014 somehow just\ndidn\u2019t quite fit in the \u2014 in the text. Was a little bit too emotional. But, whatever. But\nthat gave me the rationale. I said, Frankl, what he preached, way back then, that\u2019s \u2014\nthat \u2014 that\u2019s me. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what I became. So I was a di\u2014 a disciple of him \u2014 of\nhis. Didn\u2019t know him, didn\u2019t know his work.",
        "Q: But it spoke to you.",
        "A: He spoke. He must have spoken to me, yeah. So \u2014 and that \u2014 that became my \u2014\nmy remaining life\u2019s work. But helping others find meaning in their life. That\u2019s the\nmeaning in my life, 1s helping others find meaning in their lives. And that\u2019s what he\n\u2014 that was the theme that he \u2014 he preached. And the fact that he was a concentration\ncamp survivor himself, and went through all that. And his experience, when he saw\npeople who gave up, Jews who gave up on life in the camps, others who pulled\nthemselves through, by maintaining that conviction about life. And he, of course,\nwas one of them. But oh, that \u2014 that experience.",
        "Q: It\u2019s pretty powerful.",
        "A: That did it.",
        "Q: Yeah.\n148July 14, 2015",

        "A: Okay. It\u2019s dated Germany, April 26, 1945. \u201cDear Mom and Pop, I\u2019m so happy, I\ncould cry. Just a few ye \u2014 hours ago, I received a letter from European theater of\noperations headquarters, telling me that Bob was okay. Here is the first paragraph\nof the letter: Dear Corporal Max, I\u2019m very happy to report that your brother, PFC\n149July 14, 2015\nRobert R. Max, ASN 15311529, was liberated by our advancing forces, from a ger\n\u2014 German \u2014 from a German prisoner of war camp, on 4 April, 1945, after having\nbeen previously reported as missing in action on 4 January, 1945. I\u2019d previously\nwritten to Bob\u2019s company clerk, and his answer was written before the report of\nBob\u2019s liberation was received, at Sixth Armored Division headquarters. So, along\nwith the letter from ETO headquarters, came a letter from Sixth Armored, dated\neight days earlier, stating that there was no further news of Bob. The letter read, in\npart, PFC Max was with his company as they attacked enemy positions, about one\nand a half miles northeast of Marvie, Belgium, on je \u2014 on 4 January, 1945. An\nenormous amount of armored enemy artillery, mortar and small arms fire, was\nencountered, and squads and individuals became separated at times, because of the\nnecessity of seeking protection from this fire. After this engagement, PFC Max was\nnot present. A search was made of the vicinity, but he could neither be found, nor\naccounted for, and up to the present date, there had been no further information on\nyour brother. Well, further information came today, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever\nreceived anything that made me happier. Captain Budrogy(ph) informed me that all\nprisoners of war, for more than 30 days, are returned to the United States. If that is\nso, there is an excellent chance of your seeing him soon. I wish I could, too. If he is\ngoing to be reassigned, I\u2019d like to get him into my outfit. Better still, I'd like to see\n150July 14, 2015\nhim stay in the States. I intend asking Captain Budrogy\u2019s(ph) advice tomorrow.\nWhat can I add to a letter like this? I\u2019m overjoyed, and can\u2019t think of another thing\nright now. I know how happy you both must be, and I know now that God must\nhave heard your prayers. All I can say is that we have a lot to be thankful for. Call\nDiana when you receive this letter. I\u2019m too excited to write any more tonight. When\nI calm down, I\u2019m going to write Bob at Central Postal Directory, APO 640, U.S.\nArmy, and within few days, I\u2019m going to send you the letters for safekeeping. Right\nnow I want to enjoy them myself. Write soon, and God bless you. Love to Ruthie.\u201d",

And I don\u2019t remember anything particular about \u2014 about it, just\nthat my mother was very particular about Friday nights, and Saturday mornings.\nAnd people don\u2019t always think that, well, you were a Reform Jew, so you\u2019re not\nthat ritualistic, I mean, you\u2019re not that tied to it. But m-m-my mother was.",
        "A: And that carried on through my youth. Friday nights were always \u2014 always\nsacrosanct. You went to temple Friday night, and that\u2019s what I did.",
        "A: From my earliest years. As a matter of fact, when we moved to the Vailsburg\nsection, I was athletic, and I was part of an athletic group. Just a group that\neventually just \u2014 was just below semi-professional. There were oth \u2014 there was onlyJuly 14, 2015\none other Jew in the group, the others were all Christians. There were Poles and\nItalians. This is in the Vailsburg section of Newark. They knew, though, and they\nrespected the fact that Friday nights I would not hang out with them at the local\nsoda shop. And they respected that very, very highly, as I respected their Christian\nfaith, too. And I \u2014 well, some \u2014 some \u2014 some \u2014 sometime later, when it came time\nfor my first Bar Mitzvah \u2014 this is something that I \u2014 I \u2014 I remember so vividly\nbecause it was so unusual. I invited all of the \u2014 the athletic group to my Bar Mitzvah\nservice. And when I say the temple B\u2019Nai Jeshurun was ultra, ultra liberal, the Bar\nMitzvah boy did not read from the Torah. All I did was prayer, the prayer before\nand after the reading of the Torah, and a speech. Now it\u2019s Saturday morning, and\nI\u2019m at my Bar Mitzvah, and I \u2014 I get up to make a speech. And I do, the typical\nboys\u2019 Bar Mitzvah, so today I am a man, etcetera. And when I finish \u2014 these guys,\nthere must have been 10 or 11 of them, they got up, and they started to clap. Yo,\nBobby. They cheered, they whistled. The decorum, mostly on a Saturday morning,\nelderly women, very reserved, and so forth, they looked, and I saw the heads \u2014 I\ncould see from the \u2014 from the bema, the heads of the people just dropped, oh my\nGod. They\u2019re just wa \u2014 wa-waving their heads from side to side. They had never\nseen a demonstration like that before. However, as I say, my \u2014 my friends,\nChristians, were very ver \u2014 very, very well aware that Friday night I would not hangJuly 14, 2015\nout. But I \u2014 as \u2014 in recip \u2014 reciprocating for their coming to my Bar Mitzvah, I\nattended Catholic midnight mass \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that year, yes, I went to the Sacred Heart church in Vailsburg section in\nNewark, to be, because they were all Christians, and they were there at the church,\nso I said, I will come to your church now. And I did.",
        "A: Its a\u2014",
        "A: It \u20141t would \u2014 I \u2014 I think it was probably unique, because most everybody I\nknew, as \u2014 over the years, as I\u2019ve grown up, most everybody I knew, certainly in the\nJewish world, that ber \u2014 that grew up in Newark, grew up in the Weequahic\nsection of Newark, which was \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I think of it as a rich man\u2019s ghetto, because\nit was all Jewish, but there were nice homes, and well-to-do people. Others that\nwere not well-to-do, too, but it was preserved very, very well, as long as they were\nthere. So I always felt that I missed out on something that was significant. I never\nhad \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014I did not live in wa \u2014 in a Jewish section, did not live near Jewish\npeople, but I never had any acts of anti-Semitism, despite the fact that I \u2014 I evolved,July 14, 2015\ncircu \u2014 circulated in a Christian world. Just never ran into it. And somehow I \u2014 I felt\neven deprived, because of the experience. You have to know what anti-Semitism is,\nyou have to feel it yourself, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve always believed, and I fe \u2014 I didn\u2019t feel it. It\nwasn\u2019t until later on in life that I really got to understand it. Well, I studied it more,\nand became active in community life things. But no, I was deprived of one of the \u2014 I\nshouldn\u2019t call it a joy, but one of the experiences that many young Jewish boys went\nthrough.",
        "A: As nice a one as I could have wanted, yeah.",
        "A: Like father and son. My father worked very often in the eve \u2014 evenings. And\nLester \u2014 eight years older, it was a pretty big spread. He took over as \u2014 as my\nfather. At the age of three \u2014 I have pictures of that remarkable \u2014 he bought me a\nNew York Yankee baseball uniform; cleats, a glove, bat and ball.",
        "A: And he wa \u2014 he wou \u2014 the house that we lived on, that I mentioned, on South\nOrange Avenue in Newark, had a backyard, and there was a fence separating itJuly 14, 2015\nfrom the house behind. He pitched to me. Now, I shouldn\u2019t say \u2014 and \u2014 and I swung\nthe bat, but really, he was a good pitcher, and he would hit the bat. He kept my\nbatting average \u2014 and the best that I can remember, one season he had me batting\n.575. Now that was even bigger \u2014 much, much bigger than Ted Williams .400\nbatting average, you know\u201d? And he kept record of homeruns, the fence was about\nmaybe a hundred feet away, li\u2014 and so, every now and then he would hit the bat\nperfectly, and I would swing a little bit, and we go over the fence. So we kept my\nhomerun record, and all of that. He taught me baseball, took me to Rupert Stadium\nin Newark, the trolley was right across the street from our house, took us down to\nNewark, and followed the New York Yankee, the farm team, the Newark Bears.\nBut \u2014 so he \u2014 he re-really \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014I guessed, introduced me to sports, all sports, and\nI think acted very much like a \u2014 a \u2014a father. When he \u2014",

And during the war \u2014\nyou know, World War II was partially \u2014 par-partially financed by the American\npeople. There were signs all over, buy war bonds. And so he bought war bonds for\nme. I was just \u2014 just a young kid yet. So I already had war bonds going for me. He\nwas that \u2014",

And I used to listen to baseball \u2014 again, my \u2014 I mentioned my\nbrother had really introduced me to baseball, maybe a New York Yankee. And so I\nused to listen to the Yankee game certainly, but I listened to the Newark Bears\ngames, too, and Earl Harper was the announcer. They had to describe what was\ngoing on in the field, to gi \u2014 give you on \u2014 the only representation you could get,\nwhat, literally, was happening. So I remember Earl Harper, I sit down, and I was\nlistening, he said, the si\u2014 the wind-up, the pitcher wind-up, the stretch, the pitch,\nand there goes a booming drive, going \u2014 look a \u2014 deep, deep center field, and \u2014 and\n\u2014 and a\u2014 and Roy Schalk steps back on the grass and takes it. Roy Schalk was\nsecond baseman. So that description of this long, long drive going out to center\nfield, was really caught by the second baseman, who just stepped back onto the\ngrass, and all that.

        "A: Well, obviously, I was aware that the Japanese had struck, and we were in a war\nin the Pacific islands. It didn\u2019t affect me very, very much, until, you know, four\ndays later, December 11, 1941, that Adolf Hitler declared war on America. Now itJuly 14, 2015\nwas a different \u2014 different story. First of all, Hitler, Nazi \u2014 Nazi Germany, Jews,\nall of that began to register on me, as I \u2014 as I mentioned, I read newspapers, so I\nknew what was going on. That started to register. In 1941, I graduated high school,\nthen 1942, headed for college.",
        "A: September of 1942, I guess that\u2019s when it was. Pretty sure. And I was what, 19 at\nthe time. Oh, I\u2019m s \u2014I\u2019m sorry. My first year, I did not go to Ohio University. My\nfirst year wa \u2014 I went to New York University. It was convenient, I didn\u2019t have to\ngo traveling any place. I could just \u2014 oh, about a half mile from my home, I could\nget on a bus, and travel to Newark, take a train into New York, and I went to New\nYork University, the fi-first \u2014 first year. And that\u2019s when I read newspapers a great\ndeal, during \u2014 during travel to and from the city. And that\u2019s when I \u2014 I knew what\nwas going on, and \u2014 with Nazis. I knew the concentration camps were be \u2014\nbeginning, Hitler\u2019s plan of the \u2014 his gru \u2014 his \u2014 his book.",
        "A: \u201cMein Kampf.\u201d All of that, so I \u2014I got really \u2014 so I[\u2014 I\u2014I knew what was going\non. The reality is that I had to leave this area. I had terrible sinusitis, and the doctor\nsaid, you must get out of this area, because otherwise you\u2019re going to have trouble\nbreathing, constantly. Pick an area out in the Midwest. I had a classmate, who knewJuly 14, 2015\nI was ma \u2014 m-majoring in journalism, had a classmate, who told me about this\nlovely, little school, small town in Ohio, Athens, Ohio. Ohio University.

It\nwas re \u2014 very, very rugged training, and I was put in very good physical, and I think\nemotional shape there. But no \u2014 the \u2014 of note, when I got to Fort Dix, I was called\ninto the office, and there was a \u2014 a man leading the music. And you know, they had\na band, a swing band, and his name was Jack Leonard. He had been with the\nTommy Dorsey orchestra. He preceded Frank Sinatra as the vocalist for that\norchestra. So he \u2014 like ma \u2014 like so many of the musa \u2014 musicians, so many, many\nof them, the bandleaders and all, they all volunteered, and went in the service.\nGlenn Miller, you know what happened to him.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. Glenn Miller, of course, had probably the most \u2014 certainly one\nof the most popular bands. We called them swing bands, dance bands. They had one\nof the most popular ones, had a unique sound, that he created for his orchestra. And\nhe \u2014 I believe he volunteered. He became a captain, then a major, and he was\nleading \u2014 he had a\u2014 a\u2014 a World War II band, a counterpart of what he had in\ncivilian life. And they played some of the same music, again. And he used to travel\nto the bases, where the troops were, overseas, and play concerts, jazz co \u2014 swing\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nconcerts for them. Glenn Miller disappeared in a flight from Great Britain, over to\nNormandy. They never, never di \u2014 were \u2014 never discovered, what happened. He \u2014\nhe was off, they were going over to France to entertain the troops, and the plane\ndisappeared. And there are many, many stories and beliefs as to how it disappeared,\nbut somewhere over the English channel, Glenn Miller \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 was hit, and was \u2014 and disappear \u2014 dis-disappeared. But my experience in the \u2014\nin music, some of the \u2014 some of the members may have been from his band, too, but\nI \u2014 when I ca \u2014 when I came \u2014 oh, I didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t tell you how I got to be there. I \u2014\nI played in local bands here. So I played clarinet and saxophone. So I get there, and\nI\u2019m called into the office. And they tell me that Jack Leonard would like to see\nyou. I says, why would he want to see me? So I went to him. He said, kid, I see you\nplay saxophone, clarinet. How could he know that? We didn\u2019t have computers in\nthose days, how did he know? Somehow it was on my record that I had been\nplaying with bands. He said, I\u2014 I\u2019m going to give you a weekend pass. I want you\nto come play in the \u2014 play wi \u2014 in the band here. And he give me a weekend pass.\nGo back to South Orange, come back with your instruments. And I did. It was a\ntotally different life. No more KP. I didn\u2019t have to even make my bed. Every \u2014\neverything was cared for me. I was now a musician among the elite, I guess. All I \u2014July 14, 2015\nI didn\u2019t have any chores, no potato peeling, nothing. And I practiced in the morning,\nwent to rehearsal. We rehearsed in the afternoon. We would broadcast on radio at\nnight.",
        "A: It was a great life. Huh?",
        "A: Live, yes, live broadcasts, and I \u2014 it was as great a life as anybody could\nimagine. I me \u2014 war\u2019s going on, here I am playing music here. I can play \u2014 I could\npossibly play \u2014 play the rest of the war, just sitting there, and playing with\nmusicians. I was intimidated, in a way. I looked around me \u2014 cause I \u2014 I used to\nfollow these big bands, and I knew \u2014 I knew who the \u2014 who the \u2014 the side men\nwere. And these were not musicians, frankly, like today\u2019s musicians. They were\ntrained in Juilliard, and places like that. They could orchestrate, arrange, compose.\nSo they were great musicians, the best of their day. And there I am sitting with\nthem, and trying to keep place with them. The very first number we play was a\nnumber from Benny g \u2014 Benny Goodman orchestra created, called \u201cSix Flats\nUnfurnished.\u201d That means the music is written in the \u2014 1n six flats, and six flats, it\nmakes it tougher to play. And here I am, sitting with all these great musicians, andJuly 14, 2015\nplaying a tough piece. And oh, tha-that was \u2014 that was \u2014 that was difficult. At any\nrate, that went on. Could have \u2014 could have remained.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think more than maybe a few weeks.",
        "A: It could have been a great life. I think I could have spent probably the entire war\nplaying music. My name came up to be shipped out for basic training. Jack\nLeonard intervenes, and gets the name stripped off. And I say, Jack\n[indecipherable] he said. I said, I \u2014 I\u2014 Jack, I \u2014 I do want to g \u2014 want to go \u2014 yeah,\nI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m in the army, I\u2019m 20 years old. I just can\u2019t imagine \u2014 I don\u2019t say to him,\nbut I can\u2019t imagine that I\u2019m going to spend the war here. I know many of my peep \u2014\nmy age, are going overseas, and they\u2019re \u2014 some of them probably losing their lives\n[indecipherable] and whatever. But my place is not here, it\u2019s there. So I say, Jack,\nI want to go out \u2014 I\u2014I want to \u2014 I want to go on the list again. I said, I\u2019ll go out, and\nyou know, eventually I\u2019Il come back here. He said, kid, you leave here, you\u2019re\nnever coming back again. And he was right, of course. I \u2014 I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t dictate to\nthe army where I go. But so \u2014 so that was it, and I \u2014 I left the band. He took care of\nshipping my instruments back to South Orange, and I was off, basic training.",
        "A: Alabama, yes.",
        "A: Oh, good. Okay. [break]",
        "A: Well, so shortly after I made that determination, that I was \u2014 I was ready, I \u2014I\nwanted army life, I was put a \u2014 placed on an or \u2014 a shipping order, to be shipped\nout. And we took a very circuitous route. I don\u2019t know why in America, they felt\nthere may be threats, and we didn\u2019t go directly down to Alabama, but sort of\nweaved \u2014 weaved around. And I was told it was for security purposes. But we got to\nFort McClellan, deep into Alabama. And immediately I knew that I was going to\nhave a very, very hot summer. Temperatures at Fort McClellan in Alabama, rose\nat times to over a hundred degrees.",
        "A: So, it was a very, very hot, difficult summer. But was a \u2014 it was a standard\ntraining camp. What \u2014 what \u2014 one of the difficulties we had was that it was staffedJuly 14, 2015\nby what we called cadre, c-a-d-r-e, cadre. These are old-time army men who have\nbeen through the wars. And here was a bunch of young, college, smart-aleck kids\ncoming down. They were not going to let us get away with an easy training period.\nTraining was three months. They gave us the most difficult forced marches. One of\nthe \u2014 one of the ultimate requirements was that we march, fully loaded with\nequipment, backpacks, and all \u2014 all th \u2014 and all the \u2014 the equipment that we would\nnormally carry into battle. And we ru \u2014 march over Bain Gap. Bain Gap was a\nvery, very hilly mountain. And some had trouble making it. Certainly in the \u2014 in the\nhot temperatures in which we were marching. We did it. I think just not everybody\nmade \u2014 made the march. That irritated them, and they said, you\u2019re going back,\nyou\u2019re going to do it again. And they made us march over Bain Gap, twice.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, we di \u2014 different dates.",
        "A: But the \u2014 us-usually part of the training was for building your endurance, your\nability to survive in combat, where you have to do forced marches. But because we\nall made it, they \u2014 you know, thi-this was emotional, more \u2014 more than tactical. So,\nyou got to march again, so we had to go over it again. The obstacle courses they set\nup for us, were very, very difficult. Yeah, you\u2019re climbing walls out of \u2014 you \u2014 youJuly 14, 2015\nrun, cl \u2014 pull yourself on a rope, and go over. And jump over ponds, and you had to\njump far enough, otherwise you landed in the water. Rather tough exercises. So they\nput us through a very strenuous program. I believe at that time I \u2014 oh, I\u2014 I was a\nphysical en-enthusiast. I took the Charles Atlas bodybuilding course, because I was\nvery small, and I had to build up \u2014 if I was small \u2014 I may be small in stature, but I\nwill not be small in body and strength. So I took the Charles Atlas bodybuilding\ncourse, which was very popular at that time. So I had some things going for me\nalready. That, plus the training that we got at Fort McClellan, I \u2014 I think, to a large\nextent, saved my life later \u2014 later on. One of the difficult things that also happened\nat Fort McClellan, is that it was a\u2014 a \u20141t was a cu \u2014 a prisoner of war camp for\nGerman soldiers. And I didn\u2019t know, but they apparently, when they were captured\noverseas, some of them were sent over here, to s \u2014 to POW camps. Fort McClellan\nwas a POW camp. Now, their treatment of prisoners \u2014 our treatment of prisoners, I\nshould say, as opposed to theirs, very, very different. They \u2014 as we were marching\non the-these \u2014 these tough \u2014 these obstacle courses, the marches, they would stand\nin the fenced-in area, laughing at us, because we were being \u2014 we were the ones\nwho were being pushed, and they were living a \u2014 a wonderful life. They were\nbronzed. You know, they had no shirts, and they were absorbing the sun. They\ndidn\u2019t have to march in the sun, they just absorbed it. They had the rights to go toJuly 14, 2015\nthe post exchange, where they could get cigarettes, candy, any \u2014 anything that was\navailable. They were living wonderful lives, and there they were, ridiculing us, and\nlaughing \u2014 laughing at us. And so in \u2014 as I write, later on, I say, hm, but look at how\nthings turned out. The guy they were laughing at, turns out to have survived, and\nmany of them, I\u2019m sure, did not. That was compensation. So Fort McClellan,\nagain, was very difficult, but it did prepare us well for what lie ahead, and \u2014 lay\nahead. And then, after three months \u2014",
        "A: What?",
        "A: We\u2019ve had three months there, and really, it was a wa \u2014 it was a very good, a ver\n\u2014very good life. On Sunday mornings, we were pretty free, to do what \u2014 we could \u2014\nwe could go to the mess hall, and order up \u2014 what we used to order \u2014 to get at home.\nOn Sunday morning, get breakfast. I used to be able to go up and tell the chef \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t think we called them chef, we called them cooks, but I could tell him I wanted\neggs, bacon, toast on the side, yeah. Yeah. And we were getting that. And this was\narmy life? My gosh. It was a tough, tough camp, but sa \u2014 some of the relief on \u2014 on\n\u2014 on Sundays, made it palatable. The heat was so great, that it was not uncommon\nfor people to pass out on the parade ground, when we were being marched, and allJuly 14, 2015\nthat. And the only time in my life that I ever came about as close as you can get to\npassing out, I \u2014 I sustained myself. Hundred degree temperatures, sun pouring\ndown, and we\u2019re standing out in that sun, and we\u2019re marching and marching. And I\n\u2014I felt weakness, and I \u2014 I just didn\u2019t want to drop out. I remember getting to the\nbarracks, to the steps, and fine \u2014 just about making the few steps I had to my bed,\nand then throwing myself on my bed. But had the great satisfaction that I didn\u2019t\npass out on the parade ground. So again, very, very good, good basic training.\nTough but good, at Fort McClellan.",
        "A: Then we moved on. The army developed a \u2014 a program they called the Army\nSpecialized Training Program. It was to train soldiers, those who had some college\neducation \u2014 I believe that was the criteria that was used, you \u2014 you had to have\nsome education. You were being trained in one or two schools, either engineering \u2014\nthey always needed engineers, or foreign languages. Foreign languages would have\nbeen much more appropriate for me, because the last thing I \u2014 I \u2014 I was in \u2014 I was \u2014\nhad any talent for, was engineering. That\u2019s the way the army did things, though.\nThey always wanted to train you the army way, not some habit you might have\npicked up in civilian life. And so, because I knew nothing about engineering, that\u2019s\nthe school I went to. So, from Fort McClellan, I went to Alabama PolytechnicJuly 14, 2015\nInstitute. Later became Auburn University. We had a campus life, we \u2014 we lived\nin dorms on the campus. We still had marching drills, but we had classroom studies.",
        "A: That came later on, when we \u2014 I\u2014 when we tried to go to officer candidate\nschool.",
        "A: [\u2019ll come to that in a \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 ina few minutes. Because it all started where we \u2014 where we\u2019re at now \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 at Auburn University. We \u2014 so we attended class. We didn\u2019t \u2014 we di \u2014 did\nmilitary drills, and \u2014 and got some lectures on military stuff. But we attended class.\nThe \u2014 they had to reach far and wide to get in st \u2014 enough instructors for those\nprograms. And I remember the instructor I had in engineering, was an English tea \u2014\nprofessor in college. So, he was only a few pages ahead of us. And some of the guys\nwho I was with, were really engineering oriented people, and they were being held\nback. For me it was o \u2014 okay, cause I knew nothing about engineering, but that\u2019s the\nway they did things. We \u2014 so, in addition to our studies, we had our weekendsJuly 14, 2015\nreasonably free. There were four of us from the New York area, people \u2014 people\nthat I knew, and we formed a \u2014 a group \u2014 like, we \u2014 we were what was a \u2014 musical\npromotors. We \u2014 on Saturday nights, we would have concerts. What were the\nconcerts? The big bands of the day were the \u2014 we had a-all on record, in my\ndormitory room, and we would invite everybody in, we\u2019d have drinks and \u2014 and \u2014\nand \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 was just \u2014 huh? Music, we had music. And I remember the kickoff \u2014 I think it\nwas the kickoff concert we had, was \u2014 we called it an awa \u2014 it \u2014 it was the bu \u2014 the\n\u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the finest black musicians of their day. And there were many, many,\nreally some of the top, top musicians. And we had all them, you know, Count\nBasie, Duke Eli-Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald. You know, all the great, great artists.\nAnd \u2014 and that was all records, so people poured into the dormitory. So that was our\n\u2014 our release, our relief from the pressures we were under.",
        "A: Yes, because the people \u2014 th-those who \u2014 those of us that they brought together\nwere from all parts of the country, and so obviously we met new acquaintances,\nwho became some of the \u2014 who became buddies, and friends. And enemies, too.\nThe reason I knew that the \u2014 when I say enemies \u2014 the reason I knew that we were \u2014\nthat I had gotten some real good out of the training at Fort McClellan, was that\nwhile we were there, we had one guy, he was about \u2014 he was over six feet tall, well\nbuilt, and all that. And he was too \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what we called him, but too\nG.I. He \u2014 he \u2014 he fa \u2014 every \u2014 everything \u2014 the script \u2014 you had to be right,\nmilitarily do this right, march right, you know, everything like that. And it bothered\nthe other guys. I mean, we were normal \u2014 normal boys, you know, thrown into army\nlife, and he was very militaristic, and he got on their nerves. And one day, I\u2014 we\ngot into an argument, and I just was determined on ma \u2014 I\u2019m many inches shorter\nthan he, I\u2019m lots smaller, lighter in weight, but I\u2019m going to take this guy on. And I\ndid, and I beat him. You know, wrestling, and stren \u2014 very strenuous wrestling, and\nI brought him down. And \u2014 and \u2014 and the \u2014 and the guys cheered, you know, and \u2014\nand it helped build relationships. I remember his name, Bob \u2014 Bob Loring(ph).\nAnd I remember that. But the \u2014 anyway, so our experience there was interesting, but\nit was going nowhere. The battle losses in Europe were becoming very heavy.July 14, 2015",
        "A: June \u2014 that was June 6\", 1944.",
        "A: Four \u2014 no, I think \u2014 I think on the landing \u2014 oh yeah, it had to be \u2014 yes, it had to\nbe after the landing, because our troops had \u2014 had landed, and they were engaged in\nbattle, acro \u2014 acro \u2014 across France, and all that, and our losses. Even though we\nmoved rapidly \u2014 the British and American forces did move rapidly after \u2014 they were\nbogged down in Saint-L6. And then after they broke out of there, and then they\nmoved right across. But the \u2014 1n doing so, the losses were heavy, and with those\nlosses building up, the army looked at programs like ASTP, and said, we have to\nabandon them, because we need ground troops overseas. So they did. And we were",
        "A: Engineering school, American special \u2014 Army Specialized Training Program.\nThe navy had a counterpart to that. The \u2014 so that program was to be abandoned, and\nwe were going to go into the infantry. That didn\u2019t sound very glamorous, so a whole\nbunch of us applied in two directions; one, to officer candidate school. Now, we \u2014\nwe didn\u2019t know at the time, if you \u2014 if you go to officer candidate school, youJuly 14, 2015\ngraduate, you become a lieutenant, a let \u2014 lieutenant\u2019s place was at the front, not in\nthe back. If you were a major, you could be in the back, but as a lieutenant, you\nwere more exposed than anybody else. But we just liked the idea. I did, anyway. I\nwanted to become an officer. And I always had \u2014 had second thoughts about that,\nbecause I was small. I wanted to be good. And I was so young. By this time, I was\n21. And I said, many of the people I will be leading, though, many of these guys,\nthey\u2019re going to be older than I, they\u2019re going to be bigger than I, and I \u2014 can I\ncommand their respect? It was \u2014 there were doubts that I had. But nevertheless,\nrather than fight in the \u2014 in the ground \u2014 ground \u2014 in the ground troops, it would be\nnice to be an officer. And the other thing that we went for, air ca \u2014 air cadet \u2014 the air\ncadet academy in \u2014 it was in \u2014 in Georgia. We a \u2014 I just became fascinated, and\nmost of us did, with aircraft. Like, you wouldn\u2019t have to be on the ground, and in\nthe mud, and all that, you\u2019d be flying in the air. You know, like 1t was a\u2014a-\u2014 an\neasy job. It certainly wasn\u2019t. The dangers that they were exposed to were as bad as\nanything on the ground. But anyway, a whole group of us applied for both. I\nremember going to the interview for a \u2014 for a\u2014 to become an officer. It was the\nmost austere setting I can ever, ever remember. I walk into this room, and all I see is\na long, long table, as far as I can see, of men sitting. Brass, all officers, high-rankingJuly 14, 2015\nofficers. I\u2019d never seen so much brass in my \u2014 in my life. And not a smile on\nanyone\u2019s face.",
        "A: And I had to be interviewed by them. I\u2019m 20 \u2014 you know, 21 years old, I had\nnever been subjected to anything like that. It was grueling, but I think I did well,\nand I think everybody thought they did well enough. On the \u2014 then we had to take\nwritten exams. We never did find out how we did on the written exams. During that\nsame time, I don\u2019t rem-remember who was there before or after, we applied to \u2014 to\ngo to air \u2014 the air academy and become fliers. So we did the same thing there, appli\n\u2014 applied there. In each \u2014 oh, and \u2014 and we became so infatuated with aircraft, that\nwe s \u2014 instead of doing our studies at ASTP, at night we\u2019d run through the halls,\nflying like planes. You know, we\u2019re young guys still, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re airplanes now.\nAnd we learned the silhouettes of every plane. We could identify every American\nand every German plane. Which was important to know, whether it\u2019s your enemy\ncoming at you, or one of your \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 or one of your \u2014 one of your own. So, w-we \u2014 we were all air-minded by that\ntime. We were all ready to go off to the air. As it turned out, because of the huge\nneeds now overseas for ground troops, both programs were canceled, and we\u2019re all\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nsent on our way. We went to \u2014 oh, oh, for \u2014 for \u2014 for more \u2014 now, combat training,\nfirst was basic training, combat training, so I then \u2014 I was sent to \u2014 to Indiana,\nCamp Atterbury in \u2014 near Indianapolis, in Indiana. And there were got combat\ntraining. I learned to be able to, in the dark, strip down my \u2014 strip down and put\ntogether my rifle. You had to be ab \u2014 you had to be able to do that, because who\nknow \u2014 under battle conditions, it may be nighttime, and yet your battle \u2014 your \u2014\nyour rifle was your best friend in combat. If you were without that, you were in\ntrouble. So we learned to do that. But one of the things that the army did again, as\nthey did with ASTP, they assigned you to units in which you had no experience. I\nwas assigned to the motor pool. I knew not much more about an automobile engine\nthan the fact that \u2014 I knew there was a carburetor, I knew there were spark plugs,\nand I knew somewhere, something created a spark, and that ignited the gasoline,\nand that created the power. That\u2019s all I knew, but I \u2014 about wha \u2014 what was under\nthe hood, I never had any experience with. So I\u2019m assigned to the motor pool. So in\naddition to ki \u2014 getting combat training, I got training in mechanics, and that. And\nso that \u2014 that\u2019s what I did for a very, very short time. Again, they had to abbreviate\nit, because we\u2019re now needed overseas. So I shipped out of there.",

Which was an indication of\nhow everybody, everybody, every business, every everything \u2014 everything was\ndevoted to the war. General Motors stopped making automobiles, they made tanks,\ninstead. The luxury bo-bo-boats were converted into troop carriers, and so I was on\nthis luxury troop carrier. We sailed overseas, and landed in \u2014 landing in Liverpool.\nWhen we got to liver \u2014 to Liverpool, that was just a weigh station, waiting to take\nus across the English channel. We made it to Liverpool, and I remember standing\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nup on the deck and looking down, and there were people holding newspapers, s \u2014\nMauritania, the SS Mauritania, which what we sailed on, SS Mauritania sunk.\nWell, there \u2014 there were Nazi submarines all across the Atlantic, and the navigators\non those ships had to weave their way across to try to avoi-void them. Many of our\ntr \u2014 many of our supply carrier ships were \u2014 were \u2014 were bombed, wa-was \u2014 were \u2014\nwere destroyed in the Atlantic Ocean, never getting overseas. And some troop\ncarriers were hit. But anyway, we get there, and th-the paper said, Mauritania\nsunk. And we\u2019re looking down, we\u2019re here. So we trained a little bit more.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t sunk.",

        "A: And the \u2014 this news reporter thought he had a \u2014 a super story, you know, a\nScoop.",
        "A: And there were to defy his scoop. So, we did land, and we trained a li-little bit\nmore in Liverpool, and then set sail on a Liberty ship, across the English channel.\nNow, we were to link up with units we were going to battle with \u2014 that we wereJuly 14, 2015\ngoing to battle for \u2014 with. And sailing across the English channel was not a simple\nthing. You started off in a Liberty ship, which 1s a very small, small version of\nthese large, bi-big ocean liners. Started off in one of those. But to get to shore, you\nhad to go \u2014 you had to descend from that ship, to an LST, yeah, a landing ship tank.\nThere was different versions of that, they were called different names, but I think\nthe one we were on was an LST. And you probably have seen pictures of landing\ntroops during D-Day \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 those \u2014 those little boats that came into shore, as close as they could get, then\nthese big doors come down.",
        "A: And then the soldiers are off, into the water. St \u2014 the big \u2014 the most difficult part\nof that trip was fir-fir-first of all recognizing, you know, now \u2014 now, this 1s for real,\nbecause you \u2014 you \u2014 your \u2014 you\u2019re di \u2014 you\u2019re going to face the enemy pretty soon.\nNow you have gas masks, rifles on \u2014 on your \u2014 on your shoulders, and on your\nback. And so this is \u2014 this is combat. The treacherous part of that trip was the\nexchange you made from the liberty ship, down to the LST, because you had to\nclimb down on a net. And we were warned in advance, one false step, and it may\nmean your life. So you had to place each foot perfectly. We had about 30 pounds ofJuly 14, 2015\nequipment on our backs; rifles, gas masks, everything we would carry into battle.\nSo, you had to si \u2014 watch your step. I was very, very careful. Some did not make it.\nI heard stories about many on D-Day who slipped and fell between the ships. Now,\nthe little ship 1s bobbing, and there \u2014 the two ships are crashing together. Some were\ncrushed before they ever even got to shore. So I climbed down cautiously, and got\ninto the ship. Now, for some strange reason, this \u2014 I mentioned earlier, this group\nwith me at \u2014 that ran the concerts, the \u2014 one of them was with me yet. He turned out\nlater in life to be in adver \u2014 an advertising executive for one of the big advertising\nfirms in New York. But he wa \u2014 he was that kind of a person. For some reason he\nbought a camera, he brought a camera. We\u2019re going into combat, and Herb has a\ncamera. And he says, Bob, tell you what to do. As soon as that door goes down, I\u2019m\ngoing to be right up front, I\u2019m going to get off first, and then I want you to come\nout, and I\u2019m going to take a picture of you landing on Omaha Beach. And he did.\nHe got a \u2014 and the \u2014 and the door goes down, you know. And this \u2014 this is crazy,\nreally crazy thi-thinking, to begin with. You\u2019re going into combat, maybe just hours\naway from the enemy, and you\u2019re taking a photograph. Anyway, Herb did take that\nphotograph. I never did see it. Along the way, we separated, he went to another unit,\nand \u2014 and I saw him in New York after the war, and Herb \u2014 he was with a big\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nadvertising company. But he \u2014 he said, I don\u2019t know what happened Bob, but I lost\nit. Oh, terrible. But \u2014",

        "A: We were not \u2014 we were not yet mature soldiers. It would take a little seasoning,\nunder ca \u2014 under combat conditions, for us to wise up to what it was all about. And\nthat, as a matter of fact, was characteristic of my early days in combat. I still did not\nrecognize that this is a very serious business. But anyway, I was assigned to the six\n\u2014 sixth armored, and we did land, climbed that route up in the mountains. Enemy\nfire was not too far away. I was assigned to the Sixth Armored Infantry Division.\nWe rode half-tracks.",

Anywhere from four to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\neight \u2014 eight, four on each side, would sit in that. The back end had tracks, just like\n\u2014likea-\u2014a-",

        "A: Until they became obsolescent. And I\u2019Il explain that in a \u2014 in a\u2014 1n a moment.\nBut anyway, there we were, and we were assi \u2014 and I \u2014 I was assigned to that \u2014 to A\ncompany in tha \u2014 1n a platoon, and \u2014 and to that half-track. First days in combat, it\nwas, you know, it was still \u2014 still not real yet.",
        "A: We\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re in France now. Now we\u2019re driving across France to engage the\nenemy. We \u2014 the first day in camp, we are shelled by enemy forces. And those\nshells come over. It\u2019s a frightening feeling, but I still \u2014 still, 1t didn\u2019t register on me\nyet, because they \u2014 they passed over \u2014 the ones you hear are okay, the \u2014 you know,\nthey pass \u2014 they passed you. The ones that hit you are the ones you don\u2019t hear. You\ndon\u2019t hear the ones that hit you, because that \u2014 that sound passing overhead doesn\u2019tJuly 14, 2015\nget there. They \u2014 they come right at you. Anyway, those shells were passing\noverhead. We had a ca \u2014 a few in our half-track who had fought 1n the north African\ncampaign, they were used to this. And they knew when shells come in, that\u2019s\ndangerous. And they jumped \u2014 dropped to the floor, and I \u2014 I looked, and I\nwondered why. Well, th-they \u2014 they knew what \u2014 the seriousness of it. I still didn\u2019t\nknow. We \u2014 there were some German soldiers came out of the woods, they were g1-\ngi-giving up, with their hands up, threw their rifles away. And we had a machine-\ngunner on our vehicle who was firing at them. And I yelled, we all yelled, stop,\nstop, they\u2019re surrendering. And so other troops, other American troops came by,\ntook them away, and we continued the \u2014 the \u2014 we were a-a-approaching enemy\nterri-territory, and shells started to come in. The last place you want to be in a half-\ntrack is on a road that\u2019s zeroed in by en-enemy heavy artillery. And so we pulled it\noff the road. Now, we\u2019re off the road, but we\u2019re still being shelled. We sought\ncover. I jumped out of the half-track, because we were targets in there, no \u2014 no \u2014 no\nroof. And I \u2014 I jumped be \u2014 on the be \u2014 and I lay down on the back end of that.\nSome of the other fellows were in the front. I waved to them, there in the front,\nlooking back toward us, under \u2014 under the front axle of the vehicle. And they\u2019re\nlooking \u2014 and I\u2019m waving, they\u2019re not waving back. And again, I still hadn\u2019t gotten\nthe reality of warfare. This is very, very serious business. And then I see themJuly 14, 2015\ntaking stretchers, some of our men had been hit. It begins to have an effect, I said,\nyou know, this is a \u2014 a serious business. The next morning, I found out how serious\nit was. We \u2014 we pulled into a field, there were tanks, and there are half-tracks, and\nwe were told to dig in. Mean, you \u2014 you build a bu \u2014 you dig a bunker. I was still\nnot oriented yet to military life. I was a defiant, young, 21 year old, and ah, bunker.\nYou know, we\u2019ll be moving on, and all the \u2014 all the effort of going through a\nbunker. I didn\u2019t dig a bunker. Shellfire is in the morning, early. We call it incoming\nmail. The enemy always strikes at dawn. Incoming mail, those are the bombs are \u2014\nthese \u2014 these shells are \u2014 are landing. All of a sudden, my rifle is blown out of my\nhand, my hand stings. I look at my rifle lying on the ground, there\u2019s a hole in the \u2014\nin the ba \u2014 in the barrel of the rifle. So, a shell \u2014 a shell pierced the rifle, could have\npierced me, but didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yeah, but a quick, quick lesson. Suddenly it hits me, this is very serious\nbusiness. Every moment you\u2019re out here on this \u2014 on this field or any other battle\nfield, your life is in danger. So, quick, quick realization. From somewhere,\nsomebody came up and handed \u2014 and ga-gave me a rifle. So now I was in combat. I\nnever, never disobeyed that command again, to di-dig when \u2014 when we\u2019re \u2014 whenJuly 14, 2015\nwe\u2019re stopped for a while, you dig yourself a foxhole, and it could save your life,\nwhich it did \u2014 did. So that was my introduction to combat.",
        "A: It \u2014 1t was, and it was a strange, strange feeling. After a while, we abandoned the\nhalf-tracks, so we were on foot. And I remember proceeding on foot. We were\nfacing an enemy, we were firing, they were firing. The man in front of me, the man\nbehind me were both hit. And wa \u2014 my \u2014 first time I had seen anybody killed in\neven civilian life. And I stopped and I paused. Troops were moving on, and I just\npaused, and I looked at these two men, and I started to think, all the wonderful\nthings in life they will never see, never feel again. I \u2014 those thoughts just ran\nthrough my mind, not very formally, but tho \u2014 those kind of thoughts. And then I\nfound myself thinking about their families, they\u2019Il never be the same again, cause\nthe father, the brother, an uncle, aunt \u2014 an uncle, they were gone. And so, now I was\nreally introduced to warfare, and I took it very seriously from that \u2014 that point on.",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was my wake-up call.",
        "A: I realized this is it. You \u2014 you protect yourself, you go after the enemy, but don\u2019t\nforget about protecting yourself, because if you don\u2019t, you may end up like that.\nYou may end up anyway \u2014",

        "A: Why did what?",
        "A: The half-track?",

And whereas with troops \u2014 first of all,\ntroops have \u2014 have a way of separating, or getting into foxholes, and all that.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nThey\u2019re not quite tha-that kind of vulnera-vulnerability. But a half-track, sitting\nduck. It was a big enough vehicle to be a target, and \u2014 and they were hit \u2014",
        "A: A tank has much, much more protection. We had no protection. We had no \u2014 no\ntop. Tanks are \u2014 are \u2014 the armor 1s much, much thicker than we had, and they had\nprotection on all sides. So, we didn\u2019t have any of that protection. And that was just\n\u2014 those things that we rode in, those half-tracks, they were just vehicles to move us\nfaster. Otherwise, troops had to be moved by trucks, to get them up to s-speed, and\npart of \u2014 part of it was marching. But a good part of the time to get \u2014 get them up on\nbat \u2014 in \u2014 in the battlefield, was by truck. So, we had a lot of those trucks going.

A \u2014 very, very\neasy to zero in on any troops, or any vehicles certainly, coming across. So we\ncrossed \u2014 and I remember scuttlebutt among the troops was that we\u2019re going into a\nvery dangerous battle. How we knew, or how they knew, I do \u2014 I don\u2019t know, but a\nvery dangerous battle. We have to cross a river up there, and we think the odds of\ngetting across are not very great.

        "A: Didna \u2014 didn\u2019t \u2014 had no idea what it was, and what it was going to be called. All\nwe knew, that we were facing heavy, heavy artillery.",
        "A: I\u2014I was in \u2014 in Belgium, very southern tip of Belgium, near Bastogne, in \u2014\nnear \u2014 right outside of Marvie, m-a-r-v-i-e, Marvie, Belgium, southeastern corner,\njust above Germany, just north of Germany. And so, heavy, heavy shellfire poured\nin on us. We were bogged down. The unit that I had \u2014 the \u2014 the company \u2014",
        "A: Lots of forests. It was \u2014 it was called \u2014 th-the battle itself, I had fought through\ntwo other major battles across France, this was my third battle. It was called the\nArdennes campaign, because it was being fought in the Ardennes forest, heavily\ntreed. And that was southeastern Belgium, and northwe \u2014 northeastern Germany.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, oh of \u2014 oh, of \u2014 oh, of course. Of course northwestern Germany,\nof course.",
        "A: The surprise \u2014 and what \u2014 the \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I was \u2014 I learned to believe, let\u2019s\nsay, from what I read later on, that the Americans expected a major thrust, because\nthe Germans could be driven just back \u2014 back just so far. And they had tremendous,\nheavy artillery. Their tank corps were probably superior to the American. And so I\nth \u2014 I believe that our top command expected that, but nevertheless, the \u2014 the\nmagnitude of the attack was just overpowering. The company that I had trained\nwith, the 106\" infantry division, in the U.S., on that first day of battle, lost 75\npercent of its troops, killed, wounded or captured, or missing. Seventy-five percent\nin one day. The word was that that division that I trained with \u2014 and I left early, to\nbe shipped over as a replacement, they were not ready yet for combat. They were\ngreen. And you read the accounts of \u2014 of \u2014 of that unit, the 106\" infantry division,\nand you realize how poorly prepared they were. They were scattered, they ran in all\ndirections. Some of them shot their own men. They were just firing at anything they\nsaw. They were such in \u2014 in that kind of disarray. And I hate to think about that\nwith an American unit, particularly one that I trained with. But nevertheless, the\nGermans were well-equipped, well trained, well prepared, and they \u2014 they \u2014 andJuly 14, 2015\nthen they \u2014 they drove 1n-into us. The report that I read later on, when I was\nreported missing in action, was that the unit I was with had been subjected to heavy\nenemy fire. And in the process, troops were scattered, and got lost. And thus, I was\nreported missing in action, because I was \u2014 I was not present, not account \u2014\naccounted \u2014 I couldn\u2019t be accounted for.",
        "A: Ah, that\u2019s \u2014 see, they didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t have that \u2014 they didn\u2019t have that. All\nthey knew was that I was \u2014 I was missing. When you tally up your troops afterward,\nyou say, this guy\u2019s missing. They had no idea what happened to me. We had been\nfighting, the German attacked, and I was with the unit, I was on the line, I was\nfighting. We were face to face with the enemy, we were fi-fighting. And then I and\nothers were \u2014 were ordered back behind the lines, because this had been going on\nfor days, and I was weary. So yeah, they figured the troops need some rest, go back\nbehind the lines, get some rest, get some food, and then you\u2019ll resume later on. So\nwhen I got behind \u2014 behind the lines, I was now with all allied forces, the ger \u2014\nGermans were far removed, I heard somebody say, we need volunteers. We\u2019ve lost\nradio contact. The Germans have apparently knocked out our radio contact with\nfront line troops. So we have to establish where our \u2014 our lines are. We need vala \u2014\nvolunteers to do that. I was still 21, I think, so I was young, and adventurous. I\u2019dJuly 14, 2015\njust begun to learn what war was about. But I also felt that 1t was a mission.\nSomething moved me, and \u2014 and I said, yeah. So Pll vol \u2014 Pll volunteer. I saw a\nJeep in the di \u2014 in the distance, and I said, I'll get that Jeep. And I signaled to five\nothers, and they joined me. We said, we \u2014 we \u2014 we'll be a volunteer task force,\nwe'll go as far as we can go, and see if we can identify where our lines are. High\ncommand cannot pri \u2014 plan strategy, unless they know where the lines are. So,\nthat\u2019s what we started out to do. So, we\u2019re in this Jeep, it\u2019s now \u2014 the vision is not\nvery clear, it\u2019s an overcast sky. I remember driving the Jeep, the roads are covered\nwith 1\u2014 snow and ice. We round a curve, and just about \u2014 maybe about 10 to 15\nyards ahead of me, there\u2019s a German 88 millimeter cannon pointed right at the Jeep,\nright at us. And it\u2019s mounted on an 80 \u2014 on a\u2014 a\u2014 a German ta-tank. And so, you\nknow, anybody pulled that trigger, we were gone. And I can talk, and I do talk man\n\u2014many, many times, the number of times that you are exposed to killing, to being\nkilled, and that was \u2014 that was one of them, and there were many, many others. So\nit\u2019s, you know, miracles take place, and you don\u2019t get killed. But that was one that\nthey certainly \u2014 somebody should have pulled the trigger, and we would have been\ngone. They didn\u2019t. I jammed on the brakes, we skidded off the road. All of a\nsudden, fire from rifles \u2014 apparently mi \u2014 rifles and machine-guns, small arm fire, is\npouring in from our right. And we \u2014 none of us were hit immediately. I \u2014 I say, we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nhave to \u2014 we have to defend ourselves yet. Have to find something, we can\u2019t do it\nfrom the Jeep here. We see a shack across the road, and I say, we move toward that\nshack. We did. One of the men had the perception to real-realize, we go near the\nmachine-gun \u2014 some \u2014 somebody\u2019s firing a lot of \u2014 lot of ri-rifle fire at us, or\nmachine-gun fire. So he too \u2014 he detached the one from the Jeep, and brought that\nwith us. So we start racing for the shack. One of our men is hit and killed on the\nway over. We get to the shack, and the enemy fire is still pouring in. We have to set\nup the machine-gun, some way, to fire back. And so there\u2019s a big bay window in the\nshack. The man who took the machine-gun, I think it was him, he sets it up in the\nwindow, and he starts firing. Within maybe a minute or so, he\u2019s hit, and he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s\nkilled. When I talk to student groups, I \u2014 I say sometimes people \u2014 un-understand,\nyou do things under battlefield conditions, you do things you would not normally\ndo, because you do it on your instinct. Something tells you that you have to take \u2014\nyou have to do something right now. So, my instinct, without thinking about the\nconsequences, I was wide open, I would be killed just like the other man was, your\ninstinct 1s a \u2014 1s a\u2014 jump behind that gun. Which is what I did, and I started firing.\nAnd I fired the machine gun at everything I saw move. I hit some, probably killed a\nnumber of their men. And that went on \u2014 that had started early in the morning \u2014 that\nwent on until late in the afternoon, we\u2019re running out of fire. We didn\u2019t \u2014 we had no\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nidea what we were against, at the time. I learned later on that there were at least a\nhundred \u2014 somewhere between a hundred and 200 si \u2014 over there, dug in, in\nfoxholes. And we were \u2014 we started out with six of us, one was killed immediately,\nso there were five of us, fighting them, and for a good part of the day. That\nmachine-gun really kept us going. When we ran low on ammunition, we had to\ndevise some strategy, how do we get out of this? We had two wounded. There was\nanother window, so two a \u2014 two of them were hit. I \u2014 I looked, and I saw a trap door\nin the floor of this shack, meaning there must be a cellar beneath. So the strategy\nwas simply this; we had to make them believe that they killed us off, or that we \u2014\nwe \u2014 we took off toward our \u2014 our rank, toward our \u2014 our la \u2014 our American and our\nBritish lines. And so, I figure, we'll climb down into this cellar, and then when it\u2019s\ndark, under cover of darkness, we\u2019ll emerge. If we can take those two wounded, we\nwill certainly do that, we certainly wanted to do that. And we \u2014 so that was the \u2014\nthat was the idea. We would infiltrate through their lines at night, under cover of\ndarkness, we possibly could do that.",
        "A: Ah, well there were \u2014 we started out with six, five me \u2014 six, one was hit. So there\nwere five of us. So there \u2014 there were two wounded, and three able-bodied. So we \u2014\nthat wa \u2014 that was the strategy, then we would come out and make our way back\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nthrough the lines. Because we had no ammunition, we absolutely ran out of a-\nammunition. Of about \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t know, it was about a half hour or so \u2014 no way to\nmeasure time, but I figured somewhere around there, I push open that trap door,\nmaybe we could come out now, maybe it\u2019s dark now, and what I saw \u2014 and I always\ntell people when I \u2014 when I talk to them, there\u2019s some things in battle, 11 combat, or\ncaptivity, that you don\u2019t remember, that you block out, and some of them are\nblocked out of your mind. Either you don\u2019t ca \u2014 you don\u2019t remember them, or you\ndon\u2019t want to remember them. Some that you have a vague re \u2014 recollection of, and\nothers that remain visible to you, perhaps for the rest of your life, as this one does\ntoday. So as I stand before you now, I can tell you, I see that rim of black, automatic\nguns, all pointed down, right at my face. And behind each of those guns is a white-\ncloaked, camouflaged German soldier, holding that gun, trigger finger poised, ready\nto fire at any moment. [doorbell]",

        "A: The \u2014 the view is still \u2014 still vivid, right here til \u2014 to \u2014 to this day, what are we,\n70 years later, I can still see them there, stark as can be, in addition to all those \u2014\nthose guns, pointed right at me, the stark nature of the black against the white. And\nthey motioned, come up. And so we come up, and we take the wounded up with us.\nWhat \u2014 for whatever reason, they \u2014 this German sergeant takes me aside, the others\ntake the other Americans, and they\u2019re off. I never see them again, and the German\nsergeant is in charge of me now. And he\u2019s got a rifle barrel in my back, pushing me\naround. Usher him around the shack, to make sure there are no booby traps there,\nand then he pushes me, rifle in the back, across the road. This road, as I write about\nit, I call the moat. It was like a moat, it was \u2014 separated us, one from the other, and\nW-w-we were in our castle, that little shack, and the moat protecting us from the\nenemy. But we crossed the road, and just then \u2014 we get onto the other side, and just\nthen, art \u2014 heavy artillery comes in. I never knew, and don\u2019t know to \u2014 to \u2014 today,\nwhether it was British or American, but it\u2019s coming in. We had called for it early in\nthe day, and now it just starts coming in. It\u2019s dusk, it\u2019s \u2014 nightfall is coming on, and\nthese shells are landing. The German sergeant jumps into his bunker, his foxhole,\nand I motioned to come down. Nein, nein, he said, nein, nein, nein, nein, nein,\nnein. No, he would not let me come down. I need some shelter. I\u2019m now being\nexposed \u2014 remember, it\u2019s the Ardennes forest, trees all around, and that\u2019s one ofJuly 14, 2015\nthe worst things you can have, because you get shell blasts when those things hit,\nand that \u2014 that pieces of hot metal come pouring down at you. All you need is a\npiece in the wrong place, and your \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you\u2019re dead.",
        "A: And that\u2019s the nature of things. I \u2014 I \u2014 I keep thinking of it so often \u2014 people\nremind me sometimes 1n talking, you had so many opportunities to die. That was\nanother one. I mean, the fact that you weren\u2019t hit, with all these shells coming in,\nwas amazing. Anyway, so the German is in his bunker, and the shellfire 1s coming\nin. I say to him, what are you going to do with me? I figure he doesn\u2019t \u2014 he speaks\nGerman. And he looks up at me, and he says, I have to kill you. In English. So here\nit is, the good fortune, you get a German who s \u2014 soldier who speaks English. So\nnow, you can converse. I have to kill you. The assumption is that he will. He\u2019s\ngoing to turn his rifle on me, and he will shoot.",
        "A: Chances are yes, because the order had been issued, high command. This is late\nin the war now, and they\u2019re not to take any more allied prisoners alive. They just\ncan\u2019t cope with them. They have to deal with the enemy. So they just shoot them.July 14, 2015\nWe\u2019re not going to house them, and feed them. So, not to be taken alive. My\nassumption was, he was going to pull his gun, and fire.",
        "A: I think was pure chance.",
        "A: Just the way we were set up, the others were sort of together, and somebody just\nmoved them away, and I was left with him. I think just chance.",
        "A: I have no idea. I just don\u2019t know what happened to them. They might have been,\nbecause again, the order had been issued. They weren\u2019t \u2014 they just weren\u2019t taking\nany prisoners alive any more. They couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t afford to do that. So, that\nwas it, and when he said, I \u2014 I have to kill you, I assumed he would turn his rifle on\nme, and I looked down the road. Now, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s night, it\u2019s dark. There\u2019s a burning\ntank in a field nearby. And the ro \u2014 and that road we crossed over is lit up. Also at\nthe side of the road, at their side, I see these bunkers, one after another. And I see\ntwo silhouettes on each bunker, one is a German helmet, and the other is a machine-\ngun. So I know, that as far as I could see, the \u2014 there were bunkers. I had been aJuly 14, 2015\nsprinter in school, and I just, very, very briefly thought, my gosh, all that running\nexperience, if ever there was a time to use it, this is it. And I was gonna sprint dow\n\u2014 try to get out into the road and sprint down that road. Then I suddenly realized,\nyou'd be shot out of the starting block. They had all these guns trained on you. I\nmean, there was no way you could es \u2014 you could escape. Behind me, if I tried to\nrun there, there were guards there. There were other foxholes, so I \u2014 it was just no\nplace to go. And so I\u2014I se \u2014 I realized I had \u2014 the only option I had was\nconversation. But I\u2019m talking to a German. And so, what he \u2014 and then I\nremembered, just a moment ago he said, I have to shoot you, this man speaks\nEnglish. Maybe we can converse, and you know. So he says \u2014 he looks up at me \u2014\nwe pau \u2014 we paused for a while. I\u2019ve given up the idea of running. He looks up and\nhe says, why are you Americans here? This is not your war. I said, how \u2014 I said, you\nmade it our war, how can you say that? Conversation goes on. The reason that I\nthink this sequence would be so good on film, as opposed to just in print, you know,\nyou have to see a relationship developing between this German soldier, and this\nAmerican soldier. I\u2019m his captive, he\u2019s supposed to shoot me, and he doesn\u2019t.",
        "A: The one thing I don\u2019t remember, because I kept seeing that helmet on the \u2014 he\ndidn\u2019t look up all the time, like that. Sometimes he was looking straight ahead, andJuly 14, 2015\nwe were talking. And I\u2014I comment on that in my book, that while lying in the\nhospital and thinking of some of these events that occurred, I try to remember his\nface, and I can\u2019t, because again, I saw so little of it. Maybe his chin under that\nhelmet, but not the whole face. And the conversation goes on. He reaches down into\nhis pocket, and I figure he\u2019s got a pistol there. He\u2019s a noncommissioned officer,\nhe\u2019s probably allowed to carry a pistol, he\u2019s going to shoot me with a pistol instead\nof the rifle. Instead, he pulls out a wallet. He opens the wallet, and then he turns it\ntowards me, he shows me pictures of his wife and two children. And he says, next\nyear, we will be in New York City. That was his plan. He foresaw it. He was a\ngood Nazi, he believed that they were going to win the war, and he would \u2014 they\u2019d\ngo on vacation, and they\u2019d take, of all places in the world, New York City. To\nthem, it\u2019s like Paris is to us. And so, the conversation wears on, and we\u2019re talking.\nAnd I\u2014I ke \u2014I\u2014I feel a change in attitude. This guy is not the \u2014 he\u2019s not the\nenemy an-any more. And I don\u2019t think he sees me as the enemy either. And we\u2019re\ntalking. His English is more than good enough. I mean, I understand everything he\nis saying. And so, we converse. After a while \u2014 and as I say, attitude 1s changing,\nwe're \u2014 we\u2019re not antagonists. The way we were \u2014",
        "A: By this time, I think they had ceased. Yes, they had.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015",
        "A: I\u2019m standing above him, looking down.",
        "A: I\u2019m standing. Oh yeah, I\u2019ve \u2014 I was completely vulnerable while the shells were\n\u2014 were landing. Oh, I \u2014 I was standing all the time. I didn\u2019t get an invitation to sit at\nthe edge of the foxhole and dangle my feet into it, nut \u2014 nut \u2014 you know, there was\nno \u2014 no invitation. I just \u2014 I stood all the time. But again, there\u2019s something\nchanging in our relationship. And finally, he looks \u2014 he looks up at me, he says, for\nyou, the war is over. And I assume he\u2019s going to turn his rifle on me, kill me. His\nnext statement is, I\u2019m going to send you to a prisoner of war camp. He knew, and he\nknew that I knew, in the POW camp, you don\u2019t have to fight any more, you get\nshelter, food, good treatment. They did \u2014 I\u2019m quite certain \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2014-I-\u2014I-\u2014I-\u2014I know\nthis, that they \u2014 they did follow the Geneva con \u2014 the rules of the Geneva\nconvention, and if I did go back to a prisoner of war camp, that I would not have to\nfight any more. And that was his way of ex \u2014 of recognizing gallantry. And he said\n\u2014 he went on to say \u2014 he says, we had many more men than you, but you fought\nwell. And as I said, how \u2014 I didn\u2019t think right at the moment, but later on when I \u2014\nwhen I thought back about that, what gallantry. You know, here\u2019s a German soldier,\nmy archenemy, and he\u2019s going to save my life, because he understood and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 14, 2015\nappreciated the way we fought against these extreme odds. And he said, you killed\nmany of our men, but you fought well. And so he \u2014 he, in earnest, was about to save\nmy life. He orders over two guards to take me away. As they do, there\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re\nstopped along the way, and I can look \u2014 I can see by the things on the man\u2019s\nshoulder, or wherever they were, that he\u2019s an officer. And there\u2019s a German\nconversation that goes on. I don\u2019t know what the conversation 1s, but I soon\nrecognize what it was. No, I\u2019m not going to a prisoner of war camp, they don\u2019t take\nprisoners any more, I\u2019m going to become a slave laborer. Because one of the things\nthat they needed \u2014 and there were ma-many, a-as you well know, non-military men\nwho are forced into slave labor. And slave labor in many of the camps, existed.\nAnyway, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be.",
        "A: What followed. I didn\u2019t understand what they were saying, but when I realized\nafterward, that no longer did I have those guards, somebody else took me, and\npushed me \u2014 al-always I \u2014 did I \u2014 rifle barrel was in the back, kept pushing me with\nthe rifle barrel, until suddenly, I\u2019m confronted with a bunch of soldiers; I don\u2019t\nrecognize the uniforms. As one of my friends, who\u2019s a historian told me, he a \u2014 he a\n\u2014 told me those were quite likely Russian troops, that had \u2014 then he describes how\nRussian troops would be in that area. And chances are they were, because they wereJuly 14, 2015\ncompletely foreign uniforms. They were not German, they were not British, they\nwere not American. And so I see all these uniforms, and others from different \u2014\nobviously some other countries involved in there. And I\u2019m pushed by rifle butt, and\nI \u2014 I fall to the ground. I see all these people around. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s all\nabout, I have no idea yet. So we \u2014 we sit there, we\u2019re sitting on snow, and finally, a\nrifle butt to the back again, up, and then the rife \u2014 he sort of motions up, up, and\nwe\u2019re into a forced march. Before they did that, though, they stripped me of my\nwinter coat, and the gloves. This is Germany\u2019s coldest winter on record. The\ntemperature during that period, I was told later, was between zero and five degrees\nFahrenheit. The coldest on record. So now I\u2019m going to go without any gloves, no\nwinter garments, just a thin jacket. That\u2019s it as I go ahead, forced marched with\nthese others.",

I just knew that I was \u2014 I was thrust into something with a\nbunch of other men. I was nameless, numberless. I was just a body, working hands,\nand that\u2019s what I would be. And only later did I learn that I was there for slave\nlabor, and whether I lived or died, made no difference to them whatsoever.",

When they took off my\ngloves and coat, I assumed that they were going to \u2014 I was a prisoner, I was their\nprisoner, I was going to go to a barracks someplace, and I\u2019d have shelter. That\nwasn\u2019t on \u2014 on their minds, at all. So when darkness fell, they motioned, down,\ndown, and pushed some of us down on the ground. On the ground. We\u2019re on a road.\nOff to the side they push us, and say \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what they said, but it was\nobvious we were going to lie there, and that\u2019s where we were going to sleep. The\nroads were covered, most of the time, with snow, or ice. Sometimes they\u2019re just\ndark, dirty \u2014 you know, dirt, you know, but most of the time was snow or ice. And\nthey had guards patrolling. That\u2019s where you spent the night. For the next 80 some\nodd, out of 90 nights, that\u2019s where I slept, without a coat, with no gloves, hands \u2014\nhands tucked in here, to try to keep warm. Toes moving constantly. Toes and\nfingers cons \u2014 constant movement. Otherwise, they would have frozen. Which they\ndid later anyway, I had frostbite. But this 1s one of the remarkable things that\nhappened during that period. Desperate, you\u2019re freezing, almost freezing to death,\nreally, because much more of that, and I would have. The only thing that could\nsustain me, was mental or emotional. And what I thought of was food. And one\nthing you never really want to think about when you\u2019re starving \u2014 I think everybodyJuly 14, 2015\nwould s \u2014 would s \u2014 would re \u2014 remember that, you don\u2019t think about food. But that\nhelped to sustain me. It\u2019s not only physical pain, but emotional pain that I was\ngoing through. And so, if I could draw some kind of an emotion, that would give\nme some hope for the future, maybe that would help to see me through whatever\nthis is that I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m getting 1n-into.",
        "A: What did they feed \u2014 feed me?",
        "A: Crusts of dark brown bread. That was the standard. And that \u2014 most days \u2014 I\u2019m\nnot sure if we got that every day, but that was \u2014 that was the food. There were two\ncamps we passed through. Labor camps, not prisoner of war camps, but labor\ncamps. E-Even that would have been better than what we had. Cause I had the\nmaximum of exposure you could. But in the \u2014 in these camps, we \u2014 which we just\npassed through, only spent the day going through them, I remember in jeros \u2014 in\nPrum, p-r-u-m, Germany, a labor camp, we were given six, one inch in diameter\ncrackers, sort of dry cracker, and that was it for the day. We went on marching. We\ngot to Gerolstein in Germany, and there they gave us a can \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean a\ncanteen, the way the military has, but a ti \u2014 old \u2014 like an old, tin Campbell\u2019s soup\ncan. And old tin can, and in it was some hot water. There was a little piece of potatoJuly 14, 2015\nat the bottom, that was the flavoring. So that was called soup. And we drank that\nhot water, that was it for the day. I don\u2019t have to make any more clear than that how\nour \u2014 how our nutritional needs were not being met, and malnutrition set in rapidly,\nand you could feel it happening. But that essentially is \u2014 1s the \u2014 1s the amount of\nfood that we had.",
        "A: You know \u2014",
        "A: Consciously, you know, of course, that you\u2019re not being fed adequately. And just\nfrom logical standpoint, you begin to say that, you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 this can\u2019t go\non too long. So intellectually, you realize that something is going to be happening to\nyour body. Then you start to feel weakness. The marches are more difficult, they\u2019re\ngetting more and more difficult. You feel pain in your stomach, cause there\u2019s\nnothing to fill it, and that radiates through your body. So y-y-you \u2014 you know that\nthere\u2019re physical aspects taking shape now, and you know \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 I knew that\nbodies do deteriorate if you don\u2019t get \u2014 you know, I was brought up as a child, eat\nyour cereals, eat your vegetables, and so forth. You have to, to build your bodies.\nSo I knew I wasn\u2019t getting any of that, so my body had to deteriorate. After a whileJuly 14, 2015\n\u2014 that \u2014 that takes a lot of days, and maybe weeks before you really see it. And I\ncould feel my shoulders, they were very boney, and my arms were starting to lose\nsome of the flesh that they had. And so I began to realize that, yeah, there was some\nkind of deterioration going on here. But weakness probably was the greatest\nrecognition that I had, that something was happening to the body. Then, as we were\nbeing force marched, sometimes from location to location, when we worked on\nrailroads, people were dropping out along the way. And I realized that they were\ndropping out from weakness, from the malnutrition. Must be \u2014 must be a\u2014a\nchemical [indecipherable] condition, whatever it was. But they were \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they were dropping along the way. Dropping out was not a good thing, because\nyou were no longer useful as a slave laborer, and so either \u2014 in some cases \u2014 why\nthey made the decision, I don\u2019t know, but in some cases, they left the man there to\ndie. In other cases, they shot the man. Yeah.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: I saw them. One of the \u2014 be-before I leave the subject altogether, I just want to\ngo back to that period of sleeping at night, and the food. And I thought about food.July 14, 2015\nIt sustained me emotionally, to be able to go on. Why? Because I figure someday\nI\u2019m going to get out of this, I d\u2014 I don\u2019t know how, but someday I will \u2014 I will \u2014\nthis will be over, and tho \u2014 and the wonderful foods \u2014 when you\u2019re starving, you\nthink about food. And I said, I ca \u2014 those wonderful foods, the things that my\nmother used to make, things we got in the pizza parlor. You know, all \u2014 all the\nwonderful thing, someday I\u2019m going to have that again. And that emotionally\nhelped to carry \u2014 carry me. So rather than \u2014 rather than drop out and die on th \u2014 on \u2014\non li \u2014 lying there, I was able to sustain myself with the belief that someday I would\nhave access to those foods. Months later, when I was hospitalized, I asked a nurse to\nbring me a little book \u2014 booklet of some sort that I could write on, I recorded that. I\nhave that here.",

And so, I was probably in the best condition of my life, physi-physically.\nSo that\u2019s all. But wha-wha \u2014 what\u2019s \u2014 what\u2019s odd about that is that I went from the\nextremes in temperature in basic training, from a hundred \u2014",

We stopped along the way, to work on the railroads, but to work\non the railroads, we had to move railroad tracks, long, heavy railroad tracks, one\narea to another. If their sup \u2014 to keep their supply line going to their troops, they\nhad to maintain the railroads. And so, we had to get tracks, sometimes from one\nabandoned railroad, to another that was in service, and needed. Mostly at night, we\nwere forced marched again, we had to carry those railroad tracks on our shoulders.\nNow, this is when I knew they \u2014 they became boney, because ri \u2014 they hurt. We\nwould carry them sometime, from one town to another, many miles. And I would\nhave one on my shoulder, and somebody in front would have ano \u2014 have the other\nend of it on his shoulder. So we had to carry those railroad tracks, town to town.",

I don\u2019t remember seeing anybody shot,\nbecause we maintained the code of silence pretty well, I don\u2019t remember seeing.\nBut I have no doubt that if they \u2014 we were caught, we would have. What we did do\nthough, 1s to \u2014 when we could, when we saw there were no guards right around,\nwho could see it, we would exchange the sabotage work that we did on the\nrailroads. This was, again, youth, my youth, that I was yo \u2014 figures they\u2019re notJuly 14, 2015\ngoing to do this to me, I\u2019m not going to build anything that they can use. And the\nothers had similar attitudes. So, when we were required to build the railroads, these\n\u2014 these tracks, put them together, we didn\u2019t always line them up well. We didn\u2019t put\nthe pins in where they should. And that was with \u2014 with some pride, that we did\nthat. So, when we had the opportunity to exchange something, he \u2014 thi-this guy\nwould tell me what he did, and I would tell him, with delight, that I didn\u2019t put those\npins in there. And we \u2014 we felt we were \u2014 we were giving it back to the Germans.\nSo that \u2014 that continued, more and more star \u2014 started to decline in health.

        "A: Symbolic of the torture \u2014 the torturous mind, that I also had \u2014 had to live with \u2014\nphysical torture, yes, but the mental, sometimes was even worse. I contracted\nfrostbite, particularly in my right foot.",
        "A: And as we marched on and on, it became more and more painful. My foot was\nnow exceeding the size of the shoe. And I wanted to scre \u2014 yell out, the pain was\nthat great.

        "A: It says to me that \u2014 it reminds me of what I went through, reminds me of the\nstruggle that I had, and the struggle that I was able to survive, because this \u2014 the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the emotional stress that this gave me, was as bad as the physical. To make the\ndecision. I\u2019m being force-marched, I can\u2019t drop out. If I do, may be my death. So\nwhat do I do? The pain is so incredibly great.

And so I made the decision. That was the emotional tug, do you\ntake a chance of \u2014 of dropping out along the side and trying to get that shoe off? If\nthey see you, you\u2019re shot. Do you do that, or do you continue, and try to stick it out?\nTake the pain, as bad as it is? And then comes this break, that we\u2019re stopped, and I\ncan now take my shoe off. I take it off, I don\u2019t want them to see it, so I throw it over\na hedge, or some kind of a bush. The only winter garment I have is a scarf. I take\nthe scarf from around my neck, and I wrap it around the foot. So I have one shoe\nand one scarf, and that\u2019s the way I conduct myself the rest of the time that I was a\nprisoner.",
        "A: I walked on a scarf, on snow and ice. Periodically, we got some sunshine, and\nsome of the snow would melt, so that became wet. It didn\u2019t help the swelling in the\nfoot, but at least there was expansion that I didn\u2019t get from the shoe, so I could\nsurvive the pain. And so, that went on and on.",

From 10,000 feet in the air, you\ncan\u2019t distinguish the s \u2014 the soldiers marching, are they British, American, or\nGerman uniform? You can\u2019t tell from the air. And they would fire on us.",

Even worse \u2014 well, I shouldn\u2019t say even worse, but also,\nemotionally, what really hit me so much, and maybe the others, the physical aspect,\nof course, the danger of being sh-shot and killed was bad enough. But when I saw\nthose planes finish their run \u2014 and mind you, I knew something about the air force,\nbecause we all \u2014 I and those who were with me at the time, wanted to become\npilots. And I s \u2014 they swooped down, and they \u2014 they did their firing. When their\nrun was over, when they be \u2014 they proceeded ahead of the train, then I saw them\nmake the big U-turn, I knew they were heading back to their base in England.\nThere were officers in those planes, and I knew they were going to the officers\u2019\nclubs. And what were they going to do? They were going to get a nice, comfortable\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n106July 14, 2015\ncouch, warm room, cocktail, food, cigar. Nice, nice life. The frustration in realizing\nwhat they were going to, and we had \u2014 I had \u2014 had no future at that time. I didn\u2019t\nknow what was going to happen. I didn\u2019t know if I would be alive, dead, escaped,\nwhatever. Didn\u2019t know. So that was terribly frustrating, emotionally. It tore at me in\nsome respects, even more than the physical aspect of it. So now, we\u2019ve co \u2014 we\u2019re\ncontinuing, we\u2019re working on these railroads, or sabotaging them, and the tide of\nbattle does turn. We\u2019re now forced into these cattle cars. All it has, one big sliding\ndoor, no windows, no lights. And we\u2019re pushed in \u2014 they\u2019re called 40 and eights.\nEight horses can fit in, 40 humans. We were about 80.

Well, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014 it\u2019s just\nprobably the be \u2014 most apt description I can give, because just the way they I-lay,\none over another. That\u2019s the way we were stacked. And there was no room to sit.\nOnce a day, that door would slide open, and they would throw in some crusts of\nbread. By this time, we\u2019re all quite weak. It \u2014 we couldn\u2019t attack one another with\nenough strength to harm, or certainly to kill one another, but we had be \u2014 we did\nbecome a\u2014a-\u2014a pack of of animals.

Finally, on the end of the\nsix days, that big door 1s swung open. They pull us out, and now it\u2019s a forced\nmarch. I only have one shoe, and I can\u2019t endure another march, certainly on snow\nand ice. I have to make a decision. I always knew that one option was escape, if a\ntime or situation presented itself. And I said, this is it. We were being \u2014 we were put\nin \u2014 in lines for forced march. I looked and saw where the guards were positioned,\nhere, here, so forth. It occurred to me that if we came to a curve 1n the road, there\nwould be maybe five to 10 seconds where we would be \u2014 not be vi \u2014 we, where we\nwere situated, would not be visible to a guard. There were two others near me. I\ndon\u2019t recall that I had any particular connection with them at all, but they were the\nnearest to me. And so I told them what I had whispered the \u2014 watch, and they made\nsure the guards don\u2019t see, and I would call them, when I give a nod, like this. And\nwe got to that position, when the guards were separated that far, I gave a nod, and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n108July 14, 2015\nthe three of us threw a \u2014 threw a \u2014 there was a \u2014 a hedge, some \u2014 something \u2014 some\ngrowth of some sort, we threw ourselves over it, and just lay there. I think the\ntroops behind us, recognizing what we did, used discretion, and said, I should clo \u2014\nwe should close up. They closed ranks, I think. I\u2019m not sure of that. But the fact that\nwe were not detected, that there were no soldiers out searching for us, suggested to\nme that maybe that\u2019s what happened. And that saved us. So they marched on by,\nand they were gone. We had gone through a town while we were on the train, not\ntoo long ago. And we could see through the cracks, there was something there, it\nwas a some \u2014 something, it was not just the treed areas that we had been through, so\nit was probably a village of some sort.",

I was on\ntwos and fours, the foot, I couldn\u2019t move fast enough on foot, so sometimes on\nfours, and sometimes on all fo \u2014 all fo \u2014 four \u2014 fours, my \u2014 just my feet. We crawl\ninto this town, and as we \u2014 we\u2019re coming down a hill. I have a picture of it, on back\nbehind the screen, I have a picture of that town. I never went back. I kick myself\nmany \u2014 many, many times for not having gone back, and you\u2019ll hear in a moment\nwhy I wanted to go back there. But somehow, the story of what I went through, got\nout someplace, and in the mail I got two photos of this town, of wise \u2014 ri \u2014\nReichenbach.",
        "A: Right, r-e-i-c-h-e-n-b-a-c-h, Reichenbach. I get photos, tourist photos of these\ntowns, from \u2014 I don\u2019t know where they came from, somebody, somebody sent them\nto me. And I look at it and try to envision where it was we were \u2014 I remember we\ncrawled down a hill. We get to the bottom of it, and I hear familiar sounds. The kind\nof sounds I heard on the battlefield, tanks, vehicles, moving. We get closer and then\nI see German tanks. I see soldiers all around. We had escaped into a Nazi staging\narea.\n110\nJuly 14, 2015",
        "A: If s\u20141if sighted, we would be shot.",
        "A: That was the order, no prisoners to be taken alive. And so we had to crawl\nthrough back alleys. We \u2014 we did that. We\u2019re now at the edge of an alley, there\u2019s a\nbig open area, and in the distance, there\u2019s some houses. Simple houses. One house\njust catched my attention, it\u2019s painted white. And I say to these other two, that\u2019s a\nsafe house. They look at me. How do you know it\u2019s a safe house? I don\u2019t know how\nI know, but I know. So they s \u2014 no other choice, all right, we\u2019ll go along. We wait\nuntil we see no \u2014 no soldiers nearby, and we crawl as fast as we c \u2014 we \u2014 they ran, I\ncrawled as fast as I could, out to the door of that house. We needed some kind of\nshelter, it\u2019s still cold. Needed some food. Knock on the door, and a young man,\nprobably in his early teens, comes to the door. He takes one look at me, you know,\nP?\u2019m-\u2014IT\u2019m-\u2014I\u2019m filthy, beard, hair is shaved, I \u2014 I contracted lice. And one other\nelement that we had to fight, lice had covered \u2014 covered my body, and many of the\nmen had that.",
        "A: Even in those temperatures, lice on our bodies. But so my head was shaved. So I\nhad bristles, I just \u2014 just \u2014 dirty face, and just torn, the clothes were torn. And he\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n111July 14, 2015\ndoesn\u2019t know what to do. Looks at us. And I try to explain who we are, I don\u2019t think\nhe knew. He starts to close the door. I have one good foot and shoe, I stick the left\nfoot in the door. And then I hear voices from the rear. They sound like elderly\npeople. And he motioned for them to come to the door. They do, and it is this\nelderly couple. I notice the man takes a look on the jacket, I have a U.S. emblem,\nand he looks at it, and there\u2019s a\u2014 a smile on his face. I say, what \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014\nwhat\u2019s he smiling about? We\u2019re desperate here, and he\u2019s smiling at us. He comes\nwalking out to the porch, to look up and down, to see if there are any soldiers. He\nthen takes us \u2014 he then motions \u2014 he sees no soldiers \u2014 if they\u2019re captured \u2014 1-1f \u2014 if\n\u20141if\u20141f the g \u20141f the German soldiers come by, and we were in their house with\nthem, not only would we be shot, they would be shot as traitors. In all likelihood,\nthat\u2019s what would happen. So he has to look out and see if there are any soldiers.\nNone there. Motions for us to come in, and his wife joins us. She sees our condition,\nand almost without saying anything, she goes, I guess, to the kitchen, and she comes\nout with three ladles of so \u2014 ladles and some \u2014 some kind of cups of some sort, of\nhot soup, with a piece of meat in it. Perception on her part, she sees the condition,\nand she recognizes, more than anything. To us, just seeing a living quarters, it was\nso startling. I re \u2014 I remember just \u2014 just standing there, even before taking the food,\nand just looking. There were curtains, drapes, carpeting, furniture, lamps. We\n112July 14, 2015\nhadn\u2019t seen that in a long time, we were living just in the outdoors alone. So that\nwas striking. But then, the food was so delect \u2014 just absolutely delectable. I \u2014\nnormally when you\u2019re hungry, you \u2014 you gulp it down. But I \u2014 I savored it, just the\ntaste of food, was so great. After they fed us, we talked for a little bit. Amazingly,\nthey spoke reasonable English. Why did they want to save us? Some years earlier,\nthis couple had traveled to America. They spent time in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nTheir experience with Americans, and America, was so good, when he saw that\nemblem, that\u2019s what made him smile. And that\u2019s what probably \u2014 probably got\nthem to take the risk of bringing us into their home, and take \u2014 and take \u2014 you\nknow, and feeding us. After that experience, they then knew that they couldn\u2019t keep\nus there. They got a piece of paper, and they drew a map, showing us alleyways to\ngo through. We could hear shellfire, not \u2014 not small arms fire yet, but we knew we\nwere fairly close to allied lines. And they knew too, that the allies were near. So, if\nthey could get us to a safe place, they thought that in a few days, the way the allies\nwere moving, from reports they had, I guess, heard, or whatever, we would be\nrescued.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: They were two \u2014 there were \u2014 there were three americ \u2014 three American boys,\nyeah.",
        "A: So, they drew a map, and we followed that map, crawled through back alleys, to\n\u2014to a barn. We craw \u2014 got into that barn, we pulled ourselves up into a hayloft. I\ndon\u2019t remember how long we were there, two days, three days, just don\u2019t\nremember, no sense of time. But I do remember \u2014 I think it was a \u2014 the first\nmorning, I heard some scurrying down below. I separated the hay and looked\nthrough a crack. I saw a scene that is as clear today as that \u2014 as that scene I\nmentioned earlier, of the Germans standing over us with the guns. That is so clear. I\nsee a stool, I see a cow, and I see sitting on that stool, 1t must have been a German\nsoldier. Now, he had his top of his uniform off, and I could see that long, white\nunderwear, extending out of his black pants. Underwear, and black suspenders\nstretched over the underwear, and then the big, black boots he was wearing. And\nhe\u2019s milking a cow. I stirred a little bit, and some hay falls through the crack. This 1s\n\u2014 this is like a mo \u2014 a movie, you know, because \u2014 an-and I have to w \u2014 I watch, I\u2019m\nalmo \u2014 almost breathless, waiting to see where that \u2014 if it lands in front of him, that\nhay, he \u2014 he \u2014 he 1s likely \u2014 all likelihood, he is going to know there\u2019s something up\nthere, and whatever the consequences might be. Might he shoot, might he summon\n114\nJuly 14, 2015\ntroops? Whatever it would be, it probably would not be good for us. Because again,\nno prisoners taken alive. We were obviously Americans. But it [indecipherable]\nbehind him. So, it\u2019s of no real consequence, but I have that image of him. Must\nhave been a day or so later, we\u2019re lying in that hay, and again, aware that we\u2019re not\nfar from the allied troops, I\u2019m looking down an alleyway, through \u2014 must have\nbeen, you know, maybe it\u2019s a knothole, but I s \u2014 I can see down there to \u2014 down\nthere. At the end of that alleyway, something goes by \u2014 someone goes by, and he\u2019s\nwearing a helmet. Could be a German soldier, but then again, that helmet looks\nfamiliar. It looks like our helmet. I\u2019m not sure, and I wait, and I tell them. They \u2014\nthey \u2014 they don\u2019t know whether to believe me, I said, I think the American are here.\nYou \u2014 you\u2019re delirious. You\u2019re delirious, then \u2014 they couldn\u2019t be, we\u2019re not that\nclose yet. A few minutes later, a vehicle rolls by, and I see \u2014 [phone ringing]\n[break]",
        "A: I see \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not sure yet. I see that helmet, it looks familiar, it looks like my\nhelmet.\n115July 14, 2015",
        "A: I think it might well be. And they think I\u2019m delusional, because they couldn\u2019t be\nthat close yet. A few minutes later, I see a vehicle go by, and it looks like a Jeep.\nNot only is it a Jeep, I see that white star on the hood. That\u2019s an American Jeep.\nYes, they are here. This time, they believe me. I say \u2014 we roll out of that hayloft, we\nliterally roll, we\u2019re so weak at this time, and I\u2019m almost deli \u2014 delirious. We\u2019re so \u2014\nyou know, we \u2014 the condition we were in. And I remember just rolling down that\nalleyway, and there, American soldiers, Third Armored Infantry division.",
        "A: I don\u2019t even hear it. Fortunately, I don\u2019t. But the Third Armored Infantry\ndivision, again, Patton\u2019s Third Army, the \u2014 we were the first Americans they had\ncome across. They couldn\u2019t treat us with enough kindness. They tried to feed us.\nThe first thing they thought of \u2014 they were obviously not nutritionists, was\nchocolate. Bad, very bad. And then, any food they could get into us, they did. I \u2014 I -\nas I say, I was in very bad shape by then, I was mildly delirious. I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I\ncouldn\u2019t carry on a conversation with them. As I think I mentioned, we were the\nfirst Americans that they came across, so they treated us as well as they could.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n116July 14, 2015",
        "A: The sweetness of it, it just \u2014 we reacted, the stomach somehow, whatever the\nsystem is, that does whatever it does with your food after you\u2019ve eaten it, 1t just\ndidn\u2019t take to chocolate very well. It \u2014 I think the fact that 1t was rich, instead of just\nplain, ordinary taste, probably a leafy vegetable would have been easier to take. But\nthat made \u2014 the other two, I think, were sick, I was just delirious \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 so I don\u2019t remember what happened. But, the troops almost cradled us in their\narms, because again, you know, we were almost out of \u2014 out of it.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t talk, I\u2014 I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to tell them\nanything, I was just, again, semi-delirious, and just hung there. They saw the \u2014 the\nright foot, with the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 rag wrapped around it, and they knew there was something wrong there. They\nrushed me to a field hospital. It was a hospital very similar to, those who have seen\nthe TV show and the movie, \u201cM*A*S*H.\u201d Field set-up, doctors work \u2014 working\n117July 14, 2015\nunder very, very difficult conditions, but providing great, great service to men\nwounded on the battlefield. So, I don\u2019t remember where the operation took place,\nwhether it was in the field hospital \u2014 because my mind went blank. I did learn\nafterward, that from that field hospital, I was sent to the first general hospital in\nLiege, Belgium. And from there, transferred to the first general hospital in Paris,\nFrance. I don\u2019t remember any of that, at all, because as I say, I was delirious by\nthat time. I don\u2019t remember where the surgery was done on my foot, whether it was\nin Liege, Belgium, or in the field hospital. But they did, they had to cut away. The\nfoot \u2014 bottom of the foot was all black, and it would have continued on up my leg,\nand I probably would have lost part of the leg. So the timing was just right, and they\n\u2014 they caught it, but then I spent as \u2014 I\u2019d say, a month \u2014 a month to a month and a\nhalf, in the hospitals in \u2014 in Europe.",
        "A: Yeah, the flesh of the foot, oh, 1t was \u2014 it was bandaged for a long while, and the\nflesh had to grow back.",

        "A: Gangrene, it would have set in.",
        "A: I had both frostbite and trench foot, and the combination 1s wicked, because\ntrench foot, you know, that\u2019s wet, and then frostbite freezes it, so an awf-awful\ncombination to go through. But, in this ho \u2014 in the hospital, in \u2014 in Paris \u2014 as I say,\nI was there for about a month, they couldn\u2019t get my fever down. In one of the ex \u2014\none of the times when we were in these forced marches, when I was a slave laborer,\ntwice during that time, at night, instead of sleeping \u2014 when I say 80 out of 90 nights,\nsix of them were in the \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 and the other two, I don\u2019t remember other two. I came, maybe it was 82 out of\n90. But two nights we did sleep in \u2014 in barns. And in one of the barns was a cow,\n119July 14, 2015\nwa \u2014 one man who came to be my friend, my buddy, long after the war \u2014 we\ncorrespond every Christmas, we send greeting cards to each other, and Myron\nwould send me \u2014 Myron Berringer(ph), a farmer from Rushville, Indiana. On that\ncard he would always say the same thing, year after year after year, things sure\naren\u2019t like they used to be. And all of that. Myron called me over, lie down\n[indecipherable] under the cow, under the udder of the cow. He milked directly\ninto my mouth \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 from that cow. So, along with 20 other diseases I contracted \u2014 out of that little\nbrown book that I mentioned before, where it has the 84 foods?",
        "A: I have about 20 diseases, illnesses, fevers that I contracted during the 10 months\nof hospitalization. One of them was undulant fever. Now we didn\u2019t \u2014 in the hospital\nin France, in Paris, they didn\u2019t know what it was, but I had a raging fever. It was\ncaused by that incident with the cow, it was undulant fever. No doctor, no military\ndoctor was able to discover what it was. That kept me from going \u2014 getting back to\nAmerica, because they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they were going to fly me, which they did, I \u2014 I\nflew in a hospital plane. They wouldn\u2019t do that until they got the fever down, and\nthey couldn\u2019t get it down. Finally, they did force it down enough to get me on a\n120\nJuly 14, 2015\nplane and over to America. Years | \u2014 years later, I\u2014 I \u2014 I finished college, I\u2019m\nworking now, and I broke out in a sweat. Like the body just opened, water just\npoured out, and these little red dots all over. The doctor called it petechiae, and this\nwas a result of that incident. How was it discovered? The doctor that I \u2014 I had that\nnight, was substituting for another doctor. He was young, he was an intern, and he\nimmediately saw \u2014 thought that I had a contagious disease. And I was \u2014 and he\nordered an ambulance, they took me immediately, that night, from home, to 1 \u2014\nBelleville, New Jersey, to a \u2014 a hospital where children with polio were. It was an\nisolation hospital. And I was put on the isolation floor, with these children. I was\nthere a full month. My wife Shirley could only see me during that month, through\nglass. I was isolated because he thought that I had this contagious disease.",
        "A: No. No. Fortunately, the doctor in that isolation hospital was very thorough, and\nvery smart. He said, you have this raging fever, and you\u2019re going to continue to get\nthese attacks. We have to find out what you have. We \u2014 so he says, I\u2019m going to ask\nyou a lot of questions. And he was so thorough. He took me through the whole\ncampaign.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n121July 14, 2015",
        "A: It turned out that he traced it back to that incident in the barn. He said, I believe\nthat you have something that\u2019s called \u2014 well, whatever feve \u2014 Ill think \u2014 PII think\nof it in a\u20141in a few moments. But you have that disease. Now, it\u2019s a\nMediterranean disease. But, I said, I wasn\u2019t in the Mediterranean. He said, but it\nalso \u2014 this was a very intelligent doctor \u2014 it also can be contracted from\nunpasteurized milk. And that is the disease you have, and we can treat that with\ncertain such medication. He did, and he cured me of it.",

And months go by, these three months go by, and there\u2019s no word. I\nlearned later on that my mother had a nervous breakdown, because the assumption\nwas, if he\u2019s missing in action, after two month \u2014 two months [indecipherable] and\nthere\u2019s no word, he must be dead. So that was the \u2014 the a-assumption. There\u2019s a\nman in charge of communications, another soldier, an American soldier in charge of\ncommunications for another unit, perhaps another \u2014 probably another di \u2014 I think\nanother division, and a company within that division, he\u2019s the communications\nperson.

There was an American soldier who could not get up.\nHe was just that weak, that sick and this German soldier takes out a gun, shoots\nhim. I learned later that this German soldier\u2019s name is Eisenhauer, spelled h-a-u-e-\nr, instead of o-w-e-r. Somebody \u2014 I don\u2019t remember how I learned it, somebody\ntold me, because he was a notoriously bad actor, and so be \u2014 I\u2014 so I gave testimony\nabout that incident. I don\u2019t think I talked about my conditions. I don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t recall\nthat I talked with anybody na \u2014 na \u2014 officially. I just don\u2019t recall. Though, while I\nwas in the hospital, I remember being awarded the \u2014 the Purple Heart, and then a\nsecond award, with oak \u2014 the Oak Leaf clover, and then raised in rank from PFC to\n127\nJuly 14, 2015\ncorporal. So, the \u2014 you know, there was procedures, and officers came by, and \u2014 to\ndo the things while I\u2019m \u2014 while I\u2019m lying in bed, and all that. But I just don\u2019t recall\nanybody questioning me \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 about the experience. I don\u2019t remember at all. And that\u2019s why I ne \u2014 I never\ntalked about it, for all those years, it\u2019s 53 years \u2014",
        "A: Actually, I \u2014 I\u2014 I deviate from what I \u2014 what I\u2019ve said to you, that I never talk\nwith it \u2014 talked about it. When I got back to college \u2014 I\u2019m trying to remember the\nname of the unit, but they were a bu \u2014 a bunch of old men. And they \u2014 they met in,\nyou know, there \u2014 there \u2014 there are groups that meet. And I think I told you that\nwhen I got back to college, I had been interviewed on \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 network radio, and all of that. And \u2014 and so there was \u2014 there were people\nthere on the campus, who knew the experience that I went through, and something\nmust have gotten out to this senior men\u2019s group, and all that, so they asked me to\ncome to speak. The problem was, first of all, I didn\u2019t know what I was talking\n128\nJuly 14, 2015\nabout, you know? I hadn\u2019t really \u2014 really, really pulled together my \u2014 my \u2014 my\nexperience over there. But, I did \u2014 did talk to them and tell them. The problem was\nthat most of them couldn\u2019t hear what I was talking about. Some of them had \u2014 you\never \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in those times, there were still some who used ear trumpets.",
        "A: And \u2014 and what\u2019d I say? And they couldn\u2019t quite get it. And I guess that was\nwhen I decided that nobody\u2019s really interested, and I \u2014 I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\nWhy I to \u2014 and I just gave a few \u2014 a few highlights, that I was a soldier, and I fought\non y \u2014 but I\u2014I didn\u2019t go into any of the details at all, about it. Was just a\u2014a\nsoldier\u2019s s-story. But that was the only thing, and from that point on, that was when\nI decided, it\u2019s not pleasant, I don\u2019t want to talk about it, and I f\u2014 1 \u2014I stopped, for\n53 years after that, I didn\u2019t \u2014 but wa \u2014 over here, when did I decide that I should be\ntalking about it? In this room, my \u2014 I had two grandsons have, at that time they\nwere seven and nine years old. And one of them said \u2014 we\u2019re sitting here, and one\nsays, Poppy, were you in the war? And then, between the two of them, they fle \u2014\nthrowing questions at me. What di\u2014 where did you sleep, what did you eat? Did\nyou have a gun? Did you ever fire 1t? Did you ever kill anybody? And just\nsomething is triggering in my mind, as I say, my guess, if these kids are asking,\nmaybe I should be talking about it. In 1988, Shirley and I, we had set up a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n129July 14, 2015\nfoundation at Ohio University, to bri \u2014 well, it was b \u2014 bl \u2014 bla \u2014 based on religious\nlines, to bring religious elements on campus, so there should be no anti-Semitism\nand so on. It was a very \u2014 a very good thing We f \u2014 and so we founded this \u2014 this\norganization. One \u2014 in ni \u2014 1n 19 ay \u2014 in ninety \u2014 we did it before that \u2014 in 1988, we\ninvited Elie Wiesel, Elie Wiesel, to come to campus for a weekend, to talk. He\nagreed to do it, because there was a woman, a young woman, a student, a graduate\nstudent, who had written, and \u2014 a \u2014 a\u2014I guess her \u2014 her papers for her degree, on\nElie Wiesel, on either hi \u2014 one of his books, or on his life. She died a short time\nafterward. It was \u2014 it was an unfortunate illness, from something she ate. He was\naware of that. I don\u2019t recall how he was made aware of it, but she was someone\nspecial to him, and he was made aware, perhaps by his rabbi, who had been a rabbi\nat Hillel [indecipherable] University. And when he and \u2014 when he \u2014 and he agreed\nto come, but only on the condition that we memorialize her name. And so he came\nto the campus. I don\u2019t have to tell you \u2014 oh, he insisted on certain things being done.\nOne, that he speak [phone ringing, break]",
        "A: So \u2014 w-w \u2014 So w-we \u2014 so he \u2014 he is the weekend guest, and of \u2014 and \u2014 and\nShirley and I are also the guests, of the president of Ohio University. We \u2014 the\npresident\u2019s guest house is turned over to us. Elie Wiesel has the master bedroom,\n130July 14, 2015\nhis rabbi has another bedroom, and there\u2019s a third bedroom for Shirley and me. Elie\nWiesel comes to me, he says, Bob, take the be \u2014 master bedroom. I said, I \u2014 I \u2014 oh, I\n\u2014I-\u2014Icouldn\u2019t possibly even fit \u2014 think of doing that. That\u2019s your room. He said\nno, no, no, listen to me, believe me, take the master bedroom. We do. Next morning\n\u2014and so we go \u2014 go to bed at night. The next morning, we come down for\nbreakfast. We had ordered \u2014 this 1s a little town, we\u2019d ordered from a \u2014 a \u2014 a larger\ncity in Ohio, kosher food. Comes the breakfast, he eats a few grapes, you know, he\ndoesn\u2019t eat much of \u2014 much at all. He eats a few grapes, and all this kosher food that\nwe brought in, from Columbus, Ohio, nothing. He eats nothing. But he said, I hope\nyou slept well. I said well, you gave us the room. I said, did you sleep well? He\nsaid, well, he said, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t stay in the \u2014 1n this building. Wh-Wha-What \u2014\nwha-what \u2014 where did you go? He said, there was a little motel down the road. He\nasked somebody to make arrangements for him to go to the motel. They didn\u2019t have\nany rooms vacant. He had a little hole someplace. There was room enough for his\ntypewriter and him, and I guess maybe a place to lie down. I said, you spent last\nnight there? Why? Why would you do that? He said, I didn\u2019t want to wake you up.\nWhat do you mean wake us? He said, I do my writing, a lot of my writing \u2014\n131July 14, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 at mid \u2014 in the mid \u2014 middle of the night, in the morning, 2:30, 3:30, any time\nlike that. He used a typewriter. He said, if I were writing at night, I would keep you\nawake. Imagine this man, I would keep you awake. So I went out of my way to go\ndown to this little motel, I spent the night there. I was pleased, and I could do some\nwriting. He slept very, very little. My guess is probably maybe three, four hours a\nnight, at most. Ate very little. And \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was a \u2014 but this aft \u2014 huh?",
        "A: Incredible, the per-per-personality of \u2014 of \u2014 of this man. So here we are, now it\u2019s\nSaturday afternoon. We\u2019re in the living room of the president\u2019s guest house. There\nare three people there, Shirley, me, and Elie Wiesel. And I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m really\nmesmerized by him. I am not \u2014 up to that time, I still had not, other than that thing\nwith the el-el-elderly group, I had still not talked, and I didn\u2019t want to talk. If there\nwas anybody I suppose I should have talked with about my experiences, I guess it\u2019s\nElie Wiesel. I think I was intimidated, or either that, or I didn\u2019t think it would be\nvery important to him, based on what he had gone through, and what he had done.\nAnd so, I never talked about it with him. But just being in the room with him, and\ntalking other things with him, was, you know, I mean, a \u2014 a \u2014 a thrill beyond\n132July 14, 2015\nanything I can imagine. When I was influenced by the two boys, I attribute it also,\nthe fact maybe that sm \u2014 meeting with Elie Wiesel suggested to me, just as he had\nbeen talking about his experiences, maybe I should be doing th \u2014 maybe I should be\ndoing the same thing.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think I ever talked with her about it, no. She only learned while we\nwere d \u2014 writing the book.",
        "A: Although that she did go to a lo \u2014 so \u2014 a lot of the presentations that I talked. So\nshe learned, she learned that way abou \u2014 about it. And occasionally, you know,\nwe'll be having dinner or something, and something would occur to me, and I\nwould make some reference to the war. But \u2014 so \u2014 so, I think, when the kids started\ntalking \u2014 and then I\u2019m thinking Elie Wiesel, and then I reali \u2014 I \u2014I realized, we\nhave a Holocaust council here in the \u2014 in our federation, and Holocaust education 1s\nmandated in New Jersey. Now, I\u2019m not a Holocaust survivor, but I survived maybe\nthe equivalent to sa \u2014 to most of the survivors, and maybe \u2014 maybe in some sense,\nmaybe even worse. Not those who went to the death camps, of course, nothing\ncompared with that. But at least, may \u2014 and maybe \u2014 maybe this is a story that\nshould be preserved. I didn\u2019t know it was unique at the time, and I really didn\u2019t\n133\nJuly 14, 2015\nknow until Heidi became my editor, and she did a lot of research, and the man in\ncharge of \u2014 of th \u2014 of press for the city of Newark, was also a World War II\nhistorian.",
        "A: I mentioned him. And so he di \u2014 he did a lot of research too, so he \u2014 he thought\nthere was something unique about it. But an-anyway, it was that combination. And\nthen somehow \u2014 and I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know how, the head of our Holocaust council\ngot word of my experience, and induced me to start talking to the school kids. So\nwhen I learned that that\u2019s what they were doing in New Jersey, so these young\npeople would grow up as being witnesses for the future, that seemed an imperative,\nand that\u2019s when I decided, time to start talking. And if you don\u2019t \u2014 may \u2014 make you\nfeel any happier, I don\u2019t hear that over here. You feel \u2014 remember, you feel it. Oh,\ndear. So that was the \u2014 that was what urged me.",
        "A: Oh yeah, that was 53 years later, that I started talking.",
        "A: I\u2019ve been doing it for about 10 years, right \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 right. And \u2014\n134July 14, 2015",
        "A: Was a totally different individual. I went \u2014 I went in as a\u2014a\u2014as a kid, very\nunsophisticated. And I knew something, because I did read newspapers, did know\nabout the war, and about concentration camps, and things of that nature, and a little\nbit of politics. But \u2014 but I was really very, very unsophisticated, and had no\nparticular design on life, I didn\u2019t know wha-what I wanted to be. So, very unsettled,\nI was still a student, and that was \u2014 that was all. My Jewish life was pretty much set\nby my mother, so I knew I had to go to synagogue, even though it was done in\nextreme form, like a Orthodoxy, and all that. But my shi \u2014 but my mother insisted,\nand I was brought up, you know, as a \u2014 as a good Jew. But when I \u2014 af-after going\nthrough what I did, I don\u2019t know what the maturation design was, but when I lie in\n\u20141n the hospital bed for those 10 months, I had many sleepless nights. Now, a lot of\nthem were because of physical conditions, and the pain was such that it was hard to\nsleep. But the others were just emotional, I \u2014 just thinking, thinking, thinking,\nconstantly. Some of that thinking would go back to incidents that took place during\nthe war. I constantly had an image of this elderly couple. I had an image of the\nhelmet of that sergeant, and I kept reaching for \u2014 trying to \u2014 trying to get his face.\nAnd I couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t get away from \u2014 from remembering that, and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n135July 14, 2015\nwhat \u2014 what \u2014 what I went through with him, and how \u2014 and the great good fortune\nthat I had, that it happened to be somebody like that, who was a humanitarian, as \u2014\nas \u2014 a-a-as well as a\u2014 a good soldier, I guess, and you know. He recognized valor,\na-and so, I \u2014 I had thoughts about them, and some of the instances, sometimes I\nwould get an image of that tank, like an ogre, a big monster, with that cannon. But\nmore \u2014 more often though, my thinking was about the future \u2014 wha \u2014 wa \u2014 what ha\n\u2014 how \u2014 how \u2014 how \u2014 wha-what-what 1 \u2014 what is ordained, what am I supposed to\ndo? I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s going to be a total change. Sure, I\u2019m gonna go back to\nschool, then I have to go to work, and all of that. But my life, somehow, it just feels\nvery, very different. I\u2019m not the person I was before. I\u2019m much more mature, for\none thing. I was a kid when I went in, now I\u2019m reasonably mature, and I start to\nthink. I was very, very lucky, as \u2014 as when I \u2014 when I talk to senior audiences, very\noften men will come up and surround me, and say, your life was a miracle. You \u2014\nyou should have been killed many, many times, but you\u2019re still here. So that \u2014 that\nthought ran through my head, and there was something urging me inside. I\u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow what it \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it was, but I\u2014 I knew I had to respond in some\nway, to what I had been through. And that some way happened to turn out to\ndevoting the rest of my life to Jewish causes, Jewish interests. When I was 83, I had\nmy second Bar Mitzvah, which is in the book, incidentally, my second Bar Mitzvah,\n136\nJuly 14, 2015\nhow that \u2014 how that came about. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s quite rare. Very, very few Jewish men\nhave a second Bar Mitzvah.",
        "A: The purpose of it is, back in \u2014 in David\u2019s time, bibli \u2014 [phone ringing, break]",
        "A: According to the psalms \u2014",
        "A: In King David\u2019s time, longevity was considered to be 70 years. If a man lived\nbeyond 70, he started life all over again. And so, 70, and recognizing that the age of\nBar Mitzvah for boys 1s usually 13, so you figure, if 70, life begins again, 13 years\nadded to that, 83. So at age 83, a Jewish man becomes eligible for a second Bar\nMitzvah.",
        "A: Oh, it\u2019s a world of difference. It\u2019s a to-totally different world. It\u2019s always been\nmy belief that 13 may be a little bit too young for a boy to understand the ritual that\nhe was going through, and the me \u2014 what it meant to become \u2014 because you\nassumed new responsibility in life, a more mature responsibility, and you\u2019re\nresponsible for your actions, and your future. And you \u2014 I \u2014I find that hard, at 13,\n137\nJuly 14, 2015\nto be able to think that way. So 83, not only you have \u2014 you\u2019re well beyond that\npoint \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you\u2019ve been thinking \u2014 thinking of your \u2014 your life, and planning for many,\nmany years. But your whole perspective on life is different, because you\u2019ve had a\nlife experience. In my case, I had an unusual life experience, the military life, and I\nhad a ga \u2014 an interesting Jewish experience, too, because my family, my mother\nwas rigid about it. We were not Orthodox, but we were Reform, but nevertheless, it\noccupied a big, big part of her life, and became part of my life.",
        "A: So a ritual was important. Pardon?",
        "A: Exactly. I had \u2014 had a strong Jewish 1-1-ident \u2014 identity. So that I knew that I\nwanted the thing \u2014 to do things spiritually, but more in terms of aiding pe \u2014 aiding\npeople. If I survived what I did, there are other people who had difficult times, and I\nought to be able to do so \u2014 do things that would be helpful to those people. The bar\n\u2014 Bar Mitzvah was more symbolic than anything. It allowed me to restate my \u2014 my\n\u2014my Jewishness.",
        "A: And, as I say, 1t had meaning, it would \u2014 had me \u2014 real meaning. It was the first\ntime I had read from our sacred Torah. And that had a lot of meaning, because when\nI was 13, in Reform congregation, we didn\u2019t \u2014 the boy didn\u2019t read from the Torah.\nThis was my first opportunity to do that. So I learned to read Hebrew without the\nvowels underneath, and you had \u2014 were either experienced, or were very adept at\nlearning how to do it. And I did learn. It was my wife Shirley, who came up with\nthe idea. She said, Bob, you\u2019re 83 now, you know, you could \u2014 you could have a\nsecond Bar Mitzvah. I'd like you to have it. And so I did it, to a large extent, for\nher, because she wanted it. We had a rabbi at the time, who \u2014 who agreed \u2014 agreed\nabs-absolutely. And I spent sessions with her, preparing for it. And we \u2014 it was the\nmost \u2014 probably the most exciting event in my life.",
        "A: Well, I guess I have to say, second to my marriage. But \u2014 but it wa \u2014 1t wa \u2014 it\nwa \u2014 So exciting to be \u2014 now I felt more totally encompassed within the realm of\nJewishness. The things that I did in life, first of all, I\u2014 I became president of two\nsynagogues, and wherever I went, we were so deeply involved. Shirley every bit as\ninvolved, and you see in her obituary how totally committed she was to Jewish\ncauses. She sat federation boards, women\u2019s division boards, worked for\norganizations that were nationwide \u2014 Jewish nationwide, worldwide. Served on the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n139July 14, 2015\n\u2014 on those boards, and on committees, and all that. So, totally engaged. Well, that\nwas my \u2014 my role, too. I assumed the presidency of the state association of Jewish \u2014\nall Jewish federations in New Jersey, there were 16 at the time. You know, those\nkinds of roles.",
        "A: I think that is probably the case. I\u2014 I would not \u2014 I do \u2014 I\u2014I don\u2019t see how I\nwould have had any opening to that. I knew things about Jewish life, and Jewish\nphilanthropy, that I learned only late \u2014 later on. I didn\u2019t know as a \u2014 a youngster,\nand maybe I never would have come across it. The fact that I became president of\nHillel, a Jewish international organization, did help me a great deal, in\nunderstanding that a Jewish life is important, and saving j \u2014 other Jewish lives is\nimportant, too. So, when it came time to set up different type of operations, I set up\n\u2014 I \u2014I-congregational life was \u2014 was important. I sat on a number of different\nboards. I did fundraising for United Jewish Appeal, because that money went not\njust to people in need, an-an-and in many ca \u2014 1n some cases, not even to just\nJewish causes, cause many of the things that we did as Jews, went for the public at\nlarge. Many of our operations are required even by statute in the state, to serve other\npeople\u2019s needs. Jewish family service, Jewish vocational service. Social service\n140\nJuly 14, 2015\nagencies like that do provide services to people who are not Jewish. So, that was\nwhat I was committed. One of the places I \u2014 I became very much involved in, was\nthe Daughters of Israel Geriatric Center. This was a home for the aged. I had aging\nparents. I ha \u2014 I\u2014 I got to know the age \u2014 the aged there. They had lived full lives,\nnow they were in the last stages of their lives. I served there for about 15 years, I\nwas vice-president there. So \u2014 but getting to know them. So one of the kinds of\nthings that I set up, with another member of our Jewish community who had owned\nsome department stores and all that, we decided we wanted to do things for elderly\npeople, the late stages of life, and many of them had given up life. The retirement\nage \u2014 and I think it may still be today, still recognized, when you\u2019re 65, back in\nthose days, when I was a youth, that was automatic, 65 you closed the book, no\nmore work, you retired, and lived the golden years. I never have found out what\nthose golden years are.",
        "A: Huh? Yeah.",
        "A: Ni-\u2014 ninety-two.\n141July 14, 2015",
        "A: But I never found out what the golden years are. I \u2014 I realize in some other\npeople\u2019s minds, it becomes stopping work and just enjoying yourself. You know,\ntravel, go see your grandkids, take vacations, things of that nature. Those are the\ngolden years. But I saw people in housing, senior housing in New Jersey. They\nwere not Jewish, just Jewish based. These were people who had given up on life. I\ndeveloped a program that would hand \u2014 may enable them to re-reengage with life,\nreinstitute things that they had done earlier in their lives. Some had been great\ncooks, some had worked in the industry, some had been musicians, and all that. But\nnow, you\u2019re over 65, so you stop doing all of that, and in the process, you lose the\nessence of life. You still have some years ahead. And so I wrote this program out,\nand my par-partner, he and \u2014 he had access to people who would fund it. We got the\nfunding, developed. That was a non-profit corporation. We didn\u2019t charge for the\nservices. We went throughout New Jersey, to homes for the aged. The experience\nwas not lectures, I didn\u2019t lecture to them, but there were big charts they had on the\nwall. And each of them would go to their chart, and they would plot out \u2014 I would le\n\u2014 give them leading questions, what were you \u2014 and they \u2014 and those questions\nbrought out their interests in life. What things that they did before. Some of them\nwere musicians, they gave that up, some were great-aunts and uncle \u2014 whatev \u2014 but\nwhatever it was that they were interested in life, some were great cooks. Whatever\n142\nJuly 14, 2015\nthey did, which they were doing no more. So they plotted that out. And I\u2014I go \u2014\nguided them through that. And many of them adopted new careers, absolutely\ncareers. The most \u2014 probably the most dynamic one in all of them was a Holocaust\nsurvivor in a home for the elderly in Cranford, New Jersey. A Holocaust survivor\nwas just waste \u2014 sitting out her \u2014 her closing years. And she was only about 65.",
        "A: And she was re-ready to just \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s it. That was it. She didn\u2019t talk. I don\u2019t think that \u2014 I don\u2019t know that\nanybody else there knew that she was a survivor. But that came out. One of the\nleading questions that I would throw at them \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 brought it out. This was part of her life experience. She then started to talk\nwithin \u2014 with the group, started to talk about her experiences, which she had never\ndisclosed to anyone. Some months after that series of seminars, I got a letter from\nher. She had found a new life. She was speaking, not to Jewish \u2014 Jewish\norganizations, the YMCA. Those were people and children who wanted to know\nabout this thing, too. They knew there was something like a Holocaust.\n143July 14, 2015",
        "A: But what was it? They had no idea. And they knew there was a war.",
        "A: Course, they got a little exposure to that in school, but what was the Holocaust?\nAnd so, she was invited to many places. The place there wa \u2014 the Young Man\u2019s\nChristian Association [indecipherable], and places far and wild \u2014 wide. And so she\nwrote me this letter.",
        "A: Oh, I mean, those are the kind of things that were so, so gratifying. And \u2014 and\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of stuff I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve done ever since. Raised a lot of money for\nJewish philanthropy and all, but \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know about during captivity. It\u2019s always been my belief that I\u2019m a\nmortal, and I don\u2019t have access to God. But I learned, through reconstructionist\nJudaism, when \u2014 when I decided we wanted to go that route, and I took a whole\ngroup, and we formed a new congregation, I learned that there\u2019s a spark of God \u2014\nwhen we are created, all of us, all the human being, there\u2019s a spark of God in each\n144July 14, 2015\nof us. And you can do something one way or another, with that spark. And I\u2019ve\nalways looked to that spark. Now, that wasn\u2019t during \u2014 during the war, because I\nhad not been exposed to reconstructionist Judaism yet, and I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know about\nthat. But I did appeal to some something, beyond mankind. I didn\u2019t know what the\nforce was. I didn\u2019t think I had the right to talk directly to God, but I appealed for\nsome kind of help, support. And then, as I got to know later on, then I \u2014 I \u2014 I reali \u2014\nbut in the hospital, there was a moving force. I could never identify what it was,\nsomething with \u2014 inside me, it\u2019s a quality, a character \u2014 each person has some kind\nof character within him. It was a character in me, I think 1t might have been an\nessence of guilt. The fact that I came through. Not the fact that I sacrificed so much\nwith the danger, and the torture of living as I did, and all that, but a feeling of\nmaybe guilt, that I\u2014 I \u2014 I was blessed. There are a lot of people in life that are going\nthrough torment in their lives. May not be what I went through, but 1t may be the\nloss of a family member, it may be a \u2014 a sickness, that your \u2014 your \u2014 you\u2019re\nconfined to. Whatever it is. But that\u2019s where my leanings ought to go, whatever I \u2014 I\n\u2014I can do that will help other people, you know. It sounds like pie in the sky.",
        "A: But it\u2019s re \u2014 re \u2014 very real. I \u2014 one place where I differed with Shirley, my wife\n[indecipherable], she was very social. She did wonderful things for \u2014 for the kind\n145\nJuly 14, 2015\nof organizations, I did, too, but she was very social. I \u2014 I\u2019m not that \u2014 that kind of a\nperson. To me there must be purpose. And I think that was a word that would\ndescribe most anything. There\u2019s a purpose in life, and I have to find what that\npurpose is, and always fulfill that purpose. I couldn\u2019t do it just sitting around a ca \u2014\na \u2014 and drinking beer with \u2014 with the guys at night. That didn\u2019t serve any particular\npurpose. But, sitting at a table, meeting with a group of people, functioning people,\nwho were doing good for some organization, an agency, social service agency, or\nany other type, that felt right to me. So, always purpose in life. Your meeting, your\n\u2014 your time. Your time is worth something. Use it in some good way. Just lounging\naround isn\u2019t going to do anything for anybody else, and in the process, doesn\u2019t do\nanything for you too \u2014 either. So there was some self-redemption that came out of\nit. Some \u2014 something selfish, yeah, I would get something out of it. And I do, and I\nhave. When I leave one of those schools, and I see these kids come up to me and\ntalk, and tell me about their grandfathers, and all that, and then I \u2014 I get the letters\nfrom them, and they say, your story was so real, I\u2014 I went home and I talked to my\nparents. I\u2019m going to talk about it, just as you said, I will talk about it with people,\nas long as I can. I \u2014 oh, kind of remarks like that, that\u2019s what moves me. Social\ncontext just don\u2019t. So that \u2014 that was \u2014 that was what evolved, and if you ask me to\n146\nJuly 14, 2015\ndescribe it clinically, why that happened, I couldn\u2019t. A psychologist, psychiatrist\nmight, but I\u2019m not sure they could either.",
        "A: Spiritual yes, preserving Judaism, because I got \u2014 even though I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not\nvery well informed on it, but from all that I have read, and all that I learned about\nwhat Judaism stand for, it\u2019s all the good things in life. And it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s dealing\nwith mankind, and it\u2019s devote \u2014 devoting part of your life to mankind.

        "A: I read his book. I read that very book of \u2014 of his, and that \u2014 that struck me. Just\nfairly recently, this maybe a year or so ago. And I said \u2014 and I\u2014I wrote, and I\nwanted to put it in the text. And Heidi and I went over it. Didn\u2019t \u2014 somehow just\ndidn\u2019t quite fit in the \u2014 in the text. Was a little bit too emotional. But, whatever. But\nthat gave me the rationale. I said, Frankl, what he preached, way back then, that\u2019s \u2014\nthat \u2014 that\u2019s me. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what I became. So I was a di\u2014 a disciple of him \u2014 of\nhis. Didn\u2019t know him, didn\u2019t know his work.",
        "A: He spoke. He must have spoken to me, yeah. So \u2014 and that \u2014 that became my \u2014\nmy remaining life\u2019s work. But helping others find meaning in their life. That\u2019s the\nmeaning in my life, 1s helping others find meaning in their lives. And that\u2019s what he\n\u2014 that was the theme that he \u2014 he preached. And the fact that he was a concentration\ncamp survivor himself, and went through all that. And his experience, when he saw\npeople who gave up, Jews who gave up on life in the camps, others who pulled\nthemselves through, by maintaining that conviction about life. And he, of course,\nwas one of them. But oh, that \u2014 that experience.",

        "A: Thank you.",

        "A: Okay. It\u2019s dated Germany, April 26, 1945. \u201cDear Mom and Pop, I\u2019m so happy, I\ncould cry. Just a few ye \u2014 hours ago, I received a letter from European theater of\noperations headquarters, telling me that Bob was okay. Here is the first paragraph\nof the letter: Dear Corporal Max, I\u2019m very happy to report that your brother, PFC\n149July 14, 2015\nRobert R. Max, ASN 15311529, was liberated by our advancing forces, from a ger\n\u2014 German \u2014 from a German prisoner of war camp, on 4 April, 1945, after having\nbeen previously reported as missing in action on 4 January, 1945. I\u2019d previously\nwritten to Bob\u2019s company clerk, and his answer was written before the report of\nBob\u2019s liberation was received, at Sixth Armored Division headquarters. So, along\nwith the letter from ETO headquarters, came a letter from Sixth Armored, dated\neight days earlier, stating that there was no further news of Bob. The letter read, in\npart, PFC Max was with his company as they attacked enemy positions, about one\nand a half miles northeast of Marvie, Belgium, on je \u2014 on 4 January, 1945. An\nenormous amount of armored enemy artillery, mortar and small arms fire, was\nencountered, and squads and individuals became separated at times, because of the\nnecessity of seeking protection from this fire. After this engagement, PFC Max was\nnot present. A search was made of the vicinity, but he could neither be found, nor\naccounted for, and up to the present date, there had been no further information on\nyour brother. Well, further information came today, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever\nreceived anything that made me happier. Captain Budrogy(ph) informed me that all\nprisoners of war, for more than 30 days, are returned to the United States. If that is\nso, there is an excellent chance of your seeing him soon. I wish I could, too. If he is\ngoing to be reassigned, I\u2019d like to get him into my outfit. Better still, I'd like to see\n150July 14, 2015\nhim stay in the States. I intend asking Captain Budrogy\u2019s(ph) advice tomorrow.\nWhat can I add to a letter like this? I\u2019m overjoyed, and can\u2019t think of another thing\nright now. I know how happy you both must be, and I know now that God must\nhave heard your prayers. All I can say is that we have a lot to be thankful for. Call\nDiana when you receive this letter. I\u2019m too excited to write any more tonight. When\nI calm down, I\u2019m going to write Bob at Central Postal Directory, APO 640, U.S.\nArmy, and within few days, I\u2019m going to send you the letters for safekeeping. Right\nnow I want to enjoy them myself. Write soon, and God bless you. Love to Ruthie.\u201d",
        "A: Yeah, that \u2014 I can imagine the emotions under which he wrote \u2014 wrote this.
