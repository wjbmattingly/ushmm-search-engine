And so he\u2019d call Brugi(ph) \u2014 he\ncalled me Brugi(ph), and he said Brugi(ph), we\u2019ve gotta fly. He was always \u2014 he\nwas \u2014 always wanted to make sure that we wouldn\u2019t bomb our own troops.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So \u2014 but I wasn\u2019t getting cr-credit for our \u2014 for our missions, for our\nreconnaissance. I had yet to drop a bomb to get credit for \u2014 for to go home. So, first,\nit was only 25 bombs \u2014 runs and you could go home. And then during the invasion\nthey raised it to 50, and then they asked \u2014 asked for volunteers to fly more. And like\na damn fool I volunteered for more, and I \u2014 65\" mission we got shot up real bad.\nReally bad. And so I went to see the colonel and he said, what\u2019s the matter? And I\nsaid, well, I\u2014 I was a poor crewman. He said, what\u2019s the matter, and I said, well, I\ndidn\u2019t give a damn whether I lived or died today. I thought I was gonna get killed.\nHe said, how would you like to go to Rome? I said, I been there. He said, how\nwould you like to go to Cairo? I said, I don\u2019t care for that. He says, suppose I give\nyou a Jeep, and for two weeks, just do what the hell you want to. Just travel \u2014 travel\nCorsica. And I said no. And then he said, how would you like to go home? And so\nI came home. And then \u2014 now they wanted me to go to the Pacific.",

My\nbest buddy there was a guy named Sargent Cobb. He would have been another\nNovember 13, 2014\nBilly Graham. He always had a Bible. He could quote from the Bible, and he was\njust a wonderful guy. So, whenever we would go \u2014 before the flight would go on,\nwe'd go for walks together, and I\u2019d take my rosary and he would \u2014 he would take\nhis prayer book. And he just could s \u2014 he would \u2014 he would \u2014 he was such a\nwonderful man, everywhere around, say \u2014 name was Sargent Cook. And \u2014 and he\nwas on a mission, and his plane was hit, and he came right under me, and I\nphotographed it. And all the propellers were stopped.",
        "Q: Oh my.",

        "Q: Sargent Cobb. What was his first name?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: All I remember was Sargent Cobb.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well see, these are the things that we don\u2019t know.",
        "A: He was from Covington, conne \u2014 Kentucky.",
        "Q: Covington, Kentucky.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you speak Italian?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: So, when you were in Italy, were you able to converse with people?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I have to tell you something. We were in Africa and \u2014 and a \u2014 we had\n\u2014 Italian troops were doing the mess work, cooking for us. So I told them \u2014 I told \u2014",
        "Q: Were these prisoners?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Were these prisoners, or American Italians?",
        "A: No, they were me \u2014 they were prisoners.",
        "Q: They were prisoners, okay.",
        "A: So I told one of them, Bartholomew, I \u2014 I told him, I said, well, I\u2014T?\u2019m-\u2014I\nwon\u2019t see you again, so I\u2019m saying goodbye. And he said, oh, if you ever get to \u2014 to\nthis town \u2014 he gave me a slip of paper \u2014 in Italy, he said, tell them I\u2019m alive. It so\nhappened it was Easter, and we weren\u2019t flying, and I found out the town was about\nfive miles away. So I started walking, and I hitched a ride, got into the town, and I \u2014\nso I went to \u2014 into the church, and I said, does anybody know this \u2014 this person?\nThey said, oh yes, he\u2019s \u2014 his parents. So they get the parents, and they \u2014 there\u2019s a\nmass said, and he called it a miracle. So the priest was saying a miracle had\nNovember 13, 2014\noccurred today, that I had told them that their son was alive. Miracoli(ph),\nmiracoli(ph), you know, miracle, miracle. Meanwhile, it was just a thing that\nhappened.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. I want to go back to your \u2014 your work a little bit. You said you flew\nseven \u2014 65 missions?",
        "A: Sixty-six.",
        "Q: Sixty-six missions. And was this all over Italy, or in different places?",
        "A: Italy, the Brenner Pass, Yugoslavia and France.",
        "Q: And what were the things that you were photographing mostly?",
        "A: Well, the one thing that I photographed that our \u2014 our unit \u2014 well, let me explain.\nThe French fleet had been taken over by the Germans.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And there was a fear that 1f we invaded, that they would come out and fight our\n\u2014 our navy. So for a full week we would go like \u2014 and this is [indecipherable] we\u2019d\ngo like we were going to bomb the \u2014 there was a battleship and a cruiser there. But\nthen we\u2019d just veer away. So we\u2019d tease them. And then one day \u2014 we didn\u2019t know\n\u2014 realize this, but at \u2014 every night we would look at what was being trundled to the\nair force, whether it was \u2014 what kind of bombs. So when we saw these long, slender\nNovember 13, 2014\nbombs, we knew that we were going after either a \u2014 the battleship, or \u2014 or a \u2014 a sub\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: So does that mean that you wouldn\u2019t know what your target was until the\nmorning you\u2019re flying a mission?",
        "A: The morning when we got briefed.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So we got briefed and told that our target was the stra \u2014 the battleship\nStrasbourg, and the cruiser La Galissonni\u00e9re, and \u2014 and so we went in \u2014 we went\nin five waves. And the first and second got in, but the third and fourth really got s-\nsmattered. In fact, 26 out of the 52 planes had either wounded, or were \u2014 had \u2014 were\n\u2014 had been \u2014 either had wounded aboard, or the planes had been h-hurt.",
        "Q: That\u2019s huge.",
        "A: So we got it, and we got a presidential unit citation for that, that I\u2019m proud of.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Tell me then about \u2014 you mentioned again, off camera, that \u2014 that at\none point in Italy you entered a cave, and what had happened in this place?",
        "A: Well, what happened was, the Germans were \u2014 Germans still occupied Rome,\nand they would meet at a certain spot where the troops would gather for\ntransportation back to their base. And somebody threw a grenade and killed \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know it was, I think 30 or something like that, and they demanded ransom.\nNovember 13, 2014\nThey \u2014 but I\u2019ve forgotten that number, whether it was 10 to one or something like\nthat, but I remember it was a high number.",
        "Q: That means ransom in what? In money, or in \u2014",
        "A: No, in people. Th-They \u2014 the Germans wanted so many people to pay for this\ncrime.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So they took them in the cave, and they \u2014 and they \u2014 was at random, but they \u2014\nthey machine-gunned them all, and then just closed the cave. And \u2014 and \u2014 and when\nwe \u2014 when we occupied Rome, it was opened. And \u2014 and I went \u2014 I was one that\nwas allowed to see the \u2014 but what I remember was a little girl. She had a white dress\non, but she had been hit, and there were spots on her dress of blood, like it was a\nfloral display.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And they don\u2019t \u2014 they were \u2014 they were machine-gunned, and they either fell to\nthe right or left, or \u2014 or came over, and \u2014 and I never forgot the brutality of \u2014 of\nkilling that little girl.",
        "Q: The \u2014 there are many \u2014 you know, horrific thoughts, you know, or \u2014 or scenes\nthat one could imagine. But one of them 1s, is weren\u2019t Italians allies of the\nGermans? And they would take Italian civilians \u2014\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: No, they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 no, they weren\u2019t. They just \u2014 they \u2014 they took them as\nprisoners.",
        "Q: They took these people as prisoners?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then I saw another sight that I\u2019Il never forget.",
        "Q: Before we go there, how soon after this massacre had the Americans arrived?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know. It was the summer. I remember it was the summer of \u201944 \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 when they opened the caves.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay, tell me about the other incident.",
        "A: Well, the other one was, as the Germans were leaving \u2014 were leaving Rome, we\nwent ar \u2014 we went after them. We were bombing their \u2014 their \u2014 their convoys, we\nwere \u2014 we were really hitting them hard. And so when the \u2014 when the \u2014 when the\nwar \u2014 when the \u2014 when the war was still moving up, we went \u2014 we drove past these\nconvoys of dead soldiers. And I\u2019ll never forget the stench of \u2014 of burnt flesh. I can\nsmell it to this day.",
        "Q: Can you? Yeah.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Yeah. And \u2014 and there was just one truck, and one vehicle after another with \u2014\nwith soldiers that were \u2014 were burned to death, you know, from our bombing, and \u2014\nand then, one night, while we were bombing, we were bombing an airfield, and we\n\u2014 we came in at low level, and I remember we always had machine guns we were\nfiring. And there was a man running. And I remember I grabbed that \u2014 the machine\ngun just as tight as I could, and I was \u2014 I was gonna kill the bastard. And so he was\nrunning, and I don\u2019t know if we hit him, or he dove into a ditch. But when we\npulled off, I \u2014 I-\u2014 I clenching \u2014 I was still clenching my fists. And I said, what the\nhell are you doing? You know, I wa \u2014 I meant to kill him. I meant to kill him, and \u2014\nand that wasn\u2019t my nature. But I was \u2014 I was determined to kill him, and not \u2014 not\nonly kill him, but call him a bastard. And \u2014 and I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t made that way.",
        "Q: That sound \u2014 kind of shocked you about yourself at that moment, huh?",
        "A: Yeah. And then there was another thing that happened along that line. The\nGerman army was bringing supplies down from \u2014 from the bavar \u2014 I mean, from the\npass, and from \u2014 there was a little town called Udinay(ph) and there was a bunch of\nrail lines, and it was a \u2014 I remember it was May, and it was a beautiful Sunday. And\nso, 1t was \u2014 but we knew that the \u2014 the rail lines there merged, and there was a lot of\nboxcars full of ammunition. So we went after them. So, I was photographing that\nday, and we let go our bombs, and boy there were secondary and tertiary explosions\nNovember 13, 2014\nand it wasn\u2019t long there was just smoke was up \u2014 almost at our altitude. So, I called\nthe colonel, I said, let\u2019s go back and get it again. So we photographed it again, cause\nwe were lead, and we went back and photographed it again and bis \u2014 it was still\nexplosions all over the place. So when we got back to the squadron, I said, boy, we\nreally plastered those bastards today, or we \u2014 we got them today, and \u2014 and so the\nnext morning we had a briefing how many locomotives we had hit, and how many\nboxcars we had hit. And \u2014 and so you felt real good, and then they finally said yeah,\nbut 2,000 slave laborers were killed. They were in the \u2014 and that was another thing\nthat stuck with me, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s has always stuck with me, that here I thought\nsomething was re \u2014 oh, that\u2019s really performed a big deed, but somebody had paid\nfor it.",
        "Q: I \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 I mean, a reaction that I \u2014 I have is \u2014 is almost like, in war how\ncould you avoid that?",
        "A: Well, yeah, I know, but that \u2014 that\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s what comes round, you \u2014 like\nwhen you\u2019re \u2014 when you first go in you\u2019re looking for glory, you\u2019re looking for\nglamour.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And you don\u2019t \u2014 sometimes you \u2014 you don\u2019t get it.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you know \u2014 let me segue a little bit and ask this, did you know \u2014 have\nany news at that time of what was happening to Europe\u2019s Jews?",
        "A: No \u2014no. But I knew what was happening to the little \u2014 little children. And that\nwa \u2014 that \u2014 that is, they would gather at our camp just begging for \u2014 they would\ncome out with cans, and whatever scraps of food we had, they would give them.\nAnd so anyway, there was a \u2014 my best buddy was a guy named Red. And so we\nwould go in, and we would get more pancake \u2014 well, you either got pancakes, or\nyou got powdered eggs for breakfast. And so we would get pancakes, more than we\neat \u2014 could eat, and then put more \u2014 a little bit more syrup. And we\u2019d come out and\ngive them to \u2014 to the kids. And so there was one little boy had his arm \u2014 he didn\u2019t\nhave his hand, he just \u2014 and was always \u2014 always getting beat up by the other kids.\nSo Red said, well, let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s go help that little guy. So we took him down to the\nmachine shop, and we had an artificial arm made for him.",
        "Q: Oh, wow.",
        "A: But it was the clips, you know, basically a bunch of clips. And then the little boy\nwas using his as \u2014 as a weapon with the others. He was beating the hell out of the\nweapons. So Red and I said, here we formed a monster. But 1t was something, poor\nlittle kids, you know, just begging for food.",
        "Q: Hungry.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: That stuck with me all the time, too.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. So, did you know then, when \u2014 when you heard that there had been\nslave laborers who had been killed, did you know that the Germans were using\nslave laborers?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, we\u2019d seen that.",
        "Q: Had you, huh?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: What had you seen?",
        "A: Well, we seen \u2014 we seen them on the roads a lot, with the \u2014 with the chur \u2014 with\nthe star.",
        "Q: So that could have been ger \u2014 that could have been Jewish slave laborers.",
        "A: Jews \u2014 Jews, yeah, they had them working on roads a lot, and just a lot of dirty\nstuff too, along with it.",
        "Q: But the newspaper and American military \u2014",
        "A: No, nothing.",
        "Q: \u2014 radio didn\u2019t tell you \u2014 didn\u2019t say anything, huh?",
        "A: No, not until after the war when we heard about the \u2014 the Auschwitzes and the \u2014\nand the \u2014 the death camps.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "Q: Okay, okay. So after the 66\" mission, your commanding officer allowed you to\ngo home?",
        "A: Yes, he \u2014 he thought I had enough, I guess \u2014",

        "A: No, no, it w \u2014 w-we \u2014 we were \u2014 we were hitting a place called \u2014 it was a naval\nbase. Got worked over there. And we couldn\u2019t get our wheels down, and so we had\n\u2014 we had a choice, we could either parachute out or \u2014 or crash \u2014 crash land. And so\nI \u2014 we had faith in our pilot and so we said we\u2019d ride him down. And so, you\u2019re\nNovember 13, 2014\ncoming at about a hundred miles an hour and all of a sudden you hear the\nscreeching sounds of the metal. But it was such a jolt that the ammunition can came\noff and hit me in the face \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 because I \u2014 I had taken the brace position. You take a brace position, you put\nyour hands behind your neck and pull your neck down. And this thing came down\nand hit me. It was about 50 pounds of ammunition hit me in the face.",

        "A: Oh, about \u2014 about a month.",
        "Q: That must have been a nice month.",

        "A: I\u2014 well, then I was reclassified.",
        "Q: Okay. In what way?",
        "A: I was to go to Pacific, and I said now, what can I do to get trained? They said,\nwell, we need overseas navigators.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I mean, over water navigators. So I said, well sign me up. So I was signed up.\nAnd Id finished basic and was in advanced when the war ended.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "Q: Oh, so \u2014",
        "A: So I wa\u2014I was \u2014 and I had asked in advance for approval to go to George\nWashington University.",
        "Q: Excuse me. When you say you were \u2014 when the war ended, do you mean the\nameric \u2014 the European war, or the Pacific war?",
        "A: Pacific war.",

        "Q: In August \u201945.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. And so you had asked to go to George Washington University?",

        "A: I had nine \u2014 I had nine air medals, I had a Purple Heart, I had distinguished unit\ncitation. Anyway, so the war ended in August, and I put in for release, because of\nthe medals and si \u2014 the time I\u2019d served. And so I was approved. And so one day I\nwas home in September, and the \u2014 one day I was on a train, the next day I was in\nuniversity.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "Q: Amazing. I want to ask something though that I missed earlier on. I\u2019m sorry \u2019'm\ndoubling back. But I understood you had also flown over Germany, is that correct?",
        "A: Over what?",
        "Q: Over Germany during the war.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, you hadn\u2019t.",

        "Q: \u2014 reconnaissance or \u2014 or \u2014",
        "A: Against the German \u2014 I flew against the Germans in Yugoslavia and other\nplaces, but that was it.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. All right. So then you\u2019re in George Washington University, and\nyou\u2019re in class. And what did you study?",
        "A: Well, I wanted to be a diplomat.",
        "Q: I remember you said, yeah.",
        "A: So I was taking courses in \u2014 in economics in \u2014 1n \u2014 1n international economics,\nand I became a \u2014 kind of a \u2014 well, a friend \u2014 more than a friend, he was my monitor,\nNovember 13, 2014\nTed Acheson, he was Dean Acheson\u2019s brother. And so I was studying international\neconomics, and I had all kinds of offers of jobs, to go into banking, because the\nbanks were just being redone. I had Caterpillar tractor, I had banks in New York\nwanted me and \u2014 and so. But I was going with a lady that later became my wife.\nAnd I had offers to go to FBI, I had offers. But then there was \u2014 Ted Acheson said,\ngo down and see this organization, and it\u2019s being formed, and go down and see my\nbuddies down there. So I went down there and ha \u2014 they was these \u2014 forming the\nCIA.",
        "Q: Oh, so the OSS was being formed into the CIA?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So I was put in charge of \u2014 I became an expert on Soviet industries. And I knew\nwhere all the industries were. And in 1940 \u2014 1954 \u2014",
        "Q: Can I stop back at \u2014 when did you join the CIA?",
        "A: 1948.",
        "Q: 1948, okay.",
        "A: It was called the CIG at that time.",
        "Q: And what did the G stand for?",
        "A: Central Intelligence Group.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And became CIA.",
        "Q: Okay. And it \u2014 and you so \u2014 and you say in 1954, when you knew about all of\nthe Soviet industry \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, I was \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 I was being watched pretty carefully by the CIA. I mean, I was a \u2014 as an\nuncoming \u2014 upcoming person.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I met a guy that was head of the navy photo interpretation unit.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so the CIA said they were going to form a new unit. And I don\u2019t know why,\nbut I went in a darkened room, and I was told I had a new job. And I said, well,\nwhat am I gonna be doing? They said, well, we can\u2019t tell you. Course it was the\ndevelopment of the U-2. So I was made chief of information.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because I knew about the rush \u2014 where the Russian industries were.",
        "Q: I see. But your \u2014 your knowledge in analyzing photographs, did that come later,\nthat expertise?\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Well, I took \u2014 I took courses in photo interpretation, I passed them easily\nbecause I knew it. But it \u2014 photo interpretation becomes, the more you\u2019re in it, the\nmore you learn.",
        "Q: Well, tell us \u2014 tell me a little bit about that, because a lot of people won\u2019t\nunderstand how do you get to be knowledgeable about something like that.",
        "A: Well, let me mention another thing though. I had a \u2014 the \u2014 the executive was a\nguy named Chick Camp.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He was the dean of \u2014 had been dean of men at Dartmouth, and he was \u2014 been a\nMarine major, and he could talk to you up here, and down here.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So he called me in and he said, we \u2014 we\u2019re making you the \u2014 you\u2019re going to\nmake all the briefing boards for the director to brief Eisenhower, and he said, if you\nget his \u2014 if you get the bosses ass in a sling, he said, Ill fire yours. And so that kind\nof gets your attention. So I was put in charge of writing \u2014 making the briefing\nboards, and the notes that would go to Eisenhower.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so I \u2014I\u2014I got my \u2014 oh yeah, I \u2014 he \u2014 he said, you\u2019re going to get the same\nclearances that the boss has. I had 12 clearances.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "Q: Mow \u2014- wow.",
        "A: On nuclear \u2014 on \u2014 on bacteriological, on si\u2014 on \u2014 on communications\nintelligence, on just all \u2014 you know, covert intelligence, on covert photography, all\nkinds of thing. So I became his right hand man, and so from that point on, I was in\ncharge of writing and making briefing boards for all the presidents, up to Reagan.",
        "Q: So from Eisenhower to Reagan, I mean, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 Carter and Reagan, wow.",
        "A: If you had a chance to meet them all \u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me, did I miss? Ford, Gerry Ford, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Got a chance to meet them all.",
        "Q: Wow. If\u2014",
        "A: Eisenhower was my favorite though.",
        "Q: Tell me why.",
        "A: Oh, he was \u2014 he was just a wonderful guy.",
        "Q: In what way\u201d?",
        "A: Well, he was so knowledgeable, you \u2014 he had no \u2014 he knew about photography,\nand so the briefing boards, I had to look at the briefing boards, and I had to annotate\nanything that looked suspicious of any kind, whether it be a ground formation, or\nNovember 13, 2014\nsomething that been pretty innocuous. But he would \u2014 he would look at the briefing\nboard, and he\u2019d say, you know, what about this, what about that? Well, I would try\nto make sure that my boss had the answers, so I would write the notes that would go\nwith the briefing boards, two copies. One went to the president, one went to the\nCIA and the Department of Defense.",
        "Q: So, when you were in \u2014 put in charge of these briefing boards, these were\nbriefing boards of satellite images?",
        "A: Oh, first U-2.",
        "Q: First U-2.",
        "A: Then satellites, and then SR-71, and then combat reconnaissance.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: During Vietnam there was all kinds of photography. But I was also briefed in \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know if you know it or not, but we had planes that were flying supposedly\ncommercial flights, but hell, they had cameras in them.",
        "Q: So, like on commercial carriers?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Like TWA, or Pan Am, or something like that?",
        "A: Oh yeah, anybody.",
        "Q: Anybody.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Fake \u2014 fake airplanes. Lot of dirty work. But the whole idea was to get pictures.\nWe had \u2014 we had Greeks, we had foreigners with \u2014 we equipped them with cameras\nand they\u2019d bring back photography.",
        "Q: And this was all kinds of photography then, not just fr \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 images from above?",
        "A: Oh yeah, no, attaches photography, parade photography. No, they would pay \u2014\nthey\u2019d pay a foreign seaman, they\u2019d give him a camera. And they would go up \u2014\nclimb up the \u2014 the pole, and take pictures of \u2014 of Cairo e \u2014 ca \u2014 not Cairo,\nAlexandria, Egypt, all the ports and so forth, so we could see what was coming in\nand come \u2014 going out. Russia.",
        "Q: Was the main purpose though, is \u2014 was the Soviet Union, to get in \u2014 you know,\naerial or photographic information of what Soviet activities were?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You can bribe people. You know \u2014 you know what plane we could fly with\ncameras in it that \u2014 that was welcomed? The PX plane.",
        "Q: I can imagine.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Well, the thing about it is we allowed foreigners to go into PX. So hell, they\nwould wait for the plane to come in, not realizing we were photographing the hell\nout of the country.",
        "Q: So then Germany in particular that would make a big difference.",
        "A: Oh yeah. France, especially. France 1 \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: France had a nuclear program going that they were keeping secret. South\nAfrica was another one.",
        "Q: This is fascinating information \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 it was \u2014 it\u2019s just incredible.",
        "A: Now, the first thing that we did \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 the big question was the bomber gap. Did the Soviets have more planes than\nwe did?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So we \u2014 we flew over \u2014 we flew five missions in 1956, and we could go to the\npresident, Eisenhower, we could say, Mr. President, there\u2019s no bomber gap. The\nrest of them don\u2019t have that many bombers.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Then the next thing was missiles. We could te \u2014 we could go to the president,\nsay Mr. President, there\u2019s no missile gap. And then we had the Cuban missile crisis.\nThen we had the Suez War. And then we had all these places \u2014 in eight years,\nEisenhower kept us out of war, and \u2014 because we were watching everything.",
        "Q: Tell me, because we\u2019re talking \u2014 we\u2019re going to be talking about the satellite\nimages that were taken during World War II \u2014 excuse me, not satellite images, but\naerial photography \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q:\u2014in World War II, when did you first hear about Holocaust events, and \u2014 and the\natrocities to the degree that they took place?",
        "A: Right after the war. They \u2014",
        "Q: Right after the war.",
        "A: \u2014 IT heard about it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t do anything. Now, what happened to me was, there was a program\non television called \u201cThe Holocaust.\u201d",
        "Q: And this took place when?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know. It \u2014 probably in the 70s sometime.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Maybe in \u2014 maybe in the 60s. I \u2014 I remember it was \u2014 it was \u2014 it was one of\nthose that went five or six nights.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then I wondered if by chance, when we were photographing the Auschwitz,\nthe \u2014 or the I.G. Farben, I knew that we were \u2014 during World War II we were\nflying over their synthetic fuel plants.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So there was one at Auschwitz. We wondered \u2014 I wondered 1f by chance when\nwe were flying over that, did they see anything at the death camp, did we see the\ndeath camp. The first can of photography I put on the light table \u2014 now, keep in\nmind I\u2019m using micro-stereoscopes now, I\u2019m using fancy optics, and enlargements\nand everything else.",
        "Q: Before we get there, ha \u2014 you \u2014 when you wondered that, after you saw this\nprogram \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you know where such photographs were archived? Where the repositories\nwere?\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, I knew that \u2014 I knew that there was World War II, or there was World\nWar II photography.",
        "Q: Where was it?",
        "A: At Venn(ph) Hill.",
        "Q: And where is that?",
        "A: Was in a special repository.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And where is this place, Venn(ph) Hill?",
        "A: In Virginia.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Okay, so it was a CIA place, or was it \u2014",
        "A: No, it was air force.",
        "Q: It was air force.",
        "A: So I called for the photographs of the I.G. Farben plant.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so when I put them on, the first can of film I put on, I saw people being\nmarched to their death.",
        "Q: Oh my God.",
        "A: So, I\u2014I- and I have the example here. So anyway, I went to the director, and I\nsaid, I\u2019ve got this. And I-I \u2014 I can develop it into a project. But see, this was the\ntime when we were having all the problems with Iran. And \u2014 and the ri\u2014 so I\u2014I\nNovember 13, 2014\nhad to be careful, because you know, I didn\u2019t want to be accused, what the hell you\ndoing looking at Holocaust pictures when the Iran is going down the tube,\nintelligence. So I\u2014I\u2014JI told him, I said, I have this photography. So he said he\nwanted to brief the president. So I made briefing boards, and he briefed the\npresident. And then the president \u2014 the per \u2014 key person there was Jody Powell.\nNow, I met a guy named Michael Berenbaum. Okay, now Michael, when he heard\nabout I had the photography, he called me and \u2014 and he was in a \u2014 down on either\nK, or one of those streets, and he had a bunch of artifacts that he was trying to \u2014 but\nit was Jodie Foster that said, hey look, this is \u2014",
        "Q: Jody Powell, you mean.",
        "A: Jody Powell was pre \u2014 was Carter\u2019s press agent. Was Jodie Foster said, this 1s\nthe kind of stuff that\u2019s around here, we\u2019re not gathering it up.",
        "Q: You mean Jody Powell.",
        "A: Jody Powell, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Jody Powell.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Okay. [laughter] I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not that \u2014 that \u2014 what\u2019s the name of the\nguy that was old and transferred Jody Powell \u2014 Jodie Foster? Anyway, so I\ndeveloped this liking for \u2014 for Michael Berenbaum.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I said hell, I think there\u2019s more stuff available. He said, you\u2019re kidding. I\nsaid, no, there isn\u2019t. And he said, you mean that \u2014 you mean you got photography of\nAuschwitz and \u2014 and nobody knows about it? I said, that\u2019s true. He said, you\u2019re\nkidding. I said no, I\u2019m not kidding. So the president was briefed, Carter was\nbriefed, and he said he liked the idea. So \u2014 so \u2014 so I wrote \u2014",
        "Q: So you got the green light, basically, to be able to do more analysis?",
        "A: Yeah. But at the same time I had to be careful because I was in charge of making\nsure that all the intelligence was flowing, briefing boards. So sometimes I would go\nin on weekends and \u2014 and do this work. Or, I\u2019d do this work whenever I was\nwaiting for work to come in.",
        "Q: So this was \u2014 I mean, in all of the sours \u2014 I mean, it all had been in Venn(ph)\nHill? All the photographs that you eventually looked at and analyzed were from this\none archive?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: And you know, strangely enough, about half of them had really been destroyed.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Half of the missions had been destroyed. So I made sure, I told them, I said, put\nthe \u2014 put the stamp on that can and don\u2019t let it out, and so that \u2014 a stamp I put on\nthat can is still on it, I think.",
        "Q: Okay. Did the Brits have any kind of aerial photography like this?",
        "A: Yes. But they didn\u2019t look at it either. Nobody looked at tt.",
        "Q: So the \u2014 if I can understand this, the photography had been taken of camps, but\nnot because they were camps, but because there were plants nearby? Is that the\nreason why \u2014",
        "A: No, no, they were \u2014 the photography was taken for one purpose and one purpose\nalone, was to bomb the I.G. Farben plant.",
        "Q: And did the flan \u2014 plan \u2014 did the I.G. barb \u2014 Farben plant have a pla \u2014 have\nauxiliaries in different cities and locations, or was this the one place that ended up\nbeing near Auschwitz?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, nobody had looked at any of them.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Ebensee, all \u2014 all of the ones you saw today, most of them that \u2014 nobody had\never looked at the photography. So I started looking at them on my own time primar\n\u2014 well, let me explain.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I was a senior officer.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I get word that hey, we got a mission over the Middle East. So wer \u2014 all right,\nnow, where is it gonna land? Says, well, it\u2019s gonna land at Wiesbaden. Okay, now\nwho\u2019s processing it? Well, they\u2019re gonna process it at Wiesbaden. All right, now\nwhen \u2014 where does it go from there? It\u2019s going to the [indecipherable] the Azores\nand it\u2019s going to Dover. Well, at that \u2014 meantime, I would be calling people in \u2014 to\ncome in, but I had \u2014 I had a maybe six hour time that I had on my own, waiting to\ndo work. So that\u2019s when I would do the work on the \u2014 on the \u2014 so I was told to \u2014 so\nI was given the go ahead to produce the \u2014 the document, and at the same time, there\nwas a guy named Seymour Bolton. He wanted me to talk to \u2014 to Jimmy Carter.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 and then Jody Powell, the same thing. Say, we got to get the boss really\ngoing. So then, I was supposed to meet with Elie Wiesel. And Elie Wiesel though,\nwould \u2014 had \u2014 he had kind of \u2014 when I talked to him, they asked him to be a leader\nNovember 13, 2014\nin the \u2014 in the \u2014 for a Holocaust Museum. And Elie Wiesel said he\u2019d never raised\nmoney, he didn\u2019t know how to raise money. And \u2014 but anyway, so I had Elie\nWiesel for an hour by myself, and what I\u2019Il never forget, Elie Wiesel hated brutality\nof any kind. And at that time the Infantata(ph) was going on and he didn\u2019t like the\nIsraelis for beating up on people. But he told me about the hardships, the loss of his\nfather, but more often \u2014 I mean, more times he\u2019d come back to his \u2014 the la \u2014 his loss\nof his sister. I think she was nine years old, and \u2014 and she walking sh \u2014 when she\nand her mother were separated from them, sh-she held onto her mother, but she\nlooked back at him. That\u2019s all he remembered about this sister\u2019s death. And he \u2014 he\nalways pra \u2014 you know, her \u2014 her innocence, he proclaimed her innocent. Well, now\n\u2014now, getting back to Michael Berenbaum. He was telling me that the tremendous\nf\u2014not fight, but opposition, both sides, the liberals and the \u2014 and the \u2014 and the \u2014\nand the conservative Jews. Now, especially the \u2014 the conservative Jews wanted\nanother Yad Vashem.",
        "Q: Oh, you mean about the museum, what kind of a museum it should be.",
        "A: Museum, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Well \u2014 and then \u2014 but he wanted it, and that \u2014 he felt that it would be doing more\ngood by being an educational one. So he was emphasizing the emph \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014\nNovember 13, 2014\nthe \u2014 the liberal view really, but the educational view. But at the same time, about\nthis time, when I found the photographs, my boss, the director of \u2014 Stanfield\nTurner, he was a friend of \u2014 of \u2014 he was a classmate of Carter. He told me, he said\nlook, he said, I\u2019d like for you to get \u2014 get to brief these people in Skokie. So I said,\nwell, I have relatives in Highland Park, and he said that yeah, he said, well, I'll\narrange it. Get in touch with Michael Berenbaum. So I got in touch with Michael\nBerenbaum. And I was afraid to \u2014 to gi-give this briefing, and he said there would\nabout 70 - 80 survivors of \u2014",
        "Q: Of Auschwitz?",
        "A: Yeah, the Illinois branch.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because I had briefed several temples, and when I showed the pictures of people\nbeing marched to their death, invariably somebody would \u2014 excuse me \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: \u2014 somebody would break down crying. So I thought, oh boy, this is going to be a\ndisaster. And strangely enough, when I got there, I don\u2019t know why, but su \u2014 a sort\nof a feeling came over me that hey, these people are easy to get \u2014 going to be good\nto handle. So I said, now I\u2019m going to show you what I have, what I know, but I\nNovember 13, 2014\nwant people to come up and point out things that I miss. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I want you to\nparticipate with me here. And boy it took fire.",
        "Q: Did it?",
        "A: Oh, it was just wonderful. They were \u2014 they were really in it. And \u2014",
        "Q: What did they do, what did people do?",
        "A: Well, they pointed out things. They said, now that\u2019s \u2014 the boxcars \u2014 the boxcars\nwere here, and \u2014 and then at night, what they \u2014 they were ex \u2014 telling this \u2014 telling\nme experiences at the \u2014 at the camps at night, what they did at night and how they\ngot along. And then who died, and how they died. But \u2014 but then there was a little \u2014\nthere was a little break and there was coffee time. And one of the fellows came up,\nand I said look, I said, how in the hell did you \u2014 you survive the cold, because that\u2019s\ne \u2014 Auschwitz is equivalent to the Canadian \u2014 U.S. border. And he said, well that\nwas our secret. And I said, can you share it with me? And he said yes, he could. I\nsay, well what \u2014 what was it? He said, well, he said, you know, the cement bags\nused to come in. The bags were made out of paper and tar and paper to keep them\ndry. And he said, we made ourselves underwear. Made themselves thermal\nunderwear. Then a lady came up, and I said, I guess you strived to get first in line.\nShe said no \u2014",
        "Q: First in line for what?\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: First in line for what? What should she \u2014 what line was the first in line for? What\nwas the line for?",
        "A: For food.",
        "Q: Oh, for food, okay, mm-hm.",
        "A: Cause they \u2014 they had \u2014 I say, well, did you get in line at the beginning or at the\nend? If you went in the beginning, you got sure. She said no, about the middle. I\nsaid, well, why the middle? She said, because if you\u2019re at the beginning you go \u2014\nonly got water. But at the \u2014 but the bin \u2014 beginning \u2014 I mean, the middle to the end,\nyou got some \u2014 some potato peelings.",
        "Q: So it sounds to me \u2014",
        "A: They got \u2014 they got food \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 more nutrition as food.",
        "Q: It sounds to me that \u2014 that this was such a huge event because the photographs\nthat you were showing, this aerial photography was the first real proof \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s it, right there. That\u2019s what made them \u2014 that\u2019s what th \u2014 not a person\ncried, because they said, you\u2019re proving the fact that the Holocaust existed. That\nwas \u2014 that was \u2014 that was a \u2014 that was a whole \u2014 whole \u2014 their whole feeling, was\nNovember 13, 2014\nthat I had done something. Now, when I got back \u2014 when I got back I talked to Dr.\nBerenbaum. I said, hey, look. Gosh almighty, the stories they were telling me, they\ngotta get \u2014 gotta get something done with them. So Berenbaum said, I\u2019ll \u2014 Dino, I\nagree with you, he said, but we don\u2019t have any money. So then it later was Steven\nSpielberg put the money. That\u2019s \u2014 but it started with \u2014 wi \u2014 I mean, he \u2014 he knew\nabout it, but it was emphasized by my \u2014 my story, and \u2014 and \u2014 but th-they \u2014 they\nhad to show me their \u2014 their \u2014 their tattoos. The men were, for the most part were, I\nsay about five foot five, they\u2019d been starved in there. And the women were even,\nsome of them were \u2014",
        "Q: Smaller, huh?",
        "A: But one woman came up to me and she said, you know \u2014 you know why I\nwanted to become American? I said no. She said well, she said she was liberated,\nand she said she were \u2014 they were filthy dirty. So he said, th-they put up a shower\nunit, but she said they put curtains around it. I mean, a tent \u2014 the tents around it.\nAnd she said, I had my first bath. And she said, I knew then I wanted to be an\nAmerican. She said, they didn\u2019t bother us. She said they \u2014 they let us shower, and\nshe said they didn\u2019t bother \u2014 and stories like that. And then they \u2014 then they start\ntelling me about some of the little sneaky things they would do. That was \u2014 that was\nit \u2014 that was interesting too.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "Q: So, was this because \u2014",
        "A: How they falsified, they \u2014 they \u2014 especially the \u2014 the woman that were hired \u2014\nnot hired, but the women that made records.",
        "Q: What were they falsifying?",
        "A: They fal \u2014 falsifying records.",
        "Q: What ki \u2014 and what kind of records?",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 the personnel were \u2014 on personnel primarily, I guess.",
        "Q: I see. I see. So \u2014",
        "A: But anyway, th-th-there \u2014 there were so many stories coming at me, just one\nright after the other. They were so wanted \u2014 they so wanted to share them with me.",
        "Q: Was this your first \u2014 as a result of the photographs, had you ever met with any\nsurvivors before, of the camps?",
        "A: No, but you see, my best friend was mar \u2014 was Cohen, a boy named Cohen.\nAnd he\u2019s a classmate and he \u2014 he still comes to all of our funerals, our family\nfunerals. I can\u2019t re \u2014 I can\u2019t think of his first name. But anyway, I have \u2014 I had\nJewish friends. Simply because the Jewish friends \u2014 made friends because they\nwere on the out, and Italian in a German \u2014 German high school was on the out. I\nmean \u2014",
        "Q: Way \u2014 way back in Missouri, you mean?\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So we made friends.",
        "Q: Okay. So you found out how \u2014 you had personal connections with people who\nwere Jewish already, but had any of them had relatives who were survivors?",
        "A: No, most of them had \u2014 lost relatives. But let me mention now, now all of a\nsudden, I get \u2014 I get some \u2014 I\u2019m called down to the National Archives to brief the\npress.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So word goes out that \u2014 that Dino knows a little bit about the Holocaust.\nImmediately I get calls also, how much did the Jews pay you? What did the Zionists\n\u2014 how did the Zionists \u2014 then there was a guy up in \u2014 there was a doctor up in \u2014 up\nin, I think Rhode Island that was giving me a hard time.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Oh yeah. That I had \u2014 and then there was a \u2014 there was a guy up in Canada that\n\u2014 that I finally told him, I \u2014 he told me \u2014 he said that I had \u2014 had the zipper effect on\nthe photograph, I had faked photographs. And you know what it is? It was people\nstanding in line and they were \u2014 there was a gap, and the sun was si \u2014 shining, so it\nlooked like a zipper. And I said, you dumb bastard, when you learn something more\nNovember 13, 2014\nabout photo interpretation, you call me again, but don\u2019t call me. But this guy up in\nCanada has constantly ti \u2014 tried to find fault. He\u2019s a professor. But then also, I got\ninvolved with the ta \u2014 the Englishman that sued \u2014",
        "Q: David Irving?",
        "A: Yeah, that said that the Holocaust didn\u2019t exist, and the \u2014 the lady down in\nuniversity, and I \u2014 so I told her, I \u2014 I\u2014 you know, I told her fo \u2014 the originals are\nstill available, so she could prove her point with the originals, and she did. But then",
        "Q: So, in other words, the whole can of worms, or Holocaust denial opened up as\nwell \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 when the photographs appeared.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Yeah, but I \u2014 yeah but \u2014 yeah but I \u2014 on that scrapbook that I gave my\nfriend here, well, you see, there\u2019s a lot of complimentary notes 1n it too, I don\u2019t\nknow what \u2014",
        "Q: Of course there 1s.",
        "A: Yeah. But also, I got called by the district attorney of Chicago three times tha \u2014\nwhether I\u2019d testify against people that were at Auschwitz that claimed that they\ndidn\u2019t see anything, that they were in the tower but they didn\u2019t see anything. And so\nNovember 13, 2014\nI \u2014I said, okay, sure, Pll testify against them. And when he told them who the\nexpert was, why they pulled away. They went back. So it\u2019s been a \u2014 been a lot of\ngood things, but there\u2019s still people don\u2019t believe that the Holocaust existed.",
        "Q: Well, it sou \u2014 yeah \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 and if you have proof like this \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, so \u2014 yeah \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So \u2014 so that one picture of people being marched to their death has done more\ngood \u2014 and strangely enough, that was the first one. Now, something interesting too.\nI looked at Ebensee. Ebensee, the first troops that \u2014 that \u2014 that freed them, was\ntroops from my father\u2019s old a-army outfit.",
        "Q: No kidding?",
        "A: The 80\" \u2014 80\" division. Isn\u2019t that something?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So anyway, all of this is tied in, and so \u2014 so when \u2014 when \u2014 when my friend first\n\u2014 she\u2019ll beg you for anything.",
        "Q: Excuse me?",
        "A: She\u2019s \u2014\nNovember 13, 2014\nQ3: He\u2019s talking about me.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, okay.",
        "A: First \u2014 first she sa \u2014 first I gave her pictures, that wasn\u2019t enough. Then she saw\nmy scrapbooks, then she wanted my scrapbook.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about my colleague here from the museum, who could see, of\ncourse, the value of these photographs, yeah.",
        "A: Well, yeah. And you know, the thing that \u2014 the thing that convinced me to give\nall this stuff to you; I looked \u2014 I \u2014 I Googled these ca \u2014 these camps, and there\u2019s not\nmany photographs on them. There\u2019s no photographs, there\u2019s no [indecipherable].\nSo, where there\u2019s photographs, use the photographs. Not only that, but the\ncombination of the photograph and the sketches.",
        "Q: That\u2019s ri \u2014 and then you have \u2014 you have people on the \u2014 who were on the\nground, the survivors, who can say, I was in this barracks, or this barracks. It is par\n\u2014 it\u2019s a puzzle, and these are the various pieces of that puzzle.",
        "A: Well, let me mention. I\u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I think I briefed about probably a half a dozen\ntemples.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And one guy came up to me and he said he was from Ebensee, he had been at\nEbensee. And he told me, he said, you know what the punishment was? I said no.\nNovember 13, 2014\nHe said, they\u2019d take you out in that \u2014 that square, and they\u2019d spray you with water,\nand you\u2019d \u2014 you\u2019d freeze to death. You know what \u2014 what \u2014 so \u2014",
        "Q: Here\u2019s another quo \u2014 quandary, though, that I\u2019ve got. And that is, you first\nidentified these photos during the Carter administration, which 1s, I\u2019m saying 30\nyears, 35 years after the war 1s over. And when they were first taken, albeit 1t was\nfor the I.G. Far-Farben plant, to see if that should be destroyed, did nobody\nrecognize what these camps were? Did nobody see them?",
        "A: But who \u2014 who did \u2014 who did they make photo interpreters out \u2014 young people,\nsix week course. What the hell \u2014 what the hell did I know about Fischer-Tropsch\ncoal distill \u2014 distillation process? I didn\u2019t know anything about them. But I\u2014I-I\ngained interest in them. And whether I\u2019Il bite into anything, I \u2014 I won\u2019t let go.",
        "Q: Okay, I didn\u2019t understand that. I\u2019m saying aft \u2014 at the war, during the war itself,\nthere were other people who were taking these photographs. You weren\u2019t in \u2014 in\nthat part of it.",
        "A: Well, one thing \u2014 one thing historians didn\u2019t use fo \u2014 aerial photos.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And yet I find out that historians make excellent photo interpreters. I\u2019m the first\nguy \u2014 you see, let me just \u2014 let me explain. Intelligence was primarily a main\nNovember 13, 2014\ndomain. And the only time that you \u2014 the on \u2014 only time that you hired a woman\nwas to be a clerk in the 1960s and 50s.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Oka, I was getting real good folders of women that applied for a job with the\nCIA. And I said, why in the hell can\u2019t I use them? So I go up in the career board,\nand I\u2019d get flogged. Navy \u2014 old navy men, and oh, I don\u2019t want \u2014 I don\u2019t want to\nwork with a wo \u2014 oh God, you have to put up with her, you know, you have to\n[indecipherable] then you work, you train her, and then three years later she\u2019 ll \u2014\nshe\u2019ll leave and she\u2019ll get married. And then when they\u2019re \u2014 when they\u2019re in love\nyou can\u2019t handle them [indecipherable] you know. And so I started hiring them. I\ngot \u2014 I got backing by the exec, cause he had been a dean of men at Dartmouth and\nhe said, by God, we\u2019ll start hiring them. You know that 50 percent now are \u2014 are \u2014\nof the photo interpreters are women? Simply because we made \u2014 we made \u2014 we\nmade room for them. We had \u2014 we had enough intellect, I guess, that we \u2014 we \u2014 we\nwanted women to try. And not only women, not only \u2014 not only photo interpreters,\nthey became supervisors. But, you know, I told them, when you come in, damn it, I\ndon\u2019t want you to cry. You \u2014 y-you get \u2014 you get \u2014 you get \u2014 I \u2014I gotta go to career\nboard, I don\u2019t want to hear that stuff. Not only that, but don\u2019t ask for any \u2014 don\u2019t\nask for any credit, an-and don\u2019t take crap \u2014 crap from anybody.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But I want to go back to the wartime. So you\u2019re saying that people took\n\u2014 who took the aerial photographs in 1944, of Auschwitz didn\u2019t know what they\nwere looking at?",
        "A: No. No, I talked to two pilots. Nobody \u2014 said nobody told us. Nobody told us\nanything was there. One \u2014 one in South Africa, my \u2014 I think there\u2019s a letter in the\nfolder, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve forgotten his name. But then, they were flying out of\nFogia(ph). There were people flying out of those areas.",
        "Q: So in other words, they would take these aerial photographs, they would bring\nthem back \u2014",
        "A: Well, they would \u2014 let \u2014 well, let me mention another thing.",
        "Q: Okay.",

You lived in London, you had \u2014 you could eat good, you drank\ngood, you had the parties you had and so forth. You had th \u2014 and so the eighth air\nforce was kind of the organization. Now here was a second cousin down in \u2014 in\nFogia(ph), the 15\". And they were primarily you mi \u2014 might get some Italian food\nand maybe a bottle of wine, but you didn\u2019t have the life that you had 1n \u2014 in \u2014 in\nEngland. So when it came to bombing Auschwitz, it was \u2014 the English pre \u2014 would\n\u2014 was barely \u2014 they were hitting \u2014 being able to hit, but 1t was about the extremes.\nNovember 13, 2014\nBut the 15 had no problem at all hitting and re-conning th \u2014 Auschwitz. But they\ndidn\u2019t particularly care for the 15\"\". There was a snobbery among the air forces,\nbeca-because th-the real work \u2014",

        "A: But nobody had looked at those photographs. I checked that. Nobody had looked\nat the photograph, and nobody had \u2014 had sent any copies of those photographs to\nEngland.",
        "Q: Did the Brits have any of their own photographs of any of the camps?",

        "Q: And they didn\u2019t know what they were looking at either?\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: No, they knew about Dachau because Dachau wa \u2014 you know, that \u2014 that was\nsort of built up about \u2014 if you look at the photographs of Dachau, it looks more like\na prison that it does a \u2014",
        "Q: Concentration camp?",
        "A: I mean, it \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014 it \u2014 it looks like a\u2014 oh, a modified vacation plant, vacation\nhotel. You know [indecipherable] what I\u2019m talking about is small units.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Me \u2014 where \u2014 where all the other camps were made out of wood.",
        "Q: I keep going back to my question though, that with this aerial photography going\non, at the time, in 1944 and \u201945, nobody was looking at it, loo \u2014 ca \u2014 looking at\nwhat came back and said, aha, in addition to I.G. Farben, there\u2019s also the camp.",
        "A: Oh, more than that. The first thing that you do in photography is always look for\nthe transportation. What \u2014 how \u2014 who \u2014 who\u2019s there? What \u2014 what \u2014 what\u2019s\ntransportation. The biggest sin that World War II photographers tha \u2014 with all those\nboxcars, all those trains and boxcars, my God that should have \u2014 somebody should\nhave said what the hell are \u2014 what the hell are the \u2014 what the hell are they there for?\nNobody did.",
        "Q: And they didn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t think to?",

        "Q: I see.",
        "A: See, normally you work when you get a requirement. Somebody asks you to do\nsomething. But then it was the training too. They weren\u2019t \u2014 they weren\u2019t the \u2014 you\nknow, what \u2014 what can you expect from \u2014 from just a few weeks of training? And\nbasically the training was primarily on ships and \u2014 and things military.",
        "Q: And would this have been the very first war that there would have been aerial\nphotography?",
        "A: No. There was \u2014 wor \u2014 World War I",

        "Q: Uh-huh. Is there anything else that you\u2019d like to add to what you have explained\nto us today about how you got the photographs, how you \u2014 how you found them?",
        "A: Well, I think \u2014 I think \u2014 I think somebody ought to ca \u2014 what\u2019s Mauthausen?\nHave you got a photograph of that one?",

        "A: See, but I\u2014 I\u2019m sure that \u2014 I\u2019m sure that if you research, you have to back into\nthe problem.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I mean, I'd like to see a \u2014 an album of \u2014 of all these photographs put together.\nAnd then \u2014 then ti \u2014 for example, if you had a \u2014 a survivor of a \u2014 of Ebensee, I \u2014 I\ncan\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t find a \u2014 a \u2014 a\u2014 normally \u2014 normally at these places you have a\nplace that get \u2014 makes the food.

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: In other words, I always looked at sa \u2014 li-li-like \u2014 like Auschwitz as kind of an\nexample for me. You gotta see that \u2014 you gotta feed people, and you gotta \u2014 they\ngotta be \u2014 they gotta have places to [indecipherable]. For example \u2014 now I found\nthe \u2014 I found the ... what the hell, help me out there. By the \u2014 by the \u2014 by the \u2014 by\nthe shadow fall.",

See, not only that, but there\u2019s \u2014 there must have been a hospital or\nsomeplace to \u2014 to take sick. Which \u2014 which building is the hospital? In other words,\nsomebody that \u2014 that lived through \u2014 could help you \u2014 could help you, and you\nought to get them before they pass away, too.",
        "Q: I\u2014I-I fully agree. I fully agree.",
        "A: I'd like \u2014 Id like \u2014 I'd like to sit down with the guy that looks at Ebensee\ntogether. All I \u2014 all I heard about Ebensee, the people that \u2014 few people that I\u2019ve\nmet, is that \u2014 how harsh it was.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: How cold it was, and how bad it was.",
        "Q: How had this changed you, or changed the world that you moved in, p-prior to\nlooking and analyzing the Auschwitz photo and then meeting with Mr.\nBerenbaum?",
        "A: All right, there was one photograph of the wa \u2014 Russians women with a bunch of\nkids.",

Now, he came back, and I said, who have you worked on?\nHe\u2019s \u2014 he was in \u2014 he was in Afghanistan. So while he worked on American\nsoldiers, he worked on \u2014 on \u2014 on the \u2014 on the state guard troopers, he worked on\nItalians and Germans that were assigned to that area. He said, Grandpa, I even\nworked on the Taliban.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: He said, he had his arm shot. He said, I saved his arm. I said, you feel good\nabout it or bad about it? He said, I feel good about it. That was it. So I\u2014I-\u2014so-",

        "Q: And now at the end of our interview, so Ill start with Josh Blinder. What would\nyou like to ask?\nQ3: Do you know, I\u2019m going to ask you to look at her while I ask the questions,\ncause it\u2019s going to be as if she was asking.",
        "A: Ask what?",
        "Q: Okay, all right, he\u2019s going to ask, but you look at me, okay?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.\nQ2: Dino, this is kind of a hard one, but if you had to put a quantity on what you\nthink you\u2019re the most proud of for having done this, in looking at these photos, what\nNovember 13, 2014\ndo you think of this achievement \u2014 what \u2014 0-of this achievement, what do you think\nyou\u2019re the most proud of having done?",
        "A: When a-\u2014 when I was at Skokie, I was expecting \u2014 I was expecting the worst,\npeople crying. And meanwhile it was just the reverse. They were happy that I had \u2014\nI had proof that the Holocaust existed. That\u2019s \u2014 Ill never forget Skokie. And a\nfunny thing, I had my cousin with me.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: And he couldn\u2019t get over it either.",
        "Q: What it meant.",
        "A: What it meant to them.",
        "Q: Yeah. Becky?\nQ3: Okay, so I have a few more questions about the reaction to the release of the\nphotos. So part of it was \u2014",
        "Q: Come over here Becky, come over here.\nQ3: Sorry.",
        "Q: Okay, hang on a minute.",
        "A: She won\u2019t come near me now \u2014 now.\nQ3: I\u2019m not supposed to be on camera.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Before \u2014 before \u2014 before she \u2014 before she \u2014 she was \u2014 she couldn\u2019t \u2014 she couldn\u2019t\nleave me. Now she got it \u2014 now she\u2019s got a man, she said the hell with \u2014\nQ3: I\u2019m not supposed to be on camera, so I have to use \u2014\nQ2: Stand right in back of her.\nQ3: I have to use Ina\u2019s microphone. So you and I have talked about this before, but\nwhen \u2014 thank you \u2014 when the photos were released, there was the reaction of, this\nproves what we \u2014 this proves that this actually happened. And for a lot of people,\nespecially Auschwitz survivors, there really weren\u2019t a lot of photos of Auschwitz\ntaken during the war, so it really was proof that \u2014 in-incredible proof that people\ncould point to, it was all over the news. It also started a debate among historians,\nwhich you know, and you and I have talked about, and you\u2019ve written about it,\nabout whether or not Auschwitz, the crematoriums and gas chambers at Auschwitz\ncould have been bombed. And you and Ina have talked about the intelligence\naspects of that, how these photos weren\u2019t discovered until the 70s when you\ndiscovered them, and how at the time, the interpretation couldn\u2019t have happened.\nYou know, they didn\u2019t have the intelligence or the tools to analyze the photos, to be\nable to pin out what was the crematorium, and what was the gas chambers and do\nthose sorts of things. But Ina was surprised to hear that Auschwitz had been\nbombed, and so I wanted to \u2014 you to talk through kind of what happened when the\nNovember 13, 2014\nU.S. tried to bomb I.G. Farben, when the Auschwitz complex actually was\nbombed, and whether you think \u2014 and again, I know you\u2019ve written this, but I want\nyou to say it on camera, so we have you on camera saying it; what you think the \u2014\nsay, McCoy(ph) had said, yes, we should go ahead and do it. What would have\nhappened after that? Does that make sense?",
        "A: Yes.\nQ3: Is it a fair question.",
        "A: Yeah.\nQ3: Okay.",
        "A: Now I think \u2014 now, I was with an outfit that we had \u2014 we took pleasure in\npinpoint bombing. We \u2014 we knocked out bri \u2014 we had a record for knocking out\nbridges, we had \u2014 we \u2014 we hit the battleship and cruiser. Whatever they had\nsomething [indecipherable] they \u2014 we could hit it. And \u2014 and medium bombers,\nthey are much more accurate than the \u2014 than the heavies. And I think it could have\nbeen bombed by medium. In fact, I would have volunteered on that type of mission.\nYou could have moved B fif \u2014 B-25s into position and B-25s could have got them,\ncause it \u2014 now, how long would it take them though to \u2014 to reconstruct? I don\u2019t\nthink you can reconstruct one of those killing stations in say, six weeks. They \u2014\nsomebody said, well you can \u2014 oh, we can build them in six weeks. But they said,\nNovember 13, 2014\nwell, the one guy said oh yeah, well, we can\u2019t \u2014 we can\u2019t \u2014 we can\u2019t gas them, but\nwe ll \u2014 we\u2019ll u\u2014 we'll kill them with rifles. Well, the Germans had found out that\nkilling by \u2014 by rifles 1s \u2014 1s pretty hard on the people that are doing the killing, too.\nSo I \u2014 I \u2014 I think it \u2014 1f \u2014 if \u2014 if 1t \u2014 1f somebody said gets \u2014 get a \u2014 bomb it, I think\nthe medium L-2 bombers would do it, B-25s especially. And \u2014 and our outfit would\nhave been a good one to do it.\nQ3: Were \u2014 were medium bombers flying over Auschwitz at the time? Th \u2014 who\nwas doing the recon and the bombing of \u2014",
        "A: No, that was heavies.\nQ3: Okay.",
        "A: But you could move \u2014 you could move the \u2014 you see, we had taken \u2014 we had\nmoved into France by that time.",
        "Q: So, E.J. far \u2014 E.J. Farben \u2014 I.G. Farben was bombed. Is that correct?",
        "A: Well, let me tell you, when you release your bombs, normally you have\nsomething in mind. You want to \u2014 they call them linear. You la \u2014 you drop them so\nthat they \u2014 they\u2019re pinpoint bombing in a |-long area. Or you salvo, you want them\nall to go one time. Now, one of the problems that they have is that when the bombs\ncome out, when you \u2014 when you release the bombs and they hit \u2014 hit the airflow,\nthey have a tendency sometime to fishbed, or sometime even to tundle \u2014 tumble.\nNovember 13, 2014\nAnd the fins are very, very li \u2014 they\u2019re sheet \u2014 the sheet metal, they\u2019re not heavy. So\nthat I \u2014 I think that what happened, either bombs got hit and tumbled and one of \u2014\none or more \u2014 more had hit the \u2014 not \u2014 didn\u2019t hit the \u2014 what you want to hit, they hit\nthey ark \u2014 hit the barracks.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.\nQ3: Yeah, so we \u2014",
        "A: You\u2014 you want them to hit the \u2014",
        "Q: We inadvertently \u2014\nQ3: We inadvertently hit Birkenau.",
        "Q: I see. Okay.\nQ3: So that \u2014 so part of the debate has always been, why wasn\u2019t Auschwitz\nbombed, and that\u2019s the wrong question, because Auschwitz was bombed, just by\naccident.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Well, the thing about it though, my God, you got the \u2014 you got the stick of\nbombs right over the \u2014 right over the number one and number two killing\ncomplexes.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nNovember 13, 2014\nQ3: So \u2014 so the \u2014 the problem that I\u2019m hearing you say \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to put\nwords in your mouth, so make sure that you correct me, is we didn\u2019t have the\nintelligence \u2014 the \u2014 the photos were not interpreted properly at the time to give us\nthe intelligence needed \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.\nQ3: \u2014 to bomb the gas chambers and the crematorium, and we were using the wrong\nbombers. We would have had to put different planes in place to actually pinpoint hit",
        "A: But don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014\nQ3: Both of those things could have happened.",
        "A: Yeah, but just don\u2019t blame the photo interpreters.\nQ3: No, no, no, no \u2014",
        "A: Blame the fact that \u2014 blame the fact that you had people that had been at\nAuschwitz \u2014\nQ3: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 and were trying to tell people that \u2014 and \u2014 and were \u2014 were \u2014 you had a failure\nof intelligence \u2014\nQ3: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 hey, hey, what\u2019s \u2014 what the hell\u2019s going on?\nNovember 13, 2014\nQ3: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s collateral information that something \u2014 something is going on and we got\nsome source \u2014 not one source, but \u2014",
        "Q: Several.",
        "A: \u2014I\u2014I think probably if you add them up there was about 10 sources that had\nsaid that there was something going on.\nQ3: And because that report never got to the 15 \u2014",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: Not only.\nQ3: Not only.",
        "Q: Not only.\nQ3: There are lots of different \u2014",
        "Q: A direction would have had to come down, as you explained before.\nQ3: Right.",
        "Q: You said that, you know, when you analyze a photograph it\u2019s based on what\ninstructions you\u2019ve gotten as to what to look for. And if you haven\u2019t gotten\ninstructions to look for something, you won\u2019t look for it.",
        "A: Well, there was something about \u2014 see, you had the \u2014 the invasion was about\nready to come off, okay. So the idea was wh-where do we use our resources? And\nNovember 13, 2014\nthe \u2014 we use most of our resources on V-1s and V-2 sights. General Spotz(ph)\nwanted the \u2014 the synthetic fuel plants to be hit. So, you had so many photo\ninterpreters doing work, searching for V-1 and V-2 sights that \u2014 that they weren\u2019t\nlooking at these synthetic fuel plants.",
        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "A: But I \u2014I think the big \u2014 biggest sin though, my God, the \u2014 those \u2014 all those\nboxcars and they \u2014 nobody \u2014 nobody said what the hell are these \u2014 all these railcars,\nboxcars, especially during wartime? Cause boxcars are in short supply always in\nwartime, and not only that, but you see so many, gosh I don\u2019t know how many. I\nmean i \u2014 tha \u2014 there again, you can \u2014 you can measure those and count how many\nboxcars there are, but has anybody ever counted them?",
        "Q: Yeah.\nQ3: In those photos, I don\u2019t think so. I think people have said 40.",

        "Q: Yeah.\nQ3: \u2014 actually more.",

        "Q: Yeah.",

        "A: So, with my two dollar ata \u2014 light meter, I was setting the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the\ncameras, and we were getting beautiful results. And so he\u2019d call Brugi(ph) \u2014 he\ncalled me Brugi(ph), and he said Brugi(ph), we\u2019ve gotta fly. He was always \u2014 he\nwas \u2014 always wanted to make sure that we wouldn\u2019t bomb our own troops.",
        "A: So \u2014 but I wasn\u2019t getting cr-credit for our \u2014 for our missions, for our\nreconnaissance. I had yet to drop a bomb to get credit for \u2014 for to go home. So, first,\nit was only 25 bombs \u2014 runs and you could go home. And then during the invasion\nthey raised it to 50, and then they asked \u2014 asked for volunteers to fly more. And like\na damn fool I volunteered for more, and I \u2014 65\" mission we got shot up real bad.\nReally bad. And so I went to see the colonel and he said, what\u2019s the matter? And I\nsaid, well, I\u2014 I was a poor crewman. He said, what\u2019s the matter, and I said, well, I\ndidn\u2019t give a damn whether I lived or died today. I thought I was gonna get killed.\nHe said, how would you like to go to Rome? I said, I been there. He said, how\nwould you like to go to Cairo? I said, I don\u2019t care for that. He says, suppose I give\nyou a Jeep, and for two weeks, just do what the hell you want to. Just travel \u2014 travel\nCorsica. And I said no. And then he said, how would you like to go home? And so\nI came home. And then \u2014 now they wanted me to go to the Pacific.\nNovember 13, 2014",

        "A: Huh?",
        "A: No, they were me \u2014 they were prisoners.",
        "A: So I told one of them, Bartholomew, I \u2014 I told him, I said, well, I\u2014T?\u2019m-\u2014I\nwon\u2019t see you again, so I\u2019m saying goodbye. And he said, oh, if you ever get to \u2014 to\nthis town \u2014 he gave me a slip of paper \u2014 in Italy, he said, tell them I\u2019m alive. It so\nhappened it was Easter, and we weren\u2019t flying, and I found out the town was about\nfive miles away. So I started walking, and I hitched a ride, got into the town, and I \u2014\nso I went to \u2014 into the church, and I said, does anybody know this \u2014 this person?\nThey said, oh yes, he\u2019s \u2014 his parents. So they get the parents, and they \u2014 there\u2019s a\nmass said, and he called it a miracle. So the priest was saying a miracle had\nNovember 13, 2014\noccurred today, that I had told them that their son was alive. Miracoli(ph),\nmiracoli(ph), you know, miracle, miracle.

        "A: Well, the one thing that I photographed that our \u2014 our unit \u2014 well, let me explain.\nThe French fleet had been taken over by the Germans.",
        "A: And there was a fear that 1f we invaded, that they would come out and fight our\n\u2014 our navy. So for a full week we would go like \u2014 and this is [indecipherable] we\u2019d\ngo like we were going to bomb the \u2014 there was a battleship and a cruiser there. But\nthen we\u2019d just veer away. So we\u2019d tease them. And then one day \u2014 we didn\u2019t know\n\u2014 realize this, but at \u2014 every night we would look at what was being trundled to the\nair force, whether it was \u2014 what kind of bombs. So when we saw these long, slender\nNovember 13, 2014\nbombs, we knew that we were going after either a \u2014 the battleship, or \u2014 or a \u2014 a sub\n[indecipherable]",

        "A: So we got briefed and told that our target was the stra \u2014 the battleship\nStrasbourg, and the cruiser La Galissonni\u00e9re, and \u2014 and so we went in \u2014 we went\nin five waves. And the first and second got in, but the third and fourth really got s-\nsmattered. In fact, 26 out of the 52 planes had either wounded, or were \u2014 had \u2014 were\n\u2014 had been \u2014 either had wounded aboard, or the planes had been h-hurt.",
        "A: So we got it, and we got a presidential unit citation for that, that I\u2019m proud of.",
        "A: Well, what happened was, the Germans were \u2014 Germans still occupied Rome,\nand they would meet at a certain spot where the troops would gather for\ntransportation back to their base. And somebody threw a grenade and killed \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know it was, I think 30 or something like that, and they demanded ransom.\nNovember 13, 2014\nThey \u2014 but I\u2019ve forgotten that number, whether it was 10 to one or something like\nthat, but I remember it was a high number.",
        "A: No, in people. Th-They \u2014 the Germans wanted so many people to pay for this\ncrime.",
        "A: So they took them in the cave, and they \u2014 and they \u2014 was at random, but they \u2014\nthey machine-gunned them all, and then just closed the cave. And \u2014 and \u2014 and when\nwe \u2014 when we occupied Rome, it was opened. And \u2014 and I went \u2014 I was one that\nwas allowed to see the \u2014 but what I remember was a little girl. She had a white dress\non, but she had been hit, and there were spots on her dress of blood, like it was a\nfloral display.",
        "A: And they don\u2019t \u2014 they were \u2014 they were machine-gunned, and they either fell to\nthe right or left, or \u2014 or came over, and \u2014 and I never forgot the brutality of \u2014 of\nkilling that little girl.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: No, they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 no, they weren\u2019t. They just \u2014 they \u2014 they took them as\nprisoners.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And then I saw another sight that I\u2019Il never forget.",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know. It was the summer. I remember it was the summer of \u201944 \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 when they opened the caves.",
        "A: Well, the other one was, as the Germans were leaving \u2014 were leaving Rome, we\nwent ar \u2014 we went after them. We were bombing their \u2014 their \u2014 their convoys, we\nwere \u2014 we were really hitting them hard. And so when the \u2014 when the \u2014 when the\nwar \u2014 when the \u2014 when the war was still moving up, we went \u2014 we drove past these\nconvoys of dead soldiers. And I\u2019ll never forget the stench of \u2014 of burnt flesh. I can\nsmell it to this day.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Yeah. And \u2014 and there was just one truck, and one vehicle after another with \u2014\nwith soldiers that were \u2014 were burned to death, you know, from our bombing, and \u2014\nand then, one night, while we were bombing, we were bombing an airfield, and we\n\u2014 we came in at low level, and I remember we always had machine guns we were\nfiring. And there was a man running. And I remember I grabbed that \u2014 the machine\ngun just as tight as I could, and I was \u2014 I was gonna kill the bastard. And so he was\nrunning, and I don\u2019t know if we hit him, or he dove into a ditch. But when we\npulled off, I \u2014 I-\u2014 I clenching \u2014 I was still clenching my fists. And I said, what the\nhell are you doing? You know, I wa \u2014 I meant to kill him. I meant to kill him, and \u2014\nand that wasn\u2019t my nature. But I was \u2014 I was determined to kill him, and not \u2014 not\nonly kill him, but call him a bastard. And \u2014 and I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t made that way.",
        "A: Yeah. And then there was another thing that happened along that line. The\nGerman army was bringing supplies down from \u2014 from the bavar \u2014 I mean, from the\npass, and from \u2014 there was a little town called Udinay(ph) and there was a bunch of\nrail lines, and it was a \u2014 I remember it was May, and it was a beautiful Sunday. And\nso, 1t was \u2014 but we knew that the \u2014 the rail lines there merged, and there was a lot of\nboxcars full of ammunition. So we went after them. So, I was photographing that\nday, and we let go our bombs, and boy there were secondary and tertiary explosions\nNovember 13, 2014\nand it wasn\u2019t long there was just smoke was up \u2014 almost at our altitude. So, I called\nthe colonel, I said, let\u2019s go back and get it again. So we photographed it again, cause\nwe were lead, and we went back and photographed it again and bis \u2014 it was still\nexplosions all over the place. So when we got back to the squadron, I said, boy, we\nreally plastered those bastards today, or we \u2014 we got them today, and \u2014 and so the\nnext morning we had a briefing how many locomotives we had hit, and how many\nboxcars we had hit. And \u2014 and so you felt real good, and then they finally said yeah,\nbut 2,000 slave laborers were killed. They were in the \u2014 and that was another thing\nthat stuck with me, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s has always stuck with me, that here I thought\nsomething was re \u2014 oh, that\u2019s really performed a big deed, but somebody had paid\nfor it.",
        "A: Well, yeah, I know, but that \u2014 that\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s what comes round, you \u2014 like\nwhen you\u2019re \u2014 when you first go in you\u2019re looking for glory, you\u2019re looking for\nglamour.",
        "A: And you don\u2019t \u2014 sometimes you \u2014 you don\u2019t get it.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: No \u2014no. But I knew what was happening to the little \u2014 little children. And that\nwa \u2014 that \u2014 that is, they would gather at our camp just begging for \u2014 they would\ncome out with cans, and whatever scraps of food we had, they would give them.\nAnd so anyway, there was a \u2014 my best buddy was a guy named Red. And so we\nwould go in, and we would get more pancake \u2014 well, you either got pancakes, or\nyou got powdered eggs for breakfast. And so we would get pancakes, more than we\neat \u2014 could eat, and then put more \u2014 a little bit more syrup. And we\u2019d come out and\ngive them to \u2014 to the kids. And so there was one little boy had his arm \u2014 he didn\u2019t\nhave his hand, he just \u2014 and was always \u2014 always getting beat up by the other kids.\nSo Red said, well, let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s go help that little guy. So we took him down to the\nmachine shop, and we had an artificial arm made for him.",
        "A: But it was the clips, you know, basically a bunch of clips. And then the little boy\nwas using his as \u2014 as a weapon with the others. He was beating the hell out of the\nweapons. So Red and I said, here we formed a monster. But 1t was something, poor\nlittle kids, you know, just begging for food.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: That stuck with me all the time, too.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, we\u2019d seen that.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Well, we seen \u2014 we seen them on the roads a lot, with the \u2014 with the chur \u2014 with\nthe star.",

        "A: No, nothing.",

        "A: So we go up and we\u2019re given free reign of MGM. We were \u2014 we were watching\nJudy Garland, and \u2014 and Lou Costello, and all the movies, and then there was a\nlittle yellow \u2014 there was a little guy tossing a grenade, and he \u2014 he was a poor actor,\nbut he was the \u2014 trying hard, and it was Robert Mitchum.",
        "A: And we got \u2014 we got to meet all the \u2014 all these stars. And my date one night was\nJune Allyson.",

        "A: Well, yeah, what I was doing, I wa \u2014 I \u2014 I had \u2014 I was in a crash. We \u2014 we got\nshot up real bad and we crashed. And a can of ammunition hit me in the face and\nknocked out teeth and broke my nose and bloodied my face. And so I was having\nthe teeth work done at Santa Monica.",
        "A: And so \u2014 but Jeanette MacDonald, she was just a fine lady. Strawberry blonde.",

        "A: No, no, it w \u2014 w-we \u2014 we were \u2014 we were hitting a place called \u2014 it was a naval\nbase. Got worked over there. And we couldn\u2019t get our wheels down, and so we had\n\u2014 we had a choice, we could either parachute out or \u2014 or crash \u2014 crash land. And so\nI \u2014 we had faith in our pilot and so we said we\u2019d ride him down. And so, you\u2019re\nNovember 13, 2014\ncoming at about a hundred miles an hour and all of a sudden you hear the\nscreeching sounds of the metal. But it was such a jolt that the ammunition can came\noff and hit me in the face \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because I \u2014 I had taken the brace position. You take a brace position, you put\nyour hands behind your neck and pull your neck down. And this thing came down\nand hit me. It was about 50 pounds of ammunition hit me in the face.",
        "A: Oh, about \u2014 about a month.",

        "A: I\u2014 well, then I was reclassified.",
        "A: I was to go to Pacific, and I said now, what can I do to get trained? They said,\nwell, we need overseas navigators.",
        "A: I mean, over water navigators. So I said, well sign me up. So I was signed up.\nAnd Id finished basic and was in advanced when the war ended.\nNovember 13, 2014",

And so I was studying international\neconomics, and I had all kinds of offers of jobs, to go into banking, because the\nbanks were just being redone. I had Caterpillar tractor, I had banks in New York\nwanted me and \u2014 and so. But I was going with a lady that later became my wife.\nAnd I had offers to go to FBI, I had offers. But then there was \u2014 Ted Acheson said,\ngo down and see this organization, and it\u2019s being formed, and go down and see my\nbuddies down there. So I went down there and ha \u2014 they was these \u2014 forming the\nCIA.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: So I was put in charge of \u2014 I became an expert on Soviet industries. And I knew\nwhere all the industries were. And in 1940 \u2014 1954 \u2014",
        "A: 1948.",
        "A: It was called the CIG at that time.",

And I said, well,\nwhat am I gonna be doing? They said, well, we can\u2019t tell you. Course it was the\ndevelopment of the U-2. So I was made chief of information.",
        "A: Because I knew about the rush \u2014 where the Russian industries were.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Well, I took \u2014 I took courses in photo interpretation, I passed them easily\nbecause I knew it. But it \u2014 photo interpretation becomes, the more you\u2019re in it, the\nmore you learn.",

And so that kind\nof gets your attention. So I was put in charge of writing \u2014 making the briefing\nboards, and the notes that would go to Eisenhower.",
        "A: And so I \u2014I\u2014I got my \u2014 oh yeah, I \u2014 he \u2014 he said, you\u2019re going to get the same\nclearances that the boss has. I had 12 clearances.\nNovember 13, 2014",

        "A: Well, he was so knowledgeable, you \u2014 he had no \u2014 he knew about photography,\nand so the briefing boards, I had to look at the briefing boards, and I had to annotate\nanything that looked suspicious of any kind, whether it be a ground formation, or\nNovember 13, 2014\nsomething that been pretty innocuous. But he would \u2014 he would look at the briefing\nboard, and he\u2019d say, you know, what about this, what about that? Well, I would try\nto make sure that my boss had the answers, so I would write the notes that would go\nwith the briefing boards, two copies. One went to the president, one went to the\nCIA and the Department of Defense.",
        "A: Oh, first U-2.",
        "A: Then satellites, and then SR-71, and then combat reconnaissance.",
        "A: During Vietnam there was all kinds of photography. But I was also briefed in \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know if you know it or not, but we had planes that were flying supposedly\ncommercial flights, but hell, they had cameras in them.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, anybody.",
        "A: Fake \u2014 fake airplanes. Lot of dirty work. But the whole idea was to get pictures.\nWe had \u2014 we had Greeks, we had foreigners with \u2014 we equipped them with cameras\nand they\u2019d bring back photography.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, no, attaches photography, parade photography. No, they would pay \u2014\nthey\u2019d pay a foreign seaman, they\u2019d give him a camera. And they would go up \u2014\nclimb up the \u2014 the pole, and take pictures of \u2014 of Cairo e \u2014 ca \u2014 not Cairo,\nAlexandria, Egypt, all the ports and so forth, so we could see what was coming in\nand come \u2014 going out. Russia.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: You can bribe people. You know \u2014 you know what plane we could fly with\ncameras in it that \u2014 that was welcomed? The PX plane.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Well, the thing about it is we allowed foreigners to go into PX. So hell, they\nwould wait for the plane to come in, not realizing we were photographing the hell\nout of the country.",
        "A: Oh yeah. France, especially. France 1 \u2014",
        "A: France had a nuclear program going that they were keeping secret. South\nAfrica was another one.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Now, the first thing that we did \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the big question was the bomber gap. Did the Soviets have more planes than\nwe did?",
        "A: So we \u2014 we flew over \u2014 we flew five missions in 1956, and we could go to the\npresident, Eisenhower, we could say, Mr. President, there\u2019s no bomber gap. The\nrest of them don\u2019t have that many bombers.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Then the next thing was missiles. We could te \u2014 we could go to the president,\nsay Mr. President, there\u2019s no missile gap. And then we had the Cuban missile crisis.\nThen we had the Suez War. And then we had all these places \u2014 in eight years,\nEisenhower kept us out of war, and \u2014 because we were watching everything.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right after the war. They \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 IT heard about it.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t do anything. Now, what happened to me was, there was a program\non television called \u201cThe Holocaust.\u201d",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know. It \u2014 probably in the 70s sometime.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Maybe in \u2014 maybe in the 60s. I \u2014 I remember it was \u2014 it was \u2014 it was one of\nthose that went five or six nights.",
        "A: And then I wondered if by chance, when we were photographing the Auschwitz,\nthe \u2014 or the I.G. Farben, I knew that we were \u2014 during World War II we were\nflying over their synthetic fuel plants.",
        "A: So there was one at Auschwitz. We wondered \u2014 I wondered 1f by chance when\nwe were flying over that, did they see anything at the death camp, did we see the\ndeath camp. The first can of photography I put on the light table \u2014 now, keep in\nmind I\u2019m using micro-stereoscopes now, I\u2019m using fancy optics, and enlargements\nand everything else.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I knew that \u2014 I knew that there was World War II, or there was World\nWar II photography.",
        "A: At Venn(ph) Hill.",
        "A: Was in a special repository.",
        "A: In Virginia.",
        "A: No, it was air force.",
        "A: So I called for the photographs of the I.G. Farben plant.",
        "A: And so when I put them on, the first can of film I put on, I saw people being\nmarched to their death.",
        "A: So, I\u2014I- and I have the example here. So anyway, I went to the director, and I\nsaid, I\u2019ve got this. And I-I \u2014 I can develop it into a project. But see, this was the\ntime when we were having all the problems with Iran. And \u2014 and the ri\u2014 so I\u2014I\nNovember 13, 2014\nhad to be careful, because you know, I didn\u2019t want to be accused, what the hell you\ndoing looking at Holocaust pictures when the Iran is going down the tube,\nintelligence. So I\u2014I\u2014JI told him, I said, I have this photography. So he said he\nwanted to brief the president. So I made briefing boards, and he briefed the\npresident. And then the president \u2014 the per \u2014 key person there was Jody Powell.\nNow, I met a guy named Michael Berenbaum. Okay, now Michael, when he heard\nabout I had the photography, he called me and \u2014 and he was in a \u2014 down on either\nK, or one of those streets, and he had a bunch of artifacts that he was trying to \u2014 but\nit was Jodie Foster that said, hey look, this is \u2014",
        "A: Jody Powell was pre \u2014 was Carter\u2019s press agent. Was Jodie Foster said, this 1s\nthe kind of stuff that\u2019s around here, we\u2019re not gathering it up.",
        "A: Jody Powell, yeah.",
        "A: Jody Powell.",
        "A: Okay. [laughter] I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not that \u2014 that \u2014 what\u2019s the name of the\nguy that was old and transferred Jody Powell \u2014 Jodie Foster? Anyway, so I\ndeveloped this liking for \u2014 for Michael Berenbaum.",
        "A: And I said hell, I think there\u2019s more stuff available. He said, you\u2019re kidding. I\nsaid, no, there isn\u2019t. And he said, you mean that \u2014 you mean you got photography of\nAuschwitz and \u2014 and nobody knows about it? I said, that\u2019s true. He said, you\u2019re\nkidding. I said no, I\u2019m not kidding. So the president was briefed, Carter was\nbriefed, and he said he liked the idea. So \u2014 so \u2014 so I wrote \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. But at the same time I had to be careful because I was in charge of making\nsure that all the intelligence was flowing, briefing boards. So sometimes I would go\nin on weekends and \u2014 and do this work. Or, I\u2019d do this work whenever I was\nwaiting for work to come in.",
        "A: Yeah.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: And you know, strangely enough, about half of them had really been destroyed.",
        "A: Half of the missions had been destroyed. So I made sure, I told them, I said, put\nthe \u2014 put the stamp on that can and don\u2019t let it out, and so that \u2014 a stamp I put on\nthat can is still on it, I think.",
        "A: Yes. But they didn\u2019t look at it either. Nobody looked at tt.",
        "A: No, no, they were \u2014 the photography was taken for one purpose and one purpose\nalone, was to bomb the I.G. Farben plant.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, nobody had looked at any of them.",
        "A: Ebensee, all \u2014 all of the ones you saw today, most of them that \u2014 nobody had\never looked at the photography. So I started looking at them on my own time primar\n\u2014 well, let me explain.",
        "A: I was a senior officer.",
        "A: So I get word that hey, we got a mission over the Middle East. So wer \u2014 all right,\nnow, where is it gonna land? Says, well, it\u2019s gonna land at Wiesbaden. Okay, now\nwho\u2019s processing it? Well, they\u2019re gonna process it at Wiesbaden. All right, now\nwhen \u2014 where does it go from there? It\u2019s going to the [indecipherable] the Azores\nand it\u2019s going to Dover. Well, at that \u2014 meantime, I would be calling people in \u2014 to\ncome in, but I had \u2014 I had a maybe six hour time that I had on my own, waiting to\ndo work. So that\u2019s when I would do the work on the \u2014 on the \u2014 so I was told to \u2014 so\nI was given the go ahead to produce the \u2014 the document, and at the same time, there\nwas a guy named Seymour Bolton. He wanted me to talk to \u2014 to Jimmy Carter.",
        "A: And \u2014 and then Jody Powell, the same thing. Say, we got to get the boss really\ngoing. So then, I was supposed to meet with Elie Wiesel. And Elie Wiesel though,\nwould \u2014 had \u2014 he had kind of \u2014 when I talked to him, they asked him to be a leader\nNovember 13, 2014\nin the \u2014 in the \u2014 for a Holocaust Museum. And Elie Wiesel said he\u2019d never raised\nmoney, he didn\u2019t know how to raise money. And \u2014 but anyway, so I had Elie\nWiesel for an hour by myself, and what I\u2019Il never forget, Elie Wiesel hated brutality\nof any kind. And at that time the Infantata(ph) was going on and he didn\u2019t like the\nIsraelis for beating up on people. But he told me about the hardships, the loss of his\nfather, but more often \u2014 I mean, more times he\u2019d come back to his \u2014 the la \u2014 his loss\nof his sister. I think she was nine years old, and \u2014 and she walking sh \u2014 when she\nand her mother were separated from them, sh-she held onto her mother, but she\nlooked back at him. That\u2019s all he remembered about this sister\u2019s death. And he \u2014 he\nalways pra \u2014 you know, her \u2014 her innocence, he proclaimed her innocent. Well, now\n\u2014now, getting back to Michael Berenbaum. He was telling me that the tremendous\nf\u2014not fight, but opposition, both sides, the liberals and the \u2014 and the \u2014 and the \u2014\nand the conservative Jews. Now, especially the \u2014 the conservative Jews wanted\nanother Yad Vashem.",
        "A: Museum, yeah.",
        "A: Well \u2014 and then \u2014 but he wanted it, and that \u2014 he felt that it would be doing more\ngood by being an educational one. So he was emphasizing the emph \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014\nNovember 13, 2014\nthe \u2014 the liberal view really, but the educational view. But at the same time, about\nthis time, when I found the photographs, my boss, the director of \u2014 Stanfield\nTurner, he was a friend of \u2014 of \u2014 he was a classmate of Carter. He told me, he said\nlook, he said, I\u2019d like for you to get \u2014 get to brief these people in Skokie. So I said,\nwell, I have relatives in Highland Park, and he said that yeah, he said, well, I'll\narrange it. Get in touch with Michael Berenbaum. So I got in touch with Michael\nBerenbaum. And I was afraid to \u2014 to gi-give this briefing, and he said there would\nabout 70 - 80 survivors of \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, the Illinois branch.",
        "A: Because I had briefed several temples, and when I showed the pictures of people\nbeing marched to their death, invariably somebody would \u2014 excuse me \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 somebody would break down crying. So I thought, oh boy, this is going to be a\ndisaster. And strangely enough, when I got there, I don\u2019t know why, but su \u2014 a sort\nof a feeling came over me that hey, these people are easy to get \u2014 going to be good\nto handle. So I said, now I\u2019m going to show you what I have, what I know, but I\nNovember 13, 2014\nwant people to come up and point out things that I miss. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I want you to\nparticipate with me here. And boy it took fire.",
        "A: Oh, it was just wonderful. They were \u2014 they were really in it. And \u2014",
        "A: Well, they pointed out things. They said, now that\u2019s \u2014 the boxcars \u2014 the boxcars\nwere here, and \u2014 and then at night, what they \u2014 they were ex \u2014 telling this \u2014 telling\nme experiences at the \u2014 at the camps at night, what they did at night and how they\ngot along. And then who died, and how they died. But \u2014 but then there was a little \u2014\nthere was a little break and there was coffee time. And one of the fellows came up,\nand I said look, I said, how in the hell did you \u2014 you survive the cold, because that\u2019s\ne \u2014 Auschwitz is equivalent to the Canadian \u2014 U.S. border. And he said, well that\nwas our secret. And I said, can you share it with me? And he said yes, he could. I\nsay, well what \u2014 what was it? He said, well, he said, you know, the cement bags\nused to come in. The bags were made out of paper and tar and paper to keep them\ndry. And he said, we made ourselves underwear. Made themselves thermal\nunderwear. Then a lady came up, and I said, I guess you strived to get first in line.\nShe said no \u2014\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: For food.",
        "A: Cause they \u2014 they had \u2014 I say, well, did you get in line at the beginning or at the\nend? If you went in the beginning, you got sure. She said no, about the middle. I\nsaid, well, why the middle? She said, because if you\u2019re at the beginning you go \u2014\nonly got water. But at the \u2014 but the bin \u2014 beginning \u2014 I mean, the middle to the end,\nyou got some \u2014 some potato peelings.",
        "A: They got \u2014 they got food \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 more nutrition as food.",
        "A: That\u2019s it, right there. That\u2019s what made them \u2014 that\u2019s what th \u2014 not a person\ncried, because they said, you\u2019re proving the fact that the Holocaust existed. That\nwas \u2014 that was \u2014 that was a \u2014 that was a whole \u2014 whole \u2014 their whole feeling, was\nNovember 13, 2014\nthat I had done something. Now, when I got back \u2014 when I got back I talked to Dr.\nBerenbaum. I said, hey, look. Gosh almighty, the stories they were telling me, they\ngotta get \u2014 gotta get something done with them. So Berenbaum said, I\u2019ll \u2014 Dino, I\nagree with you, he said, but we don\u2019t have any money. So then it later was Steven\nSpielberg put the money. That\u2019s \u2014 but it started with \u2014 wi \u2014 I mean, he \u2014 he knew\nabout it, but it was emphasized by my \u2014 my story, and \u2014 and \u2014 but th-they \u2014 they\nhad to show me their \u2014 their \u2014 their tattoos. The men were, for the most part were, I\nsay about five foot five, they\u2019d been starved in there. And the women were even,\nsome of them were \u2014",
        "A: But one woman came up to me and she said, you know \u2014 you know why I\nwanted to become American? I said no. She said well, she said she was liberated,\nand she said she were \u2014 they were filthy dirty. So he said, th-they put up a shower\nunit, but she said they put curtains around it. I mean, a tent \u2014 the tents around it.\nAnd she said, I had my first bath. And she said, I knew then I wanted to be an\nAmerican. She said, they didn\u2019t bother us. She said they \u2014 they let us shower, and\nshe said they didn\u2019t bother \u2014 and stories like that. And then they \u2014 then they start\ntelling me about some of the little sneaky things they would do. That was \u2014 that was\nit \u2014 that was interesting too.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: How they falsified, they \u2014 they \u2014 especially the \u2014 the woman that were hired \u2014\nnot hired, but the women that made records.",
        "A: They fal \u2014 falsifying records.",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 the personnel were \u2014 on personnel primarily, I guess.",
        "A: But anyway, th-th-there \u2014 there were so many stories coming at me, just one\nright after the other. They were so wanted \u2014 they so wanted to share them with me.",
        "A: No, but you see, my best friend was mar \u2014 was Cohen, a boy named Cohen.\nAnd he\u2019s a classmate and he \u2014 he still comes to all of our funerals, our family\nfunerals. I can\u2019t re \u2014 I can\u2019t think of his first name. But anyway, I have \u2014 I had\nJewish friends. Simply because the Jewish friends \u2014 made friends because they\nwere on the out, and Italian in a German \u2014 German high school was on the out. I\nmean \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: So we made friends.",
        "A: No, most of them had \u2014 lost relatives. But let me mention now, now all of a\nsudden, I get \u2014 I get some \u2014 I\u2019m called down to the National Archives to brief the\npress.",
        "A: So word goes out that \u2014 that Dino knows a little bit about the Holocaust.\nImmediately I get calls also, how much did the Jews pay you? What did the Zionists\n\u2014 how did the Zionists \u2014 then there was a guy up in \u2014 there was a doctor up in \u2014 up\nin, I think Rhode Island that was giving me a hard time.",
        "A: Oh yeah. That I had \u2014 and then there was a \u2014 there was a guy up in Canada that\n\u2014 that I finally told him, I \u2014 he told me \u2014 he said that I had \u2014 had the zipper effect on\nthe photograph, I had faked photographs. And you know what it is? It was people\nstanding in line and they were \u2014 there was a gap, and the sun was si \u2014 shining, so it\nlooked like a zipper. And I said, you dumb bastard, when you learn something more\nNovember 13, 2014\nabout photo interpretation, you call me again, but don\u2019t call me. But this guy up in\nCanada has constantly ti \u2014 tried to find fault. He\u2019s a professor. But then also, I got\ninvolved with the ta \u2014 the Englishman that sued \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, that said that the Holocaust didn\u2019t exist, and the \u2014 the lady down in\nuniversity, and I \u2014 so I told her, I \u2014 I\u2014 you know, I told her fo \u2014 the originals are\nstill available, so she could prove her point with the originals, and she did. But then",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Yeah, but I \u2014 yeah but \u2014 yeah but I \u2014 on that scrapbook that I gave my\nfriend here, well, you see, there\u2019s a lot of complimentary notes 1n it too, I don\u2019t\nknow what \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. But also, I got called by the district attorney of Chicago three times tha \u2014\nwhether I\u2019d testify against people that were at Auschwitz that claimed that they\ndidn\u2019t see anything, that they were in the tower but they didn\u2019t see anything. And so\nNovember 13, 2014\nI \u2014I said, okay, sure, Pll testify against them. And when he told them who the\nexpert was, why they pulled away. They went back. So it\u2019s been a \u2014 been a lot of\ngood things, but there\u2019s still people don\u2019t believe that the Holocaust existed.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, so \u2014 yeah \u2014",
        "A: So \u2014 so that one picture of people being marched to their death has done more\ngood \u2014 and strangely enough, that was the first one. Now, something interesting too.\nI looked at Ebensee. Ebensee, the first troops that \u2014 that \u2014 that freed them, was\ntroops from my father\u2019s old a-army outfit.",
        "A: The 80\" \u2014 80\" division. Isn\u2019t that something?",
        "A: So anyway, all of this is tied in, and so \u2014 so when \u2014 when \u2014 when my friend first\n\u2014 she\u2019ll beg you for anything.",
        "A: She\u2019s \u2014\nNovember 13, 2014\nQ3: He\u2019s talking about me.",
        "A: First \u2014 first she sa \u2014 first I gave her pictures, that wasn\u2019t enough. Then she saw\nmy scrapbooks, then she wanted my scrapbook.",
        "A: Well, yeah. And you know, the thing that \u2014 the thing that convinced me to give\nall this stuff to you; I looked \u2014 I \u2014 I Googled these ca \u2014 these camps, and there\u2019s not\nmany photographs on them. There\u2019s no photographs, there\u2019s no [indecipherable].\nSo, where there\u2019s photographs, use the photographs. Not only that, but the\ncombination of the photograph and the sketches.",
        "A: Well, let me mention. I\u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I think I briefed about probably a half a dozen\ntemples.",
        "A: And one guy came up to me and he said he was from Ebensee, he had been at\nEbensee. And he told me, he said, you know what the punishment was? I said no.\nNovember 13, 2014\nHe said, they\u2019d take you out in that \u2014 that square, and they\u2019d spray you with water,\nand you\u2019d \u2014 you\u2019d freeze to death.

So you and I have talked about this before, but\nwhen \u2014 thank you \u2014 when the photos were released, there was the reaction of, this\nproves what we \u2014 this proves that this actually happened. And for a lot of people,\nespecially Auschwitz survivors, there really weren\u2019t a lot of photos of Auschwitz\ntaken during the war, so it really was proof that \u2014 in-incredible proof that people\ncould point to, it was all over the news. It also started a debate among historians,\nwhich you know, and you and I have talked about, and you\u2019ve written about it,\nabout whether or not Auschwitz, the crematoriums and gas chambers at Auschwitz\ncould have been bombed. And you and Ina have talked about the intelligence\naspects of that, how these photos weren\u2019t discovered until the 70s when you\ndiscovered them, and how at the time, the interpretation couldn\u2019t have happened.\nYou know, they didn\u2019t have the intelligence or the tools to analyze the photos, to be\nable to pin out what was the crematorium, and what was the gas chambers and do\nthose sorts of things. But Ina was surprised to hear that Auschwitz had been\nbombed, and so I wanted to \u2014 you to talk through kind of what happened when the\nNovember 13, 2014\nU.S. tried to bomb I.G. Farben, when the Auschwitz complex actually was\nbombed, and whether you think \u2014 and again, I know you\u2019ve written this, but I want\nyou to say it on camera, so we have you on camera saying it; what you think the \u2014\nsay, McCoy(ph) had said, yes, we should go ahead and do it. What would have\nhappened after that? Does that make sense?",
        "A: Yes.\nQ3: Is it a fair question.",
        "A: Yeah.\nQ3: Okay.",
        "A: Now I think \u2014 now, I was with an outfit that we had \u2014 we took pleasure in\npinpoint bombing. We \u2014 we knocked out bri \u2014 we had a record for knocking out\nbridges, we had \u2014 we \u2014 we hit the battleship and cruiser. Whatever they had\nsomething [indecipherable] they \u2014 we could hit it. And \u2014 and medium bombers,\nthey are much more accurate than the \u2014 than the heavies. And I think it could have\nbeen bombed by medium. In fact, I would have volunteered on that type of mission.\nYou could have moved B fif \u2014 B-25s into position and B-25s could have got them,\ncause it \u2014 now, how long would it take them though to \u2014 to reconstruct? I don\u2019t\nthink you can reconstruct one of those killing stations in say, six weeks. They \u2014\nsomebody said, well you can \u2014 oh, we can build them in six weeks. But they said,\nNovember 13, 2014\nwell, the one guy said oh yeah, well, we can\u2019t \u2014 we can\u2019t \u2014 we can\u2019t gas them, but\nwe ll \u2014 we\u2019ll u\u2014 we'll kill them with rifles. Well, the Germans had found out that\nkilling by \u2014 by rifles 1s \u2014 1s pretty hard on the people that are doing the killing, too.\nSo I \u2014 I \u2014 I think it \u2014 1f \u2014 if \u2014 if 1t \u2014 1f somebody said gets \u2014 get a \u2014 bomb it, I think\nthe medium L-2 bombers would do it, B-25s especially. And \u2014 and our outfit would\nhave been a good one to do it.\nQ3: Were \u2014 were medium bombers flying over Auschwitz at the time? Th \u2014 who\nwas doing the recon and the bombing of \u2014",
        "A: No, that was heavies.\nQ3: Okay.",
        "A: But you could move \u2014 you could move the \u2014 you see, we had taken \u2014 we had\nmoved into France by that time.",
        "A: Well, let me tell you, when you release your bombs, normally you have\nsomething in mind. You want to \u2014 they call them linear. You la \u2014 you drop them so\nthat they \u2014 they\u2019re pinpoint bombing in a |-long area. Or you salvo, you want them\nall to go one time. Now, one of the problems that they have is that when the bombs\ncome out, when you \u2014 when you release the bombs and they hit \u2014 hit the airflow,\nthey have a tendency sometime to fishbed, or sometime even to tundle \u2014 tumble.\nNovember 13, 2014\nAnd the fins are very, very li \u2014 they\u2019re sheet \u2014 the sheet metal, they\u2019re not heavy. So\nthat I \u2014 I think that what happened, either bombs got hit and tumbled and one of \u2014\none or more \u2014 more had hit the \u2014 not \u2014 didn\u2019t hit the \u2014 what you want to hit, they hit\nthey ark \u2014 hit the barracks.",
        "A: You\u2014 you want them to hit the \u2014",
        "A: Well, the thing about it though, my God, you got the \u2014 you got the stick of\nbombs right over the \u2014 right over the number one and number two killing\ncomplexes.\nNovember 13, 2014\nQ3: So \u2014 so the \u2014 the problem that I\u2019m hearing you say \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to put\nwords in your mouth, so make sure that you correct me, is we didn\u2019t have the\nintelligence \u2014 the \u2014 the photos were not interpreted properly at the time to give us\nthe intelligence needed \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.\nQ3: \u2014 to bomb the gas chambers and the crematorium, and we were using the wrong\nbombers. We would have had to put different planes in place to actually pinpoint hit",
        "A: But don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014\nQ3: Both of those things could have happened.",
        "A: Yeah, but just don\u2019t blame the photo interpreters.\nQ3: No, no, no, no \u2014",
        "A: Blame the fact that \u2014 blame the fact that you had people that had been at\nAuschwitz \u2014\nQ3: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 and were trying to tell people that \u2014 and \u2014 and were \u2014 were \u2014 you had a failure\nof intelligence \u2014\nQ3: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 hey, hey, what\u2019s \u2014 what the hell\u2019s going on?\nNovember 13, 2014\nQ3: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s collateral information that something \u2014 something is going on and we got\nsome source \u2014 not one source, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I\u2014I think probably if you add them up there was about 10 sources that had\nsaid that there was something going on.\nQ3: And because that report never got to the 15 \u2014",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: Well, there was something about \u2014 see, you had the \u2014 the invasion was about\nready to come off, okay. So the idea was wh-where do we use our resources? And\nNovember 13, 2014\nthe \u2014 we use most of our resources on V-1s and V-2 sights. General Spotz(ph)\nwanted the \u2014 the synthetic fuel plants to be hit. So, you had so many photo\ninterpreters doing work, searching for V-1 and V-2 sights that \u2014 that they weren\u2019t\nlooking at these synthetic fuel plants.",
        "A: But I \u2014I think the big \u2014 biggest sin though, my God, the \u2014 those \u2014 all those\nboxcars and they \u2014 nobody \u2014 nobody said what the hell are these \u2014 all these railcars,\nboxcars, especially during wartime? Cause boxcars are in short supply always in\nwartime, and not only that, but you see so many, gosh I don\u2019t know how many. I\nmean i \u2014 tha \u2014 there again, you can \u2014 you can measure those and count how many\nboxcars there are, but has anybody ever counted them?",
        "A: Huh?\nQ3: I think people \u2014 the one that we have at the museum, I think it has about 40\nboxcars in it. The one that we have in the big mural.\nNovember 13, 2014",
        "A: I think that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Well, you could do it, you could do it, you could measure it \u2014\nQ3: Yeah, you could do it.",
        "A: \u2014 measure the \u2014 measure the size and then divide that by the size of a boxcar,\nyou know.",
        "A: In-Incidentally too, you have to be a little careful there too, because in some\ncases \u2014 did you see that there\u2019s some \u2014 some vehicles next to the boxcars? In other\nwords, those are probably buses taking the people from the boxcars to the main \u2014\nQ3: Yeah, the Red Cross out \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.\nQ3: \u2014 ambulances, yeah.\nNovember 13, 2014\nQ3: No.",
