        "Q: Could you please tell us your name and where you were born?",
        "A: My name is Leo Bretholz. Do I have to spell that? I usually do have to. And I was born in\nVienna, Austria.",
        "Q: In what year?",
        "A: 1921.",
        "Q: Tell us about the family which you grew up in.",
        "A: Our family was a normal, or what you might call a \u201cnormal family.\u201d My father was a tailor.\nThey were originally from Poland. My parents were -- came to Austria right after the first\nWorld War, married in Austria, and there were three children in the family. There would\nhave been a fourth, but that child, a boy, died six weeks after birth. I was the oldest. My\nsister was a year and a half younger, and the other one, born in 1928, was seven years\nyounger. A normal family, as I said, with schools and activities, fun -- although some of that\nwas disrupted by the death of my father in 1930. I was nine years old, the oldest at the time\nof the three children. And, my mother, a young widow at 35, never remarried. My father was\n39. And it sort of made me a father image, young as I was, to my children -- to my sisters --\nbecause my mother had to go to work and support the young family. But that was all\nbearable and we coped as best we could. We do not want to forget that in those years it was\nstill, if not depression, but very close to just, just post-depression.",
        "Q: Tell us about that.",
        "A: And these were hard times. Just as here in America in the middle \u201830s, latter \u201830s, we had to\nmake with -- make ends meet with what was available to us. And income -- my mother was\na, as I said, a widow who had to come up with, with the support of the family, and there were\nJewish organizations who helped out in that respect. And the real, the real tragedy began\nthen in 1938 with the annexation of Austria. Where that family structure, that family entity\nas in So many hundreds and thousands and millions of cases, that family entity overnight was\ndestroyed.",
        "Q: Tell us about -- before you begin with 1938, tell me about a Jewish child growing up in\nVienna as a Jew. Were you aware of being a Jew, and what did that mean as a child?",
        "A: Vienna and Austria had a history of antisemitic activities and antisemitic attitudes. When we\ngrew up in Austria, as Jews, we were always aware of the fact that we were Jewish. It so\nhappens that I lived in a district in Vienna where there were more Jews than in other\ndistricts.\nIt was the 20th district, and the second district had more Jews than the 20th, and a few other\ndistricts had -- but the majority of the areas were non-Jewish or very few Jews and\nantisemitism was almost a part of daily life. It's not that we thought a lot about it, because it\njust became part of life. If you, if you, if you live with something everyday, then it becomes\npart of you and you cope with it, if it didn't become too violent. But from time to time, there\nwere denigrations. Sometime we were spit at. Sometime we were singled out for a particular\nrough treatments in schools, the Easter and Christmas seasons particularly. When I think\nback to those days, to me they represent a certain trauma because we, we were Set apart.\nThere was Easter dealing with a religious connotation of Christ and the resurrection which\nautomatically brings back the killing of Christ, and that was the Jewish misdeed. And at\nChristmas time it was -- again we, we couldn't, we couldn't be part of a, of a festive mood\neven if we wanted to. Oh, there were many times when we did participate with neighbors in\ntrimming a tree or sharing 1n, in the Christmas cookies and that sort of thing, but that was all\nsurface. As children, we did things like this because we were part of a, of a, of a greater\ncommunity where there were non-Jewish children and we, we related to them. But the\nexcesses took place at certain times for certain reasons and especially during the depression\nyears. I was then in my early young years, but I do remember that often could we hear that\nall these economic problems -- and even the first World War -- it was all the fault of the\nJews. So we were being maligned and singled out and we didn't like it, but nevertheless we\nasserted ourselves in some way because when, when we went on outings with the Hebrew\nschools, we, we sometime carried the Jewish blue and white flag and we were taunted for\nthat by people who were looking at us. But 1t was a segment in history that does not reflect\ntoo well on, on the Austrian attitude towards Jews, and when we go later into \u201838, it 1s very\neasily perceptible. You can touch it. You can feel it. You could see it, that as soon as the\nAustrian Anschluss\u2019 took place, Austria in the next five, six weeks, or perhaps several\nmonths, the Jews in Austria underwent much more hardship in those few weeks or months\nthan the Jews of Germany did in the previous five years from \u201833 to \u201838. It lent itself -- the\nclimate in Austria lent itself more to antisemitic excesses.",
        "Q: Give us examples. It's 1938, you have described a really dramatic change in your feelings.\nWhat happened? What happened to Leo Bretholz?",
        "A: Seeing that some of my uncles had been arrested and many of our friends and neighbors had\nbeen arrested, my mother actually urged me to think of leaving as soon as I possibly could --\n' Term used to described the incorporation of Austria in the German Reich on March 11,\n1938.\nleaving Vienna. I had already left school. And an aunt of mine had left for Luxembourg right\nafter the Anschluss, and we planned for me to join that aunt and her husband, my uncle, in\nLuxembourg as soon as I would be able to -- as soon as arrangements could be made. It was\nmy mother who prevailed upon me to leave because she said that for boys and for men, it\nwill be very bad, as we can see. People were arrested every day and within days or the most\na few weeks, ashes were sent back of these people to their, to their relatives. Now whether\nthey were these peoples ashes or not, nobody could ever find out. But they received a\ncontainer with ashes, describing them as the ashes of the deceased who was caught trying to\nescape and shot because shooting was a justification for, for catching someone who tried to\nescape, killing someone, or that he had contracted a disease, a pneumonia. But there were\nthese, these explanations given which no one hardly even believed because some of the\npeople who were freed from camps periodically brought back other horror stories, so we\nknow that. My mother was very much bent on sending me away, and frankly, it 1s constantly\na source of guilt for me, to know that she had sent me away and they couldn't do it. But then\nwhen I consulted with psychiatrist, because I didn't want to have to live with feelings such as\nthese, he confirmed to me that, \u201cWould your mother be able to speak today, she would still\nsay...she was glad she did it.\u201d So, to begin with, she was actually instrumental in getting me\nout and saving my life. She was a good woman. My mother was what you might call in, in\nHebrew, it's described as \u201c\u201cEshet Khayil,\u201d\u201d -- woman of valor. She did the best she could\nunder the circumstances. I am breaking down because...she never had a chance in life... She\nand my sisters and 55 others of my family never had a chance in life.",
        "Q: What did she do?",
        "A: She was a widow and had to struggle to support the family and always helped poor people,\npeople that were less well-off than we or less fortunate. Always helped somebody. There\nwas this poor painter around the corner from us. When the apartment needed painting, she\ncalled him. He didn't even do a good job, but he needs the job. And when it was finished, the\npainting wasn't -- the painted room was sort of streaky, but she had given Mr. Fried a job\nbecause he needed it for his family, you see. But, I got to get myself together to make this\nthing.",
        "Q: Let's pull it back. Pull it back. Your mother...",
        "A: She urged me to leave, and I did leave.",
        "Q: Where did you go?",
        "A: I took a train from Vienna, Frankfurt, Koblenz, to the west of Germany and Trier, the ancient\ntown of Trier. By arrangement with a committee in Luxembourg; it was called the Ezra\n* Woman of valor (Hebrew).\nCommittee.",
        "Q: Who were the Ezra Committee?",
        "A: The Ezra was an aid committee, almost like a HIAS,\u201d perhaps. Aid to refugees that came\nfrom Germany and Austria to Luxembourg, provide some shelter, provide food, kitchen, and\nhelp these people who could not stay in Luxembourg unless they had regularized, temporary\ndocuments. Somebody came with a passport and a, and a, and a visa could do that. Others\nthat fled and came illegally, could not. And the Ezra committee was such a committee. And a\nMr. Becker who was the smuggler that smuggled me across from Trier into Luxembourg,\nwas in the employ of Ezra. In a way because later when I went to Belgium, he was also the\none that smuggled us into Belgium, but I am jumping ahead here. But we were -- I went to\nthe border town of Trier, and on the 31st of October, Mr. Becker picked me up in Trier and\nsmuggled me across the border. Actually he took me to the river, the Sauer River and asked\nme cross and then meet him at the other side of the Sauer. And during the night from\nOctober 31st to November the first, after it had been raining for four or five days in western\nGermany -- these are the rainy periods there -- I crossed into Luxembourg. He had asked me\nto put a pair of dry socks into my coat pocket so that when I came across and once I had\ncrossed, I would put these dry socks on, which at the point was not even possible because I\ndidn't have dry socks in my pocket after I had crossed the river. When he told me I was to\ncross that river, I asked him would I -- no, he asked me do I know how to swim. I said, \"Yes,\nI know how to swim.\" I said, \"Would it be necessary, you think?\" because he told me I\nwould wade across. But no way could I wade across that river after four days of rain because\nthat river carried a lot of torrential waters with debris, branches, mud, all kind of things. That\nriver springs in the Ardenne Mountains and comes down. It's a, it's really a tributary of the\nMoselle, a small river which under normal circumstances is a creek, a small stream. I went\nthere later in years with, with my family to get to that same area, and people were just\nwaiting there ankle deep, knee deep in that particular... But I crossed, and the first step I took\ninto the river, I was up to my knees and the second step up to my chest, and then here go the\ndry socks in my pocket, and it wasn't a concern of mine. My concern was to get across. And\nI did! And on the other side, Mr. Becker was waiting to take me into Luxembourg, and my\naunt was waiting there, and I had crossed into safety. Or at the moment, relative safety,\nbecause three days later, I was arrested in Luxembourg. The police came into this cafe where\nI was sitting and having breakfast just a couple of days after I had crossed. Actually, my coat\nwas still wet and not even dried yet, and they asked for my papers and I didn't have them, so\nthey arrested me and took me to jail, and I spent the night in jail in the Luxembourg jail -- by\nthe way, a very clean facility. And the next morning, they interrogated me. How did I come\nover? I said, \"I crossed the river. The river Sauer.\" \"Who brought you over?\" I said, \"TI just\ncrossed.\" \"And how did you get into Luxembourg.\" \"T just walked into Luxembourg.\" I\n* Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.\nwasn't going to say, \"Mr. Becker brought me over.\" And, well, it is my choice. I have two\nchoices. I can pick a place where I want to be taken to out of Luxembourg, either Belgium or\nFrance or back to Germany. So the choice was very simple. I said, \"Well, I have an aunt in\nParis. Maybe I can make my way to Paris.\" So they decided, yes, take me to the border, to\nthis Luxembourg-French border.\nThere is a little town called Thionville-les-Bains. It is like a thermal spa. And they took me\nthere and they -- the next morning -- and they -- commuter train that went to the border, just\nabout a half an hour or 40 minute ride. And I crossed into France. But earlier before we went\n-- before we took that train, at the railroad station, when they went to the ticket to, to, to\nshow that to the ticket window that day, were transporting me, whatever, they needed to\nhave transportation. My uncle had found out that next day I will be taken to the border,\nappeared at the railroad station and he wore a cap. And he was standing on the side, and I\nnoticed him and he noticed me, and he did this to his cap, the visor of the cap: he turned it\naround. There is an expression in Yiddish which translates \u201c\u201cTurn the visor around,\u201d which to\nme meant, \u201cIf you can come back, come back.\u201d And when they had taken me to the border\nand I crossed, they indicated to me that the other end of the border, just a few hundred yards\ninside France, there is a Jewish camp, they said. That's all they told me. And they will\nprobably be able help me. But when I told them earlier, \"How do you want me to manage\ngoing into France by myself? Can you --\u201d They said, \"Well, you just told us that you\nmanaged to swim a river and come into Luxembourg. Now if you could make it across a\nriver, you will make it across dry land, we know.\" They were sort of patronizing me but also\nvery nice to me. They were not in any way vicious. They were just doing their job to get me\nout of there. And I was glad they didn't -- that I wasn't sent back to Germany.\nAs I crossed into France, I went to that camp and it was a preparatory camp, hakh\u2019sharah,\u201d\nwhere, where Jewish young people were preparing for aleeyalr to Palestine. I got into this\narea and somebody at the gate actually stopped me, wanted to know who I am, and I said, \"I\nam a Jewish fellow, just escaped from Germany. The Luxembourg people told me --\nLuxembourg authorities told me that you might be able to help me....\u201d \u201cWell, they do that\nperiodically just to make you feel that when you get across the border, you will be all right.\u201d\n\u201cThere will be no problem so that they should be off the hook. But actually as many as we\nget here periodically, we do get some. We always have to tell them that the French\nauthorities tolerate us here. We have only temporary permits to live in France, and if we are\nbeing in any way compromised to give you shelter, to help you further your, your travel in\nFrance, they will dissolve this camp, so we can't do it.\u201d Being that far away from Paris and\nnot having money on me, I thought of my uncle's turning the visor around and waited until\n* Special training for youth preparing to settle in Israel.\n\u00b0 Immigration to Israel (Hebrew).\nnightfall to cross back into Luxembourg and made my way back to Luxembourg city during\nthe night. The last leg of that trip was in early morning catching a farmer with bales of hay or\nwhatever he was carrying on his wagon to get me to the city line of Luxembourg. And from\nthere I found my way to the address of my aunt. An hour later I showed -- a couple of hours\nlater I showed up at the apartment where she lived. I rapped on the door and my uncle stood\nthere and my aunt was sick in bed from, from aggravation that she had brought me there and\nnow I was arrested again. I was a kid of 17 years old. She -- that aunt lives today in\nBaltimore. She is in her 80s. She is my father's, my father's youngest sister. And as soon as I\nopened the door, my uncle said, turning to her, \"I told you he'll be back.\" So, then they\nprevailed through the Ezra Committee to have me stay with a family in Luxembourg where\nabout a half or dozen or more people were also staying waiting for further disposition of their\nsituation. And I stayed there from the night of the second, third of November to the ninth --\nsix days. And the night of the ninth to the 10th of November, exactly Kristallnacht night, Mr.\nBecker took six or seven of us into Belgium, smuggled us into Belgium, into Brussels. And it\nwas during that night that we saw the strange phenomenum looking to the east as we traveled\nin the car of skies that had changed their color. It was the night sky, but we could see\nreflections almost some eerie looking reflections of reddish-purplish coloration and it was\nonly the next morning 1n Brussels that we found out that Kristallnacht had happened in\nGermany where hundreds of synagogues and businesses and homes had been set afire and,\nof course, Luxembourg being in this tristate area, Belgtum/Luxembourg/France, we were\nvery close to the border. And chances are the flames that we saw reflecting were those that\nhappened in Trier or Koblenz or other border, border, localities that were evidently\ndestroyed in that night of horror which many considered the beginning of the end of the\nEuropean Jews -- Judaism, you know.",
        "Q: What happened? You are now in Belgium. What did you do?",
        "A: The next day after we had contacted the Jewish committee in Brussels, in Brussels, Belgium,\nthey gave us transportation to go to Antwerp. We took that train which 1s a train that goes\nevery 20 minutes; a electric train from Brussels to Antwerpen. Within an hour, we were in\nAntwerp, again going to the Aid Committee who were registering us, giving us food\ncoupons, and trying to help us regularize our situation as refugees from Germany to\nBelgium. I met an uncle of mine there who had left Vienna., my mother's brother, distant\nrelatives which came from the same town as my mother, which we found out about. And\nfrom November '38 to May 1940, I spent 18 months in Belgium, which were pleasant\nmonths with distant relatives and friends, constantly under the pressure of not being sent --\navoiding to be sent to a camp because they also had camps for these refugees. Somebody\nworking in that committee, also a Viennese fellow who worked there in, in the office helping\nout with paperwork made sure that when the time came to select people for the camps that I\nwas not being considered for it because they tried to get me into a school, to register in a\nschool, and I did. And having registered in that Flemish school, I became authorized to stay\nwith a temporary ID card which I have here with me, too, as a memento. And periodically\nwe knew that temporary permit to stay. It was a school which, in Dutch -- Flemish -- was\ncalled \"Openbaar Beroep School voor J ongens,\u201d\u201d which means \"Public Trade School for\nBoys.\" And I took a course in electrotechnical, studies, you know, was a trade school. Took\nalso languages and I learned Flemish almost, almost to perfection. I had good marks in the\nFlemish language and as a young man you learn faster, and I had a facility for languages\nanyway. So that's why I was in this trade school. With my distant relatives in 1939, I went\nfor a week's vacation to the ocean. All along I got letters from my mother and sisters that\nthey were coping, that things were at the normal rate as normal can be considered, and I\nalways had intended to bring them over, but I didn't have the money to do it, because you\nhad to pay a smuggler. And they themselves were not really urging me, my mother and\nsisters. Because they -- the mood was that \u201cHow long can this last?\u201d or this sort of thing.\nThere was constantly that hope against hope. How much can it last? Although when my\nuncle brought his wife and daughter and son over to Belgium, he had to pay an amount,\nwhatever it was, to the smuggler. I asked him why it wasn't possible to bring my mother also\n-- at least suggest. So he said, you know, they had to leave on quietly. Nobody could know\nabout it. The fewer people knew about it, the better 1t was, and again the money aspect was\nsomething that we didn't even discuss because that sort of becomes something of a very\ndelicate situation. But my mother and sisters did not come and actually, really didn't urge me\nto do something for them to come. They felt it'll, it'll work itself out. Then in '42, we found\nout differently. When I was in Belgium then, then, of course, in 1939, the War broke out. So\nafter 1939, September 1939, there was no longer any question of anybody leaving from\nAustria. By that time even they had wanted to...had they wanted to leave, there would be no\nproblem, no way to do it. That would be a problem, you see, would have been because the\nwar was on. The Germans were fortifying the borders and Maginot Line in the south of\nFrance and the Siegfried Line further to the north. There was no possibility any longer after\n'39 for anybody to come across, although some tried and did. But it wasn't as open and free\nas up to the beginning of the war. And, of course, in 1940, in May 1940, on the 10th of May,\nthe Germans attacked the lowlands, Holland.",
        "Q: Where were you and what where you doing when the Germans attacked ?",
        "A: That is the day that I will never have to guess where I was, because I was in a hospital. I had\na hernia and I had decided to see a doctor and rather to go on with a hernia bothering --\nhaving from time to time -- why not do it? And on Thursday night, May the ninth, I went to\nthe hospital at Antwerpen in a suburb of Antwerpen called Berchen and the same evening\nthey prepared me for the operation of next day, meaning cleaning my body, shaving, that sort\nof thing. And operation was to take place next day, about seven in the morning. Between\n5:00 and 6:00, Friday the 10\", fire bombs were flown over Antwerpen. Visibly. We could\nactually see them. In fact one of those bombs dropped right into the yard, the courtyard of\nthat hospital. And the order came for those who were ambulant to pick up their documents in\n\u00b0 Public Trade School for Boys (Flemish).\nthe office and leave the hospital. And I left the hospital, never been operated on. I made my\nway, not where I lived in my apartment that was in the middle of the town, but in that suburb\nwhere my distant relative lived, and I made my way to their apartment. And that time I\nalready found out that there were notifications, proclamations that all aliens of enemy alien\norigin have to register with the Belgium authorities. Although I had Polish nationality due to\nthe fact that my parents were never naturalized in Vienna, I as a Viennese-born person could\nnot be an Austrian until I would have been 21 years old with the first military service. It's not\nlike in America. When you are born America, you are an American. And so I was, to all\nintent and purposes, also a Polish citizen which showed on my ID, and I went and registered\nand in good faith, hoping that they will see \u201cPolish citizen.\u201d I couldn't have done differently\nanyway because they would have caught me or perhaps I could have fled. But in good faith,\nI did it. Like many hundreds did. I am, number one, I am of Polish nationality. And the Poles\nare Allies because Poland had been attacked, and besides that, even born in Austria or others\nin Germany, we were the first victims of this Nazi regime. We are here now. We came here\nlooking for shelter, for refuge, as people who ran away from that system. So we're certainly\nnot enemies of you. We are enemies of that system. But in bureaucracy, that doesn't count.\nWhen you are born on enemy in enemy territory, that makes you an enemy alien, I guess.\nAnd a train took us to southern France. After we were arrested, we were told to bring a\nchange of clothes, a toothbrush, a blanket, and food for a day. And they transported us to the\nsouth of France. Ironically enough, Germans were with us. German Nazis were with us in\nthat train. They also had to register, but to them that was just a formality because eventually\nthey knew they would be exchanged for Belgium nationals because that goes in international\nrelations as a normal procedure. But we as Jews, number one, we were not exchangeable,\nand number two, we wouldn't have wanted to be exchanged. Were we arrested, number one,\nwe would have wanted to, and number two, we were not exchangeable, whichever. For us,\nthat didn't count.",
        "Q: Belgians have deported you as an enemy alien. You are going on a train to the south of\nFrance. Where did you go?",
        "A: To a camp called Saint-Cyprien. The ironic, more irony, that when we got out of that train, in\nthe camp on the way to Saint-Cyprien where we stopped for one night near Agde\nsomewhere. When we looked at our train on the outside, the facing of the train, in white\npaint, it was marked 5th Column -- \"Cinquieme Colonne.\u201d\u2019 So they transported us as Fifth\nColumn people. No wonder that when we traversed the French countryside from north to\nsouth that in those small stations where we did, where we made periodic stops, that people\nwere doing this to us [making \u201cslitting throat\u201d gesture]. They thought we were, you know,\nGermans. We wound up in Saint-Cyprien, a camp in the Department of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales\nin France, right near the Spanish border near a major town, a larger town called Perpignan.\n\u2019 Fifth Column (French).",
        "Q: Tell me about Saint-Cyprien.",
        "A: Saint-Cyprien was a -- an established camp. That was -- this was 1940, so that camp had\nbeen established somewhere between '36 and '38, mainly holding Spanish refugees that had\ncome into France due to the Civil War in Spain. People had left Spain; the duress of the war\n-- fled into France and there at Saint-Cyprien at the time, was nothing but beach. So these\nrefuges from Spain had come there, and established a camp facility. First they had tents, then\nthey built barracks with undulated metal roofs and later more barracks were built, but the\nfloors in the barracks were not floors. They were sand. It was just the uprights were there and\nthe roof. But in the barracks, it was just the sand of the, of the beach. And there, straw was\nput on there and we were lying on that sand on that straw in that barrack -- shelter. As we\nwalked through the sand, to go to the latrine, or to go to the kitchen to pick up the rations, we\nwalked sometime on bones. A jaw bone here, a tail bone there, a skull here there of domestic\nanimals, donkeys and horses and goats and dogs. The Spaniards had brought these animals\nwith them. They were farmers. They were people who had a little livestock. They brought\nthem with them, and in the process they died or they killed them even for food. And this, this\nwas the scene there. The ocean periodically -- the tide carried the waters up to the barracks\nand sometimes right into the barracks, the ones that were closest to the shore. A beautiful\nsight it was scenically because there was the Mediterranean and there in the not too distant\nfuture were the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Mountains jutting right into the Mediterranean, so scenically this\nwas a beautiful place. And if any of us had thought to escape, that wasn't possible because at\nthe end of the beach where the beach meets the ocean, you had barbed wires. And patrol\nboats were cruising so if somebody would go through the barbed wire and try to swim, they\nwould be detected. The better way to escape would have been trying to escape from the\ncamp, and then by foot make it into Spain. Be this as it may, we got there in May of 1940.\nSometime in July or early August, and I couldn't pinpoint that, dysentery developed in --\nbroke out in that camp, and typhoid fever. There were a handful of latrines. There was a\nmale section camp and a female section camp. There was a handful of latrines, and with the\ncondition under which we labored, it was a constant line to these latrines. And they were\nelevated on stilts because the ocean would come tn -- the seat of the latrine would be\ncovered, so it was on stilts. So you walked up those stilts and there was that one door, that\nswinging door like, and you would go up there and relieve yourself and as soon as you were\nsitting down somebody rapped on the door, so you had to get out and get in line again. And\nthere was no paper. There was no tissue paper. There was not even a newspaper. So what we\nused was straw. It's awful to bring back these things, but these are all segments of\ndehumanization that people go through and you somehow cope with it because you live and\nyou hope you will survive. What happened later, of course, these situations were almost\nbearable, sometimes even comical. And I escaped from that camp with another fellow.",
        "Q: Tell us about it.",
        "A: Some people that we knew in Antwerp who came from Antwerp as Belgian citizens with a\nstream of refugees into the area, this is the general southern area from Toulouse to the\nPyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. One of our friends by the name of Oesterreicher had finally arrived in Toulouse\nand he had inquired with the authorities where some of the people that were transported into\nFrance were taken. And they told him, the foremost reception for these camps, they called\nthem \u201cCentre d'Accueil,\u201d\u00ae -- Center of -- Reception Center. Like they had a red carpet out for\nus, or something like that.. These euphemisms, they have their way of creeping into a\nlanguage and then that's what it is. And they found out that we were in this camp, and\nOesterreicher wrote to us. We could receive mail there. Communication between people who\nhad left in the train and others that left by car on their own volition because they want to get\naway from the war zone. So, sort of, families through Red Cross and through authorities\nfound each other. That's communication. Slowly as it went, it still helped.\nAnd Oesterreicher found out that we, that we were taken to this camp, and he came to the\ncamp and asked the commandatur, the office to issue a visiting permit so that he can visit his\nfriend. And they called me that there is a friend here visiting. And I got dressed, went to the\nvisiting area, and he told me then, \"Why don't you go back and get your shoes?\u201d I was\nbarefoot. \u201cGet your shoes, get your clothes because I think you can get out of here.\" I say,\n\"How do you do it?\" He said, \"I see that these guards here are not very watchful. They are\nhalf asleep. They walk around. They talk. They talk to the internees. They exchange\ncigarettes. You can give them cigarettes and you can give them chocolates and they will be,\nwill be looking away, maybe.\u201d So I went back to the camp and took my things and told my\nuncle who was there with me from Belgium and his son, a cousin, that I am leaving with a\nfriend. They were not amenable to fleeing. They said, \u201cOh, we will.\u2019 because they had, they\nhad -- he had his wife still in Belgium, the other one had his wife still in Belgium, so they\nwere not going to go anywhere where, where, where their wives may have, have no\nknowledge where they are. In other words, you are there, and you hope that these authorities\nwill take care of it. As you saw others were exchanged, you hoped that you perhaps would\nbe let out and -- but with the situation that it was, that there was dysentery and all this illness.\nThe guards themselves were not crazy about guarding these people because they're not\nimmune to that. I mean, dysentery can spread across a barbed wire too, you see. So they\nrelaxed their watchfulness. And my friend was right! When we walked out, we walked\nacross the barbed wire that was surrounding the compound where the, where the office was.\nHe walked out the regular door, the regular gate, because he had his permit to visit me, and I\ndid not. But as we walked there, we saw at the bottom that one of those barbed wires was\nactually lifted off. So he said, \"If you can climb through that underneath and cross behind the\nbarrack, they won't even see you. Join me in front.\" And that's exactly what I did. That was\nexactly what I did. And we walked into the little town of Perpignan. We bought a box of\npeach preserves and a slice of Roquefort cheese, and I learned how good preserves can taste\non a fully ripened cheese. That is a great combination. You should try that sometime. And he\nbrought some money for tickets, my friend did, to go to Toulouse, to travel to Toulouse. And\nhe knew where these people that I had been with in Belgtum. My distant relatives had finally\nalso come from Belgium into France, and they located themselves into a little town called\n\u00ae Reception center (French).\nBagn\u00e9res-de-Luchon in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. I got a ticket from Toulouse to Bagneres-de-Luchon\nand joined up with them. And with them, I spent most of the time in France living in the\nsame places there, then we were taken to forced residence, and then we were taken to\nanother forced residence, but they were always involved, these people. Their family name\nwas Frajermauer.",
        "Q: Spell it.",
        "A: F-R-A-J-E-R-M-A-U-E-R. Frajermauer. The German word frajermauer means freemason.\nBut that's sort of a derivative of that.",
        "Q: And your friend's name?",
        "A: Oesterreicher.",
        "Q: Will you spell that?",
        "A: O-E-S-T-E-R-R-E-I-C-H-E-R, which translated means \"Austrian.\"",
        "Q: So you are there in this town. You are in the town and what happened to you? You lived\nthere for awhile?",
        "A: I lived in Bagn\u00e9res-de-Luchon from 1940 to 1941, to the beginning of '41, when we were\nasked to leave Luchon beginning of '41, to join other Jews who had been confined in that\nassigned residence of Bagn\u00e9res-de-Bigorre. Bagn\u00e9res -- B-A-G-N-E-R-E-S D-E. That's \"\nBagneres,\" one word; \"de\" is second word; the third word, \"Bigorre\" -- B-I-G-O-R-R-E.",
        "Q: Now how did the authorities know that you were part of the party? You said you were taken\nto this assigned community. But you had walked out of camp illegally. How did anyone\nknow you were there?",
        "A: When we...when I came to Luchon, I had to regularize my situation in Luchon with the\nauthorities there. To them, I told them that I just came from Belgium. They didn't know that I\ncame -- there was, in those days, there is a Hebrew word right in Genesis, and it speaks about\ntohoo va-vohoo.\u2019 This was tohoo va-vohoo. You know the expression?",
        "Q: Yes.\n\u201d Chaos, disorder (Hebrew).",
        "A: It was utter turmoil. So when I came to Bagneres-de-Luchon, these relatives, distant relatives\nwho had already established themselves with, with the temporary permit of residence took\nme to the, to the city hall. It was a police station. Well, this 1s a relative of us who just came\nfrom Belgium. He walked a lot and he -- that's why he's so late, and he stayed somewhere on\nthe way. And I got these papers. I became -- I had to have these papers because of ration\ncards. I couldn't get ration cards unless I had this regularization of the situation involved tn it.\nAnd I became just another one of the refugees in Luchon. You see these were not all Jewish\nrefugees, although the majority were. But there were Frenchmen and Belgians there who just\nran away from the war zone and finally wound up somewhere in the south of France because\nthe south of France was then considered probably the furtherest and safest part. And then\nwhen the -- by the way, in the fall of that year we were also asked to sign up for work if we\nwanted to volunteer to do harvest, wine harvest, and we did that. Came back to Bagneres-de-\nLuchon, there we got a Laisser-passer\u2019\u2019 for that, a safe conduct that we could do that. The\nauthorities wanted us to help the wine harvest. Why? Because we were the refugees that\ncould fill in the labor force. Their men had been taken to the army. Their French men were in\n-- had been inducted into the army since 1939. So they needed agricultural help and that's\nwhat we did. We came back to Bagneres-de-Luchon. We were paid in, in food. We were not\npaid in money, but we got eggs and chickens and wine and cheese and butter to take back\nwith us, which were commodities that were probably better than money.",
        "Q: What was it like for a Jew in Bagneres-de-Luchon?",
        "A: As acommunity of, of Jews, we, we, we were a support system of each other, supporting of\neach other. The majority had come from northern France and Belgium, and the majority of\npeople knew each other. Families, friends had fled together. Some of them came by car.\nVery few, but some of them did come by car, brought even dogs with them. And it was\nsomewhat regularized. Bagneres-de-Luchon, the name indicating a thermal spa, had a\npavilion like those places do have and for the Jewish holidays, the Jews got together and had\nservices. One of the Cantors by the name of Kreistein, and you may remember why I\nremember his name. It so happens he is from Vienna and in the district where I lived. I once\nsang with his choir as a boy. And Cantor Kreistein, a very diminutive man, and I say very,\nbecause you can be five foot six, that makes you five foot five diminutive, but he was\nprobably was like close to five foot, but the voice of an angel, a very high pitched soprano\nvoice. Kreistein was leading the congregation there, and we had services. But shortly\nthereafter, after the services, then came wintertime, and we spent the winter in Luchon which\nis heavy winters. There's snow in these mountains. Right after that, after that in early 41, we\nreceived notification that we will have to move to Bagne\u00e9res-de-Bigorre, giving us safe\nconduct to go to Bagn\u00e9res, we had two weeks to do it: go to Bagneres, look for lodging, look\nfor a place to live, and then make arrangements to transfer to that locale. Mr. Frajermauer,\nthe father, he and one of his brothers went there, looked for a place, and found a nice place,\n'\u201d \u00abA dmit bearer\u201d (French).\nright at the border of the Adour River, and the place was called Villa Susanne. Villa\nSusanne. It was available. People come there on vacation and rent places for vacation during\nthe summer. Well, the owner of Villa Susanne was very glad to rent that, that facility out in\nJanuary or February for a, for an unlimited time almost because we didn't know how long we\nwere going to be there. But 1t wasn't just renting for a month or two months. We did, we did\nmove, took our belongs, drove by, we rented a camion, a truck, and the whole family,\nFrajermauer and me including. I was included -- and that's not good to say \u201cMe included.\u201d\nAnd we went to Bagneres-de-Bigorre and had a very -- some of the things I can really smile\nbecause they evoke more pleasant memories. It was just we moved from one town to\nanother. In fact we moved from a small town, more confined and less accessible, to a town\nthat was a little freer in access. That was 1941.",
        "Q: Let's hold it night there. We need to make a tape change.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape 1\n'' Truck (French).\nTape #2",
        "Q: Pick up now please. You are in Bagneres-de-Bigorre. Tell us what happened?",
        "A: Bagne\u00e9res-de-Bigorre, from 1941 to 1942 was a little bit of a, a spot of light, as I recall the\nwhole period. Because we, although we were registering, under the law, under the new\nVichy laws, we, we moved freely within, within the confines. We went to the movie theatre.\nWe took excursions into the mountains. I remember some mornings with the weather being\nright and nice and refreshing in the mountains. We got up early, five o'clock, and by six\no'clock, we were up on a slope and picked blueberries that we brought back and made jams\nand, and, fruit juices out of and we used them and we ate them. We went out and picked fruit\nand, and, and we raised rabbits in that Villa Suzanne. Food was hard to come by because we\nhad ration cards. Periodically, we would have to stand in line because they were rationing\neverything, even tripes, even liver, even marrow bones. You had to give a ticket for a\nmarrow bone, but then you forego, a marrow bone was something with which you could do,\nmake a good soup, but you may have to forego five ounces of meat which may not have the\nsame impact on your, on your, on your, what you're preparing for, for dinner, you see. You\nhave to trade one with the -- against the other. It was a, a fairly regulated type of life, other\nthan having to go to the authorities and register periodically under the Jewish laws.",
        "Q: You registered with the Vichy French?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What kind of police presence was there? What kind of Vichy presence was there?",
        "A: In that town, there was the police station, the police department, the police chief, the police\nin France -- or what you might call the gendarmes. The gendarmes is like state police. They\nare an arm of the government. They do what has to be done to keep law and order. But there\nwas another arm. That was the political arm. The Vichy arm. That was called the \u201cMilice,\u201d\u201d\nthe Militia. They wore their special uniforms, the black uniforms. The police wore their\npolice uniforms. And they were out there to go along with the Vichy government law bent\non pleasing and collaborating with the Germans. This was the treacherous element. The\npresence of the Milice in Bigorre, Bagn\u00e9res-de-Bigorre, was minute. They knew they had a\ngroup of Jewish people there, maybe a thousand, fifteen hundred. They couldn't go anywhere\nwithout a Laisser-passer permit from the police. Therefore, the con game was on. We felt\ncomfortable. We could go to a movie theatre if we wanted to. We could go to a restaurant if\nwe wanted to. We could circulate. We could buy newspapers; and if we had to go to Tarbes,\nBigorre, which was the Prefecture -- that was the seat of the Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, that\n'* Soldiery of the police militia (French).\n'\u00b0 Militia (French).\nDepartment Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, we would get to regularize something or two, or ask for\nwhatever, paper, have to travel to a consulate somewhere.\nWe got these permits, these Laisser-passer, and it was really a game of psychology that was\nplayed constantly to make the people feel as comfortable, as safe, to ease their mind as to\nwhat the future might bring in, in more drastic measures, and like all the other population,\nthe native indigent population of Bagn\u00e9res, we stood in line with them for, for meat and food\nand, and anything else, clothing even. There was, was no difference.",
        "Q: How did you eat? You wore a star?",
        "A: Not there.",
        "Q: Not there.",
        "A: The first time I wore a star was in Drancy later.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And 'Juif'* was never worn in the Vichy area. Only in the occupied area north of the\nDemarcation Line.",
        "Q: When did it no longer become safe in Bagneres?",
        "A: In -- at the end of 1941, just before the end of 1941. Sometime in the fall, we were told that\nwe would have to make preparations towards moving to another assigned residence and that\nwas Cauterets--C-A-U-T-E-R-E-T-S. Also in the same Department, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Hautes-\nPyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. It so happens that at the time in 1941, during the summer and the early fall, I had\nreceived my papers from the United States, affidavit, an affidavit to come to the United\nStates.",
        "Q: How?",
        "A: My aunt had sent me those papers into Vichy, France. I had actually received them earlier\nalready in the beginning, but , but 1t took a while to process papers before you could come to\nthe United States. I was on a waiting quota. And it was sometime in the fall -- no, it was\nactually around the time of Pearl Harbor that I was supposed to get my visa.\n14\nJew (French).",
        "Q: Your aunt arranged all this?",
        "A: Yeah, in, in, in, my aunt from Baltimore. She had already earlier brought an uncle, two\nuncles and two aunts, a brother and sister here with their respective mates. But when I went\nto the consulate, that was on that day of Pearl Harbor. There was no more processing of\ndocuments. So my affidavit to come to the United States fell by the wayside. It expired. So\nthat later after the war, after I had survived, I got fresh papers. But in Bagne\u00e9res, we were\nnotified that we would have to move to Cauterets. And we moved to Cauterets sometime\nafter the first of the year early in '42, probably in the springtime of '42. Again, the two men\nwent there ahead of time and picked a place for us to live. And that place was called La\nPergola. And also the little house, they name the houses in Europe. You know that.\nCall them one thing or another. A name or a tree. The Lindenhouse (ph) or something like\nthat. When we went to Cauterets, we, at that point, frankly, we felt confined. For the first\ntime since Luchon and Bagneres, Cauterets too was a thermal spot. A lot of, about 1500\ninhabitants during the year, but during the summer season, it, it could rise to about maybe\n10,000. Thermal spa. There were about a thousand or 1500 of us sent into that town into\nforced residence. It was called residence assignee. We called it \"R\u00e9sidence Forc\u00e9e.\u201d\"\u201d Even\nfor those people who do not speak French, I think \u201cAssign\u00e9e\u201d\u2019\u00b0 speaks for itself. Well, again\nwe tried to make the best of life. And we did excursions into the mountains to pass the time,\nand we gathered and listened to the radio. Of course, by that time some of the listening of the\nRadio, Radio London was prohibited, but we still heard it. Bumm, bumm, bummm, You\nfamiliar with that? The first bars of the Fifth Symphony. \"Ici Radio Londres.\" This is the\nFree French. Near the Spanish border. Hardly a mile or two from the Spanish border. When\nwe went into a little excursion in the morning, again recognize let's go up in the mountain,\nmake a little picnic or that sort of thing. This was all to pass the time as pleasantly as we\ncould, because if you were sitting there worrying about when will the Milice come and when\nwill things change, you could really fall into such doldrums and such despair and depression\nthat you wouldn't even be able to think straight anymore. And life is life while it's going on.\nThere's just, there's just not enough impetus to, to, to make you think of the most dire\ncircumstances, because you have a mountain surrounding you and you have friends with you\nand, and you wake up in the morning and you hope for the next day. But there's not that\nimmediate threat hanging over you. So you make the best of life and you say \u201cHopefully,\nthis will end soon.\u201d Radio London gave us a little hope -- a note from here, from there would\nfilter through that the resistance 1s starting to, to, to jell you know. And it was not until the\nfall, something in September, that the Mayor of that town sent the word out to us, the Jews,\nthat within a day or two, they expect a raid by the Milice and the Gestapo.\n'\u00b0 Forced Residence (French).\n' Assigned (French).\n'\u2019 Here is Radio London (French).",
        "Q: Okay, let's pick it up. The mayor, tell us about the mayor.",
        "A: We never met the mayor. But what he did at the time was a great thing. He notified us and\nleft it up to us to do what, he wasn't going to say, \u201cI am going to put a train at your disposal\nand send you all out of here or trucks\u201d or something. Do what you can. I just want you to\nknow that this place is no longer safe for you. A handful of us took to the mountains, 1n fact,\nand we stayed a couple of days and couple of nights up in the mountains. Periodically\nsending someone down. Once I went down, then somebody else, to find out what's going on.\nThe first few hours nothing had changed in town and the people were still there, although\nvery apprehensive. By that time, the mood had drastically changed. The parents had to\nconsole their kids. They had to tell them, \u201c\u201cWe may leave.\u201d They started packing. Some of us,\nas I said, took to the mountains, a handful.",
        "Q: The rest stayed?",
        "A: Stayed! Two days later when finally the messenger that we had sent out came back and said,\n\"It's finished. They were there. Most people are gone.\" That's when we came back from the\nmountains. In fact, the message was that when I knew they were going down to the\nmountains, \"Go over the to Frajermauers and see if they are still there.\" Low and behold, the\nFrajermauers were still there. They had Belgian documentations. Those who apatrides, '*\nmeans stateless, Polish, German, Austrian, were taken. Those who had French, Belgian, and\nLuxembourg nationality were left. Another psychological ploy to tell them, \"You are safe.\"\nIn the final analysis, no one was. Because when you look at the book of the Klarsfelds,\u2019\u201d\nmany people do not know that, but there were Americans and Swiss and Finns and Swedes\nand Norwegians who were Jews deported from Drancy. Those passports didn't matter at all\nto the Germans. But the ploy was there at this particular point. When you look back at this\nwhole period -- the Nazi period, the deportations -- you see one psychological aspect of the\nprogress of that dehumanization after the other.",
        "Q: You are in the mountains caught in the middle of this. You are about to come down to\nBigorre. What did you do?",
        "A: I went right to La Pergola, saw the Frajermauers. They said, \"You know, we are here\nbecause we are Belgians, but we don't know how long.\" In fact, they were not Belgians. The\nchildren were, the two daughters. That's why they left the family with them. \u201cBut you cannot\nstay here.\u201d \u201cBut let's wait and see what we can think about.\u201d I went up to the attic and hid in\n'\u00ae Without nationality, stateless (French).\n\" Serge and Beate Klarsfeld.\nthe attic. There was a room up there with a cot, a cot that had no sheets or anything, just a\nsmall mattress on it and some storage, a storage room it was mainly -- and there were\nsuitcases and all kinds of discarded objects that weren't even ours. They were, these were of\nthe owner of, of the, the building and I hid up there for two days and two nights. The door\nwas not a regular door, but it was slats of wood and you could peep between the slats and it\nhad a padlock on the outside. My distant cousin, Anny, the daughter of Mr. Frajermauer,\nlocked me in. And the next morning I hear footsteps coming up, and I peep through that\nthing to that crack and I see two gendarmes, not Milice, local gendarmes from the police,\ncome up with Anny and I hear them ask her, \"Who has the key to that lock?\" And there she\nis, and I peeped and then I stood sideways so that they shouldn't notice, and I had to be very\ncareful not to move or make any crackling noise. You know these, these wooden planks,\nthey can easily give you away. And I hear her say, \"We don't store anything up here. We\ndon't even have the key for this, but 1f you want to break it open, go ahead and do it.\" And I\nhear him say to her, \"You know where your friend 1s still, don't you?\" Because they knew\nthere was another person living under that address because we had to register with the police\nhere, just like we did in Bagn\u00e9res-de-Bigorre. That was the idea of a assigned residence,\nwhere you would register periodically so that they know you have not left this assigned\nresidence. There was a law against leaving this assigned residence.\nAnd she said, \"We don't even have the key.\" And I have never talked about that because\nthat's something so private, but I guess eventually that has to be brought up, too. And by the\ntime this is shown, well, the person herself will not be aware of it, but it has to be, it has to be\ntold, I think. And he said, \"The only way I will not try to break that lock open if you kiss me\"\nto the girl. That was 1942. She was 20 years old. A 20-year old distant cousin of mine. In\nfact, I liked the girl. \"If you kiss me.\" And she said, \"No, don't ask me to do that\"--\"Ne\ndemandez \u00a2a pas, ne me demandez pas faire \u00a2a.\" \"Well, then I'll break the lock open.\" She\nsays, \"Well, go ahead and do it.\" She didn't want him to, to give away that there is somebody\nin there. He said, \"Well, I guess you are right. I guess you are not lying to me.\" But\nregardless, he grabbed her and kissed her and lifted her skirt and tried to molest her, tried to\nhave sex with her. The second gendarme said to him -- and I hear all this -- \"Leave that girl\nalone and let's go.\" That's when he let go of her. And they all three went down. And I stayed\nup there another night. And then when they came back to tell me that it's time for me to get\nout of there, I am pretty safe, one evening, I kissed Anny and I said, \"You almost got raped\non account of me.\" She says, \"I had to save you. I had to save you.\" \"If I had to do it,\" she\nsays, \"I'll just have to do it. I didn't want them to get into that attic.\" She lives today in\nAntwerp. She has a family. An evening later -- the same evening, actually, because I couldn't\nstay another day--I left on foot from Cauterets at night. I had taken a rucksack, belongings,\nleft on foot from Cauterets. Guess where I went to. Bagn\u00e9res-de-Bigorre. Back to Bagne\u00e9res-\nde-Bigorre. Why? I knew a family there that had remained there. The family Spira, S-P-I-R-\nA. Their daughter today lives in Kew Gardens, New York; and we visit periodically. And\nanother daughter lives in Israel. Susie in New York and Recha in Israel. I went, left at night,\nheading toward Bagneres-de-Bigorre. I walked all night. I went through Lourdes. That's in\nthat same area, slept under a tree during that night, resting up, next day during the day, I\nwent to the Spira's, made contact with them and spent with them several weeks, all the time\ntrying to secure a false identification so that I should escape to Switzerland. Living with the\nSpira's, I lived in hiding. I didn't go out. Maybe, no, I never went out at all at that particular\npoint. The father went out to do the shopping and the marketing and everything else, bread\nand stand in line. Mr. Spira, Max Spira -- Mendel Spira, actually. And I stayed with these\nfriends for several weeks, maybe five or six weeks. At one time, we feared a police raid into\nthe house to just check out. It was during the night and the two girls and I slept in the, the\ntwo daughters and I were in the attic, slept in the same room. I on a, bedded out on the floor,\nand the girls on the bed, and at that point when we heard the noises, Susie just recently\nreminded me, \"Leo, remember what you did when you, when that noise came?\" I said, \"No.\nNo. I must have been hiding somewhere.\" She said, \"You opened the window and you\nwalked out on the roof.\" She said, \"Do you remember when one morning you woke up and\nnext to you there was a dead rat.\" I said, \"Yes, I do. How did that happen?\" She said, \"Well,\nin the middle of the night, you remember, we heard that noise and something on you and you\nstarted banging and banging and you had killed a rat.\" That was right next to me. She\nbrought back these things to me and I said, \"Wait a minute, Leo, you went through some\nthings that today, you wouldn't even believe you could have done it.\" They were good\npeople, the Spira's. They harbored me. We remained friends for a long time. Still are, with\nthe daughter and I in New York. But when I had, finally had my false ID papers,",
        "Q: How did you get them?",
        "A: Mr. Spira knew a person in town who was connected with an underground situation. And\nthey procured these papers for me, for some other people, including a friend who was part of\nthat distant family by the name of Albert Herszkowitz.\u201d\u201d He later was deported in the same\ntrain that I was in. And we made our way to the Swiss border, having already through that\ncontact with the cards, found out whom to contact near the Swiss border, near Evian-les-\nBains. A farmer's family, the son had smuggled, a young man in his 20s, had smuggled\npeople into Switzerland. We arrived in Evian-les-Bains, looked for the address. In fact, he\npicked up us up at the, at the railroad station, because we had notified him so that he, should\ndirectly come to his farm, spent a couple of days on his farm, and two days later, he took us\nup into the mountains to right to the Swiss border in the mountains. We walked some 40\nsome hours there or maybe even more. Heavy shoes. We spent one night in the mountains,\nsleeping on a, sort of an incline, a slope and that night, that was in October 1942, and that\nnight a light snow fell. When we woke up we were covered with sort of a rime of icy stuff.\nNext morning we crossed into Switzerland. This man had instructed us, this young man. In\nfact, he left us up there, five of us. Went back to his house. He says, \"All you have to do is\n\u201d The interviewee notes that various spellings of this name occur in several records: In\none, Albert is listed as Abram Herskovicz. In another, Albert\u2019s brother Mordka had been\nrecorded as Herzkowicz.\njust cross this thing. You are at the border.\" From here on in, we are on our own, simply\nbecause he as a Frenchman doesn't want to be caught be a Swiss being a smuggler. He would\nbe arrested. He took us to, we paid for that. We crossed into Switzerland and we had been no\nlonger than 10 minutes walking on the Swiss side towards the valley, we knew. It goes down\nand it goes into the valley.\nWhen the path goes down constantly in a little serpentine, we go into the valley. That stands\nto reason. Before we could even reach half point, we had gone maybe 10 or 15 minutes, the\nSwiss border police, they wear these big hats. They look like scout hats. Like the Canadians\nsome -- wear the Mounties, similar -- and shepherd dogs. So the dogs started standing up,\nand he gave them some command or whatever that is. The dog listens to these commands\nevidently, and we knew that if we were attempting anything like running or anything else,\nbut who would run in Switzerland? After all, we are in free Switzerland. We are in neutral\nterritory. We had heard that they had taken in German deserters and, and, fliers that had been\nshot down or had been on mission over France and had to -- and were shot down and made it\nto the border and were accepted in Switzerland. Why run from a Swiss? We were coming to\nthem and said, \"Hello, we are here. Here we are. Now we are in your country -- a free\ncountry, right?\" Wrong. We were taken down into the valley into a little town called St.\nGingolph which 1s a border town. Half of the town is French and half of it is Swiss. On the\nSwiss side, it so happens the cemetery is located. So when somebody dies on the French\nside, they got to take him across the border, aboard the border post. They lift the border post\n-- they inspect coffins even, to see that there is no contraband. At least in those days, they\ndid. Now maybe that's eased up. St. Gingolph -- G-I-N-G-O-L-P-H. Exactly across from\nMontreux, which is in Switzerland on the other side of the lake, Lac Leman. That's the Lake\nof Geneva. But we were in Switzerland, in the Swiss part of St. Gingolph, taken to a police\noffice. And there is a captain. And this captain was a rock. A cold rock. A stone. He had eyes\nand he had a nose and he had a mouth, but he had no feelings. We cried. We begged. We\ntried to take his hand and kiss his hand. We were young kids. We kneeled. You name it.\nEverything bureaucratic. \"How did you get over? Who helped you?\" \"Nobody!\" All these\ninquiries. \"How did you make it up here? How -- how did you get there? Where did you\noriginate?\" \"Well, we came from Evian and walked across.\" \"Who showed you the way?\"\n\"Nobody! We were in these mountains for days.\" We didn't have to tell him it was just a\nnight or two. Nothing doing. Enough. In effect, I know the words that we said. We said in as\nmany words that we would like to stay here until the end of the war in one of your camps.\nWe know you have camps for internees, refugees, just to work and for food. We don't need\npay. All we want to know that we are there and can live, wait out the war. Not an emotion,\nnothing! Nothing at all! Just motions and, and, and very quick questions and bureaucracy.\nThey sent us back to Vichy France. And the Vichy France gendarme took us over at the\nborder post in St. Gingolph and brought us into the French gendarmerie,\u201d' and we spent a\nnight in their cells. I had taken my shoes off. I had high shoes. I had taken my shoes off. I\n*! The total force of the gendarmes (French).\nhad to peel my socks off my feet. I had bloody feet from walking in the mountains. I know I\nhad because they hurt, and I know I had it because I could feel my socks sticking to the shoe\nand a couple of women were among them that were sent back, and my friend, Al\nHerszkowicz, Albert. And from there by train, we were taken to a camp whose name you\nhave heard many, many times: Rivesaltes. I met some people recently here at a meeting in\nWashington.\nThis woman, she was in Rivesaltes; same experience from Switzerland. Her brother, her\nhusband, and when she heard that I went out and talked about it in Columbia to a group on a\nShoah exercises, she came up to me and she says, \"You brought back a whole period of my\nlife when you mentioned the word 'Rivesaltes'.\" Taken to Rivesaltes in October. Separated\nwomen from men. Also again, Polish, German, group from -- Luxembourgers. Milly Cahen,\na friend, the young lady whom I had befriended in the train from Switzerland to Rivesaltes,\nshe was in, in an adjoining section of the camp and we spoke across the barbed wire. Later\nwhen I went to Europe with my family and we visited Luxembourg, and we went to visit her\nhusband. I hadn't known that, but Milly just a few weeks earlier had been killed in an\nautomobile accident. Never got to saw Milly again. A bright young person. Her husband,\nvery saddened, told me that she had just had that violent death. Anyway, from Rivesaltes,\nafter a few weeks -- well, not so many few weeks; just a couple of weeks, we were taken to\nDrancy. Now in Rivesaltes -- again, I didn't go to Drancy just because they wanted me to go\nto Drancy. I was hiding out in the camp. Yes, again. \"Where will you hid out?\" they said. I\nsaid, \"Well, let me try.\" Barracks have a ceiling, but there is a triangular roof; something that\nlooks triangle where you have an ungulated roof going this way and that way. And between\nthat peak and the barrack, there is a -- is it plywood or plaster board ceiling? I climbed up\nthere and lay down on that flat with my rucksack. I had to have that with me. Somehow\nthat's, this was my apartment. This was my life. That's what I had to hold on to. If I didn't\nhave that, I didn't have anything anymore, you see. This was ludicrous, really, in hindsight,\nbecause you only carry or shlep~ around things that you don't need. But you hold on to\nthings. I was lying up there and hearing them go and count. And I was missing. My name\nwasn't, I wasn't there. I wasn't in the barrack when we checked in the evening. We were\nchecked in, in the evening as to presence. In the morning I wasn't there. And I hear them\ntalk: \"Ou est tu? Ne cachez pas.\"--\"Where are you? Don't hide. It won't work.\"--\"Ca ne\nmarchera pas.\" \"We know where you are.\"--\"Nous savons ou vous \u00e9tes.\" \"Tu est\"--They\ndon't \"vouvoi\" you, they \"toutoi\u201d you. And there I am trying not to breathe even because I\nfelt if I, breathing maybe, But unfortunately, and I could have expected it, should have\nprobably, some of that plaster board started falling down and it fell down from there you\nknow, and I really heard it trickle down like...\n* Jerk, drag (Yiddish).\n* Interviewee explains that the polite or formal plural, \u201cvoivou,\u201d wasn\u2019t used.\nAnd so they came in the area and said, \"We know you are up there. Why don't you just come\ndown and make it easier.\" I didn't get punished or anything. I climbed down, climbed down\nand they said, \"You tried, but it just didn't work.\" To them it didn't really matter, because to\nthem people came and went constantly. This was just another transport they had to do, and\nthey wanted to just numerically have the right amount of people and to know that nobody\nhad escaped, because that would reflect on their efficiency. So when they have x amount of\npeople to take and count it in the barracks the night before and the next day these people\nhave to be transported, so that number better be the same number that you counted the night\nbefore. That's all they were concerned with. Not the punishing me with -- if they had\npunished me and put me in a brig, I would have preferred that because my deportation would\nhave been delayed. But that's not the case. They took us to the train and took us to Drancy on\nthe 20 or the 22nd of October. We were taken by transport -- passenger train, not cattle cars.\nAnother ploy to make us feel are we going to camp so, by that time all of us had been used to\ncamps and those situations so much, that another camp was just a continuation of -- an\nexpected situation. So Drancy -- by that time, we in the south had heard of Drancy but did\nnot quite realize the immensity of the camp and the tragedy involved in that preparation\ntoward deportation. It took us a day to get up there. We arrived in Drancy. Again in that\ntrain, several times going to the wash room, I looked at the situation over. Escape was\nalways on my mind. Maybe this is the, the deep urge to live and, and experience. But there\nwas no, there was no getting away from that bathroom because the gendarmes stood right in\nfront of the door when somebody went to the bathroom. They were in the car with us. It was\nnot like the gendarmes were riding in another car ahead, or in the back so that they should be\nthere in case of emergency. They were with us in the train. And you know how the French\ntrains are, were at that time anyway. Each compartment had their own door to walk in, so\nwas no use trying it there and again, let's wait until the next camp and see what we can do\nlater. We arrived in Drancy and checked in. The checking-in process in Drancy was, well, a\nfirst step n a, in a real dehumanization process. Number one, when we arrived there, the\nfaces that we saw, the, the eyes with queries in them and, and a lot of questions, \"Where are\nyou coming from? How is outside? What did you, what do you think? What news do you\nhave?\"\nEverybody gathering about a new group of arrivals because they may, they may have\nsomething to convey and we went through a barrack process of checking in which would\nalso mean taking your watch away, your rings, certain belongings, money. And another\npsychological ploy: giving you a receipt for the things that they took from you, with the\nadmonition, \"Don't lose that!\" because you will never get them back. That is your receipt that\nhas a number on it. It had a number on it. Just imagine that! And people there tried to sort of\nwhisper to us that this isn't good here. And we knew, as we came in, the mood immediately,\nit wasn't Rivesaltes any longer. It was not Rivesaltes by any stretch of the imagination.\nDrancy was a complex that was built to be a military barracks facility. It was a multi-story\ncomplex almost like a stadium because it was round. But due to the war, beginning of the\nwar, that building, that structure, was never finished. So the places, the rooms that they put\nus In were wide open, concrete floor with piping laying around and half-installed electrical\nwires, half-installed plumbing, makeshift, and it was concrete. Windows -- no, no windows,\nThere were no panes in the windows. It was just the opening where the windows were\nsupposed to go in the frames later. That wasn't done so it was all open, breezy. And on this\nconcrete, straw. Men, women, children together. Minimal facilities to wash. Community, one\ntrough like, where you, where the water ran down from in trickle. Minimum toilet facilities.\nWatchtowers. Barbed wire. Suburb of Paris close to quote \u201ccivilization.\u201d Minimal food\ndistribution. That's where we were issued the Jewish star. This 1s where we had to wear it.\nThe population in northern France and the occupied zone had to wear that already in the\ntowns, streets, everywhere. But we having just arrived in Drancy had to put that on because\nthis was the administration of the German authorities. \"Juif\" --- French for \"Jew.\" In\nHolland, it was \"Jood;\" in Germany, \"Jude.\" I cannot fail to mention that, because I always\nmention that. And it has to be mentioned over and over and over again, that the German\npropaganda told you that a Jew, you can smell them a mile away. A Jew, you know when\nyou see a Jew, from a distance, you can smell him, you see his actions, you see, there's no\nway where you can mistake a Jew for what he is. So the obvious thing, question is, it's a\nrhetorical question and even young children to whom I speak periodically in a museum or in\nschool when I ask that and I say, so what is your next question then. And they would say,\n\"So why did you need that star?\" And some young people, eight, nine year old, says, \"I know\nwhy.\" I said, \"Tell me.\" He says, \"To humiliate you.\" And for a child that's a big statement.\nHe understands that. So we had this star and we were easily recognizable, yet we had to wear\nit. So that destroys their whole thesis, their whole propaganda, and their propaganda can be\ndestroyed in thousands of ways because nothing ever made sense. It only dwelt on the, on\nthe, on the emotions.",
        "Q: Go back to Drancy. So you were in this camp. What happened in Drancy? What did you do?",
        "A: We saw utter despair, uncertainty, acts of, of aggression, pushing, shoving, end of rifle butts,\nand threats. And it wasn't until I saw a newborn baby being shot like a clay pigeon, and the\nmother being killed too because she threw herself into the path of the bullet, that I spoke to\nmy friend, Manfred Silberwasser. And I said, \"Manfred, if this can happen in Drancy, what\ncan we expect where we're going to? This is France. This is not yet Germany.\" There was no\nquestion of Auschwitz yet, because Auschwitz, the rumors that had come back to us were,\nwere we didn't even want to think about that. We didn't even want to believe that, that that\nwas possible. But this was November 1942; and in January 1942, the, the, the Wannsee\nConference had decided on the Final Solution of which the news had only trickled down to\nus. And everybody was always suspicious, leery of that, that cannot happen, take people for\nthousands of miles to gas them to kill them and then the -- always came back that there were\nalways rumors in the First World War that turned out to be just that -- rumors. And I said,\n\"Fred, what we hear about what's possible, how they're going to... And we must do\nsomething. Now if these are rumors and we prove to be wrong at the end of the war, then so\nbe it. I would rather be wrong at the end of the war than not be prepared now to do\nsomething about this.\" They take your watch away, your toothbrush, glasses, eyeglasses.\nThey would leave you the eyeglasses, but when somebody had very thick eyeglasses where\nit was very necessary for that person to carry to see your hand in front of your eyes, those\nthey took away. That's the torture. Somebody that had two eyes that needed for reading\nglasses, they left them those. They were very selective as to how they moved that, that\npsychological ploy. And compacts. A compact to a woman and lipstick to a woman is, 1s\nsomething to hold onto. Her person is a person. Without that she is not fully a person. Or the\nsame thing for a -- combs they took away from us, because they could be a weapon. But we\ndidn't need it anyway. They shaved our hair.",
        "Q: What did you do then?",
        "A: Well, on the sixth of November. We had one sign while we were there of something hopeful\nwhen towards the beginning of November, the skywriters were flying overhead in the Paris\nsky and I also later witnessed bombardment. But these skywriters wrote \"Le Huit,\u201d Le Hutt,\nL-E H-U-I-T\" which means \"the eighth.\" And on the eighth of November, on a Sunday,\nNovember the eighth, the Allies landed in North Africa in 1942. So they were playing games\nwith those things, but they just wanted to let the French population know that on the eighth,\nyou can expect something. They had these little things going on periodically to encourage.",
        "Q: When did you know you were going on a transport?",
        "A: The day before they took us.",
        "Q: Tell us about it.",
        "A: Thursday the fifth, in the morning, they notified us that we will be leaving. In the afternoon\nof the fifth, Thursday, took us to the train station of Drancy, to Le Bourget, in trucks. Again,\nwe looked how we can jump off that truck, but that would have been of foolishness because\nthe guards were right on there and anybody who would jump would be shot at. And people --\nwe, my friend and I, when I say \u201cwe,\u201d had a, an advantage, namely that we were not with\nfamily. A husband would not jump off the truck and leave his wife and children there. That's\nfor sure. Or a young child that is without parents will not try to run away because he or she\nwas told that where you are going, you are going to meet your parents, and vice versa.\nParents were taken and were told where you are going you're going to meet your children.\nBecause the kids were taken out of the school and brought in and the parents, again \"tohoo\nva-vohoo.\" And we were taken to the train and put into the trains in the evening. Now it\ncould have been 5:00, 6:00, or 7:00, somewhere around this time. November it gets dark\nearly. It was a, a sort of a misty type northern France fall, raw day. Put into the trains at 50\n* Bight (French).\nper cattle car. I understand from other people who were in the east, in those cases, they even\nhad a hundred per cattle car. Fifty per cattle car which was bad enough of a, what I like to\ncall, microcosm of humanity abandoned by the world. Everybody, old and young and from\nall professions, from all walks of life, from all economic strata, from every segment of the\nJewish population. Children alone. Crippled people. People on stretchers. Counted out 50 per\ncar. Now, Linda, imagine yourself in a situation where you and a husband and two children\nare at the end of rifle butts pushed into a cattle car, counted out, \", 48, 49, 50. In!\" Fifty-one\nwould have been the other child. This other child does not go with his parents and sibling\ninto this car. This child is at this point separated and put into the next car, counted out as\nnumber one going into the next car. You might say they are separated by one car length but\nin fact they are separated by an ocean. They are worlds apart. And a good chance is -- a bad\nchance -- is that that child will never see the parents again, and the parents will never see that\nchild again. And the trauma of that family is indescribable. I can say words; they are not\nanswerable. I can express thoughts; they are unthinkable. Even to express them is almost a\nludicrous endeavor. Dehumanization to the worst degree!\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: You're 1n the cattle car. The doors -- tell me what they did with the doors.",
        "A: They shut them closed, yeah. These sliding doors, they were closed shut. And from the\noutside, just latch-locked -- heavy metal latches. And that was in the evening. Now, the good\nthing would have been for this train to leave. But it didn't. It did not leave until next morning,\nabout 12 hours later, 12 or 14 hours later, in the early morning. As I see the report in the\nKlarsfeld book, it was something like 8:05. Because there was a precise schedule. But to be\nall night in a waiting standing train is much more torture than being riding. When you are\nriding, you, you see progress, you see something is happening. Sitting there is like being the\nexpression \"sitting ducks.\" And, of course, in that particular confinement you have a whole\ngamut of emotions running their course. You have resignation, you have despair, openly\nexpressed; a lot of crying, a lot of moaning, some praying. A young man with a gangrenous\nleg and knee attempting to make love to a young woman in the train. He did that in the camp,\ntoo. Call that an expression of life. Call it an expression of, perhaps, resignation of what else\ncan happen. Call it whatever you will. It was an act, perhaps this was the, because perhaps\nthis was the one human act that really happened there. He didn't force that person. She didn't\ncry or shout or resist. But it points up that what happened in that train was, all privacy of a\nhuman being was, had been taken away. There's no more privacy. How can you, with one\nbucket in the center of that car, of that cattle car? Everybody relieving themselves in that one\nbucket -- man, women, and children -- because you had to. You had reached the common\ndenominator of dehumanization. There was no such thing as \"I am a man, I can't show it,\"\nand, \"I am a woman, I can't do that.\" And people were still thinking that there was something\nof humaneness ahead of them. We recently saw that film about one remembrance. The one\nstark scene that I -- my family didn't want me to see that at all, and I only saw glimpses of it,\nlike snitches of it. But at the end, I saw that one scene where the woman open, stands in the\nopen door of that cattle car confronted by the SS officer at the arrival in Auschwitz or\nBirkenau. And she said to the person, \"We have seven dead people in that car.\" And he\nlaughed and said, \"Well, these are the lucky ones.\" That points it all up. That that woman\nspeaking to this SS officer thought she was really confronting a human being who could\nunderstand this tragedy. And this is why people throughout the transport were trying to talk\nus out of running away. We had decided to make our getaway.",
        "Q: Who is \"we\"?",
        "A: My friend and I.",
        "Q: And you are still standing. You had not yet began to move?",
        "A: We hadn't moved. We were squatting, standing. We moved in human waste. The stench is\nstill up here, and it's, it's powerful. There were three of us who planned, but two only\nescaped. And some tried to talk us out of it. \"Look what can happen to us if they find you\nescaped. They will kill us all!\" And our answer at this point was, \"So what do you think\nawaits us, anyway?\" They were some in previous transports who tried to escape. And one\nman was caught under the wheels and was then thrown back into the car with two legs\namputated to bleed to his death. And people died anyway. Malnutrition. Maybe some\nsuicides. There was this woman in crutches in that train, pointing her crutch at me 1n, in, in\nweapons style, like a weapon, like a dagger -- pointing it and telling me, \"Que Dieu vous\ngarde!\" -- \"Let God keep you! You must go. You must do what you want to do. Don't let\nanybody talk you out of it.\" You be-- To her, we were a symbol. We were a symbolism.\nPerhaps it will succeed, and then we can tell something about it. A woman in crutches. Every\nbit in her 70s, with streaky gray hair and deep, sad, dark, sad eyes, actually consoling a child\nthat was there without a parent. I don't know whether that father or mother was along. The\nchild was there crying, and she was in charge of that child. And Tony was there -- a distant\ncousin of mine -- and her husband. She was the one that had sewed on my star in the camp.\nAnd under the star, I had a half a pound note of Irish pounds. Under the star, under this star,\nthere was a half a Irish pound note that I had salvaged over the last several years, sent to me\nby an aunt who had immigrated from Austria to Galway. She had sent me that to Belgium,\nperiodically, and I saved that one. Didn't want to spend it or exchange it, just for an\nemergency. Didn't even know what the value of it was. But 1t was something to hold on to.\nTony sewed that onto me; said, \"Why do you want that there?\" I said, \"I want it under the\nstar. Sometime when I tear this star off, 1f I do run away, I would like to have that. Maybe I\ncan buy some bread or some -- buy a train ticket with it, or what have you.\" But it was some,\nsomething. And we planned on our getaway.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: I have repeated that so often, and I don't want to over-dramatize. I don't want to be pleading\nany kind of heroship or anything like that. But the kids, when I speak about it, to them this is\nlike an adventure. We are not heroes. I don't even exult in the word \"surviving\" because it\nspeaks of something so, so exclusive. You survive. How many did survive, really? So, it's\nalmost like you are putting down those who couldn't survive, and you exult in that. It was\nfear, utter fear, that prevailed upon us to do that. Two little words: fear and luck. One has to\nmotivate you, and the other one 1s there to hopefully let you succeed. Luck, you have. This is\nluck. And it's only --",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: First, I would like for people to understand that if the hero that they, somebody whom they\ncall hero -- whether they look at a person tells about it, or a monument that that, of some\nhero of years gone by --only that person knew really how scared he really was, you see. You\nmake a hero of somebody, but that person knew deep down that there was a lot of fear.\nHeroism isn't something that comes sort of at the spur of the moment. How did we do it?\nThere was only one way of doing it. Other than having tools to cut out the bottom of the train\nor cut out the ceiling, there was only one way -- the obvious way -- a window. And these\nwindows were squares. Perhaps 24 by 18, something like that. But you see, in cattle cars\nthey are normally called \"huit, quarante\u201d\u201d\u201d -- eight horses, or 40 men, in military terms. Both\nwindows had bars, straight bars. Two bars: the one on the one side facing the other track that\nruns parallel had barbed wire. That would not have prevented us from using that window,\nbecause a barbed wire that's rusty can easily be bent back and forth and can be eliminated. A\nbarbed wire can be cut by bending back and forth a few times, and then you have just the\nbars to contend with. But that window was not in our plan, because that was the window that\nwas next to the other track and you don't want to jump when you jump onto a track.\nEspecially from a moving train, because you can't really take that big chance. I mean, you\nwant to succeed. The left side -- the north side, as it were, because we were traveling east --\nwas the one that faced the ravine, the bushes that are alongside and the telephone post, and\nso on. That's the window we chose through which we will make our getaway, we hoped to\nmake our getaway. And as soon as the train, we had all night to think about that. We were\nwalking in, in, around in miserable conditions.\nI mean, we were sliding back and forth. So the only way we tried in the morning to move\nthese bars, but it wasn't possible. We decided the only way that we could possibly do that is\nby trying to twist them or to bend them forcefully or forcibly.\nAnd we dunked, we took our sweaters and we dunked them in human wastes, made them\nwet, to create a tensile cloth. Dry cloth you cannot wring too well. A towel, for instance. But\na wet cloth can be wrung and wrung and wrung, and it twists and twists until the moisture\nhas dripped out entirely until it's dry. That sort of principle is applied in a tourniquet style\nwhen you use it on an arm. We used that as a tourniquet. So if you figure that two bars, you\ntwist that sweater around the bars and then you go twisting, twisting, twisting until you can,\nWe helped each other. We tried that several times. It was no give yet. There was no give yet.\nBut we hoped that something will happen. And then we moved in the side and see maybe it\ngets loose a little bit. But after a while, when we twisted again, again, we gave up for five\nminutes to catch our breath and we were perspiring. We were working under pressure. This\nwas our getaway. This was life. There the countryside flew by us, that bucolic countryside --\nFrance, the fields. And this was -- we were approaching champagne country, you know. The\narea of lusciousness. But here we were going to certain death, which now we know. At that\n> Bight, forty (French).\ntime, we only speculated. But I am glad we did speculate. It didn't let us fall into some sort of\nlethargy, like a lot of people were. And we twisted and twisted, and then finally we saw that\nglimmer of hope where the bars 1n the frame started to move ever so slightly, ever so\nslightly. And rust came out falling from that fitting that it was in, the hole that it 1s set in.\nRust came out. Now, we never hoped to get the bar out of there; because they are set 1n like\nan inch or so, half an inch. But we hoped to, them to be bending. We worked for a while, and\nwe saw them ever so slightly bend inward. Then we used our hands to move them apart\nagain, so that they should start loosening. And it did that! We moved them back into the\nproper position. We went back and twisted again and this time, the bending inward was ever\nso slightly more of a bend. And we put that again, did that. We worked all day, being\nmindful of the fact that if the train would have to come to a stop, these things would have to\nbe put into proper position. Because then the guards would walk out of the first and the last\ncar. They were in the first car--that was a passenger car--and the last. These were Gestapo,\nand these were the German guards. And, of course, French police. The French police, French\ncollaborators.\nThat's a chapter by itself. Towards the late afternoon, those bars had moved apart, through\nour efforts, enough where we could see our way squeezing through it. And we put them back\ninto the original position, just again in case the train would come to a stop and the guards\nwould come up and inspect. One time the train stopped at a station, and the people there\nseeing it wanted to reach me. We shouted \"Water!\" The -- they didn't let them get close\nbecause these people were aware of three transports going by there every week. Some of the\npeople were aware of that, and sometimes that awareness helped communicate simply\nbecause some of us. And I didn't do it, because I didn't leave family and friends. But some of\nthem, husbands or wives or children, whoever had left families behind in Drancy or hiding\nout somewhere, they would drop envelopes, and the people would pick them up and would\nput stamps on them and mail them. Or just notes: \"We are going away. We are going away.\nDon't forget us.\" Cryptic notes like this, you see. But they didn't let them approach. We only\nmade one stop. In hindsight, I see exactly the time when the train -- because it's in the book -\n- when the train would arrive at the German border, and the German guards would take over\neverything by schedule. But we did, Finally, under the cover of the darkness -- 1t could have\nbeen begin around seven o'clock, and it was dark at that time already. We did climb out of\nthat cattle car. My cousin Tony, distant cousin Tony Gutefreund handed me my rucksack\nthrough. I was the first one to step out. I dropped down, held onto that bar, and then reached\nmy way to the back of that cattle car to the coupling. Reaching for the coupling with my foot,\nand standing and holding on to this, and then holding to that metal tron -- wrought iron --\nstepladder that leads up to the roof, holding on to this, and stepping on those. I was already\nhalf free. I was standing there reaching my rucksack around, putting it only with one strap on\nmy shoulder, and my friend came next. He did the same procedure. In fact, I told him\nalready, \"Now reach for the coupling -- la coupler.\u201d\u201d\u00b0 I stepped over to the next one, and he\n\u00b0\u00b0 Coupling (French).\nused this one. Our third friend that was going to go with us either never had the, the, got up\nthe nerve to do it, or perhaps he was noticed by someone that he was reaching out, because at\nthat very moment or just seconds later, the car, the train went into a slight curve on the north\nside. That's the side we intended to jump. And the curve is like a concave curve, which\nserves the guards as a means to inspect the whole length of the car, the train. They are\nshining their flashlights up and down from the back and the front, and they cross somewhere\nin the middle, sort of a floodlight effect, to see that everything on the outside of that car is --\nor those cattle trains, cattle cars, is still under control. It is possible that they noticed that,\nbecause at that moment when the car, the train had come into that curve and somewhat\nslowed down--let's say, from 75 to 60 miles an hour or whatever, my friend standing on this\ncoupling was the first to jump. And I jumped right after him.\nBut at that very moment, we heard whistles and shots fired. Up to this day, I think that one or\ntwo things happened to our friend. He was caught in the crossfire of these beams and just\ndidn't get out of the window. He was attempting to, maybe he was a little heavier than us.\nWhatever the case. Or they may have caught him. Those shots, however, were fired before\nthe train came to a halt, because a few seconds later, the train came to a screeching halt and\nwe heard more shots fired -- probably in the air. Warning shots. I don't think it was at our\nfriend because I don't think he really ever made it out of the window. But that's conjecture.\nAnd voices: \"Let's look for...Let's search...Run up and down.\u201d We were lying there in that\nravine and that wet, tall grass, holding our breath together in a moment that seemed like\nhours. But it was just a few minutes. And it wasn't until we heard no longer any voices and\nwe heard the train being set into motion again that we let our breath out. For the first time in\nso many weeks, we were what you might call \"free;\" but at least -- if not entirely free, at least\naway from the train that was taking us to certain death. Because only 72 hours earlier, 48\nhours earlier, we were there in utter despair, put into a train. This was a total metamorphosis\nin a few minutes. We tried to make our way, and did make our way, into a village nearby. By\nthat time, everything was closed. And because of blackout -- war time -- the windows were\nblue and blackened out. And we went to this big shop, rapped on the door, and an apprentice,\na young man, came to the door and told us that there was no bread, they are closed. And we\nsaid, \"Yes, we do not want bread at this moment. But we would like for you to tell us where\ndoes the priest of the village live.\" And he said, \"Wait a minute.\" -- \"Un moment.\" \"Just a\nminute.\" And he went in and got his jacket, came out with us and took us to the priest of the\nvillage, to his residence -- like a little house sacristy. We rapped, rapped on the door. We\nwalked in, and the priest wanted to know, \"What brings you here?\" The baker said, \"These\nyoung men asked for your house.\" Then he walked off. \"Qu'est qu'il se passe?\" -- \"What's\ngoing on?\" At that time, we had torn off our star. We didn't want to walk there with that. And\nwe felt later that this priest, that as good as he was and the shelter that he did give us, would\nhave probably be a little more reassured if we had the star. He would know we were\nescapees rather than maybe agents sent there to find out if he is really into helping people.\nWe told him we escaped from the train. He said, \"Ah, oui. Trois fois par semaine.\"--\"Three\ntimes a week,\" he said. Unfortunately, we never knew his name. But names didn't matter at\nthat particular time. He didn't know ours either. So, he said, \"Oh, yeah, three times per week.\nAnd you did escape from that.\" \"What we want is, can we stay for the night?\" He said,\n\"What you first want is, is make yourself clean a little bit.\"\nWe came in. We were -- smelled to high heaven. We were infested. \"You may also be\nhungry,\" he said. He put a pot up to warm some milk, give us bread and cheese. And he says,\n\"Une nuit seulement.\" -- \"Only one night.\" \"Parce que les patrols, le matin ils sont ic.\nToujours tous les matins a six heures.\" -- \"Towards six o'clock in the morning we have the\npatrols here. I will let you stay for the night, but you have to be out of here before 6:00.\" He\ngave us, let us wash up, gave us this warm milk and bread and cheese, and put us into a bed\nwith white, crisp sheets, wishing us good night. Where just hours before, we were thrown\ninto a car at the end of rifle butts. And in no time we fell asleep. Exhaustion! We let\nourselves just fade away into a dreamland. Next morning -- and that night went so fast -- a\ntender tap on the shoulder. He says, \"Les gars,\u201d -- \"Hey, guys! Hey, guys! Hey, guys, it's\ntime to get up.\" Can you imagine a voice speaking in nice terms, like it was just like\nsomebody, an angel, had just come down? We hated to leave that bed. But he had breakfast\nprepared. He gave us a note to a colleague of his, a priest in another village. He gave us some\nfrancs and food for the road. And we were walking, walking, as we bid him goodbye and\nthanked him. As I said, unfortunately, we never knew his name and he didn't know ours. But\nagain, this was not a moment to dwell on that. And on the road we, we took advantage of one\nof those farm trucks that went back, a horse-pulled truck, a farm wagon, hay wagon. And he\ntook us into a next village, where he was then. We walked again; we wound up into that\nvillage where that other priest lived that he gave us the address to. And, you know, the priest\nwasn't home. This was Saturday morning. He was out at Mass somewhere. And we asked the\nmaid that was there, \"When will he be back?\" She said, \"Shortly.\" So we walked into the\ncemetery to just visit graves, so we shouldn't be noticed by anybody in the streets. The\ncemetery is a safe place. The police doesn't go there to search for people walking around. We\nhad our berets on, because we had our heads shaven. Then we got back to the priest. And it\nwas about lunch time, and he gave us lunch because he had the recommen-- he had a note\nfrom that other Reverend Father. He gave us lunch, and when he, when he stood there,\nsaying his prayer, his blessing over the meal, we being Jewish had no ideas as to what, we\njust bent down and moved our lips. That night, he let us spend the night in his stable of cows.\nWe slept between cows on straw, fresh straw he prepared. But that odor of the cow and that\nodor of the stable was perfume. And the coziness, the warmth of the cows, the animals\nchewing the cud, was almost as if you hear rain drop dropping on your windowpane when\nyou try to fall asleep. It was a cozy sound and a good, good odor. Again, I am coming back\nto that odor.\n7 Young men (French).\nWhen I -- today when I go through a farming country and I smell the odor of cows and stable\nand dung, it's, it's a perfume -- it's Chanel No. 60, or whatever. But it is a perfume. And next\nmorning, he again urged us to leave, gave us an address of a farmer with whom we spent the\nnext night. And that farmer, 1n some way -- he put us up in a barn - -had to be connected\nwith some underground because next morning he came to us, took us to the railroad station\nand gave us two tickets to Paris. And Sunday, the eight, two days after our escape, we landed\nin the Gare de L'est\u201d\u00ae in Paris, got off the train in Paris. Again, carrying our star in our\npockets, not on the lapel. Hair shaven. And when we were in that train, or was it on the road\nthat I mentioned to Fred? By the way, it was Sunday. He would not have let us go on that\ntrain if it was Monday because during the week there are patrols. \"On Sunday, there are,\nthere are, it's a day off, even for the inspectors for the soldiers for the Germans. It's easier to\ntravel on Sunday. You should be all right 'til Paris.\" And he said, \"If something happens\nwant you to escape from a train there, you will be able to do something 1n this case.\" But I\nmentioned to Fred, \"Fred, 30 years from now when we will think about this, we will think\nback of it as a dream. We wouldn't even believe it happened.\" So he said, \"Are you crazy?\nYou are a fool!\" I said, \"Why do you say that?\" \"How can you think of 30 years from now\nwhen we don't even know what tomorrow will be?\" I said, \"You know, now that we are out\nof that train, nothing will -- nothing is impossible any longer. I look forward now to, to\nsurviving and telling about it.\" That was my spirit. And a lot of them later, again, didn't make\nit, and it could have happened to me, too, because I had so many instances and so many\nsituations that I got out of that were only too, too close to call.\nBut at that moment, I saw the future. And he berated me for it. He said, \"I know what you\nmean. But we don't even have papers. We don't know where to go from here.\" \"We go to\nParis. We going to seek my Aunt out who lives in Paris.\" Her son at that time was hiding in\nthe mountains somewhere. She was hiding also with a priest in Paris that was recommended\nto her by a police captain who liked the family. And he has known her from before, before\nshe was a widow yet. And he prevailed that this priest take her in. The concierge that I went\nto on Rue St. Mort (ph) to look for my aunt wanted to know who I am. \"I am her nephew.\"\n\"What is your name?\" I said, \"Leo.\" She said, \"I can't tell you where she is, but I can go and\nsee her.\" She realized that I was a nephew. I look a little bit like my aunt, too. We have the\nsame coloration. She's my mother's sister. And she brought her back a half an hour later. And\nthere, of course, she held us for several days in her place, and went to a Jewish committee\nthat was engaged in producing false ID cards. And she made some of those, two cards for us,\nand with that card we crossed into the unoccupied zone of France near Tours across the\nLoire River. But once across the Loire River, we were arrested. We were arrested trying to\nget a bus. At the bus stop the police examined our papers, took them away from us, took us\ninto the police station. Did not make much of a fuss. We told them that we escaped from the\ntrain. \"Yeah, but you are now in free France.\" You know, another ploy. But we did not want\nto tell them, \"Yes, we came from here.\"\n8 Railway East (French).\nWe didn\u2019t want to let on that we may have some footholds or people that we know. \u201cWell,\nhere\u2019s some ration cards.\u201d They gave us ration cards. Within 24 hours, with this ration card,\nthey gave us a Laisser-passer -- safe conduct. \"You have to register. You have to appear and\nregister at Centre d'Acceuil,\" --whatever the camp was called -- \"Centre d'Acceuil.\" Again,\nCenter of -- Reception Center. \"And present yourself there with these papers.\" Now why did\nthey not take us there, but let us do it by ourselves? Because their administration was so\ngeared on collaborating with the Germans and inspecting everything that they thought that\nfor us to think to not do this would be ludicrous. Also, by them telling us, \"Oh, you escape\nfrom a train from, \" We told them outright, \"We escaped from a train, then we went to Paris,\nwe got these papers.\" \"Who made these papers for you?\" I said, \"I don't know. I don't know.\nWe just had a friend up there who knew about somebody gave us paper.\" And he doesn't\nworry about that, simply because that is in the other zone with the Germans. He is only\nconcemed with his aspect of law enforcement. And by telling us, \"You are now in the Free\nZone of France\" -- not knowing that we were in that so-called \"Free Zone\" before but we're\ncoming from the north -- that he will give us that confidence, inspire confidence or in any\nway con us into thinking that everything is fine. \"And you are going to a Centre d'Acceuil.\"\nYou see, that euphemism again. But we knew better. And instead for the Centre d'Acceuil,\nmy friend and I went to the town where he last lived in the south of France and saw that\neverything was all right with him. We exchanged addresses, because I told him, \"I will go\nsomewhere where you can get in touch with me.\"",
        "Q: What town 1s this?",
        "A: Bagneres-de-Bigorre. I left him there to his devices. That was the last time -- no, I saw him\none more time, and I will tell you that later. I left him to his devices, he left me to mine, and I\nwent to Bagneres-de-Bigorre. I arrived in Bagneres-de-Bigorre at night, after eight o'clock.\nAnd, and coming out of the train station, there is a gendarme inspecting everybody who\ncomes out of there. And I have no papers! They were inspecting people, not to catch them in\nany way, in some, in some situation of having run away or escaped. I looked French pretty\nmuch at that time, spoke French very well. I am dark. In the southern France part, people\nlook a little bit like this. With my beret, I could strike the pose of a Frenchman very easily.\nBut what he was interested in, to look into my rucksack. If I am not carrying anything\ncontraband. Eggs were rationed, and wine was rationed, and bread was rationed, and butter\nwas rationed, and meat was rationed. I could have easily come from the country bringing all\nthat into the town to do some black market. So he -- here's the comical part: I told you there's\nsome comical parts to my escapes or escapades. Isn't that interesting, that the word \"escape\"\nis really contained in the word \"escapade?\" \"Une minute,\" he says to me. \"One moment.\nWait a minute.\" There was another gendarme a few steps away, like near the other exit. Two\nexits are the, the train station. Who was inspecting a lady with a rucksack with some\nbaggage. This gendarme wanted to inspect my rucksack, but didn't have a flashlight on him.\nHe says, \"Une minute.\" He trusts me, right? Had he known me, he wouldn't have, you see.\n\u201cUn minute.\u201d\nHe goes over there. In a minute goes over there, and wants that flashlight. By the time he\ncame back with the flashlight, I was gone, got to the Spira's house that they rented. A big,\nlike a villa-type thing, and the gate, lo and behold, an iron gate with stakes is closed and\nlocked. I am not about to ring the bell, because they might come out so quickly, the owner of\nthe house who lives in the same building. By that time, nobody knew that I had escaped from\nDrancy. All they knew, by me having written from them from Rivesaltes that I was going to\nDrancy to be deported. What did I do? I climbed up that fence, and there are these concrete\nposts at the side of the fence -- you know, some of them have vases or figurines up there.\nThese had two lions, two smiling lions, one on each side, sitting there, looking at me. And I\nclimbed up that fence, reached over to that circle to that pillar on which the lions were\nsitting, climbed up to the lions and let myself down, jumping down. In the process, moving\nthat lion close to the edge of that pillar so that the bottom, the base of that lion was slightly\noverlapping the bar, the, the pillar. Had I held on to it maybe a little more and dragged it with\nme, this thing could have fallen down and made a lot of noise and really given me away. But\nit just stood there this way. The next morning, when Spira went out and looked at it, he said,\n\"You were lucky. This lion could have fallen on you.\" I proceeded in that -- there was a\ngarden in front and a pathway, a paved pathway, to the house -- proceeded to walk up there,\nto their door entrance, rang the bell. And they opened the door, and they almost fainted.\nAgape: \"How, how, how\u2019? Where, where were you?\" Well, I started telling my story. \"Well,\nLeo, you are going to stay here until we decide on something. You will not leave this place.\nThat was close to the eighth of November, eighth of November. This was close to the\nbeginning of December, already, of '42. I stayed in this place for about a week or 10 days.\nAnd I got, in Yiddish, you say you have shpilkas.\u201d\u201d On pins and needles! I had to move. And\nagainst the advice of my friends, the Spiras, I went to go out and get bread. I had lived in\nBagneres-de-Bigorre many, many months, you see. And I knew this baker, Mr. Broca -- B-\nR-O-C-A -- very well, who always treated me good. When I came with a coupon for a half\nloaf, he gave me a little more than a half a loaf. I became very friendly with him. He always\ngave me a little more. He, young kid and so on, I went to get bread, against the advice of\nSpira. On the way back from Broca, walking back to the Spiras, two gendarmes on bicycles\nrecognized me and shouted and pointed at me. And I started running. But against the bicycle,\nI wasn't fast enough. And they arrested me. That was on the sixth of December, 1942. I spent\none night in the gendarmerie. They wanted to know where I spent the night since then, that\nthey sensed that when I ran away at the train at the station. And I didn't tell them. I said, \"I\nwas here in the woods. I was walking around. I was out of town, and I came back.\" \"But you\nhave friends here. We know who they are.\" \"Oh, yeah, I knew a lot of people here,\" I said.\n\"But they are already gone by now, like I was.\" \u201cAbandon\u00e9 de residence,\u201d \u201d that was the,\nthat was the, that was my indictment. The Southern French Vichy Government were the, the\n*\u201d Worries (Yiddish).\n*\u00b0 Abandonment of residence (French).\npolice and the authorities were, again, not concerned with my escape from the train in the\nnorth. Only that I escaped, that I left originally my assigned residence in Cauterets. That was\nwhat they, that was against the law. So when they arrested me, put me in that cell, the next\nday on the seventh of December I was taken to jail in Tarbes. Tarbes 1s the seat -- Prefecture,\nto you. That's the seat of the, of the Department. And I waited. They assigned a lawyer to me\nfrom the Vichy Government, Maitre Laouie_(ph), and on the eighth of May, 19 -- I am sorry.\nEighth of January, 1943, I was taken back to Bagn\u00e9res by jail authorities to face trial.\nOn the eighth of January I was tried and sentenced to one year in jail. On the behest of the\nlawyer, he said, \"If you are in jail, you will be in jail. They cannot deport you while you are\nin jail, except if there is an attack on a German position in the town or something. If there 1s\na -- some underground or resistance action that they want to retaliate against, they can take\nhostages then. In jail you are not in the safest place, but it's safer than being on the streets, on\nthe roads, and being arrested, taken to Drancy.\" Because they would take the political and\nthe Jews out of jail as hostages. That has happened quite frequently. Sentenced to one year in\njail--which means, if you get one year and one day, that means you serve the full year and\none day. But if you are sentenced to one year, that means you are entitled to quarter off for\ngood behavior. So you serve actually nine months. Lo and behold, after my sentencing on\neighth of January 1943, I escaped from the gendarmes. They went into a bar, a bistro, and I\nconned them into taking off the handcuffs, off their hand, because I have to go to the\nbathroom. You see, they were cuffed to theirs and mine. And they figured they can do that,\nbecause, after all, I have my handcuffs on. Where can I do? \"Can you let me go to the\nbathroom?\" But instead of going to the bathroom, I ran away. I had seen Drancy, and I didn't\nwant to ever have to go back to Drancy again. I had seen it. I ran away from the gendarmes.\nIt was a very emotional thing, at the time. I went to a grocery store and asked them to get in\ntouch with the Spiras. Didn't want to go back to the Spiras. I wasn't going to jeopardize them.\nBecause the Spiras had come to the trial, and sit there and watch my trial. And other people\nthat I still had known there went to that trial and watched.\nAnd they went to the Spiras and told them about me. And the girls came to the grocery store,\nthe daughters, to see me and to tell me that the gendarmes had been there already to want to\nfind out where I am. \"Because he is probably your boyfriend,\" they said to Suzy. Because\nSuzy, when I was incarcerated in Bagneres, after they had called me, after that incident that I\nhad went for bread, they had put me for one night into the gendarmerie before the took me to\njail. Suzy and her sister came to visit me there. But they could do that, because they knew\nthat the Jews knew each other. But in this case: \"Where is he?\" And they went to their house\nand they said they don't not know. All they know is that they saw me last time at -- in the\ncourthouse. And in no uncertain terms, they told them that \"If he will come here, we will not\nlet him stay. In fact, if he will come here, we will have to let you know, because we don't\nwant him to be running around and be caught again. He's probably safer in jail.\" They played\nit that way. I ran away. And they told me right there at that grocery store, \"Do not come to\nus. It doesn't pay.\" With a hacksaw, they cut my cuffs off and left them there. And I\nmeandered for 48 hours in the -- at night. It became night by that time. On a rainy night, into\nthe direction of Toulouse. I wanted to get somewhere to get -- I had hidden some money\naway that they were not able to take from me in jail. I had hidden it in my anus. And when I\nleft that grocery store, my first stop was again to the baker, Mr. Broca. He gave me some\nbread. He told me that already the radio had said that the fellow who lived here before 1n the\n-- in Bagn\u00e9res-de-Bigorre had escaped, to be on the look out, and your name was mentioned.\nSo he said, \"You know, you cannot stay in Bagn\u00e9res.\" I said, \"I know. Can I have some\nbread, please -- to, for the road?\" He gave me that, he gave me 20 francs. And also, in the\ncourthouse, one of the friends that I had, when I went to the bathroom -- my ploy was always\nto go to the bathroom--had stood next to me in the bathroom and also had handed me 10\nfrancs. So I was pretty much equipped, as far as money goes, for a little food and that sort of\nthing. Couldn't make many, couldn't buy a train ticket or something like that, but I figured\nmaybe a freight train, or pick up a, hitch a ride or something. I wandered all night in the rain\nand again slept under a tree in the forest, leaning against the tree. And the next morning, I\narrived in a little village. I forgot the name of that village. In the same area. But I must have\ngone in circles at night, because I had not been that far away from Bagneres-de-Bigorre.\nWent into the restaurant and ordered a platter of beans, and sit down to eat it. And my collar\nhad, the coat collar from, of the rain coat, a gabardine rain coat 1n blue, had this collar upon\nmy neck. I had a blue line around here.\nAnd I was sitting there, ragged as I must have looked --because I had shaved hair from jail--\nand the owner of that restaurant went to the telephone. I saw him go to the telephone and\nwhisper something into the telephone. And at that point, I was resigned not to run because I\nwas really tired. I was really worn out from the night. I was really exhausted, and\nemotionally, I was really down in the dumps because I hadn't wandered that far from\nBagneres. I thought I had made more headway. And in a few minutes, two gendarmes\nwalked in, come up to my table. And they said, \"Finish the beans.\" And I said, \"No, that's for\nthe boss. I leave that for him. He probably needs that food much more than I.\" I made such a\nsarcastic remark. And they found money on me. I spend the night in the gendarmerie, and\nthe next morning I was picked up by the gendarmes from Tarbes. The same gendarmes that\nhad accompanied me to the courthouse. The same two men from whom, whose custody I\nhad escaped. Now, you can just imagine how they felt toward me. They beat me real good,\nfists, key reinforced fists. Then they took a stoking arm from a, from the chimney, and they\nhad a little a little chimney -- what you call it? A fireplace. In the police station. Had took\nthat poker and beat me on my back and on my legs. They wanted to know why I did that.\nThat's bad for them. I put them into jeopardy. They will be fired. And I apologized. You see,\nin France, you do not sentence a prisoner for more time because he escaped. The prisoner\ngets the free time that he spent away from the jail just added to the sentence instead of nine\nmonths. And still, given good behavior, I was going to serve nine months and two days. It is\n-- the onus is on the guardians. The onus is on the gendarmes to make sure that that prisoner\ndoes not escape. That's their job. In America, it's different. When you escape, you get\npunished for that. But in, in military training, the soldiers are trained to escape. They are\ngoing through training.",
        "Q: Let's bring -- we have 10 minutes. I want to bring it up and I want to move to Toulouse. How\ndid you get, how long did you spend in jail?",
        "A: I spent in jail nine months and two days. I was taken on the ninth of September 1943 out of\njail, and transported to a forced labor -- not forced labor camp. A hard labor camp in\nSeptfond, Department Tarn-et-Garonne. I was one of hundreds of prisoners there. In that\ncamp, my friend with whom I had escaped had found out where I was taken. He came to\nvisit me, and he gave me an address that I can write to in case I manage to become free. My\ncorrespondence to that camp, which I was entitled to receive for a month, I was sitting there\nbanging stones, rocks, making it into small stones. My correspondence that I got there, I\nfound out later, was kept and censored and not given to me. The correspondence that I sent\nout went out, but was also read and censored. So my friend came and gave me an address,\nand I memorized it. I didn't write it down. On the 15th of October, 1943, was the Yom\nKippur. And the Germans have a knack for doing that on a Jewish holiday. The day before,\non the 14th, we were informed that the next day we were going to be taken to Organization\nTodt. That is the, the organization, German Organization Todt. They were building\nfortifications named after Todt, who was the armament minister who was later replaced by\nSpeer, and when Todt died Speer took over. Organization Todt was supposed to take us to\nthe Atlantic War building. And there was 14 of us to be taken away for that. And again, we\ndiscussed: \"Will we really go there? Is this just a ploy? Will we wind up in Drancy again?\"\nAnd there was a guard by the name of Kaufmann. He was an Alsace-Lorraine native -- spoke\nGermany fluently and French fluently.\nTo me he spoke German. And sometimes also spoke French. He said to me, \"Bretholz,\nMorgen begleit Ich Si\u201d! -- \"Tomorrow, I will be accompanying you,\u201d and then there will be\nno more running away. And you know what I said to him? \"Mr. Kaufmann, \" Or,\n\"Kaufmann, \" Because prisoners and guards get sort of chummy there; they develop a\nrelationship. \"Kaufmann, you want to know? It is true you will accompany me tomorrow.\nBut whether I run away or not will not depend on you. It will strictly depend on me.\" That's\nwhat I told him. The next day, we were taken to Toulouse. A friend of mine in the camp\nbefriended me in this month, you know. His wife lived nearby. She was going to come to the\nrailroad station to bring him some food. They allowed that to happen, bring him some food\nfor the trip. She brought the two kids along, too. I said, \"When you wife comes there, will\nyou please ask her to buy me a ticket for Toulouse?\" He said, \"What do you need a ticket\n*' Bretholz, tomorrow I accompany you (German).\nfor?\" I said, \"If run away.\" He said, \"You are not going to run away.\" \"If I run away, I want\nto have a ticket.\" Because on the stations, out of the railroad stations, in France, you have to\npresent your travel ticket, to see that you haven't traveled for free. He said, \u201c\u201cWhat are you\ndoing?\u201d I said, \"Can she do it?\" He said, \"Sure, I'll tell her.\" She bought a ticket. I gave them\nthe little money that I had. He gave it to her. She bought me the ticket. When we arrived in\nthe railroad station of Toulouse, and the train was standing -- this was a passenger train with\nthose individual doors leading to each compartment -- when we were lined up there to be, to\nbe prepared, ready to get into that train, I asked Kaufmann if I may go to the bathroom. He\nsaid, \"Oh, come on. You don't mean that.\" He said, \"You don't mean that. What do you\nthink, I am crazy?\" I said, \"Well, I can't blame you. Okay, fine. I can't blame you. I'll wait\nuntil I am in the train.\" That was to placate him. But when I saw, not a cattle train, but a train\nwith doors and windows, I saw freedom. But I placated him by saying, \"Oh, I go in the\ntrain.\" Now, these foolish guards, We have about eight guards for 14 people, seven guards.\nInstead of going with us into the train, at least a couple of them, all seven were standing in\nfront to see that we don't get out. And nobody watching what was going on in the inside. So I\nsaid to my friend -- the one whose wife had bought the ticket for me -- \"I am ready to go. Do\nyou want to go with me?\" He said, \"No, I can't. My wife is there. My children there. I don't\nwant to jeopardize my life. This is -- okay.\" I went to the back window, inched to the back\nwindow, and says, \"You just stay there and see if Kaufmann and his cohorts are coming.\nYou just stay there. When you see them come, then tell me.\" I went to the back window,\nlowered the back window, dropped myself, lost a shoe in the process, one of those loafer-\ntype sandals, that I put it back on. My beret fell off my head. I picked that up. My rucksack I\nstill had, that steady companion. On the next track, there was a freight car parked on the, on\nthe track. In standing position, I went under that freight car, went to the subterranean exit --\nbecause I knew the train station of Toulouse -- walked up there. I had a ticket, but I never\nneeded it. I showed that ticket into the luggage room. I went to the luggage room, and I made\nout that I am looking for luggage. \"It just arrived.\" I said, \"Where?\" He said, \"Well, you have\nto have a, a, coupon.\" You have to have a ticket for your luggage.\" I said, \"Well, maybe my\nfriend, my friend, maybe my friend has it, because we came together. But here's my train\nticket.\" I showed him the train ticket. He said, \"That is okay.\" I walked out from the luggage\nroom right into the street. There was no friend waiting for me. But I said, \"My friend has it.\"\nI walked out there. And I had friends 1n living in Blagnac near Toulouse, and I made my way\nto Blagnac and showed up at Jacques Estrajch\u2019s place. And guess what he told me? \"I got\nyour card you are going to the Organization Todt. Did you get mine?\" \"No, I didn't get\nyours.\" He said, \"I wrote to you.\" Then I knew that I didn't get the mail. And I also knew that\nas soon as I escaped in Toulouse, the first place they will be looking at will be Blagnac,\nbecause that's the nearest place to my escape. He said, \"Go upstairs and take a rest and sleep.\nIf somebody comes, I'll tell him you are not here.\" I slept two hours, I came down, and guess\nwhat he told me? \"The gendarmes were here to look for you, because they know that you\nhad written to me. And I told them yes, you wrote you are going to Organization Todt. But\notherwise, I don't know anything.\" He said, \"Leo, you have got to leave. They told me that if\nthey find you here, they have got to take me also.\"",
        "Q: Where did you go?",
        "A: He took me to an elderly couple that was living there from, originally from Paris. They were\nliving there in the southern zone of France. They kept me for a couple of weeks. Kept me for\ncouple of weeks. I wrote to my friend whose address I had memorized. He sent me my false\nbirth certificate, with an address where to go to and on the first of November, I joined an\naddress in Saint-Vallier on the Rhone River south of Lyon with the French underground,\npresenting myself with my birth certificate. And from that moment on, I was Max Henri\nLef\u00e9vre. I was four years younger. I was born on the 25th of October in Saint Jouin-sur-Mer.\nI knew the name of my father and mother, and legalized, regularized my situation with\nFrench ID papers under the name of Max Henri Lef\u00e9vre.",
        "Q: All right. Leo, thank you very much.",
        "A: You are out of breath, and so am I.",
        "Q: Yes, that is quite a story. And we are done. And it's only half of it. Now I want the whole\nother half in the underground. What we are going to have to do 1s to do that. If you did not\nhave the appointment now, I would go for another hour.",
        "A: That is all I do in the underground.",
        "Q: Yes, and I want to do that. Let us talk. Would you mind coming back?",
        "A: I can do that.",
        "Q: Because all that in the underground is important.\nConclusion of July 31, 1989 interview\nSeptember 27, 1989\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nTape #4",
        "Q: Let's take it back. You had arrived and you were being placed with an elderly couple. Tell us\nwhere you are, and tell me something about that.",
        "A: This is a village called Blagnac -- B-L-A-G-N-A-C -- in the area of Toulouse, one of the\nmajor cities in the south of France. That's the town I had reached in that convoy that I\nescaped from on that afternoon. It was from a standing train in the train station of Toulouse,\nas I explained previously. So I am in Blagnac; my friend, Jacques Estrajch, takes me to this\nelderly couple, just con-- suggesting, or hoping that they would keep me just for a week or\ntwo until I can make arrangements for the future where to go. And they were very amenable,\nfriendly. I spent two weeks with them. The evening hours filled with -- the time of the\nevening hours was filled with listening to Radio London, was broadcasting the news from\nthe front, war fronts, and all other news that pertained to the French Resistance and the war\ngoing on. And I contacted the friend with whom I had escaped in November of 1942. I had\nmemorized his address and sent him the information where I was now located.",
        "Q: How did you do that?",
        "A: Meaning what?",
        "Q: Meaning, can one simply post a letter and expect it to get to its destination?",
        "A: In France, you could just post a letter. In Southern France, that was in the, what you call\nVichy Zone. If we're writing to the northern zone, past the demarcation line, there were\nspecial post cards that were printed in the post office, preprinted with, \"I am well. Please do\nthis.\" This was almost like a form letter. Between the occupied and the Vichy Zone, there\nwas this controlled correspondence. But within the Vichy Zone, yes, they had the Vichy\nstamps and the Petain stamps. These were not the same that were used in northern France, in\nthe occupied zone. And I thus wrote to my friend that I was at this address in Blagnac, and a\nweek or so later, I received in the mail a birth certificate which was made out to the name of\nMax Henri Lef\u00e9vre: I was born in October of 1925, four years younger than what I was\nreally was; and my mother's name so and so; and my father's name. And I had to memorize\nall of this. And with that birth certificate, my friend, when he sent me this, sent me also a\ninstructions as to where to go. His brother had been -- had joined that particular group that he\nwas sending me to, sometime earlier. And this was a, an underground group in the area of --\nsouth of Lyon, in Saint-Vallier in the Department of Drome, south of Lyon. A little town on\nthe Rhone river. And I joined with the underground there in November of 1943.",
        "Q: Would you describe how you got there and what the group was like?",
        "A: The group was composed of a microcosm of, of people who were resisting the Germans or\nthe fascist regimes. There were some people that were still hold-outs from the Spanish Civil\nWar that had come to France -- this was seven, eight -- or six or so years later -- and had\njoined. There were a couple of German deserters. There was -- were one or two of Russians,\nGeorgian Russians or Russian Georgians, who, who had been incorporated into the German\narmy after the Germans entered Russia, took them captive. They incorporated Ukrainians\nand other nationals from Russia into their armed forces. So these people may have been hurt\nor may have been wounded and sent to France for recuperation. A lot of German soldiers\ncame to northern France to recuperate or ride out their injuries in some way. Well, a couple\nof them then ran away and joined with the French underground because they were really\nagainst the Germans. There were some people from Alsace-Lorraine, who traditionally were\neither violently anti-German or very much with the Germans from their nationalistic point of\nview. But there were many Alsace-Lorraine citizens who were deeply nationalistic French.\nThese people resisted the Germans just as well. And there were a few of those in the -- in\nthat group, and a lot of Jews. What was that group? It was really a group called the, the\nVichy French had a youth movement which was called Companion de France. These people\nwere prepared -- young people from age 17 on -- were doing crafts and, and trades. Learning\ncrafts and trades, like masonry and carpentry and plumbing and building, and that sort of\nthing, to prepare them for service in Germany for the new order, to be incorporated into the\nnew order. This was a Petain youth movement called Companion de France. Their uniforms\nwere blue. Their berets were blue. And they sang the Petain nationalistic songs in training.\nThis group took on the semblance of a Companion de France camp. When we -- when I\npresented myself to the camp chief -- Chief of Camp, \u201cChief de Camp,\u201d Maurice Bardin --\nB-A-R-D-I-N -- I showed him a note that I had from my friend, showed him the birth\ncertificate, he did not ask me any questions. He says, \"Welcome to our camp. We will call\nyou 'Henri.' That's what we will call you.\" And they made out the ID for us, and I was\naccepted as one of the, of the group. This group was mainly engaged 1n sending messages.\nMessages from the mountains of Savoy to Lyon, or sending emissaries up to Lyon with\ncertain instructions as to what to do when the next German column comes by. But on the\nsurface, ostensibly, we were learning carpentry and agriculture. And in the morning, we\nwould get up at 4:30 and it was cold. And I have a picture here shows the snows. And we\nwould take cold showers, because there was no warm water. And after that we would have\nbreakfast. But before the cold shower, we would run a mile or two. All part of the youth\nmovement -- exercise before we start the day working. But there were carpentry shops and\nall kinds of other. So if someone would come in and observe the camp, it was a camp of\nCompanion de France. And when I circulated, I had the Companion de France uniform and\nID, so that I could take a train anywhere and also not have to pay with my ID, because I was\npart of the Vichy government Companion de France. But 80 percent of us were Jewish,\nhiding out; but this was a cover, and this facilitated our movements. It was not until\nsometime the end of the year -- December, the beginning of January - -that overnight we had\nto clear out the facility.\nThe Mayor of Saint-Vallier had notified us that word has come from the French Milice -- the\nmilitia, the Vichy France collaborators with the Germans; and they were vicious, they were\nprobably as much, if not more, vicious than the Germans -- that they will come for an\ninspection of the camp, of the Companion camp. Evidently word had come out, or the rumor\nhad been circulating, that there is something fishy going on there. They wanted to have a\nfirsthand view. Well, when they came later, 24 hours later, the camp was empty. We\nreceived our walking papers. I have them here. The release papers from the camp. We got\ntickets to go into various directions. I and a couple of other people was assigned to Chalus,\nnear Limoges. And we took a train to Chalus, and we arrived in Chalus and joined another\nunderground movement there. And in Chalus, in connection with the Jewish hiding out\ncommunity in Limoges, we were engaged in producing false identification cards and to help\nchildren go get to the border so that they should be able to cross into Switzerland to perhaps\nSpain and further on to Portugal. This was our main endeavor, except also putting up road\nblocks and doing communication between the various underground groups in the area.",
        "Q: Was there -- with the first group and also with the second, you talk about extensive Jewish\nparticipation, but it's also mixed clearly with non-Jews. They obviously knew you were\nJewish.",
        "A: It was never spelled out. It was never -- it was never spelled out, the original. In Limoges it\nwas, because there I joined a group which was called \"A.J.\" or Arm\u00e9e Juive.\u201d\u201d So there, the\nmajority belonging were Zionist-oriented Jewish, although there were non-Jews who also\nworked with us. And the Rabbi of Limoges, Abraham Deutsch, he was from Strasbourg\noriginally. He in his office was a great liaison center for all these operations, and of course,\nthe French authorities were not aware of it at the time. And in Limoges, I lived with a lady,\nMadame Bergot, who was hiding me and renting me an attic together with my friend,\nEugene Bass, who was shot on the 10th of June, 1944. And we sometime had in this attic\nroom 12 or 15 or 20 young people staying over night, just squatting on the floor, lying down\non the floor. There was only one big bed, and sometimes we laid across. We were lying\nacross three, four, five people that came to Limoges just to spend the night and go on to other\nplaces. And was -- and Madame Bergot knew exactly who we were, but she is probably one\nof the real Righteous Christians.",
        "Q: Tell me about her. She sounds very special.\n** Jewish Army (French).",
        "A: Madame Margaret. Margaret -- Marguerite Bergot was an elderly woman in her middle to\nlate 60s, who in the first World War after only having been married a few months, became a\nwar widow. She was a widow at 21 or 22. She never remarried, but she always did things for\npeople. A gray-haired lady, whom I went to visit in 1970, when my family and I went -- no, I\nam sorry. In 1954, when for the first time I went back with my wife to visit France. We went\nto visit Madam Bergot, and later -- she was delighted to receive us and made us lunch. And\nlater, when my son was born, whose initials -- his name is Myron -- his initials are M.B., she\nmade sure that she sent him a silver spoon from her set of flatware that were engraved with\nher initials -- Marguerite Bergot, \"M.B.\"",
        "Q: Lovely.",
        "A: She was a good lady. She kept a lot of Resistance people in her attic. She helped out\nwherever she could. She made sure we had ration cards for those who couldn't get them. I\ncould, because I was living under the name of Lefevre. So I got my ration cards legally and\nlegitimately. But there were some of them who did not have false papers. They were hiding\nout, and therefore could not go to city hall and get their ration cards. But Madame Bergot\nmade sure they had either ration cards or bread -- either ration cards or coffee, or, or clothing\nlike handkerchiefs, socks, underwear. That was all rationed.",
        "Q: Where did she get them? How did she get them?",
        "A: Madame Bergot got them! She may have known somebody at city hall that knew her. She\nwould never let on as to where, but there they were. When we went there in 1954, in that just\nfew hours, my wife grew very fond of her, because you could see in that lady a -- what you\nmight call in Jewish \u201ceshet khayil\u201d\u201d\u201d -- a woman of valor. And that she was. A beautiful\nperson from the point of your heart and soul, and reaching out and helping. That was Madam\nBergot in Limoges. And, of course, I first went to Chalus, as I said, but later, I relocated to\nLimoges, which was only about 10 or 15 -- 10 miles or so, or 10 kilometers from Chalus.\nAlthough I went back quite often to Chalus to see friends and distant relatives there, I really\nspent my time in Limoges in 1933 into 19 -- I mean the end of '33, December -- from the end\nof '43 or beginning of '44, until the end of the war, in Limoges. In May of 1944, I was -- I fell\nill with a strangulation hernia. You may recall in the earlier part of the interview that in\nAntwerp, I was already in the hospital to be operated on in 1940, and that never came to\npass. But finally, with all my escapades and all that, the, the hernia just -- a hernia doesn't\nheal by itself, and the hand-made truss that I had just didn't do the job anymore. So one day -\n- one evening, walking through a park on my way to actually an orphanage to deliver some\ndocuments or papers, I -- or a message -- I just was caught by one of these attacks and lay\ndown on a park bench and started throwing up violently until there was nothing left but bile.\nAnd it so happens that a woman walked by in a nurse's hospital sister-type uniform, Red\n*> Woman of valor (Hebrew).\nCross-type uniform. And she came over and wanted to know what it was. Perhaps she\nthought I had been drinking. \"You don't feel so good.\" -- \"Vous ne sentez pas bien.\" I said,\n\"Je sais ce que c'cest.\" -- \"I know what it is. This is a hernia, and I can't push it back.\nNormally you can try.\" She said, \"Well, what you need 1s a hospital.\" And I said, \"I don't\nthink I can do that.\" Because you go to the hospital, you being recognized as circumcised. I\nwasn't going to take chances. She says, \"But at this point...\" And she tries to touch my\nstomach; there was this tenderness and the pain with it. She says, \"This is an emergency!\"\nAnd she called the ambulance, and I was taken to the hospital. And I cannot remember them\nactually taking my clothes off. That's how fast they put anesthesia on me. Already starting in\nthe ambulance. And then when I got in the operating table, I was sort of half away already.\nAnd the next thing I knew was waking up the next morning in the hospital bed.\nAnd a very nice, young religious sister -- it was a Catholic hospital by the name of Saint Joan\nof Arc -- bending over me and whispering in my ear after she had put a hot brick to my feet.\nAnd I had a drain in my stomach, in my belly, because it had begun to almost, you know, to\nbe infected. You know, there is the situation with the strangulation hernia creates these\nemergency conditions. Whispering into my ear, \"I am in charge of this ward, so therefore\nyou have nothing to fear.\" Later, when I needed my documents to make a claim with the\nGerman government for certain restitutions and disability-type compensation, I had to gather\npapers as to all these events. So I wrote to the hospital to send me a copy of, of what I had\nundergone, what operation, just attesting to it. Well, in the letter I wrote to them, \"And if\nSister Joan of Arc is still with you, please tell her that I will never forget her kind words nor\nher cheerful whistle when she walked by the bed.\" She was always whistling a tune. A very\nyoung, attractive cheerful person. And they wrote back to me that she is in Normandy, did\nthey write? Or Brittany? I don't recall. And if the chance will present itself, they will send\nher my regards and tell her how I, how I remember her. I wonder where she is today. Really.\nSo there is a lot of reminiscences, and there are also nice bright moments in that period of\ndarkness.",
        "Q: Let's pull 1t back. You were released from the hospital. I would like you to describe -- you\nwent back to your Resistance work. Can you describe in detail what 1t meant to have to take\nletters from one place to another? What were the kinds of risks that you ran? What kind of\nmessages did you bring? Where did you travel, and who did you communicate with?",
        "A: I went to the hospital on May the 8th, and I was released on the May 25th. That was just\nseveral days before the landing. The landing took place in June -- on June the 6th, 1944. In\nmy little diary that I also have, I wrote, sometime before my release from the hospital, \"I\nhope I will be released before the landing.\"",
        "Q: How did you know about the landing?",
        "A: Because, sometime in April or early May, we had already had in the underground, through\nthe Radio London, messages that indicated that sometime in June, in the first couple of\nweeks of June, there will be major events happening, which at this time could only mean a\ndebarkation. Where it would happen, we did not know. But we knew it was going to happen.\nI did not feel that I would like to be confined when that happens, because there'll be a lot of\nturmoil out there. There'll be a lot to do, a lot to see, a lot to be part of; and that was always\nmy urge, to be part of something. So that between that time and the actual landing, there was\nvery little time to do whatever we had to do. However, how did we feel, coming to your\nquestion about transporting. First of all, we had to produce the cards. We made them with\nfalse stamps and seals. And we, we were counterfeiters, you see! That's what we were -- just\nlike when I escaped from that train. The emergency was there, but I did it almost like a\nnatural thing; because the urge was to be free. So I did it, naturally, with all the trepidations\ninvolved. But there were also trepidations in transporting papers or doing communication.\nBut at the time when we did it, the danger was not that apparent to us. It's in hindsight, as\nyou look: \"What did we do? My God, we were really young and...and dumb!\" That sort of\nthing. But when we did it, while we did it, it did not occur to us that it was in any way\nendangering us. Yes, anybody was endangered who did not have proper papers. You could\ngo into a restaurant as a French citizen. You could go into a restaurant to have a meal and the\nMilice\u2019* would come in and, like random, make, make inspections or certain searches. Well,\nif you were a Frenchman and you didn't have your IDs on you on that day and you were not\ninvolved in Resistance and you were not Jewish, you were a French farmer come to town,\nbut you didn't have your -- any kind of ID on you; you forgot it; you neglected to take it\nalong. Even that would endanger you, because everybody had to have an ID. So we were just\npart of a whole system of, of, of hazards and pitfalls and problems. But we did not consider\nour activity as something that would be any more dangerous than anybody else living under\nthat regime. Although we were exposed a little more. We would have been exposed a little\nmore to the punishment, if they had found us with the cards on us, because that could mean\ninstant death, which happened to my friend, Eugene Bass, on the 10th of June 1944.",
        "Q: What happened to him?",
        "A: That was on the same day as Oradour was burned. I had been asked or instructed to go to\nOradour on that Saturday to deliver some cards, and he had been instructed to go into\nanother town that was a little further than Saint-Junien, another town nearby. The German\nColumn advanced into that area. Eugene had de-- before he had delivered the cards had\ndecided, \"Let me go and visit my mother in Saint-Junien.\" She lived there in hiding. He\nhadn't seen her in a couple of weeks or a couple of months, or whatever. He's the fellow that\nboarded with me. Sort of blondish red hair, curly-haired fellow. Eugene Bass. He was from\nAlsace-Lorraine. He went on the nom de guerre, the war name, Bastinet -- B-A-S-T-I-N-E-\n** Militia (French).\nT. He had gone to visit his mother in Saint-Junien. He arrived in Saint-Junien rather than go\ninto town first to deliver the cards, which was a little further. Got off the train, through the\nstation lobby, to the front door of the railroad station. And the advance column of Das Reich,\nthe Germans, were there already. And everybody walking out was inspected. And he had a\nrucksack; and in the rucksack, he had the ID cards. Shot in the head! His name is listed in the\nbook deportations under those summarily executed. Eugene Bass, his name is in there.",
        "Q: How did you find out what happened to him?",
        "A: He didn't come home that night. He did not come home that night. So a few days later we\ncontacted, a friend and I, his mother. And she had found out from someone, some witness,\nthat he had been killed. And it was through the mother that we found out that Eugene had\nbeen killed. And it would have happened to me, perhaps, and others in the train that we were\nin on that same day, on the 10th of June, 1944, going towards Oradour-sur-Glane from\nLimoges, when we saw the German column, Das Reich -- or one part of the, part of the rear\nunit. Because the advance unit had already been into Saint-Junien. And when we saw\nparallel to the railroad track the country road where the German motorized the motorcycles\nand the half-tracks were heading into the direction that we were heading, rolling up all that\ndust, so some of us decided, \"If the Germans are going into this direction, we certainly do\nnot want to go into the same direction.\" So before we got into Oradour, there was another\nhalt, another station. There was an electric commuter train between Saint-Junien and\nLimoges.\nSo the station before -- there were a couple of halts, stops, before we got off the train. But the\nreport on Oradour that I have on that particular sheet, the write up, says that anyone with a\nticket to Oradour that got off that railroad station that particular morning was taken off and\nimmediately machine-gunned -- just like the other 900 some citizens of Oradour. The men.\nThe women and the children were taken to the church. They were told they were being\nphotographed. They put bales of hay and straw around the church and put gasoline over it\nand destroyed the church, burned it down with the women and children in it. The moans and\nthe cries filled the air. A couple of weeks later, we went back to Oradour to view the scene.\nAnd we stood there crying, with the tears. Tables had been set up with the remains of\nmementos: baby carriages, buckles, shoes, baby dolls, toys that the kids had taken with them.\nOradour has been built up later -- about a quarter of a mile, a half a mile further away, a new\nlittle town. But the original area of Oradour 1s today still a shrine to be visited, to reminisce\nand to cry. Because it was really a stroke of luck that we even noticed that column. We\nwould have gone in there. The mayor of Oradour at that time, on this particular moment, was\narrested, put on a table and in front of his two sons, his two legs were sawed off. Reported\nright in the, in the, in the sheet that I have here. The sons, before that happened to their father\nsaid, \"Please, take us! Do to us what you want to do, but not to our father!\" They cut off his\nlegs, and they shot the sons, too. There was just a handful of people surviving in Oradour out\nof 900-some people. There could have been many more, because those who were hiding out\nwithout papers, that will never be known. There were people hiding out. A lot of Jewish\npeople. And this is exactly the place where we took some of those cards to. So that they\nshould not be in hiding continually, and also be able to move a little freer, travel here or\nthere. But at that particular time, all that was already moot because the landing had taken\nplace, a lot of what you might call, in the Genesis terms, \"tohoo va-vohoo\"\u201d\u201d happened -- a\nlot of tumult.",
        "Q: Let's back up. I don't want to get to the tumult just yet. I would like to stay with Oradour for\na minute. Did you meet any of the survivors? You had come so close, you were two stations\naway. You came after it had been burned. Did you meet anyone?",
        "A: No. I had a call here when I wrote about this. I wrote a piece to the Sun paper, recalling the\nevent of Oradour. It was in 1984, 40 years after the event, and I had a lady call me at home\nwho told me that at one time she and her family had lived in Oradour. And when she read\nthis she had to get in touch with me. But they had left Oradour before the town had been\ndevastated. In fact, it was devastated in error. In the same area, there are two little towns\nOradour. One is called Oradour-sur-Glane, on the River Glane, near Limoges. Another one,\nseveral miles away, not that great a distance, perhaps 15 kilometers or something like that. I\ndon't quite have the distance in proportion. That was called Oradour-sur-Vayres. Oradour-\nsur-Vayres had a group of Resistance fighters. Oradour-sur-Glane had no Resistance\nfighters. They had people in hiding, yes. They had no arms caches. Oradour-sur-Vayres did.\nThe German high command, going towards the front lines, coming from Toulouse, the\nDivision Das Reich -- and by the way, they did a lot of damage in the town called Brive-la-\nGaillarde, where they hung 90-some men from butcher hooks because of resistance\nactivities. And their families had to walk, walk by to view that. That is in the Department of\nCorr\u00e9ze. Limoges was, and, and Oradour was, in the Department of Haute-Vienne. The\nGerman Division Das Reich had been informed, by the Milice or by some of their\ncollaborators, that Oradour-sur-Vayres had a Resistance group, an arms cache there, and that\nthey might hinder their progress towards the front lines. The advance column of Das Reich\nwent there to clean out that nest of resistors, so that the main columns would then have easy\ntravel. But all they knew was Oradour. They looked at the map, and they saw \"Oradour\" on\nthe main road between Limoges and Angoul\u00e9me or wherever, and picked Oradour-sur-\nGlane. And the Mayor said, \"We have no resistance here. You can search the village. You\ncan search everywhere. I give you my personal guarantee with my life.\" And it was by\nmistake that Oradour-sur-Glane became the victim.",
        "Q: I want to take it back to events in which you were involved, okay, in which you know\npersonally. Let's go back to D-Day, June 6, 1944. Where were you?\n*\u00b0 Chaos, disorder (Hebrew).",
        "A: I was in Limoges, doing my daily whatever it is, communication or whatever work I did.\nAnd it was a day of euphoria. The papers reported it, and people were standing in front of the\nnewspaper buildings to read the bulletins. And the Germans were running around like\nchickens with their heads cut off. Chalus had already been liberated by the Resistance;\nLimoges not yet, because Limoges had a main Gestapo headquarters. Chalus was a little\ntown. I also have a little sheet here that shows the liberation of Chalus, and the appeal that\nwas made by the, by the Resistance forces to keep calm and to go on about your daily lives\nas usual. You see, there were two types of Resistance forces in France. One was the FTPF.\nThis was called Franc-Tireurs Partisans Francaises.\u2019 That was like a guerilla movement.\nAnd the other was called FFI, Force Francais de |'Interieur -- French Forces of the Interior.\nThey were under the command of the exiled French government -- De Gaulle, in London.\nAnd there was conflict between the two groups. The ones that listened to De Gaulle were the\nones that went by the rules, when De Gaulle and the French exiled government would give\ninstructions: \"Do not attack such and such a building...\" Because that building happened to\nbe English property. So the FTPF would say: \"Who cares? But in that building there 1s\narmament produced that goes to the Germans.\" So there was this conflict. The FTPF was\nalso a more radical-type movement than the FFI. The FTPF, for instance, had some of the\nSpanish Civil War refugees. They had a communist-leaning group. They had more of the\npolitical activistic -- activist-type people who were fighting fascism wherever they can fight\nfascism, wherever they can find it. The FFI was picking their targets and was going by the --\nwhat might be called \"the rules.\" But in a unruly times, rules sometimes don't achieve\nanything, you see. So this was the thing. But we were in the streets, hoping that soon we will\nhave liberation established in Limoges. And it happened not too long afterwards, you see.",
        "Q: Which of the two partisan groups were you allied with?",
        "A: The A.J. was independent, actually. But we were under the orders of the FTPF. Yes, we were\nunder the orders of the Franc-Tireurs Partisans.",
        "Q: How were relations between the two groups?",
        "A: They were very cordial.",
        "Q: They were.",
        "A: It was a common cause. It is interesting that a common danger, how people's actions\ncongeal, how a common danger becomes also a common denominator and an equalizer. I\nmean, you take the London Blitz, just to divert for a minute --\n\u00b0\u00b0 Free-Shooting French Partisans (French).",
        "Q: Let's not.",
        "A: Ok.",
        "Q: I really don't want to get into that. Can we pull it back? Was there any feeling of\nantisemitism? Did the A.J. feel as if the FTPF looked down on them or treated them less well\nbecause it was a Jewish group?",
        "A: I would never dismiss that aspect of a, of a, of a situation where Jews are involved, because\nour history tells us that. On the surface, it did not happen. We did not feel it. We did not see\nit in so many deeds or words. But it could very well have been there, because there was one\ncaptain of the French army who worked with us. He was a Viennese, actually of Polish\norigin, but coming from Vienna. His name was Prinz. And he was originally with the French\nForeign Legion, then came into France to join the Resistance. And he at one time indicated\nto me that while our main job was to fight the Nazis, if he survives the war he will have to\nsettle a few accounts with some people, that he knew among his unit, you know. And after\nthe liberation, when the German soldiers had been arrested and interned and were in\ninternment camps in Limoges, he took me to one of those camps to see because he was in\ncharge of some of their units. And he took me in one of those camps and he -- I got great\nsatisfaction to see this little fellow by the name of Prinz -- he was about 5 foot 4 -- had these\ntall German prisoner soldiers stand at attention and act like really like scared children once\nthey were in custody. Just weeks before, days before, they were the strong, the strong\nmasters, especially women and children. And then when the day of reckoning came, they\nbecame whimpering children themselves. But, no. We, during our work with the Resistance,\ndid not see it openly, feel 1t openly. And frankly, for that nonsense, during this particular\nperiod there was no time for that. We had an enemy to fight, you see.",
        "Q: Okay. The landing, June sixth, and the aftermath. What did you do? How did you help, if\nyou did help, the invading American forces? Was your group involved?",
        "A: We were involved tn -- our group was involved a little later. A little later, with grave\nresearch and registration; because there had been -- for instance, we received parachuted\nprovisions that came into the area of Limoges. Certain nights when, when the message, the\nmessage, the coded message would tell us to be at a certain place at a certain time, and then\nthere would be... We were told to send a flare at a certain time, up in the air, and then few\nminutes later we would have a drop off of clothing or food items. The parachutes themselves\nwould be gathered up, and the ladies would make shirts out of them. They were in khaki or\nwhite or pink. And in the process, in that execution of that particular parachuting help to the\nResistance, some were shot down, some had to bail out for one reason or another, some were\narrested. And then later on, in the area a little north of Limoges, there was, of course, there\nwas the region of Cognac, and towards the coast there were evidently fatalities. After the\nlanding in later weeks, some of our groups and us, we were involved in researching --\ntraveling and researching with farmers and with the countryside people who might have\nfound soldiers, American, Canadian or British soldiers, also some of the Polish-exile forces.\nWe helped in grave research. It was grave registration. That's what we did, we helped. Later,\nthere were some USO\u201d halls were established, which we helped out with. But right after the\nlanding and when Limoges was liberated, a committee was formed in Limoges.\nIt was called COJDASOR -- Comit\u00e9 Juif d'Assistance Social et Reconstruction -- the Jewish\nCommittee for Social Assistance and Reconstruction.\u201d* This was mainly geared to help\nrefugees -- people who had lived in the area and hidden out, and could not do any kind of\nwork during that period and really were penniless, to, to put them on their feet again. OSE\nwas one of the organizations connected with this. The Organization for Secours aux\nEnfants.\u2019 A children's organization, OSE. You are familiar with that, and some of those\nZionist organizations were involved, like WIZO~\u2019 and Hadassah. And this whole program,\nthat whole committee was supported by the American Joint Distribution Committee. So we\nhad an office in Limoges at 15 Avenue du Midi, and some of us, from our group working\npreviously with the underground with the false ID papers, became employed by that office.\nAnd as later, after liberation of Paris, which was in August of '44, and later the victory when\npeople came back from the camps, again this Committee did a good job of, number one,\nhelping them to get over the first hump, and later to establish themselves with a residence.\nEven helped them find relatives, because the Committee was in touch with the Red Cross\nand other organizations and institutions that were, after the war, spring up here and there to\njust see who had survived and who can be reached. And all these communication means\nwere used to, whether it was by telegraph or radio or whatever. But the COJDASOR was\nthat committee that was established afterwards, and I worked for that. But between the\nlanding and actually the liberation, there was just a very short time. Because, because France\nfell pretty fast to the forces of Resistance, and then the Germans were arrested. And the rest\ntook place in the north of France, of course, where the advancing Allied troops just entered\nParis in August of '44. And had one major scare 1n the winter of '44, when after the Battle of\nthe Bulge the Germans actually advanced far enough to pose a renewed threat to Paris. But\nthat -- again, time took care of that.",
        "Q: But you were in Limoges. Can you describe the day of liberation?\n*\u2019 United Service Organization\n*> The actual name was: Comit\u00e9 Juif d'Action Social et de Reconstruction; Jewish\nCommittee for Social Action and Reconstruction (French).\n*\u2019 The name of the organization is Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (French), and is\nreferred to as the Children\u2019s Rescue Network in English.\n** Women\u2019s International Zionist Organization",
        "A: As I said before, it was almost an unbelievable feeling to know that the day has finally come.",
        "Q: Not D-Day, June sixth, but the liberation itself. When Limoges was freed.",
        "A: Oh, the liberation, yeah. Limoges was freed, was just another normal day, except seeing\nGermans patrolling the streets and Gestapo patrolling the streets and being in charge here\nand being in charge there, you saw columns of Gestapo and Germans being led down the\nstreet by Resistance fighters. The great victorious German army led down the street by\nyoung people in rag tag outfits. That was the...that was the impact. Just a few weeks earlier,\nI was in a railroad station and saw a column...a unit of German soldiers, waiting for a train\nthat they were taking to some direction. They were sitting on the platform, on their\nrucksacks, on their equipment, with their guns standing up, leaning against each other,\nbayonets drawn, you know. They have this triangular thing, arrangement there. One of the\nsoldiers was opening up -- cutting open a can of sardines with his bayonet. Trying to open it\nup; and then he ate the sardines out of his -- out of the can, swallowing them all in all. And in\nhis language, I recognized he must have been either an Austrian or a Bavarian, because\nhaving been born in Vienna, I knew what the Austrian accent was.\nAnd he said, in German -- which I will not tell you in German, but I will tell you that in the\nEnglish translation, \"The people that are walking by here,\" he says, \"those French people\nhere. They will look at us and will say to themselves, \u2018Schon schaut Sie aus, diese\nReichsdeutsche Armee!'\"\u201d\u2019--\"She sure looks good, that victorious German army!\" In a\nfacetious way. And when we saw those German prisoners walking down the main street of --\nwith their arms raised on top of their heads, disarmed...that came to my mind. \"You look\ngood, you victorious German Army! Now that you are guarded by a rag tag outfit, you act\nlike you are the victims.\" Or something like that. That was the main impact. And that picture,\nthat -- imagine that scene repeated itself over and over in France in all the little villages and\ntowns that became liberated, one by one by one. The collaborators were arrested, too.\nUnfortunately, there was also during that period a lot of spur of the moment, perhaps hasty,\nemotional reaction to those that we, the underground had perceived as being collaborators,\nlike selling, dealing black market, or cohorting or fraternizing with some of the German\nofficers -- including some of the people that we had known, our own people. And it was not\nuncommon for someone whom we knew who did black market, even if they were Jewish, to\nbe executed actually without trial, without jury, without due process. But the emotions were\nso high that these things happened 1n I wouldn't just say a few cases. There were quite --\nthere were many.",
        "Q: Leo, we have five minutes left. I think 1t makes sense to wrap it up in this hour rather than go\nto another tape. Tell me what, very briefly, I want to save a few minutes for pictures. But tell\n*! \u201cShe looks beautiful, that German Army\u201d (German).\nme, after the war, you were involved in this organization. How did you get to the United\nStates?",
        "A: I had an aunt in Baltimore, who already in 1941 had sent me papers to...the affidavit to join\nher here in America. But with the advent of the Pearl Harbor and America entering the war,\nthose documents expired, fell by the wayside. In 1946, I received new papers, new affidavits,\nfrom my aunt here in Baltimore. I applied for the night to immigrate to the United States, and\nI joined here my aunt here in 1947. I have a sheet here that shows that I was on a preferential\nquota -- I was born in Austria. And also, one that my travel to the United States is in the\nnational interest of the United States, simply because I worked for that group that did grave\nregistration and I was also involved in the postal censor, postal censor service in Paris later,\nunder the guidance of a army lieutenant, Sonja Beaumont. A lady. I was with the postal\ncensor service for a little while in Paris. I spoke several languages, and so I was a few\nmonths there in that capacity. So I came to the United States in 1947.",

        "A: I married in America. Married an American young woman in 1952, and we have three\nchildren. And in January of this year, we became grandparents for the first time, and that is\nthe -- that's good ending to the story.",

        "A: My name is Leo Bretholz. Do I have to spell that? I usually do have to. And I was born in\nVienna, Austria.",
        "A: 1921.",
        "A: Our family was a normal, or what you might call a \u201cnormal family.\u201d My father was a tailor.\nThey were originally from Poland. My parents were -- came to Austria right after the first\nWorld War, married in Austria, and there were three children in the family. There would\nhave been a fourth, but that child, a boy, died six weeks after birth. I was the oldest. My\nsister was a year and a half younger, and the other one, born in 1928, was seven years\nyounger. A normal family, as I said, with schools and activities, fun -- although some of that\nwas disrupted by the death of my father in 1930. I was nine years old, the oldest at the time\nof the three children. And, my mother, a young widow at 35, never remarried. My father was\n39. And it sort of made me a father image, young as I was, to my children -- to my sisters --\nbecause my mother had to go to work and support the young family. But that was all\nbearable and we coped as best we could. We do not want to forget that in those years it was\nstill, if not depression, but very close to just, just post-depression.",
        "A: And these were hard times. Just as here in America in the middle \u201830s, latter \u201830s, we had to\nmake with -- make ends meet with what was available to us. And income -- my mother was\na, as I said, a widow who had to come up with, with the support of the family, and there were\nJewish organizations who helped out in that respect. And the real, the real tragedy began\nthen in 1938 with the annexation of Austria. Where that family structure, that family entity\nas in So many hundreds and thousands and millions of cases, that family entity overnight was\ndestroyed.",
        "A: Vienna and Austria had a history of antisemitic activities and antisemitic attitudes. When we\ngrew up in Austria, as Jews, we were always aware of the fact that we were Jewish. It so\nhappens that I lived in a district in Vienna where there were more Jews than in other\ndistricts.\nIt was the 20th district, and the second district had more Jews than the 20th, and a few other\ndistricts had -- but the majority of the areas were non-Jewish or very few Jews and\nantisemitism was almost a part of daily life. It's not that we thought a lot about it, because it\njust became part of life. If you, if you, if you live with something everyday, then it becomes\npart of you and you cope with it, if it didn't become too violent. But from time to time, there\nwere denigrations. Sometime we were spit at. Sometime we were singled out for a particular\nrough treatments in schools, the Easter and Christmas seasons particularly. When I think\nback to those days, to me they represent a certain trauma because we, we were Set apart.\nThere was Easter dealing with a religious connotation of Christ and the resurrection which\nautomatically brings back the killing of Christ, and that was the Jewish misdeed. And at\nChristmas time it was -- again we, we couldn't, we couldn't be part of a, of a festive mood\neven if we wanted to. Oh, there were many times when we did participate with neighbors in\ntrimming a tree or sharing 1n, in the Christmas cookies and that sort of thing, but that was all\nsurface. As children, we did things like this because we were part of a, of a, of a greater\ncommunity where there were non-Jewish children and we, we related to them. But the\nexcesses took place at certain times for certain reasons and especially during the depression\nyears. I was then in my early young years, but I do remember that often could we hear that\nall these economic problems -- and even the first World War -- it was all the fault of the\nJews. So we were being maligned and singled out and we didn't like it, but nevertheless we\nasserted ourselves in some way because when, when we went on outings with the Hebrew\nschools, we, we sometime carried the Jewish blue and white flag and we were taunted for\nthat by people who were looking at us. But 1t was a segment in history that does not reflect\ntoo well on, on the Austrian attitude towards Jews, and when we go later into \u201838, it 1s very\neasily perceptible. You can touch it. You can feel it. You could see it, that as soon as the\nAustrian Anschluss\u2019 took place, Austria in the next five, six weeks, or perhaps several\nmonths, the Jews in Austria underwent much more hardship in those few weeks or months\nthan the Jews of Germany did in the previous five years from \u201833 to \u201838. It lent itself -- the\nclimate in Austria lent itself more to antisemitic excesses.",
        "A: Seeing that some of my uncles had been arrested and many of our friends and neighbors had\nbeen arrested, my mother actually urged me to think of leaving as soon as I possibly could --\n' Term used to described the incorporation of Austria in the German Reich on March 11,\n1938.\nleaving Vienna. I had already left school. And an aunt of mine had left for Luxembourg right\nafter the Anschluss, and we planned for me to join that aunt and her husband, my uncle, in\nLuxembourg as soon as I would be able to -- as soon as arrangements could be made. It was\nmy mother who prevailed upon me to leave because she said that for boys and for men, it\nwill be very bad, as we can see. People were arrested every day and within days or the most\na few weeks, ashes were sent back of these people to their, to their relatives. Now whether\nthey were these peoples ashes or not, nobody could ever find out. But they received a\ncontainer with ashes, describing them as the ashes of the deceased who was caught trying to\nescape and shot because shooting was a justification for, for catching someone who tried to\nescape, killing someone, or that he had contracted a disease, a pneumonia. But there were\nthese, these explanations given which no one hardly even believed because some of the\npeople who were freed from camps periodically brought back other horror stories, so we\nknow that. My mother was very much bent on sending me away, and frankly, it 1s constantly\na source of guilt for me, to know that she had sent me away and they couldn't do it. But then\nwhen I consulted with psychiatrist, because I didn't want to have to live with feelings such as\nthese, he confirmed to me that, \u201cWould your mother be able to speak today, she would still\nsay...she was glad she did it.\u201d So, to begin with, she was actually instrumental in getting me\nout and saving my life. She was a good woman. My mother was what you might call in, in\nHebrew, it's described as \u201c\u201cEshet Khayil,\u201d\u201d -- woman of valor. She did the best she could\nunder the circumstances. I am breaking down because...she never had a chance in life... She\nand my sisters and 55 others of my family never had a chance in life.",
        "A: She was a widow and had to struggle to support the family and always helped poor people,\npeople that were less well-off than we or less fortunate. Always helped somebody. There\nwas this poor painter around the corner from us. When the apartment needed painting, she\ncalled him. He didn't even do a good job, but he needs the job. And when it was finished, the\npainting wasn't -- the painted room was sort of streaky, but she had given Mr. Fried a job\nbecause he needed it for his family, you see. But, I got to get myself together to make this\nthing.",
        "A: She urged me to leave, and I did leave.",
        "A: I took a train from Vienna, Frankfurt, Koblenz, to the west of Germany and Trier, the ancient\ntown of Trier. By arrangement with a committee in Luxembourg; it was called the Ezra\n* Woman of valor (Hebrew).\nCommittee.",
        "A: The Ezra was an aid committee, almost like a HIAS,\u201d perhaps. Aid to refugees that came\nfrom Germany and Austria to Luxembourg, provide some shelter, provide food, kitchen, and\nhelp these people who could not stay in Luxembourg unless they had regularized, temporary\ndocuments. Somebody came with a passport and a, and a, and a visa could do that. Others\nthat fled and came illegally, could not. And the Ezra committee was such a committee. And a\nMr. Becker who was the smuggler that smuggled me across from Trier into Luxembourg,\nwas in the employ of Ezra. In a way because later when I went to Belgium, he was also the\none that smuggled us into Belgium, but I am jumping ahead here. But we were -- I went to\nthe border town of Trier, and on the 31st of October, Mr. Becker picked me up in Trier and\nsmuggled me across the border. Actually he took me to the river, the Sauer River and asked\nme cross and then meet him at the other side of the Sauer. And during the night from\nOctober 31st to November the first, after it had been raining for four or five days in western\nGermany -- these are the rainy periods there -- I crossed into Luxembourg. He had asked me\nto put a pair of dry socks into my coat pocket so that when I came across and once I had\ncrossed, I would put these dry socks on, which at the point was not even possible because I\ndidn't have dry socks in my pocket after I had crossed the river. When he told me I was to\ncross that river, I asked him would I -- no, he asked me do I know how to swim. I said, \"Yes,\nI know how to swim.\" I said, \"Would it be necessary, you think?\" because he told me I\nwould wade across. But no way could I wade across that river after four days of rain because\nthat river carried a lot of torrential waters with debris, branches, mud, all kind of things. That\nriver springs in the Ardenne Mountains and comes down. It's a, it's really a tributary of the\nMoselle, a small river which under normal circumstances is a creek, a small stream. I went\nthere later in years with, with my family to get to that same area, and people were just\nwaiting there ankle deep, knee deep in that particular... But I crossed, and the first step I took\ninto the river, I was up to my knees and the second step up to my chest, and then here go the\ndry socks in my pocket, and it wasn't a concern of mine. My concern was to get across. And\nI did! And on the other side, Mr. Becker was waiting to take me into Luxembourg, and my\naunt was waiting there, and I had crossed into safety. Or at the moment, relative safety,\nbecause three days later, I was arrested in Luxembourg. The police came into this cafe where\nI was sitting and having breakfast just a couple of days after I had crossed. Actually, my coat\nwas still wet and not even dried yet, and they asked for my papers and I didn't have them, so\nthey arrested me and took me to jail, and I spent the night in jail in the Luxembourg jail -- by\nthe way, a very clean facility. And the next morning, they interrogated me. How did I come\nover? I said, \"I crossed the river. The river Sauer.\" \"Who brought you over?\" I said, \"TI just\ncrossed.\" \"And how did you get into Luxembourg.\" \"T just walked into Luxembourg.\" I\n* Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.\nwasn't going to say, \"Mr. Becker brought me over.\" And, well, it is my choice. I have two\nchoices. I can pick a place where I want to be taken to out of Luxembourg, either Belgium or\nFrance or back to Germany. So the choice was very simple. I said, \"Well, I have an aunt in\nParis. Maybe I can make my way to Paris.\" So they decided, yes, take me to the border, to\nthis Luxembourg-French border.\nThere is a little town called Thionville-les-Bains. It is like a thermal spa. And they took me\nthere and they -- the next morning -- and they -- commuter train that went to the border, just\nabout a half an hour or 40 minute ride. And I crossed into France. But earlier before we went\n-- before we took that train, at the railroad station, when they went to the ticket to, to, to\nshow that to the ticket window that day, were transporting me, whatever, they needed to\nhave transportation. My uncle had found out that next day I will be taken to the border,\nappeared at the railroad station and he wore a cap. And he was standing on the side, and I\nnoticed him and he noticed me, and he did this to his cap, the visor of the cap: he turned it\naround. There is an expression in Yiddish which translates \u201c\u201cTurn the visor around,\u201d which to\nme meant, \u201cIf you can come back, come back.\u201d And when they had taken me to the border\nand I crossed, they indicated to me that the other end of the border, just a few hundred yards\ninside France, there is a Jewish camp, they said. That's all they told me. And they will\nprobably be able help me. But when I told them earlier, \"How do you want me to manage\ngoing into France by myself? Can you --\u201d They said, \"Well, you just told us that you\nmanaged to swim a river and come into Luxembourg. Now if you could make it across a\nriver, you will make it across dry land, we know.\" They were sort of patronizing me but also\nvery nice to me. They were not in any way vicious. They were just doing their job to get me\nout of there. And I was glad they didn't -- that I wasn't sent back to Germany.\nAs I crossed into France, I went to that camp and it was a preparatory camp, hakh\u2019sharah,\u201d\nwhere, where Jewish young people were preparing for aleeyalr to Palestine. I got into this\narea and somebody at the gate actually stopped me, wanted to know who I am, and I said, \"I\nam a Jewish fellow, just escaped from Germany. The Luxembourg people told me --\nLuxembourg authorities told me that you might be able to help me....\u201d \u201cWell, they do that\nperiodically just to make you feel that when you get across the border, you will be all right.\u201d\n\u201cThere will be no problem so that they should be off the hook. But actually as many as we\nget here periodically, we do get some. We always have to tell them that the French\nauthorities tolerate us here. We have only temporary permits to live in France, and if we are\nbeing in any way compromised to give you shelter, to help you further your, your travel in\nFrance, they will dissolve this camp, so we can't do it.\u201d Being that far away from Paris and\nnot having money on me, I thought of my uncle's turning the visor around and waited until\n* Special training for youth preparing to settle in Israel.\n\u00b0 Immigration to Israel (Hebrew).\nnightfall to cross back into Luxembourg and made my way back to Luxembourg city during\nthe night. The last leg of that trip was in early morning catching a farmer with bales of hay or\nwhatever he was carrying on his wagon to get me to the city line of Luxembourg. And from\nthere I found my way to the address of my aunt. An hour later I showed -- a couple of hours\nlater I showed up at the apartment where she lived. I rapped on the door and my uncle stood\nthere and my aunt was sick in bed from, from aggravation that she had brought me there and\nnow I was arrested again. I was a kid of 17 years old. She -- that aunt lives today in\nBaltimore. She is in her 80s. She is my father's, my father's youngest sister. And as soon as I\nopened the door, my uncle said, turning to her, \"I told you he'll be back.\" So, then they\nprevailed through the Ezra Committee to have me stay with a family in Luxembourg where\nabout a half or dozen or more people were also staying waiting for further disposition of their\nsituation. And I stayed there from the night of the second, third of November to the ninth --\nsix days. And the night of the ninth to the 10th of November, exactly Kristallnacht night, Mr.\nBecker took six or seven of us into Belgium, smuggled us into Belgium, into Brussels. And it\nwas during that night that we saw the strange phenomenum looking to the east as we traveled\nin the car of skies that had changed their color. It was the night sky, but we could see\nreflections almost some eerie looking reflections of reddish-purplish coloration and it was\nonly the next morning 1n Brussels that we found out that Kristallnacht had happened in\nGermany where hundreds of synagogues and businesses and homes had been set afire and,\nof course, Luxembourg being in this tristate area, Belgtum/Luxembourg/France, we were\nvery close to the border. And chances are the flames that we saw reflecting were those that\nhappened in Trier or Koblenz or other border, border, localities that were evidently\ndestroyed in that night of horror which many considered the beginning of the end of the\nEuropean Jews -- Judaism, you know.",
        "A: The next day after we had contacted the Jewish committee in Brussels, in Brussels, Belgium,\nthey gave us transportation to go to Antwerp. We took that train which 1s a train that goes\nevery 20 minutes; a electric train from Brussels to Antwerpen. Within an hour, we were in\nAntwerp, again going to the Aid Committee who were registering us, giving us food\ncoupons, and trying to help us regularize our situation as refugees from Germany to\nBelgium. I met an uncle of mine there who had left Vienna., my mother's brother, distant\nrelatives which came from the same town as my mother, which we found out about. And\nfrom November '38 to May 1940, I spent 18 months in Belgium, which were pleasant\nmonths with distant relatives and friends, constantly under the pressure of not being sent --\navoiding to be sent to a camp because they also had camps for these refugees. Somebody\nworking in that committee, also a Viennese fellow who worked there in, in the office helping\nout with paperwork made sure that when the time came to select people for the camps that I\nwas not being considered for it because they tried to get me into a school, to register in a\nschool, and I did. And having registered in that Flemish school, I became authorized to stay\nwith a temporary ID card which I have here with me, too, as a memento. And periodically\nwe knew that temporary permit to stay. It was a school which, in Dutch -- Flemish -- was\ncalled \"Openbaar Beroep School voor J ongens,\u201d\u201d which means \"Public Trade School for\nBoys.\" And I took a course in electrotechnical, studies, you know, was a trade school. Took\nalso languages and I learned Flemish almost, almost to perfection. I had good marks in the\nFlemish language and as a young man you learn faster, and I had a facility for languages\nanyway. So that's why I was in this trade school. With my distant relatives in 1939, I went\nfor a week's vacation to the ocean. All along I got letters from my mother and sisters that\nthey were coping, that things were at the normal rate as normal can be considered, and I\nalways had intended to bring them over, but I didn't have the money to do it, because you\nhad to pay a smuggler. And they themselves were not really urging me, my mother and\nsisters. Because they -- the mood was that \u201cHow long can this last?\u201d or this sort of thing.\nThere was constantly that hope against hope. How much can it last? Although when my\nuncle brought his wife and daughter and son over to Belgium, he had to pay an amount,\nwhatever it was, to the smuggler. I asked him why it wasn't possible to bring my mother also\n-- at least suggest. So he said, you know, they had to leave on quietly. Nobody could know\nabout it. The fewer people knew about it, the better 1t was, and again the money aspect was\nsomething that we didn't even discuss because that sort of becomes something of a very\ndelicate situation. But my mother and sisters did not come and actually, really didn't urge me\nto do something for them to come. They felt it'll, it'll work itself out. Then in '42, we found\nout differently. When I was in Belgium then, then, of course, in 1939, the War broke out. So\nafter 1939, September 1939, there was no longer any question of anybody leaving from\nAustria. By that time even they had wanted to...had they wanted to leave, there would be no\nproblem, no way to do it. That would be a problem, you see, would have been because the\nwar was on. The Germans were fortifying the borders and Maginot Line in the south of\nFrance and the Siegfried Line further to the north. There was no possibility any longer after\n'39 for anybody to come across, although some tried and did. But it wasn't as open and free\nas up to the beginning of the war. And, of course, in 1940, in May 1940, on the 10th of May,\nthe Germans attacked the lowlands, Holland.",
        "A: That is the day that I will never have to guess where I was, because I was in a hospital. I had\na hernia and I had decided to see a doctor and rather to go on with a hernia bothering --\nhaving from time to time -- why not do it? And on Thursday night, May the ninth, I went to\nthe hospital at Antwerpen in a suburb of Antwerpen called Berchen and the same evening\nthey prepared me for the operation of next day, meaning cleaning my body, shaving, that sort\nof thing. And operation was to take place next day, about seven in the morning. Between\n5:00 and 6:00, Friday the 10\", fire bombs were flown over Antwerpen. Visibly. We could\nactually see them. In fact one of those bombs dropped right into the yard, the courtyard of\nthat hospital. And the order came for those who were ambulant to pick up their documents in\n\u00b0 Public Trade School for Boys (Flemish).\nthe office and leave the hospital. And I left the hospital, never been operated on. I made my\nway, not where I lived in my apartment that was in the middle of the town, but in that suburb\nwhere my distant relative lived, and I made my way to their apartment. And that time I\nalready found out that there were notifications, proclamations that all aliens of enemy alien\norigin have to register with the Belgium authorities. Although I had Polish nationality due to\nthe fact that my parents were never naturalized in Vienna, I as a Viennese-born person could\nnot be an Austrian until I would have been 21 years old with the first military service. It's not\nlike in America. When you are born America, you are an American. And so I was, to all\nintent and purposes, also a Polish citizen which showed on my ID, and I went and registered\nand in good faith, hoping that they will see \u201cPolish citizen.\u201d I couldn't have done differently\nanyway because they would have caught me or perhaps I could have fled. But in good faith,\nI did it. Like many hundreds did. I am, number one, I am of Polish nationality. And the Poles\nare Allies because Poland had been attacked, and besides that, even born in Austria or others\nin Germany, we were the first victims of this Nazi regime. We are here now. We came here\nlooking for shelter, for refuge, as people who ran away from that system. So we're certainly\nnot enemies of you. We are enemies of that system. But in bureaucracy, that doesn't count.\nWhen you are born on enemy in enemy territory, that makes you an enemy alien, I guess.\nAnd a train took us to southern France. After we were arrested, we were told to bring a\nchange of clothes, a toothbrush, a blanket, and food for a day. And they transported us to the\nsouth of France. Ironically enough, Germans were with us. German Nazis were with us in\nthat train. They also had to register, but to them that was just a formality because eventually\nthey knew they would be exchanged for Belgium nationals because that goes in international\nrelations as a normal procedure. But we as Jews, number one, we were not exchangeable,\nand number two, we wouldn't have wanted to be exchanged. Were we arrested, number one,\nwe would have wanted to, and number two, we were not exchangeable, whichever. For us,\nthat didn't count.",
        "A: To a camp called Saint-Cyprien. The ironic, more irony, that when we got out of that train, in\nthe camp on the way to Saint-Cyprien where we stopped for one night near Agde\nsomewhere. When we looked at our train on the outside, the facing of the train, in white\npaint, it was marked 5th Column -- \"Cinquieme Colonne.\u201d\u2019 So they transported us as Fifth\nColumn people. No wonder that when we traversed the French countryside from north to\nsouth that in those small stations where we did, where we made periodic stops, that people\nwere doing this to us [making \u201cslitting throat\u201d gesture]. They thought we were, you know,\nGermans. We wound up in Saint-Cyprien, a camp in the Department of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales\nin France, right near the Spanish border near a major town, a larger town called Perpignan.\n\u2019 Fifth Column (French).",
        "A: Saint-Cyprien was a -- an established camp. That was -- this was 1940, so that camp had\nbeen established somewhere between '36 and '38, mainly holding Spanish refugees that had\ncome into France due to the Civil War in Spain. People had left Spain; the duress of the war\n-- fled into France and there at Saint-Cyprien at the time, was nothing but beach. So these\nrefuges from Spain had come there, and established a camp facility. First they had tents, then\nthey built barracks with undulated metal roofs and later more barracks were built, but the\nfloors in the barracks were not floors. They were sand. It was just the uprights were there and\nthe roof. But in the barracks, it was just the sand of the, of the beach. And there, straw was\nput on there and we were lying on that sand on that straw in that barrack -- shelter. As we\nwalked through the sand, to go to the latrine, or to go to the kitchen to pick up the rations, we\nwalked sometime on bones. A jaw bone here, a tail bone there, a skull here there of domestic\nanimals, donkeys and horses and goats and dogs. The Spaniards had brought these animals\nwith them. They were farmers. They were people who had a little livestock. They brought\nthem with them, and in the process they died or they killed them even for food. And this, this\nwas the scene there. The ocean periodically -- the tide carried the waters up to the barracks\nand sometimes right into the barracks, the ones that were closest to the shore. A beautiful\nsight it was scenically because there was the Mediterranean and there in the not too distant\nfuture were the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Mountains jutting right into the Mediterranean, so scenically this\nwas a beautiful place. And if any of us had thought to escape, that wasn't possible because at\nthe end of the beach where the beach meets the ocean, you had barbed wires. And patrol\nboats were cruising so if somebody would go through the barbed wire and try to swim, they\nwould be detected. The better way to escape would have been trying to escape from the\ncamp, and then by foot make it into Spain. Be this as it may, we got there in May of 1940.\nSometime in July or early August, and I couldn't pinpoint that, dysentery developed in --\nbroke out in that camp, and typhoid fever. There were a handful of latrines. There was a\nmale section camp and a female section camp. There was a handful of latrines, and with the\ncondition under which we labored, it was a constant line to these latrines. And they were\nelevated on stilts because the ocean would come tn -- the seat of the latrine would be\ncovered, so it was on stilts. So you walked up those stilts and there was that one door, that\nswinging door like, and you would go up there and relieve yourself and as soon as you were\nsitting down somebody rapped on the door, so you had to get out and get in line again. And\nthere was no paper. There was no tissue paper. There was not even a newspaper. So what we\nused was straw. It's awful to bring back these things, but these are all segments of\ndehumanization that people go through and you somehow cope with it because you live and\nyou hope you will survive. What happened later, of course, these situations were almost\nbearable, sometimes even comical. And I escaped from that camp with another fellow.",
        "A: Some people that we knew in Antwerp who came from Antwerp as Belgian citizens with a\nstream of refugees into the area, this is the general southern area from Toulouse to the\nPyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. One of our friends by the name of Oesterreicher had finally arrived in Toulouse\nand he had inquired with the authorities where some of the people that were transported into\nFrance were taken. And they told him, the foremost reception for these camps, they called\nthem \u201cCentre d'Accueil,\u201d\u00ae -- Center of -- Reception Center. Like they had a red carpet out for\nus, or something like that.. These euphemisms, they have their way of creeping into a\nlanguage and then that's what it is. And they found out that we were in this camp, and\nOesterreicher wrote to us. We could receive mail there. Communication between people who\nhad left in the train and others that left by car on their own volition because they want to get\naway from the war zone. So, sort of, families through Red Cross and through authorities\nfound each other. That's communication. Slowly as it went, it still helped.\nAnd Oesterreicher found out that we, that we were taken to this camp, and he came to the\ncamp and asked the commandatur, the office to issue a visiting permit so that he can visit his\nfriend. And they called me that there is a friend here visiting. And I got dressed, went to the\nvisiting area, and he told me then, \"Why don't you go back and get your shoes?\u201d I was\nbarefoot. \u201cGet your shoes, get your clothes because I think you can get out of here.\" I say,\n\"How do you do it?\" He said, \"I see that these guards here are not very watchful. They are\nhalf asleep. They walk around. They talk. They talk to the internees. They exchange\ncigarettes. You can give them cigarettes and you can give them chocolates and they will be,\nwill be looking away, maybe.\u201d So I went back to the camp and took my things and told my\nuncle who was there with me from Belgium and his son, a cousin, that I am leaving with a\nfriend. They were not amenable to fleeing. They said, \u201cOh, we will.\u2019 because they had, they\nhad -- he had his wife still in Belgium, the other one had his wife still in Belgium, so they\nwere not going to go anywhere where, where, where their wives may have, have no\nknowledge where they are. In other words, you are there, and you hope that these authorities\nwill take care of it. As you saw others were exchanged, you hoped that you perhaps would\nbe let out and -- but with the situation that it was, that there was dysentery and all this illness.\nThe guards themselves were not crazy about guarding these people because they're not\nimmune to that. I mean, dysentery can spread across a barbed wire too, you see. So they\nrelaxed their watchfulness. And my friend was right! When we walked out, we walked\nacross the barbed wire that was surrounding the compound where the, where the office was.\nHe walked out the regular door, the regular gate, because he had his permit to visit me, and I\ndid not. But as we walked there, we saw at the bottom that one of those barbed wires was\nactually lifted off. So he said, \"If you can climb through that underneath and cross behind the\nbarrack, they won't even see you. Join me in front.\" And that's exactly what I did. That was\nexactly what I did. And we walked into the little town of Perpignan. We bought a box of\npeach preserves and a slice of Roquefort cheese, and I learned how good preserves can taste\non a fully ripened cheese. That is a great combination. You should try that sometime. And he\nbrought some money for tickets, my friend did, to go to Toulouse, to travel to Toulouse. And\nhe knew where these people that I had been with in Belgtum. My distant relatives had finally\nalso come from Belgium into France, and they located themselves into a little town called\n\u00ae Reception center (French).\nBagn\u00e9res-de-Luchon in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. I got a ticket from Toulouse to Bagneres-de-Luchon\nand joined up with them. And with them, I spent most of the time in France living in the\nsame places there, then we were taken to forced residence, and then we were taken to\nanother forced residence, but they were always involved, these people. Their family name\nwas Frajermauer.",

        "A: When we...when I came to Luchon, I had to regularize my situation in Luchon with the\nauthorities there. To them, I told them that I just came from Belgium. They didn't know that I\ncame -- there was, in those days, there is a Hebrew word right in Genesis, and it speaks about\ntohoo va-vohoo.\u2019 This was tohoo va-vohoo. You know the expression?\n\u201d Chaos, disorder (Hebrew).",
        "A: It was utter turmoil. So when I came to Bagneres-de-Luchon, these relatives, distant relatives\nwho had already established themselves with, with the temporary permit of residence took\nme to the, to the city hall. It was a police station. Well, this 1s a relative of us who just came\nfrom Belgium. He walked a lot and he -- that's why he's so late, and he stayed somewhere on\nthe way. And I got these papers. I became -- I had to have these papers because of ration\ncards. I couldn't get ration cards unless I had this regularization of the situation involved tn it.\nAnd I became just another one of the refugees in Luchon. You see these were not all Jewish\nrefugees, although the majority were. But there were Frenchmen and Belgians there who just\nran away from the war zone and finally wound up somewhere in the south of France because\nthe south of France was then considered probably the furtherest and safest part. And then\nwhen the -- by the way, in the fall of that year we were also asked to sign up for work if we\nwanted to volunteer to do harvest, wine harvest, and we did that. Came back to Bagneres-de-\nLuchon, there we got a Laisser-passer\u2019\u2019 for that, a safe conduct that we could do that. The\nauthorities wanted us to help the wine harvest. Why? Because we were the refugees that\ncould fill in the labor force. Their men had been taken to the army. Their French men were in\n-- had been inducted into the army since 1939. So they needed agricultural help and that's\nwhat we did. We came back to Bagneres-de-Luchon. We were paid in, in food. We were not\npaid in money, but we got eggs and chickens and wine and cheese and butter to take back\nwith us, which were commodities that were probably better than money.",
        "A: As acommunity of, of Jews, we, we, we were a support system of each other, supporting of\neach other. The majority had come from northern France and Belgium, and the majority of\npeople knew each other. Families, friends had fled together. Some of them came by car.\nVery few, but some of them did come by car, brought even dogs with them. And it was\nsomewhat regularized. Bagneres-de-Luchon, the name indicating a thermal spa, had a\npavilion like those places do have and for the Jewish holidays, the Jews got together and had\nservices. One of the Cantors by the name of Kreistein, and you may remember why I\nremember his name. It so happens he is from Vienna and in the district where I lived. I once\nsang with his choir as a boy. And Cantor Kreistein, a very diminutive man, and I say very,\nbecause you can be five foot six, that makes you five foot five diminutive, but he was\nprobably was like close to five foot, but the voice of an angel, a very high pitched soprano\nvoice. Kreistein was leading the congregation there, and we had services. But shortly\nthereafter, after the services, then came wintertime, and we spent the winter in Luchon which\nis heavy winters. There's snow in these mountains. Right after that, after that in early 41, we\nreceived notification that we will have to move to Bagne\u00e9res-de-Bigorre, giving us safe\nconduct to go to Bagn\u00e9res, we had two weeks to do it: go to Bagneres, look for lodging, look\nfor a place to live, and then make arrangements to transfer to that locale. Mr. Frajermauer,\nthe father, he and one of his brothers went there, looked for a place, and found a nice place,\n'\u201d \u00abA dmit bearer\u201d (French).\nright at the border of the Adour River, and the place was called Villa Susanne. Villa\nSusanne. It was available. People come there on vacation and rent places for vacation during\nthe summer. Well, the owner of Villa Susanne was very glad to rent that, that facility out in\nJanuary or February for a, for an unlimited time almost because we didn't know how long we\nwere going to be there. But 1t wasn't just renting for a month or two months. We did, we did\nmove, took our belongs, drove by, we rented a camion, a truck, and the whole family,\nFrajermauer and me including. I was included -- and that's not good to say \u201cMe included.\u201d\nAnd we went to Bagneres-de-Bigorre and had a very -- some of the things I can really smile\nbecause they evoke more pleasant memories. It was just we moved from one town to\nanother. In fact we moved from a small town, more confined and less accessible, to a town\nthat was a little freer in access. That was 1941.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape 1\n'' Truck (French).\nTape #2",
        "A: Bagne\u00e9res-de-Bigorre, from 1941 to 1942 was a little bit of a, a spot of light, as I recall the\nwhole period. Because we, although we were registering, under the law, under the new\nVichy laws, we, we moved freely within, within the confines. We went to the movie theatre.\nWe took excursions into the mountains. I remember some mornings with the weather being\nright and nice and refreshing in the mountains. We got up early, five o'clock, and by six\no'clock, we were up on a slope and picked blueberries that we brought back and made jams\nand, and, fruit juices out of and we used them and we ate them. We went out and picked fruit\nand, and, and we raised rabbits in that Villa Suzanne. Food was hard to come by because we\nhad ration cards. Periodically, we would have to stand in line because they were rationing\neverything, even tripes, even liver, even marrow bones. You had to give a ticket for a\nmarrow bone, but then you forego, a marrow bone was something with which you could do,\nmake a good soup, but you may have to forego five ounces of meat which may not have the\nsame impact on your, on your, on your, what you're preparing for, for dinner, you see. You\nhave to trade one with the -- against the other. It was a, a fairly regulated type of life, other\nthan having to go to the authorities and register periodically under the Jewish laws.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: In that town, there was the police station, the police department, the police chief, the police\nin France -- or what you might call the gendarmes. The gendarmes is like state police. They\nare an arm of the government. They do what has to be done to keep law and order. But there\nwas another arm. That was the political arm. The Vichy arm. That was called the \u201cMilice,\u201d\u201d\nthe Militia. They wore their special uniforms, the black uniforms. The police wore their\npolice uniforms. And they were out there to go along with the Vichy government law bent\non pleasing and collaborating with the Germans. This was the treacherous element. The\npresence of the Milice in Bigorre, Bagn\u00e9res-de-Bigorre, was minute. They knew they had a\ngroup of Jewish people there, maybe a thousand, fifteen hundred. They couldn't go anywhere\nwithout a Laisser-passer permit from the police. Therefore, the con game was on. We felt\ncomfortable. We could go to a movie theatre if we wanted to. We could go to a restaurant if\nwe wanted to. We could circulate. We could buy newspapers; and if we had to go to Tarbes,\nBigorre, which was the Prefecture -- that was the seat of the Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, that\n'* Soldiery of the police militia (French).\n'\u00b0 Militia (French).\nDepartment Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, we would get to regularize something or two, or ask for\nwhatever, paper, have to travel to a consulate somewhere.\nWe got these permits, these Laisser-passer, and it was really a game of psychology that was\nplayed constantly to make the people feel as comfortable, as safe, to ease their mind as to\nwhat the future might bring in, in more drastic measures, and like all the other population,\nthe native indigent population of Bagn\u00e9res, we stood in line with them for, for meat and food\nand, and anything else, clothing even. There was, was no difference.",
        "A: Not there.",
        "A: The first time I wore a star was in Drancy later.",
        "A: And 'Juif'* was never worn in the Vichy area. Only in the occupied area north of the\nDemarcation Line.",
        "A: In -- at the end of 1941, just before the end of 1941. Sometime in the fall, we were told that\nwe would have to make preparations towards moving to another assigned residence and that\nwas Cauterets--C-A-U-T-E-R-E-T-S. Also in the same Department, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Hautes-\nPyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. It so happens that at the time in 1941, during the summer and the early fall, I had\nreceived my papers from the United States, affidavit, an affidavit to come to the United\nStates.",
        "A: My aunt had sent me those papers into Vichy, France. I had actually received them earlier\nalready in the beginning, but , but 1t took a while to process papers before you could come to\nthe United States. I was on a waiting quota. And it was sometime in the fall -- no, it was\nactually around the time of Pearl Harbor that I was supposed to get my visa.\n14\nJew (French).",
        "A: Yeah, in, in, in, my aunt from Baltimore. She had already earlier brought an uncle, two\nuncles and two aunts, a brother and sister here with their respective mates. But when I went\nto the consulate, that was on that day of Pearl Harbor. There was no more processing of\ndocuments. So my affidavit to come to the United States fell by the wayside. It expired. So\nthat later after the war, after I had survived, I got fresh papers. But in Bagne\u00e9res, we were\nnotified that we would have to move to Cauterets. And we moved to Cauterets sometime\nafter the first of the year early in '42, probably in the springtime of '42. Again, the two men\nwent there ahead of time and picked a place for us to live. And that place was called La\nPergola. And also the little house, they name the houses in Europe. You know that.\nCall them one thing or another. A name or a tree. The Lindenhouse (ph) or something like\nthat. When we went to Cauterets, we, at that point, frankly, we felt confined. For the first\ntime since Luchon and Bagneres, Cauterets too was a thermal spot. A lot of, about 1500\ninhabitants during the year, but during the summer season, it, it could rise to about maybe\n10,000. Thermal spa. There were about a thousand or 1500 of us sent into that town into\nforced residence. It was called residence assignee. We called it \"R\u00e9sidence Forc\u00e9e.\u201d\"\u201d Even\nfor those people who do not speak French, I think \u201cAssign\u00e9e\u201d\u2019\u00b0 speaks for itself. Well, again\nwe tried to make the best of life. And we did excursions into the mountains to pass the time,\nand we gathered and listened to the radio. Of course, by that time some of the listening of the\nRadio, Radio London was prohibited, but we still heard it. Bumm, bumm, bummm, You\nfamiliar with that? The first bars of the Fifth Symphony. \"Ici Radio Londres.\" This is the\nFree French. Near the Spanish border. Hardly a mile or two from the Spanish border. When\nwe went into a little excursion in the morning, again recognize let's go up in the mountain,\nmake a little picnic or that sort of thing. This was all to pass the time as pleasantly as we\ncould, because if you were sitting there worrying about when will the Milice come and when\nwill things change, you could really fall into such doldrums and such despair and depression\nthat you wouldn't even be able to think straight anymore. And life is life while it's going on.\nThere's just, there's just not enough impetus to, to, to make you think of the most dire\ncircumstances, because you have a mountain surrounding you and you have friends with you\nand, and you wake up in the morning and you hope for the next day. But there's not that\nimmediate threat hanging over you. So you make the best of life and you say \u201cHopefully,\nthis will end soon.\u201d Radio London gave us a little hope -- a note from here, from there would\nfilter through that the resistance 1s starting to, to, to jell you know. And it was not until the\nfall, something in September, that the Mayor of that town sent the word out to us, the Jews,\nthat within a day or two, they expect a raid by the Milice and the Gestapo.\n'\u00b0 Forced Residence (French).\n' Assigned (French).\n'\u2019 Here is Radio London (French).",
        "A: We never met the mayor. But what he did at the time was a great thing. He notified us and\nleft it up to us to do what, he wasn't going to say, \u201cI am going to put a train at your disposal\nand send you all out of here or trucks\u201d or something. Do what you can. I just want you to\nknow that this place is no longer safe for you. A handful of us took to the mountains, 1n fact,\nand we stayed a couple of days and couple of nights up in the mountains. Periodically\nsending someone down. Once I went down, then somebody else, to find out what's going on.\nThe first few hours nothing had changed in town and the people were still there, although\nvery apprehensive. By that time, the mood had drastically changed. The parents had to\nconsole their kids. They had to tell them, \u201c\u201cWe may leave.\u201d They started packing. Some of us,\nas I said, took to the mountains, a handful.",
        "A: Stayed! Two days later when finally the messenger that we had sent out came back and said,\n\"It's finished. They were there. Most people are gone.\" That's when we came back from the\nmountains. In fact, the message was that when I knew they were going down to the\nmountains, \"Go over the to Frajermauers and see if they are still there.\" Low and behold, the\nFrajermauers were still there. They had Belgian documentations. Those who apatrides, '*\nmeans stateless, Polish, German, Austrian, were taken. Those who had French, Belgian, and\nLuxembourg nationality were left. Another psychological ploy to tell them, \"You are safe.\"\nIn the final analysis, no one was. Because when you look at the book of the Klarsfelds,\u2019\u201d\nmany people do not know that, but there were Americans and Swiss and Finns and Swedes\nand Norwegians who were Jews deported from Drancy. Those passports didn't matter at all\nto the Germans. But the ploy was there at this particular point. When you look back at this\nwhole period -- the Nazi period, the deportations -- you see one psychological aspect of the\nprogress of that dehumanization after the other.",
        "A: I went right to La Pergola, saw the Frajermauers. They said, \"You know, we are here\nbecause we are Belgians, but we don't know how long.\" In fact, they were not Belgians. The\nchildren were, the two daughters. That's why they left the family with them. \u201cBut you cannot\nstay here.\u201d \u201cBut let's wait and see what we can think about.\u201d I went up to the attic and hid in\n'\u00ae Without nationality, stateless (French).\n\" Serge and Beate Klarsfeld.\nthe attic. There was a room up there with a cot, a cot that had no sheets or anything, just a\nsmall mattress on it and some storage, a storage room it was mainly -- and there were\nsuitcases and all kinds of discarded objects that weren't even ours. They were, these were of\nthe owner of, of the, the building and I hid up there for two days and two nights. The door\nwas not a regular door, but it was slats of wood and you could peep between the slats and it\nhad a padlock on the outside. My distant cousin, Anny, the daughter of Mr. Frajermauer,\nlocked me in. And the next morning I hear footsteps coming up, and I peep through that\nthing to that crack and I see two gendarmes, not Milice, local gendarmes from the police,\ncome up with Anny and I hear them ask her, \"Who has the key to that lock?\" And there she\nis, and I peeped and then I stood sideways so that they shouldn't notice, and I had to be very\ncareful not to move or make any crackling noise. You know these, these wooden planks,\nthey can easily give you away. And I hear her say, \"We don't store anything up here. We\ndon't even have the key for this, but 1f you want to break it open, go ahead and do it.\" And I\nhear him say to her, \"You know where your friend 1s still, don't you?\" Because they knew\nthere was another person living under that address because we had to register with the police\nhere, just like we did in Bagn\u00e9res-de-Bigorre. That was the idea of a assigned residence,\nwhere you would register periodically so that they know you have not left this assigned\nresidence. There was a law against leaving this assigned residence.\nAnd she said, \"We don't even have the key.\" And I have never talked about that because\nthat's something so private, but I guess eventually that has to be brought up, too. And by the\ntime this is shown, well, the person herself will not be aware of it, but it has to be, it has to be\ntold, I think. And he said, \"The only way I will not try to break that lock open if you kiss me\"\nto the girl. That was 1942. She was 20 years old. A 20-year old distant cousin of mine. In\nfact, I liked the girl. \"If you kiss me.\" And she said, \"No, don't ask me to do that\"--\"Ne\ndemandez \u00a2a pas, ne me demandez pas faire \u00a2a.\" \"Well, then I'll break the lock open.\" She\nsays, \"Well, go ahead and do it.\" She didn't want him to, to give away that there is somebody\nin there. He said, \"Well, I guess you are right. I guess you are not lying to me.\" But\nregardless, he grabbed her and kissed her and lifted her skirt and tried to molest her, tried to\nhave sex with her. The second gendarme said to him -- and I hear all this -- \"Leave that girl\nalone and let's go.\" That's when he let go of her. And they all three went down. And I stayed\nup there another night. And then when they came back to tell me that it's time for me to get\nout of there, I am pretty safe, one evening, I kissed Anny and I said, \"You almost got raped\non account of me.\" She says, \"I had to save you. I had to save you.\" \"If I had to do it,\" she\nsays, \"I'll just have to do it. I didn't want them to get into that attic.\" She lives today in\nAntwerp. She has a family. An evening later -- the same evening, actually, because I couldn't\nstay another day--I left on foot from Cauterets at night. I had taken a rucksack, belongings,\nleft on foot from Cauterets. Guess where I went to. Bagn\u00e9res-de-Bigorre. Back to Bagne\u00e9res-\nde-Bigorre. Why? I knew a family there that had remained there. The family Spira, S-P-I-R-\nA. Their daughter today lives in Kew Gardens, New York; and we visit periodically. And\nanother daughter lives in Israel. Susie in New York and Recha in Israel. I went, left at night,\nheading toward Bagneres-de-Bigorre. I walked all night. I went through Lourdes. That's in\nthat same area, slept under a tree during that night, resting up, next day during the day, I\nwent to the Spira's, made contact with them and spent with them several weeks, all the time\ntrying to secure a false identification so that I should escape to Switzerland. Living with the\nSpira's, I lived in hiding. I didn't go out. Maybe, no, I never went out at all at that particular\npoint. The father went out to do the shopping and the marketing and everything else, bread\nand stand in line. Mr. Spira, Max Spira -- Mendel Spira, actually. And I stayed with these\nfriends for several weeks, maybe five or six weeks. At one time, we feared a police raid into\nthe house to just check out. It was during the night and the two girls and I slept in the, the\ntwo daughters and I were in the attic, slept in the same room. I on a, bedded out on the floor,\nand the girls on the bed, and at that point when we heard the noises, Susie just recently\nreminded me, \"Leo, remember what you did when you, when that noise came?\" I said, \"No.\nNo. I must have been hiding somewhere.\" She said, \"You opened the window and you\nwalked out on the roof.\" She said, \"Do you remember when one morning you woke up and\nnext to you there was a dead rat.\" I said, \"Yes, I do. How did that happen?\" She said, \"Well,\nin the middle of the night, you remember, we heard that noise and something on you and you\nstarted banging and banging and you had killed a rat.\" That was right next to me. She\nbrought back these things to me and I said, \"Wait a minute, Leo, you went through some\nthings that today, you wouldn't even believe you could have done it.\" They were good\npeople, the Spira's. They harbored me. We remained friends for a long time. Still are, with\nthe daughter and I in New York. But when I had, finally had my false ID papers,",
        "A: Mr. Spira knew a person in town who was connected with an underground situation. And\nthey procured these papers for me, for some other people, including a friend who was part of\nthat distant family by the name of Albert Herszkowitz.\u201d\u201d He later was deported in the same\ntrain that I was in. And we made our way to the Swiss border, having already through that\ncontact with the cards, found out whom to contact near the Swiss border, near Evian-les-\nBains. A farmer's family, the son had smuggled, a young man in his 20s, had smuggled\npeople into Switzerland. We arrived in Evian-les-Bains, looked for the address. In fact, he\npicked up us up at the, at the railroad station, because we had notified him so that he, should\ndirectly come to his farm, spent a couple of days on his farm, and two days later, he took us\nup into the mountains to right to the Swiss border in the mountains. We walked some 40\nsome hours there or maybe even more. Heavy shoes. We spent one night in the mountains,\nsleeping on a, sort of an incline, a slope and that night, that was in October 1942, and that\nnight a light snow fell. When we woke up we were covered with sort of a rime of icy stuff.\nNext morning we crossed into Switzerland. This man had instructed us, this young man. In\nfact, he left us up there, five of us. Went back to his house. He says, \"All you have to do is\n\u201d The interviewee notes that various spellings of this name occur in several records: In\none, Albert is listed as Abram Herskovicz. In another, Albert\u2019s brother Mordka had been\nrecorded as Herzkowicz.\njust cross this thing. You are at the border.\" From here on in, we are on our own, simply\nbecause he as a Frenchman doesn't want to be caught be a Swiss being a smuggler. He would\nbe arrested. He took us to, we paid for that. We crossed into Switzerland and we had been no\nlonger than 10 minutes walking on the Swiss side towards the valley, we knew. It goes down\nand it goes into the valley.\nWhen the path goes down constantly in a little serpentine, we go into the valley. That stands\nto reason. Before we could even reach half point, we had gone maybe 10 or 15 minutes, the\nSwiss border police, they wear these big hats. They look like scout hats. Like the Canadians\nsome -- wear the Mounties, similar -- and shepherd dogs. So the dogs started standing up,\nand he gave them some command or whatever that is. The dog listens to these commands\nevidently, and we knew that if we were attempting anything like running or anything else,\nbut who would run in Switzerland? After all, we are in free Switzerland. We are in neutral\nterritory. We had heard that they had taken in German deserters and, and, fliers that had been\nshot down or had been on mission over France and had to -- and were shot down and made it\nto the border and were accepted in Switzerland. Why run from a Swiss? We were coming to\nthem and said, \"Hello, we are here. Here we are. Now we are in your country -- a free\ncountry, right?\" Wrong. We were taken down into the valley into a little town called St.\nGingolph which 1s a border town. Half of the town is French and half of it is Swiss. On the\nSwiss side, it so happens the cemetery is located. So when somebody dies on the French\nside, they got to take him across the border, aboard the border post. They lift the border post\n-- they inspect coffins even, to see that there is no contraband. At least in those days, they\ndid. Now maybe that's eased up. St. Gingolph -- G-I-N-G-O-L-P-H. Exactly across from\nMontreux, which is in Switzerland on the other side of the lake, Lac Leman. That's the Lake\nof Geneva. But we were in Switzerland, in the Swiss part of St. Gingolph, taken to a police\noffice. And there is a captain. And this captain was a rock. A cold rock. A stone. He had eyes\nand he had a nose and he had a mouth, but he had no feelings. We cried. We begged. We\ntried to take his hand and kiss his hand. We were young kids. We kneeled. You name it.\nEverything bureaucratic. \"How did you get over? Who helped you?\" \"Nobody!\" All these\ninquiries. \"How did you make it up here? How -- how did you get there? Where did you\noriginate?\" \"Well, we came from Evian and walked across.\" \"Who showed you the way?\"\n\"Nobody! We were in these mountains for days.\" We didn't have to tell him it was just a\nnight or two. Nothing doing. Enough. In effect, I know the words that we said. We said in as\nmany words that we would like to stay here until the end of the war in one of your camps.\nWe know you have camps for internees, refugees, just to work and for food. We don't need\npay. All we want to know that we are there and can live, wait out the war. Not an emotion,\nnothing! Nothing at all! Just motions and, and, and very quick questions and bureaucracy.\nThey sent us back to Vichy France. And the Vichy France gendarme took us over at the\nborder post in St. Gingolph and brought us into the French gendarmerie,\u201d' and we spent a\nnight in their cells. I had taken my shoes off. I had high shoes. I had taken my shoes off. I\n*! The total force of the gendarmes (French).\nhad to peel my socks off my feet. I had bloody feet from walking in the mountains. I know I\nhad because they hurt, and I know I had it because I could feel my socks sticking to the shoe\nand a couple of women were among them that were sent back, and my friend, Al\nHerszkowicz, Albert. And from there by train, we were taken to a camp whose name you\nhave heard many, many times: Rivesaltes. I met some people recently here at a meeting in\nWashington.\nThis woman, she was in Rivesaltes; same experience from Switzerland. Her brother, her\nhusband, and when she heard that I went out and talked about it in Columbia to a group on a\nShoah exercises, she came up to me and she says, \"You brought back a whole period of my\nlife when you mentioned the word 'Rivesaltes'.\" Taken to Rivesaltes in October. Separated\nwomen from men. Also again, Polish, German, group from -- Luxembourgers. Milly Cahen,\na friend, the young lady whom I had befriended in the train from Switzerland to Rivesaltes,\nshe was in, in an adjoining section of the camp and we spoke across the barbed wire. Later\nwhen I went to Europe with my family and we visited Luxembourg, and we went to visit her\nhusband. I hadn't known that, but Milly just a few weeks earlier had been killed in an\nautomobile accident. Never got to saw Milly again. A bright young person. Her husband,\nvery saddened, told me that she had just had that violent death. Anyway, from Rivesaltes,\nafter a few weeks -- well, not so many few weeks; just a couple of weeks, we were taken to\nDrancy. Now in Rivesaltes -- again, I didn't go to Drancy just because they wanted me to go\nto Drancy. I was hiding out in the camp. Yes, again. \"Where will you hid out?\" they said. I\nsaid, \"Well, let me try.\" Barracks have a ceiling, but there is a triangular roof; something that\nlooks triangle where you have an ungulated roof going this way and that way. And between\nthat peak and the barrack, there is a -- is it plywood or plaster board ceiling? I climbed up\nthere and lay down on that flat with my rucksack. I had to have that with me. Somehow\nthat's, this was my apartment. This was my life. That's what I had to hold on to. If I didn't\nhave that, I didn't have anything anymore, you see. This was ludicrous, really, in hindsight,\nbecause you only carry or shlep~ around things that you don't need. But you hold on to\nthings. I was lying up there and hearing them go and count. And I was missing. My name\nwasn't, I wasn't there. I wasn't in the barrack when we checked in the evening. We were\nchecked in, in the evening as to presence. In the morning I wasn't there. And I hear them\ntalk: \"Ou est tu? Ne cachez pas.\"--\"Where are you? Don't hide. It won't work.\"--\"Ca ne\nmarchera pas.\" \"We know where you are.\"--\"Nous savons ou vous \u00e9tes.\" \"Tu est\"--They\ndon't \"vouvoi\" you, they \"toutoi\u201d you. And there I am trying not to breathe even because I\nfelt if I, breathing maybe, But unfortunately, and I could have expected it, should have\nprobably, some of that plaster board started falling down and it fell down from there you\nknow, and I really heard it trickle down like...\n* Jerk, drag (Yiddish).\n* Interviewee explains that the polite or formal plural, \u201cvoivou,\u201d wasn\u2019t used.\nAnd so they came in the area and said, \"We know you are up there. Why don't you just come\ndown and make it easier.\" I didn't get punished or anything. I climbed down, climbed down\nand they said, \"You tried, but it just didn't work.\" To them it didn't really matter, because to\nthem people came and went constantly. This was just another transport they had to do, and\nthey wanted to just numerically have the right amount of people and to know that nobody\nhad escaped, because that would reflect on their efficiency. So when they have x amount of\npeople to take and count it in the barracks the night before and the next day these people\nhave to be transported, so that number better be the same number that you counted the night\nbefore. That's all they were concerned with. Not the punishing me with -- if they had\npunished me and put me in a brig, I would have preferred that because my deportation would\nhave been delayed. But that's not the case. They took us to the train and took us to Drancy on\nthe 20 or the 22nd of October. We were taken by transport -- passenger train, not cattle cars.\nAnother ploy to make us feel are we going to camp so, by that time all of us had been used to\ncamps and those situations so much, that another camp was just a continuation of -- an\nexpected situation. So Drancy -- by that time, we in the south had heard of Drancy but did\nnot quite realize the immensity of the camp and the tragedy involved in that preparation\ntoward deportation. It took us a day to get up there. We arrived in Drancy. Again in that\ntrain, several times going to the wash room, I looked at the situation over. Escape was\nalways on my mind. Maybe this is the, the deep urge to live and, and experience. But there\nwas no, there was no getting away from that bathroom because the gendarmes stood right in\nfront of the door when somebody went to the bathroom. They were in the car with us. It was\nnot like the gendarmes were riding in another car ahead, or in the back so that they should be\nthere in case of emergency. They were with us in the train. And you know how the French\ntrains are, were at that time anyway. Each compartment had their own door to walk in, so\nwas no use trying it there and again, let's wait until the next camp and see what we can do\nlater. We arrived in Drancy and checked in. The checking-in process in Drancy was, well, a\nfirst step n a, in a real dehumanization process. Number one, when we arrived there, the\nfaces that we saw, the, the eyes with queries in them and, and a lot of questions, \"Where are\nyou coming from? How is outside? What did you, what do you think? What news do you\nhave?\"\nEverybody gathering about a new group of arrivals because they may, they may have\nsomething to convey and we went through a barrack process of checking in which would\nalso mean taking your watch away, your rings, certain belongings, money. And another\npsychological ploy: giving you a receipt for the things that they took from you, with the\nadmonition, \"Don't lose that!\" because you will never get them back. That is your receipt that\nhas a number on it. It had a number on it. Just imagine that! And people there tried to sort of\nwhisper to us that this isn't good here. And we knew, as we came in, the mood immediately,\nit wasn't Rivesaltes any longer. It was not Rivesaltes by any stretch of the imagination.\nDrancy was a complex that was built to be a military barracks facility. It was a multi-story\ncomplex almost like a stadium because it was round. But due to the war, beginning of the\nwar, that building, that structure, was never finished. So the places, the rooms that they put\nus In were wide open, concrete floor with piping laying around and half-installed electrical\nwires, half-installed plumbing, makeshift, and it was concrete. Windows -- no, no windows,\nThere were no panes in the windows. It was just the opening where the windows were\nsupposed to go in the frames later. That wasn't done so it was all open, breezy. And on this\nconcrete, straw. Men, women, children together. Minimal facilities to wash. Community, one\ntrough like, where you, where the water ran down from in trickle. Minimum toilet facilities.\nWatchtowers. Barbed wire. Suburb of Paris close to quote \u201ccivilization.\u201d Minimal food\ndistribution. That's where we were issued the Jewish star. This 1s where we had to wear it.\nThe population in northern France and the occupied zone had to wear that already in the\ntowns, streets, everywhere. But we having just arrived in Drancy had to put that on because\nthis was the administration of the German authorities. \"Juif\" --- French for \"Jew.\" In\nHolland, it was \"Jood;\" in Germany, \"Jude.\" I cannot fail to mention that, because I always\nmention that. And it has to be mentioned over and over and over again, that the German\npropaganda told you that a Jew, you can smell them a mile away. A Jew, you know when\nyou see a Jew, from a distance, you can smell him, you see his actions, you see, there's no\nway where you can mistake a Jew for what he is. So the obvious thing, question is, it's a\nrhetorical question and even young children to whom I speak periodically in a museum or in\nschool when I ask that and I say, so what is your next question then. And they would say,\n\"So why did you need that star?\" And some young people, eight, nine year old, says, \"I know\nwhy.\" I said, \"Tell me.\" He says, \"To humiliate you.\" And for a child that's a big statement.\nHe understands that. So we had this star and we were easily recognizable, yet we had to wear\nit. So that destroys their whole thesis, their whole propaganda, and their propaganda can be\ndestroyed in thousands of ways because nothing ever made sense. It only dwelt on the, on\nthe, on the emotions.",
        "A: We saw utter despair, uncertainty, acts of, of aggression, pushing, shoving, end of rifle butts,\nand threats. And it wasn't until I saw a newborn baby being shot like a clay pigeon, and the\nmother being killed too because she threw herself into the path of the bullet, that I spoke to\nmy friend, Manfred Silberwasser. And I said, \"Manfred, if this can happen in Drancy, what\ncan we expect where we're going to? This is France. This is not yet Germany.\" There was no\nquestion of Auschwitz yet, because Auschwitz, the rumors that had come back to us were,\nwere we didn't even want to think about that. We didn't even want to believe that, that that\nwas possible. But this was November 1942; and in January 1942, the, the, the Wannsee\nConference had decided on the Final Solution of which the news had only trickled down to\nus. And everybody was always suspicious, leery of that, that cannot happen, take people for\nthousands of miles to gas them to kill them and then the -- always came back that there were\nalways rumors in the First World War that turned out to be just that -- rumors. And I said,\n\"Fred, what we hear about what's possible, how they're going to... And we must do\nsomething. Now if these are rumors and we prove to be wrong at the end of the war, then so\nbe it. I would rather be wrong at the end of the war than not be prepared now to do\nsomething about this.\" They take your watch away, your toothbrush, glasses, eyeglasses.\nThey would leave you the eyeglasses, but when somebody had very thick eyeglasses where\nit was very necessary for that person to carry to see your hand in front of your eyes, those\nthey took away. That's the torture. Somebody that had two eyes that needed for reading\nglasses, they left them those. They were very selective as to how they moved that, that\npsychological ploy. And compacts. A compact to a woman and lipstick to a woman is, 1s\nsomething to hold onto. Her person is a person. Without that she is not fully a person. Or the\nsame thing for a -- combs they took away from us, because they could be a weapon. But we\ndidn't need it anyway. They shaved our hair.",
        "A: Well, on the sixth of November. We had one sign while we were there of something hopeful\nwhen towards the beginning of November, the skywriters were flying overhead in the Paris\nsky and I also later witnessed bombardment. But these skywriters wrote \"Le Huit,\u201d Le Hutt,\nL-E H-U-I-T\" which means \"the eighth.\" And on the eighth of November, on a Sunday,\nNovember the eighth, the Allies landed in North Africa in 1942. So they were playing games\nwith those things, but they just wanted to let the French population know that on the eighth,\nyou can expect something. They had these little things going on periodically to encourage.",
        "A: The day before they took us.",
        "A: Thursday the fifth, in the morning, they notified us that we will be leaving. In the afternoon\nof the fifth, Thursday, took us to the train station of Drancy, to Le Bourget, in trucks. Again,\nwe looked how we can jump off that truck, but that would have been of foolishness because\nthe guards were right on there and anybody who would jump would be shot at. And people --\nwe, my friend and I, when I say \u201cwe,\u201d had a, an advantage, namely that we were not with\nfamily. A husband would not jump off the truck and leave his wife and children there. That's\nfor sure. Or a young child that is without parents will not try to run away because he or she\nwas told that where you are going, you are going to meet your parents, and vice versa.\nParents were taken and were told where you are going you're going to meet your children.\nBecause the kids were taken out of the school and brought in and the parents, again \"tohoo\nva-vohoo.\" And we were taken to the train and put into the trains in the evening. Now it\ncould have been 5:00, 6:00, or 7:00, somewhere around this time. November it gets dark\nearly. It was a, a sort of a misty type northern France fall, raw day. Put into the trains at 50\n* Bight (French).\nper cattle car. I understand from other people who were in the east, in those cases, they even\nhad a hundred per cattle car. Fifty per cattle car which was bad enough of a, what I like to\ncall, microcosm of humanity abandoned by the world. Everybody, old and young and from\nall professions, from all walks of life, from all economic strata, from every segment of the\nJewish population. Children alone. Crippled people. People on stretchers. Counted out 50 per\ncar. Now, Linda, imagine yourself in a situation where you and a husband and two children\nare at the end of rifle butts pushed into a cattle car, counted out, \", 48, 49, 50. In!\" Fifty-one\nwould have been the other child. This other child does not go with his parents and sibling\ninto this car. This child is at this point separated and put into the next car, counted out as\nnumber one going into the next car. You might say they are separated by one car length but\nin fact they are separated by an ocean. They are worlds apart. And a good chance is -- a bad\nchance -- is that that child will never see the parents again, and the parents will never see that\nchild again. And the trauma of that family is indescribable. I can say words; they are not\nanswerable. I can express thoughts; they are unthinkable. Even to express them is almost a\nludicrous endeavor. Dehumanization to the worst degree!\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: They shut them closed, yeah. These sliding doors, they were closed shut. And from the\noutside, just latch-locked -- heavy metal latches. And that was in the evening. Now, the good\nthing would have been for this train to leave. But it didn't. It did not leave until next morning,\nabout 12 hours later, 12 or 14 hours later, in the early morning. As I see the report in the\nKlarsfeld book, it was something like 8:05. Because there was a precise schedule. But to be\nall night in a waiting standing train is much more torture than being riding. When you are\nriding, you, you see progress, you see something is happening. Sitting there is like being the\nexpression \"sitting ducks.\" And, of course, in that particular confinement you have a whole\ngamut of emotions running their course. You have resignation, you have despair, openly\nexpressed; a lot of crying, a lot of moaning, some praying. A young man with a gangrenous\nleg and knee attempting to make love to a young woman in the train. He did that in the camp,\ntoo. Call that an expression of life. Call it an expression of, perhaps, resignation of what else\ncan happen. Call it whatever you will. It was an act, perhaps this was the, because perhaps\nthis was the one human act that really happened there. He didn't force that person. She didn't\ncry or shout or resist. But it points up that what happened in that train was, all privacy of a\nhuman being was, had been taken away. There's no more privacy. How can you, with one\nbucket in the center of that car, of that cattle car? Everybody relieving themselves in that one\nbucket -- man, women, and children -- because you had to. You had reached the common\ndenominator of dehumanization. There was no such thing as \"I am a man, I can't show it,\"\nand, \"I am a woman, I can't do that.\" And people were still thinking that there was something\nof humaneness ahead of them. We recently saw that film about one remembrance. The one\nstark scene that I -- my family didn't want me to see that at all, and I only saw glimpses of it,\nlike snitches of it. But at the end, I saw that one scene where the woman open, stands in the\nopen door of that cattle car confronted by the SS officer at the arrival in Auschwitz or\nBirkenau. And she said to the person, \"We have seven dead people in that car.\" And he\nlaughed and said, \"Well, these are the lucky ones.\" That points it all up. That that woman\nspeaking to this SS officer thought she was really confronting a human being who could\nunderstand this tragedy. And this is why people throughout the transport were trying to talk\nus out of running away. We had decided to make our getaway.",
        "A: My friend and I.",
        "A: We hadn't moved. We were squatting, standing. We moved in human waste. The stench is\nstill up here, and it's, it's powerful. There were three of us who planned, but two only\nescaped. And some tried to talk us out of it. \"Look what can happen to us if they find you\nescaped. They will kill us all!\" And our answer at this point was, \"So what do you think\nawaits us, anyway?\" They were some in previous transports who tried to escape. And one\nman was caught under the wheels and was then thrown back into the car with two legs\namputated to bleed to his death. And people died anyway. Malnutrition. Maybe some\nsuicides. There was this woman in crutches in that train, pointing her crutch at me 1n, in, in\nweapons style, like a weapon, like a dagger -- pointing it and telling me, \"Que Dieu vous\ngarde!\" -- \"Let God keep you! You must go. You must do what you want to do. Don't let\nanybody talk you out of it.\" You be-- To her, we were a symbol. We were a symbolism.\nPerhaps it will succeed, and then we can tell something about it. A woman in crutches. Every\nbit in her 70s, with streaky gray hair and deep, sad, dark, sad eyes, actually consoling a child\nthat was there without a parent. I don't know whether that father or mother was along. The\nchild was there crying, and she was in charge of that child. And Tony was there -- a distant\ncousin of mine -- and her husband. She was the one that had sewed on my star in the camp.\nAnd under the star, I had a half a pound note of Irish pounds. Under the star, under this star,\nthere was a half a Irish pound note that I had salvaged over the last several years, sent to me\nby an aunt who had immigrated from Austria to Galway. She had sent me that to Belgium,\nperiodically, and I saved that one. Didn't want to spend it or exchange it, just for an\nemergency. Didn't even know what the value of it was. But 1t was something to hold on to.\nTony sewed that onto me; said, \"Why do you want that there?\" I said, \"I want it under the\nstar. Sometime when I tear this star off, 1f I do run away, I would like to have that. Maybe I\ncan buy some bread or some -- buy a train ticket with it, or what have you.\" But it was some,\nsomething. And we planned on our getaway.",
        "A: I have repeated that so often, and I don't want to over-dramatize. I don't want to be pleading\nany kind of heroship or anything like that. But the kids, when I speak about it, to them this is\nlike an adventure. We are not heroes. I don't even exult in the word \"surviving\" because it\nspeaks of something so, so exclusive. You survive. How many did survive, really? So, it's\nalmost like you are putting down those who couldn't survive, and you exult in that. It was\nfear, utter fear, that prevailed upon us to do that. Two little words: fear and luck. One has to\nmotivate you, and the other one 1s there to hopefully let you succeed. Luck, you have. This is\nluck. And it's only --",
        "A: First, I would like for people to understand that if the hero that they, somebody whom they\ncall hero -- whether they look at a person tells about it, or a monument that that, of some\nhero of years gone by --only that person knew really how scared he really was, you see. You\nmake a hero of somebody, but that person knew deep down that there was a lot of fear.\nHeroism isn't something that comes sort of at the spur of the moment. How did we do it?\nThere was only one way of doing it. Other than having tools to cut out the bottom of the train\nor cut out the ceiling, there was only one way -- the obvious way -- a window. And these\nwindows were squares. Perhaps 24 by 18, something like that. But you see, in cattle cars\nthey are normally called \"huit, quarante\u201d\u201d\u201d -- eight horses, or 40 men, in military terms. Both\nwindows had bars, straight bars. Two bars: the one on the one side facing the other track that\nruns parallel had barbed wire. That would not have prevented us from using that window,\nbecause a barbed wire that's rusty can easily be bent back and forth and can be eliminated. A\nbarbed wire can be cut by bending back and forth a few times, and then you have just the\nbars to contend with. But that window was not in our plan, because that was the window that\nwas next to the other track and you don't want to jump when you jump onto a track.\nEspecially from a moving train, because you can't really take that big chance. I mean, you\nwant to succeed. The left side -- the north side, as it were, because we were traveling east --\nwas the one that faced the ravine, the bushes that are alongside and the telephone post, and\nso on. That's the window we chose through which we will make our getaway, we hoped to\nmake our getaway. And as soon as the train, we had all night to think about that. We were\nwalking in, in, around in miserable conditions.\nI mean, we were sliding back and forth. So the only way we tried in the morning to move\nthese bars, but it wasn't possible. We decided the only way that we could possibly do that is\nby trying to twist them or to bend them forcefully or forcibly.\nAnd we dunked, we took our sweaters and we dunked them in human wastes, made them\nwet, to create a tensile cloth. Dry cloth you cannot wring too well. A towel, for instance. But\na wet cloth can be wrung and wrung and wrung, and it twists and twists until the moisture\nhas dripped out entirely until it's dry. That sort of principle is applied in a tourniquet style\nwhen you use it on an arm. We used that as a tourniquet. So if you figure that two bars, you\ntwist that sweater around the bars and then you go twisting, twisting, twisting until you can,\nWe helped each other. We tried that several times. It was no give yet. There was no give yet.\nBut we hoped that something will happen. And then we moved in the side and see maybe it\ngets loose a little bit. But after a while, when we twisted again, again, we gave up for five\nminutes to catch our breath and we were perspiring. We were working under pressure. This\nwas our getaway. This was life. There the countryside flew by us, that bucolic countryside --\nFrance, the fields. And this was -- we were approaching champagne country, you know. The\narea of lusciousness. But here we were going to certain death, which now we know. At that\n> Bight, forty (French).\ntime, we only speculated. But I am glad we did speculate. It didn't let us fall into some sort of\nlethargy, like a lot of people were. And we twisted and twisted, and then finally we saw that\nglimmer of hope where the bars 1n the frame started to move ever so slightly, ever so\nslightly. And rust came out falling from that fitting that it was in, the hole that it 1s set in.\nRust came out. Now, we never hoped to get the bar out of there; because they are set 1n like\nan inch or so, half an inch. But we hoped to, them to be bending. We worked for a while, and\nwe saw them ever so slightly bend inward. Then we used our hands to move them apart\nagain, so that they should start loosening. And it did that! We moved them back into the\nproper position. We went back and twisted again and this time, the bending inward was ever\nso slightly more of a bend. And we put that again, did that. We worked all day, being\nmindful of the fact that if the train would have to come to a stop, these things would have to\nbe put into proper position. Because then the guards would walk out of the first and the last\ncar. They were in the first car--that was a passenger car--and the last. These were Gestapo,\nand these were the German guards. And, of course, French police. The French police, French\ncollaborators.\nThat's a chapter by itself. Towards the late afternoon, those bars had moved apart, through\nour efforts, enough where we could see our way squeezing through it. And we put them back\ninto the original position, just again in case the train would come to a stop and the guards\nwould come up and inspect. One time the train stopped at a station, and the people there\nseeing it wanted to reach me. We shouted \"Water!\" The -- they didn't let them get close\nbecause these people were aware of three transports going by there every week. Some of the\npeople were aware of that, and sometimes that awareness helped communicate simply\nbecause some of us. And I didn't do it, because I didn't leave family and friends. But some of\nthem, husbands or wives or children, whoever had left families behind in Drancy or hiding\nout somewhere, they would drop envelopes, and the people would pick them up and would\nput stamps on them and mail them. Or just notes: \"We are going away. We are going away.\nDon't forget us.\" Cryptic notes like this, you see. But they didn't let them approach. We only\nmade one stop. In hindsight, I see exactly the time when the train -- because it's in the book -\n- when the train would arrive at the German border, and the German guards would take over\neverything by schedule. But we did, Finally, under the cover of the darkness -- 1t could have\nbeen begin around seven o'clock, and it was dark at that time already. We did climb out of\nthat cattle car. My cousin Tony, distant cousin Tony Gutefreund handed me my rucksack\nthrough. I was the first one to step out. I dropped down, held onto that bar, and then reached\nmy way to the back of that cattle car to the coupling. Reaching for the coupling with my foot,\nand standing and holding on to this, and then holding to that metal tron -- wrought iron --\nstepladder that leads up to the roof, holding on to this, and stepping on those. I was already\nhalf free. I was standing there reaching my rucksack around, putting it only with one strap on\nmy shoulder, and my friend came next. He did the same procedure. In fact, I told him\nalready, \"Now reach for the coupling -- la coupler.\u201d\u201d\u00b0 I stepped over to the next one, and he\n\u00b0\u00b0 Coupling (French).\nused this one. Our third friend that was going to go with us either never had the, the, got up\nthe nerve to do it, or perhaps he was noticed by someone that he was reaching out, because at\nthat very moment or just seconds later, the car, the train went into a slight curve on the north\nside. That's the side we intended to jump. And the curve is like a concave curve, which\nserves the guards as a means to inspect the whole length of the car, the train. They are\nshining their flashlights up and down from the back and the front, and they cross somewhere\nin the middle, sort of a floodlight effect, to see that everything on the outside of that car is --\nor those cattle trains, cattle cars, is still under control. It is possible that they noticed that,\nbecause at that moment when the car, the train had come into that curve and somewhat\nslowed down--let's say, from 75 to 60 miles an hour or whatever, my friend standing on this\ncoupling was the first to jump. And I jumped right after him.\nBut at that very moment, we heard whistles and shots fired. Up to this day, I think that one or\ntwo things happened to our friend. He was caught in the crossfire of these beams and just\ndidn't get out of the window. He was attempting to, maybe he was a little heavier than us.\nWhatever the case. Or they may have caught him. Those shots, however, were fired before\nthe train came to a halt, because a few seconds later, the train came to a screeching halt and\nwe heard more shots fired -- probably in the air. Warning shots. I don't think it was at our\nfriend because I don't think he really ever made it out of the window. But that's conjecture.\nAnd voices: \"Let's look for...Let's search...Run up and down.\u201d We were lying there in that\nravine and that wet, tall grass, holding our breath together in a moment that seemed like\nhours. But it was just a few minutes. And it wasn't until we heard no longer any voices and\nwe heard the train being set into motion again that we let our breath out. For the first time in\nso many weeks, we were what you might call \"free;\" but at least -- if not entirely free, at least\naway from the train that was taking us to certain death. Because only 72 hours earlier, 48\nhours earlier, we were there in utter despair, put into a train. This was a total metamorphosis\nin a few minutes. We tried to make our way, and did make our way, into a village nearby. By\nthat time, everything was closed. And because of blackout -- war time -- the windows were\nblue and blackened out. And we went to this big shop, rapped on the door, and an apprentice,\na young man, came to the door and told us that there was no bread, they are closed. And we\nsaid, \"Yes, we do not want bread at this moment. But we would like for you to tell us where\ndoes the priest of the village live.\" And he said, \"Wait a minute.\" -- \"Un moment.\" \"Just a\nminute.\" And he went in and got his jacket, came out with us and took us to the priest of the\nvillage, to his residence -- like a little house sacristy. We rapped, rapped on the door. We\nwalked in, and the priest wanted to know, \"What brings you here?\" The baker said, \"These\nyoung men asked for your house.\" Then he walked off. \"Qu'est qu'il se passe?\" -- \"What's\ngoing on?\" At that time, we had torn off our star. We didn't want to walk there with that. And\nwe felt later that this priest, that as good as he was and the shelter that he did give us, would\nhave probably be a little more reassured if we had the star. He would know we were\nescapees rather than maybe agents sent there to find out if he is really into helping people.\nWe told him we escaped from the train. He said, \"Ah, oui. Trois fois par semaine.\"--\"Three\ntimes a week,\" he said. Unfortunately, we never knew his name. But names didn't matter at\nthat particular time. He didn't know ours either. So, he said, \"Oh, yeah, three times per week.\nAnd you did escape from that.\" \"What we want is, can we stay for the night?\" He said,\n\"What you first want is, is make yourself clean a little bit.\"\nWe came in. We were -- smelled to high heaven. We were infested. \"You may also be\nhungry,\" he said. He put a pot up to warm some milk, give us bread and cheese. And he says,\n\"Une nuit seulement.\" -- \"Only one night.\" \"Parce que les patrols, le matin ils sont ic.\nToujours tous les matins a six heures.\" -- \"Towards six o'clock in the morning we have the\npatrols here. I will let you stay for the night, but you have to be out of here before 6:00.\" He\ngave us, let us wash up, gave us this warm milk and bread and cheese, and put us into a bed\nwith white, crisp sheets, wishing us good night. Where just hours before, we were thrown\ninto a car at the end of rifle butts. And in no time we fell asleep. Exhaustion! We let\nourselves just fade away into a dreamland. Next morning -- and that night went so fast -- a\ntender tap on the shoulder. He says, \"Les gars,\u201d -- \"Hey, guys! Hey, guys! Hey, guys, it's\ntime to get up.\" Can you imagine a voice speaking in nice terms, like it was just like\nsomebody, an angel, had just come down? We hated to leave that bed. But he had breakfast\nprepared. He gave us a note to a colleague of his, a priest in another village. He gave us some\nfrancs and food for the road. And we were walking, walking, as we bid him goodbye and\nthanked him. As I said, unfortunately, we never knew his name and he didn't know ours. But\nagain, this was not a moment to dwell on that. And on the road we, we took advantage of one\nof those farm trucks that went back, a horse-pulled truck, a farm wagon, hay wagon. And he\ntook us into a next village, where he was then. We walked again; we wound up into that\nvillage where that other priest lived that he gave us the address to. And, you know, the priest\nwasn't home. This was Saturday morning. He was out at Mass somewhere. And we asked the\nmaid that was there, \"When will he be back?\" She said, \"Shortly.\" So we walked into the\ncemetery to just visit graves, so we shouldn't be noticed by anybody in the streets. The\ncemetery is a safe place. The police doesn't go there to search for people walking around. We\nhad our berets on, because we had our heads shaven. Then we got back to the priest. And it\nwas about lunch time, and he gave us lunch because he had the recommen-- he had a note\nfrom that other Reverend Father. He gave us lunch, and when he, when he stood there,\nsaying his prayer, his blessing over the meal, we being Jewish had no ideas as to what, we\njust bent down and moved our lips. That night, he let us spend the night in his stable of cows.\nWe slept between cows on straw, fresh straw he prepared. But that odor of the cow and that\nodor of the stable was perfume. And the coziness, the warmth of the cows, the animals\nchewing the cud, was almost as if you hear rain drop dropping on your windowpane when\nyou try to fall asleep. It was a cozy sound and a good, good odor. Again, I am coming back\nto that odor.\n7 Young men (French).\nWhen I -- today when I go through a farming country and I smell the odor of cows and stable\nand dung, it's, it's a perfume -- it's Chanel No. 60, or whatever. But it is a perfume. And next\nmorning, he again urged us to leave, gave us an address of a farmer with whom we spent the\nnext night. And that farmer, 1n some way -- he put us up in a barn - -had to be connected\nwith some underground because next morning he came to us, took us to the railroad station\nand gave us two tickets to Paris. And Sunday, the eight, two days after our escape, we landed\nin the Gare de L'est\u201d\u00ae in Paris, got off the train in Paris. Again, carrying our star in our\npockets, not on the lapel. Hair shaven. And when we were in that train, or was it on the road\nthat I mentioned to Fred? By the way, it was Sunday. He would not have let us go on that\ntrain if it was Monday because during the week there are patrols. \"On Sunday, there are,\nthere are, it's a day off, even for the inspectors for the soldiers for the Germans. It's easier to\ntravel on Sunday. You should be all right 'til Paris.\" And he said, \"If something happens\nwant you to escape from a train there, you will be able to do something 1n this case.\" But I\nmentioned to Fred, \"Fred, 30 years from now when we will think about this, we will think\nback of it as a dream. We wouldn't even believe it happened.\" So he said, \"Are you crazy?\nYou are a fool!\" I said, \"Why do you say that?\" \"How can you think of 30 years from now\nwhen we don't even know what tomorrow will be?\" I said, \"You know, now that we are out\nof that train, nothing will -- nothing is impossible any longer. I look forward now to, to\nsurviving and telling about it.\" That was my spirit. And a lot of them later, again, didn't make\nit, and it could have happened to me, too, because I had so many instances and so many\nsituations that I got out of that were only too, too close to call.\nBut at that moment, I saw the future. And he berated me for it. He said, \"I know what you\nmean. But we don't even have papers. We don't know where to go from here.\" \"We go to\nParis. We going to seek my Aunt out who lives in Paris.\" Her son at that time was hiding in\nthe mountains somewhere. She was hiding also with a priest in Paris that was recommended\nto her by a police captain who liked the family. And he has known her from before, before\nshe was a widow yet. And he prevailed that this priest take her in. The concierge that I went\nto on Rue St. Mort (ph) to look for my aunt wanted to know who I am. \"I am her nephew.\"\n\"What is your name?\" I said, \"Leo.\" She said, \"I can't tell you where she is, but I can go and\nsee her.\" She realized that I was a nephew. I look a little bit like my aunt, too. We have the\nsame coloration. She's my mother's sister. And she brought her back a half an hour later. And\nthere, of course, she held us for several days in her place, and went to a Jewish committee\nthat was engaged in producing false ID cards. And she made some of those, two cards for us,\nand with that card we crossed into the unoccupied zone of France near Tours across the\nLoire River. But once across the Loire River, we were arrested. We were arrested trying to\nget a bus. At the bus stop the police examined our papers, took them away from us, took us\ninto the police station. Did not make much of a fuss. We told them that we escaped from the\ntrain. \"Yeah, but you are now in free France.\" You know, another ploy. But we did not want\nto tell them, \"Yes, we came from here.\"\n8 Railway East (French).\nWe didn\u2019t want to let on that we may have some footholds or people that we know. \u201cWell,\nhere\u2019s some ration cards.\u201d They gave us ration cards. Within 24 hours, with this ration card,\nthey gave us a Laisser-passer -- safe conduct. \"You have to register. You have to appear and\nregister at Centre d'Acceuil,\" --whatever the camp was called -- \"Centre d'Acceuil.\" Again,\nCenter of -- Reception Center. \"And present yourself there with these papers.\" Now why did\nthey not take us there, but let us do it by ourselves? Because their administration was so\ngeared on collaborating with the Germans and inspecting everything that they thought that\nfor us to think to not do this would be ludicrous. Also, by them telling us, \"Oh, you escape\nfrom a train from, \" We told them outright, \"We escaped from a train, then we went to Paris,\nwe got these papers.\" \"Who made these papers for you?\" I said, \"I don't know. I don't know.\nWe just had a friend up there who knew about somebody gave us paper.\" And he doesn't\nworry about that, simply because that is in the other zone with the Germans. He is only\nconcemed with his aspect of law enforcement. And by telling us, \"You are now in the Free\nZone of France\" -- not knowing that we were in that so-called \"Free Zone\" before but we're\ncoming from the north -- that he will give us that confidence, inspire confidence or in any\nway con us into thinking that everything is fine. \"And you are going to a Centre d'Acceuil.\"\nYou see, that euphemism again. But we knew better. And instead for the Centre d'Acceuil,\nmy friend and I went to the town where he last lived in the south of France and saw that\neverything was all right with him. We exchanged addresses, because I told him, \"I will go\nsomewhere where you can get in touch with me.\"",
        "A: Bagneres-de-Bigorre. I left him there to his devices. That was the last time -- no, I saw him\none more time, and I will tell you that later. I left him to his devices, he left me to mine, and I\nwent to Bagneres-de-Bigorre. I arrived in Bagneres-de-Bigorre at night, after eight o'clock.\nAnd, and coming out of the train station, there is a gendarme inspecting everybody who\ncomes out of there. And I have no papers! They were inspecting people, not to catch them in\nany way, in some, in some situation of having run away or escaped. I looked French pretty\nmuch at that time, spoke French very well. I am dark. In the southern France part, people\nlook a little bit like this. With my beret, I could strike the pose of a Frenchman very easily.\nBut what he was interested in, to look into my rucksack. If I am not carrying anything\ncontraband. Eggs were rationed, and wine was rationed, and bread was rationed, and butter\nwas rationed, and meat was rationed. I could have easily come from the country bringing all\nthat into the town to do some black market. So he -- here's the comical part: I told you there's\nsome comical parts to my escapes or escapades. Isn't that interesting, that the word \"escape\"\nis really contained in the word \"escapade?\" \"Une minute,\" he says to me. \"One moment.\nWait a minute.\" There was another gendarme a few steps away, like near the other exit. Two\nexits are the, the train station. Who was inspecting a lady with a rucksack with some\nbaggage. This gendarme wanted to inspect my rucksack, but didn't have a flashlight on him.\nHe says, \"Une minute.\" He trusts me, right? Had he known me, he wouldn't have, you see.\n\u201cUn minute.\u201d\nHe goes over there. In a minute goes over there, and wants that flashlight. By the time he\ncame back with the flashlight, I was gone, got to the Spira's house that they rented. A big,\nlike a villa-type thing, and the gate, lo and behold, an iron gate with stakes is closed and\nlocked. I am not about to ring the bell, because they might come out so quickly, the owner of\nthe house who lives in the same building. By that time, nobody knew that I had escaped from\nDrancy. All they knew, by me having written from them from Rivesaltes that I was going to\nDrancy to be deported. What did I do? I climbed up that fence, and there are these concrete\nposts at the side of the fence -- you know, some of them have vases or figurines up there.\nThese had two lions, two smiling lions, one on each side, sitting there, looking at me. And I\nclimbed up that fence, reached over to that circle to that pillar on which the lions were\nsitting, climbed up to the lions and let myself down, jumping down. In the process, moving\nthat lion close to the edge of that pillar so that the bottom, the base of that lion was slightly\noverlapping the bar, the, the pillar. Had I held on to it maybe a little more and dragged it with\nme, this thing could have fallen down and made a lot of noise and really given me away. But\nit just stood there this way. The next morning, when Spira went out and looked at it, he said,\n\"You were lucky. This lion could have fallen on you.\" I proceeded in that -- there was a\ngarden in front and a pathway, a paved pathway, to the house -- proceeded to walk up there,\nto their door entrance, rang the bell. And they opened the door, and they almost fainted.\nAgape: \"How, how, how\u2019? Where, where were you?\" Well, I started telling my story. \"Well,\nLeo, you are going to stay here until we decide on something. You will not leave this place.\nThat was close to the eighth of November, eighth of November. This was close to the\nbeginning of December, already, of '42. I stayed in this place for about a week or 10 days.\nAnd I got, in Yiddish, you say you have shpilkas.\u201d\u201d On pins and needles! I had to move. And\nagainst the advice of my friends, the Spiras, I went to go out and get bread. I had lived in\nBagneres-de-Bigorre many, many months, you see. And I knew this baker, Mr. Broca -- B-\nR-O-C-A -- very well, who always treated me good. When I came with a coupon for a half\nloaf, he gave me a little more than a half a loaf. I became very friendly with him. He always\ngave me a little more. He, young kid and so on, I went to get bread, against the advice of\nSpira. On the way back from Broca, walking back to the Spiras, two gendarmes on bicycles\nrecognized me and shouted and pointed at me. And I started running. But against the bicycle,\nI wasn't fast enough. And they arrested me. That was on the sixth of December, 1942. I spent\none night in the gendarmerie. They wanted to know where I spent the night since then, that\nthey sensed that when I ran away at the train at the station. And I didn't tell them. I said, \"I\nwas here in the woods. I was walking around. I was out of town, and I came back.\" \"But you\nhave friends here. We know who they are.\" \"Oh, yeah, I knew a lot of people here,\" I said.\n\"But they are already gone by now, like I was.\" \u201cAbandon\u00e9 de residence,\u201d \u201d that was the,\nthat was the, that was my indictment. The Southern French Vichy Government were the, the\n*\u201d Worries (Yiddish).\n*\u00b0 Abandonment of residence (French).\npolice and the authorities were, again, not concerned with my escape from the train in the\nnorth. Only that I escaped, that I left originally my assigned residence in Cauterets. That was\nwhat they, that was against the law. So when they arrested me, put me in that cell, the next\nday on the seventh of December I was taken to jail in Tarbes. Tarbes 1s the seat -- Prefecture,\nto you. That's the seat of the, of the Department. And I waited. They assigned a lawyer to me\nfrom the Vichy Government, Maitre Laouie_(ph), and on the eighth of May, 19 -- I am sorry.\nEighth of January, 1943, I was taken back to Bagn\u00e9res by jail authorities to face trial.\nOn the eighth of January I was tried and sentenced to one year in jail. On the behest of the\nlawyer, he said, \"If you are in jail, you will be in jail. They cannot deport you while you are\nin jail, except if there is an attack on a German position in the town or something. If there 1s\na -- some underground or resistance action that they want to retaliate against, they can take\nhostages then. In jail you are not in the safest place, but it's safer than being on the streets, on\nthe roads, and being arrested, taken to Drancy.\" Because they would take the political and\nthe Jews out of jail as hostages. That has happened quite frequently. Sentenced to one year in\njail--which means, if you get one year and one day, that means you serve the full year and\none day. But if you are sentenced to one year, that means you are entitled to quarter off for\ngood behavior. So you serve actually nine months. Lo and behold, after my sentencing on\neighth of January 1943, I escaped from the gendarmes. They went into a bar, a bistro, and I\nconned them into taking off the handcuffs, off their hand, because I have to go to the\nbathroom. You see, they were cuffed to theirs and mine. And they figured they can do that,\nbecause, after all, I have my handcuffs on. Where can I do? \"Can you let me go to the\nbathroom?\" But instead of going to the bathroom, I ran away. I had seen Drancy, and I didn't\nwant to ever have to go back to Drancy again. I had seen it. I ran away from the gendarmes.\nIt was a very emotional thing, at the time. I went to a grocery store and asked them to get in\ntouch with the Spiras. Didn't want to go back to the Spiras. I wasn't going to jeopardize them.\nBecause the Spiras had come to the trial, and sit there and watch my trial. And other people\nthat I still had known there went to that trial and watched.\nAnd they went to the Spiras and told them about me. And the girls came to the grocery store,\nthe daughters, to see me and to tell me that the gendarmes had been there already to want to\nfind out where I am. \"Because he is probably your boyfriend,\" they said to Suzy. Because\nSuzy, when I was incarcerated in Bagneres, after they had called me, after that incident that I\nhad went for bread, they had put me for one night into the gendarmerie before the took me to\njail. Suzy and her sister came to visit me there. But they could do that, because they knew\nthat the Jews knew each other. But in this case: \"Where is he?\" And they went to their house\nand they said they don't not know. All they know is that they saw me last time at -- in the\ncourthouse. And in no uncertain terms, they told them that \"If he will come here, we will not\nlet him stay. In fact, if he will come here, we will have to let you know, because we don't\nwant him to be running around and be caught again. He's probably safer in jail.\" They played\nit that way. I ran away. And they told me right there at that grocery store, \"Do not come to\nus. It doesn't pay.\" With a hacksaw, they cut my cuffs off and left them there. And I\nmeandered for 48 hours in the -- at night. It became night by that time. On a rainy night, into\nthe direction of Toulouse. I wanted to get somewhere to get -- I had hidden some money\naway that they were not able to take from me in jail. I had hidden it in my anus. And when I\nleft that grocery store, my first stop was again to the baker, Mr. Broca. He gave me some\nbread. He told me that already the radio had said that the fellow who lived here before 1n the\n-- in Bagn\u00e9res-de-Bigorre had escaped, to be on the look out, and your name was mentioned.\nSo he said, \"You know, you cannot stay in Bagn\u00e9res.\" I said, \"I know. Can I have some\nbread, please -- to, for the road?\" He gave me that, he gave me 20 francs. And also, in the\ncourthouse, one of the friends that I had, when I went to the bathroom -- my ploy was always\nto go to the bathroom--had stood next to me in the bathroom and also had handed me 10\nfrancs. So I was pretty much equipped, as far as money goes, for a little food and that sort of\nthing. Couldn't make many, couldn't buy a train ticket or something like that, but I figured\nmaybe a freight train, or pick up a, hitch a ride or something. I wandered all night in the rain\nand again slept under a tree in the forest, leaning against the tree. And the next morning, I\narrived in a little village. I forgot the name of that village. In the same area. But I must have\ngone in circles at night, because I had not been that far away from Bagneres-de-Bigorre.\nWent into the restaurant and ordered a platter of beans, and sit down to eat it. And my collar\nhad, the coat collar from, of the rain coat, a gabardine rain coat 1n blue, had this collar upon\nmy neck. I had a blue line around here.\nAnd I was sitting there, ragged as I must have looked --because I had shaved hair from jail--\nand the owner of that restaurant went to the telephone. I saw him go to the telephone and\nwhisper something into the telephone. And at that point, I was resigned not to run because I\nwas really tired. I was really worn out from the night. I was really exhausted, and\nemotionally, I was really down in the dumps because I hadn't wandered that far from\nBagneres. I thought I had made more headway. And in a few minutes, two gendarmes\nwalked in, come up to my table. And they said, \"Finish the beans.\" And I said, \"No, that's for\nthe boss. I leave that for him. He probably needs that food much more than I.\" I made such a\nsarcastic remark. And they found money on me. I spend the night in the gendarmerie, and\nthe next morning I was picked up by the gendarmes from Tarbes. The same gendarmes that\nhad accompanied me to the courthouse. The same two men from whom, whose custody I\nhad escaped. Now, you can just imagine how they felt toward me. They beat me real good,\nfists, key reinforced fists. Then they took a stoking arm from a, from the chimney, and they\nhad a little a little chimney -- what you call it? A fireplace. In the police station. Had took\nthat poker and beat me on my back and on my legs. They wanted to know why I did that.\nThat's bad for them. I put them into jeopardy. They will be fired. And I apologized. You see,\nin France, you do not sentence a prisoner for more time because he escaped. The prisoner\ngets the free time that he spent away from the jail just added to the sentence instead of nine\nmonths. And still, given good behavior, I was going to serve nine months and two days. It is\n-- the onus is on the guardians. The onus is on the gendarmes to make sure that that prisoner\ndoes not escape. That's their job. In America, it's different. When you escape, you get\npunished for that. But in, in military training, the soldiers are trained to escape. They are\ngoing through training.",
        "A: I spent in jail nine months and two days. I was taken on the ninth of September 1943 out of\njail, and transported to a forced labor -- not forced labor camp. A hard labor camp in\nSeptfond, Department Tarn-et-Garonne. I was one of hundreds of prisoners there. In that\ncamp, my friend with whom I had escaped had found out where I was taken. He came to\nvisit me, and he gave me an address that I can write to in case I manage to become free. My\ncorrespondence to that camp, which I was entitled to receive for a month, I was sitting there\nbanging stones, rocks, making it into small stones. My correspondence that I got there, I\nfound out later, was kept and censored and not given to me. The correspondence that I sent\nout went out, but was also read and censored. So my friend came and gave me an address,\nand I memorized it. I didn't write it down. On the 15th of October, 1943, was the Yom\nKippur. And the Germans have a knack for doing that on a Jewish holiday. The day before,\non the 14th, we were informed that the next day we were going to be taken to Organization\nTodt. That is the, the organization, German Organization Todt. They were building\nfortifications named after Todt, who was the armament minister who was later replaced by\nSpeer, and when Todt died Speer took over. Organization Todt was supposed to take us to\nthe Atlantic War building. And there was 14 of us to be taken away for that. And again, we\ndiscussed: \"Will we really go there? Is this just a ploy? Will we wind up in Drancy again?\"\nAnd there was a guard by the name of Kaufmann. He was an Alsace-Lorraine native -- spoke\nGermany fluently and French fluently.\nTo me he spoke German. And sometimes also spoke French. He said to me, \"Bretholz,\nMorgen begleit Ich Si\u201d! -- \"Tomorrow, I will be accompanying you,\u201d and then there will be\nno more running away. And you know what I said to him? \"Mr. Kaufmann, \" Or,\n\"Kaufmann, \" Because prisoners and guards get sort of chummy there; they develop a\nrelationship. \"Kaufmann, you want to know? It is true you will accompany me tomorrow.\nBut whether I run away or not will not depend on you. It will strictly depend on me.\" That's\nwhat I told him. The next day, we were taken to Toulouse. A friend of mine in the camp\nbefriended me in this month, you know. His wife lived nearby. She was going to come to the\nrailroad station to bring him some food. They allowed that to happen, bring him some food\nfor the trip. She brought the two kids along, too. I said, \"When you wife comes there, will\nyou please ask her to buy me a ticket for Toulouse?\" He said, \"What do you need a ticket\n*' Bretholz, tomorrow I accompany you (German).\nfor?\" I said, \"If run away.\" He said, \"You are not going to run away.\" \"If I run away, I want\nto have a ticket.\" Because on the stations, out of the railroad stations, in France, you have to\npresent your travel ticket, to see that you haven't traveled for free. He said, \u201c\u201cWhat are you\ndoing?\u201d I said, \"Can she do it?\" He said, \"Sure, I'll tell her.\" She bought a ticket. I gave them\nthe little money that I had. He gave it to her. She bought me the ticket. When we arrived in\nthe railroad station of Toulouse, and the train was standing -- this was a passenger train with\nthose individual doors leading to each compartment -- when we were lined up there to be, to\nbe prepared, ready to get into that train, I asked Kaufmann if I may go to the bathroom. He\nsaid, \"Oh, come on. You don't mean that.\" He said, \"You don't mean that. What do you\nthink, I am crazy?\" I said, \"Well, I can't blame you. Okay, fine. I can't blame you. I'll wait\nuntil I am in the train.\" That was to placate him. But when I saw, not a cattle train, but a train\nwith doors and windows, I saw freedom. But I placated him by saying, \"Oh, I go in the\ntrain.\" Now, these foolish guards, We have about eight guards for 14 people, seven guards.\nInstead of going with us into the train, at least a couple of them, all seven were standing in\nfront to see that we don't get out. And nobody watching what was going on in the inside. So I\nsaid to my friend -- the one whose wife had bought the ticket for me -- \"I am ready to go. Do\nyou want to go with me?\" He said, \"No, I can't. My wife is there. My children there. I don't\nwant to jeopardize my life. This is -- okay.\" I went to the back window, inched to the back\nwindow, and says, \"You just stay there and see if Kaufmann and his cohorts are coming.\nYou just stay there. When you see them come, then tell me.\" I went to the back window,\nlowered the back window, dropped myself, lost a shoe in the process, one of those loafer-\ntype sandals, that I put it back on. My beret fell off my head. I picked that up. My rucksack I\nstill had, that steady companion. On the next track, there was a freight car parked on the, on\nthe track. In standing position, I went under that freight car, went to the subterranean exit --\nbecause I knew the train station of Toulouse -- walked up there. I had a ticket, but I never\nneeded it. I showed that ticket into the luggage room. I went to the luggage room, and I made\nout that I am looking for luggage. \"It just arrived.\" I said, \"Where?\" He said, \"Well, you have\nto have a, a, coupon.\" You have to have a ticket for your luggage.\" I said, \"Well, maybe my\nfriend, my friend, maybe my friend has it, because we came together. But here's my train\nticket.\" I showed him the train ticket. He said, \"That is okay.\" I walked out from the luggage\nroom right into the street. There was no friend waiting for me. But I said, \"My friend has it.\"\nI walked out there. And I had friends 1n living in Blagnac near Toulouse, and I made my way\nto Blagnac and showed up at Jacques Estrajch\u2019s place. And guess what he told me? \"I got\nyour card you are going to the Organization Todt. Did you get mine?\" \"No, I didn't get\nyours.\" He said, \"I wrote to you.\" Then I knew that I didn't get the mail. And I also knew that\nas soon as I escaped in Toulouse, the first place they will be looking at will be Blagnac,\nbecause that's the nearest place to my escape. He said, \"Go upstairs and take a rest and sleep.\nIf somebody comes, I'll tell him you are not here.\" I slept two hours, I came down, and guess\nwhat he told me? \"The gendarmes were here to look for you, because they know that you\nhad written to me. And I told them yes, you wrote you are going to Organization Todt. But\notherwise, I don't know anything.\" He said, \"Leo, you have got to leave. They told me that if\nthey find you here, they have got to take me also.\"",
        "A: He took me to an elderly couple that was living there from, originally from Paris. They were\nliving there in the southern zone of France. They kept me for a couple of weeks. Kept me for\ncouple of weeks. I wrote to my friend whose address I had memorized. He sent me my false\nbirth certificate, with an address where to go to and on the first of November, I joined an\naddress in Saint-Vallier on the Rhone River south of Lyon with the French underground,\npresenting myself with my birth certificate. And from that moment on, I was Max Henri\nLef\u00e9vre. I was four years younger. I was born on the 25th of October in Saint Jouin-sur-Mer.\nI knew the name of my father and mother, and legalized, regularized my situation with\nFrench ID papers under the name of Max Henri Lef\u00e9vre.",
        "A: You are out of breath, and so am I.",
        "A: That is all I do in the underground.",
        "A: I can do that.\nConclusion of July 31, 1989 interview\nSeptember 27, 1989\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nTape #4",
        "A: This is a village called Blagnac -- B-L-A-G-N-A-C -- in the area of Toulouse, one of the\nmajor cities in the south of France. That's the town I had reached in that convoy that I\nescaped from on that afternoon. It was from a standing train in the train station of Toulouse,\nas I explained previously. So I am in Blagnac; my friend, Jacques Estrajch, takes me to this\nelderly couple, just con-- suggesting, or hoping that they would keep me just for a week or\ntwo until I can make arrangements for the future where to go. And they were very amenable,\nfriendly. I spent two weeks with them. The evening hours filled with -- the time of the\nevening hours was filled with listening to Radio London, was broadcasting the news from\nthe front, war fronts, and all other news that pertained to the French Resistance and the war\ngoing on. And I contacted the friend with whom I had escaped in November of 1942. I had\nmemorized his address and sent him the information where I was now located.",
        "A: Meaning what?",
        "A: In France, you could just post a letter. In Southern France, that was in the, what you call\nVichy Zone. If we're writing to the northern zone, past the demarcation line, there were\nspecial post cards that were printed in the post office, preprinted with, \"I am well. Please do\nthis.\" This was almost like a form letter. Between the occupied and the Vichy Zone, there\nwas this controlled correspondence. But within the Vichy Zone, yes, they had the Vichy\nstamps and the Petain stamps. These were not the same that were used in northern France, in\nthe occupied zone. And I thus wrote to my friend that I was at this address in Blagnac, and a\nweek or so later, I received in the mail a birth certificate which was made out to the name of\nMax Henri Lef\u00e9vre: I was born in October of 1925, four years younger than what I was\nreally was; and my mother's name so and so; and my father's name. And I had to memorize\nall of this. And with that birth certificate, my friend, when he sent me this, sent me also a\ninstructions as to where to go. His brother had been -- had joined that particular group that he\nwas sending me to, sometime earlier. And this was a, an underground group in the area of --\nsouth of Lyon, in Saint-Vallier in the Department of Drome, south of Lyon. A little town on\nthe Rhone river. And I joined with the underground there in November of 1943.",
        "A: The group was composed of a microcosm of, of people who were resisting the Germans or\nthe fascist regimes. There were some people that were still hold-outs from the Spanish Civil\nWar that had come to France -- this was seven, eight -- or six or so years later -- and had\njoined. There were a couple of German deserters. There was -- were one or two of Russians,\nGeorgian Russians or Russian Georgians, who, who had been incorporated into the German\narmy after the Germans entered Russia, took them captive. They incorporated Ukrainians\nand other nationals from Russia into their armed forces. So these people may have been hurt\nor may have been wounded and sent to France for recuperation. A lot of German soldiers\ncame to northern France to recuperate or ride out their injuries in some way. Well, a couple\nof them then ran away and joined with the French underground because they were really\nagainst the Germans. There were some people from Alsace-Lorraine, who traditionally were\neither violently anti-German or very much with the Germans from their nationalistic point of\nview. But there were many Alsace-Lorraine citizens who were deeply nationalistic French.\nThese people resisted the Germans just as well. And there were a few of those in the -- in\nthat group, and a lot of Jews. What was that group? It was really a group called the, the\nVichy French had a youth movement which was called Companion de France. These people\nwere prepared -- young people from age 17 on -- were doing crafts and, and trades. Learning\ncrafts and trades, like masonry and carpentry and plumbing and building, and that sort of\nthing, to prepare them for service in Germany for the new order, to be incorporated into the\nnew order. This was a Petain youth movement called Companion de France. Their uniforms\nwere blue. Their berets were blue. And they sang the Petain nationalistic songs in training.\nThis group took on the semblance of a Companion de France camp. When we -- when I\npresented myself to the camp chief -- Chief of Camp, \u201cChief de Camp,\u201d Maurice Bardin --\nB-A-R-D-I-N -- I showed him a note that I had from my friend, showed him the birth\ncertificate, he did not ask me any questions. He says, \"Welcome to our camp. We will call\nyou 'Henri.' That's what we will call you.\" And they made out the ID for us, and I was\naccepted as one of the, of the group. This group was mainly engaged 1n sending messages.\nMessages from the mountains of Savoy to Lyon, or sending emissaries up to Lyon with\ncertain instructions as to what to do when the next German column comes by. But on the\nsurface, ostensibly, we were learning carpentry and agriculture. And in the morning, we\nwould get up at 4:30 and it was cold. And I have a picture here shows the snows. And we\nwould take cold showers, because there was no warm water. And after that we would have\nbreakfast. But before the cold shower, we would run a mile or two. All part of the youth\nmovement -- exercise before we start the day working. But there were carpentry shops and\nall kinds of other. So if someone would come in and observe the camp, it was a camp of\nCompanion de France. And when I circulated, I had the Companion de France uniform and\nID, so that I could take a train anywhere and also not have to pay with my ID, because I was\npart of the Vichy government Companion de France. But 80 percent of us were Jewish,\nhiding out; but this was a cover, and this facilitated our movements. It was not until\nsometime the end of the year -- December, the beginning of January - -that overnight we had\nto clear out the facility.\nThe Mayor of Saint-Vallier had notified us that word has come from the French Milice -- the\nmilitia, the Vichy France collaborators with the Germans; and they were vicious, they were\nprobably as much, if not more, vicious than the Germans -- that they will come for an\ninspection of the camp, of the Companion camp. Evidently word had come out, or the rumor\nhad been circulating, that there is something fishy going on there. They wanted to have a\nfirsthand view. Well, when they came later, 24 hours later, the camp was empty. We\nreceived our walking papers. I have them here. The release papers from the camp. We got\ntickets to go into various directions. I and a couple of other people was assigned to Chalus,\nnear Limoges. And we took a train to Chalus, and we arrived in Chalus and joined another\nunderground movement there. And in Chalus, in connection with the Jewish hiding out\ncommunity in Limoges, we were engaged in producing false identification cards and to help\nchildren go get to the border so that they should be able to cross into Switzerland to perhaps\nSpain and further on to Portugal. This was our main endeavor, except also putting up road\nblocks and doing communication between the various underground groups in the area.",
        "A: It was never spelled out. It was never -- it was never spelled out, the original. In Limoges it\nwas, because there I joined a group which was called \"A.J.\" or Arm\u00e9e Juive.\u201d\u201d So there, the\nmajority belonging were Zionist-oriented Jewish, although there were non-Jews who also\nworked with us. And the Rabbi of Limoges, Abraham Deutsch, he was from Strasbourg\noriginally. He in his office was a great liaison center for all these operations, and of course,\nthe French authorities were not aware of it at the time. And in Limoges, I lived with a lady,\nMadame Bergot, who was hiding me and renting me an attic together with my friend,\nEugene Bass, who was shot on the 10th of June, 1944. And we sometime had in this attic\nroom 12 or 15 or 20 young people staying over night, just squatting on the floor, lying down\non the floor. There was only one big bed, and sometimes we laid across. We were lying\nacross three, four, five people that came to Limoges just to spend the night and go on to other\nplaces. And was -- and Madame Bergot knew exactly who we were, but she is probably one\nof the real Righteous Christians.\n** Jewish Army (French).",
        "A: Madame Margaret. Margaret -- Marguerite Bergot was an elderly woman in her middle to\nlate 60s, who in the first World War after only having been married a few months, became a\nwar widow. She was a widow at 21 or 22. She never remarried, but she always did things for\npeople. A gray-haired lady, whom I went to visit in 1970, when my family and I went -- no, I\nam sorry. In 1954, when for the first time I went back with my wife to visit France. We went\nto visit Madam Bergot, and later -- she was delighted to receive us and made us lunch. And\nlater, when my son was born, whose initials -- his name is Myron -- his initials are M.B., she\nmade sure that she sent him a silver spoon from her set of flatware that were engraved with\nher initials -- Marguerite Bergot, \"M.B.\"",
        "A: She was a good lady. She kept a lot of Resistance people in her attic. She helped out\nwherever she could. She made sure we had ration cards for those who couldn't get them. I\ncould, because I was living under the name of Lefevre. So I got my ration cards legally and\nlegitimately. But there were some of them who did not have false papers. They were hiding\nout, and therefore could not go to city hall and get their ration cards. But Madame Bergot\nmade sure they had either ration cards or bread -- either ration cards or coffee, or, or clothing\nlike handkerchiefs, socks, underwear. That was all rationed.",
        "A: Madame Bergot got them! She may have known somebody at city hall that knew her. She\nwould never let on as to where, but there they were. When we went there in 1954, in that just\nfew hours, my wife grew very fond of her, because you could see in that lady a -- what you\nmight call in Jewish \u201ceshet khayil\u201d\u201d\u201d -- a woman of valor. And that she was. A beautiful\nperson from the point of your heart and soul, and reaching out and helping. That was Madam\nBergot in Limoges. And, of course, I first went to Chalus, as I said, but later, I relocated to\nLimoges, which was only about 10 or 15 -- 10 miles or so, or 10 kilometers from Chalus.\nAlthough I went back quite often to Chalus to see friends and distant relatives there, I really\nspent my time in Limoges in 1933 into 19 -- I mean the end of '33, December -- from the end\nof '43 or beginning of '44, until the end of the war, in Limoges. In May of 1944, I was -- I fell\nill with a strangulation hernia. You may recall in the earlier part of the interview that in\nAntwerp, I was already in the hospital to be operated on in 1940, and that never came to\npass. But finally, with all my escapades and all that, the, the hernia just -- a hernia doesn't\nheal by itself, and the hand-made truss that I had just didn't do the job anymore. So one day -\n- one evening, walking through a park on my way to actually an orphanage to deliver some\ndocuments or papers, I -- or a message -- I just was caught by one of these attacks and lay\ndown on a park bench and started throwing up violently until there was nothing left but bile.\nAnd it so happens that a woman walked by in a nurse's hospital sister-type uniform, Red\n*> Woman of valor (Hebrew).\nCross-type uniform. And she came over and wanted to know what it was. Perhaps she\nthought I had been drinking. \"You don't feel so good.\" -- \"Vous ne sentez pas bien.\" I said,\n\"Je sais ce que c'cest.\" -- \"I know what it is. This is a hernia, and I can't push it back.\nNormally you can try.\" She said, \"Well, what you need 1s a hospital.\" And I said, \"I don't\nthink I can do that.\" Because you go to the hospital, you being recognized as circumcised. I\nwasn't going to take chances. She says, \"But at this point...\" And she tries to touch my\nstomach; there was this tenderness and the pain with it. She says, \"This is an emergency!\"\nAnd she called the ambulance, and I was taken to the hospital. And I cannot remember them\nactually taking my clothes off. That's how fast they put anesthesia on me. Already starting in\nthe ambulance. And then when I got in the operating table, I was sort of half away already.\nAnd the next thing I knew was waking up the next morning in the hospital bed.\nAnd a very nice, young religious sister -- it was a Catholic hospital by the name of Saint Joan\nof Arc -- bending over me and whispering in my ear after she had put a hot brick to my feet.\nAnd I had a drain in my stomach, in my belly, because it had begun to almost, you know, to\nbe infected. You know, there is the situation with the strangulation hernia creates these\nemergency conditions. Whispering into my ear, \"I am in charge of this ward, so therefore\nyou have nothing to fear.\" Later, when I needed my documents to make a claim with the\nGerman government for certain restitutions and disability-type compensation, I had to gather\npapers as to all these events. So I wrote to the hospital to send me a copy of, of what I had\nundergone, what operation, just attesting to it. Well, in the letter I wrote to them, \"And if\nSister Joan of Arc is still with you, please tell her that I will never forget her kind words nor\nher cheerful whistle when she walked by the bed.\" She was always whistling a tune. A very\nyoung, attractive cheerful person. And they wrote back to me that she is in Normandy, did\nthey write? Or Brittany? I don't recall. And if the chance will present itself, they will send\nher my regards and tell her how I, how I remember her. I wonder where she is today. Really.\nSo there is a lot of reminiscences, and there are also nice bright moments in that period of\ndarkness.",
        "A: I went to the hospital on May the 8th, and I was released on the May 25th. That was just\nseveral days before the landing. The landing took place in June -- on June the 6th, 1944. In\nmy little diary that I also have, I wrote, sometime before my release from the hospital, \"I\nhope I will be released before the landing.\"",
        "A: Because, sometime in April or early May, we had already had in the underground, through\nthe Radio London, messages that indicated that sometime in June, in the first couple of\nweeks of June, there will be major events happening, which at this time could only mean a\ndebarkation. Where it would happen, we did not know. But we knew it was going to happen.\nI did not feel that I would like to be confined when that happens, because there'll be a lot of\nturmoil out there. There'll be a lot to do, a lot to see, a lot to be part of; and that was always\nmy urge, to be part of something. So that between that time and the actual landing, there was\nvery little time to do whatever we had to do. However, how did we feel, coming to your\nquestion about transporting. First of all, we had to produce the cards. We made them with\nfalse stamps and seals. And we, we were counterfeiters, you see! That's what we were -- just\nlike when I escaped from that train. The emergency was there, but I did it almost like a\nnatural thing; because the urge was to be free. So I did it, naturally, with all the trepidations\ninvolved. But there were also trepidations in transporting papers or doing communication.\nBut at the time when we did it, the danger was not that apparent to us. It's in hindsight, as\nyou look: \"What did we do? My God, we were really young and...and dumb!\" That sort of\nthing. But when we did it, while we did it, it did not occur to us that it was in any way\nendangering us. Yes, anybody was endangered who did not have proper papers. You could\ngo into a restaurant as a French citizen. You could go into a restaurant to have a meal and the\nMilice\u2019* would come in and, like random, make, make inspections or certain searches. Well,\nif you were a Frenchman and you didn't have your IDs on you on that day and you were not\ninvolved in Resistance and you were not Jewish, you were a French farmer come to town,\nbut you didn't have your -- any kind of ID on you; you forgot it; you neglected to take it\nalong. Even that would endanger you, because everybody had to have an ID. So we were just\npart of a whole system of, of, of hazards and pitfalls and problems. But we did not consider\nour activity as something that would be any more dangerous than anybody else living under\nthat regime. Although we were exposed a little more. We would have been exposed a little\nmore to the punishment, if they had found us with the cards on us, because that could mean\ninstant death, which happened to my friend, Eugene Bass, on the 10th of June 1944.",
        "A: That was on the same day as Oradour was burned. I had been asked or instructed to go to\nOradour on that Saturday to deliver some cards, and he had been instructed to go into\nanother town that was a little further than Saint-Junien, another town nearby. The German\nColumn advanced into that area. Eugene had de-- before he had delivered the cards had\ndecided, \"Let me go and visit my mother in Saint-Junien.\" She lived there in hiding. He\nhadn't seen her in a couple of weeks or a couple of months, or whatever. He's the fellow that\nboarded with me. Sort of blondish red hair, curly-haired fellow. Eugene Bass. He was from\nAlsace-Lorraine. He went on the nom de guerre, the war name, Bastinet -- B-A-S-T-I-N-E-\n** Militia (French).\nT. He had gone to visit his mother in Saint-Junien. He arrived in Saint-Junien rather than go\ninto town first to deliver the cards, which was a little further. Got off the train, through the\nstation lobby, to the front door of the railroad station. And the advance column of Das Reich,\nthe Germans, were there already. And everybody walking out was inspected. And he had a\nrucksack; and in the rucksack, he had the ID cards. Shot in the head! His name is listed in the\nbook deportations under those summarily executed. Eugene Bass, his name is in there.",
        "A: He didn't come home that night. He did not come home that night. So a few days later we\ncontacted, a friend and I, his mother. And she had found out from someone, some witness,\nthat he had been killed. And it was through the mother that we found out that Eugene had\nbeen killed. And it would have happened to me, perhaps, and others in the train that we were\nin on that same day, on the 10th of June, 1944, going towards Oradour-sur-Glane from\nLimoges, when we saw the German column, Das Reich -- or one part of the, part of the rear\nunit. Because the advance unit had already been into Saint-Junien. And when we saw\nparallel to the railroad track the country road where the German motorized the motorcycles\nand the half-tracks were heading into the direction that we were heading, rolling up all that\ndust, so some of us decided, \"If the Germans are going into this direction, we certainly do\nnot want to go into the same direction.\" So before we got into Oradour, there was another\nhalt, another station. There was an electric commuter train between Saint-Junien and\nLimoges.\nSo the station before -- there were a couple of halts, stops, before we got off the train. But the\nreport on Oradour that I have on that particular sheet, the write up, says that anyone with a\nticket to Oradour that got off that railroad station that particular morning was taken off and\nimmediately machine-gunned -- just like the other 900 some citizens of Oradour. The men.\nThe women and the children were taken to the church. They were told they were being\nphotographed. They put bales of hay and straw around the church and put gasoline over it\nand destroyed the church, burned it down with the women and children in it. The moans and\nthe cries filled the air. A couple of weeks later, we went back to Oradour to view the scene.\nAnd we stood there crying, with the tears. Tables had been set up with the remains of\nmementos: baby carriages, buckles, shoes, baby dolls, toys that the kids had taken with them.\nOradour has been built up later -- about a quarter of a mile, a half a mile further away, a new\nlittle town. But the original area of Oradour 1s today still a shrine to be visited, to reminisce\nand to cry. Because it was really a stroke of luck that we even noticed that column. We\nwould have gone in there. The mayor of Oradour at that time, on this particular moment, was\narrested, put on a table and in front of his two sons, his two legs were sawed off. Reported\nright in the, in the, in the sheet that I have here. The sons, before that happened to their father\nsaid, \"Please, take us! Do to us what you want to do, but not to our father!\" They cut off his\nlegs, and they shot the sons, too. There was just a handful of people surviving in Oradour out\nof 900-some people. There could have been many more, because those who were hiding out\nwithout papers, that will never be known. There were people hiding out. A lot of Jewish\npeople. And this is exactly the place where we took some of those cards to. So that they\nshould not be in hiding continually, and also be able to move a little freer, travel here or\nthere. But at that particular time, all that was already moot because the landing had taken\nplace, a lot of what you might call, in the Genesis terms, \"tohoo va-vohoo\"\u201d\u201d happened -- a\nlot of tumult.",
        "A: No. I had a call here when I wrote about this. I wrote a piece to the Sun paper, recalling the\nevent of Oradour. It was in 1984, 40 years after the event, and I had a lady call me at home\nwho told me that at one time she and her family had lived in Oradour. And when she read\nthis she had to get in touch with me. But they had left Oradour before the town had been\ndevastated. In fact, it was devastated in error. In the same area, there are two little towns\nOradour. One is called Oradour-sur-Glane, on the River Glane, near Limoges. Another one,\nseveral miles away, not that great a distance, perhaps 15 kilometers or something like that. I\ndon't quite have the distance in proportion. That was called Oradour-sur-Vayres. Oradour-\nsur-Vayres had a group of Resistance fighters. Oradour-sur-Glane had no Resistance\nfighters. They had people in hiding, yes. They had no arms caches. Oradour-sur-Vayres did.\nThe German high command, going towards the front lines, coming from Toulouse, the\nDivision Das Reich -- and by the way, they did a lot of damage in the town called Brive-la-\nGaillarde, where they hung 90-some men from butcher hooks because of resistance\nactivities. And their families had to walk, walk by to view that. That is in the Department of\nCorr\u00e9ze. Limoges was, and, and Oradour was, in the Department of Haute-Vienne. The\nGerman Division Das Reich had been informed, by the Milice or by some of their\ncollaborators, that Oradour-sur-Vayres had a Resistance group, an arms cache there, and that\nthey might hinder their progress towards the front lines. The advance column of Das Reich\nwent there to clean out that nest of resistors, so that the main columns would then have easy\ntravel. But all they knew was Oradour. They looked at the map, and they saw \"Oradour\" on\nthe main road between Limoges and Angoul\u00e9me or wherever, and picked Oradour-sur-\nGlane. And the Mayor said, \"We have no resistance here. You can search the village. You\ncan search everywhere. I give you my personal guarantee with my life.\" And it was by\nmistake that Oradour-sur-Glane became the victim.\n*\u00b0 Chaos, disorder (Hebrew).",
        "A: I was in Limoges, doing my daily whatever it is, communication or whatever work I did.\nAnd it was a day of euphoria. The papers reported it, and people were standing in front of the\nnewspaper buildings to read the bulletins. And the Germans were running around like\nchickens with their heads cut off. Chalus had already been liberated by the Resistance;\nLimoges not yet, because Limoges had a main Gestapo headquarters. Chalus was a little\ntown. I also have a little sheet here that shows the liberation of Chalus, and the appeal that\nwas made by the, by the Resistance forces to keep calm and to go on about your daily lives\nas usual. You see, there were two types of Resistance forces in France. One was the FTPF.\nThis was called Franc-Tireurs Partisans Francaises.\u2019 That was like a guerilla movement.\nAnd the other was called FFI, Force Francais de |'Interieur -- French Forces of the Interior.\nThey were under the command of the exiled French government -- De Gaulle, in London.\nAnd there was conflict between the two groups. The ones that listened to De Gaulle were the\nones that went by the rules, when De Gaulle and the French exiled government would give\ninstructions: \"Do not attack such and such a building...\" Because that building happened to\nbe English property. So the FTPF would say: \"Who cares? But in that building there 1s\narmament produced that goes to the Germans.\" So there was this conflict. The FTPF was\nalso a more radical-type movement than the FFI. The FTPF, for instance, had some of the\nSpanish Civil War refugees. They had a communist-leaning group. They had more of the\npolitical activistic -- activist-type people who were fighting fascism wherever they can fight\nfascism, wherever they can find it. The FFI was picking their targets and was going by the --\nwhat might be called \"the rules.\" But in a unruly times, rules sometimes don't achieve\nanything, you see. So this was the thing. But we were in the streets, hoping that soon we will\nhave liberation established in Limoges. And it happened not too long afterwards, you see.",
        "A: The A.J. was independent, actually. But we were under the orders of the FTPF. Yes, we were\nunder the orders of the Franc-Tireurs Partisans.",
        "A: They were very cordial.",
        "A: It was a common cause. It is interesting that a common danger, how people's actions\ncongeal, how a common danger becomes also a common denominator and an equalizer. I\nmean, you take the London Blitz, just to divert for a minute --\n\u00b0\u00b0 Free-Shooting French Partisans (French).",
        "A: Ok.",
        "A: I would never dismiss that aspect of a, of a, of a situation where Jews are involved, because\nour history tells us that. On the surface, it did not happen. We did not feel it. We did not see\nit in so many deeds or words. But it could very well have been there, because there was one\ncaptain of the French army who worked with us. He was a Viennese, actually of Polish\norigin, but coming from Vienna. His name was Prinz. And he was originally with the French\nForeign Legion, then came into France to join the Resistance. And he at one time indicated\nto me that while our main job was to fight the Nazis, if he survives the war he will have to\nsettle a few accounts with some people, that he knew among his unit, you know. And after\nthe liberation, when the German soldiers had been arrested and interned and were in\ninternment camps in Limoges, he took me to one of those camps to see because he was in\ncharge of some of their units. And he took me in one of those camps and he -- I got great\nsatisfaction to see this little fellow by the name of Prinz -- he was about 5 foot 4 -- had these\ntall German prisoner soldiers stand at attention and act like really like scared children once\nthey were in custody. Just weeks before, days before, they were the strong, the strong\nmasters, especially women and children. And then when the day of reckoning came, they\nbecame whimpering children themselves. But, no. We, during our work with the Resistance,\ndid not see it openly, feel 1t openly. And frankly, for that nonsense, during this particular\nperiod there was no time for that. We had an enemy to fight, you see.",
        "A: We were involved tn -- our group was involved a little later. A little later, with grave\nresearch and registration; because there had been -- for instance, we received parachuted\nprovisions that came into the area of Limoges. Certain nights when, when the message, the\nmessage, the coded message would tell us to be at a certain place at a certain time, and then\nthere would be... We were told to send a flare at a certain time, up in the air, and then few\nminutes later we would have a drop off of clothing or food items. The parachutes themselves\nwould be gathered up, and the ladies would make shirts out of them. They were in khaki or\nwhite or pink. And in the process, in that execution of that particular parachuting help to the\nResistance, some were shot down, some had to bail out for one reason or another, some were\narrested. And then later on, in the area a little north of Limoges, there was, of course, there\nwas the region of Cognac, and towards the coast there were evidently fatalities. After the\nlanding in later weeks, some of our groups and us, we were involved in researching --\ntraveling and researching with farmers and with the countryside people who might have\nfound soldiers, American, Canadian or British soldiers, also some of the Polish-exile forces.\nWe helped in grave research. It was grave registration. That's what we did, we helped. Later,\nthere were some USO\u201d halls were established, which we helped out with. But right after the\nlanding and when Limoges was liberated, a committee was formed in Limoges.\nIt was called COJDASOR -- Comit\u00e9 Juif d'Assistance Social et Reconstruction -- the Jewish\nCommittee for Social Assistance and Reconstruction.\u201d* This was mainly geared to help\nrefugees -- people who had lived in the area and hidden out, and could not do any kind of\nwork during that period and really were penniless, to, to put them on their feet again. OSE\nwas one of the organizations connected with this. The Organization for Secours aux\nEnfants.\u2019 A children's organization, OSE. You are familiar with that, and some of those\nZionist organizations were involved, like WIZO~\u2019 and Hadassah. And this whole program,\nthat whole committee was supported by the American Joint Distribution Committee. So we\nhad an office in Limoges at 15 Avenue du Midi, and some of us, from our group working\npreviously with the underground with the false ID papers, became employed by that office.\nAnd as later, after liberation of Paris, which was in August of '44, and later the victory when\npeople came back from the camps, again this Committee did a good job of, number one,\nhelping them to get over the first hump, and later to establish themselves with a residence.\nEven helped them find relatives, because the Committee was in touch with the Red Cross\nand other organizations and institutions that were, after the war, spring up here and there to\njust see who had survived and who can be reached. And all these communication means\nwere used to, whether it was by telegraph or radio or whatever. But the COJDASOR was\nthat committee that was established afterwards, and I worked for that. But between the\nlanding and actually the liberation, there was just a very short time. Because, because France\nfell pretty fast to the forces of Resistance, and then the Germans were arrested. And the rest\ntook place in the north of France, of course, where the advancing Allied troops just entered\nParis in August of '44. And had one major scare 1n the winter of '44, when after the Battle of\nthe Bulge the Germans actually advanced far enough to pose a renewed threat to Paris. But\nthat -- again, time took care of that.\n*\u2019 United Service Organization\n*> The actual name was: Comit\u00e9 Juif d'Action Social et de Reconstruction; Jewish\nCommittee for Social Action and Reconstruction (French).\n*\u2019 The name of the organization is Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (French), and is\nreferred to as the Children\u2019s Rescue Network in English.\n** Women\u2019s International Zionist Organization",
        "A: As I said before, it was almost an unbelievable feeling to know that the day has finally come.",
        "A: Oh, the liberation, yeah. Limoges was freed, was just another normal day, except seeing\nGermans patrolling the streets and Gestapo patrolling the streets and being in charge here\nand being in charge there, you saw columns of Gestapo and Germans being led down the\nstreet by Resistance fighters. The great victorious German army led down the street by\nyoung people in rag tag outfits. That was the...that was the impact. Just a few weeks earlier,\nI was in a railroad station and saw a column...a unit of German soldiers, waiting for a train\nthat they were taking to some direction. They were sitting on the platform, on their\nrucksacks, on their equipment, with their guns standing up, leaning against each other,\nbayonets drawn, you know. They have this triangular thing, arrangement there. One of the\nsoldiers was opening up -- cutting open a can of sardines with his bayonet. Trying to open it\nup; and then he ate the sardines out of his -- out of the can, swallowing them all in all. And in\nhis language, I recognized he must have been either an Austrian or a Bavarian, because\nhaving been born in Vienna, I knew what the Austrian accent was.\nAnd he said, in German -- which I will not tell you in German, but I will tell you that in the\nEnglish translation, \"The people that are walking by here,\" he says, \"those French people\nhere. They will look at us and will say to themselves, \u2018Schon schaut Sie aus, diese\nReichsdeutsche Armee!'\"\u201d\u2019--\"She sure looks good, that victorious German army!\" In a\nfacetious way. And when we saw those German prisoners walking down the main street of --\nwith their arms raised on top of their heads, disarmed...that came to my mind. \"You look\ngood, you victorious German Army! Now that you are guarded by a rag tag outfit, you act\nlike you are the victims.\" Or something like that. That was the main impact. And that picture,\nthat -- imagine that scene repeated itself over and over in France in all the little villages and\ntowns that became liberated, one by one by one. The collaborators were arrested, too.\nUnfortunately, there was also during that period a lot of spur of the moment, perhaps hasty,\nemotional reaction to those that we, the underground had perceived as being collaborators,\nlike selling, dealing black market, or cohorting or fraternizing with some of the German\nofficers -- including some of the people that we had known, our own people. And it was not\nuncommon for someone whom we knew who did black market, even if they were Jewish, to\nbe executed actually without trial, without jury, without due process. But the emotions were\nso high that these things happened 1n I wouldn't just say a few cases. There were quite --\nthere were many.",
        "A: I had an aunt in Baltimore, who already in 1941 had sent me papers to...the affidavit to join\nher here in America. But with the advent of the Pearl Harbor and America entering the war,\nthose documents expired, fell by the wayside. In 1946, I received new papers, new affidavits,\nfrom my aunt here in Baltimore. I applied for the night to immigrate to the United States, and\nI joined here my aunt here in 1947. I have a sheet here that shows that I was on a preferential\nquota -- I was born in Austria. And also, one that my travel to the United States is in the\nnational interest of the United States, simply because I worked for that group that did grave\nregistration and I was also involved in the postal censor, postal censor service in Paris later,\nunder the guidance of a army lieutenant, Sonja Beaumont. A lady. I was with the postal\ncensor service for a little while in Paris. I spoke several languages, and so I was a few\nmonths there in that capacity. So I came to the United States in 1947.",
        "A: I married in America. Married an American young woman in 1952, and we have three\nchildren.
