        "Q: The date is August 6, 1992 and we\u2019re speaking with Dr. Marsha Rozenblit in Silver Spring,\nMaryland. Dr. Rozenblit is going to tell us about her father and his family, and any family\nmembers that she can recall. So please, could you tell me your father\u2019s name, his date of birth\nand then anything you can about his childhood and his family.",
        "A: Okay, my father whose name was Mendel Rozenblit was born on November 13, 1907 in a town\ncalled Lukow in Poland. Anyway this town was in the area of Lublin, I don\u2019t know exactly in\nwhich direction or ...... Okay, so my father was born in Lukow which was near Lublin in 1907.\nHe was born into a pretty religious family. I think that parts of the family were associated with\nthe Hasidim. But he did not grow up technically as a Hasidic child. He was just an ordinary\ntraditionally religious Polish Jewish boy. His father died when he was very young, well not\nvery young I guess. Well let me go backwards a little bit. My father was one of about six or\nseven children and he was in the middle. He was not the oldest or the youngest; he was one of\nthe middle children. His father died when he was a young boy. I think, if my memory serves\nme correctly, he was about twelve when his father died, which means his father died just after\nWorld War I of asthma. But I think he was sickly for most of his life. But my grandmother,\nthat is my father\u2019s mother whose name was --well I should say that my father\u2019s father\u2019s name\nwas Avraham Rozenblit -- and his mother Masha Markusfeld Rozenblit, after whom I\u2019m named\nMarsha -- Masha, his mother managed quite well to have six children and run the family. She\nowned a, well my mother used to say she owned a general store, but my cousin in Israel who\nwas seventeen when he left Poland and really knew her, said that she basically owned a shoe\nstore. That is, she sold other things too, but it was mostly shoes and what she would do is, she\nwould take trips to Warsaw or Lublin and see what was in the fancy shoe stores there and then\ncopy them and arranged to have the shoes made. She didn\u2019t make them herself. She wasn\u2019t a\nshoemaker but she would get them made and then sell them, both in the store and also in a kind\nof...She would send her children out to sell them also, when they were grown, to sell them to\nthe peasants in the villages. That I learned from my cousin in Israel. But let me just try to say\nsomething about my father\u2019s family background in general before I talk more specifically. They\nwere a very religious family and pictures of my father show him wearing the sort of traditional\ncap of the Polish Jews, you know that sort of squarish cap. I can\u2019t tell from the pictures\nwhether he has pais or not. It\u2019s hard to tell, but maybe he did. I should say before I go on that\nmy father died, Mendel Rozenblit, the survivor that we\u2019re talking about, died in 1961 when I\nwas ten years old so that most of my recollections come from either things I actually remember\nhim saying, or things that my mother told me that he had said, or things that my cousin in Israel,\nthat is his nephew, Mordecai Rozenblit, who came to Palestine in 1938 has told me. So it\u2019s a\nsort of conglomerate of those things. So, in any case it was a traditional religious family in the\nLublin area. His mother owned this shoe store. I don\u2019t think she was rich but she was\nreasonably prosperous and my father had all of these brothers and sisters. His oldest, I don\u2019t\neven know the age order, I think Nehama the sister, he had one sister and five brothers I believe,\nand the sister, Nehama, was I think the oldest and then there were other brothers. There was\nSimcha, there was Haim Yakov, there was Meir who was the baby, there was Yehoshua and I\nknow how most of them died actually and I\u2019ll get back to that later when we talk about it. But\nHaim Yakov was a very ardent Zionist and he left Poland before the war. He went to Palestine\nin 1937 and then his son Mordecai joined him in 1938.",
        "Q: Were the rest of the family involved in Zionism, do you know?",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t know. My cousin, Mutti, Mordecai, in Israel has many times told me that\nyou know, he had said to me, [Marsha, at yahdat ha abba shelach lo haya Zioni] which means\nMarsha, your father wasn\u2019t a Zionist. But I think that\u2019s not true. I think that Mutti means by\nthat, that my father didn\u2019t move to Palestine after the war. And Mutti 1s still mad at him forty\nyears later for not having done that. I do have his Zionist membership card from after the war.\nBut, of course, everybody was a Zionist after the war. So the question is was he an active\nZionist before the war. Judging from the schools he sent his children to I don\u2019t think so. That is\nan active Zionist. I don\u2019t think he was active in the Zionist movement, no. But he was\nprobably sympathetic to Zionism.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you about the town. Have you researched or found out anything about that\ntown, was it a shtetl or.....?",
        "A: Well, all towns are shtetls, shtetl just means little town.",
        "Q: What was the nature of this town?",
        "A: It was a small town. I don\u2019t know how big it was. It certainly wasn\u2019t a large place. Lublin was\nin central Poland so it was central Poland. I think my image of it as a child was that it was like\nany small American town with white picket fences and neat little houses on neat little streets.\nAnd I was shocked in 1972 or \u201903, I was talking to Lucin Dovarshitsky who teaches Polish-\nAmerican history at YIBO and who is a member of whatever the staff at the YIBO Institute and\nLucin Dovarshitsky at the time was busy collecting lots and lots and lots of pictures for the\nImage Before My Eyes volume and I said my father was from Lukow and he said well I\u2019ve got\na picture of Lukow, come and see it. So I went upstairs to his office and I looked at this picture\nof Lukow and it was not my image. I mean it was a muddy little street. This was a picture\ntaken in 1926 and it was this dreary little muddy town. So it was a tiny little nothing of a town,\nI think. Although my cousin Mutti in Israel who was seventeen when he left Lukow has nice\nmemories of it so 1t couldn\u2019t have been that horrendous. I mean maybe this picture doesn\u2019t do it\njustice. He has nice memories. My father left Lukow when he married and lived near Warsaw.\nIll get to that in a minute. So his adult life was not in Lukow, it was in a Warsaw suburb. The\nstories of his childhood that he told me when I was little were certainly not negative. If his\nfamily was prosperous, even if they weren\u2019t rich they wouldn\u2019t have suffered much.",
        "Q: Do you know much about his education, where he went to school?",
        "A: He went to cheder. He was born in 1907. He was born when that part of Poland was part of the\nRussian Empire. I know he just went to traditional cheder. He did not have a formal secular\neducation as far as I know. I do know that he could read Polish easily and that means that he\nmust have had some secular education. All the schooling he ever spoke of was cheder. On the\nother hand since he could read Polish novels he must have also gone to something else. He\ndidn\u2019t have a gymnasium education, that I know. He didn\u2019t go to university. But he must have\ngone to some Polish school as well as cheder because you can\u2019t read Polish easily if you hadn\u2019t.\nSpeaking it is one thing but knowing it 1s another. So I think that he and virtually all his\nsiblings just went to cheder and maybe also some kind of Polish elementary school. There is\none thing that 1s important and that is his younger brother, Meir, wanted very much to have a\nreal secular education and he did go to Polish school and gymnasium in their town, or maybe\nnot in their town, it\u2019s hard to say since I was only ten when my father died, he may have just\nsaid gymnasium and maybe Meir went off to Lublin to go to gymnasium, I don\u2019t know. In any\ncase my grandmother who was a religious woman, who wore a sheitel and so forth, nevertheless\nwas willing to let her youngest son go to gymnasium. This must have been already, since Meir\nis younger than my father, this must have been after World War 1. It must have been in the\ntwenties. And the town was very mad at her for doing this. So she was something of a\nprogressive because she was, although very religious, was willing to let her son go to\ngymnasium, and of course going to gymnasium meant going to school on Saturday. And\ntheoretically Jews were exempt from writing. And in fact, they were. But obviously it spoke of\nabandoning traditional Jewish life and entering the larger world. She was certainly willing to do\nthis and was willing to defy the town to let this happen. I remember my father telling a story\nabout how there was a library in town, like a secular library. Now maybe it was a Zionist\nlibrary, may it was Pol.....[ don\u2019t know what and a lit of the \u201cfrumies\u2019\u2019, a lot of the very\nreligious people in town marched against it and they tried to burn it down. And my\ngrandmother, who was herself religious and not secular, nevertheless sort of defied them and\ninsisted that her son Meir go to gymnasium. Actually Meir had a very different experience\nfrom all the rest of them. Meir not only went to Polish gymnasium but after he graduated from\ngymnasium, and this must have been into the \u201830\u2019s at some point, he went to university to study\nto be a doctor. He didn\u2019t go in Poland because it was very difficult for Jews to do that in\nPoland. He went first in Italy and then in Paris. He was presumably deported from Paris to\nAuschwitz because he was dead too. So his experience was different from everybody else\u2019s.\nOne brother went to Palestine where he died a natural death in 1943 of a heart attack. Haim\nYakov is the one who went to Palestine and Meir was in France.",
        "Q: Do you have pictures of either of them?",
        "A: I have pictures of Meir as a baby. No, actually as an adult, too. Come to think of it, yes, there\nis a picture of Meir as an adult, two pictures of Meir as adults. One from Italy and one I\u2019m not\nsure where from. He went to Pisa and studied medicine and then he was in Paris. I think he\nmarried in Paris but I don\u2019t think he had children. And I don\u2019t know what happened to his wife.\nI don\u2019t know if she was deported or not deported. My father never tried to look her up after the\nwar. And my mother, after my father\u2019s death, was suspicious that perhaps Meir\u2019s wife wasn\u2019t\nJewish and that\u2019s why my father hadn\u2019t bothered to look her up after the war because he was in\nMunich for two and a half years after the war, he could have. And he knew his brother was in\nParis. And he found out that his brother had been deported so he could have presumably\ninvestigated his brother\u2019s wife but he didn\u2019t. That may mean that the family was angry that he\nhad married a non-Jewish woman or something like that. Anyway Meir\u2019s experience as an\neducated Jew, as an educated person and the fact that Haim Yakov was a devout Zionist, I think\nindicates that this family, while very religious, clearly had its arms out to the modern world,\neither through Jewish nationalism or through secular education. And it\u2019s also true that my\nfather, although raised as a very religious little boy, as an adult was not religious. As an adult in\nPoland, I don\u2019t mean in America after the war, that\u2019s something else. But as an adult in Poland\nwas not as religious as he had been growing up. He had a kosher home, he sent his kids to\nJewish schools, he was very Jewish, but that was normal in Poland. People did that. But he\nwas not that observant a Jew as an adult in the thirties as he had been growing up although his\nmother remained religious. And I assume some of his siblings were and some weren\u2019t. I really\ndon\u2019t know. That would be a nice question to ask. My cousin in Israel would know all these\nanswers because he was seventeen when he left and he would have a better sense of who was\nreligious and who was not. Anyway what else can I say about just his family background. His\nmother had this store. I think several of his brothers were involved in running the store or in, as\nI said, selling to the peasants. But some of the brothers moved. He himself moved to Warsaw.\nI think another brother, Simcha moved to Warsaw. I\u2019m not sure where his sister Nehama lived\nwhen she grew up. I mean they were all adults by the \u00b0\u201830\u2019s and they were all married and had\nchildren and so forth. The only thing I could say I suppose my grandmother, Masha Markusfeld\nRozenblit, I mean \u2018Markusfeld\u201d is very important. She was a Markusfeld. Rozenblit was\nsomething that accrued to her but she was a Markusfeld. She must have been a very feisty lady,\nshe sounds like it. She ran this store, she had her six kids \u2018which she raised by herself, or at\nleast partly. We have a picture of her. She looks like a Jewish woman from Poland but she was\nkind of a neat lady, I think.",
        "Q: Do you know when she was born?",
        "A: No, but she was in her sixties when she was killed. So that would make her born in the 1880\u2019s.\nRight and if my father was born in 1907 that\u2019s about right. So she would have been born in the\n1880\u2019s or 1870\u2019s, probably in the 1870\u2019s if he was born in 1907 and he was not her first child,\nhe was her third or fourth child. And I think my father\u2019s father, Avraham Rozenblit, he was\nprobably in his forties when he died, in around 1919 say so that means he was born also in the\n1870\u2019s. My father, by the way, even though he did not have formal higher education or even\nsecondary education, knew a lot of languages like many Jews of that part of the world. Yiddish\nwas of course his native language like it was for virtually all the Jews of Poland except a small\ngroup of hyper-assimilated Jews. But he was fluent in Polish and that was common for his\ngeneration, that is people who came of age in the twenties and thirties knew increasingly also,\nunless they were just Hasidim, increasingly really knew Polish. And certainly my cousin Mutti,\nthe one who moved to Palestine in 1937, \u201938, Mutti went to Polish public school in the thirties\nand has very fond memories of his teachers in the Polish elementary school in Lukow, that they\nwere not anti-Semitic. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s telling the whole truth when he says that, it may be\nnostalgia. I mean he has unkind words about Poles in general but his teachers were very loving\nand very nice and he has very fond memories of going to elementary school in Polish although\nhow deep his Polish language knowledge is, is hard to say, because at this point in the 1990\u2019s\nafter living in Israel for fifty odd years he really can speak only Hebrew and Yiddish and\nEnglish which he learned tn the British army during World War II but his Polish, I think, is so\nrusty that he didn\u2019t use it. But anyway my father knew Yiddish of course which was his mother\ntongue, Polish which he spoke totally fluently. He knew Hebrew. Now that\u2019s unusual. That\nwould indicate also a Zionist whatever. I don\u2019t know. My mother says he knew Hebrew. Now\nwhat does that mean. She says, she insisted that he spoke modern Israeli Hebrew, that he could\neasily speak Hebrew to an Israeli. I don\u2019t remember that although we did have an Israeli\nneighbor in the fifties and my mother says he spoke to her in Hebrew. Now maybe he said three\nwords and my mother thought that meant he...... Certainly he had a traditional cheder\neducation and he was well versed. He wasn\u2019t a Talmudist but he knew Hebrew in the way a\ntraditionally educated Jew knew Hebrew. It wasn\u2019t rote. He could look at the prayer book or at\na bible and understand what it said. He knew Russian. I don\u2019t know if he could read or write\nRussian but he certainly could speak Russian and he knew German. So he knew his languages.\nOkay what else can I say about just childhood. My father was clearly a very mischievous little\nboy because there are several stories that I remember of him directly telling me for example\nabout how they tormented the Malamed at cheder, how they tormented the teacher at the\ntraditional Jewish school in the cheder. In fact I remember when I was in Hebrew school as a\nchild he would say to me, Marsha you must never do the things to your teacher that we did, that\nI did to our teachers. And he did all the things you read about in all the Haskala, I mean putting\ntacks on the chair and putting honey on the chair and they just bedeviled the life of the poor\nteacher, which was standard, standard childhood high-jinx. And the other thing 1s that his sister\nNehama who was older than he, probably three or four years older even though she was three\nchildren older, his sister Nehama wanted a date. World War I was a kind of liberating\nexperience, not the war itself, that was just a horrible experience. In the aftermath of the war\nthings really opened up and social life really changed. And she wanted to go out on dates but\nher mother didn\u2019t want her to because her mother was still very traditional. And so my father\nand another one of his brothers would conspire with her to sneak her out of the house. And they\ndid this through some kind of closet, some armoire, in Europe they have these closets and\napparently they would move it against the window and open the window and open the back of\nthe closet. I don\u2019t remember the exact details but I have vivid memories of riding in our family\ncar in the 1950\u2019s with my father telling me stories about how they would trick his mother so that\nNehama could go out on a date with probably the man she ended up marrying. But, you know,\nnothing serious. She didn\u2019t cover her hair, actually. Pictures we have of her or that I\u2019ve seen of\nher as an adult, she didn\u2019t cover her hair. So clearly this was a very mischievous child. He\nalways had a twinkle in his eyes as an adult, too, so he clearly was the kind.....and survivors, of\ncourse, were often the kind of people who were mischievous sorts. Okay, I think I don\u2019t know\nvery much more about my father\u2019s real childhood, that is when he was a baby. If I think of\nanything I'll come back to it. My father got married pretty young. He got married when he was\nabout twenty or twenty-one to a cousin of his whom he loved very deeply. So this was also\nnon-traditional in a way, that is it was a love marriage, not an arranged one.",
        "Q: Was it a first cousin?",
        "A: You know I think it was a first cousin. I think it was his first cousin. I\u2019m not a hundred per cent\npositive that she was his first cousin but she was definitely his cousin. Her father owned a\nlumber yard in the Warsaw area in a town called Wolomin, which I think is spelled\nW OL OMIN,Imnota hundred per cent sure but I think so. It\u2019s in the Warsaw area. So\nhe moved to Warsaw, or to Wolomin, and he ran his father-in-law\u2019s business or worked with his\nfather-in-law in running the business. His wife though, whose name was either Mira or Perella\nI don\u2019t remember which, his wife though died about a week after their first child was born\nbecause she had a rheumatic heart and she was warned by doctors not to have any children and\nshe then didn\u2019t listen. She wanted a child, it wasn\u2019t accidental. They weren\u2019t that religious and\nshe died very shortly after he was born.",
        "Q: So you think she was probably about twenty years old?",
        "A: She was probably twenty, twenty-one. I think my father was twenty-one and she was probably\nthe same age or a year younger. She was very young. Their son\u2019s name was Avraham. He was\nnamed after my father\u2019s father. Avraham was born therefore, let\u2019s see in 1943 when he was\nkilled, he was twelve. So he was born in 1931. So my father wasn\u2019t twenty-one, he was\ntwenty-four. Well, whatever. These stories have gotten passed from my mother who was not\nespecially good at dates but I think Avraham was born either in 1930 or 1931. And his wife\ndied and he was very, very miserable, naturally. And the family talked him into marrying her\nsister whose name was either Mira or Perella. In other words, Mira and Perella were his wives.\nI just don\u2019t remember which was the first and which was the second. I think Perella was the\nsecond. I think Mira was the first. Again I\u2019m really not a hundred percent sure. Again my\ncousin in Israel would know the answer. And they had another child.",
        "Q: The family talked him into it. Was this under duress then that he did this?",
        "A: No, I think they talked him into it in the sense that this is the smartest and best thing to do. The\nchild needs a mother, what better mother than her sister. She needs a husband, she\u2019s a nice lady,\nwhy don\u2019t you just marry her. You know I think it was that kind of thing. And he was very\ndepressed and he needed a mother for his child and maybe she was already taking care of the\nkid. I don\u2019t know exactly but he definitely married her. And it was all right. Obviously it was\nsad. I didn\u2019t know this when I was a child. When I was a child my father was very open and\ntalked a huge amount about his Holocaust experience and about his life before the war. But for\nwhatever reason, maybe because it was ordinary tragedy rather than the special Jewish tragedy\nof the Holocaust, he didn\u2019t tell me about the fact that his first wife had died. He thought that\nwould be too sad for me. Here he was telling me about his son and daughter who had been\nslaughtered by the Nazis. And that he could tell me about. But the specific tragedy of his own\npersonal life with his wife\u2019s death he didn\u2019t tell me. I found out when I was twenty or\nsomething. A cousin of his in America was visiting us and she just mentioned it casually. I\nsaid, what are you talking about? And she told me the whole story and I just bawled. It was\nvery sad that this love of his life died in childbirth. But anyway he did have a daughter with the\nsecond wife. Her name was Toby. That\u2019s what my mother called her. It\u2019s probably Tova,\nwhich again sounds both modern and Hebraic, Gittel is the Yiddish. Tova is already a sign of\nmodernity in its modern Jewish form. She was four years younger than Avraham. So she\nwould have been born in 1934 or \u201935, something like that, or \u00b033 depending on exactly when\nAvraham was born. And my father continued to live in Wolomin with his wife and running this\nlumberyard. He sent his kids to -- there were several Jewish school systems in Poland as you\nknow. There was the Zionist school system and the Bundist school system and the \u201cfrumie\u2019\u2019,\nthe religious school system and so forth. He sent his children to a school system that was very\nlike American Jewish Day schools, that is Jewish subjects which were taught in Hebrew and\nsecular subjects were taught in Polish which was not the case in the Zionist or Bundist schools\nwhere everything was taught either in Hebrew or Yiddish with only a minimal amount of\nPolish. So his children went to this kind of modern Jewish school which means, of course, that\nit was a little bit more religious than both the Zionist or the Bundist schools which would\nindicate a kind of moderate religious position. So that\u2019s the kind of school he sent his kids to.\nAs I said he kept a kosher home. I don\u2019t think he was Sabbath observing. So he was kind of a\nlittle traditional, but not....",
        "Q: And they spoke Yiddish at home, I assume.",
        "A: You know I don\u2019t know what language. Certainly growing up he spoke Yiddish at home, that\ngoes without saying. What language did he speak as an adult in his family in Wolomin? I don\u2019t\nknow. I really don\u2019t know if he spoke Yiddish or Polish or both. You know if you\u2019 re utterly\nfluent it probably depends on your mood. Yiddish was definitely his mother tongue, what he\ndreamed in, what he counted in was definitely Yiddish, but I don\u2019t know. I bet they spoke\nYiddish. I think most Jews spoke Yiddish.",
        "Q: That would be my guess.",
        "Q: My guess would be Yiddish although maybe sometimes Polish depending if the kids came back\nfrom school and spoke Polish, then you answered them in Polish and then all of a sudden for an\nhour you were talking Polish. But then if you stopped talking for a minute and then started\ntalking again you probably would speak Yiddish because Yiddish was the natural thing to speak.\nAfter the war in America my father was utterly fluent in English. He learned English very\nquickly and spoke English with my mother who was American born. But with his friends from\nLukow who had survived the war, and some of them had as partisans and so on, these friends\nwho were in America, their natural language that they spoke was Yiddish although all of them\nwere modern. None of them were orthodox and so forth. The natural language they would\nspeak was Yiddish. But sometimes they would just speak Polish and it would drive my mother\ncrazy because as an American Jew she did know Yiddish but she didn\u2019t know Polish. And she\nwould get very angry with them when they spoke Polish and the angrier she got the more they\nwould speak Polish to make her angrier because they were very jealous of her because she had\nparents because she was American and they didn\u2019t. The thing they had on her was that they\ncould speak more languages and so they would speak Polish. But my guess is that Yiddish\nwould be the language of his home. I don\u2019t know what kind of home he lived in. He was\ncertainly reasonably prosperous, certainly middle class and definitely in contact with his family\nin Lukow. He still had brothers and I think his sister was there. His mother certainly was there.\nOf course he had aunts and uncles and cousins and nieces and nephews. All of his brothers and\nsisters had married. They all had children. He was the closest with his sister. The sibling he\ntalked the very most about was his sister. They were named for the same person. Mendel is a\nYiddish nickname for Menachem and so technically his name was Menachem Mendel Tzidik. I\nshould tell you my father\u2019s formal name was Menachem Mendel Tzidik Rosenblit which would\ntranslate -- Tzidik 1s Tzadok. Just a Jewish way of saying Tzadok and Nehama, his sister, who\nwas called Nechuma, ?? raised eyes that she was called Nechuma. Nechuma was obviously\nnamed for the same person. She was born first and they named her Nehama to be after\nwhatever relative, Menachem. So when my father was born they named him after the same\nrelative. So he was very close with his sister and he talked about Meir because Meir was\nunusual because he was the one who had the secular education and had gone off to study\nmedicine. That was all he talked about with any specificity except in terms of how each of\nthem died in the Holocaust and I can tell you about that when we talk about the war years. I\ndon\u2019t know what his wife did. I don\u2019t know if his wife worked or not. Probably not given the\n1930\u2019s in Poland and middle class family. I doubt that she worked. They were definitely\nmiddle class. This is not somebody making -- with nostalgia, hindsight, looking back because\nwell maybe this isn\u2019t a good historical -- forget this. I was going to say I\u2019ve seen the list of\nproperty that he presented to the United Restitution Organization as part of his reparation claim.\nIt\u2019s the kind of things middle class people have, you know silver and whatever, fur coats and so\nforth. But you know people could lie on those so that\u2019s not necessary a good source. I think\nthat despite the very terrible situation for Jews in Poland in the 1930\u2019s, you know very high\nanti-Semitism and very terrible economy and so forth. That my father did reasonably well. He\ncertainly didn\u2019t give any thought as far as I know to migrating, although, there was no place to\nmigrate to except for Palestine. And he wasn\u2019t enough of a Zionist to want to go to Palestine\nalthough his brother Haim Yakov did. They had relatives in America like probably every Jew in\nPoland but America was out of the question by the twenties so I think he was perfectly content\nto be in Poland. In terms of his attitude to Poland as a country, actually when he was born, he\nwas born in Russia, and of course the Polish Jews hated Russia because they were discriminated\nagainst so severely, I think he thought of himself as a Polish national. I think he was a typical\nJew in Poland in the sense that his primary identity was as a Jew. If you asked him, who are\nyou, what are you, he would say Iam a Jew. But he was Polish, he spoke Polish, he identified\nwith the Polish state. He thought of himself as a Polish subject. He used that word actually.\nHe called himself a Polish subject which is a funny archaic word which is usually used for\nkingdoms. But that\u2019s how Jews were in Poland. They were members of the Polish state but they\nweren\u2019t Poles so he would never have said that he was a Pole because he wasn\u2019t a Pole, he was\na Jew. I suppose he was hoping that the Polish Republic would get to be a nicer place than it\nwas. As I said I was ten when he died and at ten I didn\u2019t ask him such nice interesting political\nquestions as what you thought about Poland and how you related to Poland and so on. What\nelse could I tell you about right before the war?",
        "Q: This is good. This is all good and it\u2019s what we need.",
        "A: That\u2019s what you need. So basically before the war, on the eve of the war, in 1939, on\nSeptember 1, 1939, my father had a business that was reasonably prosperous. He lived in a\ntown near Warsaw called Wolomin. He had a wife; he had two children, a boy and a girl. He\nhad a huge extended family. He had a very large family, he had a mother and sisters and\nbrothers, nieces and nephews, aunts and uncles, cousins. He had a large and intact and\nfunctioning family. And then the war started.",
        "Q: So what happened?",
        "A: What happened, okay. You know I\u2019m used to telling the story to my six -year old son and of\ncourse to my six- year old son I have to include what happened during the war. I have to sketch\nout the war and what the Nazis did to the Jews and I don\u2019t have to do that here. In the first\nmonths of the war there was just chaos and all kinds of restrictions against the Jews. I assume\nthat his business was Aryanized because that\u2019s what the Germans did as soon as they came in.\nThey Aryanized businesses giving them to ethnic Germans. I assume my father was not\ncompensated for it. He was a clever man. He probably managed to get stuff out of it before it\nwas technically Aryanized. In all the stories he talked about the years before he was deported to\nAuschwitz he never mentioned that he was starving to death and he was living on the street or\nanything like that. Of course he was starving but he wasn\u2019t......He must have managed to get\nsomething out of his business even though he wasn\u2019t compensated for it. You read about this in\nthe memoirs people who with Polish friends manage to make arrangements and deals and so\nforth. But anyway his business was confiscated, his bank accounts frozen, all of those things\ntaken from him. But then, of course, he was in the ghetto. Now when my father was alive and\nhe talked about his experiences in the war he always simply said the ghetto. He didn\u2019t specify\nwhich one. When my mother, who is not a historian and who is not at all good with details and\nin fact was terrible with details, when my mother talked about it for him, after he died, or when\nI would ask her as I got a little older, well which ghetto, she said the Warsaw ghetto, that he was\nin the Warsaw ghetto. Some of the details of his story very much match the Warsaw ghetto in\nterms of.....well the fact 1s he escaped from the ghetto when it was burning in April 1943.\nThat\u2019s the Warsaw ghetto. What other ghetto was burning in April \u201943 that you could escape\nfrom in some way. But on the other hand, he didn\u2019t live in Warsaw. He lived in Wolomin which\nwas close to Warsaw. There could have been a ghetto in Wolomin. On the other hand it was so\nclose to Warsaw that all the people may have been moved to Warsaw. But usually people who\nhad to move into a place did very, very badly. And my father obviously didn\u2019t fare badly. I\nthink that he probably was in the Warsaw ghetto. He probably did just simply get moved from\nWolomin into Warsaw. Let\u2019s say for the purposes of this record that he was in the Warsaw\nghetto.",
        "Q: Have you looked up any of the records about Wolomin if they did transfer them at some point?",
        "A: No, I have never done that. It\u2019s funny, I\u2019m a historian and not a genealogist and so \u2019'm\ninterested in what happened to the Jews and I\u2019ve never bothered to look up the specifics of my\nfather\u2019s experience in any systematic way. A lot of his experiences that he described are very,\nvery similar to what you read in the memoirs. So it fits in very well. But I never tried\nto.....when I was reading Itzhak Arrad\u2019s book about ???? Treblinka which is about the operation\n??? death camps which basically gassed all the Jews of Poland and certainly the region he was\nliving in because the section of Poland that both he and his family was in was the general\ngovernment. The Germans came in and annexed the Bartoland and created the general\ngovernment and the Soviets took the eastern part of Poland. So my father was in the general\ngovernment. Anyway when I read that I did pay attention to see if there was any word about\nWolomin. There was description of deportations from Wolomin but I don\u2019t know. There\nprobably are no records of the Wolomin ghetto. In any case, for the sake of argument I say that\nmy father was in the Warsaw ghetto. I think he may have worked for the Jewish Council. He\nnever said that. This is not a memory I have from him or from my mother or from my cousin\nMutti who wouldn\u2019t have known because my cousin Mutti could only give me information\nabout the pre-war period because he left in 1938. I have a memory from when I was a child of a\nfriend of my father\u2019s from Wolomin, a man who had been a worker of his in his lumberyard\nwho he was in Auschwitz with and who had also survived and who remained a friend after the\nwar. He\u2019s still alive, a man named Shaya May. I think he\u2019s still alive. He was alive five years\nago when my mother died because I called him but I assume he\u2019s still alive. Shaya once I\nremember when I was a child, it was right after my father died, too, actually he was talking to\nmy mother about my father during the war. He mentioned something about my father working\nfor that traitorous Council or something like that. A lot of Jews hated the Council. He was\ncertainly not a member of the Council, of the 24 hot shots on the Council because I certainly\nwould have come across his name if he were. The Warsaw ghetto Judenhad had several\nhundred employees so he may have known someone who knew somebody who got him a job on\nthe Council. So he may have worked on the Council. From my memories of all the stories of\nthe ghetto years I don\u2019t have any sense that he was in terrible shape. Obviously all the Jews had\nvery little food and fuel and so forth. Things were very difficult in the ghettoes. But his family\nwas intact. He had a son and his daughter. His son and daughter attended school. I think his\nwife taught school in the ghetto. My mother said that. Either she taught school or she taught\npiano. I think both stories, I remember. So she was involved in this kind of moral resistance\nthat took place, the organization of clandestine schools, and sort of doing moral and cultural and\nso forth things. I don\u2019t think I know very much more about the specific ghetto experience.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t know if they lived with other families or....?",
        "A: That I just don\u2019t know. The only person who might know is Shaya May but Shaya never\nwanted to talk about his experiences very much whereas my father talked about it all the time. I\nshould add I have another source about my father\u2019s experiences and that is that when he went to\nschool in America, when he came to America, the equivalent of \u201cWhat I did on my summer\nvacation,\u201d he had to write an essay about his experiences. He had to write an essay that\ndescribed his experiences during the war, I guess, so he wrote, I have part of that essay, part of\nit is missing. But he just says I suffered terribly and goes on. He doesn\u2019t provide specific\ndetails about what it was like in the ghetto or in the camps. There was also, of course, the\ntestimony that he provided to B. Goodmachen for the reparation claim which my mother typed\nand of which there is no copy although she swears she made one. She doesn\u2019t know what\nhappened to it and she suspects that my father actually destroyed the copy. I don\u2019t know why.\nBut the copy just doesn\u2019t exist. Most of her memories I suppose come from that formal\ndocument that she typed for him. So I don\u2019t know if he lived with others or what the situation\nwas. Probably he did, most Jews did, it was a very crowded situation. Most of his family, of\ncourse, was in Lukow, in the Lukow ghetto although he had a brother in Warsaw. Simcha was\nin Warsaw and Simcha was shot for playing cards after curfew. He was shot during the time of\nthe ghetto. I mean for not playing cards but after playing cards going out in the street. So\nSimcha died before the deportations. And he had been in Warsaw because he had moved to\nWarsaw already in the thirties or twenties or something and I don\u2019t know why he had moved or\nwhat he did at all. Again my cousin Mutti would probably know although he may not because\nsince he was in Lukow he didn\u2019t really know the war.....he actually knew my father the least\nwell because my father was already in Warsaw. He remembers my father coming home to visit\ntwice or three times and giving him a ball or something like that. His stories are really best.\nFrom my cousin Mutti in Israel I mostly learned about my grandmother, about Masha\nRozenblit, because that was his grandmother, too. Anyway so I really don\u2019t know much about\nthe ghetto years except that things were okay. His brother was shot but things were reasonably\nokay. Of course then came the deportations. During the deportations from the Lukow ghetto,\nhis mother was shot. She was in her sixties and rather than take her to Treblinka or Sobibor or\nwherever they were taking the Jews from Lukow, they shot her. Somebody must have\nwitnessed that because how else would he have known, he wasn\u2019t in Lukow. She was shot. I\nassume the rest of his relatives in Lukow, aunts, uncles, cousins, Shia and his family were\nprobably just deported to wherever Jews from Lukow were deported to and gassed.",
        "Q: Do you know what year this was, was it 43?",
        "A: No, well of all Polish Jewry, it\u2019s \u201942. The operation Rhinehart which just simply went\nmethodically and liquidated all the ghettoes began something like March of \u201942 and was over\nby October \u201942 with some pockets left. That is there were Jews left in the Warsaw ghetto and in\nthe....was it the Lublin? Yeah the Lublin ghetto was made into a labor camp and a couple of\nother places. There were pockets where they allowed Jews to still continue. Those were\ndestroyed in \u201943. I assume that probably all of those relatives were killed in \u201942 unless by some\nchance Shia or another one of his brothers was in the labor camp, in the Jeneska Road labor\ncamp or Poniyet Tovah, I forgot there were a whole bunch of labor camps in the Lublin area\nwhich maybe his brother or one of his nephews because if my father\u2019s son was already twelve\nby that time then his older brother\u2019s kids could have been teenagers. So maybe they were\nin.....But I just don\u2019t know. I assume that everybody was just killed in \u201942. His sister Nehama,\nthough, who lived in Lukow with her family, you know I wrote down that her name was\nPearlman but maybe her name was Bernstein. Yes, her name was Bernstein. Pearlman was my\nfather\u2019s wife\u2019s maiden name. She and her husband who was much shorter than her, that was the\njoke of the family, that Nehama who was very tall, I presumably look like Nehama, -- that when\nI was a kid we would go to the Lukow Young Men\u2019s Benevolent Association and all the people\nwho had come from my father\u2019s town -- and people would go Nehama, Nehama. They looked\nat me. I don\u2019t look like her in the pictures but they thought I looked like her. But anyway she\nand her family, her husband and her children (she probably had teen-age children) hid in the\nwoods. They somehow escaped the ghetto. I don\u2019t know if they escaped in 42 or if they\nescaped earlier but they were hiding in the woods near there in the Lublin region. And they\nwere only killed in \u201944, about three months before the end of the war in that part of Poland.\nThey were handed over by some Poles to the Nazis at that point. So I don\u2019t know what\nhappened to them if they were then sent to Auschwitz or if they were shot right away or\nwhatever. But they did succeed in hiding. Nechuma, I should be fair, her name was not\nNehama, her name was Nechuma. Actually she used a Polish name too, Helenie, she used the\nname Helenie. There are pictures on the back that say Helenie. I think she was the only one\nthat used a Polish name. My father didn\u2019t. He used Mendel, his Yiddish name and all the\nothers, Shia, Meir, they all used their Hebrew names. But she used both Nechuma and Helenie.\nBut anyway, Nechuma and her family, that had been hiding for years, at least for two, maybe\neven more than two, were handed over to the Nazis by some Poles for (as my mother used to\nsay, for a bottle of vodka). The Poles were given booty for handing over Jews. Now I don\u2019t\nknow if these people had just happened upon them and turned them over or if these were people\nwho had been helping them all along and then turned them over, because often people were\nhiding with the assistance of Poles. Maybe it was neighbors, good Poles who were helping\nthem who turned them over, who knows. I think that most of his family, the Lukow branch of\nthe family, his mothers and brothers and sisters, well whatever, there\u2019s not that many brothers\nby that time because Simcha and his family were in Warsaw and presumably they were\ndeported in 1942. Simcha had been shot earlier for curfew violations but presumably his family\nwas deported in \u201942 when most of the Jews in Warsaw were deported. In Lukow Haim, his\nbrother Haim Yakov had already gone to Palestine although his family hadn\u2019t. My father\u2019s\nbrother Haim Yakov had gone to Palestine in 1937 alone. His son Mutti, followed him in 1938\nleaving the wife and the other children. So they were all presumably killed also in \u201942. Shia\nwas there and his family presumably were all killed and Nehama was there but she was in\nhiding until \u00b044 when she was handed over to the Nazis, she and her family were handed over to\nthe Nazis and killed and of course Meir was in Paris and he was deported, I assume, again I\ndon\u2019t know this, but I assume he was deported in July of 1942 when the big raid in Paris took\nplace, July 16 I believe, 1942, when most Polish Jews in Paris were deported. Now this is not\nnecessarily true. He could have escaped to the south and have been picked up at some other\ntime. He definitely was deported to Auschwitz because after the war my cousin Mutti in Israel,\nhe was too upset to deal with the issue but his wife Zeporah, spent months dealing with the Red\nCross and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency to track down all the Rozenblit\nrelatives, also her own relatives from her own family. But her family was mostly in Palestine\nbecause they were all Zionist who\u2019d come mostly in the 20\u2019s. So she tracked them down and\nshe found my father and she found nobody else. So in fact the first time I saw those letters I\nwanted to cry because the first letter had to be in English, the Red Cross would only deal in\nEnglish. So the first letter to my father that my cousin Mutti wrote to his uncle was in English\nso I could read it easily and my father didn\u2019t know English yet but Mutti knew English and then\nof course all subsequent correspondence was just real letters because my father had a real\naddress and that was all in Yiddish which I could read too but with much more difficulty so I\ndidn\u2019t read it quite as easily. But she found nobody else. So I assume obviously she would\nhave found -- there were all these organizations after the war, all these Jewish and non-Jewish\norganizations tracking down people. So he was presumably killed either in \u00b042 or 43 or 44,\neverybody else. And Nehama definitely in 44. Simcha at some point before \u201942, everybody\nelse in \u2019\u00b042 except for my father and his family. In any case assuming that my father was in the\nWarsaw ghetto, his family was able to stay there after that initial depletion of the Warsaw ghetto\nin August/September of 1942. That confirms that he worked for the Jewish Council actually\nbecause the people who stayed in Warsaw, the 70,000 or so that remained after the major\nliquidation either worked for the Jewish Council or were involved in SS industry, or whatever\nindustry that was working for the German economy.",
        "Q: Maybe that lent itself also to them having slightly better food conditions or something like that.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Also I think the Wolomin ghetto was simply, I read that in Orad the Wolomin was\ntotally destroyed in 1942. So my father I know was in the ghetto until April of 1943. That\u2019s\nWarsaw, that April \u201943 date is so fundamentally Warsaw that he had to have been in the Warsaw\nghetto. In fact he always lit a yahrtzeit candle for his children at Pesach because that\u2019s around, I\nmean the Warsaw ghetto was finally liquidated on the second night of Pesach. And they didn\u2019t\ndie that night. [ll tell that story in a minute but it was just a few weeks later. So Pesach of\n1943, so Pesach is when he lit a yahrtzeit candle for everybody then. I don\u2019t know, maybe\nbecause he was in Warsaw and that had such an impact on his conscience. His mother was\nprobably shot at some point in 1942 not necessarily at Pesach. My father, therefore, and his\nwife and his children and his wife\u2019s sister who was crippled, not totally crippled but she\nschlepped a leg for whatever reason, they were together in the ghetto. So he was in the ghetto\nafter that liquidation in August/September 1942 when most of the people in the ghetto were\nliquidated. So he was one of the 70,000 that stayed in the ghetto until April of \u201943 when the\nNazis decided on the final liquidation of the ghetto. Now my father in 1943, he was born in\n1907, so in 1943 he was 36. Well he wasn\u2019t yet because his birthday 1s November, so he was 35\nyears old. And he had a twelve-year old son and an eight-year old daughter and a wife and a\nsister-in-law. And they decided to escape from the burning ghetto. Because of the uprising the\nNazis sort of bombed the ghetto and sent in firebombs and so forth and basically burned the\nghetto down. And my father and his family decided to escape from the ghetto. I don\u2019t know if\nthat means they went through the sewers or not. In Warsaw that\u2019s how people escaped from the\nghetto. This is where he really told. My father told the stories from the escape from the Warsaw\nghetto until liberation. That\u2019s what he told. The ghetto experience didn\u2019t interest him. That\nmust mean that it was not too terrible. My image of hearing the story as a child was that they\nescaped into the woods. But there are no woods around the Warsaw ghetto or around Warsaw\neven for that matter. So I don\u2019t know how they escaped, presumably they did it through the\nsewers. But in any case they escaped. Oh, I do know, my mother I think told me this that he\ndid make attempts through Polish, non-Jewish friends to get his children to be taken by non-\nJews. And nobody would do it. He was unable to get anybody to agree to do that. So anyway\nthere he was with his twelve year old, his eight year old, his wife and his sister-in-law and they\nescaped and somehow they made it to some woods, or maybe not to some woods, they were just\nout. They had a kind of pact that if one of them should get lost, they would not look for that\nperson because that could be problematic and instead if one of them should get lost, they should\ngo to a farm house that they knew which was some distance away, my memory is 90 kilometers\nbut I was a little kid when I heard this so I don\u2019t know where it was. Somehow Avraham, my\nfather\u2019s son, who by the way was not called Avraham, that\u2019s my way of Hebraisizing it again,\nit\u2019s Avremy, the Yiddish nickname for Abraham. Avremy who was twelve somehow got lost, he\nwasn\u2019t there. My father\u2019s wife said that she had to go look for Avremy and my father said no.\nWe'll lose you if you do that. We have to stick together and go to the farmhouse. We\u2019ll find\nAvremy at the farmhouse. And she just was mad with concern for her son who\u2019s not technically\nher son but she had raised him his whole life so he was her son. And she went to look for him\nand they never saw her again. I assume that means she was picked up by SS soldiers and by the\nSS and taken directly to Auschwitz which at that point was the only, by 1943 -- oh maybe not\nAuschwitz, maybe she was taken to Treblinka, I don\u2019t know where she was taken to but she was\npresumably killed. But my father and his daughter and his sister-in-law did go to this farm\nhouse and they found Avremy there without his shoes, a Polish farmer had taken them, probably\nhe needed them, probably he thought that Avremy would be killed soon anyway, what did he\nneed shoes for. Who knows why he took them, but he took them. This is April of \u201943, my\nfather, Avremy, Toby and Tova whatever, and his sister-in-law whose name I don\u2019t know and\nthen they were arrested, they were found. I mean it was very hard to really escape especially\nsince the Poles were so hostile and the Nazis were so eager to find them. And he was taken to\nAuschwitz. They were taken to Auschwitz. Of course my father was 35, and the rest of them\nwere not 35, they were twelve, eight, and I don\u2019t know how old his sister-in-law was,\npresumably in her thirties too but she was crippled. And she was as if the mother of these\nchildren. She was an adult female with two children. And so when they got to Auschwitz, he\nwas sent to the left or the right, whichever way. He was sent to do slave labor and they were\nsent the other way which means that they were gassed. So in April of 1943 his son and his\ndaughter and sister-in-law were killed by the Nazis. But he was in Auschwitz and he was a\nslave laborer in Auschwitz for a long time. He worked in Auschwitz and he would talk about\nhis experiences quite a lot. He talked about how awful it was although I must say that he did not\ndwell on how awful it was. My father talked about his experience in the camps a lot. Saturday\nnights when we would have company, in the 1950\u2019s if you were a Jewish family in Brooklyn\nyou would have bagels and lox for dinner, and we would have bagels and lox and herring and so\non and company and he would talk . People would say Mark what was it like. And he would\ntalk. And I just remember Saturday nights in my childhood hearing my father talk about this.\nAnd when he talked about it he did not talk about the horrors so much. He certainly made it\nvery clear that it was so horrific that you could not even imagine it. And in fact when people\nwould be nasty, nasty is the wrong word, but you know how Americans could be presumptuous\nand they would say, how could you have done such a thing? Like my father would say we\nfound a rat and we ate it or something. And they\u2019d say, ooh how could you eat a rat? It\u2019s not\nreally nasty. And he would say, you shouldn\u2019t talk, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be in a fire.\nI remember the expression, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be in a fire. But he wouldn\u2019t dwell\non how awful it was except to indicate that 1t was unbearably awful and constant beatings and\nstarvation and filth and dirt and crowded and disgusting. He indicated that but that\u2019s not what\nhe dwelled on. What he dwelled on instead in his talking about it was the things that people did\nto survive and the things that people did to help each other survive. The image that I had as a\nchild of what it was like in the camps was unbearable sadism and cruelty on the part of the\nNazis but the inmates being human, working to do things that would make themselves survive\nand things that human beings do. I don\u2019t mean that human beings are pigs and do horrible\nthings, but in the good sense of being human, that is if helping each other and working together\nto try to survive, and so forth. For example he always spoke about what the memoirs all talked\nabout, that is the whole business of organization, the whole network through which people\nbargained and traded and bartered and traded their bread for other things. He talked all the time\nof it how it was crucial to trade your bread for soap, or to trade your bread for an onion or for\ngarlic or something and soap so you could clean yourself. Onions or garlic so you could get\nvitamins. All of that which I\u2019ve read in umpteen memoirs but he talked about that all the time,\nabout the need to trade. Of course the whole network depended on pilfering from Nazi\nstewards and from the suitcases of people who came in to be gassed. So he talked about that a\nlot. He didn\u2019t use the word organization as far as I can remember but maybe he did and I just\ndon\u2019t remember. But he talked about that you really needed to do that. He also talked, in fact\nmore importantly than this whole organization business, he talked about holding on to the will\nto live. My most vivid memory I have from childhood, the most single vivid memory of my\nown childhood is my father talking about holding on to the will to live. And that the only way\nyou could survive such a horrible place was to hold on to the will to live and that\u2019s how you did\nit, you just held on to the will to live. Like literally held on to it. And every second said, I\u2019m\ngoing to live, I\u2019m going to live, I\u2019m going to live. I just remember that vividly. I don\u2019t\nremember what he said how you did it, how you held on to the will to live or what strategies he\nused to hold on to the will to live, which I read about in memoirs, thinking about the past,\nthinking about the future, thinking about this, whatever. There are different strategies that\npeople used. That I don\u2019t remember, his own personal strategies. But I do remember him\ntalking about that -- holding on to the will to live. I also remember that of course it made him\nlose all faith in God. Actually I don\u2019t remember that, I take that back. He did lose all faith in\nGod. But that he didn\u2019t tell me about. My mother told me about that when I was older. He\ndidn\u2019t want me to know that because he didn\u2019t think that was fair to me. He thought that I was\na child and not know that he didn\u2019t believe in God as a result of Auschwitz. And he didn\u2019t\nbelieve in God because his children had been killed and everybody\u2019s children had been killed\nnot just his. That didn\u2019t stop him from wanting to have a kosher home or from going to shul all\nthe time. He didn\u2019t stop being a Jew, you know what I mean? Well, actually he did stop going\nto shul until I was born. From the time the war ended until I was born he would not go into a\nshul, he would not do anything religious. He would not go into a Passover seder, he would not\ndo anything religious. No, that\u2019s not true. He would go to a Passover seder. I think that was\nthe only religious thing he would do but he would not go to shul. When I was born he didn\u2019t\neven think about it. He went to shul to name me. He was a Jew. That\u2019s what eastern Jewry was\nlike. You were a Jew. You did things because you were a Jew. Jews named their daughters in\nshul. The angel of death might kill your daughter if you didn\u2019t do that. You know you had to.\nJust because you didn\u2019t believe in God didn\u2019t mean that you didn\u2019t name your daughter in shul.\nAnd that broke the ice and he went to shul all the time. He loved to go to shul. He absolutely\nloved to go to shul. He didn\u2019t go every week, he wasn\u2019t religious. But he went at least once a\nmonth. He really loved to go to shul. In fact he even wanted me to go to a Jewish day school\nbut my mother didn\u2019t want me to go because we weren\u2019t that religious and in those days it was\njust orthodox schools. Getting back to his experiences I don\u2019t remember that he talked about\nhow he lost his faith in God but that was a central experience that he had in the camps, the loss\nof faith.",
        "Q: Do you remember any discussion of any specific episodes or incidents that he might have told\nyou or other people?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember anything specific from the camps except the business of trading bread for\nsoap which is not a specific incident; I\u2019m sure he did it more than once and the business of\nholding on to the will to live and the sense of how unbearable it was. I think in his testimony\nfor reparations he did provide some specific instances. But my mother, who unfortunately was\nterrible at details didn\u2019t remember them and had lost the carbon copy. I\u2019m sure he was beaten\nmercilessly many times as was everybody, I mean he wasn\u2019t singled out. I\u2019m sure there were\nbut I really don\u2019t unfortunately know any very specific thing. In terms of what he actually did\nin the camp, I assume he did a variety of labor things. He could be a carpenter so presumably\nwhen they asked him what do you do, he said I\u2019m a carpenter and they did have him building.\nMy mother used to say that he built crematoria. But they were already built by the time he got\nthere so I don\u2019t -- see my mother was really bad at detail. It was a shame. I\u2019m a historian\nconcerned with detail and she wasn\u2019t. And my father died when I was young. So I\u2019m bringing\nall these memories of sitting around our table listening so I can think of something very\nspecific.",
        "Q: If you don\u2019t have it that\u2019s okay too.",
        "A: I remember that he would be annoyed with people who presumed -- like if he would discuss --\nin the Warsaw ghetto for example he would say how it was wonderful when a horse would die\nand they would just eat the horse meat and people would say, horse, how could you eat horse,\nand he would say, lady, you haven\u2019t been through a fire, you don\u2019t know. People were in awe of\nmy father. He was a very intelligent man and they would sit there sort of enthralled with his\nstories. I don\u2019t remember a specific incident unless I keep on talking I'll come to something. I\ndon\u2019t remember anything specific. I do know that he was in Auschwitz from April of \u201943 until\nJanuary of \u201945 when the Russians -- so in terms of your dates through 1944 he was in\nAuschwitz. In January of 1945 as you know the Russians came very close to Auschwitz.\nKnowing that the Russians were going to be there any minute the Nazis evacuated the camp and\nin the famous death march that Elie Wiesel and millions of other -- Isabella Leitner -- millions\nof other people described -- marched off people to Germany. And my father was part of that\ndeath march. I remember him describing that a little bit in more detail than the camps. I\nremember him saying that it was very cold. It was January, it was winter, and they didn\u2019t have\nboots and they didn\u2019t have coats. Two thirds of the people died. And I remember him saying\nthat you couldn\u2019t fall asleep because if you let yourself fall asleep you would die. The snow\nwas deceptive. You think that it\u2019s warm when you\u2019re in it and so you could fall asleep. And\nthen of course you freeze to death because 1n fact it\u2019s not warm it\u2019s cold. So you should never\ngo to sleep in the snow. And I remember him saying that they would force each other to stay\nawake. In some of the memoirs I\u2019ve read about how they were put in barns, my father never\ntalked about that. He just talked about the snow and how people straggled, they would be shot\nof course and the Nazis would beat people up. The Nazis were very nervous of course at this\npoint. He was taken to Dachau. Other people went to other places. They were in Bergen-\nBelsen, Buchenwald. They were all taken to concentration camps in Germany. He personally\nwas taken to Dachau where he spent the next few months. I don\u2019t know how long it actually\ntook him to get from Auschwitz to Dachau. In some of the memoirs you read how that part of\nthe way they were on trains and trucks and so forth. My father never said that. He just said the\ndeath march. He called it the death march and he said they took us to Dachau. So he was in\nDachau for a few months and he was liberated by the Americans in April of 1945. And I have a\ncouple of little stories that I remember of the actual liberation. Not of the moment of liberation.\nNot of the moment of liberation although I have a wonderful story of somebody else of the\nactual moment but I won\u2019t put this in my father\u2019s record. It\u2019s one of those classic stories, the\nother story of how this other person got out of Dachau. The Nazis left the camp before the\nAmericans got there and he was wandering around the streets and was almost shot by some\nAmerican soldiers but he spoke Yiddish to them and one of them happened to be Jewish and so\nforth. That\u2019s not my father\u2019s story. Right after liberation he and Shia, this person who had been\nhis employee in Wolomin before the war and had been in Auschwitz with him and had been in\nthe orchestra in Auschwitz actually, my father was just a laborer in Auschwitz but Shia was in\nthe orchestra and they were in the death march together and so forth. And after the war they\nwere walking around and Shia picked up a rotten potato from the street that he saw and my\nfather said what are you doing that for because now we have food. And Shia was still too\nscared that there would be no food. But that again is not my father\u2019s story because that\u2019s not\nwhat he did. He of course was nothing at the end of the war. He was utterly emaciated and\nutterly depleted. My mother used to say he weighed fifty pounds at the end of the war. I can\u2019t\nbelieve that. But he must have weighed seventy or eighty. My mother was also an exaggerator\na little bit. But I bet he weighed seventy pounds at the end of the war. He was not a huge man\nanyway, he was probably about five nine. He was broad but thin.",
        "Q: He must have been strong to have survived all the labor and all.",
        "A: Yeah. He was actually old to survive. Most of the survivors were teenagers, which is why\nthey\u2019re still alive. My father if he were alive today would be in his eighties. I mean he\nhappened to die when he was young. He happened to die when he was fifty-three but even if he\nhadn\u2019t died and if he were still alive the man would be eighty-four years old. No, that\u2019s not\nright. Yes, he would be eighty-five on his next birthday. Whereas most of the survivors that\nyou talk to I\u2019m sure are in their seventies because they were teenagers or in their early twenties\nduring the war. My father was a very old survivor, very unusual, he must have been\nextraordinarily strong. It\u2019s funny to say that somebody in their mid-thirties would already be no\nlonger at the height of their physical strength but it\u2019s true. So it\u2019s just amazing that he lived.\nBut anyway he was liberated by the Americans. He did not go to a DP camp which was the\nstandard experience but rather he went to work for the United Nations Relief and Restitution\nAgency and his job for them was to help people find housing. He must have learned English\nworking for them or before but he lived in an apartment in Munich. He had a real apartment\nand had a real job and sort of went about his business. I assume for a few months, I mean I\nassume that immediately after the war he was, it took months to recuperate. In fact he said that\nit was months before he felt like a human being again. I do know that most of his teeth had\nrotted during the war and that one of the first things he did when he had some modicum of\nstrength was he just walked around the streets of Munich and looked for a dentist. He found a\ndentist, walked in, asked the dentist to pull whatever was left and to give him false teeth. The\ndentist wanted to give him anesthesia for the pulling and he said, no need. He was so into pain\nthat it didn\u2019t matter. And the German dentist didn\u2019t charge him because my father had a number,\nhe had been in Auschwitz. He just showed his number. In fact in those days you just showed\nyour number and you got anything. He didn\u2019t pay for too much after the war. The apartment I\nthink was also free.",
        "Q: I was wondering about that because I talked to a number of people and they said well we just\nlived there. And I said how did you get food. Well, we got food.",
        "A: Well, if they were in a DP camp they got food from the UN.",
        "Q: No, I mean in cities.",
        "A: But if they lived in cities -- well my father worked, I mean my father had a real job, but before\nthat he didn\u2019t have the job from the first minute, I think it was not a problem.",
        "Q: There was guilt.",
        "A: Yeah, although the Germans didn\u2019t have any food. They must have been given food by the\nAmerican army of occupation. He must have just been given it. I don\u2019t know that. I know\nsomebody who studies the DP camps, she might know. Anyway, so he wasn\u2019t ina DP camp. I\nassume he stayed in Dachau because that\u2019s what they did. They set up barracks and gave\npeople food and medicine and let them come to themselves. We have pictures of my father\nright after the war, not right, right after the war but in 46 where he looks fine. He had\nobviously regained his strength and so forth. But so he lived and worked for UNRRA and he\ndid have housing and he had a German, non-Jewish girlfriend who he lived with which 1s very\nweird. And she knew Yiddish which 1s very weird.",
        "Q: I heard of some southern Germans who know Yiddish actually.",
        "A: Well, yeah, she was a Bavarian. She was a beautiful woman. Her name was Lisa, well probably\nElizabeth, but Lisa was her nickname. Just a beautiful woman. Her husband had been a soldier\nprobably and he probably had been killed and she was probably lonely and my father had access\nto food and people were starving. She wanted to marry him actually and he couldn\u2019t do that.\nTo live with her is one thing, to sleep with a shiksa is one thing; to marry a shiksa after you just\n..... Lremember him saying he used to have dreams. His mother would come and beat him up\nin his dreams. The very idea that he would even think of marrying a shiksa was -- a German\nshiksa no else. Well, I mean from my grandmother\u2019s point of view a shiksa 1s a shiksa, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter what kind. But the fact that she was also a German shiksa didn\u2019t really help. Ill\nshow you her picture. She was gorgeous, just beautiful. I have this huge urge to look her up\nalthough she\u2019s probably eighty-five years old, too. I mean at the end of the war how old was\nmy father? In 1947 he was forty right. And she may have been ten years younger so she would\nonly be in her mid-seventies at this time. I don\u2019t know her name.",
        "Q: I think it would be interesting to learn something about her.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know her name. Her name is Lisa. I don\u2019t know her last name. Although actually some\nof my father\u2019s Lukower friends, that is the friends from the town that he met again in America,\nthey might know her name because she lived with him. All these pictures of my father and his\nother survivor friends in Germany after the war. There she is, she\u2019s with them. My father did\nknow German though, he probably did speak to her in German. Anyway, so he lived in\nGermany and had this job, joined the Zionist organization and stuff and then in December of\n1947 he came to the United States. That was right after Congress passed that emergency\nlegislation allowing in 100,000 victims of Nazi persecution. I guess because he worked for\nUNRRA he was able more easily than others to get an early seat in that. And he came to the\nUnited States in December of 1947 leaving Lisa behind in Munich. I don\u2019t think he ever had\nany contact with her again. Maybe initially he did but not for very long. He got himself a job\nvery quickly. It was the only job he ever had in America. He actually lived with a Lukower.\nHe lived with Mrs. Feldman who had moved to America God knows when. But her son, Muttel,\nwho was my father\u2019s friend in Europe and had survived the war also, and was my father\u2019s friend\nin Germany, he lived with his mother, Mrs. Feldman. Muttel came later to America, too. But\nhe lived with Mrs. Feldman. He wandered around lower Manhattan looking for a job, he got a\njob right away for a company called Civikoppen Minor which did store fixtures, you know\nfurniture that\u2019s inside stores. And he worked both as a carpenter -- he knew how to work with\nwood, he owned a lumberyard, and he was also very handy, actually more than handy. He was\ntalented with his hands. He could build beautiful things and so on. So he got a job there,\ninitially I guess just as a carpenter since he didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know, whatever -- but he also\nworked for them supervising job installations. When they did Bambergers in New Jersey, he\nwent out to Bambergers and made sure the job was done right. And what he wanted more than\nanything was to save up enough money to open some kind of business. He was an\nentrepreneur by nature and that\u2019s what he wanted to do. He died before he could do that. But\nthat\u2019s what he wanted to do. So he got a job right away, I mean he probably got a job three days\n-- oh actually I have a funny story to tell. I know you\u2019re mostly interested in the Holocaust but\nI love this story. When he came to America he was met at the boat by his aunt, Judith Marcus,\nMarcusfeld shortened to Marcus. Actually she was an aunt-in-law. She was his mother\u2019s\nbrother\u2019s wife. His mother\u2019s brother had died. They had come to America probably before\nWorld War I and had shortened the name to Marcus to make it more American. Anyway his\nuncle was dead but Judith Marcus met him at the boat and she said to him, today I'll speak to\nyou in Yiddish, tomorrow only English. You\u2019re now in America, you have to speak English.\nPresumably he knew some English because he worked for UNRRA. Today I will call you\nMendel, but from now on you have to have an American name and your name 1s Mark. She\ngave him a name that was common in America. In 1947 Mark was acommon name. So in fact,\nwhen he became a citizen in 1951 he changed his name to Mark. So in America he was Mark\nRozenblit, although my mother called him alternate.....she called him Mark most of the time,\nbut she called him Mendel when she was being affectionate because that was his name. Mendel\nwas his name. He was forty-four years old when he changed his name to Mark. Although he\nused it, 1t was his American name. My cousins called him uncle Mark and my uncle called him -\n- I mean everybody called him Mark. Anyway he came to America, was met by his aunt, he got\na job, and he met my mother a year and a half later in June of 1949 and they got married in\nNovember of 1949 and they had me in October of 1950. The rest is history. He adjusted\nextremely well to America. He loved America. He felt utterly happy to be American. He had\nan American wife which is unusual for survivors. He didn\u2019t feel the need to be -----of course he\nwas friends with all the people who survived from his town. My mother hated them. They\nwere a bunch of people who survived from this town. Actually a very large number considering\nhow tiny the town was. Virtually all of them had been in the Partisans, except for Muttel. I\nthink Muttel had been in the camps. Everybody else, I forget all their names now, Frimmet.\nGod, Frimmet, Frimmet and Dave Rosen. They\u2019re so unlikely to have been in the Partisans, it\u2019s\namazing. And Chayetta whose son looked like somebody else, not her husband. There\u2019s this\nsort of crew of people that I grew up with. Those people, I haven\u2019t seen them in a hundred\nyears.",
        "Q: But they all ended up in New York?",
        "A: They all ended up in New York, all the survivors. There were probably eight of them; it\u2019s not\nlike there were hundreds of them. But there were some of them. Some of them actually\nsubsequently moved to Israel. In the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s they lived in America and 70\u2019s and some of\nthem retired to Israel. Well Frimmet and her husband and the Feldmans, Muttel and Fanny\nmoved to Israel. But I think Lola and her husband, I forget his name, they still live in America,\nin New York. I mean, unless they\u2019re dead, I haven\u2019t spoken to these people in a hundred years,\na hundred years, but a long time. So my father adjusted very, very well to life in America. He\nreally did. He didn\u2019t want to have children because he lost two. He had one because he thought\nit wasn\u2019t fair to my mother to impose that on her but he wouldn\u2019t have any others because it was\ntoo much of a risk that you could lose your children. In a way I replaced his daughter; his son\nhe mourned for continuously. He had nightmares all the time, all the time my mother said. I\ndon\u2019t remember that. That was from my mother. He was in his daily life in America, fine. He\njoked and laughed and was successful. I mean not successful in the huge sense but he had a job\nand worked and made a living and he was saving money for a business and he had an American\nfamily. I remember my father being loving and warm and it was fine in his waking\nconsciousness but of course he was racked by nightmares. He missed his son profoundly. He\nwas in excruciating pain at a barmitzvah. He had a very hard time at barmitzvahs because his\nson died just before his own. The loss of his children was really unbearable to him. The loss of\neveryone else he could handle but the loss of his children was unbearable to him.",
        "Q: That must have been a big responsibility for you really to have that position.",
        "A: I felt it an honor. I felt very privileged. I felt very special as a child. I felt that I was privy,\nvery close to tis horrible thing that had happened to the Jewish people and therefore that I\nunderstood it better than others. I felt honored. I felt terrible for my father and the family and\nso forth. But I felt very special. I felt responsible, yes, but not in the negative sense of wishing\nthat I didn\u2019t have a burden but in the positive sense of feeling that I had a special responsibility\nto bear the information and the pain of it. I knew lots of other people in the same situation\nthough because although my mother was American and therefore all the family that I had was\nAmerican, that is her family, we knew a lot of survivors. Both because of the Lukower, all of\nthese people who had survived, but also because in Brooklyn in the fifties when I was growing\nup there were survivors. There were lots of survivors. I had friends whose parents were\nsurvivors. Not all my friends, certainly. In fact probably most of my friends didn\u2019t have\nsurvivor parents but Elaine and Esther Rosenberg\u2019s parents were survivors and whatever, I don\u2019t\nhave to name all the names. But there were plenty of other survivors around so it was not an\nunusual or weird thing at all. But yes I did feel a responsibility, a very great responsibility,\nprobably magnified by the fact that he died when I was ten years old. I remember, my father\nalways talked about it, I do not remember a time in my life when I did not know about the\nHolocaust. We didn\u2019t call it the Holocaust, of course, we called it the war, or the camps, or the\nNazis, whatever. So I don\u2019t remember not knowing about it. I always knew about it. But\nI do remember the first time I saw pictures. There was a series of pictures prepared by the\nAmerican army for Germans so they would know how horrible the camps were. And my father\nhad a set. In the back it said \u201cZo vais in Dachau\u201d So it was in Dachau. It was horrific pictures.\nYou know those really gross concentration camp pictures from the end of the war when things\nwere even worse, because there were bodies lying all over the place and so forth. And I\nremember I was eleven years old when I came across those pictures and I vomited. I remember\nthat very vividly. I mean this wasn\u2019t a picture of my father, of course, my father was alive. Not\nthen, he was already dead. Yeah, I felt this great responsibility because of it, absolutely.\nAnyway what else would you like to know about the whole thing.",
        "Q: I think that should probably cover it.",
        "A: As much as you guys need, right.",
        "Q: Yeah. If there\u2019s anything else that you feel you want to include for the sake of this interview\nand have it in the museum we can turn off the tape and if you think about it, you can tell me.",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2019m just trying to think. You know of course I\u2019m not the survivor so I can\u2019t give you the\ndetails that your survivors are giving you. My father also did die when I was ten which means\nthat I didn\u2019t get a chance to question him and whatever. My cousin in Israel could only provide\ninformation about Poland before the war. My mother was bad at detail. So it\u2019s a hard thing.\nLet me just think of a few other things randomly. My father taught me not to hate all Germans\nbecause of the Nazis. He thought the Nazis were evil but he didn\u2019t hate all Germans. I mean I\nthink the fact that he had a non-Jewish girlfriend is a sign of that. He taught me that. He taught\nme that I had to distinguish between people. Nazis were evil but not all Germans were evil. I\nprobably did get the sense that all Poles were anti-Semitic in my childhood. That is, I think\nPolish Jewry in general thought that although no, no although. That was the sense I probably\ngot. I got the sense that obviously most people were killed but that those who survived did so\nnot because they were awful people. I mean there was this notion in certain circles especially in\nthe fifties that the people who survived had been vicious and horrible and mean and had killed\neach other and been dog eat dog. From my father I learned that you survived because you were\nclever. You held on to the will to live so you were strong psychologically. You were clever.\nYou figured things out. You were lucky, gutsy. That\u2019s what made you live, not being\nunderhanded and mean but being tough and strong. In fact I had a wonderful experience. I\nwent to the first international gathering of Holocaust survivors in Israel in 1981 and I in fact\ngave a paper on it. I gave a paper on teaching the Holocaust at the university level. But I went\nto not all the sessions but many of the sessions. I went to the final session which was held at the\nkotel, at the wall, when there were speeches. Menachem Begin spoke and Teddy Kollack\nspoke, everybody spoke, millions of speakers, all in English, really weird. But anyway English\nwas the common language because there were French survivors and whatever. Anyway so I\nwent to it and it got real cold. It was at night in Jerusalem in the summer and I was wearing a\njacket and I was feeling very cold. Begin, maybe he wasn\u2019t the last speaker, but he was one of\nthe last speakers and he was going on and on endlessly. Everybody else had spoken for two\nminutes because thee were hundreds of speakers. He was going on. He was already prime\nminister. He was going on and on and he was really being nasty. He was exhorting the crowd\nthat if they didn\u2019t live in Israel they were traitors to the Jewish people. It was a really not nice,\ndisgusting speech. Half the crowd started to leave. They just started to leave. They picked\nthemselves up and they walked. My American side, that is my Protestant side, I mean I\u2019m not a\nProtestant but you know what I mean, the American side that you just stand on line whatever,\nwas appalled that they would do that. Because, after all, even if you hate him, even if you think\nhe\u2019s saying awful things, and I certainly don\u2019t agree with Menachem Begin politically and I\nthough what he was saying was awful. But still he\u2019s the prime minister of a country. You don\u2019t\nget up and leave in the middle of his speech. It\u2019s just not nice even if you\u2019re cold and even if\nyou\u2019re unhappy you don\u2019t do it. And so I was really annoyed. My sort of American side that\nhates when people cheat on line was getting very angry. And then all of a sudden like I had this\nrevelation, wait a second, that\u2019s why they survived. They just do what seems to them the right\nthing to do. And then I loved them because I remembered all these survivors from my\nchildhood. My father\u2019s dead for a long time and I\u2019ve moved away from that world and I just\nloved them and I wanted to kiss all of them. I didn\u2019t leave because I\u2019m not them. But they left\nbecause that\u2019s why they not only survived but they also succeeded after the war in returning to\nnormal life. The vast majority of the survivors are normal, functioning human beings. Even if\nthey\u2019re a bit neurotic, even if they scream a little too much, even if they have more fears than\nyour average person, even if they are way more over-protective of their children, than your\naverage person, even all of those things and even if their children say oh my parents were such\ncrazy people, they are functioning human beings, they are not lunatics. And the ones who are\nwere lunatics anyway. The ones who are were lunatics before the war. This had a searing and\ntraumatic and devastating effect on them but they function as human beings, successful ones for\nthe most part. There are lots of successful business people, successful professionals. All the\nsurvivors I know as children all of them made it. Even if they were just laborers, they still went\nto work in the morning and they still provided for their families. They were fine, they were\nreally fine; crazy but crazy in a way that\u2019s understandable. But anyway so I love them all\nbecause they are what they are. They survived because they have the courage to do what feels\nright at the moment instinctively. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything else I can say at all. This is\nnot about my father\u2019s American experience and that\u2019s of course what I\u2019m most familiar with.\nHe had a good one. He spoke English all the time to my mother. They spoke Yiddish when\nthey didn\u2019t want me to understand which was enough so that I did understand Yiddish. He was\nfiercely proud of being Jewish even if he wouldn\u2019t fast on Yom Kippur because he didn\u2019t\nbelieve in God anymore and he\u2019d gone hungry long enough. But I didn\u2019t know he didn\u2019t fast on\nYom Kippur. He didn\u2019t want me to know that because ......1 mean I\u2019m sure he would have told\nme if I was older, but I was little.

        "Q: Yes they will.",
        "A: So Pll just say it. My son is named for my father. I\u2019m named for my father\u2019s mother and he\u2019s\nnamed for my father. And so therefore we have Masha and a Mark and a Marsha and a Mark\nand it\u2019s very nice. And he really feels connected to my father and to the Holocaust. He has\nalways known about it and you asked me if I feel a sense of responsibility and I do. I feel it\nboth in my professional life and in my personal life. And I\u2019m very pleased that I was able to tell\nmy son about the Holocaust in a way like I learned about it, in a very personal way, in a way\nthat emphasizes the goodness in all human beings but it also emphasizes that we should be\ncareful about the evil that human beings are capable of and I feel that as a child of a Holocaust\nsurvivor that I have a moral obligation to purvey the meaning of the Holocaust to the next\ngeneration and I\u2019m glad I was able to do it with my own son. A lot of children of Holocaust\nsurvivors are worried how they will do it and I think it can be done easily, so thank you for\ninterviewing me.",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: I have one more thing to add, I just remembered. When the Nazis occupied Poland in 1939, my\nfather\u2019s wife said to him, escape to the Russian zone, you can do that for a couple of months in\nSeptember, October, November of 1939; you go escape. After all the Germans won\u2019t hurt\nwomen and children but they might hurt men. And my father said well it\u2019s true the Germans\ncertainly won\u2019t hurt women and children because after all his memories, like most Polish Jews.\nHis memories of World War I were that the Russians were the horrible creeps but when the\nGerman army came and occupied Poland the situation of the Jews improved. The Germans\nwere civilized and nice and so forth. So he had a sense that the Germans wouldn\u2019t be so bad\nbut he didn\u2019t want to go to the east because he thought that the Russians would be very barbaric\nand he didn\u2019t want to go to the east. He said the Germans are more civilized than the Russians.\nI will take my chances with the Germans and I don\u2019t want to leave my family alone and so\nforth. So the image of the German was this positive one which of course worked to the\ndetriment of lots of Polish Jews. That\u2019s all I wanted to add...",
        "Q: Thanks.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome. My father understood that Hitler was a maniac and that the Nazis were evil\nand that they were doing terrible things to the Jews. He understood that. He just thought that\nultimately German decency would prevail whereas the Russians were utterly repulsive and that\nit was at best to stay at home with family and take one\u2019s chances with these Germans than go\noff to Russia.",

        "A: Okay, my father whose name was Mendel Rozenblit was born on November 13, 1907 in a town\ncalled Lukow in Poland. Anyway this town was in the area of Lublin, I don\u2019t know exactly in\nwhich direction or ...... Okay, so my father was born in Lukow which was near Lublin in 1907.\nHe was born into a pretty religious family. I think that parts of the family were associated with\nthe Hasidim. But he did not grow up technically as a Hasidic child. He was just an ordinary\ntraditionally religious Polish Jewish boy. His father died when he was very young, well not\nvery young I guess. Well let me go backwards a little bit. My father was one of about six or\nseven children and he was in the middle. He was not the oldest or the youngest; he was one of\nthe middle children. His father died when he was a young boy. I think, if my memory serves\nme correctly, he was about twelve when his father died, which means his father died just after\nWorld War I of asthma. But I think he was sickly for most of his life. But my grandmother,\nthat is my father\u2019s mother whose name was --well I should say that my father\u2019s father\u2019s name\nwas Avraham Rozenblit -- and his mother Masha Markusfeld Rozenblit, after whom I\u2019m named\nMarsha -- Masha, his mother managed quite well to have six children and run the family. She\nowned a, well my mother used to say she owned a general store, but my cousin in Israel who\nwas seventeen when he left Poland and really knew her, said that she basically owned a shoe\nstore. That is, she sold other things too, but it was mostly shoes and what she would do is, she\nwould take trips to Warsaw or Lublin and see what was in the fancy shoe stores there and then\ncopy them and arranged to have the shoes made. She didn\u2019t make them herself. She wasn\u2019t a\nshoemaker but she would get them made and then sell them, both in the store and also in a kind\nof...She would send her children out to sell them also, when they were grown, to sell them to\nthe peasants in the villages. That I learned from my cousin in Israel. But let me just try to say\nsomething about my father\u2019s family background in general before I talk more specifically. They\nwere a very religious family and pictures of my father show him wearing the sort of traditional\ncap of the Polish Jews, you know that sort of squarish cap. I can\u2019t tell from the pictures\nwhether he has pais or not. It\u2019s hard to tell, but maybe he did. I should say before I go on that\nmy father died, Mendel Rozenblit, the survivor that we\u2019re talking about, died in 1961 when I\nwas ten years old so that most of my recollections come from either things I actually remember\nhim saying, or things that my mother told me that he had said, or things that my cousin in Israel,\nthat is his nephew, Mordecai Rozenblit, who came to Palestine in 1938 has told me. So it\u2019s a\nsort of conglomerate of those things. So, in any case it was a traditional religious family in the\nLublin area. His mother owned this shoe store. I don\u2019t think she was rich but she was\nreasonably prosperous and my father had all of these brothers and sisters. His oldest, I don\u2019t\neven know the age order, I think Nehama the sister, he had one sister and five brothers I believe,\nand the sister, Nehama, was I think the oldest and then there were other brothers. There was\nSimcha, there was Haim Yakov, there was Meir who was the baby, there was Yehoshua and I\nknow how most of them died actually and I\u2019ll get back to that later when we talk about it. But\nHaim Yakov was a very ardent Zionist and he left Poland before the war. He went to Palestine\nin 1937 and then his son Mordecai joined him in 1938.",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t know. My cousin, Mutti, Mordecai, in Israel has many times told me that\nyou know, he had said to me, [Marsha, at yahdat ha abba shelach lo haya Zioni] which means\nMarsha, your father wasn\u2019t a Zionist. But I think that\u2019s not true. I think that Mutti means by\nthat, that my father didn\u2019t move to Palestine after the war. And Mutti 1s still mad at him forty\nyears later for not having done that. I do have his Zionist membership card from after the war.\nBut, of course, everybody was a Zionist after the war. So the question is was he an active\nZionist before the war. Judging from the schools he sent his children to I don\u2019t think so. That is\nan active Zionist. I don\u2019t think he was active in the Zionist movement, no. But he was\nprobably sympathetic to Zionism.",
        "A: Well, all towns are shtetls, shtetl just means little town.",
        "A: It was a small town. I don\u2019t know how big it was. It certainly wasn\u2019t a large place. Lublin was\nin central Poland so it was central Poland. I think my image of it as a child was that it was like\nany small American town with white picket fences and neat little houses on neat little streets.\nAnd I was shocked in 1972 or \u201903, I was talking to Lucin Dovarshitsky who teaches Polish-\nAmerican history at YIBO and who is a member of whatever the staff at the YIBO Institute and\nLucin Dovarshitsky at the time was busy collecting lots and lots and lots of pictures for the\nImage Before My Eyes volume and I said my father was from Lukow and he said well I\u2019ve got\na picture of Lukow, come and see it. So I went upstairs to his office and I looked at this picture\nof Lukow and it was not my image. I mean it was a muddy little street. This was a picture\ntaken in 1926 and it was this dreary little muddy town. So it was a tiny little nothing of a town,\nI think. Although my cousin Mutti in Israel who was seventeen when he left Lukow has nice\nmemories of it so 1t couldn\u2019t have been that horrendous. I mean maybe this picture doesn\u2019t do it\njustice. He has nice memories. My father left Lukow when he married and lived near Warsaw.\nIll get to that in a minute. So his adult life was not in Lukow, it was in a Warsaw suburb. The\nstories of his childhood that he told me when I was little were certainly not negative. If his\nfamily was prosperous, even if they weren\u2019t rich they wouldn\u2019t have suffered much.",
        "A: He went to cheder. He was born in 1907. He was born when that part of Poland was part of the\nRussian Empire. I know he just went to traditional cheder. He did not have a formal secular\neducation as far as I know. I do know that he could read Polish easily and that means that he\nmust have had some secular education. All the schooling he ever spoke of was cheder. On the\nother hand since he could read Polish novels he must have also gone to something else. He\ndidn\u2019t have a gymnasium education, that I know. He didn\u2019t go to university. But he must have\ngone to some Polish school as well as cheder because you can\u2019t read Polish easily if you hadn\u2019t.\nSpeaking it is one thing but knowing it 1s another. So I think that he and virtually all his\nsiblings just went to cheder and maybe also some kind of Polish elementary school. There is\none thing that 1s important and that is his younger brother, Meir, wanted very much to have a\nreal secular education and he did go to Polish school and gymnasium in their town, or maybe\nnot in their town, it\u2019s hard to say since I was only ten when my father died, he may have just\nsaid gymnasium and maybe Meir went off to Lublin to go to gymnasium, I don\u2019t know. In any\ncase my grandmother who was a religious woman, who wore a sheitel and so forth, nevertheless\nwas willing to let her youngest son go to gymnasium. This must have been already, since Meir\nis younger than my father, this must have been after World War 1. It must have been in the\ntwenties. And the town was very mad at her for doing this. So she was something of a\nprogressive because she was, although very religious, was willing to let her son go to\ngymnasium, and of course going to gymnasium meant going to school on Saturday. And\ntheoretically Jews were exempt from writing. And in fact, they were. But obviously it spoke of\nabandoning traditional Jewish life and entering the larger world. She was certainly willing to do\nthis and was willing to defy the town to let this happen. I remember my father telling a story\nabout how there was a library in town, like a secular library. Now maybe it was a Zionist\nlibrary, may it was Pol.....[ don\u2019t know what and a lit of the \u201cfrumies\u2019\u2019, a lot of the very\nreligious people in town marched against it and they tried to burn it down. And my\ngrandmother, who was herself religious and not secular, nevertheless sort of defied them and\ninsisted that her son Meir go to gymnasium. Actually Meir had a very different experience\nfrom all the rest of them. Meir not only went to Polish gymnasium but after he graduated from\ngymnasium, and this must have been into the \u201830\u2019s at some point, he went to university to study\nto be a doctor. He didn\u2019t go in Poland because it was very difficult for Jews to do that in\nPoland. He went first in Italy and then in Paris. He was presumably deported from Paris to\nAuschwitz because he was dead too. So his experience was different from everybody else\u2019s.\nOne brother went to Palestine where he died a natural death in 1943 of a heart attack. Haim\nYakov is the one who went to Palestine and Meir was in France.",
        "A: I have pictures of Meir as a baby. No, actually as an adult, too. Come to think of it, yes, there\nis a picture of Meir as an adult, two pictures of Meir as adults. One from Italy and one I\u2019m not\nsure where from. He went to Pisa and studied medicine and then he was in Paris. I think he\nmarried in Paris but I don\u2019t think he had children. And I don\u2019t know what happened to his wife.\nI don\u2019t know if she was deported or not deported. My father never tried to look her up after the\nwar. And my mother, after my father\u2019s death, was suspicious that perhaps Meir\u2019s wife wasn\u2019t\nJewish and that\u2019s why my father hadn\u2019t bothered to look her up after the war because he was in\nMunich for two and a half years after the war, he could have. And he knew his brother was in\nParis. And he found out that his brother had been deported so he could have presumably\ninvestigated his brother\u2019s wife but he didn\u2019t. That may mean that the family was angry that he\nhad married a non-Jewish woman or something like that. Anyway Meir\u2019s experience as an\neducated Jew, as an educated person and the fact that Haim Yakov was a devout Zionist, I think\nindicates that this family, while very religious, clearly had its arms out to the modern world,\neither through Jewish nationalism or through secular education. And it\u2019s also true that my\nfather, although raised as a very religious little boy, as an adult was not religious. As an adult in\nPoland, I don\u2019t mean in America after the war, that\u2019s something else. But as an adult in Poland\nwas not as religious as he had been growing up. He had a kosher home, he sent his kids to\nJewish schools, he was very Jewish, but that was normal in Poland. People did that. But he\nwas not that observant a Jew as an adult in the thirties as he had been growing up although his\nmother remained religious. And I assume some of his siblings were and some weren\u2019t. I really\ndon\u2019t know. That would be a nice question to ask. My cousin in Israel would know all these\nanswers because he was seventeen when he left and he would have a better sense of who was\nreligious and who was not. Anyway what else can I say about just his family background. His\nmother had this store. I think several of his brothers were involved in running the store or in, as\nI said, selling to the peasants. But some of the brothers moved. He himself moved to Warsaw.\nI think another brother, Simcha moved to Warsaw. I\u2019m not sure where his sister Nehama lived\nwhen she grew up. I mean they were all adults by the \u00b0\u201830\u2019s and they were all married and had\nchildren and so forth. The only thing I could say I suppose my grandmother, Masha Markusfeld\nRozenblit, I mean \u2018Markusfeld\u201d is very important. She was a Markusfeld. Rozenblit was\nsomething that accrued to her but she was a Markusfeld. She must have been a very feisty lady,\nshe sounds like it. She ran this store, she had her six kids \u2018which she raised by herself, or at\nleast partly. We have a picture of her. She looks like a Jewish woman from Poland but she was\nkind of a neat lady, I think.",
        "A: No, but she was in her sixties when she was killed. So that would make her born in the 1880\u2019s.\nRight and if my father was born in 1907 that\u2019s about right. So she would have been born in the\n1880\u2019s or 1870\u2019s, probably in the 1870\u2019s if he was born in 1907 and he was not her first child,\nhe was her third or fourth child. And I think my father\u2019s father, Avraham Rozenblit, he was\nprobably in his forties when he died, in around 1919 say so that means he was born also in the\n1870\u2019s. My father, by the way, even though he did not have formal higher education or even\nsecondary education, knew a lot of languages like many Jews of that part of the world. Yiddish\nwas of course his native language like it was for virtually all the Jews of Poland except a small\ngroup of hyper-assimilated Jews. But he was fluent in Polish and that was common for his\ngeneration, that is people who came of age in the twenties and thirties knew increasingly also,\nunless they were just Hasidim, increasingly really knew Polish. And certainly my cousin Mutti,\nthe one who moved to Palestine in 1937, \u201938, Mutti went to Polish public school in the thirties\nand has very fond memories of his teachers in the Polish elementary school in Lukow, that they\nwere not anti-Semitic. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s telling the whole truth when he says that, it may be\nnostalgia. I mean he has unkind words about Poles in general but his teachers were very loving\nand very nice and he has very fond memories of going to elementary school in Polish although\nhow deep his Polish language knowledge is, is hard to say, because at this point in the 1990\u2019s\nafter living in Israel for fifty odd years he really can speak only Hebrew and Yiddish and\nEnglish which he learned tn the British army during World War II but his Polish, I think, is so\nrusty that he didn\u2019t use it. But anyway my father knew Yiddish of course which was his mother\ntongue, Polish which he spoke totally fluently. He knew Hebrew. Now that\u2019s unusual. That\nwould indicate also a Zionist whatever. I don\u2019t know. My mother says he knew Hebrew. Now\nwhat does that mean. She says, she insisted that he spoke modern Israeli Hebrew, that he could\neasily speak Hebrew to an Israeli. I don\u2019t remember that although we did have an Israeli\nneighbor in the fifties and my mother says he spoke to her in Hebrew. Now maybe he said three\nwords and my mother thought that meant he...... Certainly he had a traditional cheder\neducation and he was well versed. He wasn\u2019t a Talmudist but he knew Hebrew in the way a\ntraditionally educated Jew knew Hebrew. It wasn\u2019t rote. He could look at the prayer book or at\na bible and understand what it said. He knew Russian. I don\u2019t know if he could read or write\nRussian but he certainly could speak Russian and he knew German. So he knew his languages.\nOkay what else can I say about just childhood. My father was clearly a very mischievous little\nboy because there are several stories that I remember of him directly telling me for example\nabout how they tormented the Malamed at cheder, how they tormented the teacher at the\ntraditional Jewish school in the cheder. In fact I remember when I was in Hebrew school as a\nchild he would say to me, Marsha you must never do the things to your teacher that we did, that\nI did to our teachers. And he did all the things you read about in all the Haskala, I mean putting\ntacks on the chair and putting honey on the chair and they just bedeviled the life of the poor\nteacher, which was standard, standard childhood high-jinx. And the other thing 1s that his sister\nNehama who was older than he, probably three or four years older even though she was three\nchildren older, his sister Nehama wanted a date. World War I was a kind of liberating\nexperience, not the war itself, that was just a horrible experience. In the aftermath of the war\nthings really opened up and social life really changed. And she wanted to go out on dates but\nher mother didn\u2019t want her to because her mother was still very traditional. And so my father\nand another one of his brothers would conspire with her to sneak her out of the house. And they\ndid this through some kind of closet, some armoire, in Europe they have these closets and\napparently they would move it against the window and open the window and open the back of\nthe closet. I don\u2019t remember the exact details but I have vivid memories of riding in our family\ncar in the 1950\u2019s with my father telling me stories about how they would trick his mother so that\nNehama could go out on a date with probably the man she ended up marrying. But, you know,\nnothing serious. She didn\u2019t cover her hair, actually. Pictures we have of her or that I\u2019ve seen of\nher as an adult, she didn\u2019t cover her hair. So clearly this was a very mischievous child. He\nalways had a twinkle in his eyes as an adult, too, so he clearly was the kind.....and survivors, of\ncourse, were often the kind of people who were mischievous sorts. Okay, I think I don\u2019t know\nvery much more about my father\u2019s real childhood, that is when he was a baby. If I think of\nanything I'll come back to it. My father got married pretty young. He got married when he was\nabout twenty or twenty-one to a cousin of his whom he loved very deeply. So this was also\nnon-traditional in a way, that is it was a love marriage, not an arranged one.",
        "A: You know I think it was a first cousin. I think it was his first cousin. I\u2019m not a hundred per cent\npositive that she was his first cousin but she was definitely his cousin. Her father owned a\nlumber yard in the Warsaw area in a town called Wolomin, which I think is spelled\nW OL OMIN,Imnota hundred per cent sure but I think so. It\u2019s in the Warsaw area. So\nhe moved to Warsaw, or to Wolomin, and he ran his father-in-law\u2019s business or worked with his\nfather-in-law in running the business. His wife though, whose name was either Mira or Perella\nI don\u2019t remember which, his wife though died about a week after their first child was born\nbecause she had a rheumatic heart and she was warned by doctors not to have any children and\nshe then didn\u2019t listen. She wanted a child, it wasn\u2019t accidental. They weren\u2019t that religious and\nshe died very shortly after he was born.",
        "A: She was probably twenty, twenty-one. I think my father was twenty-one and she was probably\nthe same age or a year younger. She was very young. Their son\u2019s name was Avraham. He was\nnamed after my father\u2019s father. Avraham was born therefore, let\u2019s see in 1943 when he was\nkilled, he was twelve. So he was born in 1931. So my father wasn\u2019t twenty-one, he was\ntwenty-four. Well, whatever. These stories have gotten passed from my mother who was not\nespecially good at dates but I think Avraham was born either in 1930 or 1931. And his wife\ndied and he was very, very miserable, naturally. And the family talked him into marrying her\nsister whose name was either Mira or Perella. In other words, Mira and Perella were his wives.\nI just don\u2019t remember which was the first and which was the second. I think Perella was the\nsecond. I think Mira was the first. Again I\u2019m really not a hundred percent sure. Again my\ncousin in Israel would know the answer. And they had another child.",
        "A: No, I think they talked him into it in the sense that this is the smartest and best thing to do. The\nchild needs a mother, what better mother than her sister. She needs a husband, she\u2019s a nice lady,\nwhy don\u2019t you just marry her. You know I think it was that kind of thing. And he was very\ndepressed and he needed a mother for his child and maybe she was already taking care of the\nkid. I don\u2019t know exactly but he definitely married her. And it was all right. Obviously it was\nsad. I didn\u2019t know this when I was a child. When I was a child my father was very open and\ntalked a huge amount about his Holocaust experience and about his life before the war. But for\nwhatever reason, maybe because it was ordinary tragedy rather than the special Jewish tragedy\nof the Holocaust, he didn\u2019t tell me about the fact that his first wife had died. He thought that\nwould be too sad for me. Here he was telling me about his son and daughter who had been\nslaughtered by the Nazis. And that he could tell me about. But the specific tragedy of his own\npersonal life with his wife\u2019s death he didn\u2019t tell me. I found out when I was twenty or\nsomething. A cousin of his in America was visiting us and she just mentioned it casually. I\nsaid, what are you talking about? And she told me the whole story and I just bawled. It was\nvery sad that this love of his life died in childbirth. But anyway he did have a daughter with the\nsecond wife. Her name was Toby. That\u2019s what my mother called her. It\u2019s probably Tova,\nwhich again sounds both modern and Hebraic, Gittel is the Yiddish. Tova is already a sign of\nmodernity in its modern Jewish form. She was four years younger than Avraham. So she\nwould have been born in 1934 or \u201935, something like that, or \u00b033 depending on exactly when\nAvraham was born. And my father continued to live in Wolomin with his wife and running this\nlumberyard. He sent his kids to -- there were several Jewish school systems in Poland as you\nknow. There was the Zionist school system and the Bundist school system and the \u201cfrumie\u2019\u2019,\nthe religious school system and so forth. He sent his children to a school system that was very\nlike American Jewish Day schools, that is Jewish subjects which were taught in Hebrew and\nsecular subjects were taught in Polish which was not the case in the Zionist or Bundist schools\nwhere everything was taught either in Hebrew or Yiddish with only a minimal amount of\nPolish. So his children went to this kind of modern Jewish school which means, of course, that\nit was a little bit more religious than both the Zionist or the Bundist schools which would\nindicate a kind of moderate religious position. So that\u2019s the kind of school he sent his kids to.\nAs I said he kept a kosher home. I don\u2019t think he was Sabbath observing. So he was kind of a\nlittle traditional, but not....",
        "A: You know I don\u2019t know what language. Certainly growing up he spoke Yiddish at home, that\ngoes without saying. What language did he speak as an adult in his family in Wolomin? I don\u2019t\nknow. I really don\u2019t know if he spoke Yiddish or Polish or both. You know if you\u2019 re utterly\nfluent it probably depends on your mood. Yiddish was definitely his mother tongue, what he\ndreamed in, what he counted in was definitely Yiddish, but I don\u2019t know. I bet they spoke\nYiddish. I think most Jews spoke Yiddish.\nhour you were talking Polish. But then if you stopped talking for a minute and then started\ntalking again you probably would speak Yiddish because Yiddish was the natural thing to speak.\nAfter the war in America my father was utterly fluent in English. He learned English very\nquickly and spoke English with my mother who was American born. But with his friends from\nLukow who had survived the war, and some of them had as partisans and so on, these friends\nwho were in America, their natural language that they spoke was Yiddish although all of them\nwere modern. None of them were orthodox and so forth. The natural language they would\nspeak was Yiddish. But sometimes they would just speak Polish and it would drive my mother\ncrazy because as an American Jew she did know Yiddish but she didn\u2019t know Polish. And she\nwould get very angry with them when they spoke Polish and the angrier she got the more they\nwould speak Polish to make her angrier because they were very jealous of her because she had\nparents because she was American and they didn\u2019t. The thing they had on her was that they\ncould speak more languages and so they would speak Polish. But my guess is that Yiddish\nwould be the language of his home. I don\u2019t know what kind of home he lived in. He was\ncertainly reasonably prosperous, certainly middle class and definitely in contact with his family\nin Lukow. He still had brothers and I think his sister was there. His mother certainly was there.\nOf course he had aunts and uncles and cousins and nieces and nephews. All of his brothers and\nsisters had married. They all had children. He was the closest with his sister. The sibling he\ntalked the very most about was his sister. They were named for the same person. Mendel is a\nYiddish nickname for Menachem and so technically his name was Menachem Mendel Tzidik. I\nshould tell you my father\u2019s formal name was Menachem Mendel Tzidik Rosenblit which would\ntranslate -- Tzidik 1s Tzadok. Just a Jewish way of saying Tzadok and Nehama, his sister, who\nwas called Nechuma, ?? raised eyes that she was called Nechuma. Nechuma was obviously\nnamed for the same person. She was born first and they named her Nehama to be after\nwhatever relative, Menachem. So when my father was born they named him after the same\nrelative. So he was very close with his sister and he talked about Meir because Meir was\nunusual because he was the one who had the secular education and had gone off to study\nmedicine. That was all he talked about with any specificity except in terms of how each of\nthem died in the Holocaust and I can tell you about that when we talk about the war years. I\ndon\u2019t know what his wife did. I don\u2019t know if his wife worked or not. Probably not given the\n1930\u2019s in Poland and middle class family. I doubt that she worked. They were definitely\nmiddle class. This is not somebody making -- with nostalgia, hindsight, looking back because\nwell maybe this isn\u2019t a good historical -- forget this. I was going to say I\u2019ve seen the list of\nproperty that he presented to the United Restitution Organization as part of his reparation claim.\nIt\u2019s the kind of things middle class people have, you know silver and whatever, fur coats and so\nforth. But you know people could lie on those so that\u2019s not necessary a good source. I think\nthat despite the very terrible situation for Jews in Poland in the 1930\u2019s, you know very high\nanti-Semitism and very terrible economy and so forth. That my father did reasonably well. He\ncertainly didn\u2019t give any thought as far as I know to migrating, although, there was no place to\nmigrate to except for Palestine. And he wasn\u2019t enough of a Zionist to want to go to Palestine\nalthough his brother Haim Yakov did. They had relatives in America like probably every Jew in\nPoland but America was out of the question by the twenties so I think he was perfectly content\nto be in Poland. In terms of his attitude to Poland as a country, actually when he was born, he\nwas born in Russia, and of course the Polish Jews hated Russia because they were discriminated\nagainst so severely, I think he thought of himself as a Polish national. I think he was a typical\nJew in Poland in the sense that his primary identity was as a Jew. If you asked him, who are\nyou, what are you, he would say Iam a Jew. But he was Polish, he spoke Polish, he identified\nwith the Polish state. He thought of himself as a Polish subject. He used that word actually.\nHe called himself a Polish subject which is a funny archaic word which is usually used for\nkingdoms. But that\u2019s how Jews were in Poland. They were members of the Polish state but they\nweren\u2019t Poles so he would never have said that he was a Pole because he wasn\u2019t a Pole, he was\na Jew. I suppose he was hoping that the Polish Republic would get to be a nicer place than it\nwas. As I said I was ten when he died and at ten I didn\u2019t ask him such nice interesting political\nquestions as what you thought about Poland and how you related to Poland and so on. What\nelse could I tell you about right before the war?",
        "A: That\u2019s what you need. So basically before the war, on the eve of the war, in 1939, on\nSeptember 1, 1939, my father had a business that was reasonably prosperous. He lived in a\ntown near Warsaw called Wolomin. He had a wife; he had two children, a boy and a girl. He\nhad a huge extended family. He had a very large family, he had a mother and sisters and\nbrothers, nieces and nephews, aunts and uncles, cousins. He had a large and intact and\nfunctioning family. And then the war started.",
        "A: What happened, okay. You know I\u2019m used to telling the story to my six -year old son and of\ncourse to my six- year old son I have to include what happened during the war. I have to sketch\nout the war and what the Nazis did to the Jews and I don\u2019t have to do that here. In the first\nmonths of the war there was just chaos and all kinds of restrictions against the Jews. I assume\nthat his business was Aryanized because that\u2019s what the Germans did as soon as they came in.\nThey Aryanized businesses giving them to ethnic Germans. I assume my father was not\ncompensated for it. He was a clever man. He probably managed to get stuff out of it before it\nwas technically Aryanized. In all the stories he talked about the years before he was deported to\nAuschwitz he never mentioned that he was starving to death and he was living on the street or\nanything like that. Of course he was starving but he wasn\u2019t......He must have managed to get\nsomething out of his business even though he wasn\u2019t compensated for it. You read about this in\nthe memoirs people who with Polish friends manage to make arrangements and deals and so\nforth. But anyway his business was confiscated, his bank accounts frozen, all of those things\ntaken from him. But then, of course, he was in the ghetto. Now when my father was alive and\nhe talked about his experiences in the war he always simply said the ghetto. He didn\u2019t specify\nwhich one. When my mother, who is not a historian and who is not at all good with details and\nin fact was terrible with details, when my mother talked about it for him, after he died, or when\nI would ask her as I got a little older, well which ghetto, she said the Warsaw ghetto, that he was\nin the Warsaw ghetto. Some of the details of his story very much match the Warsaw ghetto in\nterms of.....well the fact 1s he escaped from the ghetto when it was burning in April 1943.\nThat\u2019s the Warsaw ghetto. What other ghetto was burning in April \u201943 that you could escape\nfrom in some way. But on the other hand, he didn\u2019t live in Warsaw. He lived in Wolomin which\nwas close to Warsaw. There could have been a ghetto in Wolomin. On the other hand it was so\nclose to Warsaw that all the people may have been moved to Warsaw. But usually people who\nhad to move into a place did very, very badly. And my father obviously didn\u2019t fare badly. I\nthink that he probably was in the Warsaw ghetto. He probably did just simply get moved from\nWolomin into Warsaw. Let\u2019s say for the purposes of this record that he was in the Warsaw\nghetto.",
        "A: No, I have never done that. It\u2019s funny, I\u2019m a historian and not a genealogist and so \u2019'm\ninterested in what happened to the Jews and I\u2019ve never bothered to look up the specifics of my\nfather\u2019s experience in any systematic way. A lot of his experiences that he described are very,\nvery similar to what you read in the memoirs. So it fits in very well. But I never tried\nto.....when I was reading Itzhak Arrad\u2019s book about ???? Treblinka which is about the operation\n??? death camps which basically gassed all the Jews of Poland and certainly the region he was\nliving in because the section of Poland that both he and his family was in was the general\ngovernment. The Germans came in and annexed the Bartoland and created the general\ngovernment and the Soviets took the eastern part of Poland. So my father was in the general\ngovernment. Anyway when I read that I did pay attention to see if there was any word about\nWolomin. There was description of deportations from Wolomin but I don\u2019t know. There\nprobably are no records of the Wolomin ghetto. In any case, for the sake of argument I say that\nmy father was in the Warsaw ghetto. I think he may have worked for the Jewish Council. He\nnever said that. This is not a memory I have from him or from my mother or from my cousin\nMutti who wouldn\u2019t have known because my cousin Mutti could only give me information\nabout the pre-war period because he left in 1938. I have a memory from when I was a child of a\nfriend of my father\u2019s from Wolomin, a man who had been a worker of his in his lumberyard\nwho he was in Auschwitz with and who had also survived and who remained a friend after the\nwar. He\u2019s still alive, a man named Shaya May. I think he\u2019s still alive. He was alive five years\nago when my mother died because I called him but I assume he\u2019s still alive. Shaya once I\nremember when I was a child, it was right after my father died, too, actually he was talking to\nmy mother about my father during the war. He mentioned something about my father working\nfor that traitorous Council or something like that. A lot of Jews hated the Council. He was\ncertainly not a member of the Council, of the 24 hot shots on the Council because I certainly\nwould have come across his name if he were. The Warsaw ghetto Judenhad had several\nhundred employees so he may have known someone who knew somebody who got him a job on\nthe Council. So he may have worked on the Council. From my memories of all the stories of\nthe ghetto years I don\u2019t have any sense that he was in terrible shape. Obviously all the Jews had\nvery little food and fuel and so forth. Things were very difficult in the ghettoes. But his family\nwas intact. He had a son and his daughter. His son and daughter attended school. I think his\nwife taught school in the ghetto. My mother said that. Either she taught school or she taught\npiano. I think both stories, I remember. So she was involved in this kind of moral resistance\nthat took place, the organization of clandestine schools, and sort of doing moral and cultural and\nso forth things. I don\u2019t think I know very much more about the specific ghetto experience.",
        "A: That I just don\u2019t know. The only person who might know is Shaya May but Shaya never\nwanted to talk about his experiences very much whereas my father talked about it all the time. I\nshould add I have another source about my father\u2019s experiences and that is that when he went to\nschool in America, when he came to America, the equivalent of \u201cWhat I did on my summer\nvacation,\u201d he had to write an essay about his experiences. He had to write an essay that\ndescribed his experiences during the war, I guess, so he wrote, I have part of that essay, part of\nit is missing. But he just says I suffered terribly and goes on. He doesn\u2019t provide specific\ndetails about what it was like in the ghetto or in the camps. There was also, of course, the\ntestimony that he provided to B. Goodmachen for the reparation claim which my mother typed\nand of which there is no copy although she swears she made one. She doesn\u2019t know what\nhappened to it and she suspects that my father actually destroyed the copy. I don\u2019t know why.\nBut the copy just doesn\u2019t exist. Most of her memories I suppose come from that formal\ndocument that she typed for him. So I don\u2019t know if he lived with others or what the situation\nwas. Probably he did, most Jews did, it was a very crowded situation. Most of his family, of\ncourse, was in Lukow, in the Lukow ghetto although he had a brother in Warsaw. Simcha was\nin Warsaw and Simcha was shot for playing cards after curfew. He was shot during the time of\nthe ghetto. I mean for not playing cards but after playing cards going out in the street. So\nSimcha died before the deportations. And he had been in Warsaw because he had moved to\nWarsaw already in the thirties or twenties or something and I don\u2019t know why he had moved or\nwhat he did at all. Again my cousin Mutti would probably know although he may not because\nsince he was in Lukow he didn\u2019t really know the war.....he actually knew my father the least\nwell because my father was already in Warsaw. He remembers my father coming home to visit\ntwice or three times and giving him a ball or something like that. His stories are really best.\nFrom my cousin Mutti in Israel I mostly learned about my grandmother, about Masha\nRozenblit, because that was his grandmother, too. Anyway so I really don\u2019t know much about\nthe ghetto years except that things were okay. His brother was shot but things were reasonably\nokay. Of course then came the deportations. During the deportations from the Lukow ghetto,\nhis mother was shot. She was in her sixties and rather than take her to Treblinka or Sobibor or\nwherever they were taking the Jews from Lukow, they shot her. Somebody must have\nwitnessed that because how else would he have known, he wasn\u2019t in Lukow. She was shot. I\nassume the rest of his relatives in Lukow, aunts, uncles, cousins, Shia and his family were\nprobably just deported to wherever Jews from Lukow were deported to and gassed.",
        "A: No, well of all Polish Jewry, it\u2019s \u201942. The operation Rhinehart which just simply went\nmethodically and liquidated all the ghettoes began something like March of \u201942 and was over\nby October \u201942 with some pockets left. That is there were Jews left in the Warsaw ghetto and in\nthe....was it the Lublin? Yeah the Lublin ghetto was made into a labor camp and a couple of\nother places. There were pockets where they allowed Jews to still continue. Those were\ndestroyed in \u201943. I assume that probably all of those relatives were killed in \u201942 unless by some\nchance Shia or another one of his brothers was in the labor camp, in the Jeneska Road labor\ncamp or Poniyet Tovah, I forgot there were a whole bunch of labor camps in the Lublin area\nwhich maybe his brother or one of his nephews because if my father\u2019s son was already twelve\nby that time then his older brother\u2019s kids could have been teenagers. So maybe they were\nin.....But I just don\u2019t know. I assume that everybody was just killed in \u201942. His sister Nehama,\nthough, who lived in Lukow with her family, you know I wrote down that her name was\nPearlman but maybe her name was Bernstein. Yes, her name was Bernstein. Pearlman was my\nfather\u2019s wife\u2019s maiden name. She and her husband who was much shorter than her, that was the\njoke of the family, that Nehama who was very tall, I presumably look like Nehama, -- that when\nI was a kid we would go to the Lukow Young Men\u2019s Benevolent Association and all the people\nwho had come from my father\u2019s town -- and people would go Nehama, Nehama. They looked\nat me. I don\u2019t look like her in the pictures but they thought I looked like her. But anyway she\nand her family, her husband and her children (she probably had teen-age children) hid in the\nwoods. They somehow escaped the ghetto. I don\u2019t know if they escaped in 42 or if they\nescaped earlier but they were hiding in the woods near there in the Lublin region. And they\nwere only killed in \u201944, about three months before the end of the war in that part of Poland.\nThey were handed over by some Poles to the Nazis at that point. So I don\u2019t know what\nhappened to them if they were then sent to Auschwitz or if they were shot right away or\nwhatever. But they did succeed in hiding. Nechuma, I should be fair, her name was not\nNehama, her name was Nechuma. Actually she used a Polish name too, Helenie, she used the\nname Helenie. There are pictures on the back that say Helenie. I think she was the only one\nthat used a Polish name. My father didn\u2019t. He used Mendel, his Yiddish name and all the\nothers, Shia, Meir, they all used their Hebrew names. But she used both Nechuma and Helenie.\nBut anyway, Nechuma and her family, that had been hiding for years, at least for two, maybe\neven more than two, were handed over to the Nazis by some Poles for (as my mother used to\nsay, for a bottle of vodka). The Poles were given booty for handing over Jews. Now I don\u2019t\nknow if these people had just happened upon them and turned them over or if these were people\nwho had been helping them all along and then turned them over, because often people were\nhiding with the assistance of Poles. Maybe it was neighbors, good Poles who were helping\nthem who turned them over, who knows. I think that most of his family, the Lukow branch of\nthe family, his mothers and brothers and sisters, well whatever, there\u2019s not that many brothers\nby that time because Simcha and his family were in Warsaw and presumably they were\ndeported in 1942. Simcha had been shot earlier for curfew violations but presumably his family\nwas deported in \u201942 when most of the Jews in Warsaw were deported. In Lukow Haim, his\nbrother Haim Yakov had already gone to Palestine although his family hadn\u2019t. My father\u2019s\nbrother Haim Yakov had gone to Palestine in 1937 alone. His son Mutti, followed him in 1938\nleaving the wife and the other children. So they were all presumably killed also in \u201942. Shia\nwas there and his family presumably were all killed and Nehama was there but she was in\nhiding until \u00b044 when she was handed over to the Nazis, she and her family were handed over to\nthe Nazis and killed and of course Meir was in Paris and he was deported, I assume, again I\ndon\u2019t know this, but I assume he was deported in July of 1942 when the big raid in Paris took\nplace, July 16 I believe, 1942, when most Polish Jews in Paris were deported. Now this is not\nnecessarily true. He could have escaped to the south and have been picked up at some other\ntime. He definitely was deported to Auschwitz because after the war my cousin Mutti in Israel,\nhe was too upset to deal with the issue but his wife Zeporah, spent months dealing with the Red\nCross and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency to track down all the Rozenblit\nrelatives, also her own relatives from her own family. But her family was mostly in Palestine\nbecause they were all Zionist who\u2019d come mostly in the 20\u2019s. So she tracked them down and\nshe found my father and she found nobody else. So in fact the first time I saw those letters I\nwanted to cry because the first letter had to be in English, the Red Cross would only deal in\nEnglish. So the first letter to my father that my cousin Mutti wrote to his uncle was in English\nso I could read it easily and my father didn\u2019t know English yet but Mutti knew English and then\nof course all subsequent correspondence was just real letters because my father had a real\naddress and that was all in Yiddish which I could read too but with much more difficulty so I\ndidn\u2019t read it quite as easily. But she found nobody else. So I assume obviously she would\nhave found -- there were all these organizations after the war, all these Jewish and non-Jewish\norganizations tracking down people. So he was presumably killed either in \u00b042 or 43 or 44,\neverybody else. And Nehama definitely in 44. Simcha at some point before \u201942, everybody\nelse in \u2019\u00b042 except for my father and his family. In any case assuming that my father was in the\nWarsaw ghetto, his family was able to stay there after that initial depletion of the Warsaw ghetto\nin August/September of 1942. That confirms that he worked for the Jewish Council actually\nbecause the people who stayed in Warsaw, the 70,000 or so that remained after the major\nliquidation either worked for the Jewish Council or were involved in SS industry, or whatever\nindustry that was working for the German economy.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Also I think the Wolomin ghetto was simply, I read that in Orad the Wolomin was\ntotally destroyed in 1942. So my father I know was in the ghetto until April of 1943. That\u2019s\nWarsaw, that April \u201943 date is so fundamentally Warsaw that he had to have been in the Warsaw\nghetto. In fact he always lit a yahrtzeit candle for his children at Pesach because that\u2019s around, I\nmean the Warsaw ghetto was finally liquidated on the second night of Pesach. And they didn\u2019t\ndie that night. [ll tell that story in a minute but it was just a few weeks later. So Pesach of\n1943, so Pesach is when he lit a yahrtzeit candle for everybody then. I don\u2019t know, maybe\nbecause he was in Warsaw and that had such an impact on his conscience. His mother was\nprobably shot at some point in 1942 not necessarily at Pesach. My father, therefore, and his\nwife and his children and his wife\u2019s sister who was crippled, not totally crippled but she\nschlepped a leg for whatever reason, they were together in the ghetto. So he was in the ghetto\nafter that liquidation in August/September 1942 when most of the people in the ghetto were\nliquidated. So he was one of the 70,000 that stayed in the ghetto until April of \u201943 when the\nNazis decided on the final liquidation of the ghetto. Now my father in 1943, he was born in\n1907, so in 1943 he was 36. Well he wasn\u2019t yet because his birthday 1s November, so he was 35\nyears old. And he had a twelve-year old son and an eight-year old daughter and a wife and a\nsister-in-law. And they decided to escape from the burning ghetto. Because of the uprising the\nNazis sort of bombed the ghetto and sent in firebombs and so forth and basically burned the\nghetto down. And my father and his family decided to escape from the ghetto. I don\u2019t know if\nthat means they went through the sewers or not. In Warsaw that\u2019s how people escaped from the\nghetto. This is where he really told. My father told the stories from the escape from the Warsaw\nghetto until liberation. That\u2019s what he told. The ghetto experience didn\u2019t interest him. That\nmust mean that it was not too terrible. My image of hearing the story as a child was that they\nescaped into the woods. But there are no woods around the Warsaw ghetto or around Warsaw\neven for that matter. So I don\u2019t know how they escaped, presumably they did it through the\nsewers. But in any case they escaped. Oh, I do know, my mother I think told me this that he\ndid make attempts through Polish, non-Jewish friends to get his children to be taken by non-\nJews. And nobody would do it. He was unable to get anybody to agree to do that. So anyway\nthere he was with his twelve year old, his eight year old, his wife and his sister-in-law and they\nescaped and somehow they made it to some woods, or maybe not to some woods, they were just\nout. They had a kind of pact that if one of them should get lost, they would not look for that\nperson because that could be problematic and instead if one of them should get lost, they should\ngo to a farm house that they knew which was some distance away, my memory is 90 kilometers\nbut I was a little kid when I heard this so I don\u2019t know where it was. Somehow Avraham, my\nfather\u2019s son, who by the way was not called Avraham, that\u2019s my way of Hebraisizing it again,\nit\u2019s Avremy, the Yiddish nickname for Abraham. Avremy who was twelve somehow got lost, he\nwasn\u2019t there. My father\u2019s wife said that she had to go look for Avremy and my father said no.\nWe'll lose you if you do that. We have to stick together and go to the farmhouse. We\u2019ll find\nAvremy at the farmhouse. And she just was mad with concern for her son who\u2019s not technically\nher son but she had raised him his whole life so he was her son. And she went to look for him\nand they never saw her again. I assume that means she was picked up by SS soldiers and by the\nSS and taken directly to Auschwitz which at that point was the only, by 1943 -- oh maybe not\nAuschwitz, maybe she was taken to Treblinka, I don\u2019t know where she was taken to but she was\npresumably killed. But my father and his daughter and his sister-in-law did go to this farm\nhouse and they found Avremy there without his shoes, a Polish farmer had taken them, probably\nhe needed them, probably he thought that Avremy would be killed soon anyway, what did he\nneed shoes for. Who knows why he took them, but he took them. This is April of \u201943, my\nfather, Avremy, Toby and Tova whatever, and his sister-in-law whose name I don\u2019t know and\nthen they were arrested, they were found. I mean it was very hard to really escape especially\nsince the Poles were so hostile and the Nazis were so eager to find them. And he was taken to\nAuschwitz. They were taken to Auschwitz. Of course my father was 35, and the rest of them\nwere not 35, they were twelve, eight, and I don\u2019t know how old his sister-in-law was,\npresumably in her thirties too but she was crippled. And she was as if the mother of these\nchildren. She was an adult female with two children. And so when they got to Auschwitz, he\nwas sent to the left or the right, whichever way. He was sent to do slave labor and they were\nsent the other way which means that they were gassed. So in April of 1943 his son and his\ndaughter and sister-in-law were killed by the Nazis. But he was in Auschwitz and he was a\nslave laborer in Auschwitz for a long time. He worked in Auschwitz and he would talk about\nhis experiences quite a lot. He talked about how awful it was although I must say that he did not\ndwell on how awful it was. My father talked about his experience in the camps a lot. Saturday\nnights when we would have company, in the 1950\u2019s if you were a Jewish family in Brooklyn\nyou would have bagels and lox for dinner, and we would have bagels and lox and herring and so\non and company and he would talk . People would say Mark what was it like. And he would\ntalk. And I just remember Saturday nights in my childhood hearing my father talk about this.\nAnd when he talked about it he did not talk about the horrors so much. He certainly made it\nvery clear that it was so horrific that you could not even imagine it. And in fact when people\nwould be nasty, nasty is the wrong word, but you know how Americans could be presumptuous\nand they would say, how could you have done such a thing? Like my father would say we\nfound a rat and we ate it or something. And they\u2019d say, ooh how could you eat a rat? It\u2019s not\nreally nasty. And he would say, you shouldn\u2019t talk, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be in a fire.\nI remember the expression, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be in a fire. But he wouldn\u2019t dwell\non how awful it was except to indicate that 1t was unbearably awful and constant beatings and\nstarvation and filth and dirt and crowded and disgusting. He indicated that but that\u2019s not what\nhe dwelled on. What he dwelled on instead in his talking about it was the things that people did\nto survive and the things that people did to help each other survive. The image that I had as a\nchild of what it was like in the camps was unbearable sadism and cruelty on the part of the\nNazis but the inmates being human, working to do things that would make themselves survive\nand things that human beings do. I don\u2019t mean that human beings are pigs and do horrible\nthings, but in the good sense of being human, that is if helping each other and working together\nto try to survive, and so forth. For example he always spoke about what the memoirs all talked\nabout, that is the whole business of organization, the whole network through which people\nbargained and traded and bartered and traded their bread for other things. He talked all the time\nof it how it was crucial to trade your bread for soap, or to trade your bread for an onion or for\ngarlic or something and soap so you could clean yourself. Onions or garlic so you could get\nvitamins. All of that which I\u2019ve read in umpteen memoirs but he talked about that all the time,\nabout the need to trade. Of course the whole network depended on pilfering from Nazi\nstewards and from the suitcases of people who came in to be gassed. So he talked about that a\nlot. He didn\u2019t use the word organization as far as I can remember but maybe he did and I just\ndon\u2019t remember. But he talked about that you really needed to do that. He also talked, in fact\nmore importantly than this whole organization business, he talked about holding on to the will\nto live. My most vivid memory I have from childhood, the most single vivid memory of my\nown childhood is my father talking about holding on to the will to live. And that the only way\nyou could survive such a horrible place was to hold on to the will to live and that\u2019s how you did\nit, you just held on to the will to live. Like literally held on to it. And every second said, I\u2019m\ngoing to live, I\u2019m going to live, I\u2019m going to live. I just remember that vividly. I don\u2019t\nremember what he said how you did it, how you held on to the will to live or what strategies he\nused to hold on to the will to live, which I read about in memoirs, thinking about the past,\nthinking about the future, thinking about this, whatever. There are different strategies that\npeople used. That I don\u2019t remember, his own personal strategies. But I do remember him\ntalking about that -- holding on to the will to live. I also remember that of course it made him\nlose all faith in God. Actually I don\u2019t remember that, I take that back. He did lose all faith in\nGod. But that he didn\u2019t tell me about. My mother told me about that when I was older. He\ndidn\u2019t want me to know that because he didn\u2019t think that was fair to me. He thought that I was\na child and not know that he didn\u2019t believe in God as a result of Auschwitz. And he didn\u2019t\nbelieve in God because his children had been killed and everybody\u2019s children had been killed\nnot just his. That didn\u2019t stop him from wanting to have a kosher home or from going to shul all\nthe time. He didn\u2019t stop being a Jew, you know what I mean? Well, actually he did stop going\nto shul until I was born. From the time the war ended until I was born he would not go into a\nshul, he would not do anything religious. He would not go into a Passover seder, he would not\ndo anything religious. No, that\u2019s not true. He would go to a Passover seder. I think that was\nthe only religious thing he would do but he would not go to shul. When I was born he didn\u2019t\neven think about it. He went to shul to name me. He was a Jew. That\u2019s what eastern Jewry was\nlike. You were a Jew. You did things because you were a Jew. Jews named their daughters in\nshul. The angel of death might kill your daughter if you didn\u2019t do that. You know you had to.\nJust because you didn\u2019t believe in God didn\u2019t mean that you didn\u2019t name your daughter in shul.\nAnd that broke the ice and he went to shul all the time. He loved to go to shul. He absolutely\nloved to go to shul. He didn\u2019t go every week, he wasn\u2019t religious. But he went at least once a\nmonth. He really loved to go to shul. In fact he even wanted me to go to a Jewish day school\nbut my mother didn\u2019t want me to go because we weren\u2019t that religious and in those days it was\njust orthodox schools. Getting back to his experiences I don\u2019t remember that he talked about\nhow he lost his faith in God but that was a central experience that he had in the camps, the loss\nof faith.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember anything specific from the camps except the business of trading bread for\nsoap which is not a specific incident; I\u2019m sure he did it more than once and the business of\nholding on to the will to live and the sense of how unbearable it was. I think in his testimony\nfor reparations he did provide some specific instances. But my mother, who unfortunately was\nterrible at details didn\u2019t remember them and had lost the carbon copy. I\u2019m sure he was beaten\nmercilessly many times as was everybody, I mean he wasn\u2019t singled out. I\u2019m sure there were\nbut I really don\u2019t unfortunately know any very specific thing. In terms of what he actually did\nin the camp, I assume he did a variety of labor things. He could be a carpenter so presumably\nwhen they asked him what do you do, he said I\u2019m a carpenter and they did have him building.\nMy mother used to say that he built crematoria. But they were already built by the time he got\nthere so I don\u2019t -- see my mother was really bad at detail. It was a shame. I\u2019m a historian\nconcerned with detail and she wasn\u2019t. And my father died when I was young. So I\u2019m bringing\nall these memories of sitting around our table listening so I can think of something very\nspecific.",
        "A: I remember that he would be annoyed with people who presumed -- like if he would discuss --\nin the Warsaw ghetto for example he would say how it was wonderful when a horse would die\nand they would just eat the horse meat and people would say, horse, how could you eat horse,\nand he would say, lady, you haven\u2019t been through a fire, you don\u2019t know. People were in awe of\nmy father. He was a very intelligent man and they would sit there sort of enthralled with his\nstories. I don\u2019t remember a specific incident unless I keep on talking I'll come to something. I\ndon\u2019t remember anything specific. I do know that he was in Auschwitz from April of \u201943 until\nJanuary of \u201945 when the Russians -- so in terms of your dates through 1944 he was in\nAuschwitz. In January of 1945 as you know the Russians came very close to Auschwitz.\nKnowing that the Russians were going to be there any minute the Nazis evacuated the camp and\nin the famous death march that Elie Wiesel and millions of other -- Isabella Leitner -- millions\nof other people described -- marched off people to Germany. And my father was part of that\ndeath march. I remember him describing that a little bit in more detail than the camps. I\nremember him saying that it was very cold. It was January, it was winter, and they didn\u2019t have\nboots and they didn\u2019t have coats. Two thirds of the people died. And I remember him saying\nthat you couldn\u2019t fall asleep because if you let yourself fall asleep you would die. The snow\nwas deceptive. You think that it\u2019s warm when you\u2019re in it and so you could fall asleep. And\nthen of course you freeze to death because 1n fact it\u2019s not warm it\u2019s cold. So you should never\ngo to sleep in the snow. And I remember him saying that they would force each other to stay\nawake. In some of the memoirs I\u2019ve read about how they were put in barns, my father never\ntalked about that. He just talked about the snow and how people straggled, they would be shot\nof course and the Nazis would beat people up. The Nazis were very nervous of course at this\npoint. He was taken to Dachau. Other people went to other places. They were in Bergen-\nBelsen, Buchenwald. They were all taken to concentration camps in Germany. He personally\nwas taken to Dachau where he spent the next few months. I don\u2019t know how long it actually\ntook him to get from Auschwitz to Dachau. In some of the memoirs you read how that part of\nthe way they were on trains and trucks and so forth. My father never said that. He just said the\ndeath march. He called it the death march and he said they took us to Dachau. So he was in\nDachau for a few months and he was liberated by the Americans in April of 1945. And I have a\ncouple of little stories that I remember of the actual liberation. Not of the moment of liberation.\nNot of the moment of liberation although I have a wonderful story of somebody else of the\nactual moment but I won\u2019t put this in my father\u2019s record. It\u2019s one of those classic stories, the\nother story of how this other person got out of Dachau. The Nazis left the camp before the\nAmericans got there and he was wandering around the streets and was almost shot by some\nAmerican soldiers but he spoke Yiddish to them and one of them happened to be Jewish and so\nforth. That\u2019s not my father\u2019s story. Right after liberation he and Shia, this person who had been\nhis employee in Wolomin before the war and had been in Auschwitz with him and had been in\nthe orchestra in Auschwitz actually, my father was just a laborer in Auschwitz but Shia was in\nthe orchestra and they were in the death march together and so forth. And after the war they\nwere walking around and Shia picked up a rotten potato from the street that he saw and my\nfather said what are you doing that for because now we have food. And Shia was still too\nscared that there would be no food. But that again is not my father\u2019s story because that\u2019s not\nwhat he did. He of course was nothing at the end of the war. He was utterly emaciated and\nutterly depleted. My mother used to say he weighed fifty pounds at the end of the war. I can\u2019t\nbelieve that. But he must have weighed seventy or eighty. My mother was also an exaggerator\na little bit. But I bet he weighed seventy pounds at the end of the war. He was not a huge man\nanyway, he was probably about five nine. He was broad but thin.",
        "A: Yeah. He was actually old to survive. Most of the survivors were teenagers, which is why\nthey\u2019re still alive. My father if he were alive today would be in his eighties. I mean he\nhappened to die when he was young. He happened to die when he was fifty-three but even if he\nhadn\u2019t died and if he were still alive the man would be eighty-four years old. No, that\u2019s not\nright. Yes, he would be eighty-five on his next birthday. Whereas most of the survivors that\nyou talk to I\u2019m sure are in their seventies because they were teenagers or in their early twenties\nduring the war. My father was a very old survivor, very unusual, he must have been\nextraordinarily strong. It\u2019s funny to say that somebody in their mid-thirties would already be no\nlonger at the height of their physical strength but it\u2019s true. So it\u2019s just amazing that he lived.\nBut anyway he was liberated by the Americans. He did not go to a DP camp which was the\nstandard experience but rather he went to work for the United Nations Relief and Restitution\nAgency and his job for them was to help people find housing. He must have learned English\nworking for them or before but he lived in an apartment in Munich. He had a real apartment\nand had a real job and sort of went about his business. I assume for a few months, I mean I\nassume that immediately after the war he was, it took months to recuperate. In fact he said that\nit was months before he felt like a human being again. I do know that most of his teeth had\nrotted during the war and that one of the first things he did when he had some modicum of\nstrength was he just walked around the streets of Munich and looked for a dentist. He found a\ndentist, walked in, asked the dentist to pull whatever was left and to give him false teeth. The\ndentist wanted to give him anesthesia for the pulling and he said, no need. He was so into pain\nthat it didn\u2019t matter. And the German dentist didn\u2019t charge him because my father had a number,\nhe had been in Auschwitz. He just showed his number. In fact in those days you just showed\nyour number and you got anything. He didn\u2019t pay for too much after the war. The apartment I\nthink was also free.",
        "A: Well, if they were in a DP camp they got food from the UN.",
        "A: But if they lived in cities -- well my father worked, I mean my father had a real job, but before\nthat he didn\u2019t have the job from the first minute, I think it was not a problem.",
        "A: Yeah, although the Germans didn\u2019t have any food. They must have been given food by the\nAmerican army of occupation. He must have just been given it. I don\u2019t know that. I know\nsomebody who studies the DP camps, she might know. Anyway, so he wasn\u2019t ina DP camp. I\nassume he stayed in Dachau because that\u2019s what they did. They set up barracks and gave\npeople food and medicine and let them come to themselves. We have pictures of my father\nright after the war, not right, right after the war but in 46 where he looks fine. He had\nobviously regained his strength and so forth. But so he lived and worked for UNRRA and he\ndid have housing and he had a German, non-Jewish girlfriend who he lived with which 1s very\nweird. And she knew Yiddish which 1s very weird.",
        "A: Well, yeah, she was a Bavarian. She was a beautiful woman. Her name was Lisa, well probably\nElizabeth, but Lisa was her nickname. Just a beautiful woman. Her husband had been a soldier\nprobably and he probably had been killed and she was probably lonely and my father had access\nto food and people were starving. She wanted to marry him actually and he couldn\u2019t do that.\nTo live with her is one thing, to sleep with a shiksa is one thing; to marry a shiksa after you just\n..... Lremember him saying he used to have dreams. His mother would come and beat him up\nin his dreams. The very idea that he would even think of marrying a shiksa was -- a German\nshiksa no else. Well, I mean from my grandmother\u2019s point of view a shiksa 1s a shiksa, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter what kind. But the fact that she was also a German shiksa didn\u2019t really help. Ill\nshow you her picture. She was gorgeous, just beautiful. I have this huge urge to look her up\nalthough she\u2019s probably eighty-five years old, too. I mean at the end of the war how old was\nmy father? In 1947 he was forty right. And she may have been ten years younger so she would\nonly be in her mid-seventies at this time. I don\u2019t know her name.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know her name. Her name is Lisa. I don\u2019t know her last name. Although actually some\nof my father\u2019s Lukower friends, that is the friends from the town that he met again in America,\nthey might know her name because she lived with him. All these pictures of my father and his\nother survivor friends in Germany after the war. There she is, she\u2019s with them. My father did\nknow German though, he probably did speak to her in German. Anyway, so he lived in\nGermany and had this job, joined the Zionist organization and stuff and then in December of\n1947 he came to the United States. That was right after Congress passed that emergency\nlegislation allowing in 100,000 victims of Nazi persecution. I guess because he worked for\nUNRRA he was able more easily than others to get an early seat in that. And he came to the\nUnited States in December of 1947 leaving Lisa behind in Munich. I don\u2019t think he ever had\nany contact with her again. Maybe initially he did but not for very long. He got himself a job\nvery quickly. It was the only job he ever had in America. He actually lived with a Lukower.\nHe lived with Mrs. Feldman who had moved to America God knows when. But her son, Muttel,\nwho was my father\u2019s friend in Europe and had survived the war also, and was my father\u2019s friend\nin Germany, he lived with his mother, Mrs. Feldman. Muttel came later to America, too. But\nhe lived with Mrs. Feldman. He wandered around lower Manhattan looking for a job, he got a\njob right away for a company called Civikoppen Minor which did store fixtures, you know\nfurniture that\u2019s inside stores. And he worked both as a carpenter -- he knew how to work with\nwood, he owned a lumberyard, and he was also very handy, actually more than handy. He was\ntalented with his hands. He could build beautiful things and so on. So he got a job there,\ninitially I guess just as a carpenter since he didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know, whatever -- but he also\nworked for them supervising job installations. When they did Bambergers in New Jersey, he\nwent out to Bambergers and made sure the job was done right. And what he wanted more than\nanything was to save up enough money to open some kind of business. He was an\nentrepreneur by nature and that\u2019s what he wanted to do. He died before he could do that. But\nthat\u2019s what he wanted to do. So he got a job right away, I mean he probably got a job three days\n-- oh actually I have a funny story to tell. I know you\u2019re mostly interested in the Holocaust but\nI love this story. When he came to America he was met at the boat by his aunt, Judith Marcus,\nMarcusfeld shortened to Marcus. Actually she was an aunt-in-law. She was his mother\u2019s\nbrother\u2019s wife. His mother\u2019s brother had died. They had come to America probably before\nWorld War I and had shortened the name to Marcus to make it more American. Anyway his\nuncle was dead but Judith Marcus met him at the boat and she said to him, today I'll speak to\nyou in Yiddish, tomorrow only English. You\u2019re now in America, you have to speak English.\nPresumably he knew some English because he worked for UNRRA. Today I will call you\nMendel, but from now on you have to have an American name and your name 1s Mark. She\ngave him a name that was common in America. In 1947 Mark was acommon name. So in fact,\nwhen he became a citizen in 1951 he changed his name to Mark. So in America he was Mark\nRozenblit, although my mother called him alternate.....she called him Mark most of the time,\nbut she called him Mendel when she was being affectionate because that was his name. Mendel\nwas his name. He was forty-four years old when he changed his name to Mark. Although he\nused it, 1t was his American name. My cousins called him uncle Mark and my uncle called him -\n- I mean everybody called him Mark. Anyway he came to America, was met by his aunt, he got\na job, and he met my mother a year and a half later in June of 1949 and they got married in\nNovember of 1949 and they had me in October of 1950. The rest is history. He adjusted\nextremely well to America. He loved America. He felt utterly happy to be American. He had\nan American wife which is unusual for survivors. He didn\u2019t feel the need to be -----of course he\nwas friends with all the people who survived from his town. My mother hated them. They\nwere a bunch of people who survived from this town. Actually a very large number considering\nhow tiny the town was. Virtually all of them had been in the Partisans, except for Muttel. I\nthink Muttel had been in the camps. Everybody else, I forget all their names now, Frimmet.\nGod, Frimmet, Frimmet and Dave Rosen. They\u2019re so unlikely to have been in the Partisans, it\u2019s\namazing. And Chayetta whose son looked like somebody else, not her husband. There\u2019s this\nsort of crew of people that I grew up with. Those people, I haven\u2019t seen them in a hundred\nyears.",
        "A: They all ended up in New York, all the survivors. There were probably eight of them; it\u2019s not\nlike there were hundreds of them. But there were some of them. Some of them actually\nsubsequently moved to Israel. In the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s they lived in America and 70\u2019s and some of\nthem retired to Israel. Well Frimmet and her husband and the Feldmans, Muttel and Fanny\nmoved to Israel. But I think Lola and her husband, I forget his name, they still live in America,\nin New York. I mean, unless they\u2019re dead, I haven\u2019t spoken to these people in a hundred years,\na hundred years, but a long time. So my father adjusted very, very well to life in America. He\nreally did. He didn\u2019t want to have children because he lost two. He had one because he thought\nit wasn\u2019t fair to my mother to impose that on her but he wouldn\u2019t have any others because it was\ntoo much of a risk that you could lose your children. In a way I replaced his daughter; his son\nhe mourned for continuously. He had nightmares all the time, all the time my mother said. I\ndon\u2019t remember that. That was from my mother. He was in his daily life in America, fine. He\njoked and laughed and was successful. I mean not successful in the huge sense but he had a job\nand worked and made a living and he was saving money for a business and he had an American\nfamily. I remember my father being loving and warm and it was fine in his waking\nconsciousness but of course he was racked by nightmares. He missed his son profoundly. He\nwas in excruciating pain at a barmitzvah. He had a very hard time at barmitzvahs because his\nson died just before his own. The loss of his children was really unbearable to him. The loss of\neveryone else he could handle but the loss of his children was unbearable to him.",
        "A: I felt it an honor. I felt very privileged. I felt very special as a child. I felt that I was privy,\nvery close to tis horrible thing that had happened to the Jewish people and therefore that I\nunderstood it better than others. I felt honored. I felt terrible for my father and the family and\nso forth. But I felt very special. I felt responsible, yes, but not in the negative sense of wishing\nthat I didn\u2019t have a burden but in the positive sense of feeling that I had a special responsibility\nto bear the information and the pain of it. I knew lots of other people in the same situation\nthough because although my mother was American and therefore all the family that I had was\nAmerican, that is her family, we knew a lot of survivors. Both because of the Lukower, all of\nthese people who had survived, but also because in Brooklyn in the fifties when I was growing\nup there were survivors. There were lots of survivors. I had friends whose parents were\nsurvivors. Not all my friends, certainly. In fact probably most of my friends didn\u2019t have\nsurvivor parents but Elaine and Esther Rosenberg\u2019s parents were survivors and whatever, I don\u2019t\nhave to name all the names. But there were plenty of other survivors around so it was not an\nunusual or weird thing at all. But yes I did feel a responsibility, a very great responsibility,\nprobably magnified by the fact that he died when I was ten years old. I remember, my father\nalways talked about it, I do not remember a time in my life when I did not know about the\nHolocaust. We didn\u2019t call it the Holocaust, of course, we called it the war, or the camps, or the\nNazis, whatever. So I don\u2019t remember not knowing about it. I always knew about it. But\nI do remember the first time I saw pictures. There was a series of pictures prepared by the\nAmerican army for Germans so they would know how horrible the camps were. And my father\nhad a set. In the back it said \u201cZo vais in Dachau\u201d So it was in Dachau. It was horrific pictures.\nYou know those really gross concentration camp pictures from the end of the war when things\nwere even worse, because there were bodies lying all over the place and so forth. And I\nremember I was eleven years old when I came across those pictures and I vomited. I remember\nthat very vividly. I mean this wasn\u2019t a picture of my father, of course, my father was alive. Not\nthen, he was already dead. Yeah, I felt this great responsibility because of it, absolutely.\nAnyway what else would you like to know about the whole thing.",
        "A: As much as you guys need, right.",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2019m just trying to think. You know of course I\u2019m not the survivor so I can\u2019t give you the\ndetails that your survivors are giving you. My father also did die when I was ten which means\nthat I didn\u2019t get a chance to question him and whatever. My cousin in Israel could only provide\ninformation about Poland before the war. My mother was bad at detail. So it\u2019s a hard thing.\nLet me just think of a few other things randomly. My father taught me not to hate all Germans\nbecause of the Nazis. He thought the Nazis were evil but he didn\u2019t hate all Germans. I mean I\nthink the fact that he had a non-Jewish girlfriend is a sign of that. He taught me that. He taught\nme that I had to distinguish between people. Nazis were evil but not all Germans were evil. I\nprobably did get the sense that all Poles were anti-Semitic in my childhood. That is, I think\nPolish Jewry in general thought that although no, no although. That was the sense I probably\ngot. I got the sense that obviously most people were killed but that those who survived did so\nnot because they were awful people. I mean there was this notion in certain circles especially in\nthe fifties that the people who survived had been vicious and horrible and mean and had killed\neach other and been dog eat dog. From my father I learned that you survived because you were\nclever. You held on to the will to live so you were strong psychologically. You were clever.\nYou figured things out. You were lucky, gutsy. That\u2019s what made you live, not being\nunderhanded and mean but being tough and strong. In fact I had a wonderful experience. I\nwent to the first international gathering of Holocaust survivors in Israel in 1981 and I in fact\ngave a paper on it. I gave a paper on teaching the Holocaust at the university level. But I went\nto not all the sessions but many of the sessions. I went to the final session which was held at the\nkotel, at the wall, when there were speeches. Menachem Begin spoke and Teddy Kollack\nspoke, everybody spoke, millions of speakers, all in English, really weird. But anyway English\nwas the common language because there were French survivors and whatever. Anyway so I\nwent to it and it got real cold. It was at night in Jerusalem in the summer and I was wearing a\njacket and I was feeling very cold. Begin, maybe he wasn\u2019t the last speaker, but he was one of\nthe last speakers and he was going on and on endlessly. Everybody else had spoken for two\nminutes because thee were hundreds of speakers. He was going on. He was already prime\nminister. He was going on and on and he was really being nasty. He was exhorting the crowd\nthat if they didn\u2019t live in Israel they were traitors to the Jewish people. It was a really not nice,\ndisgusting speech. Half the crowd started to leave. They just started to leave. They picked\nthemselves up and they walked. My American side, that is my Protestant side, I mean I\u2019m not a\nProtestant but you know what I mean, the American side that you just stand on line whatever,\nwas appalled that they would do that. Because, after all, even if you hate him, even if you think\nhe\u2019s saying awful things, and I certainly don\u2019t agree with Menachem Begin politically and I\nthough what he was saying was awful. But still he\u2019s the prime minister of a country. You don\u2019t\nget up and leave in the middle of his speech. It\u2019s just not nice even if you\u2019re cold and even if\nyou\u2019re unhappy you don\u2019t do it. And so I was really annoyed. My sort of American side that\nhates when people cheat on line was getting very angry. And then all of a sudden like I had this\nrevelation, wait a second, that\u2019s why they survived. They just do what seems to them the right\nthing to do. And then I loved them because I remembered all these survivors from my\nchildhood. My father\u2019s dead for a long time and I\u2019ve moved away from that world and I just\nloved them and I wanted to kiss all of them. I didn\u2019t leave because I\u2019m not them. But they left\nbecause that\u2019s why they not only survived but they also succeeded after the war in returning to\nnormal life. The vast majority of the survivors are normal, functioning human beings. Even if\nthey\u2019re a bit neurotic, even if they scream a little too much, even if they have more fears than\nyour average person, even if they are way more over-protective of their children, than your\naverage person, even all of those things and even if their children say oh my parents were such\ncrazy people, they are functioning human beings, they are not lunatics. And the ones who are\nwere lunatics anyway. The ones who are were lunatics before the war. This had a searing and\ntraumatic and devastating effect on them but they function as human beings, successful ones for\nthe most part. There are lots of successful business people, successful professionals. All the\nsurvivors I know as children all of them made it. Even if they were just laborers, they still went\nto work in the morning and they still provided for their families. They were fine, they were\nreally fine; crazy but crazy in a way that\u2019s understandable. But anyway so I love them all\nbecause they are what they are. They survived because they have the courage to do what feels\nright at the moment instinctively. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything else I can say at all. This is\nnot about my father\u2019s American experience and that\u2019s of course what I\u2019m most familiar with.\nHe had a good one. He spoke English all the time to my mother. They spoke Yiddish when\nthey didn\u2019t want me to understand which was enough so that I did understand Yiddish. He was\nfiercely proud of being Jewish even if he wouldn\u2019t fast on Yom Kippur because he didn\u2019t\nbelieve in God anymore and he\u2019d gone hungry long enough. But I didn\u2019t know he didn\u2019t fast on\nYom Kippur. He didn\u2019t want me to know that because ......1 mean I\u2019m sure he would have told\nme if I was older, but I was little. I think that\u2019s all I have to say, at least now. If I think of\nsomething in the next ten minutes we can always add it.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome, you\u2019re welcome. Let me add just one last thing. I know this is not going to\ngo into the cards that you\u2019re doing but somehow the transcripts of these will be saved.",
        "A: So Pll just say it. My son is named for my father. I\u2019m named for my father\u2019s mother and he\u2019s\nnamed for my father. And so therefore we have Masha and a Mark and a Marsha and a Mark\nand it\u2019s very nice. And he really feels connected to my father and to the Holocaust. He has\nalways known about it and you asked me if I feel a sense of responsibility and I do. I feel it\nboth in my professional life and in my personal life. And I\u2019m very pleased that I was able to tell\nmy son about the Holocaust in a way like I learned about it, in a very personal way, in a way\nthat emphasizes the goodness in all human beings but it also emphasizes that we should be\ncareful about the evil that human beings are capable of and I feel that as a child of a Holocaust\nsurvivor that I have a moral obligation to purvey the meaning of the Holocaust to the next\ngeneration and I\u2019m glad I was able to do it with my own son. A lot of children of Holocaust\nsurvivors are worried how they will do it and I think it can be done easily, so thank you for\ninterviewing me.",
        "A: I have one more thing to add, I just remembered. When the Nazis occupied Poland in 1939, my\nfather\u2019s wife said to him, escape to the Russian zone, you can do that for a couple of months in\nSeptember, October, November of 1939; you go escape. After all the Germans won\u2019t hurt\nwomen and children but they might hurt men. And my father said well it\u2019s true the Germans\ncertainly won\u2019t hurt women and children because after all his memories, like most Polish Jews.\nHis memories of World War I were that the Russians were the horrible creeps but when the\nGerman army came and occupied Poland the situation of the Jews improved. The Germans\nwere civilized and nice and so forth. So he had a sense that the Germans wouldn\u2019t be so bad\nbut he didn\u2019t want to go to the east because he thought that the Russians would be very barbaric\nand he didn\u2019t want to go to the east. He said the Germans are more civilized than the Russians.\nI will take my chances with the Germans and I don\u2019t want to leave my family alone and so\nforth. So the image of the German was this positive one which of course worked to the\ndetriment of lots of Polish Jews. That\u2019s all I wanted to add...",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome. My father understood that Hitler was a maniac and that the Nazis were evil\nand that they were doing terrible things to the Jews. He understood that. He just thought that\nultimately German decency would prevail whereas the Russians were utterly repulsive and that\nit was at best to stay at home with family and take one\u2019s chances with these Germans than go\noff to Russia.\n"
