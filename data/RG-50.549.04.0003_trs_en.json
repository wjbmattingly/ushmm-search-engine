        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr\ncollection. This is an interview with Esther Dezube and her dog is also in the room,\nconducted by Regina Baier on December 7\", 2000, in Mrs. Dezube\u2019s home in\nBoston. Mrs. Dezube is the daughter of Amalie and Norbert -- Norman Salsitz,\nHolocaust survivors who have been interviewed for the United States Holocaust\npost Holocaust interview project. The US Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully\nacknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. Oh, be quiet.\nThis is tape number one, side A. We are off to a good start here. So as I said, there is\na dog with us in the room, but I think if we put her outside, it would be even louder,\nso hopefully our listeners will understand and even enjoy at times. My first -- my first\nquestion 1s, give us your full name, and when and where you were born.",
        "Answer: My full name is Esther Cylia Salsitz Dezube, and I was born in Newark,\nNew Jersey at Beth Israel Hospital.",
        "Q: Were you named after someone who has been murdered during the war?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What does that mean to you, and what do you know about these people? Can you\nbring them to life a little bit?\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s hard to bring them to life, because I really never met them. But my first\nname is Esther, which is my father\u2019s mother\u2019s name. And I don\u2019t know a lot about\nher. I know a lot more about my father, and how he survived the war, but not so\nmuch about the personality of the mother, or the father, for that matter. My middle\nname is Cylia. That\u2019s after my mother\u2019s sister Cylia. I know a little bit about her. I\nknow all the good qualities about her, and my mother seemed to adore her. I don\u2019t\nknow a lot about her otherwise. And that\u2019s it. I actually -- my kids are named after\nsurvivors as well. And we did one other thing for our children. All their names equal\n18, all the letters. They have 18 letters in their names. And 18 is a very special\nnumber in the Jewish religion, because it means chai, it means life. So we try to\ncontinue that on.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019ll talk about your children a little bit later. I would like to now go back\nto you as a very small child, and to see the first memories of stories, of bits of stories\nthat you now know were related to the Holocaust.",
        "A: I -- I can\u2019t tell you the age, because it was always there. My -- and you can tell a\nlittle bit when they started, because I could see when they started with my older son.\nMy bedtime stories were probably Holocaust stories. My father would sing me\nYiddish songs, I remember that. My mother didn\u2019t read to me at night, my -- it was\nmy father\u2019s -- not job, but that\u2019s what he liked to do. It -- it just didn\u2019t start, it was\nalways there, they always talked about the Holocaust. Their friends were always\nDecember 7, 2000\nHolocaust survivors, they didn't integrate into the American society. So that was\nalways the topic of conversation, I can\u2019t tell you when it started.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s -- 1-1if you can -- I mean, I know it\u2019s really difficult, and especially 1f it\nstarted very early, to remember, but are there bits of stories that you remember that\ncame up at what occasions, how did they talk about it? Is there anything that sort of\ncomes to mind, that gives an impression of what it was. So their father sang to you,\nwhat -- what -- what else?",
        "A: Oh, he would tell me the -- I mean, that\u2019s what he would tell me, he would tell me\nabout Hitler, and -- and -- and children being killed in the war. I think he learned\nactually to temper his stories as he got older. He would tell me, you know, the\nchildren\u2019s fats were made into soap. He would tell me that -- you know, his -- his n-\nnieces and nephews were killed and they were my age. He would say that -- it would\neven start with food. I was a very fat child, and they were very proud of it. They were\nproud that I was fat because they had enough food to give me and children were\nstarving in the Holocaust. That I remember very distinctly, I was not allowed to leave\nthe table without finishing all the food, because the children in the Holocaust were s -\n- would starve, and I should appreciate all that.",
        "Q: They would say that?",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: How did -- how did -- how did you feel, I mean what was your reaction? How\nyoung were you, roughly, that -- I mean, when the father told you, for instance, about\nthe --",
        "A: I could be three. I mean, I was very young when they would s -- tell me these\nstories. You know, I just remember the stories were always there. How, you know, he\nlived in the woods. My mother did not tell me stories. My mother didn\u2019t tell me very\nmuch at all. It was always my father\u2019s stories, how he survived, and how they met,\nand how all the kids were killed. Not my mother. My mother would cry. She would --\nshe would start to tell me these stories, and then she would cry, and I didn't want her\nto cry so I\u2019d always change the subject. I mean, I never let her tell the stories, but --",
        "Q: Did -- did your father make them into stories for children? How -- how do --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- you remember them?",
        "A: No, they were not made for stories for children. They were as gruesome as he\ncould remember them. He would tell me -- he didn\u2019t go through the concentration\ncamps, so he didn\u2019t tell me those kind of stories. He told me how his father was\nkilled in front of him, how his sisters were killed. I knew the story about my\ngrandfather, I can\u2019t tell you what age I -- I knew that he tried to -- my mother\u2019s\nfather, how he escaped, and how he tried to come back and find her. I -- I can\u2019t tell\nyou when these started, but I-I always had these stories.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: Do you remember how you felt when you -- when you heard that? I mean, wa --\nwas it -- was it a -- was it fear, distance, curiosity, wha -- how did it make you feel?\nWhat was your response to --",
        "A: Well, you\u2019ve got to understand something, 1s that one, I was an only child, so I\nhad no one to bounce it off except my parents. Again, my parents really only\nassociated with Holocaust survivors. I didn't know another world. It was the only\nworld that I had. I was not a giggly kid. I never was a giggly kid. The kids used to\nplay with -- I ne -- I didn\u2019t play with dolls very much. I played with maybe trolls,\nlater on in life. Make-believe was very hard for me, because I guess I had a taste of\nreality -- harsh reality first. I wa -- I drew a lot.",
        "Q: What di --",
        "A: I drew animals. I drew animals. I could relate to animals better than I could relate\nto people. I know that. I always drew animals. I have actually even difficulty,\nprobably, drawing people. Again, how did I know it affected me? Only because later\non. When you\u2019re growing up and it -- you really don\u2019t know how it affects you. I just\nthought this was the way in -- in that regard how everybody was. It affected me in\nother ways that I didn\u2019t have a family. It affected me that, you know, I saw my\nfriends with grandparents and stuff like that. But the actual stories? I never heard\nWinnie the Pooh. [ never heard any of these, Snow White. I didn't know.",
        "Q: Did you have friends as -- as a young -- as a younger child? Did you --\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have a lot. I had some friends. I had -- I had some girlfriends, but not a lot,\nbecause in a sense, almost like my older one, I was a little -- I call my youngest kid a\nlittle old man, and I probably was a little old woman. I just couldn\u2019t relate to them. I\ncouldn\u2019t understand the -- the sparkling dresses and the fancy hair and clothes. My\nparents weren\u2019t into that, she never took me to malls. She never did any of these\nthings, so I didn\u2019t. Did I resent it? Only a little, when I was older I resented it, not\nwhen I was young.",
        "Q: Did you make -- did you make a connection to those stories that were told and to\nthe songs sung, to your parents? When -- when did that happen? I mean, did it --\nwere they s-sort of difficult to deal with stories [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, you gotta understand that they were never told to me as stories. I didn\u2019t have\nto take a fairy tale and try to then say oh, I\u2019m going to transfer this fairy tale to\nsomething that happened in real life. These were presented as real life stories, that\nreally happened to them. So I knew it was my parents. I knew it -- that everything\nbelonged to them, that I was part of that history. And they kept telling me I was part\nof that history. That I should be a good Jew, I guess, because I am a -- because I was\nborn, it was their fight against Hitler. I mean, I had to maintain that. That is\nsomething that I was brought up constantly. And I do tell my kids that, a -- a little bit,\nis that because I sur -- I -- I was born, and I survived a Jew, and I maintain it that I\nam victory over Hitler. So this was something that I grew up, all the time.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: That\u2019s a heavy -- pretty heavy burden, potentially, for a smaller child to feel that\nmuch --",
        "A: Probably was.",
        "Q: -- responsibility.",
        "A: I left the house at 16 and a half. I just turned 17 when I left the house.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s -- let\u2019s -- I would like to sort of stay there just for a little bit before\nwe -- we move onto that. Gi-Give me a sense, a little closer sense of what was family\nlife like, the s -- the social occasion. How did you experience th-the home? And did\nyou make comparisons to other homes that you saw, when you visited friends, for\ninstance? Was -- I mean, you said that was a -- sort of the normality, that you feel --\nthat\u2019s what you thought it was. Did you have comparisons to other homes, or -- gi-\ngive us a little better sense of what it was like [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, you gotta understand, everybody has a dysfunctional family as far as I\u2019m\nconcerned, there is no perfect home. I mean, you watch on TV, that\u2019s where you\nmake your comparisons. And you always wanted to be like the family on TV, not so\nmuch like your friend\u2019s family, but the family on TV. Cause they always complained\nabout their parents, too. I didn\u2019t have a close home life. My mother -- I was closer to\nmy mother than my father, only cause my father wasn\u2019t home. My father is a very\ndriven man. Probably is why he survived. But also, he was an immigrant in a country\nand he had to prove himself. So he would get up at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning, which\nDecember 7, 2000\nmeans I\u2019m already in school. He would come back from meetings at 10 o\u2019clock at\nnight, and when I was young I was already in bed. He loved to listen to Yiddish mo --\nmusic, which is not something that I liked. And on the weekends they would go a lot\nwith their friends. I was a tagalong only because they didn\u2019t have a babysitter, and\nthey would speak Polish, which 1s a language that I never learned. So I had to create\nmy own world. I mean, I used to have dinner with my mother. She\u2019d u -- have the --\nshe loves the radio. So either she had music or news in the background. And she\u2019s\nvery political oriented. And so she would always talk all about all the political\nsituations and I had to always be a-abreast about it. And that would be our pul -- our -\n- our life. My parents didn\u2019t really integrate with me. Maybe it\u2019s part of the inte --\nEuropean culture. But we didn\u2019t do -- we went on vacations. We\u2019d travel a lot. We\ndidn\u2019t do a lot as a family, not that I can recall. My mother, again, she wouldn\u2019t take\nme shopping. She laughs at me when I say that. Oh well, you know, I took you on\nthese trips instead of shopping. We didn\u2019t do the normal family stuff. My mother\nliked to read, and that\u2019s what she did. I don\u2019t recall us ever engaging 1n board games.\nI don\u2019t ever a -- we nev -- it was as if they were tired of life. And I couldn\u2019t relate. I\nmean, again, that\u2019s also fantasy. You know, board games and playing with a little\nkid. And they didn\u2019t know how to deal with it.",
        "Q: When I interviewed your parents, and especially your father though, there was\nsuch a -- you called him a driven man?\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: There wa -- there seemed to be, when he talked to me, a great life spark in him\nthough, at the same time. Tired of life, and at the same time very -- seemingly had\nlife --",
        "A: He\u2019s very driven.",
        "Q: It -- it -- try to ex -- to try to -- for listeners who haven\u2019t heard -- who haven\u2019t\nheard the interview with your parents, and from your perspective as a -- as a younger\nperson, because maybe that has changed over the years, how did you see your mother\nand how did you see your father in the earlier years? How -- how were they to you?\nHow did you see them as persons?",
        "A: My mother was reality, my father was fantasy. My mother is not a ha -- in my\nperception is not a happy woman. In a sense kind of bitter, but down to earth. I was\nnever showered with compliments. She may disagree with me, but that\u2019s my\nperception. I -- I always liked to draw and she always felt that that was beneath her as\nan occupation. I was accepted to art school, she was very angry. She said, as a\nvocation, not a -- as an advocation, not vocation. She wanted me to be a doctor, it\nwas it, black and white, you\u2019re a doctor or you\u2019re -- or you\u2019re a failure. She called me\na failure when I was in college.",
        "Q: Do you know why --",
        "A: Yeah, oh --\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: -- it was so important for her to -- that you become a doctor?",
        "A: -- yes, and she explained that to me. She said that a doctor -- and again, this is her\nperception because she was a survivor. A doctor can take their skills and go from one\ncountry to another and start again. And if I wasn\u2019t a doctor I wouldn\u2019t have those\ntransferable skills. And that\u2019s why it was so important, even though math was never a\nstrong point. And it was just not a subject that I excelled in. I was always on the\ndebating team, I was on the speech team. It was very interesting, I mean, when I was\nyoung, that\u2019s where I lean. And you know, yet I agreed to be a pre-med student the\nfreshman year of college. And then I realized it -- I loved taking care of people, but I\ncouldn\u2019t get through the chemistry and the -- the physics and the trigonometry to get\nthere. I mean, if it was just lab work, I got A\u2019s in biology lab work and stuff. So\nthat\u2019s the freshman year of college she called me a failure. But when you have no\nother siblings, y-you have to achieve all the goals that your parent want. And that\u2019s\nwhat they wanted. I mean, they didn\u2019t see me as almost a person, but an extension of\nall their goals. I can see that now. Maybe when I was younger I resented it.",
        "Q: Maybe, or did -- what -- what -- how did you feel when -- ho-how did you feel\nabout yourself at that time, and how did you -- did -- did you have anger? Did you\nhave --",
        "A: I had --",
        "Q: -- compassion, did you have --\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have compassion when I was younger, I have much more compassion\nnow. Confusion, I think was the better idea. I knew enough -- it wasn\u2019t anger. It\u2019s one\nof the reasons I left home, because I didn\u2019t want to have anger, I didn\u2019t want to have\nresentment, and I knew that distance would take care of that. They tried to totally\ndictate -- my mother, not my father -- cause she just was around more -- dictate my\nlife. In a sense I had -- she had to relive her childhood, her concept of a normal\nchildhood through me. If I had boyfriends she would write a script what to say to\nthese boyfriends. She would go through their mail to me, you know, judging them\neither fit or unfit. But yet, you know, she did give me freedom. I -- I dated early. So -\n- but I-I could see that she was more controlling in a way to give herself control over\nlife. She needed control so that she could feel control, because the war didn\u2019t -- not\nlet her have control.",
        "Q: How about your father? He was fantasy, so --",
        "A: He was fantasy. My mother didn\u2019t yell and scream a lot, but she would keep a\ngrudge. She would keep it in her. My father, you can just spark him and he\u2019Il scream\nand rant, but on the most part, it\u2019s done and over with, you know? And you want to\nhide sometimes. I remember going into it -- he would -- he would pick fights, even\nwhen there were fights not even there. We\u2019d go to a store and he would pick a fight\nwith a salesman, or if he didn\u2019t like something a woman said, he would pick a fight.\nBut it would be done. It would fester with my mother. We had a neighbor who was\nDecember 7, 2000\nGerman, and they would always have fights, always have fights. My father would\ntake him to court, or they would -- screaming at each other. But the odd thing is that\nhis oldest daughter was my babysitter. So it was an interesting relationship.",
        "Q: About the other family, did you get to meet his older brother, Leibush, do you\nremember him?",
        "A: No, no, there was a feud in my family. Okay, I don\u2019t know the feud very well. The\nfeud started, I heard, when I was born. From one of my cousins, a first cousin, I heard\nthat my father would -- and my father still is a very generous and giving man. And he\nwas probably very generous and giving to them. And when I was born -- cause they\nhad waited 10 years for me and they were going to adopt, I guess they realized that\nthe fortune, or whatever my father had amassed wasn\u2019t going to go to them, and it\nwas going to go to me. This is what I was told. And there were conflicts and jealousy\nbecause my father made it 1n life and the brothers really didn\u2019t. So I didn't meet them,\nat all. I mean, I never met Leibush at all. I met -- I met David, oh, maybe a couple\nyears before his death. Al I met only once. When I was very small he gave me a book\nby Edgar Allen Poe. Why I remember this I don\u2019t even know. But -- and he was\nvery tall, and I don\u2019t really have any other memories of him.",
        "Q: So you never really had any kind of relationship to the New York part of -- of\nyour fa -- I mean, to the -- to the --\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: To the brothers, no, no. Absolutely no relationship whatsoever. There was a\ncousin named Benny, who was my first cousin, who -- maybe when I got married,\ncame to my father and said, I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m not my father\u2019s son, I want to start having\na relationship back with you. And we became very friendly with him, and I liked\nhim, and -- but they moved to North Carolina and distance has its, you know, way\nof cutting into family ties, so I don\u2019t see him any more. But I have good memories of\nhim later on in life. My father has a first cousin name -- a nephew named Eddie, who\nI have not a re -- really a relationship with at all, but he is friendly to my parents.",
        "Q: What about your mother\u2019s part of the family?",
        "A: They were close. They -- I -- I -- there was a cousin Leo, who -- my parents never\nmade a Passover, which is -- I don\u2019t know if you want me to explain it, but it -- it --\nPassover is the time when the Israelites left Egypt, and they lived in the desert. And\nthe actual name started when God -- after the 10\" -- or the last plague, God said to\nput lamb\u2019s blood on the door of the Israelites, and then he would pass over their\nhouse, and we should retell the story in -- in the -- we call it the Bible, we don\u2019t have\na fir -- a first testament and a second testament. Old Testament and New Testament,\nexcuse me. But your equivalent of -- of the Old Testament, it\u2019s in there, and it says,\nyou shall remember. So that is an very big holiday an-and it\u2019s a unique holiday\nbecause it\u2019s family oriented in the home. You don\u2019t go to temple, necessarily, for\nPassover. So my cousin Leo would always make it, even as a small kid I would go to\nDecember 7, 2000\nhis house. There was a cousin named Harold Anglestone, who is much older, but I\nheard he made the wedding for my parents. We didn\u2019t cup -- keep up with his\nchildren, but I do recall him. I am friendly with Leo\u2019s children, and Leo has a twin\nsister, and I\u2019m friendly with their children. Not extremely close, but definitely\nfriendly with them, they\u2019re come -- we go to each other\u2019s family occasions. But I was\nalways considered the outside -- I always felt like the outsider, even when I went to\nthese occasions.",
        "Q: Why? Or in what way\u201d?",
        "A: Maybe I was al -- I wasn\u2019t so much younger, but I -- I ca -- it\u2019s like they would\ntalk and I would always be in a separate group. I was always considered the outsider.\nOnce I asked them, when I grew up. They said, your mother always said you were\nperfect, and that you, you know, you were always the best and the greatest. And so\nwe really didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with you. And I said, well that\u2019s nice for\nme to know, but I don\u2019t really perceive myself as that.",
        "Q: Why did your parents not want to celebrate Passover?",
        "A: Oh, they wanted to celebrate it, they just never actually -- oh no, they wanted to\ncelebrate it, but just -- they didn\u2019t do it at our house, because it would only be three\nof us. We always went to their house because he knew how to do it and it was a\nfamily situation. My father had only one cousin that was here in America that we\nwere friendly with, that I have memories of, and that is -- he\u2019s a rabbi, Shapiro and\nDecember 7, 2000\nhis wife, Martha. They always tried to include, but they were much more religious --\nalways tried to include us. So I remember going there to Sukkot and some other\nholidays. But I always felt like an intruder.",
        "Q: Because you couldn\u2019t -- also because you --",
        "A: They had many children, it was like there was their family and here I was, alone.\nSo you felt it like an intruder. It was just a different world.",
        "Q: The -- your -- your -- your mother also has family in Israel?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you go often? What kind of relationship did you have with them?",
        "A: My mother had a good relationship with her sister, and still does. In it --",
        "Q: That\u2019s -- that\u2019s the older sister?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The younger sister was killed, whom I was named after. We -- we\u2019d go every two\nyears when I was young, to Israel. Was a big trip. I remember once going on a\npropeller for like 36 hours to Israel. Then we would go on a cruise boat, cause I\ncouldn\u2019t take planes very well when I was young. It was a big deal, but I was much\nyounger than her children, they were 10 years older than me. So I was always, again\nalone. And they would talk Polish. The kids would have nothing to do with me,\nbecause I was so much younger, and I was in my own world.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: What did you do in that own world? What was it like?",
        "A: I turned to art. It was my solace. I drew all of the time. And I was never alone\nwhen I did that.",
        "Q: You never actually had animals though, at that time?",
        "A: Yeah -- no, we had a dog. But my mother\u2019s -- you know, my concept of the dog is\nright now I\u2019m sitting on a bed and the dog is next to me. And my mother\u2019s concept is\nthe dog stays downstairs. Only once did the dog -- was allowed to go upstairs and she\nshredded one of my animals -- he, actually -- because I went to camp. And that was\nlike my favorite animal. He knew which one it was and shredded it. So it was a\ndifferent kind of relationship with animals. I was -- my father loves animals and he\nwould pick up all these strays. And once we had three or four dogs at one time. My\nmother was not too happy. I would pick up stray birds, we had stray rabbits that I\nwould pick up, and I would take care of the animals, too. I always had animals. Part\nof -- my husband laughs that when we got married, you know, the condition was that\nwe had dogs. That was it, we\u2019re going to have dogs, when we could, and we did. But\n-- so art, and -- and dogs. I used to read, also, but not as much as my mother.",
        "Q: What did you read?",

        "A: You know, I was just thinking about when you were saying my father was very\ndynamic, it\u2019s his way of escape. You know, he tells all these stories, but they\u2019re\nmostly in the past, and they\u2019re not the present. He has some, but they\u2019re mostly -- he\nDecember 7, 2000\ndwells totally in the past because he feels comfortable there, and it\u2019s his way to\nescape. If you lock yourself in these stories, if you\u2019re constantly telling the stories,\nit\u2019s like an actor. If he\u2019s in a role, he doesn\u2019t feel his own pain.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did. She said that your father is a ham with other people, and at home he\u2019s\nvery quiet --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- very silent, so that would fit into it -- what --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- what you just said. You said you left home very early. Tell me more about that,\nthe decision to do that, and where did you go?",
        "A: I actually didn\u2019t make that decision. To this day I have no idea how it came about,\nbut it appears when I was in high school, I was put in a program, it was an\naccelerated program that I only had three years of high school, and I went to summer\nschool one summer, and then I went to college early. I don\u2019t know who put me in that\nprogram, I have really absolutely no idea. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it, to be honest, to\nanyone. But I -- I think they basically said that I was too mature to stay in high\nschool and I just didn't fit in, which is an interesting way, I suppose, to put it. And so\nDecember 7, 2000\nI went to college early, and I didn\u2019t apply home. My mother recognized that we were\nstarting to fight, I mean, I was hitting puberty. If I -- if I lived -- college at 16, then\nyou know, puberty starts 14 - 15. I wa -- I was one, in the throes of it, but I don\u2019t\nknow if my mother really knew how to deal with it. One, children weren\u2019t supposed\nto talk against -- back to their parents, weren't supposed to argue with their parents,\nthey were supposed to be little mannequins. My mother always told me how\nwonderful she was. My mother would tell me how -- a good student she was. My\nmother always said how she listened to her parents, and I was not like that. So I guess\nwhat she was doing is trying to avoid, one a fight, and dealing with puberty. And I\nleft home and I only came back one summer, first summer. Because after college\nthey tried to put me, I remember, on a 10 o\u2019clock tur -- curfew, and they didn't want\nme to grow up. They wanted me to go away, but not to grow up. And that was\ndifficult. And I think it was difficult for them, too.",
        "Q: Explain that a little bit more, they wanted you to go away, but not to grow up?",
        "A: Right. Because if I grew up, I came bi -- my own person, which 1s not exactly,\none, the way they saw me, or two, the way they could control me. They -- they -- a --\nthey -- every time we went into a room, the first thing they would do is talk about the\nHolocaust to my friends. First thing. And they would tell the stories. I mean, it was\njust everywhere. My first dates, my first friends, the first thing they came into the\nhouse, they would always -- they would tell the stories. And my friends were scared.\nDecember 7, 2000\nThey just didn\u2019t want to hear them all the time. So one, it limited your friendship, but\ntwo, when i -- you know, they were offended that my friends didn\u2019t want to hear it.\nWhat kind of person are you if your friends don\u2019t want to hear it? They were afraid\nbecause it was a test, also, whether or not I would keep Judaism. And you know, I\nwas away from home. What would I do? You know, I -- I -- I -- I dated people who\nwere non-Jewish, but honest I could say that I would never marry anybody who was\nnot Jewish. It was too much integrated in part of my life.",
        "Q: So what did that mean to you then, to be -- you were so trained to be Jewish, in\ncertain ways, it was -- no, it -- wrong, 1t was so important -- the emphasis was very\n[indecipherable] what does --",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t religious emphasis.",
        "Q: -- that\u2019s -- what [indecipherable] at that time --",
        "A: Yes. My parents did not light candles when I was home. They had ham in the\nhouse. They still have ham in the house. They still have a -- a -- kielbasa and all these\nPolish delicacies. It was a heritage. That\u2019s what it meant to them. They eat bread on\nPassover. I -- I -- I -- I didn\u2019t go to a Jewish day school. I went to Hebrew school. I\nwas not really Bat Mitzvahed. I had a party in Israel, but I never went through the\nformal training of a Bat Mitzvah in th -- in the United States, to this day. They had\nto -- and it was difficult for them, to be religious, with what they went through. I\nDecember 7, 2000\ndon\u2019t know if they hated God, but they were resentful. But they still wanted a\nconnection to heritage, and that they instilled in me very well.",
        "Q: Did that become different for you, though, the religious aspect? Do you --",
        "A: Iam actually more religious than my parents. We -- do you want t -- I mean, I\nnever had a -- a sukkah when I grew up. It\u2019s like a little hut that you put together and\nfor seven days you stay in it, and it\u2019s a harvest festival. We have one. Every year we\nput it together, the kids, we have a dinner, we have a -- friends who come over. I\u2019m\nnot Shomer Shavas, which means that I don\u2019t -- I ride on Shabbat, and go places on\nshab -- on Saturday. But on Friday night all the kids get together and we have our\nFriday night dinner. To the point that my son works as a waiter and told them that he\nwill not work on Friday night because he has to be home for the Friday night dinner.\nWe celebrate the holidays, I change my dishes on Passover, we get rid of all the\nbread, I change the dishes, and we keep it -- actually, that\u2019s kind of an interesting\nstory, because the year that I decided to change the dishes, I had to look for plates.\nAnd I went into this store and there were a set of plates that had Egyptian pyramids\non it, and had the slaves. And I thought that was almost like, you know, God\u2019s telling\nme something. I bought those dishes, and they don\u2019t make them any more. They\ndiscontinued them after the year I bought them. And we still have them. So that way\nI\u2019m much more religious. My kids go to a Jewish day school. Part of it is heritage. A\nDecember 7, 2000\nlot of it is heritage, to be honest. But I\u2019m a lot more religious because I\u2019m not as\nangry with God as they are.",

        "A: Okay.",

        "A: No, I never fit in.",
        "Q: How did you fit into college life? So we are now -- you are now what, 17? Where\ndid you go?",
        "A: I went to Boston University, and my freshman year I probably, using the\nvernacular, blew it. I didn\u2019t do very well in school. I remember I was in a pre-med\nprogram because my parents wanted me in -- to be in a pre-med program. I was a\ngoody two shoes, basically when I grew up, in high school. I never cut. I never did\nanything really wrong. My mother didn\u2019t like my clothes and she would constantly\ntell me how I was inappropriately dressed. But I didn\u2019t do anything really majorly\nwrong. I was in the only kid in driver\u2019s ed when the teacher would say, drive faster.\nAnd here I was in college. I still, I never smoked -- I-I smoked once, cigarettes, when\nI was in law school. I didn\u2019t smoke, didn\u2019t drink, didn\u2019t take drugs, never took\nmarijuana to this day. I didn\u2019t have a need to. But my -- blew my grades. I really\nDecember 7, 2000\nblew my grades. I wanted to have a social life and they don\u2019t mix. And the math was\ndifficult and I didn't probably put an effort in it -- to it, but there was another aspect\nto it. I didn\u2019t want to go in -- I -- I realized that medicine wasn\u2019t for me. If I did well,\nI would have to continue. So I got a D in chemistry. Not that it was difficult, but I\ndid. Can\u2019t go to med school with a D. My parents -- that\u2019s when she called me a\nfailure, and I switched. She didn\u2019t sol -- I don\u2019t think my mother spoke to me for a\ncouple of months. My father did. It was very interesting, my father later on became\nmuch more supportive of what I did.",
        "Q: Wh-Why do you think that is?",
        "A: Cause he was probably a very rebellious r -- youth, and you know, he really -- a\nlittle bit of himself was shining through through me, and I don\u2019t know whe -- he\nprobably smiled and was outraged at the same time.",
        "Q: It\u2019s kind of interesting, I didn\u2019t want to interrupt you, but I did bring the interview\nwith your mother and when I asked her in the very beginning how she would\ndescribe herself before the war, she said this, Amalie Petranker was very happy go\nlucky child with shiny eyes. She couldn\u2019t carry for a long time a grudge or hatred.\nShe loved people, but she was also a fighter, because she was a middle child. So she\nlearned to fight for her rights. She was a little mischievous, she was rebellious, she\nquestioned her parent\u2019s judgment. Did you ever meet that person?\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: No. I didn\u2019t meet that person. Parts of it ve met. My mother questions a lot of\npeople, you know, and -- and their positions on life. No, I can\u2019t see my mother as a\nrebellious person. Maybe she was happy go lucky, but you know, she was much\nolder when I was born. I didn't see that real happy go lucky person. She may have\nbeen when she first got married, but they had a love/hate -- they still have a love/hate\nrelationship. They came from very different worlds. And they\u2019re at each other\u2019s\nthroat for that, even in the way they speak Polish. My mother will correct my father,\ntotally. No, you don\u2019t say it this way, you don\u2019t say it that way. My father had a sixth\ngrade education. He did well, and he was very proud, and he ca -- he hid his report\ncards in the war because he was very proud, but he only went to the sixth grade and it\nhad nothing to do with his ability, 1t had to do with that was the fact of life, he was\nthe youngest child of nine and he had to go work. My mother was educated woman,\nvery proud of her education. And she would let my mo -- father know that she was a\nvery educated woman, and he was not. That would have a problem. My father had a\ngirlfriend named Rozia, who he could never let go. And I heard that they really never\ndated very much, but he was -- she was probably his fantasy of what would have\nbeen. And he let -- he always -- he talks more about, sometimes, Rozia than my\nmother. So that hurts.",

        "A: I switched majors to political science and teaching. And I loved it. And I -- and --\nand I have a teaching degree as well. I did my student teaching in -- in -- in high\nschool government, which was very interesting cause I had the sweathogs. And I had\na great teaching supervisor. And I brought my father in, talked about the war to these\npeople, and about guns and violence. And that was one of the few days that they were\nsilent. Was -- it was -- it was very good. Besides they made the bully of the class the\nleader. He was in charge. Cause maybe they wouldn\u2019t pay attention to me, but they\nweren\u2019t going to cross the bully.",
        "Q: Did you see your father different in that situation?",
        "A: He loves people. Yeah, he shone -- he -- he was shining. He -- he was animate, he\nwas full of life. It\u2019s an odd way to put it, but I think he almost enjoys telling the tales.\nAgain, I think it gives him a sense of purpose. But sometimes he gets choked up, he\ngot choked up at my wedding, he got choked up when he blessed my -- my older son\nat his Bar Mitzvah, but he usually doesn\u2019t get choked up. So, yeah, he liked it. I\nthink maybe he liked the idea that I thought of him, to ask him to come and -- and --\nand speak. Maybe it was an acknowledgement that, you know, I never turned my\nback on the Holocaust, but I don\u2019t live it day in and day out like that. And I know\nthat hurts them. I do. But I didn\u2019t forget it. It\u2019s still part of who I am.",
        "Q: How did the students respond to him?\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: They were silent. They gave him an amazing amount of respect. Probably\nadmiration that he -- he survived and he was a soldier and that he made it, and oh, he\nfought the Germans, or the Nazis. So they respected him, cause a lot of these kids\nwere street kids, and they have a re -- respect of the pecking order. And he was, you\nknow, lieutenant governor of Krakow, and that was pe -- you know, prestigious\nposition. And I hope they walked away from that with some knowledge. We also did\na trial where -- we did a rape trial and I made the boys the victim, and had the women\nof the class on the jury and the judge. I reversed entire roles. And that was interesting\nbecause I\u2019m very attuned to victims.",

        "A: Oh, absolutely. It\u2019s probably the field -- why I chose this -- bec -- became a\nlawyer. Absolutely, I bring my perspective of the victim, I was always for the\nunderdog. Even when I was in high school, they were -- they were called inedgibles,\nthe mentally retarded children in the class, and you know, they were segregated. Not\nDecember 7, 2000\nso much now, but -- I used to be the one to help them, lead them around, or take care\nof them, or be assigned to them. Cause I understood what the underdog was, because\nI never put myself as saying that I was going through the Holocaust, but I wa -- could\nalways associate myself still close to my parents that 1t could happen to me, and that I\nhad to protect other people because of that. That\u2019s very strong, I try to make sure that\nmy kids are survivors, so that if ever it should happen to them, that they could\nsurvive. But I -- and I make them very attuned to that -- or I try, and also very proud\nof who they are, and respect others. Very important to me. But I still keep food\ndownstairs, a little extra food, in case something should happen, my husband laughs\nevery snowstorm, you know, why you stock up like for years? And he doesn\u2019t\nunderstand. I mean, I can explain it to him, but he doesn\u2019t understand. Just this\nmentality that if anything should happen, I am prepared.",

        "Q: Did they know of -- di-did you talk about that at school?",
        "A: I personally, I talk probably more about it now than I did when I grew up, but no.\nBut my parents always talked about it, I didn\u2019t have to, you know? And it\u2019s also --\nand if you have an accent, somebody\u2019s gonna go, where are you from? Even to my\nparents, it\u2019s the first thing out of their mouth. And they\u2019ll say, I\u2019m from Poland, and\nmy father jokes, I\u2019m from, you know, the south -- south Poland. [indecipherable] a\nlittle -- and they\u2019Il -- he\u2019Il say then they\u2019re survivors. So 1t comes out very, very\nquickly, where they\u2019re from. I went back during my college years to Poland. I went\nwith my mother on a trip. And that was an interesting experience.",
        "Q: Because you wanted to go, or because she wanted to go?",
        "A: She wanted to go. Well, she wanted to go because there was a man who helped\nsave her life, his name was Mundek, and I -- he was very ill at the time. And my\nmother said that he was always in love with her. He never married. He\u2019d saved 12\ngirls. And she wanted me to meet him. And so my sophomore year of college I went\nto Poland, and at that time you couldn\u2019t go as a Jewish group to Poland. Didn\u2019t\nexist. You had to go with a Roman Catholic group, led by a priest to Poland. And\nthat\u2019s how we went, and that\u2019s -- it was very interesting because I never told them in\nDecember 7, 2000\nthe group that I was Jewish. I mean, I never brought it up. My mother didn't bring it\nup either. She basically said, you know, let us blend in right now. And I remember\nthe priest took a liking to me, and he always tried to make me go to confession to all\nthese different churches. And I kind of bowed out. And we had one week that we\nwere spending with our friends, with the people that helped save my father, and the\npeople who helped save my mother. But while we were in the tour group, there was\nalso a -- a group, they were the fir -- there was a group of first Christians or\nsomething like that, they were from Ohio, and they don\u2019t cross themselves either,\nand they don\u2019t go into confession. So I kind of said I -- I can\u2019t do that, or whatever.\nAnd he had no clue that I was Jewish, none. And there was a woman there who right\naway everybody knew she was Jewish. She also had a -- she was from Auschwitz, so\nshe had the symbol. But even before, they kind of knew. They used to tell Jewish\njokes on the bus, and they still made fun of Jews. Hardly any Jews in Poland at the\ntime and they still made fun of us. And I -- and I knew then how my mother felt. I\nused to wear a Moses holding the 10 commandments. I wore it on the inside. It was\nvery interesting. Then we spent a week with the families. And I met Mundek, but we\ncouldn\u2019t talk to each other. But he was if -- there was like a light in his eyes. He was\na very interesting, very nice man. But I spent -- we stayed at the house that -- of the\nwoman who saved my father, because she had a house in Warsaw. And she had two\nchildren my age. We couldn't speak very well, but they all kind of -- if they knew that\nDecember 7, 2000\nI was Jewish, it was just never brought up. Holocaust was never brought up, never\ndiscussed it. There was a language barrier. But there was one boy who came over\nwho did bring it up. And -- and we liked each other. And I said to him, by the way,\ndo you know that I was Jewish? I had to tell him, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- something\ncompelled me that I had to tell him who I was. And he said to me, we\u2019re all children\nof Moses. But he was the only one of the group who went to the university. So it was\nvery different, but I felt very strange there. You know, you would o -- go with other\npe -- I would not -- I mean, he knew I was Jewish. And of course, I thought the other\nchildren knew because of what their parents told them. But it\u2019s just not -- I was told\nin some parties not to bring it up. And then we went, you know, to see my father\u2019s\nhouse. And I felt -- then I felt anger, because I couldn\u2019t -- here was my father\u2019s\nhouse, that didn\u2019t belong to him any more, that was taken from him, and I wanted to\ngo up to these people and say, this is my heritage. My mother told me, you know,\nobviously, not to do that, not to bring it up, not even to mention we went to a\nrestaurant to have tea. No one questioned my mother, whether she was Jewish, no\none thought about it, and I guess I don\u2019t look that Jewish. It was not imprinted across\nmy forehead. But at the end of the trip was the most interesting part because I sat\nnext to the priest on one of the planes. And I showed -- he said, where do you go to\nschool, and I said I went to BU, and on my I.D. was the Jewish star. And he looked at\nthat, and you could see his eyes were widening, and he turned around, and he said,\nDecember 7, 2000\n\u201cThat -- that looks like a Jewish star.\u201d I said, \u201cIt is.\u201d He said, \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d And\nI said, \u201cI am.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, I like you anyway.\u201d And I think to him, he\nthought he was giving me a compliment. But, you know, there are two ways to\napproach those kind of people, yell and screaming, butt your heads, not get\nanywhere. Shake your head, and be polite. Show them that you can be better than\nthey. And then other ways, press your point. And I -- and I think that\u2019s the way that I\nusually do it.",
        "Q: When was that trip, roughly?",
        "A: \u00b075. 1975.",
        "Q: Have you ever gone back?",
        "A: Since \u201975?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No, I went to Auschwitz then, too. The trip was -- that was also very strange. We\nwent to Auschwitz, but again remember, we went with a Catholic group. And now\nthey have tours and say Jews died there. When we went there, they didn't tell us Jews\ndied there. The official tour was that many people died there, period. Not one word\nthat Jews died there. But you could see that -- the fingernails in the wall -- in the\ncement walls. You can see imbedded lines that match fingernails in -- in the gas\nchambers. And you just have a chill. I mean, you know, there\u2019s just a silence and a\nchill. And that\u2019s -- you know, you realize that it will never hap -- you\u2019re not going to\nDecember 7, 2000\nlet it happen again. But that\u2019s something for the perspective, versus dwelling on the\npast.",
        "Q: What was your mother\u2019s response to that -- da -- ha -- and what -- what was your\nrelationship to each other at that time?",
        "A: We were close. That was probably one trip that we were quite close. I probably\nwas not a very warm child. My mother wasn\u2019t that warm either, I mean, she would\nhold my hand, and -- and stuff like that, and I didn't want her to hold my hand cause I\nthought that was not the right thing to do, you know, women holding hands together.\nBut she would never come and hug and cuddle and kiss me. And I in turn was not a\nhuggy, cuddly person either. I\u2019m much more with my children. But we were close. I\nthink that we did hold hands then. It was almost like the world against us, except for\nthese people that we stayed with. It tends to bind you.",

This woman stepped on a bug, and got upset cause she was\na vegetarian, and -- and my mother said, well, that\u2019s how they used to crush children\nin the Holocaust. You know, there was a moment of silence after that, what do you\ndo? It\u2019s a very awkward pause. But that\u2019s -- and -- and they never saw that it would\nbe an awkward pause cause they had to keep telling. You know, some don\u2019t tell,\nsome don\u2019t let go.

And I promised, in a sense, I\nwouldn\u2019t go back to your childhood, but I would like to ask you one more question.\nDid your parents ever -- how did they respond to sort of the trivial childhood\nproblems that you must have had? The little problems that loom incredibly large. Did\nthat have any meaning? Could they relate to that at all?",
        "A: No, they couldn\u2019t relate to it at all. They had no patience for it whatsoever.\nBasically they looked at me as -- they wanted to 1g-ignore that it even existed. You\nknow, I was studying that the Pilgrims used to dress up their children in adult clothes,\nbecause they didn\u2019t realize children were children, didn't want them to be children,\nbut to be miniature adults. And I think that\u2019s what they wanted me to be, a miniature\nadult. I mean, they -- I think my father took pride in -- in that I was a little girl, but\nno, I don\u2019t think they could deal with the trivial problems of growing up very much.\nIt -- because, to them, they always compared it to the war, and it was so trivial to the\nwar that how could you even be bothered, you know, by acne, or how could you be\nbothered with the fact that you\u2019re heavy, until later on, finally I went on a diet,\nbecause I wanted to. And they still tried to push food on me. I mean, how could you,\nyou know, be bothered by these things, kin -- in comparison to what happened to us\nduring the war?\nDecember 7, 2000",

Once we got to the countries, she\u2019s perfectly happy reading in a\nhotel room. And my father I would explore. That was the time that my father and I\nreally got to know each other. I remember in Paris my mother stayed in the hotel\nroom, we went to the art colony, we went all around. But when we traveled, as if we\nwere removed from the daily pressures of everyday life, that there was much more\ncasualness. When we went on cruises, much more casual.",

So it was really difficult, we -- we talked about that. But -- but still,\nwas it important for you to meet, at least a larger -- to have a sense of a larger family\nthere in flesh and blood if you will, was that important since you didn\u2019t have\ngrandmothers, grandfathers in -- in New York? Did that give you a different feeling\nof relatedness in terms of family?",
        "A: To be honest, no. It was important that there was a state of Israel. It was -- 1t was\nimportant that I had a place to go. It was important that it existed and it thrived.

I -- it may\nsound like a -- a strange, opposite approach to it, but it\u2019s extremely important to me.\nAnd it was comforting that they were there, but not that it was a bigger picture and\nthat I had some family.

        "A: One, I believe that my mother had this all prearranged in many respects. But I met\nhim at 14, we -- he belonged to a youth group called USY, United Synagogue Youth,\nand I belonged to that youth group. I was active in the Jewish movement, I was --\nDecember 7, 2000\nwas president of that group, of my chapter. And we met at a dance, a friendship\ndance, and we were supposed to give each other keys. I went with another boy, he\nwent with another girl. Yet, he gave me the key. And I didn\u2019t date him after that,\neither. We were just good friends for many, many years. I knew his girlfriends, he\nknew my boyfriends. We had a lot in common. We\u2019re not very similar in personality,\nbut we had common ground.",
        "Q: Like what?",
        "A: Judai -- he came from a family was not religious. He is, I think, fourth generation,\non one side, American. Israel was very important to him, it was important to me.\nJudaism was important to him, it was important to me. Stability. I crave stability.\nAnd he was a very stable person. Regretfully, he isn\u2019t emotional at all, or romantic,\nor nothing, he\u2019s just not. Maybe if I was -- hindsight is hindsight, but he is a very\nstable person. He\u2019s a kind person. And he got along with my parents, my parents\nliked him. He would listen to their stories. And he used to like to fix things and my\nfather liked to fix things, so that he fit in our family. I don\u2019t have an easy family to fit\ninto. So that was a positive sign. Has it develop -- it developed when I came back\nfrom Poland, and I -- I went to Israel for a winter vacation, and he had taken a year\nin Israel. So we met there, and I still was not the apple of his eye, his bicycle was.\nHe toured Israel all over with his bicycle, and went through Europe all over with\nthis bicycle. He was more interested in the condition of his bicycle than I. But when\nDecember 7, 2000\nhe came back, it was a very hard decision for both of us, because we were always\ngood friends, and once you go past good friends, into a different kind of relationship,\nyou can\u2019t go back. So we had to decide whether we were willing to risk it. We were\nboth very young. And -- and my parents pushed us into marriage, I\u2019m positive. Cause\nwe -- I got married three weeks after I graduated c-college. I didn\u2019t plan my wedding,\nmy mother planned my wedding. I didn\u2019t even get to pick my dress. She kind of\npicked my dress, and I wanted to change it, and she kept saying no, no, so I think I\nchanged it a little bit. I think I picked the colors, that\u2019s about it. I walked into the\nwedding and everything was done. We were young, I was 20 years old when I got\nmarried. And we grew together. And I must admit, he\u2019s much more stable and I\u2019m\nmuch more volatile. I mean, you know, a lot of times I\u2019d say, I can\u2019t take this any\nmore, you know, go away from me. And he\u2019Il be the one say, no, we gotta work this\nout, calm me down. But we had that bond of Judaism, and of our heritage, which was\na very strong bond. He wanted a ki -- he wanted the kids to go to Schecter. It\u2019s very\nimportant to him. He still goes to Israeli book clubs.",
        "Q: What about wanting kids, was that important to both of you?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",

The kids, the dog, and a house with white\nDecember 7, 2000\nbricks, he keeps joking. And that\u2019s why he tells me I always get my way. Kids were\nvery important to both of us. Continuation of our heritage. I basically raised the\nchildren. He\u2019ll concede to that, I think, because he\u2019s gone a lot. He does a lot of\nresearch, he used to do a lot of moonlighting, more -- only this year he stopped the\nmoonlighting. He wanted children so badly that I had just finished law school -- we\nwere married still when we were in grad school together. He was -- I was up here, I\nbrought him up here, I liked Boston. I didn\u2019t want to return to New Jersey, I felt\nthere was nothing there. Except my parents there was nothing there. So I -- I went to\nlaw school, he went to Harvard graduate school. Then I -- then he went to med\nschool. And I took the bar, and I w -- said, we\u2019re not moving. But when he was an\nintern, he wanted a child. I don\u2019t know why, he wanted a child very badly. And I kept\nsaying look, you\u2019re not going to be around. But he really wanted a child, I conceded.\nWe had a child. And he was gone all the time, so I have a very close relationship with\nmy older son, who has a difficult relationship with my husband. But it was very\nimportant for us to keep up Judaism. He\u2019s very proud of my parents. He can handle\nthem very well. Sometimes better than I can.",
        "Q: He can handle them well, or he relates to them?",
        "A: Both. I don\u2019t know if he relates to them, but he can definitely handle them very\nwell. He\u2019s willing to listen. Sometimes I get irritated because I\u2019ve heard it so many\nDecember 7, 2000\ntimes. But he has that kind of patience. But he\u2019|l -- he\u2019II listen to them. He\u2019ll let them\nvent. I let them vent now, too. But I think in that way it\u2019s a good match.",

I wanted somebody to care about me. My parents had\n-- care about me a lot, but in a different way. And I wanted a family. So that was\nreally important, and he wanted that, so it wasn\u2019t that hard. I\u2019m a strong willed\nperson, but I do give in a lot. I don\u2019t argue as much. Bruce says I -- I win all the\narguments, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s all that true. If there\u2019s -- if the both of us are in the\nroom, Bruce will talk a lot more than I do.

        "Q: What is he?",
        "A: He\u2019s an AIDS oncologist. And I know that he chose to go into AIDS when it\nwasn\u2019t popular. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s still popular, but he had to fight a lot of battles.\nWhy in the world would a straight person want to deal with these type of people?\nAnd that\u2019s basically what they used to say. And he said that the hol -- that the Jews\nwere viewed that way too, and if we don\u2019t stand up for these people, who would sta -\n- who stood up for the Jews? We have to stand up for these people so that doesn\u2019t\nhappen again. And that\u2019s why he went into that field. And I\u2019ve had to write many\nletters to the hospitals that tried to take his -- his room away, and all sorts of\nDecember 7, 2000\ninteresting dynamics. But he fought on and he wrote [indecipherable], and he do --\nhe loves his field. Does research and sees patients too, at the same time. And I went\ninto plaintiff law. I never in my life considered being defense, ever. Because the\nplaintiff was always the underdog. I never considered -- there\u2019s many different areas\nof trial law, corporate law, or my father wanted me to be a real estate lawyer. Just\nwasn\u2019t for me cause it didn\u2019t involve dealing with people, and protecting victim\u2019s\nrights. That was important to me that I protect them against -- and I -- and I view the\ninsurance companies as people who -- or companies who take advantage of people.\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t let that happen to me, it would go against my grain. So when I try a\ncase, a little [indecipherable] of that is in me. It makes it easier when you try a case\nthat way.

And also, I guess, the European way is -- is that again, kids probably\nwere in playpens, and that\u2019s how she was brought -- she was brought up she had a\nDecember 7, 2000\nmaid, so I had a maid til I was three. She didn\u2019t -- I mean, she would take pride in the\nfact that she used to bathe me.

        "Q: Describe your three sons a little bit to me, and also you mentioned in the\nbeginning the names, so you chose to name them after --",
        "A: Yes. Dustin, now we have English and Hebrew names too. So Dustin\u2019s is -- 1s -- I\nmean, you say Dustin\u2019s not a very Jewish name. It\u2019s a German name, it means\nvictorious, or -- going back, but his name is Dustin Isaac, and he his Hebrew name is\nDavid Itzhak, or David Isaac. David was a -- after my mother\u2019s father, and Isaac\nwas after my father\u2019s father. You know, that was one thing I must say for my\nhusband is, I mean, obviously he had a family too. And he didn\u2019t object that I named\nthem after my side of the family. He kind of understood that it was important to keep\ntheir names alive. And I credit him for that. And 18 is something they do in their\nDecember 7, 2000\nfamily. And I felt 1t was just a wonderful idea, so that I incorporated it, some of --\nlike the spelling of Isaac is a little off, but it\u2019s 18. Aaron Richard, and then his\nHebrew name is Aaron Raphael. Aaron 1s after his grandfather, but even my\nparents liked his grandfather, and I don\u2019t th -- and he had just died, so it actually fit in\nvery well, but Raphael is -- is after Rachel, my father\u2019s sister. Richard. And\nMichael -- actually we had a little problem with Michael\u2019s name, my mother wanted\nFrederick, and I just couldn\u2019t see naming my child Frederick. Now, we thought\neven Forest, they told me they wouldn\u2019t even call him by name if he -- his name was\nForest. They call my son, by the way, instead of Dustin, Dodson, on purpose cause\nthey didn\u2019t like the name. But so Michael was actually my idea cause my father has a\nsister named Malchia, and Fried is Frieda, but it\u2019s spelled a little different. And his\nHebrew name is Simcha Meloch, which is actually -- the translation is happy king.\nAnd that was their Hebrew names. So it\u2019s interesting in school they dwell a lot on\nhow you got your name. Ev -- almost every year they ask the kids how they got their\nname, and they\u2019re supposed to write a report about their heritage. And they\u2019re kind of\nproud. At first Dustin wasn\u2019t proud of Dustin, didn\u2019t like 1t as much. But now\nthey\u2019re -- they\u2019re -- they\u2019re proud of how they got their names. They don\u2019t know\nthese people very well. My father did write when they were born, about the parents\nwho their named after. But -- so that was important, to keep that going.",

        "A: Yes, I did. But I didn\u2019t -- you know, I read their books, but they would test me on\ntheir books. You know, did you read this, and -- and if I -- and if I got one thing\nmisquoted they would correct me, and why didn\u2019t you remember this, and why didn\u2019t\nyou remember that. And they do it with my kids, too. And I have at least the\ntemperance of years behind me, my kids are not diplomatic. So, you know, yes, I\u2019ve\nread their books, but 1-1t was -- it\u2019s sometimes a little difficult. I wanted to read it to\nunderstand it, enjoy it, not to necessarily be tested on it.

Because that really shows a lot of him, more than a lot of what\nthe situation made of them. So yeah, I read the books. My oldest son has read the\nbooks. My middle son has read one of the books, and my youngest son has read a\nlittle bit. It\u2019s difficult with him because he just hates to read.",

        "A: It\u2019s strained. All of -- for all three kids it\u2019s still strained. But they\u2019re closest with\nDustin. One, he was the first.

He\u2019s the oldest, that he should, you know, have this kind of\nprivilege. And I would look at her and say, but you used to complain about it. But it\u2019s\ndifferent. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s different, but it\u2019s different. I try not to do that to\nthem. I-It\u2019s strained because they would love for them to sit there and look at them\nadoringly and suck up everything they have to say. My father started telling the\nHolocaust stories to my son when he was three years old.",

        "A: Yeah. So that\u2019s why I think he started with me at three -- until we put a stop to it.\nHe would have nightmares. My older son is a very sensitive child, and I -- I think it\nwarped him in some ways. He didn't do it with the younger two. We really -- I says,\nyou can tell them you were a soldier, you can tell them that bad things happened to\nchildren, but not the gory details, and he went to the gory details with Dustin. In one\nway, he relates to them better for that. In another way I think that he\u2019s a little\nsaddened in life by it. The younger two he -- he -- because we wouldn\u2019t let him,\nbasically. He still tells the stories, but a much more -- not -- not a positive spin, but in\nthe beginning it was a positive spin, you know. I was a soldier, I survived, I -- against\nthe bad guys and the Hitler and -- and so they don\u2019t relate as close. Now he\u2019s\nbeginning to tell them more of the atrocities, but they don\u2019t want to hear it. See, my\nson -- my older son is willing to hear it, but the r -- the younger two are not. They\u2019re\nDecember 7, 2000\njust not. And it hurts them tremendously. I\u2019m the bridge. They can\u2019t relate to it as\nmuch. They\u2019re very proud of them. My father, you know, th-the -- that he survived\nthe war. They\u2019re ba -- proud of both of them, but they don\u2019t want to hear the constant\ntales of woe. My youngest one when he\u2019s older probably will be more attuned to it,\nmy middle one, no. He won\u2019t hear it. And they resent him for that.",

        "A: Once I was hit with the belt. Most of the time they would either take -- a-and\nwhen I was older, I had Barbie\u2019s, they would put them in the attic, they would give\nthem away. I had -- once had a Shirley Temple doll that my mother just shattered\nwhen I was bad, she was mad at me for something. I don\u2019t recall what I did, but she\nwas mad at me and totally shattered it, broke it. It was more the isolation treatment.\nYou know, they wouldn\u2019t talk to me. Or at -- my mother has this look that you just\nknow she doesn\u2019t approve. And she would keep looking at you like that. There would\nbe yelling. I don\u2019t think I was -- except for that one time that I really remember, I\ndon\u2019t know if I was ever really physically punished after that. I was slap -- my\nmother would -- yeah, she -- and I -- and I did do that when it was in the beginning,\nbut I\u2019ve stopped that, she would take my arm and pinch it. That she would do. How\ndo I reprimand my kids? God, I tried the whole gambit. I have three very strong\nwilled child -- children and I have, you know, children who have ADHD. So they\u2019re\na little -- sometimes a little more trying. I would slap their hands. I would slap their\nhands. But I\u2019d warn them. Kind of say, Pll give you -- and I used the word Hebrew\nmakkah, because I didn\u2019t want everybody to know what I was going to do. So they\nknow what that word is, actually. And it\u2019s, I'll give you makkah if you don\u2019t -- so\nsometimes they\u2019d even give me the hand. Once I slapped Dustin, I think, in the face,\nhe did something that was just so rude. Slap on the hand mo -- and then -- then we\ntried this method called time out, which worked, because he knew I was serious, I\u2019d\nDecember 7, 2000\ngive him time out in the restaurant. Put him in a corner. It\u2019s called one, two, three\ntime out. And they still know it. All I have to do is show them my fingers, I\u2019m\npointing one finger, two finger, three fingers and they knew I meant time out. It\u2019s a\nlittle hard when the oldest one is 18. Now his method is I take his car keys. But that\u2019s\n-- that\u2019s how I do it. That\u2019s my punishment.",
        "Q: How did -- how did you relate -- or how do you relate to your husband\u2019s family?\nIs that a good relationship?",
        "A: My husband isn\u2019t close to his own family, so it makes it much easier. He\u2019s okay --\nmy husband isn\u2019t a close, warm kind of person, though his mother tries in -- in -- on\nher behalf, I must admit, her mother tries to keep the family together. His father\u2019s\ndead. His father was a very kind, gentle man who was a hermit. He would sit on the\ncouch, you have no clue he was there. But he was very fair. You know, when he had\nsomething to say he would say it, but he was fair. I get along with his mother, but his\nmother likes to talk about his mother. I mean, it\u2019s interesting when I go to her house,\nshe\u2019s very nice, she\u2019ll give me care packages, she\u2019!l send things and she tries. But\nwhen the kids are there, she doesn\u2019t interact with the kids. That happened with my\nparents too, cause they didn\u2019t know how to interact with them. And I remember very\nclearly, Dustin was four years old and told my mother off. I would never dream of\ntelling my mother off, but he told my mother off. She was mad at me that I brought\nup my son that way, by the way.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: And what was it -- what was the situation [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, I remember it very clearly.

        "A: I like myself better now than I did then. Didn\u2019t like myself that much. I always\nsaw myself as ugly. Fat, which is probably accurate. Not as much self confidence. I\nwas willing to take a lot more crap, probably, than I am now.",
        "Q: Did you ever see a psychologist or something, or was that something you would\nnever do?",
        "A: No, I would -- when I was -- I saw a psychologist once or twice. I remember once,\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember the story, I took a knife out of a -- out of the drawer\nand said I would kill myself. My mother made me see a psychologist and I s -- the\nDecember 7, 2000\npsychologist said, she was just acting out, there\u2019s no issue in there.

My kids see a\npsychologist, we have a family psychologist now. And we, you know, try -- with my\nhusband sometimes we need to work on our -- we come from different backgrounds,\ndifferent viewpoints in life, and if we\u2019re going to make this marriage work,\nsometimes we need a mediator. So I have no objections about seeing a psychologist.

I -- I don\u2019t think my father really takes care of\nhimself, knowing a lot more about my kids, and the fact that they do have ADHD.\nIt\u2019s genetic, and I\u2019m positive my father has it. He\u2019s been diagnosed, I think, bipolar.\nThat -- I do see a lot of that in them and I think if he had gotten help younger, it -- he\nwould have been a lot better for it. But he doesn\u2019t want help in that regard. And it\u2019s\njust like my middle son, you have to acknowledge that there\u2019s an issue in order to get\nhelp. It\u2019s a difficult thing to do.",
        "Q: I think in the late 60\u2019s, or even a little earlier, sort of studies about Holocaust\nsurvivors came out, psychological studies, did you ever read those?\nDecember 7, 2000",

And it\u2019s not that\nI turn my back on the Holocaust, because I don\u2019t. I tell my kids about it. I am proud\nthat my parents are survivors. I am proud in a lot of things that they instill me, and I\ntry -- I tell my kids that. They know that my father is a holo -- they\u2019re very proud of\nhim, like I said, in many ways. But I can\u2019t live it, eat it and breathe it like they do.\nAnd on top of it, I have three tough cookies of kids. I don\u2019t have the time. You have\nto give something up. And where my father probably would not think of anything of -\n- you know, running here and there, and meetings and not really raising me because\nthat\u2019s what he did, I can\u2019t do that. And he doesn\u2019t understand that.",

        "Q: Well actually, the -- the -- the last question was not so much about your -- the\nsurvivors, but about the children of the survivors, whether you kind of -- if you read\nbooks about the second generation, whether you were interested in it, first of all, to\nread those, and if you did, did you find yourself in them, or do you feel that you don\u2019t\nquite fit there either? Is --",
        "A: No, I haven\u2019t read it so much, but it\u2019s very interesting is that you know who\nanother child survivor is. If I walk in the room I can tell, and they can tell. I can\u2019t\nexplain it.",
        "Q: Try.",
        "A: It\u2019s like when I went to a Schecter meeting and there was another woman there\nand we talked. And I found out she was a survivor -- a child survivor, and we just\nknew that each other were child survivors, it\u2019s some -- maybe our outlook on life.\nWe\u2019re a little more serious, maybe. Probably a little more warped. Family, I think,\nDecember 7, 2000\nfor child survivors are very important. I find that is a unifying fact in every one of the\nchild survivors that I\u2019ve met. There\u2019s this woman now from Israel, that we met\nthrough another family, child surviv -- you know, survivor, and we\u2019re -- we\u2019re close,\nit just -- I know what you\u2019ve gone through, I know the stories that you\u2019ve gone\nthrough. I know that, you know, your parents always say that, you know, we didn\u2019t\nhave this and you do. And we\u2019re doing all this for you cause we have no one else.\nYou just know. And you know that either you\u2019re going to resent your parents for it,\nor you try to deal with it. I don\u2019t resent them for who they are. Maybe when I was\nyounger a little bit. I can understand that they went through hell, and that I\u2019m just\ngoing to have to be accepting of who they are. I\u2019m not going to be able to change\nthem. You know, for many years you try to change somebody, and you realize you\ncan\u2019t do that. So you either respect them, or you distance yourself, or you want to\nhave nothing to do with them, those are the three choices. When you don\u2019t have a\nfamily, that\u2019s not an option. They\u2019re the only things that I have to a family, so it\u2019s\njust not an option. And so that\u2019s why I keep telling my kids, this is all we have. We\ndon\u2019t have anybody else. You have to stand up for each other. You have to stick\ntogether. That kind of bonding I\u2019m not sure is in a regular family. Everybody else is\ndoing their own thing and not -- I tell the brothers, you better protect each other. Who\nelse do you have? You know, you better understand, you may not like what\n[indecipherable] have to do. They come in and my father will scream at them,\nDecember 7, 2000\nthey\u2019re not wearing socks. And they say, we\u2019re not cold. And that we\u2019re bad children\nbecause we don\u2019t tell our kids to wear socks when they command it. But I tell them,\nyou know, you have to understand from where they\u2019re coming from. Put yourselves\nin their shoes. I don\u2019t know whether or not if you\u2019re not a survi -- child survivor that\nyou can understand that. Or if you\u2019re not gone through that kind of generation, I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Among your friends, are there any children of survivors?",
        "A: No. Except for that one friend who 1s Israeli, yes. I -- I -- like I belong to a group\nof -- Havurah group, no, none of them.",
        "Q: Conscious choice or happenstance, or who knows?",
        "A: I think it was more happenstance. I mean I am friendly with this woman who is a\nsurvivor, but part of it subconsciously could be I still want -- I want to be an\nAmerican. I want to fit in. I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m co -- more closely to a lin --\naligned to these people be-because they\u2019re Americans, but you know, if you also\nassociate with survivors, you tend to bring it up a lot more. That means you\u2019re\nreliving it and reliving it and reliving it. And I don\u2019t want to do that. When the\narticles come out on my parents, I\u2019m proud, I-I show them to my kids, and they read\nthem. The little one is proud because his father is famo -- grandfather, you know, 1s\nfamous, he looks at it that way, and you know -- my father goes, well, that\u2019s not a\ngood enough reason. I said, let him bond that way. When he\u2019s older he can develop\nDecember 7, 2000\nother -- a-and Dustin is much more respective of my parents now as he\u2019s older and\nunderstands more. So I see that the time is coming. They don\u2019t see that. They had no\nparents. They had no parents who ever butt into their lives, so they don\u2019t understand\nwhen or when not to butt into our lives. They just never had any mentors. So -- a-and\nthat\u2019s why we sent them to Schecter, to be proud of their heritage, of who they are.\nAnd again, to make sure that it won\u2019t happen again to them. And I think they see that.\nI mean, my -- my middle one will go into a restaurant, very -- very -- and say, hey,\nthere\u2019s Christmas stuff, but there\u2019s no Hanukkah stuff, why? I don\u2019t think an\nAmerican kid would really pay attention to that. So it has sunk in a little bit, you\nknow? I mean, maybe not the way that my parents -- but he\u2019s very proud of who he\nis. He\u2019s very proud that he\u2019s Jewish. It was difficult cause my oldest son was dating a\nnon-Jew. I think my mother was much more willing to see -- let\u2019s wait and see, my\nfather went -- still goes bananas over it. Absolutely goes banana -- has major battles\nwith my son.",
        "Q: How do you feel about that?",
        "A: I -- if it\u2019s on tape and they marry I\u2019m in trouble, but I don\u2019t like her, because I\ndon\u2019t like her. I don\u2019t like her personality. He knows that I would be very upset if he\nmarried a non-Jew and wouldn\u2019t bring the children up Jewish. I would -- 1-1f the -- if\nthe person would convert, I don\u2019t have an issue. I don\u2019t. Then they\u2019re as good as\nanyone else. Because I think part of our heritage would be lost. And I -- and I am\nDecember 7, 2000\nvery close to that. I mean, my son\u2019s Bar Mitzvahs -- you know, when you have a kid\nwho lives in an affluent society and he\u2019s having a Bar Mitzvah, it\u2019s very difficult to\nhave him not focused on what gifts I\u2019m going to get, versus, do you understand what\nthis mean? That this 1s a tradition that you are perpetuating over thousands of years.\nThat if you\u2019re not proud of who you are as a Jew, people will step on you. Maybe an\nAmerican doesn\u2019t understand that. And I look. If somebody\u2019s talking about Jews, or\nsaying something and I hear it in the background, I'll speak up. I\u2019m very proud of\nthis person, his name is Lenny Zakim. He died of a brain tumor last year, he was 47\n-- t-two years ago, almost. They\u2019re actually debating to name a -- the new bridge in\nBoston after him. He was part of the ADL, and he went to law school with me\n[indecipherable] was -- he was a year ahead. I wasn\u2019t socially -- we were not on\nsocial basis, but we always used to say hello to each other from the same law school.\nAnd he would really go around, and make sure about anti-Semitism and stuff. But it\nwas only -- not only anti-Semitism, it was anti blacks, anti anybody who had issues.\nAnd I think I\u2019m instilling that in my kids, about discrimination. That\u2019s a product of\nthe Holocaust. It\u2019s not only discrimination that you\u2019re Jewish, and believe me, I\u2019ve\nhad some anti-Semitism, I haven\u2019t had a lot. My kids haven\u2019t had so much, so they\ndon\u2019t know yet what it is, but they will, and I want them to be prepared for it.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: I just have actually a -- a couple of follow up questions. Otherwise, I think we\nhave touched on a lot of important things. And one is a very practical one. I forgot to\nask you when, just for the record, when your children were born.",
        "A: Dustin was born March 11, 1983. Aaron was born December 17\", 1987, and\nMichael was born February 28\", 1990. I have to say one thing is though, I\u2019ve had\nmany miscarriages. That\u2019s why I have the big gap between the oldest and the middle.\nAnd because I really wanted a family, I never gave up. I had eight miscarriages -- no\n-- yeah, eight miscarriages, three live births. And I think part of that keeping me\ngoing, although I would get almost hives when I would go into the op -- the -- the --\nthe gynecologist\u2019s office was that I really wanted a family th -- to perpetuate our\nheritage. That was very important to me. So I just didn\u2019t give up. And they know\nthat. I mean, I sing Shema to them every night, and even my s -- oldest one still asks\nfor that. To understand, you know, that this is where it\u2019s coming from. I don\u2019t know -\n- Shema is an affirmation of one God, but it\u2019s also supposed to be said as the last\nthing on your mouth before death. And then, just you know, make sure that they\nunderstand that.",
        "Q: One other question until I remember another one, is sort of political. You have\ngone through, in your teens actually, Civil Rights movement, Women\u2019s movement,\nall of these things kind of are also part of who you are to some degree at least. To\nDecember 7, 2000\nwhat kind of degree? What -- what -- what moved you, politically speaking? What\nwas important to you?",
        "A: Justice. I was for the Women\u2019s movement for equality and for justice. I don\u2019t go\nover backwards on it. I mean, I don\u2019t want any more rights, but I want to be\nrespected. I am -- I\u2019ve dealt with that personally. I was a women\u2019s lawyer where they\nwere just starting to have women lawyers. I mean, there were men in my class, but\nthe older men didn\u2019t have women in their classes. I was called deary during trials.\nAnd -- and -- and my theory in life, as I handle almost everything with that one is\nsomebody goes -- this one woman that was just outraged that he was calling me\ndeary, aren\u2019t you going to say anything to him? And I said, no, because I\u2019m not going\nto change him. But if I\u2019m a deary, I\u2019m stupid, so I\u2019m going to take it to my\nadvantage, and just prepare. And I won that trial. And my basic thing is I start off\nwith honey. Burn me and you\u2019re in trouble. And then [ll y -- rant, rave and scream,\nbut I usually don\u2019t rant, rave and scream first, cause I saw my parents rant -- my\nfather rant, raving and screaming. I\u2019m not sure that he was better off for it. I had a -- I\nwas pregnant with my first child and they told me I was unfit to try the case. Not the\njudge, but an attorney on the other side, because I would be going to the bathroom\ntoo much. He was a black attorney. The judge threw -- it was Christmas eve, the\njudge threw it out, and said I\u2019m not touching this -- at least he was wise enough --\nI\u2019m not touching this one. It\u2019s much better for the younger women attorneys, I\nDecember 7, 2000\nguarantee you. They didn't have to fight that. I campaigned when I was in college, for\nScoop Jackson. I went around and I did a lot of political planning, but a -- it was a --\npolitics 1s a very dirty animal. I didn\u2019t like the dirt. So I -- and especially for a\nwoman, it\u2019s much e -- more of a dirty animal. I fight for justice wherever it is. For\nspecial education and stuff like that. I\u2019m an independent. I\u2019m registered as an\nindependent, because then I\u2019m not locked in the primary to vote for a Republican or\nDemocrat, and I wanted to see where my vote counts. So I\u2019m more of that. I mean, I\nhear what\u2019s going on with Gore and -- and I\u2019m outraged because I think that there\nwere a lot of shenanigans going on and the people\u2019s votes weren\u2019t counted. It\u2019s not so\nmuch Gore as a person to win, or Bush, though I think Bush 1s an idiot. But the fact\nis that these people were turned away from voting, these votes didn\u2019t count. And that\ngets my gall. It\u2019s the underdog again, that gets my gall. I\u2019ve rallied for Israel. I don\u2019t\ndo it so much now. I\u2019m a little more laid back now than I used to be, but that\u2019s the\nonly way I can handle my work load and my kids. Cause I don\u2019t have three\nwallflowers. I mean, sometimes I wish for three wallflowers, but I don\u2019t have them.\nAnd I want to make sure that they grow up to be people that give to the community,\nthat\u2019s important to me. They give something of themselves to the community. My\noldest son gave 10 percent of his Bar Mitzvah money to charity, to the Home of\nLittle Wanderers. That was -- I didn't care which charity, but it was imperative that\nhe gave. My youngest one says, I know, I have to give. So at least I -- you know,\nDecember 7, 2000\ngood. You\u2019re going to have to give. And he chose -- you know, he\u2019s gonna choo -- he\nchose that Home for Little Wanderers, so he\u2019s going to give. That\u2019s important, for\nmy kids to give back to the community and not always take. It\u2019s not easy, especially\nwhen you live in an affluent community. But my oldest one works at a soup kitchen.\nThird week of the month he cooks and he delivers. My youngest one -- my middle\none does a little bit. My youngest one has to be pushed a little. He\u2019s probably not as\ngiving at the others. But we\u2019re working on it.",

        "A: I think part of the Holocaust children don\u2019t want -- do not want to be seen as\ndifferent, a-although we are. We want to be normal. I don\u2019t know what normal is, but\nwe want to be normal. And the only problem is our viewpoint of normalcy comes\nfrom a different plane than other people. I think that we carry -- we\u2019re a bridge, we\nreally are. And we carry the torch to our younger generation, our kids, to make sure\nthat they don\u2019t forget. And it\u2019s very hard, because unless they\u2019re living with their\ngrandparents, they can\u2019t understand as much, and you do, so you don\u2019t know what to\ndo. You understand where they\u2019re coming from, because they\u2019re removed and you\nunderstand where you parents are coming from, because you lived with it. And so\nDecember 7, 2000\nyou get battled from both ends. And sometimes you feel like the mediator between\ngenerations. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not the easiest thing to do.",
        "Q: And my last question is why did you agree to do this interview?",

She never did any of these\nthings, so I didn\u2019t. Did I resent it? Only a little, when I was older I resented it, not\nwhen I was young.",
        "A: Well, you gotta understand that they were never told to me as stories. I didn\u2019t have\nto take a fairy tale and try to then say oh, I\u2019m going to transfer this fairy tale to\nsomething that happened in real life. These were presented as real life stories, that\nreally happened to them. So I knew it was my parents. I knew it -- that everything\nbelonged to them, that I was part of that history. And they kept telling me I was part\nof that history. That I should be a good Jew, I guess, because I am a -- because I was\nborn, it was their fight against Hitler. I mean, I had to maintain that. That is\nsomething that I was brought up constantly. And I do tell my kids that, a -- a little bit,\nis that because I sur -- I -- I was born, and I survived a Jew, and I maintain it that I\nam victory over Hitler. So this was something that I grew up, all the time.\nDecember 7, 2000",

        "A: Well, you gotta understand, everybody has a dysfunctional family as far as I\u2019m\nconcerned, there is no perfect home. I mean, you watch on TV, that\u2019s where you\nmake your comparisons. And you always wanted to be like the family on TV, not so\nmuch like your friend\u2019s family, but the family on TV. Cause they always complained\nabout their parents, too. I didn\u2019t have a close home life. My mother -- I was closer to\nmy mother than my father, only cause my father wasn\u2019t home. My father is a very\ndriven man. Probably is why he survived. But also, he was an immigrant in a country\nand he had to prove himself. So he would get up at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning, which\nDecember 7, 2000\nmeans I\u2019m already in school. He would come back from meetings at 10 o\u2019clock at\nnight, and when I was young I was already in bed. He loved to listen to Yiddish mo --\nmusic, which is not something that I liked. And on the weekends they would go a lot\nwith their friends. I was a tagalong only because they didn\u2019t have a babysitter, and\nthey would speak Polish, which 1s a language that I never learned. So I had to create\nmy own world. I mean, I used to have dinner with my mother. She\u2019d u -- have the --\nshe loves the radio. So either she had music or news in the background. And she\u2019s\nvery political oriented. And so she would always talk all about all the political\nsituations and I had to always be a-abreast about it. And that would be our pul -- our -\n- our life. My parents didn\u2019t really integrate with me. Maybe it\u2019s part of the inte --\nEuropean culture. But we didn\u2019t do -- we went on vacations. We\u2019d travel a lot. We\ndidn\u2019t do a lot as a family, not that I can recall. My mother, again, she wouldn\u2019t take\nme shopping. She laughs at me when I say that. Oh well, you know, I took you on\nthese trips instead of shopping. We didn\u2019t do the normal family stuff. My mother\nliked to read, and that\u2019s what she did. I don\u2019t recall us ever engaging 1n board games.\nI don\u2019t ever a -- we nev -- it was as if they were tired of life. And I couldn\u2019t relate. I\nmean, again, that\u2019s also fantasy. You know, board games and playing with a little\nkid. And they didn\u2019t know how to deal with it.\nDecember 7, 2000",

I was\nnever showered with compliments. She may disagree with me, but that\u2019s my\nperception. I -- I always liked to draw and she always felt that that was beneath her as\nan occupation. I was accepted to art school, she was very angry. She said, as a\nvocation, not a -- as an advocation, not vocation. She wanted me to be a doctor, it\nwas it, black and white, you\u2019re a doctor or you\u2019re -- or you\u2019re a failure. She called me\na failure when I was in college.",
        "A: Yeah, oh --\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: -- yes, and she explained that to me. She said that a doctor -- and again, this is her\nperception because she was a survivor. A doctor can take their skills and go from one\ncountry to another and start again. And if I wasn\u2019t a doctor I wouldn\u2019t have those\ntransferable skills. And that\u2019s why it was so important, even though math was never a\nstrong point. And it was just not a subject that I excelled in. I was always on the\ndebating team, I was on the speech team. It was very interesting, I mean, when I was\nyoung, that\u2019s where I lean. And you know, yet I agreed to be a pre-med student the\nfreshman year of college. And then I realized it -- I loved taking care of people, but I\ncouldn\u2019t get through the chemistry and the -- the physics and the trigonometry to get\nthere. I mean, if it was just lab work, I got A\u2019s in biology lab work and stuff. So\nthat\u2019s the freshman year of college she called me a failure. But when you have no\nother siblings, y-you have to achieve all the goals that your parent want. And that\u2019s\nwhat they wanted. I mean, they didn\u2019t see me as almost a person, but an extension of\nall their goals. I can see that now. Maybe when I was younger I resented it.",

        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have compassion when I was younger, I have much more compassion\nnow. Confusion, I think was the better idea. I knew enough -- it wasn\u2019t anger. It\u2019s one\nof the reasons I left home, because I didn\u2019t want to have anger, I didn\u2019t want to have\nresentment, and I knew that distance would take care of that. They tried to totally\ndictate -- my mother, not my father -- cause she just was around more -- dictate my\nlife. In a sense I had -- she had to relive her childhood, her concept of a normal\nchildhood through me. If I had boyfriends she would write a script what to say to\nthese boyfriends. She would go through their mail to me, you know, judging them\neither fit or unfit. But yet, you know, she did give me freedom. I -- I dated early. So -\n- but I-I could see that she was more controlling in a way to give herself control over\nlife. She needed control so that she could feel control, because the war didn\u2019t -- not\nlet her have control.",
        "A: He was fantasy. My mother didn\u2019t yell and scream a lot, but she would keep a\ngrudge. She would keep it in her. My father, you can just spark him and he\u2019Il scream\nand rant, but on the most part, it\u2019s done and over with, you know? And you want to\nhide sometimes. I remember going into it -- he would -- he would pick fights, even\nwhen there were fights not even there. We\u2019d go to a store and he would pick a fight\nwith a salesman, or if he didn\u2019t like something a woman said, he would pick a fight.\nBut it would be done. It would fester with my mother. We had a neighbor who was\nDecember 7, 2000\nGerman, and they would always have fights, always have fights. My father would\ntake him to court, or they would -- screaming at each other. But the odd thing is that\nhis oldest daughter was my babysitter. So it was an interesting relationship.",
        "A: No, no, there was a feud in my family. Okay, I don\u2019t know the feud very well. The\nfeud started, I heard, when I was born. From one of my cousins, a first cousin, I heard\nthat my father would -- and my father still is a very generous and giving man. And he\nwas probably very generous and giving to them. And when I was born -- cause they\nhad waited 10 years for me and they were going to adopt, I guess they realized that\nthe fortune, or whatever my father had amassed wasn\u2019t going to go to them, and it\nwas going to go to me. This is what I was told. And there were conflicts and jealousy\nbecause my father made it 1n life and the brothers really didn\u2019t. So I didn't meet them,\nat all. I mean, I never met Leibush at all. I met -- I met David, oh, maybe a couple\nyears before his death. Al I met only once. When I was very small he gave me a book\nby Edgar Allen Poe. Why I remember this I don\u2019t even know. But -- and he was\nvery tall, and I don\u2019t really have any other memories of him.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: To the brothers, no, no. Absolutely no relationship whatsoever. There was a\ncousin named Benny, who was my first cousin, who -- maybe when I got married,\ncame to my father and said, I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m not my father\u2019s son, I want to start having\na relationship back with you. And we became very friendly with him, and I liked\nhim, and -- but they moved to North Carolina and distance has its, you know, way\nof cutting into family ties, so I don\u2019t see him any more. But I have good memories of\nhim later on in life. My father has a first cousin name -- a nephew named Eddie, who\nI have not a re -- really a relationship with at all, but he is friendly to my parents.",
        "A: They were close. They -- I -- I -- there was a cousin Leo, who -- my parents never\nmade a Passover, which is -- I don\u2019t know if you want me to explain it, but it -- it --\nPassover is the time when the Israelites left Egypt, and they lived in the desert. And\nthe actual name started when God -- after the 10\" -- or the last plague, God said to\nput lamb\u2019s blood on the door of the Israelites, and then he would pass over their\nhouse, and we should retell the story in -- in the -- we call it the Bible, we don\u2019t have\na fir -- a first testament and a second testament. Old Testament and New Testament,\nexcuse me. But your equivalent of -- of the Old Testament, it\u2019s in there, and it says,\nyou shall remember. So that is an very big holiday an-and it\u2019s a unique holiday\nbecause it\u2019s family oriented in the home. You don\u2019t go to temple, necessarily, for\nPassover. So my cousin Leo would always make it, even as a small kid I would go to\nDecember 7, 2000\nhis house. There was a cousin named Harold Anglestone, who is much older, but I\nheard he made the wedding for my parents. We didn\u2019t cup -- keep up with his\nchildren, but I do recall him. I am friendly with Leo\u2019s children, and Leo has a twin\nsister, and I\u2019m friendly with their children. Not extremely close, but definitely\nfriendly with them, they\u2019re come -- we go to each other\u2019s family occasions. But I was\nalways considered the outside -- I always felt like the outsider, even when I went to\nthese occasions.",

I was always considered the outsider.\nOnce I asked them, when I grew up. They said, your mother always said you were\nperfect, and that you, you know, you were always the best and the greatest. And so\nwe really didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with you. And I said, well that\u2019s nice for\nme to know, but I don\u2019t really perceive myself as that.",

We always went to their house because he knew how to do it and it was a\nfamily situation.

It was a big deal, but I was much\nyounger than her children, they were 10 years older than me. So I was always, again\nalone. And they would talk Polish.

And that was\nlike my favorite animal. He knew which one it was and shredded it. So it was a\ndifferent kind of relationship with animals. I was -- my father loves animals and he\nwould pick up all these strays. And once we had three or four dogs at one time. My\nmother was not too happy. I would pick up stray birds, we had stray rabbits that I\nwould pick up, and I would take care of the animals, too. I always had animals. Part\nof -- my husband laughs that when we got married, you know, the condition was that\nwe had dogs. That was it, we\u2019re going to have dogs, when we could, and we did.

He has some, but they\u2019re mostly -- he\nDecember 7, 2000\ndwells totally in the past because he feels comfortable there, and it\u2019s his way to\nescape. If you lock yourself in these stories, if you\u2019re constantly telling the stories,\nit\u2019s like an actor. If he\u2019s in a role, he doesn\u2019t feel his own pain.",

        "A: I actually didn\u2019t make that decision. To this day I have no idea how it came about,\nbut it appears when I was in high school, I was put in a program, it was an\naccelerated program that I only had three years of high school, and I went to summer\nschool one summer, and then I went to college early. I don\u2019t know who put me in that\nprogram, I have really absolutely no idea. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it, to be honest, to\nanyone. But I -- I think they basically said that I was too mature to stay in high\nschool and I just didn't fit in, which is an interesting way, I suppose, to put it. And so\nDecember 7, 2000\nI went to college early, and I didn\u2019t apply home. My mother recognized that we were\nstarting to fight, I mean, I was hitting puberty. If I -- if I lived -- college at 16, then\nyou know, puberty starts 14 - 15. I wa -- I was one, in the throes of it, but I don\u2019t\nknow if my mother really knew how to deal with it. One, children weren\u2019t supposed\nto talk against -- back to their parents, weren't supposed to argue with their parents,\nthey were supposed to be little mannequins. My mother always told me how\nwonderful she was. My mother would tell me how -- a good student she was. My\nmother always said how she listened to her parents, and I was not like that. So I guess\nwhat she was doing is trying to avoid, one a fight, and dealing with puberty. And I\nleft home and I only came back one summer, first summer. Because after college\nthey tried to put me, I remember, on a 10 o\u2019clock tur -- curfew, and they didn't want\nme to grow up. They wanted me to go away, but not to grow up. And that was\ndifficult. And I think it was difficult for them, too.",

They -- they -- a --\nthey -- every time we went into a room, the first thing they would do is talk about the\nHolocaust to my friends. First thing. And they would tell the stories. I mean, it was\njust everywhere. My first dates, my first friends, the first thing they came into the\nhouse, they would always -- they would tell the stories. And my friends were scared.\nDecember 7, 2000\nThey just didn\u2019t want to hear them all the time. So one, it limited your friendship, but\ntwo, when i -- you know, they were offended that my friends didn\u2019t want to hear it.\nWhat kind of person are you if your friends don\u2019t want to hear it? They were afraid\nbecause it was a test, also, whether or not I would keep Judaism. And you know, I\nwas away from home. What would I do? You know, I -- I -- I -- I dated people who\nwere non-Jewish, but honest I could say that I would never marry anybody who was\nnot Jewish. It was too much integrated in part of my life.",

It was a heritage. That\u2019s what it meant to them. They eat bread on\nPassover. I -- I -- I -- I didn\u2019t go to a Jewish day school. I went to Hebrew school. I\nwas not really Bat Mitzvahed. I had a party in Israel, but I never went through the\nformal training of a Bat Mitzvah in th -- in the United States, to this day. They had\nto -- and it was difficult for them, to be religious, with what they went through. I\nDecember 7, 2000\ndon\u2019t know if they hated God, but they were resentful. But they still wanted a\nconnection to heritage, and that they instilled in me very well.",
        "A: Iam actually more religious than my parents. We -- do you want t -- I mean, I\nnever had a -- a sukkah when I grew up. It\u2019s like a little hut that you put together and\nfor seven days you stay in it, and it\u2019s a harvest festival. We have one.

I\u2019m\nnot Shomer Shavas, which means that I don\u2019t -- I ride on Shabbat, and go places on\nshab -- on Saturday. But on Friday night all the kids get together and we have our\nFriday night dinner. To the point that my son works as a waiter and told them that he\nwill not work on Friday night because he has to be home for the Friday night dinner.\nWe celebrate the holidays, I change my dishes on Passover, we get rid of all the\nbread, I change the dishes, and we keep it -- actually, that\u2019s kind of an interesting\nstory, because the year that I decided to change the dishes, I had to look for plates.\nAnd I went into this store and there were a set of plates that had Egyptian pyramids\non it, and had the slaves. And I thought that was almost like, you know, God\u2019s telling\nme something. I bought those dishes, and they don\u2019t make them any more. They\ndiscontinued them after the year I bought them. And we still have them. So that way\nI\u2019m much more religious. My kids go to a Jewish day school. Part of it is heritage. A\nDecember 7, 2000\nlot of it is heritage, to be honest. But I\u2019m a lot more religious because I\u2019m not as\nangry with God as they are.",

But sometimes he gets choked up, he\ngot choked up at my wedding, he got choked up when he blessed my -- my older son\nat his Bar Mitzvah, but he usually doesn\u2019t get choked up. So, yeah, he liked it. I\nthink maybe he liked the idea that I thought of him, to ask him to come and -- and --\nand speak. Maybe it was an acknowledgement that, you know, I never turned my\nback on the Holocaust, but I don\u2019t live it day in and day out like that. And I know\nthat hurts them. I do. But I didn\u2019t forget it. It\u2019s still part of who I am.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: They were silent. They gave him an amazing amount of respect. Probably\nadmiration that he -- he survived and he was a soldier and that he made it, and oh, he\nfought the Germans, or the Nazis. So they respected him, cause a lot of these kids\nwere street kids, and they have a re -- respect of the pecking order. And he was, you\nknow, lieutenant governor of Krakow, and that was pe -- you know, prestigious\nposition. And I hope they walked away from that with some knowledge. We also did\na trial where -- we did a rape trial and I made the boys the victim, and had the women\nof the class on the jury and the judge. I reversed entire roles. And that was interesting\nbecause I\u2019m very attuned to victims.",
        "A: That incident?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely. It\u2019s probably the field -- why I chose this -- bec -- became a\nlawyer. Absolutely, I bring my perspective of the victim, I was always for the\nunderdog. Even when I was in high school, they were -- they were called inedgibles,\nthe mentally retarded children in the class, and you know, they were segregated. Not\nDecember 7, 2000\nso much now, but -- I used to be the one to help them, lead them around, or take care\nof them, or be assigned to them. Cause I understood what the underdog was, because\nI never put myself as saying that I was going through the Holocaust, but I wa -- could\nalways associate myself still close to my parents that 1t could happen to me, and that I\nhad to protect other people because of that. That\u2019s very strong, I try to make sure that\nmy kids are survivors, so that if ever it should happen to them, that they could\nsurvive. But I -- and I make them very attuned to that -- or I try, and also very proud\nof who they are, and respect others. Very important to me. But I still keep food\ndownstairs, a little extra food, in case something should happen, my husband laughs\nevery snowstorm, you know, why you stock up like for years? And he doesn\u2019t\nunderstand. I mean, I can explain it to him, but he doesn\u2019t understand. Just this\nmentality that if anything should happen, I am prepared.",

        "A: In -- only in hi -- only in Hebrew school, but no, not in the public school, this just\nnot spoken. I was probably looked at as a very odd person that my parents were\nSUIVIVOTS.",
        "A: I personally, I talk probably more about it now than I did when I grew up, but no.\nBut my parents always talked about it, I didn\u2019t have to, you know? And it\u2019s also --\nand if you have an accent, somebody\u2019s gonna go, where are you from? Even to my\nparents, it\u2019s the first thing out of their mouth. And they\u2019ll say, I\u2019m from Poland, and\nmy father jokes, I\u2019m from, you know, the south -- south Poland. [indecipherable] a\nlittle -- and they\u2019Il -- he\u2019Il say then they\u2019re survivors. So 1t comes out very, very\nquickly, where they\u2019re from. I went back during my college years to Poland. I went\nwith my mother on a trip. And that was an interesting experience.",
        "A: She wanted to go. Well, she wanted to go because there was a man who helped\nsave her life, his name was Mundek, and I -- he was very ill at the time. And my\nmother said that he was always in love with her. He never married. He\u2019d saved 12\ngirls. And she wanted me to meet him. And so my sophomore year of college I went\nto Poland, and at that time you couldn\u2019t go as a Jewish group to Poland. Didn\u2019t\nexist. You had to go with a Roman Catholic group, led by a priest to Poland. And\nthat\u2019s how we went, and that\u2019s -- it was very interesting because I never told them in\nDecember 7, 2000\nthe group that I was Jewish. I mean, I never brought it up. My mother didn't bring it\nup either. She basically said, you know, let us blend in right now. And I remember\nthe priest took a liking to me, and he always tried to make me go to confession to all\nthese different churches. And I kind of bowed out. And we had one week that we\nwere spending with our friends, with the people that helped save my father, and the\npeople who helped save my mother. But while we were in the tour group, there was\nalso a -- a group, they were the fir -- there was a group of first Christians or\nsomething like that, they were from Ohio, and they don\u2019t cross themselves either,\nand they don\u2019t go into confession. So I kind of said I -- I can\u2019t do that, or whatever.\nAnd he had no clue that I was Jewish, none. And there was a woman there who right\naway everybody knew she was Jewish. She also had a -- she was from Auschwitz, so\nshe had the symbol. But even before, they kind of knew. They used to tell Jewish\njokes on the bus, and they still made fun of Jews. Hardly any Jews in Poland at the\ntime and they still made fun of us. And I -- and I knew then how my mother felt. I\nused to wear a Moses holding the 10 commandments. I wore it on the inside. It was\nvery interesting. Then we spent a week with the families. And I met Mundek, but we\ncouldn\u2019t talk to each other. But he was if -- there was like a light in his eyes. He was\na very interesting, very nice man. But I spent -- we stayed at the house that -- of the\nwoman who saved my father, because she had a house in Warsaw. And she had two\nchildren my age. We couldn't speak very well, but they all kind of -- if they knew that\nDecember 7, 2000\nI was Jewish, it was just never brought up. Holocaust was never brought up, never\ndiscussed it. There was a language barrier. But there was one boy who came over\nwho did bring it up. And -- and we liked each other. And I said to him, by the way,\ndo you know that I was Jewish? I had to tell him, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- something\ncompelled me that I had to tell him who I was. And he said to me, we\u2019re all children\nof Moses. But he was the only one of the group who went to the university. So it was\nvery different, but I felt very strange there. You know, you would o -- go with other\npe -- I would not -- I mean, he knew I was Jewish. And of course, I thought the other\nchildren knew because of what their parents told them. But it\u2019s just not -- I was told\nin some parties not to bring it up. And then we went, you know, to see my father\u2019s\nhouse. And I felt -- then I felt anger, because I couldn\u2019t -- here was my father\u2019s\nhouse, that didn\u2019t belong to him any more, that was taken from him, and I wanted to\ngo up to these people and say, this is my heritage. My mother told me, you know,\nobviously, not to do that, not to bring it up, not even to mention we went to a\nrestaurant to have tea. No one questioned my mother, whether she was Jewish, no\none thought about it, and I guess I don\u2019t look that Jewish. It was not imprinted across\nmy forehead. But at the end of the trip was the most interesting part because I sat\nnext to the priest on one of the planes. And I showed -- he said, where do you go to\nschool, and I said I went to BU, and on my I.D. was the Jewish star. And he looked at\nthat, and you could see his eyes were widening, and he turned around, and he said,\nDecember 7, 2000\n\u201cThat -- that looks like a Jewish star.\u201d I said, \u201cIt is.\u201d He said, \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d And\nI said, \u201cI am.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, I like you anyway.\u201d And I think to him, he\nthought he was giving me a compliment. But, you know, there are two ways to\napproach those kind of people, yell and screaming, butt your heads, not get\nanywhere. Shake your head, and be polite. Show them that you can be better than\nthey. And then other ways, press your point. And I -- and I think that\u2019s the way that I\nusually do it.",

        "A: Since \u201975?",
        "A: No, I went to Auschwitz then, too. The trip was -- that was also very strange. We\nwent to Auschwitz, but again remember, we went with a Catholic group. And now\nthey have tours and say Jews died there. When we went there, they didn't tell us Jews\ndied there. The official tour was that many people died there, period. Not one word\nthat Jews died there. But you could see that -- the fingernails in the wall -- in the\ncement walls. You can see imbedded lines that match fingernails in -- in the gas\nchambers. And you just have a chill. I mean, you know, there\u2019s just a silence and a\nchill. And that\u2019s -- you know, you realize that it will never hap -- you\u2019re not going to\nDecember 7, 2000\nlet it happen again. But that\u2019s something for the perspective, versus dwelling on the\npast.",
        "A: We were close. That was probably one trip that we were quite close. I probably\nwas not a very warm child. My mother wasn\u2019t that warm either, I mean, she would\nhold my hand, and -- and stuff like that, and I didn't want her to hold my hand cause I\nthought that was not the right thing to do, you know, women holding hands together.\nBut she would never come and hug and cuddle and kiss me. And I in turn was not a\nhuggy, cuddly person either. I\u2019m much more with my children. But we were close. I\nthink that we did hold hands then. It was almost like the world against us, except for\nthese people that we stayed with. It tends to bind you.",
        "A: Well, I saw all the pictures, my parents would always show them to me. So they\nbecame affirmed, but not concrete -- any more concrete, because I think they were\nalready concrete. You know, if you\u2019re 1n a ca -- you can see pictures of the gas\nchamber, and be in a gas chamber, and it\u2019s a very, very different feeling, but they\nwere always in my memories. | -- I remember once -- this was past college, but I\nremember once we were with these young people, and again my parents bring the\nDecember 7, 2000\nHolocaust up right away. This woman stepped on a bug, and got upset cause she was\na vegetarian, and -- and my mother said, well, that\u2019s how they used to crush children\nin the Holocaust. You know, there was a moment of silence after that, what do you\ndo? It\u2019s a very awkward pause. But that\u2019s -- and -- and they never saw that it would\nbe an awkward pause cause they had to keep telling. You know, some don\u2019t tell,\nsome don\u2019t let go.

        "A: No, they couldn\u2019t relate to it at all. They had no patience for it whatsoever.\nBasically they looked at me as -- they wanted to 1g-ignore that it even existed. You\nknow, I was studying that the Pilgrims used to dress up their children in adult clothes,\nbecause they didn\u2019t realize children were children, didn't want them to be children,\nbut to be miniature adults. And I think that\u2019s what they wanted me to be, a miniature\nadult. I mean, they -- I think my father took pride in -- in that I was a little girl, but\nno, I don\u2019t think they could deal with the trivial problems of growing up very much.\nIt -- because, to them, they always compared it to the war, and it was so trivial to the\nwar that how could you even be bothered, you know, by acne, or how could you be\nbothered with the fact that you\u2019re heavy, until later on, finally I went on a diet,\nbecause I wanted to.

Once we got to the countries, she\u2019s perfectly happy reading in a\nhotel room. And my father I would explore. That was the time that my father and I\nreally got to know each other. I remember in Paris my mother stayed in the hotel\nroom, we went to the art colony, we went all around.

I -- it may\nsound like a -- a strange, opposite approach to it, but it\u2019s extremely important to me.\nAnd it was comforting that they were there, but not that it was a bigger picture and\nthat I had some family.

And he got along with my parents, my parents\nliked him. He would listen to their stories. And he used to like to fix things and my\nfather liked to fix things, so that he fit in our family. I don\u2019t have an easy family to fit\ninto. So that was a positive sign. Has it develop -- it developed when I came back\nfrom Poland, and I -- I went to Israel for a winter vacation, and he had taken a year\nin Israel. So we met there, and I still was not the apple of his eye, his bicycle was.\nHe toured Israel all over with his bicycle, and went through Europe all over with\nthis bicycle. He was more interested in the condition of his bicycle than I. But when\nDecember 7, 2000\nhe came back, it was a very hard decision for both of us, because we were always\ngood friends, and once you go past good friends, into a different kind of relationship,\nyou can\u2019t go back. So we had to decide whether we were willing to risk it. We were\nboth very young. And -- and my parents pushed us into marriage, I\u2019m positive. Cause\nwe -- I got married three weeks after I graduated c-college. I didn\u2019t plan my wedding,\nmy mother planned my wedding. I didn\u2019t even get to pick my dress. She kind of\npicked my dress, and I wanted to change it, and she kept saying no, no, so I think I\nchanged it a little bit. I think I picked the colors, that\u2019s about it. I walked into the\nwedding and everything was done. We were young, I was 20 years old when I got\nmarried. And we grew together. And I must admit, he\u2019s much more stable and I\u2019m\nmuch more volatile. I mean, you know, a lot of times I\u2019d say, I can\u2019t take this any\nmore, you know, go away from me. And he\u2019Il be the one say, no, we gotta work this\nout, calm me down. But we had that bond of Judaism, and of our heritage, which was\na very strong bond.

Continuation of our heritage. I basically raised the\nchildren. He\u2019ll concede to that, I think, because he\u2019s gone a lot. He does a lot of\nresearch, he used to do a lot of moonlighting, more -- only this year he stopped the\nmoonlighting. He wanted children so badly that I had just finished law school -- we\nwere married still when we were in grad school together. He was -- I was up here, I\nbrought him up here, I liked Boston. I didn\u2019t want to return to New Jersey, I felt\nthere was nothing there. Except my parents there was nothing there. So I -- I went to\nlaw school, he went to Harvard graduate school. Then I -- then he went to med\nschool. And I took the bar, and I w -- said, we\u2019re not moving. But when he was an\nintern, he wanted a child. I don\u2019t know why, he wanted a child very badly. And I kept\nsaying look, you\u2019re not going to be around. But he really wanted a child, I conceded.\nWe had a child. And he was gone all the time, so I have a very close relationship with\nmy older son, who has a difficult relationship with my husband. But it was very\nimportant for us to keep up Judaism.

        "A: And so you build a wall. You have a choice, you can have a nervous breakdown\nand crack, or you build self defense to those things and go on. And that\u2019s what\nhappened. And also, I guess, the European way is -- is that again, kids probably\nwere in playpens, and that\u2019s how she was brought -- she was brought up she had a\nDecember 7, 2000\nmaid, so I had a maid til I was three. She didn\u2019t -- I mean, she would take pride in the\nfact that she used to bathe me. My father used to read to me, my mother used to bathe\nme and the rest of the time I was with the nanny until I was three, because she would\nteach, or whatever, but you know, it wasn\u2019t that si -- close. I mean, now, you know,\npeople realize how much the bonding is important. I mean, people didn\u2019t know that\nthen. But I -- I didn\u2019t -- I did not have an au pair until I had a third child. I had\nalways somebody come in and help me, but I -- I still to this day don\u2019t work full time,\nI work part time, so that I\u2019m the one who runs around when they have the plays in the\nschools and the doctors appointments and -- and all that. I do that. My au pair\ndoesn\u2019t do that. Never did.",
        "A: Yes. Dustin, now we have English and Hebrew names too. So Dustin\u2019s is -- 1s -- I\nmean, you say Dustin\u2019s not a very Jewish name. It\u2019s a German name, it means\nvictorious, or -- going back, but his name is Dustin Isaac, and he his Hebrew name is\nDavid Itzhak, or David Isaac. David was a -- after my mother\u2019s father, and Isaac\nwas after my father\u2019s father. You know, that was one thing I must say for my\nhusband is, I mean, obviously he had a family too. And he didn\u2019t object that I named\nthem after my side of the family. He kind of understood that it was important to keep\ntheir names alive. And I credit him for that. And 18 is something they do in their\nDecember 7, 2000\nfamily. And I felt 1t was just a wonderful idea, so that I incorporated it, some of --\nlike the spelling of Isaac is a little off, but it\u2019s 18. Aaron Richard, and then his\nHebrew name is Aaron Raphael. Aaron 1s after his grandfather, but even my\nparents liked his grandfather, and I don\u2019t th -- and he had just died, so it actually fit in\nvery well, but Raphael is -- is after Rachel, my father\u2019s sister. Richard. And\nMichael -- actually we had a little problem with Michael\u2019s name, my mother wanted\nFrederick, and I just couldn\u2019t see naming my child Frederick. Now, we thought\neven Forest, they told me they wouldn\u2019t even call him by name if he -- his name was\nForest. They call my son, by the way, instead of Dustin, Dodson, on purpose cause\nthey didn\u2019t like the name. But so Michael was actually my idea cause my father has a\nsister named Malchia, and Fried is Frieda, but it\u2019s spelled a little different. And his\nHebrew name is Simcha Meloch, which is actually -- the translation is happy king.\nAnd that was their Hebrew names. So it\u2019s interesting in school they dwell a lot on\nhow you got your name. Ev -- almost every year they ask the kids how they got their\nname, and they\u2019re supposed to write a report about their heritage. And they\u2019re kind of\nproud. At first Dustin wasn\u2019t proud of Dustin, didn\u2019t like 1t as much. But now\nthey\u2019re -- they\u2019re -- they\u2019re proud of how they got their names. They don\u2019t know\nthese people very well. My father did write when they were born, about the parents\nwho their named after. But -- so that was important, to keep that going.\nDecember 7, 2000",

You know, did you read this, and -- and if I -- and if I got one thing\nmisquoted they would correct me, and why didn\u2019t you remember this, and why didn\u2019t\nyou remember that. And they do it with my kids, too. And I have at least the\ntemperance of years behind me, my kids are not diplomatic. So, you know, yes, I\u2019ve\nread their books, but 1-1t was -- it\u2019s sometimes a little difficult. I wanted to read it to\nunderstand it, enjoy it, not to necessarily be tested on it.

Because that really shows a lot of him, more than a lot of what\nthe situation made of them. So yeah, I read the books. My oldest son has read the\nbooks. My middle son has read one of the books, and my youngest son has read a\nlittle bit. It\u2019s difficult with him because he just hates to read.",
        "A: It\u2019s strained. All of -- for all three kids it\u2019s still strained. But they\u2019re closest with\nDustin. One, he was the first. And like it or not, even though my mother probably\nDecember 7, 2000\nresented the fact that she was a middle child, all the time says, well he\u2019s the oldest so\nhe should get more. He\u2019s the oldest, that he should, you know, have this kind of\nprivilege. And I would look at her and say, but you used to complain about it. But it\u2019s\ndifferent. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s different, but it\u2019s different. I try not to do that to\nthem. I-It\u2019s strained because they would love for them to sit there and look at them\nadoringly and suck up everything they have to say. My father started telling the\nHolocaust stories to my son when he was three years old.",
        "A: Yeah. So that\u2019s why I think he started with me at three -- until we put a stop to it.\nHe would have nightmares. My older son is a very sensitive child, and I -- I think it\nwarped him in some ways. He didn't do it with the younger two. We really -- I says,\nyou can tell them you were a soldier, you can tell them that bad things happened to\nchildren, but not the gory details, and he went to the gory details with Dustin. In one\nway, he relates to them better for that. In another way I think that he\u2019s a little\nsaddened in life by it. The younger two he -- he -- because we wouldn\u2019t let him,\nbasically. He still tells the stories, but a much more -- not -- not a positive spin, but in\nthe beginning it was a positive spin, you know. I was a soldier, I survived, I -- against\nthe bad guys and the Hitler and -- and so they don\u2019t relate as close. Now he\u2019s\nbeginning to tell them more of the atrocities, but they don\u2019t want to hear it. See, my\nson -- my older son is willing to hear it, but the r -- the younger two are not. They\u2019re\nDecember 7, 2000\njust not. And it hurts them tremendously. I\u2019m the bridge. They can\u2019t relate to it as\nmuch. They\u2019re very proud of them. My father, you know, th-the -- that he survived\nthe war. They\u2019re ba -- proud of both of them, but they don\u2019t want to hear the constant\ntales of woe. My youngest one when he\u2019s older probably will be more attuned to it,\nmy middle one, no. He won\u2019t hear it. And they resent him for that.",
        "A: Yeah, I was punished.",
        "A: Once I was hit with the belt. Most of the time they would either take -- a-and\nwhen I was older, I had Barbie\u2019s, they would put them in the attic, they would give\nthem away. I had -- once had a Shirley Temple doll that my mother just shattered\nwhen I was bad, she was mad at me for something. I don\u2019t recall what I did, but she\nwas mad at me and totally shattered it, broke it. It was more the isolation treatment.\nYou know, they wouldn\u2019t talk to me. Or at -- my mother has this look that you just\nknow she doesn\u2019t approve. And she would keep looking at you like that. There would\nbe yelling. I don\u2019t think I was -- except for that one time that I really remember, I\ndon\u2019t know if I was ever really physically punished after that. I was slap -- my\nmother would -- yeah, she -- and I -- and I did do that when it was in the beginning,\nbut I\u2019ve stopped that, she would take my arm and pinch it. That she would do. How\ndo I reprimand my kids? God, I tried the whole gambit. I have three very strong\nwilled child -- children and I have, you know, children who have ADHD. So they\u2019re\na little -- sometimes a little more trying. I would slap their hands. I would slap their\nhands. But I\u2019d warn them. Kind of say, Pll give you -- and I used the word Hebrew\nmakkah, because I didn\u2019t want everybody to know what I was going to do. So they\nknow what that word is, actually. And it\u2019s, I'll give you makkah if you don\u2019t -- so\nsometimes they\u2019d even give me the hand. Once I slapped Dustin, I think, in the face,\nhe did something that was just so rude. Slap on the hand mo -- and then -- then we\ntried this method called time out, which worked, because he knew I was serious, I\u2019d\nDecember 7, 2000\ngive him time out in the restaurant. Put him in a corner. It\u2019s called one, two, three\ntime out. And they still know it. All I have to do is show them my fingers, I\u2019m\npointing one finger, two finger, three fingers and they knew I meant time out. It\u2019s a\nlittle hard when the oldest one is 18. Now his method is I take his car keys. But that\u2019s\n-- that\u2019s how I do it. That\u2019s my punishment.",

Probably a little more warped. Family, I think,\nDecember 7, 2000\nfor child survivors are very important. I find that is a unifying fact in every one of the\nchild survivors that I\u2019ve met. There\u2019s this woman now from Israel, that we met\nthrough another family, child surviv -- you know, survivor, and we\u2019re -- we\u2019re close,\nit just -- I know what you\u2019ve gone through, I know the stories that you\u2019ve gone\nthrough.

And you know that either you\u2019re going to resent your parents for it,\nor you try to deal with it. I don\u2019t resent them for who they are. Maybe when I was\nyounger a little bit. I can understand that they went through hell, and that I\u2019m just\ngoing to have to be accepting of who they are. I\u2019m not going to be able to change\nthem. You know, for many years you try to change somebody, and you realize you\ncan\u2019t do that. So you either respect them, or you distance yourself, or you want to\nhave nothing to do with them, those are the three choices. When you don\u2019t have a\nfamily, that\u2019s not an option. They\u2019re the only things that I have to a family, so it\u2019s\njust not an option. And so that\u2019s why I keep telling my kids, this is all we have. We\ndon\u2019t have anybody else.

That means you\u2019re\nreliving it and reliving it and reliving it. And I don\u2019t want to do that. When the\narticles come out on my parents, I\u2019m proud, I-I show them to my kids, and they read\nthem.

So -- a-and\nthat\u2019s why we sent them to Schecter, to be proud of their heritage, of who they are.\nAnd again, to make sure that it won\u2019t happen again to them. And I think they see that.\nI mean, my -- my middle one will go into a restaurant, very -- very -- and say, hey,\nthere\u2019s Christmas stuff, but there\u2019s no Hanukkah stuff, why? I don\u2019t think an\nAmerican kid would really pay attention to that. So it has sunk in a little bit, you\nknow? I mean, maybe not the way that my parents -- but he\u2019s very proud of who he\nis. He\u2019s very proud that he\u2019s Jewish. It was difficult cause my oldest son was dating a\nnon-Jew.

Maybe an\nAmerican doesn\u2019t understand that. And I look. If somebody\u2019s talking about Jews, or\nsaying something and I hear it in the background, I'll speak up.

And then [ll y -- rant, rave and scream,\nbut I usually don\u2019t rant, rave and scream first, cause I saw my parents rant -- my\nfather rant, raving and screaming. I\u2019m not sure that he was better off for it. I had a -- I\nwas pregnant with my first child and they told me I was unfit to try the case. Not the\njudge, but an attorney on the other side, because I would be going to the bathroom\ntoo much. He was a black attorney. The judge threw -- it was Christmas eve, the\njudge threw it out, and said I\u2019m not touching this -- at least he was wise enough --\nI\u2019m not touching this one. It\u2019s much better for the younger women attorneys, I\nDecember 7, 2000\nguarantee you. They didn't have to fight that. I campaigned when I was in college, for\nScoop Jackson. I went around and I did a lot of political planning, but a -- it was a --\npolitics 1s a very dirty animal. I didn\u2019t like the dirt. So I -- and especially for a\nwoman, it\u2019s much e -- more of a dirty animal. I fight for justice wherever it is. For\nspecial education and stuff like that. I\u2019m an independent. I\u2019m registered as an\nindependent, because then I\u2019m not locked in the primary to vote for a Republican or\nDemocrat, and I wanted to see where my vote counts. So I\u2019m more of that. I mean, I\nhear what\u2019s going on with Gore and -- and I\u2019m outraged because I think that there\nwere a lot of shenanigans going on and the people\u2019s votes weren\u2019t counted. It\u2019s not so\nmuch Gore as a person to win, or Bush, though I think Bush 1s an idiot. But the fact\nis that these people were turned away from voting, these votes didn\u2019t count. And that\ngets my gall. It\u2019s the underdog again, that gets my gall. I\u2019ve rallied for Israel. I don\u2019t\ndo it so much now. I\u2019m a little more laid back now than I used to be, but that\u2019s the\nonly way I can handle my work load and my kids. Cause I don\u2019t have three\nwallflowers. I mean, sometimes I wish for three wallflowers, but I don\u2019t have them.\nAnd I want to make sure that they grow up to be people that give to the community,\nthat\u2019s important to me. They give something of themselves to the community. My\noldest son gave 10 percent of his Bar Mitzvah money to charity, to the Home of\nLittle Wanderers. That was -- I didn't care which charity, but it was imperative that\nhe gave. My youngest one says, I know, I have to give. So at least I -- you know,\nDecember 7, 2000\ngood. You\u2019re going to have to give. And he chose -- you know, he\u2019s gonna choo -- he\nchose that Home for Little Wanderers, so he\u2019s going to give. That\u2019s important, for\nmy kids to give back to the community and not always take. It\u2019s not easy, especially\nwhen you live in an affluent community. But my oldest one works at a soup kitchen.\nThird week of the month he cooks and he delivers. My youngest one -- my middle\none does a little bit. My youngest one has to be pushed a little. He\u2019s probably not as\ngiving at the others. But we\u2019re working on it.",
        "A: I think part of the Holocaust children don\u2019t want -- do not want to be seen as\ndifferent, a-although we are. We want to be normal. I don\u2019t know what normal is, but\nwe want to be normal. And the only problem is our viewpoint of normalcy comes\nfrom a different plane than other people. I think that we carry -- we\u2019re a bridge, we\nreally are. And we carry the torch to our younger generation, our kids, to make sure\nthat they don\u2019t forget. And it\u2019s very hard, because unless they\u2019re living with their\ngrandparents, they can\u2019t understand as much, and you do, so you don\u2019t know what to\ndo. You understand where they\u2019re coming from, because they\u2019re removed and you\nunderstand where you parents are coming from, because you lived with it. And so\nDecember 7, 2000\nyou get battled from both ends. And sometimes you feel like the mediator between\ngenerations. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not the easiest thing to do.",
