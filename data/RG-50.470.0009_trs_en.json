And just tell it to me the way that you\nexperienced it.\nJOHN HOLMES: Well like I had said before, this was not uh,\ndeemed a concentration camp, It was a labor camp. We were\nfighting in the Hartz mountain sector. Um. On our way into\nfighting in Austria. Anyway, when we, when we, when we\ncrossed this river and we came into this area the Germans\nwere in there. But they were more, they didn't, they didn't\nput up any resistance and they had an airport nearby. And\nas a matter of fact this was the place I saw my first German\njets. And I never knew what they were, but I knew they were\njust damn fast, because I tried to open up fire on them, a\ncouple of them. And by the time you could get your guns\ntrained, that thing was phew, gone like that. But anyway,\num, we S- we sS-, um, we passed this house and off in the\ndistance you could see huge warehouses and then long rows of\num, something like a, I don't know what, it's not a quonset\nhut, but uh, just a square, long buildings, and it had a\ngate in it. And I don't recall what the writing was up over\nthe gate, but what it, what we did encounter, inside of\nthere, I got out the turret of my tank, and walked in to see\nwhat was inside. And that was when I, d- d-, well you could",
        "smell death for maybe 20 miles before you ever got to it,\nbecause it's very dif-, humans and animals, entirely\ndifferent. You can stand a cow or a horse or something\nthat's been shot up, but a human being, is death, the stench\nof death from it is, it's, it's awful. So, I saw this high\nceiling and this little narrow pathway down the center, and\nthey had maybe twelve or fourteen tiers. And you- and\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. JOHN HOLMES\nPage 2\nyou've just enough room, maybe oh I'd say, for an individual\nto slip through, between each tier of bunks. And can you\nimagine them being twi-, now me at six foot it is twice as\nhigh as I am tall, in other words you got twelve or fourteen\nfeet. Now these bunks, they got little ladders going up\nthere and these people, now you might find underneath here\nwould be dead person, and in, living in that, living person\nwas just too damn weak to even move. And all they, all they\ndo is just hold out their hand, and you were afraid to touch\nthem. Uh, some of them had scabs and sores and everything\non them, they had just been there for- and- and what MI\nunderstand that these people were fed a ounce of meat I\nthink it was once a week. They were also given potato soup",
        "or cabbage soup once a day in aoum, a small cube of bread,\nit might have been about like so. And I don't know how\nthick it was but it couldn't have been very thick. And they\nwere nothing, they had an American Colonel in there, I don't\nknow how many months he had been a prisoner, but he\noriginally weighed about two, his height must have been, I'd\nsay a good six four. He originally weighed about 230, maybe\na little bit more. And I don't think that he weighed any\nmore than eighty pounds when we saw him. So you can imagine\nthe, the horror that those people suffered under Ger- German\noccupation. Um, as prisoners of war, they didn't even feed\nsome of them. They- It was just- I- I- I- I- the only that\nI can say to you would have to have seen it. The pictures\nthat you saw depicting the death in the concentration camps,\nthis was identically the same.\nSWB: When you first drove the tank in, did you drive right\nin.\nJOHN HOLMES: No, no, I don't drive, I was a tank commander,\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int.

        "my driver did.\nSWB: Tell me, were there any people outside?\nJOHN HOLMES: None at all.\nSWB: And did you exchange fire with anyone, or everyone was\ngone.\nJOHN HOLMES: The Germans took off and left everything just\nas it was. Even their warehouses of guns. This- this was\nthe the- the um, I think this was the um, the Walter  .32,\nthey made a .32 pistol. And these, uh, these uh prisoners\nthat were capable of work, any work at all, were the\nlaborers that did the assembling of these pistols and all in\nthat big huge factory to the rear. Uh there was no other\ngun there but that and they had them in there by the\nhundreds, just cases of them, you kind of like wonder where,\nyou know, went all that trouble to make those guns that\ncould have been feeding some of those people.\nSWB: So when you went in the barracks and you found all\nthis did you, could you talk to anyone. Tell me what else\nhappened...\nJOHN HOLMES: It was, it was virtually, can you- can- can\nyou imagine trying to talk some- to someone that do, they\ndon't even have the strength to op- for their vocal cords to\neven operate. We were warned not to give them anything,",
        "like our C rations and our K rations, don't give them that.\nSee these people had to be fed a broth, or something that\nwas soupy that they could swallow that would not choke them\nto death because it, if you- if you fed them they couldn't\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. JOHN HOLMES\nPage 4\nSwallow it. If you gave them solid food, cause a lot of\npeople made that mistake. A lot of our soldiers made that\nmistake when they ran across where they had you~ know\nliberated somebody that had been under starvation\nconditions. And they gave them their food. The food has a\ntendency to choke you then. And you just choke to. death.\nWhereas if they would just let them alone and let the people\ngradually eat soup until they get their strength back to\nwhere your stomach becomes acclimated to it.\nSWB: Were you surprised?\nJOHN HOLMES: Yes I was. I truly was, because I just\ncouldn't believe that an individual that is supposed to be\nfighting for the preservation of his cus- culture and his\ncountry could be doing this to people who had not\u2019 defense.",
        "I couldn't believe this. Because you-you-you-you're flab\nbergasted. You-you're so shocked by what you're looking at.\nWell, I give you a good example. Uh-I-I, I-I-I wasn't\nreally surprised yet I was. I can say this, um, the\nfourteenth reconnaissance platoon was out scouting and they\nran into a bunch of Nazi SS and they were captured. And we\nhad a hell of a fire fight. And I-I definitely was\nresponsible for killing one, two three, four, I'd say\napproximately six German soldiers myself. Directing fire in\non them. They, these, they- they captured about a dozen of\nthese uh, it-it was the fourteenth conance- reconnaissance\nunit. And they tied their hands behind their back and they\ntied their feet together, and I'm not telling you _ what\nsomebody told me, I'm telling you what exactly I saw. And\nin this little town there must have been at least, no-oh- I\ndon't even think this town had a- a- six houses in it. But\nit had a little road that went down like a, and did you know\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. JOHN HOLMES\nPage 5\nthose Nazi SS s.o.b.'s took those, those- those young boys,\nwe were all about the same age, and they, when they put,\nwhen they tied their hands and feet together, and hands",
        "behind their back, and they laid them out along the row, in\na row, and they put a bullet right between their eyes. And\nI can recall, from this fire fight, headquarters company I\nthink came in from the, southeast, and they had 105. guns,\n105 millimeter guns. Ours were s- were these 75's and 76\nmillimeters. We killed just, I think we killed all of them.\nI don't recall us taking any prisoners. Cause you had _ to\nkill them. Because they were not going to surrender. The\nNazi SS was not going to surrender. They would shoot\u2019 and\nshoot until they were killed. It was stupid because they\nwere raised all the way from the Hitler youth. And that's\nwhat they believed in. And when you caught them, they all\nhad that insignia on their collar. So that's how you\u2019 knew\nwhat you were fighting. But, to show you the difference\nbetween um, fighting, at the concentration camp....\nSWB: We have to put another roll of film...\n[CAMERA RELOAD |\n[CR#2 ]\nSWB: When you were first coming in was there an exchange of\nfire and you shot down a plane?\nJOHN HOLMES: No, there was no exchange of fire period. The\nonly thing that, uh, we- cause we were really amazed to see\nthese um, this- this junkers, I think, what was it, one, it\nwasn't a junker, it was a German transport. We- the one",
        "that I opened fire up on was um, a transport, I think it had\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. JOHN HOLMES\nPage 6\nhigh ranking German officers in it. And of course we never\nSaw it crash, cause, when we shot into it, you know, by the\ntime when it's approaching you, and you open fire with a\nfifty caliper machine gun, um, you don't know how many slugs\num, you put in them, but um, or, who survived, what with the\nplane, you- you're two or three thousand feet off the\nground, and it just- it's going on in and-and-and the\nengines are smoking, you know it's gonna crash but it\ncrashed way back to the back of us, SO we never got a chance\nto see what, you know, damage you'd done.\nSWB: And were there guards in the guard houses when = you\ncame to the camp.\nJOHN HOLMES: None at all. Absolutely. I told you,\neverybody had, the-they just, as they say, they shagged tail\non out of there. Uh, whatever guns and everything they had,\nthey just dropped them and ran. Now they didn't want the\nco-, number one, th-the German soldier, uh, was a told all",
        "the way back from Ger- uh- World War I, when they had black\nAmericans fighting over there in Europe, uh that, don't be\ncaptured by black troops. Cause they would cut your throat.\nCourse which was a lie, but during World War I, a lot of our\nguys did do that. They would infiltrate into the German\nlines at night in World War I and they had razors. And th-\ndon't nobody know when somebody, you know, was clapped their\nhand across your mouth and then cut your throat, and you lay\nthere and bleed to death and the rest of the guys around you\nthat survived it didn't even know that you were dead,\nparticularly the sentries on the outer line, parts, they\nwere always caught off-guard and killed like that. But uh\nthis went all the way back, this, [laughs] they said\n[laughs] as a matter of fact, the German soldiers were, we\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. JOHN HOLMES\nPage 7\nwe shot up, I don't know whether you saw um, Liberators\nfighting on two fronts, this one particular guy was in my\noutfit, um, um, there was a bunch of Germans, must have been\ntwo or three thousand that came out of the woods and, German\nsoldiers and they came out, and they took a look and they\nlooked and saw the black soldiers, and they said, what, oh",
        "no, not you guys, and they turned around and started back\nthrough the woods, and we put some high explosives over\ntheir head and they come on back out just as nice with their\nhands on back up, and they would rather take a chance rather\nthan be blown to bits, come on out and now let's. talk\nturkey.\nSWB: When you went into this camp that you came upon, about\nhow long did you stay?\nJOHN HOLMES: I would imagine we must have been there at\nleast, um, inside the camp itself maybe about an hour, hour\nand, hour and a half, and when it came orders to move out,\num, I had already talked to this lady, Mrs. Schimmel,\nbecause she came to the door, and um, she flagged me down\nand she said um, soldier, she said um, and her English was\nvery good, Mrs. Schimmels, you would have thought that she\nwas from the states. But she was raised, she was an\nAustrian person of German descent. And so she asked me\nwhere I was from, I said I'm- I said I'm from Chicago. She\nSaid Seargant, she said, you're from Chicago, I said _ yeah,\nshe said you know where Skokie is? I said sure I know where\nSkokie is. I says right across the canal from where my\nmother lives. She said I have a sister there, and I wonder\nif you would give her a letter for me. And I said, well,\nsure, so I gave her, she wrote the letter and I, when I was\ndischarged I took it by the house and gave it to her. And,",

JOHN HOLMES\nPage 8\nwe- of course we didn't stay in the communications with one\nanother after that because her husband was rather nasty and\nI didn- I didn't want to be bothered with it, going back,\nbut um. She was pretty- but the woman herself was very\nnice. Met the sister and she thanked me for delivering that\nand all. And I think the sister in Skokie wound up sending\nfor her, and she mi- if she's still living she's in the\nstates now.\nSWB: Do you know what happened to the people in the camp\nafter you left.\nJOHN HOLMES: No.\nSWB: Had you been told what to expect.\nJOHN HOLMES: No.\nSWB: But you had been told not to feed...\nJOHN HOLMES: Aft- only after we had secured the camp.",
        "SWB: And who told, tell me more about that, how did you get\nthe word.\nJOHN HOLMES: We got it from our battalion commander, or one\nof our officers, cause I can't recall whether it was a major\nOr a captain that said, do not give them anything to e- the\nword was passed all the way down the line, do not feed these\nprisoners, under any circumstances. Because, they wanted as\nmany of them alive as possible. Cause see they all had a\nstory to tell, also. Where they were captured, how long,\nwhat concentration camp they came from, because a lot of the\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. JOHN HOLMES\nPage 9\ninstances, see, like Bergen Belsen all of those places like\nthat, when they, if, they needed workers, and didn't have\nenough in one sector, they would send them from, on a train,\nboxcars full of them, all the way down to another sector to\nfill out as a work force. Those that they could trust.\nSWB: What did the people when you went in the barracks with\nthese tall benches, what did the people do...",
        "JOHN HOLMES: The-th-th-they-they couldn't, those that were\nliving, all they could, they-they looked death eating a soda\ncracker. That's what we used to call it. They-they-it-they\nwere like s- they were skinny, skin and bones. You-you can\nyou imagine a skeleton trying to talk to you? And holding\nout his hand? Can you imagine that? Can you get any kind\nof inkling what it's like. And this is all you saw. These\npeople could not get up. These people were literally\nabandoned. And I imagine that um, when the Germans\u2019 took\noff, running, I imagine that those that were capable of\ngoing, they herded them in front of them, because see,\nah-uh-uh-uh-uh-upon our approach, the Germans were not gonna\nStick around. They were not gonna stick around to, for us\nto see them nor how many prisoners they took with them. And\nwhether they killed them or not, I do not know, but you know\nthe orders were from Adolf Hitler, was to, that any\nprisoners that, when the Americans approach, kill all the\nprisoners. That was...\nSWB: What about any revenge against the Germans because of\nthis. Do you think any of that, did it instill anger...\nJOHN HOLMES: No. It didn't distill, it didn't in instill\nanger, because you know s- number one, I think the shock of\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.",
        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. JOHN HOLMES\nPage 10\nsomething like that, could I explain something? If you're\nfighting a German soldier and you kill him, that happens.\nYou look down at him, and that's and you keep right on\nmoving. That's an individual that's trying to kill you and\nit doesn't make any- But when you see something where here\nis a, s- here are individuals by the dozens that have done\nnothing to no one. Bu- fu- their-their-their-their captors\nsaid do this or do that, and you did it. This is, you were\nso shocked by this, looking at it, that I don't, I think,\nthe-the-the-the shock of something like that does not wear\noff right away. So therefore, you can't uh, you can't, y\nyou just can't, I just don't know how to p-, I wished I\ncould phrase it. Cause I can still see it. I-I'm, as I'm\ntalking to you now, I can see the whole horrible picture,\nand it's not nice.\nSWB: So, do you know if there was any message to bring help\nto those people?\nJOHN HOLMES: Oh yes. Our commanding officer, see we had\nradios, in the tanks, and um, we had our hat tracks that had\ncommunication to divisions. And the divisions in turn would\nget the medics up there. And they, the medics would come in\nand they would load these prisoners onto, two anda half ton\ntrucks, by the dozens. And they'd, they would take them",

It is hard to, w",
        "war is uh, I-I think one of the, one of the worst things\nthat has ever happened to this country is that it never got\na chance to fight on its own soil against a formidable\nenemy. It's always gone out, done the fighting on that\nenemy's soil. If the people in this country could actually\nsee what total war is all about in reality, they would have\na different perspective on everything that's around them. I\nthink they would have a little more compassion toward one\nanother, because when you have a race of people who think\nthat they are superior to everybody else, and everybody else\nis dirt underneath their feet, um, you're gonna have, same\nthing, cause one of the things that history says it's\nalways, if you don't remember the mistakes in the past\nyou're going to repeat it all over again. Um. This is\nsomething, this episode over in Germany and France and\nBelgium and Holland and Luxembourg, where I fought in, I\njust couldn't believe that the enemy could be as cruel and\nbrutal as he was. And the thing about it, the Germans, many\nof the Germans right today, don't, do not believe that this\nactually happened, that these, they don't believe that the\nHolocaust, and the young, I-I spoke at the University of\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int.

        "Portland and the University of Seattle and they, so many of\nthe childr- the students out there did not believe that the\nHolocaust really happened. They thought it was just a\nfigment of imag- of their, you know, my imagination when I-,\nand I said look, I said, this is a black man talking to you,\nI said, this, y-y-you're not talking to a white man, I said,\nI'm telling what I fought in and what I saw. I said, I'm\nnot, you, I don't have to ask nobody. What I went through\nand what I saw.\nSWB: Tell me more about the condition of those people that\nyou saw. Were they still people? I mean, what was it that\nbrings you, what is it that is so devastating about that\nscene other than seeing the enemy who was trying to kill you\nwho you had killed.\nJOHN HOLMES: What about it? Those people, that like I said\nbefore, those people could not help themselves. They had no\nhelp from no one. Th-th-they were between a rock and a hard\nplace. You got to do what you're told. The best thing that\never happened t-, what some of them did for us, uh, which I\nthought was th-, waS amazing, is that they sabotaged a lot\nof the German shells and what have you. Cause one of the,\none of the, on our way through the Hartz mountain, I can\nremember that when the Germans dropped uh some mortars in on\nus, not a Single one explode. They didn- they didn't\nexplode at all. Only did we find out later only that there\nwas no fuse to set them off. They just left the fuses out",

They say-, in other words, they actually\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. JOHN HOLMES\nPage 13\nsaved a lot of American lives absolutely, by defusing a lot\nof the German artillery shells and mortar shells. Because,\nat the darndest thing that this, when we crossed the, is it\nthe Rhine, I think it's the Rhine or the Danube, I'm not\nwhich one that it was in the south down there, we crossed\nthis big river on the pontoons, and that was, was a horrible\nthing. I think I would have died a deat- a thousand deaths,\nyou're going to cross this river, and it's like this, and\nyou've got about three or four hundred feet going across the\nriver, and the thing is like this, and you've got a 36 ton\ntank that bobbing up and down, it's kind of worse, but when\nyou got to the other side, and we're in the middle of this\ntown, and we had just got out of that, I had just got out of\nthe turret of my tank, and we were kind of, the guys, y-y\nyou need to stretch your legs a little bit and as, there's",

Not a single one exploded.\nSWB: Go back and tell me again about the people that you\nfound there.\nJOHN HOLMES: Just death, really. They were walking dead,\nas far as I could see. Living dead. I don not know how\nmany of those people in those barracks were dead, but I do\nknow this. That there were many of them. Because you could\nsee them. When you see, wh-when you don't see any ribs\ngoing up and down as you're breathing, and you look down and\nyou, and-and you can smell that too, you know they're dead.\nAnd those that-that are laying there and they're trying to\nstretch their hand out to you and they can't talk, because\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int.

        "And he had to be helped up and helped to move one leg in\nfront of the other. This is how, this is how bad it was.\nIn other words, he was, they-they had to, two-two soldiers,\none with his arm around holding him up, and the other one on\nthe other side holding him up. And-and-and his feet were\nactually dragging basically. All the, other than that all\nthe rest of them were still back in those, in-in those\nbunks. This was. This is a site I'd I-I'd never forgotten\nthat. And what had bothered, w-w-w-w-w-w-one of the amazing\nthings to me was Mrs. Schimmel, Mrs. Schimmel did not\u2019 know\nall of this was going on, cause this was just about, I'd say\nthree quarters of a mile back of her. But I imagine though\nby her being Jewish, she was actually hidden. She assumed\nthe identity of the people that protected her. There's a\nlot of good German people now. I think some of the German\npeople knew what was happening. But she didn't see it.\nCause she didn't know what that, that all of this death and\ndestruction was going on back of her. She could smell it\nbut she didn't know what it was. Far as she was concerned,\nit was some of the bloated animals out there, and not being\na-acclimated to the smell of humans and animals too, I\nimagine she just assumed that it was all just one thing. So\nthis, th-that's all I can attribute it to with her. She was\njust an innocent bystander, and I was often, I was, I kept\nthinking, I said now, how, first of all she said to me, I\nask her, I said Mrs. Schimmel, I said how is it that you\nSurvived this. And she explained to me, she said well they\nprotected me. And she, I think she had assumed their name,",

You don't forget this thing. Number one, you\nhave an enemy to kill. Or else, you're gonna die. You have\none or two choices. But when you see this, and you, and\nthey can't do nothing about what's happening to them, sure\nyou're not going to forget it. You never will. It's\nimpossible to forget something like that. Um, I forget the\nname of the camp down around Munch... Ah-ah- is that, no,\nit's not Auschwitz.",
        "2: Dachau\nJOHN HOLMES: Dachau, that's the one. Um, we had a\nlieutenant, uh, in the outfit, that was at that camp, but he\njust happened, him, he was a, a, his tanks, his column of\ntanks were, were moving through and he asked um, _ the\nsoldiers what was going on inside of there, and that was \u00a3f-\n, that was the only time I ever heard of a concentration\ncamp was when he said th-that that was at Dachau. But like\nI said I never knew what a concentration camp was. I didn't\neven know what a labor camp was. Cause what I was, the only\nthing that we didn't, see we'd never had, we'd never had the\nopportunity, because see we were constantly on the move and,\nyou, and-and-and-and you're shooting and fighting at the\nsame time and it's constant- we had 183 days of combat.
