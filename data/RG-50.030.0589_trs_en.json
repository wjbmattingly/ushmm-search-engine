You brings your eggs to us, and for two and a half cents an egg, we would\nOctober 8, 2010\nhatch those hundred eggs out for you. And then they \u2014 and if you got a hundred\nchicks out of 1t, you\u2019d be lucky. But nobody ever really did get a hundred percent,\nbecause of the eggs were not always fertilized. The rooster wasn\u2019t doing his duty.\nHe had to do that, you know what I mean. So, but that\u2019s what we did, we \u2014 we had\nthousands of chicks. We had two incubators that would hold 10,000 eggs, and we\nhad a hatch come off every Monday and every \u2014 every Monday and Friday. And\nthen we\u2019d take these chicks out, and say like if you had \u2014 oh, we\u2019ll say a hundred\neggs, then we\u2019d call you up and let you know th-that the chickens \u2014 the chicks,\nwhen they\u2019d be ready. Then you\u2019d come and \u2014 and get your chicks and pay us for\nthe chicks \u2014 for \u2014 for the eggs that we hatched, or for all the eggs. Cause if you gave\nus a hundred, well you\u2019d be \u2014 you very seldom get a full hundred percent hatch,\nbecause a lot of them \u2014 a lot of the eggs weren\u2019t even fertilized.",

        "Q: Now, why did you go into the army\u201d?",
        "A: Why did I go in the army? Well, because they told me to, for one reason, and the\nother reason, I wanted to go. I did want in before I got married, but after I got\nmarried, then they took me. Cause see, I\u2019m blind in one \u2014 in this eye, the right eye.\nWhen I was five years old, I\u2014 a guy that didn\u2019t care where he threw his garbage,\nwhat do call them, you know, they got a name. Anyhow, it \u2014 he \u2014 he was going up\nan alley. We lived in tow \u2014 when thes \u2014 this is when we lived in town, before we\nbought the farm, and I was five years old then. And we had a fence around the \u2014\nDad had a fence around the ge \u2014 our yard, and that, and my mother always put me\nout there to play with my toys while she cleaned her house, when I was little. Well,\nthis here guy who were \u2014 whoever it was, was drinking pop, and the \u2014 and his bottle\n\u2014 bottle went empty, I guess, so he just tossed it over the fence into my \u2014 into my\nDad\u2019s yard. And Mom always put me out in the yard, cause it was safe to play\nthere, because it \u2014 she had a lock on the \u2014 on the gate, so I wouldn\u2019t get out and get\nrun over with a car, wi \u2014 which I \u2014 which I did anyhow. I got ran over three times in\ntha \u2014 to be exact. Each car went over me, but none of them the wheels \u2014 only one\nOctober 8, 2010\nthe wheels hit me. Anyhow \u2014 let\u2019s see now \u2014 I wasn\u2019t going to tell you that. Th-Th-\nThe \u2014 the \u2014 so anyway, the \u2014 this time that I got hit twice right \u2014 right in front of our\nhouse, cause it was in the wintertime and we were in \u2014 in a\u2014 was 1n a \u2014 this \u2014 the\noutskirts of the town, like. And my two older brothers, they wanted to go across the\ns \u2014 Ligonier Street, that was the main street going down through Latrobe, and\nmake us new \u2014 new fort, because they want to have a snowball battle. And my\nmother said no, you can\u2019t go, cause if you go over there without Grant, he\u2019s gonna\ngo across the road and get hit with a car. Well, she was right there, because a-and \u2014\nand my dad, my dad was an invalid ever since he was two years old, and his \u2014 he\ngot sick, and his mother took him to the doctors and the doctors gave him the wrong\nmedicine, and he wound up with polio, and he was crippled, and he had walked on\ncrutches all his life from \u2014 well, in s \u2014 he was \u2014 well, I \u2014 I forgot Just how old he\nwas, he wasn\u2019t very old. He was two years old, I think it was. And, he started out on\ncrutches. He walked on them until he was 41 years old, and then \u2014 then here he got\nbursitis in his shoulders, and he couldn\u2019t use his crutches no more, so he went to a\nwheelchair. And he lived in the wheelchair and \u2014 until his death, which was 36\nyears later. And \u2014 but he had a \u2014 an office job, and he worked there 45 years. And I\ntold him whenever he retired, I says, but one thing about Dad, why, none of your\nsons are gonna work as long as you did at one job, because we were all too old for,\nyou know, to get started on it. But that was my dad.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "Q: What year did you enter the army, sir?",
        "A: The army\u201d?",
        "Q: Yeah, what year?",
        "A: Year was \u2014 gosh, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Do you remember your training, what \u2014 what training, army training was like?",
        "A: Yeah, we \u2014 yeah, we \u2014 we ki \u2014 we \u2014 we trained there, you know, I went to\nMaryland, is where \u2014 is where th-the gi \u2014 the recruits went.",
        "Q: Was it difficult for you, army training?",
        "A: Difficult?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Never.",
        "Q: Never.",
        "A: I loved that stuff. I\u2014I liked that, especially when we went out in the firing\nrange, that\u2019s what I liked the best.",
        "Q: Were you a good shot?",
        "A: I became a crack shot, and that \u2014 and then, whenever we finished, when we had\nthe Germans down and \u2014 and they gave up altogether, and the war was over in\nEurope, why then I volunteered to be a sniper. Got out up where \u2014 pretty nice ge \u2014\ncause we were gonna go to Japan. And we were starting to train for them,\nwhenever they dropped the atomic bomb. That made the difference in the whole\nOctober 8, 2010\noutfit, for everybody. And so they \u2014 they \u2014 they canceled everything after that, and\n\u2014 and so when that \u2014 when they dropped that bomb, we couldn\u2019t believe it, one\nbomb could do all that, because we been bombed before, being in the service. And,\noh, they tried to kill me a good many times, but they \u2014 I always out shot them. Let\u2019s\nput it that way. It\u2019s a heck of a thing to do.",
        "Q: Do you believe your \u2014 did your training prepare you for combat, in your \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: It did?",
        "A: Real good.",
        "Q: Can you describe the first experience of combat in your out \u2014 your \u2014",
        "A: Well, the first guy I shot, 1t made me sick, cause I \u2014 when the battle was over, I\nwent up to see, because whenever I \u2014 he was laying behind a log, and he was\nshooting at me, an-and he missed me the first shot, and I ducked down behind a\u2014a\n\u2014a tree. Cause th-the Germans had the ri \u2014 the civilian population had to rely on the\nwoods to keep their fires burning in the wintertime, cause there was no coal for\nthem, or nothing to \u2014 to heat up \u2014 oh, I tell you the \u2014 the German civilians, they took\na beating. And the \u2014 the Germans took the \u2014 all the food, mostly, that they could\nget, ta\u2014 and they didn\u2019t have enough to eat half the time, and the \u2014 that\u2019s the \u2014\nthat\u2019s the civilians. But I\u2019ll tell you, the German civilians were better to us than\nwhat the English were. And we were su-supporting the \u2014 England and everything\nOctober 8, 2010\nelse, and doing all that stuff. Cause I was in England there for nine months, I think\nit was. Anyhow, I was in the military police then, and they \u2014 so I got their bo \u2014 I got\nacquainted with wa \u2014 one of their bobbies, which is, that\u2019s what they call for, you\nknow, police, over there, a bobby. And him and his wife decided to have four of us\ncome to their house for Christmas. Well, that was a pretty good deal, you know, at\nleast we thought so until he \u2014 he says \u2014 well, we were \u2014 I was on like a\u2014a-\u2014a\ndifferent outs \u2014 outfit, because they \u2014 they went and they gave us the st-stamps and\nthat, you know, for th \u2014 to get your \u2014 your vittles to eat. And then \u2014 then you \u2014\nanyhow, he says, do you have any \u2014 any stamps, food stamps, that\u2019s what they\ncalled them. And I says, yeah, I said, I got mine yesterday. He said, let\u2019s see it. And\nI pulled it out and handed it to him, and that was a mistake, because he never gave it\nback to me. He says, well, if you\u2019re coming to eat, he says, we gotta feed you. But I\nwasn\u2019t counting on supplying the food. But anyhow, it was nice, and that was a\ngood gesture. And so he had the four of \u2014 he had four of us come there. And I was\ntelling him \u2014 his wife, she\u2019s just a little squirt, and the \u2014 but she was nice. And she \u2014\nand she\u2019s asking me, you know, like, about my family and all that stuff, and I told\nabout my wife, and that, and she says, well, I\u2019m gonna make her a baby doll. I said,\nwell, that\u2019ll be real nice of you. She said, one of those days itll come rolling up to\nyour house door. So \u2014 but it never came. She forgot about it, or didn\u2019t have a chance\nor something. I don\u2019t know, maybe something happened. But that was nice, and \u2014\nOctober 8, 2010\nbut it didn\u2019t last long. So anyhow, I \u2014 we went and \u2014 and we \u2014 we went on into \u2014 we\ngot a kra \u2014 we went over the \u2014 over there where France was, you know.",
        "Q: When \u2014 when was that? When did you go to France, sir?",
        "A: I-I can\u2019t really say now. I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: Okay. That\u2019s fine.",
        "A: But I was in \u2014 I was in England nine months.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That part I do know. I crossed that ocean four times during the war, and when \u2014\nwe were lucky, we a\u2014 we always \u2014 the Germans always didn\u2019t have a \u2014 their\nsubmarines in the right place, because we\u2019d go across, you know, like a\u2014 a whole \u2014\nwhole mess of ships would go at one time, and oh man, it\u2019d be stuf \u2014 stre \u2014\nstretched out for miles. I saw one going down, where a torpedo, it \u2014 it missed our\nship and \u2014 and hit the one farther away and \u2014 and I \u2014 and I always liked to watch \u2014\nI'd go up to the bow and I\u2019d watch the \u2014 the tor \u2014 the fish, I forget what you call\nthem now, you know, they were big son of a guns, and something like a shark.\nWell, the sharks didn\u2019t like them because they \u2014 they beat up on the sharks. The \u2014\nthe fish are as bad as the human beings, ain\u2019t they? They fight with each other. And\nthey always jumped in front of the ship. Always wondered how the ship kept from\nrunning over them. They didn\u2019t \u2014 never \u2014 we never seen any of them getting hit.\nThey\u2019d just keep diving, you know. And that was interesting there.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "Q: Your unit was instrumental in pushing the Germans back at the Rhine river, you\ncrossed over the Rhine. Do you remember \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember that, crossing over the Rhine?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you talk about that?",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 we \u2014 we just kept \u2014 kept fighting them, that\u2019s all. And they \u2014 they\nfinally gave in, the enemy did. But wha \u2014 I always remember one German lady, she\ncome out on the \u2014 on her porch. We just chased the \u2014 the German soldiers out of\nthis here one town. And when we were going into it, and we stopped for a \u2014 a \u2014 like\na rest, why this lady come out and she says, I want 12 of you men to come in my\nhouse. Well, we didn\u2019t have any idea why she want 12 us men in there. So 12 of us\n[indecipherable], we went in. And she sits us around the table, she goes over to her\noven. In them days the Germans had put in all coal stoves in their kitchens. And she\nopened up the \u2014 the oven, and there\u2019s 12 apples in there she baked, just for us guys.\nAnd she \u2014 she gave each one of us an apple. And I\u2019ll always forget \u2014 I always\nremember that woman. I \u2014 how I wished I would have got her name and address,\nbecause she was so good to us. Then she took me around, I don\u2019t know why she\npicked on me, but she took me around her house, showed me all around in there, her\nhouse and everything. And she had three sons that was in the army, German army.\nOctober 8, 2010\nBut they were all prisoners of war. We had one, and England had one, and the\nRussians had one. I said to her, well, I said, Pll tell you, I says, you\u2019re pretty sure of\ngetting those two \u2014 two of them back out of those three, alive. And I says, now the\none we have and the one the \u2014 the \u2014 at \u2014 let\u2019s see what a \u2014 well, we\u2019ll say England,\nand the one they have, the British, th-the \u2014 I said, the one the British have and the\none we have you\u2019re pretty sure of getting those two back. But, I says, the one that\nthe Russians have, I says, I can\u2019t tell you about them, I said, those guys are nuts. I\nsaid, all they want to do is kill everybody. And so that\u2019s exactly what they did.",
        "Q: Were the Germans good soldiers?",
        "A: You bet they were good soldiers. And when they were shooting those guns, they\nwere dead shots, too. Now I had one shooting at me with a machine gun, cause we\nran a \u2014 he-here\u2019s the way it was. I don\u2019t know whether you know any \u2014 you know\nhow ya \u2014 how the army when they\u2019re \u2014 when you\u2019re tra \u2014 going into a battle like,\nwell, we\u2019re go \u2014 we\u2019re going along, coming up \u2014 up through this field that, and\nsomeone says that \u2014 that the Germans are up ahead somewhere. Well, we always\nhad scouts out, two scouts. They\u2019d be about oh, say, 200 yards ahead of us. Now,\nthey were not supposed to shoot any bra \u2014 any Germans that they seen, but they\nwere supposed to give us the silent signal. The silent signal was a \u2014 y-you laid your\nrifle down, you grabbed ahold of it and \u2014 by the barrel and by the \u2014 and by the back\nOctober 8, 2010\nof it, and you put it above your head and go like that. That 1s your signal that the\nenemy was there.",
        "Q: An up and down movement.",
        "A: Yes, they \u2014 and they \u2014 and they didn\u2019t make a sound. Well, anyhow, then wh-\nwhen we got that message, by boy they just \u2014 they blew a whistle and we just\nspread out and start digging in right away, because we knew we were running into a\ntrap. And so the Germans, they smartened up. They thought by us cat \u2014 by us\nhaving those two scouts there, they were told tr \u2014 told, do not shoot the scouts. Th-\nThe German did. He says, wait til they get through your lines, but make sure they\ndon\u2019t see you to give out and give the \u2014 us the \u2014 the warning. Says go, and \u2014 wait a\nminute now, I think of something about that \u2014 anyhow, he says, let them go through\nyour ra-ranks, but make sure they don\u2019t see you. And then, when they get through\nit, grab them, and then we\u2019ll put them in \u2014 in prison, then, for the \u2014 you know, the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the ten \u2014 well, anyhow, the prison. And so anyway, that\u2019s what they did, cause\nwe lost both of our scouts at first, but we got them back after a bit, cause one of our\nshells went and blew the fence down, and wa \u2014 th-then they shot out of it, and they\ngot back with us again. And they said that when they were \u2014 the Germans ran, he\nsays, we ran right with them. He says, those shells and that you guys were shooting\nat us, well, they didn't give a hoot who they killed. So anyhow they \u2014 the scouts, we\nha \u2014 we had them scouts, but whenever they give that signal, we would \u2014 we would\nOctober 8, 2010\n\u2014 see, we'd be going in the single file, maybe might be three or four in a row, you\nknow how they are when you\u2019re marching. And as soon we got that signal boy, you\ns \u2014 just spread right out. And everybody got their \u2014 we had little shovels. You\nprobably sm \u2014 maybe you seen them already. And we\u2019d dig a foxhole and get down\nin under below the ground surface. And then that \u2014 then the \u2014 we were ready for\nfight then. But if you \u2014 if we didn\u2019t see that signal, why we would walk right into\nthis trap. Now, we ran into one of them traps, and all of a sudden they start\nshooting. And I hit the ground right where I was, you \u2014 whenever \u2014 when they start\nshooting, nobody has to tell you to get down and stay down, you learn that quick,\nbecause you want to live a little longer. So anyhow, we went and \u2014 wait a minute\nnow. We \u2014 well, we \u2014 we got up there an-and then the Germans start shooting at us,\nand we got down and then we start shooting back. Well, I was out, right out in the\nopen spaces there. Well, my buddy was, when he was shooting his rifle, I was\nreloading mine. And when I was shooting mine, he was reloading his. So we had a\nsteady sho \u2014 stream of bullets going up where the machine gunners were. So\nanyhow, they went out and he \u2014 he turns on me. I was laying down on the ground\nshooting there, and I didn\u2019t have no trees or nothing to get behind, I was out in the\nopen. And my buddy, he \u2014 he got the only tree that was there, he \u2014 he dove behind\nit. Anyway, and the Germans saw me. So he turns the machine gun on me. Now, he\n[indecipherable] like, well, we\u2019ll just \u2014 there, there. We'll just say here\nOctober 8, 2010\n[indecipherable] right here. I stretched out this way, see, and up \u2014 the Germans are\nup that way, and he starts shooting at me, and he come about that far away from my\nbody. He dug a hole, a trench with that machine gun, from my head down to my\nfeet, about four inches deep with those bullets. That\u2019s \u2014 an-and I was laying right\nthere, all that dirt was flying in my face and all over my body and that. And I was\ntrying to crawl inside of my helmet, but I wasn\u2019t do \u2014 doing good. My head was\nalready in there. So I got to thinking, if I laid still, he\u2019d think he killed me, and he\u2019Il\ngo and shoot somebo \u2014 at somebody else. So whenever he stopped \u2014 he had to stop\nand reload, you know, and when he\u2019d run out of shells, why he\u2019d take a couple of\nminutes for him to get the new belts 1-in there of shells. Well, while he was doing\nthat, I was lay \u2014 laying there figuring out what I was going to do to him. Anyhow, I\nhad dirt and mud and everything in my face, and all over my body and everything\nelse. The whole way down my body, I was just covered with dirt an-and m-mud,\nyou might say. So anyway, I \u2014 I got a \u2014 while \u2014 while he was shooting, h-he to \u2014 he\nchange his \u2014 his targets then. He looked for somebody that was \u2014 he could see,\ncause he saw me laying there and he figured he\u2019d killed me, see? Well, that worked.\nAnyhow, he starts shooting at somebody else. Now, when he starts shooting at\nsomebody else, I was the only one in the outfit that had rifle grenades. The captain\ncome out to me when we \u2014 fe \u2014 before we started out that day and he says,\nShultheis. I said, yes sir? He says, you\u2019re my grenadier. I said, yes, sir, I said, sir.\nOctober 8, 2010\nHe says, yeah, what do you want? He said \u2014 I said, what\u2019s a grenadier? He ha \u2014 he\nsaid, you\u2019re the guy to stop the tanks. So I pulled one \u2014 I pulled out the gre-grenade,\nhe gave me a ba\u2014 a pa \u2014 a bag like, see, I would call it a bag. Anyhow, it fit over\nyour shoulder and it had six grenades in it; three of them phosphorous and three\nexpl \u2014 high e-explosion. So I said to him, what am I supposed to do with these? He\nsays, you\u2019re supposed to stop the tanks. I picked it out and I said, sir, I said, you\nthink that this little thing here 1s going to stop one of them great big tanks? He says,\nI know it will. I says, what do I shoot at, whenever I shoot at that tank? And he\nsays, the tracks. Now, I never knew this before that \u2014 before that day. He says I \u2014\nwhen the tracks are gone, there\u2019s a \u2014 a little track in the center of the tank, and it \u2014\nand it runs \u2014 it keeps those su \u2014 tracks on the wheels like, even, so that they don\u2019t\ncome off. And he says, all you gotta do is hit that wheel, it\u2019s about that big, he said.\nBut that\u2019s like telling you to go jump in the lake. Anyhow, I said yes, sir, I says, I\nthink we can stop them all right then, 1f we can \u2014 if I can hit that \u2014 if I can just hit\nthat there part where you just told me. And so anyhow, he s \u2014 he \u2014 he agreed with\nme on it. So he went and let me figure it out myself. So \u2014 but I\u2014 I never saw a tank\nafter that. S \u2014 but I did use them on \u2014 on machine guns, and boy it worked good. So\nanyway, this one whose \u2014 this machine gunner that was shooting at me, I th \u2014 I\nthought, if I stop jiggling around here, that th \u2014 that he\u2019II think he killed me,\nbecause he was pretty far away, you know. So, by gollies, it worked. I laid still and\nOctober 8, 2010\nhe sh \u2014 quit shooting at me. I guess he must have stop \u2014 must have ran out of shells\nand he had to put another belt on, and while he was putting that belt on, I\u2014 I-\u2014I\nrigged up my \u2014 my grenade launcher on my rifle, and you shoot those grenades with\na blank. So they told me, they says, for God\u2019s sakes, make sure you don\u2019t have a\nlive round in your rifle when you shoot that, because he says, if you shoot that with\na live round, you\u2019re gonna blow your own head off, whenever you would shoot that\n\u2014 that grenade, he says, instead of it going that way, it would stay right where it was\nand knock your head off. So th-that \u2014 that\u2019s a good \u2014 good lesson. So \u2014 so I never\ndid, I always checked it all \u2014 all the time, make sure. So anyway, I said to my\nbuddy, I says, I\u2019m gonna fix those babies now. And he says yeah, you know, what\nare you gonna do? I says, I\u2019m gonna send them a phosphorous grenade. So I put a\nphosphorous grenade on cause they are \u2014 they were the worst. The high explosions,\nthey were bad, but th \u2014 but the \u2014 the others, they were worse, they \u2014 oh, man, they\nwere miserable. They \u2014 cause when they \u2014 when this phosphorous grenades went\noff, they didn\u2019t quit burning when \u2014 if it hits you. Say like if a \u2014 if it hits you in \u2014 in\nyour arm, that would burn the whole way through your arm. It\u2019Il melt your \u2014 even\nmelt your bones, they said. And that\u2019s how hot it went. Anyway, I said to my\nbuddy, I says, okay, I says, I\u2019m ready to shoot, I says. You watch up over the top of\nthem trees, see if you can see it going. And I stuck the huge \u2014 you always stick the \u2014\nthe stock of your rifle in the ground and raise the barrel up. And I was laying there\nOctober 8, 2010\nbeside it there, and I raised her up, and I said, you wa \u2014 I says, are you watching?\nHe said yeah. I said, well, here it goes. I reached down and I pulled the trigger.\nWell, that grenade, you could see it. I-It goes pretty fast, but you can still see it\ngoing. It went \u2014 oh, it made a beautiful bow right up over the top of the trees and\ncome down. And on the way down, it must have hit a \u2014 a limb, because I don\u2019t\nthink it went off at the ground, because it seemed like it \u2014 when the \u2014 when it\ndisappeared and you couldn\u2019t see it, why, it was \u2014 wasn\u2019t enough time for it to hit\nthe ground when it exploded. But when it exploded, it made a great, big puff of\nsmoke, and flames, and \u2014 and \u2014 and it \u2014 and the phosphorous was everywhere. And\nI heard them guys screaming up there where they \u2014 where I was shooting at, so I \u2014 I\n\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure I hit them, because that was them screaming. Now, I never seen\nany of them, or anything like that, because they were pretty well camouflaged.\nAnyway, we \u2014 we \u2014 that stopped that whole [indecipherable] that whole battle. The\nGermans jumped up after I shot that, and they ran ba-backwards, back over \u2014 to get\naway from us. Our outfit, they \u2014 they got up, they ran back the other way, I ne \u2014 I\nnever figured out yet why they went that way, cause it was a gort in the wrong\ndirection. So anyway, we didn\u2019t see no more Germans that night. And the me \u2014 and\nmy buddy, he s \u2014 he\u2019s young. Come on Shultheis, come on Shultheis, everybody\u2019s\nleaving us. I said, I\u2019m not leaving til I get my rifle reloaded. And I ha \u2014 I had to take\nall my stuff off my rifle, and that \u2014 you know, the launcher and everything, and \u2014 to\nOctober 8, 2010\nget to my rifle to work right with the bullets. And then I put a\u2014 ac-\u2014aclip with\nnine rounds in it, then I was ready to go. Then I stood up, and when I stood up there\nwasn\u2019t a soul around, just him and I. Our men got up, they went the one way and\nthe Germans went the other way. And that\u2019s another thing I never understood, why\nwe went backwards instead of going forward. Anyway, we \u2014 we didn\u2019t have no\nmore problems with them that night. And then \u2014 then my buddy and I, we went\nback to where the \u2014 kind of back to where the machine gunners were and they had\nto stay up all night on guard, so we \u2014 we each dug a slit trench. Now, a slit trench, I\ndon\u2019t know whether you know what a slit trench is or not. Oh, you know? Okay,\nthat\u2019s just where you can lay down in it, it\u2019s big enough. We di \u2014 we dug that, each\none of us dug a bed, you might say. Filled full of leaves and then crawled down in\nunder them leaves and go to sleep. And the \u2014 we let the \u2014 we let the machine\ngunners stay awake that night. So \u2014",
        "Q: Did they soldiers you served with, were they good soldiers?",
        "A: Who?",
        "Q: Your \u2014 your soldiers, the ones you served with.",
        "A: Our si \u2014 our service \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 our soldiers were good soldiers, yes. And \u2014 cause they listened to what the \u2014\nwhat they were told to do, and they did it.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "Q: Do you remember the Dachau concentration camp?",
        "A: Did I remember what, sir?",
        "Q: The concentration camp.",
        "A: Yes, Dachau.",
        "Q: Can you describe coming into contact with that camp?",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it was a big camp. They \u2014 and they say it had 30,000 men and \u2014 and\nwomen in there. And they had a lot of people in there, that you might as well say\nthey starved them to death, practically. Now, whenever we got in there, got the gate\nopen and that, what happened, see, the f\u2014 the first guy in \u2014 1n the line, he saw \u2014 he\nsaw the lock. So he just pulled his rifle up and shot it. And when he hit it, it just\nflew in pieces, cause we was using armor piercing shells at the time, cause we was\ndoing a lot of force fighting \u2014 fighting in to the \u2014 1n the force \u2014 force. Now like \u2014\nwell, say \u2014 say like where they have a \u2014 make the cuckoo clocks. Well, that part\nthere, we were into that, and boy I\u2019Il tell you, no wonder they call that the Black\nForest, cause it is really dark. The sun don\u2019t even get down through the trees.\nAnyhow, we went \u2014 we were on there and we \u2014 and we come and \u2014 and I come to a\n\u2014a-\u2014a German truck, and stand there. And I can see some blankets in there and I\nthought, oh boy, that\u2019d be ideal thing. I climbed up in the truck and it was full of\ndead soldiers and the blood all over everything, oh what a mess. So I got out and let\nOctober 8, 2010\nthe whole bunch go. I let the dead keep the bla-blankets. But that\u2019s just the way\nthings went.",
        "Q: Do you remember which gate you entered at Dachau?",
        "A: Well, there was one gate by \u2014 we came to was \u2014 it was more a \u2014 it was more like\na \u2014 say like a front gate. See, there was a gate here, and then back here, they had the\nfurnaces right here, and \u2014 and then \u2014 then they were over some more buildings here.\nAnd then they had other buildings where, like the prisoners stayed in, inside of that\ngate. Now, the Germans had, I would say, oh, 200 yards of field, all smooth cut.\nThere wasn\u2019t a tree [indecipherable], so that if any of their prisoners escaped, their\nsoldiers were supposed to shoot them and kill them. And they \u2014 and they had a lot\nof time to kill them because they had that whole say \u2014 we\u2019ll say 200 yards to \u2014 to go\nbefore they got to the woods. And so anyhow, I \u2014 the \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 I had a German\nin my sights that I kept in my sights there, because there was three prisoners chasing\nhim after we opened the gates, see? And I said to my buddies, I says, look at that, I\nsays, that German, he\u2019s running away from those guys. And I says, he\u2019s in A-1\nshape and \u2014 and those three guys are in starvation shape, and I said, they\u2019Il never\ncatch him. And he was heading for those woods. So I got down on one knee, took\nthe safety off of my rifle and \u2014 and I just got that guys \u2014 back of his head riding on\nthe top of my front sight. And they said, what are you gonna do, Shultheis? I said,\nI\u2019m gonna knock that guy off if he \u2014 1f it looks like he\u2019s gonna make to the \u2014 to\nOctober 8, 2010\nthose trees. Cause I said, once he gets into those trees, I says, he\u2019s a free man, be an\n\u2014 and because he ga \u2014 he can have a \u2014 a thousand places to hide. And \u2014 and I says, I\ndon\u2019t think those guys are gonna be able to make it. Well, they \u2014 they were doing\npretty good though, they \u2014 they were running and \u2014 and that German soldier was\nrunning, too, because they were after him. Anyhow, I \u2014 I noticed that the gap was\ngetting closer, see, they were gaining on him. And I said to one of the guys, I says,\nwell, I says, I guess I won\u2019t have to shoot him after all. I says, I think they\u2019re gonna\nmake it. So they \u2014 here they caught him before he got to the trees. Now, if I\u2014if I\nthought he was going to make it to the trees, I was going to shoot him, because he \u2014\nhe probably did a lot of things to those guys, and it didn\u2019t matter to me; he was a\nGerman, so that\u2019s \u2014 he was \u2014 there was no limit on him. You could shoot as many\nas you want to.",
        "Q: What did the prisoners do when they caught up with him?",
        "A: Oh, the \u2014 well, they grabbed him. That\u2019s one thing they did do. One guy grabbed\none arm, and the other guy \u2014 another guy, he grabbed the other arm, and the third\none, he took the pistol from the German and shot him in the head. That was the end.\nThat German, he was screaming his head off. And then all of a sudden you heard\nthe bang. Then I saw the head drop down whenever he shot him. Now, they were \u2014\nwell, the he \u2014 they were pretty close to the woods. He come pretty close to have me\nhelp him, but I didn\u2019t have to. They did a good job themself.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "Q: When you first entered the camp, what did you think you were seeing? Did you\nknow what the camp was? Did you know wha \u2014 why \u2014 what its purpose was?",
        "A: Well, we weren\u2019t quite sure what the camp name was, or anything like that. It\njust happened to be in the la \u2014 1n our line of fire as we \u2014 as we went \u2014 marched\nalong. Cause we just go up one mountain and down another one.",
        "Q: What did you f \u2014 what did \u2014 when \u2014 what did you think when you first saw the\nprisoners, when you entered th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the camp?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t believe anyone could be so rotten. That\u2019s what I thought.",
        "Q: Did you communicate with any of the prisoners, did you talk to anyone?",
        "A: Well, no, we didn\u2019t get a chance to, cause we were always dra \u2014 always after the\nGermans \u2014 soldiers, and na \u2014 and \u2014 and we \u2014 we \u2014 what we wanted to do, we\nwanted to keep them moving so they didn't have time to dig in and put a row of\nmachine guns across our path. Na \u2014 so what they did, they went and they gave their\nmen orders to make sure they hide good, and camouflage themselves and\neverything, so the \u2014 the \u2014 so that our \u2014 our two men that was in the lead, didn\u2019t see\nthem. And when he get to the other side of the Germans, grab them, and then put\nthem in the concentration camp.",
        "Q: So what \u2014 you were actually fighting the Germans while inside the camp?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And did you \u2014 how long did that last, how long did that battle last?\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Not very long, cause we went straight through, cause we were \u2014 we were chasing\nthe Germans at the time, and then we wanted to keep them from pa \u2014 getting \u2014\ngetting a \u2014 a trap set for. But we still \u2014 we ran into one of them. And that was a \u2014\nthe one where I was just telling you about where he almost shot me. And so \u2014 but he\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 he didn't hit me. That was the main thing.",
        "Q: Did any of the Germans attempt to surrender to you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, they fought right to the end. They were \u2014 they were good fighters, Ill tell\nyou that.",
        "Q: Did you look around the camp? Did you just actually see any of the barracks or\nthe crematoria?",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 what we could see, wa \u2014 you couldn\u2019t see too much at first, because\nit was like boarded off like, you know, say like the dead, and stuff like that. Now,\nthey had a big pile of dead laying in there. We saw tha \u2014 I saw that. But we no more\nthan got into the gate, I\u2019d say oh, I don\u2019t know how far in we got, not very far. But\nwhen you come through the gate, then you saw the furnaces. And then \u2014 an-and \u2014\nand the \u2014 the dead was piled up a pile, right out there in the ground, just laying on\ntop of each other. And what they were doing, they were taking them and they was\nputting them in the fire and burning them. But I guess it made a terrible smell,\nOctober 8, 2010\nbecause they said that the \u2014 the German population was complaining, because it\nstunk so bad, you know, from the \u2014 the bodies being cooked.",
        "Q: How long were you inside the camp?",
        "A: How long was I what?",
        "Q: Inside the camp.",
        "A: Oh, about maybe 15 minutes at the most. Because see we \u2014 like I said, we were\nchasing the Germans so that \u2014 and at the time and we didn\u2019t want them to like make\n\u2014 have time to dig 1n trenches and that for their machine guns and that. And so we\ndidn\u2019t stay. So we were \u2014 we were brought out right away. Probably some of them\ndidn\u2019t even get in there, some of the men. But \u2014",
        "Q: Can you describe how you came across that key?",
        "A: Oh yes. I was \u2014 I was going int \u2014 into the \u2014 into the n \u2014 n \u2014 around the fence\nway, you know, in \u2014 into the camp, we\u2019ll call it. And here I happened to look down\nand I saw this key laying there. And th-the people coming out of \u2014 out, was running\nright across it. And \u2014 and the G.I.s that was going into the camp walked over top of\nit too. Now, I was in a couple times in fra \u2014 like \u2014 well, let\u2019s see, where they \u2014\nwhere they had the \u2014 had the shoe mines and stuff, they had [indecipherable] mine\n\u2014 [coughs] Excuse me. And the Germans were great for that there \u2014 having mine\nfields for us to walk onto. Only once that I got real, real close to losing a foot. But\nthe lieutenant saved my hide. He \u2014 he was right behind me and here he happened to\nOctober 8, 2010\nlook down and he saw I was gonna just step on one. And all he did\n[indecipherable] he says, Shultheis, he says, stop immediately, he said\n[indecipherable] he said, stop, he says, a mine on \u2014 a mine there. And a \u2014 and I was\ncoming down with my foot and I froze right there, I never went another inch. And I\nlooked down and there was a mine. If it wasn\u2019t for him, I would have a wooden leg\nnow. He saved my li \u2014 my hide there. And the first \u2014 first one \u2014 time, why we were\ngoing, we had our \u2014 we started at three o\u2019clock in the morning, it was pitch dark.\nWe got out of our foxholes and the captain says, now, you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re to bring back\n\u2014 we\u2019re gonna \u2014 to bring back some Germans alive. And he \u2014 and he says, for\nGod\u2019s sakes, and a few other words that you\u2019re not supposed to say, and he says,\ndon\u2019t shoot them all, he says, we want to \u2014 we want to question them. He says,\nwe're gonna \u2014 we\u2019re gonna g-go \u2014 we\u2019re gonna go after them about right, and he\nsays, we want to know what we\u2019re gonna run into. So, anyhow, I \u2014 tha-that\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s how that one went. Anyway, we \u2014 we went across the field then, and \u2014 and\nthe \u2014 the one scout stepped on a mine. Now, he was about, I\u2019d say two \u2014 maybe a\nhundred yards ahead of us. Well, we didn\u2019t know what happened, we just heard the\nexplosion, so we stopped, and the lieutenant s-scattered us guys around \u2014 around\nthis place where \u2014 where that noise come from, and you hear \u2014 what it was was one\nof the \u2014 the scouts. Anyhow, I said to him, I said, sir, I said, I\u2019ll go in there and [Il\nget that guy, and Ill bring him out. He said okay, but he says, wait a minute til we\nOctober 8, 2010\nget you a medic, he says, you\u2019re gonna need it. I said, all right. So he told his\nsergeant what to tell his men. The sergeant went over, he told the first guy, sa \u2014\nmedics wanted up front. And they passed it down the line, like the guy behind him\nand you know, like that. And then I took a few minutes and \u2014 and the medic come\nup. So the medic come out when I told him. I said, th \u2014 one of the scouts has some \u2014\nhe went haywire in here, I says. We don\u2019t know exactly what it is yet, and the\nlieutenant told me to wait til you got up here because I\u2019m going in after him and\nbring him out. And he says, okay, he says, let\u2019s go. So I says, all right. So we went\nin and there \u2014 and I found him right away, he was laying by a bush, and he had one\nleg \u2014 one foot off. That\u2019s what those shoe mine were for. The Germans discovered\nit take at least four guys to get a\u2014 a wounded guy back to the rear, and that\u2019s four li\n\u2014 guys less shooting at hi \u2014 at his men. So, anyhow, we got the \u2014 th-the medic\nbandaged his \u2014 his stump up, and we got him up on his one good foot. And I had the\n\u2014 I had his arm around th \u2014 my neck and \u2014 and the medic had th \u2014 had a 0 \u2014 the\nother around and the \u2014 and we just ready to start out and he says, I could carry him\nbetter if I was on your side, he says, do you want to trade? I says sure, I says, I can\ncarry him no matter which side. So \u2014 so anyhow, we chi \u2014 we swi \u2014 switched. I took\nhis arm off my neck, I went over and got his other arm, put it around my neck, the\nmedic come on around. He puts his \u2014 put the other arm \u2014 his other arm around his\nneck, and na \u2014 and I says, are you ready to go? And he says yeah. So the medic\nOctober 8, 2010\nsays, all right, let\u2019s go. Well, he took one step and he blew his foot off. Right where\nI was standing, I don\u2019t know how I missed it. I never even seen th \u2014 a mine there.\nAnd he\u2019s the only guy of all of them that I saw wounded that cried up \u2014 up front, on\nthe line. And here, when he went in \u2014 when they sent him home after they got his\nartificial foot and that, why, he drank himself to death. And he \u2014 and his mother\nsays that he couldn\u2019t stand being crippled.",
        "Q: Getting back to the \u2014 to the \u2014 the camp, and the concentration camp, so you\ncontinued to pursue the Germans out of the camp?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And did you come into contact with any of the surrounding population around\nthe camp?",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we never had no \u2014 n-no trouble like that, see? Most of it was, they\nwere in like fields and stuff like that, and woods. And there weren\u2019t too much house\nto house fighting, we didn\u2019t do much of that.",
        "Q: What wa \u2014 wha-what is your most vivid memory of the camp?",
        "A: Well, I guess it was that \u2014 I guess it was just the part \u2014 well, I \u2014 I'll tell you the \u2014\nthe \u2014 my most memory of that is, is whenever they were shooting at us, and \u2014 and if\nyou didn\u2019t shoot back, why you\u2019d \u2014 you\u2019d wind up in the graveyard. And I had an\nM-1 rifle they gave me, that was a wonderful gun. Boy oh boy, when you put a\nOctober 8, 2010\nsight on that, why he was a goner. Now I had chances of shooting more than what I\ndid, but I captured them mostly, and I turned them over to the officer in charge.",
        "Q: What did the prisoners do? Did they \u2014 did they attempt to escape the camp itself\nwhen you entered, or did they stay where they were inside the camp?",
        "A: The prisoners?",
        "Q: Yes, the prisoners.",
        "A: Th-They \u2014 they were \u2014 they \u2014 they would say \u2014 they were ha \u2014 they had an\nstationary, and the \u2014 and they always somehow, I don\u2019t know just how, they put the\n\u2014 put these men in there. Cause actually I really never seen them put them in, they \u2014\nthey \u2014 they gi \u2014 prisoners were standing there and then they \u2014 they went over to\nmake sure he didn\u2019t have no weapons on him. And so \u2014 now, I captured quite a few\nGermans. I captured six at a time, three different times by myself. And so anyhow,\nth \u2014 I\u2014I\u2014I never had any trouble with any of them that I captured. And they \u2014 they\n\u2014 now, I went into a place \u2014 well, here we \u2014 they said to us this \u2014 one day the\ncaptain come on, he says, well, you guys is go-gonna get a ride today. And \u2014 and it\nwas darn near getting dark, and \u2014 and we \u2014 we were \u2014 we were gonna get a ride to \u2014\nanyhow, he says, I want 12 men on every tank. So that\u2019s \u2014 we had to ride on the\nother side of the tank. We rode all night long, never stopped once. And oh man, we\nwere about froze. It was snowing and blowing and that. So we stopped at daybreak\nand we were in a wide open field. It was all \u2014 like it was big, big gl \u2014 hay field, see?\nOctober 8, 2010\nAnd there was been \u2014 been mowed. So \u2014 so then we stopped, the guys bailed off of\nthat tank and ran to a woods which was about approximately a hundred yards away\nto get wood to build a fire. Everybody else was \u2014 you know, we \u2014 we were darn\nnear froze to death. So anyhow, I heard him tell the sergeant, just look at them guys.\nEvery one of them, he says, go over there and heading for them woods and they left\ntheir weapons here on the ga \u2014 on the tank. [coughs] Excuse me. And so I thought,\noh well, if they can all go in there, I says, I think I\u2019ll go, too. So I slid down off the\ntank and \u2014 but only I took my rifle with me, they didn\u2019t, cause they wanted to have\ntheir arms free to carry wood back to make a fire. So I go over there and here I get\ninto the woods and the \u2014 and the Germans had trenches dug the whole way along\nthat [indecipherable] there. Oh, it must have been a mile long, pretty near. And \u2014\nand that \u2014 and the \u2014 and the ditches, the trenches weren\u2019t real deep, but deep enough\nwhat they could lay down in it and you wouldn\u2019t be able to hit \u2014 see \u2014 even see\nthem, let alone shoot them.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: And so anyhow, here they moved out the night before, or we would have been in\nhot water right there. So, I got over there near these guys running around like\nIndians, like a bunch of nuts gathering wood. They took it all back and t-t-t \u2014 to the\ntank and made a fire. Well, I see a shanty in there. I \u2014 oh, I\u2019ll be darned, I think PI\ngo see what\u2019s in that. I went over and I opened the door and I went in. Here was a\nOctober 8, 2010\ntool shed, like shovel, pick and rake and stuff like that. And so I went out and shut\nthe door and [indecipherable] there was three loaves of homemade bread and\nGerman bread there on a shelf. Well, I didn\u2019t bother them, but I thought about\neating one of them. And I walked around the \u2014 around the building, there\u2019s another\ndoor. I opened up and I walked in and holy man I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. Six\nGermans in there in bed, all sound asleep. I went around \u2014 let\u2019s see, how\u2019d I do\nthat? Oh, I went around, I put my hands under each one of their pillows to see if\nthey had any weapons in there, like a pistol or a dagger or something like that,\nbecause I was out numbered six to one right there, and they could have killed me\nreal easy. So anyway, there was nothing. So then I went around again, and I took\nthe top blanket and pulled it down to their ankle. They never opened their eyes, they\njust sit up in bed, got all that blanket, pulled it back down and \u2014 and laid back down\nagain. I said, well alright you guys, you don\u2019t want to wake up, well, P\u2019ll wake you\nup. So I reached in my pocket and I pulled out a phosphorous hand grenade. I pulled\nthe pin out of it and I held the lever down on \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether you know\nanything about grenades. Oh, you do? You know how you hold it down? Well, I\nwas hanging onto it. I had my hand 1n the coal stove, they had a coal stove there,\nlike a potbelly stove. And what I was gonna do 1s drop that grenade in there and\nbeat it out of that darn sh-shed. And all of a sudden I heard, all right Shultheis,\nwhat in the hell are you gonna do now? I says, oh, here is my sergeant, he come\nOctober 8, 2010\nlooking for me. So I said, these guys won\u2019t wake up, I said, \u2019'm ga \u2014 I\u2019m just gonna\nwake them up, that\u2019s all. He says, well, what are you doing with your hand in the\nstove? Well, there was no fire in the stove, it was out, so I s \u2014 told him about it and I\nsays, I got a hand grenade here and I got the pin pulled out and I \u2014 and you\u2019re in my\nroute, get the heck out of that doorway, because I said, I got nine seconds to g \u2014\nfrom the time I let go of that grenade, before it goes off. And I want to be out of\nhere and get into one of those trenches out there before it explodes. And so here, in\nour talking, one \u2014 one of them Germans woke up. He\u2019s sitting up there in the top f \u2014\ntop bunk, his legs hanging down, he\u2019s rubbing his eyes, you know. And I walk over\nto him. And he never seen me and he had his \u2014 both hands up there, rubbing his\neyes there, getting the cobwebs out of them, I guess. And when he opened \u2014 took\nhis hands down, he\u2019s looking right down the barrel of my rifle. I says, all right, I\nsays, the war\u2019s over for you guys. I said, get the ba \u2014 get them out of that beds. He\nsaid one word, brrp, they all just jumped right out of bed so quick and they all\nlanded in the middle of the floor. There they are, all standing there with their long-\njohns on and a pair of socks, that\u2019s all they had on. I says, as of right now, you are\nall prisoners of war. And here, in the meantime, my tanks th \u2014 they were getting\nready to take off, they \u2014 I heard the motors starting up out there. They w \u2014 they\u2019d sit\nthere for awhile to you know, get them warmed up. And I said to them, shake it up,\nand get your clothes on fast, I said, the tanks are getting ready to pull out and I don\u2019t\nOctober 8, 2010\nfeel like walking any more. So, I said, \u2019'm going outside, and you come out when\nyou get dressed. But, I said, don\u2019t hesitate, shake it out. So they got \u2014 th-th-they \u2014\nthey were \u2014 they oper \u2014 they c-cooperated pretty good. They come out and as each\none would come out I would, you know, shake them down and see if I could feel\nany pistols or knives on them and that and none of them had any on. And I \u2014 and I\nshowed them the tank that I was on. I says, now, I says, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the \u2014 the one\nI want to go on, that\u2019s the one I belong to. Either head for that th \u2014 tha \u2014 for \u2014 for\nthat there Lanair(ph). And they said okay, so I said, all right, four [indecipherable]\ndudes, they got into a part, and so I had the six of them there. And the one says,\nthere are three loaves of homemade bread in there, can I go get them? I says, no. I\nsays, we don\u2019t have time to get them. I said, you hear them motors running down\nthere? I said, them tanks are ready to take off. And I said, they\u2019re not gonna wait for\nme. But when I brought them out, and they saw me coming out of the woods with\nsix prisoners, they s \u2014 they slowed their motors down and waited. And I took them\nover and I gave them to the \u2014 gave them to the lieutenant there at our tank, and that\nwas the last I ever seen them, so I don\u2019t know how they made out, or what they did\nwith them.",
        "Q: Going back to the \u2014 the camps, sir, you said you were in there for 15 minutes?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were you fighting the entire time, and if so, what was the intensity of the fight?\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: No, I \u2014 there was nothing there to shoot at, the Germans were \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014\nthey weren't \u2014 they weren't in the camp or nothing when they got \u2014 when we got\nthere.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: When they knew we were coming they moved out to another place, that I don\u2019t\nknow for sure now whether we ran into them or not, because we was always\nrunning into a bunch of them somewhere.",
        "Q: Did you take any photographs when you were inside of the camp?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Did you take any photographs when you were inside the camp?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know. They \u2014 th-they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 I don\u2019t think it was any\ninside of the camp whenever we were there. On-Only maybe the guards and stuff\nlike that. But we didn\u2019t even see the guards, I don\u2019t know where in heck they\ndisappeared to.",
        "Q: How were the prisoners behaving?",
        "A: Well, they were pretty weak, for one thing. And they were \u2014 they were \u2014 they\ncooperated and they\u2019d tell us where anybody was, and all that stuff. They showed us\nhow they had to sleep on bare boards and that, they didn\u2019t have no blankets, and\nheck, it was wintertime. Gee whiz, they must have froze to death trying to sleep\ntogether. They \u2014 th-that\u2019s the \u2014 that\u2019s the way it was, they \u2014 they had a hard life.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "Q: And they were speaking to you in English?",
        "A: Yes, at \u2014 that\u2019s what a \u2014 that\u2019s what amazed me. Those Germans, they could\nspeak English as good as we could, yeah. They must \u2014 I guess they have a \u2014 have a\n\u2014all that in school, and that.",
        "Q: Was there ever a time that you \u2014 that you felt threatened by any of the prisoners,\nor \u2014",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Okay. And did your \u2014 did you \u2014 did your unit call for medical assistance for the\nprisoners? Did you get food and provisions into them, or \u2014",
        "A: Me-Medicine, and that?",
        "Q: Yes, exactly.",
        "A: No, we \u2014 I \u2014I don\u2019t know whether they did it after we pulled out or not, but we\ndi \u2014 we didn\u2019t stop for that. But our \u2014 our job was to keep them running so they\ndidn\u2019t get a chance to dig in. Now, this one, where I was telling you about how they\nwere shooting at me that time, well, that was one of them, one of the places we\ncaught up to them. But there, what they did, they captured our \u2014 our s-scouts and th-\nthen they found out that the w-wa \u2014 from them, I guess, what wa-was behind them,\nwhich was us. [coughs] Excuse me. And \u2014 but we \u2014 we managed pretty good, I\nthought \u2014 [break] that, you know, is down, I\u2019m telling you.",
        "Q: Yes.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Boy, you\u2019re gonna have a lot to sa \u2014 listen to.",
        "Q: Indeed. When \u2014 were you in Europe on V-E day, at the end of the war in\nEurope?",
        "A: Well, I-I imagine I wa \u2014 wa \u2014 oh yeah, I was over in \u2014 I was in England, cause\nthat\u2019s where I got ba \u2014 that\u2019s where I got into the infantry.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: See, I wanted to be in the infantry anyhow, and they \u2014 so they put me in with the\n42\u21224 Rainbow division. And \u2014 and if you were over there, maybe even \u2014 maybe you\nwas even in that. Was you in the Ra-Rainbow division, or weren\u2019t you?",
        "Q: Now, where \u2014 how did you hear that the war was over?",
        "A: Oh, the \u2014 oh, the \u2014 when they dropped the bomb. That\u2019s when the \u2014 cause I was\n\u2014I was going to school then, over there, cause that \u2014 the wa \u2014 the war was already\nover there. The Germans told me when the war was over, but I blame near shot the\nguys, cause I figure he was a German and that he\u2019s the guy to shoot. So, I started to\nhear these trucks coming down through the fields and that with the headlights on,\nand it was \u2014 it was daylight. Anyhow, I thought, who in the \u2014 we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t\nunderstand because we didn\u2019t get wind of any war being over. The Germans were\nthe ones that told us the war was over. Anyhow, this \u2014",
        "Q: Were they German soldiers who told you, or civilians who told you the war was\nover?\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Soldiers.",
        "Q: The soldiers.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: As they were retreating, or \u2014",
        "A: They \u2014 they were coming down, they were coming back from the front lines\ntheirselves and they\u2019re coming right into \u2014 into our section where we were at. And I\nblame near s-start shooting at them, because after all, they were my \u2014 my enemies.\nAnd \u2014 and this one \u2014 and this one soldier said to me, he was sitting in the back of\nthe truck, he says, didn\u2019t you hear the news? I said no, what news? He says, the war\nis over. I says, it is? I said, nobody told me about it. He \u2014 that\u2019s how I found out,\nfrom the Germans, that the war was over.",
        "Q: How did you feel?",
        "A: Pretty darn good. I was still alive.",
        "Q: How long did it take before you were shipped home?",
        "A: Not very long, I\u2019d say \u2014 well, maybe a week, two weeks at the most.",
        "Q: And did you go immediately back to Latrobe?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Tell me about seeing your wife for the first time.",
        "A: Oh, that, that was \u2014 that was heaven. I \u2014 I was up at the [indecipherable] that\u2019s\nwhere they bought me, when I got off the ship. We got on the ship when \u2014 and I \u2014\nOctober 8, 2010\nand darn if I didn\u2019t get seasick on the dumb thing. And I crossed that ocean four\ntimes. An \u2014 anyhow, we ca\u2014I come and I got on the train, and the train conductor,\nI said to him, does this train stop in Latrobe? He says no. I said, well where does it\nstop at? Pittsburgh. Well, I said, Pittsburgh, I said, it\u2019s just as far as \u2014 I was in\nJohnstown at this time. An-And he told me, you know, that he stopped at\nJohnstown and the next stop was Pittsburgh. And I said, I don\u2019t want to get off at\nPittsburgh. Well, he says, that\u2019s tough luck, he says, the train doesn\u2019t co \u2014 stop\nanywhere else. So what I did, I \u2014 I hitchhiked home. And here I \u2014 first there was a \u2014\na young couple, they brought their bro \u2014 the girl\u2019s brother, I think it was, back. He\nwas going back into the service again, he was out on furlough. And this was in\nJohnstown. So then I \u2014 so that the \u2014 when my train come then, why, I asked the\nconductor, I said, th-this \u2014 does this train stop in Latrobe? He says no. I said, well,\nwhere does it stop at? He says Pittsburgh. I said, well heck, that\u2019s too far away. I\nsaid, that\u2019s about as far as I am now, and \u2014 cause Johnstown and Pittsburgh about\nthe same distance. So anyhow, instead of going \u2014 coming home on the train, I\nhitchhiked a ride. And this young couple that brought her brother back to \u2014 to leave\non the train there in Johnstown, why they picked me up and they took me so far,\nand then I was stuck, I was out on the highway there, and there was \u2014 there was\nsnow, and the blowing, and I was about freezing to death, and anyhow, I-I was\nstanding there thumbing, you know, and here comes a trailer truck with a bighearted\nOctober 8, 2010\nguy behind the wheel. He stopped. He said, how far you going there Joe? And I\nsays Latrobe. He says, hop in, he says, I\u2019m going past there practically, he says. So\nI jumped in there and \u2014 and \u2014 and we stopped at one place there and he got coffee\nand that \u2014 and I called my wife up, it was after \u2014 after midnight then. I said, I\u2019m\ngetting closer [indecipherable] I said, I\u2019m co \u2014 I\u2019m a-coming. So then yeah, I says,\nhe\u2019s gonna let me off here at \u2014 you know when you get to \u2014 on the highway out\nthere where it comes to Latrobe. And I says, y \u2014 he said he\u2019d let me off there. And\nI said, we\u2019ll be there in a little while, I says, he stopped to get a cup of coffee, and I\nsays, then \u2014 and then we\u2019ll be on our way. Well, he di \u2014 he lets me off at \u2014 right at\nthe crossroads there, and when he pulled out, here comes a \u2014 the old Ford out with\nmy wife in it. My wife and two of her aunts and her brother, and he was driving the\ncar. I\u2019ll always remember him, he says, you sure you got the right guy? So anyhow,\nthat was our \u2014 my trip home. Then I went down to my \u2014 my dad\u2019s place to see my\nmother and dad, and that was al-almost three o\u2019clock in the morning. And then\nMom says to me, she says, [indecipherable] here, you take my bed, you and Jenny\ntake my bed and I'll go sleep with Dad. So that\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s the way we did then,\nfor that night. Boy, it \u2014 it was wonderful being home, I\u2019Il tell you. She come a-\nrunning \u2014 she come running out of the car and she met me the halfway on \u2014 on the \u2014\non the highway. We were standing out there necking and it\u2019s a wonder we didn\u2019t get\nrun over. But it was \u2014 1t was something though, to see her again. I said, see, I told\nOctober 8, 2010\nyou I was going to g \u2014 make it home. But I had quite a few times \u2014 I even had an\nairplane shooting at me. He \u2014 he \u2014 he was strafing our \u2014 our outfit. We were co \u2014\nwe were in a convoy, and then \u2014 and again I was up riding on the tank. We did a lot\nof tank riding. And here he comes down the line, and at first \u2014 we were \u2014 first saw\nhim, why the one guy says, ah look, here come one of our fighter planes. Well just\nabout the time we looked, he opened up both guns on his plane, you know, he had\none on each wing. And \u2014 well, there is only one wing, it was only one wing on\nthem, I think. Anyhow, on the side of propeller was a machine gun. Now, when we\nsaw the bu \u2014 the tracers coming out of that \u2014 out of those wings, we knew that he\nwas not our friend at all. So anyway, I went and I put a\u2014a-\u2014a rifle grenade on my\nrifle. I hurry up and got that on and got it all ready for him. I was ga \u2014 because heck,\nhe was only about as high as the ceiling here. And so he\u2019s coming down, he was\nshoo \u2014 he \u2014 he did some damage and he killed a few guys, but \u2014 but he missed me.\nAnyhow, the guys all jumped off that tank but me. I stayed on and I \u2014 me and the \u2014\nand the machine gunner. I wanted to see that machine gunner bring that plane down.\nHeck, he was only that high, I was \u2014 couldn\u2019t see how he could possibly miss it. So,\nwe could see his bullets going \u2014 going down, you know, and when they were \u2014\nwhen he was shooting at \u2014 at all the rest, you know, as he\u2019s coming down the line.\nSo anyhow, I \u2014 let\u2019s see now. Oh, I\u2019m already with the grenade, that\u2019s it. So I got it\nready for him and I had the safety off of my rifle, and I had it to my shoulder, and I\nOctober 8, 2010\nhad that \u2014 had the play up \u2014 taken up on the \u2014 on the trigger. All I had to do is just\nput a little bit of pressure on it and it would have went off. So, when I s \u2014 looked at\nhim, and I says, heck sakes, this here \u2014 this grenade is supposed to cover a 50 foot\ndiameter, you know, like a circle. And I said, if I hit him, I\u2019m going to blow my\nown head off. I said, that\u2019s not going to be any good. So I didn\u2019t shoot. But I was\ngoing down there and \u2014 down there because a-another plane come right behind him,\nand the guys start shooting at him. And here he \u2014 he pulled his plane up so you\ncould see the bottom of his wings, where he had our insignia on it. And th-the\nAmerican insignia was a flag. And so then they, course, they stopped shooting at\nhim. So then I watched him and when he come down a piece, went a piece, why I \u2014\nI don\u2019t know how that German knew that guy but \u2014 that guy was behind him \u2014 but\nanyway, he climbed for altitude. Now he went up, I would say, approximately a\nthousand feet. Now ma \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 might be a way off, but anyhow, when he made\na circle, well the \u2014 the other di\u2014 guy who made a circle, the German, so did our\nman right behind him, when he circled. And he ga-gave two bursts out o-of his \u2014 his\n\u2014 his \u2014 our man did, at the German plane. Well, he hit him both times, and when he\nhit him, I was watching him and the \u2014 the \u2014 when he shot first, why all of a sudden\n\u2014 the plane was going like this \u2014 all of a sudden the nose dropped down, and \u2014 and\nthe plane was going down, it was heading towards the ground then. So th \u2014 our\nplane didn\u2019t shoot no more after. But the farther down he come, the more smoke\nOctober 8, 2010\ncome out of that plane. And then finally it hit the ground and it exploded. Well, I\nwatched that plane the whole way down and when it exploded, but it \u2014 th-the \u2014 the\ndriver, he-he never made it out. And he was only a young fella too, because when\nhe come down and passed there at one time, I saw him sitting in there with both\nthumbs on the \u2014 on the triggers, when he was shooting at me. And I thought, if I\nstand still, he\u2019Il miss me. Well, I had the bullets coming both sides of me. Well, the\none \u2014 the one side, he got pretty close at getting me on that one, because I was\nleaning against the \u2014 the duffle bags of the \u2014 of the g-g \u2014 G.I.s in the \u2014 in the tank.\nThey had them strapped to the [indecipherable] o-on the \u2014 on the outside of their\ntank. And two bullets went though that \u2014 that there tank I wa \u2014 or that sleeping bag\nthat I was leaning on. But I didn\u2019t know that until after he was gone. So he missed\nme again.",
        "Q: When you returned home, did you talk to any of your family about your\nexperiences in the war?",
        "A: About being in the war?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yeah. They got tired listening to me. They were just glad I was home.",
        "Q: What did you do after the war?",
        "A: I went back to working on the \u2014 on the farm for my dad.",
        "Q: And how long did you do that?\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 I also worked on a farm too. And I got a farm second day I was home,\nand \u2014 milking cows and stuff like that, because I liked farming. The only thing was\nthe pay, and \u2014 and then the \u2014 when the war was over, why the prices started\nclimbing, you know, and so I \u2014 my wife and I talked it over, we thought it\u2019s time I\ngot a raise. I was making a hundred dollars a month, and I got my house included in\nit. So I went to the farmer \u2014 farmer that I was working for, and I says, how about a\nraise? I says, the price of living\u2019s going higher, and my family was getting bigger\nnow, I \u2014 cause I had \u2014 I had two \u2014 two children right 1n a row, one right after the\nother practically. And I \u2014 and I had a daughter and a \u2014 and a son. And so, course I\nmade extra \u2014 the expenses. He says, oh, you just had to tell me Jenny is \u2014 that was\nmy wife\u2019s name \u2014 she\u2019|l have to live within her means. Oh boy, did she blow up\nwhen I told her that. That didn\u2019t \u2014 that didn\u2019t the \u2014 hit right. So anyhow, I looked\naround, I started looking around, and I\u2019ve si \u2014 and I found a \u2014 a guy owned a horse\nfarm, a Mr. Steiner, Steiner was his name, and I went to see him. Oh, he says, how\nmuch do you want paid? Well, I was making a hundred and \u2014 hundred and five\ndollars a month before, and I says 200 dollars a month. He says all right, and he\ntook it. So I was \u2014 I worked with him then for oh, a good while. And \u2014 but so then\nhere, after we \u2014 after we lived there, we lived in \u2014 right on the farm, the horse farm,\nwe had about 40 horses. And he had good horses there, well \u2014 well bred stock. And\nso I went and \u2014 well, he \u2014 he went and he \u2014 he wanted my wife to do a lot of stuff\nOctober 8, 2010\nfor nothing. And he was a millionaire himself, the bugger. So anyhow, you\u2019d \u2014 she\n\u2014 she \u2014 sh-sh \u2014 it wa \u2014 it wa \u2014 it was out of this world. She wasn\u2019t able to do that\nbecause she was taking care of like \u2014 say like me and my \u2014 my \u2014 well, my \u2014 my\nsister \u2014 my daughter and son. I had a daughter and a son then. So then they \u2014 they\nwere \u2014 they were \u2014 they were born, a-and whenever \u2014 whenever we got the job \u2014\nwell, I got the job, and so I was working, I was taking care of these horses. We had\nabout 40 horses altogether. And I liked that job, it was pretty nice. But the only\nthing is, he wanted her to do a lot of extra work. Now, he was used to having fellas\nthere that had foreign women for wives. They went in and they did all that work for\nnothing, and that\u2019s what he wanted, see? And I said to him one day, I said, Mr.\nSteiner, I said, I\u2019m the one that applied for the job, not my wife. I said, she got \u2014\nshe got the house to take care of and two kids \u2014 we had two kids now, we had a girl\nand a boy, and \u2014 or a boy and a girl, I should say. And \u2014 and I says, she got two kids\nand a house to \u2014 and a house to take care of and me, and I said, that\u2019s enough for\none woman. So then, here she \u2014 here she got all worked up over some stuff or\nsomething, and she wound up at a hospital. Well, while she was in the hospital,\nwhich was about three weeks, he didn\u2019t allow me off the farm to go see her. And\nthat didn\u2019t go down very good. So \u2014 and she come home, she\u2019s mad as a wet hen\nand \u2014 and so I says, well, I couldn\u2019t help it, I said, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what he \u2014 he\nwouldn\u2019t let me go, and I says, and I had to have a job. So then, one day I come in \u2014\nOctober 8, 2010\nwell, we got it all straightened out with him then, about that. And then one day I\ncome in the house and she\u2019s sitting there in her pa \u2014 kitchen crying. I said, what\u2019s\nthe matter honey? Oh, Mr. Steiner is here \u2014 was here. I go, what in the heck did he\nwant now\u201d? She says, he says, well, I got you at least doing some \u2014 some things. He\nwanted her to milk the \u2014 we had two cows. He wanted her to milk the cows, strain\nthe milk; we had a cream separator. Churn \u2014 churn the cream into butter and we \u2014\nwe \u2014 we would get a \u2014 I think two pound of butter a week for doing that, that was\ngoing to be our pay. And \u2014 and I says, doggone him anyhow. I says \u2014 I says, I\u2019m\ngonna quit. I says, the Russians haven\u2019t taken over yet. So \u2014 so I\u2014 I quit. And he \u2014\noh, he said when I told him that next morning, I said Mr. Steiner, I got bad news for\nyou today. And I think this was on Thursday. I says, Saturday is my last day\nworking here. He says, I kind of figured you do something like that. And I said,\nwell, I says, I gotta look out for my wife. And I says, she\u2019s not that healthy. So\nanyhow, he says \u2014 all he said was, see that you have your furniture on the truck by\ndinnertime on Saturday. And on Saturday we had a \u2014 our furniture on this truck and\nno place to put it. So \u2014 so then her aunt, she was living in a \u2014 a red brick house on\ntop of the hill by sing \u2014 Saint Xavier\u2019s. Do you rig \u2014 do you know where Saint\nXavier\u2019s is? Oh, well anyhow, it\u2019s on the other side of Latrobe up on \u2014 up on the\nhighway. Well, 1t was, it burnt down there, they had a fire and they cli \u2014 that took\ncare of that. So anyway, why \u2014 we go \u2014 we got out of that jo \u2014 well, anyway, well,\nOctober 8, 2010\nwhat I did, my dad and mother\u2019s neighbor, he worked at Latrobe Steel. And I\ncalled him up. And I knew him and I told him who it was and I says, how\u2019s the\nchance of getting a job down Latrobe Steel? And he says, pretty good. And he\nsays, I gotta go to Pittsburgh tomorrow, but he says, before I go down \u2014 go, I'll get\nthe ball rolling, and you call me at six o\u2019clock tomorrow night. Then I says, all\nright. So at six o\u2019clock the next night I called him and he says, where do you want\nto go to work, it\u2019s all set up for you. I says \u2014 I says, well, when\u2019s the next time that I\ncan \u2014 when can I start? And he says, how about Monday? I said, good deal, because\nthis 1s \u2014 I think this was Saturday whene \u2014 I called him. A-Anyway, I went. So I w \u2014\nI went there on Monday and \u2014 and th-that\u2019s when I started, and I worked there 35\nyears. I became a ham \u2014 a hammer driver. And we \u2014 boy, I\u2019Il tell you, I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve I made money so easy. Yeah, you know. So, th-they \u2014 the first job I had the\n\u2014 was shoveling a \u2014 a load of gravel, spreading it out. Another guy and I, we went\ndown and down and we got them shovels and we had this big pile of gravel there\nand we st \u2014 we s-spread it all out for a roadway there where \u2014 where it was they\nwere making, and all we did was sit around the rest of the day waiting for someone\nto come out and get us. And they paid us for it. I couldn\u2019t believe it the \u2014 1t was that\nway. So then that\u2019s when I was wishing I\u2019d started when I come home from work \u2014\nfrom the army.\nOctober 8, 2010",

And \u2014 and th \u2014 I \u2014 and I really enjoyed working at Latrobe still,\nespecially when I become a hammer driver [indecipherable] and a lot of the times\nth-the driver wouldn't feel like going to work or something, he\u2019d take off. Well, that\nmeant th-there\u2019d be an o-opening for another driver for that shift. And boy, I did a\nlot of overtime, get time and a half for it.",
        "Q: Later on \u2014",

And he was a Marine and \u2014 and course we ha-had to\nmake fun of him being a Marine. And he s \u2014I said, guess what the \u2014 what the guys\nin \u2014 in the army call the Marines? And he says [indecipherable] and I says, it\u2019s\nworse than that. I forget now just what we did call them now, but we used to say\nthat \u2014 that they \u2014 they always were looking for a fight. And then ti \u2014 so I said to\nhim, he \u2014 he has a little dog his wife bought, and oh he\u2019s a \u2014 a little house dog, he\u2019s\nonly about that \u2014 so long. And the little bugger, he\u2019s always wanting to pick a fight\nwith somebody. I always tell my son, I says, this darn dog of yours got Marine in\nhim. He says, how do you figure that? I says, he always wants to have a fight. I\nsaid, he don\u2019t care how big the dog is, he\u2019s gonna fight with him anyhow.",
        "Q: And did you talk to Jerry about your war experiences before he went to\nVietnam?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, we had \u2014 we talked about that, but he \u2014 he\u2019s the only one in the\nfamily that went oh \u2014 no-none of the other boys went. And then | had a brother, he\nwas a\u2014 Dick. He was in World War II like I was.

And \u2014 and he\nOctober 8, 2010\nwas a [indecipherable] gunner is what he was. Anyhow, the bullet missed him and\nit hit the ceiling beside him, ba \u2014 right in back of him, and smacked him in the back\nof the head. And as a result, he lost the sight in this eye. Him and I got the same\nsight, only different his eye \u2014 I lost mine from my own dumbness. When I was five\nyears old, I broke this here pop bottle with a hammer and as a result, why they took\n35 pieces of glass out of my eye, and par \u2014 and part of the pupil. And that left me\nwith a 15/200 vision. Well, that\u2019s no vision at all, and so \u2014 yeah, I\u2014 I w \u2014 I would \u2014\nI would s \u2014 be driving along, if I was in a straight stretch or something, I would shut\nthe one eye, leave that \u2014 leave that one open, see, and I couldn\u2019t even see the road\nwith the darn thing.",

You brings your eggs to us, and for two and a half cents an egg, we would\nOctober 8, 2010\nhatch those hundred eggs out for you. And then they \u2014 and if you got a hundred\nchicks out of 1t, you\u2019d be lucky. But nobody ever really did get a hundred percent,\nbecause of the eggs were not always fertilized. The rooster wasn\u2019t doing his duty.\nHe had to do that, you know what I mean. So, but that\u2019s what we did, we \u2014 we had\nthousands of chicks. We had two incubators that would hold 10,000 eggs, and we\nhad a hatch come off every Monday and every \u2014 every Monday and Friday. And\nthen we\u2019d take these chicks out, and say like if you had \u2014 oh, we\u2019ll say a hundred\neggs, then we\u2019d call you up and let you know th-that the chickens \u2014 the chicks,\nwhen they\u2019d be ready. Then you\u2019d come and \u2014 and get your chicks and pay us for\nthe chicks \u2014 for \u2014 for the eggs that we hatched, or for all the eggs. Cause if you gave\nus a hundred, well you\u2019d be \u2014 you very seldom get a full hundred percent hatch,\nbecause a lot of them \u2014 a lot of the eggs weren\u2019t even fertilized.",

        "A: Why did I go in the army? Well, because they told me to, for one reason, and the\nother reason, I wanted to go. I did want in before I got married, but after I got\nmarried, then they took me. Cause see, I\u2019m blind in one \u2014 in this eye, the right eye.\nWhen I was five years old, I\u2014 a guy that didn\u2019t care where he threw his garbage,\nwhat do call them, you know, they got a name. Anyhow, it \u2014 he \u2014 he was going up\nan alley. We lived in tow \u2014 when thes \u2014 this is when we lived in town, before we\nbought the farm, and I was five years old then. And we had a fence around the \u2014\nDad had a fence around the ge \u2014 our yard, and that, and my mother always put me\nout there to play with my toys while she cleaned her house, when I was little. Well,\nthis here guy who were \u2014 whoever it was, was drinking pop, and the \u2014 and his bottle\n\u2014 bottle went empty, I guess, so he just tossed it over the fence into my \u2014 into my\nDad\u2019s yard. And Mom always put me out in the yard, cause it was safe to play\nthere, because it \u2014 she had a lock on the \u2014 on the gate, so I wouldn\u2019t get out and get\nrun over with a car, wi \u2014 which I \u2014 which I did anyhow. I got ran over three times in\ntha \u2014 to be exact. Each car went over me, but none of them the wheels \u2014 only one\nOctober 8, 2010\nthe wheels hit me. Anyhow \u2014 let\u2019s see now \u2014 I wasn\u2019t going to tell you that. Th-Th-\nThe \u2014 the \u2014 so anyway, the \u2014 this time that I got hit twice right \u2014 right in front of our\nhouse, cause it was in the wintertime and we were in \u2014 in a\u2014 was 1n a \u2014 this \u2014 the\noutskirts of the town, like. And my two older brothers, they wanted to go across the\ns \u2014 Ligonier Street, that was the main street going down through Latrobe, and\nmake us new \u2014 new fort, because they want to have a snowball battle. And my\nmother said no, you can\u2019t go, cause if you go over there without Grant, he\u2019s gonna\ngo across the road and get hit with a car. Well, she was right there, because a-and \u2014\nand my dad, my dad was an invalid ever since he was two years old, and his \u2014 he\ngot sick, and his mother took him to the doctors and the doctors gave him the wrong\nmedicine, and he wound up with polio, and he was crippled, and he had walked on\ncrutches all his life from \u2014 well, in s \u2014 he was \u2014 well, I \u2014 I forgot Just how old he\nwas, he wasn\u2019t very old. He was two years old, I think it was. And, he started out on\ncrutches. He walked on them until he was 41 years old, and then \u2014 then here he got\nbursitis in his shoulders, and he couldn\u2019t use his crutches no more, so he went to a\nwheelchair. And he lived in the wheelchair and \u2014 until his death, which was 36\nyears later. And \u2014 but he had a \u2014 an office job, and he worked there 45 years. And I\ntold him whenever he retired, I says, but one thing about Dad, why, none of your\nsons are gonna work as long as you did at one job, because we were all too old for,\nyou know, to get started on it. But that was my dad.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: The army\u201d?",
        "A: Year was \u2014 gosh, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah, we \u2014 yeah, we \u2014 we ki \u2014 we \u2014 we trained there, you know, I went to\nMaryland, is where \u2014 is where th-the gi \u2014 the recruits went.",
        "A: Difficult?",
        "A: Never.",
        "A: I loved that stuff. I\u2014I liked that, especially when we went out in the firing\nrange, that\u2019s what I liked the best.",
        "A: I became a crack shot, and that \u2014 and then, whenever we finished, when we had\nthe Germans down and \u2014 and they gave up altogether, and the war was over in\nEurope, why then I volunteered to be a sniper. Got out up where \u2014 pretty nice ge \u2014\ncause we were gonna go to Japan. And we were starting to train for them,\nwhenever they dropped the atomic bomb. That made the difference in the whole\nOctober 8, 2010\noutfit, for everybody. And so they \u2014 they \u2014 they canceled everything after that, and\n\u2014 and so when that \u2014 when they dropped that bomb, we couldn\u2019t believe it, one\nbomb could do all that, because we been bombed before, being in the service. And,\noh, they tried to kill me a good many times, but they \u2014 I always out shot them. Let\u2019s\nput it that way. It\u2019s a heck of a thing to do.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Real good.",
        "A: Well, the first guy I shot, 1t made me sick, cause I \u2014 when the battle was over, I\nwent up to see, because whenever I \u2014 he was laying behind a log, and he was\nshooting at me, an-and he missed me the first shot, and I ducked down behind a\u2014a\n\u2014a tree. Cause th-the Germans had the ri \u2014 the civilian population had to rely on the\nwoods to keep their fires burning in the wintertime, cause there was no coal for\nthem, or nothing to \u2014 to heat up \u2014 oh, I tell you the \u2014 the German civilians, they took\na beating. And the \u2014 the Germans took the \u2014 all the food, mostly, that they could\nget, ta\u2014 and they didn\u2019t have enough to eat half the time, and the \u2014 that\u2019s the \u2014\nthat\u2019s the civilians. But I\u2019ll tell you, the German civilians were better to us than\nwhat the English were. And we were su-supporting the \u2014 England and everything\nOctober 8, 2010\nelse, and doing all that stuff. Cause I was in England there for nine months, I think\nit was. Anyhow, I was in the military police then, and they \u2014 so I got their bo \u2014 I got\nacquainted with wa \u2014 one of their bobbies, which is, that\u2019s what they call for, you\nknow, police, over there, a bobby. And him and his wife decided to have four of us\ncome to their house for Christmas. Well, that was a pretty good deal, you know, at\nleast we thought so until he \u2014 he says \u2014 well, we were \u2014 I was on like a\u2014a-\u2014a\ndifferent outs \u2014 outfit, because they \u2014 they went and they gave us the st-stamps and\nthat, you know, for th \u2014 to get your \u2014 your vittles to eat. And then \u2014 then you \u2014\nanyhow, he says, do you have any \u2014 any stamps, food stamps, that\u2019s what they\ncalled them. And I says, yeah, I said, I got mine yesterday. He said, let\u2019s see it. And\nI pulled it out and handed it to him, and that was a mistake, because he never gave it\nback to me. He says, well, if you\u2019re coming to eat, he says, we gotta feed you. But I\nwasn\u2019t counting on supplying the food. But anyhow, it was nice, and that was a\ngood gesture. And so he had the four of \u2014 he had four of us come there. And I was\ntelling him \u2014 his wife, she\u2019s just a little squirt, and the \u2014 but she was nice. And she \u2014\nand she\u2019s asking me, you know, like, about my family and all that stuff, and I told\nabout my wife, and that, and she says, well, I\u2019m gonna make her a baby doll. I said,\nwell, that\u2019ll be real nice of you. She said, one of those days itll come rolling up to\nyour house door. So \u2014 but it never came. She forgot about it, or didn\u2019t have a chance\nor something. I don\u2019t know, maybe something happened. But that was nice, and \u2014\nOctober 8, 2010\nbut it didn\u2019t last long. So anyhow, I \u2014 we went and \u2014 and we \u2014 we went on into \u2014 we\ngot a kra \u2014 we went over the \u2014 over there where France was, you know.",
        "A: I-I can\u2019t really say now. I\u2019m not sure.",
        "A: But I was in \u2014 I was in England nine months.",
        "A: That part I do know. I crossed that ocean four times during the war, and when \u2014\nwe were lucky, we a\u2014 we always \u2014 the Germans always didn\u2019t have a \u2014 their\nsubmarines in the right place, because we\u2019d go across, you know, like a\u2014 a whole \u2014\nwhole mess of ships would go at one time, and oh man, it\u2019d be stuf \u2014 stre \u2014\nstretched out for miles. I saw one going down, where a torpedo, it \u2014 it missed our\nship and \u2014 and hit the one farther away and \u2014 and I \u2014 and I always liked to watch \u2014\nI'd go up to the bow and I\u2019d watch the \u2014 the tor \u2014 the fish, I forget what you call\nthem now, you know, they were big son of a guns, and something like a shark.\nWell, the sharks didn\u2019t like them because they \u2014 they beat up on the sharks. The \u2014\nthe fish are as bad as the human beings, ain\u2019t they? They fight with each other. And\nthey always jumped in front of the ship. Always wondered how the ship kept from\nrunning over them. They didn\u2019t \u2014 never \u2014 we never seen any of them getting hit.\nThey\u2019d just keep diving, you know. And that was interesting there.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 we \u2014 we just kept \u2014 kept fighting them, that\u2019s all. And they \u2014 they\nfinally gave in, the enemy did. But wha \u2014 I always remember one German lady, she\ncome out on the \u2014 on her porch. We just chased the \u2014 the German soldiers out of\nthis here one town. And when we were going into it, and we stopped for a \u2014 a \u2014 like\na rest, why this lady come out and she says, I want 12 of you men to come in my\nhouse. Well, we didn\u2019t have any idea why she want 12 us men in there. So 12 of us\n[indecipherable], we went in. And she sits us around the table, she goes over to her\noven. In them days the Germans had put in all coal stoves in their kitchens. And she\nopened up the \u2014 the oven, and there\u2019s 12 apples in there she baked, just for us guys.\nAnd she \u2014 she gave each one of us an apple. And I\u2019ll always forget \u2014 I always\nremember that woman. I \u2014 how I wished I would have got her name and address,\nbecause she was so good to us. Then she took me around, I don\u2019t know why she\npicked on me, but she took me around her house, showed me all around in there, her\nhouse and everything. And she had three sons that was in the army, German army.\nOctober 8, 2010\nBut they were all prisoners of war. We had one, and England had one, and the\nRussians had one. I said to her, well, I said, Pll tell you, I says, you\u2019re pretty sure of\ngetting those two \u2014 two of them back out of those three, alive. And I says, now the\none we have and the one the \u2014 the \u2014 at \u2014 let\u2019s see what a \u2014 well, we\u2019ll say England,\nand the one they have, the British, th-the \u2014 I said, the one the British have and the\none we have you\u2019re pretty sure of getting those two back. But, I says, the one that\nthe Russians have, I says, I can\u2019t tell you about them, I said, those guys are nuts. I\nsaid, all they want to do is kill everybody. And so that\u2019s exactly what they did.",
        "A: You bet they were good soldiers. And when they were shooting those guns, they\nwere dead shots, too. Now I had one shooting at me with a machine gun, cause we\nran a \u2014 he-here\u2019s the way it was. I don\u2019t know whether you know any \u2014 you know\nhow ya \u2014 how the army when they\u2019re \u2014 when you\u2019re tra \u2014 going into a battle like,\nwell, we\u2019re go \u2014 we\u2019re going along, coming up \u2014 up through this field that, and\nsomeone says that \u2014 that the Germans are up ahead somewhere. Well, we always\nhad scouts out, two scouts. They\u2019d be about oh, say, 200 yards ahead of us. Now,\nthey were not supposed to shoot any bra \u2014 any Germans that they seen, but they\nwere supposed to give us the silent signal. The silent signal was a \u2014 y-you laid your\nrifle down, you grabbed ahold of it and \u2014 by the barrel and by the \u2014 and by the back\nOctober 8, 2010\nof it, and you put it above your head and go like that. That 1s your signal that the\nenemy was there.",
        "A: Yes, they \u2014 and they \u2014 and they didn\u2019t make a sound. Well, anyhow, then wh-\nwhen we got that message, by boy they just \u2014 they blew a whistle and we just\nspread out and start digging in right away, because we knew we were running into a\ntrap. And so the Germans, they smartened up. They thought by us cat \u2014 by us\nhaving those two scouts there, they were told tr \u2014 told, do not shoot the scouts. Th-\nThe German did. He says, wait til they get through your lines, but make sure they\ndon\u2019t see you to give out and give the \u2014 us the \u2014 the warning. Says go, and \u2014 wait a\nminute now, I think of something about that \u2014 anyhow, he says, let them go through\nyour ra-ranks, but make sure they don\u2019t see you. And then, when they get through\nit, grab them, and then we\u2019ll put them in \u2014 in prison, then, for the \u2014 you know, the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the ten \u2014 well, anyhow, the prison. And so anyway, that\u2019s what they did, cause\nwe lost both of our scouts at first, but we got them back after a bit, cause one of our\nshells went and blew the fence down, and wa \u2014 th-then they shot out of it, and they\ngot back with us again. And they said that when they were \u2014 the Germans ran, he\nsays, we ran right with them. He says, those shells and that you guys were shooting\nat us, well, they didn't give a hoot who they killed. So anyhow they \u2014 the scouts, we\nha \u2014 we had them scouts, but whenever they give that signal, we would \u2014 we would\nOctober 8, 2010\n\u2014 see, we'd be going in the single file, maybe might be three or four in a row, you\nknow how they are when you\u2019re marching. And as soon we got that signal boy, you\ns \u2014 just spread right out. And everybody got their \u2014 we had little shovels. You\nprobably sm \u2014 maybe you seen them already. And we\u2019d dig a foxhole and get down\nin under below the ground surface. And then that \u2014 then the \u2014 we were ready for\nfight then. But if you \u2014 if we didn\u2019t see that signal, why we would walk right into\nthis trap. Now, we ran into one of them traps, and all of a sudden they start\nshooting. And I hit the ground right where I was, you \u2014 whenever \u2014 when they start\nshooting, nobody has to tell you to get down and stay down, you learn that quick,\nbecause you want to live a little longer. So anyhow, we went and \u2014 wait a minute\nnow. We \u2014 well, we \u2014 we got up there an-and then the Germans start shooting at us,\nand we got down and then we start shooting back. Well, I was out, right out in the\nopen spaces there. Well, my buddy was, when he was shooting his rifle, I was\nreloading mine. And when I was shooting mine, he was reloading his. So we had a\nsteady sho \u2014 stream of bullets going up where the machine gunners were. So\nanyhow, they went out and he \u2014 he turns on me. I was laying down on the ground\nshooting there, and I didn\u2019t have no trees or nothing to get behind, I was out in the\nopen. And my buddy, he \u2014 he got the only tree that was there, he \u2014 he dove behind\nit. Anyway, and the Germans saw me. So he turns the machine gun on me. Now, he\n[indecipherable] like, well, we\u2019ll just \u2014 there, there. We'll just say here\nOctober 8, 2010\n[indecipherable] right here. I stretched out this way, see, and up \u2014 the Germans are\nup that way, and he starts shooting at me, and he come about that far away from my\nbody. He dug a hole, a trench with that machine gun, from my head down to my\nfeet, about four inches deep with those bullets. That\u2019s \u2014 an-and I was laying right\nthere, all that dirt was flying in my face and all over my body and that. And I was\ntrying to crawl inside of my helmet, but I wasn\u2019t do \u2014 doing good. My head was\nalready in there. So I got to thinking, if I laid still, he\u2019d think he killed me, and he\u2019Il\ngo and shoot somebo \u2014 at somebody else. So whenever he stopped \u2014 he had to stop\nand reload, you know, and when he\u2019d run out of shells, why he\u2019d take a couple of\nminutes for him to get the new belts 1-in there of shells. Well, while he was doing\nthat, I was lay \u2014 laying there figuring out what I was going to do to him. Anyhow, I\nhad dirt and mud and everything in my face, and all over my body and everything\nelse. The whole way down my body, I was just covered with dirt an-and m-mud,\nyou might say. So anyway, I \u2014 I got a \u2014 while \u2014 while he was shooting, h-he to \u2014 he\nchange his \u2014 his targets then. He looked for somebody that was \u2014 he could see,\ncause he saw me laying there and he figured he\u2019d killed me, see? Well, that worked.\nAnyhow, he starts shooting at somebody else. Now, when he starts shooting at\nsomebody else, I was the only one in the outfit that had rifle grenades. The captain\ncome out to me when we \u2014 fe \u2014 before we started out that day and he says,\nShultheis. I said, yes sir? He says, you\u2019re my grenadier. I said, yes, sir, I said, sir.\nOctober 8, 2010\nHe says, yeah, what do you want? He said \u2014 I said, what\u2019s a grenadier? He ha \u2014 he\nsaid, you\u2019re the guy to stop the tanks. So I pulled one \u2014 I pulled out the gre-grenade,\nhe gave me a ba\u2014 a pa \u2014 a bag like, see, I would call it a bag. Anyhow, it fit over\nyour shoulder and it had six grenades in it; three of them phosphorous and three\nexpl \u2014 high e-explosion. So I said to him, what am I supposed to do with these? He\nsays, you\u2019re supposed to stop the tanks. I picked it out and I said, sir, I said, you\nthink that this little thing here 1s going to stop one of them great big tanks? He says,\nI know it will. I says, what do I shoot at, whenever I shoot at that tank? And he\nsays, the tracks. Now, I never knew this before that \u2014 before that day. He says I \u2014\nwhen the tracks are gone, there\u2019s a \u2014 a little track in the center of the tank, and it \u2014\nand it runs \u2014 it keeps those su \u2014 tracks on the wheels like, even, so that they don\u2019t\ncome off. And he says, all you gotta do is hit that wheel, it\u2019s about that big, he said.\nBut that\u2019s like telling you to go jump in the lake. Anyhow, I said yes, sir, I says, I\nthink we can stop them all right then, 1f we can \u2014 if I can hit that \u2014 if I can just hit\nthat there part where you just told me. And so anyhow, he s \u2014 he \u2014 he agreed with\nme on it. So he went and let me figure it out myself. So \u2014 but I\u2014 I never saw a tank\nafter that. S \u2014 but I did use them on \u2014 on machine guns, and boy it worked good. So\nanyway, this one whose \u2014 this machine gunner that was shooting at me, I th \u2014 I\nthought, if I stop jiggling around here, that th \u2014 that he\u2019II think he killed me,\nbecause he was pretty far away, you know. So, by gollies, it worked. I laid still and\nOctober 8, 2010\nhe sh \u2014 quit shooting at me. I guess he must have stop \u2014 must have ran out of shells\nand he had to put another belt on, and while he was putting that belt on, I\u2014 I-\u2014I\nrigged up my \u2014 my grenade launcher on my rifle, and you shoot those grenades with\na blank. So they told me, they says, for God\u2019s sakes, make sure you don\u2019t have a\nlive round in your rifle when you shoot that, because he says, if you shoot that with\na live round, you\u2019re gonna blow your own head off, whenever you would shoot that\n\u2014 that grenade, he says, instead of it going that way, it would stay right where it was\nand knock your head off. So th-that \u2014 that\u2019s a good \u2014 good lesson. So \u2014 so I never\ndid, I always checked it all \u2014 all the time, make sure. So anyway, I said to my\nbuddy, I says, I\u2019m gonna fix those babies now. And he says yeah, you know, what\nare you gonna do? I says, I\u2019m gonna send them a phosphorous grenade. So I put a\nphosphorous grenade on cause they are \u2014 they were the worst. The high explosions,\nthey were bad, but th \u2014 but the \u2014 the others, they were worse, they \u2014 oh, man, they\nwere miserable. They \u2014 cause when they \u2014 when this phosphorous grenades went\noff, they didn\u2019t quit burning when \u2014 if it hits you. Say like if a \u2014 if it hits you in \u2014 in\nyour arm, that would burn the whole way through your arm. It\u2019Il melt your \u2014 even\nmelt your bones, they said. And that\u2019s how hot it went. Anyway, I said to my\nbuddy, I says, okay, I says, I\u2019m ready to shoot, I says. You watch up over the top of\nthem trees, see if you can see it going. And I stuck the huge \u2014 you always stick the \u2014\nthe stock of your rifle in the ground and raise the barrel up. And I was laying there\nOctober 8, 2010\nbeside it there, and I raised her up, and I said, you wa \u2014 I says, are you watching?\nHe said yeah. I said, well, here it goes. I reached down and I pulled the trigger.\nWell, that grenade, you could see it. I-It goes pretty fast, but you can still see it\ngoing. It went \u2014 oh, it made a beautiful bow right up over the top of the trees and\ncome down. And on the way down, it must have hit a \u2014 a limb, because I don\u2019t\nthink it went off at the ground, because it seemed like it \u2014 when the \u2014 when it\ndisappeared and you couldn\u2019t see it, why, it was \u2014 wasn\u2019t enough time for it to hit\nthe ground when it exploded. But when it exploded, it made a great, big puff of\nsmoke, and flames, and \u2014 and \u2014 and it \u2014 and the phosphorous was everywhere. And\nI heard them guys screaming up there where they \u2014 where I was shooting at, so I \u2014 I\n\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure I hit them, because that was them screaming. Now, I never seen\nany of them, or anything like that, because they were pretty well camouflaged.\nAnyway, we \u2014 we \u2014 that stopped that whole [indecipherable] that whole battle. The\nGermans jumped up after I shot that, and they ran ba-backwards, back over \u2014 to get\naway from us. Our outfit, they \u2014 they got up, they ran back the other way, I ne \u2014 I\nnever figured out yet why they went that way, cause it was a gort in the wrong\ndirection. So anyway, we didn\u2019t see no more Germans that night. And the me \u2014 and\nmy buddy, he s \u2014 he\u2019s young. Come on Shultheis, come on Shultheis, everybody\u2019s\nleaving us. I said, I\u2019m not leaving til I get my rifle reloaded. And I ha \u2014 I had to take\nall my stuff off my rifle, and that \u2014 you know, the launcher and everything, and \u2014 to\nOctober 8, 2010\nget to my rifle to work right with the bullets. And then I put a\u2014 ac-\u2014aclip with\nnine rounds in it, then I was ready to go. Then I stood up, and when I stood up there\nwasn\u2019t a soul around, just him and I. Our men got up, they went the one way and\nthe Germans went the other way. And that\u2019s another thing I never understood, why\nwe went backwards instead of going forward. Anyway, we \u2014 we didn\u2019t have no\nmore problems with them that night. And then \u2014 then my buddy and I, we went\nback to where the \u2014 kind of back to where the machine gunners were and they had\nto stay up all night on guard, so we \u2014 we each dug a slit trench. Now, a slit trench, I\ndon\u2019t know whether you know what a slit trench is or not. Oh, you know? Okay,\nthat\u2019s just where you can lay down in it, it\u2019s big enough. We di \u2014 we dug that, each\none of us dug a bed, you might say. Filled full of leaves and then crawled down in\nunder them leaves and go to sleep. And the \u2014 we let the \u2014 we let the machine\ngunners stay awake that night. So \u2014",
        "A: Who?",
        "A: Our si \u2014 our service \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 our soldiers were good soldiers, yes. And \u2014 cause they listened to what the \u2014\nwhat they were told to do, and they did it.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Did I remember what, sir?",
        "A: Yes, Dachau.",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it was a big camp. They \u2014 and they say it had 30,000 men and \u2014 and\nwomen in there. And they had a lot of people in there, that you might as well say\nthey starved them to death, practically. Now, whenever we got in there, got the gate\nopen and that, what happened, see, the f\u2014 the first guy in \u2014 1n the line, he saw \u2014 he\nsaw the lock. So he just pulled his rifle up and shot it. And when he hit it, it just\nflew in pieces, cause we was using armor piercing shells at the time, cause we was\ndoing a lot of force fighting \u2014 fighting in to the \u2014 1n the force \u2014 force. Now like \u2014\nwell, say \u2014 say like where they have a \u2014 make the cuckoo clocks. Well, that part\nthere, we were into that, and boy I\u2019Il tell you, no wonder they call that the Black\nForest, cause it is really dark. The sun don\u2019t even get down through the trees.\nAnyhow, we went \u2014 we were on there and we \u2014 and we come and \u2014 and I come to a\n\u2014a-\u2014a German truck, and stand there. And I can see some blankets in there and I\nthought, oh boy, that\u2019d be ideal thing. I climbed up in the truck and it was full of\ndead soldiers and the blood all over everything, oh what a mess. So I got out and let\nOctober 8, 2010\nthe whole bunch go. I let the dead keep the bla-blankets. But that\u2019s just the way\nthings went.",
        "A: Well, there was one gate by \u2014 we came to was \u2014 it was more a \u2014 it was more like\na \u2014 say like a front gate. See, there was a gate here, and then back here, they had the\nfurnaces right here, and \u2014 and then \u2014 then they were over some more buildings here.\nAnd then they had other buildings where, like the prisoners stayed in, inside of that\ngate. Now, the Germans had, I would say, oh, 200 yards of field, all smooth cut.\nThere wasn\u2019t a tree [indecipherable], so that if any of their prisoners escaped, their\nsoldiers were supposed to shoot them and kill them. And they \u2014 and they had a lot\nof time to kill them because they had that whole say \u2014 we\u2019ll say 200 yards to \u2014 to go\nbefore they got to the woods. And so anyhow, I \u2014 the \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 I had a German\nin my sights that I kept in my sights there, because there was three prisoners chasing\nhim after we opened the gates, see? And I said to my buddies, I says, look at that, I\nsays, that German, he\u2019s running away from those guys. And I says, he\u2019s in A-1\nshape and \u2014 and those three guys are in starvation shape, and I said, they\u2019Il never\ncatch him. And he was heading for those woods. So I got down on one knee, took\nthe safety off of my rifle and \u2014 and I just got that guys \u2014 back of his head riding on\nthe top of my front sight. And they said, what are you gonna do, Shultheis? I said,\nI\u2019m gonna knock that guy off if he \u2014 1f it looks like he\u2019s gonna make to the \u2014 to\nOctober 8, 2010\nthose trees. Cause I said, once he gets into those trees, I says, he\u2019s a free man, be an\n\u2014 and because he ga \u2014 he can have a \u2014 a thousand places to hide. And \u2014 and I says, I\ndon\u2019t think those guys are gonna be able to make it. Well, they \u2014 they were doing\npretty good though, they \u2014 they were running and \u2014 and that German soldier was\nrunning, too, because they were after him. Anyhow, I \u2014 I noticed that the gap was\ngetting closer, see, they were gaining on him. And I said to one of the guys, I says,\nwell, I says, I guess I won\u2019t have to shoot him after all. I says, I think they\u2019re gonna\nmake it. So they \u2014 here they caught him before he got to the trees. Now, if I\u2014if I\nthought he was going to make it to the trees, I was going to shoot him, because he \u2014\nhe probably did a lot of things to those guys, and it didn\u2019t matter to me; he was a\nGerman, so that\u2019s \u2014 he was \u2014 there was no limit on him. You could shoot as many\nas you want to.",
        "A: Oh, the \u2014 well, they grabbed him. That\u2019s one thing they did do. One guy grabbed\none arm, and the other guy \u2014 another guy, he grabbed the other arm, and the third\none, he took the pistol from the German and shot him in the head. That was the end.\nThat German, he was screaming his head off. And then all of a sudden you heard\nthe bang. Then I saw the head drop down whenever he shot him. Now, they were \u2014\nwell, the he \u2014 they were pretty close to the woods. He come pretty close to have me\nhelp him, but I didn\u2019t have to. They did a good job themself.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Well, we weren\u2019t quite sure what the camp name was, or anything like that. It\njust happened to be in the la \u2014 1n our line of fire as we \u2014 as we went \u2014 marched\nalong. Cause we just go up one mountain and down another one.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t believe anyone could be so rotten. That\u2019s what I thought.",
        "A: Well, no, we didn\u2019t get a chance to, cause we were always dra \u2014 always after the\nGermans \u2014 soldiers, and na \u2014 and \u2014 and we \u2014 we \u2014 what we wanted to do, we\nwanted to keep them moving so they didn't have time to dig in and put a row of\nmachine guns across our path. Na \u2014 so what they did, they went and they gave their\nmen orders to make sure they hide good, and camouflage themselves and\neverything, so the \u2014 the \u2014 so that our \u2014 our two men that was in the lead, didn\u2019t see\nthem. And when he get to the other side of the Germans, grab them, and then put\nthem in the concentration camp.",
        "A: Yes.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Not very long, cause we went straight through, cause we were \u2014 we were chasing\nthe Germans at the time, and then we wanted to keep them from pa \u2014 getting \u2014\ngetting a \u2014 a trap set for. But we still \u2014 we ran into one of them. And that was a \u2014\nthe one where I was just telling you about where he almost shot me. And so \u2014 but he\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 he didn't hit me. That was the main thing.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, they fought right to the end. They were \u2014 they were good fighters, Ill tell\nyou that.",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 what we could see, wa \u2014 you couldn\u2019t see too much at first, because\nit was like boarded off like, you know, say like the dead, and stuff like that. Now,\nthey had a big pile of dead laying in there. We saw tha \u2014 I saw that. But we no more\nthan got into the gate, I\u2019d say oh, I don\u2019t know how far in we got, not very far. But\nwhen you come through the gate, then you saw the furnaces. And then \u2014 an-and \u2014\nand the \u2014 the dead was piled up a pile, right out there in the ground, just laying on\ntop of each other. And what they were doing, they were taking them and they was\nputting them in the fire and burning them. But I guess it made a terrible smell,\nOctober 8, 2010\nbecause they said that the \u2014 the German population was complaining, because it\nstunk so bad, you know, from the \u2014 the bodies being cooked.",
        "A: How long was I what?",
        "A: Oh, about maybe 15 minutes at the most. Because see we \u2014 like I said, we were\nchasing the Germans so that \u2014 and at the time and we didn\u2019t want them to like make\n\u2014 have time to dig 1n trenches and that for their machine guns and that. And so we\ndidn\u2019t stay. So we were \u2014 we were brought out right away. Probably some of them\ndidn\u2019t even get in there, some of the men. But \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes. I was \u2014 I was going int \u2014 into the \u2014 into the n \u2014 n \u2014 around the fence\nway, you know, in \u2014 into the camp, we\u2019ll call it. And here I happened to look down\nand I saw this key laying there. And th-the people coming out of \u2014 out, was running\nright across it. And \u2014 and the G.I.s that was going into the camp walked over top of\nit too. Now, I was in a couple times in fra \u2014 like \u2014 well, let\u2019s see, where they \u2014\nwhere they had the \u2014 had the shoe mines and stuff, they had [indecipherable] mine\n\u2014 [coughs] Excuse me. And the Germans were great for that there \u2014 having mine\nfields for us to walk onto. Only once that I got real, real close to losing a foot. But\nthe lieutenant saved my hide. He \u2014 he was right behind me and here he happened to\nOctober 8, 2010\nlook down and he saw I was gonna just step on one. And all he did\n[indecipherable] he says, Shultheis, he says, stop immediately, he said\n[indecipherable] he said, stop, he says, a mine on \u2014 a mine there. And a \u2014 and I was\ncoming down with my foot and I froze right there, I never went another inch. And I\nlooked down and there was a mine. If it wasn\u2019t for him, I would have a wooden leg\nnow. He saved my li \u2014 my hide there. And the first \u2014 first one \u2014 time, why we were\ngoing, we had our \u2014 we started at three o\u2019clock in the morning, it was pitch dark.\nWe got out of our foxholes and the captain says, now, you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re to bring back\n\u2014 we\u2019re gonna \u2014 to bring back some Germans alive. And he \u2014 and he says, for\nGod\u2019s sakes, and a few other words that you\u2019re not supposed to say, and he says,\ndon\u2019t shoot them all, he says, we want to \u2014 we want to question them. He says,\nwe're gonna \u2014 we\u2019re gonna g-go \u2014 we\u2019re gonna go after them about right, and he\nsays, we want to know what we\u2019re gonna run into. So, anyhow, I \u2014 tha-that\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s how that one went. Anyway, we \u2014 we went across the field then, and \u2014 and\nthe \u2014 the one scout stepped on a mine. Now, he was about, I\u2019d say two \u2014 maybe a\nhundred yards ahead of us. Well, we didn\u2019t know what happened, we just heard the\nexplosion, so we stopped, and the lieutenant s-scattered us guys around \u2014 around\nthis place where \u2014 where that noise come from, and you hear \u2014 what it was was one\nof the \u2014 the scouts. Anyhow, I said to him, I said, sir, I said, I\u2019ll go in there and [Il\nget that guy, and Ill bring him out. He said okay, but he says, wait a minute til we\nOctober 8, 2010\nget you a medic, he says, you\u2019re gonna need it. I said, all right. So he told his\nsergeant what to tell his men. The sergeant went over, he told the first guy, sa \u2014\nmedics wanted up front. And they passed it down the line, like the guy behind him\nand you know, like that. And then I took a few minutes and \u2014 and the medic come\nup. So the medic come out when I told him. I said, th \u2014 one of the scouts has some \u2014\nhe went haywire in here, I says. We don\u2019t know exactly what it is yet, and the\nlieutenant told me to wait til you got up here because I\u2019m going in after him and\nbring him out. And he says, okay, he says, let\u2019s go. So I says, all right. So we went\nin and there \u2014 and I found him right away, he was laying by a bush, and he had one\nleg \u2014 one foot off. That\u2019s what those shoe mine were for. The Germans discovered\nit take at least four guys to get a\u2014 a wounded guy back to the rear, and that\u2019s four li\n\u2014 guys less shooting at hi \u2014 at his men. So, anyhow, we got the \u2014 th-the medic\nbandaged his \u2014 his stump up, and we got him up on his one good foot. And I had the\n\u2014 I had his arm around th \u2014 my neck and \u2014 and the medic had th \u2014 had a 0 \u2014 the\nother around and the \u2014 and we just ready to start out and he says, I could carry him\nbetter if I was on your side, he says, do you want to trade? I says sure, I says, I can\ncarry him no matter which side. So \u2014 so anyhow, we chi \u2014 we swi \u2014 switched. I took\nhis arm off my neck, I went over and got his other arm, put it around my neck, the\nmedic come on around. He puts his \u2014 put the other arm \u2014 his other arm around his\nneck, and na \u2014 and I says, are you ready to go? And he says yeah. So the medic\nOctober 8, 2010\nsays, all right, let\u2019s go. Well, he took one step and he blew his foot off. Right where\nI was standing, I don\u2019t know how I missed it. I never even seen th \u2014 a mine there.\nAnd he\u2019s the only guy of all of them that I saw wounded that cried up \u2014 up front, on\nthe line. And here, when he went in \u2014 when they sent him home after they got his\nartificial foot and that, why, he drank himself to death. And he \u2014 and his mother\nsays that he couldn\u2019t stand being crippled.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we never had no \u2014 n-no trouble like that, see? Most of it was, they\nwere in like fields and stuff like that, and woods. And there weren\u2019t too much house\nto house fighting, we didn\u2019t do much of that.",
        "A: Well, I guess it was that \u2014 I guess it was just the part \u2014 well, I \u2014 I'll tell you the \u2014\nthe \u2014 my most memory of that is, is whenever they were shooting at us, and \u2014 and if\nyou didn\u2019t shoot back, why you\u2019d \u2014 you\u2019d wind up in the graveyard. And I had an\nM-1 rifle they gave me, that was a wonderful gun. Boy oh boy, when you put a\nOctober 8, 2010\nsight on that, why he was a goner. Now I had chances of shooting more than what I\ndid, but I captured them mostly, and I turned them over to the officer in charge.",
        "A: The prisoners?",
        "A: Th-They \u2014 they were \u2014 they \u2014 they would say \u2014 they were ha \u2014 they had an\nstationary, and the \u2014 and they always somehow, I don\u2019t know just how, they put the\n\u2014 put these men in there. Cause actually I really never seen them put them in, they \u2014\nthey \u2014 they gi \u2014 prisoners were standing there and then they \u2014 they went over to\nmake sure he didn\u2019t have no weapons on him. And so \u2014 now, I captured quite a few\nGermans. I captured six at a time, three different times by myself. And so anyhow,\nth \u2014 I\u2014I\u2014I never had any trouble with any of them that I captured. And they \u2014 they\n\u2014 now, I went into a place \u2014 well, here we \u2014 they said to us this \u2014 one day the\ncaptain come on, he says, well, you guys is go-gonna get a ride today. And \u2014 and it\nwas darn near getting dark, and \u2014 and we \u2014 we were \u2014 we were gonna get a ride to \u2014\nanyhow, he says, I want 12 men on every tank. So that\u2019s \u2014 we had to ride on the\nother side of the tank. We rode all night long, never stopped once. And oh man, we\nwere about froze. It was snowing and blowing and that. So we stopped at daybreak\nand we were in a wide open field. It was all \u2014 like it was big, big gl \u2014 hay field, see?\nOctober 8, 2010\nAnd there was been \u2014 been mowed. So \u2014 so then we stopped, the guys bailed off of\nthat tank and ran to a woods which was about approximately a hundred yards away\nto get wood to build a fire. Everybody else was \u2014 you know, we \u2014 we were darn\nnear froze to death. So anyhow, I heard him tell the sergeant, just look at them guys.\nEvery one of them, he says, go over there and heading for them woods and they left\ntheir weapons here on the ga \u2014 on the tank. [coughs] Excuse me. And so I thought,\noh well, if they can all go in there, I says, I think I\u2019ll go, too. So I slid down off the\ntank and \u2014 but only I took my rifle with me, they didn\u2019t, cause they wanted to have\ntheir arms free to carry wood back to make a fire. So I go over there and here I get\ninto the woods and the \u2014 and the Germans had trenches dug the whole way along\nthat [indecipherable] there. Oh, it must have been a mile long, pretty near. And \u2014\nand that \u2014 and the \u2014 and the ditches, the trenches weren\u2019t real deep, but deep enough\nwhat they could lay down in it and you wouldn\u2019t be able to hit \u2014 see \u2014 even see\nthem, let alone shoot them.",
        "A: And so anyhow, here they moved out the night before, or we would have been in\nhot water right there. So, I got over there near these guys running around like\nIndians, like a bunch of nuts gathering wood. They took it all back and t-t-t \u2014 to the\ntank and made a fire. Well, I see a shanty in there. I \u2014 oh, I\u2019ll be darned, I think PI\ngo see what\u2019s in that. I went over and I opened the door and I went in. Here was a\nOctober 8, 2010\ntool shed, like shovel, pick and rake and stuff like that. And so I went out and shut\nthe door and [indecipherable] there was three loaves of homemade bread and\nGerman bread there on a shelf. Well, I didn\u2019t bother them, but I thought about\neating one of them. And I walked around the \u2014 around the building, there\u2019s another\ndoor. I opened up and I walked in and holy man I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. Six\nGermans in there in bed, all sound asleep. I went around \u2014 let\u2019s see, how\u2019d I do\nthat? Oh, I went around, I put my hands under each one of their pillows to see if\nthey had any weapons in there, like a pistol or a dagger or something like that,\nbecause I was out numbered six to one right there, and they could have killed me\nreal easy. So anyway, there was nothing. So then I went around again, and I took\nthe top blanket and pulled it down to their ankle. They never opened their eyes, they\njust sit up in bed, got all that blanket, pulled it back down and \u2014 and laid back down\nagain. I said, well alright you guys, you don\u2019t want to wake up, well, P\u2019ll wake you\nup. So I reached in my pocket and I pulled out a phosphorous hand grenade. I pulled\nthe pin out of it and I held the lever down on \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether you know\nanything about grenades. Oh, you do? You know how you hold it down? Well, I\nwas hanging onto it. I had my hand 1n the coal stove, they had a coal stove there,\nlike a potbelly stove. And what I was gonna do 1s drop that grenade in there and\nbeat it out of that darn sh-shed. And all of a sudden I heard, all right Shultheis,\nwhat in the hell are you gonna do now? I says, oh, here is my sergeant, he come\nOctober 8, 2010\nlooking for me. So I said, these guys won\u2019t wake up, I said, \u2019'm ga \u2014 I\u2019m just gonna\nwake them up, that\u2019s all. He says, well, what are you doing with your hand in the\nstove? Well, there was no fire in the stove, it was out, so I s \u2014 told him about it and I\nsays, I got a hand grenade here and I got the pin pulled out and I \u2014 and you\u2019re in my\nroute, get the heck out of that doorway, because I said, I got nine seconds to g \u2014\nfrom the time I let go of that grenade, before it goes off. And I want to be out of\nhere and get into one of those trenches out there before it explodes. And so here, in\nour talking, one \u2014 one of them Germans woke up. He\u2019s sitting up there in the top f \u2014\ntop bunk, his legs hanging down, he\u2019s rubbing his eyes, you know. And I walk over\nto him. And he never seen me and he had his \u2014 both hands up there, rubbing his\neyes there, getting the cobwebs out of them, I guess. And when he opened \u2014 took\nhis hands down, he\u2019s looking right down the barrel of my rifle. I says, all right, I\nsays, the war\u2019s over for you guys. I said, get the ba \u2014 get them out of that beds. He\nsaid one word, brrp, they all just jumped right out of bed so quick and they all\nlanded in the middle of the floor. There they are, all standing there with their long-\njohns on and a pair of socks, that\u2019s all they had on. I says, as of right now, you are\nall prisoners of war. And here, in the meantime, my tanks th \u2014 they were getting\nready to take off, they \u2014 I heard the motors starting up out there. They w \u2014 they\u2019d sit\nthere for awhile to you know, get them warmed up. And I said to them, shake it up,\nand get your clothes on fast, I said, the tanks are getting ready to pull out and I don\u2019t\nOctober 8, 2010\nfeel like walking any more. So, I said, \u2019'm going outside, and you come out when\nyou get dressed. But, I said, don\u2019t hesitate, shake it out. So they got \u2014 th-th-they \u2014\nthey were \u2014 they oper \u2014 they c-cooperated pretty good. They come out and as each\none would come out I would, you know, shake them down and see if I could feel\nany pistols or knives on them and that and none of them had any on. And I \u2014 and I\nshowed them the tank that I was on. I says, now, I says, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the \u2014 the one\nI want to go on, that\u2019s the one I belong to. Either head for that th \u2014 tha \u2014 for \u2014 for\nthat there Lanair(ph). And they said okay, so I said, all right, four [indecipherable]\ndudes, they got into a part, and so I had the six of them there. And the one says,\nthere are three loaves of homemade bread in there, can I go get them? I says, no. I\nsays, we don\u2019t have time to get them. I said, you hear them motors running down\nthere? I said, them tanks are ready to take off. And I said, they\u2019re not gonna wait for\nme. But when I brought them out, and they saw me coming out of the woods with\nsix prisoners, they s \u2014 they slowed their motors down and waited. And I took them\nover and I gave them to the \u2014 gave them to the lieutenant there at our tank, and that\nwas the last I ever seen them, so I don\u2019t know how they made out, or what they did\nwith them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I \u2014 there was nothing there to shoot at, the Germans were \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014\nthey weren't \u2014 they weren't in the camp or nothing when they got \u2014 when we got\nthere.",
        "A: When they knew we were coming they moved out to another place, that I don\u2019t\nknow for sure now whether we ran into them or not, because we was always\nrunning into a bunch of them somewhere.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know. They \u2014 th-they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 I don\u2019t think it was any\ninside of the camp whenever we were there. On-Only maybe the guards and stuff\nlike that. But we didn\u2019t even see the guards, I don\u2019t know where in heck they\ndisappeared to.",
        "A: Well, they were pretty weak, for one thing. And they were \u2014 they were \u2014 they\ncooperated and they\u2019d tell us where anybody was, and all that stuff. They showed us\nhow they had to sleep on bare boards and that, they didn\u2019t have no blankets, and\nheck, it was wintertime. Gee whiz, they must have froze to death trying to sleep\ntogether. They \u2014 th-that\u2019s the \u2014 that\u2019s the way it was, they \u2014 they had a hard life.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Yes, at \u2014 that\u2019s what a \u2014 that\u2019s what amazed me. Those Germans, they could\nspeak English as good as we could, yeah. They must \u2014 I guess they have a \u2014 have a\n\u2014all that in school, and that.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: Me-Medicine, and that?",
        "A: No, we \u2014 I \u2014I don\u2019t know whether they did it after we pulled out or not, but we\ndi \u2014 we didn\u2019t stop for that. But our \u2014 our job was to keep them running so they\ndidn\u2019t get a chance to dig in. Now, this one, where I was telling you about how they\nwere shooting at me that time, well, that was one of them, one of the places we\ncaught up to them. But there, what they did, they captured our \u2014 our s-scouts and th-\nthen they found out that the w-wa \u2014 from them, I guess, what wa-was behind them,\nwhich was us. [coughs] Excuse me. And \u2014 but we \u2014 we managed pretty good, I\nthought \u2014 [break] that, you know, is down, I\u2019m telling you.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Boy, you\u2019re gonna have a lot to sa \u2014 listen to.",
        "A: Well, I-I imagine I wa \u2014 wa \u2014 oh yeah, I was over in \u2014 I was in England, cause\nthat\u2019s where I got ba \u2014 that\u2019s where I got into the infantry.",
        "A: See, I wanted to be in the infantry anyhow, and they \u2014 so they put me in with the\n42\u21224 Rainbow division. And \u2014 and if you were over there, maybe even \u2014 maybe you\nwas even in that. Was you in the Ra-Rainbow division, or weren\u2019t you?",
        "A: Oh, the \u2014 oh, the \u2014 when they dropped the bomb. That\u2019s when the \u2014 cause I was\n\u2014I was going to school then, over there, cause that \u2014 the wa \u2014 the war was already\nover there. The Germans told me when the war was over, but I blame near shot the\nguys, cause I figure he was a German and that he\u2019s the guy to shoot. So, I started to\nhear these trucks coming down through the fields and that with the headlights on,\nand it was \u2014 it was daylight. Anyhow, I thought, who in the \u2014 we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t\nunderstand because we didn\u2019t get wind of any war being over. The Germans were\nthe ones that told us the war was over. Anyhow, this \u2014\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Soldiers.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They \u2014 they were coming down, they were coming back from the front lines\ntheirselves and they\u2019re coming right into \u2014 into our section where we were at. And I\nblame near s-start shooting at them, because after all, they were my \u2014 my enemies.\nAnd \u2014 and this one \u2014 and this one soldier said to me, he was sitting in the back of\nthe truck, he says, didn\u2019t you hear the news? I said no, what news? He says, the war\nis over. I says, it is? I said, nobody told me about it. He \u2014 that\u2019s how I found out,\nfrom the Germans, that the war was over.",
        "A: Pretty darn good. I was still alive.",
        "A: Not very long, I\u2019d say \u2014 well, maybe a week, two weeks at the most.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, that, that was \u2014 that was heaven. I \u2014 I was up at the [indecipherable] that\u2019s\nwhere they bought me, when I got off the ship. We got on the ship when \u2014 and I \u2014\nOctober 8, 2010\nand darn if I didn\u2019t get seasick on the dumb thing. And I crossed that ocean four\ntimes. An \u2014 anyhow, we ca\u2014I come and I got on the train, and the train conductor,\nI said to him, does this train stop in Latrobe? He says no. I said, well where does it\nstop at? Pittsburgh. Well, I said, Pittsburgh, I said, it\u2019s just as far as \u2014 I was in\nJohnstown at this time. An-And he told me, you know, that he stopped at\nJohnstown and the next stop was Pittsburgh. And I said, I don\u2019t want to get off at\nPittsburgh. Well, he says, that\u2019s tough luck, he says, the train doesn\u2019t co \u2014 stop\nanywhere else. So what I did, I \u2014 I hitchhiked home. And here I \u2014 first there was a \u2014\na young couple, they brought their bro \u2014 the girl\u2019s brother, I think it was, back. He\nwas going back into the service again, he was out on furlough. And this was in\nJohnstown. So then I \u2014 so that the \u2014 when my train come then, why, I asked the\nconductor, I said, th-this \u2014 does this train stop in Latrobe? He says no. I said, well,\nwhere does it stop at? He says Pittsburgh. I said, well heck, that\u2019s too far away. I\nsaid, that\u2019s about as far as I am now, and \u2014 cause Johnstown and Pittsburgh about\nthe same distance. So anyhow, instead of going \u2014 coming home on the train, I\nhitchhiked a ride. And this young couple that brought her brother back to \u2014 to leave\non the train there in Johnstown, why they picked me up and they took me so far,\nand then I was stuck, I was out on the highway there, and there was \u2014 there was\nsnow, and the blowing, and I was about freezing to death, and anyhow, I-I was\nstanding there thumbing, you know, and here comes a trailer truck with a bighearted\nOctober 8, 2010\nguy behind the wheel. He stopped. He said, how far you going there Joe? And I\nsays Latrobe. He says, hop in, he says, I\u2019m going past there practically, he says. So\nI jumped in there and \u2014 and \u2014 and we stopped at one place there and he got coffee\nand that \u2014 and I called my wife up, it was after \u2014 after midnight then. I said, I\u2019m\ngetting closer [indecipherable] I said, I\u2019m co \u2014 I\u2019m a-coming. So then yeah, I says,\nhe\u2019s gonna let me off here at \u2014 you know when you get to \u2014 on the highway out\nthere where it comes to Latrobe. And I says, y \u2014 he said he\u2019d let me off there. And\nI said, we\u2019ll be there in a little while, I says, he stopped to get a cup of coffee, and I\nsays, then \u2014 and then we\u2019ll be on our way. Well, he di \u2014 he lets me off at \u2014 right at\nthe crossroads there, and when he pulled out, here comes a \u2014 the old Ford out with\nmy wife in it. My wife and two of her aunts and her brother, and he was driving the\ncar. I\u2019ll always remember him, he says, you sure you got the right guy? So anyhow,\nthat was our \u2014 my trip home. Then I went down to my \u2014 my dad\u2019s place to see my\nmother and dad, and that was al-almost three o\u2019clock in the morning. And then\nMom says to me, she says, [indecipherable] here, you take my bed, you and Jenny\ntake my bed and I'll go sleep with Dad. So that\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s the way we did then,\nfor that night. Boy, it \u2014 it was wonderful being home, I\u2019Il tell you. She come a-\nrunning \u2014 she come running out of the car and she met me the halfway on \u2014 on the \u2014\non the highway. We were standing out there necking and it\u2019s a wonder we didn\u2019t get\nrun over. But it was \u2014 1t was something though, to see her again. I said, see, I told\nOctober 8, 2010\nyou I was going to g \u2014 make it home. But I had quite a few times \u2014 I even had an\nairplane shooting at me. He \u2014 he \u2014 he was strafing our \u2014 our outfit. We were co \u2014\nwe were in a convoy, and then \u2014 and again I was up riding on the tank. We did a lot\nof tank riding. And here he comes down the line, and at first \u2014 we were \u2014 first saw\nhim, why the one guy says, ah look, here come one of our fighter planes. Well just\nabout the time we looked, he opened up both guns on his plane, you know, he had\none on each wing. And \u2014 well, there is only one wing, it was only one wing on\nthem, I think. Anyhow, on the side of propeller was a machine gun. Now, when we\nsaw the bu \u2014 the tracers coming out of that \u2014 out of those wings, we knew that he\nwas not our friend at all. So anyway, I went and I put a\u2014a-\u2014a rifle grenade on my\nrifle. I hurry up and got that on and got it all ready for him. I was ga \u2014 because heck,\nhe was only about as high as the ceiling here. And so he\u2019s coming down, he was\nshoo \u2014 he \u2014 he did some damage and he killed a few guys, but \u2014 but he missed me.\nAnyhow, the guys all jumped off that tank but me. I stayed on and I \u2014 me and the \u2014\nand the machine gunner. I wanted to see that machine gunner bring that plane down.\nHeck, he was only that high, I was \u2014 couldn\u2019t see how he could possibly miss it. So,\nwe could see his bullets going \u2014 going down, you know, and when they were \u2014\nwhen he was shooting at \u2014 at all the rest, you know, as he\u2019s coming down the line.\nSo anyhow, I \u2014 let\u2019s see now. Oh, I\u2019m already with the grenade, that\u2019s it. So I got it\nready for him and I had the safety off of my rifle, and I had it to my shoulder, and I\nOctober 8, 2010\nhad that \u2014 had the play up \u2014 taken up on the \u2014 on the trigger. All I had to do is just\nput a little bit of pressure on it and it would have went off. So, when I s \u2014 looked at\nhim, and I says, heck sakes, this here \u2014 this grenade is supposed to cover a 50 foot\ndiameter, you know, like a circle. And I said, if I hit him, I\u2019m going to blow my\nown head off. I said, that\u2019s not going to be any good. So I didn\u2019t shoot. But I was\ngoing down there and \u2014 down there because a-another plane come right behind him,\nand the guys start shooting at him. And here he \u2014 he pulled his plane up so you\ncould see the bottom of his wings, where he had our insignia on it. And th-the\nAmerican insignia was a flag. And so then they, course, they stopped shooting at\nhim. So then I watched him and when he come down a piece, went a piece, why I \u2014\nI don\u2019t know how that German knew that guy but \u2014 that guy was behind him \u2014 but\nanyway, he climbed for altitude. Now he went up, I would say, approximately a\nthousand feet. Now ma \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 might be a way off, but anyhow, when he made\na circle, well the \u2014 the other di\u2014 guy who made a circle, the German, so did our\nman right behind him, when he circled. And he ga-gave two bursts out o-of his \u2014 his\n\u2014 his \u2014 our man did, at the German plane. Well, he hit him both times, and when he\nhit him, I was watching him and the \u2014 the \u2014 when he shot first, why all of a sudden\n\u2014 the plane was going like this \u2014 all of a sudden the nose dropped down, and \u2014 and\nthe plane was going down, it was heading towards the ground then. So th \u2014 our\nplane didn\u2019t shoot no more after. But the farther down he come, the more smoke\nOctober 8, 2010\ncome out of that plane. And then finally it hit the ground and it exploded. Well, I\nwatched that plane the whole way down and when it exploded, but it \u2014 th-the \u2014 the\ndriver, he-he never made it out. And he was only a young fella too, because when\nhe come down and passed there at one time, I saw him sitting in there with both\nthumbs on the \u2014 on the triggers, when he was shooting at me. And I thought, if I\nstand still, he\u2019Il miss me. Well, I had the bullets coming both sides of me. Well, the\none \u2014 the one side, he got pretty close at getting me on that one, because I was\nleaning against the \u2014 the duffle bags of the \u2014 of the g-g \u2014 G.I.s in the \u2014 in the tank.\nThey had them strapped to the [indecipherable] o-on the \u2014 on the outside of their\ntank. And two bullets went though that \u2014 that there tank I wa \u2014 or that sleeping bag\nthat I was leaning on. But I didn\u2019t know that until after he was gone. So he missed\nme again.",
        "A: About being in the war?",
        "A: Oh yeah. They got tired listening to me. They were just glad I was home.",
        "A: I went back to working on the \u2014 on the farm for my dad.",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 I also worked on a farm too. And I got a farm second day I was home,\nand \u2014 milking cows and stuff like that, because I liked farming. The only thing was\nthe pay, and \u2014 and then the \u2014 when the war was over, why the prices started\nclimbing, you know, and so I \u2014 my wife and I talked it over, we thought it\u2019s time I\ngot a raise. I was making a hundred dollars a month, and I got my house included in\nit. So I went to the farmer \u2014 farmer that I was working for, and I says, how about a\nraise? I says, the price of living\u2019s going higher, and my family was getting bigger\nnow, I \u2014 cause I had \u2014 I had two \u2014 two children right 1n a row, one right after the\nother practically. And I \u2014 and I had a daughter and a \u2014 and a son. And so, course I\nmade extra \u2014 the expenses. He says, oh, you just had to tell me Jenny is \u2014 that was\nmy wife\u2019s name \u2014 she\u2019|l have to live within her means. Oh boy, did she blow up\nwhen I told her that. That didn\u2019t \u2014 that didn\u2019t the \u2014 hit right. So anyhow, I looked\naround, I started looking around, and I\u2019ve si \u2014 and I found a \u2014 a guy owned a horse\nfarm, a Mr. Steiner, Steiner was his name, and I went to see him. Oh, he says, how\nmuch do you want paid? Well, I was making a hundred and \u2014 hundred and five\ndollars a month before, and I says 200 dollars a month. He says all right, and he\ntook it. So I was \u2014 I worked with him then for oh, a good while. And \u2014 but so then\nhere, after we \u2014 after we lived there, we lived in \u2014 right on the farm, the horse farm,\nwe had about 40 horses. And he had good horses there, well \u2014 well bred stock. And\nso I went and \u2014 well, he \u2014 he went and he \u2014 he wanted my wife to do a lot of stuff\nOctober 8, 2010\nfor nothing. And he was a millionaire himself, the bugger. So anyhow, you\u2019d \u2014 she\n\u2014 she \u2014 sh-sh \u2014 it wa \u2014 it wa \u2014 it was out of this world. She wasn\u2019t able to do that\nbecause she was taking care of like \u2014 say like me and my \u2014 my \u2014 well, my \u2014 my\nsister \u2014 my daughter and son. I had a daughter and a son then. So then they \u2014 they\nwere \u2014 they were \u2014 they were born, a-and whenever \u2014 whenever we got the job \u2014\nwell, I got the job, and so I was working, I was taking care of these horses. We had\nabout 40 horses altogether. And I liked that job, it was pretty nice. But the only\nthing is, he wanted her to do a lot of extra work. Now, he was used to having fellas\nthere that had foreign women for wives. They went in and they did all that work for\nnothing, and that\u2019s what he wanted, see? And I said to him one day, I said, Mr.\nSteiner, I said, I\u2019m the one that applied for the job, not my wife. I said, she got \u2014\nshe got the house to take care of and two kids \u2014 we had two kids now, we had a girl\nand a boy, and \u2014 or a boy and a girl, I should say. And \u2014 and I says, she got two kids\nand a house to \u2014 and a house to take care of and me, and I said, that\u2019s enough for\none woman. So then, here she \u2014 here she got all worked up over some stuff or\nsomething, and she wound up at a hospital. Well, while she was in the hospital,\nwhich was about three weeks, he didn\u2019t allow me off the farm to go see her. And\nthat didn\u2019t go down very good. So \u2014 and she come home, she\u2019s mad as a wet hen\nand \u2014 and so I says, well, I couldn\u2019t help it, I said, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what he \u2014 he\nwouldn\u2019t let me go, and I says, and I had to have a job. So then, one day I come in \u2014\nOctober 8, 2010\nwell, we got it all straightened out with him then, about that. And then one day I\ncome in the house and she\u2019s sitting there in her pa \u2014 kitchen crying. I said, what\u2019s\nthe matter honey? Oh, Mr. Steiner is here \u2014 was here. I go, what in the heck did he\nwant now\u201d? She says, he says, well, I got you at least doing some \u2014 some things. He\nwanted her to milk the \u2014 we had two cows. He wanted her to milk the cows, strain\nthe milk; we had a cream separator. Churn \u2014 churn the cream into butter and we \u2014\nwe \u2014 we would get a \u2014 I think two pound of butter a week for doing that, that was\ngoing to be our pay. And \u2014 and I says, doggone him anyhow. I says \u2014 I says, I\u2019m\ngonna quit. I says, the Russians haven\u2019t taken over yet. So \u2014 so I\u2014 I quit. And he \u2014\noh, he said when I told him that next morning, I said Mr. Steiner, I got bad news for\nyou today. And I think this was on Thursday. I says, Saturday is my last day\nworking here. He says, I kind of figured you do something like that. And I said,\nwell, I says, I gotta look out for my wife. And I says, she\u2019s not that healthy. So\nanyhow, he says \u2014 all he said was, see that you have your furniture on the truck by\ndinnertime on Saturday. And on Saturday we had a \u2014 our furniture on this truck and\nno place to put it. So \u2014 so then her aunt, she was living in a \u2014 a red brick house on\ntop of the hill by sing \u2014 Saint Xavier\u2019s. Do you rig \u2014 do you know where Saint\nXavier\u2019s is? Oh, well anyhow, it\u2019s on the other side of Latrobe up on \u2014 up on the\nhighway. Well, 1t was, it burnt down there, they had a fire and they cli \u2014 that took\ncare of that. So anyway, why \u2014 we go \u2014 we got out of that jo \u2014 well, anyway, well,\nOctober 8, 2010\nwhat I did, my dad and mother\u2019s neighbor, he worked at Latrobe Steel. And I\ncalled him up. And I knew him and I told him who it was and I says, how\u2019s the\nchance of getting a job down Latrobe Steel? And he says, pretty good. And he\nsays, I gotta go to Pittsburgh tomorrow, but he says, before I go down \u2014 go, I'll get\nthe ball rolling, and you call me at six o\u2019clock tomorrow night. Then I says, all\nright. So at six o\u2019clock the next night I called him and he says, where do you want\nto go to work, it\u2019s all set up for you. I says \u2014 I says, well, when\u2019s the next time that I\ncan \u2014 when can I start? And he says, how about Monday? I said, good deal, because\nthis 1s \u2014 I think this was Saturday whene \u2014 I called him. A-Anyway, I went. So I w \u2014\nI went there on Monday and \u2014 and th-that\u2019s when I started, and I worked there 35\nyears. I became a ham \u2014 a hammer driver. And we \u2014 boy, I\u2019Il tell you, I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve I made money so easy. Yeah, you know. So, th-they \u2014 the first job I had the\n\u2014 was shoveling a \u2014 a load of gravel, spreading it out. Another guy and I, we went\ndown and down and we got them shovels and we had this big pile of gravel there\nand we st \u2014 we s-spread it all out for a roadway there where \u2014 where it was they\nwere making, and all we did was sit around the rest of the day waiting for someone\nto come out and get us. And they paid us for it. I couldn\u2019t believe it the \u2014 1t was that\nway. So then that\u2019s when I was wishing I\u2019d started when I come home from work \u2014\nfrom the army.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: What about it?",
        "A: Yeah, I think in a way it did.",
        "A: Well, I found out that y-you didn\u2019t get everything for nothing, you had to work,\ntoo, you know. And \u2014 and th \u2014 I \u2014 and I really enjoyed working at Latrobe still,\nespecially when I become a hammer driver [indecipherable] and a lot of the times\nth-the driver wouldn't feel like going to work or something, he\u2019d take off. Well, that\nmeant th-there\u2019d be an o-opening for another driver for that shift. And boy, I did a\nlot of overtime, get time and a half for it.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Yeah?\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Well, he-he \u2014 he seemed to like it okay. H-He \u2014 he be \u2014 he was a Marine. That\u2019s\nthe one that\u2019s here now, Jerry. And he was a Marine and \u2014 and course we ha-had to\nmake fun of him being a Marine. And he s \u2014I said, guess what the \u2014 what the guys\nin \u2014 in the army call the Marines? And he says [indecipherable] and I says, it\u2019s\nworse than that. I forget now just what we did call them now, but we used to say\nthat \u2014 that they \u2014 they always were looking for a fight. And then ti \u2014 so I said to\nhim, he \u2014 he has a little dog his wife bought, and oh he\u2019s a \u2014 a little house dog, he\u2019s\nonly about that \u2014 so long. And the little bugger, he\u2019s always wanting to pick a fight\nwith somebody. I always tell my son, I says, this darn dog of yours got Marine in\nhim. He says, how do you figure that? I says, he always wants to have a fight. I\nsaid, he don\u2019t care how big the dog is, he\u2019s gonna fight with him anyhow.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, we had \u2014 we talked about that, but he \u2014 he\u2019s the only one in the\nfamily that went oh \u2014 no-none of the other boys went. And then | had a brother, he\nwas a\u2014 Dick. He was in World War II like I was. He \u2014 he be \u2014 he was a\u2014a\nmachine gunner, and he got smacked in the head once with a bullet exploded th-th \u2014\nthat the pilot was shooting at him when he was going on a mission. And \u2014 and he\nOctober 8, 2010\nwas a [indecipherable] gunner is what he was. Anyhow, the bullet missed him and\nit hit the ceiling beside him, ba \u2014 right in back of him, and smacked him in the back\nof the head. And as a result, he lost the sight in this eye. Him and I got the same\nsight, only different his eye \u2014 I lost mine from my own dumbness. When I was five\nyears old, I broke this here pop bottle with a hammer and as a result, why they took\n35 pieces of glass out of my eye, and par \u2014 and part of the pupil. And that left me\nwith a 15/200 vision. Well, that\u2019s no vision at all, and so \u2014 yeah, I\u2014 I w \u2014 I would \u2014\nI would s \u2014 be driving along, if I was in a straight stretch or something, I would shut\nthe one eye, leave that \u2014 leave that one open, see, and I couldn\u2019t even see the road\nwith the darn thing.",
        "A: That I\u2019d want people to know?",
        "A: Well, I guess it\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 it was all exciting, you know, especially,\nyou know, when the shooting started. And I used to write home to my wife and if it\nwould be raining or something, and I\u2019d be out there in a foxhole, I\u2019d tell her, well\nhoney, I got running water in my house today. Yeah. So, I betcha \u2014 I imagine she\nwas pretty well worked up.\nOctober 8, 2010",
        "A: Was the what?",
        "A: I think it was. Yeah, I really do. Of course, it\u2019s not so good shooting one another.\nBut I used to think when I was over there, now here I am up here in the \u2014 in \u2014 let\u2019s\nsay like the front lines, I\u2019m shooting a lot of these guys and I says, I never seen\nthose fellas before in my life. I said, he never done nothing to me, nothing like that.\nSo why I\u2019m out there trying to kill them, you know? And then about that time they\nwould shoo \u2014 take a shot at me and it darn near hit me, then so I start shooting back.",
        "A: Okay. You wa \u2014",
        "A: You mean you\u2019re all over?",
