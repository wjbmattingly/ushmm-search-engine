        "Q: So you probably didn\u2019t even know where Germany was.",
        "A: No, but we weren\u2019t involved, as I say.

They\ndidn\u2019t touch us until \u00b044.",
        "Q: So from 1940 when the Hungarians came in until 1944 they did little other than\nclose down the schools.",

        "Q: And draft ...",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no they did lots of other things.",

They didn\u2019t leave you alone, they were, right away they\nshowed their anti-Semitism in many, many ways. But it wasn\u2019t as bad as when\nthey took us into the ghetto.",
        "Q: Now another thing you mentioned earlier, your oldest brother he was drafted into\nthe Hungarian army labor service.",
        "A: Yeah, labor service, right and he worked in the coal mines and then he worked in\nthe battlefield, they didn\u2019t let Jew fight, they couldn\u2019t fight. So he had to clean up\nthe, after the battle, clean up the bodies. That was his job and he got liberated by\nthe Russians and six months before, in \u00b044, 1945, I would say in January, six\nmonths before the war ended. So he came back home to Ruscova.",
        "Q: Now were there other changes under the Hungarians that you remember, other\nthan the ones we\u2019ve just mentioned?",
        "A: Well, they came around, the Germans came around and they started to say they\u2019re\ngoing to start a ghetto.",
        "Q: This is in 1944?",
        "A: In 19...before 1944.",
        "Q: The Germans came in before 1944?",
        "A: Germans came in and they said that they\u2019re going to have a ghetto, they\u2019re just\ngoing to have us together, just for the duration of the war, and then they planned a\nghetto and then they made the ghetto and",

        "A: I was always in Ruscova.",
        "Q: How about any of your brothers and sisters, other than the brother who was in the\nHungarian army, were there other members of the family?",
        "A: Well, my sister she was the one who went to Budapest, in 42 or \u201943, in between\nthen she went to Budapest and she was a dressmaker so she was able to go there\nand work. And then when it became so bad for the Jews she had these Christian\nfriends and they got the Christian papers and she lived under the Christian name\nall those months, but it was very, very stressful for her. Very scary for her and\none man found out she\u2019s Jewish and he was going to report her and she was\nhidden for three days, she was hidden and without food or drink or anything and\nshe was very upset. Finally she said she doesn\u2019t care, she has to give up and go\nout and see and go out because she can\u2019t stay there and what ill happen will\nhappen. She found out that her Christian friends were looking for her and they\ncouldn\u2019t find her. That man that was going to report her, got killed by the first\nRussian bombs when the Russians started to invade Budapest. He got killed with\nthe first Russian bomb, so she got saved.",
        "Q: She knew that? Did she know that he\u2019d been killed?",
        "A: After she got out, after the three days of hiding, she said she can\u2019t stay there any\nmore, she\u2019s thirsty, she\u2019s hungry, there is nothing there. She got very scared, she\nsays, they\u2019ll send her to a concentration camp, they\u2019ll send her if they catch her.\nThere is nothing she could do any more. So that\u2019s when her friends told her, the\nChristian friends, \u201cI was looking for you, Lily, I was looking for you. That man\ngot killed with the first Russian bomb.\u201d",
        "Q: Did she know how this guy knew she was Jewish?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know how he knew....oh he kind of guessed, he kind of guessed.\nShe didn\u2019t look Jewish at all because she\u2019s blonde, and German she spoke. So the\nblonde people and speaking German, you could get away with it.",
        "Q: So your sister Lily could speak German?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Had she learned it in Ruscova?",
        "A: Yeah, we had a German family there and, like I spoke to them too. We were\nfriends with the kids and we spoke to them, so you picked up these languages\nfrom that area, which I forgot most of hem because I don\u2019t use them.",
        "Q: Was Lily able to send letters to Ruscova?",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "Q: No, so there was no correspondence?",
        "A: But I knew where she lived so when I came back from the concentration camp I\nstopped off in Budapest and I found her. She lived at 31 , and it\u2019s still\nthere.",
        "Q: On the Pesht side of the river.",
        "A: Yes, when I went the last time I went to look at that street again at that house, I\nfound it.",
        "Q: But until 1944, you living in this small remote town, near the Carpathians, the\nHungarian police are running the town?",
        "A: Well the Hungarian police and we had, I told you, the aristocratic Hungarian\nfamily and they had a lot of children and their children took over everything. And\neverybody was kind of their slave, you had to do what they say, they said, and\nwhen you met any of them you had to say \u201c \u201d which you know what\nthat means, \u201cI kiss your hand.\u201d And to the older ones, the elderly you had to go\nover and kiss their hand, if not they would let your parents know that the children\nweren\u2019t nice to them and they were very anti-Semitic, but when my brother came\nhome and two other guys came home, from the they were going to kill\nthem. So they took the Russian soldiers and they got after them, but somehow\nthey found out and they all ran away and they don\u2019t live in Ruscova any more,\nthey live in ;",
        "Q: So when the Hungarians took over this local Hungarian aristocrat became the\nmaster of the area?",
        "A: The masters of the area.",
        "Q: In all probability, this same family controlled the area before the Romanians took\nover in 1918.",
        "A: They owned a lot of property, a lot. They happened to live right across the street\nfrom us, fortunate we were, huh? But, so we had to be their slaves all the time. I\nmean, whatever they wanted we had to do for them, baby sit, go shopping for\nthem.",
        "Q: So you would describe them as anti-Jewish?",
        "A: Oh yes, and yet they were only friends with the Jewish people, they didn\u2019t have\nother people to be friends with.",
        "Q: The Slovaks were probably not their friends.",
        "A: They were too, very common people.",
        "Q: And Ukrainians.",
        "A: Very common people, they were not better class, so the only body they can\nmingle with was the Jews. So, they were all very friendly with the Jews. I played\nwith their children and their grandchildren.",
        "Q: Until...",
        "A: Until...",
        "Q: The deportation.",
        "A: Yes, I played with them because they lived across the street and we were all\nfriends. My mother was very good friends with them.",
        "Q: Did she do sewing, dressmaking for them?",
        "A: Oh yes, they would pay in food, most people paid in food -- beans, flour, potatoes,\nchicken.",
        "Q: Would you happen to remember their last name, this aristocratic family?",
        "A: You know, I really couldn\u2019t tell you because we called them the Preesin. You\nknow what that means the Preesin? It\u2019s like a queen or a king.",
        "Q: The lords?",
        "A: The lords, like. That\u2019s what we referred to them. They\u2019re all in now\nbecause when I came home none of them were found, they were all gone. They\nran for their lives because they knew what they did and they were afraid the\nRussians were going to get them. One thing the Russians, they paid back for\npeople, what they knew were bad.",
        "Q: Were there any Hungarian fascists, Herrocross, in your town?",
        "A: No, the only thing what happened, I remember once, maybe they came the\nHerrocross or somebody, they instigated those Christians there and for a little\nwhile they were very anti-Semitic, but then it calmed down. Okay, like on\nChristmas and Easter we would be afraid to go out, we kind of, even during the\nRomanians we kind of didn\u2019t go out too much because we were afraid of them,\nthe Christians what they would do. So we kind of stayed out of their way. But\notherwise they left us alone, they didn\u2019t bother with us too much.",
        "Q: There weren\u2019t any pogroms?",
        "A: No, never.",

        "Q: Did your parents ever consider emigrating?",
        "A: Many, many years ago they considered emigrating to Brazil, when Brazil opened\nkind of? Or Argentina, I don\u2019t remember the land. But it fell through, they never\ndid. We had our aunt here which was my father\u2019s sister, so probably one of us\nwould have come eventually, one of the children. And once one came, they\nbrought out the rest.",
        "Q: And you were still a little girl during these years, did you have any particular\ndreams about what you would do when you grew up or where you would go?",
        "A: Well, there was one thing I always used to think to myself that I\u2019m going to work\nfor whatever I need, but I want to have everything nice. I was always thinking\nthat to myself, that I like nice things and I would work for it. And that\u2019s what ?'m\ndoing, I\u2019m still working to get whatever I like and whatever I want.",
        "Q: How about your sister Lily now, she actually grew up and went to Budapest, did\nshe have particular goals in mind, particular job or ...",
        "A: She was a dressmaker, you really had, what should I say, you didn\u2019t have much in\nmind, the only thing you thought of was growing up and getting married and\nhaving children, actually because that\u2019s what everybody did. Here too in\nAmerica, the same way, nobody had any careers in their mind.",

        "Q: No work, no income, no school?",
        "A: They were good at doing that, making the Jew into imbecile. No work, no\nbathroom facilities so then you\u2019re a filthy pig, of course.",
        "Q: Were you able to go out?",
        "A: In the ghetto, not outside the ghetto.",

        "Q: Six months before?",
        "A: Maybe eight months, I\u2019m not so sure. You know, you didn\u2019t pay attention to\nanything because we always figured it\u2019s only during the war and after the war it\nwill all go back to normal.",

        "A: The police again.",
        "Q: They made the announcement?",
        "A: They made the announcement that we were going to the other ghetto, the main\nghetto, in Czechoslovakia.",
        "Q: In Czechoslovakia, they said. And how much time did you have to get ready for\nthis trip?",
        "A: No time at all. No time at all. Right away. They didn\u2019t let you know in advance\nanything. If we would have run away maybe. Maybe some of us would have run\naway. Can you imagine. I can\u2019t believe that people were so ignorant to believe\nall those lies.",

        "A: The Jewish council. They should have known. They were saying, \u201cFollow\ninstructions\u201d. Now I guarantee those Hungarian aristocrats knew what was going\non. But they didn\u2019t tell anybody because they were friends with all the Hungarian\nofficers and I\u2019m sure the officers knew what was going on.",
        "Q: So suddenly you are ordered to report to the train station for another trip?",
        "A: Yes. They stacked us in again, locked the doors and that was it. And unlocked\nthem and Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Now this time, was it a passenger train?",
        "A: No, a cattle train.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know that until you got on the train?",
        "A: When we got on the train. But that was cattle train. It was nightmare. Plain,\nplain nightmare. Then when we arrived and we finally thought we were arriving\nsomeplace, like I was going to help my mother with the little sister to take her out\nof the train, and one of the workers, the Jewish workers, pushed me away. I\nunderstand they did it to a lot of people. They saved a lot of young girls. Because\nif you had a child in your hands, you went to the crematorium immediately; if you\nwere a certain age an a certain time and a certain body, they sent you to work so I\nguess those Jewish workers unloading the people from those trains, they knew\nwhat\u2019s what so as I was going to help with the child, he pushed me away and he\nsays I should go away. I didn\u2019t know, so I listened and that\u2019s the last I saw of the\nfamily.",

        "Q: And you were alone after this?",
        "A: Yes. Everything is rush, rush, rush. They take you away and I thought I\u2019d see\nthem. They told you you\u2019d meet the parents at night. So then they took us to a\ndifferent place, they showered us and they cut off our hair and took away our\nclothes and gave us the camp clothes. The striped uniforms, whatever. No hair.\nNobody recognized any body Everybody thought, \u201cI don\u2019t look like that, I don\u2019t\nlook like that\u2019. You didn\u2019t have a mirror, you didn\u2019t see yourself. Until one day,\nI saw myself in a window. The kitchen had windows. Our barracks didn\u2019t have\nwindows.",
        "Q: Now, when you got on the train, your family was together?",
        "A: We were all together.",
        "Q: And a lot of the people that were on the train, you knew them?",
        "A: Everybody, we knew everybody.",
        "Q: Now, the trip you say took bout four days?",
        "A: Four days and four nights.",
        "Q: What did people do, what did they say, what did they think?",
        "A: They cried and cried and cried and cried and cried and cried ----- the kids cried,\nthe people cried, we all cried. We didn\u2019t have a bathroom facilities, we didn\u2019t\nhave water. The little children were thirsty, we gave them urine to drink.",
        "Q: Nobody fed you during the trip, no water to drink?",
        "A: Just what you took with you. We didn\u2019t know what to take or how long it would\ntake or anything like that. We didn\u2019t take water, we didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know where you were going?",
        "A: It rained one day so we stuck a cup through the wire window, we stuck out a cup\nto catch a little rain. It was a horrible, horrible experience.",
        "Q: And when you arrive it is even worse.",
        "Q: When you arrive, it\u2019s even worse. They rush, rush, rush, rush, here, there.\nMengele did the picking.",
        "Q: Was it daylight when you arrived?",
        "A: Daylight. He did the picking. As I say, I didn\u2019t have a child so I went that way. I\ndidn\u2019t know anything.",
        "Q: Were there any friends with you after the selection?",
        "A: Yes, my cousins, my friends. We stayed together the whole time.",
        "Q: What were you forced to do?",
        "A: Well, we got into the saylager in Auschwitz and we chopped down stones, broke\nup stones and carried them to a certain spot. Then we had to, every morning the\nsaylafeller, I don\u2019t if you heard about that, the saylafeller, we fainted away, me\ntoo, we all fainted away, cause we stood there for hours in the same spot. And\nthat went on for six months, from May to October",
        "Q: This was the first time you\u2019d seen Germans, in Auschwitz?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Now, you were there until the fall of 1944.",
        "A: And you know what they did? On Yom Kippur, they came to see if we were\neating. They didn\u2019t want us to fast. So some girls didn\u2019t fast. I fasted. Some girls\ndidn\u2019t fast so they were eating and they were satisfied to see some girls eat.",
        "Q: What was the normal food when you weren\u2019t fasting?",
        "A: Well, you got a slice of bread, that sawdust bread that\u2019s what we called it. Soup\nand a piece of liverwurst for dinner and that was it.",
        "Q: So a normal day was almost a fast?",
        "A: Oh yes. What was it, 600 calories. How long could you survive on 600 calories,\nlike six months or so and then you should die.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s about how long you were there.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how long I was there.",
        "Q: Performing hard labor for those months.",
        "A: Definitely, definitely. And no clothes and no nothing. So, all that.",
        "Q: And you knew what was going on in the rest of the camp?",
        "A: Let\u2019s say we saw the smoke from the crematorium. Next door to us there was a\ngypsy camp also. And one morning we woke up and they weren\u2019t there. So they\ntook care of them very quickly. We didn\u2019t see any of the crematorium, we only\nsaw smoke.",
        "Q: Did you know they were gas chambers?",
        "A: We knew, and we knew and as I say I couldn\u2019t believe it. I couldn\u2019t absorb what\nwas going on. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I couldn\u2019t understand it. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\nI just didn\u2019t believe that this could be going on. I always said we going to meet\nmy family when this war is over. They were in a separate working camp and I\u2019Il\nmeet the family. Until I went into the working camp, the labor camp, and then I\nbegan to realize I think, they gave us that stuff in Auschwitz that we shouldn\u2019t get\nour period.. I think that made me very blurred because I remember not being very\nclearly thinking. Could be that stuff made me not alert at all.",
        "Q: You were like in a daze while you were in Auschwitz?",
        "A: I remember always thinking not being able to think too clearly. So it possibly was\nthat stuff.",
        "Q: Did you see any people getting killed with your own eyes?\nA I was very fortunate. I didn\u2019t see anything like that. I saw once a lady went on\nthe barbed wire. She didn\u2019t want to live any more so she threw herself on the\nelectric wire and she died. The only thing I knew, we had a hospital in Saylag,\nthe only thing I knew nobody should go to the hospital.",
        "Q: And why was that?",
        "A: Because then if they would go to the hospital, we would never see them again. So\nI happened to have been, as you say I ate very good and I was a healthy child and\nI was able to .... And in our area we weren\u2019t spoiled people. We were used to\nworking hard. And we weren\u2019t used to sleeping on a soft bed because we had the\nwooded boards and a straw mattress and rough sheets. We didn\u2019t have the fine\nlinens like the city people had. And things like that. So we were able to\nwithstand all that hardships better than city people. That\u2019s why a lot of us\nsurvived.",
        "Q: From your town?",
        "A: From my town. I would say, and I\u2019m sure from a lot of other little towns. But if\nyou were from any kind of softer upbringing you couldn\u2019t survive. Today, I\ncouldn\u2019t survive that. My children could never survive because you would just go\non that wire and kill yourself because it wouldn\u2019t pay to live. You have to give up\nall that. But we were very roughened up.",
        "Q: O.K., we were talking about what it was like as a survivor.",
        "A: As I was saying, city people could never survive. And they didn\u2019t. They fell like\nflies. They couldn\u2019t handle that bad situation.",
        "Q: What else in your opinion, were important factors in survival in a place like\nAuschwitz?",
        "A: Well, the thing was this. We were together. When they say misery wants\ncompany, that\u2019s the truth. We were all in the same situation. Nobody was any\ndifferent. We were all kind of young and there wasn\u2019t mature person who was\nmarried and had children because once you had children, you went straight with\nyour children. And we kind of stuck together the whole time. So that you didn\u2019t\nfeel alone. You had your family, people that you grew up with, with you. Your\nfamily, your friends, everybody. And then we slept like herrings, you know like a\ncan of herrings, this way and that way, that\u2019s how we slept, seven this way and\nseven that way and one blanket. And you couldn\u2019t turn around. And that\u2019s how\nyou had to sleep, the way you lay down, that\u2018s how you had to sleep on the same\nside. And the one that was at the end, was never covered. That was Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Now, when some people describe Auschwitz, they describe what you just\ndescribed. They cooperated and helped one another. Others, sometimes depicted\nAuschwitz where everyone 1s trying to survive and where even a little bit of food\nis something you fight for. Did you see any of that?",
        "A: I saw some of that, yes, not amongst us. Not amongst our friends. I saw some\npeople were able to go into the kitchen, they went into the kitchen and they did\nget something extra and like you say, they would kill you for it.",
        "Q: Now you were with women all the time, you were separated from men?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: It would be interesting to do a comparative study of how women behaved with\neach other and how men behaved.",
        "Q: Our barrack, I tell you -- there was never any incidents in our barrack. They\ncame, they brought a pot of hot water, whatever it was. They gave you in a bowl\na little scoop full, a ladle of hot water and you took it and you ate it and the bread\nand the kopel that we had happened to be a nice woman. And thanks to her, we\nwent into the best labor camp when we went to work in the working camp when\nthey sent us.",
        "Q: When you were transferred from Auschwitz?",
        "A: When we were transferred from Auschwitz. I think it was thanks to her; she was\na nice intelligent woman. It must have been hard that she kept us in line,\nwhatever.",
        "Q: Was she Hungarian?",
        "A: Czechoslovakian.",
        "Q: So someone you never, nobody knew before?",
        "A: You see, all the people in charge were Polish or Czechoslovakian because they\nwere there years before us. Like they said, they built the camp for us. They had it\nvery, very rough. We got there, they said this is a vacation for you. Because we\nhad to build it all. They went through terrible hell, they went through.",
        "Q: You guys had a higher number than they did.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t even get the number because we were not even considered people any\nmore. Those that got a number were considered at least a worker. We were not\neven considered that. Because we were not given a number. We just had a\nnumber sewn on a piece of paper on our uniform. Most of the Hungarian Jews\ndon\u2019t have numbers. Only those that went in 1942. Like I was telling you they\ntook them whose parents weren\u2019t married and then maybe those that went at the\nbeginning but otherwise once we came, it was already they didn\u2019t want us any\nmore",
        "Q: Also when you arrived, there were such large numbers, massive.",
        "A: Day after day, day and night.",
        "Q: How did you get transferred, now, you said you think your kapo played a role in\nyour transfer?",
        "A: Well, they came, in Auschwitz you mean to go to work, they came, I have to\nmention one more thing before I get to that. One day they came and took blood\nfrom everybody for the soldiers. I held out, I didn\u2019t want to give blood. And the\npeople that they caught to give blood, they said they were never the same again\nbecause they didn\u2019t have food to make up for the loss of blood.",
        "Q: So you managed to avoid?",
        "A: I managed to avoid. I had one motto -- I run to nothing and I don\u2019t hide from\nnothing. Whatever God will give me, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll take. I had that motto.\nThat\u2019s one thing I ran way from, giving blood.",
        "Q: How did you manage to do that?",
        "A: I went to another barrack when they took our barrack. They only took the people\nin the barracks.",
        "Q: You were the only one in your barrack that did that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if others did it but I did it and I\u2019m very glad I did it.",
        "Q: Because you needed every drop of blood?",
        "A: You needed every drop of blood but those poor people, the kids said they were\nnever the same again since that blood, they were so weak.",
        "Q: Do you remember whether this was soon after you arrived or much later?",
        "A: Much later, much later. Shortly before they took us away to the working camp.\nSo anyway, the kapo said they were going to come and select us, they needed 250\ngirls for the working camp and they took you to a different area, different camp, a\ndifferent area and again they showered us, oh God, again, naked and disinfect\nyou. A man had to disinfect you, prisoners, and we were shy, so shy and so\nashamed for the man to disinfect you, with the hose, you know.",
        "Q: Do you remember when this was?",
        "A: When we got to Auschwitz and when we went to the working camp, again this\nwas.",
        "Q: No, I mean, do you remember when this was, when they were getting ready to\nmove you to the working camp?",
        "A: That was in October, October of \u201944. Then they showered us and disinfect us and\ngave us different clothes and they had us sitting in a room on concrete stairs. So\nthat\u2019s where we spent the night, on these concrete stairs. And they came and took\ntwo girls out and they sent two nurses along, so we knew it was going to be a\ngood camp. And then they sent us to the camp which was in Weisswasser and\nthey had the barracks when we got there, I don\u2019t know how long it took to get\nthere.",
        "Q: How did you get there?",
        "A: By train. From Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Weisswasser. This is in Czechoslovakia?",
        "A: Czechoslovakia, yes. Sudatin.",
        "Q: That was the German name for this place?",
        "A: Yes. There is Rodwasser also, you know, there is red water after the camp, I saw\nit. It\u2019s red water too. So when we got liberated and we took a walk to the next\ntown, there was Rodwasser and there was red water. Anyway.",
        "Q: Were you transferred in a cattle car again?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that time. It could have been a truck.",
        "Q: The disinfecting and all that occurred after you arrived in Weisswasser?",
        "A: No before, everything was in Auschwitz. In Weisswasser, we were treated like\npeople. You got your own bed, your own sheet, your own blanket.",
        "Q: So no cattle car this time?",
        "A: No cattle car. Everything, they couldn\u2019t, the Wehrmacht, that\u2019s the ,\nand the Wehrmacht ran the camp, ran the factory. They ran the camp. Actually,\nthe Nazis ran the camp. But one day one of the SS women beat up a girl for some\nreason and the next day she wasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: The SS woman wasn\u2019t there?",
        "A: Wasn\u2019t there. And there we had more food, another clothing, another change of\nclothing, they gave us.",
        "Q: Did you get warmer clothing?",
        "A: In the winter, we got warmer clothing for the winter, yes and a different pair of\nshoes already. There they treated us more like human beings. It was an\nammunition factory. You made radios for the planes and the ships, we made.\nAnd there we were until May 9\"\". It got slow after a while and we got scared they\nwere going to send us someplace else but we were very, very fortunate they didn\u2019t\nsend us away. And the Russians came in and the head of the camp even held us a\nspeech and said we should all leave the camp and go to the next town is the\nCzechs and they\u2019 ll take us in. Because the Russian soldiers will arrive and here\nthere are so many women, they\u2019Il come and rape us and that\u2019s what I did, most of\nus went away and the ones that remained, they did get raped by the Russian\nsoldiers. I did stay with a Czech family for three weeks and then I made my way\nhome which took four weeks. On top of railroads. It didn\u2019t cost you any money\nbecause there was chaos. How I ever got back, I'll never understand.",
        "Q: Because you\u2019d never been away from home?",
        "A: I'd never been away from home, I\u2019d never traveled on trains and how to get back\nfrom there to Ruscova, I don\u2019t know how I ever made it. But I got back, it took\nlike four weeks. And in between I stopped off to see my sister in Budapest. She\nremained there because she had her people, she already was getting married.",
        "Q: So she did find a husband in Budapest?",
        "A: Yes, and I came home and I found my brother there.",
        "Q: The one who had been liberated by the Russians?",
        "A: Liberated by the Russians. And a lot of other people came home and we were\nthere until October. And in October already, a lot of people started to leave\nRuscova to go back to Germany either to go to Israel or to America. So, again, it\ntook four weeks but at time already we had a lot of help. There were a lot of\norganizations already working and helping us. They had already set up places in\nBudapest where we should stay and then they smuggled us across the border to\nAustria. We went to Austria. From Austria to Germany. But there already you\nhad lots of organizations helping you. And then I wound up in a DP camp and\nin Germany in the American zone. That\u2019s because we had an aunt\nhere and we knew ---five of us came, my cousin Dave, my cousin Nathan, my\ncousin Ceil and my cousin Ruchel and me and we all made it to Germany on the\nAmerican zone. And we were there \u2018till --- I came in February 18 1947.",
        "Q: Were you in a DP camp?",
        "A: I was ina DP camp. They treated us very good in the DP camp. We had\neverything. They threw out the Germans of apartments and they gave us their\nhouses so we had a house and piano and they had kitchens for us. Or either you\ncould go and eat in the soup kitchen or you could cook yourselves. They gave us\npackages of food from the joint and then the joint took us out here. And I came\nhere on a Tuesday and Monday I went to work as a finisher. I had no trade.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t want to be a dressmaker again?",
        "A: Yeh. So I went to work as a finisher. And I worked until I became pregnant and I\ngot married two years later.",
        "Q: You got married first and then you became pregnant?",
        "A: Yes. I got married and then I became pregnant. I worked until I became\npregnant.",
        "Q: It came out the wrong way.",
        "A: In those days you didn\u2019t do those things. No, you first got married. I met my\nhusband. His mother is from my home town, from Ruscova. So, I met him. And\nwhen I met him, we couldn\u2019t even talk two words because he doesn\u2019t speak\nYiddish and I didn\u2019t speak English. I was here six weeks. So then we didn\u2019t see\neach other for a year and we met a year later and we started to date. And we got\nengaged six months later and six months later we got married which was June 4\"\n1949 and our first daughter was born November 15 1950. So, I worked and I\u2019m\nstill working.",
        "Q: And the family grows.",

        "Q: When did you realize that you lost your parents?",
        "A: In the working camp. By then, we knew already more what\u2019s going on.",
        "Q: In the working camp of Czechoslovakia?",
        "A: And then we had, we were only 250 girls and after a while they brought another\n250 girls from another camp plus they brought a doctor to camp and they said\nwhat\u2019s going on. And they told us all the things what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s\ngoing on. So then we began to realize but I still didn\u2019t believe until I got home\nafter the war and nobody came home.",
        "Q: When you went back to Ruscova?",
        "A: When I went back to Ruscova. I was sure the family was going to come home.\nAnd I understand my father lived until Purim. That\u2019s when he died.",
        "Q: In Auschwitz?",
        "A: No, in a labor camp.",

        "Q: So when you arrived in Auschwitz, you were separated from your family and your\nfather was also separated.",
        "A: After they went together and after they separated the men from the women, the\nchildren went with the mothers and that was it.",
        "Q: So your father was put into slave labor in Auschwitz and then transferred to a\nlabor camp and then probably to Buchenwald until Purim. the following year.",
        "A: Which was another month, till May 9\", when the Russians came in and we got\nliberated. If he could only have survived.",
        "Q: He died about a month before?",
        "A: About a month before, \u2018cause that\u2019s what a man who was with him told me, that\ntill then he was alive.",
        "Q: In Buchenwald. In fact, the man I interviewed this morning was in Buchenwald.",
        "A: The men, they went through horrors, the men. They were worse to the men then\nto the women, those Nazis. And they were worse to the Polish, then the\nHungarians. They were pretty bad to everybody, they were pretty bad. Just no\nreason for it. I still can\u2019t understand it. How it happened, how the world allowed\nit. It makes no sense to me until today\u2019s date.",
        "Q: So although you were in a daze in Auschwitz, even when you came out of the\ndaze, it still doesn\u2019t make sense to you?",
        "A: And it still doesn\u2019t. Does it make sense to you?",
        "A: Not really.",
        "A: No, it doesn\u2019t. I can\u2019t understand it. It wasn\u2019t one person who did it, Hitler.",
        "Q: Couldn\u2019t have done it by himself.",
        "A: He had to have, there was a lot of help, or Mengele. It\u2019s unbelievable. It\u2019s such a\n-- if I really think about it, I could just kill myself, because it\u2019s unbelievable, such\na horrors.",
        "Q: For you, though, you didn\u2019t know anything about Hitler. It began with the\nHungarians. Without the Hungarians, it wouldn\u2019t have happened the way it did.",
        "A: No, because I have my uncle, Mendel Hyam, he was in Romania and he survived\nwith his families, three boys and his wife. My cousin Hycha was in Romania.\nShe survived with her three boys and her husband. My cousin Shay was in\nRomania and she survived also with her four children and her husband. They had\nit very bad. They went through such hells. But they survived with their families.\nThe Romanians didn\u2019t give out their families. They imprisoned them themselves.\nThey made camps for them themselves but they didn\u2019t give them out to the\nGermans. The Hungarians gave them out immediately.",
        "Q: In your particular town, it was a particular family, this aristocratic family which\nyou described earlier.",
        "A: Well, they were Hungarians and they could have saved us. If they had any kind\nof heart, they could have saved at least some of us. They were in business with a\nlot of the Jewish people and they let those people also go.",
        "Q: Now you said you played with their children, right up to the end.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You never suspected that they hated you so much?",
        "A: No. They were friends with everybody. We had to cater to them a little more\nwhen the Hungarians came in and everybody was afraid of them and they tried to\nplease them and all of that but we never believed they could be like that. One\ngood satisfaction, at least they are not living in that mansion and that mansion 1s\ncompletely destroyed. When I went back a few years ago, it wasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: But it was there when you returned in the fall of 1945?",
        "A: When I returned, it was there. When I went back in \u201984, I had to go back once\nmore and see; I went to the cemetery, I went to the synagogue. We had two\nsynagogues So one synagogue is destroyed already and one is falling apart. By\nnow, it is probably destroyed too. There was three Jews left and I understand one\nof them moved to Israel since then so there\u2019s only two Jews left in all of Ruscova.\nThe cemetery is beautiful -- it\u2019s still there and they have, I guess, they hire -- the\nJoint has a caretaker taking care of it, which is very nice. I guess they must be\ndoing it all over Europe to take care of the cemeteries that they shouldn\u2019t get\ndestroyed.",
        "Q: You mentioned that your sister in Budapest married. Did she also come to\nAmerica?",
        "A: She stayed -- my sister remained in Budapest until 1965. In 1965, I took her out\nhere and then her husband died, and then her two daughters came here. First one\ndaughter she took out and then another daughter. She has two grandchildren.\nAnd they are all here now, thank God.",
        "Q: And your brother also came to America?",
        "A: My brother came to America in 1949 and at that time, they didn\u2019t let him settle\nhere any more, so they sent him to California. So he had three children and he\npassed away in 1963 and my sister-in-law just passed away in 1989. And the\nthree children are there -- he has three very beautiful children and three\ngrandchildren but he is not here to enjoy them.",
        "Q: Do you have any additional observations or thoughts about your experiences and\nyour family\u2019s?",
        "A: My family that is dead? All I can tell you is -- but I told you I was the baby sitter\nmost of the time -- my two little brothers and little sister. But I remember from\nthem. Whenever I used to sit down they used to hang on to me and kiss me and\nhug me and that is what I remember most about them. How they used to kiss and\nhug me. They really loved me. (survivor starts to cry)",
        "Q: And you weren\u2019t even able to say goodbye to them?",
        "A: No. One day in the concentration camp, someone told me that they saw my older\nbrother Burachal??, he was twelve years old. He\u2019s alive (they said). I went\nlooking in that camp every day to see him. And you know what? The whole\ntime, I saved up four portions of bread to give him and I never saw him. So I\ndon\u2019t know if they said the truth or not. And another thing I have to say -- when\nwe went to the working camp, I had this very good friend of mine from my home\ntown -- Rochela. And they chose us naked to go to the working camp. So she\nwas very skinny and she was right behind me and I went forward -- they let --\nthey pointed me to go forward, I went forward and I am there and I am looking\nfor my friend Rochela and she is not there. I give a look to the other side and she\nis over there -- purple and blue and that is the last that I saw of her. You see, you\nhad to be perfect to survive. You couldn\u2019t have a pimple on your body and here\nthey gave you for six months not to get your period and we broke out in all kinds\nof boils and as a matter of fact, ,I did have a boil on my belly but the SS men\ndidn\u2019t see me, he must have been distracted so he didn\u2019t see the boil, he just\npointed me to go ahead. But we all had something from that -- it wasn\u2019t normal\nand that is the last I saw Rochela. So they chose you naked -- you couldn\u2019t be too\nskinny, you couldn\u2019t be too fat. You couldn\u2019t have a boil, you couldn\u2019t ...... can\nyou imagine?",
        "Q: You couldn\u2019t be sick?",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t be sick. Can you imagine how many people survived really? How\nfew survived?",
        "Q: Very few.",
        "A: I mean just to think of it. If you had a child you went right away. If you were\nold, you went right away. So there was only a certain few that were old enough --\nif you were young. I mean the youngest people that could live is two years\nyounger than Iam. There is three girls from my hometown and then there\u2019s me.\nBecause I was sixteen. So you had to be a certain age and a certain weight and a\ncertain shape -- too fat and they wouldn\u2019t -- you went right away if you were too\nfat. And then finally when you made it and after six months in Auschwitz you\nhad to be -- you couldn\u2019t be too skinny, you couldn\u2019t have any pimples on you --\nyou know? It\u2019s unbelievable.",
        "Q: But you survived.",
        "A: I was husky.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t come down with any diseases? You didn\u2019t mention typhus, for\nexample.",
        "A: No, no. I never was sick a day. I was husky and I had a very, very nourishing\nupbringing. Everything was very natural and very healthy and that is how we\nshould eat today. All that good, healthy natural food.",
        "Q: I will say yes to that.",
        "A: Yes. So I had good stock -- as my son-in-law says \u201cpeasant stock.\u201d",
        "Q: Peasant stock -- good genes -- good upbringing.",
        "A: So all those little things that I guess God was with me. I put myself 1n God\u2019s\nhands. As I told you a while ago -- I made up my mind, I am not going to run to\nand I am not going to run away. Where God will put me, that is where I am going\nto go. And that is what I did. I didn\u2019t run to and I didn\u2019t run from. Like they\nused to say, they\u2019re picking from this block or that block and they ran to that\nblock to be picked or ran away from our block so that they shouldn\u2019t be picked. I\nlet God\u2019s hands and then I never believed ... Oh -- this you must hear too. In the\nlabor camp, I have -- I happened to have a mechanical mind. So they put me to\nwork -- to do a man\u2019s machine -- work a man\u2019s machine. So because I understand\nmachinery.",
        "Q: This is when you were working on these radio controls?",
        "A: Right, yes. So, some of the girls -- now here, I worked between all the men -- and\nsome of the girls used to flirt with the men --they used to meet them in the\nhallway and flirt with them and I wouldn\u2019t. I said like this -- if I\u2019m going to burn\n-- there will be less of me to burn. If they give you a slice of bread, an apple -- I\ndon\u2019t need that. If I\u2019m going to burn, there will be less of me to burn. If I am\ngoing to survive then I have a conscience I want to live with my conscience -- that\nis not to sell my soul for a piece of bread or for a piece of apple. And I didn\u2019t get\nanything from them, but I did the delivery -- the food, the mail back and forth.\nThat is another thing -- I am very proud of myself that I was young and yet I had\nmy principles.",
        "Q: You had your honor and your dignity.",
        "A: My honor and my dignity. First I didn\u2019t believe that they\u2019re going to let me\nsurvive. Would you believe they\u2019re going to let you survive and tell the world\nwhat happened? I never believed. The only thing I hoped was for the bombs to\ncome. So then I said, if they put me in the crematorium, I will burn quicker if\nthere is less fat on me. So that is my morals.",
        "Q: So there was flirting between males and ...",
        "A: Males and females. Oh, we had a French labor force. That is where the flirting\nwent on -- they were free.",
        "Q: These were French P.O.W.\u2019s?",
        "A: I forget what they are called.",
        "Q: They were men though?",
        "A: They were men. They were forced laborers but they lived free, they didn\u2019t live in\ncamps.",
        "Q: But they worked in the same camp as you?",
        "A: They worked in the same -- they worked in the same factories. So, they met in\nthe hallways and they flirted with each other. I was too young for that anyway.\nFor flirting, or for anything like that. But I didn\u2019t get anything from them but I\ndid deliver the messages. That was something huh?",
        "Q: Do you remember anything else?",
        "A: There were probably a lot of incidents -- there is probably a whole year of\nincidents that you can\u2019t just -- you know -- think of them.",
        "Q: You remembered quite a bit today.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: On that note, I thank you.",
        "A: I thank you Tony. You are a very nice man.",

Okay, like on\nChristmas and Easter we would be afraid to go out, we kind of, even during the\nRomanians we kind of didn\u2019t go out too much because we were afraid of them,\nthe Christians what they would do.

We had our aunt here which was my father\u2019s sister, so probably one of us\nwould have come eventually, one of the children. And once one came, they\nbrought out the rest.",
        "A: Well, there was one thing I always used to think to myself that I\u2019m going to work\nfor whatever I need, but I want to have everything nice. I was always thinking\nthat to myself, that I like nice things and I would work for it. And that\u2019s what ?'m\ndoing, I\u2019m still working to get whatever I like and whatever I want.",

        "A: No.",
        "A: She was from a different town, my mother.",
        "A: Yes she was from a different town. So it had to be a match. There was no\ndivorce, not one couple got divorced.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Stayed home and helped in the house.",
        "A: My mother, yes. I helped in the house, well, in the summertime there was a lot of\nwork to do in the fields, in the spring and in the fall and in the whole summer.\nIt\u2019s a lot of labor.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They all went, yes. The younger ones, right.",
        "A: No, there was no, everything was kind of peaceful. These Hungarian aristocrats,\nthey were the teachers, their daughter-in-law, their daughter, the son-in-law, they\nwere the teachers. So they lived in the town, so everything was, uh, peaceful.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: There were no signs on the streets, the only way you got news was with the drum.",
        "A: Someone would walk down the street, beating the drum, and as soon as a few\npeople got around him he would tell you the news.",
        "A: Well, whatever it was, whatever news it was, that\u2019s how you heard the news.",
        "A: He hit a drum, then you gathered around him, and he would tell you what the\nnews is, or what to do, or whatever.",
        "A: The ghetto wasn\u2019t in our time, 1t wasn\u2019t. All I know is after Pesach they took us\nall together in the synagogue and then they shipped us out to by the\ntrain and then we were there for a month. And then they told us we were going to\na main ghetto, a main ghetto, and that was Auschwitz and then we took like four\ndays and four nights without water, without bathroom facilities, without anything,\neveryone sitting on top of each other, no room, everybody was scrunched\ntogether, there was no room to stand up even, they put in so many of us. Day and\nnight, day and night.",
        "A: Well the Hungarian soldiers.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t give you notice for anything.",
        "A: Right, you do what you were told, they didn\u2019t give you notice.",
        "A: The train is waiting and you go.",
        "A: Just what you carried.",
        "A: And my two younger brothers and little sister. And aunt and uncles and cousins,\ncousins, cousins.",
        "A: The whole town, everybody.",
        "A: They used the train and when we moved in we had an uncle living ins so we\nmoved in with him. And everybody got a corner of a room, a whole big family\ngot a corner of a room, and again you had to sleep on the floor.",
        "A: The railroad.",
        "A: Passenger cars.",
        "A: In it only took a few minutes, only half an hour or so.",
        "A: Four weeks, after Passover and before Shavuos. By Shavuos we were in\nAuschwitz already.",
        "A: The Hungarians and then they put Jews in charge and they handled the Jews.\nThey told the Jews that were in charge what they want and that\u2019s how the\nmessages came through.",
        "A: Not that I remember, I saw the Hungarians, the Hungarian police.",
        "A: The Green Feathers. They are scary.",
        "A: Not at that time, no. But when we left they destroyed, they took everything out of\nour houses, everything.",
        "A: In Ruscova, because I came back after the war and everything was gone, there\nwasn\u2019t a stitch left in our house or anyone else\u2019s house.",
        "A: And my family, my mother, my father and two little brothers and little sister. The\nthree little kids.",
        "A: Nightmares.",
        "A: There wasn\u2019t enough food, there wasn\u2019t enough room, there wasn\u2019t enough\nanything, sanitary conditions were terrible, so many people in one little house.",
        "A: They were good at doing that, making the Jew into imbecile. No work, no\nbathroom facilities so then you\u2019re a filthy pig, of course.",
        "A: In the ghetto, not outside the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes, what do kids know. I was a kid, I made fun of everybody. Kids are kids,\nthey don\u2019t take things seriously.",
        "A: That we wore even before the ghetto.",
        "A: In Ruscova, that we wore before.",
        "A: That I don\u2019t remember exactly. Maybe like six months before the ghetto.",
        "A: Maybe eight months, I\u2019m not so sure. You know, you didn\u2019t pay attention to\nanything because we always figured it\u2019s only during the war and after the war it\nwill all go back to normal.",
        "A: She made a lot of them.",
        "A: For other people. We sold them. We always kept on thinking that it\u2019s only\nduring the war. The war will end and everything will go back to normal again.",
        "A: The police again.",
        "A: They made the announcement that we were going to the other ghetto, the main\nghetto, in Czechoslovakia.",
        "A: No time at all. No time at all. Right away. They didn\u2019t let you know in advance\nanything. If we would have run away maybe. Maybe some of us would have run\naway. Can you imagine. I can\u2019t believe that people were so ignorant to believe\nall those lies.",
        "A: The ghetto and and not run away. No family hid. Not one family from\nour town hid.",
        "A: In some other towns they hid. Some families survived. All you had to do was\nhold out for three months, six months at the most. Like I\u2019m telling you my\nbrother got liberated six months later after he left. All you had to do was hid out\nfor a few weeks, then the Hungarians left or something.",
        "A: I mean, there were the politicians.",
        "A: The Jewish council. They should have known. They were saying, \u201cFollow\ninstructions\u201d. Now I guarantee those Hungarian aristocrats knew what was going\non. But they didn\u2019t tell anybody because they were friends with all the Hungarian\nofficers and I\u2019m sure the officers knew what was going on.",
        "A: Yes. They stacked us in again, locked the doors and that was it. And unlocked\nthem and Auschwitz.",
        "A: No, a cattle train.",
        "A: When we got on the train. But that was cattle train. It was nightmare. Plain,\nplain nightmare. Then when we arrived and we finally thought we were arriving\nsomeplace, like I was going to help my mother with the little sister to take her out\nof the train, and one of the workers, the Jewish workers, pushed me away. I\nunderstand they did it to a lot of people. They saved a lot of young girls. Because\nif you had a child in your hands, you went to the crematorium immediately; if you\nwere a certain age an a certain time and a certain body, they sent you to work so I\nguess those Jewish workers unloading the people from those trains, they knew\nwhat\u2019s what so as I was going to help with the child, he pushed me away and he\nsays I should go away. I didn\u2019t know, so I listened and that\u2019s the last I saw of the\nfamily.",
        "A: My whole family and my parents, that\u2019s the last I saw of them.",
        "A: Yes. Everything is rush, rush, rush. They take you away and I thought I\u2019d see\nthem. They told you you\u2019d meet the parents at night. So then they took us to a\ndifferent place, they showered us and they cut off our hair and took away our\nclothes and gave us the camp clothes. The striped uniforms, whatever. No hair.\nNobody recognized any body Everybody thought, \u201cI don\u2019t look like that, I don\u2019t\nlook like that\u2019. You didn\u2019t have a mirror, you didn\u2019t see yourself. Until one day,\nI saw myself in a window. The kitchen had windows. Our barracks didn\u2019t have\nwindows.",
        "A: We were all together.",
        "A: Everybody, we knew everybody.",
        "A: Four days and four nights.",
        "A: They cried and cried and cried and cried and cried and cried ----- the kids cried,\nthe people cried, we all cried. We didn\u2019t have a bathroom facilities, we didn\u2019t\nhave water. The little children were thirsty, we gave them urine to drink.",
        "A: Just what you took with you. We didn\u2019t know what to take or how long it would\ntake or anything like that. We didn\u2019t take water, we didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: It rained one day so we stuck a cup through the wire window, we stuck out a cup\nto catch a little rain. It was a horrible, horrible experience.",
        "A: Daylight. He did the picking. As I say, I didn\u2019t have a child so I went that way. I\ndidn\u2019t know anything.",
        "A: Yes, my cousins, my friends. We stayed together the whole time.",
        "A: Well, we got into the saylager in Auschwitz and we chopped down stones, broke\nup stones and carried them to a certain spot. Then we had to, every morning the\nsaylafeller, I don\u2019t if you heard about that, the saylafeller, we fainted away, me\ntoo, we all fainted away, cause we stood there for hours in the same spot. And\nthat went on for six months, from May to October",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And you know what they did? On Yom Kippur, they came to see if we were\neating. They didn\u2019t want us to fast. So some girls didn\u2019t fast. I fasted. Some girls\ndidn\u2019t fast so they were eating and they were satisfied to see some girls eat.",
        "A: Well, you got a slice of bread, that sawdust bread that\u2019s what we called it. Soup\nand a piece of liverwurst for dinner and that was it.",
        "A: Oh yes. What was it, 600 calories. How long could you survive on 600 calories,\nlike six months or so and then you should die.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how long I was there.",
        "A: Definitely, definitely. And no clothes and no nothing. So, all that.",
        "A: Let\u2019s say we saw the smoke from the crematorium. Next door to us there was a\ngypsy camp also. And one morning we woke up and they weren\u2019t there. So they\ntook care of them very quickly. We didn\u2019t see any of the crematorium, we only\nsaw smoke.",
        "A: We knew, and we knew and as I say I couldn\u2019t believe it. I couldn\u2019t absorb what\nwas going on. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I couldn\u2019t understand it. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\nI just didn\u2019t believe that this could be going on. I always said we going to meet\nmy family when this war is over. They were in a separate working camp and I\u2019Il\nmeet the family. Until I went into the working camp, the labor camp, and then I\nbegan to realize I think, they gave us that stuff in Auschwitz that we shouldn\u2019t get\nour period.. I think that made me very blurred because I remember not being very\nclearly thinking. Could be that stuff made me not alert at all.",
        "A: I remember always thinking not being able to think too clearly. So it possibly was\nthat stuff.\nA I was very fortunate. I didn\u2019t see anything like that. I saw once a lady went on\nthe barbed wire. She didn\u2019t want to live any more so she threw herself on the\nelectric wire and she died. The only thing I knew, we had a hospital in Saylag,\nthe only thing I knew nobody should go to the hospital.",
        "A: Because then if they would go to the hospital, we would never see them again. So\nI happened to have been, as you say I ate very good and I was a healthy child and\nI was able to .... And in our area we weren\u2019t spoiled people. We were used to\nworking hard. And we weren\u2019t used to sleeping on a soft bed because we had the\nwooded boards and a straw mattress and rough sheets. We didn\u2019t have the fine\nlinens like the city people had. And things like that. So we were able to\nwithstand all that hardships better than city people. That\u2019s why a lot of us\nsurvived.",
        "A: From my town. I would say, and I\u2019m sure from a lot of other little towns. But if\nyou were from any kind of softer upbringing you couldn\u2019t survive. Today, I\ncouldn\u2019t survive that. My children could never survive because you would just go\non that wire and kill yourself because it wouldn\u2019t pay to live. You have to give up\nall that. But we were very roughened up.",
        "A: As I was saying, city people could never survive. And they didn\u2019t. They fell like\nflies. They couldn\u2019t handle that bad situation.",
        "A: Well, the thing was this. We were together. When they say misery wants\ncompany, that\u2019s the truth. We were all in the same situation. Nobody was any\ndifferent. We were all kind of young and there wasn\u2019t mature person who was\nmarried and had children because once you had children, you went straight with\nyour children. And we kind of stuck together the whole time. So that you didn\u2019t\nfeel alone. You had your family, people that you grew up with, with you. Your\nfamily, your friends, everybody. And then we slept like herrings, you know like a\ncan of herrings, this way and that way, that\u2019s how we slept, seven this way and\nseven that way and one blanket. And you couldn\u2019t turn around. And that\u2019s how\nyou had to sleep, the way you lay down, that\u2018s how you had to sleep on the same\nside. And the one that was at the end, was never covered. That was Auschwitz.",
        "A: I saw some of that, yes, not amongst us. Not amongst our friends. I saw some\npeople were able to go into the kitchen, they went into the kitchen and they did\nget something extra and like you say, they would kill you for it.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: When we were transferred from Auschwitz. I think it was thanks to her; she was\na nice intelligent woman. It must have been hard that she kept us in line,\nwhatever.",
        "A: Czechoslovakian.",
        "A: You see, all the people in charge were Polish or Czechoslovakian because they\nwere there years before us. Like they said, they built the camp for us. They had it\nvery, very rough. We got there, they said this is a vacation for you. Because we\nhad to build it all. They went through terrible hell, they went through.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t even get the number because we were not even considered people any\nmore. Those that got a number were considered at least a worker. We were not\neven considered that. Because we were not given a number. We just had a\nnumber sewn on a piece of paper on our uniform. Most of the Hungarian Jews\ndon\u2019t have numbers. Only those that went in 1942. Like I was telling you they\ntook them whose parents weren\u2019t married and then maybe those that went at the\nbeginning but otherwise once we came, it was already they didn\u2019t want us any\nmore",
        "A: Day after day, day and night.",
        "A: Well, they came, in Auschwitz you mean to go to work, they came, I have to\nmention one more thing before I get to that. One day they came and took blood\nfrom everybody for the soldiers. I held out, I didn\u2019t want to give blood. And the\npeople that they caught to give blood, they said they were never the same again\nbecause they didn\u2019t have food to make up for the loss of blood.",
        "A: I managed to avoid. I had one motto -- I run to nothing and I don\u2019t hide from\nnothing. Whatever God will give me, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll take. I had that motto.\nThat\u2019s one thing I ran way from, giving blood.",
        "A: I went to another barrack when they took our barrack. They only took the people\nin the barracks.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if others did it but I did it and I\u2019m very glad I did it.",
        "A: You needed every drop of blood but those poor people, the kids said they were\nnever the same again since that blood, they were so weak.",
        "A: Much later, much later. Shortly before they took us away to the working camp.\nSo anyway, the kapo said they were going to come and select us, they needed 250\ngirls for the working camp and they took you to a different area, different camp, a\ndifferent area and again they showered us, oh God, again, naked and disinfect\nyou. A man had to disinfect you, prisoners, and we were shy, so shy and so\nashamed for the man to disinfect you, with the hose, you know.",
        "A: When we got to Auschwitz and when we went to the working camp, again this\nwas.",
        "A: That was in October, October of \u201944. Then they showered us and disinfect us and\ngave us different clothes and they had us sitting in a room on concrete stairs. So\nthat\u2019s where we spent the night, on these concrete stairs. And they came and took\ntwo girls out and they sent two nurses along, so we knew it was going to be a\ngood camp. And then they sent us to the camp which was in Weisswasser and\nthey had the barracks when we got there, I don\u2019t know how long it took to get\nthere.",
        "A: By train. From Auschwitz.",
        "A: Czechoslovakia, yes. Sudatin.",
        "A: Yes. There is Rodwasser also, you know, there is red water after the camp, I saw\nit. It\u2019s red water too. So when we got liberated and we took a walk to the next\ntown, there was Rodwasser and there was red water. Anyway.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that time. It could have been a truck.",
        "A: No before, everything was in Auschwitz. In Weisswasser, we were treated like\npeople. You got your own bed, your own sheet, your own blanket.",
        "A: No cattle car. Everything, they couldn\u2019t, the Wehrmacht, that\u2019s the ,\nand the Wehrmacht ran the camp, ran the factory. They ran the camp. Actually,\nthe Nazis ran the camp. But one day one of the SS women beat up a girl for some\nreason and the next day she wasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: Wasn\u2019t there. And there we had more food, another clothing, another change of\nclothing, they gave us.",
        "A: In the winter, we got warmer clothing for the winter, yes and a different pair of\nshoes already. There they treated us more like human beings. It was an\nammunition factory. You made radios for the planes and the ships, we made.\nAnd there we were until May 9\"\". It got slow after a while and we got scared they\nwere going to send us someplace else but we were very, very fortunate they didn\u2019t\nsend us away. And the Russians came in and the head of the camp even held us a\nspeech and said we should all leave the camp and go to the next town is the\nCzechs and they\u2019 ll take us in. Because the Russian soldiers will arrive and here\nthere are so many women, they\u2019Il come and rape us and that\u2019s what I did, most of\nus went away and the ones that remained, they did get raped by the Russian\nsoldiers. I did stay with a Czech family for three weeks and then I made my way\nhome which took four weeks. On top of railroads. It didn\u2019t cost you any money\nbecause there was chaos. How I ever got back, I'll never understand.",
        "A: I'd never been away from home, I\u2019d never traveled on trains and how to get back\nfrom there to Ruscova, I don\u2019t know how I ever made it. But I got back, it took\nlike four weeks. And in between I stopped off to see my sister in Budapest. She\nremained there because she had her people, she already was getting married.",
        "A: Yes, and I came home and I found my brother there.",
        "A: Liberated by the Russians. And a lot of other people came home and we were\nthere until October. And in October already, a lot of people started to leave\nRuscova to go back to Germany either to go to Israel or to America. So, again, it\ntook four weeks but at time already we had a lot of help. There were a lot of\norganizations already working and helping us. They had already set up places in\nBudapest where we should stay and then they smuggled us across the border to\nAustria. We went to Austria. From Austria to Germany. But there already you\nhad lots of organizations helping you. And then I wound up in a DP camp and\nin Germany in the American zone. That\u2019s because we had an aunt\nhere and we knew ---five of us came, my cousin Dave, my cousin Nathan, my\ncousin Ceil and my cousin Ruchel and me and we all made it to Germany on the\nAmerican zone. And we were there \u2018till --- I came in February 18 1947.",
        "A: I was ina DP camp. They treated us very good in the DP camp. We had\neverything. They threw out the Germans of apartments and they gave us their\nhouses so we had a house and piano and they had kitchens for us. Or either you\ncould go and eat in the soup kitchen or you could cook yourselves. They gave us\npackages of food from the joint and then the joint took us out here. And I came\nhere on a Tuesday and Monday I went to work as a finisher. I had no trade.",
        "A: Yeh. So I went to work as a finisher. And I worked until I became pregnant and I\ngot married two years later.",
        "A: Yes. I got married and then I became pregnant. I worked until I became\npregnant.",
        "A: In those days you didn\u2019t do those things. No, you first got married. I met my\nhusband. His mother is from my home town, from Ruscova. So, I met him. And\nwhen I met him, we couldn\u2019t even talk two words because he doesn\u2019t speak\nYiddish and I didn\u2019t speak English. I was here six weeks. So then we didn\u2019t see\neach other for a year and we met a year later and we started to date. And we got\nengaged six months later and six months later we got married which was June 4\"\n1949 and our first daughter was born November 15 1950. So, I worked and I\u2019m\nstill working.",
        "A: God bless them. Should only keep growing. So now I have two wonderful\ndaughters and a wonderful husband. He\u2019s a very nice man. And five\ngrandchildren.",
        "A: In the working camp. By then, we knew already more what\u2019s going on.",
        "A: And then we had, we were only 250 girls and after a while they brought another\n250 girls from another camp plus they brought a doctor to camp and they said\nwhat\u2019s going on. And they told us all the things what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s\ngoing on. So then we began to realize but I still didn\u2019t believe until I got home\nafter the war and nobody came home.",
        "A: When I went back to Ruscova. I was sure the family was going to come home.\nAnd I understand my father lived until Purim. That\u2019s when he died.",
        "A: No, in a labor camp.",
        "A: He was put in a labor camp, my fathe3r\u2019cause I know people that was with him.\nAnd then he got killed in the crematorium one of the crematoriums, possibly\nBuchenwald.",
        "A: After they went together and after they separated the men from the women, the\nchildren went with the mothers and that was it.",
        "A: Which was another month, till May 9\", when the Russians came in and we got\nliberated. If he could only have survived.",
        "A: About a month before, \u2018cause that\u2019s what a man who was with him told me, that\ntill then he was alive.",
        "A: The men, they went through horrors, the men. They were worse to the men then\nto the women, those Nazis. And they were worse to the Polish, then the\nHungarians. They were pretty bad to everybody, they were pretty bad. Just no\nreason for it. I still can\u2019t understand it. How it happened, how the world allowed\nit. It makes no sense to me until today\u2019s date.",
        "A: And it still doesn\u2019t. Does it make sense to you?",
        "A: Not really.",
        "A: No, it doesn\u2019t. I can\u2019t understand it. It wasn\u2019t one person who did it, Hitler.",
        "A: He had to have, there was a lot of help, or Mengele. It\u2019s unbelievable. It\u2019s such a\n-- if I really think about it, I could just kill myself, because it\u2019s unbelievable, such\na horrors.",
        "A: No, because I have my uncle, Mendel Hyam, he was in Romania and he survived\nwith his families, three boys and his wife. My cousin Hycha was in Romania.\nShe survived with her three boys and her husband. My cousin Shay was in\nRomania and she survived also with her four children and her husband. They had\nit very bad. They went through such hells. But they survived with their families.\nThe Romanians didn\u2019t give out their families. They imprisoned them themselves.\nThey made camps for them themselves but they didn\u2019t give them out to the\nGermans. The Hungarians gave them out immediately.",
        "A: Well, they were Hungarians and they could have saved us. If they had any kind\nof heart, they could have saved at least some of us. They were in business with a\nlot of the Jewish people and they let those people also go.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. They were friends with everybody. We had to cater to them a little more\nwhen the Hungarians came in and everybody was afraid of them and they tried to\nplease them and all of that but we never believed they could be like that. One\ngood satisfaction, at least they are not living in that mansion and that mansion 1s\ncompletely destroyed. When I went back a few years ago, it wasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: When I returned, it was there. When I went back in \u201984, I had to go back once\nmore and see; I went to the cemetery, I went to the synagogue. We had two\nsynagogues So one synagogue is destroyed already and one is falling apart. By\nnow, it is probably destroyed too. There was three Jews left and I understand one\nof them moved to Israel since then so there\u2019s only two Jews left in all of Ruscova.\nThe cemetery is beautiful -- it\u2019s still there and they have, I guess, they hire -- the\nJoint has a caretaker taking care of it, which is very nice. I guess they must be\ndoing it all over Europe to take care of the cemeteries that they shouldn\u2019t get\ndestroyed.",
        "A: She stayed -- my sister remained in Budapest until 1965. In 1965, I took her out\nhere and then her husband died, and then her two daughters came here. First one\ndaughter she took out and then another daughter. She has two grandchildren.\nAnd they are all here now, thank God.",
        "A: My brother came to America in 1949 and at that time, they didn\u2019t let him settle\nhere any more, so they sent him to California. So he had three children and he\npassed away in 1963 and my sister-in-law just passed away in 1989. And the\nthree children are there -- he has three very beautiful children and three\ngrandchildren but he is not here to enjoy them.",
        "A: My family that is dead? All I can tell you is -- but I told you I was the baby sitter\nmost of the time -- my two little brothers and little sister. But I remember from\nthem. Whenever I used to sit down they used to hang on to me and kiss me and\nhug me and that is what I remember most about them. How they used to kiss and\nhug me. They really loved me. (survivor starts to cry)",
        "A: No. One day in the concentration camp, someone told me that they saw my older\nbrother Burachal??, he was twelve years old. He\u2019s alive (they said). I went\nlooking in that camp every day to see him. And you know what? The whole\ntime, I saved up four portions of bread to give him and I never saw him. So I\ndon\u2019t know if they said the truth or not. And another thing I have to say -- when\nwe went to the working camp, I had this very good friend of mine from my home\ntown -- Rochela. And they chose us naked to go to the working camp. So she\nwas very skinny and she was right behind me and I went forward -- they let --\nthey pointed me to go forward, I went forward and I am there and I am looking\nfor my friend Rochela and she is not there. I give a look to the other side and she\nis over there -- purple and blue and that is the last that I saw of her. You see, you\nhad to be perfect to survive. You couldn\u2019t have a pimple on your body and here\nthey gave you for six months not to get your period and we broke out in all kinds\nof boils and as a matter of fact, ,I did have a boil on my belly but the SS men\ndidn\u2019t see me, he must have been distracted so he didn\u2019t see the boil, he just\npointed me to go ahead. But we all had something from that -- it wasn\u2019t normal\nand that is the last I saw Rochela. So they chose you naked -- you couldn\u2019t be too\nskinny, you couldn\u2019t be too fat. You couldn\u2019t have a boil, you couldn\u2019t ...... can\nyou imagine?",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t be sick. Can you imagine how many people survived really? How\nfew survived?",
        "A: I mean just to think of it. If you had a child you went right away. If you were\nold, you went right away. So there was only a certain few that were old enough --\nif you were young. I mean the youngest people that could live is two years\nyounger than Iam. There is three girls from my hometown and then there\u2019s me.\nBecause I was sixteen. So you had to be a certain age and a certain weight and a\ncertain shape -- too fat and they wouldn\u2019t -- you went right away if you were too\nfat. And then finally when you made it and after six months in Auschwitz you\nhad to be -- you couldn\u2019t be too skinny, you couldn\u2019t have any pimples on you --\nyou know? It\u2019s unbelievable.",
        "A: I was husky.",
        "A: No, no. I never was sick a day. I was husky and I had a very, very nourishing\nupbringing. Everything was very natural and very healthy and that is how we\nshould eat today. All that good, healthy natural food.",
        "A: Yes. So I had good stock -- as my son-in-law says \u201cpeasant stock.\u201d",
        "A: So all those little things that I guess God was with me. I put myself 1n God\u2019s\nhands. As I told you a while ago -- I made up my mind, I am not going to run to\nand I am not going to run away. Where God will put me, that is where I am going\nto go. And that is what I did. I didn\u2019t run to and I didn\u2019t run from. Like they\nused to say, they\u2019re picking from this block or that block and they ran to that\nblock to be picked or ran away from our block so that they shouldn\u2019t be picked. I\nlet God\u2019s hands and then I never believed ... Oh -- this you must hear too. In the\nlabor camp, I have -- I happened to have a mechanical mind. So they put me to\nwork -- to do a man\u2019s machine -- work a man\u2019s machine. So because I understand\nmachinery.",
        "A: Right, yes. So, some of the girls -- now here, I worked between all the men -- and\nsome of the girls used to flirt with the men --they used to meet them in the\nhallway and flirt with them and I wouldn\u2019t. I said like this -- if I\u2019m going to burn\n-- there will be less of me to burn. If they give you a slice of bread, an apple -- I\ndon\u2019t need that. If I\u2019m going to burn, there will be less of me to burn. If I am\ngoing to survive then I have a conscience I want to live with my conscience -- that\nis not to sell my soul for a piece of bread or for a piece of apple. And I didn\u2019t get\nanything from them, but I did the delivery -- the food, the mail back and forth.\nThat is another thing -- I am very proud of myself that I was young and yet I had\nmy principles.",
        "A: My honor and my dignity. First I didn\u2019t believe that they\u2019re going to let me\nsurvive. Would you believe they\u2019re going to let you survive and tell the world\nwhat happened? I never believed. The only thing I hoped was for the bombs to\ncome. So then I said, if they put me in the crematorium, I will burn quicker if\nthere is less fat on me. So that is my morals.",
        "A: Males and females. Oh, we had a French labor force. That is where the flirting\nwent on -- they were free.",
        "A: I forget what they are called.",
        "A: They were men. They were forced laborers but they lived free, they didn\u2019t live in\ncamps.",
        "A: They worked in the same -- they worked in the same factories. So, they met in\nthe hallways and they flirted with each other. I was too young for that anyway.\nFor flirting, or for anything like that. But I didn\u2019t get anything from them but I\ndid deliver the messages. That was something huh?",
        "A: There were probably a lot of incidents -- there is probably a whole year of\nincidents that you can\u2019t just -- you know -- think of them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I thank you Tony. You are a very nice man.",
        "A: Your mother did a good job. Thank her for me.",
        "A: Bye.\n"
