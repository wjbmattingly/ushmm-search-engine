I was by\nthat time a prisoner in various concentration camps for over\nthree years, and it was the 10th camp. The name of the camp\nwas Woeblin It was aa camp that apparently the Germans\ndidn't finish when we arrived there. The buildings were not\nfinished, there were no floors in the few barracks, no\nwindows. We slept on the sand and the place was very\ndisorganized. It was, it was base-, but it was springtime,\nit was a time of double pain because inside, discipline and\norganization and supply of food have were deteriorating, the\nmadness and the evil was increasing, while nature placed\nleaves on the trees outside the wires and birds were\nSinging and flowers were appearing more in greater number as\nif to mark the many starving and dying prisoners inside the\ncamp.\nGEORGE SALTON:There was no work there, thee was really very\nlittle organization, the German SS men still, however,\nmaintained certain processes, calling us out every morning\nfor for a assembly to count us. aIt was not meaningful",
        "anymore because so many people died every night that the\ncount didn't mean anything. Nevertheless, we who were still\nalive and able got up every morning and appeared for the\nassembly and for count. We did it because we were afraid.\nI suppose in those days, only the dead were not afraid. And\nso it happened one day--and I believe it was the beginning\nof May--I know now that it was the first of may, but I\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/14/95 Int GEORGE SALTON\nPage 2\nbelieved then it was the beginning of May--at one of those\nassemblies it was announced that the prisoners in this camp,\ncamp Woeblin in which they must have been about 4 or 5\nthousand prisoners that were still alive were to be placed\non a train to be evacuated again. Mind you, that during\nthat those late days of the war as the fronts were moving\nand advancing we were being evacuated from camp to camp.\nMay 1...\nGEORGE SALTON:And so it happened that about noon or 10\no'clock that day we were placed on in boxcars some hundred\nor 80 or 130 people to a boxcar. It was obviously very\ncrowded. The train was--well, let me tell you, the camp, as",
        "all camps, was surrounded by double fence and the\nrailroadline with the waiting boxcars were in an area\nbetween two fences--it's significant as the story evolves.\nWe on that train the whole night. Hungry and miserable,\nthere was some random shootings from from the guards who\nSurrounded us. And then by next morning, again, as I\nremember it very well, about 10 the doors were opened and\nthe prisoners were saying to other prisoners that\u2019 the\nlocomotive didn't show up and therefore therefore there was\nsome doubt about us being transported to some new\ndestination. Later that morning, we were asked to, we were\nordered to leave the boxcars, line up in the areas in front\nof the boxcars right in front of the fence and the gate that\nled to the inner camps, where the camp was, with\ninstructions that, with orders, I need to remember that,\nwith orders barked, orders that all the Jews should. step\nforward. I would estimate at that time that among the 4 to\n6 thousand prisoners there must have been a few hundred\nJews, maybe 4 hundred Jews. Most of us being sufficiently\nexperienced and knowing what to expect, most of us Jews, I\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/14/95 Int GEORGE SALTON\nPage 3",
        "should say, tried to ignore that order. Some people who\nreally didn't care stepped forward, others were being\nSingled out in this commotion by prisoners who were not\nJewish, and in the midst of that confusion and shouting and\nand and fear accompanied by by shouts and beatings, eh,\nthere was a, we heard the cannon fire, eh, eh, artillery\ncannon fire in in some place close by and all of us\u20197~ looked\nin the direction of the sound from which the sound came down\nthe corridor the railroad track cut through the forest, and\nin the the distance we should, we could see a tank. A green\ntank, I quite frankly didn't know and didn't care at that\ntime whether it was a German or a Russian or American tank.\nWe didn't know exactly where we were in which part of\nGermany and we didn't know at all how the war was coming,\neven though we knew that there were changes because of the\nmovement of the prisoners from camp to camp. And there was\nthis tank and was surrounded by smoke, which I suppose was\nthe smoke emitted by the canon and it kind of stood there on\nthe horizon, almost--I remember seeing it as some kind of\nprehistoric animal ready to snarl or attack. I was, most of\nus who see it were kind of stunned by that sight and _ the\nGermans, of course, reacted to it very quickly. They opened\nthe inner gate, or the gate to the inner camp and made all\nof us move, walk into the camp. Gave up the idea of\nSingling out Jews. They did hold back the the German\ntrustees, so-called kapos, who were basically the admini,\nadministrators of the day to day working of the camp and we\njust went in and there was nothing more. There was no--the",
        "tank didn't appear and there was no additional canon fire.\nIt would have been about 10 or 11 when this happened in the\nmorning. The German guards continued to occupy the towers\nthat surrounded the electric wire around the _ fence. For\nreasons that were, they continued random shooting into\u2019 the\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/14/95 Int GEORGE SALTON\nPage 4\ncamp. Prisoners were being shot and those of us who were\ninside searched out--and I in particular, searched out a\nposition between the barracks where I was not in the line of\nfire. And some food was available for stealing because the\nkapos who in the past protected the supply of potatoes or\ncabbage was there, were no longer inside the camp, so there\nwe were not knowing what to what is going to happen, and\nclearly I did not anticipate liberation. The whole, I must\nconfess that the whole notion of being free, of living a\nlife that was my own was outside of my expectation. I had\nbeen in camps, I waS a prisoner since I was 14, I had been\nunder German eh control since I was 11. I just didn't know\nwhat it meant to be able to decide when to get up or what to\ndo or or or the whole notion of liberation and freedom was\nnot was not something I was counting on. And I had no idea",
        "and no expectation that this was the day when the thing that\nI had forgotten about may happen, that I may be liberated\nand free. So there I was, sitting behind a barrack with\nother prisoners. Mind you in that camp there were, there\nwere hundreds and hundreds of unburied bodies because the\nwhole process of managing the camp was was stopped and_e so\nthere we were sitting behind the barrack. I think I had two\nor three potatoes and some prisoners started fires, little\nfires, and I had my bowl that all prisoners carried and that\nwas essential to have in order to receive rations of soup\nwhenever it was available and I tried to cook this potato\nand --- time passed, I really didn't think abut anything\nvery much. When I noticed out of the corner of my eye in\nthe distance amongst other barracks, people running. Just\nindividual prisoners I could see running all in a certain\ndirection and I still had the survival instinct even though\nI was by that time very tired and my life was ebbing and I\nwas on the verge of becoming a Muselman, if you know what it\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/14/95 Int GEORGE SALTON\nPage 5\nis, someone who no longer really cares about surviving.\nStill the instinct was there, and I saw these people running",
        "in this one direction. And I wanted to know why. Maybe\nthere was food or maybe something good was happening and I\nwanted to take advantage of it. Maybe there was something\nbad and I needed to know about it to try to avoid it. Mind\nyou,. aS a youngster I survived many years of concentration\ncamps and many selections by making myself invisible--15\nyear old boys were not supposed to stay alive in camps\nbecause they were not old enough to be to be productive\nworkers.\nRoll 2.\nSandy: I think a good place to start where you Saw...\nGEORGE SALTON:So there I was sitting, hidden kind of against\none the barracks protecting myself from the line of fire,\nwhere I noticed people running in the distance. In the\ndistance I could see individuals in the white and blue\nstriped prison uniforms running. And I initially wanted to\nignore it because it was safe and kind of warm sitting in\nthe sun over there, but my Survival instincts made me want\nto find out why the people were running and what\u2019 was\nhappening. There was maybe there were maybe good things to\nthat was to happen and I needed to know about it to take\nadvantage of it, there were maybe bad things that I needed\nto know about to avoid That was the instinct of a prisoner\nwho who no matter what the circumstance still wanted to\nSurvive. So after noticing the movement of people and _ the\nrunning, I followed, followed between the barracks, moved",
        "on, and came to an area of the camp where the latrines,\ntoilets, were located. It was a special area not only\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/14/95 Int GEORGE SALTON\nPage 6\nbecause the toilets were there but because this is the place\nwhere prisoners who are about to die for some strange\nreasons went to die. And there were mountains of bodies and\nmany dead people and so I ran in that direction and as I\ncame unto that place I noticed many prisoners yelling and\nscreaming and jumping and dancing and there standing amongst\nthem were seven giants, young people, they must have been 18\nor 19, American soldiers, thee were 7 or 8 of them standing\ninside the camp. Apparently they cut the wire and came into\nthe camp. They were bewildered by us, wild and unkempt and\ndirty and ? smelly people jumping and dancing and trying to\nembrace them and kiss them. And did too, I also joined the\ncrowd and yelled and screamed and somehow knew that the day\nof liberation has come. I was a strange feeling for me ,\nhowever, because, as I remember it, on the one hand, I was I\nwas overwhelmed by this unexpected and unhoped for encounter\nof freedom, but at the same time, what was happening was\noutside of me. I really didn't know what to make of it. I",
        "knew I was free, but I didn't count on it. I somehow didn't\nknow what it meant, and I knew it was great, but I was\noverjoyed because all people around me were overjoyed and\nwere Singing and dancing and and but I was 17 I was free,\nbut what it meant I wasn't sure. The soldiers were there\nfor for a few minutes, they were on patrols whose job, I'm\nsure, whose assignment was not to liberate a camp but to\nmarch along a certain road to some destination and after ten\nminutes or fifteen minutes they left. They just moved on\nthrough the wire. We looked around incidentally during all\nthat celebration and wonderful feeling, eh, the Germans were\ngone. The towers were empty, there were no soldiers, there\nwere no guards, and the Americans have left and some of us\nwho remembered the stories that our parents told us from the\nfirst war when the Austrians and the Russians kept moving\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/14/95 Int GEORGE SALTON\nPage 7\nback and forth across little town and advancing and\nretreating, some of us said: the Germans may come back. So\nwe left some groups of people, the Frenchmen, I saw them\narrange themselves into a kind of a marching order and\nwalked out oft he gate. And 5 of us Jewish young men_ who",
        "knew each other from home, left through the hole in the\nfence and through the forest. Not to search for freedom, or\nor, but to hide because we thought the Germans might come\nback. So while we were free and while the Germans were gone,\nwe were not really free because freedom didn't come like a\nsunrise where eh eh, one day we were in the dark and _ the\nnext day there was light and warmth and nurturing and\nrejoicing and celebration. Freedom came as something that\nhappened but did not effect us immediately. So we went into\nthe forrest not knowing what to do. I remember there was\nsome guns and and some pistol laying around in the forests.\nObviously, the Germans were retreating already at that time.\nWe tried to carry some of these weapons with us, expecting\nthat we may have to hide in the forrest and defend\nourselves, but quite frankly, the weapons were too heavy for\nus to carry. And we came to a little town. The towns\u2019 name\nis Ludwigslust. Only to discover as we walked into the\ntown, I think looking for some shelter, maybe for something\nto eat,that the town was still in German hands. I remember\nus walking coming around the corner and on the opposite side\nof the street there were two German officers with a woman\nwalking, and they were still in uniform and armed. They\nlooked at us and we looked at them and they moved on and we\nJumped over a hedge and hid ina little shack that was\napparently used by a painter to store his paint and we were\njust hiding over there waiting for darkness to leave the\ntown and hide in the forest again. So here we are liberated\nbut really did not recognize that. And toward the evening,",
        "Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/14/95 Int GEORGE SALTON\nPage 8\nas the sun started setting, American GIS came walking into\ntown.\nGEORGE SALTON:\nAnd we were liberated, we were liberated. We then knew that\nthe times of oppression and pain and beatings were behind\nand rather than saying me let me talk about myself. I\nreally didn't know what the future held, I recognized that\nmost likely I was alone, I recognized that most likely my\nparents were not--did not survive. I recognized I was still\nunprepared, I was obviously unprepared for freedom and\nselfsufficiently, and I was driven only to contact my\nrelatives in the United States in the hopes that my brother\nmight have survived and and when the family was separated\nback in early 42 my father uh instructed us all of us to\ncontact to contact our relatives in Europe because this is\nhow we will find each other. So that is how it happened.\nThe day of of pain and misery and then kind of a low key\ndevelopment that snuck up on us, Wonderful day--I shall\nnever forget it. A day I remember with great joy and great\npleasure, but it wasn't a day that help the kind of",
        "excitement that one would expect to see in the movies. It\nwas a day when freedom came, liberation came and of\nunannounced and unexpected.\nSandy: OK. Two minutes left.\nGEORGE SALTON:Well, let me talk a little bit about what\nhappened next. Urhm. Once we, once we, once Americans came\nto town in Ludwigslust, the five of us decided to, we didn't\nknow what to do, we really stayed in this little shack and\nwhich paint was stored. Slept and went around to the\nAmerican to the kitchens that cooked for the American\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/14/95 Int GEORGE SALTON\nPage 9\nsoldiers which by then occupied the town and begged for some\nfood. There were really no arrangements--and I'm not\ncomplaining I recognizing that there were no arrangements to\ntake care of us or the hundreds of other prisoners that were\nliberated in the camp in Woeblin. American soldiers were\nguite generous and helpful and sympathetic--they gave us\nfood, they gave us whatever they had including Hershey bars.\nAfter a few days of that existence Americans then started",
        "making arrangements to ship the various liberated prisoners\nto their homes. This--where we were liberated was to become\nthe Russian zone and the Americans were of course uh, uh\nexpecting to retreat from that area on the other side of the\nOder river. So the French were sent home to the West and the\nItalians went down south and the Poles and the Ukrainians\nthe Czechs were shipped east. we were, while we were\nJewish, we were still Polish. One day the Americans\ngathered up, gathered us from this little shack and put ona\ntruck with other people of Polish origin and sent east\ntowards the Russians whose lines were right outside the\ntown.

It was still a\ntime of waste, it was still a time of waiting, but at least\nthere was an opportunity for us to nurture each other to\nsomehow help each other in healing to give us a sense of\nimportance and value, but that was displaced person camp.\nThere was nothing dramatic about it, there was nothing\nreally helpful, it was just a time of waiting and and maybe\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/14/95 Int GEORGE SALTON\nPage 16\neh getting well, and maybe some of uS managed to go to\nschool.

So it was a time of waste,time of\nwaiting and in in October 1947, some two years and four\nmonths after liberation, my papers came through and I came\nto the United States where I started a new life.\nSandy: can you tell me a little about the conditions in the\nDP camps in the American zone--especially ??when you first\nwere there? Was it comfortable, was it overcrowded, was\nMost of, I mean,\nSandy: Let's ????\nNew Roll?\nGEORGE SALTON:Clearly, there was difference in the how the\nDP camps looked and operated in the first few months\u2019 after\nthe war when so many people were sick and dying and needed\nmedical attention and so on. But once, within three or so\nmonths after the war things settled to some routine. They\nwere all pretty much the same. Virtually all the camps were\nestablished in former military facilities of the German\narmy, navy army or military. We were housed in former\nmilitary barracks and our barracks in Germany and that\nbarracks made out of wood. but they were stone building\nwhere soldiers lived before. So the living conditions were\nguite austere, usually a number of people to a room, but",
        "given our background as prisoners and concentration camp,\nthis was still much better. Eh, food was distributed in\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/14/95 Int GEORGE SALTON\nPage 1/7\nkitchen, and some places later, for families it was possible\nto rather than that get in line to get you food in the\nkitchen, to get some supplies to people who had the need to\nand the ability cook could cook their own food. It was\nreally a a somewhat of a a regimented life eh which to those\nof us that came out of the camp looked wonderful time of\nvacation and recovery, I think to us today, would look eh eh\nwith our background, would look as a very restrictive and\nkind of a shabby existence. But this what it was. It it,\nwe were free to walk around and we're free to communicate,\nand we free involve ourselves in whatever in whatever civil\nand civic things were organized in the camp, but again, I\nneed to repeat, it was time for of waiting, waiting to\nIsrael, waiting to go to America, waiting to to find the\nmeans to live outside. It was also time of growing up, you\nknow, I was 18 and my hair grew and my I realized that I was\naman and I think I must have fallen in love once or twice\nas teenagers are apt to do, but eh, when people ask me _ to",

I needed, for example, then to work I remember\nin those days, hrrm, there were no dental facilities, I had\nto wait till I came to America to to to do whatever whatever\ndental work I needed to do, and and and I did not\u2019 see\nanything exciting, I did not see anything great.

I do remember,in in\nstill in Neustadt the fall of 1945, walking through--we are\nare free to of course go to town, there was a curfew, we had\nto be in the DP camp at a certain hour because the British\nwas locked the gates, but I remember walking through town.\nAnd I was 17, not quite 18. My hair, my hair was growing,\nI, my teeth were broken, and I Saw young German\nteenagers--eh, the fact that they were German was\nunimportant--going to school, young men, young boys, and\nyoung girls with school books and backpacks and laughing and\ngiggling as teenagers ought to do, and I remember the very\ngreat pain and very great sadness because I was convinced\nthat would never be part of my experience, and I remember\nthat envy. Eh, that I could no longer be one of those young\npeople that could laugh and giggle nd not be not be rally\nsomehow suppressed by memory and experience, and I, I, it\nwas a very painful experience for a young man to know that\nthe normal things that was that were available to others\nwere denied to me.

In the English DP camps there was very little of\nit, that that the DP camp in Neustadt was dominated by the\nmajority who was Christian. In the DP camp in Germany, I'm\nsorry in southern Germany, where there were primarily Jewish\ncamp, Jewish ceremonies, Jewish religious practices were\norganized for holidays for Sabatday.
