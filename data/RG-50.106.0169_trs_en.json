        "Q: Um, before we get to that, let\u2019s talk a little bit more about the conditions in -- in\nLienzingen. Did you sleep in a barracks?",
        "A: Yeah, there was -- there wasn\u2019t a barracks yet, and it was like a -- like a -- like\nherrings, one on top, next to each other, th-the bunks, like, you know? And the -- and I\nmean, it was -- was very bad. And that\u2019s frightened, more than anything else, to go to\nGermany. | figure, well I was born in Poland, I might as well die there, I don\u2019t want\nMarch 6, 2007\nto go to Germany. And th-they told us, this is the last week, and we\u2019re going to go\naway to Germany. I did make up my mind, I\u2019m not going to go. And I did escape\nfrom the -- from the place I was working, and they knew right away that I escape,\nbecause you have to line up for a roll call, and they were looking for me, I no -- I knew\nthat. And I took a chance, a big chance. I think my mind didn't work right, if anybody\nwith -- with the right mind, will not do what I did to escape. And the reason for that 1s,\nsome of them did escape, but they caught them in no time. And th -- when they caught\nthem in a Mo-Monday or Tuesday, or a Thursday, or whatever day was, they put them\n-- th-they brought them back to their camp to wh-where he escaped, and Sunday they\nbrought them out on roll call, everybody was there lined up. They brought them up,\nthey brought a portable gallow, and he was hanged. So I knew what\u2019s going to happen\nwhen -- when they catch me. But I made up my mind, I -- I blanked out, you know, I\ndidn\u2019t think about that, and I was lucky, very extremely lucky they didn\u2019t catch me. So\nI went from pillar to post, like the saying goes, knock on the door, beg for a piece of\nbread. Some -- some women, some people offered to give me a piece of bread, others\nslammed the door in my face. Get -- get the hell out of here, dirty Jew. They knew\nright -- right away I was Jewish. So after awhile, if I had somebody with me, I would\nprobably wind out in the -- in the forest, but by myself didn\u2019t know where to go, how\nto go. So, I was -- and I knew at the college, there was -- there were Jews there, and\nthere was a ghetto there, I knew that. So took me days, weeks, maybe several months,\nMarch 6, 2007\nlittle by little I got into the city, to college, and little kids were playing\n[indecipherable] ball there, and I went and talked to them, and I said, I understand the\nJews live here, they call it the ghetto or something, can you show me where it is? So\none boy is pulling on the other, don\u2019t talk to him, th-the -- it\u2019s prohibit and you can\u2019t\ngo there. You cannot go there, and the only -- the one of them said come, Ill show\nyou. He went with me and from a distance I saw already th-th-the fence, you know.\nAnd -- and I went there, and -- and I was walking close by. And there was a gate there,\nthe gate was open, the chain was hanging down, and the Germans, the Nazis were\ngoing back and forth. One was going this way, the other one was going this way, and\nthey meet. And the -- and the gate was open [indecipherable] down, when there\u2019s s --\nwhen they start talking, I crossed over and I smuggle myself in. They luckily didn\u2019t\nnotice me. But who noticed me? The Jewish police. Wh-What th -- they have a black\nuniform with the nightstick, and armband, dai politsi, police, and that\u2019s all they had.\nSo they grabbed me, and they start talking in Polish to me, what right do you have to --\nto smuggle yourself into the ghetto, in Polish. I says -- and I talk back in Yiddish. And\nthey couldn\u2019t believe, because oh, the kid was born probably amongst the Jews there,\nth-the -- ye -- you know, with Jew -- where a lot of Jewish live, and he picked up some\nJewish, he is not Jewish. And I tried to talk to him, I\u2019m Jewish, I\u2019m Jewish, no, no.\nThey took me 1n a room there and I said, I can tell you I\u2019m Jewish because there come\na transport from Kalish and there were some -- a couple of doctors there. Dr. Cohen\nMarch 6, 2007\nwas one of them. Then another one, but I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t remember the other\none, and they said to me [indecipherable] saying the other, well the kid is talking\nsense because they shipped out some people with the Dr. Cohen, somebody else,\nanyway. So they said, okay, what is your name? They wrote down the letters Fievish\nNicinski and then they wrote in big letters too, your name is Bahardian Elias, born\n[indecipherable]. And I was the age -- they make the age like 27 years old. So -- so\nwe g -- we going to check with you. We not tell you when, tomorrow, next day,\nwhatever it is. You\u2019re not going to take out a piece of paper, you have to memorize the\nname in where was you -- where was you born. So I recognized that [indecipherable]\nthat I had tried to memorize all this, and they took me in next day, what is your name?\nSo I have to tell them Bahardian [indecipherable] this and that. And then I learned\nfrom the others, that the guy like this escaped. They didn\u2019t notify the -- the German\nauthority, so they got a special ration of whatever the -- you know, bread and milk,\nwhatever it was. They didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t tell the German that he escaped. So I took\nhis name. And so from there, one fine night they circled the ghetto, raus, raus, raus,\nout, out, out. And they took us to another ghetto, Lodz. Lithmanstadt. They call it\nLodz, Lodz ghetto. There I was, and I worked there, I worked there hard. There was a\n-- a press, I was ironing, ironing uniforms, SS, Gestapo uniforms. And they told me,\nyou have to be extremely, extremely careful. Don\u2019t let any spot come out and make\nholes in it, because that\u2019s very dangerous. You -- you pay a big penalty for that. The\nMarch 6, 2007\nirons weren\u2019t like it is here, electric. They were born -- burn -- burn wood, like, used to\nbe, you know? And heated up the irons. And that\u2019s how it was. And from there they\ntook me to a camp near Skarzysko-Kamienna. That was the biggest Polish\nammunition factory.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",

        "Q: But your work was always outside?",
        "A: Mine was always outside, happened to be, yes.",

        "A: No, no, they have to be inside, no.",
        "Q: And did they give you enough food?",
        "A: No, very little food. Food wasn\u2019t very much at all. Lot of people think because it\nwas a labor camp they gave you more. If they did, I didn\u2019t noticed it.",
        "Q: And again, was it just coffee and soup and bread?",
        "A: Yeah, the same thing, yeah. Didn\u2019t change much from one camp to the other.",

        "A: Very little, we were disappointed. We were disappointed that, you know, they don\u2019t\ndo anything -- a better job than that, than -- they have a heavier bomb, a better bomb to\npenetrate. They didn\u2019t have it at that time. We were disappointed.",
        "Q: Did you know where the V2 rockets were going to be sent?",
        "A: No, no idea.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you -- you stayed in d -- in Dora for how long?",
        "A: Oh, quite a few months, I don\u2019t know exactly how long, but quite a few months.\nThen we went to, of course, the Buchenwald.",
        "Q: Did you know what Buchenwald was before you went?",
        "A: No, just the name. The same like Auschwitz. Was a city, nobody knew anything\nabout Auschwitz.",

        "Q: And when you got there, what did you see?\nMarch 6, 2007",
        "A: In Buchenwald\u2019? We saw misery. In Buchenwald it was -- it was a big camp, it\nwas over 80,000 people there. There were boys and girls there, in Buchenwald. That\nwas a huge camp.",
        "Q: And where did they put you?",
        "A: In barracks, like those -- those bunks, you know, like -- like sardines, one next to\nanother. And it was -- it wasn\u2019t very pleasant at all. The worst of all was the lice. You\nhave so much lice they eat you up alive. You scratch and they nest there, and you\nscratch more. You couldn\u2019t ask -- you couldn\u2019t tell a doctor or anybody like this that\nyou got hurt, or hurt you or something. You di -- can\u2019t open your mouth and saying\nanything like that. Once you say you si -- you sick, you\u2019re going.",
        "Q: Did you -- wa -- wer-were there lice in the other places that you had been?",
        "A: All of them, plenty. Sunday we took out the blanket, put them in the snow,\nwintertime. You picked them out, there was a perfect square, all dark, with hundreds\nand thousands pounds of lice. But the couple, two or three days after, they come back,\nbecause they -- they -- there -- there was some eggs still there, and they -- you know,\nthey -- they want a body, they come back. Oh yes.",
        "Q: So you never went to s -- a so-called infirmary?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: A-And you said you had lice on your body\u201d?\nMarch 6, 2007",
        "A: Yes, everywhere. Whole clothes, everything was soaked with sa -- with the -- with\nlice. They eat you up alive, they really did.",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do in Buchenwald, or did you do any work?",

        "Q: So you just sat, during the day?",
        "A: Do -- doing nothing, just sit there and do nothing. I didn\u2019t do anything, I don\u2019t\nremember that.",
        "Q: And again, what were your thoughts when you would see German soldiers? What\nthoughts would be going through your mind when you would see German soldiers,\nanything?",
        "A: You was terrified. You see a new uniform, that -- it was very, very upsetting.",
        "Q: Did they ever talk to you?",
        "A: They talk, not a nice way. They curse you. They damn you all the time, no matter\nwhat. You never do anything right. No matter what you do, it\u2019s still not right.",
        "Q: Did you try to make any attempts to escape from Buchenwald?",
        "A: No, not in Germany, no.",
        "Q: Because\u201d?",
        "A: Well, it was a foreign land. I just wanted to stay in Poland. Didn\u2019t work, so -- oh\nno, I wasn\u2019t going to do that, no. Not in -- not in Germany.\nMarch 6, 2007",
        "Q: And again, when you -- were there any people with you, any young men with you\nwho had come all of the -- 1-in the different camps with you, the same person whether\n-- were -- were there a group of people that stayed with you through all the different\ncamps, or was it every time you went to a different camp there were new people?",
        "A: Very few. Some of them did, but not that many, but they moved you around, they\nsplit you up, you know. You never knew -- no-not too many from my city. I can count\nthe -- you know, they were with me.",
        "Q: Were you an especially close group, those of you from your city?",
        "A: A close group, sure, yes.",
        "Q: W-Were you a support to each other, do you feel that that helped you?",
        "A: Well we were talking maybe tomorrow we were better, we hope we\u2019ll be liberated.\nWe knew it -- it\u2019s not good, but we hoped tomorrow will be better, that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: And so you were in Buchenwald for how long?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, six months, eight, something like that, I don\u2019t know.\nAnd then we went to another camp.",
        "Q: So for six months you just sat around?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember doing anything in Buchenwald, no.",
        "Q: And then they told you you\u2019d be leaving?",
        "A: Well, they didn\u2019t tell us, th-they took us one da -- one fine day to another camp.",
        "Q: And where was that?\nMarch 6, 2007",
        "A: That was the last camp, the third camp in Germany, that was Bergen-Belsen, and\nthat\u2019s where we were -- we were liberated by the British at that -- the British liberated\nBergen-Belsen. And three days prior to the liberation, they almost killed me. It was\nvery close. It happened on a Sunday. I went down the basement, there we take -- you\nknow, splash up the face with a little water sometime. And I come up with the -- with a\ncan that -- a rusty can that I had -- I find there, and -- it\u2019s water. Sure enough a German\nstanding above, and I\u2019m coming up the steps. [speaks German here] Wh-Where were\nyou? Like he couldn\u2019t see, he wasn\u2019t blind. I said, well I -- I went downstairs to get mi\n-- water. My hands were shaking and I was spilling the water a little bit, and I knew\nit\u2019s going to be a lot of trouble there. And sure enough, I c -- I get up closer, closer up.\nHe took out the -- the baton, th-the one he had the -- on the side there, the stick. But\nthat was different one, they made it with lead inside it, it\u2019s -- every time he hits you, it\nbreak your bone. And [indecipherable] it over the head, and split my head there, and I\nfalls, luckily, I fall forward and not back, because back is further you fell, you -- you\nwouldn\u2019t be here to tell the story. But I fell forward and I hit the edge and I -- and I\ncouldn\u2019t get up, of course, I was bleeding all over. And I was told that the -- the f -- the\n-- the -- the -- the friends, the one I was sl -- they were sleeping next to each other,\nthey -- they saw me there and they -- they dragged me into my -- into -- into the\nbarrack, in the bunk there, and -- and I was unconscious. I was un -- three -- three days\nI didn\u2019t go to pick up my bread there, nothing like that, I couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t, I was all\nMarch 6, 2007\nblack and blue and the nose was broken. So anyway they -- when they come there, the\nBritish liberated Bergen-Belsen, they took me the portable ambulance, if you will.\nAnd they did the best they could, they fix my nose. But they didn\u2019t put it right back,\nit\u2019s a little bit off [indecipherable] straight, it\u2019s a little bit off. And it can be seen or\nfelt if someone touches. And that was -- that was the closest one I ever come to -- to\ndie. And -- an-and -- and that was it. So I was liberated, and then -- then I have a\ncouple of cousins, I da -- wasn\u2019t with them in same camp. They were liberated by the\nAmericans, and --",
        "Q: Were -- you s -- you said that your cousins were 1n your -- in the same camp? Did\nyou say that?",
        "A: No, no, I -- in a different camp.",
        "Q: Oh, in a different --",
        "A: They were liberated by the Americans.",
        "Q: -- different camp. B-Before we get to the lib -- the liberation, again, let\u2019s just talk a\nlittle more about Bergen-Belsen, did you work there?",
        "A: No. No, not in Bergen-Belsen.",
        "Q: So again, you just sat.",
        "A: Yes. I sat there, yes, that\u2019s all, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And I know you had described very movingly, in detail about, in the very\nbeginning of your story, about the young man who tried to escape and was taken to the\nMarch 6, 2007\ngallows. You obviously had seen a lot of people, dead people in those years since then.\nWha -- wha -- how did you -- did you ever get accustomed to seeing dead people?",
        "A: You never get accustomed, you see there was every single night people die there.\nEvery single -- never miss one single night and nobody would die, some people died.\nThere were 10 - 15 - 20, even in -- in Buchenwald, it was recorded in 24 hours, 72\ndeath. So had to take the -- the clothes off, drag them out there, put them -- put them\noutside, and then they come with the wagon, which we have to pull it, and others will\nput -- put them on the wagons like -- like sticks, you know, they look like sticks, and\nmove them away. Every single day, every single day, never miss a day. There was\nnone on -- any corpses outside. You have to put them outside. Take the clothes off,\nand put them outside.",
        "Q: What does that do to a 18 - 19 - 20 year old to have to do that?",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t look good at all, we don\u2019t feel good. We feel well, today is them,\ntomorrow 1 -- it would be me, maybe. That\u2019s how they feel.",
        "Q: Was there a feeling of sadness that you had, or was it fear? What -- what do you\nthink your emotions are when you were forced to see this?",
        "A: Well, it was fear and sadness, both. Yeah.",
        "Q: And was there any intermingling with women in Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: No, there was th -- chicken wire was dividing up, that was the women with the\nmen. There were nothing common, there\u2019s nothing to talk. They were -- they walked\nMarch 6, 2007\nin their misery, we have our misery [indecipherable] no. There was nothing to talk\nabout.",
        "Q: So in all of those years, once you went -- started going to the labor camps and then\nto [indecipherable]",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- an-an-and Bergen-Belsen, you -- you really had no contact with girls or women?",
        "A: No, I never did, no, no.",
        "Q: And for a young man at that age, that must have been difficult. Or was it not on\nyour mind?",
        "A: No, that wasn\u2019t on my mind at all, because we have problems.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have the luxury of thinking about that. When the -- tell me about the\nliberation, what -- what was it like? I know you were sick, you said, but did you\nunderstand what was happening when the British soldiers came? Did you know what\nwas happening?",
        "A: I understood what\u2019s happened because they -- they took all the wires down, and --\nand th -- and they buried the corpses in -- in -- in the right place the way it should be\nburied, no-not mass graves. And it was -- it -- it was different ball game altogether.\nAnd even after the war -- after the liberation, that is, a lot of -- lot of people died there,\nby the hundreds and thousands because they\u2019re not used to eat. The stomach -- there\nwasn\u2019t much of a stomach, it\u2019s all shrunk, then they tried to expand, and they with all\nMarch 6, 2007\nkinds of diseases and sicknesses, you know, and they couldn\u2019t take it. So a lot of them\ndied. They have all kind diarrheas, and stuff like that. You couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom\nbecause there\u2019s only one bathroom an-and 50 or 100 - 200 people wanted to go. So\nthe-they built something the outside, li-like a -- a -- you know, and people go there,\noutside. Like -- like trenches with -- I don\u2019t know. Anyway, it wasn't very nice, and so\nafter that, like I mentioned, I had the couple of cousins there who were liberated by the\n-- by the Americans. They couldn\u2019t go to every camp, but in the gip -- in the big camps\nthey did go and looked up names. But after the war you -- you can get your own name,\nyou didn\u2019t have any more a number.",
        "Q: What -- what was your -- you were given a number? What was your number?",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember now, but I got there about six, seven numbers there. I don\u2019t\nremember that, I don\u2019t look at that.",
        "Q: I-In what camp were you given the number? Was it in Germany or in Poland?",
        "A: That was in Germany, | think. Yes, anyway, so 1 -- th -- my -- my two cousins, my\nmitha -- my mother and their father were sister brother, so that makes it -- make us\nfirst cousins. So they come and -- and a f-few of th -- few of those big camps like\nBuchenwald and they come to Bergen-Belsen, look up my name, oh they saw me\nthere [indecipherable] you know and he said, well, what do you have to lose here,\nlet\u2019s go in the medical zone. And I already find mine Aunt Rifka. Nothing do with --\nwith me, she not relati -- she not related to me at all. Rifka is my cousin\u2019s mother\u2019s\nMarch 6, 2007\nsister. So nothing to me. She\u2019s already there, but I knew her from -- from the ghetto.\nSo we went to -- in the American zone, and we stayed there in a place named\nBamberg, not too far from Nuremberg where those -- those criminals were jud -- you\nknow, judged. And we stayed there and then they wanted to come to America, and I\ndidn\u2019t feel like I wanted to come to America. It\u2019s -- something was bothering me.\nWhat it was is, I want to go as far as I possibly can, I don\u2019t have no -- no borders.\nAlthough it\u2019s a friendly border here with Canada, but th-the borders upset me in\nPoland. There was Russians, there were the Germans, none of them were good for the\nJews. So they went to America and I went a different direction altogether. I went to\nAustralia. And --",
        "Q: Right, right. Well talk about Australia in a minute. Di -- whe-when the British\ncame to you in -- in Bergen-Belsen for -- at liberation, di-did you feel a sense of\nfreedom at that point? What -- what -- what was it?",
        "A: I felt a sense of freedom cause I knew I was liberated. And th-the loudspeaker\nloudly was speaking every language there. You could understand that the food is on\nthe way, and the help is on the way. And -- and we feel good, because the wires came\ndown. Oh, that\u2019s okay. Th-The wire -- the wires came down and -- and we --we knew\nwe were liberated, and that was it.",
        "Q: What were your feel -- I mean, in all these years of being a prisoner, and now\nyou\u2019re liberated.\nMarch 6, 2007",
        "A: You had a good feeling when you were liberated, then the -- the -- another thing\nwas hope that my mother and father will be still alive, and the -- the rest of the family,\nbut --",
        "Q: Did you consider going back to your hometown?",
        "A: I never did.",
        "Q: Because\u201d?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want to go back because I had the [indecipherable] a gut feeling I had that\nPll -- Pll find nobody there. I di -- I didn't want to go. But my cousins did. They --\nthey -- they encourage me to go and I said no, I don\u2019t want to go to Poland back there,\nno. So they went and they went to their city, nobody there. They went to my little city\nwhere I was born, and there was nobody left there either. See, what they did is they\ntook the people out, the men, to the cemetery, and they dug a -- a trench there, didn\u2019t\nknow what for. And then after they finish, they took all the rest of th -- of the people\nout there and shoot them and bulldozed them down.",
        "Q: And do you think that\u2019s what happened to your parents?",
        "A: I guess. That\u2019s all I can guess, I don\u2019t know.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Felix Nicinski. This is tape number two, side B. And you\nMarch 6, 2007\nwere saying before that after liberation you did not want to go back to your town, but\nyour cousins did, and there was no one there, and you heard what had happened to\nyour family. So then your f -- and then your -- you said also before that you didn\u2019t\nwant to go to a place where there were borders, and that\u2019s why you decided to go to\nAustralia?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t want to have -- if that\u2019s what you call civilization,\nEurope, that\u2019s -- I have enough of that. So I wanted to go away as far as I possibly\ncan. That\u2019s how I wind up in Australia. I was there for some 10 years.",
        "Q: Okay, but where -- where were you before then? After the liberation and before you\nwent to Australia. Where were you living?",
        "A: Ina place named Bamberg in Germany, not far from Nuremberg.",
        "Q: Right, right, right, and what -- was that a displaced person\u2019s camp?",

        "Q: How did you know to do that?",
        "Q: And again, is this something you talked about with your parents? Did they give you\nany advice?",

        "Q: H-How did you know that you had to leave the ghetto?",
        "Q: Boys and girls?",

        "Q: And please describe Lienzingen to me.",
        "Q: Um, before we get to that, let\u2019s talk a little bit more about the conditions in -- in\nLienzingen. Did you sleep in a barracks?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Felix Nicinski. This is tape number one, side B. Let\u2019s go\nback a little bit in time, back to Lienzingen, I\u2019d like to get a little more information\nabout that work camp. What was the place before it became a work camp?",

        "Q: W-Were you a healthy child? Did you have any health problems growing up,\nbefore the war?",
        "Q: So you were sturdy, a sturdy young man?",
        "Q: Okay. And did you have any communication with your parents at that time, while\nyou were in Lienzingen?",
        "Q: Wa -- once you said goodbye to them in the ghetto, you did not have any more\ncommunication?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And did you have to wear a yellow star? Did you wear any kind of yellow\nbadge, yellow star?",
        "Q: What -- did they give you a uniform?",
        "Q: So you just had the clothes that you wore on your back, and had you brought other\nthings to the camp?",
        "Q: And were -- were your barracks 1n a big building, or -- what was the set-up of it?",
        "Q: Now -- and you also said you were -- you were digging ditches?",

        "Q: What food did they give you before you left for work?",
        "Q: And what about lunch?",
        "Q: And then you would -- did you march to the place of work?",
        "Q: Were you allowed to talk to the other young men while you were marching?",
        "Q: And the guards were German guards?",

        "Q: And then, what about di -- and then you -- you finished work and came back, and\ndid you have supper?",
        "Q: So what did the young mens -- your -- the people your age, what did you all talk\nabout? Did you -- what kinds of things did you communicate with each other?",
        "Q: And did people talk about resistance there? Did the young men speak about acts of\nresistance?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Besides that one young man who was caught, how many others tried to\nescape before you did?",
        "Q: No. What was the name of the young man they hung, do you know\u201d? The name of\nthe young man that they brought to the gallows, do you know?",
        "Q: How --",
        "Q: How soon after that did you decide to leave?",
        "Q: What do you attribute your strength to, to deciding to take this incredible chance? I\nmean, that took a lot of inner strength. H-Ho -- wh-what do you attribute that to?",
        "Q: Did you tell anybody you were going to do it?",
        "Q: What were you wearing when you -- and what time of day was it when you left?",
        "Q: And you were just wearing regular clothes?",
        "Q: Yeah. And how long did it take for you til you -- til you came up to meeting that\nfarm woman? How long did it take before you met the next person? How long were",
        "Q: So, you -- you did not meet a Polish woman who gave you breakfast and clothes\nbefore that?",
        "Q: And then, did you get any rides with farmers, at all?",
        "Q: What did you tell them, what was your story?",
        "Q: So they thought you were a Polish --",
        "Q: -- teenager?",
        "Q: Now, when exactly was this, this was in 1941?",
        "Q: And -- and what -- approximately what month?",
        "Q: What -- what was the weather like?",
        "Q: So you were 16 years old?",
        "Q: Were you still strong? Was your body still strong?",
        "Q: Did you eat any of the plants, or -- or -- what -- what were you eating to keep\nyourself going?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Then you talked about getting to Kalisz. Y-You\u2019ve already\ntalked about getting to Kalisz and proving that you were Jewish, and how you got that\nfalse identification.",
        "Q: Right, right. But let\u2019s talk a little more about Kalisz before we do the next -- next\nlocation, about the conditions there, and where you were living, and so forth.",
        "Q: And there was a fence around the ghetto?",
        "Q: Did you have your own room?",
        "Q: You stayed with a family?",
        "Q: Who was the family?",
        "Q: And were they welcoming to you, or did they resent you?",
        "Q: What were -- what was the state of mind of people in the ghetto at that time? What\n-- what did you sense? Do you remember what their thoughts were?",
        "Q: And did you see a lot of children in the ghetto?",
        "Q: And were they in good health?",
        "Q: And again, the food situation?",
        "Q: Th-They brought you fo -- you go -- got the food when you were living 1n your\nroom 1n the -- in the house?",
        "Q: Did you talk to a lot of different people?",
        "Q: But people you said were still optimistic?",
        "Q: Right. And how aware were you about what was happening in the rest of Europe at\nthat time? Did you know anything that was going on in other places, or you only knew\nwhat was happening to you in where you were?",
        "Q: Any radios?",
        "Q: And no newspapers?",
        "Q: So you had no idea?",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you try to get into communication with your parents at all?",
        "Q: Di-Did you miss them terribly? Did you miss them terribly?",
        "Q: Were you able to -- di-did you say you had no pencil or paper? Were you able to\nwrite anything down?",
        "Q: Well now, I meant writing down some of your thoughts, did -- were you aware of\npeople doing that?",
        "Q: Were there any deportations going on while you were there? Taking people away?",
        "Q: From -- from Kalisz, from the ghetto where they --",
        "Q: Kalisz.",
        "Q: Yeah, but before that, while you were still in the ghetto, were there previous\ndeportations, previous taking people away?",
        "Q: And how did you know about that?",
        "Q: So you just knew that people left, you didn\u2019t know where -- where they were going.",
        "Q: Yeah. And there, in that particular ghetto, di-did young people talk to you about\nany forms of resistance?",
        "Q: And -- and by that time you weren\u2019t thinking of resisting at all?",
        "Q: Were you there when some of -- they took some of the sick people to the forest and\nkilled them? Wha -- that was in October 1940. Were you there at that time?",
        "Q: And I also read that some of the Jews were forced to dismantle tombstones to make\nroads, and there th -- were you aware of that, either?",
        "Q: Okay, so you were there in Kalisz and then you said you went to --",
        "Q: -- L-L\u00e9odz. And how many people left with you?",
        "Q: So now the town was Judenrein?",
        "Q: And how did you get to the ghetto, L\u00e9dz ghetto.",
        "Q: And what were people saying? Do you remember, or -- or your other, you know, 16\n- 17 year old boys, what were they saying about what was happening to you all, that\nyou\u2019re forced to move?",
        "Q: You were only 16 - 17 years old at the time. Did you feel much older than a typical\n16 year old would feel?",
        "Q: All right. So then you get to the ghetto -- L\u00e9dz -- the L\u00e9dz ghetto, and let\u2019s talk\nlike again a little bit more specifically about that, where -- where you lived.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well, how long were you in the L\u00e9dz ghetto?",
        "Q: And again your health, the condition of your health, how was that?",
        "Q: And -- and yo -- you got enough food?",
        "Q: Did you ever meet Haim Rumkowski?",
        "Q: And what was your impression of him?",
        "Q: Di -- how did you know what work you were going to be -- what work you were\nassigned to do? Who told you?",
        "Q: Wh-Who is they?",
        "Q: Did you go -- ever go to the labor offices, or did they come to you? How did you\nknow what you had to -- that you had to iron uniforms?",
        "Q: How\u201d",
        "Q: These are other Jews coming to tell you this?",
        "Q: And again, what was the overall feeling of the people you were with, was it\noptimism or pessimism?",
        "Q: And what kind of work did other 16 year old boys do, besides what you did?",
        "Q: And -- and -- but you said you were pressing uniforms?",
        "Q: Ho-How did that make you fe -- uniforms for the Germans? How did that make you\nfeel, as a Jewish young man?",
        "Q: And what was the talk there, in the -- in -- in the L6dz ghetto about resistance?",
        "Q: An-And you did not think about yourself, for your own actions?",
        "Q: You had already done your big act of resistance, yeah. And again, at that point, did\npeople know -- this is a little bit later, of course, did people know what was happening\n-- again in -- in -- in Europe? What was happening to other Jews in other countries?",
        "Q: Did you work every single day, or did you ever have a day off?",
        "Q: So there was never a day that you did not work?",
        "Q: And what did you do on Sunday\u201d?",
        "Q: So when you would get together with other boys, other young men your age, 16 -\n17 - 18, what would you all do? What would you talk about?",
        "Q: Did you ever need any medical care while you were in Lodz?",
        "Q: And the clothes that you had still held up after all this time, this is -- these are the\nclothes you brought from home?",
        "Q: Was there like a -- a clearinghouse for clothes?",
        "Q: And did you have to wear any identifying marks showing that you were Jewish, on\nyour clothing?",
        "Q: This is in the Lodz ghetto?",
        "Q: How did you put it on?",
        "Q: And how did that make you feel?",
        "Q: Were you angry?",
        "Q: How did you live with that anger?",
        "Q: And did you have any co-contact with girls your age in the ghetto, 17 year old\ngirls?",
        "Q: Were there youth groups, youth organizations?",
        "Q: And -- and what -- you said you did see Rumkowski a lot, but you never talked to\nhim, what were your -- what were your feelings about him? Did you admire him?",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t -- di-did you have a feeling that people were very frightened, or just\ngoing -- living from day to day, which -- which mood were they in?",
        "Q: And how did the German guards treat you?",
        "Q: What -- what did they do?",
        "Q: Did that happen to you specifically, were you beaten and kicked and so forth?",
        "Q: Why? Why did -- for what?",
        "Q: So it isn\u2019t that they said you did something specifically wrong, they just did it, they\njust came around while you were working?",
        "Q: And -- and you do -- and obviously you can\u2019t fight back.",
        "Q: And di-did that happen frequently?",
        "Q: The entire time you were in the ghetto, were you -- you were pressing uniforms?",
        "Q: And then, wa -- then what was your next -- next thing that happened to you from\nthe ghetto?",
        "Q: Ho-Ho-How -- how -- how many people left the L\u00e9dz ghetto with you to go there?",
        "Q: An-And did they tell you where they were taking you when you | -- were I|-leaving\nthe L\u00e9dz ghetto?",
        "Q: Was it yo-young men like you in the group? Is that who the group was made up of?",
        "Q: All right, before we get to Germany, you said you were in Wartawerk, that wa --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay, was that in the town of Warta?",
        "Q: So it ha -- didn\u2019t have anything to do with the town of Warta?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nMarch 6, 2007\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Felix Nicinski, and this is tape number t-two, side A. And you had\ntalked before about being in the ghetto, the Lodz ghetto, and then leaving that to go to\nSkarzysko-Kamienna and what were the conditions there like?",
        "Q: When you say they, do you mean Germans, or Poles, or Jews?",
        "Q: These are Germans in army uniforms?",
        "Q: And what was a typical day like in that particular camp?",
        "Q: Did you get to know the young men your age better? Did you get to know the other\ny-young prisoners your age? Did you feel like you got to be friends with them?",
        "Q: Did you have any particular close friend, one or two close friends?",
        "Q: But were -- w-was there any p -- one that you were particularly close to?",
        "Q: What other towns did the other young men come from?",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Skarzysko-Kamienna?",
        "Q: And from there?",
        "Q: And -- and it was named because there\u2019s a river there?",
        "Q: And were there other camps nearby?",
        "Q: Okay, and let\u2019s talk about your -- what -- what happened in Wartawerk.",
        "Q: And did you -- did you go into the town of Czestochowa? You said it was near\nCzestochowa.",
        "Q: And again, were you just wearing your street clothes?",
        "Q: So that was the first camp that you had to wear stripes?",
        "Q: And how did that affect you?",
        "Q: Did you have a Jewish star on your striped uniform?",
        "Q: And the food situation?",
        "Q: Did you see any townspeople? Did any of them come by? Any people -- local\nPolish people, did any of them walk by? Did you ever see any of them?",
        "Q: I was thinking over the fence, or [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And again, in -- in -- in that labor camp, was there talk of resistance?",
        "Q: And so you just kept going along with what was happening?",
        "Q: What did you think was happening to your parents and your brother?",
        "Q: You were hoping they were still in -- in the yer -- your hometown?",
        "Q: Do you think that that\u2019s what kept you going?",
        "Q: And again, a typical day in -- in Wartawerk, was the same as in the previous\ncamps?",
        "Q: Was your place of work near where you were living? Did you have to walk a lot or\ndid you -- was the munitions factory nearby?",
        "Q: What were the sanitary conditions like there?",
        "Q: And were people coming in and out of Wartawerk, or were -- were there -- were\nthey taking people away, or -- or -- while you were there, or did everybody just stay?",
        "Q: Is this the time that you went?",
        "Q: So when was that?",
        "Q: All right, now how -- again, how did you know you were going to be leaving\nWartawerk?",
        "Q: How did you get there?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Now, you did not want to go to Germany before.",
        "Q: Right. And that\u2019s why you escaped. So what were your thoughts now here, that you\nwere going to Germany?",
        "Q: So you then arrive in -- in Dora.",
        "Q: And -- and what will you do, what were you working at there?",
        "Q: Before -- yeah, w-we\u2019ll talk about Buchen-Buchenwald in a minute. Yo- You were\nwilling to get killed in Dora in the bombing raid?",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "Q: W-Was this -- were they starting to make the V2 bombers at that time?",
        "Q: Now, when you said you were into the bunkers, was that the tunnels that they had\nat Dora?",
        "Q: But your work was always outside?",
        "Q: Because I understand that the people who worked inside couldn\u2019t get outside.",
        "Q: And did they give you enough food?",
        "Q: And again, was it just coffee and soup and bread?",
        "Q: Ho -- were you very, very thin by that point?",
        "Q: [indecipherable] your health at that point?",
        "Q: S-So, when you were in Dora, did you have any hope left?",
        "Q: Did you know where the V2 rockets were going to be sent?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you -- you stayed in d -- in Dora for how long?",
        "Q: Did you know what Buchenwald was before you went?",
        "Q: And how many were in your group when you left from Dora to Buchenwald?",
        "Q: And wher -- and where did you think, or -- where did you think you would be\ngoing?",
        "Q: And when you got there, what did you see?",
        "Q: And where did they put you?",
        "Q: Did you -- wa -- wer-were there lice in the other places that you had been?",
        "Q: So you never went to s -- a so-called infirmary?",
        "Q: A-And you said you had lice on your body\u201d?",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do in Buchenwald, or did you do any work?",
        "Q: So you just sat, during the day?",
        "Q: And again, what were your thoughts when you would see German soldiers? What\nthoughts would be going through your mind when you would see German soldiers,\nanything?",
        "Q: Did they ever talk to you?",
        "Q: Did you try to make any attempts to escape from Buchenwald?",
        "Q: Because\u201d?",

        "A: Lienzingen was the first camp, and we worked, they took us several kil-kilomers,\nwe had to walk to a place, a zoological garden. There was no animals, we were the\nanimals actually, and we dug ditches. They measured up so many -- so many feet th-\nthe lengths, so many feet the widths, and so many feet the depth. And you have to do it\nthrough -- through the day. Day in and day out, the same thing, may -- we dug those\ndi-ditches. And it was terrible, very, very bad. And they told us, this is the last week,\nand we going to go to another place, going to be much nicer, the food will be better,\neverything will be better, and the -- we\u2019re going to go -- they\u2019re going to ship us to\nGermany. And I didn\u2019t like it, to go Germany, I didn\u2019t like it at all. So I didn\u2019t tell\nanybody in the camp, my friends, that I made up my mind I\u2019m not going to go, I going\nto escape. Well, I mean -- and so --",
        "A: Yeah, there was -- there wasn\u2019t a barracks yet, and it was like a -- like a -- like\nherrings, one on top, next to each other, th-the bunks, like, you know? And the -- and I\nmean, it was -- was very bad. And that\u2019s frightened, more than anything else, to go to\nGermany. | figure, well I was born in Poland, I might as well die there, I don\u2019t want\nMarch 6, 2007\nto go to Germany. And th-they told us, this is the last week, and we\u2019re going to go\naway to Germany. I did make up my mind, I\u2019m not going to go. And I did escape\nfrom the -- from the place I was working, and they knew right away that I escape,\nbecause you have to line up for a roll call, and they were looking for me, I no -- I knew\nthat. And I took a chance, a big chance. I think my mind didn't work right, if anybody\nwith -- with the right mind, will not do what I did to escape. And the reason for that 1s,\nsome of them did escape, but they caught them in no time. And th -- when they caught\nthem in a Mo-Monday or Tuesday, or a Thursday, or whatever day was, they put them\n-- th-they brought them back to their camp to wh-where he escaped, and Sunday they\nbrought them out on roll call, everybody was there lined up. They brought them up,\nthey brought a portable gallow, and he was hanged. So I knew what\u2019s going to happen\nwhen -- when they catch me. But I made up my mind, I -- I blanked out, you know, I\ndidn\u2019t think about that, and I was lucky, very extremely lucky they didn\u2019t catch me. So\nI went from pillar to post, like the saying goes, knock on the door, beg for a piece of\nbread. Some -- some women, some people offered to give me a piece of bread, others\nslammed the door in my face. Get -- get the hell out of here, dirty Jew. They knew\nright -- right away I was Jewish. So after awhile, if I had somebody with me, I would\nprobably wind out in the -- in the forest, but by myself didn\u2019t know where to go, how\nto go. So, I was -- and I knew at the college, there was -- there were Jews there, and\nthere was a ghetto there, I knew that. So took me days, weeks, maybe several months,\nMarch 6, 2007\nlittle by little I got into the city, to college, and little kids were playing\n[indecipherable] ball there, and I went and talked to them, and I said, I understand the\nJews live here, they call it the ghetto or something, can you show me where it is? So\none boy is pulling on the other, don\u2019t talk to him, th-the -- it\u2019s prohibit and you can\u2019t\ngo there. You cannot go there, and the only -- the one of them said come, Ill show\nyou. He went with me and from a distance I saw already th-th-the fence, you know.\nAnd -- and I went there, and -- and I was walking close by. And there was a gate there,\nthe gate was open, the chain was hanging down, and the Germans, the Nazis were\ngoing back and forth. One was going this way, the other one was going this way, and\nthey meet. And the -- and the gate was open [indecipherable] down, when there\u2019s s --\nwhen they start talking, I crossed over and I smuggle myself in. They luckily didn\u2019t\nnotice me. But who noticed me? The Jewish police. Wh-What th -- they have a black\nuniform with the nightstick, and armband, dai politsi, police, and that\u2019s all they had.\nSo they grabbed me, and they start talking in Polish to me, what right do you have to --\nto smuggle yourself into the ghetto, in Polish. I says -- and I talk back in Yiddish. And\nthey couldn\u2019t believe, because oh, the kid was born probably amongst the Jews there,\nth-the -- ye -- you know, with Jew -- where a lot of Jewish live, and he picked up some\nJewish, he is not Jewish. And I tried to talk to him, I\u2019m Jewish, I\u2019m Jewish, no, no.\nThey took me 1n a room there and I said, I can tell you I\u2019m Jewish because there come\na transport from Kalish and there were some -- a couple of doctors there. Dr. Cohen\nMarch 6, 2007\nwas one of them. Then another one, but I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t remember the other\none, and they said to me [indecipherable] saying the other, well the kid is talking\nsense because they shipped out some people with the Dr. Cohen, somebody else,\nanyway. So they said, okay, what is your name? They wrote down the letters Fievish\nNicinski and then they wrote in big letters too, your name is Bahardian Elias, born\n[indecipherable]. And I was the age -- they make the age like 27 years old. So -- so\nwe g -- we going to check with you. We not tell you when, tomorrow, next day,\nwhatever it is. You\u2019re not going to take out a piece of paper, you have to memorize the\nname in where was you -- where was you born. So I recognized that [indecipherable]\nthat I had tried to memorize all this, and they took me in next day, what is your name?\nSo I have to tell them Bahardian [indecipherable] this and that. And then I learned\nfrom the others, that the guy like this escaped. They didn\u2019t notify the -- the German\nauthority, so they got a special ration of whatever the -- you know, bread and milk,\nwhatever it was. They didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t tell the German that he escaped. So I took\nhis name. And so from there, one fine night they circled the ghetto, raus, raus, raus,\nout, out, out. And they took us to another ghetto, Lodz. Lithmanstadt. They call it\nLodz, Lodz ghetto. There I was, and I worked there, I worked there hard. There was a\n-- a press, I was ironing, ironing uniforms, SS, Gestapo uniforms. And they told me,\nyou have to be extremely, extremely careful. Don\u2019t let any spot come out and make\nholes in it, because that\u2019s very dangerous. You -- you pay a big penalty for that. The\nMarch 6, 2007\nirons weren\u2019t like it is here, electric. They were born -- burn -- burn wood, like, used to\nbe, you know? And heated up the irons. And that\u2019s how it was. And from there they\ntook me to a camp near Skarzysko-Kamienna. That was the biggest Polish\nammunition factory.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: In Dora it was -- that was the forest -- the forest camp already. And that was --\nhappened to be the worst one of all, so far. I was working outside, loading the ready\nmaterial what came out from the bunker, and also unloading the raw material what\ncame in. And the sirens start blowing the [indecipherable] the siren, and they said no\nmatter what you\u2019re doing, drop everything, and if you hear that, run into the bunker as\nfast as you possibly can. So it happen, you know, we hear the siren blowing, and we\nrun into 1 -- into the bunker and in groups, the Polish groups here, Hungarian groups a\nMarch 6, 2007\ndifferent place, Romanian, Czechs and so on. And we talk quiet in the Polish so\nwouldn\u2019t understand. And we could hear a little bit that they bomb above us. And was\nall over, raus, raus, out, out, out, went out, and we were disappointed. Were so\ndisappointed maybe next time God will help, it\u2019Il penetrate and -- and we\u2019ll all get\nkilled, because it was miserable, we couldn\u2019t take it no more. Well, another time came\nand was the same thing, and we were disappointed. And finally they say, well, this is\nthe last week you\u2019re going to work here, they\u2019re going to go to another place, it\u2019s\ngoing to be much better. So we say, well, you see, he said [indecipherable] he said\nthere\u2019s no God, oh there\u2019s God, oh glory halleluiah, there\u2019s a God after all, we hug\neach other. The name didn\u2019t mean anything, really. So from Dora, we went to a place\nnamed Buchenwald.",

        "A: No, no idea.",

        "A: In barracks, like those -- those bunks, you know, like -- like sardines, one next to\nanother. And it was -- it wasn\u2019t very pleasant at all. The worst of all was the lice. You\nhave so much lice they eat you up alive. You scratch and they nest there, and you\nscratch more. You couldn\u2019t ask -- you couldn\u2019t tell a doctor or anybody like this that\nyou got hurt, or hurt you or something. You di -- can\u2019t open your mouth and saying\nanything like that.

        "A: No.\nMarch 6, 2007",
        "A: Yes, everywhere. Whole clothes, everything was soaked with sa -- with the -- with\nlice. They eat you up alive, they really did.",

        "A: Well, it was a foreign land. I just wanted to stay in Poland. Didn\u2019t work, so -- oh\nno, I wasn\u2019t going to do that, no. Not in -- not in Germany.\nMarch 6, 2007",
        "A: Very few. Some of them did, but not that many, but they moved you around, they\nsplit you up, you know. You never knew -- no-not too many from my city. I can count\nthe -- you know, they were with me.",

        "A: Well, they didn\u2019t tell us, th-they took us one da -- one fine day to another camp.\nMarch 6, 2007",
        "A: That was the last camp, the third camp in Germany, that was Bergen-Belsen, and\nthat\u2019s where we were -- we were liberated by the British at that -- the British liberated\nBergen-Belsen. And three days prior to the liberation, they almost killed me. It was\nvery close. It happened on a Sunday. I went down the basement, there we take -- you\nknow, splash up the face with a little water sometime. And I come up with the -- with a\ncan that -- a rusty can that I had -- I find there, and -- it\u2019s water. Sure enough a German\nstanding above, and I\u2019m coming up the steps. [speaks German here] Wh-Where were\nyou? Like he couldn\u2019t see, he wasn\u2019t blind. I said, well I -- I went downstairs to get mi\n-- water. My hands were shaking and I was spilling the water a little bit, and I knew\nit\u2019s going to be a lot of trouble there. And sure enough, I c -- I get up closer, closer up.\nHe took out the -- the baton, th-the one he had the -- on the side there, the stick. But\nthat was different one, they made it with lead inside it, it\u2019s -- every time he hits you, it\nbreak your bone. And [indecipherable] it over the head, and split my head there, and I\nfalls, luckily, I fall forward and not back, because back is further you fell, you -- you\nwouldn\u2019t be here to tell the story. But I fell forward and I hit the edge and I -- and I\ncouldn\u2019t get up, of course, I was bleeding all over. And I was told that the -- the f -- the\n-- the -- the -- the friends, the one I was sl -- they were sleeping next to each other,\nthey -- they saw me there and they -- they dragged me into my -- into -- into the\nbarrack, in the bunk there, and -- and I was unconscious. I was un -- three -- three days\nI didn\u2019t go to pick up my bread there, nothing like that, I couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t, I was all\nMarch 6, 2007\nblack and blue and the nose was broken. So anyway they -- when they come there, the\nBritish liberated Bergen-Belsen, they took me the portable ambulance, if you will.\nAnd they did the best they could, they fix my nose. But they didn\u2019t put it right back,\nit\u2019s a little bit off [indecipherable] straight, it\u2019s a little bit off. And it can be seen or\nfelt if someone touches. And that was -- that was the closest one I ever come to -- to\ndie. And -- an-and -- and that was it. So I was liberated, and then -- then I have a\ncouple of cousins, I da -- wasn\u2019t with them in same camp. They were liberated by the\nAmericans, and --",
        "A: No, no, I -- in a different camp.",

        "A: Yes. I sat there, yes, that\u2019s all, mm-hm.\nMarch 6, 2007\ngallows. You obviously had seen a lot of people, dead people in those years since then.\nWha -- wha -- how did you -- did you ever get accustomed to seeing dead people?",
        "A: You never get accustomed, you see there was every single night people die there.\nEvery single -- never miss one single night and nobody would die, some people died.\nThere were 10 - 15 - 20, even in -- in Buchenwald, it was recorded in 24 hours, 72\ndeath. So had to take the -- the clothes off, drag them out there, put them -- put them\noutside, and then they come with the wagon, which we have to pull it, and others will\nput -- put them on the wagons like -- like sticks, you know, they look like sticks, and\nmove them away. Every single day, every single day, never miss a day. There was\nnone on -- any corpses outside. You have to put them outside. Take the clothes off,\nand put them outside.",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t look good at all, we don\u2019t feel good. We feel well, today is them,\ntomorrow 1 -- it would be me, maybe. That\u2019s how they feel.",
        "A: Well, it was fear and sadness, both. Yeah.",
        "A: No, there was th -- chicken wire was dividing up, that was the women with the\nmen. There were nothing common, there\u2019s nothing to talk. They were -- they walked\nMarch 6, 2007\nin their misery, we have our misery [indecipherable] no. There was nothing to talk\nabout.",
        "A: [indecipherable]",

        "A: No, that wasn\u2019t on my mind at all, because we have problems.",
        "A: I understood what\u2019s happened because they -- they took all the wires down, and --\nand th -- and they buried the corpses in -- in -- in the right place the way it should be\nburied, no-not mass graves. And it was -- it -- it was different ball game altogether.\nAnd even after the war -- after the liberation, that is, a lot of -- lot of people died there,\nby the hundreds and thousands because they\u2019re not used to eat. The stomach -- there\nwasn\u2019t much of a stomach, it\u2019s all shrunk, then they tried to expand, and they with all\nMarch 6, 2007\nkinds of diseases and sicknesses, you know, and they couldn\u2019t take it. So a lot of them\ndied. They have all kind diarrheas, and stuff like that. You couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom\nbecause there\u2019s only one bathroom an-and 50 or 100 - 200 people wanted to go. So\nthe-they built something the outside, li-like a -- a -- you know, and people go there,\noutside. Like -- like trenches with -- I don\u2019t know. Anyway, it wasn't very nice, and so\nafter that, like I mentioned, I had the couple of cousins there who were liberated by the\n-- by the Americans. They couldn\u2019t go to every camp, but in the gip -- in the big camps\nthey did go and looked up names. But after the war you -- you can get your own name,\nyou didn\u2019t have any more a number.",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember now, but I got there about six, seven numbers there. I don\u2019t\nremember that, I don\u2019t look at that.",
        "A: That was in Germany, | think. Yes, anyway, so 1 -- th -- my -- my two cousins, my\nmitha -- my mother and their father were sister brother, so that makes it -- make us\nfirst cousins. So they come and -- and a f-few of th -- few of those big camps like\nBuchenwald and they come to Bergen-Belsen, look up my name, oh they saw me\nthere [indecipherable] you know and he said, well, what do you have to lose here,\nlet\u2019s go in the medical zone. And I already find mine Aunt Rifka. Nothing do with --\nwith me, she not relati -- she not related to me at all. Rifka is my cousin\u2019s mother\u2019s\nMarch 6, 2007\nsister. So nothing to me. She\u2019s already there, but I knew her from -- from the ghetto.\nSo we went to -- in the American zone, and we stayed there in a place named\nBamberg, not too far from Nuremberg where those -- those criminals were jud -- you\nknow, judged. And we stayed there and then they wanted to come to America, and I\ndidn\u2019t feel like I wanted to come to America. It\u2019s -- something was bothering me.\nWhat it was is, I want to go as far as I possibly can, I don\u2019t have no -- no borders.\nAlthough it\u2019s a friendly border here with Canada, but th-the borders upset me in\nPoland.

They went to my little city\nwhere I was born, and there was nobody left there either.
