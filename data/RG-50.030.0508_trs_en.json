        "A: Well, first the -- my father\u2019s business was such that the end of the day, the people would\ncome to the ha -- to our home to get paid for the merchandise that they delivered. And so I was\ninvolved in meeting all these people and listening to all these stories, and I was also familiar with\nthe various telegrams that my father would get from over -- from Latvia, from England or\nBelgium, where offers were being made for ma -- for flax or whatever, and I would be involved\nwith converting it from their currencies, to our currency, which was the lit, 1-1-t. And I was\ninvolved with my father in analyzing the flax seed, because flax seed is sold based upon the\npercentage of good seeds, less any defective ones or less any other things which got into the --\nthe seeds. So that you would have to analyze it and determine what percentage is flax seed. And\nyou would have to weigh them, and you would have to pick out all the defective ones.

        "Q: Did he play with you?",
        "A: Not really.",
        "Q: Oh.",

        "Q: Right. And what about your mother, what was she like?",
        "A: My mother was a very warm and a very caring person, and she helped my father in the\nbusiness.

        "Q: Did she play with you, or was this not a relationship parents had with kids?",
        "A: It was not that kind of relationship where parents played with the children.",

        "A: You did not play with your parents.",
        "Q: Did your mother cook?",
        "A: Oh yes, my mother cooked, but we had servants in the house that did the heavy work. And --\nbut my mother cooked and my mother baked.",

        "Q: We have a phone, so we\u2019re going to stop the tape. Are we ready? Are we back? Okay. So was\nyour family religious? When you -- you said that there was 1n some sense we -- you were\nreligious, tell us --",
        "A: Well yes, my family was religious, my mother kept a kosher home. I recall going to shul with\nmy father every Friday night, and every Saturday morning, and obviously every holiday. We\ncelebrated all the holidays and my grandfather was very religious and he spent most of his time\nstudying in the synagogue?",
        "Q: And this was your father\u2019s father, or your mother\u2019s father?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s father.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember -- I\u2019m -- ma -- whether my father\u2019s father was also studying, but I\nremember he had a long beard, and I would have assumed that he would have observed the\nkashrut laws and everything else.",
        "Q: Now you said your father did not obey all the laws, that he wasn\u2019t -- what did you mean?",
        "A: Well, there were occasions in his business, which would require him to travel maybe on a\nShabbat.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And he would do that?",
        "A: And he would do that because he had no choice --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- a -- in order to get home on whatever, that he would sort of overlook that particular\ncommandment.",
        "Q: Right, right. What -- what kind of a house or apartment -- I don\u2019t know what you had, did you\nhave a -- a house that you lived in?",
        "A: We had an apartment and it was a two story building and we lived on the second floor and we\nwere one of the few apartments that had running water, it had a toilet inside the apartment and it\nhad a shower and a bathtub inside the apartment. And as a result, many of the relatives would\ncome to the apartment to take a bath or a shower, or whatever.",
        "Q: And what sort of a neighborhood? Was it primarily a Jewish neighborhood or was it a mixed\nneighborhood?",
        "A: Yes, it was primarily a Jewish neighborhood out of the -- as a -- I don\u2019t know whether I\nmentioned it, the pa -- total population of that city was approximately 20,000 or 22,000, there\nwere approximately 7,000 Jews. So the Jews were primarily the merchants in town as well as the\ncraftsmen.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. When you went to school, did you like school?",
        "A: Well, you really had -- didn\u2019t have much of a choice whether you liked it or not. You just\nwent to school, I\u2019m -- I attended a Hebrew gymnasium where all the subjects were taught in\nmodern Hebrew.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. So that for instance, if I had to translate Latin, I would translate Latin into Hebrew and\nvice versa. And math, sciences and whatever, physics, chemistry were all taught in modern\nHebrew, like they do teach them today in Israel.",
        "Q: Was that unusual in -- in --",
        "A: Well, there were several schools like that. There was one school in our town and there was\nanother school in Kovno, and there was another school I know in Shaul -- Shaulenay --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- which is another city. And -- and then there were [indecipherable] where many of the\nreligious young Jewish boys attended. They even built a school for the girls called Gavna, where\nthe girls could attend a modern Hebrew high school.",
        "Q: Did -- did you learn modern Hebrew before you went to school, or you learned it when you\nstarted school? This -- you started at --",
        "A: I presume -- I presume -- I\u2019m trying to think back.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I guess I learned it in school.",
        "Q: And you started in the school as -- in kindergarten, 1s it --",
        "A: In kindergarten --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And school had -- you would spend t -- in order to graduate, I guess you would spend 12\nyears in school.",
        "Q: Right. So I know that you had to go to school.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But did you like it?",
        "A: Certain subjects I loved.",
        "Q: So what did you love?",
        "A: I loved math, I loved science. I -- I loved history. The subjects that I didn\u2019t like were\nlanguages.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t like it?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So that school had to be tough on you because you had to translate everything?",
        "A: Yes. Right, and I had to study Latin and I had to study Lithuanian and German, and\nfortunately for me, I failed Lithuanian and Latin.",
        "Q: You failed?",
        "A: Failed.",
        "Q: Now why was that --",
        "A: It was a failure.",
        "Q: You were --",
        "A: And I failed Lithuanian and Latin because basically Latin, you have to spend a lot of time\nstudying and memorizing. And I used to play a lot of soccer with my friends and studying\nlanguages was not exactly my forte. So as a result, I failed Lithuanian and Latin. And people\nwould ask me, well how could you fail Lithuanian when you lived in Lithuania? I said, it\u2019s very\nsimple. To me Lithuanian was like a foreign language because at home we spoke Yiddish.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: In school we spoke Hebrew.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The only time I would have occasion to speak Lithuanian, if I went to some kind of\ngovernment office, whether it\u2019s a bank, or a post office. But otherwise I really didn\u2019t have much\noccasion to speak Lithuanian, so Lithuanian was like another foreign language.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t have fr-friends outside of the Jewish community then, so the kids you were\nwith spoke -- did you speak Yiddish with the kids?",
        "A: All the kids that I associated with attended the Hebrew gymnasium, which I did.",
        "Q: So what did you speak together, Hebrew, or --",
        "A: Either Hebrew or Yiddish.",
        "Q: So you were good at soccer? You liked it a lot.",
        "A: Oh, soccer I liked a lot.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you play every day?",
        "A: Practically.",
        "Q: Yeah? Were you on a team?",
        "A: Yes, I was on the Maccabee team.",
        "Q: And?",
        "A: And as a matter of fact I remember traveling to Kovno and some other cities, where we\nplayed soccer against they -- their teams.",
        "Q: And you would play against the other Hebrew school teams, I gather, right?",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: So, the World Cup is a big deal to you, I suppose [indecipherable] right?",
        "A: A very big deal, I been watching it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I enjoyed it very much.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I sometimes feel when I\u2019m watching it like I\u2019m ready to push or pull or run.",
        "Q: Yeah, right. Tell me, you said it was lucky that you failed Lithuanian and --",
        "A: Latin.",
        "Q: -- Latin. Why was that lucky? Didn\u2019t they do something to you if you failed?",
        "A: Yes. As a result of my failure of Lithuanian and Latin, I was left back in grade for a whole\nyear.",
        "Q: Which grade?",
        "A: It was -- I was then probably 13.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So it must have been like sixth grade, and as a result I went to school with kids that were a\nyear younger than I was. Well, the disgrace, the humiliation of going to school with kids who are\na year younger than you are, was so devastating that I wanted to run away from home. But when\nyou're 16 years old, where you going to run? So I remembered that a couple years prior to that,\nmy mother\u2019s brother, my uncle, visited his family, and he came from New York, and he stayed in\nmy mother\u2019s apartment. And when he saw the housekeeper bring to my bed in the morning and\nin the evening, warm milk and cookies, he said to my mother, you are ruining that boy, he\u2019II\nnever amount to anything. You better send him with me to u -- to the United States. So now that\nI wanted to run away from home because of the humiliation of being left back 1n school, what do\nI do? I write my uncle. Now, I didn\u2019t think at the time that I would be able to get a visa as\nquickly as I did, but my uncle got busy and prepared the necessary affidavits, and he send them\nthrough HIAS to Kovno, and one day I got a call from HIAS Kovno that they received the\naffidavits and the papers, and that the American counsel would like to see me. Well, I went to\nKovno to meet the American counsel. And as you recall there was a depression in the United\nStates in 1936 and the American counsel had like 17 visas to grant for the whole country. But\nwhen he saw my application, he figured I am not going to be a burden on the state because I have\nan uncle who 1s going to take care of me, I\u2019m not going to take anybody else\u2019s job. So he grants\nme the visa immediately. Now frankly, I wasn\u2019t ready to go that soon. But having put my uncle\nto all the trouble of preparing all the necessary affidavits and -- and all my friends knew that I\nhad wa -- a visa to the United State. It is -- 1t wasn't feasible for me to back out at that particular\npoint in time. So I came to the United States and fortunately, I survived. If I had not failed\nLithuanian and Latin, and if I didn\u2019t run away from Lithuania, I might have been one of the six\nmillion.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that\u2019s why I said to you I was very lucky that I failed Lithuanian and Latin.",
        "Q: What did -- did you tell your mother and father that you were writing to your uncle?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And did they say why are you doing this, were they upset?",
        "A: Well, my mother was supportive.",
        "Q: She was?",
        "A: Because it was her brother.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: My father wasn\u2019t exactly enamored with the idea, but my father was a businessman who\ntraveled a lot, and he -- his attitude was, you go, you don\u2019t like it, you come back. We\u2019Il come to\nvisit you, whatever. So it was not like a [indecipherable] thing.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: It was like, you go to take advantage of the situation.",
        "Q: Right. But let me go back before we leave Lithuania. You have a brother, Chaim.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how much younger is he than you?",
        "A: He is six years younger than I am.",
        "Q: Six?",
        "A: Six.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s a big --",
        "A: Difference.",
        "Q: -- difference. So he\u2019s born in 1926.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Were you close with him, or was the difference so big that --",
        "A: We to -- the difference was so big, and I had my own friends and he had his own friends. So\nthat we were together, but -- and we would go away on vacations together, but because of the\ndifference in age, I gravitated to my age group and he did --",
        "Q: To his.",
        "A: -- to his age group.",
        "Q: Right. Hm. Where did you go on vacations, before you left?",
        "A: Well, I must admit that I went on my vacations to a place called Palangin, which is on the\nBaltic Sea. It\u2019s a beautiful resort, and we would stay in what they used to call in those days, a\npensionne, which means you would get a room and you would get three meals a day. And so my\npa -- in some years my parents rented a house in Palangin, and so we stayed in the house and\nbrought a housekeeper and so forth and so on.",
        "Q: And you liked it there?",
        "A: I loved it there.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Well, it -- it was going to the beach every day.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It was in the -- it had magnificent trees adjoining the beach, pine trees, which is very unusual.\nAnd the path was lined with pine needles. And in the afternoon at four o\u2019clock there would be an\norchestra playing in the park. It was a very nice life. As a matter of fact there were, just before I\ncame to the United States, I spent my last summer in Palangin.",
        "Q: With your family?",
        "A: With my family.",
        "Q: Right. I think we\u2019ll stop the tape now.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: I understand that you had another language, you spoke Russian?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did that hap -- how did that happen?",
        "A: Well, because my nurse was Russian, and so probably the first language that I have learned\nwas Russian and Yiddish. Russian from the nurse and Yiddish from my parents.",
        "Q: Do you still speak Russian?",
        "A: I still speak Russian. I can understand Russian and can my -- can make myself understood in\nRussian. I-I don\u2019t speak a perfect Russian, but I manage to speak.",
        "Q: So did you speak Russian all through your childhood, as well as Yiddish and Hebrew?",
        "A: Yes. I mean, you ha -- because we might have had a Russian housekeeper, so I would have\noccasion to speak Russian to her. I would have occasion maybe to hear Russian spoken in the\nhouse while my mother may be speaking to somebody Russian. How my mother used to love to\nread books, and wa -- a lot of the books were in Russian.",
        "Q: Now, how come your mother spoke Russian?",
        "A: Because my mother was born in the former Soviet Union.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And so she spoke Russian.",
        "Q: Did your father understand Russian as well?",
        "A: Yes. Ye -- most of -- most of the people in Europe speak a number of languages. As a matter\nof fact, besides Russian, I even spoke Polish. But it\u2019s not unusual for the Europeans to speak a\nnumber of languages. I recall when I came to the United States at -- at the age 16, well, I spoke\nYiddish, I spoke Hebrew, I spoke Russian, German, Lithuanian, studied Latin and failed. But --",
        "Q: You studied Lithuanian and failed also.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: But you still could speak it some?",
        "A: Yes. Actually, the reason I failed Lithuanian is because I didn't memorize a poem.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And the funniest part is, during the oral examination, they ask me to recite that poem, well I\ndidn't remember. But now, what 1s it, 70 years later, I remember the poem.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. As a matter of fact, I can recite part of it. [recites poem in Lithuanian]. So that was one\nof the poems which I failed when I was tested orally.",
        "Q: So how come you remember it now?",
        "A: Because it left such an impression on me.",
        "Q: What is the poem about?",
        "A: This is the king of Lithuania calling his army together. And he tells them about the sounds of\nfire, and [indecipherable] and th -- and they should [indecipherable] themselves for battle.",
        "Q: How many poems did you have to learn, that you failed? I hate to mention --",
        "A: Well, thi -- this is the one I failed.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And a -- but I don\u2019t remember how many others you had to memorize.",
        "Q: You mean only one poem and you failed?",
        "A: One full poem, I must have failed in my written test as well, I -- I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that any more. Whatever it is, it was a lucky --",
        "Q: Oh yes.",
        "A: -- event in my life that I failed --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- Lithuanian.",
        "Q: I understand you -- you must have had a number of friends because you played soccer and\nyou were playing around.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you have one special friend?",
        "A: Well, as a matter of fact, one of my close friends, we went to school together in Lithuania,\ncame to the United States in 1939. And we have remained good friends since, always, and he\nlives in Boston, and he has a place in Palm Beach, so during the winter we always have an\nopportunity to get together and reminisce about the past.",
        "Q: Right. And what\u2019s his name?",
        "A: His name is Sam Sheldon, S-h-e-l-d-o-n.",
        "Q: But that wasn\u2019t his name then.",
        "A: No, it was Shmukla.",
        "Q: Shmukla.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism when you were living in Lithuania?",
        "A: Oh yes. There were always fights between some of the Lithuanian boys and the Jewish boys.\nHowever, since we associated mostly with our own, we have not experienced that much anti-\nSemitism, so to say.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. When -- when you are 13, Hitler takes over in Germany.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Do you discuss this, do you hear people talking about what it means?",
        "A: Oh yes, we discussed it, we ma -- heard -- we listened to the radio, we listened to his\npronouncements. And we were concerned about it, but not really concerned enough so that you\nwould want to run away. Nobody really imagined that the Holocaust would take place.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And besides, my father was very -- he had a successful -- 1n business, and was dealing with\nthe Lithuanian government and he thought, probably at the time that nothing terrible is going to\nhappen to him because they need him. The -- the country wouldn\u2019t function without him.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t have to tell you that after the war broke out, the Russians came in to Lithuania.\nThey confiscated my bu -- my father\u2019s business, his accounts, his warehouses, and in addition\nthey told him that he owes them taxes for prior years. And I recall receiving a letter from my\nparents that they need some money to pay for taxes, otherwise I presume they would go to jail or\nwhatever. And so they requested that I pay, I think it\u2019s -- probably was like 2000 dollars to an\nindividual in the United States, and he would arrange with his connections [indecipherable |\nfamily whatever, to pay them in rubles or whatever, so that it would settle with the government.",
        "Q: And you had this money? Or was this from your uncle?",
        "A: I borrowed the money from my uncle.",
        "Q: From your uncle. Let -- let me go back a little bit. You leave Lithuania in 1936.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And how do you leave? Where -- where do you leave from?",
        "A: I leave from Poinyavich. From Poinyavich we went to Kovno by train. And in Kovno we left\nby a direct express train tha -- to Paris.",
        "Q: To Paris. Now when you say we, who is we?",
        "A: Good question. There was a distant relative, my aunt\u2019s husband\u2019s brother, who was visiting\nhis parents, and he was going back to America, and so they -- my parents arranged that we would\ntravel together.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So we went, the two of us, to Paris, and the reason we went to Paris is because my mother\u2019s\nsister lived in Paris. And so we stayed in Paris for about a week, or thereabouts.",
        "Q: Was that the first time you were in Paris?",
        "A: Yes. The first time I was in Paris, that was in 1936, and then we went to Le Havre where we\ntook a ship called the Paris, to the United States. And it may sound unreal, but I traveled first\nclass.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. And now you wonder, how did I travel first class?",
        "Q: Okay, how did you?",
        "A: Well, there was a depression, right?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And so there weren\u2019t too many people that could afford to go first class. So the first class\ncabins were sort of empty, and the ship decided to put a number of us in a first class cabin,\nmaybe like six or eight of us. And so I came to the United States --",
        "Q: First class.",
        "A: -- first class.",
        "Q: Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty?",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty?",
        "A: The Statue of Liberty, yes, I remember s-seeing the Statue of Liberty because we landed in\nNew York.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So we bypassed the Statue of Liberty and we landed, I guess it was either in the 40\u2019s or the\n50\u2019s on the West Side. And there was my two uncles in the pier, meeting me.",
        "Q: Wait a minute, two uncles?",
        "A: Two.",
        "Q: You had -- two brothers of your --",
        "A: [had -- two brothers.",
        "Q: -- of your mother?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The uncle that brought me over --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and his younger brother.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so I came and I stayed for the first week or two with my uncle, and --",
        "Q: And his name?",
        "A: His name was Aleck Leitman, A-l-e-c-k, and his last name was Leitman, L-e-1-t-m-a-n. And\nhe was rather successful. He had a wholesale army and navy store and he was buying surplus\nequipment from the government and refurbishing it and selling it in his store in New York. And\nso I stayed with my uncle, who had a very nice apartment on 82\" Street and Riverside Drive.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: And my -- he had a -- he had a very American wife, who made sure that you mind your\nmanners at the dining room table. And --",
        "Q: Were you not used to that?",
        "A: Well, not the way she expected to.",
        "Q: Was she -- she was tough?",
        "A: She was tough.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I mean, you\u2019d pick up the fork the right way, you transferred the -- the knife the right way, it -\n- you know, by the time you got finished you didn\u2019t enjoy the dinner so much.",
        "Q: So you had to eat the way an American would, not the way the Europeans would, you --",
        "A: Right, exactly.",
        "Q: -- so you had to switch --",
        "A: Exactly, switch the hi -- yes.",
        "Q: -- the knife and the fork, yes? Tell me something, was it very difficult for you to leave? Even\nthough you said it was not going to necessarily be forever, how difficult was that for you?",
        "A: It -- all I can tell you is, when I got on the train in Kovno, I cried all my way --",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: -- to Paris, practically. I remember how scared I was when we crossed the German border and\nwe had to get off the train and they showed them our passports, and our money and whatever,\nand how they screamed at us, and how they treated us, and I couldn\u2019t wait to get back on the\ntrain. We then stopped -- the train stopped in Berlin I remember, and we had breakfast at the\nrailroad station in Berlin. And again, I couldn\u2019t wait to get back on the train and to continue our\njourney to Paris.",
        "Q: And what do you think you were afraid of then?",
        "A: Well, because we were ce-certainly aware of the Gestapo in those days. We were aware of the\n-- the German solution. Nobody believed it, but we knew what it proclaimed.",
        "Q: Do you think your unc -- did you talk about this with your uncle? Was he as afraid as y -- as\nyou were, do you think?",
        "A: Well, my uncle was in America.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I was in Lithuania.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So [really had no occasion to talk to my uncle about it.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have a common language between the two of you?",
        "A: Well, my uncle and I spoke Yiddish.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So we could converse. As a matter of fact, I was very close to my uncle and my uncle was\nvery, very good to me. And because my uncle was spending so much time with me that his wife\nresented it. And one day she told me that her sister from Baltimore is coming and that she needs\nthe room, and that I will have to find another place to live.",
        "Q: You were 16 - 17?",
        "A: 16 years old. And so I had to find another place to live, so the first thing we did 1s I went to\nthe 92\u2122 Street Y. And they didn\u2019t have any rooms available at the time, so they suggested that\nthere is a family that\u2019s looking for a border, and they have a room, and we went to see them, and\nwe arranged to -- that I would stay with them in their -- in that room, and three meals a day, and\nmy uncle was paying 40 dollars a month for that room and board. And in addition he gave me an\nallowance of three and a half dollars a week, which I had to use for subway fare, lunches,\npersonal things and whatever. But you know what? We managed.",
        "Q: You did. But that must have been very tough on you because you hadn\u2019t been here that long.",
        "A: It was very tough, as a matter of fact, I -- I would -- when I went into the subway I was\noverwhelmed because of all the trains, express, local, uptown, downtown, and I would go from\nmy ru -- from my place where I lived, to school. I was enrolled in a high school in New York, at\nthe Seward Park High School, which was on the east side. And the reason I was enrolled in that\nschool is because my uncle\u2019s bookkeeper had a sister that was teaching in that school, so my\nuncle said to his bookkeeper, you got to enroll him in school so she enrolled me in the school\nwhere her sister was teaching. So that was Seward Park High School.",
        "Q: But did you speak English?",
        "A: Did I speak English? No, I did not spe -- I -- I ne -- knew a few words --",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t speak English. So it was very difficult and very scary, but you go through it.",
        "Q: Were you lonely?",
        "A: I was very lonely. As a matter of fact, I must tell you, there was a time that I was considering\ngoing back to Lithuania. But I didn't go back because I would have been admitting that I\u2019m a\nfailure again. Here I am in the United States where the streets are lined with gold, and I am the\nfelda that had to come back to Lithuania. So, is -- no matter how difficult 1t was, you -- you have\nto continue.",
        "Q: So when did you graduate?",
        "A: I graduated at the age of 18. When I went to school they gave me credit for a number of the\ncourses which I took in Lithuania, and which I didn\u2019t have to repeat here, like math and sciences,\nwhich I excelled in.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And so I had to concentrate primarily on English and American history and so forth. So the\nfirst term, for instance, I would take English one and two, the second term I took English three\nand four. The second year I took English five and six, and the final year -- final term, I took\nEnglish seven, I skipped eight.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. And I got an 85, I think on the --",
        "Q: On the regents?",
        "A: On the regents.",
        "Q: No Lithuanian, right? No Latin.",
        "A: No Lithuanian, I didn\u2019t have to study Lithuanian.",
        "Q: Right. Did they draft you when you turned 18?",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Did the American government draft you?",
        "A: Yes, I went into service in 1942.",
        "Q: 1942. So what did you do between \u201938 --",
        "A: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait -- not 1942, it was actually 1944.",
        "Q: Okay, so for a good part of the war --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- your parents and your brother and all your relatives, or most of them were in Lithuania.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: You\u2019re writing to each other.",
        "A: Soon as the war broke out --",
        "Q: They -- there\u2019s not --",
        "A: -- the mail stopped.",
        "Q: So this 1 -- are you talking about 1941, or you talking about -- between 1939 and --",
        "A: I\u2019m -- be -- be -- between \u201941 --",
        "Q: Right, and \u201944, there\u2019s nothing.",
        "A: -- and \u201944, no communication.",
        "Q: Right. But between 1939 and 1941, you are able to write, when they\u2019re under the Russians?",
        "A: I think so. I think so.",
        "Q: So this must have been very scary for you. I mean, you don\u2019t even have contact now.",
        "A: That is true, but neither did anybody else.",
        "Q: Yeah, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily help you.",
        "A: No, it doesn\u2019t help you.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But you had to face the times.",
        "Q: Right. Now are you seeing your uncle? Does your aunt relent a little bit so you get to see --",
        "A: Oh, I ca -- I was 1n business with my uncle.",
        "Q: Oh, so explain.",
        "A: Yes, I -- as a matter of fact, I continued to work for my uncle, and -- in his business, and as a\nmatter of fact, I think in 1940 he made me a partner in that -- in the business.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. He gave me a 25 percent interest in the business, and --",
        "Q: And you\u2019re 20 years old?",
        "A: 20 years old. At that time I lived already at the 92\u2122 Street Y, because by that time I was able\nto get a room at the 92\" -- second Street Y. And I was relatively happy because I had an\nopportunity to associate with a lot of young men my age, and we were exposed at the Y to the\narts.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We had -- were able to attend concerts, performances by famous violinists and pianists and\nwhatever. And it was a fairly nice life. As a matter of fact, in 1941, I bought my first car.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What\u2019d you buy?",
        "A: I bought a Chrysler fluid drive., a bu -- brand new Chrysler fluid drive. Why did I buy a\nChrysler fluid drive? Because I never drove a car with a shift. And the -- and the Chrysler fluid\ndrive didn\u2019t require shifting, you just put it in gear once and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Had you driven before? Anything?",
        "A: Actually, when I bought the car, I didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license. Never -- but I had somebody\nwho was working for my uncle drive with me and I took some driving lessons and I -- I must\nadmit another failure. I failed the driving test the first time.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I had to take it a second time, which I passed. It was really funny, you get -- you have a car\nand you don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: Where did you keep the car?",
        "A: Ina garage next to the 92\" Street Y. As a matter of fact, you know Mr. Haberman who writes\na column in the New York Times?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He interviewed me at the time, and he said, well how much rent did you pay at the Y? I said\nfive dollars a week. And where did you garage the car? I said down the street. And how much\ndid you pay for the garage? And I said 25 dollars a month. He says, you paid five dollars a week\nfor a room, 25 dollars a month for garaging your car? But, as a matter of fact, I then moved to a\nresidential hotel on the west side, I think it was on 84\" Street, between Amsterdam -- no, near\nthe Riverside Drive. And that was -- I had beautiful accommodations, yeah. It was a studio with\na kitchenette which was closed in with doors. Beautiful furniture. Had a restaurant in the buil --\nin the building, and had an indoor swimming pool.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: So by that time I was already rich.",
        "Q: Yeah. What were you doing as a partner? What was your role?",
        "A: Well, at that time we were engaged in manufacturing for the government.",
        "Q: For the what?",
        "A: For the United States government.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And it was my job to, when we got requests from the government to bid on certain items, to\nbreak down the drawings and specifications and prepare a bill of materials, estimate the labor\nand then submit a bid to the government. So that was primarily my job, and because I was pretty\ngood in math and sciences, and [indecipherable] material and so forth, I was able to calculate and\nto price it out. And we were at a -- very successful in that business.",
        "Q: And what were you actually doing for the government once you --",
        "A: Well, we were making various items for the government. One of the first contracts -- I\nremember getting a big contract, was for helmet lines. It was an aluminum frame covered with\ncalfskin leather which would fit into the helmet. I remember making sleeping bags. That\u2019s a\nfunny story, Phyllis always tells me about it -- reminds me about it. I --",
        "Q: Well, you know something, let\u2019s -- let\u2019s go to the next tape, cause I have the feeling it\u2019s going\nto go on for a bit longer, so let\u2019s stop this tape.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll talk --",
        "A: Well, one of the f-first contracts that we got was to manufacture sleeping bags for the air\nforce. Now that sleeping bag was filled with down. I didn\u2019t even know what the word down was.\nAnd so I had to prepare a bid and calculate the cost of the materials, and I start calling around to\nfind out about the price of down, and where do you get that? Well, basically you had the Yellow\nPages, and you open up the Yellow Page, and you look f -- f -- under down for manufacturers on\ndown, and we had to utilize a hundred percent down. When I called the suppliers and I ask them\nfor hundred percent down, they said there is no such thing as hundred percent down. Hundred\npercent down contains probably 10 percent little feathers. Well, I said my specification calls for a\nhundred percent down, I can\u2019t use little feathers. Well, they said, you\u2019re not going to find\nanybody that makes hundred percent down, per se. And so anyhow, I was able to get a price on --\nbe so-called hundred percent down and we submitted a bid to the government and we got the\ncontract. And it was one of the first contracts where I got myself familiarized with the term\ndown. But there were many other contracts which we received at the time. We made bandoliers,\nwhere the soldiers kept their shells or whatever.",
        "Q: Is that like a belt?",
        "A: Yes. We made firemen\u2019s clothing from an aluminized asbestos cloth which would enable the\nfiremen to go in and rescue say, a pilot under 2,000 degree temperature. We made the helmet, we\nmade the gloves, we made the -- a jacket and trousers. We made parachute drop equipment. We\nmade targets, tow targets. So the tow targets were made, some were wound tow targets which\nwere made from cloth, and other tow targets were made from sort of a mesh material.",
        "Q: What\u2019s a tow target, what is that?",
        "A: Tow targets, well, in order for the pilots to practice --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- gunnery in a plane, they need a target --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to fire. So there is one plane that has attached to it, a target --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- which they towed behind the plane.",
        "Q: Oh, a tow tar -- I see.",
        "A: A tow target.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: And so that the other pilots or whatever, fighters, would aim their bullets into that particular\ntarget.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that when they fired the bullet in that target, it would leave a mark --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- in the tow target, so they would know which pilot, or whatever, registered on the target --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- and so forth. So we made tow targets. We made many things which the government needed\nat the time.",
        "Q: So were you a kind of middle person and contracted out, or did he have a factory that did all -",
        "A: We had a factory that made it all.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: We made it ourself.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: We were our own contractors. So we started with the raw material, and we sold the finished\nitem, and we had, you know, government inspectors at -- on the premises --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- at all times to make sure that we meet the government specifications.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that was another challenge because when you deal with the government, there is no right\nway, there is no wrong way, it\u2019s only the army way. And when they tell you you -- you s -- sew\nit with 10 stitches per inch, it better be 10 stitches per inch. Nine will not do, 11 will not do, it\nbetter be 10. And so that you had to follow explicitly the government specifications.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that was a challenge.",
        "Q: I bet. Now let me ask you something, cause it strikes me that you -- I don\u2019t know if you feel\nsomewhat schizophrenic in the United States when you\u2019re 20 and 21, but when the war happens,\nand your family is over there, and you\u2019re here relatively safe, that must be really hard for you.\nYou\u2019re reading newspapers, you\u2019re hearing the news on the radio.",
        "A: Well, you know, you hear the news and you never heard really of the atrocities which were\ncommitted.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: At least that is my recollection.",
        "Q: So during --",
        "A: We knew there was a problems, we knew it was difficult, but we never imagined that there\nwere concentration camps, we never imagined that there were gas chambers and whatever.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we -- I didn\u2019t know, for instance, that my mother was killed practically the day that the\nGermans marched into Lithuania.",

        "A: Oh, not only do I think, I know.",
        "Q: You know she was shot.",
        "A: What happened 1s that -- and it -- actually I\u2019m -- I\u2019m ashamed to say it, it was the Lithuanians\nthat gathered the entire population of this Jews of the city Poinyavich, marched them to the\nsuburbs, made them dig trenches and machine gunned the entire 7,000, men, women, children,\nthe whole thing. And what is so 1-interesting is that the Germans kept meticulous records of the\ndestruction of the Jewish people, and that episode of the killing of the Jews in Lithuania, appears\namong the papers --",
        "Q: Of the Germans.",
        "A: -- of the Germans.",
        "Q: And where is your father, and now your brother?",
        "A: My brother -- my mother the -- realized the situation in Poinyavich was rather hazardous, so\nshe sent my brother to Kovno to tell my father not to come back. So my brother went to Kovno\nto tell my father what the situation is, and that my mother said don\u2019t come back. And what\nhappened is that my brother, and my father, who were in Kovno, were placed in the Kovno\nghetto. And they stayed in the Kovno ghetto I think about a year and a half or two years. They\nwere then transferred to Dachau, and it was in Dachau that my father died, really from starvation,\nbecause whatever meager rations he received, he gave to my brother --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- so that he should survive.",
        "Q: And when do you find all this out, if during the war you don\u2019t know anything? Is it long after\nthe war, right after the war?",
        "A: Well, right after the war I remember seeing a list of survivors which was published by the\nAmerican Red Cross, and my father\u2019s name appeared there as being killed in Dachau, and it also\nappeared that my brother survived. And then I heard from other people, relatives and whatnot,\nthat my brother survived, and he is in Europe. It seems that my brother tried to get in touch with\nme, but he didn\u2019t have the right address because since that -- since he had the address when I left\nhome, we moved and so forth. And I never received any mail from him. And he was in -- I guess\nin a camp, and --",
        "Q: You mean when he was in the DP camp afterwards, yes.",
        "A: In -- yes, right. S-So my brother wasn\u2019t exactly sure what happened to my mother. So he went\nback to Poinyavich to look for my mother. And, you know, at that time the former Soviet Union\nwas in charge of Lithuania, the Iron Curtain came down, so you were able to get into Lithuania,\nbut you couldn\u2019t get out.",
        "Q: So he\u2019s stuck.",
        "A: Stuck. By the time I was able to establish contact with my brother, he was married, he had a\nchild, a wife, in-laws, and it was not feasible to smuggle him out from Lithuania.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So that --",
        "Q: So what year is this when you -- when you s --",
        "A: That was -- well, the end of the war was 1945, and he got married at the end of \u201945. I think the\nchild was born in \u201946, so -- and I was not able to communicate with my brother directly, so it\nseems that all the letters which I sent to him, and the return address which he sent to me, went\nthrough a third party. He was afraid that if the Russians find out that he has a brother in the\nUnited States, a capitalist, whatever, that he will lose his job because at one point he had a very\ngood job in Poinyavich right after the war, but then somebody said, you know, his father was a\ncapitalist and he has a brother capitalist and so he got fired, because his brother is a capitalist and\nhis father was a capitalist. So he was afraid to disclose that he has a brother in the United States.\nHowever, in subsequent years, I sent him packages. Again, not directly to him, but through a\nthird party, and he would be able to barter the packages for either food, or for whatever else, or\nsell it, and that has enabled him to live a better life than otherwise. So with the help of the\npackages which I sent him regularly for many years, he subsequently is a very capable man,\nspoke Lithuanian fluently, spoke Russian fluently, spoke Yiddish fluently, all these things which\nI couldn\u2019t do, he was able to do very well. And so he got a -- a very significant job with the\nRussian government and he was in charge of food distribution for the -- for Wilna and it\u2019s\nsurrounding. Well, that was a very big job because with food you cou -- in those days, you could\ntrade and help people in many ways. The story goes, supposedly, I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s true\nor not, but when the president of Lithuania, the prime minister had a birthday party and he\nneeded vodka or food or whatever, he had to get permission from my brother to get these\nsupplies. So he had a fairly good job, and then he was in charge also of their hotels which --\nwhich were built to cater to foreign dignitaries. So that he had occasion to go to all the Russian --\nto Czechoslovakia, to some of the other Russian countries, whatever, and learn how to run a -- an\nouts -- what I would call a hotel that caters to dignitaries. And he had a fairly good life. The first\ntime I actually met -- saw my brother since I left home in 1936 was in 1988. That\u2019s 52 years\nlater. And I met my brother in Israel. It seems that a Maccabee team from Lithuania came to\nIsrael to participate in the games and my brother was very much involved with the soccer team in\nLithuania, and so he came, he got permission to travel with the team to Israel for the soccer\ngames. And that is the first time that I met -- I saw my brother after 52 years.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: It was very difficult to say the leas -- the least, but you know, he -- he is a very outgoing\nperson, very -- very able, and he -- if I say so myself, he adored me, because I am his source of\nsurvival. And I finally convinced him in 1988 to move to Israel, because he had such a good job\nin Lithuania. He had a car, he had a dacha, he had computers, he had everything. And here he has\nto give it all up and move to Israel where his children don\u2019t speak the language, where -- well, he\nspoke some Hebrew because he went to a Hebrew high school, but it\u2019s starting a whole new life.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So [had to promise him that I will get him a condominium for him, a condominium for his\ndaughter, for his son. I will get them cars, and I will make sure that they will be able to live in\nrelative comfort in Israel. And it was only after these promises that he has agreed to move to\nIsrael. So in 1989, I think, he moved to Israel.",
        "Q: Did you want him to move to the United States?",
        "A: Really, I don\u2019t think he would have been as happy in the United States as he was in Israel.\nFirst of all, there was a big migration of Soviet Jews to Israel. So a lot of his friends came --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to Israel. It would have been a -- much more difficult for him and for his family to\nacclimate to a life in the United States.",
        "Q: And they were allowed to leave in 89?",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "Q: They were allowed to leave Lithuania?",
        "A: To leave Lithuania, yes.",
        "Q: That was okay?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Well, what is this like? You left, you were 16, he was 10, and when you see him, he\u2019s in his\n60\u2019s, yes?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: And it -- it\u2019s a --",
        "A: -- y-you\u2019re right.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a huge --",
        "A: It -- it -- it\u2019s a huge -- you know, I sometimes wonder, really what do we have in common?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And what we have in common is basically our parents and our Jewish tradition, and my\nresponsibility since my father was killed, that I had to take over and provide for the family. But\nwe didn\u2019t have this close relationship that normally brothers have.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We lived in different worlds. I lived in the United States, and he lived in Russia. We were\nboth very comfortable, he in Russia and I in the United States.",
        "Q: Right. But he also was in the ghetto, which had to have been a very difficult experience with -\n- with your father. Did he talk about that with you at all?",
        "A: Well, actually he never really wanted to discuss his life in the ghetto, or his life in Dachau. He\ndid tell me about Dachau that when the Americans were nearing Dachau that the Germans\ndecided to vacate the camp, and they decided to march them east. And he tells me the story that\nwhile they were marching in the -- through the woods, and his feet, he -- were bleeding, he was\nexhausted, and he tells me that he couldn\u2019t take it any more and he and a friend of his decided to\nfall to the ground, and whatever it is, it is. And he tells me the story about this German soldier\nthat came across him and said to his friend, don\u2019t waste a bullet on him, he is dead. And so they\npassed by and he then wi -- with his friend, ran to find food or shelter, or whatever. And they\ncame across a farm and when they knocked on the door, the Germans were frightened obviously\nand they said wa -- all we want is some food and -- and some water, whatever. And the Germans\nsaid, we don\u2019t have any food, but the American army is across on that river, and if you cross that\nbridge, y-you\u2019ll find the American army and they will be able to help you. And you better hurry\nup because the bridge 1s going to be blown up. So with whatever strength he and his friend had,\nthey ran across the river and no sooner did they get to the other side of the river, the bridge blew\nup. But by that time they were on the side where the Americans were, and so they received food,\nshelter and so forth from the American army.",
        "Q: But that\u2019s all he was [indecipherable]",
        "A: That\u2019s all he -- but he wouldn\u2019t have -- he wouldn\u2019t tell me about the -- his experiences in\nDachau, about the killings in Dachau. You know, he didn\u2019t a -- and he didn\u2019t discuss -- he\ndoesn\u2019t discuss much about his life in the ghetto, either. Although, I understand from some\ncousins of mine that when he was in the ghetto, my father arranged for him to get married in the\nghetto. And he must have been then -- what wa -- 16 - 17, and that his wife was taken away, and\n-- from the ghetto or whatever, and he never saw her again.",
        "Q: And -- but he didn\u2019t tell you this. It was other people.",
        "A: He didn't -- he didn\u2019t tell me that, because I don\u2019t think his current wife knows about it, that\nhe was married.",
        "Q: I see. And is -- was his current wife a Lithuanian Gentile, or was she Jewish?",
        "A: No, she a Jewish girl.",
        "Q: She\u2019s a Jewish girl.",
        "A: It\u2019s when he went back to Lithuania, to Poinyavich to look for my mother, he came across\nthat Jewish family, they took him in. They had a daughter, they got married and before you knew\nthere was a baby. And the other -- the only other thing he tells me is that he was able to reclaim\nmy father\u2019s home. And he then sold the house, which belonged to my father, and no sooner did\nhe sell the house that that money became devalued. That he told me.",
        "Q: Right. Tell me something. What -- if you can answer this question, what sort of effect does\nthis history have on you, the fact that your mother was murdered and your father got killed.",
        "A: Well, it had -- it -- obviously it\u2019s a very central part of my life. This is why I am so committed\nto Israel. This is why I am committed to the importance of the state of Israel, because it\u2019s my\nview that if we had an Israel at the time, we had a place that would have admitted Jews, maybe\nmy parents could have been saved, and my parents wou -- with not only my parents, with my\ngrandparents, my uncles, my cousins, everybody else that was killed by the Lithuanians in 1941.\nSo I have done a number of things to memorialize it. One of the things which I always hoped,\nthat I would be able to bring my parents over, and to give them the type -- the kind of lifestyle\nthat they gave me when I was a kid. And obviously that was not to be. So I got involved in\nbuilding a geriatric center. And I felt, while I may not be able to take care of my parents, I will\nbe able to take care of other parents, who will be able to finish their years in a home where they\ncould -- are surrounded by their own people, and they would spend the rest of their life in\ndignity, and -- so we build this communities -- this geriatric center, which is called the Gurwin\nJewish geriatric center. It\u2019s in Commack, Long Island, and it 1s an -- if I say so myself, an\noutstanding geriatric center. It has 460 beds, it has another 120 daycare patients, and it has\napartments with assisted living for 200 units. And so I have devoted a lot of time, effort and\nenergy to build this geriatric center, and to maintain it in a style which would be a credit to the\nJewish community.",

        "Q: Okay. You were continuing to talk about the -- the ways in which you have been affected by\nthe Holocaust and what you\u2019ve done because of it.",
        "A: Well, because of that, I have been a leader in the UJA Federation of New York. I was\nchairman of the board for three, four years, and -- think it was between 1987 and 1990. I am very\nsupportive of all Jewish causes. I have sent up two satellites called Gurwin one and two. They\nwere built in Israel, they were designed by Technion, built by Israel aircraft industry and they\nwere launched on a Russian missile from Kazakhstan.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. The first satellite went kaput.",

        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And -- and so I said it was not the fault of Technion, it was the fault of the Russian missile, so\nwe're going to build a second one. So we have a second satellite, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Gurwin\ntwo, and it is still circling --",
        "Q: Really?",

        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: So that was one of the things which I did. I am on the board of Technion and I\u2019m also on the\nboard of the Weizmann Institute of Science. And I am very supportive of both institutions. I have\nreceived a doctorate from Technion and I\u2019m getting a PhD. from the Weizmann Institute in\nNovember.",

I have been\ninvolved with the Magen [indecipherable] where we contributed, Phyllis and I, to ambulances\nwhich bear our name.

And I was\ninvolved with my father in analyzing the flax seed, because flax seed is sold based upon the\npercentage of good seeds, less any defective ones or less any other things which got into the --\nthe seeds. So that you would have to analyze it and determine what percentage is flax seed. And\nyou would have to weigh them, and you would have to pick out all the defective ones.

        "A: I loved math, I loved science. I -- I loved history. The subjects that I didn\u2019t like were\nlanguages.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes. Right, and I had to study Latin and I had to study Lithuanian and German, and\nfortunately for me, I failed Lithuanian and Latin.",
        "A: Failed.",
        "A: It was a failure.",
        "A: And I failed Lithuanian and Latin because basically Latin, you have to spend a lot of time\nstudying and memorizing. And I used to play a lot of soccer with my friends and studying\nlanguages was not exactly my forte. So as a result, I failed Lithuanian and Latin. And people\nwould ask me, well how could you fail Lithuanian when you lived in Lithuania? I said, it\u2019s very\nsimple. To me Lithuanian was like a foreign language because at home we spoke Yiddish.",
        "A: In school we spoke Hebrew.",
        "A: The only time I would have occasion to speak Lithuanian, if I went to some kind of\ngovernment office, whether it\u2019s a bank, or a post office. But otherwise I really didn\u2019t have much\noccasion to speak Lithuanian, so Lithuanian was like another foreign language.",
        "A: All the kids that I associated with attended the Hebrew gymnasium, which I did.",
        "A: Either Hebrew or Yiddish.",
        "A: Oh, soccer I liked a lot.",
        "A: Practically.",
        "A: Yes, I was on the Maccabee team.",
        "A: And as a matter of fact I remember traveling to Kovno and some other cities, where we\nplayed soccer against they -- their teams.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: A very big deal, I been watching it.",
        "A: I enjoyed it very much.",
        "A: I sometimes feel when I\u2019m watching it like I\u2019m ready to push or pull or run.",
        "A: Latin.",
        "A: Yes. As a result of my failure of Lithuanian and Latin, I was left back in grade for a whole\nyear.",
        "A: It was -- I was then probably 13.",
        "A: So it must have been like sixth grade, and as a result I went to school with kids that were a\nyear younger than I was. Well, the disgrace, the humiliation of going to school with kids who are\na year younger than you are, was so devastating that I wanted to run away from home. But when\nyou're 16 years old, where you going to run? So I remembered that a couple years prior to that,\nmy mother\u2019s brother, my uncle, visited his family, and he came from New York, and he stayed in\nmy mother\u2019s apartment. And when he saw the housekeeper bring to my bed in the morning and\nin the evening, warm milk and cookies, he said to my mother, you are ruining that boy, he\u2019II\nnever amount to anything. You better send him with me to u -- to the United States. So now that\nI wanted to run away from home because of the humiliation of being left back 1n school, what do\nI do? I write my uncle. Now, I didn\u2019t think at the time that I would be able to get a visa as\nquickly as I did, but my uncle got busy and prepared the necessary affidavits, and he send them\nthrough HIAS to Kovno, and one day I got a call from HIAS Kovno that they received the\naffidavits and the papers, and that the American counsel would like to see me. Well, I went to\nKovno to meet the American counsel. And as you recall there was a depression in the United\nStates in 1936 and the American counsel had like 17 visas to grant for the whole country. But\nwhen he saw my application, he figured I am not going to be a burden on the state because I have\nan uncle who 1s going to take care of me, I\u2019m not going to take anybody else\u2019s job. So he grants\nme the visa immediately. Now frankly, I wasn\u2019t ready to go that soon. But having put my uncle\nto all the trouble of preparing all the necessary affidavits and -- and all my friends knew that I\nhad wa -- a visa to the United State. It is -- 1t wasn't feasible for me to back out at that particular\npoint in time. So I came to the United States and fortunately, I survived. If I had not failed\nLithuanian and Latin, and if I didn\u2019t run away from Lithuania, I might have been one of the six\nmillion.",
        "A: And that\u2019s why I said to you I was very lucky that I failed Lithuanian and Latin.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, my mother was supportive.",
        "A: Because it was her brother.",
        "A: My father wasn\u2019t exactly enamored with the idea, but my father was a businessman who\ntraveled a lot, and he -- his attitude was, you go, you don\u2019t like it, you come back. We\u2019Il come to\nvisit you, whatever. So it was not like a [indecipherable] thing.",
        "A: It was like, you go to take advantage of the situation.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He is six years younger than I am.",
        "A: Six.",
        "A: Difference.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: We to -- the difference was so big, and I had my own friends and he had his own friends. So\nthat we were together, but -- and we would go away on vacations together, but because of the\ndifference in age, I gravitated to my age group and he did --",
        "A: -- to his age group.",
        "A: Well, I must admit that I went on my vacations to a place called Palangin, which is on the\nBaltic Sea. It\u2019s a beautiful resort, and we would stay in what they used to call in those days, a\npensionne, which means you would get a room and you would get three meals a day. And so my\npa -- in some years my parents rented a house in Palangin, and so we stayed in the house and\nbrought a housekeeper and so forth and so on.",
        "A: I loved it there.",
        "A: Well, it -- it was going to the beach every day.",
        "A: It was in the -- it had magnificent trees adjoining the beach, pine trees, which is very unusual.\nAnd the path was lined with pine needles. And in the afternoon at four o\u2019clock there would be an\norchestra playing in the park. It was a very nice life. As a matter of fact there were, just before I\ncame to the United States, I spent my last summer in Palangin.",
        "A: With my family.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, because my nurse was Russian, and so probably the first language that I have learned\nwas Russian and Yiddish. Russian from the nurse and Yiddish from my parents.",
        "A: I still speak Russian. I can understand Russian and can my -- can make myself understood in\nRussian. I-I don\u2019t speak a perfect Russian, but I manage to speak.",
        "A: Yes. I mean, you ha -- because we might have had a Russian housekeeper, so I would have\noccasion to speak Russian to her. I would have occasion maybe to hear Russian spoken in the\nhouse while my mother may be speaking to somebody Russian. How my mother used to love to\nread books, and wa -- a lot of the books were in Russian.",
        "A: Because my mother was born in the former Soviet Union.",
        "A: And so she spoke Russian.",
        "A: Yes. Ye -- most of -- most of the people in Europe speak a number of languages. As a matter\nof fact, besides Russian, I even spoke Polish. But it\u2019s not unusual for the Europeans to speak a\nnumber of languages. I recall when I came to the United States at -- at the age 16, well, I spoke\nYiddish, I spoke Hebrew, I spoke Russian, German, Lithuanian, studied Latin and failed. But --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yes. Actually, the reason I failed Lithuanian is because I didn't memorize a poem.",
        "A: And the funniest part is, during the oral examination, they ask me to recite that poem, well I\ndidn't remember. But now, what 1s it, 70 years later, I remember the poem.",
        "A: Yes. As a matter of fact, I can recite part of it. [recites poem in Lithuanian]. So that was one\nof the poems which I failed when I was tested orally.",
        "A: Because it left such an impression on me.",
        "A: This is the king of Lithuania calling his army together. And he tells them about the sounds of\nfire, and [indecipherable] and th -- and they should [indecipherable] themselves for battle.",
        "A: Well, thi -- this is the one I failed.",
        "A: And a -- but I don\u2019t remember how many others you had to memorize.",
        "A: One full poem, I must have failed in my written test as well, I -- I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that any more. Whatever it is, it was a lucky --",
        "A: -- event in my life that I failed --",
        "A: -- Lithuanian.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, as a matter of fact, one of my close friends, we went to school together in Lithuania,\ncame to the United States in 1939. And we have remained good friends since, always, and he\nlives in Boston, and he has a place in Palm Beach, so during the winter we always have an\nopportunity to get together and reminisce about the past.",
        "A: His name is Sam Sheldon, S-h-e-l-d-o-n.",
        "A: No, it was Shmukla.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes. There were always fights between some of the Lithuanian boys and the Jewish boys.\nHowever, since we associated mostly with our own, we have not experienced that much anti-\nSemitism, so to say.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh yes, we discussed it, we ma -- heard -- we listened to the radio, we listened to his\npronouncements. And we were concerned about it, but not really concerned enough so that you\nwould want to run away. Nobody really imagined that the Holocaust would take place.",
        "A: And besides, my father was very -- he had a successful -- 1n business, and was dealing with\nthe Lithuanian government and he thought, probably at the time that nothing terrible is going to\nhappen to him because they need him. The -- the country wouldn\u2019t function without him.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t have to tell you that after the war broke out, the Russians came in to Lithuania.\nThey confiscated my bu -- my father\u2019s business, his accounts, his warehouses, and in addition\nthey told him that he owes them taxes for prior years. And I recall receiving a letter from my\nparents that they need some money to pay for taxes, otherwise I presume they would go to jail or\nwhatever. And so they requested that I pay, I think it\u2019s -- probably was like 2000 dollars to an\nindividual in the United States, and he would arrange with his connections [indecipherable |\nfamily whatever, to pay them in rubles or whatever, so that it would settle with the government.",
        "A: I borrowed the money from my uncle.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I leave from Poinyavich. From Poinyavich we went to Kovno by train. And in Kovno we left\nby a direct express train tha -- to Paris.",
        "A: Good question. There was a distant relative, my aunt\u2019s husband\u2019s brother, who was visiting\nhis parents, and he was going back to America, and so they -- my parents arranged that we would\ntravel together.",
        "A: So we went, the two of us, to Paris, and the reason we went to Paris is because my mother\u2019s\nsister lived in Paris. And so we stayed in Paris for about a week, or thereabouts.",
        "A: Yes. The first time I was in Paris, that was in 1936, and then we went to Le Havre where we\ntook a ship called the Paris, to the United States. And it may sound unreal, but I traveled first\nclass.",
        "A: Yes. And now you wonder, how did I travel first class?",
        "A: Well, there was a depression, right?",
        "A: And so there weren\u2019t too many people that could afford to go first class. So the first class\ncabins were sort of empty, and the ship decided to put a number of us in a first class cabin,\nmaybe like six or eight of us. And so I came to the United States --",
        "A: -- first class.",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "A: The Statue of Liberty, yes, I remember s-seeing the Statue of Liberty because we landed in\nNew York.",
        "A: So we bypassed the Statue of Liberty and we landed, I guess it was either in the 40\u2019s or the\n50\u2019s on the West Side. And there was my two uncles in the pier, meeting me.",
        "A: Two.",
        "A: [had -- two brothers.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The uncle that brought me over --",
        "A: -- and his younger brother.",
        "A: And so I came and I stayed for the first week or two with my uncle, and --",
        "A: His name was Aleck Leitman, A-l-e-c-k, and his last name was Leitman, L-e-1-t-m-a-n. And\nhe was rather successful. He had a wholesale army and navy store and he was buying surplus\nequipment from the government and refurbishing it and selling it in his store in New York. And\nso I stayed with my uncle, who had a very nice apartment on 82\" Street and Riverside Drive.",
        "A: And my -- he had a -- he had a very American wife, who made sure that you mind your\nmanners at the dining room table. And --",
        "A: Well, not the way she expected to.",
        "A: She was tough.",
        "A: I mean, you\u2019d pick up the fork the right way, you transferred the -- the knife the right way, it -\n- you know, by the time you got finished you didn\u2019t enjoy the dinner so much.",
        "A: Right, exactly.",
        "A: Exactly, switch the hi -- yes.",
        "A: It -- all I can tell you is, when I got on the train in Kovno, I cried all my way --",
        "A: -- to Paris, practically. I remember how scared I was when we crossed the German border and\nwe had to get off the train and they showed them our passports, and our money and whatever,\nand how they screamed at us, and how they treated us, and I couldn\u2019t wait to get back on the\ntrain. We then stopped -- the train stopped in Berlin I remember, and we had breakfast at the\nrailroad station in Berlin. And again, I couldn\u2019t wait to get back on the train and to continue our\njourney to Paris.",
        "A: Well, because we were ce-certainly aware of the Gestapo in those days. We were aware of the\n-- the German solution. Nobody believed it, but we knew what it proclaimed.",
        "A: Well, my uncle was in America.",
        "A: I was in Lithuania.",
        "A: So [really had no occasion to talk to my uncle about it.",
        "A: Well, my uncle and I spoke Yiddish.",
        "A: So we could converse. As a matter of fact, I was very close to my uncle and my uncle was\nvery, very good to me. And because my uncle was spending so much time with me that his wife\nresented it. And one day she told me that her sister from Baltimore is coming and that she needs\nthe room, and that I will have to find another place to live.",
        "A: 16 years old. And so I had to find another place to live, so the first thing we did 1s I went to\nthe 92\u2122 Street Y. And they didn\u2019t have any rooms available at the time, so they suggested that\nthere is a family that\u2019s looking for a border, and they have a room, and we went to see them, and\nwe arranged to -- that I would stay with them in their -- in that room, and three meals a day, and\nmy uncle was paying 40 dollars a month for that room and board. And in addition he gave me an\nallowance of three and a half dollars a week, which I had to use for subway fare, lunches,\npersonal things and whatever. But you know what? We managed.",
        "A: It was very tough, as a matter of fact, I -- I would -- when I went into the subway I was\noverwhelmed because of all the trains, express, local, uptown, downtown, and I would go from\nmy ru -- from my place where I lived, to school. I was enrolled in a high school in New York, at\nthe Seward Park High School, which was on the east side. And the reason I was enrolled in that\nschool is because my uncle\u2019s bookkeeper had a sister that was teaching in that school, so my\nuncle said to his bookkeeper, you got to enroll him in school so she enrolled me in the school\nwhere her sister was teaching. So that was Seward Park High School.",
        "A: Did I speak English? No, I did not spe -- I -- I ne -- knew a few words --",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t speak English. So it was very difficult and very scary, but you go through it.",
        "A: I was very lonely. As a matter of fact, I must tell you, there was a time that I was considering\ngoing back to Lithuania. But I didn't go back because I would have been admitting that I\u2019m a\nfailure again. Here I am in the United States where the streets are lined with gold, and I am the\nfelda that had to come back to Lithuania. So, is -- no matter how difficult 1t was, you -- you have\nto continue.",
        "A: I graduated at the age of 18. When I went to school they gave me credit for a number of the\ncourses which I took in Lithuania, and which I didn\u2019t have to repeat here, like math and sciences,\nwhich I excelled in.",
        "A: And so I had to concentrate primarily on English and American history and so forth. So the\nfirst term, for instance, I would take English one and two, the second term I took English three\nand four. The second year I took English five and six, and the final year -- final term, I took\nEnglish seven, I skipped eight.",
        "A: Yes. And I got an 85, I think on the --",
        "A: On the regents.",
        "A: No Lithuanian, I didn\u2019t have to study Lithuanian.",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "A: Yes, I went into service in 1942.",
        "A: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait -- not 1942, it was actually 1944.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Soon as the war broke out --",
        "A: -- the mail stopped.",
        "A: I\u2019m -- be -- be -- between \u201941 --",
        "A: -- and \u201944, no communication.",
        "A: I think so. I think so.",
        "A: That is true, but neither did anybody else.",
        "A: No, it doesn\u2019t help you.",
        "A: But you had to face the times.",
        "A: Oh, I ca -- I was 1n business with my uncle.",
        "A: Yes, I -- as a matter of fact, I continued to work for my uncle, and -- in his business, and as a\nmatter of fact, I think in 1940 he made me a partner in that -- in the business.",
        "A: Yes. He gave me a 25 percent interest in the business, and --",
        "A: 20 years old. At that time I lived already at the 92\u2122 Street Y, because by that time I was able\nto get a room at the 92\" -- second Street Y. And I was relatively happy because I had an\nopportunity to associate with a lot of young men my age, and we were exposed at the Y to the\narts.",
        "A: We had -- were able to attend concerts, performances by famous violinists and pianists and\nwhatever. And it was a fairly nice life. As a matter of fact, in 1941, I bought my first car.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I bought a Chrysler fluid drive., a bu -- brand new Chrysler fluid drive. Why did I buy a\nChrysler fluid drive? Because I never drove a car with a shift. And the -- and the Chrysler fluid\ndrive didn\u2019t require shifting, you just put it in gear once and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Actually, when I bought the car, I didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license. Never -- but I had somebody\nwho was working for my uncle drive with me and I took some driving lessons and I -- I must\nadmit another failure. I failed the driving test the first time.",
        "A: I had to take it a second time, which I passed. It was really funny, you get -- you have a car\nand you don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license.",
        "A: And --",
        "A: Ina garage next to the 92\" Street Y. As a matter of fact, you know Mr. Haberman who writes\na column in the New York Times?",
        "A: He interviewed me at the time, and he said, well how much rent did you pay at the Y? I said\nfive dollars a week. And where did you garage the car? I said down the street. And how much\ndid you pay for the garage? And I said 25 dollars a month. He says, you paid five dollars a week\nfor a room, 25 dollars a month for garaging your car? But, as a matter of fact, I then moved to a\nresidential hotel on the west side, I think it was on 84\" Street, between Amsterdam -- no, near\nthe Riverside Drive. And that was -- I had beautiful accommodations, yeah. It was a studio with\na kitchenette which was closed in with doors. Beautiful furniture. Had a restaurant in the buil --\nin the building, and had an indoor swimming pool.",
        "A: So by that time I was already rich.",
        "A: Well, at that time we were engaged in manufacturing for the government.",
        "A: For the United States government.",
        "A: And it was my job to, when we got requests from the government to bid on certain items, to\nbreak down the drawings and specifications and prepare a bill of materials, estimate the labor\nand then submit a bid to the government. So that was primarily my job, and because I was pretty\ngood in math and sciences, and [indecipherable] material and so forth, I was able to calculate and\nto price it out. And we were at a -- very successful in that business.",
        "A: Well, we were making various items for the government. One of the first contracts -- I\nremember getting a big contract, was for helmet lines. It was an aluminum frame covered with\ncalfskin leather which would fit into the helmet. I remember making sleeping bags. That\u2019s a\nfunny story, Phyllis always tells me about it -- reminds me about it. I --\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Well, one of the f-first contracts that we got was to manufacture sleeping bags for the air\nforce. Now that sleeping bag was filled with down. I didn\u2019t even know what the word down was.\nAnd so I had to prepare a bid and calculate the cost of the materials, and I start calling around to\nfind out about the price of down, and where do you get that? Well, basically you had the Yellow\nPages, and you open up the Yellow Page, and you look f -- f -- under down for manufacturers on\ndown, and we had to utilize a hundred percent down. When I called the suppliers and I ask them\nfor hundred percent down, they said there is no such thing as hundred percent down. Hundred\npercent down contains probably 10 percent little feathers. Well, I said my specification calls for a\nhundred percent down, I can\u2019t use little feathers. Well, they said, you\u2019re not going to find\nanybody that makes hundred percent down, per se. And so anyhow, I was able to get a price on --\nbe so-called hundred percent down and we submitted a bid to the government and we got the\ncontract. And it was one of the first contracts where I got myself familiarized with the term\ndown. But there were many other contracts which we received at the time. We made bandoliers,\nwhere the soldiers kept their shells or whatever.",
        "A: Yes. We made firemen\u2019s clothing from an aluminized asbestos cloth which would enable the\nfiremen to go in and rescue say, a pilot under 2,000 degree temperature. We made the helmet, we\nmade the gloves, we made the -- a jacket and trousers. We made parachute drop equipment. We\nmade targets, tow targets. So the tow targets were made, some were wound tow targets which\nwere made from cloth, and other tow targets were made from sort of a mesh material.",
        "A: Tow targets, well, in order for the pilots to practice --",
        "A: -- gunnery in a plane, they need a target --",
        "A: -- to fire. So there is one plane that has attached to it, a target --",
        "A: -- which they towed behind the plane.",
        "A: A tow target.",
        "A: And so that the other pilots or whatever, fighters, would aim their bullets into that particular\ntarget.",
        "A: And that when they fired the bullet in that target, it would leave a mark --",
        "A: -- in the tow target, so they would know which pilot, or whatever, registered on the target --",
        "A: -- and so forth. So we made tow targets. We made many things which the government needed\nat the time.",
        "A: We had a factory that made it all.",
        "A: We made it ourself.",
        "A: We were our own contractors. So we started with the raw material, and we sold the finished\nitem, and we had, you know, government inspectors at -- on the premises --",
        "A: -- at all times to make sure that we meet the government specifications.",
        "A: And that was another challenge because when you deal with the government, there is no right\nway, there is no wrong way, it\u2019s only the army way. And when they tell you you -- you s -- sew\nit with 10 stitches per inch, it better be 10 stitches per inch. Nine will not do, 11 will not do, it\nbetter be 10. And so that you had to follow explicitly the government specifications.",
        "A: And that was a challenge.",
        "A: Well, you know, you hear the news and you never heard really of the atrocities which were\ncommitted.",
        "A: At least that is my recollection.",
        "A: We knew there was a problems, we knew it was difficult, but we never imagined that there\nwere concentration camps, we never imagined that there were gas chambers and whatever.",
        "A: And we -- I didn\u2019t know, for instance, that my mother was killed practically the day that the\nGermans marched into Lithuania.",
        "A: Oh, not only do I think, I know.",
        "A: What happened 1s that -- and it -- actually I\u2019m -- I\u2019m ashamed to say it, it was the Lithuanians\nthat gathered the entire population of this Jews of the city Poinyavich, marched them to the\nsuburbs, made them dig trenches and machine gunned the entire 7,000, men, women, children,\nthe whole thing. And what is so 1-interesting is that the Germans kept meticulous records of the\ndestruction of the Jewish people, and that episode of the killing of the Jews in Lithuania, appears\namong the papers --",
        "A: -- of the Germans.",
        "A: My brother -- my mother the -- realized the situation in Poinyavich was rather hazardous, so\nshe sent my brother to Kovno to tell my father not to come back. So my brother went to Kovno\nto tell my father what the situation is, and that my mother said don\u2019t come back. And what\nhappened is that my brother, and my father, who were in Kovno, were placed in the Kovno\nghetto. And they stayed in the Kovno ghetto I think about a year and a half or two years. They\nwere then transferred to Dachau, and it was in Dachau that my father died, really from starvation,\nbecause whatever meager rations he received, he gave to my brother --",
        "A: -- so that he should survive.",
        "A: Well, right after the war I remember seeing a list of survivors which was published by the\nAmerican Red Cross, and my father\u2019s name appeared there as being killed in Dachau, and it also\nappeared that my brother survived. And then I heard from other people, relatives and whatnot,\nthat my brother survived, and he is in Europe. It seems that my brother tried to get in touch with\nme, but he didn\u2019t have the right address because since that -- since he had the address when I left\nhome, we moved and so forth. And I never received any mail from him. And he was in -- I guess\nin a camp, and --",
        "A: In -- yes, right. S-So my brother wasn\u2019t exactly sure what happened to my mother. So he went\nback to Poinyavich to look for my mother. And, you know, at that time the former Soviet Union\nwas in charge of Lithuania, the Iron Curtain came down, so you were able to get into Lithuania,\nbut you couldn\u2019t get out.",
        "A: Stuck. By the time I was able to establish contact with my brother, he was married, he had a\nchild, a wife, in-laws, and it was not feasible to smuggle him out from Lithuania.",
        "A: So that --",
        "A: That was -- well, the end of the war was 1945, and he got married at the end of \u201945. I think the\nchild was born in \u201946, so -- and I was not able to communicate with my brother directly, so it\nseems that all the letters which I sent to him, and the return address which he sent to me, went\nthrough a third party. He was afraid that if the Russians find out that he has a brother in the\nUnited States, a capitalist, whatever, that he will lose his job because at one point he had a very\ngood job in Poinyavich right after the war, but then somebody said, you know, his father was a\ncapitalist and he has a brother capitalist and so he got fired, because his brother is a capitalist and\nhis father was a capitalist. So he was afraid to disclose that he has a brother in the United States.\nHowever, in subsequent years, I sent him packages. Again, not directly to him, but through a\nthird party, and he would be able to barter the packages for either food, or for whatever else, or\nsell it, and that has enabled him to live a better life than otherwise. So with the help of the\npackages which I sent him regularly for many years, he subsequently is a very capable man,\nspoke Lithuanian fluently, spoke Russian fluently, spoke Yiddish fluently, all these things which\nI couldn\u2019t do, he was able to do very well. And so he got a -- a very significant job with the\nRussian government and he was in charge of food distribution for the -- for Wilna and it\u2019s\nsurrounding. Well, that was a very big job because with food you cou -- in those days, you could\ntrade and help people in many ways. The story goes, supposedly, I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s true\nor not, but when the president of Lithuania, the prime minister had a birthday party and he\nneeded vodka or food or whatever, he had to get permission from my brother to get these\nsupplies. So he had a fairly good job, and then he was in charge also of their hotels which --\nwhich were built to cater to foreign dignitaries. So that he had occasion to go to all the Russian --\nto Czechoslovakia, to some of the other Russian countries, whatever, and learn how to run a -- an\nouts -- what I would call a hotel that caters to dignitaries. And he had a fairly good life. The first\ntime I actually met -- saw my brother since I left home in 1936 was in 1988. That\u2019s 52 years\nlater. And I met my brother in Israel. It seems that a Maccabee team from Lithuania came to\nIsrael to participate in the games and my brother was very much involved with the soccer team in\nLithuania, and so he came, he got permission to travel with the team to Israel for the soccer\ngames. And that is the first time that I met -- I saw my brother after 52 years.",
        "A: It was very difficult to say the leas -- the least, but you know, he -- he is a very outgoing\nperson, very -- very able, and he -- if I say so myself, he adored me, because I am his source of\nsurvival. And I finally convinced him in 1988 to move to Israel, because he had such a good job\nin Lithuania. He had a car, he had a dacha, he had computers, he had everything. And here he has\nto give it all up and move to Israel where his children don\u2019t speak the language, where -- well, he\nspoke some Hebrew because he went to a Hebrew high school, but it\u2019s starting a whole new life.",
        "A: So [had to promise him that I will get him a condominium for him, a condominium for his\ndaughter, for his son. I will get them cars, and I will make sure that they will be able to live in\nrelative comfort in Israel. And it was only after these promises that he has agreed to move to\nIsrael. So in 1989, I think, he moved to Israel.",
        "A: Really, I don\u2019t think he would have been as happy in the United States as he was in Israel.\nFirst of all, there was a big migration of Soviet Jews to Israel. So a lot of his friends came --",
        "A: -- to Israel. It would have been a -- much more difficult for him and for his family to\nacclimate to a life in the United States.",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "A: To leave Lithuania, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: -- y-you\u2019re right.",
        "A: It -- it -- it\u2019s a huge -- you know, I sometimes wonder, really what do we have in common?",
        "A: And what we have in common is basically our parents and our Jewish tradition, and my\nresponsibility since my father was killed, that I had to take over and provide for the family. But\nwe didn\u2019t have this close relationship that normally brothers have.",
        "A: We lived in different worlds. I lived in the United States, and he lived in Russia. We were\nboth very comfortable, he in Russia and I in the United States.",
        "A: Well, actually he never really wanted to discuss his life in the ghetto, or his life in Dachau. He\ndid tell me about Dachau that when the Americans were nearing Dachau that the Germans\ndecided to vacate the camp, and they decided to march them east. And he tells me the story that\nwhile they were marching in the -- through the woods, and his feet, he -- were bleeding, he was\nexhausted, and he tells me that he couldn\u2019t take it any more and he and a friend of his decided to\nfall to the ground, and whatever it is, it is. And he tells me the story about this German soldier\nthat came across him and said to his friend, don\u2019t waste a bullet on him, he is dead. And so they\npassed by and he then wi -- with his friend, ran to find food or shelter, or whatever. And they\ncame across a farm and when they knocked on the door, the Germans were frightened obviously\nand they said wa -- all we want is some food and -- and some water, whatever. And the Germans\nsaid, we don\u2019t have any food, but the American army is across on that river, and if you cross that\nbridge, y-you\u2019ll find the American army and they will be able to help you. And you better hurry\nup because the bridge 1s going to be blown up. So with whatever strength he and his friend had,\nthey ran across the river and no sooner did they get to the other side of the river, the bridge blew\nup. But by that time they were on the side where the Americans were, and so they received food,\nshelter and so forth from the American army.",
        "A: That\u2019s all he -- but he wouldn\u2019t have -- he wouldn\u2019t tell me about the -- his experiences in\nDachau, about the killings in Dachau. You know, he didn\u2019t a -- and he didn\u2019t discuss -- he\ndoesn\u2019t discuss much about his life in the ghetto, either. Although, I understand from some\ncousins of mine that when he was in the ghetto, my father arranged for him to get married in the\nghetto. And he must have been then -- what wa -- 16 - 17, and that his wife was taken away, and\n-- from the ghetto or whatever, and he never saw her again.",
        "A: He didn't -- he didn\u2019t tell me that, because I don\u2019t think his current wife knows about it, that\nhe was married.",
        "A: No, she a Jewish girl.",
        "A: It\u2019s when he went back to Lithuania, to Poinyavich to look for my mother, he came across\nthat Jewish family, they took him in. They had a daughter, they got married and before you knew\nthere was a baby. And the other -- the only other thing he tells me is that he was able to reclaim\nmy father\u2019s home. And he then sold the house, which belonged to my father, and no sooner did\nhe sell the house that that money became devalued. That he told me.",
        "A: Well, it had -- it -- obviously it\u2019s a very central part of my life. This is why I am so committed\nto Israel. This is why I am committed to the importance of the state of Israel, because it\u2019s my\nview that if we had an Israel at the time, we had a place that would have admitted Jews, maybe\nmy parents could have been saved, and my parents wou -- with not only my parents, with my\ngrandparents, my uncles, my cousins, everybody else that was killed by the Lithuanians in 1941.\nSo I have done a number of things to memorialize it. One of the things which I always hoped,\nthat I would be able to bring my parents over, and to give them the type -- the kind of lifestyle\nthat they gave me when I was a kid. And obviously that was not to be. So I got involved in\nbuilding a geriatric center. And I felt, while I may not be able to take care of my parents, I will\nbe able to take care of other parents, who will be able to finish their years in a home where they\ncould -- are surrounded by their own people, and they would spend the rest of their life in\ndignity, and -- so we build this communities -- this geriatric center, which is called the Gurwin\nJewish geriatric center. It\u2019s in Commack, Long Island, and it 1s an -- if I say so myself, an\noutstanding geriatric center. It has 460 beds, it has another 120 daycare patients, and it has\napartments with assisted living for 200 units. And so I have devoted a lot of time, effort and\nenergy to build this geriatric center, and to maintain it in a style which would be a credit to the\nJewish community.\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: Well, because of that, I have been a leader in the UJA Federation of New York. I was\nchairman of the board for three, four years, and -- think it was between 1987 and 1990. I am very\nsupportive of all Jewish causes. I have sent up two satellites called Gurwin one and two. They\nwere built in Israel, they were designed by Technion, built by Israel aircraft industry and they\nwere launched on a Russian missile from Kazakhstan.",
        "A: Yes. The first satellite went kaput.",
        "A: Because --",
        "A: -- the Russian missile did not ignite the fourth stage, so it never got into orbit.",
        "A: And -- and so I said it was not the fault of Technion, it was the fault of the Russian missile, so\nwe're going to build a second one. So we have a second satellite, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Gurwin\ntwo, and it is still circling --",
        "A: -- the world to this day. It was originally designed that it would last probably a year or two at\nthe most. It\u2019s now six or seven years and it\u2019s still in orbit.",
        "A: So that was one of the things which I did. I am on the board of Technion and I\u2019m also on the\nboard of the Weizmann Institute of Science. And I am very supportive of both institutions. I have\nreceived a doctorate from Technion and I\u2019m getting a PhD. from the Weizmann Institute in\nNovember.",
        "A: So -- and I have been involved in every -- whether I was a guest of honor of ADL in Palm\nBeach, I was guest of honor of the American Jewish Committee in Palm Beach. I have been\ninvolved with the Magen [indecipherable] where we contributed, Phyllis and I, to ambulances\nwhich bear our name. I\u2019m very much involved with the Long Island Jewish hospital which I am\non board, and we have built there an educational resource center. So, we have done whatever we\ncould in our own way to -- to make this a better world to live in.",
        "A: Do what?",
        "A: It is too hard for me --",
        "A: -- to do it. [remember going to see Schimberg\u2019s List.",
        "A: Was very difficult.",
        "A: And I remember seeing -- there\u2019s, I think an Italian movie about this couple that lived in Italy,\nin luxury and so forth, and it brought back memories --",
        "A: -- that were very difficult.",
        "A: No, I been in -- in the Holocaust museum several times.",
        "A: I have been at Yad Vashem several times. As a matter of fact, I have been at the -- the latest\nYad Vashem only last year.",
        "A: It was [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I can go -- go through the exhibition. I remember they had the children\u2019s memorial in Yad\nVashem.",
        "A: Iremember going through with -- with it with my late wife, she couldn\u2019t do it.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: -- she\u2019s an American, lived in the United States.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: [inaudible]",
        "A: Oh yes. I will never forget it, 1t is part of my life, and as long as I\u2019m alive, I will wa --\nremember it, and do whatever I can to make sure that this does not happen again.",
        "A: And so it just so happens that this 1s August the first and this terrible battle that\u2019s taking place\nin Israel today, and I am very, very upset about it. I -- I am just very concerned for the future of\nIsrael, and for the future of the Jewish people.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know. I think we covered most of it. I just hope that my children will continue to\nsupport the philanthropic activities in which I am involved with. I am going to leave them a\nfoundation which will enable them to do whatever they would like to do, but hopefully they will\nsupport the causes which I have supported.",
        "A: I have a son and I have a daughter.",
        "A: I have a son who 1s an ophthalmologist.",
        "A: And he has his wife and he has three children.",
        "A: They are c-climbing Kilimanjaro.",
        "A: And then there 1 -- I have a daughter, and she has one daughter -- I have one granddaughter,\nand she\u2019s just graduated a year ago from MIT. And my daughter is now retired, she was working\nfor 25 years at Mount Sinai hospital in New York. She has a degree in hospital administration.\nAnd she hopefully will have the time to devote to my causes, and we\u2019ll see.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s always difficult, but realizing what we are up against, and the denials that they place\nevery day about the Holocaust, it is my opportunity to stand witness for what happened to my\nparents and the rest of my family.\n"
