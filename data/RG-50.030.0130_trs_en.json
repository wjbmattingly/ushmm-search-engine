        "Q: Could you tell me your name please?",
        "A: My name is Abraham Lewent. This is mine original name. I was born in Warsaw, Poland,\nJuly 1924. I came from a family from many, many sisters and brothers and cousins and\nuncles and aunts. And we lived in Warsaw for many, many years. Even my great\ngrandparents came from that town. I lived mostly in the Jewish section of Warsaw. Uh, to be\nspecific, I lived...my parents and me, my sisters lived on Zamenhof Street. I went to school. I\nwent to a cheder (ph), and a Yiddish school, and matter of fact, I went to a cheder with the\nfamous Mila 18, and that was the place I went in a cheder. On the first floor, this was\nalready, when I was about maybe 12...11, 12 years old. After I changed schools and I went to\na school on Niska 4, and this was a school run by, I think, by some, uh, party, or...it was a\nreligious school. That was not the thing. And that school I went until the war broke out. And\nI remember this was September Ist.",
        "Q: Let's not get to the war yet? Yes. Let's take a little time. I would like to find a little more. Tell\nme about your parents?",
        "Q: My parents were very young people. I guess my father, when the war broke out, he was only\n37 years old, and my mother must have been 34 years old when the war broke out. I had\nthree sisters. I had three sisters...let's say, when the war broke out, one sister was 13, one\nwas 11, one was 9. They all went to school, and we came from a middle class family. What I\nmean middle class, mine father was running the factory, mine grandfather owned. We owned\na factory in Warsaw that was very well known. It was called Firma Baranek. This was\nlocated on Nalevki 35. The first floor was the factory, and downstairs was the store when we\nsold...we used to manufacture women's underwear, men's shirt, winter clothing for people,\nand we used to buy the raw merchandize in lots in Poland and they supply to us, and we used\nto have cutters and machines and we make the stuff. And my father ran all the factory. We\nused to have probably about 20 people, or 25 people working inside. And I guess I was a\nlittle boy that time. I didn't know what money means, but I guess we were pretty good off. I\nmean, I had shoes, I had clothes, and summertime, we used to go away in the country once in\na while, so probably we weren't that bad off. And I guess my father...grandfather was better\noff. I remember he took trips to Israel. In 1935 and 36, he was in Israel, and he came back\nand he told us all the stories about Israel, and we all sitting by the table, listen, you now,\nwhat happened in a distant land and I guess in that time if you could afford to go for trips,\nyou must be very well off. I had...this was one grandfather, and after I had a grandfather, my\nfather's father, and they used to live near the famous Warsaw cemetery on Geinsha\nStreet.(ph) Actually, it's not...the cemetery is on Ocopova Street, but my grandfather had a\nstore, a hardware store, Geinsha 87 and his name was Moshe Lewent--Mothai Lewent. I am\nsorry. His son was Moshe. And I guess all those people over there, the did know him. As a\nmatter of fact, I have to give you an incident. I was in a hotel in the mountains a couple of\nyears ago, and I met people who ran away from Poland in 1956 when they chased them\nout...the Gomulka Regime, and I met a couple of people what actually they knew mine\ngrandfather. And we happened to talk about Warsaw, and I asked the person...he asked me,\n\"Where did you live?\" And I said I lived there, but I had a grandfather living over there.\nAnd he says, \"You mean to tell me Mothai was your grandfather? I used to go in. I used to\nbuy kerosene with him. I used to buy soap by him. I used to buy shoelaces by him. And this\nwas your grandfather! And Esther was your grandmother!\" I says, \"Yes.\" (Sobbing,\nSobbing, Sobbing)",
        "Q: It's alright.",
        "A: So after this, we started talking about it.",
        "Q: Let's pull back. Let's go back to your childhood. Okay?",
        "A: Yah.",
        "Q: You are growing up. You want to take a break. Let's hold it a minute. Let's take a minute.\nOkay.",
        "A: And that picture is my grandfather. That picture which you have in your hand. This was him.",
        "Q: Okay. Already. Alright, start the camera. Are we on? Okay. Alright, so we are talking about\na childhood, and you had sisters and brothers?",
        "A: Yah.",
        "Q: Tell us then, uh, what happened to this family when the Germans came?",
        "A: Okay. When the Germans came in, my father...I mean actually we were...we had no food in\nthe house. It was not like here. You had always something in the house. In Europe,\neverything you need, you used to go out every day in the store, and you used to buy. When\nthe war broke out, the water was cut off. There was no gas in the house to cook anything.\nThere was no food. So my father used to go out once in a while and we used to get some\nbread or the necessary things. And I remember for a couple of weeks, we lived just on sour\npickles because not far where we used to live, a couple of streets, there was a factory, they\nused to produce pickles. A Polish factory! And they call it Original, and they used to have\nthe pickles in tents like...small tents, and large ones. As I found out, so I went with a friend\nof mine and somehow we got in to that building in the night, even when the bombs were\nfalling and we used to run in the middle of the night and we grabbed about 6 or 8 cans, about\n5 pounds and we dragged it home, and this we lived for a couple of weeks. Just on pickles!\nAnd once in a while, we got bread. But we had some rice. So we had rice and pickles. And\nthis went on for...for weeks. There were houses burning. I mean it was...to describe a regular\nhell, because there was no water to douche the fires out, so the only thing they did was let the\nfires go. It just happened the house we lived that nothing happened. Like next house, third\nhouse, in the night when it stopped, people used to go out from the houses and look for\nsomething to eat. And this kept on for 4 weeks. When the Germans came in, so they didn't\nknow what's going to happen. New rules. New Regime. They first thing they did, they made\na curfew. You are not allowed to walk the street. But still there was no food. So the only\nthing they did was on the corner someplace like it happens someplaces, they used to have\nfield kitchens, and they used to give to the people bread and salamis. This is the truth. Right\nwhen they walked in. I found this it out through a friend of mine. When you go over there,\nlet's say maybe 3 miles, 4 miles, there 1s a field kitchen. You gonna go over there, you gonna\nget something. I remember like now I took my older sister. We walked and we walked\nand...and still the fires were on both sides, but the war was ended already. They occupied the\ncity. We came over there. We saw a line of people, and we stood in the line for that bread\nand the salami and sometime they gave you two breads. When I got to the line, a Pole...a\nPolish kid came out and said to the German, \"He's Jude.\" You know like...the German didn't\neven know that time...he didn't make any difference between a Jew and not a Jew; but the\nPolish kids, they were pointing out to the Germans, like \"Don't give it to him. He's a Jew.\"\nSo now they got the way... So the German couldn't do anything, I mean. So he chased us\naway. So when he chased us away, we stood again. So now, the Polish kids, they chased us\naway and they grabbed all the bread, and all the things. So we had to go home without bread\nand without anything. And it was a fact that we had to go carry water from the Vistula, from\nthe river; and this is like 4 miles. So we took 2 pails of water. Me and my sister took 2 pails\nof water, and we walked. We carried the pails so when we had to pass by a Polish\nneighborhood, those Polish kids came out and picked up the pails of water and threw it out\nand make us walk back. Now this is in a time when the Germans took over the city. Every\ncitizen was on his own, and they know they lost their country. Still the hatred. The anti-\nSemitism those Polish people had toward the Jews. For no reason at all! Now they felt that\nthey can do with the German help what they always want to do. And here they got somebody\nto point out he's a Jew's and he's a this, and he's a that, and when they walked around with\nthe water, they used to turn the water out from those kids, cause elderly people couldn't carry\nthat far pails of water. So this went on for a couple of weeks. You know with that thing.\nFinally, the occupation was starting, and they started giving you anti-Jewish laws, and I\nremember like now, in November, I think it was in November or September, there was a\nstreet in Warsaw, the Nalevki. And somehow a Polish...a German soldier got shot. I don't\nknow how or why. This is the first ttme I heard about it. They took out 53 people from that\nbuilding, men, women, children, and they killed them instantly. This is maybe 2 weeks after\nthey walked in....1n the town. And...and I don't now that...what happened with that soldier,\nhow he got shot over there, and this was in the Jewish district, you know, and they took out\n53 people and they killed them. And since then everybody knew that something terrible is\ngoing to happen to the Jewish people in that District. Now what happened to our place 1s that\nthe German's find out about my grandfather's factory and the store, so every day you see\ntrucks came in and they loaded up. They cleaned out little by little everything. My father and\nmy grandfather, we grabbed some stuff and we kept it in the house. Not much because you\ncouldn't grab too much. And little by little, they cleaned out the warehouse, they cleaned out\nthe factory. They took away the machines. Everything they loaded up in truck, and I don't\nknow where they had it. So from that little merchandize, what we saved from that factory,\nwe lived awhile. We sold little by little and somehow this kept us going for let's say, maybe 2\nyears, you know. And after...this was around 1941...1942. 1941 or 42 it start getting very\nbad, because the ghetto was closed in. They made a wall around the ghetto. I had to wear a\narm band with the star of David. Say everybody, even the smallest children...my littlest\nsister, a little tiny girl...she had to walk out on the street, she had a arm band, you know, with\na...with a star of David. And everybody in the house had always ready, uh, how you say a\nrucksack with a piece of bread, some stuff, in case something happened every kid will be\nprotected. That was my father's idea. We don't know what's going to happen. First day here,\nthey clean out this street. They clean out this street. You walk out in the street. You don't\nknow if you gonna come back, because they ...you walk on the street and they need 100\npeople to go to work, they grab you and you don't...they don't know what happened to you.\nWhen we lived in that building, we lived near a courtyard. One time each house had like a\ncommittee, and they were directing all the rules. One time there was a meeting and they said\nthey need 35 people to go to work. So who'll they take? Elderly people, they can't take. The\nyoungsters they can't take, so they took 17, 18, 19 year old people. And from that house by\nus, we had to give them 3 people. So each house, like 10 building, used to give 30 people.\nAnd 3 people that went, 18, 19, they were 6 weeks away. When they came back, nobody\nrecognized them. Each one was swelling. I remember that I had a friend. His name was\nSchemick. He came back. His feet, his hand, his head were twice the size from the beating,\nfrom the undernourishment those people had. What did they do? They dig some kind of dam\nin the water. They were standing all day long in the water in digging the ground, and from\nthis they got swelling, and they were undernourished, and this kid lived about 2 weeks after\nthey send him home he died because he was so sick. And this kept on like this, and my father\nwas still home. My mother was still home. My sisters were home, and still we went\nsome...and...in time of the night, we had schooling, like people made a school for 3, 4\nchildren. They shouldn't forget what they learn, and we had libraries. We went in the\nlibraries. We read books. We still think sometime sometime will get better. In the\nmeanwhile, we had...there was a Polish newspaper. Actually it was a newspaper where the\nGerman printed but in Polish language, and this was smuggled in in the ghetto and we read\nit. We heard only about the Germans winning the war and they win this and this and this. We\ndidn't know anything. The radios was not allowed to have because they took all the radios\nfrom the Jewish people. They took away one night and made a decree, everybody has a\nradio, fall coats, good clothes, this has to be given away. And we didn't have no news\nactually what happened on the other side of the world. And this went on like this until 1942.\n42 came the big day when they start staying to the people well, we need people to go Ost\n[NB: to the east], means for work. And the hunger in the ghetto was so great, was so bad,\nthose people were laying on the streets and dying, little children went around begging, and,\nuh, everyday you walked out in the morning, you see somebody is laying dead, covered with\nnewspapers or with any kind of blanket they found, and you found those people used to carry\nthe death people in little wagons, used to bring them down to the cemetery and bury them in\nmass graves. And every day thousands and thousands died just from malnutrition because\nthe Germans didn't give anything for the people in the ghetto to eat. There was no such thing.\nYou couldn't walk in and buy anything or getting any rations. It's your pot luck. If you don't\nhave it, you die, and that's what it was. Finally when they start bringing people out from the\nghetto, they promised the people, if you gonna leave the ghetto, we'll give you 3...3 pounds\nof bread and, uh, a can of marmalade and sugar and stuff like this. And if you just register,\nyou want to go to work. Some people if they heard that word, 3 pounds of bread and\nmarmalade and sugar, they didn't care what's going to happen to them. They just went and\nthey signed up. Actually, it's not signed up because when they...when they went to that place,\nthey got the bread and the marmalade and you see every day women, children walking to\nthat place, Umschlagplatz, and get the 3 breads. And they pushed them into the trains; and\nthey pushed in so many people in the trains that they actually couldn't eat that bread. There\nwas no room even to cut the bread. So what happened. Well, they send them to Treblinka.\nThe trains came back with the same bread because in the trains they used to put in 350 to 400\npeople in a cattle car and you had standing room only. You couldn't even sit. You couldn't\neven stand. You were just pressed like sardines. So the bread and the marmalade when the\npeople had it in their hands, it was still in their hands because when they get to destination in\nTreblinka, they had to undress and they had to leave everything. So the same breads and the\nsame marmalade came back for the new transport. And this went on constantly. Now the\n22nd of July 1942, that was the day when I was home and there was, uh, a...a raid. The SS\ncame, start shooting, start hollering everybody down, everybody down in the court yard, and\nI said to my mother, \"What we gonna do?\" So she says, \"You don't have to worry. I got a\npaper. Your daddy works.\" My father was working as a mechanic in a...1n the ghetto for\nthe...for the...in the factory they used to make fur coats for the German flyers...for the pilots.\nSo he was like taking care of all the machineries and she has a paper that her husband works\nfor the Germans so she says, \"Don't worry, I mean.\" I says, \"But I have to worry because I\nam over 17. And if they see me, they will grab me.\" So she says, \"Don't worry. You go\nhide.\" So I was hiding in the house and she went downstairs with my 3 sisters. Everybody\nwas having that...that thing on the back of the thing with a piece of bread with a...with a\nschmatles (ph) inside. I don't know what they keep inside. And that's how they went\ndownstairs. And this is the...the last time I saw them. Because the Germans even if they saw\nthe paper, they just took the paper like this and ripped it apart and they took them out. That\ntime they took about 10,000 people to the place Umschlagplatz took the people to Treblinka.\nI was laying, hidden in a room on the top of the ceiling. They made like a blind room. If you\nwouldn't know it, you wouldn't know it's a room. But it's actually was like a hideaway on the\ntop of the ceiling. And I was laying there, and I heard the Germans came into the house and\nthey take them out downstairs, and I was laying there. I didn't know what to do, what to say.\nAnd I figured because of the paper, he's going to read the paper and he's going to say, \"Oh,\nwell, and he's going to let him stay.\" And he tell them to go downstairs. In the courtyard,\nthere was already hundreds of people like this, and they took them away. This was around 5\no'clock or 6 o'clock in the evening. And this was that day on July 1942. And another thing\nhappened. If they have, uh, a norm. That means they need 10,000 people every day, and if\nthey had 8,000, they just went around on the street and just grabbed everybody who comes\nalong to make the 10,000 up. And that's what probably happened that day. They needed a\ncouple of hundred more, and...and where we used to live was only about 10, 15 minutes\nfrom their Umshagplatz where all the trains went to Treblinka, so the first thing they did, ran\ninto those court yards, and they grabbed the people. And after this, uh, 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock,\nmy father came home and I told him what happened and I said to him, \"Well, I...1...I can't be\nhere anymore.\" You know, like I just can't find myself a place. First of all, I says you go\naway in the morning to work. I have to stay here by myself. And I don't know what can\nhappen. Any minute they can grab me too because I have no papers. I don't work. And if\nyou don't have no papers, you don't work. It's just like, uh, you don't exist. So I don't know\nwhat to do. So I spoke... had a friend of mine...a kid I went to school with him, and he told\nme, \"There is a guy who lives next house, and he works on the on the airport in Warsaw for\nthe Germans and he says for a couple... for some money he can arrange...that he can have a\nfew people going to work in the airport. This 1s a good job, and you can stay there and at\nleast you're going to be safe a little bit. I told this to my father and I said to him, you know,\nwe're going to need 2 or 3 thousand zlotys to pay off this guy cause this guy is going to pay\noff a German. And in that book I gave you is the whole story from that thing, but I just gonna\ntell you what happened. That's...some day he came. My father gave him the money. I took\nwith me...I remember like now...I took with me a leather briefcase. I took with me maybe\n200 zlotys. That's all there was left, and I took with me some underwear and tfillin. My\nfather says, \"You take this.\" And I went because I was Bar mitzvah year before. So I didn't\nhave a chance even to wear it. He says, \"Take it with you.\" So I went and I took this. And I\nremember like now the guy took us and we walked on the street in the ghetto...what nobody\nis allowed to walk, but he had a paper from the...from the...from the German Air Force, that\nhe's bringing some people to work for the airplanes or something, so... And I saw these\nGerman SS. They're walking around and looking at us, see somebody and here they see four\npeople walking in the middle of the street with any kind of fear with this look in them, so one\nsoldier came over he asks for Ausweiss, so we showed him the paper and he says, \"Go\nahead.\" If you walked about about maybe 20 minutes and after I saw...I was there, I saw a\nGerman in an air force uniform waiting for us. He had half a hand because he must have\nbeen shot or something, so he's got...one arm was loose and he came over and he spoke to\nthis guy and the says to him, three guys. He put us in a street car, you know,\nbecause a Jew was not allowed to ride the street car. And here we got those things you know\nbecause we are afraid to take it off. So he said to us, \"We should take them off and he 1s\ngoing to stay with us, and he paid for us on the street car, those tickets, and we went all the\nway to Okence (ph). Okence (ph) is like Kennedy Airport from New York, you know, like.\nAnd I was over there...1n Okence (ph), I was over there 16 weeks. RIght. I was in Okence\n(ph) from May...No...from July, August...No. I went to Okence (ph)... went August,\nSeptember, November...3 months....4 months...16 weeks. And we didn't know what\nhappened to the ghetto. We know that there's no people left over there. Everybody is out. I\ndidn't know what happened to my father. I didn't know anything. And I was there 16 weeks,\nand we worked by coal. We unload wagons of coal for the Germans used to use for heating\nup the systems and some wagons of coals went to Germany. So this was mine job, to unload\nand load coals. And once we clean airplanes...once in a while they took us to clean out the\nairplanes, the military airplanes, little things like this, not major stuff. And they used to feed\nus, maybe 2 slices of bread a day and a soup, a watery soup. But we had good quarters to\nsleep because in those quarters used to sleep the soldiers and this was an empty barrack so\nwe had to sleep, we had good quarters. There's no... We had a little bed with a mattress. This\nis very unusual and, uh, the only thing was no was no food. So that money that I have, a\ncouple of hundred zlotys, this lasts me for awhile to buy myself, and over there where we\nused to go to work, I used to take coal. I used to stuff myself in mine coat, and the coat used\nto weigh 20 pounds because I used to cut out the underline and used to stuff with coals.\nWhen I walked from the...from the air field back to the barracks, I used to ask the soldiers,\nthe German air force...they weren't that bad...the air force. They weren't that bad because\nthey probably were not indoctrinated like the German SS or the Gestapo, so I used to say to\nhim, \"You see how dirty I was. (in German) I have to buy soap to wash my face.\" He said,\n\"Sure.\" So they used to walk slow. I used to run across the street. There was little stores\nfrom Polish people. They have little stores. They used to sell bread. They used to sell soap.\nThey used to sell candies. And I used to go in and I used to say in Polish to them, \"You want\na coal.\" Oh, they were...they went crazy, because they weren't allowed to have coal. I mean\nthe Germans took everything away. And I used to walk like this. I bend down, I scouped\neverything up, put in the pail and they gave me sometimes...they gave me a half a bread.\nSometimes they gave me some a piece of salami. Sometime they gave me some candies.\nSometimes a pack of cigarettes. I mean, that's all I need. I didn't need no money. I need to\nbargain with them. I need to deal with them. And this went on for quite awhile. Once I heard\nthere's people starting to run away, from that camp, and I says, \"Where do they running?\"\nThey found out that some people still live in the ghetto. And I didn't know what to do. I\ndidn't know where to run...to who to run. And this every night, I used to sleep and I used to\nthink how will I get out from here. Maybe my father's still alive. Maybe my mother came\nback. Who knows? And I was a young kid at that time. I was a baby. I was 16 years old, I\nmean I didn't know even how to think straight. But once it was winter...1t was very cold. Was\ndark already when we walked back. I heard a Pole calling my name. He was standing on the\nsidewalk. And we walked to the middle of the road like to the sidewalk, and he called my\nname. He says in Polish, \"Is there a Lewent here?\" And my name in Poland 1s Levent, not\nLewent. And I heard that, I says \"Yes,\" and I started to run to him and the German thought I\nam going to run away, he walloped me with a rifle right in my stomach and I fell right down.\nSo the Pole, he saw that he said, he's going to be back tomorrow. Like this. I went home and\nI couldn't sleep anymore. I didn't know what to do. I really hurt. This is the first time I saw\nthem hitting somebody. He thought I am going to runaway you know because he saw me\nrunning out from the line of people and after that, tomorrow, the same time, he's there. He\ncalls me. That time, I was smarter. I kept myself to the end, not in the middle, and to the end,\nand I said to him, \"I am going to go buy something.\" And he went and he gave me a piece of\npaper...put me a end a piece of paper. And I grabbed a hold of piece of paper like this, and I\nwent back in the line. I came in the barracks. I opened up the piece of paper. My father wrote\nme a letter, and he says that he is in ghetto. He still works in the same place. And I shouldn't\ntry to escape. He's gonna get me somebody to take me out and bring me to him. And this was\nin December 1940...42. I couldn't wait. After 1 day...after the second day or the third day,\nnobody shows up. It's a week already, nobody shows up. So I says...I said to my friend,\nLandau, I says, \"You know I am gonna...1 am gonna run away.\" He says, \"Don't do it.\nThey're gonna shoot you. Don't do it, you know.\" I says, \"No, I'll figure out something.\" So\none night I remember like now, it was about Thursday. This was the 30th of December\nbefore New Years, between Christmas and New Years. And I did the same trick. I had coals\nwith me, and I was dirty black, the face and the hands, you know, like anything...and I asked\nthe same guy. He was an elderly man. And I said to him, \"I'm gonna buy soap to wash\nmyself.\" And he says, \"Go ahead\" \"Come right back,\" he says. \"Come right back.\" I went\nover there and I got all these coals, and at that time, she says to me...the woman, she says to\nme in Polish, \"No,\" she says, \"Little boy, what do you want today? Do you wanta bread or\nyou wanta milk?\" I said, \"No. I need some money today.\" She said, \"I can't give you no\nmoney, you know.\" I says, \"I'll tell you what. For the whole thing, just give me two dollars--\ntwo zlotys. I am going to have fare on the street car. I didn't tell her this. So she took out and\nshe gave it to me. But she gave me change. That's what I needed. And I went and...I never\nwent back to the formation, and I walked...I was dark. I was dirty, so they didn't recognize\nme, and I took off this. This was the worse thing I did. You should never take this off. And I\nwent and I jumped on a street car and I didn't go inside, you know, so to speak. The street car\nwas on the end...the end...and I turned my face and I gave that lady 30 groszen (ph), and I\nsays, \"I am gonna...because I have to take another one. I remember now what street car to\ntake. She didn't say. She gave me a ticket, and I was standing and standing and standing.\nThen I said to myself, \"Oh, I wish it's over. It's over again.\" And I went with this street car\nabout maybe 10 blocks, 20 blocks. Next to me there was a Pole standing, and I remember\nlike now, he was a little hunchback and he had, uh, a sack. Maybe it was garbage inside or\nsomething, and I saw he looks at me, he looks at me, he looks at me, and I tried to turn my\nface away, and he keeps looking. Finally, he got right next to me, and he says to me in\nPolish, \"What are you doing here.\" I didn't answer. I make believe I didn't hear him. And he\nsays again, \"What are you doing here.\" Finally, he got violent. He did it like this to me, you\nknow. \"What are you doing here?\" So, I says to him, \"What do you mean what am I doing\nhere?\" you know In Polish I says, \"I am going home.\" He says, \"Don't give me that\nbologna, Jidek (ph),\" you know. This is in Polish. \"Don't give me that bologna like what are\nyou doing here? You know, you see that, uh, gendarme outside. I am gonna turn you in.\"\nAnd when you turn in somebody who doesn't have this, on the spot they shoot you.\" So I\ndidn't say anything. After he says to me like this, \"You got money.\" You know this is those\npeople they used to call them in Polish in the ghetto, Schmaltzovnik (ph). Schmaltzovnik\n(ph) means he wants the gravy. He wanted always money. I says, \"I don't have no money.\"\nHe says, \"I know you have money.\" I had 20...20 zlotys with me and I had it in my sock, not\nin the pockets. He says, \"You have money.\" \"I tell you what,\" I says, \"we gonna go down\nand I'll give you the money.\" So I picked the street... remember that now, the Jelasna (ph)\nStreet. All the houses were bombed out. And when that street car stopped, I said, \"I am\ngonna get down now, and he followed me. So he walked in with me in a bombed out house,\nand he said, \"Now, give me your money. If not, I am gonna turn you in.\" So, I bend down\nand I wanta take out the money from my sock. And he was so greedy and he looked on if I\ndon't leave anything over there, you know. And he bend down...he wants to see. So I grabbed\na stone and I just hit him in the face. And he fell down. He fell down. I didn't hurt him or\nanything. He just fell down. So when he fell down, I run out. And I ran out...I ran...I don't\nknow what happened to him, but I ran so fast because I lost...I lost the 20 zlotys I had, and I\nran out. And I know if I will catch, the next thing that will take me to the ghetto. And I had\nthe change where the lady, the Polish woman gave me for the coal and I ran to the thing and\nI got the street car and I went to the ghetto. And I know up to 7:00 they let in all the people.\nHere was already 7:30. And I says, \"Where will I be.\" I went over there. I saw about 20\npeople still standing over there. In one group 30 people. In one group 50 people. There's still\na lot of people. And I mixed myself in and I had no papers. I haven't got anything. I couldn't\nsay I worked any place. I just ran away from a work place. And here the SS stand by the\nghetto, by the wall, and they let in the people where they worked outside on German arbeits,\nGerman work places. I went over there and I went to one man and I says, \"Where's these\npeople from?\" So he tell me. He says, \"We work in a...1n someplace where they cut food all\nday long.\" I was looking for a place where they do with coal because cutting wood you don't\nget dirty in the face and the hands. Finally, I found people that were working some kind of\nmasonry. They were all dirty, no... I says, \"I am gonna hitch myself out to hem.\" I go over\nthere to them and everybody passes by and everybody has to raise their hands because they\nare frisked. One carries a bread, one carries potatoes, one carries red beets...red beets, and\none carries...any little thing. I don't have anything. That's suscipicious already. I don't have\nanything. And here the people were. They go through and everybody stays like this with\ntheir hands up. When I get to them, the German...the...the man that stays by the gate...the SS\ncalls me and says, \"Where are you from?\" I says, \"I work for those people.\" He says in\nGerman, \"How...how come you don't have anything with you. You see all those people...one\nhas got a bread, one has got potatoes, one has got this...and you don't have anything. I says\nto him I am very poor and I says I don't have time to buy anything to day because I worked\nvery hard. I had to unload a whole train with coal. He says, \"Is that so.\" He went over to the\nnext guy. He had two breads. He took away one from him and he gave it to me. And this is\nthe same guy who wouldn't even let me in next to him. And I passed him and I went in to the\nother side. I went to the other side and I had a bread. So this guy ran over to me and says,\n\"Give me back my bread. That's mine.\" So I was afraid to start making a commotion\nbecause there were Jewish police, there were German Police, there were Polish police. So I\ngave them the bread and I said, \"Thank God, I am on the other side. Forget about it.\" I came\nin to the other side and I have to look where my father 1s. Now I found out I have to go\nthrough three...three...how do you say it...three posts, with the soldiers to go through these.\nSo I went to a friend what I know he was in ghetto, and I asked him what to do. He says, \"I\ncan't give you no papers. There's nobody here. Everything is bombed out. There's no people\nhere. People...very few people. He says, \"You have to figure out for yourself what to do.\" I\nfound a way how to do it. I saw there's people going in groups. They're going in groups, like\nsix people, they go through the gate or 8 people. I went to the gate and I said to the six\npeople, \"where are you working.\" Some speak German and some don't because I learn a\nlittle bit German to speak when I was working over there at the...at that military airport. So I\nmake believe that I am the leader of those 8 people and I said in German, \"You should all\nstand in one line. You give me all the papers.\" And I went over there to the soldier and I\nsays to him in German, you know like big deal, I says to him, \"Look, I got 8 people going to\nwork and this is the papers.\" He looked on the papers. He didn't ask me for the papers. It\nwas a miracle. He didn't ask me. He just saw...because they have respect for people they\nare...they are, let's say, leaders. So there he thought as I'm the leader for them, so...you don't\nask a leader for papers. So those 8 people went and I went with them and that's how I went\nover there and after I went on the house where my father lives. And I remember like now, it's\nfourth floor and I walked up, opened the door. It was in the morning. Here he saw me. He\nsaid, \"What are you doing here, Ike?\" I says, \"Look, I couldn't wait until you send\nsomebody to take me.\" So...and this is the time when I stood there and my father took me in\nin that factory. He went to the boss, the German boss what owns...he was like...and he took\nme in and I was working over there until... I went through three, four selections over there\nwhen they took away the people. I...one selection was January 1943. One day... You\nremember that. One day they called us all downstairs, came in a big deal from the SS men,\nthe Gestapo. They lined us all up. I remember like now I had a pair of boots and I had\ncoveralls or overalls. I don't know what it is. And I was sitting there and he went 1, 2, 3, 4,\n5, 6 out. He didn't make 10. Every sixth men he took out. I was 4. My father was 5. I was\nstanding right next to him. The 6th one was out. After he went 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6 out, out. And a\ntruck was standing right there so they took out about maybe 60 people or 80 people, put\nthem on the truck. Didn't see them anymore. This was the first selection was that time. And I\nwas working in that place until the ghetto uprising. It was the ghetto uprising, that's the time\nit started the whole problem.",
        "Q: Talk...tell me what Warsaw looked like then and what happened.",
        "A: In the ghetto uprising. Well, in the ghetto uprising, I was not actually where the shooting\nwas. I was in the small ghetto where the people were working, but we can see the flames.\nWhere we were standing outside, we saw the flames. We saw the flames . You didn't\nbelieve it. Those people can do this. Burning up houses, whole streets, everything was one\nflame. We had a wall in the ghetto wall. When I was standing in the house, you look down\non the wall and you see Polish people. They making Christmas. They making all kind of\nholidays, and they know there's the other people going through that thing. They didn't even\nmind that the had to help anything like this. So...for instance, when they liquidated that\nghetto and they took us to the...to send away in the camps, they took me and my father and\nwe were carrying suitcases. So we walked over the streets. Now this is true; this is not made\nup. One side of the sidewalk the Polish people from the town of Warsaw were standing and\nsaying to us in Polish, \"People, you don't need this. You leave it for us. You going anyway\non...to make soap out of you.\" Now this is people that lived with you for hundreds and\nhundreds of years. You pay taxes. You live in their town. You were just a citizen of this\ntown, just like anybody else. Where they had the chance to show how the anti-Semitism was\nbuilt in...in the people of Poland. It was so built in, the anti-Semitism for those people that\nthey...even if they lost the country, they still they have won their anti-Semitism against the\nJewish people. Even if they lost the country because German occupied it. Still they had to\nshow it. And there's a reason why Germany made all that camps and all the concentration\ncamps, made it on Polish soil because they know that they will have good help from the\nsurrounding, from the people because he didn't do it in any other country, not in Poland those\nthings. I was in a camp...I mean this is something else. I was in a camp...in Skarzysko.' This\nis a camp near Radom. I could of...everyday, I could have run away from that camp. I could\nhave just walked over the fence. Where am I gonna go? Who I am gonna go? I was working\nwith Polish people, they didn't even look at you. I was working in a...in Skarzysko, in a camp\nin a...1n a machinery. Next to me, there was a Pole. He saw that every day I looked skinnier. I\ndidn't have a glass of water. I didn't have bread. Nothing! They used to sit down just like\nhome. Bring it in. It come the holiday. They had all thoses holiday breads. They used to say,\n\"Here, you want a piece.\" You don't exist for them. You did not exist for them. And...and\nthe point is it hurts you so much that you were living in a country for so many years...for\nhundreds and hundreds of years, and the people turned their back on you, actually turned\ntheir back on you. Like they were...like they liked, they were enjoy this what happened to\nyou. Sure, naturally, they say a lot of Poles, they were saving Jews. But how many? How\nmany? From 6 milion Jews, 3 and one half million was Jews from Poland. So how many you\ngot in 50 or 60 or 100 Poles they saved. And for what they saved? With money! Because if\nthe money ran out, they used to turn you in anyway.",
        "Q: Let's come back to Warsaw. You were in the little ghetto watching the flames?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did you do? What happened to you and your father?",
        "A: Well, in the minute the ghetto burned and this what went start, they closed the factory. And\nthey made a raid. A raid means they came in. They told us, \"Everybody has to leave, and we\ngonna get shipped out for work.\" My father and me we sticked to let's be together. Let's start\nbeing together now the best way we can. One day in the morning the factory didn't open up.\nEverybody has to be outside in the street. You are not allowed to go up anymore in the\napartments you lived. Everybody has to be outside. Around 10 o'clock, it came trucks and\nstart loading up all the goods from the houses, from the apartments. Not us. They cleaned out\neverything and we still was sitting on the street. Around 12 or 1 o'clock in the afternoon, they\ntell us to get ready, we gonna walk. We gonna walk. It's about 6, 7 miles. So my father and\nme, my father's friend and his friend, we all stick together and we walked. That means we\nwalked about I'll say 8 or 10 miles towards the place, the Umschlag place, the famous\nUmschlag place, to get on trains and take us someplace. We don't know where. We went to\nthat...and that's the time when I told you where we carried the suitcases. Only what you are\nable to carry. That's the time the Polish people came and said, \"Leave it here on the street\nbecause you have no use for this anymore.\" Like vultures, and if somebody couldn't carry\nanymore, they left it and you see them running and grab it. We went to that Umshlagplatz.\n' Formally known as Skarzysko Kamienna. Located near Kielce, in Radom province.\nWe were sitting three days over there without water, without anything for 3 days, and it was\nhot. The third day they gave us water and they said, \"We're gonna leave.\" And where we're\ngoing we don't know. They put us on trains. I was together with my father with this man and\nhis wife or his sister was it. And they took us to Majdanek. Majdanek was a camp near\nLublin, and over there was 5 fields. That means evry field had 8 or 9 hundred people and it\nwas barracks and there's nothing to do Majdanek. They only thing you were Majdanek, you\ndid you sit sometime all day long and sometime they took you out to work and half of them\nnever came back. They make you sit all day and breaking up from big stones to make little\nstones or digging holes, digging ditches and covering the ditches up. That was the way.\nThat's what you call, uh, a camp that actually is a annihilation. They annihilate peole,\nactually. Very little food. Very little food. And my father was with me together, sleeping\nnext to each other. One day, this was...we got to Majdanek was in July, I think in August\n1943. We were standing in a ditch and digging and my father was standing next to me, a\nPole passes by, grabs a stone and throws it onto my father. And he was a prisoner too, you\nknow. The stone hit his leg. I don't know what happened if he broke a bone or something\nhappened. He couldn't walk. And in the night when we went home to the barracks, he\ncouldn't walk. He had to hold me here, like this, and...some how we dragged him...me and\nthat friend, we dragged him in the barrack. He was laying down. And his foot swelled up like\nthis. All of a sudden it swelled up. So one guy said we should go and call a medic or a doctor\nor somebody. Over there, they used to call sanitar (ph) . Well, I didn't realize what's gonna\nhappened if somebody gets sick. I didn't realize it! I thought, well, when a man got sick,\nsomething like this, that medic came. He wore a red cross. He came. He took my father. He\nsays to him, \"You know what you have to go on Revier.\" \"Revier\" means the hospital. And\nhe took him away; and he says tomorrow he's gonna bring him back. I never saw my father\nanymore. And this is for no reason at all. Pick up a stone and throw on somebody. And he\nwas...he was just standing there. The stone could have hit me, but it hit him. And it went 2, 3\ndays. Finally, I found out where the hospital is. I didn't even know where the hospital is. So,\nI walked over to the hospital and I looked around in the windows. My father is not there. So\nafter I found out they took him away and where I don't know what happened to him. Two\nweeks later, I found out that's people have to go away from here. That means there're looking\nfor 3 thousand, 2 thousand people to take them to a German ammunition plant.",
        "Q: Hold it for a minute and we can change tapes.",
        "A: Okay.\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: Your father has been taken away. Tell us again what happened?",
        "A: Yes. A few weeks later, about 2 weeks I found out that there's going to transport. That means\nthat transport will be some kind of factory. And the reason the factory, because people say\nthis camp, the Majdanek camp, was the worse one because I remember when we came in...in\nthat camp, the commander for that camp made a speech to us. He says in this camp nobody\nwalks out yet. The only way you good people is going to walk out is to through that\nchimney. And here I heard that they need 2 thousand young men to work in an ammunition\nfactory. I says, \"How can I sign up for this?\" So they told me to go in a place over there, and\nthey had a list. I gave them my number and I signed up for this. And I was waiting. Let's see\nwhat happened. And here everyday I went to work. No food. And you getting weaker and\nweaker, and I figured if I can only get out from here, cause this is finished. In this camp\nnobody walks out. Finally, I found a place where you can register and I went and I\nregistered for this. And there was 800 women I think...800...400 women and about 800 men.\nAnd they registered us, and we had still the striped uniforms and wooden shoes, and they\nload us up on trains, and before we went, the same guy, the commander came, and he says\nyou're the first people walks out here normally. What is... And they took us to a camp, and\nthis name was Skarzysko.",
        "Q: Try...Can you describe what kind of train you were on, and what the transport was like?",
        "A: Well, the train was actually cattle cars. It was a train, open with no roof. Just barbed wire\nwas on the roof. They put in the people in the cattle car, how many can go on. If you were\nthe lucky one, the first one, you got a seat against the wall, you were very lucky. If not, you\nhad to stay in the center. There was no...uh...toilet us to go out. Everybody used to do what\nhe feels like it and instead a trip should take a day, they used to make it 3 days because who\ndidn't make it, that's alright. So who was young...the elderly people didn't make it. Only the\nyoung ones, and that time I was about 18 years old, 17 years old. I was a healthy kid, and\nsomehow I made it. And when I came into that camp, so the first thing they asked me, \"What\ndo you..What do you know what to do?\" So I told them this. Everybody says if you say you\nare good in mechanics and metal work, you will have a better job. That's what I said. Some\npeople said as a tailor, some... So they asked me, \"A young kid like this?\" I said, \"I learned\nat school.\" So they gave me...they put me in a...in a building, and they used to make pots\nfor...ammunition pots, and I was working over there maybe 2 months every day, sometime\nnights, sometime days. Food, very little. Very little food. You couldn't even exist on that\nfood they give you. But somehow you...you just survive. I don't know how but you survive.\nYou work a whole night. In the day they brought you back. One day they told me they're\ngonna put me in a different machine to work. What this machine does, it cuts little pieces of\nmetal, and from this they make bullets, like for machine gun bullets. I was working with that\nmachine, and I had to go always to the wall, and grab a long piece of metal and put it in the\n_ and cut it. One day I go over to the war, I see there is no metal. Here the foreman walks\naround in a uniform, he comes to me and he tells me, \"Why you standing around? You don't\ndo nothing?\" I says, \"I have no metal.\" He says, \"What do you mean you have no metal.\nYou tell me that the German Reich has no metal to work?\" I says, \"I am looking for metal\nand there is no metal.\" First, I got a beating right away for saying that. I have no metal. He\nsaw there's no metal. He beat me to a pulp, the head and the feet. He kicked me. Finally, he\nwent to another guy and another give me metal and I was working and I was talking to\nmyself and I said to myself, \"I have to get out from here cause if I am gonna stay in that\nfactory, I am gonna die here by that machine. They don't give you to eat. They watching you\nall day long or all night long what you're doing. You can't walk away for a minute. I found\nout that there's other people...there're work outside on the plant. They're organizing\nsomething. Even if you pick up garbage, you pick up a potato from the ground, but still you\ncan do it. You can't eat metal. I didn't know what to do. After this, all of a sudden I felt sick. I\ngot sick. I don't know what happened to me, but I feel sick, and this is the first time I got\nsick. I came from work. I lay down. One guy came over to me and says, \"You have a high\nfever. You burning up.\" I didn't know what it is. He says to me, \"Why don't you go in...in\nthe hospital. It was not a hospital. It was like a pig sty. People were laying on straw. I walked\ninside. There was a doctor. He used to be a doctor before the war, but here he didn't practice\ndoctor. And he looked at me and he says to me, \"You got typhoid.\" (sigh) He laid me right\ndown. He didn't let me go back to the barracks. But I know that every third day a truck came\nto that thing and cleaned them, all the people out and take them out. Because they have no\nmedicine to heal typhoid. I was laying about 2 days and my fever must have dropped. And I\ndidn't eat. I didn't... They didn't give me anything for 2 days. The third day I got up and I was\ndizzy and I said to the doctor, \"I feel alright. I am going to go back to work.\" He says to me,\n\"What do you mean you are going to go back to work. You can't even walk on your feet.\"\nAnd he started to laugh, you know, like who cares. And I said, \"I feel good. I like to go back\nto work.\" He says to me, \"You know what. You see that long table standing here.\" Table\nabout 12 feet long, maybe more. \"If you can walk around that table three times and you not\ngoing to fell down, I let you walk out.\" You know. And do you think I didn't do it? I walked\naround three times, and I walked that. And he told me, \"You can go back in your barracks.\"\nI must of have this already about 2 weeks, you know. And finally, it was the breaking point\nwas the last 2 days, 3 days. When I walked out, the trucks came over and cleaned out the\nwhole hospital. This another thing. When I walked out, I Just walked let's say 100 yards and I\nsaw 2 trucks came over, and they took everybody, everybody out from the...from that\nhospital. I call it the hospital. It was not a hospital. Was a pig sty. Was just..when I came\nback in the barracks, I had no hair. I hardly moved. Some people had mercy on me, and one\ngive me a piece of bread, and one give me water. One give me hot water, and finally I got\nback a little bit, and I said to myself, \"I don't go back anymore to work over there, and I will\nwork in a place like...like building _. I should be outside. If I'm outside, I will organize\nsomething to eat. And that's what happened. I went in and somehow I got hanged up with,\nuh, with people that worked outside and I was working with a...and everyday I found out\nhow to organize food. I had a friend of mine...he used to teach me how to do those things,\nand...and...once I used to go to the kitchen, and I used to pick bones and I used to pick this\nand they used to throw it out and this brought me back a little bit to my health. I felt a little\nmore stronger day by day. And this kept on...[ was in that camp...1 was 16 months. 16\nmonths! And when the Russians start to move and more they start to evacuate in all those\ncamps. So what happened? I was from the last people in that camp. There was left\nmaybe...maybe 200 from...from a lot of people, and they took us and they brought us to\nBuchenwald from that camp. Some people they took to Auschwitz, the first transport. Us, the\nlast one, they took to Buchenwald. We came to Buchenwald, it was a new world altogether.\nBecause Buchenwald was a camp, a political camp. It was not a camp like to annihilate\npeople. So the first thing, they brought us in. There was a lot of Jews from Germany, a lot of\nJews where they were already there from before, and there were a lot of Jews they were... I\nfound out that they were in the Polish Army in 1939. And they're trying to escape from the\ncamps so they took away the uniforms, and they send them to Buchenwald. So there was all\nkind of people mixed. The first thing they asked me and asked me if you were mistreated in\nthat camp. I says, \"Yes.\" \"Who mistreated you?\" I told them. We had Jewish police. We\nhad a commandant, and we had this guy, we had this guy. I told him all those guys. And not\nonly me, other people too. And somehow they took care of those people. They did. It was an\ninstance I had a guy, his name...German Jew, and he was a policemen in that camp,\nSkorjisko (ph), and I was working in that camp and I found out that when you go to 12\no'clock, he gives out food. What was his job? He was working with people they used to clean\nthe camp. You clean the camp, and you used to give out food. I saw people walking around\nwith little..how do you call it...brooms and clean. I want to get a broom like this. I had to sell\nmy bread to get a little broom from somebody. When I got that broom, I make believe I\ncleaned so I got an extra portion. This went on for couple of weeks cause I was working\nnights and during the day, I got extra food. One day, he says to me, \"Where you work?\" And\nI didn't know what to say. He says to me, \"You mean you was cheating. You were taking\nfrom me soup every day?\" Well, I said, I was hungry. He start hitting me. He beat me up so\nmuch in...1n and after this he called over to the German and he gave me 25 on the back. Just\nfor this! Now when I came to Buchenwald, I went to him and I told him, \"I told you I am\ngonna get back on you.\" And I told those people that he was mistreating me. I don't know\nwhat they did to them. They say they took him out and they killed them or they send them\naway in a different place. They didn't wanta have.that.. I was in Buchenwald quite a while,\nand...and...for maybe a couple of months, I was in Buckenwald. The food was bad because\nnobody had to eat and they didn't take us out to work. They put us in a barrack like they were\nwaiting something should happen. One day they called us out from the barrack and they\nwrote everybody's number out, and they took us in another camp. In that camp they used to\nmake bazookas, German bazookas. And I was in that camp...oh...maybe 2 or 3 months with\nGerman bazookas.",
        "Q: Do you know the name of the camp?",
        "A: Yes. Schlieben. I was then one time...I...by that thing, and working and somehow I\nremember like now, a airplane was flying over my head and I was thinking...I says, \"Oh I\nwish I am that airplane. Maybe he'll take me away someplace. And I was just thinking. All of\na sudden, the German, that guy who used to take care of all those things, and he was the\nmanager, the foreman, and he took a bazooka (he must have been drunk or something) and\nhe threw on me. And if this would explode, everybody would explode. But it hit me here,\nand it chipped off a piece of bone in mine hand. And I was bleeding profusely. And I was\nstanding like this and the blood was gushing. Still a piece of bone is chipped off. So another\nguy came and grabbed me and took me in a place to put a bandage on because they were\ntold, they shouldn't hit those boys from Buchenwald. The Germans were told that all the\npeople that came from Buchenwald shouldn't be hit. And here he did hit something like this.\nAnd I was walking around with that bandage. Next day, there was an air raid...English\nairplanes that dropped bombs on the whole plant and 300 people got killed because it blow\nup. Everything blow up. And I was that time...I wasn't working. I was in camp because of\nthat arm. Next day, we heard that all the wounded people they going to take them back to\nBuchenwald. So I went and I make believe I am wounded to, because I had a bandage. I go\nover there to that car...was a car I remember and was a big truck and was about 20 people\nsitting with blood gushing down from their hands and their feet. No bandages. They were\nsitting down, half dead. And I had a bandage on here, and I went over there and I says I am\ngonna go back in the truck, and they asked my number, and there was a doctor over there.\nHe says, \"You can't go up here.\" I says, \"Why not?\" He says, \"Because you're not wounded\nin the air raid. You were wounded in the...\" I said, \"Why do you bother...why do you worry\nabout it. Let me up on the truck just to get out from here.\" He says, \"I can't do that.\" And he\nlet me down. And when he let me down, it comes the German officer and he writes down the\nnames and everybody's gonna go in the hospital and he saw me standing here and he says,\n\"Why...why don't you go in the truck. You wounded to.\" I go up in the truck. He wrote my\nname. That...everything is a miracle. And they took me back to Buchenwald. We came back\nin that camp. They gave us a reception. They made a movie, and they claim that see what the\nEnglish pilots did to the poor...you know, all propaganda. And they gave us food. They gave\nus a meal. They goes...they gave us a bed to take. We hadn't a bed for years. Here they gave\nus a bed. They take us a shower. The first time when it was the bath, I was afraid to go in.\nBecause I was thinking...because in the hole, I remember like now there was shower, but in\nthe hole there was a big gigantic pool with some green liquid, and everybody had to go into\nthat green liquid. What was it? This was disinfection. I didn't know. Nobody know.\nEverybody was afraid to go in. Cause they think, you go in, you gonna melt and nothing will\nbe happen from you. So we were standing, and everybody used...they used to say schnell\nand everybody was afraid to go in. I personally was afraid to go in. Finally, he started taking\npeople by force and push them in, and I saw they go in and they come out. So that's how\nwe..everybody went in because they thought nothing is gonna happen. So they gave us new\nclothes. They gave us bread. They gave us a soup, and they put us in a barrack to sleep there\nuntil the doctor will came and look, so the doctor came and put a splint (my hand was bad)\nand put a splint on. This is a miracle. Put a splint on, and they tell me I shouldn't go to work\nfor a couple of days, I should stay home. I should stay in the barracks. So I was standing like\nthis, and every 3rd day I had to go to the big commander from Buchenwald. He should look\non that arm. He only felt sorry for the people who the English pilots dropped the bombs, but\nevery day they made selections and they put people to death, he didn't feel sorry for them. It\nshows to you how the mentality from the German was like this, cause they did things you\ncouldn't understand. Here, half dead people came out; they gave care; they put bandages on\nthem; they gave them food; they put them in a barrack to sleep, and the rest of the people,\nhealthy people, they took out and they put them to death because they claim the English had\nno mercy and see what they did. As a matter of fact when I was in Buchenwald, I was in the\nsame barrack with a redactor (ph), with the editor today from the Forewords. His name is\nStrigler. M., if you know, M. Strigler. He..he was the guy who gave me every day my piece\nof margarine in the barrack. I used to sleep here. He slept about three beds from me.",
        "Q: How did he get the margarine?",
        "A: How? He got...the Germans! They gave each block, let's say they had 200 people. So they\ngave 3, 4 pieces, and they had a little machine in there made from wire. If you put the block\nof margarine in that machine, you push down, so each one came out perfect square. A little\npiece! This I will never forget. And Mr. Strigler, he is the editor from the Daily Foreward, he\nwas the guy who used to cut that wire. This was in Buchenwald. From that...that...and I came\nback to Buchenwald, and this was already 44. And from Buchenwald we went to another\ncamp, uh, this is near Stuttgart. They call it Bisingen. This was very bad. Over there was\nmostly Russian prisoners of war...mostly Russia. And they didn't have no barracks like 20,\n30 people, 100 people. It was one long barrack, maybe 1,000 people can sleep there. And\nthere was no beds. You sleeped on the floor, one next to the other, one row here, one row\nhere, and you see 500, 800 people sleeping the same thing. And over there was very bad.\nThe temperature was always cold. I don't know why. It was always raining. It was always\ncold. I mean I don't if it was the time of the year, but I had no clothes on. I had just that little\npaper jacket, no underwear, wooden shoes, no socks, just a pair of pants. No hat. No hair.\nYou were standing in that cold. It was miserable every day. When you standing on appell for\n2 hours in that cold weather. And the...and the bread they used to give you on the end in the\nbarrack. So when they call your number, no name, you used to walk through thousand\npeople to get your piece of bread. And when you got hold of the piece of bread, to walking\nback to your place, they jump on you and they grab the bread out from you. So the only thing\nto do, the minute they gave you the bread, you should push it in right fast in the mouth and\nthat's the only way you could save your piece of bread. And this went on for maybe 2\nmonths...maybe 10 weeks in that camp. This was already in the end of the war. What do you\nmean the end of the war? We didn't know even that was the end of the war, but you hear\nrumors..people used to say things but this was already the beginning of 45. And that place,\nthey used to make oil from shale. You know, those stones. The operation I never saw. The\nonly thing I did is digging the shale from the mountains and loading up on lorries and\npushing the lorries to a point and over there, there was no trains. People used to stay with\nshovels...and dump it on trains or trucks and they used to take them away. And I was over\nthere until around 45, maybe February or March. After they took us away from over there\nand they took us to Dachau. That's another camp. And no change in clothes. The same\nclothes for the last 2, 3 years. If you're lucky, you had...they survived. If not, somebody died\nor you saw somebody laying there, you take off his jacket and you put it on, and that's how I\nkept kept going on. And they took us to Dachau. We came into Dachau. I don't have too\nmuch recollection from Dachau because I think I had a very bad cold, and I had headaches. I\ndon't know what happened. It was just a cold or something. But I couldn't concentrate very\nmuch because I remember I had a friend what I always stick with him and somehow I lost\nhim. He disappeared.",
        "Q: Talk about him a little bit.",
        "A: About my friend?",
        "Q: About your friend.",
        "A: Oh, he was a friend what I met. He was from the home yet a friend. He lived about two\nfloors above me and his name was Landau. His father died in the beginning of the war. He\nleft with the mother. And we stuck together, to each other most of the time. Most of the time\nbe together, and once there was a time that somehow he was taken away in another place,\nmaybe 10 miles and by miracle he came back. And we stuck... But this time in Dachau, I\ndon't know what happened through a...or he was taken away in another place. We just split\nand I don't know what happened to him? I really don't know. And from Dachau we...that was\nthe time when that was so bad, we actually didn't know if you gonna get up next day. Cause\nthey didn't give us food. They didn't give us water. There was no cooking. Absolutely\nnothing! And about a week later, they tell us all to get out from the barracks and we gonna\nmarch. We marched about 2 days. I don't know where that is in the woods. I don't know\nwhere it was, and they put us on trains.",
        "Q: Before you get on the train, tell me about the march first please.",
        "A: Well, the march was like this. We walked about 8, 6 people abreast. And let's say 50 people\nin a column and if there...there was...there was like a distance, maybe 3 or 4 feet, there were\ntwo SS going in the back and two SS in the front. And the rifles were always aimed on the\npeople, and we walked. And who couldn't walk because of lacking of food or water or\nsomething happened to him...he got sick, he get shot immediately. There was no mercy. Get\nup or carry you. And if they see somebody was carrying or dragging, you both get shot. So\nsomehow we walked. You can hear only the clap clap from the wooden shoes, and we\nwalked, let's say, maybe a day, maybe a day and a half. And I...1f you tell me where I was, I\ncouldn't tell you. I... know we was...how far can we walk? But you were Jjust...your mind\nwas on blank. I mean, there was no thinking anymore. And we walked and we came to a\nplace, there was standing maybe 15 or 20 trains, cars, cattle cars. And they told us to sit\ndown and take a rest. We sit down and we rested, and everybody was screaming water, you\nknow this. And the minute we said something, right away they take the rifles and shoot in the\nair. And in that thing there was not only SS. There was a lot of Ukrainian soldiers what they\nwere guarding some camp or something and they wore those uniforms, and they were very\nmean, very mean. They pushed us in the cars. Somehow I went to a place. I was laying\nagainst the wall, and it was so bad because after 3 days nothing to have in your mouth..\nNothing! And I figured that thety are going to starve us out or something, so they're trying to\nrun the trains. We went into the trains. You can see only the sky. The trains were open.\nThere was just wire on the top. And I was very delirious...delirious. I mean I really don't\nknow at that time what happened, I mean. And I was laying in the train . And I didn't feel\neven hungry any more. You know you get to the point, the end of the line you don't feel\nanything. And we went in that train maybe a day...a day and a half. All of a sudden I hear the\nGerman soldiers they jumping off the train, they going on the train, they stopping the train\nlike there's something going on, and they didn't know what. So one soldier, he was already\nan elderly man because the youngsters were away already. The youngsters were sitting on\nthe roof and the old guys, they were sitting in the train with us to guard. He says, \"You know\nyour President died.\" That's the time when Roosevelt died. \"Your President.\" in German he\nsaid it. I mean you couldn't even make it out what 1t means your president died. I mean I\ndidn't know if the president was a Roosevelt. I didn't know those things. But the way he said\nit, \"Your President died.\" Now..and this was like in the afternoon. I remember like it's\ngetting dark, so we trying to ask the soldier, \"Where are we going?\" He says he doesn't\nknow...he doesn't know. And he was sitting and eating, cutting the bread and eating, and here\nwere people sitting and starving. And the night the same thing. The train stopped. All the\nsoldiers go down from the train. After they come back to the train, there's something going\non they didn't know what happened. Next day in the morning, we saw all the soldiers with no\ninsignia anymore. No insignia. Everybody you noticed that is the same. There was no\nofficers. There was no sergeants. There was no thing. Everybody had no insignias. The\nuniform had no insignias. We didn't know what happened. We didn't understand what it\nmeans. Now...now we realize what it means. And this was April the 30th, 1945. And this\nwas a town named Staltah (ph). This is maybe 30 miles from Munich. And you imagined the\ntrain was going around in circles. They didn't know what to do with us. One probably says\nwe shoot them, one says no, one says the Americans are coming probably. They didn't know\nwhat to do with us. That's the reason...1t's only 30, 40 miles distance and they traveled 2 days\njust around the clock. I was sitting in the train and all of a sudden the train was standing on\nthe top and the bottom was the highway, and we saw the tanks coming. And this was\nAmerican tanks. And we saw the stars and all the soldiers...the German soldiers saw that,\nthey start jumping from the train. They dropped their rifles and they started running. Well,\neverybody from the train...barely we opened the doors because the doors were closed. We\nopened the doors. They weren't locked. We opened the doors. Nobody could get out because\nit was so high to jump. And here you got half dead people. If this will take another day,\nnobody will be alive in those trains without food. So they start falling out like this, who got\nhurt, and they started rolling down to the ravine, all the way down to the bottom where the\ntanks were coming. So I said to a guy, \"Push me.\" So he pushed me out and the same thing.\nJust keep rolling like this until the end and I stopped. And here the tanks are coming. I just\nremember like now, a guy came over from the tank. He came over to me and he says to\nme...I don't know if he spoke German or half English...if I am alright. I says yes, and I says\nwasser_, wasser_, means water. He took that field tank and he gave me some water and he\nsays, \"I ama Jew.\" I says, \"Yes.\" He says, \"I am a Jew too.\" And he says...and he took off\na mezuzah he had and he put it on me, and he says (sobbing) \"You're gonna live,\" he says.\nHe took out a chocolate and he gave me and he says in Yiddish, '\"___ I have a job to do. Iam\nbusy. The war is still on, and I can't take care of you. He says, \"I leave you here and\nsomebody will come after (sobbing) and take you.\" I was laying there on the ground maybe\n2 hours and all the tanks passed by and soldiers and trucks and jeeps and they didn't care\nabout the people because they're going to the front. And maybe 2, 3 hours later, probably\nthe...those people they clean up, you know...they reserved for this...or the medical corps, and\nthey saw what happened (sobbing) What a sight! What a sight! You see thousands,\nhundreds of people laying half dead. A young man had that body they moved, and I\nremember I was laying there on this guy says and he said, \"Oh my God, what a sight!\"\n(sobbing) They start picking up the people (sobbing). The picked them up one by one. Most\nof them were dead because they could... And the water...and those that were alive they put\nthem in trucks and jeeps, and they took them to hospitals or they made tents and they put\nthem in. They gave them water. They gave them packets from the Red Cross. And this was\nbad too because people when they got those packages, there was powdered milk, there was\nchocolate; there was a can of meat, and they were so hungry, they didn't care and they ate it.\nSo hundreds died from eating this stuff, because their stomach was no used to food. And I\nhad a guy next to me...I don't know if he was a doctor once or something...he was half dead\ntoo. When he got that package...and I think he was Hungarian or Rumanian...he says to me,\n\"Don't eat nothing. Don't eat nothing. If you gonna eat anything, you gonna die. The only\nthing you do, if you have sugar, take the sugar in the mouth and suck on the sugar. That's\nthat the only thing you should do, he says, the rest of them throw away. And if you want to\nkeep it, keep it, but don't eat anything. Don't take the milk in your mouth. Don't take the\nchocolate. Don't take the meat because they used to give you a can of meat, Spam. Don't eat\nit, because if you're gonna eat it, you're gonna die. And that's what happened. Those people,\nthey eat the stuff, they got diahrrea and they died. So what I do and I had that sugar, Domino\nsugar, the little tiny pieces, and I used to suck on that sugar. I was so hungry I could eat an\nelephant. But he said to me, \"You're gonna die if you're gonna eat it,\" this guy. Well, this guy\ndied. Yah, he died next day. He died not from eating. He died because he Jjust...just his heart\nstopped. He just died. And this guy saved me because he said, \"Don't eat anything. Just suck\non the sugar.\" And that's what I did. And for 2 days I laid there. They didn't give us no food.\nThey used to give us cereal. A bowl of cereal everyday. That's the only food. And they used\nto say to the people, \"Don't eat this stuff because...\" People didn't listen because they were\nso hungry. And after a while, they gave us start giving us a piece of bread and like a little\nbaby, they nudge us back to normality, like a little child. Here you see people after they\ngave us a little piece of bread. The next day they give us a little piece of soup. You\nknow...cereal soup. No soup with meat and all that stuff. And little by little, you know, you\nget back. And I was in that tent maybe a week. And after...and they didn't give us clothes. No\nclothes. I still was laying in the same thing. The only thing I have is a Army blanket. You\nknow those green blankets. After this, and this was, let's say about near Munich someplace,\nand after the sanitar corps went away there too. There is nobody there. Because the war is\nstill on. It was not the 8th of May yet. That was the 2nd of May, the 3rd of May. But they\nwere nice to us. You know they still say to us...a lot of Jews was there and they still say,\n\"There's the front and we have to leave you and the only thing what was in those tents was\ntwo men and they were taking care of those tents. And left us tents, and the German from\nthis town had to come every day and clean those tents out and all that stuff. And after the\nGerman had to come and dig a big hole and they buried all the dead people that was laying\naround the train. It was a sight! It was a sight because the train was on top, and the bottom\nwas the highway, and the people used to go from the train like this, falling down and you see\nall hanging on the bushes, near a tree, in the grass, and you see men and women, and small\nmen, and large men. Everybody was laying spread over. They were dead. They were just\ncouldn't...they just couldn't hold it on anymore. The minute the train opened up, you see all\nfalling out. They were half...every car had half dead people inside. Like I told you, only\nyoung people could have survived. Only the youngsters. And after this, me and one more\nguy went over there. We took our little strength and we says, \"We're gonna walk to a town.\nAnd we walked in that uniforms. We felt more strength, and I remember like now we came\nto a house with a German woman inside, and she saw us and she started running. She run\naway. She saw both of us and we wore striped uniforms. We walked in that house. What a\nbeautiful house. All kind of china, with closets with clothes. First thing I did I took off my\nthings. I took out a shirt, and I put on a shirt. This is the first time in 3, 4 years I had a shirt\non my back. Shoes I couldn't find, but I found a pair of rubber shoes. I put on the rubber\nshoes. And a pair of pants. And after I saw her looking and I hollered to her, \"Come here.\nYou know what I need some food, you know, to eat.\" So she gave us some food. But I saw\nher looking outside. She looked...she looked outside. I don't know what it was. And there\nwas a dog house. And what do you think? In the dog house, there was a little girl, maybe 4\nyears old. She was...she hid. I went to her and I says, \"Do you think I am going to harm you\nlittle girl? Do you think I am going to be just like you people were? I am not going to harm\nyou, little girl. You don't have to hide on the dog house.\" She didn't say a word, you know,\nwhen I said this to her. But this little girl was laying in that dog house hidden because she\nthought that...because this what they did to us, we're gonna to do to them. And the same\nthing is when the Germans threw away those rifles by the train, I couldn't have picked up a\nrifle and killed all I wanted. I couldn't even move. I couldn't even pick that rifle up from the\nground. Probably maybe if I could, I would have feel maybe I would do it. I couldn't even\ndo this. I couldn't even lift up the rifle that was laying on the ground because first of all they\nare very heavy and second of all, I am not the type to kill anybody or to shoot. First,\nin...1n...especially when the war was going on, you could have walked around in every home\nand do anything you wanted. Nobody did those things. Nobody did any revenging and\nkilling just for no reason at all. I don't remember those things. And I saw people like\nme...there was no men, only women and children, because older men were in the war.\nNobody did any revenge . And after this, they took us...yah, the MPs stopped us...2\nMPs... Yes...and asked where are we going. So I told him we were on a field hospital from\nthe army and now we gonna go. We're looking for friends or family. You know, do you say,\n\"That's the only thing you had on your mind.\" So they say, \"You can't do that. You are not\nallowed. No. You're now allowed to do this.\" That was just war time. You are not allowed\nto do this. So they took us, put us in a jeep, and took us away, and point was already more\npeople over there. And this was that Camp Felderink. (ph) This was in the time...when in that\ncamp was still the German Army was still living in those barracks. So, the American Army\nwants to put us in over there. There was 30 people. So we said, \"We are not gonna live with\nthem. You chase them out. You chase them out, we're gonna go in. We're not gonna stay\nwith them.\" So anyway, they went out, and they moved us in. And that's how that camp\nstarted to become a camp. That's how that camp Felderink started to become a camp for DP.\nYou know a lot of people came from all kind liberation camps and they put them in..in that\ncamp. And there was other camps, not only Felderink. There was Saltzheim (ph). There was\nLandsberg. There was, uh, oh, there was a lot of them all around, you know. All those people\nthat were liberated from the Army. And after awhile you start... even right after the\nliberation, people right away starting to...to make committee, to start learning, to make a\nnewspaper. There was printing a newspaper. Right away they're looking for libraries and I\nremember like now, there was a newspaper printed with...with German ABC, but it's written\nin Yiddish, because there was no Yiddish words in Germany. And who was doing this? The\nGermans were printing that newspaper. And all kind of little things shows to you that's how\nfast the people...the Jewish people raising up from the ashes, and right away they start\nbuilding up a home. And some people got married. Some people find girlfriends. Some\npeople travel to Poland to see if anybody is alive. Some people went to another camps and\nput little names on the walls. I am looking for this and this and this man and maybe you saw\nmy sister. Her name was like this. Maybe you saw my father. I was in a camp with them.\nAnd any place you went, you saw hundreds and hundreds of little pieces of paper written\ndown with names in case somebody saw somebody. And that's what kept us going to look.\nMaybe you'll find somebody. Oh, did you see this? Or where is this? And maybe you found\nsomebody. Oh yes, I saw him over there this camp. Right away, you went and you...you\nwent by train or by somebody to this camp and look up. What that means after 5 years of\ntorture! What we went through for no reason at all. Only thing is because you were born\nJewish. The...they say...uh...1 remember for instance in the time when I went from the\nghetto...one for instance, and I was in the ghetto and I was working for a person in the\nghetto. I was a kid. He paid me 20 Zlotys a week. He collected schmettes from those tailors,\nlittle leftovers. He made big veils, and he give this...he sold it to the Germans. Not he sold\nit...this was his job. And I was working for him, so one day we loaded up a full truck of those\nthings and we have to take them to the German place, and he had a piece of paper that's to let\nus out from the ghetto. And a woman used to have the piece of paper. She carried the piece\nof paper for six people. And this was around Christmas 1940 or 41. And I saw Polish people\nthat were dancing. Christmas is coming. Everybody...the stores are nice, decorated and here\nthe people being laying on the street swollen from hunger...we haven't got a piece of bread to\neat...and everyday they take out thousands of people and they bury them in mass graves and\nhere on the other side of the world, life goes on like it's a normal thing. Life went on so\nnormal. And...and one day, that woman must have went shopping. She left that standing on\nthe street, and here we stand 6 people. I remember like now. Six people destined to death,\nand here that woman walked away with a piece of paper. And what will happen if any\nGerman comes along and asks what we're doing here, and we're going to tell him that some\nwoman that has a piece of paper and this piece of paper says these six people have a right to\nstay here. So that means 6 people's lives depends on a little piece of paper. That was our\ndestiny. So finally that woman came. It was like Mesiah came. So that's...",

        "Q: Could you tell me your name please?",
        "Q: Let's not get to the war yet? Yes. Let's take a little time. I would like to find a little more. Tell\nme about your parents?",
        "Q: My parents were very young people. I guess my father, when the war broke out, he was only\n37 years old, and my mother must have been 34 years old when the war broke out. I had\nthree sisters. I had three sisters...let's say, when the war broke out, one sister was 13, one\nwas 11, one was 9. They all went to school, and we came from a middle class family. What I\nmean middle class, mine father was running the factory, mine grandfather owned. We owned\na factory in Warsaw that was very well known. It was called Firma Baranek. This was\nlocated on Nalevki 35. The first floor was the factory, and downstairs was the store when we\nsold...we used to manufacture women's underwear, men's shirt, winter clothing for people,\nand we used to buy the raw merchandize in lots in Poland and they supply to us, and we used\nto have cutters and machines and we make the stuff. And my father ran all the factory. We\nused to have probably about 20 people, or 25 people working inside. And I guess I was a\nlittle boy that time. I didn't know what money means, but I guess we were pretty good off. I\nmean, I had shoes, I had clothes, and summertime, we used to go away in the country once in\na while, so probably we weren't that bad off. And I guess my father...grandfather was better\noff. I remember he took trips to Israel.

        "A: My name is Abraham Lewent. This is mine original name. I was born in Warsaw, Poland,\nJuly 1924. I came from a family from many, many sisters and brothers and cousins and\nuncles and aunts. And we lived in Warsaw for many, many years. Even my great\ngrandparents came from that town. I lived mostly in the Jewish section of Warsaw. Uh, to be\nspecific, I lived...my parents and me, my sisters lived on Zamenhof Street. I went to school. I\nwent to a cheder (ph), and a Yiddish school, and matter of fact, I went to a cheder with the\nfamous Mila 18, and that was the place I went in a cheder. On the first floor, this was\nalready, when I was about maybe 12...11, 12 years old. After I changed schools and I went to\na school on Niska 4, and this was a school run by, I think, by some, uh, party, or...it was a\nreligious school. That was not the thing. And that school I went until the war broke out. And\nI remember this was September Ist.\nyears ago, and I met people who ran away from Poland in 1956 when they chased them\nout...the Gomulka Regime, and I met a couple of people what actually they knew mine\ngrandfather. And we happened to talk about Warsaw, and I asked the person...he asked me,\n\"Where did you live?\" And I said I lived there, but I had a grandfather living over there.\nAnd he says, \"You mean to tell me Mothai was your grandfather? I used to go in. I used to\nbuy kerosene with him. I used to buy soap by him. I used to buy shoelaces by him. And this\nwas your grandfather! And Esther was your grandmother!\" I says, \"Yes.\" (Sobbing,\nSobbing, Sobbing)",
        "A: So after this, we started talking about it.",
        "A: Yah.",
        "A: And that picture is my grandfather. That picture which you have in your hand. This was him.",
        "A: Yah.",
        "A: Okay. When the Germans came in, my father...I mean actually we were...we had no food in\nthe house. It was not like here. You had always something in the house. In Europe,\neverything you need, you used to go out every day in the store, and you used to buy. When\nthe war broke out, the water was cut off. There was no gas in the house to cook anything.\nThere was no food. So my father used to go out once in a while and we used to get some\nbread or the necessary things. And I remember for a couple of weeks, we lived just on sour\npickles because not far where we used to live, a couple of streets, there was a factory, they\nused to produce pickles. A Polish factory! And they call it Original, and they used to have\nthe pickles in tents like...small tents, and large ones. As I found out, so I went with a friend\nof mine and somehow we got in to that building in the night, even when the bombs were\nfalling and we used to run in the middle of the night and we grabbed about 6 or 8 cans, about\n5 pounds and we dragged it home, and this we lived for a couple of weeks. Just on pickles!\nAnd once in a while, we got bread. But we had some rice. So we had rice and pickles. And\nthis went on for...for weeks. There were houses burning. I mean it was...to describe a regular\nhell, because there was no water to douche the fires out, so the only thing they did was let the\nfires go. It just happened the house we lived that nothing happened. Like next house, third\nhouse, in the night when it stopped, people used to go out from the houses and look for\nsomething to eat. And this kept on for 4 weeks. When the Germans came in, so they didn't\nknow what's going to happen. New rules. New Regime. They first thing they did, they made\na curfew. You are not allowed to walk the street. But still there was no food. So the only\nthing they did was on the corner someplace like it happens someplaces, they used to have\nfield kitchens, and they used to give to the people bread and salamis. This is the truth. Right\nwhen they walked in. I found this it out through a friend of mine. When you go over there,\nlet's say maybe 3 miles, 4 miles, there 1s a field kitchen. You gonna go over there, you gonna\nget something. I remember like now I took my older sister. We walked and we walked\nand...and still the fires were on both sides, but the war was ended already. They occupied the\ncity. We came over there. We saw a line of people, and we stood in the line for that bread\nand the salami and sometime they gave you two breads. When I got to the line, a Pole...a\nPolish kid came out and said to the German, \"He's Jude.\" You know like...the German didn't\neven know that time...he didn't make any difference between a Jew and not a Jew; but the\nPolish kids, they were pointing out to the Germans, like \"Don't give it to him. He's a Jew.\"\nSo now they got the way... So the German couldn't do anything, I mean. So he chased us\naway. So when he chased us away, we stood again. So now, the Polish kids, they chased us\naway and they grabbed all the bread, and all the things. So we had to go home without bread\nand without anything. And it was a fact that we had to go carry water from the Vistula, from\nthe river; and this is like 4 miles. So we took 2 pails of water. Me and my sister took 2 pails\nof water, and we walked. We carried the pails so when we had to pass by a Polish\nneighborhood, those Polish kids came out and picked up the pails of water and threw it out\nand make us walk back. Now this is in a time when the Germans took over the city. Every\ncitizen was on his own, and they know they lost their country. Still the hatred. The anti-\nSemitism those Polish people had toward the Jews. For no reason at all! Now they felt that\nthey can do with the German help what they always want to do. And here they got somebody\nto point out he's a Jew's and he's a this, and he's a that, and when they walked around with\nthe water, they used to turn the water out from those kids, cause elderly people couldn't carry\nthat far pails of water. So this went on for a couple of weeks. You know with that thing.\nFinally, the occupation was starting, and they started giving you anti-Jewish laws, and I\nremember like now, in November, I think it was in November or September, there was a\nstreet in Warsaw, the Nalevki. And somehow a Polish...a German soldier got shot. I don't\nknow how or why. This is the first ttme I heard about it. They took out 53 people from that\nbuilding, men, women, children, and they killed them instantly. This is maybe 2 weeks after\nthey walked in....1n the town. And...and I don't now that...what happened with that soldier,\nhow he got shot over there, and this was in the Jewish district, you know, and they took out\n53 people and they killed them. And since then everybody knew that something terrible is\ngoing to happen to the Jewish people in that District. Now what happened to our place 1s that\nthe German's find out about my grandfather's factory and the store, so every day you see\ntrucks came in and they loaded up. They cleaned out little by little everything. My father and\nmy grandfather, we grabbed some stuff and we kept it in the house. Not much because you\ncouldn't grab too much. And little by little, they cleaned out the warehouse, they cleaned out\nthe factory. They took away the machines. Everything they loaded up in truck, and I don't\nknow where they had it. So from that little merchandize, what we saved from that factory,\nwe lived awhile. We sold little by little and somehow this kept us going for let's say, maybe 2\nyears, you know. And after...this was around 1941...1942. 1941 or 42 it start getting very\nbad, because the ghetto was closed in. They made a wall around the ghetto. I had to wear a\narm band with the star of David. Say everybody, even the smallest children...my littlest\nsister, a little tiny girl...she had to walk out on the street, she had a arm band, you know, with\na...with a star of David. And everybody in the house had always ready, uh, how you say a\nrucksack with a piece of bread, some stuff, in case something happened every kid will be\nprotected. That was my father's idea. We don't know what's going to happen. First day here,\nthey clean out this street. They clean out this street. You walk out in the street. You don't\nknow if you gonna come back, because they ...you walk on the street and they need 100\npeople to go to work, they grab you and you don't...they don't know what happened to you.\nWhen we lived in that building, we lived near a courtyard. One time each house had like a\ncommittee, and they were directing all the rules. One time there was a meeting and they said\nthey need 35 people to go to work. So who'll they take? Elderly people, they can't take. The\nyoungsters they can't take, so they took 17, 18, 19 year old people. And from that house by\nus, we had to give them 3 people. So each house, like 10 building, used to give 30 people.\nAnd 3 people that went, 18, 19, they were 6 weeks away. When they came back, nobody\nrecognized them. Each one was swelling. I remember that I had a friend. His name was\nSchemick. He came back. His feet, his hand, his head were twice the size from the beating,\nfrom the undernourishment those people had. What did they do? They dig some kind of dam\nin the water. They were standing all day long in the water in digging the ground, and from\nthis they got swelling, and they were undernourished, and this kid lived about 2 weeks after\nthey send him home he died because he was so sick. And this kept on like this, and my father\nwas still home. My mother was still home. My sisters were home, and still we went\nsome...and...in time of the night, we had schooling, like people made a school for 3, 4\nchildren. They shouldn't forget what they learn, and we had libraries. We went in the\nlibraries. We read books. We still think sometime sometime will get better. In the\nmeanwhile, we had...there was a Polish newspaper. Actually it was a newspaper where the\nGerman printed but in Polish language, and this was smuggled in in the ghetto and we read\nit. We heard only about the Germans winning the war and they win this and this and this. We\ndidn't know anything. The radios was not allowed to have because they took all the radios\nfrom the Jewish people. They took away one night and made a decree, everybody has a\nradio, fall coats, good clothes, this has to be given away. And we didn't have no news\nactually what happened on the other side of the world. And this went on like this until 1942.\n42 came the big day when they start staying to the people well, we need people to go Ost\n[NB: to the east], means for work. And the hunger in the ghetto was so great, was so bad,\nthose people were laying on the streets and dying, little children went around begging, and,\nuh, everyday you walked out in the morning, you see somebody is laying dead, covered with\nnewspapers or with any kind of blanket they found, and you found those people used to carry\nthe death people in little wagons, used to bring them down to the cemetery and bury them in\nmass graves. And every day thousands and thousands died just from malnutrition because\nthe Germans didn't give anything for the people in the ghetto to eat. There was no such thing.\nYou couldn't walk in and buy anything or getting any rations. It's your pot luck. If you don't\nhave it, you die, and that's what it was. Finally when they start bringing people out from the\nghetto, they promised the people, if you gonna leave the ghetto, we'll give you 3...3 pounds\nof bread and, uh, a can of marmalade and sugar and stuff like this. And if you just register,\nyou want to go to work. Some people if they heard that word, 3 pounds of bread and\nmarmalade and sugar, they didn't care what's going to happen to them. They just went and\nthey signed up. Actually, it's not signed up because when they...when they went to that place,\nthey got the bread and the marmalade and you see every day women, children walking to\nthat place, Umschlagplatz, and get the 3 breads. And they pushed them into the trains; and\nthey pushed in so many people in the trains that they actually couldn't eat that bread. There\nwas no room even to cut the bread. So what happened. Well, they send them to Treblinka.\nThe trains came back with the same bread because in the trains they used to put in 350 to 400\npeople in a cattle car and you had standing room only. You couldn't even sit. You couldn't\neven stand. You were just pressed like sardines. So the bread and the marmalade when the\npeople had it in their hands, it was still in their hands because when they get to destination in\nTreblinka, they had to undress and they had to leave everything. So the same breads and the\nsame marmalade came back for the new transport. And this went on constantly. Now the\n22nd of July 1942, that was the day when I was home and there was, uh, a...a raid. The SS\ncame, start shooting, start hollering everybody down, everybody down in the court yard, and\nI said to my mother, \"What we gonna do?\" So she says, \"You don't have to worry. I got a\npaper. Your daddy works.\" My father was working as a mechanic in a...1n the ghetto for\nthe...for the...in the factory they used to make fur coats for the German flyers...for the pilots.\nSo he was like taking care of all the machineries and she has a paper that her husband works\nfor the Germans so she says, \"Don't worry, I mean.\" I says, \"But I have to worry because I\nam over 17. And if they see me, they will grab me.\" So she says, \"Don't worry. You go\nhide.\" So I was hiding in the house and she went downstairs with my 3 sisters. Everybody\nwas having that...that thing on the back of the thing with a piece of bread with a...with a\nschmatles (ph) inside. I don't know what they keep inside. And that's how they went\ndownstairs. And this is the...the last time I saw them. Because the Germans even if they saw\nthe paper, they just took the paper like this and ripped it apart and they took them out. That\ntime they took about 10,000 people to the place Umschlagplatz took the people to Treblinka.\nI was laying, hidden in a room on the top of the ceiling. They made like a blind room. If you\nwouldn't know it, you wouldn't know it's a room. But it's actually was like a hideaway on the\ntop of the ceiling. And I was laying there, and I heard the Germans came into the house and\nthey take them out downstairs, and I was laying there. I didn't know what to do, what to say.\nAnd I figured because of the paper, he's going to read the paper and he's going to say, \"Oh,\nwell, and he's going to let him stay.\" And he tell them to go downstairs. In the courtyard,\nthere was already hundreds of people like this, and they took them away. This was around 5\no'clock or 6 o'clock in the evening. And this was that day on July 1942. And another thing\nhappened. If they have, uh, a norm. That means they need 10,000 people every day, and if\nthey had 8,000, they just went around on the street and just grabbed everybody who comes\nalong to make the 10,000 up. And that's what probably happened that day. They needed a\ncouple of hundred more, and...and where we used to live was only about 10, 15 minutes\nfrom their Umshagplatz where all the trains went to Treblinka, so the first thing they did, ran\ninto those court yards, and they grabbed the people. And after this, uh, 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock,\nmy father came home and I told him what happened and I said to him, \"Well, I...1...I can't be\nhere anymore.\" You know, like I just can't find myself a place. First of all, I says you go\naway in the morning to work. I have to stay here by myself. And I don't know what can\nhappen. Any minute they can grab me too because I have no papers. I don't work. And if\nyou don't have no papers, you don't work. It's just like, uh, you don't exist. So I don't know\nwhat to do. So I spoke... had a friend of mine...a kid I went to school with him, and he told\nme, \"There is a guy who lives next house, and he works on the on the airport in Warsaw for\nthe Germans and he says for a couple... for some money he can arrange...that he can have a\nfew people going to work in the airport. This 1s a good job, and you can stay there and at\nleast you're going to be safe a little bit. I told this to my father and I said to him, you know,\nwe're going to need 2 or 3 thousand zlotys to pay off this guy cause this guy is going to pay\noff a German. And in that book I gave you is the whole story from that thing, but I just gonna\ntell you what happened. That's...some day he came. My father gave him the money. I took\nwith me...I remember like now...I took with me a leather briefcase. I took with me maybe\n200 zlotys. That's all there was left, and I took with me some underwear and tfillin. My\nfather says, \"You take this.\" And I went because I was Bar mitzvah year before. So I didn't\nhave a chance even to wear it. He says, \"Take it with you.\" So I went and I took this. And I\nremember like now the guy took us and we walked on the street in the ghetto...what nobody\nis allowed to walk, but he had a paper from the...from the...from the German Air Force, that\nhe's bringing some people to work for the airplanes or something, so... And I saw these\nGerman SS. They're walking around and looking at us, see somebody and here they see four\npeople walking in the middle of the street with any kind of fear with this look in them, so one\nsoldier came over he asks for Ausweiss, so we showed him the paper and he says, \"Go\nahead.\" If you walked about about maybe 20 minutes and after I saw...I was there, I saw a\nGerman in an air force uniform waiting for us. He had half a hand because he must have\nbeen shot or something, so he's got...one arm was loose and he came over and he spoke to\nthis guy and the says to him, three guys. He put us in a street car, you know,\nbecause a Jew was not allowed to ride the street car. And here we got those things you know\nbecause we are afraid to take it off. So he said to us, \"We should take them off and he 1s\ngoing to stay with us, and he paid for us on the street car, those tickets, and we went all the\nway to Okence (ph). Okence (ph) is like Kennedy Airport from New York, you know, like.\nAnd I was over there...1n Okence (ph), I was over there 16 weeks. RIght. I was in Okence\n(ph) from May...No...from July, August...No. I went to Okence (ph)... went August,\nSeptember, November...3 months....4 months...16 weeks. And we didn't know what\nhappened to the ghetto. We know that there's no people left over there. Everybody is out. I\ndidn't know what happened to my father. I didn't know anything. And I was there 16 weeks,\nand we worked by coal. We unload wagons of coal for the Germans used to use for heating\nup the systems and some wagons of coals went to Germany. So this was mine job, to unload\nand load coals. And once we clean airplanes...once in a while they took us to clean out the\nairplanes, the military airplanes, little things like this, not major stuff. And they used to feed\nus, maybe 2 slices of bread a day and a soup, a watery soup. But we had good quarters to\nsleep because in those quarters used to sleep the soldiers and this was an empty barrack so\nwe had to sleep, we had good quarters. There's no... We had a little bed with a mattress. This\nis very unusual and, uh, the only thing was no was no food. So that money that I have, a\ncouple of hundred zlotys, this lasts me for awhile to buy myself, and over there where we\nused to go to work, I used to take coal. I used to stuff myself in mine coat, and the coat used\nto weigh 20 pounds because I used to cut out the underline and used to stuff with coals.\nWhen I walked from the...from the air field back to the barracks, I used to ask the soldiers,\nthe German air force...they weren't that bad...the air force. They weren't that bad because\nthey probably were not indoctrinated like the German SS or the Gestapo, so I used to say to\nhim, \"You see how dirty I was. (in German) I have to buy soap to wash my face.\" He said,\n\"Sure.\" So they used to walk slow. I used to run across the street. There was little stores\nfrom Polish people. They have little stores. They used to sell bread. They used to sell soap.\nThey used to sell candies. And I used to go in and I used to say in Polish to them, \"You want\na coal.\" Oh, they were...they went crazy, because they weren't allowed to have coal. I mean\nthe Germans took everything away. And I used to walk like this. I bend down, I scouped\neverything up, put in the pail and they gave me sometimes...they gave me a half a bread.\nSometimes they gave me some a piece of salami. Sometime they gave me some candies.\nSometimes a pack of cigarettes. I mean, that's all I need. I didn't need no money. I need to\nbargain with them. I need to deal with them. And this went on for quite awhile. Once I heard\nthere's people starting to run away, from that camp, and I says, \"Where do they running?\"\nThey found out that some people still live in the ghetto. And I didn't know what to do. I\ndidn't know where to run...to who to run. And this every night, I used to sleep and I used to\nthink how will I get out from here. Maybe my father's still alive. Maybe my mother came\nback. Who knows? And I was a young kid at that time. I was a baby. I was 16 years old, I\nmean I didn't know even how to think straight. But once it was winter...1t was very cold. Was\ndark already when we walked back. I heard a Pole calling my name. He was standing on the\nsidewalk. And we walked to the middle of the road like to the sidewalk, and he called my\nname. He says in Polish, \"Is there a Lewent here?\" And my name in Poland 1s Levent, not\nLewent. And I heard that, I says \"Yes,\" and I started to run to him and the German thought I\nam going to run away, he walloped me with a rifle right in my stomach and I fell right down.\nSo the Pole, he saw that he said, he's going to be back tomorrow. Like this. I went home and\nI couldn't sleep anymore. I didn't know what to do. I really hurt. This is the first time I saw\nthem hitting somebody. He thought I am going to runaway you know because he saw me\nrunning out from the line of people and after that, tomorrow, the same time, he's there. He\ncalls me. That time, I was smarter. I kept myself to the end, not in the middle, and to the end,\nand I said to him, \"I am going to go buy something.\" And he went and he gave me a piece of\npaper...put me a end a piece of paper. And I grabbed a hold of piece of paper like this, and I\nwent back in the line. I came in the barracks. I opened up the piece of paper. My father wrote\nme a letter, and he says that he is in ghetto. He still works in the same place. And I shouldn't\ntry to escape. He's gonna get me somebody to take me out and bring me to him. And this was\nin December 1940...42. I couldn't wait. After 1 day...after the second day or the third day,\nnobody shows up. It's a week already, nobody shows up. So I says...I said to my friend,\nLandau, I says, \"You know I am gonna...1 am gonna run away.\" He says, \"Don't do it.\nThey're gonna shoot you. Don't do it, you know.\" I says, \"No, I'll figure out something.\" So\none night I remember like now, it was about Thursday. This was the 30th of December\nbefore New Years, between Christmas and New Years. And I did the same trick. I had coals\nwith me, and I was dirty black, the face and the hands, you know, like anything...and I asked\nthe same guy. He was an elderly man. And I said to him, \"I'm gonna buy soap to wash\nmyself.\" And he says, \"Go ahead\" \"Come right back,\" he says. \"Come right back.\" I went\nover there and I got all these coals, and at that time, she says to me...the woman, she says to\nme in Polish, \"No,\" she says, \"Little boy, what do you want today? Do you wanta bread or\nyou wanta milk?\" I said, \"No. I need some money today.\" She said, \"I can't give you no\nmoney, you know.\" I says, \"I'll tell you what. For the whole thing, just give me two dollars--\ntwo zlotys. I am going to have fare on the street car. I didn't tell her this. So she took out and\nshe gave it to me. But she gave me change. That's what I needed. And I went and...I never\nwent back to the formation, and I walked...I was dark. I was dirty, so they didn't recognize\nme, and I took off this. This was the worse thing I did. You should never take this off. And I\nwent and I jumped on a street car and I didn't go inside, you know, so to speak. The street car\nwas on the end...the end...and I turned my face and I gave that lady 30 groszen (ph), and I\nsays, \"I am gonna...because I have to take another one. I remember now what street car to\ntake. She didn't say. She gave me a ticket, and I was standing and standing and standing.\nThen I said to myself, \"Oh, I wish it's over. It's over again.\" And I went with this street car\nabout maybe 10 blocks, 20 blocks. Next to me there was a Pole standing, and I remember\nlike now, he was a little hunchback and he had, uh, a sack. Maybe it was garbage inside or\nsomething, and I saw he looks at me, he looks at me, he looks at me, and I tried to turn my\nface away, and he keeps looking. Finally, he got right next to me, and he says to me in\nPolish, \"What are you doing here.\" I didn't answer. I make believe I didn't hear him. And he\nsays again, \"What are you doing here.\" Finally, he got violent. He did it like this to me, you\nknow. \"What are you doing here?\" So, I says to him, \"What do you mean what am I doing\nhere?\" you know In Polish I says, \"I am going home.\" He says, \"Don't give me that\nbologna, Jidek (ph),\" you know. This is in Polish. \"Don't give me that bologna like what are\nyou doing here? You know, you see that, uh, gendarme outside. I am gonna turn you in.\"\nAnd when you turn in somebody who doesn't have this, on the spot they shoot you.\" So I\ndidn't say anything. After he says to me like this, \"You got money.\" You know this is those\npeople they used to call them in Polish in the ghetto, Schmaltzovnik (ph). Schmaltzovnik\n(ph) means he wants the gravy. He wanted always money. I says, \"I don't have no money.\"\nHe says, \"I know you have money.\" I had 20...20 zlotys with me and I had it in my sock, not\nin the pockets. He says, \"You have money.\" \"I tell you what,\" I says, \"we gonna go down\nand I'll give you the money.\" So I picked the street... remember that now, the Jelasna (ph)\nStreet. All the houses were bombed out. And when that street car stopped, I said, \"I am\ngonna get down now, and he followed me. So he walked in with me in a bombed out house,\nand he said, \"Now, give me your money. If not, I am gonna turn you in.\" So, I bend down\nand I wanta take out the money from my sock. And he was so greedy and he looked on if I\ndon't leave anything over there, you know. And he bend down...he wants to see. So I grabbed\na stone and I just hit him in the face. And he fell down. He fell down. I didn't hurt him or\nanything. He just fell down. So when he fell down, I run out. And I ran out...I ran...I don't\nknow what happened to him, but I ran so fast because I lost...I lost the 20 zlotys I had, and I\nran out. And I know if I will catch, the next thing that will take me to the ghetto. And I had\nthe change where the lady, the Polish woman gave me for the coal and I ran to the thing and\nI got the street car and I went to the ghetto. And I know up to 7:00 they let in all the people.\nHere was already 7:30. And I says, \"Where will I be.\" I went over there. I saw about 20\npeople still standing over there. In one group 30 people. In one group 50 people. There's still\na lot of people. And I mixed myself in and I had no papers. I haven't got anything. I couldn't\nsay I worked any place. I just ran away from a work place. And here the SS stand by the\nghetto, by the wall, and they let in the people where they worked outside on German arbeits,\nGerman work places. I went over there and I went to one man and I says, \"Where's these\npeople from?\" So he tell me. He says, \"We work in a...1n someplace where they cut food all\nday long.\" I was looking for a place where they do with coal because cutting wood you don't\nget dirty in the face and the hands. Finally, I found people that were working some kind of\nmasonry. They were all dirty, no... I says, \"I am gonna hitch myself out to hem.\" I go over\nthere to them and everybody passes by and everybody has to raise their hands because they\nare frisked. One carries a bread, one carries potatoes, one carries red beets...red beets, and\none carries...any little thing. I don't have anything. That's suscipicious already. I don't have\nanything. And here the people were. They go through and everybody stays like this with\ntheir hands up. When I get to them, the German...the...the man that stays by the gate...the SS\ncalls me and says, \"Where are you from?\" I says, \"I work for those people.\" He says in\nGerman, \"How...how come you don't have anything with you. You see all those people...one\nhas got a bread, one has got potatoes, one has got this...and you don't have anything. I says\nto him I am very poor and I says I don't have time to buy anything to day because I worked\nvery hard. I had to unload a whole train with coal. He says, \"Is that so.\" He went over to the\nnext guy. He had two breads. He took away one from him and he gave it to me. And this is\nthe same guy who wouldn't even let me in next to him. And I passed him and I went in to the\nother side. I went to the other side and I had a bread. So this guy ran over to me and says,\n\"Give me back my bread. That's mine.\" So I was afraid to start making a commotion\nbecause there were Jewish police, there were German Police, there were Polish police. So I\ngave them the bread and I said, \"Thank God, I am on the other side. Forget about it.\" I came\nin to the other side and I have to look where my father 1s. Now I found out I have to go\nthrough three...three...how do you say it...three posts, with the soldiers to go through these.\nSo I went to a friend what I know he was in ghetto, and I asked him what to do. He says, \"I\ncan't give you no papers. There's nobody here. Everything is bombed out. There's no people\nhere. People...very few people. He says, \"You have to figure out for yourself what to do.\" I\nfound a way how to do it. I saw there's people going in groups. They're going in groups, like\nsix people, they go through the gate or 8 people. I went to the gate and I said to the six\npeople, \"where are you working.\" Some speak German and some don't because I learn a\nlittle bit German to speak when I was working over there at the...at that military airport. So I\nmake believe that I am the leader of those 8 people and I said in German, \"You should all\nstand in one line. You give me all the papers.\" And I went over there to the soldier and I\nsays to him in German, you know like big deal, I says to him, \"Look, I got 8 people going to\nwork and this is the papers.\" He looked on the papers. He didn't ask me for the papers. It\nwas a miracle. He didn't ask me. He just saw...because they have respect for people they\nare...they are, let's say, leaders. So there he thought as I'm the leader for them, so...you don't\nask a leader for papers. So those 8 people went and I went with them and that's how I went\nover there and after I went on the house where my father lives. And I remember like now, it's\nfourth floor and I walked up, opened the door. It was in the morning. Here he saw me. He\nsaid, \"What are you doing here, Ike?\" I says, \"Look, I couldn't wait until you send\nsomebody to take me.\" So...and this is the time when I stood there and my father took me in\nin that factory. He went to the boss, the German boss what owns...he was like...and he took\nme in and I was working over there until... I went through three, four selections over there\nwhen they took away the people. I...one selection was January 1943. One day... You\nremember that. One day they called us all downstairs, came in a big deal from the SS men,\nthe Gestapo. They lined us all up. I remember like now I had a pair of boots and I had\ncoveralls or overalls. I don't know what it is. And I was sitting there and he went 1, 2, 3, 4,\n5, 6 out. He didn't make 10. Every sixth men he took out. I was 4. My father was 5. I was\nstanding right next to him. The 6th one was out. After he went 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6 out, out. And a\ntruck was standing right there so they took out about maybe 60 people or 80 people, put\nthem on the truck. Didn't see them anymore. This was the first selection was that time. And I\nwas working in that place until the ghetto uprising. It was the ghetto uprising, that's the time\nit started the whole problem.",
        "A: In the ghetto uprising. Well, in the ghetto uprising, I was not actually where the shooting\nwas. I was in the small ghetto where the people were working, but we can see the flames.\nWhere we were standing outside, we saw the flames. We saw the flames . You didn't\nbelieve it. Those people can do this. Burning up houses, whole streets, everything was one\nflame. We had a wall in the ghetto wall. When I was standing in the house, you look down\non the wall and you see Polish people. They making Christmas. They making all kind of\nholidays, and they know there's the other people going through that thing. They didn't even\nmind that the had to help anything like this. So...for instance, when they liquidated that\nghetto and they took us to the...to send away in the camps, they took me and my father and\nwe were carrying suitcases. So we walked over the streets. Now this is true; this is not made\nup. One side of the sidewalk the Polish people from the town of Warsaw were standing and\nsaying to us in Polish, \"People, you don't need this. You leave it for us. You going anyway\non...to make soap out of you.\" Now this is people that lived with you for hundreds and\nhundreds of years. You pay taxes. You live in their town. You were just a citizen of this\ntown, just like anybody else. Where they had the chance to show how the anti-Semitism was\nbuilt in...in the people of Poland. It was so built in, the anti-Semitism for those people that\nthey...even if they lost the country, they still they have won their anti-Semitism against the\nJewish people. Even if they lost the country because German occupied it. Still they had to\nshow it. And there's a reason why Germany made all that camps and all the concentration\ncamps, made it on Polish soil because they know that they will have good help from the\nsurrounding, from the people because he didn't do it in any other country, not in Poland those\nthings. I was in a camp...I mean this is something else. I was in a camp...in Skarzysko.' This\nis a camp near Radom. I could of...everyday, I could have run away from that camp. I could\nhave just walked over the fence. Where am I gonna go? Who I am gonna go? I was working\nwith Polish people, they didn't even look at you. I was working in a...in Skarzysko, in a camp\nin a...1n a machinery. Next to me, there was a Pole. He saw that every day I looked skinnier. I\ndidn't have a glass of water. I didn't have bread. Nothing! They used to sit down just like\nhome. Bring it in. It come the holiday. They had all thoses holiday breads. They used to say,\n\"Here, you want a piece.\" You don't exist for them. You did not exist for them. And...and\nthe point is it hurts you so much that you were living in a country for so many years...for\nhundreds and hundreds of years, and the people turned their back on you, actually turned\ntheir back on you. Like they were...like they liked, they were enjoy this what happened to\nyou. Sure, naturally, they say a lot of Poles, they were saving Jews. But how many? How\nmany? From 6 milion Jews, 3 and one half million was Jews from Poland. So how many you\ngot in 50 or 60 or 100 Poles they saved. And for what they saved? With money! Because if\nthe money ran out, they used to turn you in anyway.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, in the minute the ghetto burned and this what went start, they closed the factory. And\nthey made a raid. A raid means they came in. They told us, \"Everybody has to leave, and we\ngonna get shipped out for work.\" My father and me we sticked to let's be together. Let's start\nbeing together now the best way we can. One day in the morning the factory didn't open up.\nEverybody has to be outside in the street. You are not allowed to go up anymore in the\napartments you lived. Everybody has to be outside. Around 10 o'clock, it came trucks and\nstart loading up all the goods from the houses, from the apartments. Not us. They cleaned out\neverything and we still was sitting on the street. Around 12 or 1 o'clock in the afternoon, they\ntell us to get ready, we gonna walk. We gonna walk. It's about 6, 7 miles. So my father and\nme, my father's friend and his friend, we all stick together and we walked. That means we\nwalked about I'll say 8 or 10 miles towards the place, the Umschlag place, the famous\nUmschlag place, to get on trains and take us someplace. We don't know where. We went to\nthat...and that's the time when I told you where we carried the suitcases. Only what you are\nable to carry. That's the time the Polish people came and said, \"Leave it here on the street\nbecause you have no use for this anymore.\" Like vultures, and if somebody couldn't carry\nanymore, they left it and you see them running and grab it. We went to that Umshlagplatz.\n' Formally known as Skarzysko Kamienna. Located near Kielce, in Radom province.\nWe were sitting three days over there without water, without anything for 3 days, and it was\nhot. The third day they gave us water and they said, \"We're gonna leave.\" And where we're\ngoing we don't know. They put us on trains. I was together with my father with this man and\nhis wife or his sister was it. And they took us to Majdanek. Majdanek was a camp near\nLublin, and over there was 5 fields. That means evry field had 8 or 9 hundred people and it\nwas barracks and there's nothing to do Majdanek. They only thing you were Majdanek, you\ndid you sit sometime all day long and sometime they took you out to work and half of them\nnever came back. They make you sit all day and breaking up from big stones to make little\nstones or digging holes, digging ditches and covering the ditches up. That was the way.\nThat's what you call, uh, a camp that actually is a annihilation. They annihilate peole,\nactually. Very little food. Very little food. And my father was with me together, sleeping\nnext to each other. One day, this was...we got to Majdanek was in July, I think in August\n1943. We were standing in a ditch and digging and my father was standing next to me, a\nPole passes by, grabs a stone and throws it onto my father. And he was a prisoner too, you\nknow. The stone hit his leg. I don't know what happened if he broke a bone or something\nhappened. He couldn't walk. And in the night when we went home to the barracks, he\ncouldn't walk. He had to hold me here, like this, and...some how we dragged him...me and\nthat friend, we dragged him in the barrack. He was laying down. And his foot swelled up like\nthis. All of a sudden it swelled up. So one guy said we should go and call a medic or a doctor\nor somebody. Over there, they used to call sanitar (ph) . Well, I didn't realize what's gonna\nhappened if somebody gets sick. I didn't realize it! I thought, well, when a man got sick,\nsomething like this, that medic came. He wore a red cross. He came. He took my father. He\nsays to him, \"You know what you have to go on Revier.\" \"Revier\" means the hospital. And\nhe took him away; and he says tomorrow he's gonna bring him back. I never saw my father\nanymore. And this is for no reason at all. Pick up a stone and throw on somebody. And he\nwas...he was just standing there. The stone could have hit me, but it hit him. And it went 2, 3\ndays. Finally, I found out where the hospital is. I didn't even know where the hospital is. So,\nI walked over to the hospital and I looked around in the windows. My father is not there. So\nafter I found out they took him away and where I don't know what happened to him. Two\nweeks later, I found out that's people have to go away from here. That means there're looking\nfor 3 thousand, 2 thousand people to take them to a German ammunition plant.",
        "A: Okay.\nTAPE #2",
        "A: Yes. A few weeks later, about 2 weeks I found out that there's going to transport. That means\nthat transport will be some kind of factory. And the reason the factory, because people say\nthis camp, the Majdanek camp, was the worse one because I remember when we came in...in\nthat camp, the commander for that camp made a speech to us. He says in this camp nobody\nwalks out yet. The only way you good people is going to walk out is to through that\nchimney. And here I heard that they need 2 thousand young men to work in an ammunition\nfactory. I says, \"How can I sign up for this?\" So they told me to go in a place over there, and\nthey had a list. I gave them my number and I signed up for this. And I was waiting. Let's see\nwhat happened. And here everyday I went to work. No food. And you getting weaker and\nweaker, and I figured if I can only get out from here, cause this is finished. In this camp\nnobody walks out. Finally, I found a place where you can register and I went and I\nregistered for this. And there was 800 women I think...800...400 women and about 800 men.\nAnd they registered us, and we had still the striped uniforms and wooden shoes, and they\nload us up on trains, and before we went, the same guy, the commander came, and he says\nyou're the first people walks out here normally. What is... And they took us to a camp, and\nthis name was Skarzysko.",
        "A: Well, the train was actually cattle cars. It was a train, open with no roof. Just barbed wire\nwas on the roof. They put in the people in the cattle car, how many can go on. If you were\nthe lucky one, the first one, you got a seat against the wall, you were very lucky. If not, you\nhad to stay in the center. There was no...uh...toilet us to go out. Everybody used to do what\nhe feels like it and instead a trip should take a day, they used to make it 3 days because who\ndidn't make it, that's alright. So who was young...the elderly people didn't make it. Only the\nyoung ones, and that time I was about 18 years old, 17 years old. I was a healthy kid, and\nsomehow I made it. And when I came into that camp, so the first thing they asked me, \"What\ndo you..What do you know what to do?\" So I told them this. Everybody says if you say you\nare good in mechanics and metal work, you will have a better job. That's what I said. Some\npeople said as a tailor, some... So they asked me, \"A young kid like this?\" I said, \"I learned\nat school.\" So they gave me...they put me in a...in a building, and they used to make pots\nfor...ammunition pots, and I was working over there maybe 2 months every day, sometime\nnights, sometime days. Food, very little. Very little food. You couldn't even exist on that\nfood they give you. But somehow you...you just survive. I don't know how but you survive.\nYou work a whole night. In the day they brought you back. One day they told me they're\ngonna put me in a different machine to work. What this machine does, it cuts little pieces of\nmetal, and from this they make bullets, like for machine gun bullets. I was working with that\nmachine, and I had to go always to the wall, and grab a long piece of metal and put it in the\n_ and cut it. One day I go over to the war, I see there is no metal. Here the foreman walks\naround in a uniform, he comes to me and he tells me, \"Why you standing around? You don't\ndo nothing?\" I says, \"I have no metal.\" He says, \"What do you mean you have no metal.\nYou tell me that the German Reich has no metal to work?\" I says, \"I am looking for metal\nand there is no metal.\" First, I got a beating right away for saying that. I have no metal. He\nsaw there's no metal. He beat me to a pulp, the head and the feet. He kicked me. Finally, he\nwent to another guy and another give me metal and I was working and I was talking to\nmyself and I said to myself, \"I have to get out from here cause if I am gonna stay in that\nfactory, I am gonna die here by that machine. They don't give you to eat. They watching you\nall day long or all night long what you're doing. You can't walk away for a minute. I found\nout that there's other people...there're work outside on the plant. They're organizing\nsomething. Even if you pick up garbage, you pick up a potato from the ground, but still you\ncan do it. You can't eat metal. I didn't know what to do. After this, all of a sudden I felt sick. I\ngot sick. I don't know what happened to me, but I feel sick, and this is the first time I got\nsick. I came from work. I lay down. One guy came over to me and says, \"You have a high\nfever. You burning up.\" I didn't know what it is. He says to me, \"Why don't you go in...in\nthe hospital. It was not a hospital. It was like a pig sty. People were laying on straw. I walked\ninside. There was a doctor. He used to be a doctor before the war, but here he didn't practice\ndoctor. And he looked at me and he says to me, \"You got typhoid.\" (sigh) He laid me right\ndown. He didn't let me go back to the barracks. But I know that every third day a truck came\nto that thing and cleaned them, all the people out and take them out. Because they have no\nmedicine to heal typhoid. I was laying about 2 days and my fever must have dropped. And I\ndidn't eat. I didn't... They didn't give me anything for 2 days. The third day I got up and I was\ndizzy and I said to the doctor, \"I feel alright. I am going to go back to work.\" He says to me,\n\"What do you mean you are going to go back to work. You can't even walk on your feet.\"\nAnd he started to laugh, you know, like who cares. And I said, \"I feel good. I like to go back\nto work.\" He says to me, \"You know what. You see that long table standing here.\" Table\nabout 12 feet long, maybe more. \"If you can walk around that table three times and you not\ngoing to fell down, I let you walk out.\" You know. And do you think I didn't do it? I walked\naround three times, and I walked that. And he told me, \"You can go back in your barracks.\"\nI must of have this already about 2 weeks, you know. And finally, it was the breaking point\nwas the last 2 days, 3 days. When I walked out, the trucks came over and cleaned out the\nwhole hospital. This another thing. When I walked out, I Just walked let's say 100 yards and I\nsaw 2 trucks came over, and they took everybody, everybody out from the...from that\nhospital. I call it the hospital. It was not a hospital. Was a pig sty. Was just..when I came\nback in the barracks, I had no hair. I hardly moved. Some people had mercy on me, and one\ngive me a piece of bread, and one give me water. One give me hot water, and finally I got\nback a little bit, and I said to myself, \"I don't go back anymore to work over there, and I will\nwork in a place like...like building _. I should be outside. If I'm outside, I will organize\nsomething to eat. And that's what happened. I went in and somehow I got hanged up with,\nuh, with people that worked outside and I was working with a...and everyday I found out\nhow to organize food. I had a friend of mine...he used to teach me how to do those things,\nand...and...once I used to go to the kitchen, and I used to pick bones and I used to pick this\nand they used to throw it out and this brought me back a little bit to my health. I felt a little\nmore stronger day by day. And this kept on...[ was in that camp...1 was 16 months. 16\nmonths! And when the Russians start to move and more they start to evacuate in all those\ncamps. So what happened? I was from the last people in that camp. There was left\nmaybe...maybe 200 from...from a lot of people, and they took us and they brought us to\nBuchenwald from that camp. Some people they took to Auschwitz, the first transport. Us, the\nlast one, they took to Buchenwald. We came to Buchenwald, it was a new world altogether.\nBecause Buchenwald was a camp, a political camp. It was not a camp like to annihilate\npeople. So the first thing, they brought us in. There was a lot of Jews from Germany, a lot of\nJews where they were already there from before, and there were a lot of Jews they were... I\nfound out that they were in the Polish Army in 1939. And they're trying to escape from the\ncamps so they took away the uniforms, and they send them to Buchenwald. So there was all\nkind of people mixed. The first thing they asked me and asked me if you were mistreated in\nthat camp. I says, \"Yes.\" \"Who mistreated you?\" I told them. We had Jewish police. We\nhad a commandant, and we had this guy, we had this guy. I told him all those guys. And not\nonly me, other people too. And somehow they took care of those people. They did. It was an\ninstance I had a guy, his name...German Jew, and he was a policemen in that camp,\nSkorjisko (ph), and I was working in that camp and I found out that when you go to 12\no'clock, he gives out food. What was his job? He was working with people they used to clean\nthe camp. You clean the camp, and you used to give out food. I saw people walking around\nwith little..how do you call it...brooms and clean. I want to get a broom like this. I had to sell\nmy bread to get a little broom from somebody. When I got that broom, I make believe I\ncleaned so I got an extra portion. This went on for couple of weeks cause I was working\nnights and during the day, I got extra food. One day, he says to me, \"Where you work?\" And\nI didn't know what to say. He says to me, \"You mean you was cheating. You were taking\nfrom me soup every day?\" Well, I said, I was hungry. He start hitting me. He beat me up so\nmuch in...1n and after this he called over to the German and he gave me 25 on the back. Just\nfor this! Now when I came to Buchenwald, I went to him and I told him, \"I told you I am\ngonna get back on you.\" And I told those people that he was mistreating me. I don't know\nwhat they did to them. They say they took him out and they killed them or they send them\naway in a different place. They didn't wanta have.that.. I was in Buchenwald quite a while,\nand...and...for maybe a couple of months, I was in Buckenwald. The food was bad because\nnobody had to eat and they didn't take us out to work. They put us in a barrack like they were\nwaiting something should happen. One day they called us out from the barrack and they\nwrote everybody's number out, and they took us in another camp. In that camp they used to\nmake bazookas, German bazookas. And I was in that camp...oh...maybe 2 or 3 months with\nGerman bazookas.",
        "A: Yes. Schlieben. I was then one time...I...by that thing, and working and somehow I\nremember like now, a airplane was flying over my head and I was thinking...I says, \"Oh I\nwish I am that airplane. Maybe he'll take me away someplace. And I was just thinking. All of\na sudden, the German, that guy who used to take care of all those things, and he was the\nmanager, the foreman, and he took a bazooka (he must have been drunk or something) and\nhe threw on me. And if this would explode, everybody would explode. But it hit me here,\nand it chipped off a piece of bone in mine hand. And I was bleeding profusely. And I was\nstanding like this and the blood was gushing. Still a piece of bone is chipped off. So another\nguy came and grabbed me and took me in a place to put a bandage on because they were\ntold, they shouldn't hit those boys from Buchenwald. The Germans were told that all the\npeople that came from Buchenwald shouldn't be hit. And here he did hit something like this.\nAnd I was walking around with that bandage. Next day, there was an air raid...English\nairplanes that dropped bombs on the whole plant and 300 people got killed because it blow\nup. Everything blow up. And I was that time...I wasn't working. I was in camp because of\nthat arm. Next day, we heard that all the wounded people they going to take them back to\nBuchenwald. So I went and I make believe I am wounded to, because I had a bandage. I go\nover there to that car...was a car I remember and was a big truck and was about 20 people\nsitting with blood gushing down from their hands and their feet. No bandages. They were\nsitting down, half dead. And I had a bandage on here, and I went over there and I says I am\ngonna go back in the truck, and they asked my number, and there was a doctor over there.\nHe says, \"You can't go up here.\" I says, \"Why not?\" He says, \"Because you're not wounded\nin the air raid. You were wounded in the...\" I said, \"Why do you bother...why do you worry\nabout it. Let me up on the truck just to get out from here.\" He says, \"I can't do that.\" And he\nlet me down. And when he let me down, it comes the German officer and he writes down the\nnames and everybody's gonna go in the hospital and he saw me standing here and he says,\n\"Why...why don't you go in the truck. You wounded to.\" I go up in the truck. He wrote my\nname. That...everything is a miracle. And they took me back to Buchenwald. We came back\nin that camp. They gave us a reception. They made a movie, and they claim that see what the\nEnglish pilots did to the poor...you know, all propaganda. And they gave us food. They gave\nus a meal. They goes...they gave us a bed to take. We hadn't a bed for years. Here they gave\nus a bed. They take us a shower. The first time when it was the bath, I was afraid to go in.\nBecause I was thinking...because in the hole, I remember like now there was shower, but in\nthe hole there was a big gigantic pool with some green liquid, and everybody had to go into\nthat green liquid. What was it? This was disinfection. I didn't know. Nobody know.\nEverybody was afraid to go in. Cause they think, you go in, you gonna melt and nothing will\nbe happen from you. So we were standing, and everybody used...they used to say schnell\nand everybody was afraid to go in. I personally was afraid to go in. Finally, he started taking\npeople by force and push them in, and I saw they go in and they come out. So that's how\nwe..everybody went in because they thought nothing is gonna happen. So they gave us new\nclothes. They gave us bread. They gave us a soup, and they put us in a barrack to sleep there\nuntil the doctor will came and look, so the doctor came and put a splint (my hand was bad)\nand put a splint on. This is a miracle. Put a splint on, and they tell me I shouldn't go to work\nfor a couple of days, I should stay home. I should stay in the barracks. So I was standing like\nthis, and every 3rd day I had to go to the big commander from Buchenwald. He should look\non that arm. He only felt sorry for the people who the English pilots dropped the bombs, but\nevery day they made selections and they put people to death, he didn't feel sorry for them. It\nshows to you how the mentality from the German was like this, cause they did things you\ncouldn't understand. Here, half dead people came out; they gave care; they put bandages on\nthem; they gave them food; they put them in a barrack to sleep, and the rest of the people,\nhealthy people, they took out and they put them to death because they claim the English had\nno mercy and see what they did. As a matter of fact when I was in Buchenwald, I was in the\nsame barrack with a redactor (ph), with the editor today from the Forewords. His name is\nStrigler. M., if you know, M. Strigler. He..he was the guy who gave me every day my piece\nof margarine in the barrack. I used to sleep here. He slept about three beds from me.",
        "A: How? He got...the Germans! They gave each block, let's say they had 200 people. So they\ngave 3, 4 pieces, and they had a little machine in there made from wire. If you put the block\nof margarine in that machine, you push down, so each one came out perfect square. A little\npiece! This I will never forget. And Mr. Strigler, he is the editor from the Daily Foreward, he\nwas the guy who used to cut that wire. This was in Buchenwald. From that...that...and I came\nback to Buchenwald, and this was already 44. And from Buchenwald we went to another\ncamp, uh, this is near Stuttgart. They call it Bisingen. This was very bad. Over there was\nmostly Russian prisoners of war...mostly Russia. And they didn't have no barracks like 20,\n30 people, 100 people. It was one long barrack, maybe 1,000 people can sleep there. And\nthere was no beds. You sleeped on the floor, one next to the other, one row here, one row\nhere, and you see 500, 800 people sleeping the same thing. And over there was very bad.\nThe temperature was always cold. I don't know why. It was always raining. It was always\ncold. I mean I don't if it was the time of the year, but I had no clothes on. I had just that little\npaper jacket, no underwear, wooden shoes, no socks, just a pair of pants. No hat. No hair.\nYou were standing in that cold. It was miserable every day. When you standing on appell for\n2 hours in that cold weather. And the...and the bread they used to give you on the end in the\nbarrack. So when they call your number, no name, you used to walk through thousand\npeople to get your piece of bread. And when you got hold of the piece of bread, to walking\nback to your place, they jump on you and they grab the bread out from you. So the only thing\nto do, the minute they gave you the bread, you should push it in right fast in the mouth and\nthat's the only way you could save your piece of bread. And this went on for maybe 2\nmonths...maybe 10 weeks in that camp. This was already in the end of the war. What do you\nmean the end of the war? We didn't know even that was the end of the war, but you hear\nrumors..people used to say things but this was already the beginning of 45. And that place,\nthey used to make oil from shale. You know, those stones. The operation I never saw. The\nonly thing I did is digging the shale from the mountains and loading up on lorries and\npushing the lorries to a point and over there, there was no trains. People used to stay with\nshovels...and dump it on trains or trucks and they used to take them away. And I was over\nthere until around 45, maybe February or March. After they took us away from over there\nand they took us to Dachau. That's another camp. And no change in clothes. The same\nclothes for the last 2, 3 years. If you're lucky, you had...they survived. If not, somebody died\nor you saw somebody laying there, you take off his jacket and you put it on, and that's how I\nkept kept going on. And they took us to Dachau. We came into Dachau. I don't have too\nmuch recollection from Dachau because I think I had a very bad cold, and I had headaches. I\ndon't know what happened. It was just a cold or something. But I couldn't concentrate very\nmuch because I remember I had a friend what I always stick with him and somehow I lost\nhim. He disappeared.",
        "A: About my friend?",
        "A: Oh, he was a friend what I met. He was from the home yet a friend. He lived about two\nfloors above me and his name was Landau. His father died in the beginning of the war. He\nleft with the mother. And we stuck together, to each other most of the time. Most of the time\nbe together, and once there was a time that somehow he was taken away in another place,\nmaybe 10 miles and by miracle he came back. And we stuck... But this time in Dachau, I\ndon't know what happened through a...or he was taken away in another place. We just split\nand I don't know what happened to him? I really don't know. And from Dachau we...that was\nthe time when that was so bad, we actually didn't know if you gonna get up next day. Cause\nthey didn't give us food. They didn't give us water. There was no cooking. Absolutely\nnothing! And about a week later, they tell us all to get out from the barracks and we gonna\nmarch. We marched about 2 days. I don't know where that is in the woods. I don't know\nwhere it was, and they put us on trains.",
        "A: Well, the march was like this. We walked about 8, 6 people abreast. And let's say 50 people\nin a column and if there...there was...there was like a distance, maybe 3 or 4 feet, there were\ntwo SS going in the back and two SS in the front. And the rifles were always aimed on the\npeople, and we walked. And who couldn't walk because of lacking of food or water or\nsomething happened to him...he got sick, he get shot immediately. There was no mercy. Get\nup or carry you. And if they see somebody was carrying or dragging, you both get shot. So\nsomehow we walked. You can hear only the clap clap from the wooden shoes, and we\nwalked, let's say, maybe a day, maybe a day and a half. And I...1f you tell me where I was, I\ncouldn't tell you. I... know we was...how far can we walk? But you were Jjust...your mind\nwas on blank. I mean, there was no thinking anymore. And we walked and we came to a\nplace, there was standing maybe 15 or 20 trains, cars, cattle cars. And they told us to sit\ndown and take a rest. We sit down and we rested, and everybody was screaming water, you\nknow this. And the minute we said something, right away they take the rifles and shoot in the\nair. And in that thing there was not only SS. There was a lot of Ukrainian soldiers what they\nwere guarding some camp or something and they wore those uniforms, and they were very\nmean, very mean. They pushed us in the cars. Somehow I went to a place. I was laying\nagainst the wall, and it was so bad because after 3 days nothing to have in your mouth..\nNothing! And I figured that thety are going to starve us out or something, so they're trying to\nrun the trains. We went into the trains. You can see only the sky. The trains were open.\nThere was just wire on the top. And I was very delirious...delirious. I mean I really don't\nknow at that time what happened, I mean. And I was laying in the train . And I didn't feel\neven hungry any more. You know you get to the point, the end of the line you don't feel\nanything. And we went in that train maybe a day...a day and a half. All of a sudden I hear the\nGerman soldiers they jumping off the train, they going on the train, they stopping the train\nlike there's something going on, and they didn't know what. So one soldier, he was already\nan elderly man because the youngsters were away already. The youngsters were sitting on\nthe roof and the old guys, they were sitting in the train with us to guard. He says, \"You know\nyour President died.\" That's the time when Roosevelt died. \"Your President.\" in German he\nsaid it. I mean you couldn't even make it out what 1t means your president died. I mean I\ndidn't know if the president was a Roosevelt. I didn't know those things. But the way he said\nit, \"Your President died.\" Now..and this was like in the afternoon. I remember like it's\ngetting dark, so we trying to ask the soldier, \"Where are we going?\" He says he doesn't\nknow...he doesn't know. And he was sitting and eating, cutting the bread and eating, and here\nwere people sitting and starving. And the night the same thing. The train stopped. All the\nsoldiers go down from the train. After they come back to the train, there's something going\non they didn't know what happened. Next day in the morning, we saw all the soldiers with no\ninsignia anymore. No insignia. Everybody you noticed that is the same. There was no\nofficers. There was no sergeants. There was no thing. Everybody had no insignias. The\nuniform had no insignias. We didn't know what happened. We didn't understand what it\nmeans. Now...now we realize what it means. And this was April the 30th, 1945. And this\nwas a town named Staltah (ph). This is maybe 30 miles from Munich. And you imagined the\ntrain was going around in circles. They didn't know what to do with us. One probably says\nwe shoot them, one says no, one says the Americans are coming probably. They didn't know\nwhat to do with us. That's the reason...1t's only 30, 40 miles distance and they traveled 2 days\njust around the clock. I was sitting in the train and all of a sudden the train was standing on\nthe top and the bottom was the highway, and we saw the tanks coming. And this was\nAmerican tanks. And we saw the stars and all the soldiers...the German soldiers saw that,\nthey start jumping from the train. They dropped their rifles and they started running. Well,\neverybody from the train...barely we opened the doors because the doors were closed. We\nopened the doors. They weren't locked. We opened the doors. Nobody could get out because\nit was so high to jump. And here you got half dead people. If this will take another day,\nnobody will be alive in those trains without food. So they start falling out like this, who got\nhurt, and they started rolling down to the ravine, all the way down to the bottom where the\ntanks were coming. So I said to a guy, \"Push me.\" So he pushed me out and the same thing.\nJust keep rolling like this until the end and I stopped. And here the tanks are coming. I just\nremember like now, a guy came over from the tank. He came over to me and he says to\nme...I don't know if he spoke German or half English...if I am alright. I says yes, and I says\nwasser_, wasser_, means water. He took that field tank and he gave me some water and he\nsays, \"I ama Jew.\" I says, \"Yes.\" He says, \"I am a Jew too.\" And he says...and he took off\na mezuzah he had and he put it on me, and he says (sobbing) \"You're gonna live,\" he says.\nHe took out a chocolate and he gave me and he says in Yiddish, '\"___ I have a job to do. Iam\nbusy. The war is still on, and I can't take care of you. He says, \"I leave you here and\nsomebody will come after (sobbing) and take you.\" I was laying there on the ground maybe\n2 hours and all the tanks passed by and soldiers and trucks and jeeps and they didn't care\nabout the people because they're going to the front. And maybe 2, 3 hours later, probably\nthe...those people they clean up, you know...they reserved for this...or the medical corps, and\nthey saw what happened (sobbing) What a sight! What a sight! You see thousands,\nhundreds of people laying half dead. A young man had that body they moved, and I\nremember I was laying there on this guy says and he said, \"Oh my God, what a sight!\"\n(sobbing) They start picking up the people (sobbing). The picked them up one by one. Most\nof them were dead because they could... And the water...and those that were alive they put\nthem in trucks and jeeps, and they took them to hospitals or they made tents and they put\nthem in. They gave them water. They gave them packets from the Red Cross. And this was\nbad too because people when they got those packages, there was powdered milk, there was\nchocolate; there was a can of meat, and they were so hungry, they didn't care and they ate it.\nSo hundreds died from eating this stuff, because their stomach was no used to food. And I\nhad a guy next to me...I don't know if he was a doctor once or something...he was half dead\ntoo. When he got that package...and I think he was Hungarian or Rumanian...he says to me,\n\"Don't eat nothing. Don't eat nothing. If you gonna eat anything, you gonna die. The only\nthing you do, if you have sugar, take the sugar in the mouth and suck on the sugar. That's\nthat the only thing you should do, he says, the rest of them throw away. And if you want to\nkeep it, keep it, but don't eat anything. Don't take the milk in your mouth. Don't take the\nchocolate. Don't take the meat because they used to give you a can of meat, Spam. Don't eat\nit, because if you're gonna eat it, you're gonna die. And that's what happened. Those people,\nthey eat the stuff, they got diahrrea and they died. So what I do and I had that sugar, Domino\nsugar, the little tiny pieces, and I used to suck on that sugar. I was so hungry I could eat an\nelephant. But he said to me, \"You're gonna die if you're gonna eat it,\" this guy. Well, this guy\ndied. Yah, he died next day. He died not from eating. He died because he Jjust...just his heart\nstopped. He just died. And this guy saved me because he said, \"Don't eat anything. Just suck\non the sugar.\" And that's what I did. And for 2 days I laid there. They didn't give us no food.\nThey used to give us cereal. A bowl of cereal everyday. That's the only food. And they used\nto say to the people, \"Don't eat this stuff because...\" People didn't listen because they were\nso hungry. And after a while, they gave us start giving us a piece of bread and like a little\nbaby, they nudge us back to normality, like a little child. Here you see people after they\ngave us a little piece of bread. The next day they give us a little piece of soup. You\nknow...cereal soup. No soup with meat and all that stuff. And little by little, you know, you\nget back. And I was in that tent maybe a week. And after...and they didn't give us clothes. No\nclothes. I still was laying in the same thing. The only thing I have is a Army blanket. You\nknow those green blankets. After this, and this was, let's say about near Munich someplace,\nand after the sanitar corps went away there too. There is nobody there. Because the war is\nstill on. It was not the 8th of May yet. That was the 2nd of May, the 3rd of May. But they\nwere nice to us. You know they still say to us...a lot of Jews was there and they still say,\n\"There's the front and we have to leave you and the only thing what was in those tents was\ntwo men and they were taking care of those tents. And left us tents, and the German from\nthis town had to come every day and clean those tents out and all that stuff. And after the\nGerman had to come and dig a big hole and they buried all the dead people that was laying\naround the train. It was a sight! It was a sight because the train was on top, and the bottom\nwas the highway, and the people used to go from the train like this, falling down and you see\nall hanging on the bushes, near a tree, in the grass, and you see men and women, and small\nmen, and large men. Everybody was laying spread over. They were dead. They were just\ncouldn't...they just couldn't hold it on anymore. The minute the train opened up, you see all\nfalling out. They were half...every car had half dead people inside. Like I told you, only\nyoung people could have survived. Only the youngsters. And after this, me and one more\nguy went over there. We took our little strength and we says, \"We're gonna walk to a town.\nAnd we walked in that uniforms. We felt more strength, and I remember like now we came\nto a house with a German woman inside, and she saw us and she started running. She run\naway. She saw both of us and we wore striped uniforms. We walked in that house. What a\nbeautiful house. All kind of china, with closets with clothes. First thing I did I took off my\nthings. I took out a shirt, and I put on a shirt. This is the first time in 3, 4 years I had a shirt\non my back. Shoes I couldn't find, but I found a pair of rubber shoes. I put on the rubber\nshoes. And a pair of pants. And after I saw her looking and I hollered to her, \"Come here.\nYou know what I need some food, you know, to eat.\" So she gave us some food. But I saw\nher looking outside. She looked...she looked outside. I don't know what it was. And there\nwas a dog house. And what do you think? In the dog house, there was a little girl, maybe 4\nyears old. She was...she hid. I went to her and I says, \"Do you think I am going to harm you\nlittle girl? Do you think I am going to be just like you people were? I am not going to harm\nyou, little girl. You don't have to hide on the dog house.\" She didn't say a word, you know,\nwhen I said this to her. But this little girl was laying in that dog house hidden because she\nthought that...because this what they did to us, we're gonna to do to them. And the same\nthing is when the Germans threw away those rifles by the train, I couldn't have picked up a\nrifle and killed all I wanted. I couldn't even move. I couldn't even pick that rifle up from the\nground. Probably maybe if I could, I would have feel maybe I would do it. I couldn't even\ndo this. I couldn't even lift up the rifle that was laying on the ground because first of all they\nare very heavy and second of all, I am not the type to kill anybody or to shoot. First,\nin...1n...especially when the war was going on, you could have walked around in every home\nand do anything you wanted. Nobody did those things. Nobody did any revenging and\nkilling just for no reason at all. I don't remember those things. And I saw people like\nme...there was no men, only women and children, because older men were in the war.\nNobody did any revenge . And after this, they took us...yah, the MPs stopped us...2\nMPs... Yes...and asked where are we going. So I told him we were on a field hospital from\nthe army and now we gonna go. We're looking for friends or family. You know, do you say,\n\"That's the only thing you had on your mind.\" So they say, \"You can't do that. You are not\nallowed. No. You're now allowed to do this.\" That was just war time. You are not allowed\nto do this. So they took us, put us in a jeep, and took us away, and point was already more\npeople over there. And this was that Camp Felderink. (ph) This was in the time...when in that\ncamp was still the German Army was still living in those barracks. So, the American Army\nwants to put us in over there. There was 30 people. So we said, \"We are not gonna live with\nthem. You chase them out. You chase them out, we're gonna go in. We're not gonna stay\nwith them.\" So anyway, they went out, and they moved us in. And that's how that camp\nstarted to become a camp. That's how that camp Felderink started to become a camp for DP.\nYou know a lot of people came from all kind liberation camps and they put them in..in that\ncamp. And there was other camps, not only Felderink. There was Saltzheim (ph). There was\nLandsberg. There was, uh, oh, there was a lot of them all around, you know. All those people\nthat were liberated from the Army. And after awhile you start... even right after the\nliberation, people right away starting to...to make committee, to start learning, to make a\nnewspaper. There was printing a newspaper. Right away they're looking for libraries and I\nremember like now, there was a newspaper printed with...with German ABC, but it's written\nin Yiddish, because there was no Yiddish words in Germany. And who was doing this? The\nGermans were printing that newspaper. And all kind of little things shows to you that's how\nfast the people...the Jewish people raising up from the ashes, and right away they start\nbuilding up a home. And some people got married. Some people find girlfriends. Some\npeople travel to Poland to see if anybody is alive. Some people went to another camps and\nput little names on the walls. I am looking for this and this and this man and maybe you saw\nmy sister. Her name was like this. Maybe you saw my father. I was in a camp with them.\nAnd any place you went, you saw hundreds and hundreds of little pieces of paper written\ndown with names in case somebody saw somebody. And that's what kept us going to look.\nMaybe you'll find somebody. Oh, did you see this? Or where is this? And maybe you found\nsomebody. Oh yes, I saw him over there this camp. Right away, you went and you...you\nwent by train or by somebody to this camp and look up. What that means after 5 years of\ntorture! What we went through for no reason at all. Only thing is because you were born\nJewish. The...they say...uh...1 remember for instance in the time when I went from the\nghetto...one for instance, and I was in the ghetto and I was working for a person in the\nghetto. I was a kid. He paid me 20 Zlotys a week. He collected schmettes from those tailors,\nlittle leftovers. He made big veils, and he give this...he sold it to the Germans. Not he sold\nit...this was his job. And I was working for him, so one day we loaded up a full truck of those\nthings and we have to take them to the German place, and he had a piece of paper that's to let\nus out from the ghetto. And a woman used to have the piece of paper. She carried the piece\nof paper for six people. And this was around Christmas 1940 or 41. And I saw Polish people\nthat were dancing. Christmas is coming. Everybody...the stores are nice, decorated and here\nthe people being laying on the street swollen from hunger...we haven't got a piece of bread to\neat...and everyday they take out thousands of people and they bury them in mass graves and\nhere on the other side of the world, life goes on like it's a normal thing. Life went on so\nnormal. And...and one day, that woman must have went shopping. She left that standing on\nthe street, and here we stand 6 people. I remember like now. Six people destined to death,\nand here that woman walked away with a piece of paper. And what will happen if any\nGerman comes along and asks what we're doing here, and we're going to tell him that some\nwoman that has a piece of paper and this piece of paper says these six people have a right to\nstay here. So that means 6 people's lives depends on a little piece of paper. That was our\ndestiny. So finally that woman came. It was like Mesiah came. So that's...",
