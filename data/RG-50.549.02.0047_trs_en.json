        "Question: Okay, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr\ncollection, this is an interview with Eva Cooper, conducted by Karen Michelle, on the\ndate we decided was the 22\" of June, 1999, in her apartment at 1100 Park Avenue, near\n80\" Street, in -- 88\" Street --",
        "Answer: 90\" --",
        "Q: -- excuse me, 90\" Street -- I got lost getting here -- in Manhattan. This is a follow up\nI don\u2019t know what the date was. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ngratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is\ntape number one, side A. Whoa. A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Were you asking questions?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, okay.",
        "Q: This -- As you know, a follow up interview, it\u2019s looking at really, the kind of post\nHolocaust years.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: I was curious, you said that you\u2019re going to Disney World tomorrow.",
        "A: Yes, I am, for the third and last time, with my grandchildren.",
        "Q: What did -- When you were a little kid in Budapest, could you have imagined that\nnow, this many years later, this is what you\u2019d be doing?",
        "A: No, I certainly did not. But I think that\u2019s probably true of a non-Holocaust person, too,\nthat you don\u2019t really think what you\u2019re going to do as an adult, or even the fact that\nyou\u2019re going to be grandparents. I mean, that\u2019s very old people, and it\u2019s very hard to\nthink about. But I spent a lot of wonderful years, when I was in Budapest with my father,\ngoing to, not Disneyland, but to playgrounds, and theme parks, in a very small way, that -\n- with roller coasters, and all that kind of stuff, so I have very fond memories of that.",
        "Q: [inaudible] ... Is having a good time important to you?",
        "A: Well, 1 -- when you say important, yes it certainly 1s, I\u2019d rather have a good time than\na bad time, you know. Important, I think at this point, health, and having my family\nremain healthy, and around me, is more important, but yeah, having a good time certainly\nis important.",
        "Q: Did the -- the going to the amusement park with your family as a child --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- how did that stay with you during all of these quite un-amusing times you\u2019ve had --",
        "A: That always stayed with me. It\u2019s really strange, because I know we\u2019re going to talk\nabout the Hidden Children a little bit later, but the very first meeting I went to after our\nHungarian group was formed, we sort of introduced each other, and everybody gave a\nlittle blurb of -- of the -- the war years, and I kind of ended up, not meaningly, sounding\nlike a Pollyanna, because everybody was telling not just horror stories, but of how\nterribly it affected them afterwards. Everybody blamed their misfortune, divorces, and\neverything else on the Holocaust, and I\u2019ve -- not a matter of having gotten beyond it, but\nin many ways I have nice memories of certainly the -- the pre-war years, and my\nmemories of the Holocaust, with all the horror, and being terribly afraid of many things,\nit was also a nurturing time. I was very conscious of -- of my parents taking care of me,\nand protecting me. Of providing me with food when there wasn\u2019t any to be had. I was a\nvery finicky eater, it was a pain in the neck, you know, providing me with -- with\nanything I would eat. And during the time that we were hidden, I had a -- a boyfriend\nwho was a year older than I, so we were 10 and 11, and we had a wonderful time. So, I\nthink because my parents protected me, and made up majorly fictional, nonsensical thing\nin retrospect, but it helped me, I think, come out sort of a healthier person, without any of\nthe post-war trauma that a lot of my friends, who are my contemporaries, still have.",
        "Q: You said they made up a fiction, what do you mean?",
        "A: Did you see the movie, \u201cLife is Beautiful\u2019? The Italian film that won all the awards?\nA lot of my friends thought the movie fictionalized, and trivialized the Holocaust, and I\nthink you would have had to see the movie to know what I\u2019m talking about, but it\u2019s --\nwhen you see the movie, knowing it\u2019s about the Holocaust -- when I first went to the\nmovies, for the first 20 minutes I thought I was 1n the wrong movie, because there was a\ncomedy. It was silly, it was Marcelle Marceau and Chaplin all put into one, before the\nHolocaust theme takes place. And it was basically about a father protecting his child. I\ndidn\u2019t think it was trivialized at all. I really related to it, because the whole process, in\nsome ways, my parents made up stories that I was able to accept. So I never had their\nfear, I always had their very positive attitude that my grandmother who had died in the\nUnited States, previous to the war, was a butterfly, and every time there was a butterfly\nflying around, it was my grandmother up there watching out for us. And to this day, you\nknow, butterflies are kind of a meaningful thing. And there was always a positive thing,\nthat things would be okay. So, I never had the fear that my parents had, but they wanted\nto be sure that I wouldn\u2019t, and I guess I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if that makes any sense.",
        "Q: Sure. I -- Yo-You had said that you previously had been able -- your -- your mother\nhad instructed you that if she said 1t was black, it was black, and you were not to\nquestion.",
        "A: Right. That\u2019s absolutely true. That was probably the -- the only time that she spoke to\nme in very strong language, because I think somebody stopped us on the street, and asked\nus about our religion, and my mother said we were Catholic, and I kind of pulled at her,\nand disagreed, and aft-after that, my mother said that at any time, that our lives depended\non it, and it\u2019s very important that I not question anything she says, and if she says it\u2019s one\nthing, it\u2019s -- if it\u2019s -- yes, that\u2019s absolutely -- that\u2019s the truth, but -- no, no, I mean that --\nthat was -- and I think -- you know, I think the European children are sort of brought up\nthat way, so it wasn\u2019t quite as difficult for me to deal with. You know, your -- you speak\nwhen you\u2019re spoken to, and you don\u2019t question a lot, and I don\u2019t think today\u2019s generation\nwould get away with that.",
        "Q: Were there other instances where your mother -- where you had to comply with your\nmother when you knew she was not telling the truth?",
        "A: I think I -- well, the only other time, and it wasn\u2019t a ma -- even a matter of complying,\nbut she -- she stole an egg, and I think I did tell that story in my video, and I remember\nthat very clearly, cause everybody said where did you get the egg, and she said she ran\ninto a farmhouse, and chicken was laying an egg, and she took the egg because she made\nme a cake, and it needed an egg. A little yellow cake thing, and I -- I asked her about\nstealing, and I think she sort of -- gee, I don\u2019t remember all that well, but I don\u2019t think it\nwas a major discussion, but she said that when you\u2019re hungry, sometimes -- it was there,\nshe didn\u2019t think she was taking it from anybody else, so whatever. I was 10 years old, so I\ndidn\u2019t go into it, in major, you know, depth.",
        "Q: Was it primarily your mother then, who shaped you?",
        "A: I think so. My father and I had a wonderful relationship. He was a very quiet and very\nloving man, very successful in business. My father -- I think the reason for that during the\nwar years, 1s that by -- my mother did not look Jewish, and I was a little girl, and I -- I\ndon\u2019t know what -- what it looks like, but I guess I didn\u2019t look obviously Jewish, I had\nblue eyes, and -- my father definitely looked Jewish. He had a no -- you know, a nose that\nwas more obviously Jewish, and not only that, but what they were doing 1s -- had men\njust drop their pants, and that was certainly easy to identify. So, I think my father, during\nsituations where we were questioned, or had to negotiate to stay at someone\u2019s house, or\nwere stopped on the street, my father always stayed in the background. In -- You know,\nduring -- during the time of hiding, and also my father had a kidney stone problem, so my\nmother was very protective of his health. During -- Before the hiding, during the -- 01 --\nthe bombing, the air raids, my mother was in charge of the building, and we went down\nto the cellar, and all that kind of stuff, so she had more mobility, and was able to\naccomplish more, we stayed more in the background.",
        "Q: When you were growing up, though, before you were 10, before all of this happened,\nwas he a strong presence?",
        "A: Oh yes, definitely. Every Sunday we went to the zoo, we went to the playground, we\nwent to the amusement park, and he would come -- I had this huge world map on the\ncloset, or the wall of my room, and every evening after he came home from the office, we\nwould play a game of identifying capitals. Countries all over the world, and eventually\nrivers, and oceans, and stuff, and it was -- it was a different kind of life than today. The\nfathers came home at the end of the day, mothers kind of took care of all the bathing and\ngetting you to bed, and all that kind of stuff, but I had a very, very close relationship with\nmy father, and a -- a very loving relationship. In some ways, I think I was probably closer\nto him.",
        "Q: Is he still alive?",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "Q: Is he still alive?",
        "A: No. He died when I was pregnant with my daughter, yeah. He was -- Actually, I was\nthe last person that he saw. I went up to his office, in 1957, to show him my first batch of\nmaternity clothes, and he died on the way home. He got on the Fifth Avenue bus to go\nhome, lived on Riverside Drive, my mother\u2019s still there, and he got off the bus, and he\ndied.",
        "Q: Was he ill?",
        "A: He had a heart condition. I was really not even aware of how serious it was, I mean, he\nwas in the office that day, he wasn\u2019t home.",
        "Q: Are you still close to your mother?",
        "A: Yes, my mother 1s having a very hard time right now, actually. My mother is 87, and\nshe has dementia. So, up to two years ago, she was in better health than most of my\ncontemporaries, and actually, she still 1s, except for the fact that she gets very confused,\nshe\u2019s getting depressed. She still goes to the Philharmonic, she still goes to the opera. She\nlives at home, in the same apartment on Riverside Drive, but she\u2019s aware that she\u2019s not as\nwell as she was, not physically, but mentally. They say -- I don\u2019t know what the\ndifference is, but they say it\u2019s not Alzheimer\u2019s, it\u2019s dementia, she has aortic stenosis,\nwhich is a clogging of the main artery. Blood doesn\u2019t flow to the brain too well, and she\u2019s\nreally scared, and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s really rough right now.",
        "Q: The cake that you talked about, where she stole the egg. Do you eat cake today?",
        "A: Yeah, I love cake, yeah.",
        "Q: Yellow cake?",
        "A: Yellow cake, chocolate cake preferably, but when desperate, I'll eat yellow cake. And\nI love apricot jam, that was -- that went in it, and one of the other things we used to do,\nsince food was scarce, we used to have these -- you know these kielbasa, it\u2019s like a hot\ndog, but it\u2019s like a salami texture, and it\u2019s very long and skinny, and I don\u2019t know how\nwe acquired a piece, and my mother would cut one tiny, tiny little wedge, or circle, and\ncut it up into many, many, many pay -- many pieces, and pretend that that was a\nsandwich, or a piece of bread with it on. But instead of like eating the whole thing, it was\nrationed.",
        "Q: You still eat that?",
        "A: Yeah. The only thing that I don\u2019t eat, which really was sent to us after the war by my\ngrandfather when they would send us care packages, 1s Spam. And I had -- We had no\nclue. They would send us Spam, and they sent nail polish, that they -- we would sell, and\nI don\u2019t know what other food product, but I adored ham, and the Spam had that kind of a\ntaste. And we had, you know, never seen canned products before, so that was my very\nfavorite, and I must tell you, when we came here, and I said Spam, everybody looked at\nme like thi -- and I always meant to buy Spam, and it\u2019s sort of like buying the \u201cEnquirer,\u201d\nyou\u2019re embarrassed to buy it, but you look at -- over somebody\u2019s shoulder at the checkout\ncounter. But I\u2019ve never bought it, and I always wondered if I bought it, what it would\ntaste like today, but that was the only thing that I ate then, and I have not eaten since.",
        "Q: So clearly you didn\u2019t keep kosher.",
        "A: No. No, we were definitely -- I guess by Stateside standards, we would be Reform, but\nthere it was Conservative. We sat separately, but it was -- we were not kosher, we did not\nspeak Yiddish, my grandparents didn\u2019t speak Yiddish. We were definitely assimilated\nupper middle class Hungarian Jews.",
        "Q: Do you think that helped you when you came to this country?",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s very hard to say. You -- You know, children fall into a lifestyle that\nthey\u2019re in, and they don\u2019t say what would it have been like if I had been kosher, or -- or\nlived in -- I don\u2019t know, the lower east side, or somewhere else. I mean, the very first\nthing my parents did when we got here, is got tickets to Metropolitan Opera, cause that\nwas their food. You know, we did bring some money, not a great deal, but we certainly\nweren\u2019t poor. But we probably spent more money on the opera than we did on food,\nbecause food we ate, but I had a very close friend, and I think I told that story, in high\nschool, whose father was a hairdresser, and they lived in Jackson Heights, and every\nSunday, they had roast beef, and this really expensive dinner. And we didn\u2019t. We had hot\ndogs, and beans, and I don\u2019t know, chicken or whatever, I mean, we didn\u2019t starve, but the\nquantity of food was not a major importance, but cultural activities were. So, you know, I\ndon\u2019t know what it would have been like. I think I assimilated very quickly. We got here\nin the spring of \u201947, and I went to a very fancy girl\u2019s camp in Maine, that my daughter\nsubsequently went to, that\u2019s still there, and if I had granddaughters, they\u2019d be going there.\nAnd then I went to public schools, I went to Hunter High School, and Hunter College.\nAnd I never had any Hungarian friends, except for my parents and their friends. I spoke\nEnglish, had no reason to speak anything else, and as I grew older, I started speaking\nEnglish and Hungarian, kind of half and half. I started with one language and finished\nwith the other with my parents. I mean, they spoke English with an accent, but they\ncertainly spoke it well enough. And I married an American, and I had absolutely no\nreason, so I definitely assimilated, and I think maybe if I had been more religious, I\nwould have assimilated differently, or not as easily.",
        "Q: Do you think of yourself as Jewish now?",
        "A: Absolutely, I always have. We converted for a short time, strictly for acquiring papers\nthat they -- they thought may have saved our lives. It probably wouldn\u2019t have, but in\nthose days you did everything that you could to -- just in case. Several of my parents\nfriends, when they came here, remained whatever religion they converted to, and raised\ntheir children, whatever they were. I --I\u2019m -- You know, I know them, but I -- they\nweren\u2019t -- I was not friendly with them, so I don\u2019t know if they were Catholic, or\nProtestant, or what they converted to, I really don\u2019t know, but one of my mother\u2019s\nfriend\u2019s son is a minister. So -- And a lot of them intermarried. I married twice, both\nJewish. I\u2019ve always belonged to a synagogue, we always observed the holidays -- holy\ndays. My daughter was Confirmed, and married by a rabbi, and they are really quite --\nwell they\u2019re -- they belong to a Reform synagogue also, but they are a very traditional\nJewish family.",
        "Q: What kind of synagogue do you belong to?",
        "A: Here? Temple Emmanuel.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yeah, right. But you know, it\u2019s interesting, because my grandfather, and grandmother,\nwho came here in 1939 joined Temple Emmanuel, because it was very much like the\nsynagogue we belonged to in Budapest. Have you ever been?",
        "Q: To Budapest? No.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, the synagogue, it\u2019s not a shul, I mean it\u2019s -- you know, everybody always things\neastern Europe has these little Orthodox shuls. This is the biggest synagogue in Europe,\nand I think the second biggest in the world, it 1s huge. It\u2019s very impressive looking, it\u2019s\nprobably not all that different looking than Emmanuel, maybe a little bit smaller. You do\nsit separately, and it is Conservative, so they do wear talisses, it\u2019s -- you know, I don\u2019t\nthink they do at Emmanuel. But it\u2019s not by any means Orthodox, or -- and as I said, I left\nwhen I was 13, so I didn\u2019t go to Hebrew school or anything there. And my grandfather\njoined Temple Emmanuel, so when we came here, he started taking us to services there.\nAnd as I got 0 -- you know, older, and I was married, I got my own membership, and I\nwas Confirmed. No, my -- my parents were there also, and I was Confirmed there. And --\nAnd my daughter was raised there, went through Hebrew school, and was Confirmed\nthere, so --",
        "Q: Was it important to you that she [indecipherable]",
        "A: Absolutely. I would have been very upset if hadn\u2019t married one.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Sounds like \u201cFiddler on the Roof,\u201d but tradition.",
        "Q: Was it important to your family that you marry a Jew?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it ever came up. I don\u2019t think I ever dated anyone who wasn\u2019t, and except\nfor one young man who was absolutely gorgeous, that my daughter dated, a very, very\nbright young man, she only dated Jewish boys, too. So, I really don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know if it\nwas just the circle of friends that I traveled with was limited, I don\u2019t know, I mean I -- I\nnever dated anyone who wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: I want to get to that -- that part in a little bit. I want to go over some of the things from\nthe -- the past story, and then come up closer to the present. Yo-You -- You just talked\nrecently about how you always did what you were told, that you\u2019d -- you\u2019d been told not\nto question. Is that still something that you do, did you --",
        "A: Mm-hm, yes, probably. I mean, not to that extent, but yes. And I really get annoyed\nwith it sometimes, cause I still -- I think I was brought up that way. I mean, it had nothing\nto do with the war, I was brought up, you know, parents, teachers, God, you know, all\nthat is up there, and you don\u2019t question, and you do, and -- and respect, and when your\nparents tell you something, you do. You stand up when older people come into the room,\nI still do, even though I\u2019m older. And very often, with older people, I find that I talk to\nthem like I was a child. So I think there\u2019s a little bit, you know, of that still in me.",
        "Q: What do you mean talk to them like [indecipherable] child?",
        "A: With that kind of respect. That when I do, I realize that, you know, I\u2019m -- \u2019ma\ngrown-up. And I think it\u2019s interesting, because I\u2019ve been married twice, and I -- I think I\nimposed the role on myself, of the t -- the traditional wife. Make breakfast, cut the\nbananas, put out the cereal, you know, kind of stuff, and it just the way it was, and just\nthe way I did it. I -- I think at some point I questioned it. Sometimes I get annoyed with\nthe fact that I\u2019m still doing it, but I do anyhow. And it\u2019s okay, you know.",
        "Q: What about your daughter?",
        "A: Oh my -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s interesting, you know, I was going to give you a quick answer.\nShe really is a traditional wife, much more so -- my daughter is very, very bright. She and\nher husband met in law school. She practiced for about 10 years, and she has three\nchildren. She worked part time after the first one was born, at the law firm, and went back\nafter a second child, and then she realized that she really didn\u2019t want to be doing this, and\nshe really wanted to be with her children. And even though she does work part time now,\nsh -- 1t just happens -- she lives in Connecticut, and she works for Yankelovich Group,\nwhich is a big market research firm, they happened to be in Westport, and she just kind of\nlucked out with a good offer. But she works part time, strictly at her own hours, and she\u2019s\ndefinitely a homemaker.",
        "Q: What\u2019s your daughter\u2019s name?",
        "A: Lisa.",
        "Q: Lisa. Did you raise Lisa to do -- to agree with you, and not to question you?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t know if she would agree. Actually, in many ways, even\nthough her children are very different -- well, first of all they\u2019re three boys, which is a\nvery different thing than one daughter, and times are different, and what fashionable is\ndifferent. I don\u2019t mean fashionable clothes-wise, but behavior-wise. But I think in many\nways, she still 1s quite traditional, but not to the extent I -- when they were first married,\nand I saw my son-in-law taking his shirts to the laundry, I was appalled, and I was -- I\njust say, w -- you know, this is what you\u2019re supposed to be doing, and she gave me a look\nlike, you know, they\u2019re his shirts. And you know, so -- but it was a very small thing, and I\nthink my son-in-law\u2019s a wonderful father, and I think with the children it\u2019s definitely\nmore of a joint venture than it was . My ex-husband was a very good father, but 1-it -- it\nwas more the roles, you know, I was at home, and had dinner ready, and the baby bathed,\nand all that, and he did a lot of stuff with her, because I think in our generation, I think\nthat was becoming more of the thing, but they were the -- th -- they made the money, and\nI mean, you know, they had to go to work. Somebody had to go to work, and somebody\nhad to stay home.",
        "Q: You went to college.",
        "A: I went to college, and I taught -- I -- I was a teacher. I was home for the first six or\nseven years. And I must tell you, I wouldn\u2019t have traded it for the world.",
        "Q: What did you teach?",
        "A: Well, I started out with elementary school, and -- and I went back to school -- I went\nback for my Master\u2019s when I was 40, and got a degree in special education. That was a\nfairly new degree they were giving, and I just kind of fell into it in public school. I\nsubstituted in a couple of special ed classes, and I didn\u2019t have a clue what I was doing,\nbut I really liked it, and I went back for my Master\u2019s, and then I taught special ed. But I\ntruly and truly believe that when you have children, when they\u2019re little, you\u2019re missing\nout on a great deal if you\u2019re not with them. And so are the children. And it was\ninteresting, this has nothing to do with the Holocaust, but I was watching Larry King\nyesterday, and Mary Tyler Moore was interviewed, and she said that was the one thing, if\nshe had to do it all over again, she would have been home. I think she lost her child.\nThere were a lot of tragedies there. I don\u2019t even know if she has any now, but I think her\nchild either OD\u2019d, or something bad happened. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t remember what it\nwas, but she was very adamant about it, and almost teary, that you owe your children, if\nyou have them, to spend time with them. And you can\u2019t have it all, and I think that\u2019s\nreally true.",
        "Q: It certainly seems like your parents did that with you.",
        "A: Well, my parents it was dif -- first of all, it was different. This was in Europe, I mean,\nthat was a whole different world. Yes, the mothers were home. I mean, I had a nanny, and\nI had a housekeeper, and I had a cook. Not I, but my family, but my parents were always\nthere, I was -- no question in my mind who -- you know, who was the help, and who were\nmy parents, those -- al-although I loved all my -- most of my nannies. But that was, you\nknow, like playtime stuff. But then my mother, after the war, took over my grandfather\u2019s\nbusiness, and after my father died -- my mother\u2019s a very competent woman, I mean she --\nshe was not a career person, but she\u2019s extremely bright and capable, when she had to run\nthe business she did. I mean, when the war broke out, my mother didn\u2019t know how to\ncook or clean or do any of those things, but that\u2019s not how proper young ladies were\nraised. But let me tell you, within a very short time, she became a very good cook, she\u2019s\nbi -- very good laundress. I don\u2019t know how to iron, she does. So, some people just, you\nknow, when you have to, you do.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: [indecipherable] this puppy. Okay.",
        "A: Are you -- Are you comfortable?",
        "Q: I\u2019m fine, thanks. This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum interview with Eva Cooper. This is tape number one, side B. Okay. Still a\nfinicky eater?",
        "A: Yes. But I love chocolate. Yeah, I\u2019ve always been a finicky eater, really was terrible. I\ndon\u2019t know how I stayed alive during the war, cause I used to have a stupid habit of\nsmelling things before I would eat it, when I wasn\u2019t sure what it was, cause there was --\nthere was a lot of yucky stuff being served, is the understatement. But there were a lot of\ndead animals on the -- on the streets, and people would get meat from horses and dogs,\nand that did not appeal to me, so I would only eat what I like, and I still only eat what I\nlike. Course, I like a lot of things now, but --",
        "Q: Did it turn you into a vegetarian?",
        "A: No, no. And I like pork, too. I don\u2019t know if I should mention that for the Holocaust\nmuseum. But you see again, interesting, I mean, in Europe, in eastern Europe, we ate\nham, we ate pork. It was -- you know, I never really realized any of that til I came here. I\ndidn\u2019t know about bagels, I didn\u2019t know about Yiddish. This was all, you know, new to\nme, when we came here. And neither did my parents.",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t that partly a class thing?",
        "A: In Europe?",
        "Q: The Yiddish?",
        "A: The English?",
        "Q: Yiddish.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. You know, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I just know how I was raised, and I --\nI don\u2019t think I even knew anybody that was Orthodox there, you know, I really don\u2019t. W-\nW-We belonged to this one Temple that\u2019s -- everybody goes to visit now when they\u2019re in\n-- in Budapest, I didn\u2019t know anybody from anywhere else. And it -- the other thing that\nwas interesting is I went to a public school, and before the war, religious education was\npart of the public school education, and during that period you had English, whatever,\ngeography, history, math, whatever, and then it was religion, and the Catholic kids went\nto their class, and Jewish kids went to their class, and it was, you know, history of -- of\nthe religion. Actually, my very closest friend in Hungary was a Catholic girl, who I tried\nvery hard to get out here. I wrote to the Cardinal and all that, but then I lost track of her.",
        "Q: Have you been back to Budapest?",
        "A: Yes, actually, I\u2019ve been back to Budapest oh, many, many years ago the first time,\nsecond time 20 years ago, and last year it was the best of all, my husband and I took our\noldest grandson, that\u2019s my daughter\u2019s oldest son, who had just been Bar Mitzvahed, and\nwe took him to London and Budapest. And it was really great.",
        "Q: Did you show him where Grandma grew up?",
        "A: I certainly did. We went to the synagogue, we went to, you know, all the places I used\nto visit. We went out to the playgrounds, and where I used to ice skate, and went to hear\nGypsy music, we went to the opera. We didn\u2019t stay there too long, it was ballet, and a 13\nyear old boy is not heavy into ballet. But I just wanted him to see it. The music was\nlovely, and we -- actually I said, let\u2019s go, and we can leave at intermission, which we did.\nAnd we went to hear -- went to see folk dancing, Hungarian folk dancing, and so it was\nwonderful.",
        "Q: What emotions did that bring up for you?",
        "A: Oh, it was just -- I mean, it\u2019s hard to describe, it was -- and he really enjoyed it. Just\nbefore it was time to go, I thought to myself, I must be out of my mind, I mean here we\nare grandparents, he\u2019s 13, he\u2019s going to want to watch basketball game, and you know,\nlook for his friends, and here I\u2019m schlepping him, you know -- actually Budapest was his\nidea, and since we had like eight days, I thought, you know, that\u2019s a bit much, and it was\na great combination. He of all my grandchildren, was the only one that\u2019s really been\ninterested in my history, and the Holocaust. I\u2019ve taken him several times to Washington.\nWe were there for the opening. We\u2019ve been there f -- at the capital, where they have the\nceremony for the Holocaust, and he\u2019s asked me many times to tell my story. When he\nwas quite little, he invited me to Holocaust week at his public school, first grade class,\nand second grade class, as well as his Sunday school class. So I have gone and spoken to\nthe kids, and stuff, and I bought him books on the Holocaust. So he\u2019s read a lot, and is\nquite interested. The other two are not particularly interested. Actually, my daughter took\nthem to see \u201cLife is Beautiful,\u201d and -- and after that, my other two grandchildren sort of\nsaid, you know, what was it like for me, but it was -- took a -- s -- one sentence to\nanswer, and that was it.",
        "Q: How old are your grandchildren?",
        "A: The oldest one is now 14, and the next one 1s 12. The little one\u2019s nine. And my\nhusband has three children, and tho -- and they\u2019re five -- five more on that side, but they\nwere all born since we\u2019re married, so we really -- they\u2019re -- call them my grandchildren\nas well. So they\u2019re eight all together.",
        "Q: It seems like you really identify yourself as a Holocaust survivor.",
        "A: Oh yeah. But probably more so since the Hidden Children conference. And, of course,\nthe museum. I always -- I -- oh, this was years ago, when they were planning -- building\nthe initial plans to build the Holocaust Museum, there was also one built in New York,\nand I know this sounds silly, but I wanted to give a major contribution, and I sort of went\nand interviewed both the Washington people, and New York people, and -- and made a\ndecision, because I support the one in New York a bit, but there was something about the\nWashington. I thought if I was going to give one chunk of money, I\u2019d rather g -- do it one\nplace. And so we went -- we went to Washington to see the original plans, and they were\nin the office, and I went with my mother, and then I went back with my daughter, we\nwent to the hard hat -- th -- walkthrough when the museum was being built. And so that\u2019s\n-- was sort of -- I mean, I\u2019ve never had a problem, or thought about not being Jewish, but\nsomehow the Holocaust was a long time ago. I didn\u2019t remain in contact with any of the\nHungarians, or Holocaust survivors, so that my life kind of went on it\u2019s own metry way.\nEvery once in a while, people will ask me -- the first year that I went to camp -- and I told\nthis on my video, I was like the token refugee, and it\u2019s really funny, cause I\u2019m friendly\nwith a lot of my bunkmates, and they always tease me about my accent, and -- at the\ntime, and about being a -- the token refugee in camp. That was -- I thought it would be\nharder than it turned out to be, and I was very lucky, because I was literally shipped from\nhaving just arrived here at the age of 13, to this very American camp, with baseball, and I\nasked them what those pillows were doing on the baseball field. And I was different, you\nknow. I wore hand en -- embroidered undershirts, and I wrote home that they\nimmediately should send me a bra. And that was definitely European kid, and there\u2019s a\nvery big difference. But I was very lucky, I had some nice friends, and I somehow fit in. I\nthink they picked on somebody else.",
        "Q: Did you speak any English when you came?",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm. And I tur -- I turned out awhile later, that the director of the camp gave\nmy bunk a speech on how to be nice to me, because I might be different, and may not\nspeak English so well, I may not know everything they know. And 13 is late to start\ncamp, they had all been there before, they -- some of them had had friends, and -- but I\ndidn\u2019t know about that til later, so --",
        "Q: Why did your parents decide to send you to camp right away\u201d?",
        "A: Well, we had relatives here, and tha -- actually, these people had honeymooned in -- in\nBudapest, and looked up my parents because they were related somehow or other. And\nthey had a daughter who was couple of years younger than I, and they spoke to them, and\nthey said, \u201cWell, what -- what do you do here during the summer?\u201d And they said, \u201cWell,\nNew York gets pretty hot, and most kids do something, or have a ha -- something.\u201d I\ndon\u2019t really know exactly what the conversation was all about, but next thing they were --\nthis lady came over and showed us pictures of a camp, and I got camp clothes, and went\noff to cam, that\u2019s how. And the cousin, whose daughter went to this camp that I was sent\nto, had nothing to do with me, and she was two years younger than I, and at that age it\u2019s\nlike a generation. I mean, even nine months, 10 months, is -- is a big deal. But, that she\nwas in a different bunk, and she wasn\u2019t going to have anything to do with me, so -- \u2019'm\nfriendly with her now, but we weren\u2019t for a long time.",
        "Q: Given the -- the time that you and your -- your parents were kind of camping out as it -\n- as it -- in -- in effect, when you were fleeing --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- [indecipherable] you were with lots of other families and stuff, why would your\nfamily send you away\u201d?",
        "A: Hm. I don\u2019t know. I hadn\u2019t really thought about it. The war ended in \u201945, this was in\n\"47. I think my parents wanted me to assimilate, and I think they thought this would be a\ngood way for me to become an American teenager. I don\u2019t know. I have no clue. I -- I\nhad no problem going. I had a wonderful time, I went back two years. I still have a lot of\nclose friends from camp. My daughter went to the same camp. So, I -- I don\u2019t know. I\nmean, somebody else might have handled it differently, I don\u2019t know. My parents had the\nopportunity to send me to a monastery to be taken care of by nuns, during the war time,\nand then they made the decision to stay together. So --",
        "Q: How important -- It -- It seems like that was so key to your family, that the three of\nyou --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- stay together. Has that been important to you, when you had a child too, that you\nstay [indecipherable]",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah. Yeah, and we did, I mean, until -- until she went off to college, and\nthen subsequently got married.",
        "Q: You talk on the previous tape about your 10\" birthday.",
        "A: Oh yes, my 10\" birthday. That\u2019s when the Germans marched in, yeah, that was quite a\nbirthday. I still like hot dogs, that\u2019s what we had then. That\u2019s what we had for my\nbirthday party, hot dogs, frankfurters. Not served on buns. And we had a -- an apartment\nin the city, kind of a wide boulevard kind of a street, and we were all sitting around, lot of\nnannies, and mothers, and daughters, and we heard noises, like marching noises. And we\nlooked out the window, and the Nazis were marching into Budapest. Hungary was the\nlast country to be taken over, and I remember everybody very quietly saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time to\ngo home.\u201d And I was not happy, cause they messed up my party. And it -- you know,\nalso, interestingly enough in those days, parents did not find it necessary to explain\neverything to their children. I mean, they were going home, that\u2019s it, you know. That\u2019s --\nWas nothing to question, and you didn\u2019t, so --",
        "Q: How do you feel about birthdays now?",
        "A: Oh, I love birthdays, I just had my husband\u2019s 70\" birthday, and surprised him, we\ntook the whole family to Las Vegas for the weekend. So that answers your question.\nYeah, I like birthdays.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t have any baggage about your birthday?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Still eat hot dogs on your birthday?",
        "A: No, but I still eat hot dogs. Actually, ve stopped because of cholesterol, but my\nfavorite lunch 1s a [indecipherable] hot dog and fresh orange juice on the street.",
        "Q: It sounds like you were pretty enterprising when you were a little kid, with the --\ntaking the cigarette butts, and --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: -- [indecipherable] things.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t smoke.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t?",
        "A: No, no, I never did actually. I smoked one evening with -- with a friend of mine that I\nwent to junior high school with, that was my next closest friend, right after camp, I went\nto junior high school, eighth grade, on the west side, and -- and she\u2019s still -- we\u2019re still\nvery good friends. We were in her parents bedroom, and we smoked a cigarette. This\nwas, I think 14. Her mother came in and pretended she didn\u2019t know, cause we stuck the\ncigarettes under the bed, but the room was filled with smoke. And I hated it, I was like\nchoking, and my eyes were bothering me. I said, \u201cThis is a stupid thing to do.\u201d But it was\ngrown up, which is I think what a lot of young people s -- got hooked on it now.",
        "Q: But when you did that as a -- as a small child, when you and your -- your boyfriend, I\nguess it was --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- did that --",
        "A: IT have to call him.",
        "Q: -- i-in -- in New York, as you know, we would call that working the angles.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is that something that you carried over as an adult?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I think that\u2019s probably -- most of it was\nhis idea, and I kind of went along with it. He\u2019s a year older, he lives in Toronto. I don\u2019t\nknow, it just seemed like a fun thing to do, it kept us busy. We all were aware of the fact\nthat our fathers weren\u2019t working. We thought that this would be an income situation, and\neverybody was delighted. I mean, they were very -- there were no cigarettes to be had, a\nlot of people smoked, my parents did not. And it was fun.",
        "Q: Were your parents worried about money at that time?",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "Q: But you just had a sense that you needed to do this?",
        "A: Yeah. I was never worried about money, I mean, I was never worried about money\nwhen we didn\u2019t have any, and I was never worried about it when we did, you know, it all\n-- and it was -- it was never really a major issue. My parents were very good about -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t know, 1-it\u2019s hard to explain. I think, for my mother, 1t was very important to have\nproper appearances, and contrary to a lot of people during the war, who had holes and\nstuff in their clothes, and I\u2019d -- I al -- I remember that very clearly, there was -- there\nwere never any holes in anything, it was always mended. When I outgrew the dress, my\nmother would take from another dress, and lengthen it. This is when the war was going\non, and shortly after when there -- first there was nothing to buy, and no material, no\nmoney, you know, and all that, but I remember always looking clean and neat, and you\nknow, the war was not a reason to not behave properly, and not to look nice. And it\u2019s\nfunny, because I said that to my husband just recently, and it sort of -- you look at some\nof these old war pictures, how people were going to concentration camp with suits and\nties and hats. It\u2019s funny, I was watching -- we were watching \u201cRoman Holiday,\u201d -- oh,\n\u201cThree Coins in a Fountain\u201d last night, and I said to my husband that I think I was in the\nwrong generation because Louis Jordan looks so wonderful, and here they\u2019re walking\naround in ridiculous places, and he\u2019s in double breasted suits, and a tie, and she has\ngloves on, and a hat. And, you know, he opens doors, and I said, you know, always\nwalking around now in jeans and khakis, sort of, you know, casual, because that\u2019s the\nworld we live in, but I think I kind of like that.",
        "Q: So if you could, you would -- you would wear gloves to go out, and hats, and --",
        "A: Well, maybe not gloves, but yeah, I mean I kind of like -- I can go either way, P\u2019ve\nalways said that. I mean, I\u2019d have no problem having tea with the queen, or camping out\nin jeans. You know, I -- I\u2019m fairly comfortable wherever you -- you put me, and so --",
        "Q: One of the things that you said in the previous tape was that you need to know where\nyou\u2019re sleeping.",
        "A: Yes, that I still do. I don\u2019t like going anywhere, and not having a reservation, I really\ndon\u2019t. And I mean it\u2019s -- it -- it\u2019s -- I\u2019m not scared the way I was, and I know where it\u2019s\ncoming from, and if I didn\u2019t, I probably wouldn\u2019t, you know, have a nervous breakdown,\nbut I know a couple of years ago, we were coming back, I don\u2019t know, from Boston or\nsomeplace, and we couldn\u2019t get in somewhere, you know, just at a hotel, a motel,\nwhatever on the road, because it was getting late. And I really was -- it made me\nuncomfortable. So, that should be the worst thing, you know. I still like traveling with my\npillow. I still do, really. Actually, I was just thinking, tomorrow with the two children,\nwith carry-ons, if I\u2019ve got room for my pillow, but I\u2019m going to see.",
        "Q: Why the pillow?",
        "A: Because that\u2019s the one thing I took with me. You know, like little children have\nblankies and all these things, I had my pillow. And I had that same pillow for many,\nmany years. It\u2019s gone, I mean the feathers, or whatever was in there is gone, but I always\nliked having my own pillow. I think it\u2019s not for the reasons any more, I -- I don\u2019t sleep so\n-- as well as I did, and most hotels have these awful foam rubber things, so I d -- I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s anything to do with the war, I just -- I don\u2019t sleep well, and if I -- if I have a bad\npillow, I\u2019m really up all night, so I like to take my soft, cuddly pillow.",
        "Q: Down pillow?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, and it really mooshes up sort of small, so I can, you know, stick in into a\nduffel, and carry it.",
        "Q: Do you have the pillowcase from your childhood pillow?",
        "A: No. No, I don\u2019t, no.",
        "Q: Did you take it with you to America?",
        "A: No. Well, I didn\u2019t do any of the packing, so no. Actually, my grandson was Bar Mitzv\n-- was -- when he was born and -- and circumcised, he wore my grandfather\u2019s little dress\nthat my mother had saved. I have no clue how we got through a war, and my mother\nbrought stuff. I mean, it\u2019s mind boggling now that I\u2019m going over a lot of the things, it\u2019s\njust amazing, the pictures and things that she has, that you think would have stayed there.\nSo -- But she has a lot -- you know, a lot of stuff, pre-war. She has calendars and date\nbooks from 50 - 60 years ago, that she sent here after the war, so -- I mean, they all came\non a boat or something.",
        "Q: So she had put things aside for when you got here?",
        "A: Mm-hm. It all got shipped, we shipped all our furniture, and dishes, and all that kind\nof stuff, so whatever was packed, is here.",
        "Q: So, in a sense you\u2019ve created part, at least, of your physical life.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Oh yeah, I mean some of the furniture my parents had to sell, because it\ndidn\u2019t fit into any apartments here, because the rooms were big, the ceilings were high,\nand you know, all that. But my mother\u2019s bedroom, dining room, living room, 1s all the\nEuropean furniture. And it\u2019s very European looking, except it has wall to wall carpets,\ninstead of rugs.",
        "Q: So when you go visit your mother, you see part of your childhood?",
        "A: Oh yeah. And actually, my father had a beautiful desk that my mother sold after he\ndied, and I was always sorry. It was a beautiful desk, I never -- I really don\u2019t know why\nshe sold it.",
        "Q: When you go see that furniture, do you then ever go back in your mind to when you\nwere a little girl? [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, I sort of remember our old apartment, but you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s\nfading a little. Sometimes I don\u2019t know if I remember the real thing, or if I remember\nstories or pictures, you know. I mean, as I told you, I\u2019ve been married twice, and I would\nhave been married 44 years all together, and every time I bought new dishes, I\u2019ve always\nbought it kind of half-heartedly, because my favorite dishes, my mother has. And I\nalways sort of in back of my head, knew that one of these days, hopefully the far away,\nthose would be mine, so why should I bother? I mean, I\u2019ve perfectly nice dishes, but I -- I\njust love her Haron dishes, which is Hungarian. And she has all, I think place setting for\n24, and the whole thing, so -- and that all was sent over, crystal and all that kind of stuff.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] nice things is important to you?",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s funny, cause now that my mother is not well, you sort of think\nabout what happens if, and you know, I\u2019ve thought about some of the things that she has,\nand you know, it\u2019s a different lifestyle, and I don\u2019t know how -- if I\u2019d have any room, but\nthere\u2019s a grandfather\u2019s clock that I really love, and that\u2019s sort of my -- the only thing\nthat\u2019s really my childhood. I mean, otherwise it\u2019s just nice furniture, but -- and it\u2019s old\nand it\u2019s beautiful, but it\u2019s not something -- but the clock is like, sort of my childhood. It\u2019s\na grandfather\u2019s clock, drives you nuts, chimes every 15 minutes.",
        "Q: When you were in hiding, did time take on a different meaning for you?",
        "A: Did time take on a different meaning? I don\u2019t know. I mean, had days and nights, you\nknow, and they were long. I don\u2019t know. I really can\u2019t answer that. I know I -- I don\u2019t --\nwe didn\u2019t have beds, we usually slept on the floor on things, and I was always in the\nmiddle, between my parents. I\u2019m an only child. We had to go to the bathroom outside, so\nthat was a big deal. I don\u2019t know, I -- I think they all -- there was always something to a-\namuse me. The -- Sometimes there were other children, depending on where we were. I\ndon\u2019t know, I -- I don\u2019t really remember.",
        "Q: When you came to this country, when your parents decided to come, did they tell you?",
        "A: Oh yes, there was a lot of packing going on. We were -- It was sort of on again, off\nagain. My grandparents were here, and my grandmother died. My uncle, my mother\u2019s\nbrother, also had come, in 1941 to visit his parents, and stayed, and actually joined the\nAmerican army, and came to see us in Budapest after the war, part of the liberation. So\nwe were coming as vi -- on a visitor visa, but sort of planning to stay, and so we pa --\nthey packed, I mean, we had packers, and marked things, and all that. So that\u2019s how come\nall the furniture. Not everything we packed came, cause they confiscated stuff. My\nfather\u2019s paintings, library paintings, we had a Steinway Baby Grand, that didn\u2019t show up,\nit\u2019s just as well. But all the, you know, dishes, and personal stuff, and furniture came. So\nI was definitely aware wi -- this boy -- my boyfriend who\u2019s in Toronto, he gave me a\ncharm that I still have, went to the train to see us off, and another -- my other friend gave\nme a charm, and it was an adventure. I don\u2019t remember being terribly sad about the\nwhole thing, we -- we were traveling. After the war, my mother and I went to Switzerland\nand met my grandfather, and then came back, and we came -- we went to Liverpool, and\nwe took a beautiful Cuinard boat, the Mauritania, which doesn\u2019t exist any more, but it\u2019s --\nit was a beautiful boat, was very fancy. I had a wonderful time calling for room service,\nand running around. My mother was quite ill, she got seasick and she didn\u2019t wear all the\nnice clothes that she had planned to wear. And so I spent a lot of time with my father.\nSaw lots of good movies, Joan Crawford. And then when we got here, my grandfather\nwas here, and my uncle, who had married, and I\u2019m very, very close to -- well, she was at\nthe time nine -- 20 years old, so -- but I was 13, but we, you know, really very close\nfriends. And as I said, I assimilated very, very quickly.",
        "Q: What charms did your fr -- did your friends give you?",
        "A: One little gold charm -- charm -- well, I had a charm bracelet, and it just says, Thomas\n-- to Eva, and Tommy, that was his name. And we talk occasionally, because his mother\nand my mother were best friends. So were our fathers, but they all -- they died, and his\nmother is -- is in a nursing home. She -- Her mind is fine, and physically she\u2019s a disaster,\nwith my mother it\u2019s the other way around. But my mother is very, very close to Tom.\nActually, throughout all these years, they stayed closer. We talk, but it\u2019s usually about\nour mothers, because his life sort of went in a different direction. He\u2019s married, but he\u2019s\nseparated, he\u2019s -- doesn\u2019t have any children. He\u2019s very European. And -- And I\u2019m really\nbeca -- you know, assimilated, much more so.",
        "Q: Are you an American citizen?",
        "A: Me?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: So what was the other charm that you were given?",
        "A: The other charm was from -- that was silver, this one was gold, was just a little --\nplain, little silver charm from my friend, the Catholic girl, actually, that I told you about,\nGloria was her name.",
        "Q: Do you look at these charms?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I don\u2019t wear them, but yes I do.",
        "Q: What kinds of memories does that bring up for you?",
        "A: Oh, wonderful memories. And actually, with my Hidden Children group, a number of\nyears ago, this woman walks into my apartment -- and most of the woman are from the\nNew York area, and she was in -- oh, that\u2019s my husband, I didn\u2019t tell him you were\ncoming. Oh, that\u2019s all right, he\u2019s going that way. Came from Boston, so she was like\nvisiting our group, and she looked at me, she said, \u201cWhat was your maiden name?\u201d So I\nsaid, \u201cBrust.\u201d She says, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me?\u201d I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t got a clue.\u201d Well, I\nthink she may have known in advance. Anyhow, we went to grade school together, and I\nfound my -- what do you call that thing you sign in school? Not a memory --",
        "Q: A yearbook?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s not a yearbook, it\u2019s, you know, roses are red, violets are blue, you sign this\nlittle autograph -- isn\u2019t 1t an autograph book? It\u2019s got a name. It\u2019s not a yearbook, it\u2019s just\nblanks, and --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape two, side A, interview with Eva Cooper. Okay, so you saw this autograph\nbook.",
        "A: Yeah, and she had written in it. It was really bizarre. And then, of course, we went\nthrough the whole thing, and there were a lot of, you know, it wa -- I mean, this Tommy\nfrom Toronto is in there, too. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay, so you came -- you were on this luxury liner, coming to the United States.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What did you think you would find here? Do you remember, back then?",
        "A: My grandfather, my uncle. I don\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t really, you know, think about it all that\nmuch.",
        "Q: Did you see the Statue of Liberty?",
        "A: Yes, saw the Statue of Liberty.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- Everybody was sort of making a big fuss about it, I don\u2019t think I really knew\ntoo much about what it was. I remember getting up early, and -- as the boat came in. We\nwent to -- My grandfather and grandmother, when they first came here -- she died, but he\nstayed there, stayed at a residential hotel on 96\" Street and West End Avenue, called the\nMarcy. The place is still there, but it\u2019s not a residential hotel any more, and so my\ngrandfather took a small apartment for us there. So that\u2019s where we started out. I didn\u2019t\nthink that was so great. I mean, you know, it was a small apartment, and -- but there was\nan ice skating ring across the street, and a tennis court. It was a city thing, but it changed,\nyou know, winter and summer. And then, as I said, I -- within a month or two, I was\ngone, in camp, and then I started junior high school. That apartment was really very\nsmall, was like a one bedroom apartment, and then we moved into a -- another residential\nhotel k-kind of a thing on 86\" Street. That\u2019s still there, it\u2019s called the Brewster Hotel, and\nthat\u2019s when I started junior high school [indecipherable]. And my parents were looking\nfor an apartment, and waiting for the furniture to come out. Oh no, the furniture went to\nManhattan storage, but we didn\u2019t have an apartment, and was very hard to find one. I\ndon\u2019t know if it had to do with size or money, but you know, we was definitely staying in\nManhattan, in a nice neighborhood, so -- but I -- you know, I didn\u2019t know where one\nwould go, or anything like that.",
        "Q: Did your uncle and grandfather meet you at the boat?",
        "A: Yeah, oh yes, I was very close to my uncle. He was already married, and then he\nbrought his young and very beautiful wife along. And they had a baby shortly after, so I\nbecame cousin.",
        "Q: Do you remember what the landing was like when you arrived here?",
        "A: Exciting. Lot of people, lot of people waiting. I mean, I didn\u2019t go through Ellis Island,\nor one of those things, you know, we were coming out first class, so 1t was a perfectly\nnice landing, and everybody was very happy, and we, every Sunday went to some\nHungarian restaurant, cause that\u2019s where my grandfather liked to go, and there were a lot\nof people that my parents knew from Europe, so they very quickly ended up with a\nnucleus of friends. My parents, I don\u2019t quite know why, but I was like the oldest child, so\neven though they all had children, they were all younger, and I was never -- I knew of\nthem, and knew them, but wi -- I was never friendly with any of those Hungarian\nchildren. And I made friends at camp, I made friends at junior high school, and I made\nmy own friends. I was occasionally embarrassed by my parent\u2019s accent, in the beginning.\nI wa -- But, it wa -- it was funny, I mean, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s ver -- kind of a snotty, childish\nkind of a thing, because our apartment once we moved, was very nice. And it was ina\nvery nice building, and by that time I guess I was a little older, so I was conscious of\nneighborhoods and stuff, and so the accent, and the apartment kind of, you know, evened\nout. I mean, my parents spoke with an accent, but with an educated accent, and -- but I\nwas definitely aware of it. When they came to visit in camp, you know it was a little --\nbut they were young. I mean, I was 21 -- my mother was 21 when I was -- 21 when she\nwas married, and 22 when I was born, or something. My father was 12 years older, but\nthat was customary in Europe, to have the man established before he takes a bride.",
        "Q: How soon before you felt more American than Hungarian?",
        "A: You know, I\u2019ve thought about that a lot. I don\u2019t know. I think very quickly. And I\nthink that\u2019s because of the circles I got thrown into. My only connection to the past,\nreally, was my parents, and the a -- and their -- their accent, which was definitely\nEuropean. But I became American, you know, really very quickly. It\u2019s interesting, my --\nmy son-in-law has an associate at his firm, and they adopted a Hungarian orphan, just\nrecently, maybe four or five years ago. And they were a little older, they couldn\u2019t have\nchildren, they gave up on adoption here. I guess they heard about eastern European\nchildren, they went there several times, then, make a very long story short, adopted a\nlittle girl, who they went to Europe to get. And -- And my daughter mentioned to this\nwoman about me, and would that be a good -- well, she thought that was a great idea,\ncause this child did not speak English, she was five years old, and petrified. And so I\nwent up to Connecticut, and I met with her. Well, I tell you, by the time that day was\nover, my daughter and I both wanted to adopt this child, and -- and tell this other lady to\ngo away, because she had just no clue. I mean, she wanted to give the kid pizza, this kid\ndidn\u2019t know from pizza. Whatever she was offering her were all -- all the wrong things.\nAnd she meant well, but she came from a different mindset, and -- so I was trying to\nexplain to both of them. And she was perfectly happy in the orphanage. I mean, that was\nher world. These were her friends, and her language, and she was totally uprooted from\nher home, and sent here, and was told that she should appreciate the color TV, and the --\nand the pizza. She is now as American as apple pie. I don\u2019t know, maybe she\u2019s 10 years\nold. I don\u2019t -- I think she\u2019s going through a stage, cause I saw her, I think, the summer\nbefore last, and I said something to her in Hungarian, she didn\u2019t respond. And I picked\nup on it immediately, and then I just switched to English, and told her I was happy to see\nher. I don\u2019t know if she was embarrassed about it, or what, but I got the message. And I\nthink it\u2019ll be a while before she\u2019s able to look back. But her circumstances were different.\nAnd I s -- I -- when I met the mother, she said someday they were going to plan a trip to\nEurope, and -- but I\u2019m not sure going back to some orphanage 1s the same thing. I mean,\nwhen I go back, and have gone back, I have very fond memories, including the war. I\ncertainly wouldn\u2019t want to move back. But it\u2019s -- it -- you know, it\u2019s -- I sometimes\ndream in Hungarian, and I some -- and I count in Hungarian. If I just want to count, you\nknow, a small column in my head or something, which is really weird, cause I don\u2019t\nspeak Hungarian unless I ha -- unless I have to. Well, that\u2019s not true, a taxi driver, if I see\nhis name\u2019s Hungarian, I'll -- my hairdresser\u2019s Hungarian, so I do fall into that.",
        "Q: Do you collect the work of any Hungarian artists?",
        "A: No, no. And not for any reason, I -- no, no.",
        "Q: Cause there are, you know, I mean, in this --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- I was thinking of a photographer I know, and he\u2019s Hungarian. [indecipherable]",
        "A: I mean, there\u2019s some very famous ones that are Hungarian, that I would like to collect,\nbut those are very expensive. Actually, for the first time about a -- a month ago, I went to\nthe Hungarian consulate, which is a gorgeous, gorgeous brownstone in the east 60\u2019s,\nbecause this friend of mine from Boston, that I went to school with, is a wonderful\nphotographer. That\u2019s not what she does to earn her living, and she would love to become\nan -- you know, more established, and she just hasn\u2019t found -- she does some wonderful,\nwonderful things. It\u2019d be great for corporate art, and I was trying to see if I could help\nher, but I haven\u2019t done too well. She had an exhibit there, but that\u2019s a dead end thing. I\nmean, who was going to go there, a lot of her Hungarian friends? Nothing much\nhappened.",
        "Q: So, dreaming -- dreaming in Hungarian, counting in Hungarian --",
        "A: Mostly counting, the dreaming is mixed, but every once in awhile, I wake up and\nrealize that I was -- yeah, I\u2019m sorry, did I interrupt you?",
        "Q: No, no, I mean, this is about you [indecipherable] question.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: Are you -- you think of yourself -- yourself now as Hungarian, American, Hungarian-\nAmerican, American-Hungarian, Jewish-American-Hungarian, how do you --",
        "A: Oh, God. Well, definitely not Hungarian first. I would definitely -- probably American\nJewish Hungarian.",
        "Q: Hungarian last?",
        "A: I think so, yeah. I mean, do you realize, I\u2019m 65 years old, and I\u2019ve been here 52 years,\nyou know? And I haven\u2019t had -- I mean, some of my Hidden Children friends are -- speak\nHungarian all the time with each other. This one in Boston is -- she wrote to me in\nHungarian once. I mean, I was able to read it, but with a great deal of difficulty. I said,\ndon\u2019t do this to me again, cause I -- you know, I speak it, but with difficulty. But some of\nthem are definitely living more in a Hungarian world than I. I don\u2019t really live ina\nHungarian world, and it\u2019s only because of the Hidden Children that I\u2019ve even had\ncontact, and became very friendly with some of them, just because I like them, not\nbecause they\u2019re Hungarian, which is very interesting 1n our group. And I think the group\nis kind of changing focus a little, because in the beginning, when we first met at the\nconference, there was this bond, Hungarian Jewish. We formed the group Hidden, not a\nconcentration camp, so a very different -- you know, who you could be in order to belong\nto this group. And we meet in New York, and there are a handful of people who have\napartments in New York, I -- everybody else outside of New York, nobody wants to go\nto Forest Hills, New Jersey, Brooklyn, so the New Yorkers have been, you know having\nthe meetings, which is fine. And there\u2019s some very, very nice people. But the fact that\nyou\u2019re Hungarian and Jewish is not enough to have a relationship. I mean, there are other\nthings in your life that have to work, interests, and what -- what has happened to your\nlife? How are you living, you know, and all that. And -- I mean, there are some really,\nreally nice ladies, who live in Brooklyn, who are very Orthodox, I have absolutely\nnothing in common with them. So --",
        "Q: The notion of -- of hidden children, are there still parts of you that are in hiding?",
        "A: I'd have to be in analysis to answer you, and I\u2019ve never been, so I don\u2019t know.\nProbably, but again, you know, I\u2019m never quite sure -- and we\u2019ve had this discussion with\nthe Hidden Children, how much of -- of one\u2019s being can be blamed on the war. A-As I\nmentioned to you before, at one point, everybody said, everyone that was divorced had to\ndo with the Holocaust. I was divorced, I don\u2019t think it had anything whatsoever to do\nwith the Holocaust. One woman said she purposely married a non-Jew, to avoid\npossibility of this happening again. She has a daughter who 1s a teacher, [indecipherable]\nshalum, which is a synagogue affiliated school. She did get divorced, if it had anything to\ndo with anything, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: How did you meet your first husband?",
        "A: My neighbor on Riverside Drive, where we lived, said she had a nice Jewish boy\nshe\u2019d like me to meet. I know, what can I tell you? I was 20 years old, and -- and that\u2019s\nhow we met.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Elihu, E-l-i-h-u Tergel, that\u2019s my daughter\u2019s maiden name. And -- And you know, it\nwas just a regular boy meets girl, we went out, we, you know, fell in love, we got\nmarried, we had a nice wedding at the Hampshire House, and we moved from a one\nbedroom, to a two bedroom, to a six room, you know, with a upward mobility, and then\nwe, you know, started out working, and you know, did a little better along the way, and\nwe had a daughter, we have a daughter. We didn\u2019t have more children, which was stupid.\nI was pregnant at 40 and decided I was too old. If I had this generation now, it\u2019d be just\nstarting out. I think about that, and at some point, which has nothing whatsoever to do\nwith the Holocaust, we just fell apart, which makes me sad. I mean, I\u2019m -- was very lucky\nto meet my husband, married over 20 years, but I think 1t would have been kind of nice to\nbe married 44 years, happily, to the same person. You know, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s an upheaval, and\nI felt badly, you know, for my daughter, but she handled it very well, and I think she was\ndefinitely more for it than against it. But I think it\u2019s -- I think in any divorce, you know,\nchildren tend to -- are formed by it somewhat, you know.",
        "Q: What did your ex-husband do?",
        "A: He was an engineer, was in air conditioning, he installed -- I\u2019m always looking up\nwhen I say that -- commercial ducts, for the air to go through.",
        "Q: How old was he when you met him?",
        "A: I was 21 when I was married, I must -- I remember, I was 19 - 20, and he was like four\nyears older.",
        "Q: And how long til you had th -- had Lisa?",
        "A: Within two years. Yeah, I was 23.",
        "Q: That\u2019s [indecipherable] like your mom.",
        "A: Yeah, except I was born nine months after she was married, so she was a year\nyounger. And actually, Lisa was pretty young by today\u2019s standards. She\u2019ll be 42 on July\nfirst. And so she was 27, going on -- you know, when Adam was -- which 1s still pretty\nyoung by today\u2019s standards. But she, of course, has three. I think she\u2019s trying to tell me\nsomething about only children.",
        "Q: Did -- Do you -- How do you feel that being an only child affected both your chances\nfor survival as a child, and the way you [indecipherable] as you\u2019ve grown up?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know about survival, but probably -- it\u2019s probably easier than if there had\nbeen more of us, you know, I don\u2019t know. I never really had a problem about being an\nonly child, I was -- again, I don\u2019t know what it would have been like, I mean, all these\nwonderful people that have siblings hate each other\u2019s guts, don\u2019t talk to each other, fight,\nI don\u2019t know. I think at some point, be -- you know, when I was a little older, when\neverybo -- in Europe a lot of my friends were only children, so I don\u2019t think I -- this Tom\nin Toronto is an only child. A lot of my friends that I grew up with there were only\nchildren, so I didn\u2019t really give it much thought. Once we came here, you know, I was 13\nyears old, so, it\u2019s just the way it was.",
        "Q: Were you confirmed or Bat Mitzvahed?",
        "A: Yeah, I was confirmed at Emmanuel. They didn\u2019t have Bat Mitzvah then, they do\nnow. The rabbi then thought there was too much emphasis on the Bar, and not enough on\nthe Mitzvah. This is probably true. But they did -- that rabbi retired, and a new rabbi\n[inaudible] Bat Mitzvahed now. But I was confirmed, and Lisa was confirmed, too.",
        "Q: Same Temple?",
        "A: Same Temple. They didn\u2019t have them then, either. Actually, my daughter was Bat\nMitzvahed a couple years ago, at her synagogue in Connecticut. Yeah, she just went a-\nadult education [indecipherable |",
        "Q: So [indecipherable] and then that fell apart.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Then how old would [indecipherable]",
        "A: She was in -- just before she graduated college.",
        "Q: So, she was an adult.",
        "A: So she was an adult, yeah. And we -- we really stayed in the apartment she grew up in,\nright around the corner from here. It\u2019s really weird, I mean, it\u2019s so weird, cause I -- my\nkitchen window, you can see my old apartment, and we go to Connecticut, to exactly the\nsame place I went to when she was little, and she\u2019s moved there permanently, so it\u2019s like,\nI don\u2019t know what that\u2019 lI tell you.",
        "Q: How -- How\u2019d you meet your second husband?",
        "A: I met my second husband in Acapulco, quite by accident [indecipherable] and as I\nsaid, we\u2019ve been married for 20 -- it was 20 years in September, and all the children have\nbeen -- grandchildren have been born since we\u2019re married, so even though there\u2019s mine\nand his, we really refer to the children as collectively ours, sometimes.",
        "Q: When they behave?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You -- You said that 1t was just kind of almost natural that you\u2019re very\n[indecipherable]. Why is that important? Why is it --",
        "A: I -- You know, I -- I didn\u2019t say it was important, I just said it happened. I didn\u2019t date\nanybody, I didn\u2019t know anybody that wasn\u2019t Jewish, and it\u2019s really weird, because it\u2019s not\nthat -- I mean, New York is a big city, and I don\u2019t live in a Jewish community. But I\nremember one year, and that made an impression on me, I went to -- after I finished with\nmy camp, the one I started out with, my parents thought that was enough of that already,\nand they thought I should brush up on my French, which I knew when I left Europe, and I\ndon\u2019t any more, either. But I went to another camp in Maine, that was a French camp.\nAnd you were supposed to speak French for the summer. And there were a bunch of girls,\nI don\u2019t remember I bi -- I remember it was an odd number, and I\u2019ve no idea how, and I\nhad no idea who anybody was, I didn\u2019t know anybody there, but it turned out that by the\nend of the summer, the way the pairing off went with friends, I was friendly with a\nJewish girl, two Catholic girls were friendly with each other, two Protestants were\nfriendly, and I don\u2019t even know who the other one was. And nobody said my name is, I\nam Jewish. And, I mean Brust was my last name, you know, it wasn\u2019t like Cohn or\nsomething, Goldstein. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And now, are most of your friends, are they Jewish?",
        "A: Yeah. There are intermarriages, and there -- you know, a couple of exceptions. And\nit\u2019s not by choice, you know, I don\u2019t mean -- I don\u2019t go around again, interviewing\npeople. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Cooper is your last name from?",
        "A: My husband. It used to be Cohn, but he changed it, and nothing to do with me. It's\ninteresting. He -- He has two brothers and a sister, well the sister has her own married\nname, but one brother stayed Cohn, and his older brother became Cooper, and my\nhusband joined him in the Cooper part.",
        "Q: What does your husband do?",
        "A: My husband\u2019s in real estate. Their -- The family before was Cohn even, I think was\nPiadagorsky, because they came from Russia, and when they came through Ellis Island,\nor wherever, I think they became Cohn, because it was just to pick the name that was\neasy, or some such thing, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: Do you feel that the -- given your history, that just you have some more commonality\nwith Jews than you might with other people that [indecipherable] level, or --",
        "A: You know, I -- I -- I -- I really don\u2019t know. I -- I wonder about that. One of my\nhusband\u2019s -- my husband has three children. His two sons, they\u2019re married to Jewish\ngirls, his daughter\u2019s married to a non-Jewish, very nice young man. I find that there\u2019s a\ndifference in culture. I remember when we first met his parents, there were two incidents\nthat made such an impression on me, and they\u2019re married, I don\u2019t know, 16 - 17 years.\nThis young man\u2019s stepfather was telling a story about some incident, and how he was so\nlucky to have met up with Mussolini\u2019s doctor in Europe. I wasn\u2019t so excited by that story.\nAnd then we were talking about some -- something else at dinner, and they were talking\nabout, you know, that Jewish lady comedian on TV. And I was going to say, what is this\nJewish lady comedian. She has a name, she has a profession, but what\u2019s this with the\nJewish lady? And I was very uncomfortable with that. And I don\u2019t think I carry religion,\nyou know, on my shoulder. I\u2019m probably less religious than some of my friends. Some\npeople say I belong to the church on Fifth Avenue, and all that kind of stuff. But there 1s\nsort of a -- you know, a different way of looking at things, and we have a whole bunch of\nfriends who have either Gentile wives or husbands. I think most of them sort of\nassimilated more into being Jewish than not, you know? So, I -- I mean -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Y-You had talked on the -- indicated about your father meeting Eichmann.",

        "A: Mm-hm.",

        "A: Oh, I\u2019ve a terrible -- I\u2019m really bad, I mean I -- I -- I don\u2019t buy German products, I will\nnot go to Germany. It has nothing to do with forgive, forget, all these cliches, I just -- I\ndon\u2019t like them, I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with them. I think they would do it\nall over again if they had the first opportunity. I know it\u2019s a terrible thing to say, it\u2019s a\nprejudice, I try very hard not to do that. I saw a wonderful bag on sale, and I turned it\nover, and it said it\u2019s made in Germany, and I -- I love bargains, I love sales, I put it down,\nI walked out. It\u2019s my -- for lack of a good English word, mishigos, you know, it\u2019s -- that\u2019s\nit.",
        "Q: How about listening to Wagner? You said you ha -- you like to go to the symphony\nopera --",
        "A: Yeah, actually I don\u2019t go to the opera that much, and no, I haven\u2019t listened to Wagner.\nI just -- The other day on the radio, there was this whole thing -- I wasn\u2019t quite sure who\nwas being interviewed, but this guy was saying about he has a big problem with people\nthat object to Wagner because of his political views, and that people should really listen\nto the music, and forget about. I don\u2019t know. It depends on how argumentative, or who I\nwant to argue with. It\u2019s like Vanessa Redgrave. She\u2019s a wonderful actress. I don\u2019t like her\npolitical views. On the other hand, I don\u2019t have to force my political views on anyone,\nnor do they have to, so I can separate the two. My problem is with the whole German\nconcept, and when I took Adam, my oldest grandson, and his brother -- the little one\nwasn\u2019t around the first time -- no, wasn\u2019t the first time, was the second time to Disney, wi\n-- no, with all three, we took all three boys to Disney a couple of years ago, and we didn\u2019t\nhave dinner reservations, and we were dragging, and it was hot, and we stayed -- we were\ngoing through Epcot, and we walked into a couple of places, and they just couldn\u2019t take\nus, there were five of us. Ended up in a German brauhaus restaurant. I hated it. I mean\nthey did the oompa pa and the whole thing, and they had the knockwurst and the this\nwurst and the that wurst. And Adam was the only one who said, \u201cGrandma, I can\u2019t\nbelieve we\u2019re having dinner here.\u201d And I said, \u201cAdam, I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re having\ndinner here either, but you guys were all hungry, so here we are.\u201d But I definitely did not\nlike eating there.",
        "Q: How about when you hear the German language?",
        "A: I hate the German language. I hate listening to it. I spoke it fluently as a child, I spoke\nit pat -- when I learned how to speak it, Hungarian, I | -- I spoke German. Not Yiddish,\nGerman. I had a German fraulein when I was very little. Then I had an English nanny,\nand then I had a French mademoiselle, and I was very smart, and now I\u2019m not so smart\nany more, cause I really don\u2019t speak any other lang -- I mean, I -- when I\u2019m in France, I\ncan fake French a little, but it\u2019s really a shame because I -- I did speak it fluently. I also\nwas able to read and write Hebrew. I was very smart when I was young. This aging\nprocess is not so good.",

        "Q: Civil Rights Movement?",
        "A: Yeah, the Civil Rights Mo -- yeah, you know what played a -- a bigger part in my life?\nThe Rosenberg trial. I remember that very vividly. Actually, I was in Washington with\ntwo of my friends. It was one of the first times my parents let me go, and I think I must\nhave been either the end of high school, or the beginning of college, because I remember\none friend, but I went to high school and college with her, so I don\u2019t remember where --\nwhat school we were at at the time. But I was quite upset with that whole thing. I don\u2019t\nknow if it was because they were Jewish, or the whole process of being executed, and --\nthere was a whole different sense of being an American, so I had kind of mixed feelings\nabout, you know, capital punishment, and -- and all that kind of stuff. \u2019ve changed back\nand forth a number of times on that issue. I remember seeing a movie called \u201cDeath\nWish,\u201d there were several -- I think it was called \u201cDeath Wish.\u201d There were several after.\nOne of them was filmed in my mother\u2019s building, and the -- what\u2019s his name was a\nvigilante.",
        "Q: Charles Bronson.",

She used to work for Geraldo Rivera when he was very young, and\ndoing all sorts of good stuff, wore clogs and stuff. And when she saw that movie, she\nsaid, \u201cYou know what? Maybe there is something to capital punishment.\u201d Because that\nwas a mother being raped, and a daughter witnessing, and all that kind of stuff, so I can --\nI can go back and forth on that issue.",

        "Q: Were you a strong mother?",
        "A: I think so. In so many ways, I -- 1t was a different generation. You know, I was more\ncourteous and respectful with my mother. I mean, we -- you know, I -- I was a hands on\nmom, very differently, without -- without the staff, you know. So there is a difference, I\nthink. The dress code does make a difference, too. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to say, you\nknow, you sort of have to -- you\u2019d have to ask Lisa, you know, her perception. My\nperception was, I mean I -- I loved -- she was a wonderful child, the -- I never had any\nproblems with her, you know, any difficulties. I guess, you know, she probably will agree\nthat she was probably the model child, she always rubs that in, that I didn\u2019t give her -- she\ndidn\u2019t give me any aggrava -- she really didn\u2019t give me any aggravation.",

        "A: Well, I was brought up that way. I wa -- It was important to my parents, and -- well,\nthere was not a question of was I or was I not going to college, it was a given to begin\nwith, and I would have liked to go out of town, but we were still fairly new at it, and my\nparents said that college is something that you go to to learn, not to go to some campus,\nand whatever. And it was costly then, too. And Hunter was a very fine school, it was\navailable, and didn\u2019t cost anything. That was probably a big disappointment, because a\nlot of my friends were going, you know, out of town. I had a lot of private school friends\nby that time, because of camp, and -- and Sunday school. And everybody was going to\nthese nice schools, and stuff, so I had dates, and was invited to football games, and stuff\nlike that, so that was good. And my father said that he doesn\u2019t care what I graduate with,\nbut I have to have a tool, that if something happens, and I have to take care of myself,\nthat I have to be able to do that, which was sort of a very smart thing, because my\nmother\u2019s generation were raised to be ladies, and entertain. They learned, most of them,\nsome had more trouble than others. But my father said that he didn\u2019t care what I did, as\nlong as when I get that degree, it enables me to do something. So, I majored in English, I\nminored in ed-education. I liked working with children, so --",
        "Q: What year did you graduate?",
        "A: I graduated the year we were -- we were married. No, I graduated the year after. We\nwere married in *55, graduated in *56. I -- I went to summer school, and I graduated six\nmonths before. I spent that whole summer -- we were married in August -- I spent that\nwhole summer getting this ridiculous amount of credits, and cramming stupid courses.\nAnd then I student taught the pers -- semester that we were married. And actually, I -- I\nhad a hard time getting a job, because they wanted to put me into the worst schools, and I\nreally -- I wouldn\u2019t have survived there. I ended up in the worst schools later, but -- so I\ngot a wonderful job. We lived in Murray Hill, and I got a kwi -- sort of a -- I don\u2019t even\nknow how I got it, but it was really nice, sort of a Girl Friday job in a wholesale drapery\nand bedspread manufacturing company on Fifth Avenue in the 30\u2019s. And I kind of ran the\noffice. I didn\u2019t have a clue what I was doing. My husband used to come up and help me\nfile, cause there were too many S\u2019s. So I used to file all the other letters, except the S\u2019s.\nAnd there were no computers, I was perfectly happy answering the telephone, you know,\nand I looked nice, and my boss borrowed my husband\u2019s tuxedo, and so you know, we just\nall kind of worked, and then I became pregnant, not that far after -- w-was also -- also\nwas very nice, cause it was in the neighborhood, and I used to run home, and\n[indecipherable]. And then after Lisa was born, when she was little, I used to get these\nmarket research jobs. I used to interview people on the street with a baby, and then -- and\nmy elevator man got me this nice lady who ended up working for us for 14 years, who\nused to come in to clean twice a week. And when she came, I left, and -- for about three\nhours, at nap time. And she was wonderful, and I used to do these market research things,\nso I kind of liked that. And then we moved up here f -- in order for Lisa to go to PS six,\nwhich was a very good public school, and those were the rent control days, and got a rent\ncontrolled apartment, and I started looking around in schools, and I went -- I taught at a\nschool on 108\" and Madison Avenue. Kind of lower Harlem, I guess, whatever you call\nit, and I stayed there for many years.",

        "A: Yeah, I think -- I don\u2019t think it was looking good, I think it\u2019s a question of -- ifa\nbutton\u2019s missing, there\u2019s no reason not to sew it on. If something is torn, sew it. Comb\nyour hair in the morning, you know, those kind of things. So it\u2019s really neatness, and a\ncertain appearance, you know. I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s more that than, you know,\nclothes stuff. I don\u2019t know.",

        "A: What am I wearing? Oh. I bought these loafers, and they told me would go with\neverything, doesn\u2019t go with anything, but they\u2019re so comfortable. It\u2019s a weird color.",
        "Q: For the tape you want to describe them so the transcriber --",
        "A: Yeah, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re kind of funny looking suede loafers. I don\u2019t know what --\nwhat color would you call these? It\u2019s supposed to be -- it\u2019s not beige, but it\u2019s almost\nbordering on a dull orange kind of thing. And when I bought them, I thought they would\nbe sort of like -- go with everything. Every time I put them on, I think to myself, doesn\u2019t\nreally go with anything. But they\u2019re very comfortable.",
        "Q: They look very nice.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: When did you start collecting art?",
        "A: Way before I could afford it. When I was quite young, I must have been in my 30\u2019s,\nand we co-couldn\u2019t really afford it, and a lot of my friends were starting to buy mink\nstoles, and whatever those awful things were. And some jewelry, you know, and things.\nThe next level of -- you know, when your husband does well, that next level of luxury.\nAnd I\u2019ve always loved going to museums and galleries. And I was involved with\nBrandeis University National Women\u2019s Committee. And the National Women\u2019s\nCommittee was the sole supporter of the library, because it was a fairly new school, and\nthey didn\u2019t have the alumni money coming in for a library, so the women, when the\nschool was first formed, non-sectarian Jewish school, because education was very\nimportant, we supported the library. We had a very active chapter -- junior chapter in\nNew York, young. There was an older -- our parent\u2019s generation, they formed a younger\nchapter, and I was very much involved with that. And we did a lot of book reviews, and\nart classes, and I guess intellectually stimulating things, as opposed to a lot of other\npeople were playing -- younger people, that had some free time were starting to play Mah\nJongg, or Canasta, and all that kind of stuff, so this was -- we had a stock group, we were\nlearning about that, so whatever was interesting, and I was always interested in that. We\nwent to look at the Barnes collection. And there were a lot of artists popping up that were\ncontemporary, unknown. Galleries that were appearing in Soho, that were new. Andy\nWarhol was becoming, O.K Harris Gallery was -- he used to give ladies art classes,\nbefore he opened the gallery. And they would donate stuff, and we would auction it off,\nor sell it, or whatever. And I was just really interested. Some of the galleries would give\nus cocktail parties, and fundraisers, and stuff, and that\u2019s how that Picasso lino cut back\nthere, it was the first thing that I bought, that was an independent thing, and it was a lot of\nmoney at the time. And we did it.",
        "Q: You and your --",
        "A: My husband, my fir --",
        "Q: -- first husband?",
        "A: First husband, yeah. And then a lot of the little things that you see around like that\nNevillson, and multiple -- they were all multiples, and somebody asked me the other day\nwhat a multiple is. I said it\u2019s a sa -- it\u2019s like -- 1t\u2019s like a lithograph, except in sculptures,\nand I was -- such a funny question. But a lot of artists did that in order to raise money.\nLouise Nevillson was very supportive of Brandeis, and some museums were. And that\nwas a very -- a less expensive way of acquiring things, because they were multiples, they\nwere one of 50, one of a hundred, whatever. And they certainly have, you know, done\nwell along the years. So I\u2019m happy. I mean, I didn\u2019t buy it at the time, because I thought\nit was going to wor -- be worth it, cause I\u2019m not selling anything. But I just liked it. And\nit was all -- always -- I kind of like a little bit of the cutting edge stuff, although every\nonce in awhile -- I went to see the new exhibit at the Metropolitan, I said, you know, I\ncould get rid of some of this, acquire one of those, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s just -- gives me\npleasure, I -- I just like it. We have some stuff really, and actually it\u2019s in the closets, that\nare very angry, and -- stuff I wouldn\u2019t want to hang. Nan Golden, do you know Nan\nGolden? We have a cookie portfolio, I mean, it\u2019s not something I would hang, but I really\nlike it, I think they\u2019re wonderful photographs, and they\u2019re very meaningful, I mean, that\u2019s\nthe generation of the drugs, and the OD\u2019s and stuff. I absolutely can\u2019t think of the young\nman who did that. I thought it was -- the paintings were just spectacular. I absolu -- I\u2019m\nblanking out on his name, he\u2019s Italian. But I thought they were all AIDS victims, turned\nout he had a brain tumor, and he\u2019s alive and well, but they all look -- they really all look\nlike concentration camp survivors. So -- But of all the things to spend money on, in the\nluxury category, I think art would be my -- top of my list.",
        "Q: Were your parents collectors?",
        "A: Not really. Y -- I mean, in Europe they had a wonderful -- I remember lots of\npaintings, and they were supposed to have been good paintings, but they never came out,\nand I have -- I don\u2019t really even know who they were, or how valuable they were. That\nwas not something they continued to do. They have a couple of Hungarian painters, that\nwere very well known in the Hungarian circles. Freid -- I don\u2019t know if you ever heard of\n-- kind of impressionists, faux impressionists, but they were, you know, very good\nfriends, and actually I tried to talk my mother once, to buy a Chagall lithograph, and I\nthink she was sorry she didn\u2019t. But no, not here.",
        "Q: Well you have so-some really interesting pieces. And you\u2019re not afraid of collecting\nGerman artists.",
        "A: That\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s interesting, that was the only one that\u2019s definitely German, and I\nhad mixed feelings about it. And the other -- the one that they\u2019re really famous for, the\nwater tanks, that\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s fu -- a very good friend of mine, who I went to a college\nwith, are major collectors, I mean really major, and she\u2019s also an art dealer, and I\u2019ve gone\nwith her a few times, and bought things, you know, through her and with her, and I think\nsomebody had bought this, and they couldn\u2019t pay the last payment, or something, and she\n-- she said, you know, if I don\u2019t buy this, I\u2019m crazy, and it was really a good buy. And I\nliked it, and I -- I don\u2019t even think I was paying attention to the German part, to tell you\nthe truth. If I had, I probably wouldn\u2019t have bought it.",
        "Q: You want to explain for the tape, what we\u2019re talking about?",
        "A: Yeah, this 1s a series of nine photographs taken -- what these -- it\u2019s a husband and\nwife, Bescher. I can\u2019t think of their first name, Hannah, and -- I can\u2019t think of his name,\nBescher, but they\u2019re probably one of the most predominant photographers, and they take\nmultiple shots of the same thing. They\u2019re very well known for their water tanks, and\nthese are houses in Germany, and it\u2019s -- they\u2019re no -- I mean, they\u2019re sold as a unit. There\nare nine, aren\u2019t there?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And they\u2019re kind of hung as a series.",

        "Q: -- and I\u2019m sitting here looking at those.",
        "A: Yeah, 1-1-it\u2019s funny, you\u2019re absolutely right, yeah.",
        "Q: But then, most people wouldn\u2019t know that.",
        "A: Yeah. No, but it\u2019s not because most people, I mean, like the bag I didn\u2019t buy, I didn\u2019t\nbuy not because anybody would have known it, but I mean, I have turned like dishes or\nthings upside down to look, so I don\u2019t know how this kind of major thing snuck in, but it\ncertainly did.",
        "Q: When you were married both times, were they religious ceremonies?",
        "A: Yes, both times. I\u2019ve been married by a rabbi, does that mean -- yeah. First time it was\nat the hotel, the Hampshire House, by a rabbi, actually a Hungarian rabbi, who had come\nhere after the war, and had his congregation in New Haven. And he used to tutor my\nmother and her brother, to earn extra money, to go through school. And the second time\nwe were married at Temple Emmanuel, in the study, of my rabbi, and my husband\u2019s\nrabbi, who happened to have been classmates, so they were good friends, and it just\nworked out well.",
        "Q: This was 1m-important to you, to be married by a rabbi?",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s another one of those things I just didn\u2019t think about. I mean, I -- I don\u2019t\nknow, it just -- I didn\u2019t even think about who else could marry you, like a Justice of the\nPeace, I -- yeah, I don\u2019t know. I mean, if I answered you, 1t wouldn\u2019t really be -- I just\ndidn\u2019t think about it.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve talked -- Several times you\u2019ve mentioned the Hidden Children gathering.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: It sounds like that was kind of a focal point for you, kind of coming out as a survivor?",
        "A: Yes, yeah. Somebody said that, it\u2019s like coming out of the closet. I think what\nhappened, and I don\u2019t know how accurate this 1s, but I think the period of assimilation\nhad passed. I assimilated, I grew up, I was an American teenager, I was married, you\nknow. It is now at the point in time, where with my generation, it\u2019s all over, except these\ntapes. I didn\u2019t think about that 20 or 30 years ago. I wanted to go on with my life, and my\nparents wanted to go on with their lives. I mean, we were all very happy to be here, and\nstill today, when people criticize this country, my European side comes out, and I always\nwant to say, go away. If you don\u2019t like it here, go wherever it\u2019s better. Cause with all the\nproblems here, with all the horrible things, what -- whether it\u2019s -- from the politicians and\nthe -- the crookedness, and th -- all that, I\u2019d still rather live here than anywhere else. And\nwe had a choice, and I get very annoyed with Americans that are critical. And I don\u2019t like\nthe American flag being burned, I don\u2019t like this freedom of choice business. I don\u2019t\nmean the abortion issue, I mean freedom of choice of doing things that I -- I don\u2019t think\nthe right thing to do, because I don\u2019t think you have to burn anything to make a\nstatement, but that\u2019s my own opinion. But I am very conscious of the fact that\nhistorically, I wouldn\u2019t like it not to be remembered. Not me, because I\u2019ve been very\nlucky. Even through the war I was lucky, I survived with my parents. A tremen -- All of\nmy aunts, and uncles, and cousins were killed in Auschwitz. I have one cousin, who\u2019s 77,\nwho\u2019s here, who has got his Auschwitz numbers on his arm. He\u2019s married, he has a son, a\nnice Jewish doctor, and has two nice Jewish grandchildren. And he\u2019s assimilated, totally,\nsometimes excessively, and it\u2019s really interesting, cause I asked him to donate his\nAuschwitz uniform, and he said he wasn\u2019t ready to part with it. On the other hand, he\nlived next door to some people who had a swastika hanging 1n their house. So -- And he\nalso went overboard joining -- I probably shouldn\u2019t say this on tape, case he listens to it --\na very non-Jewish club, who now has been kind enough to admit some Jews, but I\nwouldn\u2019t deal too well with that, if I\u2019m not welcome, it\u2019s okay. I mean, it\u2019s not okay, but\nI wouldn\u2019t want to make a statement. But that\u2019s how he\u2019s dealt with it. He\u2019s got his own\ndemons, probably much worse than mine, cause his mother died in Auschwitz. So, you\ncan\u2019t really be critical of what other people, you know, do, and how people deal with it.\nBut I think -- Well first of all, this Hidden Children thing just happened, so --",
        "Q: Yeah, when was that?",
        "A: I guess about five years ago, and there was an article in a New York magazine, and it\nwas getting a lot of publicity, it was going to be like maybe a couple of hundred people or\nsomething, were going to gather at the Marriott Marquis Hotel, and my daughter called\nme and told me about it. And she said, how come I\u2019m not going? I said, \u201cWell, I really\nhadn\u2019t thought about it, what am I going to do there?\u201d And it was Memorial Day\nweekend, and we were invited out to the Hamptons, which sounded like a much better\nthing to do. Then the more I read about it, and the more I thought about it, I said, you\nknow, I think I\u2019m going to go. And I said to my husband, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to the Hamptons,\nand I\u2019Il come back for the one day out of the two, and you stay, and that\u2019s that.\u201d Well, he\ncame back with me, and I only went for one day. And I went early in the morning, and by\nlunchtime I called him, and I said, \u201cCome. Elie Wiesel is speaking in the evening,\u201d and\nyou know, and he did. And it was really a very interesting experience for me. And one of\nmy friends who, at that first meeting, said I was like the Pollyanna of the group, saying\nthe war was wonderful, and I had a lovely childho -- and all of a sudden, you know, some\nthings that weren\u2019t so wonderful came out somewhere along the way, which I wasn\u2019t\neven aware of. So I guess, you know, something is definitely there, and I -- I don\u2019t know\nif it\u2019s my personality or what, that likes to think the glass is half full, as opposed to half\nempty. But it is definitely important that the museum is there. We went to the one in\nSouth Beach, which is really a wonderful -- a-and then, you know, sometimes, people\nhave said an awful lot of money is going to all these buildings, and all of this stuff, you\nknow, isn\u2019t there better ways of spending the money, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure. But I\nthink the only way to possibly avoid it, or to teach children in this crazy world, when you\nhear about all these shootings at schools, and stuff, it\u2019s a nightmare. But I\u2019m not sure that\nit\u2019s -- goes to the right people. You know, it\u2019s -- I remember years ago, having meetings,\nand chairing a meeting, and giving a lecture to the people that are there, about not being\nlate. But the people that were there, were there. The people that were that late, didn\u2019t hear\nmy complaining, so I\u2019m not sure that the people who are going to do terrible things, are\ngoing to go to the Holocaust Museum, listen to these tapes, and say, \u201cWell, you know, we\ndid terrible things to these people, maybe we won\u2019t do this.\u201d So, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Change tape aga --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape three, side A, Holocaust Museum interview with Eva Cooper, on Tuesday,\nJune 22\", 1999. Did you always talk to your daughter about your experiences?",
        "A: She claims I didn\u2019t in the beginning, and it\u2019s really interesting, cause that\u2019s something\nthat\u2019s come up a lot at these Hidden Children meetings, about some daughters who said\ntheir parents talked too much, and other daughters who said their parents didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t\nfor a long time, and she teases me about it. I had all these pictures, after the war, that\nwere taken, and I don\u2019t know why, but it was just sort of something that came up from\ntime to time, and I always told her that when she was older, I would show it to her. There\nwere all these dead bodies, all over the place, that were being shoveled up to be buried 1-\nin the back of the synagogue, cause they couldn\u2019t be identified, and -- and there were just\na lot of bodies all over the place that -- when we came back into Budapest, cause we were\nin hiding outside, and so I remember all these bodies and stuff, and shortly after we came\nback, they were hanging people. And you know, this -- these were all documented, and\nno, I didn\u2019t want to show her the pictures, for a long time. I\u2019m not sure whether they were\nupsetting for me, or whether I thought that she\u2019d be upset. I don\u2019t know. I did take her to\na couple of movies, when she was like a young teenager, that were, I guess I thought age\nappropriate, and that she could handle. And it\u2019s interesting, because my -- I\u2019ve changed.\nYou know, now I feel if the people that were victims could handle it, you know, children\nshould be able to handle it, too. I certainly started younger with my grandson. I don\u2019t --\nyou know, I don\u2019t know. I guess timing. With my grandson, I was at the train station,\nwaiting for somebody, and he put out his right hand like Heil, Hitler, and it really freaked\nme out, totally. And so -- I mean, he was little, maybe four, five years old. So I kind of\nkneeled -- you know, bent down, at his level, I said, \u201cAdam, why did you do that?\u201d And\nhe said, \u201cWell, I just had seen that in \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, yeah,\nthat\u2019s what they did,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I have to tell you a story.\u201d And I said, \u201cIf you\nremember the story, some of those soldiers were the bad guys. And this was this guy,\nAdolf,\u201d anyhow, and I said, you know, \u201cI don\u2019t really want you to do that, that\u2019s not a\nsalute that 1s appropriate.\u201d I don\u2019t know what words I used, I was really kind of emotional\nabout it. So then he said, \u201cWill you tell me other stories about what happened to you?\u201d\nAnd I did, and actually at the Hidden Children, there was some wonderful books, and I\nhad gotten some. And I read some to him, and then, subsequently he, you know, read\n\u201cAnne Frank\u201d and all the other Holocaust related stories. But now, it\u2019s become like a\njoke, every time I give him a book, I say, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not about the Holocaust.\u201d",
        "Q: And what\u2019s your relationship to Israel?",
        "A: That\u2019s an interesting question. I\u2019m very glad it\u2019s there. I wouldn\u2019t want to live there,\nand it has nothing -- it has -- I was going to say it has nothing to do with me, but that\u2019s\nnot quite right, that\u2019s a flip answer. I\u2019m not as committed to it being my homeland as\nsome people. I think we\u2019re very lucky, as American Jews, that Israel is there, it\u2019s -- to\nlean on. But it\u2019s not a place I want to live in. I don\u2019t feel that because I\u2019m Jewish, I have\nto be there. It\u2019s not a place, certainly, my parents chose, like a lot of people after the war,\nthat -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think of it in terms of my homeland. Maybe I should. Maybe\nthat\u2019s where all the Jews belong, I don\u2019t know. I mean, we were perfectly happy being\nHungarian Jews. Did you ever see a movie called, \u201cShip of Fools\u2019? He said, \u201cAfter all,\nI\u2019m a German.\u201d Well, right now I\u2019m saying, \u201cAfter all, \u2019'm an American.\u201d Could it\nhappen here? Probably. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Do you feel at this point, that it\u2019s important to talk about your experiences?",
        "A: To talk about --",
        "Q: Your experiences. Do you tend to tell people more now than you did before the\nHidden Children conference?",
        "A: It\u2019s -- It\u2019s strange, I have had friends for 40 some years, they all knew that I was born\nin Europe. They all knew that I came, when I came, and all that. And I cannot tell you\nhow many -- and I mean, this is my -- a handful of people that I\u2019ve known, you know,\nfrom camp, junior high school, says, \u201cBy the way, I knew you came from Europe, were\nyou,\u201d -- I said, \u201cYou know, where have you been all of this time?\u201d \u201cWell, you never\ntalked about it.\u201d I said, \u201cYou never asked me.\u201d I mean, I don\u2019t go sit down at a dinner\nparty, and say, \u201cWould you like to hear my war stories?\u201d Some people do that, but I\ndon\u2019t. I -- I don\u2019t do it or not do it, I mean, if you ask me. People will say, \u201cDo you mind\ntalking about it?\u201d No, I don\u2019t mind talking about it at all. But some people will ask, and\nthen I have a sense that they\u2019re trying to change the subject. They don\u2019t really want to\nknow. And some people are curious, so --",
        "Q: How about with your husbands, did you talk about it with them?",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Did they want to know, or did you want to tell them?",
        "A: Both. Yeah, but I mean I\u2019m -- you know, I can\u2019t honestly say we sat down and had,\nyou know -- yeah, but I mean, as -- as much as you can talk about it, or you know. I\nmean, my husband -- my present husband --",
        "Q: What\u2019s his name?",
        "A: Leslie, which really, interesting enough, is a very European name, it\u2019s Lazlo. And my\nuncle, my mother\u2019s brother, was Leslie -- was Lazlo there. His son -- which 1s a very un-\nJewish thing to do, is an only child also, 1s Leslie junior. And at the time my daughter had\na very good female friend whose name was Leslie, so we\u2019re loaded with Leslies. But, I\nmean, it was with him that we, you know, gave a very nice contribution, and -- he gets\nvery emotional about hearing or seeing things about the Holocaust. So --",
        "Q: Is your daughter named after anyone?",
        "A: My grandmother. I mean, it was sort of a -- you know, make believe after, but I mean,\nwe just liked the name Lisa, and her middle name is Robin, which was sort of -- my\ngrandmother\u2019s name was Serena, so I\u2019m not exactly sure how we did all that, but it\u2019s\nreally weird, because my father -- I was pregnant with Lisa when my father died, so if\nanything, I probably should have -- I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know -- I mean, I don\u2019t know why.\nI think we just named her Lisa right away, before she was born, so it just --",
        "Q: Do you have any fears now that stem from you childhood experiences?",
        "A: I have probably more fears now than I did before, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to do\nwith my childhood, I think it\u2019s the process of aging, you know, there\u2019s a lot of sickness,\nand illness, and you know.",
        "Q: What about sirens?",
        "A: Oh, I hate sirens. I don\u2019t like sirens, but I\u2019m not as -- I mean, I used to really be bad\nabout it, but I just -- you know, I just don\u2019t like the noise. I\u2019m not a noisy person, I don\u2019t\nlike noise.",
        "Q: It\u2019s not that it reminds you of --",
        "A: It did for a long time, and cor -- yeah -- no, it really doesn\u2019t.",
        "Q: How about being cold?",
        "A: Oh yes. I -- My -- All my fingers were frozen during the war, and I still -- talk about\ngloves, not white gloves during the summer, but I -- I\u2019d rather wear gloves than anything\nelse in the winter, because my hands and feet tend to get very cold, and that always is\nfrom that original freezing thing, and I don\u2019t like to be cold. Course, I don\u2019t like to be\nvery hot, either, so --",
        "Q: [inaudible] Photographs you have on the piano.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve got the Bushes in front of everybody else.",
        "A: I -- That\u2019s -- That\u2019s just a -- a coincident, it\u2019s really funny, because I\u2019m not a\nRepublican, but when we were in Washington with Adam and Peter -- this was a cut out,\nand when we went back, we were trying to find a Clinton cut out, but we couldn\u2019t find it.\nBut it looks so realistic that people actually have come and said, \u201cWhat are you doing\nwith the Bushes?\u201d And I say it was just, you know, the kids got a kick out of it, and it\u2019s\namazing how real it is. There\u2019s one picture on the piano, it\u2019s right up front, near the\nBushes. That\u2019s my mother, my father, my Uncle Leslie and me as a baby. Do you see it?\nYeah, that old fashioned one, yeah. And that was in Europe in our living room. Yeah, that\nwas my Uncle Leslie, who came here in \u201941, and he was 20 something, and immediately\njoined the American army, and was in Italy during the invasion, and then came to\nBudapest before he headed back. And it\u2019s his wife -- well, he died, my uncle died about\nfive years ago, that was my mother\u2019s brother. And his wife 1s the one I\u2019m very friendly\nwith.",
        "Q: Do you play piano?",
        "A: No, I did. That\u2019s another thing I did when I used to be smart. I -- I\u2019ve thought about\nactually taking lessons again. But we just had two couples over for dinner the other night,\nand we played the piano, it was just wonderful. My grandchildren play the piano. And\nwhen we got the apartment -- a very good friend of mine sold us the apartment, and she\nsaid, \u201cThis living room is so big, what are you going to do?\u201d I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t got a\nclue,\u201d cause I had all this furniture from my other apartment that I used, and she, being a\ngood real estate lady says, you know, she was just selling an apartment, a woman who\nwas moving out of a big apartment, she wants to sell her piano. That\u2019s how I got the\npiano, so I could put my grandchildren\u2019s pictures on it.",

        "A: Mm. I think I would like to go, at some point. I\u2019ve never been to Prague, which is not\nthe same thing, but a lot of it has to do -- well, choices, and timing, because -- but the last\n-- when we were in Budapest the last time, we went with Adam, and I didn\u2019t want to go\nto another eastern European country, which is -- I was in -- like in the neighborhood. And\nthen there have been a couple of, you know, Jewish congress, and UJA kind of stuff, that\nalways has that. And I think I\u2019ve mixed feelings about it. I don\u2019t know how I feel about\nit.",
        "Q: You said that there were a lot of emotions when you went with Adam to Budapest.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Then you just left it at that. What kind of emotions?",
        "A: I felt very -- combination of this 1s where I\u2019m from, to this is a strange place, all at the\nsame time. Because again, we\u2019re talking 50 some years ago, so just like New York, on\nthe west side where I grew up, doesn\u2019t look anything like -- Lincoln Center wasn\u2019t\nanywhere near anything, you know, so I mean, just by nature of growth, and -- things\nchange. My apartment looked pretty shabby from the outside. There was still a lot of\nbullet -- you know, bomb sh-shrapnel things in the buildings. The city is beautiful, and\nwhen we were looking out the window at night, we had a -- we stayed at the\nintercontinental, overlooking the Danube River, it\u2019s a beautiful, beautiful city, and it used\nto be called the Paris of the Danube. And all the royalty used to visit, and these shopping\nstreets, like Madison Avenue, 1s -- was a beautiful, beautiful street. It\u2019s pretty crummy\nnow. Has a lot of is -- American chain store, McDonalds, you know, and all that kind of\nstuff. It\u2019s -- The city\u2019s a little tacky, and sad looking, you know, but it\u2019s -- physically it\u2019s\na beautiful city. I was very moved at the synagogue. The last time we were there, 20\nsome years ago, you -- it wasn\u2019t even opened. So that is changed a lot. And there a lot of\nAmericans, including Tony Curtis, and the Louder family, who have given a lot of money\nto restore the synagogue. And they\u2019ve re -- all the furniture has been re-done, you know,\nall the benches, and pews. And all the names were taken off, in order to re-polish the\nfurniture. So I spoke to the guy who was sort of escorting school groups around. And I\nsaid, \u201cMy grandfather, and my father, and my uncle, and mother, they all had their\nnametags -- you know, their nameplates here.\u201d So he said, \u201cGive me their names.\u201d And\nhe said, \u201c\u201cCome to the back,\u201d there\u2019s a little room in the back. And in old shoeboxes, in\nalphabetical order, he pulls out my grandfather\u2019s, my father\u2019s, my mother\u2019s, and my\nuncle. That\u2019s whose son is here, as a survivor of Auschwitz. So I made a donation to the\nsynagogue, and they put them on like little wooden plaques -- wooden pieces, they didn\u2019t\ndo such a good job, but it was very nice of them to do that. And I brought it home, and I\ngave my mother\u2019s, my father\u2019s, my gr-grandfather\u2019s to my mother, and I gave my uncle\u2019s\nto my cousin. We did have a choice of putting it back there. I\u2019m not sure why I bought\nthem with me. They were selling, you know, new people now, raising money for the\nsynagogue. I don\u2019t know why, I just wa -- I ge -- I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019m not sure\nwhether I shouldn\u2019t have just had them put it back, you know, on the -- on the pews, or\nwhat they had planned to do. But when they had them in the back, and they said, \u201cWould\nyou like them?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I would.\u201d So that was quite moving, and Adam was quite\nimpressed, moved, whatever. And we bought some Judaica there. So --",

I just thought she would like\nto have them, cause she was -- has all this stuff. And my cousin actually goes back to\nvisit. All those last living relatives just died, and Europeans are very big on cemeteries, so\nthey always go visit cemeteries. I don\u2019t know why I brought it back. I really -- I mean, it\nwasn\u2019t something I thought about doing or going to get, or anything else, it was just -- I\nexpected to see them on the s -- on the pews, and my mother sat upstairs. That\u2019s --",
        "Q: Anything else you want to say about your experience?",
        "A: About what?",
        "Q: About your experience [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s sort of interesting, and it\u2019s a contradiction. Had it not been for\nthe Hidden Children, had it not been for the fact that I\u2019m conscious of this last generation,\nand probably my grandchildren, it would have been something of the past. But the past is\na very important part of your whole being, and you can\u2019t just totally file it away. What\nimpact it will have on the future, I no -- I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m going through a stage, I\ndon\u2019t know if because it\u2019s my mother, that I feel very vulnerable about it being sort of the\nlast chapter, you know. I used to think I was young, and I used to think I was middle-\naged, and now I think, you know, the senior, and AARP, and all that, it\u2019s like a whole\nother chapter, and I\u2019ve never lied about my age, so it\u2019s not a matter of saying I\u2019m\nyounger than I am, but I think I have a little problem acknowledging that I\u2019m not in my\n40\u2019s, I think I\u2019m stuck in my 40\u2019s. But I\u2019ve had the discussion with my daughter, and she\nsays she\u2019s stuck in her 20\u2019s, so that kind of works, cause she\u2019s having a problem thinking\nthat she\u2019s in her 40\u2019s. And she\u2019s got exactly the same lines that I have. And I guess that\u2019s\ngenetic, you know? So, I just would like to think -- not even wish, I don\u2019t know, think\nthat the next generation doesn\u2019t have any of this to deal with. I think historically, almost\nevery generation has had a horrendous war, or something that\u2019s beyond their control.\nWhether it was a civil war movement, or World War One, or Two, or lost someone in\nKorea, Vietnam. This was a little different, and my daughter, my grandchildren are quite\ninvolved in this Kosovo, which I probably think is as close as you can get. And it-it\u2019s so\nsad that with all of the talk, and the political statements, that the bottom line is, there\u2019s\nnothing anybody can do, it\u2019s like a -- it\u2019s like a chain reaction. I mean, thousands of\npeople are dying. And with all the stuff that\u2019s going there, it\u2019s still going on, and nobody\ncan stop it. So, it\u2019s hard to be philosophical, because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s sort of -- it\u2019s empty words,\nyou know. This is what happened. I would like it not to happen. That\u2019s not very\nprofound, but I can\u2019t think of anything more. I\u2019ve been lucky, that\u2019s -- I guess that\u2019s a\ngood way to end, because I think I been lucky because in my life, the war could have\nbeen much worse. I had -- could have had more serious losses. I could have been in\ncamps, which were more serious. And I\u2019m also lucky that my life after the war turned out\nto be a nice, and a good life. And I\u2019m very grateful for that.",

And -- I mean in -- in the Yorkville section of -- of New York, you\ncan see the Hungarian Catholics, and the Hungarian Jews, and the Hungarian Protestants.\nAnd -- And the people that became friendly with each other were the people that were of\nthe same class in Europe, and never the twain shall meet. In Hungarian, there are three --\noh God, I really am losing it now. It\u2019s not the -- like in France, there\u2019s -- do you speak\nFrench?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Tu, and vous?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: What do you call that?",
        "Q: Formal, informal.",
        "A: Formal, informal. In Hungarian there\u2019s a third one. It gets very complicated. The\ninformal would be like, to very good friends or children. The formal would be to\nteachers, and parents, and all of that. Then there\u2019s a third one that you would speak to --\nwith lower class or upper class. I mean, I can\u2019t describe it to you, but like a housekeeper\nwould use a different way of speaking to, than -- and so -- and that still exists, and it\u2019s\nvery interesting, because people will remain in that category of behavior, and it\u2019s not that\n-- anything that\u2019s expected or -- or anything 1n today\u2019s world, but it still exists. And my\nparents, and a lot of their friends, that -- some people they met here, some people they\nknew from Europe, they came here -- they came here maybe with a little bit of money\nbecause they had visas where there was visitors, or perman -- mostly visitors, and then\nthey applied for a permanent, and eventually became citizens. But 80 or 90 percent of my\nmother\u2019s friends became majorly, majorly successful. Speaking with accents, not\nspeaking very good English, and a lot of them became import, export business, in the toy\nbuilding, and the gift building. Some attorneys went back to school. There was a\nHungarian Jewish doctor\u2019s association. Not Hungarian Catholic, Hungarian Jewish. And\nI\u2019m sure there was another one also. But they were very class conscious on every -- on\nevery level. And then the next group of people that came, it was 1956, and that was\nreferred to as the 1956, as those people really came with just the clothes on their back,\nbecause they were escaping after the revolution. And even some of those people have\ndone extremely well. So, especially the Jews that came to this country, the educated Jews,\nhad a tremendous thirst for success again, and most of -- a businessman is a businessman,\nif he can sell that, he can sell this. And that\u2019s exactly what -- what happened. I mean,\nhistorically, even in -- even in government, I mean, there\u2019s some Hungarians, and for a\nlittle country, that\u2019s amazing, to be prominent people on Wall Street, and in business, and\npolitics, that have come out of it, so --",
        "Q: So it was essentially upper class?",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "Q: Your family was essentially upper class?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you consider yourself a classist now?",
        "A: No. But on the other hand, I\u2019m not poor, you know. I -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s a different world\ntoday, so it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- I was much more aware of it there than I am here. I have friends\nthat are -- have much more than I, and I have friends that have much less. But I think --\nand this is probably true everywhere, I mean, people seem to put you in -- into a box,\nbecause of where you live, the car you drive, whatever it is you do, you know? So it\u2019s\nsort of hard to get away from it. Do I pick people? No, that way, because of class. But the\nbehavior of the European class system is very different than it is here. And it probably --\nmaybe not so much now, but I think it probably still exists a little bit.",
        "Q: In your head, when you meet somebody, do you -- do you go through which form of\nlanguage you should use?",
        "A: No, no. I only speak English.",
        "Q: But I mean, do you do a kind of mental shift?",
        "A: No, no. No, that I definitely don\u2019t do.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] that is you -- you work at the Whitney now?",
        "A: Yes. I work there as a volunteer.",
        "Q: What do you do?",
        "A: Yeah, just as a mem -- membership, I try to get people to join. I --",
        "Q: You sit at the desk and [indecipherable]",
        "A: We sit at the desk, yeah, and tell people where to go, have dinner, where to park their\ncar, where the Guggenheim is, how to take the subway, you know. And just schmooze\nwith them, and hope to sell a -- a membership. The difference w -- I was just thinking\nwhat you said about class, the big difference is, in Europe, where they came from, and\ntheir breeding from before is of equal importance. Here, that\u2019s not the case. I -- Maybe to\nsome people, but you meet people usually on an equal footing, and whether they came\nfrom a poor background or a rich background is -- doesn\u2019t become an issue 1n the\nfriendship, where as it does in Europe. I think probably where you came from is more\nimportant than how much money you have. I think -- maybe this is my generalization, but\nI think here, money is more important. I think in Europe, at least I had that sense, that\nyour background, or your education was more important than -- money couldn\u2019t buy you\ninto places in Europe. It can here. That\u2019s -- So there\u2019s a different, I mean, it\u2019s probably\nthe same thing, but they come from a different approach.",
        "Q: Do you have both?",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "Q: Do you have both?",
        "A: Yeah, I mean, I'd like -- I don\u2019t like to think I think about it either way, but it exists,\nbecause it\u2019s -- I was just telling somebody the other day that it\u2019s amazing how if you\nmeet somebody, and they go to an Ivy League school -- I mean, we\u2019re talking people in\ntheir 50\u2019s, 60\u2019s, and 70\u2019s, how, before the end of the evening, somehow or other, they\nwill mention having gone to Harvard or Princeton. And, you know, that was a while\nback. They don\u2019t mention city college. So, it still is important to whoever it\u2019s important\nto.",
        "Q: How long have you been volunteering at the Whitney?",
        "A: Oh, over 10 years.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. Actually probably mo -- a little more.",
        "Q: Volunteering -- the idea that you\u2019re volunteering important? That notion, that you\u2019re\ngiving something?",
        "A: Yes, definitely. I think actually I -- I should be doing more than I am right now. I used\nto do much more, but I didn\u2019t mention, but we spend our winter in the Caribbean, and so\nwe -- we\u2019re away so much, that every time I sort of get involved, I don\u2019t like to volunteer,\nand not take that as seriously as if I had a paying job, so I don\u2019t like to pop in and pop\nout. So, when I started this, it was with the understanding that I can my slot back, and I\ncan be replaced for the three months. But then, I do take it very seriously. Cause we\u2019re\naway during the summer, and I come in for my spot every week. But I think it\u2019s -- giving\nback is -- is important.",
        "Q: Where do you go in the summer?",
        "A: Connecticut.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] where in the Caribbean do you go in winter?",
        "A: Saint Thomas. But that\u2019s really -- I mean, it sounds pretty good, and it\u2019s not bad, but\nmy husband\u2019s business is in Saint Thomas. He used to live there full time, we used to live\nthere full time for awhile. So when we\u2019re there, he has an office, and -- and most of his\nbusiness is in the Caribbean.

        "A: Yes, I am, for the third and last time, with my grandchildren.",
        "A: No, I certainly did not. But I think that\u2019s probably true of a non-Holocaust person, too,\nthat you don\u2019t really think what you\u2019re going to do as an adult, or even the fact that\nyou\u2019re going to be grandparents. I mean, that\u2019s very old people, and it\u2019s very hard to\nthink about. But I spent a lot of wonderful years, when I was in Budapest with my father,\ngoing to, not Disneyland, but to playgrounds, and theme parks, in a very small way, that -\n- with roller coasters, and all that kind of stuff, so I have very fond memories of that.",
        "A: Well, 1 -- when you say important, yes it certainly 1s, I\u2019d rather have a good time than\na bad time, you know. Important, I think at this point, health, and having my family\nremain healthy, and around me, is more important, but yeah, having a good time certainly\nis important.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That always stayed with me. It\u2019s really strange, because I know we\u2019re going to talk\nabout the Hidden Children a little bit later, but the very first meeting I went to after our\nHungarian group was formed, we sort of introduced each other, and everybody gave a\nlittle blurb of -- of the -- the war years, and I kind of ended up, not meaningly, sounding\nlike a Pollyanna, because everybody was telling not just horror stories, but of how\nterribly it affected them afterwards. Everybody blamed their misfortune, divorces, and\neverything else on the Holocaust, and I\u2019ve -- not a matter of having gotten beyond it, but\nin many ways I have nice memories of certainly the -- the pre-war years, and my\nmemories of the Holocaust, with all the horror, and being terribly afraid of many things,\nit was also a nurturing time. I was very conscious of -- of my parents taking care of me,\nand protecting me. Of providing me with food when there wasn\u2019t any to be had. I was a\nvery finicky eater, it was a pain in the neck, you know, providing me with -- with\nanything I would eat. And during the time that we were hidden, I had a -- a boyfriend\nwho was a year older than I, so we were 10 and 11, and we had a wonderful time. So, I\nthink because my parents protected me, and made up majorly fictional, nonsensical thing\nin retrospect, but it helped me, I think, come out sort of a healthier person, without any of\nthe post-war trauma that a lot of my friends, who are my contemporaries, still have.",
        "A: Did you see the movie, \u201cLife is Beautiful\u2019? The Italian film that won all the awards?\nA lot of my friends thought the movie fictionalized, and trivialized the Holocaust, and I\nthink you would have had to see the movie to know what I\u2019m talking about, but it\u2019s --\nwhen you see the movie, knowing it\u2019s about the Holocaust -- when I first went to the\nmovies, for the first 20 minutes I thought I was 1n the wrong movie, because there was a\ncomedy. It was silly, it was Marcelle Marceau and Chaplin all put into one, before the\nHolocaust theme takes place. And it was basically about a father protecting his child. I\ndidn\u2019t think it was trivialized at all. I really related to it, because the whole process, in\nsome ways, my parents made up stories that I was able to accept. So I never had their\nfear, I always had their very positive attitude that my grandmother who had died in the\nUnited States, previous to the war, was a butterfly, and every time there was a butterfly\nflying around, it was my grandmother up there watching out for us. And to this day, you\nknow, butterflies are kind of a meaningful thing. And there was always a positive thing,\nthat things would be okay. So, I never had the fear that my parents had, but they wanted\nto be sure that I wouldn\u2019t, and I guess I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if that makes any sense.",
        "A: Right. That\u2019s absolutely true. That was probably the -- the only time that she spoke to\nme in very strong language, because I think somebody stopped us on the street, and asked\nus about our religion, and my mother said we were Catholic, and I kind of pulled at her,\nand disagreed, and aft-after that, my mother said that at any time, that our lives depended\non it, and it\u2019s very important that I not question anything she says, and if she says it\u2019s one\nthing, it\u2019s -- if it\u2019s -- yes, that\u2019s absolutely -- that\u2019s the truth, but -- no, no, I mean that --\nthat was -- and I think -- you know, I think the European children are sort of brought up\nthat way, so it wasn\u2019t quite as difficult for me to deal with. You know, your -- you speak\nwhen you\u2019re spoken to, and you don\u2019t question a lot, and I don\u2019t think today\u2019s generation\nwould get away with that.",
        "A: I think I -- well, the only other time, and it wasn\u2019t a ma -- even a matter of complying,\nbut she -- she stole an egg, and I think I did tell that story in my video, and I remember\nthat very clearly, cause everybody said where did you get the egg, and she said she ran\ninto a farmhouse, and chicken was laying an egg, and she took the egg because she made\nme a cake, and it needed an egg. A little yellow cake thing, and I -- I asked her about\nstealing, and I think she sort of -- gee, I don\u2019t remember all that well, but I don\u2019t think it\nwas a major discussion, but she said that when you\u2019re hungry, sometimes -- it was there,\nshe didn\u2019t think she was taking it from anybody else, so whatever. I was 10 years old, so I\ndidn\u2019t go into it, in major, you know, depth.",
        "A: I think so. My father and I had a wonderful relationship. He was a very quiet and very\nloving man, very successful in business. My father -- I think the reason for that during the\nwar years, 1s that by -- my mother did not look Jewish, and I was a little girl, and I -- I\ndon\u2019t know what -- what it looks like, but I guess I didn\u2019t look obviously Jewish, I had\nblue eyes, and -- my father definitely looked Jewish. He had a no -- you know, a nose that\nwas more obviously Jewish, and not only that, but what they were doing 1s -- had men\njust drop their pants, and that was certainly easy to identify. So, I think my father, during\nsituations where we were questioned, or had to negotiate to stay at someone\u2019s house, or\nwere stopped on the street, my father always stayed in the background. In -- You know,\nduring -- during the time of hiding, and also my father had a kidney stone problem, so my\nmother was very protective of his health. During -- Before the hiding, during the -- 01 --\nthe bombing, the air raids, my mother was in charge of the building, and we went down\nto the cellar, and all that kind of stuff, so she had more mobility, and was able to\naccomplish more, we stayed more in the background.",
        "A: Oh yes, definitely. Every Sunday we went to the zoo, we went to the playground, we\nwent to the amusement park, and he would come -- I had this huge world map on the\ncloset, or the wall of my room, and every evening after he came home from the office, we\nwould play a game of identifying capitals. Countries all over the world, and eventually\nrivers, and oceans, and stuff, and it was -- it was a different kind of life than today. The\nfathers came home at the end of the day, mothers kind of took care of all the bathing and\ngetting you to bed, and all that kind of stuff, but I had a very, very close relationship with\nmy father, and a -- a very loving relationship. In some ways, I think I was probably closer\nto him.",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "A: No. He died when I was pregnant with my daughter, yeah. He was -- Actually, I was\nthe last person that he saw. I went up to his office, in 1957, to show him my first batch of\nmaternity clothes, and he died on the way home. He got on the Fifth Avenue bus to go\nhome, lived on Riverside Drive, my mother\u2019s still there, and he got off the bus, and he\ndied.",
        "A: He had a heart condition. I was really not even aware of how serious it was, I mean, he\nwas in the office that day, he wasn\u2019t home.",
        "A: Yes, my mother 1s having a very hard time right now, actually. My mother is 87, and\nshe has dementia. So, up to two years ago, she was in better health than most of my\ncontemporaries, and actually, she still 1s, except for the fact that she gets very confused,\nshe\u2019s getting depressed. She still goes to the Philharmonic, she still goes to the opera. She\nlives at home, in the same apartment on Riverside Drive, but she\u2019s aware that she\u2019s not as\nwell as she was, not physically, but mentally. They say -- I don\u2019t know what the\ndifference is, but they say it\u2019s not Alzheimer\u2019s, it\u2019s dementia, she has aortic stenosis,\nwhich is a clogging of the main artery. Blood doesn\u2019t flow to the brain too well, and she\u2019s\nreally scared, and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s really rough right now.",
        "A: Yeah, I love cake, yeah.",
        "A: Yellow cake, chocolate cake preferably, but when desperate, I'll eat yellow cake. And\nI love apricot jam, that was -- that went in it, and one of the other things we used to do,\nsince food was scarce, we used to have these -- you know these kielbasa, it\u2019s like a hot\ndog, but it\u2019s like a salami texture, and it\u2019s very long and skinny, and I don\u2019t know how\nwe acquired a piece, and my mother would cut one tiny, tiny little wedge, or circle, and\ncut it up into many, many, many pay -- many pieces, and pretend that that was a\nsandwich, or a piece of bread with it on. But instead of like eating the whole thing, it was\nrationed.",
        "A: Yeah. The only thing that I don\u2019t eat, which really was sent to us after the war by my\ngrandfather when they would send us care packages, 1s Spam. And I had -- We had no\nclue. They would send us Spam, and they sent nail polish, that they -- we would sell, and\nI don\u2019t know what other food product, but I adored ham, and the Spam had that kind of a\ntaste. And we had, you know, never seen canned products before, so that was my very\nfavorite, and I must tell you, when we came here, and I said Spam, everybody looked at\nme like thi -- and I always meant to buy Spam, and it\u2019s sort of like buying the \u201cEnquirer,\u201d\nyou\u2019re embarrassed to buy it, but you look at -- over somebody\u2019s shoulder at the checkout\ncounter. But I\u2019ve never bought it, and I always wondered if I bought it, what it would\ntaste like today, but that was the only thing that I ate then, and I have not eaten since.",
        "A: No. No, we were definitely -- I guess by Stateside standards, we would be Reform, but\nthere it was Conservative. We sat separately, but it was -- we were not kosher, we did not\nspeak Yiddish, my grandparents didn\u2019t speak Yiddish. We were definitely assimilated\nupper middle class Hungarian Jews.",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s very hard to say. You -- You know, children fall into a lifestyle that\nthey\u2019re in, and they don\u2019t say what would it have been like if I had been kosher, or -- or\nlived in -- I don\u2019t know, the lower east side, or somewhere else. I mean, the very first\nthing my parents did when we got here, is got tickets to Metropolitan Opera, cause that\nwas their food. You know, we did bring some money, not a great deal, but we certainly\nweren\u2019t poor. But we probably spent more money on the opera than we did on food,\nbecause food we ate, but I had a very close friend, and I think I told that story, in high\nschool, whose father was a hairdresser, and they lived in Jackson Heights, and every\nSunday, they had roast beef, and this really expensive dinner. And we didn\u2019t. We had hot\ndogs, and beans, and I don\u2019t know, chicken or whatever, I mean, we didn\u2019t starve, but the\nquantity of food was not a major importance, but cultural activities were. So, you know, I\ndon\u2019t know what it would have been like. I think I assimilated very quickly. We got here\nin the spring of \u201947, and I went to a very fancy girl\u2019s camp in Maine, that my daughter\nsubsequently went to, that\u2019s still there, and if I had granddaughters, they\u2019d be going there.\nAnd then I went to public schools, I went to Hunter High School, and Hunter College.\nAnd I never had any Hungarian friends, except for my parents and their friends. I spoke\nEnglish, had no reason to speak anything else, and as I grew older, I started speaking\nEnglish and Hungarian, kind of half and half. I started with one language and finished\nwith the other with my parents. I mean, they spoke English with an accent, but they\ncertainly spoke it well enough. And I married an American, and I had absolutely no\nreason, so I definitely assimilated, and I think maybe if I had been more religious, I\nwould have assimilated differently, or not as easily.",
        "A: Absolutely, I always have. We converted for a short time, strictly for acquiring papers\nthat they -- they thought may have saved our lives. It probably wouldn\u2019t have, but in\nthose days you did everything that you could to -- just in case. Several of my parents\nfriends, when they came here, remained whatever religion they converted to, and raised\ntheir children, whatever they were. I --I\u2019m -- You know, I know them, but I -- they\nweren\u2019t -- I was not friendly with them, so I don\u2019t know if they were Catholic, or\nProtestant, or what they converted to, I really don\u2019t know, but one of my mother\u2019s\nfriend\u2019s son is a minister. So -- And a lot of them intermarried. I married twice, both\nJewish. I\u2019ve always belonged to a synagogue, we always observed the holidays -- holy\ndays. My daughter was Confirmed, and married by a rabbi, and they are really quite --\nwell they\u2019re -- they belong to a Reform synagogue also, but they are a very traditional\nJewish family.",
        "A: Here? Temple Emmanuel.",
        "A: Yeah, right. But you know, it\u2019s interesting, because my grandfather, and grandmother,\nwho came here in 1939 joined Temple Emmanuel, because it was very much like the\nsynagogue we belonged to in Budapest. Have you ever been?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, the synagogue, it\u2019s not a shul, I mean it\u2019s -- you know, everybody always things\neastern Europe has these little Orthodox shuls. This is the biggest synagogue in Europe,\nand I think the second biggest in the world, it 1s huge. It\u2019s very impressive looking, it\u2019s\nprobably not all that different looking than Emmanuel, maybe a little bit smaller. You do\nsit separately, and it is Conservative, so they do wear talisses, it\u2019s -- you know, I don\u2019t\nthink they do at Emmanuel. But it\u2019s not by any means Orthodox, or -- and as I said, I left\nwhen I was 13, so I didn\u2019t go to Hebrew school or anything there. And my grandfather\njoined Temple Emmanuel, so when we came here, he started taking us to services there.\nAnd as I got 0 -- you know, older, and I was married, I got my own membership, and I\nwas Confirmed. No, my -- my parents were there also, and I was Confirmed there. And --\nAnd my daughter was raised there, went through Hebrew school, and was Confirmed\nthere, so --",
        "A: Absolutely. I would have been very upset if hadn\u2019t married one.",
        "A: Sounds like \u201cFiddler on the Roof,\u201d but tradition.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it ever came up. I don\u2019t think I ever dated anyone who wasn\u2019t, and except\nfor one young man who was absolutely gorgeous, that my daughter dated, a very, very\nbright young man, she only dated Jewish boys, too. So, I really don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know if it\nwas just the circle of friends that I traveled with was limited, I don\u2019t know, I mean I -- I\nnever dated anyone who wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yes, probably. I mean, not to that extent, but yes. And I really get annoyed\nwith it sometimes, cause I still -- I think I was brought up that way. I mean, it had nothing\nto do with the war, I was brought up, you know, parents, teachers, God, you know, all\nthat is up there, and you don\u2019t question, and you do, and -- and respect, and when your\nparents tell you something, you do. You stand up when older people come into the room,\nI still do, even though I\u2019m older. And very often, with older people, I find that I talk to\nthem like I was a child. So I think there\u2019s a little bit, you know, of that still in me.",
        "A: With that kind of respect. That when I do, I realize that, you know, I\u2019m -- \u2019ma\ngrown-up. And I think it\u2019s interesting, because I\u2019ve been married twice, and I -- I think I\nimposed the role on myself, of the t -- the traditional wife. Make breakfast, cut the\nbananas, put out the cereal, you know, kind of stuff, and it just the way it was, and just\nthe way I did it. I -- I think at some point I questioned it. Sometimes I get annoyed with\nthe fact that I\u2019m still doing it, but I do anyhow. And it\u2019s okay, you know.",
        "A: Oh my -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s interesting, you know, I was going to give you a quick answer.\nShe really is a traditional wife, much more so -- my daughter is very, very bright. She and\nher husband met in law school. She practiced for about 10 years, and she has three\nchildren. She worked part time after the first one was born, at the law firm, and went back\nafter a second child, and then she realized that she really didn\u2019t want to be doing this, and\nshe really wanted to be with her children. And even though she does work part time now,\nsh -- 1t just happens -- she lives in Connecticut, and she works for Yankelovich Group,\nwhich is a big market research firm, they happened to be in Westport, and she just kind of\nlucked out with a good offer. But she works part time, strictly at her own hours, and she\u2019s\ndefinitely a homemaker.",
        "A: Lisa.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t know if she would agree. Actually, in many ways, even\nthough her children are very different -- well, first of all they\u2019re three boys, which is a\nvery different thing than one daughter, and times are different, and what fashionable is\ndifferent. I don\u2019t mean fashionable clothes-wise, but behavior-wise. But I think in many\nways, she still 1s quite traditional, but not to the extent I -- when they were first married,\nand I saw my son-in-law taking his shirts to the laundry, I was appalled, and I was -- I\njust say, w -- you know, this is what you\u2019re supposed to be doing, and she gave me a look\nlike, you know, they\u2019re his shirts. And you know, so -- but it was a very small thing, and I\nthink my son-in-law\u2019s a wonderful father, and I think with the children it\u2019s definitely\nmore of a joint venture than it was . My ex-husband was a very good father, but 1-it -- it\nwas more the roles, you know, I was at home, and had dinner ready, and the baby bathed,\nand all that, and he did a lot of stuff with her, because I think in our generation, I think\nthat was becoming more of the thing, but they were the -- th -- they made the money, and\nI mean, you know, they had to go to work. Somebody had to go to work, and somebody\nhad to stay home.",
        "A: I went to college, and I taught -- I -- I was a teacher. I was home for the first six or\nseven years. And I must tell you, I wouldn\u2019t have traded it for the world.",
        "A: Well, I started out with elementary school, and -- and I went back to school -- I went\nback for my Master\u2019s when I was 40, and got a degree in special education. That was a\nfairly new degree they were giving, and I just kind of fell into it in public school. I\nsubstituted in a couple of special ed classes, and I didn\u2019t have a clue what I was doing,\nbut I really liked it, and I went back for my Master\u2019s, and then I taught special ed. But I\ntruly and truly believe that when you have children, when they\u2019re little, you\u2019re missing\nout on a great deal if you\u2019re not with them. And so are the children. And it was\ninteresting, this has nothing to do with the Holocaust, but I was watching Larry King\nyesterday, and Mary Tyler Moore was interviewed, and she said that was the one thing, if\nshe had to do it all over again, she would have been home. I think she lost her child.\nThere were a lot of tragedies there. I don\u2019t even know if she has any now, but I think her\nchild either OD\u2019d, or something bad happened. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t remember what it\nwas, but she was very adamant about it, and almost teary, that you owe your children, if\nyou have them, to spend time with them. And you can\u2019t have it all, and I think that\u2019s\nreally true.",
        "A: Well, my parents it was dif -- first of all, it was different. This was in Europe, I mean,\nthat was a whole different world. Yes, the mothers were home. I mean, I had a nanny, and\nI had a housekeeper, and I had a cook. Not I, but my family, but my parents were always\nthere, I was -- no question in my mind who -- you know, who was the help, and who were\nmy parents, those -- al-although I loved all my -- most of my nannies. But that was, you\nknow, like playtime stuff. But then my mother, after the war, took over my grandfather\u2019s\nbusiness, and after my father died -- my mother\u2019s a very competent woman, I mean she --\nshe was not a career person, but she\u2019s extremely bright and capable, when she had to run\nthe business she did. I mean, when the war broke out, my mother didn\u2019t know how to\ncook or clean or do any of those things, but that\u2019s not how proper young ladies were\nraised. But let me tell you, within a very short time, she became a very good cook, she\u2019s\nbi -- very good laundress. I don\u2019t know how to iron, she does.

I\ndon\u2019t know how I stayed alive during the war, cause I used to have a stupid habit of\nsmelling things before I would eat it, when I wasn\u2019t sure what it was, cause there was --\nthere was a lot of yucky stuff being served, is the understatement. But there were a lot of\ndead animals on the -- on the streets, and people would get meat from horses and dogs,\nand that did not appeal to me, so I would only eat what I like, and I still only eat what I\nlike. Course, I like a lot of things now, but --",

I\ndidn\u2019t know about bagels, I didn\u2019t know about Yiddish. This was all, you know, new to\nme, when we came here. And neither did my parents.",

And it -- the other thing that\nwas interesting is I went to a public school, and before the war, religious education was\npart of the public school education, and during that period you had English, whatever,\ngeography, history, math, whatever, and then it was religion, and the Catholic kids went\nto their class, and Jewish kids went to their class, and it was, you know, history of -- of\nthe religion. Actually, my very closest friend in Hungary was a Catholic girl, who I tried\nvery hard to get out here. I wrote to the Cardinal and all that, but then I lost track of her.",
        "A: Yes, actually, I\u2019ve been back to Budapest oh, many, many years ago the first time,\nsecond time 20 years ago, and last year it was the best of all, my husband and I took our\noldest grandson, that\u2019s my daughter\u2019s oldest son, who had just been Bar Mitzvahed, and\nwe took him to London and Budapest. And it was really great.",
        "A: I certainly did. We went to the synagogue, we went to, you know, all the places I used\nto visit. We went out to the playgrounds, and where I used to ice skate, and went to hear\nGypsy music, we went to the opera. We didn\u2019t stay there too long, it was ballet, and a 13\nyear old boy is not heavy into ballet. But I just wanted him to see it. The music was\nlovely, and we -- actually I said, let\u2019s go, and we can leave at intermission, which we did.\nAnd we went to hear -- went to see folk dancing, Hungarian folk dancing, and so it was\nwonderful.",
        "A: Oh, it was just -- I mean, it\u2019s hard to describe, it was -- and he really enjoyed it. Just\nbefore it was time to go, I thought to myself, I must be out of my mind, I mean here we\nare grandparents, he\u2019s 13, he\u2019s going to want to watch basketball game, and you know,\nlook for his friends, and here I\u2019m schlepping him, you know -- actually Budapest was his\nidea, and since we had like eight days, I thought, you know, that\u2019s a bit much, and it was\na great combination. He of all my grandchildren, was the only one that\u2019s really been\ninterested in my history, and the Holocaust. I\u2019ve taken him several times to Washington.\nWe were there for the opening. We\u2019ve been there f -- at the capital, where they have the\nceremony for the Holocaust, and he\u2019s asked me many times to tell my story. When he\nwas quite little, he invited me to Holocaust week at his public school, first grade class,\nand second grade class, as well as his Sunday school class. So I have gone and spoken to\nthe kids, and stuff, and I bought him books on the Holocaust. So he\u2019s read a lot, and is\nquite interested. The other two are not particularly interested. Actually, my daughter took\nthem to see \u201cLife is Beautiful,\u201d and -- and after that, my other two grandchildren sort of\nsaid, you know, what was it like for me, but it was -- took a -- s -- one sentence to\nanswer, and that was it.",
        "A: The oldest one is now 14, and the next one 1s 12. The little one\u2019s nine. And my\nhusband has three children, and tho -- and they\u2019re five -- five more on that side, but they\nwere all born since we\u2019re married, so we really -- they\u2019re -- call them my grandchildren\nas well. So they\u2019re eight all together.",
        "A: Oh yeah. But probably more so since the Hidden Children conference. And, of course,\nthe museum. I always -- I -- oh, this was years ago, when they were planning -- building\nthe initial plans to build the Holocaust Museum, there was also one built in New York,\nand I know this sounds silly, but I wanted to give a major contribution, and I sort of went\nand interviewed both the Washington people, and New York people, and -- and made a\ndecision, because I support the one in New York a bit, but there was something about the\nWashington. I thought if I was going to give one chunk of money, I\u2019d rather g -- do it one\nplace. And so we went -- we went to Washington to see the original plans, and they were\nin the office, and I went with my mother, and then I went back with my daughter, we\nwent to the hard hat -- th -- walkthrough when the museum was being built. And so that\u2019s\n-- was sort of -- I mean, I\u2019ve never had a problem, or thought about not being Jewish, but\nsomehow the Holocaust was a long time ago. I didn\u2019t remain in contact with any of the\nHungarians, or Holocaust survivors, so that my life kind of went on it\u2019s own metry way.\nEvery once in a while, people will ask me -- the first year that I went to camp -- and I told\nthis on my video, I was like the token refugee, and it\u2019s really funny, cause I\u2019m friendly\nwith a lot of my bunkmates, and they always tease me about my accent, and -- at the\ntime, and about being a -- the token refugee in camp. That was -- I thought it would be\nharder than it turned out to be, and I was very lucky, because I was literally shipped from\nhaving just arrived here at the age of 13, to this very American camp, with baseball, and I\nasked them what those pillows were doing on the baseball field. And I was different, you\nknow. I wore hand en -- embroidered undershirts, and I wrote home that they\nimmediately should send me a bra. And that was definitely European kid, and there\u2019s a\nvery big difference. But I was very lucky, I had some nice friends, and I somehow fit in. I\nthink they picked on somebody else.",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm. And I tur -- I turned out awhile later, that the director of the camp gave\nmy bunk a speech on how to be nice to me, because I might be different, and may not\nspeak English so well, I may not know everything they know. And 13 is late to start\ncamp, they had all been there before, they -- some of them had had friends, and -- but I\ndidn\u2019t know about that til later, so --",
        "A: Well, we had relatives here, and tha -- actually, these people had honeymooned in -- in\nBudapest, and looked up my parents because they were related somehow or other. And\nthey had a daughter who was couple of years younger than I, and they spoke to them, and\nthey said, \u201cWell, what -- what do you do here during the summer?\u201d And they said, \u201cWell,\nNew York gets pretty hot, and most kids do something, or have a ha -- something.\u201d I\ndon\u2019t really know exactly what the conversation was all about, but next thing they were --\nthis lady came over and showed us pictures of a camp, and I got camp clothes, and went\noff to cam, that\u2019s how. And the cousin, whose daughter went to this camp that I was sent\nto, had nothing to do with me, and she was two years younger than I, and at that age it\u2019s\nlike a generation. I mean, even nine months, 10 months, is -- is a big deal. But, that she\nwas in a different bunk, and she wasn\u2019t going to have anything to do with me, so -- \u2019'm\nfriendly with her now, but we weren\u2019t for a long time.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Hm. I don\u2019t know. I hadn\u2019t really thought about it. The war ended in \u201945, this was in\n\"47. I think my parents wanted me to assimilate, and I think they thought this would be a\ngood way for me to become an American teenager. I don\u2019t know. I have no clue. I -- I\nhad no problem going. I had a wonderful time, I went back two years. I still have a lot of\nclose friends from camp. My daughter went to the same camp. So, I -- I don\u2019t know. I\nmean, somebody else might have handled it differently, I don\u2019t know. My parents had the\nopportunity to send me to a monastery to be taken care of by nuns, during the war time,\nand then they made the decision to stay together. So --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah. Yeah, and we did, I mean, until -- until she went off to college, and\nthen subsequently got married.",
        "A: Oh yes, my 10\" birthday. That\u2019s when the Germans marched in, yeah, that was quite a\nbirthday. I still like hot dogs, that\u2019s what we had then. That\u2019s what we had for my\nbirthday party, hot dogs, frankfurters. Not served on buns. And we had a -- an apartment\nin the city, kind of a wide boulevard kind of a street, and we were all sitting around, lot of\nnannies, and mothers, and daughters, and we heard noises, like marching noises. And we\nlooked out the window, and the Nazis were marching into Budapest. Hungary was the\nlast country to be taken over, and I remember everybody very quietly saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time to\ngo home.\u201d And I was not happy, cause they messed up my party. And it -- you know,\nalso, interestingly enough in those days, parents did not find it necessary to explain\neverything to their children. I mean, they were going home, that\u2019s it, you know. That\u2019s --\nWas nothing to question, and you didn\u2019t, so --",
        "A: Oh, I love birthdays, I just had my husband\u2019s 70\" birthday, and surprised him, we\ntook the whole family to Las Vegas for the weekend. So that answers your question.\nYeah, I like birthdays.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, but I still eat hot dogs. Actually, ve stopped because of cholesterol, but my\nfavorite lunch 1s a [indecipherable] hot dog and fresh orange juice on the street.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t smoke.",
        "A: No, no, I never did actually. I smoked one evening with -- with a friend of mine that I\nwent to junior high school with, that was my next closest friend, right after camp, I went\nto junior high school, eighth grade, on the west side, and -- and she\u2019s still -- we\u2019re still\nvery good friends. We were in her parents bedroom, and we smoked a cigarette. This\nwas, I think 14. Her mother came in and pretended she didn\u2019t know, cause we stuck the\ncigarettes under the bed, but the room was filled with smoke. And I hated it, I was like\nchoking, and my eyes were bothering me. I said, \u201cThis is a stupid thing to do.\u201d But it was\ngrown up, which is I think what a lot of young people s -- got hooked on it now.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: IT have to call him.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I think that\u2019s probably -- most of it was\nhis idea, and I kind of went along with it. He\u2019s a year older, he lives in Toronto. I don\u2019t\nknow, it just seemed like a fun thing to do, it kept us busy. We all were aware of the fact\nthat our fathers weren\u2019t working. We thought that this would be an income situation, and\neverybody was delighted. I mean, they were very -- there were no cigarettes to be had, a\nlot of people smoked, my parents did not. And it was fun.",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "A: Yeah. I was never worried about money, I mean, I was never worried about money\nwhen we didn\u2019t have any, and I was never worried about it when we did, you know, it all\n-- and it was -- it was never really a major issue. My parents were very good about -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t know, 1-it\u2019s hard to explain. I think, for my mother, 1t was very important to have\nproper appearances, and contrary to a lot of people during the war, who had holes and\nstuff in their clothes, and I\u2019d -- I al -- I remember that very clearly, there was -- there\nwere never any holes in anything, it was always mended. When I outgrew the dress, my\nmother would take from another dress, and lengthen it. This is when the war was going\non, and shortly after when there -- first there was nothing to buy, and no material, no\nmoney, you know, and all that, but I remember always looking clean and neat, and you\nknow, the war was not a reason to not behave properly, and not to look nice. And it\u2019s\nfunny, because I said that to my husband just recently, and it sort of -- you look at some\nof these old war pictures, how people were going to concentration camp with suits and\nties and hats. It\u2019s funny, I was watching -- we were watching \u201cRoman Holiday,\u201d -- oh,\n\u201cThree Coins in a Fountain\u201d last night, and I said to my husband that I think I was in the\nwrong generation because Louis Jordan looks so wonderful, and here they\u2019re walking\naround in ridiculous places, and he\u2019s in double breasted suits, and a tie, and she has\ngloves on, and a hat. And, you know, he opens doors, and I said, you know, always\nwalking around now in jeans and khakis, sort of, you know, casual, because that\u2019s the\nworld we live in, but I think I kind of like that.",
        "A: Well, maybe not gloves, but yeah, I mean I kind of like -- I can go either way, P\u2019ve\nalways said that. I mean, I\u2019d have no problem having tea with the queen, or camping out\nin jeans. You know, I -- I\u2019m fairly comfortable wherever you -- you put me, and so --",
        "A: Yes, that I still do. I don\u2019t like going anywhere, and not having a reservation, I really\ndon\u2019t. And I mean it\u2019s -- it -- it\u2019s -- I\u2019m not scared the way I was, and I know where it\u2019s\ncoming from, and if I didn\u2019t, I probably wouldn\u2019t, you know, have a nervous breakdown,\nbut I know a couple of years ago, we were coming back, I don\u2019t know, from Boston or\nsomeplace, and we couldn\u2019t get in somewhere, you know, just at a hotel, a motel,\nwhatever on the road, because it was getting late. And I really was -- it made me\nuncomfortable. So, that should be the worst thing, you know. I still like traveling with my\npillow. I still do, really. Actually, I was just thinking, tomorrow with the two children,\nwith carry-ons, if I\u2019ve got room for my pillow, but I\u2019m going to see.",
        "A: Because that\u2019s the one thing I took with me. You know, like little children have\nblankies and all these things, I had my pillow. And I had that same pillow for many,\nmany years. It\u2019s gone, I mean the feathers, or whatever was in there is gone, but I always\nliked having my own pillow. I think it\u2019s not for the reasons any more, I -- I don\u2019t sleep so\n-- as well as I did, and most hotels have these awful foam rubber things, so I d -- I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s anything to do with the war, I just -- I don\u2019t sleep well, and if I -- if I have a bad\npillow, I\u2019m really up all night, so I like to take my soft, cuddly pillow.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, and it really mooshes up sort of small, so I can, you know, stick in into a\nduffel, and carry it.",
        "A: No. No, I don\u2019t, no.",
        "A: No. Well, I didn\u2019t do any of the packing, so no. Actually, my grandson was Bar Mitzv\n-- was -- when he was born and -- and circumcised, he wore my grandfather\u2019s little dress\nthat my mother had saved. I have no clue how we got through a war, and my mother\nbrought stuff. I mean, it\u2019s mind boggling now that I\u2019m going over a lot of the things, it\u2019s\njust amazing, the pictures and things that she has, that you think would have stayed there.\nSo -- But she has a lot -- you know, a lot of stuff, pre-war. She has calendars and date\nbooks from 50 - 60 years ago, that she sent here after the war, so -- I mean, they all came\non a boat or something.",
        "A: Mm-hm. It all got shipped, we shipped all our furniture, and dishes, and all that kind\nof stuff, so whatever was packed, is here.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Oh yeah, I mean some of the furniture my parents had to sell, because it\ndidn\u2019t fit into any apartments here, because the rooms were big, the ceilings were high,\nand you know, all that. But my mother\u2019s bedroom, dining room, living room, 1s all the\nEuropean furniture. And it\u2019s very European looking, except it has wall to wall carpets,\ninstead of rugs.",
        "A: Oh yeah. And actually, my father had a beautiful desk that my mother sold after he\ndied, and I was always sorry. It was a beautiful desk, I never -- I really don\u2019t know why\nshe sold it.",
        "A: Yeah, I sort of remember our old apartment, but you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s\nfading a little. Sometimes I don\u2019t know if I remember the real thing, or if I remember\nstories or pictures, you know. I mean, as I told you, I\u2019ve been married twice, and I would\nhave been married 44 years all together, and every time I bought new dishes, I\u2019ve always\nbought it kind of half-heartedly, because my favorite dishes, my mother has. And I\nalways sort of in back of my head, knew that one of these days, hopefully the far away,\nthose would be mine, so why should I bother? I mean, I\u2019ve perfectly nice dishes, but I -- I\njust love her Haron dishes, which is Hungarian. And she has all, I think place setting for\n24, and the whole thing, so -- and that all was sent over, crystal and all that kind of stuff.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s funny, cause now that my mother is not well, you sort of think\nabout what happens if, and you know, I\u2019ve thought about some of the things that she has,\nand you know, it\u2019s a different lifestyle, and I don\u2019t know how -- if I\u2019d have any room, but\nthere\u2019s a grandfather\u2019s clock that I really love, and that\u2019s sort of my -- the only thing\nthat\u2019s really my childhood. I mean, otherwise it\u2019s just nice furniture, but -- and it\u2019s old\nand it\u2019s beautiful, but it\u2019s not something -- but the clock is like, sort of my childhood. It\u2019s\na grandfather\u2019s clock, drives you nuts, chimes every 15 minutes.",
        "A: Did time take on a different meaning? I don\u2019t know. I mean, had days and nights, you\nknow, and they were long. I don\u2019t know. I really can\u2019t answer that. I know I -- I don\u2019t --\nwe didn\u2019t have beds, we usually slept on the floor on things, and I was always in the\nmiddle, between my parents. I\u2019m an only child. We had to go to the bathroom outside, so\nthat was a big deal. I don\u2019t know, I -- I think they all -- there was always something to a-\namuse me. The -- Sometimes there were other children, depending on where we were. I\ndon\u2019t know, I -- I don\u2019t really remember.",
        "A: Oh yes, there was a lot of packing going on. We were -- It was sort of on again, off\nagain. My grandparents were here, and my grandmother died. My uncle, my mother\u2019s\nbrother, also had come, in 1941 to visit his parents, and stayed, and actually joined the\nAmerican army, and came to see us in Budapest after the war, part of the liberation. So\nwe were coming as vi -- on a visitor visa, but sort of planning to stay, and so we pa --\nthey packed, I mean, we had packers, and marked things, and all that. So that\u2019s how come\nall the furniture. Not everything we packed came, cause they confiscated stuff. My\nfather\u2019s paintings, library paintings, we had a Steinway Baby Grand, that didn\u2019t show up,\nit\u2019s just as well. But all the, you know, dishes, and personal stuff, and furniture came. So\nI was definitely aware wi -- this boy -- my boyfriend who\u2019s in Toronto, he gave me a\ncharm that I still have, went to the train to see us off, and another -- my other friend gave\nme a charm, and it was an adventure. I don\u2019t remember being terribly sad about the\nwhole thing, we -- we were traveling. After the war, my mother and I went to Switzerland\nand met my grandfather, and then came back, and we came -- we went to Liverpool, and\nwe took a beautiful Cuinard boat, the Mauritania, which doesn\u2019t exist any more, but it\u2019s --\nit was a beautiful boat, was very fancy. I had a wonderful time calling for room service,\nand running around. My mother was quite ill, she got seasick and she didn\u2019t wear all the\nnice clothes that she had planned to wear. And so I spent a lot of time with my father.\nSaw lots of good movies, Joan Crawford. And then when we got here, my grandfather\nwas here, and my uncle, who had married, and I\u2019m very, very close to -- well, she was at\nthe time nine -- 20 years old, so -- but I was 13, but we, you know, really very close\nfriends. And as I said, I assimilated very, very quickly.",
        "A: One little gold charm -- charm -- well, I had a charm bracelet, and it just says, Thomas\n-- to Eva, and Tommy, that was his name. And we talk occasionally, because his mother\nand my mother were best friends. So were our fathers, but they all -- they died, and his\nmother is -- is in a nursing home. She -- Her mind is fine, and physically she\u2019s a disaster,\nwith my mother it\u2019s the other way around. But my mother is very, very close to Tom.\nActually, throughout all these years, they stayed closer. We talk, but it\u2019s usually about\nour mothers, because his life sort of went in a different direction. He\u2019s married, but he\u2019s\nseparated, he\u2019s -- doesn\u2019t have any children. He\u2019s very European. And -- And I\u2019m really\nbeca -- you know, assimilated, much more so.",
        "A: Me?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: The other charm was from -- that was silver, this one was gold, was just a little --\nplain, little silver charm from my friend, the Catholic girl, actually, that I told you about,\nGloria was her name.",
        "A: Oh yeah. I don\u2019t wear them, but yes I do.",
        "A: Oh, wonderful memories. And actually, with my Hidden Children group, a number of\nyears ago, this woman walks into my apartment -- and most of the woman are from the\nNew York area, and she was in -- oh, that\u2019s my husband, I didn\u2019t tell him you were\ncoming. Oh, that\u2019s all right, he\u2019s going that way. Came from Boston, so she was like\nvisiting our group, and she looked at me, she said, \u201cWhat was your maiden name?\u201d So I\nsaid, \u201cBrust.\u201d She says, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me?\u201d I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t got a clue.\u201d Well, I\nthink she may have known in advance. Anyhow, we went to grade school together, and I\nfound my -- what do you call that thing you sign in school? Not a memory --",
        "A: No, it\u2019s not a yearbook, it\u2019s, you know, roses are red, violets are blue, you sign this\nlittle autograph -- isn\u2019t 1t an autograph book? It\u2019s got a name. It\u2019s not a yearbook, it\u2019s just\nblanks, and --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, and she had written in it. It was really bizarre. And then, of course, we went\nthrough the whole thing, and there were a lot of, you know, it wa -- I mean, this Tommy\nfrom Toronto is in there, too. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: My grandfather, my uncle. I don\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t really, you know, think about it all that\nmuch.",
        "A: Yes, saw the Statue of Liberty.",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- Everybody was sort of making a big fuss about it, I don\u2019t think I really knew\ntoo much about what it was. I remember getting up early, and -- as the boat came in. We\nwent to -- My grandfather and grandmother, when they first came here -- she died, but he\nstayed there, stayed at a residential hotel on 96\" Street and West End Avenue, called the\nMarcy. The place is still there, but it\u2019s not a residential hotel any more, and so my\ngrandfather took a small apartment for us there. So that\u2019s where we started out. I didn\u2019t\nthink that was so great. I mean, you know, it was a small apartment, and -- but there was\nan ice skating ring across the street, and a tennis court. It was a city thing, but it changed,\nyou know, winter and summer. And then, as I said, I -- within a month or two, I was\ngone, in camp, and then I started junior high school. That apartment was really very\nsmall, was like a one bedroom apartment, and then we moved into a -- another residential\nhotel k-kind of a thing on 86\" Street. That\u2019s still there, it\u2019s called the Brewster Hotel, and\nthat\u2019s when I started junior high school [indecipherable]. And my parents were looking\nfor an apartment, and waiting for the furniture to come out. Oh no, the furniture went to\nManhattan storage, but we didn\u2019t have an apartment, and was very hard to find one. I\ndon\u2019t know if it had to do with size or money, but you know, we was definitely staying in\nManhattan, in a nice neighborhood, so -- but I -- you know, I didn\u2019t know where one\nwould go, or anything like that.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yes, I was very close to my uncle. He was already married, and then he\nbrought his young and very beautiful wife along. And they had a baby shortly after, so I\nbecame cousin.",
        "A: Exciting. Lot of people, lot of people waiting. I mean, I didn\u2019t go through Ellis Island,\nor one of those things, you know, we were coming out first class, so 1t was a perfectly\nnice landing, and everybody was very happy, and we, every Sunday went to some\nHungarian restaurant, cause that\u2019s where my grandfather liked to go, and there were a lot\nof people that my parents knew from Europe, so they very quickly ended up with a\nnucleus of friends. My parents, I don\u2019t quite know why, but I was like the oldest child, so\neven though they all had children, they were all younger, and I was never -- I knew of\nthem, and knew them, but wi -- I was never friendly with any of those Hungarian\nchildren. And I made friends at camp, I made friends at junior high school, and I made\nmy own friends. I was occasionally embarrassed by my parent\u2019s accent, in the beginning.\nI wa -- But, it wa -- it was funny, I mean, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s ver -- kind of a snotty, childish\nkind of a thing, because our apartment once we moved, was very nice. And it was ina\nvery nice building, and by that time I guess I was a little older, so I was conscious of\nneighborhoods and stuff, and so the accent, and the apartment kind of, you know, evened\nout. I mean, my parents spoke with an accent, but with an educated accent, and -- but I\nwas definitely aware of it. When they came to visit in camp, you know it was a little --\nbut they were young. I mean, I was 21 -- my mother was 21 when I was -- 21 when she\nwas married, and 22 when I was born, or something. My father was 12 years older, but\nthat was customary in Europe, to have the man established before he takes a bride.",
        "A: You know, I\u2019ve thought about that a lot. I don\u2019t know. I think very quickly. And I\nthink that\u2019s because of the circles I got thrown into. My only connection to the past,\nreally, was my parents, and the a -- and their -- their accent, which was definitely\nEuropean. But I became American, you know, really very quickly. It\u2019s interesting, my --\nmy son-in-law has an associate at his firm, and they adopted a Hungarian orphan, just\nrecently, maybe four or five years ago. And they were a little older, they couldn\u2019t have\nchildren, they gave up on adoption here. I guess they heard about eastern European\nchildren, they went there several times, then, make a very long story short, adopted a\nlittle girl, who they went to Europe to get. And -- And my daughter mentioned to this\nwoman about me, and would that be a good -- well, she thought that was a great idea,\ncause this child did not speak English, she was five years old, and petrified. And so I\nwent up to Connecticut, and I met with her. Well, I tell you, by the time that day was\nover, my daughter and I both wanted to adopt this child, and -- and tell this other lady to\ngo away, because she had just no clue. I mean, she wanted to give the kid pizza, this kid\ndidn\u2019t know from pizza. Whatever she was offering her were all -- all the wrong things.\nAnd she meant well, but she came from a different mindset, and -- so I was trying to\nexplain to both of them. And she was perfectly happy in the orphanage. I mean, that was\nher world. These were her friends, and her language, and she was totally uprooted from\nher home, and sent here, and was told that she should appreciate the color TV, and the --\nand the pizza. She is now as American as apple pie. I don\u2019t know, maybe she\u2019s 10 years\nold. I don\u2019t -- I think she\u2019s going through a stage, cause I saw her, I think, the summer\nbefore last, and I said something to her in Hungarian, she didn\u2019t respond. And I picked\nup on it immediately, and then I just switched to English, and told her I was happy to see\nher. I don\u2019t know if she was embarrassed about it, or what, but I got the message. And I\nthink it\u2019ll be a while before she\u2019s able to look back. But her circumstances were different.\nAnd I s -- I -- when I met the mother, she said someday they were going to plan a trip to\nEurope, and -- but I\u2019m not sure going back to some orphanage 1s the same thing. I mean,\nwhen I go back, and have gone back, I have very fond memories, including the war. I\ncertainly wouldn\u2019t want to move back. But it\u2019s -- it -- you know, it\u2019s -- I sometimes\ndream in Hungarian, and I some -- and I count in Hungarian. If I just want to count, you\nknow, a small column in my head or something, which is really weird, cause I don\u2019t\nspeak Hungarian unless I ha -- unless I have to. Well, that\u2019s not true, a taxi driver, if I see\nhis name\u2019s Hungarian, I'll -- my hairdresser\u2019s Hungarian, so I do fall into that.",
        "A: No, no. And not for any reason, I -- no, no.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean, there\u2019s some very famous ones that are Hungarian, that I would like to collect,\nbut those are very expensive. Actually, for the first time about a -- a month ago, I went to\nthe Hungarian consulate, which is a gorgeous, gorgeous brownstone in the east 60\u2019s,\nbecause this friend of mine from Boston, that I went to school with, is a wonderful\nphotographer. That\u2019s not what she does to earn her living, and she would love to become\nan -- you know, more established, and she just hasn\u2019t found -- she does some wonderful,\nwonderful things. It\u2019d be great for corporate art, and I was trying to see if I could help\nher, but I haven\u2019t done too well. She had an exhibit there, but that\u2019s a dead end thing. I\nmean, who was going to go there, a lot of her Hungarian friends? Nothing much\nhappened.",
        "A: Mostly counting, the dreaming is mixed, but every once in awhile, I wake up and\nrealize that I was -- yeah, I\u2019m sorry, did I interrupt you?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Oh, God. Well, definitely not Hungarian first. I would definitely -- probably American\nJewish Hungarian.",
        "A: I think so, yeah. I mean, do you realize, I\u2019m 65 years old, and I\u2019ve been here 52 years,\nyou know? And I haven\u2019t had -- I mean, some of my Hidden Children friends are -- speak\nHungarian all the time with each other. This one in Boston is -- she wrote to me in\nHungarian once. I mean, I was able to read it, but with a great deal of difficulty. I said,\ndon\u2019t do this to me again, cause I -- you know, I speak it, but with difficulty. But some of\nthem are definitely living more in a Hungarian world than I. I don\u2019t really live ina\nHungarian world, and it\u2019s only because of the Hidden Children that I\u2019ve even had\ncontact, and became very friendly with some of them, just because I like them, not\nbecause they\u2019re Hungarian, which is very interesting 1n our group. And I think the group\nis kind of changing focus a little, because in the beginning, when we first met at the\nconference, there was this bond, Hungarian Jewish. We formed the group Hidden, not a\nconcentration camp, so a very different -- you know, who you could be in order to belong\nto this group. And we meet in New York, and there are a handful of people who have\napartments in New York, I -- everybody else outside of New York, nobody wants to go\nto Forest Hills, New Jersey, Brooklyn, so the New Yorkers have been, you know having\nthe meetings, which is fine. And there\u2019s some very, very nice people. But the fact that\nyou\u2019re Hungarian and Jewish is not enough to have a relationship. I mean, there are other\nthings in your life that have to work, interests, and what -- what has happened to your\nlife? How are you living, you know, and all that. And -- I mean, there are some really,\nreally nice ladies, who live in Brooklyn, who are very Orthodox, I have absolutely\nnothing in common with them. So --",
        "A: I'd have to be in analysis to answer you, and I\u2019ve never been, so I don\u2019t know.\nProbably, but again, you know, I\u2019m never quite sure -- and we\u2019ve had this discussion with\nthe Hidden Children, how much of -- of one\u2019s being can be blamed on the war. A-As I\nmentioned to you before, at one point, everybody said, everyone that was divorced had to\ndo with the Holocaust. I was divorced, I don\u2019t think it had anything whatsoever to do\nwith the Holocaust. One woman said she purposely married a non-Jew, to avoid\npossibility of this happening again. She has a daughter who 1s a teacher, [indecipherable]\nshalum, which is a synagogue affiliated school. She did get divorced, if it had anything to\ndo with anything, I don\u2019t know.

And -- And you know, it\nwas just a regular boy meets girl, we went out, we, you know, fell in love, we got\nmarried, we had a nice wedding at the Hampshire House, and we moved from a one\nbedroom, to a two bedroom, to a six room, you know, with a upward mobility, and then\nwe, you know, started out working, and you know, did a little better along the way, and\nwe had a daughter, we have a daughter. We didn\u2019t have more children, which was stupid.\nI was pregnant at 40 and decided I was too old. If I had this generation now, it\u2019d be just\nstarting out. I think about that, and at some point, which has nothing whatsoever to do\nwith the Holocaust, we just fell apart, which makes me sad. I mean, I\u2019m -- was very lucky\nto meet my husband, married over 20 years, but I think 1t would have been kind of nice to\nbe married 44 years, happily, to the same person. You know, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s an upheaval, and\nI felt badly, you know, for my daughter, but she handled it very well, and I think she was\ndefinitely more for it than against it.

His two sons, they\u2019re married to Jewish\ngirls, his daughter\u2019s married to a non-Jewish, very nice young man. I find that there\u2019s a\ndifference in culture. I remember when we first met his parents, there were two incidents\nthat made such an impression on me, and they\u2019re married, I don\u2019t know, 16 - 17 years.\nThis young man\u2019s stepfather was telling a story about some incident, and how he was so\nlucky to have met up with Mussolini\u2019s doctor in Europe. I wasn\u2019t so excited by that story.\nAnd then we were talking about some -- something else at dinner, and they were talking\nabout, you know, that Jewish lady comedian on TV. And I was going to say, what is this\nJewish lady comedian. She has a name, she has a profession, but what\u2019s this with the\nJewish lady? And I was very uncomfortable with that. And I don\u2019t think I carry religion,\nyou know, on my shoulder. I\u2019m probably less religious than some of my friends. Some\npeople say I belong to the church on Fifth Avenue, and all that kind of stuff. But there 1s\nsort of a -- you know, a different way of looking at things, and we have a whole bunch of\nfriends who have either Gentile wives or husbands.

And I kind of ran the\noffice. I didn\u2019t have a clue what I was doing. My husband used to come up and help me\nfile, cause there were too many S\u2019s. So I used to file all the other letters, except the S\u2019s.\nAnd there were no computers, I was perfectly happy answering the telephone, you know,\nand I looked nice, and my boss borrowed my husband\u2019s tuxedo, and so you know, we just\nall kind of worked, and then I became pregnant, not that far after -- w-was also -- also\nwas very nice, cause it was in the neighborhood, and I used to run home, and\n[indecipherable]. And then after Lisa was born, when she was little, I used to get these\nmarket research jobs. I used to interview people on the street with a baby, and then -- and\nmy elevator man got me this nice lady who ended up working for us for 14 years, who\nused to come in to clean twice a week. And when she came, I left, and -- for about three\nhours, at nap time. And she was wonderful, and I used to do these market research things,\nso I kind of liked that. And then we moved up here f -- in order for Lisa to go to PS six,\nwhich was a very good public school, and those were the rent control days, and got a rent\ncontrolled apartment, and I started looking around in schools, and I went -- I taught at a\nschool on 108\" and Madison Avenue. Kind of lower Harlem, I guess, whatever you call\nit, and I stayed there for many years.",

If something is torn, sew it. Comb\nyour hair in the morning, you know, those kind of things. So it\u2019s really neatness, and a\ncertain appearance, you know. I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s more that than, you know,\nclothes stuff. I don\u2019t know.",

        "A: Yeah, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re kind of funny looking suede loafers. I don\u2019t know what --\nwhat color would you call these? It\u2019s supposed to be -- it\u2019s not beige, but it\u2019s almost\nbordering on a dull orange kind of thing. And when I bought them, I thought they would\nbe sort of like -- go with everything. Every time I put them on, I think to myself, doesn\u2019t\nreally go with anything. But they\u2019re very comfortable.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "A: Way before I could afford it. When I was quite young, I must have been in my 30\u2019s,\nand we co-couldn\u2019t really afford it, and a lot of my friends were starting to buy mink\nstoles, and whatever those awful things were. And some jewelry, you know, and things.\nThe next level of -- you know, when your husband does well, that next level of luxury.\nAnd I\u2019ve always loved going to museums and galleries. And I was involved with\nBrandeis University National Women\u2019s Committee. And the National Women\u2019s\nCommittee was the sole supporter of the library, because it was a fairly new school, and\nthey didn\u2019t have the alumni money coming in for a library, so the women, when the\nschool was first formed, non-sectarian Jewish school, because education was very\nimportant, we supported the library. We had a very active chapter -- junior chapter in\nNew York, young. There was an older -- our parent\u2019s generation, they formed a younger\nchapter, and I was very much involved with that. And we did a lot of book reviews, and\nart classes, and I guess intellectually stimulating things, as opposed to a lot of other\npeople were playing -- younger people, that had some free time were starting to play Mah\nJongg, or Canasta, and all that kind of stuff, so this was -- we had a stock group, we were\nlearning about that, so whatever was interesting, and I was always interested in that. We\nwent to look at the Barnes collection. And there were a lot of artists popping up that were\ncontemporary, unknown. Galleries that were appearing in Soho, that were new. Andy\nWarhol was becoming, O.K Harris Gallery was -- he used to give ladies art classes,\nbefore he opened the gallery. And they would donate stuff, and we would auction it off,\nor sell it, or whatever. And I was just really interested. Some of the galleries would give\nus cocktail parties, and fundraisers, and stuff, and that\u2019s how that Picasso lino cut back\nthere, it was the first thing that I bought, that was an independent thing, and it was a lot of\nmoney at the time. And we did it.",
        "A: My husband, my fir --",
        "A: First husband, yeah. And then a lot of the little things that you see around like that\nNevillson, and multiple -- they were all multiples, and somebody asked me the other day\nwhat a multiple is. I said it\u2019s a sa -- it\u2019s like -- 1t\u2019s like a lithograph, except in sculptures,\nand I was -- such a funny question. But a lot of artists did that in order to raise money.\nLouise Nevillson was very supportive of Brandeis, and some museums were. And that\nwas a very -- a less expensive way of acquiring things, because they were multiples, they\nwere one of 50, one of a hundred, whatever. And they certainly have, you know, done\nwell along the years. So I\u2019m happy. I mean, I didn\u2019t buy it at the time, because I thought\nit was going to wor -- be worth it, cause I\u2019m not selling anything. But I just liked it. And\nit was all -- always -- I kind of like a little bit of the cutting edge stuff, although every\nonce in awhile -- I went to see the new exhibit at the Metropolitan, I said, you know, I\ncould get rid of some of this, acquire one of those, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s just -- gives me\npleasure, I -- I just like it. We have some stuff really, and actually it\u2019s in the closets, that\nare very angry, and -- stuff I wouldn\u2019t want to hang. Nan Golden, do you know Nan\nGolden? We have a cookie portfolio, I mean, it\u2019s not something I would hang, but I really\nlike it, I think they\u2019re wonderful photographs, and they\u2019re very meaningful, I mean, that\u2019s\nthe generation of the drugs, and the OD\u2019s and stuff. I absolutely can\u2019t think of the young\nman who did that. I thought it was -- the paintings were just spectacular. I absolu -- I\u2019m\nblanking out on his name, he\u2019s Italian. But I thought they were all AIDS victims, turned\nout he had a brain tumor, and he\u2019s alive and well, but they all look -- they really all look\nlike concentration camp survivors. So -- But of all the things to spend money on, in the\nluxury category, I think art would be my -- top of my list.",
        "A: Not really. Y -- I mean, in Europe they had a wonderful -- I remember lots of\npaintings, and they were supposed to have been good paintings, but they never came out,\nand I have -- I don\u2019t really even know who they were, or how valuable they were. That\nwas not something they continued to do. They have a couple of Hungarian painters, that\nwere very well known in the Hungarian circles. Freid -- I don\u2019t know if you ever heard of\n-- kind of impressionists, faux impressionists, but they were, you know, very good\nfriends, and actually I tried to talk my mother once, to buy a Chagall lithograph, and I\nthink she was sorry she didn\u2019t. But no, not here.",
        "A: That\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s interesting, that was the only one that\u2019s definitely German, and I\nhad mixed feelings about it. And the other -- the one that they\u2019re really famous for, the\nwater tanks, that\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s fu -- a very good friend of mine, who I went to a college\nwith, are major collectors, I mean really major, and she\u2019s also an art dealer, and I\u2019ve gone\nwith her a few times, and bought things, you know, through her and with her, and I think\nsomebody had bought this, and they couldn\u2019t pay the last payment, or something, and she\n-- she said, you know, if I don\u2019t buy this, I\u2019m crazy, and it was really a good buy. And I\nliked it, and I -- I don\u2019t even think I was paying attention to the German part, to tell you\nthe truth. If I had, I probably wouldn\u2019t have bought it.",
        "A: Yeah, this 1s a series of nine photographs taken -- what these -- it\u2019s a husband and\nwife, Bescher. I can\u2019t think of their first name, Hannah, and -- I can\u2019t think of his name,\nBescher, but they\u2019re probably one of the most predominant photographers, and they take\nmultiple shots of the same thing. They\u2019re very well known for their water tanks, and\nthese are houses in Germany, and it\u2019s -- they\u2019re no -- I mean, they\u2019re sold as a unit. There\nare nine, aren\u2019t there?",

        "A: Yeah. No, but it\u2019s not because most people, I mean, like the bag I didn\u2019t buy, I didn\u2019t\nbuy not because anybody would have known it, but I mean, I have turned like dishes or\nthings upside down to look, so I don\u2019t know how this kind of major thing snuck in, but it\ncertainly did.",
        "A: Yes, both times. I\u2019ve been married by a rabbi, does that mean -- yeah. First time it was\nat the hotel, the Hampshire House, by a rabbi, actually a Hungarian rabbi, who had come\nhere after the war, and had his congregation in New Haven. And he used to tutor my\nmother and her brother, to earn extra money, to go through school. And the second time\nwe were married at Temple Emmanuel, in the study, of my rabbi, and my husband\u2019s\nrabbi, who happened to have been classmates, so they were good friends, and it just\nworked out well.",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s another one of those things I just didn\u2019t think about. I mean, I -- I don\u2019t\nknow, it just -- I didn\u2019t even think about who else could marry you, like a Justice of the\nPeace, I -- yeah, I don\u2019t know. I mean, if I answered you, 1t wouldn\u2019t really be -- I just\ndidn\u2019t think about it.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes, yeah. Somebody said that, it\u2019s like coming out of the closet. I think what\nhappened, and I don\u2019t know how accurate this 1s, but I think the period of assimilation\nhad passed. I assimilated, I grew up, I was an American teenager, I was married, you\nknow. It is now at the point in time, where with my generation, it\u2019s all over, except these\ntapes. I didn\u2019t think about that 20 or 30 years ago. I wanted to go on with my life, and my\nparents wanted to go on with their lives. I mean, we were all very happy to be here, and\nstill today, when people criticize this country, my European side comes out, and I always\nwant to say, go away. If you don\u2019t like it here, go wherever it\u2019s better. Cause with all the\nproblems here, with all the horrible things, what -- whether it\u2019s -- from the politicians and\nthe -- the crookedness, and th -- all that, I\u2019d still rather live here than anywhere else. And\nwe had a choice, and I get very annoyed with Americans that are critical. And I don\u2019t like\nthe American flag being burned, I don\u2019t like this freedom of choice business. I don\u2019t\nmean the abortion issue, I mean freedom of choice of doing things that I -- I don\u2019t think\nthe right thing to do, because I don\u2019t think you have to burn anything to make a\nstatement, but that\u2019s my own opinion. But I am very conscious of the fact that\nhistorically, I wouldn\u2019t like it not to be remembered. Not me, because I\u2019ve been very\nlucky. Even through the war I was lucky, I survived with my parents. A tremen -- All of\nmy aunts, and uncles, and cousins were killed in Auschwitz. I have one cousin, who\u2019s 77,\nwho\u2019s here, who has got his Auschwitz numbers on his arm. He\u2019s married, he has a son, a\nnice Jewish doctor, and has two nice Jewish grandchildren. And he\u2019s assimilated, totally,\nsometimes excessively, and it\u2019s really interesting, cause I asked him to donate his\nAuschwitz uniform, and he said he wasn\u2019t ready to part with it. On the other hand, he\nlived next door to some people who had a swastika hanging 1n their house. So -- And he\nalso went overboard joining -- I probably shouldn\u2019t say this on tape, case he listens to it --\na very non-Jewish club, who now has been kind enough to admit some Jews, but I\nwouldn\u2019t deal too well with that, if I\u2019m not welcome, it\u2019s okay. I mean, it\u2019s not okay, but\nI wouldn\u2019t want to make a statement. But that\u2019s how he\u2019s dealt with it. He\u2019s got his own\ndemons, probably much worse than mine, cause his mother died in Auschwitz. So, you\ncan\u2019t really be critical of what other people, you know, do, and how people deal with it.\nBut I think -- Well first of all, this Hidden Children thing just happened, so --",
        "A: I guess about five years ago, and there was an article in a New York magazine, and it\nwas getting a lot of publicity, it was going to be like maybe a couple of hundred people or\nsomething, were going to gather at the Marriott Marquis Hotel, and my daughter called\nme and told me about it. And she said, how come I\u2019m not going? I said, \u201cWell, I really\nhadn\u2019t thought about it, what am I going to do there?\u201d And it was Memorial Day\nweekend, and we were invited out to the Hamptons, which sounded like a much better\nthing to do. Then the more I read about it, and the more I thought about it, I said, you\nknow, I think I\u2019m going to go. And I said to my husband, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to the Hamptons,\nand I\u2019Il come back for the one day out of the two, and you stay, and that\u2019s that.\u201d Well, he\ncame back with me, and I only went for one day. And I went early in the morning, and by\nlunchtime I called him, and I said, \u201cCome. Elie Wiesel is speaking in the evening,\u201d and\nyou know, and he did. And it was really a very interesting experience for me. And one of\nmy friends who, at that first meeting, said I was like the Pollyanna of the group, saying\nthe war was wonderful, and I had a lovely childho -- and all of a sudden, you know, some\nthings that weren\u2019t so wonderful came out somewhere along the way, which I wasn\u2019t\neven aware of. So I guess, you know, something is definitely there, and I -- I don\u2019t know\nif it\u2019s my personality or what, that likes to think the glass is half full, as opposed to half\nempty. But it is definitely important that the museum is there. We went to the one in\nSouth Beach, which is really a wonderful -- a-and then, you know, sometimes, people\nhave said an awful lot of money is going to all these buildings, and all of this stuff, you\nknow, isn\u2019t there better ways of spending the money, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure. But I\nthink the only way to possibly avoid it, or to teach children in this crazy world, when you\nhear about all these shootings at schools, and stuff, it\u2019s a nightmare. But I\u2019m not sure that\nit\u2019s -- goes to the right people. You know, it\u2019s -- I remember years ago, having meetings,\nand chairing a meeting, and giving a lecture to the people that are there, about not being\nlate. But the people that were there, were there. The people that were that late, didn\u2019t hear\nmy complaining, so I\u2019m not sure that the people who are going to do terrible things, are\ngoing to go to the Holocaust Museum, listen to these tapes, and say, \u201cWell, you know, we\ndid terrible things to these people, maybe we won\u2019t do this.\u201d So, I don\u2019t know.\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: She claims I didn\u2019t in the beginning, and it\u2019s really interesting, cause that\u2019s something\nthat\u2019s come up a lot at these Hidden Children meetings, about some daughters who said\ntheir parents talked too much, and other daughters who said their parents didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t\nfor a long time, and she teases me about it. I had all these pictures, after the war, that\nwere taken, and I don\u2019t know why, but it was just sort of something that came up from\ntime to time, and I always told her that when she was older, I would show it to her. There\nwere all these dead bodies, all over the place, that were being shoveled up to be buried 1-\nin the back of the synagogue, cause they couldn\u2019t be identified, and -- and there were just\na lot of bodies all over the place that -- when we came back into Budapest, cause we were\nin hiding outside, and so I remember all these bodies and stuff, and shortly after we came\nback, they were hanging people. And you know, this -- these were all documented, and\nno, I didn\u2019t want to show her the pictures, for a long time. I\u2019m not sure whether they were\nupsetting for me, or whether I thought that she\u2019d be upset. I don\u2019t know. I did take her to\na couple of movies, when she was like a young teenager, that were, I guess I thought age\nappropriate, and that she could handle. And it\u2019s interesting, because my -- I\u2019ve changed.\nYou know, now I feel if the people that were victims could handle it, you know, children\nshould be able to handle it, too. I certainly started younger with my grandson. I don\u2019t --\nyou know, I don\u2019t know. I guess timing. With my grandson, I was at the train station,\nwaiting for somebody, and he put out his right hand like Heil, Hitler, and it really freaked\nme out, totally. And so -- I mean, he was little, maybe four, five years old. So I kind of\nkneeled -- you know, bent down, at his level, I said, \u201cAdam, why did you do that?\u201d And\nhe said, \u201cWell, I just had seen that in \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, yeah,\nthat\u2019s what they did,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I have to tell you a story.\u201d And I said, \u201cIf you\nremember the story, some of those soldiers were the bad guys. And this was this guy,\nAdolf,\u201d anyhow, and I said, you know, \u201cI don\u2019t really want you to do that, that\u2019s not a\nsalute that 1s appropriate.\u201d I don\u2019t know what words I used, I was really kind of emotional\nabout it. So then he said, \u201cWill you tell me other stories about what happened to you?\u201d\nAnd I did, and actually at the Hidden Children, there was some wonderful books, and I\nhad gotten some. And I read some to him, and then, subsequently he, you know, read\n\u201cAnne Frank\u201d and all the other Holocaust related stories. But now, it\u2019s become like a\njoke, every time I give him a book, I say, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not about the Holocaust.\u201d",
        "A: That\u2019s an interesting question. I\u2019m very glad it\u2019s there. I wouldn\u2019t want to live there,\nand it has nothing -- it has -- I was going to say it has nothing to do with me, but that\u2019s\nnot quite right, that\u2019s a flip answer. I\u2019m not as committed to it being my homeland as\nsome people. I think we\u2019re very lucky, as American Jews, that Israel is there, it\u2019s -- to\nlean on. But it\u2019s not a place I want to live in. I don\u2019t feel that because I\u2019m Jewish, I have\nto be there. It\u2019s not a place, certainly, my parents chose, like a lot of people after the war,\nthat -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think of it in terms of my homeland. Maybe I should. Maybe\nthat\u2019s where all the Jews belong, I don\u2019t know. I mean, we were perfectly happy being\nHungarian Jews. Did you ever see a movie called, \u201cShip of Fools\u2019?

        "A: I -- That\u2019s -- That\u2019s just a -- a coincident, it\u2019s really funny, because I\u2019m not a\nRepublican, but when we were in Washington with Adam and Peter -- this was a cut out,\nand when we went back, we were trying to find a Clinton cut out, but we couldn\u2019t find it.\nBut it looks so realistic that people actually have come and said, \u201cWhat are you doing\nwith the Bushes?\u201d And I say it was just, you know, the kids got a kick out of it, and it\u2019s\namazing how real it is. There\u2019s one picture on the piano, it\u2019s right up front, near the\nBushes. That\u2019s my mother, my father, my Uncle Leslie and me as a baby. Do you see it?\nYeah, that old fashioned one, yeah. And that was in Europe in our living room. Yeah, that\nwas my Uncle Leslie, who came here in \u201941, and he was 20 something, and immediately\njoined the American army, and was in Italy during the invasion, and then came to\nBudapest before he headed back. And it\u2019s his wife -- well, he died, my uncle died about\nfive years ago, that was my mother\u2019s brother. And his wife 1s the one I\u2019m very friendly\nwith.",
        "A: No, I did. That\u2019s another thing I did when I used to be smart. I -- I\u2019ve thought about\nactually taking lessons again. But we just had two couples over for dinner the other night,\nand we played the piano, it was just wonderful. My grandchildren play the piano. And\nwhen we got the apartment -- a very good friend of mine sold us the apartment, and she\nsaid, \u201cThis living room is so big, what are you going to do?\u201d I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t got a\nclue,\u201d cause I had all this furniture from my other apartment that I used, and she, being a\ngood real estate lady says, you know, she was just selling an apartment, a woman who\nwas moving out of a big apartment, she wants to sell her piano. That\u2019s how I got the\npiano, so I could put my grandchildren\u2019s pictures on it.",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Mm. I think I would like to go, at some point. I\u2019ve never been to Prague, which is not\nthe same thing, but a lot of it has to do -- well, choices, and timing, because -- but the last\n-- when we were in Budapest the last time, we went with Adam, and I didn\u2019t want to go\nto another eastern European country, which is -- I was in -- like in the neighborhood. And\nthen there have been a couple of, you know, Jewish congress, and UJA kind of stuff, that\nalways has that. And I think I\u2019ve mixed feelings about it. I don\u2019t know how I feel about\nit.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I felt very -- combination of this 1s where I\u2019m from, to this is a strange place, all at the\nsame time. Because again, we\u2019re talking 50 some years ago, so just like New York, on\nthe west side where I grew up, doesn\u2019t look anything like -- Lincoln Center wasn\u2019t\nanywhere near anything, you know, so I mean, just by nature of growth, and -- things\nchange. My apartment looked pretty shabby from the outside. There was still a lot of\nbullet -- you know, bomb sh-shrapnel things in the buildings. The city is beautiful, and\nwhen we were looking out the window at night, we had a -- we stayed at the\nintercontinental, overlooking the Danube River, it\u2019s a beautiful, beautiful city, and it used\nto be called the Paris of the Danube. And all the royalty used to visit, and these shopping\nstreets, like Madison Avenue, 1s -- was a beautiful, beautiful street. It\u2019s pretty crummy\nnow. Has a lot of is -- American chain store, McDonalds, you know, and all that kind of\nstuff. It\u2019s -- The city\u2019s a little tacky, and sad looking, you know, but it\u2019s -- physically it\u2019s\na beautiful city. I was very moved at the synagogue. The last time we were there, 20\nsome years ago, you -- it wasn\u2019t even opened. So that is changed a lot. And there a lot of\nAmericans, including Tony Curtis, and the Louder family, who have given a lot of money\nto restore the synagogue. And they\u2019ve re -- all the furniture has been re-done, you know,\nall the benches, and pews. And all the names were taken off, in order to re-polish the\nfurniture. So I spoke to the guy who was sort of escorting school groups around. And I\nsaid, \u201cMy grandfather, and my father, and my uncle, and mother, they all had their\nnametags -- you know, their nameplates here.\u201d So he said, \u201cGive me their names.\u201d And\nhe said, \u201c\u201cCome to the back,\u201d there\u2019s a little room in the back. And in old shoeboxes, in\nalphabetical order, he pulls out my grandfather\u2019s, my father\u2019s, my mother\u2019s, and my\nuncle. That\u2019s whose son is here, as a survivor of Auschwitz. So I made a donation to the\nsynagogue, and they put them on like little wooden plaques -- wooden pieces, they didn\u2019t\ndo such a good job, but it was very nice of them to do that. And I brought it home, and I\ngave my mother\u2019s, my father\u2019s, my gr-grandfather\u2019s to my mother, and I gave my uncle\u2019s\nto my cousin. We did have a choice of putting it back there. I\u2019m not sure why I bought\nthem with me. They were selling, you know, new people now, raising money for the\nsynagogue. I don\u2019t know why, I just wa -- I ge -- I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019m not sure\nwhether I shouldn\u2019t have just had them put it back, you know, on the -- on the pews, or\nwhat they had planned to do. But when they had them in the back, and they said, \u201cWould\nyou like them?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I would.\u201d So that was quite moving, and Adam was quite\nimpressed, moved, whatever. And we bought some Judaica there. So --",
        "A: I would have liked to be there for a Friday night service, but we weren\u2019t.",
        "A: No, not regularly. We do, but not, you know -- I mean, not as a regular thing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t really give it a lot of thought. When they found them, I just\nthought that -- I didn\u2019t think my mother would ever go back. I just thought she would like\nto have them, cause she was -- has all this stuff. And my cousin actually goes back to\nvisit. All those last living relatives just died, and Europeans are very big on cemeteries, so\nthey always go visit cemeteries. I don\u2019t know why I brought it back. I really -- I mean, it\nwasn\u2019t something I thought about doing or going to get, or anything else, it was just -- I\nexpected to see them on the s -- on the pews, and my mother sat upstairs. That\u2019s --",
        "A: About what?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s sort of interesting, and it\u2019s a contradiction. Had it not been for\nthe Hidden Children, had it not been for the fact that I\u2019m conscious of this last generation,\nand probably my grandchildren, it would have been something of the past. But the past is\na very important part of your whole being, and you can\u2019t just totally file it away. What\nimpact it will have on the future, I no -- I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m going through a stage, I\ndon\u2019t know if because it\u2019s my mother, that I feel very vulnerable about it being sort of the\nlast chapter, you know. I used to think I was young, and I used to think I was middle-\naged, and now I think, you know, the senior, and AARP, and all that, it\u2019s like a whole\nother chapter, and I\u2019ve never lied about my age, so it\u2019s not a matter of saying I\u2019m\nyounger than I am, but I think I have a little problem acknowledging that I\u2019m not in my\n40\u2019s, I think I\u2019m stuck in my 40\u2019s. But I\u2019ve had the discussion with my daughter, and she\nsays she\u2019s stuck in her 20\u2019s, so that kind of works, cause she\u2019s having a problem thinking\nthat she\u2019s in her 40\u2019s. And she\u2019s got exactly the same lines that I have. And I guess that\u2019s\ngenetic, you know? So, I just would like to think -- not even wish, I don\u2019t know, think\nthat the next generation doesn\u2019t have any of this to deal with. I think historically, almost\nevery generation has had a horrendous war, or something that\u2019s beyond their control.\nWhether it was a civil war movement, or World War One, or Two, or lost someone in\nKorea, Vietnam. This was a little different, and my daughter, my grandchildren are quite\ninvolved in this Kosovo, which I probably think is as close as you can get. And it-it\u2019s so\nsad that with all of the talk, and the political statements, that the bottom line is, there\u2019s\nnothing anybody can do, it\u2019s like a -- it\u2019s like a chain reaction. I mean, thousands of\npeople are dying. And with all the stuff that\u2019s going there, it\u2019s still going on, and nobody\ncan stop it. So, it\u2019s hard to be philosophical, because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s sort of -- it\u2019s empty words,\nyou know. This is what happened. I would like it not to happen. That\u2019s not very\nprofound, but I can\u2019t think of anything more. I\u2019ve been lucky, that\u2019s -- I guess that\u2019s a\ngood way to end, because I think I been lucky because in my life, the war could have\nbeen much worse. I had -- could have had more serious losses. I could have been in\ncamps, which were more serious. And I\u2019m also lucky that my life after the war turned out\nto be a nice, and a good life. And I\u2019m very grateful for that.",
        "A: Yes, there most certainly were. Not -- Not only was there a class of -- a money class,\nbut definitely religion. And -- I mean in -- in the Yorkville section of -- of New York, you\ncan see the Hungarian Catholics, and the Hungarian Jews, and the Hungarian Protestants.\nAnd -- And the people that became friendly with each other were the people that were of\nthe same class in Europe, and never the twain shall meet. In Hungarian, there are three --\noh God, I really am losing it now. It\u2019s not the -- like in France, there\u2019s -- do you speak\nFrench?",
        "A: Tu, and vous?",
        "A: What do you call that?",
        "A: Formal, informal. In Hungarian there\u2019s a third one. It gets very complicated. The\ninformal would be like, to very good friends or children. The formal would be to\nteachers, and parents, and all of that. Then there\u2019s a third one that you would speak to --\nwith lower class or upper class. I mean, I can\u2019t describe it to you, but like a housekeeper\nwould use a different way of speaking to, than -- and so -- and that still exists, and it\u2019s\nvery interesting, because people will remain in that category of behavior, and it\u2019s not that\n-- anything that\u2019s expected or -- or anything 1n today\u2019s world, but it still exists. And my\nparents, and a lot of their friends, that -- some people they met here, some people they\nknew from Europe, they came here -- they came here maybe with a little bit of money\nbecause they had visas where there was visitors, or perman -- mostly visitors, and then\nthey applied for a permanent, and eventually became citizens. But 80 or 90 percent of my\nmother\u2019s friends became majorly, majorly successful. Speaking with accents, not\nspeaking very good English, and a lot of them became import, export business, in the toy\nbuilding, and the gift building. Some attorneys went back to school. There was a\nHungarian Jewish doctor\u2019s association. Not Hungarian Catholic, Hungarian Jewish. And\nI\u2019m sure there was another one also. But they were very class conscious on every -- on\nevery level. And then the next group of people that came, it was 1956, and that was\nreferred to as the 1956, as those people really came with just the clothes on their back,\nbecause they were escaping after the revolution. And even some of those people have\ndone extremely well. So, especially the Jews that came to this country, the educated Jews,\nhad a tremendous thirst for success again, and most of -- a businessman is a businessman,\nif he can sell that, he can sell this. And that\u2019s exactly what -- what happened. I mean,\nhistorically, even in -- even in government, I mean, there\u2019s some Hungarians, and for a\nlittle country, that\u2019s amazing, to be prominent people on Wall Street, and in business, and\npolitics, that have come out of it, so --",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. But on the other hand, I\u2019m not poor, you know. I -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s a different world\ntoday, so it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- I was much more aware of it there than I am here. I have friends\nthat are -- have much more than I, and I have friends that have much less. But I think --\nand this is probably true everywhere, I mean, people seem to put you in -- into a box,\nbecause of where you live, the car you drive, whatever it is you do, you know? So it\u2019s\nsort of hard to get away from it. Do I pick people? No, that way, because of class. But the\nbehavior of the European class system is very different than it is here. And it probably --\nmaybe not so much now, but I think it probably still exists a little bit.",
        "A: No, no. I only speak English.",
        "A: No, no. No, that I definitely don\u2019t do.",
        "A: Yes. I work there as a volunteer.",
        "A: Yeah, just as a mem -- membership, I try to get people to join. I --",
        "A: We sit at the desk, yeah, and tell people where to go, have dinner, where to park their\ncar, where the Guggenheim is, how to take the subway, you know. And just schmooze\nwith them, and hope to sell a -- a membership. The difference w -- I was just thinking\nwhat you said about class, the big difference is, in Europe, where they came from, and\ntheir breeding from before is of equal importance. Here, that\u2019s not the case. I -- Maybe to\nsome people, but you meet people usually on an equal footing, and whether they came\nfrom a poor background or a rich background is -- doesn\u2019t become an issue 1n the\nfriendship, where as it does in Europe. I think probably where you came from is more\nimportant than how much money you have. I think -- maybe this is my generalization, but\nI think here, money is more important. I think in Europe, at least I had that sense, that\nyour background, or your education was more important than -- money couldn\u2019t buy you\ninto places in Europe. It can here. That\u2019s -- So there\u2019s a different, I mean, it\u2019s probably\nthe same thing, but they come from a different approach.",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "A: Yeah, I mean, I'd like -- I don\u2019t like to think I think about it either way, but it exists,\nbecause it\u2019s -- I was just telling somebody the other day that it\u2019s amazing how if you\nmeet somebody, and they go to an Ivy League school -- I mean, we\u2019re talking people in\ntheir 50\u2019s, 60\u2019s, and 70\u2019s, how, before the end of the evening, somehow or other, they\nwill mention having gone to Harvard or Princeton. And, you know, that was a while\nback. They don\u2019t mention city college. So, it still is important to whoever it\u2019s important\nto.",
        "A: Oh, over 10 years.",
        "A: Yeah. Actually probably mo -- a little more.",
        "A: Yes, definitely. I think actually I -- I should be doing more than I am right now. I used\nto do much more, but I didn\u2019t mention, but we spend our winter in the Caribbean, and so\nwe -- we\u2019re away so much, that every time I sort of get involved, I don\u2019t like to volunteer,\nand not take that as seriously as if I had a paying job, so I don\u2019t like to pop in and pop\nout. So, when I started this, it was with the understanding that I can my slot back, and I\ncan be replaced for the three months. But then, I do take it very seriously. Cause we\u2019re\naway during the summer, and I come in for my spot every week. But I think it\u2019s -- giving\nback is -- is important.",
        "A: Connecticut.",
        "A: Saint Thomas. But that\u2019s really -- I mean, it sounds pretty good, and it\u2019s not bad, but\nmy husband\u2019s business is in Saint Thomas. He used to live there full time, we used to live\nthere full time for awhile. So when we\u2019re there, he has an office, and -- and most of his\nbusiness is in the Caribbean. And it\u2019s a nice place, my grandchildren come to visit.\n"
