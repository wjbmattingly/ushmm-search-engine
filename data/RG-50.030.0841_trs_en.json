        "A: I went to Plaszow.",
        "Q: Okay. [break] Okay, so could you read off \u2014 could you tell me about the various\ncamps, and what you remember from each, okay\u2019?",
        "A: Well, after Minsk, we were transported to Lublin, Reichsdorf(ph), Plaszow,\n[indecipherable]. And I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember what we did there.\nThen we went to Flossenbirg.",
        "Q: In Germany itself?",
        "A: In Germany, that\u2019s in Bavaria, and I remember it was \u2014 it\u2019s deep down in the\nvalley, the building. I \u2014 I remember that we had to get up at four o\u2019clock, 4:30 in the\nmorning, naked. Had to stand outside for two hours to be counted. And they always\nsaid, if somebody\u2019s missing, we\u2019re going to shoot so many people.",
        "Q: Did that happen?",
        "A: No, it did not happen, not that I remember. So that\u2019s when I \u2014 in Flossenbirg.\nThen we went to Kolyma. There we worked for \u2014 there we worked for airplane piet\n\u2014 pieces, to make parts for the airplane, I remember that. That was very difficult.\nThen there was a\u2014 I remember there was a \u2014 a Frenchman, he worked there, he wasOctober 8, 2015\nnot an inmate. He gave me, once in a while, piece of bread. He had an apple. And I\nwrote to him after World War II, until he died. His name was Mr. Parmentier(ph).\nOkay. Then we went to Obus(ph), I don\u2019t remember anything about Obus(ph).\nThen we went to Sachsenhausen, Oranienburg.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s close \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s in Berlin.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Near Berlin. And I have to go back for a moment. In 1939, you probably know,\nthat they had the Crystal Night in Germany.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about that.",
        "A: They had the Crystal Night, and they picked up my father, and all the Jews in\nHamburg, and he was sent to \u2014 he was sent to \u2014",
        "Q: Sachsenhausen\u2019?",
        "A: Sachsenhausen. I think he was there for two months. And when he came home,\nhe said to my mother, he had to sign a piece of paper not to talk what he saw, and he\nwhat \u2014 what \u2014 he never talked about it. And then we went to Braunschweig, I don\u2019t\nremember much there either.",
        "Q: What about Sachsenhausen? Do you have any memories of Sachsenhausen?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 that was Oranienburg, Sachsenhausen.October 8, 2015",
        "Q: Yeah. Do you have memories of being there, and \u2014",
        "A: Well, yes. I don\u2019t know if I should \u2014 we had to stay again outside in the morning,\nnaked. And one guy was counting us. He was gay. And he looked at me, he told me\nto come forward, towards him. I did, and he asked me if I want to work wi \u2014 or get\na \u2014 work with him, get a job, it\u2019s called kapo. You heard of kapos?",
        "Q: Tell me who they were.",
        "A: Yes. So I liked the idea, and I didn\u2019t like the idea because I felt I was so young,\nand I should tell other people who are much older than I am, to go and do this, and\ndo that, and \u2014 and [indecipherable] \u2014 I thought it was not my place to do. But I did\nit. So that\u2019s that. And then we come to Neuengamme. | can\u2019t remember which, to\nbe honest with you, it was one of the ca \u2014 one of the camps\u2019 barracks. There was\nsome gay people again. They said the Nazis are going to come any moment.\nThey\u2019re going to \u2014 they\u2019re going to go through the barracks. And they put us in the\nattic, Edgar and me, they put us in the attic, and I was there for several hours. So, if\nthey would have come, they probably would have picked us and kill us. So they sa \u2014\nthat\u2019s why I\u2019m always very thankful to them. They were very good to me that way.",
        "Q: So, there were other prisoners who told you about that, and they \u2014 and that meant\nthat they hid you in the attic? Is that \u2014October 8, 2015",
        "A: They hid me in the attic, yes, but I can\u2019t remember which one it was. And now\nwe come almost to the end. They took us on the train, and then they put us in\nFlensburg, which is very north of Germany.",
        "Q: Near Denmark, I believe.",
        "A: Yes. And they put us on a\u2014 on a ship, on a freighter \u2014 freighter type ship. Not \u2014\nwe didn\u2019t know what they had in mind. They actually had in mind to sink the ship.\nAnd I have a book, a German book where another man was on the ship, and he\nknows the name of the ship \u2014 I don\u2019t know the name of the ship \u2014 but they didn\u2019t\nhave time to do that because the American came already, so they were fleeing the\nNazis. And we saw in the distance, we saw tiny, little boats coming from Sweden.\nThe Red Cross came and took us down.",
        "Q: Out of the boat, out of the ship.",
        "A: Out of the boat, and saved us. I was brought to Sweden. I was already \u2014 and the\nwar ended se-seven of May, I think, \u201945.",

        "A: I was already free on the seven of May. I was already in Sweden.",
        "Q: So \u2014 you were in Sweden, so when they put you on that ship, was that early\nMay, or was that late April?\nOctober 8, 2015",
        "A: That was \u2014 that must have been early May. Early May, and I think some people\n\u2014 yeah, there were some Germans still on it. They asked me, and I said I\u2019m Polish. I\n\u2014I couldn\u2019t dare \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t dare to say I was Jewish. My friend didn\u2019t look\nJewish either. He also said, I\u2019m Polish. Well, they know we didn\u2019t have any papers,\nso they had to believe us.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable] what I\u2019m telling you.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I mean that\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s much more to it than this, but \u2014",
        "Q: Would you like to tell me a little bit more?",
        "A: I just \u2014 I just really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to make mistake. We were put in\nquarantine in Sweden \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 for several months. And then, during the day, we could go in the courtyard.\nThere were hundreds of people every day, from the streets, people asking questions.\nRefugees who left Germany or other parts of Europe. Have you seen my \u2014 you\nwere in Minsk, have you seen my brother, have you seen my sister, and so on, you\nknow. So one \u2014 some woman said to me, have you seen my brother? I said, yes,\nI\u2019ve seen him. I hate to tell you, but he was \u2014 he was killed. His name was\nOctober 8, 2015\nHorowitz(ph), Hugo Horowitz(ph). So she said, would you visit me after you\ncome out of this quarantine? I said yeah, I will do that. But in the meantime, they\ncalled them lottas(ph), those Swedish \u2014 they work for the Red Cross, I guess, the\ntype \u2014 that type. She insisted that I go to \u2014 go to her house. She had five sons. She\nsaid one \u2014 she said one more or less doesn\u2019t make any difference. I was with them\nfor two \u2014 for several months. They were very good to me. Very, very good. Lovely\npeople.",
        "Q: So this was in Sweden?",
        "A: In Sweden, in Helsingborg. This took place in Helsingborg. In the meantime, I\nvisit this Jewish lady for \u2014 from Hamburg. I visit her, and we became friends, and I\nwent to America, we kept in touch. We became very, very close. They wanted\nadopt \u2014 they wanted to adopt me, but I didn\u2019t want to change my name. Their name\nwere Liebentowski(ph). Liebentowski(ph) had a relative. You probably can find\nthat in the Jewish museum. [indecipherable] music. You will find that in some\nbooks, Jewish books, his name, Liebentowski(ph).",
        "Q: Liebentowski(ph).",
        "A: That was his cousin, I guess.",
        "Q: And they were from Hamburg, and they had wanted to kind of take you in and\nadopt you. Were they also going to the United States?\nOctober 8, 2015",
        "A: I visit them \u2014 I promised them that I would never leave this country. I wasn\u2019t\nhappy in this country.",
        "Q: In the United States?",
        "A: No. I found everything very strange. I always heard money, money, money. I\nalways heard money. I thought it was so strange to me, the word money. But we c \u2014\nwe \u2014 I visit them all the time. I moved away from San Diego to San Francisco, and\nI visit them every year, two or three times. They came to me. In 1953, I met a\ngentleman from Slovenia. He also was in concentration camp, several camps, many\ncamps, and \u2014",

        "Q: Had he been in camps because \u2014 had he been arrested \u2014",
        "A: We had so much \u2014 we had so much in common. We had the same ambitions, we\nwanted to live nice, peaceful, and we built even a house in San Francisco, it\u2019s still\nstanding. Nice home.",
        "Q: Can we cut, just for a second? [break] Gary, you mentioned \u2014 you mentioned\nsome of the episodes that you went through, and I want to ask you now about some\nmuch more personal things, and I \u2014 I apologize in advance for the prying that this\ninvolves. But I think \u2014 the reason why I am doing so, is so that people in the future\nwould have a much clearer sense of exactly what kind of danger, what kind of\nsuffering people went through when they had no power, when they were completely\nhelpless. So, if we could start with this incident when you were in Sachsenhausen,\nand someone pulled you aside. What did that entail? This man pulled you aside, he\nwas a kapo, is that correct?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 when he looked at me, and I looked at him, I knew exactly \u2014 I was \u2014\nmy instinct told me, I knew exactly what it meant, right then and there, I knew that.",
        "Q: And what did it mean? What did it mean?\nOctober 8, 2015",
        "A: Well, it meant that he wanted to, if I like it or not, I have to sleep with him. I\nhave to have \u2014",
        "Q: I understand.",
        "A: And I did this for several weeks.",
        "Q: Was this \u2014",
        "A: Several weeks, as long as I was in that camp.",
        "Q: Was this the first time something like that \u2014",

        "Q: Not before.",
        "A: No, not before, no.",
        "Q: So in other words, it\u2019s your first sexual experience.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And it happens in this way?",
        "A: Yes. I had another I\u2019d a \u2014 it was not a sexual experience, when we were in ru \u2014\nin Russia.",
        "Q: Okay.October 8, 2015",
        "A: We went out to some \u2014 someplace in the country. Was some big building, I don\u2019t\nknow, was \u2014 was to work some \u2014 something there, and I \u2014 I walked away a little bit\nfrom \u2014 from the building, I was all by myself, standing by a tree. And out of the\nblue skies came a soldier, German soldier. And he looked me deep in the eyes, and\nhe said \u2014 he said to me, you want to get away from all this? You want to go ma \u2014 go\nwith me? And I hesitated of course, I said yes, no, yes, no. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing I\ndidn\u2019t do that, because I probably would be \u2014 we probably both would be caught,\nand would be shot. So that was another experience and that \u2014 gay experience.",

        "A: This man\u2019s name was Hoffman(ph), or \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t remember. So\nEdgar \u2014 but Edgar was not mad at all for this. And so one day he didn\u2019t want to do\nit, so this Hoffman(ph) took all his clothes away, stripped him completely of his\nclothes, he had no clothes, he could not get out of \u2014 out of the barrack. He could\nnot, and he cried. And he cried and he cried and he cried. So \u2014 and he\u2019s a little\nsmaller and \u2014 than me, and \u2014",

        "A: I just \u2014 I just did from day to day, that\u2019s what you do. You cannot think of\ntomorrow, or day after tomorrow. You\u2019re just so \u2014 I can\u2019t believe it, to be honest\nwith you, I think about it night and day. I can\u2019t believe it today, that this happened,\nthat this happened, this whole thing.

        "A: Yeah. We went to \u20141999, we \u2014 we \u2014 we went to Nice. We liked Nice. We went\nthere three or four times. He got very excited one day in a store the last time.\nSomebody pushed themself in front of us. He got red in the face, I'll never forget it.\nOctober 8, 2015\nScreamed at her. He said, you\u2019re like the ger \u2014 like the Germans, the Germans do\nthat. So next day was a special holiday in Nice. I can\u2019t \u2014 you probab \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhat holiday it was. It was a Sunday, too. We had breakfast, then we went for a\nwalk. And all of a sudden, he said, I can\u2019t walk any more. So I leaned him against\nthe wall, and then I saw a hotel. I managed to get him to the hotel, drank water, then\nwe took a taxi back to the ho-hotel where we stayed, and called a doctor. And\ndoctor \u2014 and Anton was in pajama, laid on top of the bed. Couldn\u2019t find peace,\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t stay put in one position. And the doctor came, opened the hotel\ndo-door to the room, the door. And I had a gold \u2014 gold watch on, hundred dollar\nwatch. He said, oh, you have a beautiful watch on. I thought, uh-oh, that\u2019s the\nwrong doctor. I\u2019m sure that be the wrong doctor. So he examined him. He said, I\ngive him a shot. He be okay in two hours. It was the worst thing he could have\ndone. In two hours he got up, he said \u2014 I said, I\u2019m going to call your friend in\nYugoslavia, you talk to him. And I dialed the number, and he just \u2014 he just slumped\nover. And I \u2014 I caught him real quick, and I was holding him, I \u2014 he probably\ndoesn\u2019t know any more. He probably was already gone.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s how you lost him?",
        "A: So then I\u2014 I wrote a nasty note to the doctor, I said, I\u2019m gonna sue you.\nSomething is \u2014 something is wrong here. Then I went to here, and somebody, a\nOctober 8, 2015\nnurse, and I showed her what the doctor did. She said, that was the wrong thing to\ndo. He could have lived. He had a heart attack. He needed to be rushed to the\nhospital.",
        "Q: Oh dear.",
        "A: So that\u2019s how he died.",
        "Q: What a bitter end.",
        "A: And then they were so cruel. When he was laying in the bed, there were so many\npeople around him, I don\u2019t know what, and I was way back. He had a big cross\nhere, a golden cross. They ripped that off and stole it. They stole that. I mean,\nthey\u2019re awful. And then I couldn\u2019t get the ashes, I had to wait seven months \u2014 six\nmonths I had to wait for the ash-ashes. They said they were \u2014 that their crematorium\nor the funeral parlor was bankrupt, or something. I got the ashes sitting here. I don\u2019t\nbelieve it\u2019s his ashes. I don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s just a tiny little thing, like that.",
        "Q: Anton, had he been arrested? Why was he 1n concentration camps?",
        "A: Why was he in concentration camps, that\u2019s a good question. It has something to\ndo with Tito. Tito was after the students, I believe. I think the students were\nrevolting, many years ago. Do you know anything about it?",
        "Q: So he was not ar \u2014 he was not arrested by the Nazis, he was arrested by the\ncommunists?October 8, 2015",

They were hitting\npeople in the back because they didn\u2019t run fast enough to the trucks, sitting on the\nother side of the street. They were covered trucks.

Then \u2014 then they announced again, over the speaker, we need so\nmany volunteers to go inside the building and clean up. What happened was, they\nhad Russian Jews living in there before, and wa \u2014 and then when the announcement\ncame that German Jews are coming, they killed all those Russian Jews.

And what they did, the food was so bad, they gave\nus soup, it was like barley soup. They put \u2014 you ever heard \u2014 it\u2019s called in German,\nthey put saltpeter in the \u2014 in this soup. That means that they want to make men\nsterile, they didn\u2019t want that they have sex. They didn\u2019t want to have more babies,\nor anything like that. That was the start with that. And then a piece of bread, like a\npiece of pie, the shape. And maybe a little margarine or butter, something like that.\nSo, what people did when they got their luggage \u2014 if they got their luggage, many\npeople didn\u2019t get their luggage \u2014 they would take what \u2014 the belongings they had,\nthey would go with something to the Russian, where the Russian concentration\ncamp was.",

They said to me, you \u2014 you stay \u2014 you are here.\nMy mother over here, more women with her. My father over there with other men.\nAnd then they said to us, turn around. We had to turn around, and I saw in the\ndistance cattle cars. Cattle cars were waiting for us. I went in the cattle car, I saw a\nlittle straw on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the floor, and I saw one pail. One pail for so many\npeople. We could \u2014 we were just like this, we could not \u2014 we could hardly bend to \u2014October 8, 2015\nto sit down, you know, [indecipherable].

        "A: And neither one is \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 salvation. Neither one. No. And my mother was very \u2014 you know, everybody\u2019s\nvaluable, any human life. She was very educated, she played the violin. She wasOctober 8, 2015\nvery musical. Sh-She loved opera like me \u2014 like I do, I inherit all that. She liked art,\nshe liked ev \u2014 you know. She didn\u2019t know much about Judaism. Only on the high\nholidays, they went to the temple, [indecipherable] temple in Hamburg. That\nbuilding is still standing, too.",

        "A: I went to Plaszow.",
        "A: Well, after Minsk, we were transported to Lublin, Reichsdorf(ph), Plaszow,\n[indecipherable]. And I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember what we did there.\nThen we went to Flossenbirg.",
        "A: In Germany, that\u2019s in Bavaria, and I remember it was \u2014 it\u2019s deep down in the\nvalley, the building. I \u2014 I remember that we had to get up at four o\u2019clock, 4:30 in the\nmorning, naked. Had to stand outside for two hours to be counted. And they always\nsaid, if somebody\u2019s missing, we\u2019re going to shoot so many people.",
        "A: No, it did not happen, not that I remember. So that\u2019s when I \u2014 in Flossenbirg.\nThen we went to Kolyma. There we worked for \u2014 there we worked for airplane piet\n\u2014 pieces, to make parts for the airplane, I remember that. That was very difficult.\nThen there was a\u2014 I remember there was a \u2014 a Frenchman, he worked there, he wasOctober 8, 2015\nnot an inmate. He gave me, once in a while, piece of bread. He had an apple. And I\nwrote to him after World War II, until he died. His name was Mr. Parmentier(ph).\nOkay. Then we went to Obus(ph), I don\u2019t remember anything about Obus(ph).\nThen we went to Sachsenhausen, Oranienburg.",
        "A: That\u2019s in Berlin.",
        "A: Near Berlin. And I have to go back for a moment. In 1939, you probably know,\nthat they had the Crystal Night in Germany.",
        "A: They had the Crystal Night, and they picked up my father, and all the Jews in\nHamburg, and he was sent to \u2014 he was sent to \u2014",
        "A: Sachsenhausen. I think he was there for two months. And when he came home,\nhe said to my mother, he had to sign a piece of paper not to talk what he saw, and he\nwhat \u2014 what \u2014 he never talked about it. And then we went to Braunschweig, I don\u2019t\nremember much there either.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 that was Oranienburg, Sachsenhausen.October 8, 2015",
        "A: Well, yes. I don\u2019t know if I should \u2014 we had to stay again outside in the morning,\nnaked. And one guy was counting us. He was gay. And he looked at me, he told me\nto come forward, towards him. I did, and he asked me if I want to work wi \u2014 or get\na \u2014 work with him, get a job, it\u2019s called kapo. You heard of kapos?",
        "A: Yes. So I liked the idea, and I didn\u2019t like the idea because I felt I was so young,\nand I should tell other people who are much older than I am, to go and do this, and\ndo that, and \u2014 and [indecipherable] \u2014 I thought it was not my place to do. But I did\nit. So that\u2019s that. And then we come to Neuengamme. | can\u2019t remember which, to\nbe honest with you, it was one of the ca \u2014 one of the camps\u2019 barracks. There was\nsome gay people again. They said the Nazis are going to come any moment.\nThey\u2019re going to \u2014 they\u2019re going to go through the barracks. And they put us in the\nattic, Edgar and me, they put us in the attic, and I was there for several hours. So, if\nthey would have come, they probably would have picked us and kill us. So they sa \u2014\nthat\u2019s why I\u2019m always very thankful to them. They were very good to me that way.",
        "A: They hid me in the attic, yes, but I can\u2019t remember which one it was. And now\nwe come almost to the end. They took us on the train, and then they put us in\nFlensburg, which is very north of Germany.",
        "A: Yes. And they put us on a\u2014 on a ship, on a freighter \u2014 freighter type ship. Not \u2014\nwe didn\u2019t know what they had in mind. They actually had in mind to sink the ship.\nAnd I have a book, a German book where another man was on the ship, and he\nknows the name of the ship \u2014 I don\u2019t know the name of the ship \u2014 but they didn\u2019t\nhave time to do that because the American came already, so they were fleeing the\nNazis. And we saw in the distance, we saw tiny, little boats coming from Sweden.\nThe Red Cross came and took us down.",
        "A: Out of the boat, and saved us. I was brought to Sweden. I was already \u2014 and the\nwar ended se-seven of May, I think, \u201945.",
        "A: I was already free on the seven of May. I was already in Sweden.\nOctober 8, 2015",
        "A: That was \u2014 that must have been early May. Early May, and I think some people\n\u2014 yeah, there were some Germans still on it. They asked me, and I said I\u2019m Polish. I\n\u2014I couldn\u2019t dare \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t dare to say I was Jewish. My friend didn\u2019t look\nJewish either. He also said, I\u2019m Polish. Well, they know we didn\u2019t have any papers,\nso they had to believe us.",
        "A: [indecipherable] what I\u2019m telling you.",
        "A: I mean that\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s much more to it than this, but \u2014",
        "A: I just \u2014 I just really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to make mistake. We were put in\nquarantine in Sweden \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for several months. And then, during the day, we could go in the courtyard.\nThere were hundreds of people every day, from the streets, people asking questions.\nRefugees who left Germany or other parts of Europe. Have you seen my \u2014 you\nwere in Minsk, have you seen my brother, have you seen my sister, and so on, you\nknow. So one \u2014 some woman said to me, have you seen my brother? I said, yes,\nI\u2019ve seen him. I hate to tell you, but he was \u2014 he was killed. His name was\nOctober 8, 2015\nHorowitz(ph), Hugo Horowitz(ph). So she said, would you visit me after you\ncome out of this quarantine? I said yeah, I will do that. But in the meantime, they\ncalled them lottas(ph), those Swedish \u2014 they work for the Red Cross, I guess, the\ntype \u2014 that type. She insisted that I go to \u2014 go to her house. She had five sons. She\nsaid one \u2014 she said one more or less doesn\u2019t make any difference. I was with them\nfor two \u2014 for several months. They were very good to me. Very, very good. Lovely\npeople.",
        "A: In Sweden, in Helsingborg. This took place in Helsingborg. In the meantime, I\nvisit this Jewish lady for \u2014 from Hamburg. I visit her, and we became friends, and I\nwent to America, we kept in touch. We became very, very close. They wanted\nadopt \u2014 they wanted to adopt me, but I didn\u2019t want to change my name. Their name\nwere Liebentowski(ph). Liebentowski(ph) had a relative. You probably can find\nthat in the Jewish museum. [indecipherable] music. You will find that in some\nbooks, Jewish books, his name, Liebentowski(ph).",
        "A: That was his cousin, I guess.\nOctober 8, 2015",

But we c \u2014\nwe \u2014 I visit them all the time. I moved away from San Diego to San Francisco, and\nI visit them every year, two or three times. They came to me. In 1953, I met a\ngentleman from Slovenia. He also was in concentration camp, several camps, many\ncamps, and \u2014",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 when he looked at me, and I looked at him, I knew exactly \u2014 I was \u2014\nmy instinct told me, I knew exactly what it meant, right then and there, I knew that.\nOctober 8, 2015",

And out of the\nblue skies came a soldier, German soldier. And he looked me deep in the eyes, and\nhe said \u2014 he said to me, you want to get away from all this? You want to go ma \u2014 go\nwith me? And I hesitated of course, I said yes, no, yes, no. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing I\ndidn\u2019t do that, because I probably would be \u2014 we probably both would be caught,\nand would be shot.
