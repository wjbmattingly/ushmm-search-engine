I must have \u2014 I must have run about three or 400 feet before I ran into my own\nboys and we put him down and tried to get help and of course he was beyond help\nbecause his top of a head was gone. So I had my head fixed and then after war in\nGermany, I got a good German surgeon and he cut it open again and left only a little, tiny\n\u2014 I mean, it was a scar, I\u2019m \u2014 it was enormous scar. So he left only a little, tiny scar there.\nBut I still \u2014 when I take my hat off, I kind of remember that blood running and the whole,\nhorrible, open thing there, just like my top of a head was completely open down to the\nbrains.

        "Q: Okay. This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It\u2019s April 8, 1998. We\u2019re in\nMinneapolis, Minnesota, or nearby. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and it\u2019s\ntape one. And if we could just begin by having you introduce yourself and then also tell\nus where you were born and when.",
        "A: Very well. My name is Stefan Czyzewski. I was born in 1922, in a little town of\nLesnogora, Poland. Lesnogora is in central Poland, about 45 kilometers east of Warsaw.\nIt\u2019s a small hamlet, you cannot even find it on a map, but it\u2019s still there. Last time I wrote\nto somebody there, it still was there.",
        "Q: Tell us what it looked like. What it was like to grow up there?",
        "A: To live there?",
        "Q: To \u2014 in, in Lesnogora.",
        "A: Oh, it was a farm \u2014 a farming community. There was no industry of any kind, just farms.\nThere was one little store, kind of a general store, one room little store, ran by a Jewish\nfamily. The rest of the people were all Polish peasants working on a farm.",
        "Q: And what did your parents do? Maybe tell us their names and what did they do, were you\nfarmers?",
        "A: Yes. My father was Jan Czyzewski, he was a farmer. My mother was Bogumila\nCzyzewski, nee Boruc. My mother was an \u2014 was a schoolteacher. And she was a\nfrustrated schoolteacher. When she married and had a first child, which was me, she\nwould not be hired to work any more. So she was really frustrated. By a time I was three,\nshe taught me how to read and I never stopped. I fell in love with books and I have been\nreading ever since.",
        "Q: What was your family home like? Did you have land? What did your \u2014 just tell us a little\nbit about that, what did your father farm?",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 the farms in that part of Poland were a kind of a variety farm. The land was\nrather poor, so they planted just about everything that they needed and in \u2014 everything\nthey could sell. They planted a lot of cabbage and a plenty of potatoes and some wheat\nand also a lot of rye. Our land was in many little pieces, so we had to travel from a\nvillage to work on, on the land. My father \u2014 just about like me \u2014 spent a lot of time in\nstrange places. The part of Poland that we lived in before 19 \u2014 in \u2014 before 1900\u2019s, were\noccupied by Russia, Czarist Russia. My father was conscripted, or drew a lot and spent\n12 and a half years in Czar\u2019s imperial army. He came back home for six months and the\nfirst war \u2014 world war started. He was called again and did fight on the western front\nagainst \u2014 against Germans. And of course he heard some Polish people speaking across\nthe front lines, so he walked across one night and thought he would join them. Instead of\nthat, they put him in a prisoners of war came \u2014 camp. And they sent him way, way out\nwest, close to the western front line betw \u2014 a li \u2014 a front line between France and\nGermany. And again, well he was \u2014 at that time he was a sapper. He was a fortification\nspecialist. So the Germans gave him a group of people, group of prisoners and they built\nfortifications \u2014 a kind of a front line fortification system at Verdun. And probably\neverybody heard of that horrible battle at Verdun, where more than half a million people\nwere killed. So he did, and the Germans of course, were very appreciative, so he put him\nin a fr \u2014 one morning they put him in a front of a squad that he was in and gave him\nGerman Ritterkreuz* or, or Eisern\u2014Eisernekreuz\u2019 \u2014 German, German decoration,\nbecause the part that he built there \u2014 the French could not overrun it. They tried several\ntime, they couldn\u2019t overrun it. Anyway, a few days later, he heard Polish people speaking\nacross the line on the French side. So he walked across. And the Po \u2014 he joined Polish\nLegion that was fighting on the French side. Couple nights later he led the French into\nthe part of the fortification that he built. They overran it, they kicked the Germans out\n* Knight\u2019s Cross (German)\n* Tron Cross (German)\nand the French gave him the Croix de Guerre*. So he had German decoration, he had\nFrench decoration. Later on, the Polish Legion gave him Virtuti Militari,\u2019 Polish cross.\nSo when my father came back home after the wars, he didn\u2019t brag much about it. As a\nmatter of fact, my family didn\u2019t know about it. I was the only one that he showed the\ncrosses to and he told little about what happened. When he came home, he brought some\nthings. He brought a French army coat and he brought a pair of American army boots.\nAnd he had those boots until 1940\u2019s. They were pair of clodhoppers. They had a big,\nround toes, but he said, \u201cThose are the best boots I ever had.\u201d They were ugly, but he\nsaid, \u201cThey are sewed, they are glued and nailed. You can never wear them out.\u201d\nOccasionally on \u2014 on a big holiday, he would put those boots on and para\u2014 shine them\nand parade around it. And everybody was look and said, \u201cJan, where do you get those\nugly boots?\u201d He said, \u201cYou better shut up, those are American boots, those are the best\nboots I ever had.\u201d",
        "Q: So your father, when you were growing up, would \u2014 would talk with you about his\nmilitary experiences?",
        "A: He talked a blue streak to me, but he would not talk to anybody else. And of course he\ntalked about all the girlfriends he had. The great Russian girlfriend he had. And the great\nGerman girlfriend he had. And of course, he had a great French girlfriend.",
        "Q: Tell us about your siblings. You\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re not an only child. Who else was in the\nfamily?",
        "A: Yes, I had two sist\u2014 I had \u2014 have two sister, who are in their late 60\u2019s or early 70\u2019s. When\nI was arrested, they were a \u2014",
        "Q: Their names, can you tell us?",
        "A: Yes, the older one is Henryka. She is about 71. The younger one is \u2014 or was \u2014 is Eleanor\nor Eleonora. She\u2019s about 68 or 69. When I was arrested, they were like 12 and 14. And\ntwo years ago, they came to visit me. And I said, \u201cWell gee! I left two pretty little girls,\nwhat do I see now? Two old, litthe woman.\u201d And my sister Eleonora is outspoken, she\nsaid, \u201cWho do you think you are? You\u2019re a old, little man.\u201d",
        "Q: What was a regular day like? Did you work with your father? Just describe a regular day\nat your home.\n* War Cross (French)\n> Courageous Soldiers (Latin); Polish medal awarded for courage in the battlefield.",
        "A: We did get up at the sun raise, or before. And we did little work, like taking care of the\nlivestock, feeding the cows, feeding the pigs and watering the horses and preparing. And\nthen of course \u2014 then after that I went to school. And first three years, we had a village\nschool, was a one room village school. Later on I had to walk to the town of Grebkow,\nwhich was our district, little village, which had seven grade school. So my time was spent\nmostly in school. I would walk at seven in morning to get to be \u2014 to be in school by eight\nand I didn\u2019t come home until about three. So then I helped around the farm. And on\nweekend, on Saturday, I would work with father in a field, but on a weekday, I did not.",
        "Q: And what \u2014 what kinds of things did your family do in the community? Wh\u2014Were there\npolitical parties or any kind of small organizations in the village that they took part in?",
        "A: There were political parties, but they were just practically two. There was the Nationalist\nparty, which was very small and hardly anybody joined it because they were kind of\nchauvinistic and there was the so-called \u201cnon-party\u201d party, which was the government\nparty. And most people were kind of \u2014 not exactly joining it, but supporting it, because\nall the politicians and all the representatives were members of that party. There was quite\na lively social life. There were mostly \u2014 mostly religious holidays and feasts that people\ntook part in it. Like for instance, when the month of May came, every night after supper,\neverybody went to a little shrine and they would be singing lot of hymns and they would\nsing a litany to all the saints and then you would walk home and sing loudly. There was a\nfair, one or two or three religious fairs, that special preachers would come to the church\nand we would walk to church and listen to the preachers and there were booths and\nsouvenirs toe \u2014 tables. And food tables, where you would spend little money to get some\nfood that you normally did not eat at home. Well, every Tuesday there was a\nmarketplace, market day. You would \u2014 father would hitch a horse and we\u2019d take some\nbutter and eggs and some grain and some potatoes and drive to Kaluszyn, where the\nmarket took place and the people from a city would \u2014 housewife would come and buy\nyour butter and buy your eggs. And Kaluszyn was a town of about 12,000 people, of\nwhom about 10,000 were Jewish people. Jewish people were merchants, they were\nprofessional, they were attorneys, they were doctors. They were tailors and shoemakers.\nAnd we traded with them throughout our lives. We always had a family or two or three\nthat we\u2019re very friendly with and visited when we went there. We would start their place\nand maybe get a cup of tea. When they came to see us, we would give them a dozen of\neggs and when they came to visit on the farm.",
        "Q: Well, how would you describe the relations in general between Jews and Poles at that\ntime? First maybe think about your village.",
        "A: In our village, there was one Jewish family. It was actually first a Jewish man, only, who\nopened a little \u2014 like a grocery and needles and thimble store. Later on he had a wife and\ntwo children. And relations were not strained. We kind of tolerated one another. All\nPolish Jewish people were Orthodox people. They wore special dress, they had\nsideburns, they had peyse\u2019\u00ae, the long side hair. They wore gabardine coats, they wore little\nhats, with a \u2014 little tiny, black hats with a tot \u2014 little tiny visor. And they spoke very\nbroken Polish.",
        "Q: For instance, did the children go to the school that you went to?",
        "A: The Jewish children would go to public schools that all of us had to go. But, they would\nspend little time there, but most of the time they spent was 1n a cheder. There was a\nJewish cheder, they went and they learned to \u2014 how to write Yiddish and some of them\nwould learn Hebrew. And socially we did not have much to do together. Socially, we\nkept completely apart. We did not mix, or if they did, it was very little mixing between\nthe Jewish people and Polish people.",
        "Q: Did you understand why? Was that ever sort of spoken, or was that just how things were?",
        "A: That\u2019s was how the things were. It was not a \u2014 because one hated one another, but was\nsimply because the things were. People gravitated to their own and they did little\nassociation business-wise and also occasionally visited. For instance, we had had a \u2014 a\nJewish peddlers come. There was a Jewish lady, whose name was Golda, who came\ncarrying a big bag and she was trading. She brought sacharyna\u2019 to sell, she brought\nneedles, she brought thread, she brought little pieces of material. She brought\noccasionally a dress or two. And she would take in \u2014 in exchange, she would take eggs\nand butter and some potatoes and maybe some grain.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit more about your family and it\u2019s religious beliefs. When you were\ngrowing up, how did your parents explain those to you? Wi-Wi \u2014 you know, in church\nand that sort of thing.",
        "A: We took the church for granted. We just went to church on Sundays. We went to\nreligious instructions, which were taking place in public school. Once a week, a priest or\na nun would come and take a \u2014 actually the priest or nun came every day, but took one\nclass, for one hour we received our religious instruction. And we went to special\npreparation like for first communion or confirmation. We would go to church in groups\nthat \u2014 which reached certain age and were prepared. We prayed at home frequently, we\nwould say a rosary. Probably not every day, but at least once a week. And we kids hated\n\u00b0 Earlocks worn by Hasidic Jews (Yiddish)\n\u2019 Saccharine (Polish)\nit because we had to kneel for about 45 minutes on a hard floor, so we squirmed and we\ncomplained, but quietly, because father did not take any guff from any kid.",
        "Q: So it was a part of your home life and it was certainly a part of your parents beliefs?",
        "A: Very much so, yes.",
        "Q: Was there a time, as you started to get older, that it became more something that you\nbelieved in and it wasn\u2019t that your parents were kind of asking you to do?",
        "A: No, it became \u2014 it was given \u2014 it was given. We did not question. We knew that if you\nwent to college later on, if you went to university, you lost your faith, in parenthesis. You\nlost your faith, because you started questioning. And you started not really believing the\nstories. \u201cWell, those are just stories, you know, Bible is a story and religious stories is a\nstory and life\u2019s of saints, oh, just nice little stories. And the Christians and the lion s, of\ncourse, were also just stories. Maybe true, maybe not. So you don\u2019t have to believe any\nmore, huh?\u201d But there were not many people who went to college and there not many of\nthose who went there, who lost their faith.",
        "Q: You say you were in school, were you thinking about going to college, were your parents\ntalking to you about that?",
        "A: Yes, they were talking about going not to college, but to go into middle school, which\nback there, it was a gimnazjum,\u00b0 it was equivalent of American college. And I was one of\nthe students who was halfway bright and I di\u2014 gi\u2014 did get grant. They call it stypendium.\u201d\nI went to \u2014 for two years to the city of Wegrow, which was about 15, 18 miles, it was our\ncounty seat. I went to this \u2014 I call it gimnazjum, before the war came and ended it all.",
        "Q: So how old were you when you went?",
        "A: I started at \u2014 I was 15 and I ended when I was 17, when the war came, I was almost 17\nwhen the war came.",
        "Q: And was it obviously \u2014 how did your parents feel about you going?",
        "A: Well, they wanted badly to go \u2014 to let me go, but they could not afford it. The fees were\nsteep. So I did get a so-called stypendium from the county. There were two kids from the\ncounty who passed the examination and I was the second one. The first one was a girl\n* Grammar school (Polish)\n\u201d Scholarship (Polish)\nwho was bright and I hated her. Competed with her all \u2014 all my grade four, five and six\nand seven. And she just almost always beat me to it, except in the literature.",
        "Q: So, was it hard for your parents to let you go?",
        "A: Not really. They were so proud, they were so damn proud, I was ashamed sometime\nwhen they bragged about it.",
        "Q: Tell us what they said, what would they say about you?",
        "A: \u201cWell, he\u2019s bright. See, he can read. He could read when he was four.\u201d To take it back,\nwhen I was about eight or nine, my uncle Bronislaus got married. They lived in a big,\nramshackle house. His wife brought a bunch of books. Those were th\u2014 those were the\nbooks I was not supposed to read. They\u2019re called in the French Romances. Of course I\ndid, I sneaked out and read them, I mean I just read them day and night. And of course I\ngot caught. My mother said, \u201cAha. Those books you are not supposed to read, but I guess\nI won\u2019t prevent you from reading it, so to counter with, every night after supper, after\nyou eat supper, you are going to read the Bible, aloud.\u201d \u201cBible? What do I want to read\nthe Bible for?\u201d \u201cWell, you are going to read it if you want to or not.\u201d So I did, for half an\nhour, then 45 minutes, then one hour. The neighbor\u2019s kids were laughing, \u201cHoo, he is\nreading Bible.\u201d Pretty soon the neighbors kids started coming in to listen, because the\nOld Testament stories are fascinating, bloody and murder at times. Especially if you\ncome to the Book of Judith, I mean that was a real story. So, after supper, there\u2019d be a\nbunch of kids sitting, later on, in winter, I mean and we had no electricity, just a ga\u2014 a\nkerosene lamp there. Adult neighbors would be coming and listening to those stories of\nOld Testament, especially the Book of Judith when she \u2014 she went to sleep with him and\ngot up in a middle of a night, I mean the leader, the whole affair and this leader of the\nPhilistines \u2014 got up in a middle of a night, chopped off his head and took it with her. I\nmean, those were great stories. By the time I was 14, I read the Bible aloud twice. So I\npretend to know something about Bible.",
        "Q: What \u2014 at that point, what were you thinking your future might hold? Were you think \u2014\ndid you have any idea of what you might do?",
        "A: Well, it was a given that I was going to be a farmer. I would inherit most of my father\u2019s\nfarm, pay off my sisters. I had different ideas, I wanted to live in a city and get ajob ina\ncity, especially af\u2014 I, after I went for two years to gimnazjum, I was \u2014 I knew everything.\nBut I didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t talk much about it because my father was a choleryk.' He had a\nshort temper. If you said anything that he didn\u2019t like, you got walloped.\n'\u00b0 Spitfire (Polish)",
        "Q: It sounds though like a very unified family.",
        "A: Very much so. Kind of, but not exactly on a defensive, but very close-knit family.",
        "Q: Think back to maybe six months or a year before the war broke out. Did \u2014 do you\nremember a time when you noticed a shift in the tone? That you began to be aware that\nsomething might be happening, and how \u2014 how did you become aware of a change \u2014\npossible change in your life?",
        "A: We were very much aware that the war was coming. I mean, we \u2014 we just \u2014 we just felt it\nin our bones. And the political shenanigans, negotiations and so on and so forth, we knew\nwe were going to fight Germany. We never expected to find the Soviets. We had, of\ncourse, Non-aggression Pact with the So \u2014 pact with the Soviets. We did not expect to\nfight them, but we knew we were going to fight the Germans. There\u2019s a Polish joke, later\non developed, you know, when times were the hardest, the most difficult, people were\nbeing killed, mutilated, arrested, sent to camps, gassed \u2014 the Poles made the best jokes.\nWe made the best jokes ever. Scenario \u2014 the Germans come from the west, the Russians\ncome to \u2014 from the we \u2014 east, who do we shoot first? Russians. Pleasure before duty.",
        "Q: On that note, let\u2019s change tapes.",
        "A: You have to have a Catholic Bible.",
        "Q: Okay. My mom does.",
        "A: Does she? Okay, look in a \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, she\u2019s Catholic.",
        "A: \u2014 the Book of \u2014 of Judith does not exist in a Patterson Bible.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: See, when the Bible was being translated \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 the group of Anglican scholars appointed by Hen \u2014 King Henry, looked at it and they\nsay, \u201cthis, this, this and that and that\u2014\u201c",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 are not necessarily inspired, so we will leave them out. There\u2019s Belgium and Reims,\nFrance, they translated the Bible, the so-called Douai-Reims translation and they said,\n\u201cWhatever was good for Saint Jerome is good for us.\u201d So they translated the whole kit\nand caboodle.\nEndo of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Consequently \u2014",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m sure she has that.",
        "A: Consequently, 11 parts of Old Testament do not exist in a \u2014",
        "Q: Eleven? Eleven books?",
        "A: Eleven parts, ele\u2014 not, not complete books.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. Parts, right.",
        "A: But the Book of Judith \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the Book of Daniel in lion\u2019s den and few others don\u2019t exist. Part of a \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewsk1i. It is April 8, 1998. We are outside of\nMinneapolis, Minnesota. This interview 1s conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape two.\nThink \u2014 if you can think back to \u2014 you were saying that you knew that war was coming.\nTo think back to \u2014 you know, place yourself and how did you know? Did you hear things\non the radio? Were there conversations that you had or heard? If you could tell us some\nof those.",
        "A: It was mostly news on the radio and also newspapers, also newspapers. We kind of\nwatched closely, all the political shenanigans. You know, our Ministers of \u2014 of Foreign\nAffairs was going back and forth, was going to France, was going to Germany, was going\nto England, negotiating and negotiating and Germans having more and more power and\nasking for more and more of \u2014 of Poland. We knew that time was coming and of course\nwe knew we\u2019re going to beat the bejesus out of the Germans, turned out differently.",
        "Q: What did your father and mother say about it? What was the feeling back home in\nLesnogora, you were in school nearby, what wa\u2014 when you went home, what were\npeople saying?",
        "A: It was a vacation time when those things went on, so I was at home. I was back in June\nand there was June, July and it started at the end of August or first of September. So we\ntalked about a lot of it and father said, \u201cWell, we can beat them easily.\u201d And he wanted to\njoin \u2014 he wanted to join, but they wouldn\u2019t take him. Said, \u201cYou old man, go back\nhome.\u201d",
        "Q: So, was there any fear?",
        "A: There was apprehension, but not real fear. We kind of felt that, \u201cWell, regardless how\nbad it is, it\u2019s going to be on the Western border. There may be a stalemate, they may be\ngoing for some time, but most likely they won\u2019t come here.\u201d Of course, later on we, we\nlearned better.",
        "Q: How did you understand what Germany was doing? I mean, how did you understand\nHitler and Nazism?",
        "A: Well, first of all, we heard a lot of that perse-persecute-persecution in Germany. We had\nsome Jewish people who came and lived with our Jewish friends in Kaluszyn, who came\nfrom Germany and told a lot how they were being \u201ckicked around,\u201d as \u2014 as they said. The\nGermans had demands \u2014 wanted to have the northern part of Poland, the Polish corridor\nthat we had, going to the Baltic Sea. First they asked for free passage back and forth\nbetween East Prussia and Germany. Later on, they asked for the corridor, they just\nwanted there \u2014 they wanted Gdynia, they wanted Danzig, they wanted the whole\nterritory. And of course, Poland was not about to give it to them, so we knew that a war\nwas on-coming.",
        "Q: When you say you heard about how the Jews were being treated in Germany and that you\nheard from people that had been kicked \u2014 kicked around, how did you make sense of\nthat? Did you have any idea that this was a \u2014 a policy in Germany?",
        "A: Yes, we did. We knew it was a policy of the German government. We knew \u2014 our press \u2014\nPola-Poland had quite a free press. I mean there were Socialist papers, there were\nextreme Rightist papers and the general press was kind of in between. So there was a lot\nabout the persecution of minorities in Germany. And also, we knew a lot about the\nhoodlums who came to rule Germany. And we kind of wondered, especially in school,\nwhen I was still in school, that winter and spring before the hostilities started. We talked\na lot with professors and we were greatly impressed always by the German scholarship,\nby the German philosophy, by the German literature. And then we thought, how could\nthat ever happen, that the Germans let themselves be led \u2014 those intelligent, those bright,\nthose advanced Germans can be led by a group of hoodlums of that kind \u2014 of that sort.",
        "Q: So think back to that summer of 1939 and tell us where you are, what you\u2019re doing every\nday and as we get closer to September, 1939, what\u2019s going on? Are \u2014 are you being\nrecruited, are you talking with your friends about fighting, what\u2019s going on?",
        "A: That summer, we work on farm. I work \u2014 help my father on the farm, we \u2014 we it was \u2014\neverything was almost planted when I came home from school in June, but the harvest\ncame soon, first the hay. And the haying was done all by hand, even the mowing of the\nhay was done by hand. And the first day of haying \u2014 of mowing the hay, when you came\nhome at night, you didn\u2019t feel like eating, you could not sleep, your bone ached, every\nmuscle your body ached. You were pulling the scythe, mowing the hay all day. Second\nday was better, the third day was nothing to it. Then the harvest came, of course and it\nwas a hot, dry summer. The harvest was quite good, so we harvested first the rye, then\nthe wheat, then the potato picking did not come until September. By that time, the war\nwas over, when we picked the potatoes, so it wa\u2014 else, was just about ending. It was a\nsummer of apprehension, a summer of some fear \u2014 what is going to happen? And of\ncourse, when the war started, things started happening.",
        "Q: What did you think was \u2014 was going to happen with you? What were your plans?",
        "A: My plans were just about broken. I knew that I probably wouldn\u2019t go to school any more.\nAnd I was very reluctant to stay and work on the farm. And when the war came and we \u2014\nwhen we lost the war to Germans and the Soviets, I knew I was going to be stuck and\nwork on a farm with my father, which \u2014 I was quite resigned to it. Said, \u201cWell, hopefully\nthe war will end and maybe I wi\u2014 I can go back to school and perhaps live \u2014 even live in\na city. But for now, I\u2019m stuck here, so I better make the best of it.\u201d",
        "Q: Tell us where, where you were in those early days of September, in 1939 and when you\nfirst felt the presence of the invading army\u201d?",
        "A: It was \u2014 we knew that it was going to start soon, like in August. And we knew that\nGermany was going to attack soon. And then we heard the news about the Polish \u2014 a\nsmall group attacking Germany, in Silesia \u2014 it was a little town of Glewice, where a\nGerman dressed up a group of their own soldiers in Polish uniforms and attacked their\nradio station, took it over. And of course they had brought bodies from concentration\ncamps, dead bodies and dressed them in Polish uniform \u2014 uniforms and had some\ncasualties there. So we heard about that and of course, few days later, September first,\nthey attacked.",
        "Q: I\u2019m not sure I really understood what happened in that little town in Silesia?",
        "A: In Glewice?",
        "Q: Yeah, in Gle-Gle\u2014",
        "A: Ah, it was a p\u2014a put up affair by the Germans. They dressed up Wehrmacht\" people in\nPolish uniforms and attacked their own radio station. It was the incident that created the\nwar. They had the pretext, \u201cThe Polish \u2014 Poles attacked us and now we have to, of\ncourse, defend ourselves.\u201d",
        "Q: How did you hear about it and how did you know exactly what had happened?",
        "A: It was on a Polish radio, it was in \u2014 was in Polish papers. Polish intelligence at that time\napparently, was quite keen. And they knew all about it.",
        "Q: So where were you \u2014 where were you when you first heard about that and what were your\nthoughts?",
        "A: I was in my village, listening to a crystal radio and I thought, \u201cWell, it\u2019s inevitable, the\nwar 1S CO \u2014 war 1s coming and we\u2019ll have to fight.\u201d I was too young to \u2014 to be\nconscripted. My father was too old. He, of course, wanted to go and join. They said, \u201cGo\n\u2014 old man, go back home. You had yours.\u201d",
        "Q: And when \u2014 how quickly did you feel the presence of Germans in your town?",
        "A: Within about three weeks, they were, in our neighborhood, the \u2014 kind of a pincer\nmovement went around Warsaw. The \u2014 Warsaw was still fighting, but they went around\nand approached our neighborhood. There was quite a sharp firefight in my village.\nStarted early morning \u2014 the Polish cavalry came in and some infantry came in. The\ncavalry dismounted and sent horses back and they dug in on the periphery of my village.\nThey had a whole bunch of little, anti-tank artillery. Was two fat wheels, and a horse and\nthey could pull it like the dickens. Two men could pull that little thing. It was very\neffective against German tanks. So they dug in and they were waiting, and of course, the\nGermans attacked. And it\u2019s kind of strange, my father said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you take\nthe cows to the pasture?\u201d And my father dug a dugout for the family, in a garden in the\norchard, so they were \u2014 went all there and I took their horses and the cows to the pasture\nin the back \u2014 way back, beyond the village \u2014 it was a communal pasture. By the time I \u2014 I\ndid get there, I couldn\u2019t come back because there was a \u2014 I mean, was honest to goodness\nfirefight. It was long distance artillery German \u2014 German artillery shooting. And a \u2014a\nkind of bombarding the neighborhood, there was a \u2014 more machine guns going all over,\nso I just stayed behind the village, there, for about two hours. In about two hours, the\nPoles retreated and went and then came two cavalry men, who said, \u201cHey, little boy, do\nyou know that little wood across the hill, there?\u201d \u201cOf course I know it.\u201d \u201cWe have horses\n'' Armed forces (German)\nthere, about 15 horses, can you go and get the horses here?\u201d \u201cOh, sure. Why not?\u201d So I\nstarted running, kind of over the hill \u2014 I run over the hill and there was lot of firing and\ngoing and then I see \u2014 all of a sudden, I was kind of running on the border of a hi \u2014 of a \u2014\nof a field. The border was kind of a strip of grass, it was higher than a field and I see right\nby my feet there, dust flying. And I didn\u2019t think \u2014 think much of it, but it was somebody\nshooting machine gun from a way, way distance there \u2014 German machine gun and hitting\nright where I was running, below my feet. It was several times, right below my feet.\nApparently, whoever was shooting, was shooting little too low, thank goodness. When I\nran to \u2014 I ran over the hill, the horses were gone.\nSo I laid down behind a bunch of trees, big Olszyna'\u201d trees. There were such trees here.\nAnd artillery was shooting and hitting in \u2014 in transit was hitting a top of a trees and\nbranches were falling down. So I just laid there for about half an hour, then it slowed\ndown, I went back to the village, village was on fire and about two-thirds of the village\nwas burned. There were nobody \u2014 no civilian casualties. There were about 35 Polish\nsoldiers, who were killed. There were about 100 of Germans who were killed, back in\napproach the village. There were about 11 tanks that were mashed to smithereens by\nthose little ca \u2014 Polish cannons. And of course the Poles ran away and the Germans came\nin. We were taking \u2014 getting water in pails, out of a \u2014 out of a well and I was \u2014 I climbed\nup on a top of a roof to prevent our house from being burned, because the neighbors\nhouse were burning, so I was handed the pails of water, I was pouring on the \u2014 on the\nroof of the house to prevent it from burning on. And the refugees who are running around\nthe Warsaw, the bunch \u2014 were a group of people from Warsaw who were running around,\n\u201cWhat will happen to us, what will happen to us? The Germans are going to kill us.\u201d\nWell, the German patrol came down the village and they just came, they didn\u2019t bother\nanybody, went across the village and went into the woods beyond the village, where the\nPolish army escaped. And more patrols came and more patrols came. But they were very\ncorrect, they did not bother anybody. They questioned a few men and they took\ndocument \u2014 asked for documents and they did not bother anybody. In \u2014 in other places,\nthey would take young men and \u2014 and kill them. In our village, they were quite correct.",
        "Q: So, almost your first \u2014 well, your first interaction with this war. You were essentially\ninvolved in it. You got asked to come into it.",
        "A: Well, kind of, but I was almost a bystander, but I was little foolhardy running over the\ntop of a hill where the shooting is going on. Of course I can \u2014 I could run. I said, \u201cI can\nrun \u2014 outrun anything. Nobody can hit me \u2014 aim and hit.\u201d And they didn\u2019t.\n'? Alder tree (Polish)",
        "Q: Did you tell your father this story?",
        "A: Well, yeah, sure, of course I told him, I bragged about it. And he said, \u201cGood for you.\u201d\nBecause my father went with horses to the forefront, where the Polish soldiers were dug\nin, he was doing some field work. And when there started shooting, he just stayed with\nthem. And he went to talk to them in a \u2014 1n the \u2014 in foxholes, said, \u201cYou better go there.\nGet on this side, get on this side.\u201d \u201cWhat do you know, old man?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean\nold man? I\u2019m an old soldier. Right here get mutilated, get behind that bush. Dig \u2014 dig a\nlittle foxhole there.\u201d So they did and sure enough, long distance artillery shell came right\nwhere they were and made a hole you can drive \u2014 ride horses 1n it. So they turn and said,\n\u201cWell, you old man, you \u2014 you knew what you were doing.\u201d Well, they retreated. So he\nwent back with them and he wanted a rifle, but they said, \u201cWhy, we don\u2019t give rifles to\ncivilians.\u201d So of course he came home and my sisters and my mother and some of the\nrefugee from Warsaw women were in our dugout there. Of course, everything was\nburning. The pigs were burning and squealing and \u2014 it was kind of a bedlam.",
        "Q: That the animals were burning and dying?",
        "A: Yes. We were lucky. Our house and our barn \u2014 animal barn \u2014 I mean cow barn and our\ngrain barn were not burned, so. We had a lot of people living with us for \u2014 after then.\nSome were relatives who were burnt out, some were neighbors who got burnt out. We\nhad probably 35 people living with us. Was a three room part of a house. We cooked a\nlot. We rescued some of the pigs that were burned and we lived high on the hog for\nseveral weeks.",
        "Q: What were those few weeks like right after that first firefight? Were, were the Germans a\npresence in the village?",
        "A: The Germans were not around at all. There was some German police, that went and\nstayed with the Polish Blue Police in the Grebkow by middle, my school village where I\nwent to grade fourth and up. And there were Germans in Wegrow , the county town.\nThere was a\u2014a small army detachment. And later on \u2014 later, later on, there were\nGermans \u2014 German cavalry standing in neighb-\u2014 sitting \u2014 staying in neighboring village,\nbut to my village, 1t came only for a visit. It was a time when they were apparently\npreparing for the eastern front, but of course I wasn\u2019t there then. I was way out of it.",
        "Q: Well, what, what happened in those weeks that you \u2014 there were refugees living with\nyou, what was going on around you and what were people talking about? How were they\npreparing to cope with their situation?",
        "A: People were quite bewildered. They didn\u2019t know exactly what was going to go on. The\ncivil administration was left intact, as it was. They had German supervisors, but on our\nlittle district, there was not even a German supervisor. There was a count and there was a\ndistrict secretary and couple helpers, couple typists. There were a three man police force,\nwhich was staying there and they got orders from a Germans, but not really any orders to\ndo anything unusual, just to keep peace. And of course, bunch of little boys \u2014 I joined the\nunderground organization immediately. I think it was in early \u2014 late September or early\nOctober. We had a swearing in ceremony, one by one, in a cemetery. I can still remember\nit by heart. That was the \u2014 that was the O.P., Obroncy Polski,\u2019 the Defenders of Poland.",
        "Q: Describe that and what \u2014 what \u2014 how did they swear you in? What \u2014",
        "A: Well, you swore in that you are joining the defenders of Poland and, \u201cI\u2019m going to obey\nall orders by the organization. I will not disclosed any secrets to the enemy, regardless of\nwhatever happens and I will fight to the end for the freedom of my country.\u201d That was\nabout it. I still remember it in Polish.",
        "Q: Can you say it in Polish?",
        "A: Not really. And we did \u2014 not much, but we did get together once or twice a week and we\ntalked and we collected arms and ammunition that was dropped by the Polish army, or by\nthe Germans. We had a German light machine gun. We had a Polish light machine gun\nand we had a lot of rifles. I even found a six-shooter. It just \u2014 looked almost like a\nAmerican six-shooter. Of course I gave it away to my commander later on, because he\nhad to have a side-arms and I didn\u2019t need to.",
        "Q: How many people were in this group?",
        "A: There were 12 of us. Just a litt\u2014 from two small villages, from Lesnogora and Zarnowka.\nAnd of course, the swearing ceremony was very young and moving, you know, in a\ncemetery.",
        "Q: Could you describe it? Was, was it at night?",
        "A: It was in the evening, yes.",
        "Q: What, what was it like?",
        "A: Well, the commander came from somewhere, I don\u2019t know where, we\u2019re not supposed to\nknow. And he administered the oath. You would swear upon your grandfather grave. And\nof course I wasn\u2019t with it for too long, because I took a little side trip.\n'S Guardians of Poland (Polish)",
        "Q: So 12 young men got together and decided that they would fight?",
        "A: Yes. Just a bunch of kids shooting off their mouth. I have glaucoma on my eyes on\noccasionally. But it\u2019s under control and my doctor says, \u201cI\u2019m going to make you see until\nyou die.\u201d",
        "Q: Do you have any particular friends from that group of 12? Were they your \u2014 were they\nyour\u2014",
        "A: All dead.",
        "Q: All dead.",
        "A: None alive. Mostly were killed. Most of them were dead by 1943.",
        "Q: So what did you do? I mean, did you get into any \u2014",
        "A: Well, see when I \u2014 when I took my little side trip, they were in their organization. They\nbecame an active, so-called active group. And they went on so-called wet works,\nattacking German patrols, German moving troops, German riding on a freeway toward\nthe eastern front. And they did get mutilated. They got shot and killed and apprehended\nand killed in prisons and \u2014 out of those, I don\u2019t think anybody is still alive.",
        "Q: So, very quickly you formed a sort of a secret underground resistance group and then you\nawaited orders?",
        "A: We awaited orders. There were group in almost every small village. Every two villages\nthey had a group. There was a overall command. We don\u2019t know who they \u2014 we didn\u2019t\nknow who they were. They came for a visit, they announced, by runner they would come\nfor a visit, we'll talk to you and they came and talked and gave us instruction and send us\ntrainers, who trained us for the things to come. But I took very little part in that, because I\nwent on a trip east.",
        "Q: Tell us about that.",
        "A: We had relatives and \u2014 who were in the Soviet zone, so-called, and it was \u2014 well I called\nthe, the man uncle, but he was just a distant relative, he was not an uncle. We had some\nfamily things to do. I brought some documents to him that he needed. And when I came,\nit was the night where they came. The Soviets NK WD\u2122 came with lists and took\neverybody who was anybody in the Polish administration, with their family. There was a\n' NKVD\njudgment night in a marketplace. There was a town of about 18-20,000 people. They took\n1,800 people. Men who were in administration, who were teachers or preachers or\npolicemen or anybody who were representatives to Polish legislation. And the judgment\ntime took about four and a half hours. It was about like 37 seconds per person. There\nwere three men. There was a man sitting behind a table with a long list, civilian, kind of\nweasely little person. There was a man sitting in a middle and a big, Russian officer\novercoat and a big hat, with a face, with a face \u2014 there\u2019s a little Russian saying, \u201cMorda\nkirpicha prosit.'\u00b0\u201d \u201cA face that asks for a brick.\u201d He had a face like that. On the right\nhand of his, sat another civilian with a list, writing sentences. The person on the left, the\ngroup of people, or a family, or a person would came that he would look up his name on\nthe list and he would tell \u2014 the person in middle that one looked up \u2014 and then he would\nsaid \u2014 would say, \u201cTwelve and a half, five and five. Next. Fifteen, five and five. Next.\u201d\nThe one on the right would write a sentence. Twelve and a half or 15 or 20, means 12 and\na half, 15 or 20 years of hard labor in a prison camp, in gulag, in most cases, in Siberia or\nOuter Mongolia or Kazakhstan. Five years of external exile, you could not come back.\nFive more years of a loss of citizenship. \u201cNext.\u201d Some people questioned it. I said, \u201cSir,\nbut I haven\u2019t done anything. Why?\u201d He said, \u201cThis is Soviet justice, you don\u2019t question\nit, you questioned it.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d So, he said, \u201cWell take him out and\nshoot him.\u201d \u201cOkay, okay. It\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all right, I'll stay 15 years.

        "A: No, those were a \u2014 those were cattle trains that bunks were built. There was a pot-bellied\nstove that you could feed as much as you wanted to. And there were triple bunks and I\ndon\u2019t remember how many people, about 50 people in each car. You know, like that 18\nmen and fo\u2014 and \u2014 and six horses, or six horses. There were about 50 of us, I think about\n52. They kept the famil\u2014 let the families be together. Yeah, we did get to the camp and\nwe f\u2014",
        "Q: Were you scared then?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: Were you scared?",
        "A: Not really. We stopped places, they gave us food sometime, there were Russian people\nwho were a \u2014 on little stations looking and talking to us. And if we \u2014 some of us had\nsome money, they wanted Polish money or they wanted goods. They figured a piece of\nclothes, they could get some good food. We bantered, we laughed, we sang a lot. It was\njust accomplished fact, nothing to do \u2014 you can do about it. The guards were not very\nbad. If you wanted to run away \u2014 if you tried to run away, they shot you. That\u2019s about all\nthey could do. They did not mistreat us. We just went like on a nice vacation. Slightly\napprehensive.",
        "Q: Where \u2014 what did you think was going to happen? Where \u2014 did they tell you where you\nwere going?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know a thing. We didn\u2019t know a thing. They told us \u201cIdyosh na poselenie.'\u201d\nYou are being exiled. \u201cNa poselenie.'*\u201d",
        "Q: Your parents didn\u2019t know where you were?",
        "A: No. My parents knew I disappeared.\n16 ;\nLake Bikal\n' You are going for settlement (Russian)\n'S For settlement (Russian)",
        "Q: So tell us what it was like when you did get there.",
        "A: We put in a \u2014 1n a barracks. Some people were put in a tent, I was luc\u2014 because there\nwere not enough cabins. They were log cabins like barracks. But we kept building more\nof these log cabins. There were two, big pot-bullied \u2014 bellied \u2014 pot-bellied stoves that we\nfed as much wood as we wanted to. If you were close to it, you were sizzling. If you got\nlittle away from it, you are freezing. You know it\u2019s a nice cool place there, huh? Forty-\nfive below zero, is nothing to it. It used to get to 72 below zero. We \u2014 it was 72 below\nzero and heavy wind, we did not have to go to work. So every night we would kneel\ndown and say, \u201cGood Lord, let it be 72 below zero tomorrow and heavy winds, so we\nstay in.\u201d Well, if it was 71, nothing doing. If it was 72 and \u2014 and wind, you went anyway.",
        "Q: Did you have warm clothes?",
        "A: We had clothes that we came with and also they had the prison clothes, which is quilted\nkind of a gaber\u2014 I mean, kind of a poor material, like a \u2014 like a lining on a poor jacket,\nquilted, with a cotton in between. The down stuff is quite warm. And we had walonki,\u201d\u201d\nwhich were felt boots, which were issued to some of us. So you could survive. You could\nsurvive.",
        "Q: So what did you think when you got there? I mean, what did you think was \u2014 was going\nto happen?",
        "A: We thought that we will try to survive. Since they are not taking it \u2014 us out and shooting\nus offhand, as they frequently used to do, that we knew of. The damn Communists used\nto do that to people frequently. We thought that we would try to survive.",
        "Q: So what \u2014 what was a re \u2014 describe a regular day.",
        "A: Waked up in su\u2014 before sunrise, counting \u2014 Appell\u2019, counting. You got a pot of tea,\nwhich was made out of birch leaves. You got a little, tiny piece of bread, maybe half an\nounce or so. You ate it. Then you dressed up and you went walking. If you remember,\nabout four or five years ago, where there was a Olympics in Sarajevo, they showed the\nRussian Siberian man, who was a weightlifter and a wrestler, how he ran a mile in the\nsnow that deep? This is the snow we walked in. It was two guards and about 50 of us and\nwe walked. And the person who walked ahead was changed every hundred feet or so. If,\nfor \u2014 sometime for punishment, if they made one person walk all way, a mile or two or\n\u201d Felt boots (Polish)\n*\u00bb Roll call (German).\nthree miles to the place of work. He \u2014 by the time he got there, he was dead \u2014 breaking\nthe snow. So we went \u2014 we cut trees for about five hours, then came soup at noon. People\ncame with sleds from a camp, with big kettles of fish and cabbage soup. It was mostly\nwater. We sat down and ate the soup, then we cut tree \u2014 trees again and stacked them and\ncame back. Six p.m., we started on the way home, we got there by seven or so. Were\ncounted again, got another pot of tea and a little slice of bread and of course to sleep. We\nhad a good guard. I mean he was a damn Soviet, but he was a good guy, the guard. I\nmean, he was just out of this world. When we did get there, said, \u201cTea. Make fire.\u201d So we\nmade fire. \u201cMake big fire. Sit and rest.\u201d So we sat around and rest. And he looked at his\nwatch, he had a Polish watch that he stole during 1939 campaign, said \u201cpolsky chasy.\u201d'\u201d\nPolish watch runs well. \u201cGo and cut.\u201d So we went and cut for about, oh probably one\nhour. So then, \u201cHey, come on back.\u201d So we came back. \u201cSit and rest. Soup coming.\u201d Oh,\nin about one hour, soup came. \u201cEat.\u201d We ate. \u201cSit and rest.\u201d We sat and rest. \u201cGo and\ncut.\u201d So went and cut for about one hour. And he \u2014 then he went \u2014 came to us there\nwhere we were. \u201cNow, go and steal.\u201d So we went stealing. A prisoner had to cut a cubic\nyard of wood a day. And regardless how young, how strong, how big you were, you\ncould never do it. If you didn\u2019t cut a square yard per person, your group didn\u2019t, at night\nyour soup was cut, your bread was cut accordingly. Next day you were weaker. In a week\nyou were gone. So we would go and steal the wood that we cut day before and day before\nand day before stack it up, he would measure it. \u201cOkay, now we sit down and rest, we go\nhome soon. Make bigger fire.\u201d So we went home. That Ivan Ivanovich was a damn good\nman.\nAlso, I was lucky. I spoke some English, I spoke some German. I spoke Russian quite\nwell. When my father and mother wanted us kid not to know what was going on, they\nspoke Russian. My mother was a Russian teacher in middle school before she got\nmarried. My father was of course, Russian speaking person. So we kids learned it in a\nhurry. We knew exactly what was going on. On the train for six weeks, by the time we\ngot to Siberia, my Russian was almost as good as my English. Much more colorful\nbecause I knew a lot of swear words. So they found out and I was called to the\ncommanders office and he said, \u201cYou stay here, you translate.\u201d And he got the German\nword, \u201cYou dolmetscher.*\u201d\u201d \u201cYou interpreter.\u201d I don\u2019t know how he got that German\nword, I knew what it was, but \u201cYou dolmetscher.\u201d When new prisoners came, I would\nget up on that barrel and I would shout, \u201cHis Excellency, Commander so and so says this\nand says that and says that. You don\u2019t do this, you don\u2019t do that. You get shot for this,\nyou get in solitary for that. You get hunged up for this. So remember.\u201d And of course,\nafter a few days, I\u2014 one time a group of Czechs came and I got up on the barrel and I\nbecame kind of \u2014 took it for granted, became rambunctious \u2014 young, stupid kid. And I\nsaid, \u201cCommander Mika-Mikhail Ivishenerovich, that son of a dog says this and this and\n*! Polish watch (Russian)\n** Interpreter (German)\nthis.\u201d And in Polish it\u2019s skurwysyn,~ in Russian, it\u2019s sukin-syn.~* In English, of course,\nyou know what it is. So he came and he knocked me down and he kicked me. Said, \u201cYou\nlittle so and so, you called me sukin-syn.\u201d Said, \u201cI called you Excellency, and Excellency\nin Polish \u2014 in Czech, and sukin-syn sounds almost close together. I call you Excellency.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I know Polish and I know Czech, you call me sukin-syn. If you say that again,\nPll shoot you, you little so and so.\u201d Said, \u201cCommander, I did not say it, but I will not sa\u2014\never say it again if I did.\u201d I thought my goose was cooked, but it wasn\u2019t. So I stayed in\nbarrack, I peeled potatoes, I swept the barracks. I had a norm man, a man who wrote the\nnorms for the people, what people did during the day. I helped him do the norms. The\nclassification, how much soup at night everybody gets. And I learn how to cheat, how to\nwrite up \u2014 how to cheat so that people made more than they did. Anyway, I made it.",
        "Q: You were with your family still, right?",
        "A: I was with \u2014 I was with my family still. About 11 months later, when Hitler attacked the\nSoviets, Polish und\u2014 government in exile in London, negotiated with Stalin and those of\nus who received less than 50 years were \u2014 15 years, were released. So my little cousin\ngirl and I were released. It did not make any difference to my uncle, because he was\ndead. My aunt was dead. Their son \u2014 who was as big as this young man, and strong and\nsportsman, he was dead. Two little weasel-y thing, that little girl and I were still alive.",
        "Q: How did they die? Did they die in \u2014 in the work camp?",
        "A: Died hard \u2014 hard work. Mistreatment, beating occasionally. Some guards were vicious.\nSome guards were not as good as Ivan Ivanovich. I still say a prayer for him\noccasionally.",
        "Q: For him?",
        "A: For him. We did get out. We were allowed to go to southern part of Russia, where Poles\nare being collected and Polish army, to fight with the Soviets against the Germans, was\nformed. Some of us crossed into Iran. The Soviets had a hard time taking care of all of us.\nIran was run by the Russians and the British. We did sneak into the British part. The\nBritish trained us, armed us, fed us \u2014 formed Polish second corps under Polish General\nAnders.\u201d They went to fight in North Africa. In Egypt, North Africa, all way to Tripoli.\nLater on they went fighting in Italy, all way to Monte Cassino.",
        "Q: At this point were you still with your cousin?\n\u00b0\u00b0 Son of a whore (Polish)\n** Son of a bitch (Russian)\n> Gen. Wladyslaw Anders",
        "A: My cousin \u2014 women and \u2014 and children were bundled up and sent to India and South\nAfrica. They build camps for them to stay for duration. After the war, they were all sent\nback to Europe.",
        "Q: How was your strength after 11 months? Your strength?",
        "A: Mine was all right. I had enough to eat. I had a sideline. After about seven weeks there, I\nwas allowed to go out. There was a little settlement, winter settlement. They wer\u2014 they\nwere the Samoyed people. Siberian people like American Eskimos. Samoyed people\nraised reindeer and fished. So I went and wandered around and a young boy came and\ntalked to me, he said, \u201cWho you are?\u201d \u201cKto vy takoy?\u201d\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, I am Polish.\u201d\nAnd, \u201cChto eto takoy?\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cWhat is that?\u201d Said, \u201cWell, I am from a country way, way\nwest. Just like your Samoyed country, the damn Soviets took us over, they took you over\nand beat the bejesus out of us and sent us here to work in a camp.\u201d \u201cUh-huh. You\nhungry?\u201d \u201cOf course I\u2019m hungry.\u201d \u201cCome and eat.\u201d And Samoyed build, build \u2014 live-in\nyurtas. Yurta is a kind of a conical tent made of bearskins, double bearskin \u2014 four out and\nfour in. And it\u2019s kind of a good size, about the size of this living room here, about 12, 15\nfeet in diameter. But if you get into the yurta, if you \u2014 they use a \u2014 long handed hatchets,\nlike American Indian tomahawks. If you pick up the hatchet and put it like this and take\nyour hand off, the hatchet will stay there, the air is so thick. The Samoyed had people\nwash twice a year, if they have to or not. And they cook, they sleep, they make babies,\nthey do everything in the yurta. I mean the smell is overpowering. But they say, \u201cNever\nmind, pribyknyesh\u201d \u2014 you get used to it.\u201d So I ate a lot of fish and the young man said,\n\u201cYou come tomorrow?\u201d \u201cIf I can, I come tomorrow.\u201d So he gave me some fish, I took the\nfish to the camp. I shared some with the guards, I shared some with fellow prisoners.\nNext day I couldn\u2019t go, so third day I went and, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d \u201cStefan.\u201d \u201cWe call\nyou Stepka. Khorosho, kak Vas velichat\u2019?\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cHow do we call you?\u201d Velichat\u2019\u201d\u201d, it\nmeans, you use you name, your father\u2019s name. So I said my father was Jana. \u201cOkay,\nStepka Ivanovich, come on and eat.\u201d So we ate. \u201cYi\u2014 How much time do you have?\u201d\n\u201cOh, some time.\u201d \u201cWe'll go fishing.\u201d So we went fishing. So they gave me \u2014 gave me\nharpoon and we walked, on the River Lena. And I fell in. I didn\u2019t know what was what.\nRiver Lena is a very brisk river. The ice that time was probably 20 feet thick, but there\n\u00b0\u00b0 Who are you such? (Russian)\n*\u2019 What is that such? (Russian)\n*\u00ae You get accustomed (Russian)\n*\u201d Good, what are you called? (Russian)\n~\u2019 To be called by name (Russian)\nwere wash-outs, little bubbles. If you step on the bubble, you go in. I was lucky, I had the\nharpoon. So I fell only in \u2014 that way I got wet. It was not very cold, just about maybe 25\nbelow zero. So two of them grabbed me and ran back \u2014 ran to the \u2014 back to the yurta\nwhere I s \u2014I stripped. And he said, \u201cWell, I loan you my suit.\u201d His suit was made of\nsilver foxes. Big pants up to here and a big parka, with a big, huge hood \u2014 silver fox\noutfit, and reindeer. It was soft as silk. Because this man had three suits and he had three\nwives. Good Siberian women can make only one suit at a time. She has to chew the skin.\nSiberian wives has teeth just about three millimeters long, where they constantly chew\nthe skin. You \u2014 you tan it and then you invert it and you chew the inside of it to make it\nsoft, and becomes \u2014 either the chewing process or the saliva makes it as soft as silk. So I\nwore his suit. Went fishing again, we caught some sturgeon. They made a hole ina\nbubble, we got some sturgeon, we came back. We cooked some fish, we ate some fish.\nMy suit was still wet so he said, \u201cYou wear my suit.\u201d So I went. I was the best dressed\nprisoner in the whole damn Soviet system. I came, everybody\u2019s oh-ing and oo-ing and\nthe guards and especially the chachainsis.*' There were bunch of chachainsis.\nChachainsis is a bunch \u2014 a bunch of son of a guns. They are cutthroats, they are thieves,\nthey are murderers, everything. They kept looking. \u201cOh, too bad he 1s so small. Oh, too\nbad he is so small. We would take it off you.\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t take it off me.\u201d \u201cT\nwouldn\u2019t?\u201d I said that, \u201cWhat would you do to me?\u201d \u201cCut your head off, you stupid so\nand so.\u201d \u201cYou little so and so, you would cut my head off? We cut your head off.\u201d They\nfrequently would \u2014 if somebody wa-\u2014 had something they didn\u2019t\u2014 didn\u2019t want to give,\nthey would come and cut his head off at night and took whatever they wanted. Anyway,\nthey became my friends and protectors. I don\u2019t know why. I was just like a, like a little\nto\u2014 a flea, in comparison with them.",
        "Q: Did you get to keep the suit?",
        "A: Of co \u2014 oh I kept it for duration. Later on, that man said \u2014 well he was a chief\u2019s son, he\nhad three suits and three wives and 700 reindeer. So he said, \u201cWell, I got enough, two\nsuits, you can \u2014 Stepka, you\u2019re my brother, you wear my suit.\u201d So I wore his suit for the\nduration. And when I \u2014 I was ready to leave, I went to visit him and he said, \u201cWell,\nyou\u2019re going to stay with us \u2014 I mean all the time, stay with us. You can marry one my\nsister, you can marry two my sisters. You can marry three of my sisters if you want to.\nYou my brother, you stay with us.\u201d So when I went to say goodbye, I brought his suit\nback. I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have to leave. I want to go and fight for my country.\u201d So we\nhad a good cry and I went away.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Was \u2014\n*! Chechens (Russian)",
        "Q: His name?",
        "A: Krugly.*\u201d That means the round one, Krugly. I could not pronounce his Samoyed name,\nbut he was Krugly, the round one. He was a tough, young Samoyed, with three wives. He\ndidn\u2019t have any children yet.",
        "Q: So you knew when you left that you would probably go back to your country and try to\nfight?",
        "A: I hoped so, I hoped so. Well, we\u2019re told by the political officer, by the politruk\u2019\u2019 in a\ncamp that, \u201cYou are going to join Polish forces, you are going to join our victorious Red\nArmy \u2014 are going to fight the damn Germans.\u201d\n[Technical conversation]\nEnd of Tape #3\n** Round (Russian)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Political instructor (Russian)\nTape #4\n[Technical conversation]",
        "Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewsk1i. It is April 8, 1998. We are outside of\nMinneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape\nnumber four. If we could start with the last day or two before you left the Soviet work\ncamp, how did you find out you were leaving? How did you leave? Where did you go?",
        "Q: It took about say a we \u2014 about a week before we could leave. We were \u2014 there was an\nannouncement, you know, in a square, very official \u2014 lot of high rank officers came and\nsaid, \u201cWe did not want to hurt you \u2014 you \u2014 we knew that you are our friends and now \u2014\nfrom now on we will be allies and you are going to fight the \u2014 fight the German\naggressor, so and so and so. And those of you who are not really criminals, traitors and\nall \u2014 all of us were tr\u2014 tried under clause of high treason, paragraph 150. Even I was\nunder high treason \u2014 150, 150 sub-paragraph \u2014 subparagraph 12, subparagraph 17 \u2014 high\ntreason. What for? Anyway, it took us about a week before they went \u2014 we went down\nthe Lena river. We were up the ri\u2014 Lena river. And then we got on the train and we got\ncollected \u2014 assembled on \u2014 close to Iranian border. And there was such a multitude of us,\nthey couldn\u2019t take care of us. So they said, \u201cIf you want to volunteer and go across there,\nwe have our people there, too.\u201d So we sneaked \u2014 we went across and then we sneaked\ninto the British part. And of course, British were forming Polish army and everybody\nwho was anybody wanted to join it. Instead of joining those damn Communists.",
        "Q: Did you say goodbye to your cousin? Did you realize you might not see her for awhile?",
        "A: Yes, we said goodbye and she was whisked away. In about \u2014 after we moved to the\nBritish zone there, we were together for about a week. And we \u2014 they collected all\nwomen and children and she went to India. Some went to South Africa, but she stayed in\nIndia for the duration of the war.",
        "Q: And when you say \u2014 tell us a little bit more about sneaking into the British side. Who did\nyou do it with, was it a \u2014 a night that you did it? And how did you do it?",
        "A: Well, we just \u2014 actually, we just walked. And the Soviets stopped some groups. Some\ngroups were not even bothered with. Especially groups that had women and children and\nthey didn\u2019t want to bother with. We just walked and hoped for the best.",
        "Q: So if you \u2014 1f you could just describe it for us. Where did you walk to and \u2014 and when \u2014 I\nmean, where did you spend the night, how did you find the British officials?",
        "A: Yeah, it was close to \u2014 1t were close to Teheran, it was west of Teheran. It was kind of a\ndesert area and there was some local people who traveled with herds of sheep and such,\nfrom place to place, so we would stay overnight with them. We just sleep outside, it was\n\u2014 you know, subtropics, it was warm and the \u2014 the British built camps already, so we\nwent to the camp that was built for the refugees, by the British. And of course, pretty\nsoon they started asking young men to come to lectures and come to training and, \u201cDo\nyou want to fight?\u201d \u201cOf course, what do you think? I\u2019m going \u2014 I came here for it.\u201d And\nmany people joined. And then I don\u2019t know if I want to divert. I think I will have to\ndivert back, before I \u2014 I left Siberia. About six months after we be \u2014 were there, they\nfished out 17 young boys, between 16 and 19. And I was one of them and we went\nthrough a heavy indoctrination course. Eight, 10, 12 weeks, eight hours a day. Heavy\nindoctrination course. And if you \u2014 if I get the three of you in a secluded place, that you\nare not allowed to leave, in about two weeks, you'll believe any \u2014 everything that I will\ntell you. They \u2014 there\u2019s nothing better than Communism. Dialectical materialism is the\nonly doctrine that works among peoples. Soviet Russia is the most powerful, most wise,\nmost \u2014 the best of all, the richest. We have the riches in Siberia that you never heard of.\nWe have enormous Ukrainian plains that we can \u2014 if we \u2014 planting our grain, we can s \u2014\nwe can feed the whole world. This is the best. You had to listen closely, you have to\nlisten attentively. If you smirked, if you made a face, if you make a funny remark, you\nwere thrown \u2014 your shoes were taken, your jacket was taken, you were thrown into\nsolitary, which was six \u2014 what \u2014 four by four feet. Your shoes were taken, too, overnight.\nYou had to dance, jump, run all night. If you sat down, you never waked up. Well, I was\nlucky, I spent only three nights. I couldn\u2019t keep my tongue. I mean I couldn\u2019t keep my\nmouth shut. I had to make remarks. I made faces, I laughed in his face, the politruk was a\nbig man, had a face that was asking for a brick, too. I just sm\u2014 laughed in his face. And I\ntold him once, \u201cHow little you know.\u201d So he was lenient with me, but still he, still he\nthrow me in, in the solitary, one night at a time. If you spent two nights, you didn\u2019t make\nit. Some people \u2014 there were a few people who made it for two nights. Three nights\nnobody made, in a row.\nAnyway, by the time we graduated, we had a talk, 45 minute talk. And if you missed two\nwords, you were thrown into solitary, had to repeat it. You had to give a lecture that told\neverything about the dialect \u2014 dialectical materialism. You knew all about Engels*\u2019, you\nknew all about Marx.\u00b0? You knew everything about Lenin.*\u00ae And you most about\nStalin.\u2019 I mean those were the holy \u2014 not a trinity, but a quadruplinity. And you had to\ntalk about them in glowing terms. Your tone of your voice had to be just like a great\n* Friedrich Engels\n\u00b0\u00b0 Karl Marx\n\u00b0\u00b0 Vladimir Ilich Lenin\n\u00b0\u2019 Joseph Stalin\nsermon on a mount. And you know, by the \u2014 by the end of it, I believed, strongly. I\nbecame a honest to goodness believer. So when we were later let go and I think it was\nsomewhat with premeditation that this little group was let go into the British part.\nBecause we going to be the avant-garde of Communism. We are going to get introduced\ninto armed forces or whatever groups there were and we\u2019re going to propagate it by\ngoing \u2014 we are going to be the true believers. And there \u2014 for some way or another, the\nBritish knew it. They collected us again. We went through a heavy indoctrination by the\nPolish political officers, by the British, who some spoke Polish, some worked with the\ntranslators. In about three weeks we lost the faith. We lost the true faith. And then they\nformed the armed forces. Yes, let\u2019s say they went to fight, they fought, fought all way to\nMonte Cassino. By Monte Cassino \u2014 when they took Monte Cassino, the second Polish\ncorps \u2014 after British and the Australians and the Americans couldn\u2019t take it, they were so\nbloodied, they were sent to recuperation\u2014",
        "Q: Remind me where we are at this point. I know where we are, but I mean, what year is it?\nYou\u2019re now \u2014 it\u2019s\u2014",
        "A: It was 1941. 1941 summer\u2014",
        "Q: And you\u2019re outside of Teheran?",
        "A: Out of Teheran, last \u2014 late summer.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re getting \u2014 you\u2019re getting training from British and from Polish?",
        "A: ...and from Polish, we\u2019re getting training. So my 17 were re-indoctrinated, re-\nbrainwashed and trained in sabotage and demolition. The whole 17. They were bright ki\u2014\nI mean, of course we were bright kids. We got to brag about it a lot, I mean we used to\nbrag a lot about it. \u201cWe are the best of the best.\u201d Were trained in sabotage and demolition\nand the underground work. We were put in small groups. We went back to Poland.",
        "Q: Before we go back to Poland, I want to know a little bit more about what the training was\nlike. Take us through a day of training.",
        "A: The training was in the morning, was calisthenics. There was a five mile run. There were\nfour hours of lectures, in \u2014 mostly about small arms training and the firefights. Mostly\nfirefights, being surrounded \u2014 being surrounded by a superior group and getting out.\nConstantly, constantly, constantly.",
        "Q: You mean how to escape when you\u2019re surrounded?",
        "A: How, how to fight your way out. How to fight your way out. Then in afternoon was\nanother lecture, which was a political lecture, whom we have to fight. Then of course,\nkind of a \u2014 the lecture would, would tell about how we do fight the Germans. \u201cBut, if you\nwant to, you can fight the damn Russians, too.\u201d And by nightfall, you fell sleepy, you fell\noff your feet, you slept. And the same and the same. And then sabotage, blowing up\nbridges, blowing up trains, blowing up buildings. Demolishing rail \u2014 train tracks, if you\ndid not have explosives. And a lot \u2014 a lot of training with semi and automatic weapons. It\nwas a time when the British introduced a sten gun and we trained a lot with the sten guns.\nWe trained little with regular rifles, but they said, \u201c\u201cWhen you get there, we will provide\nyou with sten guns, you will have a lot of firepower.\u201d And a sten gun is similar to\nAmerican Thompson submachine gun. But it\u2019s a piece of junk, actually. You shoot about\n1700 rounds and you throw it away, because after 1700 rounds, becomes more dangerous\nto you than to your pos\u2014 opponent. Anyway, seven of us went on a trip. We walked, we\nrode trains, we hitched up rides on the tracks. We rode donkeys most of the time. We\nwent through the western Iran, into northern Iraq. We went through the Kurdistan. By the\nway, the Kurdish people are the greatest people ever. They can cut your head off, if you\nhave \u2014 if you have something they like, but if you come in, it is so much like in \u2014 in\nPoland, \u201cGuest in, God in.\u201d They treat you like you were a god visit-visiting them. They\ngive you food. They give you \u2014 what they have, they share with you. If you are ragged,\nthey will give you shirt or pair of pants. But don\u2019t look at anything good they have,\nbecause they will give it to you. If you look at something, \u201cOh gee, this is so neat.\u201d They\nwill let you sleep with his \u2014 with his wife if you like her. But you get out of a tent, they\nwill follow you, cut your head off and take the stuff back. So we\u2019re told, \u201cBe careful with\nthe Kurds.\u201d\nAnyway, we walked through part of Turkey, we diverted into Syria and backed in\nAnatolia, Turkey, Anatolia. We did come to Bosporus Straits and we were kind of\npursued at that time, we knew something was happening. We were being hunted. So we\nmet a old fisherman on the Bosporus and he spoke Russian. He was an old Turk who\nspoke Russian. And said, \u201cGrandpa, please take us across.\u201d And he said, \u201cLords, night 1s\nfalling, there\u2019s going to be storm tonight, we cannot get a \u2014 go across.\u201d \u201cGrandpa, please\ntake us across, because we \u2014 if we don\u2019t leave here tonight, we may not be alive\ntomorrow. We know something is happening.\u201d The German had a Intelligence pe\u2014\nIntelligence people in Turkey and they organized pursuit parties, we overheard before\nthen. So he said, \u201cWell, Lords, I\u2019m old, my boat is leaky and if you want to risk, what am\nI to say?\u201d So we said, \u201cGrandpa, we\u2019ll pay you.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to be paid.\u201d So we said,\n\u201cGrandpa, we\u2019ll give you the donkeys.\u201d \u201cDonkeys, they\u2019re not worth anything. They are\nworn up completely.\u201d Said, \u201cGrandpa, you give them on a p \u2014 good grass, they\u2019 Il be as\ngood as new in two or three weeks. Leave them here.\u201d We got in the boat, he gave each a\n\u2014 each one of us a piece of rope. \u201cTie yourself ti\u2014 s \u2014 well.\u201d Storm came. It was the\nscariest five hours I lived in my life \u2014 scariest. I was in dark places, but this was the\nworst. I think I fell out about four times. If it wasn\u2019t for rope, I wouldn\u2019t be talking to you\ntonight. The Mediterranean fish would have eaten me up. Anyway, we did get to the\nTurkish side on the north side of \u2014 it was almost morning. Beautiful, quiet, sun was\ncoming up. And the old Ismael said, \u201cLords, the Allah was with you. I don\u2019t want to be\npaid.\u201d But before we left, the British gave us some gold pieces. \u201cCase you\u2019re in a tight\nspot, trading, whatever.\u201d So we said, \u201cGrandpa, we don\u2019t want to pay you, we just want\nto give you baksheesh, a gift from the heart.\u201d And each one of us gave him a gold piece.\nHe looked, said, \u201cOh my Allah. My granddaughter will get married, my younger\ndaughter will get married, my grandson get married, I can pay dowry to every one of\nthem and I\u2019m going to live high on the hog for the rest of my days.\u201d He got in his boat\nand a little breeze came, he just zoomed out of there.\nAnd we walked across a part of Turkey, went into Bulgaria, we caught rides on trains \u2014\ntracks, we head into Romania. We sneaked into Nazi occupied Poland. You know, the\nfront li\u2014 eastern front was way, way out. By that time, on Polish territory, the Germans\ndeveloped Einsatzgruppen,\u201d\u00ae special forces. They call them Einsatzgruppen or\nVernichtungsgruppen,\u201d\u2019 the exterminators. So they were killing lot of Jewish people and\nthey were killing all the Jewish people they could find. And they were killing a lot of\nPolish people. So the Polish underground suffered for a time. But then, when we came,\nthey provided us with arms and ammunition and some unstable Polish dynamite. And we\n\u2014 each one of us \u2014 I was given 17 people. Seventeen plus two, plus \u2014 plus me. That were\n20 people. And we became the exterminators of exterminators. We would create false\nalarms. Because when something happen in certain village or little town, they would just\nswoop upon it. They \u2014 those groups were about 100, 75 to 125 in each group. They\nwould swoop around, swoop in, surround it, burn it down, kill everybody. That was their\nstandard procedure. And when they went to a ghetto, they would just kill all the Jewish\npeople in the ghetto. Of course, ghettos were already fenced in \u2014 barbed wired in. So we\ndid few things with them and we blew up \u2014 we could not blow up \u2014 blow up complete\nbridge, but we blew up parts of a bridge. We demolished a lot of railroad tracks. We blew\nup some trains when we had explosives. And I was \u2014 oh, my gosh, my commander was a\n\u2014I still don\u2019t know his name. His name was, was \u201cB. Dab\u201d \u2014 \u201cB. the Old Oak.\u201d He said,\n\u201cYou little shit, \u2019m going to shoot you, I\u2019m going to court martial you, you missed it.\u201d I\nwould sit in a field with the two wires and a battery, holding here and I would touch it\nand the damn thing would not explode and the train would go by. Or sometime I would\nblow it up before the train came. So after each incident \u2014 mishap like this, he would gave\nme a dressing and threaten me with, with an execution and court martial and God knows\nwhat. He was a big, fat man with a very sharp temper.\n*\u00ae Task forces (German); mobile killing units, employed especially in the destruction of the\nJewish communities of Eastern Europe.\n*\u2019 Annihilation group (German)\nAnd we slept in bunks. We slept on farms that were far away from habitations. We had\ndugouts in half a dozen different forests. Run around constantly. We did get surrounded a\nlot of times. We had to fight \u2014 were in lot of firefights with those groups. Were\nsurrounded frequently by them and had to fight our way out. And about \u2014 in 1943, it was\n\u201842, fall and winter when we started. Forty-three, in late spring, we hijacked German\narmy bank on a street of Warsaw. We lost three people out of about 25 or 30 that were \u2014\nbut we got a lot of money. We got about 15 million marks. Each one was \u2014 one of us was\ngiven a bonus, and you were given operating expenses. I think we \u2014 my group got about\nhalf a million marks. And I had a drinking buddy, who was a young, German soldier,\nsupply officer. So we had drinks, we met few times. I introduced him to some Polish\ngirls. And we talked and he sold me about over 100 Schmeissers. Schmeisser 1s a light,\nautomatic weapon, similar to American Thompson submachine gun, but much, much\nmore effective. Much more effective. And I don\u2019t know how many, probably about 12,\n15 million rounds of ammunition. So from then on, my little group of 17 plus three were\ncarrying 27 Schmeissers, because some of the boys said, \u201cI don\u2019t trust that damn German\nweapon, I want to carry two.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, you know, we have a \u2014 we join \u2014 we\nshared those with some other groups, but we have plenty of it in places, hidden places. If\nyou want to carry 17 extra pounds, what am I to say? Go ahead, be my guest.\u201d The\nGerman groups \u2014 ordinarily each squad had one Schmeisser and the rest of them had\nmanual Mauser rifles. So when we \u2014 from then on, we \u2014 on purpose, did \u2014 when it cato\u2014\ncame to firefight, let ourselves be surrounded. And then when we opened up, we went\njust like a hot knife through a piece of butter. They had to keep their heads down, or they\nlost them. And anybody who stuck their head up did not get up again. So we went out\nand went out and went out and \u2014 course we were losing people. At the start we lost like\n11 people in two months. So the boys who were in my group said, \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWell, I tried to train you, you refused to be trained. You think you know\neverything. You were as full of beans, you want to fight, well do \u2014 surely we fight, but\nare going to lose people constantly if you don\u2019t want to train.\u201d So they said, \u201cDo anything\nthat \u2014 to train us.\u201d So we did. For about four weeks, we got the guts out of ourselves. We\ndid it the British way. The way the British Major Thompson did to us, we did to\nourselves. From then on we became almost invincible. We would lose a person from time\nto time, but very, very seldom.",
        "Q: You took some time and sort of dropped back in the countryside and \u2014",
        "A: We drop back to countryside, we took a week or two off, then we \u2014 most of the time we\nfound the places we wanted to take care of ourselves. Sometime our commander would\ncontact us and gave us \u2014 gave us an order to do this or to do that. And there was a \u2014 one\nof the Eisengrupp \u2014 Eisens \u2014 Eis \u2014 Einsatzgruppen in neighborhood where my \u2014 not\nexactly my own family neighborhood, but close by. It was in a town called Biala\nPodlaska. It was about 100 kilometers east of Warsaw. There was the group that was\nlarge, it was very well entrenched. Very, very foxy, we just couldn\u2019t do anything to them.\nSo he called me the carpet and he said, \u201cYou are supposed to take care of that group. You\ndon\u2019t sa\u2014 you don\u2019t have to kill all of them, but really give them a good thrashing.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cCommander, I tried \u2014 we tried everything, I tried everything, nothing works.\u201d Said,\n\u201cYou have to do something.\u201d \u201cThey are entrenched. They stay in a solid building, which\nused to be monastery, with a great gate. They built a wall around, there\u2019s some barbed\nwire on the top of it. There\u2019s electricity in the barbed wire. We just can\u2019t touch them.\u201d So\nhe said, \u201cWell, we can, come on here.\u201d Led me to the next room, open a wardrobe and he\nsaid, \u201cLook at this. You see this nice, little Hitlerjugend\u201d\u00b0 uniform?\u201d And I said, \u201cOh, no\nyou don\u2019t.\u201d Said, \u201cOh yes, I do.\u201d And as you can see, I was a little blonde boy \u2014 little\nblonde boy, this one on the right. This one here, with blue eyes and very, very bleached,\nbleached hair. So he said, \u201cPut it on.\u201d So I put the thing, fitted me just right and a little \u2014\nlittle \u2014 little jacket, shorts, you know. High socks, hobnail boots, little dagger, little hat.\nSaid, \u201cThere, you look like a damn German Hitlerjugend.\u201d So I didn\u2019t have much choice.\nIn the afternoon, the boys brought me within about two or three blocks from that\nmonastery. I just walked toward the gates, there were two burly SS men with the\nSchmeissers standing by the gate. And I said, \u201cHeil Hitler, Heil Hitler.*! Wie geht\u2019s denn,\nJunge*\u201d\u201d \u201cGanz gut.*\u201d \u201cHow are you young man?\u201d \u201cVery well.\u201d \u201cWie geht\u2019s denn, Herr\nOberst.**\u201d How about you, Commander? \u201cGanz gut.\u201d So I said, \u201cI - Ich wiinschte mit ihre\nofficer gesprochen.\u201d\u201d\u201d I want to speak to your officer, your commander here. \u201cWeiter-\nweitermachen.*\u00b0\u201d \u201cGo right in.\u201d So I went in, I went through the corridors, I went up the\nsteps, I went to the back there and there was an outside window, I unlatched the window.\nI went downstairs again, I went to the back and I notice there\u2019s a gate there with a bolt, so\nI pulled the bolt slowly out. Then I went to the corr\u2014 second floor again \u2014 again had to go\nto second floor to go to the front, so I walked. There was some secretaries running out\nand some officers running back and forth. \u201cHeil Hitler, Heil Hitler, Junge.\u201d\u2019 Wie\ngeht\u2019s.\u201d>\u201d I walked out. Said, \u201cAuf wiedersehen,\u201d\u201d\u201d to those nice, two, big son of a so and\nso in the front. Walked out to the corner, walked beyond \u2014 about a block away, the boys\nare waiting with the car, they grabbed me, we ran away. I was so mad at myself. I wet my\n\u201d Hitler youth (German); Nazi youth organization.\n*! Hail Hitler (German)\n* How are you then, young man? (German)\n* Very good (German)\n\u201c How are you then, Mr. Colonel? (German)\n\u00a9 T wish to spoke [sic] with your officer. (German)\n*\u00b0 Continue (German)\n*\u201d Young man (German)\n*S How are you? (German)\n\u201d Good-bye (German)\npants. My pants were wet, my socks were wet, my shoes were squelching. I must have\nbeen afraid. And strange enough, I was in tougher places. I was being shot at, I was being\nhit, I was being mutilated, practically, but this must have been scary time that I had had.\nWas first and the last time that I wetted my pants. That night we came in and the\ncommander came with us. B. Dab came with us. He said, \u201cYou know where everything\nis, SO you go in.\u201d So I went with my big rucksack. And then we came with a ladder, we\u2019re\ngoing to climb to that window there.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We\u2019re outside of\nMinneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape five.\nSo you were going into the\u2014?",
        "A: Yes, lucky enough, they did not board the back door. But we came with big oil cans and\nwe Oiled all the hinges, you know, and \u2014 and my commander said, \u201cWell, you know\nwhere everything is, you will go in.\u201d Said, \u201cMe? Was supposed to be somebody else\ngoing in.\u201d \u201cOh, shut up and go in.\u201d So I went in, I set sev\u2014 set up 17 charges, one for\neach boy in the outfit and we blew the place sky high. It just blew up. There was a\narmory, and I notice where it was, I put a charge on the door to the armory. Whatever\nthey had there \u2014 it must have been a lot of explosives \u2014 blew up. And of course, some of\nthem were running out of the front gate and the back gate and we met them in the street,\ntoo. And I don\u2019t know how many were left, but there were some left, I presume. And of\ncourse, then we took off and \u2014 and got the hell out of there. That was a feather in my hat.",
        "Q: Where would you go after something like that?",
        "A: We just went out for \u2014 far away from it, as far as we could from the neighborhood.\nSometime we had horses, sometime we had horse-wagons. Occasionally we would have a\ntruck, produce truck that we \u201cborrowed\u201d from the Germans. Well, we would just stop a\ndriver and take him away and appropriate the truck. Take his uniform and one of us\nwould dress in it and we would have it ready after a job like this. And actually, this thing,\nstrange enough, did not have many repercussions. \u201cThe armory blew up. There\u2019s \u2014\nsomething happen, the armory blew up.\u201d The German papers were saying, \u201cthe armory\nblew up and some of our people were hurt.\u201d",
        "Q: Maybe they didn\u2019t want to acknowledge that there was \u2014",
        "A: They did not want to acknowledge, apparently. So then we had a week of rest. My\ncommander said, \u201cNow you deserve a rest.\u201d And I said, \u201cAre you going to gift me with\nthat Hitlerjugend uniform?\u201d \u201cOh no, that is useful \u2014 that will be for somebody else. You\npissed it, you so and so.\u201d I said, \u201cListen Dab, I was scared.\u201d \u201cWell, I think you were\nscared, but you should have been scared before hand, not when you were right there.\u201d",
        "Q: What did you do when you had a week off? A week of rest, as you put it.",
        "A: Occasionally, I would visit my family, but very seldom. But most of the time I would\nstay in the forest and enjoy it and bring some good food and have a drinking party. And\noccasionally we\u2019d have a drinking party with the Mongol people. Wanted \u2014wanted to\ndemolish a track, or a trail, demolish a train. And the Germans had the Mongolians, from\nouter Mongolia, who volunteered to serve the Germans. They placed them along the\nrailroad tracks to guard it. So, when we wanted to blow up a train, we just go for about\ntwo or three kilometers and collect bunch of those people and invite them to a party.\nCourse they had to come if they wanted or not. They didn\u2019t want to get shot. So we\nwould provide a few gallons of moonshine and some smoked meat and a lot of bread,\nwe'd have a party with them, get them roaring drunk and then we would wait for the \u2014 we\nknew when the train that \u2014 in question was coming in there, with armament or with a\ngroup of soldiers going to the eastern front. And we would try to blow it up. Sometimes\nsucceeded, sometime not. After we \u2014 after not, my commander would call on me and\nsaid, \u201cYou little so and so, what\u2019s the matter with you? Losing your touch?\u201d I said, \u201cYes,\nsir, 1am losing my touch.\u201d \u201cLet that not happen again.\u201d \u201cYes sir, 1t will never happen\nagain.\u201d If it happened next time, he said, \u201cYou forgot you said never again.\u201d \u201cWell\u201d, said,\n\u201cwell, I thought I \u2014 maybe I would be dead before next time.\u201d",
        "Q: Were you wearing uniforms at all, or were you \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 just \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You were in \u2014 how \u2014 how did that work? Were you \u2014 and then in civilian clothes?",
        "A: We had civilian clothes. We had kind of a sports \u2014 like a sweatsuit set, something similar\nto it. Somebody of a got hold of German overalls. Occasionally \u2014 later \u2014 later on, after we\nappropriated a lot of German uniforms, those that were not very bloody, we would \u2014 we\nwould wear. Matter of fact, we had them tailored, beautiful tailored. We had a Jewish\ntailor, Mr. \u2014 Mr. Grzebien, who could make a beautiful fitting outfit, regardless what it\nwas. And poor Mr. Grzebien did not make it.",
        "Q: So \u2014 so if you \u2014 I guess what I\u2019m trying to get a sense of 1s, were you openly an army unit\nin Poland?",
        "A: No, we were not.",
        "Q: Or were you \u2014 you were passing as civilians and then at certain times you\u2019d go\u2014",
        "A: We were passing a \u2014 we were passing as civilians.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But most of the time we stayed a unit \u2014 we stayed as unit and went constantly from \u2014 we\ndid not stay in one place for more than two nights, went from place to place and found\nthe places to hit and found the places to demolish or got orders to move here or to move\nthere. And then, after we felt that we were too unnerved, we would st\u2014 we would take a\nfew days rest. Occa-occasionally some of us would go for a short visit, but very seldom\nbecause Germans had also quite good Intelligence. And they had a lot of local people\nwho were reporting to them. So you had to be careful where you go, when you go. Like,\nfor instance, I don\u2019t know if I was that religious, but frequently on Sunday I would sneak\ninto the church, to my pastor. And he was friend of mine, I read all his books. I read all\nthe books in the public library and school library and I discovered he had a big library, so\nI read all of his books and I served Mass. Oh my God, I served Mass forever, I was 19\nand 20, I still served Mass. So he would say, \u201cOh Stefan, come on, serve the Mass.\u201d\n\u2018Father, I can\u2019t. I messed up last night, I blew up a train. There were people on that train\n\u2014,\u201d or else I did something. \u201cCome on, I\u2019Il listen to your confe\u2014 I'll hear your confession.\nCome on, serve the Mass.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m too old.\u201d \u201cOh, you\u2019re so little, nobody will know.\u201d\nSo he gave me key to the wardrobe, he kept, \u201cPut your \u2014 put your items in a ke\u2014\u201d I put \u2014\nput my trench coat and my Schmeisser and a bunch of boxes of my magazines of\nammunition in his wardrobe, lock it up, serve the Mass. And then he said, \u201cOkay, now\nyou can go.\u201d So before he walked out, I would go into sacristy, unlock, jump out of a\nwindow and disappear. He was a good old man.",
        "Q: Do you remember his name?",
        "A: Yeah, Ksiadz\u201d\u2019 Miazga.",
        "Q: This was your parish priest?",
        "A: My parish priest, Ksiadz Miazga. He was older. He was patriotic. And I would tell him\nthat I really can\u2019t serve Mass, nor can I go to communion \u2014 what I did. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep\nnights, my conscience bothers me, cause some of the people that we exterminated were\nnot really willingly going there.\u201d Said, \u201cEverybody who is Ein\u2014 in Einsatzgruppe went\nwillingly. And if you did kill some soldiers on the train, some officers, this is a war.\u201d\nAnyways, I still occasionally spend sleepless night. So, it lasted \u2014 1t was good when it\nlasted. And then in spring, early spring of 1944, I was caught in a lapanka. Lapanka is a\nround-up, like they caught slaves in Africa, like they go hunting and have a \u2014 surround\nmeters and hunters. In Poland, the lapanka was an institution. The group of German\nSchutzpolizei\u00b0' would stop a train or a bus, mostly train, get everybody out, fish out all\n\u00bb\u00b0 Priest (Polish)\n>! Conventional police (German)\nthe young people, put them in trucks, take them to process, processing, transit, camp\nbuilding. And in our district, was the Skaryszewska, it was an \u2014 name after the \u2014 after the\nstreet in Warsaw, \u201cSkaryszewska\u201d \u2014 processed you and sent you to compulsory labor in\nGermany. It was called the \u201cfree labor.\u201d So I left what I was carrying \u2014 I was carrying a\nsuitcase of dynamite and some wiring, so I left it on the train. It was \u2014 I was a little boy,\ncaught on a train traveling between Warsaw and \u2014 and whatever.\nAnd of course I was sent to western part \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, eastern part of Germany, Silesia.\nThen there was almost like a \u2014 like a slave market. They took us to that Kreuzburg town,\nsmall town like a county town, Kreuzburg. We were kept \u2014 put in a \u2014 1n a building next to\na square \u2014 there we be walked out to the square and then farmers and people from\ndifferent little factories, shops and so on, would come. \u201cI\u2019ll take this one, I\u2019ll take that\none, I\u2019ll take that one.\u201d \u201cOkay. Here\u2019s your ai\u2014,\u201d they filled out an arbeitbuch,\u201d a little\nwork book for you \u2014 your name and your employers name and you went and you were\nservant to that person. If you got to be on a farm, it wasn\u2019t too bad, because you had\nenough to eat. A group of us \u2014 the group of us, about 25 boys and 23 girls, between like\n13 and 19 or so, were put in a village called Schorka and we worked in a forest, natching\nout the trees, pine trees and collecting the resin. Resin was used by German industry for\nmaking synthetic rubber. So we worked there about eight hours a day, worked in a group\nwith a supervisor. And sometime the Stadtpolizei?\u2019 worked with us, they try and they did\nnot. So, some of us would be escaping now and then, of course, they would be\napprehended and brought back and so on and so forth. And I worked there for, oh,\nprobably three or four weeks. So a small group of us took off and went away. So, \u201cI\nwould \u2014 won\u2019t work for the damn Germans here. Let us go home.\u201d And the home was a\ngeneral government the center of Poland, which was so called \u201cFree Poland,\u201d it was\nunder \u2014 it was a protectorate, Hans Frank was the gover-governor and it was run by the\nGermans, for the Germans, by the Germans and the Poles who were there had to give\neverything that they produced, they raised on the farm and so on, to the German war\neffort. But you were kind of semi-free. Anyway, those of us who were in the underground\nwere free because we could go anyplace we want to.",
        "Q: So you just walked away from Schorka \u2014 from the resin work camp?",
        "A: Yes, yes. I w \u2014 just walked away. Partway home, close to town called Lubliniec and\ncloser to little town called Blachownia, we split \u2014 we got chased by some\nVolksdeutsche\u2122 people with shotguns. And I ran into couple young boys and they were\n*?

So we talked, we introduced ourselves. And he says, \u201cHow come\n\u2014,\u201d asked, \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d \u201cOh, I am from Warsaw district.\u201d \u201cHow come you\u2019re\nhere?\u201d \u201cWell, I got caught, spend time in Germany, now I\u2019m escaping.\u201d \u201cOkay, come\nwith us, we have a job to do. Are you \u2014 do you know anything about wet works?\u201d \u201cOh, a\nlittle.\u201d \u201cWell, you know, there is a Gestapo man who is such a son of a bitch, he mistreats\npeople, he beats people, he shot some people, he killed some people during interrogation.\nAnd we want to do something willa\u2014 with him, but we are not \u2014 we got the sentence,\ndeath sentence for him from the \u2014 our underground authorities, the NSZ.\u201d The National \u2014\nNSZ, which was the National Armed Forces. Narodowe Sily Zbrojne,\u201d\u00b0 in Polish. That\nwas the \u2014 kind of a rightish wing of the Polish underground. The Armia Krajowa\u2019\u2019 \u2014 the\nHome Army was kind of a middle \u2014 the A.L., A.L. \u2014 Armia Ludowa\u201d\u00ae were the\nCommunists and we were the \u2014 toward the right somewhat. \u201cWell, we are NSZ \u2014 we are\nNSZ and we have problems, we don\u2019t know how to proceed, so we -,\u201d I stayed with them\nfor a few days and got some arms from them and instructed them and they were still\nafraid, so we did \u2014 we went and we did the job, according to the rules.\nWe met him in a park, with a wife and two children, one was in a carriage, one was\nwalking. So we ask him to excuse himself and we excuse the lady and we walk him a\nshort distance, we read him the sentence. And of course after we left, he \u2014 he was dead.\nAnd I should have known better, I should have gotten the hell out of there, but I stayed\nfor a few more days and there was somebody who reported. And they came and I was so\nwell trained and I became sloppy. I was too lucky for too long. I survived too long. I\nbecame sloppy and careless and my goose was cooked. I stayed with a family in a\nBlachownia \u2014 Blachstadt(ph) in German. And it was kind of a storage room in a\nbackyard, I stayed there. And they came at about one a.m. We had a shootout. Two of\nthose two who first came in, one was dead and one was badly wounded. And they shot\nacross and they killed another one of their own. And I jumped out of a window, I thought\nI would \u2014 I was free to get out. And then I got hit from behind. I don\u2019t know what\nhappened after that. When I was up to \u2014 I had a few broken ribs. I was badly kicked and\nmutilated, practically trampled into the soil in that little garden there. And then \u2014 that my\n\u2014my gar \u2014 goose got cooked. They transported me to Lubliniec, which was a district\ntown and a investigator came from my neighborhood, east of Warsaw.",

        "A: German, yeah. Gestapo officer came from Warsaw. He was Ph.D. from Heidelberg\nUniversity. He was highly educated person. And he joined the Nazi party, of course. He\ndidn\u2019t know any better. And he became special investigator for the Gestapo. He\nintroduced himself and when he came in, the people who led him in, they said, \u201cWhere\nyou from?\u201d So he told them. And said, \u201cYou know, wir hat die schlange, wir hat die\nschlange.\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cWe have the snake.\u201d Because where I came from, they call me the\nschlange\u201d\u2019 \u2014 the schlange, yeah the Germans. Because I lived forever and lasted foreve-\nforever, so they called me the snake. \u201cWir hat die schlange.\u201d We talked for five days and\nfor five nights. He would not let me sleep. He would go and take a nap now and then,\nsomebody else talked to me. After five 24 hour talks, he said, \u201cYou know, I think we\nbecame friends and I th\u2014 and I thought you were going to tell me everything that you\nknow. Really, \u2019'm your friend. I don\u2019t want to hurt you, I want to do anything. But you\ndidn\u2019t tell me a damn thing. So we\u2019ll try something else.\u201d And I was just out of my \u2014\ncompletely out of myself. I was sleepy, I was hungry, I was thirsty. So the first thing he\ndid \u2014 he would \u2014 they would give me a little water now and then, but I don\u2019t think I ate\nanything for those five days and five nights. So then the first thing he did, he brought a\nbig dish of ice water and gave me a big spoon. He said, \u201cSit and eat. If you don\u2019t finish it\noff, \u2019'm going to shoot you right here.\u201d The most horrible thing in you life can be eating\nice water with a spoon. What \u2014 it was probably a gallon and a half, maybe two gallons. If\nyou try sometime, this is almost like a Chinese torture, maybe even worse. I ate the whole\ndarn thing. And I was just getting out of my mind. So he would not let me go to the\nbathroom, so I just sat in a chair and made a big puddle on the floor, several times.\nAnd then he called two men \u2014 two big, strong men and they gave me hell for about two\nhours. I was in and out several times. I didn\u2019t know what was happening to me. Then\nthey would pour a pile of water on me, I would come back to it and they gave me \u2014 and\nbeat me again. So then he asked questions and I apparently didn\u2019t tell him very much, so\nhe said, \u201cOkay, take him in a swing.\u201d So they took my clothes off, they tied my hands on\nand \u2014 my hands like this, put a broomstick here, put it on the top of the stools and I was\nswinging back and forth. And one of them was swinging hose, rubber hose, hitting my\nbehind. \u201cAnd talk and tell me this and tell me that. Well, you know about si\u2014 something\nabout this?\u201d So I was prepared, I told him blue streak. I told him \u2014 oh, I told him tall\nstories. All the people, all the names, who were dead. So then he left me \u2014 left me alone\nand he went and checked and he came back. He said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me a thing.\u201d So\nthey gave me beating again and beating again and beating again. And then he said, \u201cWell,\nthat\u2019s enough, we are ready.\u201d So I had a \u2014 and normally, I mean, they just took out \u2014 they\nshoot you. They shoot everybody in the neighborhood and this case, they wanted to be so\nlegalistic, they wanted to be so exact, that I had a case in court. I had a defense attorney,\n~\u201d We has [sic] the snake (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Snake (German)\nMr. Heinrich Schmidt. Yeah, Heinrich Schmidt. And he was telling \u2014 he was talk to the\ncourt \u2014 it was the Volksgericht.\u00b0' People who did not have any training in law, appointed\nby the German authorities to deal punishment sentences. So, my attorney was asking for\nthree death sentences. And the \u2014 I don\u2019t remember \u2014 or did \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I ever knew\nthe name of the judge. He said, \u201cTwo, enough. Zwei ganz genug. Zwei ganz genug.\u00b0\u201d So\nhe gave me two death sentences. And then he stamped \u201cN and N\u201d on my document. \u201cN\nand N\u201d is, is \u201cNacht und Nebel.\u00ae\u201d \u201cNight and fog.\u201d\nA person who got a sentence \u2014 who even did not get a sentence, but had an N and N on\nhis documents, he was sent to concentration camp, he was finished off \u2014 taken to the gas\nchamber or given an injection \u2014 phenol injection. Or went to the bunker to starve to\ndeath, or got mutilated or got hung in a \u2014 in a camp square. His documents were\ndestroyed. His ashes were \u2014 his family was not notified to send seven marks for the\nashes. You disappeared just like in a night and fog. So I was the Nacht und Nebel baby. I\nstayed in prison, in Lubliniec for two, three weeks. I healed. I could sleep on my back.\nWhen I got there, I could sleep only on my stomach. There were 17 of us in a two person\ncell. We slept like sardines 1n a can on the floor. And the one who was the latest, had to\nsleep next to kiibel. And kiibel was a garbage pail that everybody emptied themselves.\nSo I slept next to the ktbel for about a week. And of course I advanced, later on. But\nafter about two or three nights, they looked at me, at my back and they said, \u201cWell,\nmaybe you should move little here. Maybe we can put you in that corner, there,\u201d \u2018cause I,\n\u201cyou don\u2019t look so great.\u201d",
        "Q: What do you think gave you strength to endure that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I was ornery. I was so damn patriotic. And I was very strongly religious.\nAnd I was very ornery.",
        "Q: Good combination.",
        "A: Yes. It was a good combination.",
        "Q: Did you pray during those days?\n\u00b0! People\u2019s court (German); treason court instituted for the prosecution of enemies of the Third\nReich.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Two total, enough. (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Night and Fog (German)\n** Pail (German)",
        "A: Yes, I did. I prayed a lot. And I \u2014 actually I never prayed for anything. I prayed \u2014 I still\nhave a ta\u2014 hard time praying for anything. Like for instance, presently I pray in\nthanksgiving that I\u2019m still alive, can take nourishment, I can run a mile, I can skate, I can\ndo some skiing. And I\u2019m 75 and counting. So I never prayed for something, not even for\nrelease, not even for a longer life. I knew I wouldn\u2019t live to be 20. I was sure I would\nnever live to be, to, to, to be ninet\u2014 19 and a half or 20. I was \u2014 by that time I was almost\n19. I never \u2014 I knew I was not going to live. But I prayed and I was so thankful that I was\nstill alive. Anyway, after the sentence, I stayed there in a prison for a short time, then I\nwent on a transport to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, which is in western Poland\npresently. At that time it was in eastern East Germany, close to Opole, German Oppeln. I\nwas there in transit, in the block number 12, which was a subterranean block. It was a\ntime \u2014 it was just a time when Polish Prince Radziwill\u201d was sent to Gross-Rosen. The\nGermans wanted him to from Polish government under German auspices and he refused.\nSo they sent him to concentration camp. He was a brother-in-law of Mrs. Kennedy.\nKennedy\u2019s \u2014 Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s sister married one of the \u2014 his \u2014 that Polish Prince\nRadziwill, who was in Great Britain then. Anyway, Prince Radziwill came with a servant.\nAnd after they were told that sup \u2014 they took him \u2014 the ser\u2014 took the servant away. They\ngave a black number, black triangle and sent him to the stone quarry. And the person who\nreceived black triangle was \u2014 went to sa\u2014 to stone quarry, was not to survive. So his Kapo\ntold him, \u201cPrince, I\u2019m going to kill you, over the next week or two, so if you want to\njump, go ahead.\u201d So he jumped.",

It\u2019s conducted \u2014 this interview is conducted by Katie Davis and\nthis is tape number six. First of all, I just want to say that this is May 1994, about and you\nwere just telling the story of the prince. How, how \u2014 you didn\u2019t witness that, but\u2014",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have to witness, but I spoke to one people who had a black number and was\nin the quarry. He came and by that time I developed a friendship with a Blockiltester,\u201d\u00b0\nwho was a Polish young boy, who was killing people right and left, to survive. Killing\nprisoners right and left, to survive. When I first came, we got into that barrack, we were\nput three people to the bunk and a bunk was about two and a half foot wide. Three people\nto a bunk and bunks were three piles high. So I went in the corner between the bunk and I\nstood against the wall, because my back, my seat, my \u2014 was kind of awful. And the\nBlockaltester was a young Warsaw boy who became a killer to survive. He came and he\nsaid, \u201cWhat do you think you are doing, you stupid so and so?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I am\nresting.\u201d \u201cGet in the bunk.\u201d I said, \u201cBlockaltester, I cannot get in a bunk.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d\nSo, I turned around and lifted my clothes. \u201cUh-huh. Come on.\u201d So normally, when you\nsaid, \u2018come on\u2019, you were going to get 25 with a ax handle or \u2014 or a \u2014 or a rubber\ntruncheon. So he led me to his little room and he said, \u201cTake your clothes and lay down.\u201d\nSo \u2014 \u201cThis is my bunk, lay down.\u201d So I lay down and he brought a \u2014 a towel, he brought\na pail of water. He washed my back. He had some kind of an ointment that he put on me.\nAnd he said, \u201cYou cannot turn, can you?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I cannot turn.\u201d \u201cOkay, you can\nsleep on my stomach. I can go and get my \u2014 see my girlfriend.\u201d So he went. Before\nmorning he came back and said, \u201cNow you can go back there and be one of the prisoners.\nAnd don\u2019t let me catch you again standing there. Go to bed. Cause if you don\u2019t, PI kill\nyou.\u201d",
        "Q: Did he mean it?",
        "A: Yes, he did. There were some people who were in position, occasionally they would give\nyou \u2014 do you a favor. But don\u2019t ever ask them for a second favor, because that was the\nend of you. I met many people like that later \u2014 later on in Mauthausen. Anyway, I stayed\nthere for a short duration and just about the same time, a bishop from my archdiocese \u2014 I\ncan\u2019t ever remember his name, from Siedlce, came. He lasted only four days. They put\nhim into Strafkommando.\u00b0\u2019 People who were carrying big loads of stone with a\nwheelbarrow.

And he \u2014 the Kapo\u00ae beat him constantly. He survived either\nfour or five days. They beat him to death.",
        "Q: Were you working at that time?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry\u201d?",
        "Q: Were they having you work at that time?",
        "A: No, we stayed in the barrack. We were a kind of a zugang\u201d\u201d\u2019 people \u2014 new prisoners in\ntransit. So about \u2014 I can\u2019t even remember how many it was \u2014 eight or nine days, we put \u2014\nwere put on a transport and went, and went, and went all the way to Mauthausen. Came\nto Mauthausen, got shaved, got disinfected, went to the showers, were given a pair of\nclodhoppers, wooden shoes and a prison uniform and went to a barrack. Barracks zwei\nund zwanzig\u2019\u2019 \u2014 the first quarantine. There was a main camp and a first quarantine. First\nquarantine they had barracks 21, 22, 23. After that there was a wall, there was 24 and 25,\nbut those were the bunker barracks, where people went, never to get out. Anyway,\nbarrack 22 was the barrack of the people with \u201cN and N.\u201d So we went to a little chamber\nwhere they gave shots, phenol, derivative of gasoline. It is the most horrible death you\ncan ever have. You die for about 45 minutes. That courses through your veins, gets into\nyour heart several times, and you just die in a horrible torment. Just the worse thing ever.\nI saw dead people who died that way. They looked like the gargoyles on Notre-Dame\nCathedral. Or they went on a transport, or went to Gusen Zwei,\u2019' never to come out. Or\nthey went to gas chamber, or they went on special transport behind the front line. If\nsomething happened behind the front line, in a town or village, they would hang 10, 15,\n20 local hostages and let them hang there for \u2014 sometime for weeks. If they did not have\nlocal people, they would bring people from concentration camp and execute them there.\nBut for some strange reason, after a very short time, I was whisked out, my number was\nread, I was put by the gate with 500 people. We marched again to the train depot, which\nwas about like three, four kilometers, through the little town of Mauthausen. Put on a\ntrain and went to Vienna. And put in a concentration camp which was a sub-camp of\nMauthausen, 11\" Bezirk\u201d kolo Wiednia.\u201d And we\u2019re put to work in an armament\nfactory. It was an Ostermann-Sauer Werke, which built tractors and cars. It was a Swiss-\nAustrian-American company, built cars and trucks.

I was turning openings and grinding the huge blocks for the big, big heavy motor\nfor the \u2014 was a horrible work, it was 12 hours a day. The food was bad. Most of what we\nwere supposed to get, the people who handled it stole and ate and gorged themselves on.\nIt wasn\u2019t too bad, actually. When I think back, it wasn\u2019t too bad. I got beaten a few times\nby the SS men, but it wasn\u2019t too bad.",
        "Q: Why? What would you do that bothered them?",
        "A: Well, I think it\u2019s \u2014 you \u2014 you looked wrong way, he came and slugged you. And one time\n\u2014 oh, my gosh, I never forget that. There was a little SS man, my size \u2014 big, fat thing. He\nwas just kind of a, a roly-poly thing and he walked with a rifle. The rifle was three times\nas big as he is. And we walked the factory in a fives \u2014 you know, row \u2014 I mean fives \u2014 in\nkind of marching. And I look and I said, \u201cLook at that little son of a bitch. He is my size\nand he is so damn fat. If he falls over, he is going to roll forever.\u201d\u2019 And he understood\nPolish. And he got after me. And the boys hid me and we were just in the gate, so I ran\nquickly into the factory and got to my machine. And he was walking back and forth and\nwatching and walking, looking for me. And every time he walked, I would duck behind\nthe machine. I had a young Russian boy working with me, I would duck behind the\nmachine. And he never found me. He would have probably finished me.",

        "A: Yes, the situation was such, they had a \u2014 I was a, I was a bloody headache for them.\nBecause every four weeks, two big, burly SS people would bundle me up, take me on the\ntrain, we would go to Mauthausen, 120 kilometers in the train and I would be taken out to\nthe Politische Abteilung\u2019, Gestapo office outside of camp. I would be asked some\nquestions and I would get the treatment that I couldn\u2019t sit for next two weeks, and back to\nwork. Every four weeks, every four weeks.",
        "Q: They continued these interrogations and beatings?",
        "A: Interrogate my case. The reason why they didn\u2019t finish me off was because, \u201c\u201cYou\u2019re case\n\u2014Du kleine Schlange,\u201d\u00b0 your, your case is not yet finished. Your case is not yet finished,\nso we have to ask you a few more questions.\u201d",
        "Q: But what were they asking you?",
        "A: \u201cWell, what happened then? Did you blow the train? How many people in your group?\nGive me their names. Who was your commander? What are the other groups around?\nWhat did you go this place? When you go that place? How come \u2014 how come at one\ntime, you were by Smolensk? How come at one time you were by Minsk \u2014 the Soviet\nMinsk? Can you explain? Can you tell?\u201d",
        "Q: And what would you do?",
        "A: Well, I made the tall stories, I talk blue streak. I tried not to repeat myself, I tried not to\nchange what I told before. As I said, I do \u2014 I did have a good memory. I could memorize\npages and pages of \u2014 I could memorize the 45 minutes of a propaganda talk. I didn\u2019t miss\na word the second time. Anyway, and they would let me go. \u201cWell, that\u2019s enough for\nnow. We\u2019ll see you in four weeks.\u201d So the authorities in Vienna apparently got sick and\ntired of it, so for a time, they put me on a bomb squad. There were fifee\u2014 50 people and\nafter Americans started bombing Vienna \u2014 they came first in All Saint\u2019s Day, in 1944 and\nbombed the bejesus out of Vienna. They say there about 1200 American super fortress\ncame. You couldn\u2019t see sun, you couldn\u2019t see anything for three days \u2014 fires. And they\nkept burning \u2014 Bezirk, district, 21, 22 and 23. All those three days. And finally they hit \u2014\nthere was a Tiergarten,\u2019\u00b0 there was a park there and under the park there were enormous\ntanks \u2014 buried tanks of aviation gasoline. And they finally \u2014 the third night they hit, and\nthe thing was boiling horribly. Because my factory lost all the roof too and we worked,\nyou know, January \u2014 worked practically outside. We danced, we jumped. We tried to put\ncardboard in our jackets. If you got caught with a cardboard, you were beaten severely,\nsometimes shot. So finally they got tired of it, they took me back to Mauthausen.\n\u2122 Political division (German)\n\u00ae You little snake (German)\n\u2019\u00b0 Zoological garden (German)",
        "Q: I want to ask you a question about the interrogations, though. They \u2014 they went on for a\nlong time and they were brutal. Was there ever a point that you said, \u201cYou know, I can\u2019t\ndo this any more?\u201d",
        "A: Forget it. You do it. You do it. I tell him, \u201cI don\u2019t remember any more.\u201d \u201cOh, you\nremember a lot. We will try something else.\u201d So then something else, when I came back\nto Mauthausen, the first two days \u2014 I was on block 22 again. Block where people got \u2014\nwho were not supposed to leave. And two days later I was called in and there said, \u201cWell,\nwe'll try something else.\u201d So they made me take my shoes off and I\u2014 leaned me on a\nchair and beat my heels. And this is the most horrible feeling. When they hit your heel, it\nfeels like your brain wants to jump out. And \u2014 it was part of it \u2014 one of the stupid,\nuntrained henchmen hit my foot and broke a m \u2014 broke my \u2014 my \u2014 some bones in my\nfeet. Now I am a walking barometer. If \u2014 if the rain is coming tomorrow, I know there is\ngoing to be rain, because my foot bothers me. My heels were just like balloons. So I\ntalked to some prisoners there, they said, \u201cWe just yell a lot.\u201d So, as from then on,\nwhenever they took me there, before they hit me, I would scream bloody murder. I would\nyell, I would swear up and down. I would talk in Russian, I would talk in Polish. So they\nbrought Russian and Polish interpreter, thinking that I was going to spill something. I\nwould just talk blue streak. And I knew little Samoyed language, I would talk some\nSamoyed, cause then they would \u2014 later I\u2019m sitting down, \u201cWhat did you say then? What\ndid you say? What did you say then?\u201d I said, \u201cI was just complaining.\u201d \u201cWhat was the\nlanguage you are talking to?\u201d I said, \u201cI was talking in a language, probably Latin.\u201d\nBecause I \u2014 I had several years of Latin.",
        "Q: But when you got back, did anybody take care of you? You must have been really hurt\nwhen you would get back to the barracks.",
        "A: Oh, you were just dumped a barrack and you took care of yourself. I get some friends in\nthe barrack who occasionally would bring me some \u2014 like an ointment from the\nKrankenhaus.\u2019\u2019 Actually the block secretary was a Polish man who took pity upon me\nfrequently and he would bring me something. But I had a bunk all to myself, not two or\nthree people, but to myself. At least after \u2014 for a week or so after I was \u2014 I went through a\ntreatment. So I was in that barrack and was in a barrack and then of course and, and\nactually that interrogation and my \u201cN and N\u201d came \u2014 I mean it came to pass in late\nJanuary, I think.",

And I said, \u201cOh-oh. I\nguess my cooked \u2014 my goose has been cooked.\u201d So we were taken, 12 of us \u2014 we were\ntaken to Effektenkammer\u201d. Effektenkammer was that big warehouse with the best,\nbeautiful thing, that came with people who went directly to gas, were stored. Beautiful\nsuit, beautiful boots, silk underwear and so on. So we got dressed like a \u2014 dressed well. I\ngot silken underwear, I had beautiful socks. I had beautiful Hungarian boots. Woolen\nsuit, tie \u2014 silk tie, fur hat, fur coat. They would put us by the gate and the prisoners were\ncome in and said, \u201cMan, look at the bunch of Jewish barons. What did \u2014 where do those\ncome from?\u201d And one of my friends came by and I said, \u201cHey.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t hey me,\nyou so and so civilian.\u201d I said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d And he says, \u201cNo, what are\nyou doing in that stuff?\u201d I said, \u201cGod knows. I was dressed up.\u201d He said, \u201cUh-oh.\u201d\nAnyway, when we\u2019re \u2014 when we were in Effektenkammer, I had a friend \u2014 a friend who\nworks there because I work part time before then, in a Kanadakommando\u201d\u201d\u2019 sorting those\ngoods. So he gave me a bundle of jewelry. He said, \u201cIf you go on a trip, maybe you can\nbuy your way out.\u201d And he gave me a Polish marine knife. So I tucked it in. We\u2019re\nstanding there and pretty soon, SS squad came and we hiked to that depot, about three\nkilometers to the train and they put us in a prison compartments \u2014 went on a trip. And on\nthe train, there was one SS man who was coming back and forth \u2014 coming back and forth,\nlooking. And he came to a window, I, \u201cHerr, Herr Ober\u2014 Ober\u2014 Herr Oberst, can you tell\nme where we are going?\u201d And he looked, he said, \u201cWhat is u \u2014 what is worth to you?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cTwo carats?\u201d \u201cGanz gut. Hand it over.\u201d So I gave him a ring with a big diamond.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cLa himmel, la himmel.*\u2019\u201d \u201cTo paradise.\u201d He said, \u201cThere\u2019s a little town\neast of Oppeln \u2014 of Opole. Something happened behind the front line, they don\u2019t have\nlocal hostages, so you people are it. So you \u2014 normally, you know, they took you there,\nthey took you finery off, they put \u2014 put on you paper suits. They filled your mouth with a\n\u2014 with gypsum, so you couldn\u2019t yell, took you out and hanged you in a marketplace. So\nthat was it. Said, \u201cOh gosh, now I got to watch. I have that knife, I have all the jewelry.\u201d\nNothing do it \u2014 doing. Went to Vienna, they backed up prison van to the train and two\npeople with truncheons and two people with machine guns \u2014 into, into it, they drove into\n\u2014 us to the Elizabethpromenade \u2014 huge prison, put us in a cell. Next morning, likewise.\nPut us in a train. We went through Budejovice, we went as far as Brno in\nCzechoslovakia. They put us in old Franciscan monastery that was made into prison.

Bunch of Czech, pretty Czech\ngirls. They send me a paper, they send me a piece of candy and we talk blue streak all\nnight. And the next night and the next night and those people who are with me, those\nprisoners who are with me said, \u201cMy gosh\u201d \u2014 those were Bibelforscher*\u2019 people, those\nwere Baptist people. And he said, \u201cWe are supposed to be freed when we get to \u2014 to\nOpole, we\u2019re supposed to be freed.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, count your blessings, if you get freed,\nyou'll get freed.\u201d Anyway, the fourth day, we\u2019re put on a train, say goodbye to the pretty\ngirls across the street \u2014 across the wall \u2014 put us in a train. And we keep watching and I\nsee the same views. We were going through Vienna and going west again. We got back\nto Mauthausen. The place \u2014 later on discovered the place where I was supposed to be\ndisposed of \u2014 was overran by the Reds. The Soviet army was there already. And Germans\nbeing so indit\u2014 I mean outrigh\u2014 Langsam aber Sicher,\u201d slow and great and just exactly\nthat way, no other way \u2014 took us back to the concentration camp.\nWe came back with a group \u2014 big group of prisoners from prisons in Vienna and\nelsewhere, probably two or three, 400 of us. There were tables ready, the registering\ntables. All the blockschrei\u2014blockschreibers\u2122 were there, including my block secretary\nstanding \u2014 sitting there at tables, you know they write your data, take your document if\nyou have any and give you a number, give you a bracelet with your number and tell you\nwhere to go. So he was sitting there, he, \u201cStefan, come on, come on, come on here.\u201d So I\nwent and I said, \u201cBuywid.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, welcome again. Great you made it \u2014 great\nyou made it.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you mean great you made it? I was supposed to be freed.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cYeah, you were going to himmel.\u201d And there was a priest, Father Iwansk1.\nBefore I left, he listened to my confession, he gave me absolution and he said, \u201cYou are\nbe freed, with the next three or four days, you\u2019ll be free. And pray for us.\u201d So I ca \u2014 later\non I talked to Father Iwanski, I said, \u201cYou son of a gun, what do you think it was? Didn\u2019t\nyou know I was going to by hung?\u201d \u201cWell, you know, I wanted to cheer you up. But I\ngave you absolution, so you will go straight to paradise.\u201d So I, \u201cI probably will go to the\ndeepest hell, what I \u2014 for all what I did so far.\u201d Anyway, Mr. Buywid, \u201cHere\u2019s your\nnumber, here\u2019s your bracelet, go to the showers and go to the barrack. You got \u2014 you got\nbarrack 22, you\u2019re going to my block.\u201d And I looked and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want this damn\nnumber, this a zugang numbers, this is a new prisoner number. I want my number. I am a\nprominente.*\u00b0\u201d By that time I was a prominent prisoner. If you survive six months, you\nbecome prominent prisoner.

        "A: You beca\u2014 you became, you became person who counts. You became a prominent \u2014 a\nprominent prisoner, because you made it. And most of those who became functionaries in\na camp, you know, if they didn\u2019t go by killing people, they did it by surviving. So he\nsaid, \u201cShut up. You want be killed? Go to the showers and go to your barrack.\u201d So I put\nmy arm in there, tucked my ears in, went in. My finery was stripped. My shoe \u2014 my\nbeautiful boots even were taken. I was left with a belt and a pair of holzschuhe*\u2019 and my\nlittle bundle, which I stuck in a \u2014 1n a holzschuh. Get out of the shower and was thrown\nprison strip \u2014 prisoner garb.

The coat of arms was\nSaint Michael. And they were Poles from 11th century. He was a prisoner. By surviving\nthe first six months, also by knowing German very well, he became a block secretary.\nEach block had a Blockaltester, block leader, which was in most cases German criminal\nand a block secretary who knew German very well, could write and read very well. So he\nwas it. And it was an important function, even though he didn\u2019t cherish it because he had\nto lead \u2014 he had to call a lot of people to execution or to bunker or to injection or to gas\nchamber or to a \u2014 to go on a transport. That was his function \u2014 that\u2019s how he survived. If\nhe wasn\u2019t there, somebody else would have done it. He had to keep the numbers of all\npeople who had to assist the Rapportfiihrer.\u201d\u201d Every morning you \u2014 you lined up outside,\nthe Rapportftlhrer \u2014 SS man came and he counted you. Secretary wrote it down and gave\nit to him, he walked out. And a tally was made for the whole camp that had to count just\nright, nobody missing.

        "A: Well, in most cases, we were appreciative, because if they were Polish, they could be of\ngreat help to us. Also, yo\u2014 they were not killers. Some Kapos were killers.

What did you do?\u201d \u201cWell, I was a doctor and I\u2019m a doctor of\npsychology.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhere\u2019s your spoon?\u201d \u201cOh, I lost it.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s your dish?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I lost it.\u201d I said, \u201cMan, you dead, because you won\u2019t get your soup, you won\u2019t get\nanything to eat with.\u201d And if you try to catch some \u2014 some servers would give it into your\nhat, but most of them wouldn\u2019t. They would just take you aside and kill you. Anyway,\nfound him soup spoon and found him dish and we became friends. And he was great. For\nnext few days we just talked and every time we felt bad, 1t was just \u2014 end was coming,\nyou know, people are being taken to gas chamber and places. He\u2019s a \u2014 he said, \u201cOh, sit\ndown here, let\u2019s talk.\u201d So we talk blue streak and we got cheered up. He developed a\u2014a\nspecial kind of psychotherapy call \u2014 called logotherapy. And he\u2019s went talking on \u2014 on \u2014\ntalking tours through United States many times. One time he came in 1970\u2019s, late 70\u2019s\nand we couldn\u2019t get together, but I phoned him at Coffman Union at the University here\nand he called me back at work and then he talk \u2014 we \u2014 he phoned at night and we talked\nfor about three hours, from about 12 until 3:30. Said, \u201cWell, I got to go, my train is \u2014 my\nplane is leaving shortly.\u201d So we said, \u201cAuf wiedersehen\u201d and then \u2014 anyway, he\nsurvived, but when \u2014 I never thought he would make it, but he did. He stayed in\nMauthausen to the very \u2014 time of liberation. But, my case, again, I was fished out after a\nfew \u2014 in a few days after the great crowds came and I was transported to Gusen Zwei,\nwhich was a walking distance. Gusen Eins ~ was about two mi- two kilometers, Gusen\nZwei was about five kilometers, so we walked. There were about 5,000 of us walked that\nday. We were gather at the nightfall. We were \u2014 our clothes was taken, only belt and\nshoes were left on us. Our clothes was taken to be disinfected. We went to showers,\nwhich were cold at that time. We were put outside and we stayed until about four a.m. I\nwas still quite nimble and quite healthy. I got in the middle of a group. My head kind of\nfroze, but at morning we found about 500 people who were dead, out of 5,000. This is\nonly 10 percent.",
        "Q: But... tell us what that was like to \u2014 to spend the night and have people dropping around\nyou, dying.\n*\u201d Gusen I",
        "A: Yes, well, you become numb. You become cold, you beco\u2014 you hurt. Then all ofa\nsudden you become numb, you don\u2019t hurt any more. You\u2019re not even cold any more. You\nbecome kind of a frozen stick. And Gusen Zwei was the worst camp you ever heard of.\nNormally, it had 50,000 prisoners and by the end of a week would be 45,000. Every week\n5,000 prisoners came, sometime 10,000. And it never went above 50. Never went about\n40. In a week would be 40. About \u2014 attrition ration was about 20 percent a week. Was a\nhorrible work, we worked digging tunnels under mountain. The tunnels were buil\u2014 dug\nespecially to put armament industries in them. They already built tanks. They built\nMesserschmitt \u2014 Messerschmitt planes. And I think they built also rocket planes that they\nused \u2014 I mean, the Vau-Eins,\u201d> Vau-Eins, Vau-Zwei,\u201d to bomb England. But I\u2019m not sure\nof that. But I knew they built Messerschmitts. But I was on a crew that was digging the\ntunnel, digging with a \u2014 straight ahead of you, in a kind of a softish stone, with a air drill.\nAnd a person as strong as he is, or he is, could stand about four days. After four days you\nbroke down. Well, I stood it for about seven days and I was given a shovel to shovel\nbecause I couldn\u2019t lift 1t any more. And I had a Yugoslavian friend \u2014 Janko \u2014 Janko, I\ncan\u2019t remember his last name. He lasted 27 days drilling. The drill weighed probably 35 -\n40, maybe 50 pounds, straight into the wall, drilling. Then he dropped dead. Just dropped\nthe drill and dropped. By the time we turn him over, he was dead. Yeah, he was a \u2014\nYugoslavians and especially Albanian. Albanian people are the tough son of a guns.\nAlbanian man can swear for 15 minutes and never repeat himself. And if you translate\nsome of the swearing, your hair will stand on end. They\u2019re tougher than Polacks, they\u2019re\ntougher than Russians. Even tougher than Yugoslavians.",
        "Q: What were they giving you to eat at this point? Were you getting\u2014",
        "A: We had cup \u2014 we got cup of tea, it was birch leaves, or whatever it was, in the morning,\nnothing else. Sometime there was some milk. It was like a \u2014 like a cereal, boiled. Like\nmaybe a handful of cereal to 10 gallons of water. It was slightly sweetish, I think they\nhad some \u2014 beet marmalade mixed in it, and a cup of tea. At noon, you got a half a gallon\nof soup that had practically nothing in it and a small slice of bread. At night you got a\npound of bread for either seven or eight or 10 people and a \u2014 another cup of tea. It was\nsupposed to be 800 calories, but by the time it did get to you, it was no more than about\nfour or 500. One does \u2014 if one did not organize, one did not last long.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what do you mean by that?",
        "A: I was lucky. I had a Russian friend who was a thief. He can steal anything out of\nanyplace. When the allotment of cigarettes came to a block to be given to the\nfunctionaries and it was parceled out, he would always steal of \u2014 steal a carton of\n*? V-1 (German)\n** \\-2 (German)\ncigarettes and nobody ever could catch him. He was a Rostovskiy urka.\u201d\u201d He was a\nspecialist from Rostov. He said, \u201cWhen I was 10 years old, Ya khodil po karmenam, \u201d I\nwalked in \u2014 he walked into people\u2019s pockets.\u201d He was a pickpocket. He could steal\nanything off anybody. So he shared his cigarettes with me. Cigarette were the high, hard\ncurrency. For one-fourth of a cigarette, you got portion of bread. For one-eighth of a\ncigarette, you got a dish of soup. So when I had an access to something, I shared with\nhim. To make it short, I had a SS man who didn\u2019t like me, who beat me frequently. He\nwas a beautiful, young, tall, blonde beast and he had a German Shepherd, young German\nShepherd with him. So one time, I got the sh\u2014- German Shepherd in a dark tunnel and of\ncourse I dispose of him, I skinned him. I had him baked in a ba\u2014 in the smithy, because I\nthat time was \u2014 I was a \u2014 a Laufer, \u2019 I was a runner. I was running with the drills to the\nsmithy and back, you know, carrying them back and forth to be sharpened and to be\nbrought back. So I gave the smith one-fourth of a dog, he baked it for me. Then I shared\nanother quarter with the people who worked with me and a half of the dog, I brought to\nthe camp and that three or four of us lived high on the dog for about a week and a half.\nOh, that was an enormous shot in the arm. Course my Russian friend liked the dog so\nmuch, he said, \u201cStepka, get another one. Get another one.\u201d I said, \u201cSorry, I cannot catch\nand old German Shepherd, this was a young, stupid German Shepherd.\u201d",
        "Q: I see. So, to survive, you couldn\u2019t just accept what they gave you, you had to find that\nextra\u2014",
        "A: You had to organize, you had to trade. When I was in Mauthausen, if I worked \u2014 when I\nworked on a Kanadakommando, sorting the goods, I was able to scrounge a lot of\njewelry, came to the barrack or \u2014 got a bundle of American dollars. I could get a beautiful\nbottle of booze for 500 dollars. Or I could get a big, five pound sausage for 500 dollars.\nAnd my friends and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and colleagues, we live high on the hog.",
        "Q: Now, at this time, in this camp that you were at, where you were doing the tunnel\ndrilling, were people being taken away and executed or gassed at this camp?",
        "A: We had a gas chamber, but I \u2014 no, there was a gas chamber in Gusen One, but not Gusen\nZwei. But the mortality ratio was so enormous that \u2014 that nothing else was necessary. Of\ncourse the Kapos killed their portion of people every day. We went to camp, I mean went\nto work \u2014 on the way home we carried five, six, 10 - 15 - 20 people out of a hundred.\nCarried them because they were killed at the job. Some dropped dead but most of them\n\u201d\u00bb Crook from Rostov (Russian)\n*\u00b0 | walked in pockets (Russian)\n*7 Runner (German)\nwere killed by the Kapo. Kapo would get a cigarette for every person he killed. If he\nwere a heavy smoker, he killed a lot of people. Also, there was a Krankenhaus, there was\na hospital and if you went to Krankenhaus, never came back, of course \u2014 but some people\ndid. So from time to time, they would have a \u2014 a Krankenhaus had to be disinfected. So\nthey would take the people from a Krankenhaus and make them walk across the railroad\ntracks to another barrack that was empty, kind of a temporary Krankenhaus and keep\nthem there, and there would be a line of Kapos lined up on each side of the group\nwalking. Anybody who would walk, they ran a gauntlet. They had ax handles on \u2014 or two\nby fours, and anybody who did not run, was killed. So I remember once in the first of\nFebruary, 1945, they killed that night, 400 sick people out of 700, about 300 only made\nit, could run. The rest were killed. I had a friend at that time, he was a Polish\nmountaineer. He was a tough son of a \u2014 he was just wiry, he was strong. He was\neverything. Anyway, he got sick or he \u2014 maybe he malinger. So he was sent to the\nhospital. He went to hospital, couple nights later comes a Kapo from a hospital and say \u2014\ncalls my number, so I answer him, and said, \u201cYou have a friend in the hospital.\u201d \u201cYes, I\nhave a friend in the hospital.\u201d \u201cHis \u2014 his name is Janko the Goral,\u201d* \u201cJohn \u2014 little Johnny,\nthe mountaineer.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthat window, so he wants you to come and\nsee him at that window.\u201d So at night I sneaked in \u2014 that was not allowed. To get out of a\nbarrack, going get killed. So I went and I knocked the window, he opened it up and, \u201cOh,\nStefan, come tomorrow and bring me a big jug of water. I\u2019m so thirsty, there\u2019s not\nenough water here. Here.\u201d So he gave me a little bundle. I came back, there were about\nseven portions of bread. It was a fortune. Eating an extra portion a day, keep you alive\nand up your spirit for at least a week, maybe 14 days. So I brought him some water next\nday and I said, \u201cJanko, where did you get all that bread?\u201d \u201cWell, you know, those damn\nMuselmans \u2019.\u201d Muselmans was a name for people who were on their last foot. You\nknow, they just lay there, they can\u2019t eat, they hold their bread. So when the\nFliegeralarm'\u2019\u2019 comes, you know, night, when the lights are out and planes are flying \u2014\nlights are all \u2014 all the lights are off, he just went from bed to bed and swiped the bread\nand lived high on the hog.\nAnd I said, \u201cJanko, but this is un-Christian.\u201d \u201cThey are going to die anyway. I\u2019m not\ngoing to \u2014I\u2014I\u2019m not killing them, but they can\u2019t eat. They have bunches of bread sitting\nthere, they just can\u2019t eat.\u201d So we both \u2014 and all my friends in the barrack, lived high on\nthe hog. And Janko came back, got out of a ba\u2014 of a hospital, came back to the barrack\nand he was given three days of convalescence. He was staying in the barrack, did not\nhave to go to work. And the Kapo, day Kapo in the barrack, ask him to do something and\nJanko said, \u201cYou so and so, get away from me. I\u2019m convalescing, I\u2019m sick.\u201d So the man\n*\u00ae Mountaineer, uplander (Polish)\n*\u201d Muslim (German); camp term used to refer to prisoners who had lost the will to live and were\nnear death.\n'\u00b0 Aid-raid alarm (German)\ntook his tool and beat Janko to death. I came at night and one of our friends said, \u201cYour\nfriend is there.\u201d There was a \u2014 you know, there was a big, high stone wall between each\nbarrack and next barrack. And we lined up, you know laid down, it was 10 - 20 - 50\npeople a day who were dying. So I went. Yes, Janko was still there, laying, his head\nbashed in. So I did have his address. I wrote to his family after the war and his sister\nanswered and she said, \u201cWell, my mother feels so bad because Janko was taken because\nhe argued with her, so he volunteered and went to work in Germany and he got himself\ncharge with sabotage and sent to concentration camp. And please tell me, did he have a\nnice casket? How was he buried, did he have a priest?\u201d Janko, with probably 500 others,\nnext day, was dumped into big wagon, that about 50 prisoners pushed and pulled. They\njust had big sides and their wheels were just like the Conestoga wagons in America there,\nbut bigger. And they pushed and pulled to the first Gusen Eins, where the crematortum\nwas. Gusen Zwei did not have a crematorium, so that the bodies, probably four or 500 a\nday, sometime maybe 1,000 a day were wheeled to Gusen Eins to be cremated.",
        "Q: Were there times when you were afraid?",
        "A: Not really. Became like \u2014 became \u2014 it became a normal life. It became a very normal life.\nYou watched not to cross a line, you watched not to overstep your \u2014 your \u2014 your territory.\nYou watched. I mean you had to have eyes back there and side here and forward, even\ndown below. If you \u2014 if you saw a SS man coming, you didn\u2019t step off the sidewalk, why,\nhe just could kill you. If you didn\u2019t step off the sidewalk and take your hat off and clap it\nagain-against your leg and stood at attention, you could get killed. If he didn\u2019t like your\nlooks, he could just take a gun and shoot you or else beat you that you would not survive.\nOn and on and on, and if you did make it, it\u2019s just good luck, holy providence and a good\ncombination of both of them.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s February or March of 1945, are \u2014 are what \u2014 are you getting any information from\nthe rest of the world? Do you have any sense \u2014",
        "A: None. None whatsoever. Well, there were rumors. You know rumors, like in American\narmy rumors or any place where a lot of people, rumors. There were some people who\nlistened to radios in a camp, but they shared their information very sparingly. We knew\nwhat was going on. The rumors told that Americans landed. The Russians are coming.\nWell, of course you know, all those prisoners coming from the east, consequently the\nfront line is coming. The Germans are being killed by zillions. Well, great. We hope they\nwill all ge\u2014 will get it. The \u2014 then we heard, when the Poles landed in Holland, you know\nthe Polish parachuters, whole brigade and couple American brigades landed in Holland,\nwe heard those rumors and it was the gospel truth of course, you could not \u2014 I mean, if\nyou said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not true,\u201d somebody could kill you, probably. Said, \u201cYou defeatist,\nwhat do you mean it\u2019s not true? Honest, it\u2019s gospel truth.\u201d",
        "Q: Did you make good friends there, or \u2014",
        "A: Quite a few. But they didn\u2019t last very long. Either they got transferred or got killed. Most\nof them got killed. Only two people that I know survived Gusen Zwei. One was a priest,\none was unfinished priest. Father Iwanski and Father Bruno. Father Iwanski survived. He\nsurvived Gusen, which was not easy to survive. He ended in Canada. I corresponded with\nhim. He\u2019s dead for last 10 - 15 years. He was an old man that time. You know, he was in\nhis 40\u2019s, he was old, old man. When he came to camp, said \u201cHey, how are \u2014 old are\nyou?\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m 29 - 30 - 32.\u201d \u201cOh my God, you old. Week, two weeks, you are gone.\u201d\nYou were supposed to be 17 - 18 - 19, you had a chance. If you were over 30, you were\nan old man. Father Iwanski was over 40. He was an old man. Father Bruno was an\nunfinished priest, he was \u2014 we call him unfinished priest. Nie skonczony ksiadz.'\u201d' He\nwas still in a seminary. He eventually became a priest and he went back to Poland. I\nunderstand he was executed by the Communists.",
        "Q: Did the priests hold any kind of religious services, or \u2014",
        "A: Very secretly.",
        "Q: \u2014 counsel you, or \u2014",
        "A: Very \u2014 they talked to us.",
        "Q: They talked?",
        "A: When I went on my little trip, Father Iwanski came to talk to me, he was still in\nMauthausen and he talked to me and he blessed me and he listened to my confession.\nLater on I \u2014I felt like killing him.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Well, I said, \u201cYou should have warned me.\u201d \u201cWarned you? What do \u2014 would it do? I\nhave \u2014 I wanted you to feel good for next two or three days.\u201d",
        "Q: But you would have liked to have known?",
        "A: I would have liked to have known, yes. If I would have known, I \u2014 I might have made a\ngreater effort \u2014 there wasn\u2019t much chance, but I \u2014 I might have tried.

        "A: Oh my God, eight? He is wasting eight tapes.",
        "Q: Not wasting. This is just \u2014 I guess it\u2019s just sort of an observation, that you were saying\nyou would have liked to have known, that one time when you were being taken off, to\npossibly \u2014 well, the plan was to hang you. But so much of the war years, you had no idea\nwhat was going to happen next.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. As I said, I was resigned. I expected not to live to be 18 or 20 or 19 or 20,\nbut I did. And I was very prayerfully, thankful for each day that I lived and tomorrow\nwill take care of itself. Even at bedtimes, when I expected to be \u2014 to be taken to the little\nroom to be injected \u2014 I knew it was coming, but still I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m still alive today.\nTomorrow will take care of itself.\u201d Especially, I mean I felt very bad one time. There was\na little boy, his name was Henry. He said he was 14, but he looked like he was nine. He\nwas a\u2014 he was a Polish worker, working in Germany, in a factory. Somebody put sand in\na\u2014ina motor. Motor got destroyed, he was blamed for it, sabotage. Sent to Mauthausen.\nHe lived, for a time, in block 22. Then he was called. And he was \u2014 he was just like a\ntiny, little bird. He was so skinny, he was so miserable. He just looked like a \u2014 like a \u2014\nlike will of a wisp. And Mr. Bujywid wanted greatly \u2014 to help him. So when he \u2014\nexecution time came, Mr. Bujwid went to the \u2014 camp secretary went to Gestapo office\nand begged for him, one day. So they postpone it. And the next day \u2014 next day he came\nhis face was bitten up and swollen. He came \u2014",
        "Q: Who\u2019s this?",
        "A: Our secretary. He went next day again and again he had welts on his back and his face\nwas beaten some more. So the fourth day, a list came \u2014 Laufer came running. Laufer was\nthe runner, you know, as I \u2014 pretty young boys were runners, Laufers. They ran between\nthe camps and delivered messages. So Laufer came with a list and \u2014 and said, \u201cMr.\nBujwid,\u201d I mean, \u201cHerr Bujwid.'\u201d\u2019 Exekution eintreten, Exekution eintreten.'\u201d\u2019 Roll up\nwith execution.\u201d So Mr. Buywid came to barrack and read the list and I was sure I was\ngoing to be on the list and the little boy was on the list. And he walked out into the front\n'? Mr. Bujwid\n'? Fall in for execution (German)\nand they got lined up and the Blockaltester, Max, the German criminal who was the block\nleader, led them out.... And it was so, so funny, Mr. Bujwid talked with that little Henry.\nOh, they talk blue streak. \u201cBecause we both are from the holy Zmudz.\u201d Because the little\nboy was from the same territory that Mr. Buywid was. They say, \u201cWe\u2019re holy people, we\nbelieve in God, we hate the damn Communists. We hate those Germans even more\nbecause they\u2019re ungodly creatures. And we are going to survive for ever and ever and\never.\u201d And the last day, before Henry went to be killed, he said, \u201cMr. Bujwid, thank\nyou.\u201d Yeah, he, he knew what was coming.\nAnyway, that was still in Mauthausen and that was I wa\u2014 then I wa\u2014 on our way in \u2014\nGusen Zwei and of course, it \u2014 I heard it later on, but it was a good story. A Swedish Red\nCross person, whose name nobody ever found, came to speak to the commander, General\nPohl,'** P-o-h-I. And he came to talk to him and General Pohl was complaining, he said,\n\u201cSee here,\u201d was a telegram or was a letter. \u201cI have an befehl'\u00b0 here,\u201d I have an order, \u201cto\nlead all these people I have left here, about 42,000, into the tunnel. The ends of the\ntunnels are already mined to be dynamited and those people will suffocate there, within\nin probably one, two hours.\u201d He said, \u201cIf it was only telephone order, I probably could\nescape not doing it, but is a befehl, it\u2019s a telegram, I had to sign for it. What I am going to\ndo?\u201d He was not \u2014 he was not a very bad person, that man was. Matter of fact, he had a\ncase in court later on and some of us testified for him. Anyway, when this man left his\noffice, the document disappeared. The man \u2014 and the general was diverted somewhat \u2014\nthe man swiped it. He borrowed a bicycle from a German guard, then he borrowed a\nhorse. And the American front line was just beyond Linz. It was probably 30 - 35 - 40\nmiles. He went across the whole front line on a horse, then \u2014 he in tie and suit. Why the\nGerman Ges-\u2014 SS didn\u2019t kill him, I don\u2019t have an idea. Did he talked to somebody, I don\u2019t\nhave an idea. Did he identify himself, I don\u2019t have an idea. He got across, he got as far as\nGeneral Patton'\u201d\u00b0 headquarters. And nobody wanted to talk to him, so he bothered\neverybody there and eventually somebody did talk to him. So he mentioned that, he\ndescribed it. So they said, \u201cOkay, come on in, come on in.\u201d They let him talk to assistant\nto Patton. And then Patton came and asked a few questions. And Patton sent five\nAmerican tanks. They broke across the front line, they went and went and went. They\ncame to Gusen Zwei, they took few potshots at the guard towers. The SS people\nsurrendered. They left tank, I think about five soldiers, to guard those 800 SS, who are\nherded into \u2014 into \u2014 into a big kind of a barn. And the rest of us, who were just barely\nmoving, because we haven\u2019t gotten anything to eat about four days and my case, I was\nflat on my back. I couldn\u2019t even turn over. Then the four tanks went to Mauthausen, five\nmore miles and sur\u2014 and get around, too few \u2014 took few potshots at the guard towers.\n'* The interviewee later corrected this name to Max Pausch, Kommandant of Gusen II.\n'\u00b0\u00b0 Order (German)\n'\u00b06 Gen. George Smith Patton\n3,000 SS people surrendered and there was bedlam in Mauthausen. It was not much of a\nbedlam in Gusen Zwei because most of us were just about done for.",
        "Q: Take us back a little bit \u2014 wa\u2014 what was going on the last few days that you had stopped\ngetting food?",
        "A: They told us there was no food. \u201cWe cannot give you anything because there isn\u2019t any.\u201d\nWell, it turned out, that the warehouses were full of bread and the bread was \u2014 after we\nfound it after a few days after liberation, it was all moldy by then. There was probably\ntwo, three, four, five tons of bread. They just probably tried to starve us to death. And\nmany did. Many did. We had an enormous ditch dug out between the Gusen Eins and\nGusen Zwei by American bulldozers, army bulldozers. Just an enormous ditch. And they\ntook all the Germans from the countryside, with horses and carts and wheelbarrows and\nall and they came and picked up all the people, washed up everybody and laid them\nevenly, not just dumped them, but laid them evenly in a \u2014 in that grave. There are about\n18,000 people buried there. And those were the dead for last four or five days, when the\ncrematorium did not work.",
        "Q: 18,000?",
        "A: About 17 - 18,000. An enormous, enormous \u2014 kind of almost like a\u2014 like a\u2014 likea\nriverbank built up high.",
        "Q: Did the Germans know that the Americans were coming?",
        "A: Well, they expected \u2014 they, they all knew the front was nearby, but they expect it to be\nstill fighting there for quite sometime, but this \u2014 they just broke through. They said, \u201cOh\nmy God, the armies are coming. \u201cAmerikaner, Amerikaner \u2014 run!\u201d And the SS of course,\njust surrendered and the Commander Ziereis'\u201d\u2019 was a horrible man \u2014 of Mauthausen. He\nwas \u2014 people testified and \u2014 against him and he was hanged, later on. But General Pohl of\nMau-\u2014 of Gusen Zwei, was exonerated.",
        "Q: Think back to that day and \u2014 you said you were laying in bed, but did \u2014 what did it sound\nlike when the Americans \u2014",
        "A: It was kind of a bedlam \u2014 it was a bedlam and it was a\u2014 Americans really came, you\nknow \u2014 really came. It was about two days later that the front moved, Americans came.\nThey just came in, walking around. Taking lot of pictures and they came to my \u2014 to my\nbarrack and they looked up and \u2014 and one of them spoke German, \u201cKommen Sie da,\n'\"\u2019 Franz Ziereis\nkommen Sie da.'\u2019*\u201d And I said, \u201cI can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t even turn over.\u201d \u201cJa, wir helfen\ndich \u2014 wir helfen \u2014 wir helfen dich.'\u00b0\u201d\u201d We\u2019ll help you. Came with a stretcher and a\ncouple people and they pull me off. They lay me in a stretcher and somebody came with a\npail of water, they washed me off. I was \u2014 I was shitty and \u2014 and stinking, and all that and\nthey covered me up with a German army overcoat. Took me to Gusen Eins and there was\na little hospital made there and were given little milk \u2014 milk with \u2014 mixed with water and\nkind of a gruel, that you give to babies, for a few days. Eventually, we started eating\nfood. And people who were in \u2014 who got hold of a solid food, like American were tossing\ncans of Spam \u2014 and Spam was the heavenly food. Oh my God. Spam was it. I still can\nclose my eyes and I can taste that beautiful American Spam. So somebody would eat it,\nwould not share it with somebody else and he would die, immediately, on the spot. Could\nnot \u2014 could not take it.",
        "Q: So you were pretty sick. What was the reaction of the Americans who saw you \u2014 who ca\n\u2014 who came by your bunk and saw you?",
        "A: Well, there were so many of us, they were just flabbergasted. They kept us there and they\ntook us some, on \u2014 in trucks, to hospital in Bamberg, which was couple hundred miles\nwest, into West Germany. And I was in a Stadtischer Hospital,''\u00ae the state hospital for\nabout four, five, six months there. I had \u2014 well, I was down to 72 pounds, had a \u2014 I had a\nbad case of tuberculosis. And my lungs were collecting liquid, especially my left lung. So\nI got shots. I got shots, it was the 10 cubic centimeters lime \u2014 lime shots. Know lime, like\nthe \u2014 used for building? Calcium \u2014 calcium shots. Calcium shots. And when you get the\nshot, you get hot from your tip of your toe \u2014 fingers to tippy toes and to your head, you\njust get pleasantly hot. And that was supposed to sh\u2014 to dry up that liquid in your lungs.\nAnd after a few weeks, when a nurse was coming with a needle, my veins went south.\nShe would jab and jab and jab and she could not find a vein. She said, \u201cJust don\u2019t look\nwhen I come. I don\u2019t want you to see, because your veins disappear.\u201d My both arms were\njust like \u2014 like I was a heavy addict to God knows what. But it didn\u2019t dry it. It didn\u2019t dry,\nthey had to make a puncture in the back and pump it out. And they couldn\u2019t put me\nunder, because I would never wake up. So two big men, just like those two, big clunks\nheld me and the doctor went back and he made \u2014 punctured my back and he pumped, oh\nprobably gallon and a half of horrible liquid. And he said \u2014 the doctor said, \u201cWell, if\nyou\u2019re lucky, this is it. If you\u2019re not lucky, you have to pump it every six months for the\nrest of your days. Of course, if are still unlucky, you die of TB, well, you\u2019ll be dead.\u201d I\nwas lucky. I didn\u2019t die of TB and I did not have to ever have it pumped again, except that\nI have two big stones on the bottom of my lungs, because the calcium goes all the\norganism and collects in your lungs and settles on the bottom. Occasionally when I have\n'\u00b08 Come there [sic] (German)\n' Yes, we help you, we help you. (German)\n'!\u00ae Municipal hospital (German)\ncold, when I cough, little grainy stuff, I do cough out. Doesn\u2019t bother me any. Except I go\nto x-ray. When I first came to x-ray, he says, the doctor \u2014 technician looked, call the\ndoctor and doctor said, \u201c\u201cWhat is that?\u201d And I said, \u201c\u201cWhat is what?\u201d \u201cWhat is that on\nbottom of your lungs?\u201d I said, \u201cCalcium.\u201d \u201cCalctum? How come calcium?\u201d Said, \u201cWell, I\nwas given about 310 cubic centimeters as injections of calctum to dry up my wet\npleurisy, they called it, Pleuritism Exudative''\u2019 in Latin \u2014 my wet pleurisy.\u201d \u201cOh, they\ndid that?\u201d \u201cYes, they did that.\u201d \u201cDid it dry out?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d",
        "Q: Did you feel \u2014 I mean, could you comprehend that the war is over? Did you feel safe\nagain?",
        "A: I felt safe.",
        "Q: Did you feel like it was really over?",
        "A: And I felt safe and I felt on the top of a cloud. It\u2019s unbelievable, but when you have\nnothing, you know, you are dirty, you are starving, you have completely nothing and you\nare in prison, the freedom is so sweet. When we went to work, there was a train going\nover the viaduct and you saw the German people standing in the windows and smiling,\nyou know. Well dressed, well-fed, just smiling, you said, \u201cOh my God, how free those\npeople are.\u201d They were not, I mean, they were under Nazis men, all that, but \u201chow free\nthese people are.\u201d And frequently when you are in a life, you are quite well off\nsometimes and oh, my God, you know how many people commit suicide because being\nunhappy temporarily. Nobody ever committed suicide there. He was Muselman, he went\nto gas tomorrow morning, he did not commit sui\u2014 suicide today. Well, there were\nincidents where people went against the wire and got themselves elec-electrocuted. But\nyou never became despondent. You also \u2014 you n \u2014 you need that \u2014 you e \u2014 never caught a\ncold. I had never seen a person in Siberia \u2014 I have never seen a person in a concentration\ncamp to catch a cold. Nobody ever caught the common cold, ever. They are just too\ntough to catch a cold. When you get to be a civilian, you become sissy, you catch any\ncold that comes along.",
        "Q: Now, when you got out, were you able to contact your family at all?",
        "A: No. For about six months I couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "A: There was no connection.\n''! Wet pleurisy (Medical terminology)",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No correspondence, nothing, between West Germany and Poland, they were damn\nSoviets on the way. About six months later, I registered with the Swedish Red Cross and\nthe Swedish Red Cross notified them and about a year later, we started writing back and\nforth, so they knew that I was still alive and \u2014 alive and kicking and not too bad. Of\ncourse I was still in a \u2014 in a sanatorium.",
        "Q: In \u2014 the first place you went to the hospital was in \u2014",
        "A: In Bamberg.",
        "Q: the U.S. \u2014",
        "A: Bamberg",
        "Q: \u2014 occupied Germany\u201d?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry. It was in U.S. occupied Austria.",
        "Q: Austria, okay.",
        "A: In Gusen Eins, there was a kind of a hospital or camp hospital. In a few days, only \u2014 later\non, they took us to Bamberg, to a real hospital. It was a good, old German hospital and \u2014",
        "Q: And how did you feel about being treated by Germans?",
        "A: Great. The Schwesters''\u201d \u2014 I mean all people who took care of you are nuns. The\nSchwesters are all nuns. All nurses in Germany at that time were nuns. There some nurse\nhelper \u2014 nurse helpers who were ladies, women, civilian girls, but all German nurses\nwere Schwesters. Oh yeah, then we had some great Schwesters. I still have a rosary that\none gave me. Yeah, Sister Urszula gave me rosary, I still have it.",
        "Q: So when was it determined that you would need to go for further rest?",
        "A: Well, after being in the hospital, they said, \u201cWell, you are not well to go into a camp, you\nhave to go to sanatorium because your tuberculosis \u2014 it\u2019s not spreaded \u2014 spreading, it\u2019s\narresting \u2014 it\u2019s arrested, but you have to have rest.\u201d So I went to Erholungsheim'\u2019\u201d \u2014 rest\n112\nNurses (German)\n''S Sanatorium (German)\nhome, which is a beautiful SchloB'\"* on a top of a mount \u2014 on the top \u2014 top of a hill, next\nto forest, with a big garden.

They had a David \u2014 David star in their \u2014 1n their coat of arms.\nWhen the Hitler\u2019s came, they all were arrested and packed to concentration camps and I\nunderstand never came back.",
        "Q: So what was it like when you got there?",
        "A: Well, we were assigned rooms \u2014 either one or two people to a room, you stayed a lot in\nbed. The food was quite good, provided by the German \u2014 by the Germans and \u2014 and\nSwiss Cross and American army, mostly. We\u2019d get American PX packages, with a little\ncanned food and a beautiful piece of chocolate. I was crazy about chocolate. When I got\nmy package, there was probably about four ounces of chocolate, I inhaled it. One time\nthe chocolate was moldy in those packages, so I traded with everybody who want to\ndispose of it. I traded everything I had \u2014 I had \u2014 oh my God, I don\u2019t know how many\nblocks of chocolate I had \u2014 I ate myself sick. For next six weeks, I couldn\u2019t look\nchocolate in the face. It was very moldy. The German doctor \u2014 actually it was a French\nlady doctor, she thought I was get blood \u2014 I mean food poisoning, she hovered over me\nconstantly. It was a beautiful, little French girl. I almost, I almost married her. Yeah, she\n\u2014 we, we became very friendly and she took me to see her family, we drove all the way to\nVersailles, stay there, came back. Of course nothing came out of it, I was just a\ndilapidated little old prisoner and she was a beautiful young lady, just out of medical\nschool. But was great when it lasted. Oh, she was fun to be with.",
        "Q: Boy, it sounds like you were starting to begin to take joy in normal things like \u2014",
        "A: Well, of course \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 chocolate and dating and \u2014",
        "A: Of course, I me \u2014 I mean every day was a new day and you are free. You are not going to\nget to be \u2014 get your \u2014 shot or go to a gas chamber. In Mauthausen, every 10 days, one\nblock was gassed. You went to showers, you went in tiptoe \u2014 you went to showers every\n10 days. You went tiptoeing, your whole block, you know, 400 - 600 people \u2014 and there\nwas a deathly silence. You could not hear people breathe. And everybody was watching\nthe shower heads. You got a little piece of soap. When the water came, it was a bedlam.\nJumping, yelling, shouting, laughing, hugging one another, because sometime, instead of\nthe water, those little red flaps came open, Zyklon B'\u2019\u2019 poured in \u2014 those little blue\n114\nCastle (German)\n''?

        "A: When you went \u2014 and you never know which \u2014 you never knew which barrack was going\nto happen to. So you went \u2014 you apprehensive, when you got out, you say, \u201cWhee, I\u2019m\ngoing to live next 10 days. At least next 10 days.\u201d",
        "Q: And you told me before that sometimes you were forced to actually clean up after that.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, I was under special \u2014 special barrack, so when they needed extra help when\nextra \u2014 lot of people came, they took a crew of 10 - 20 - 50 people and we had to go\ntransport the bodies to the cool chamber. The cool chamber, it was kind of a underground\ntunnel and a little push railroad. We loaded up the bodies on the top of this little flatcars\nand got into crematorium \u2014 in the cool chamber next to it. The cool chamber too \u2014 could\ntake about 2,000 people \u2014 bodies. Because sometime they couldn\u2019t catch up, burning.",
        "Q: I mean how do you \u2014 what do you say to yourself to make yourself do something like\nthat?",
        "A: Well, you went willingly, you got an extra bowl of soup. You abhorred it, but you went.\nYou got big dish of SS soup. Peas or beans with pork in it. Oh my God, that was a\nheaven. As I said, your life became every day life \u2014 normal, every day life. And whatever\nhappened was normal for that time and place.",
        "Q: In the first few days of your liberation, think about what were the things that \u2014 that were\nnormally normal, but you weren\u2019t used to any more. Did you have any experiences, you\nknow that \u2014",
        "A: It was just \u2014 it was just like being a cloud nine. Laying in a clean bed and being clean and\nbeing \u2014 people come and feed you. An American would come and stand by my bed. And\nhe said, \u201cYou cannot eat, can you?\u201d \u201cWell, I can, kind of.\u201d So he would take a spoon....\nYes, it was a great feeling.\n[Technical conversation]\nEnd of Tape #8\nTape #9",

So you\u2019re in the sanatortum and\nyou\u2019re beginning to get your strength back. What kind of thoughts are you having about\nyour future?",
        "A: Not much of it. By the time I became well, I knew that Poland became Communist and\nthe part of the Polish underground I was in was fighting both the Germans and the\nCommunists. As we said, \u201cThey are coming, who do you shoot first?\u201d We said, \u201cPleasure\nbefore duty, shoot the Russians first.\u201d And I knew they were looking for me. I felt they\nwere looking for me. I discover later on they were. Out of the original 17 \u2014 20, five of us\nsurvived. I was arrested by the Germans and was sent away. The four boys survived.\nAbout a year later, they were asked to a big party by the local Russian army people,\nbecause they discovered what we did and especially what we did for them. They had a\nbig party. They drank and ate for three days and three nights, they were given Stalin\nCross. They were given Pobieda Medal,''\u00b0 Russian victory medal. They were given\nPolish Virtuti Militari, third class. They were given 17,000 rubles each. And fourth day,\nwere packed on a \u2014 put on a train and sent to Siberia. Said, \u201cPeople like you, we\nappreciate what you did for us, but we don\u2019t want you now here.\u201d And two of those four\nboys \u2014 were two that were of \u2014 with me from the very beginning. From the very \u2014 my\nfirst seven \u2014 17 and there was Icek number one, Icek number two. Isaac number one,\nIsaac number two. They were both Jewish boys. And they led a charmed life. I knew I\nwas probably God\u2019s chosen, maybe son of God \u2014 sometime I felt I was God, almost.\nBecause everybody else killed right and left, mutilated, I am still alive. I got few \u2014 hit\nfew times, but it was nothing. But I always look at those two and said, \u201cMy \u2014 you two are\nfreaks. How come you still alive?\u201d \u201cWell, if you want to kill us, go ahead.\u201d They never\ncame back. The other two came back from Soviet Russia, these two never came back.",

In 1973, he became a persecutor general\nof the Polish armed forces and was the last time he wrote to me, because I wrote him that,\n\u201cYou dirty, damn Communist. Why did you have to do that?\u201d So he wrote back, \u201cI\nhaven\u2019t done anything, I helped a lot of people, I helped a lot of people.\u201d And I wrote\nhim, \u201cDo you want a feather in your hat? You want me to come back and you put me\nagainst the wall?\u201d So he wrote, \u201cI would never do that to you, you were my friend\nalways, you always will be my friend. But I am becoming the prosecutor general of the\nPolish armed forces and I cannot write you to \u2014 to you any more. But I promise you that\n\u2014 your folder, that is about three inches thick, is going to disappear when I get my\nposition. Nobody\u2019s going to see it again.\u201d And my sisters, when they came \u2014 they came\nhere, said, \u201cYes, he came for a visit, many times,\u201d and the times were hard in Poland, so\nsh\u2014 they said that he brought always some very exquisite food. He always brought a\nbottle of champagne and \u2014 with a lunch with him and he said, \u201cI never will forget what\nyou did for me.\u201d He said, \u201cWhen I was a kid, and we were dirt poor, when Stefan and I\nwere going to school in the morning, I would sneaked into your house early and your\nmother always would give me a good breakfast with Stefan. And then we walked our\nthree kilometers to school.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019Il never forget that. And you can write Stefan that\nI would never hurt him.\u201d Anyway, when I go back, I will spit \u2014",
        "Q: On his grave?",
        "A: Well, probably not. I should be Christian and forgive him. But I can not forget. Just like\nthat \u2014 there\u2019s a little German saying that says, \u201cOrte und Zeiten der Schrecken die wir\nniemals vergessen werden.''\u201d\u201d \u201cThe times and places of horror, we should never forget.\u201d\nEspecially this day and age. You know, you talk to young people \u2014 I spoke to about 110\nyoung people in a middle school about two weeks ago. And they had a course on\nHolocaust, they wanted to know what was going on. They don\u2019t know who Hitler was.\nThey heard little of Stalin, they don\u2019t remember who Roosevelt was. They learn little\n'!? The places and times of terror should never be forgotten. (German)\nabout the Holocaust. They were living \u2014 reading Elie Wiesel, the book \u2014 little book,\nNight. They were just about few pages gone and they wanted to ask many questions and I\ntold them little story. So I frequently go and talk to group \u2014 various groups of people,\nwillingly, and few of us that are still alive should not forget. And it seems like your\npeople with the museum there and whatever information you impart to people must have\nsome influence, because a lot of schools, even grade schools, have a special course every\nyear on the Holocaust. And as far as I know, almost all the middle schools here,\nespecially the religious schools, Catholic and Lutheran schools, do have it too.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 you \u2014 you didn\u2019t want to go back, because it was Communist and so \u2014",
        "A: Well, I\u2014I\u2014I could not go.",
        "Q: You couldn\u2019t go, right.",
        "A: Because those people are \u2014 my sisters wrote me in 1955, I think and said, \u201cWell, we\nwould like to see you, but if you come, you may end in a piaskowo.'\u201d\u201d\u201d Piaskowo is a\ncemetery \u2014 1s a sandy hill. Said, \u201cBecause many people like you are being taken out.\u201d I\nhad two little relatives, they were two girls my age. They were actually my nieces but I \u2014\nthey were my age. In 1947, they were arrested, they were mistreated, they were sent to\njai\u2014 to prison for 10, 15, 20 years. They were exonerated in 1960, released and they even\nwere allowed to live in Warsaw, which was a great privilege. They\u2019re both dead. They\ndidn\u2019t survive very long.",
        "Q: Your, your parents survived the war?",
        "A: My father survived. My \u2014 my mother was dead by then. My mother was a war, war\ncasualty. She had a baby and all doctors were arrested and sent to concentration camps.\nShe had a very child \u2014 difficult childbirth and she died in childbirth at 41.",
        "Q: Died?",
        "A: Yes. But those two girls in question, they were couriers for our underground. They\ncarried mostly explosives on the train. They\u2019d have two huge suitcases of explosives, get\non the train, they spoke little German. They\u2019re pretty young girls. Well, frequently they\nwould get into a German car \u2014 a bunch of German soldiers, officers had a special car, so\nthey\u2019re, \u201cMadchen, madchen, kommen Sie hier.'*!\u201d So they would came with the big\nsuitcase that the German would pick up the suitcase, put it up on the upper. Because there\nwere controls frequently, they would stop a train and search and contraband like food, the\n'\u00b0 Sandy hill (Polish); colloquially \u201ccemetary.\u201d\n'*! Girls, girls, come here! (German)\nso-called black market, which was a free market, people training would be stole \u2014 taken\naway from people. So if you are pretty girl and you carry that, Germans invited you, took\nyour bundle there and nobody could come and search you. And they would come to\nWarsaw and said, \u201cauf wiedersehen\u201d and \u201cdanke schon\u201d and went blissfully their own\nway with four big suitcases, carrying enough stuff to blow up four \u2014 four or five trains.\nBut the Communists got them. They said, \u201cBut we helped you.\u201d \u201cWell, helpers like you\nwe don\u2019t need any more.\u201d Just like with my four boys. \u201cHelpers like you we don\u2019t need\nany more.\u201d\nAnd mainly, we were helpers in one aspect. In 1943, in summer, a Communist young\nman, slightly older than I, came and talk \u2014 talked. He said, \u201cStefan, we need to blow up\nsomething and I know that you can do it.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re a dirty Communist. I wouldn\u2019t\nbend my finger to do anything for you.\u201d \u201cBut you know, you really got to help us. You\nreally got to help us.\u201d So I talked to my commander and my commander said, \u201cOh, you\nstupid so and so. Go help them? If you go and lose your behind, it will serve you well\nbecause you lost your head already.\u201d But he reconsidered. Few days later he came and\nsaid, \u201cYes, you can go and help them. I talked \u2014 we talked.\u201d So they provided me with\ntwo \u2014 well, they gave me two of my boys and myself and a load of explosives. And\nprovided us with a German chauffeur. German chauffeur who was carrying a truckload of\narm \u2014 war material to a certain spot. And we\u2019re going to that spot. It was kind of an army\nfilled depot. There were a lot of explosives there and then tanks and aircraft bombs and\nGod knows what else. So he left us out in the forest. He went and delivered the stuff and\nthen came back and he was going to wait for us in the forest. And I was told, \u201cYou send\none boy, if he doesn\u2019t make it, send a second one. Don\u2019t go yourself, because if you go,\nyou get court martialed when you get back.\u201d So one of my boys went in, he went under\nthe first wire and had a little shovel, dug out. Then he went to a second wire and a dog\ngot him. And the guards, the SS guards came in and shot him. And well, he didn\u2019t suffer\nbecause they shot what he had with him and he just gro\u2014 got blown up to smithereens. So\nthen I said, \u201cWell, your turn.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going.\u201d I said, \u201cBut you have to, you\nswore.\u201d \u201cYou can shoot me, I\u2019m not going. I\u2019m not going to help those son of a bitches\nagainst those son of a bitches.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t have much choice, do we? I\nhave to shoot you.\u201d \u201cWell, go ahead and shoot me. You\u2019re my friend. I would rather be \u2014\nbe shot by a friend than \u2014 then relative.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to try, but\nbe sure when we come back, don\u2019t you ever tell.\u201d Said, \u201cDll save my life, I won\u2019t tell.\u201d\nSo I went \u2014 I went to the first place, I went to a second place, there was still stuff around.\nIt was muddy also, but was quite muddy from the person who blew up. And a dog came\nand for quite sometime \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I had \u2014 it\u2019s like I had affinity with dogs.\nActually when we walked \u2014 my group walked to the village and I was with them, not a\nsingle dog would bark. And a bunch of dogs would fo\u2014 I would go \u2014 walk behind and a\nbunch of dogs would follow me and squeal \u2014 wanted to be petted. So the dog came and\nhe squealed and I petted him and he raised his \u2014 his \u2014 his leg and sprayed me from head\nto toe. I was so mad at that dog. I said, \u201cIf that was elsewhere, I would show you what 1s\nwhat.\u201d And the guards came by and the dog followed them and I was right at their feet\nthere. They never looked. So I scrambled in \u2014 I walked in. I had \u2014 I always ruled by 17, I\nhad \u2014 my lucky 17. So I went for my 17 charges, put them here and there. Then I got out\nthe same way, I watched the guards when they just passed. I got from \u2014 was a kind of a\nhalf truck standing nearby, got from behind it. Scrambled under one wire and a second\nwire and ran like hell. Got to my boy, grabbed him and we both ran like hell. We got to\nthe forest. Probably was a good kilometer, was like three-fourths of a mile. He started the\ntruck, we drove. We drove like hell for about 10 - 15 minutes and it blew up. The first\nexplosion blew up all the windows in the truck, back and front. And then it blew and it\nblew and it blew and it blew. It was just like an atomic f \u2014bomb fireworks. They were\npreparing pa \u2014 putsch on Moscow and the Russians \u2014 and the Russian under \u2014 Soviet\nunderground wanted badly to demolish this. So that\u2019s why my boys, after the war were\ninvited to the big party. \u201cYou did for us, you did for us, but now we don\u2019t need you any\nmore. Also, people like you we don\u2019t need here. Out you go.\u201d And they asked about me\nand they said, \u201cThe Germans got him, probably killed him.\u201d",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting, I hear more bitterness in your voice about that than I have heard about\nother things.",
        "A: Well, yes. I think we \u2014 I thought we did them, did them a favor. I was sorry to have done\nit, but was fun to blow up that thing. Oh my God, it was just like a \u2014 like a Easter\nMonday \u2014 like Easter Sunday. You should see those explosions, sky high, flying in every\ndirection. Oh, it was a blow out. I was practically intoxicated watching it. But we were\nrepaid and my friend Stefan Wojtyla mentioned it. He said, \u201cThey would never do\nanything to you.\u201d So later on I wrote to somebody, \u201cAsk Stefan what happened to my\nfour boys.\u201d Later on he said, talked to some, \u201cIt was an aberration.\u201d Anyway, he went to\nhis rewards. I don\u2019t know, maybe he \u2014 maybe he became a good Christian and 1s happy in\nparadise, playing the lyre. But I kind of suspect that the good Lucifer is poking him with\na fork now, la-bas.!\u201d\u201d",
        "Q: You lived in the \u2014 tell us a little bit about the displaced person\u2019s camps. When you got\nbetter \u2014",
        "A: Yes, when I \u2014 when I recei\u2014 became better, I was in a \u2014 a Hohenfels, then I was in Lohr,\nwhich was not really \u2014 it was like a hospital, it was called sanatorium. Then I became\nbetter and I went \u2014 was sent to Aschaffenburg, Jager Kaserne,'~\u2019 a displaced person\ncamp. And I kind of convalesced there for a short while. Then I work in the kitchen for a\n'*? There (French)\n'* Barrack (German)\ntime and I became an accountant in the kitchen. Well, the Jager Kaserne was disbanded,\nwe went to a da \u2014 different Kaserne, closer to Aschaffenburg, within a city, stay there for\na time. Then I worked as a courier there, for a time, between those three camps. There\nwas Ukrainian camp and two Polish camps. Then we were se \u2014 to \u2014 moved again to a\ncamp, Wildflecken, which 1s close to Schweinfurt in Bavaria. It was enormous German\narmy camp. I think it was the ski troops that were trained there. Enormous, there were\nprobably 15 - 20,000 refugees there. By that time I was \u2014 for a time I was stenographer\nfor the police force and then became a detective and worked there for the duration as a\ndetective until I left in 1949 for America.",
        "Q: What did you investigate?",
        "A: Local crimes, there were some murders, there were some rapes, there were some so\ncalled sui\u2014 faked up suicides \u2014 murders that looked like suicides. There were malpractice,\nmedical malpractice. I had one medical malpractice where a lady went to have a appendix\ntaken and the doctor forgot to tie one blood vessel and she bled to death, into her\nabdomen. And some interesting cases. Shoot \u2014 shoot-outs with gangs occasion, but very\nseldom.",
        "Q: Gangs?",
        "A: Well, there were Polish gangs that went \u2014 black market operators mostly. Well, if for\ninstance, we\u2019d go to a farm and they would need a cow, they put boots on a cow legs and\nlead the cow to the camp and lead the cow to the fourth floor to the attic and slaughter it\nand have a lot of meat to sell. It was all kind of shenanigans going on. And from time to\ntime I would make a document for somebody. See, people who escaped from across \u2014\nfrom there \u2014 behind Iron Curtain, some want \u2014 some had a hard time documenting\nthemselves. So when I felt that somebody was not guilty of anything and worthy, more or\nless, I would \u2014 I was specialist in sacram\u2014 sac\u2014 document forging. When I was still in\nPolish underground, I went through a crash course and worked for sometime in the so\ncalled \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201d Kind of got to \u2014 little vacation from my group. From a\nfighting group. So I could make documents. I can make you a document. I can make a\nstamp. I can forge your signature or your signature and your signature, if I \u2014 if I want to \u2014\nif I practice long enough.",
        "Q: There\u2019s a thread here, it\u2019s like you\u2019re very good at investigating and underground work\nand being, I think probably really analytical in assessing situations and being able to\nfigure out how to handle them.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I\u2019m still alive, I think. Of course, holy providence had something to do with\nit, but most of the time I avoided getting killed. I got beaten \u2014 I, I got almost finished off\none time, when I worked in a tunnel. I had a Kapo who was a Czech, he hated Poles and\nhe hated me specially. \u201cYou shitty little Polack.\u201d He would beat me up and do things to\nme. So, one time I was working up \u2014 up there and he was passing by and I took the\nrailroad tie and I put \u2014 put it down on him. Got him hit quite badly. Anyway, I was very\nsympathetic when I later on saw him. \u201cOh, Gabriel you get hurt? Oh, you poor thing,\nwhat happened to you?\u201d He said, \u201cSome son of a bitch tossed a railroad tie on me.\u201d\nAnyway poor Gabriel got so bad that he lost his Kapo job and he got the shits and if you\ngot those, you got loose stomach in a camp, you are done. So, I even went and burned my\nportion of bread for two days and fed it to him. Cause if you got very loose stomach,\nwhich was a killing thing, three days you are done \u2014 if you had enough bread and charred\nit and ate it, it would stop it. So I fed the poor Gabriel with my own bread and every time\nI turn around, I felt like spitting in my face, helping that old son of a gun. I mean he was\nold, he was 31, but he was old in comparison, I mean he was. And I don\u2019t even know if\nhe survived or not because I was transferred to a different barrack and he stayed in the\nsame barrack. I don\u2019t know if he made it or not. That old Gabriel, Angel Gabriel, he was\nnot. I still got a little scar, he one time chopped me with a \u2014 with a shovel, just swung the\nshovel and cut me right over my forehead.",
        "Q: How did you have compassion for him?\nEnd of Tape #9\nTape #10\n[Technical conversation]",
        "Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewsk1i. It is April 8, 1998. We are outside of\nMinneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape 10.\nHow \u2014 how did you have compassion for someone like the Czech Kapo?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I felt sorry for that \u2014 for that old, shitty son of a gun. I kind of forgot what\nhe had been before and didn\u2019t really dwell upon it. Things happen and you go. And\nordinarily we did help one another. We did help one another. It was kind of a dog eat dog\nat times, when some people tried to get to the top and become a top dog, they had to kill\nand steal and do the horrible things. But there was cases people did help one another. I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I felt compassion or if I were just \u2014 saw him so miserable, I said,\n\u201cOkay, you dog, eat that bread. Maybe \u2014 maybe your loose stomach will stop.\u201d",
        "Q: Did he change his attitude towards you, afterwards?",
        "A: He was still grumbling. He didn\u2019t call me names any more. Because I wa- by that time I\nwas stronger. And he lost his job. He lost his job. He was not a lord almighty any more.\nHe could kill all 25 people he had, in one day, if he wanted to. He would get 20 \u2014 a pack\nof cigarettes for it. He did beat many people, I don \u2014 never saw him kill anybody, but he\ncould if he wanted to. So maybe he wasn\u2019t very bad. But angel Gabriel, he was not.",
        "Q: How \u2014 how do you think that \u2014 that \u2014 those experiences in the war and then 1n the camps,\nhow did they shape you as a person?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they made me any better. Maybe they made me a little more understanding.\nBut they did not deflate my ego. And I still talk a blue streak. Well, they made me \u2014\nsurviving it made me very thankful, as I previously said. I never prayer \u2014 had \u2014 pray a\nprayer of petition. I always say a small prayer of thanksgiving. So it made me appreciate\nlife and the presently, I mean, I wake up every morning and I feel so free. And I\u2019m not\nhungry and I\u2019m not cold. And I have a darn good job. I love books and I work with\nbooks. I buy a lot of books, I\u2019 Il sell a few books. Ill read. I work five and a half days in\nthe bookstore. Every second Monday, you go to public library, we get our 10 or 15\nbooks, so we have something to read. Sylvia reads too, a lot.",
        "Q: Your wife?",
        "A: My wife, Sylvia reads a lot, too. And every Thursday Sylvia comes downtown on a bus\nand we have lunch and we talk blue streak. Because normally, after supper \u2014 when she\nhas supper ready when I come from work. I come on a bus and I walk a mile. We eat\nsupper, I wash the dishes and we sit with our noses in a book. So, to preserve domestic\ntranquillity, we get together once a wook \u2014 once a week and we have a lunch out. Just\nlike one person said, I think it was a good saying, \u201cMy family \u2014 family ate out a lot, but\nthey always went to the cheap places.\u201d That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: You said that you wake up and you think, \u201cI\u2019m not cold, I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d",
        "A: And I\u2019m free.",
        "Q: \u201cAnd I\u2019m free.\u201d And that made me wonder, 1s that feeling of \u2014 of having everything taken\naway from you, of being hungry, or your freedom being taken away, 1s that a really real\nfeeling sometimes? Can you remember it like it\u2019s right there?",
        "A: I can \u2014 I can\u2019t remember it. Occasionally \u2014 well mainly, what \u2014 I remember it in the \u2014 in\ndreams. I used to have nightmares. Presently I have them very seldom. I probably will\nhave one next couple nights. When I saw Schindler\u2019s List \u2014 after I saw Schindler\u2019s List, |\nhad a couple real \u2014 just almost like \u2014 like it really happened there and I was there back \u2014\nback there. But it is so far away. One time, St. Paul Cathedral was showing a film,\nNacht'** \u2014 Night and Fog. The film still exists. It was made by the Polish French\ncompany and you can still get the video of it. Anyway, I was asked to come and watch\nwith them and to talk about it later on. Well, it was shortly after I came here and after that\nwent \u2014 that went through, I could not talk, mainly because I saw the steps. Hundred and\neighty-six steps from a stone quarry, leading to the camp in Mauthausen. And I walked\nthose steps for 11 days, carrying a big stone. When you first came into Mauthausen, you\nwent through the introduction, you were put in a Strafkommando, punishment company.\nYou went down to the quarry and you went up, you went down. Oh, it was about six,\nseven times a day and you took the biggest stone you could carry, because if you didn\u2019t,\nwhen you got to about 100 steps up, the Kapo would look and said, \u201cHey you and you\nand you and you, step out there. You stupid so and so. Look at the rest of them, they are\njust breaking down, getting ruptures. And you took two those little stones?\u201d So he give\nthem a push and they would fly down. And that happened just about every day. Five, 10 -\n15 -20 people would be killed a day, in the Strafkommando. And sometime, when he had\na special order, they would make people run. It was Fliegerbriicke,'\u201d the flying bridge.\nThere was a kind of a little platform and he would run people to the platform and they\nwould fly down, like two or 300 feet. And then the quarry supervisor started complaining\nthat they messed \u2014 \u201cHe is messing up my work, so make him stop. That so and so is\n'** Night (German)\n'\u00b0 Flyer\u2019s bridge (German)\nmessing up my work. He had all those \u2014 those \u2014 all that mess, those smashed prisoners\nthere. I have to clean it up every day.\u201d\nSo it kind of abated, but he was still killing people. If he didn\u2019t do that, when you \u2014 didn\u2019t\nlike you or you got close up and the upper was kind of a steep road into the gate, front\ngate of the Grosse Tor \u2014 he would take your hat, we had those stripped berets \u2014 he would\ntake it and make it fly beyond the post line. And you had to put your stone down,\neverybody waited and you went to retrieve it. And that was a no-no, because it was\nbeyond the line, and people up on the tower there would open up and shoot you.\nSometimes they would just wound you, most of the time they would kill you. And you\nhad to go and retrieve your hat because if you walked to the gate, you had to take your\nhat and walk at attention, you know, your hat to your leg and walk stiffly and carry your\nbig stone here, you know. Straighten up. SS at the gate, if you did not have a hat to take\noff, they would take you \u2014 take you aside and beat you \u2014 most of the time they would\ntake you aside and shoot you. There would be pile of people, dead bodies on the side,\npeople who did not have their hats with them. Those little exercises. I made it for 11 days\nand lived to tell. Anyway, it was kind of a little introduction to the system.",
        "Q: And so when you saw those steps again \u2014",
        "A: When I saw those steps, I could not talk. Hundred and eighty-six steps \u2014 stone steps,\nquite steep. Just try to walk 180 \u2014 80 steep \u2014 86 steps carrying nothing, at a good clip. I\ndon\u2019t think I could now. I walk up a bunch of steps when you go to state park and you\nhear, \u201cOh, let\u2019s stand down for awhile, Steven, let\u2019s take a rest.\u201d",
        "Q: Does it surprise you, what you were able to endure?",
        "A: Yes, it does. But in that time, it was nothing. I just thought I was tough son of a gun. I\ncouldn\u2014 I could do anything. Especially after surviving two and a half, almost \u2014 well not\nexactly three \u2014 is about two and a half years in Polish underground with a \u2014 with a\nfighting group. That was a survival. Later on, camp at times, was almost like a \u2014 well,\nkind of a mild danger. You avoid this, you avoid that, you may live forever. You are\nhungry, maybe you can organize something, you can steal something. Maybe somebody\nwill give you piece of bread. Maybe you\u2019ll catch a dog.",
        "Q: And so, just tell us a little bit about how you left the displaced person\u2019s camp.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014I stayed and worked most of the time, most of the people didn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t\nwant to. People who stay in places who don\u2019t have to work, they don\u2019t want to work. We\ntalk sometime about our welfare people, they\u2019re paid little and not to have to work.\nPeople who don\u2019t work, won\u2019t work. There were probably \u2014 out of five, eight, 10,000, in\nWildflecken, maybe 200 of us who worked. The rest of the people didn\u2019t. And I knew\none person who was a black market operator, he was a rich \u2014 one rich young man. And\neach person were living in a camp had to donate half a day work to the camp, like\nchopping trees for the fuel, sweeping streets or doing something. Well, he didn\u2019t. So he\nwas called to the camp director and the camp director said, \u201cMr. So and So, I have a\nreport here you haven\u2019t worked last week.\u201d And said, \u201cMr. Director, that\u2019s a lie. I never\nworked.\u201d \u201cYou never worked? You are supposed to work.\u201d \u201cI pay well, people who go\nand work for me. When my time comes, there is a person who goes and works for me\nhard, for half a day or a day, I pay him well. Mr. Director, that\u2019s a lie, I never worked.\u201d\nThat was the mentality of \u2014 that people developed. Later on when they went to various\ncountries, there were some were repatriated to Poland, but very few. When Communism\ntook over, they did not want to, as I didn\u2019t want to. Many went to Canada, many went \u2014\nmany \u2014 some \u2014 everybody wanted to come to America. Some went to Belgium, some\nwent to England. Many went to Australia and New Zealand. While those people had \u2014 at\ntimes had a hard time adjusting back and going back to work. So I stayed in Wildflecken\nuntil 1949 and the U.S. Catholic Conference found a sponsor here and I went through the\nconsul and a doctor and document this and document that \u2014 all kind of little documents.\nAs the Russians said, \u201cS propiskom vsy\u00e9 mozhna'\u201d\u00b0 zrobic.'*\u201d\u201d With a little card, you can\ndo almost anything. Ru\u2014 in Russia, if you had to have a propiska'** to move from place to\nplace, to visit next village, you have to have a propiska issued by police because you\ncannot move freely. Well, now maybe you can, but that time you could not. So all this\nlittle documents and you had to go through a doctor and \u2014 well, I worked part time with\nAmerican CIC. '*\u201d They came one time when I was still in Aschaffenburg.",
        "Q: CIC?",
        "A: The American CIC people came and talked to me and said, \u201cWe are catching some of the\nGerman criminals and we kind of feel that you may some \u2014 have something against it,\nwould you want to help us?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d \u201cHow much you want to paid?\u201d \u201cPaid? If I had\nmoney, I would pay you.\u201d CIC was the counter-intelligent corps, U.S. Army. There were\ntwo captains who worked there and I worked with them until full maturation. One or two\ndays a week I would get release from the police force and work with them. We went\nacross the green border into East Germany and occasionally apprehended somebody who\nwas being searched for and brought him back.",

        "Q: The Nazis, okay.",
        "A: And then questioned them. Then when they had Polish Nazis questioned, I would help\nthem question. Then when he had Polish Communists sneaking in, I would help them\nquestion those. So then they helped me a lot, too \u2014 to go through and get in. Yes, but was\nmostly the Catholic organization who found me sponsor here. I came to St. Paul, I lived\nwith a old couple \u2014 old, ancient couple for quite some time, paid room and board. Then I\nmoved out and leaded my little \u2014 one little single room overlooking the whole city. I had\na beautiful view, it was up on a hill. Old house with little rooms and a landlady who\ncharged us very little rent. It was a very carefree life.",
        "Q: Is there something that I haven\u2019t asked you that you\u2019d like to say?",
        "A: Not really, I think we just did almost everything. Oh yes. Yes, I\u2014 I met Hans Christian,\nwho was my interrogator.",
        "Q: Your German interrogator?",
        "A: Yes, my German interrogator. Ph.D. from Heidelberg University. He was arrested, he\nwas in jail under different name and Captain Wulkanowski took me \u2014 took me to\nBriickenau, where the man was in jail and he said, \u201cStefan, maybe you would like to talk\nto this man, he speaks Polish.\u201d So they took me to his cell and I said, \u201cHans Christian,\nwhat are you doing here?\u201d \u201cWas machen Sie da hier?'*\u201d\u201d And he looked, he said,\n\u201cStefan?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cDu bist no\u2019 nit tot?\u2019*'\u201d I said, \u201cWell, if I was dead, I\u2019m resurrected.\u201d\nSo I asked him what his name is and he had different name. I said, \u201cHis name is Hans\nChristian. He was in \u2014 a Gestapo interrogator. When he was questioning me, he took me\nout four times and shot next to me, four different people and told me I was going to be\nthe next one if I don\u2019t tell him what he wants to know. And I know that those people are\nnot tried to be executed.\u201d I testified against him. So he \u2014 Mister \u2014 Captain Wulkanowski\nsaid, \u201cWell\u201d \u2014 he chain him. He chain him to the bed. He said, \u201cStay a while. Beat the\nshit out of him.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, Il stay with him for awhile.\u201d So we \u2014 I stayed and we\ntalked. He said, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to beat me?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to beat you.\nYou will get your reward.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, you know, really, I didn\u2019t want to beat you\neither, but I was doing my job.\u201d Said, \u201cWell, now I would be doing my job.\u201d So then I\nknocked on the door and said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m going to testify against you, I know\nwho you are.\u201d And I did. And I understand that couple years later he wa\u2014 couple years\n'\u00b0\u00b0 What are you doing there here? (German)\n'S! Aren\u2019t you dead yet? (Austrian German)\nlater he was hanged. But I wasn\u2019t asked to come to the execution. And Captain\nWulkanowski, I walked out and said, \u201cTake my pistol, go and shoot the son of a bitch.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cShoot him? You people can hang him, I don\u2019t want to shoot him.\u201d Yeah, Hans\nChristian. Beautiful, tall, blonde man with blue eyes and beautiful bleach hair.",
        "Q: Some people would have wanted to kill him.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. We promised ourselves, when we were in a camp, when we were 1n Gusen,\nwhen the freedom come, if we are alive, we will go burning, killing. Not raping because\nwe are not strong enough, but we will do horrible things here. Nobody did anything. The\nonly one atrocity that we committed \u2014 that people committed in a camp \u2014 was a Spanish\nfrom a Spanish civil war \u2014 his name was Santacara. He was Oberkapo'\u201d of the first shift.\nHe had under him about 20,000 people. And he beat people and he killed people, he\ndrowned people. If, if somebody he didn\u2019t like, he would just pick them up and \u2014 and tip\nhim.\n[Technical conversation]\nHe was very bad person, he would \u2014 didn\u2019t like somebody, he would lead a person to a\nwashroom, pick him up and put him in the barrel head first and drown him. I mean he\nwas just a bad person. Anyway, there were a bunch of Russians who hated him, because\nhe especially hated Russians, I don\u2019t know why, because he was a Spanish Communist\nand the Russians were Russian Communists, but he hated them. So they nailed him \u2014\nthey stripped him, they nailed him to the barrack by hands and feet and they took a heavy\nmachine gun and they shot him to pieces. And I watched \u2014 when I was in the hospital I\nwatched out of my window \u2014 was \u2014 my bunk was next to the window, I watched it. And I\nasked, \u201cWho that was?\u201d \u201cOh, was Santacara.\u201d \u201cOh, Santacara. May God be merciful of\nhis, of \u2014 over \u2014 over his mortal soul \u2014 immortal soul.\u201d So I know one \u2014 saw one atrocity\ncommitted by the former prisoners.",
        "Q: Is there anything else? Besides these things? I have got one question I\u2019ve got ask you.\nOkay.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: You said that you\u2014 [Break in tape] befriend him and how did \u2014 how\u2014? Did he know who\nyou were?\n'*? Senior foreman (German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to supervise Kapos.",
        "A: Yeah, well we met \u2014 we met in a beer joint, I mean we were \u2014 a drinking place. And there\nwere a couple street girls with me and I introduced him to them and he said, \u201cDo you\nwant to come tomorrow, have a drink with me? I\u2019ll bring some good schnapps.\u201d So I\ncame the next day. Instead of watery beer, he had some good schnapps, we had a drink\nand we used to meet from time to time. And he even did me little favors. He liked those\ntwo girls, apparently. So later on discovered he was the supply officer, I kind of went\nclo\u2014 and I showed a bunch of money, said, \u201cWould you like some money?\u201d \u201cJa, Ja.'*\u00b0\nWhat do you want me to sell you?\u201d I said, \u201cA Schmeisser.\u201d \u201cJa.\u201d \u201cZwei Schmeissers?\u2019*\u201d\u201d\n\u201cJa.\u201d \u201cFiinf und zwanzig Schmeissers?'\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cTwenty-five Schmeissers?\u201d \u201cJa. Wieviel?\u2019\u00b0\u201d\nSo I said, \u201cWell, about 200,000 marks.\u201d \u201cWell, zwei hundert, tausend?'*\u2019 Hundert\nSchmeissers.'\u00b0*\u201d \u201cGanz gut.\u201d So he \u2014 he sold it to me. He had it delivered to a place\nwhere I want it, driving the truck himself, we unloaded it. He went \u2014 happy with his\nmoney. A good German can sell you his mother or daughter. Well, I have a \u2014 after the\nwar I had a lady who used to do my washing, a German lady, refugee lady who had a\nbunch of children and she escaped from the eastern part of Germany to western part of\nGermany, she has a daughter, was \u201cRita the Virgin.\u201d And I went out with her daughter a\nfew times and she says, \u201cStefan, be sure that you don\u2019t go to sleep with my daughter.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cFrau Anders, '*\u2019 I would never go to sleep with a beautiful young girl.\u201d \u201cRita is a\nvirgin.\u201d Well, we called her from then on, we called \u201cRita the Virgin.\u201d \u201cI would let Rita\nsleep with a rich American who would give me a big bag of Polen kaffee'*\u201d \u2014 unground\ncoffee. Because ground coffee was always adulterated. If a rich American came and gave\nme a big bag of Polen kaffee, I would let him sleep with Rita.\u201d So, a good German can\nsell you anything you want to, if you pay enough. Also I was lucky. He could have\nreported me. He could have shot me on the stop \u2014 spot, too, because he was armed.",

And I think I was on the way to\nsee a pretty girl.\nThis was taken shortly after I did get out of a hospital and went to sanatortum. My hair\ngrow up and I gained a lot of weight.

So he left only a little, tiny scar there.\nBut I still \u2014 when I take my hat off, I kind of remember that blood running and the whole,\nhorrible, open thing there, just like my top of a head was completely open down to the\nbrains. But it wasn\u2019t, the \u2014",

        "A: Very well. My name is Stefan Czyzewski. I was born in 1922, in a little town of\nLesnogora, Poland. Lesnogora is in central Poland, about 45 kilometers east of Warsaw.\nIt\u2019s a small hamlet, you cannot even find it on a map, but it\u2019s still there. Last time I wrote\nto somebody there, it still was there.",
        "A: To live there?",
        "A: Oh, it was a farm \u2014 a farming community. There was no industry of any kind, just farms.\nThere was one little store, kind of a general store, one room little store, ran by a Jewish\nfamily. The rest of the people were all Polish peasants working on a farm.",
        "A: Yes. My father was Jan Czyzewski, he was a farmer. My mother was Bogumila\nCzyzewski, nee Boruc. My mother was an \u2014 was a schoolteacher. And she was a\nfrustrated schoolteacher. When she married and had a first child, which was me, she\nwould not be hired to work any more. So she was really frustrated. By a time I was three,\nshe taught me how to read and I never stopped. I fell in love with books and I have been\nreading ever since.",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 the farms in that part of Poland were a kind of a variety farm. The land was\nrather poor, so they planted just about everything that they needed and in \u2014 everything\nthey could sell. They planted a lot of cabbage and a plenty of potatoes and some wheat\nand also a lot of rye. Our land was in many little pieces, so we had to travel from a\nvillage to work on, on the land. My father \u2014 just about like me \u2014 spent a lot of time in\nstrange places. The part of Poland that we lived in before 19 \u2014 in \u2014 before 1900\u2019s, were\noccupied by Russia, Czarist Russia. My father was conscripted, or drew a lot and spent\n12 and a half years in Czar\u2019s imperial army. He came back home for six months and the\nfirst war \u2014 world war started. He was called again and did fight on the western front\nagainst \u2014 against Germans. And of course he heard some Polish people speaking across\nthe front lines, so he walked across one night and thought he would join them. Instead of\nthat, they put him in a prisoners of war came \u2014 camp. And they sent him way, way out\nwest, close to the western front line betw \u2014 a li \u2014 a front line between France and\nGermany. And again, well he was \u2014 at that time he was a sapper. He was a fortification\nspecialist. So the Germans gave him a group of people, group of prisoners and they built\nfortifications \u2014 a kind of a front line fortification system at Verdun. And probably\neverybody heard of that horrible battle at Verdun, where more than half a million people\nwere killed. So he did, and the Germans of course, were very appreciative, so he put him\nin a fr \u2014 one morning they put him in a front of a squad that he was in and gave him\nGerman Ritterkreuz* or, or Eisern\u2014Eisernekreuz\u2019 \u2014 German, German decoration,\nbecause the part that he built there \u2014 the French could not overrun it. They tried several\ntime, they couldn\u2019t overrun it. Anyway, a few days later, he heard Polish people speaking\nacross the line on the French side. So he walked across. And the Po \u2014 he joined Polish\nLegion that was fighting on the French side. Couple nights later he led the French into\nthe part of the fortification that he built. They overran it, they kicked the Germans out\n* Knight\u2019s Cross (German)\n* Tron Cross (German)\nand the French gave him the Croix de Guerre*. So he had German decoration, he had\nFrench decoration. Later on, the Polish Legion gave him Virtuti Militari,\u2019 Polish cross.\nSo when my father came back home after the wars, he didn\u2019t brag much about it. As a\nmatter of fact, my family didn\u2019t know about it. I was the only one that he showed the\ncrosses to and he told little about what happened. When he came home, he brought some\nthings. He brought a French army coat and he brought a pair of American army boots.\nAnd he had those boots until 1940\u2019s. They were pair of clodhoppers. They had a big,\nround toes, but he said, \u201cThose are the best boots I ever had.\u201d They were ugly, but he\nsaid, \u201cThey are sewed, they are glued and nailed. You can never wear them out.\u201d\nOccasionally on \u2014 on a big holiday, he would put those boots on and para\u2014 shine them\nand parade around it. And everybody was look and said, \u201cJan, where do you get those\nugly boots?\u201d He said, \u201cYou better shut up, those are American boots, those are the best\nboots I ever had.\u201d",
        "A: He talked a blue streak to me, but he would not talk to anybody else. And of course he\ntalked about all the girlfriends he had. The great Russian girlfriend he had. And the great\nGerman girlfriend he had. And of course, he had a great French girlfriend.",
        "A: Yes, I had two sist\u2014 I had \u2014 have two sister, who are in their late 60\u2019s or early 70\u2019s. When\nI was arrested, they were a \u2014",
        "A: Yes, the older one is Henryka. She is about 71. The younger one is \u2014 or was \u2014 is Eleanor\nor Eleonora. She\u2019s about 68 or 69. When I was arrested, they were like 12 and 14. And\ntwo years ago, they came to visit me. And I said, \u201cWell gee! I left two pretty little girls,\nwhat do I see now? Two old, litthe woman.\u201d And my sister Eleonora is outspoken, she\nsaid, \u201cWho do you think you are? You\u2019re a old, little man.\u201d\n* War Cross (French)\n> Courageous Soldiers (Latin); Polish medal awarded for courage in the battlefield.",
        "A: We did get up at the sun raise, or before. And we did little work, like taking care of the\nlivestock, feeding the cows, feeding the pigs and watering the horses and preparing. And\nthen of course \u2014 then after that I went to school. And first three years, we had a village\nschool, was a one room village school. Later on I had to walk to the town of Grebkow,\nwhich was our district, little village, which had seven grade school. So my time was spent\nmostly in school. I would walk at seven in morning to get to be \u2014 to be in school by eight\nand I didn\u2019t come home until about three. So then I helped around the farm. And on\nweekend, on Saturday, I would work with father in a field, but on a weekday, I did not.",
        "A: There were political parties, but they were just practically two. There was the Nationalist\nparty, which was very small and hardly anybody joined it because they were kind of\nchauvinistic and there was the so-called \u201cnon-party\u201d party, which was the government\nparty. And most people were kind of \u2014 not exactly joining it, but supporting it, because\nall the politicians and all the representatives were members of that party. There was quite\na lively social life. There were mostly \u2014 mostly religious holidays and feasts that people\ntook part in it. Like for instance, when the month of May came, every night after supper,\neverybody went to a little shrine and they would be singing lot of hymns and they would\nsing a litany to all the saints and then you would walk home and sing loudly. There was a\nfair, one or two or three religious fairs, that special preachers would come to the church\nand we would walk to church and listen to the preachers and there were booths and\nsouvenirs toe \u2014 tables. And food tables, where you would spend little money to get some\nfood that you normally did not eat at home. Well, every Tuesday there was a\nmarketplace, market day. You would \u2014 father would hitch a horse and we\u2019d take some\nbutter and eggs and some grain and some potatoes and drive to Kaluszyn, where the\nmarket took place and the people from a city would \u2014 housewife would come and buy\nyour butter and buy your eggs. And Kaluszyn was a town of about 12,000 people, of\nwhom about 10,000 were Jewish people. Jewish people were merchants, they were\nprofessional, they were attorneys, they were doctors. They were tailors and shoemakers.\nAnd we traded with them throughout our lives. We always had a family or two or three\nthat we\u2019re very friendly with and visited when we went there. We would start their place\nand maybe get a cup of tea. When they came to see us, we would give them a dozen of\neggs and when they came to visit on the farm.",
        "A: In our village, there was one Jewish family. It was actually first a Jewish man, only, who\nopened a little \u2014 like a grocery and needles and thimble store. Later on he had a wife and\ntwo children. And relations were not strained. We kind of tolerated one another. All\nPolish Jewish people were Orthodox people. They wore special dress, they had\nsideburns, they had peyse\u2019\u00ae, the long side hair. They wore gabardine coats, they wore little\nhats, with a \u2014 little tiny, black hats with a tot \u2014 little tiny visor. And they spoke very\nbroken Polish.",
        "A: The Jewish children would go to public schools that all of us had to go. But, they would\nspend little time there, but most of the time they spent was 1n a cheder. There was a\nJewish cheder, they went and they learned to \u2014 how to write Yiddish and some of them\nwould learn Hebrew. And socially we did not have much to do together. Socially, we\nkept completely apart. We did not mix, or if they did, it was very little mixing between\nthe Jewish people and Polish people.",
        "A: That\u2019s was how the things were. It was not a \u2014 because one hated one another, but was\nsimply because the things were. People gravitated to their own and they did little\nassociation business-wise and also occasionally visited. For instance, we had had a \u2014 a\nJewish peddlers come. There was a Jewish lady, whose name was Golda, who came\ncarrying a big bag and she was trading. She brought sacharyna\u2019 to sell, she brought\nneedles, she brought thread, she brought little pieces of material. She brought\noccasionally a dress or two. And she would take in \u2014 in exchange, she would take eggs\nand butter and some potatoes and maybe some grain.",
        "A: We took the church for granted. We just went to church on Sundays. We went to\nreligious instructions, which were taking place in public school. Once a week, a priest or\na nun would come and take a \u2014 actually the priest or nun came every day, but took one\nclass, for one hour we received our religious instruction. And we went to special\npreparation like for first communion or confirmation. We would go to church in groups\nthat \u2014 which reached certain age and were prepared. We prayed at home frequently, we\nwould say a rosary. Probably not every day, but at least once a week. And we kids hated\n\u00b0 Earlocks worn by Hasidic Jews (Yiddish)\n\u2019 Saccharine (Polish)\nit because we had to kneel for about 45 minutes on a hard floor, so we squirmed and we\ncomplained, but quietly, because father did not take any guff from any kid.",
        "A: Very much so, yes.",
        "A: No, it became \u2014 it was given \u2014 it was given. We did not question. We knew that if you\nwent to college later on, if you went to university, you lost your faith, in parenthesis. You\nlost your faith, because you started questioning. And you started not really believing the\nstories. \u201cWell, those are just stories, you know, Bible is a story and religious stories is a\nstory and life\u2019s of saints, oh, just nice little stories. And the Christians and the lion s, of\ncourse, were also just stories. Maybe true, maybe not. So you don\u2019t have to believe any\nmore, huh?\u201d But there were not many people who went to college and there not many of\nthose who went there, who lost their faith.",
        "A: Yes, they were talking about going not to college, but to go into middle school, which\nback there, it was a gimnazjum,\u00b0 it was equivalent of American college. And I was one of\nthe students who was halfway bright and I di\u2014 gi\u2014 did get grant. They call it stypendium.\u201d\nI went to \u2014 for two years to the city of Wegrow, which was about 15, 18 miles, it was our\ncounty seat. I went to this \u2014 I call it gimnazjum, before the war came and ended it all.",
        "A: I started at \u2014 I was 15 and I ended when I was 17, when the war came, I was almost 17\nwhen the war came.",
        "A: Well, they wanted badly to go \u2014 to let me go, but they could not afford it. The fees were\nsteep. So I did get a so-called stypendium from the county. There were two kids from the\ncounty who passed the examination and I was the second one. The first one was a girl\n* Grammar school (Polish)\n\u201d Scholarship (Polish)\nwho was bright and I hated her. Competed with her all \u2014 all my grade four, five and six\nand seven. And she just almost always beat me to it, except in the literature.",
        "A: Not really. They were so proud, they were so damn proud, I was ashamed sometime\nwhen they bragged about it.",
        "A: \u201cWell, he\u2019s bright. See, he can read. He could read when he was four.\u201d To take it back,\nwhen I was about eight or nine, my uncle Bronislaus got married. They lived in a big,\nramshackle house. His wife brought a bunch of books. Those were th\u2014 those were the\nbooks I was not supposed to read. They\u2019re called in the French Romances. Of course I\ndid, I sneaked out and read them, I mean I just read them day and night. And of course I\ngot caught. My mother said, \u201cAha. Those books you are not supposed to read, but I guess\nI won\u2019t prevent you from reading it, so to counter with, every night after supper, after\nyou eat supper, you are going to read the Bible, aloud.\u201d \u201cBible? What do I want to read\nthe Bible for?\u201d \u201cWell, you are going to read it if you want to or not.\u201d So I did, for half an\nhour, then 45 minutes, then one hour. The neighbor\u2019s kids were laughing, \u201cHoo, he is\nreading Bible.\u201d Pretty soon the neighbors kids started coming in to listen, because the\nOld Testament stories are fascinating, bloody and murder at times. Especially if you\ncome to the Book of Judith, I mean that was a real story. So, after supper, there\u2019d be a\nbunch of kids sitting, later on, in winter, I mean and we had no electricity, just a ga\u2014 a\nkerosene lamp there. Adult neighbors would be coming and listening to those stories of\nOld Testament, especially the Book of Judith when she \u2014 she went to sleep with him and\ngot up in a middle of a night, I mean the leader, the whole affair and this leader of the\nPhilistines \u2014 got up in a middle of a night, chopped off his head and took it with her. I\nmean, those were great stories. By the time I was 14, I read the Bible aloud twice. So I\npretend to know something about Bible.",
        "A: Well, it was a given that I was going to be a farmer. I would inherit most of my father\u2019s\nfarm, pay off my sisters. I had different ideas, I wanted to live in a city and get ajob ina\ncity, especially af\u2014 I, after I went for two years to gimnazjum, I was \u2014 I knew everything.\nBut I didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t talk much about it because my father was a choleryk.' He had a\nshort temper. If you said anything that he didn\u2019t like, you got walloped.\n'\u00b0 Spitfire (Polish)",
        "A: Very much so. Kind of, but not exactly on a defensive, but very close-knit family.",
        "A: We were very much aware that the war was coming. I mean, we \u2014 we just \u2014 we just felt it\nin our bones. And the political shenanigans, negotiations and so on and so forth, we knew\nwe were going to fight Germany. We never expected to find the Soviets. We had, of\ncourse, Non-aggression Pact with the So \u2014 pact with the Soviets. We did not expect to\nfight them, but we knew we were going to fight the Germans. There\u2019s a Polish joke, later\non developed, you know, when times were the hardest, the most difficult, people were\nbeing killed, mutilated, arrested, sent to camps, gassed \u2014 the Poles made the best jokes.\nWe made the best jokes ever. Scenario \u2014 the Germans come from the west, the Russians\ncome to \u2014 from the we \u2014 east, who do we shoot first? Russians. Pleasure before duty.",

There\u2019s Belgium and Reims,\nFrance, they translated the Bible, the so-called Douai-Reims translation and they said,\n\u201cWhatever was good for Saint Jerome is good for us.\u201d So they translated the whole kit\nand caboodle.\nEndo of Tape #1\nTape #2",

        "A: It was mostly news on the radio and also newspapers, also newspapers. We kind of\nwatched closely, all the political shenanigans. You know, our Ministers of \u2014 of Foreign\nAffairs was going back and forth, was going to France, was going to Germany, was going\nto England, negotiating and negotiating and Germans having more and more power and\nasking for more and more of \u2014 of Poland. We knew that time was coming and of course\nwe knew we\u2019re going to beat the bejesus out of the Germans, turned out differently.",
        "A: It was a vacation time when those things went on, so I was at home. I was back in June\nand there was June, July and it started at the end of August or first of September. So we\ntalked about a lot of it and father said, \u201cWell, we can beat them easily.\u201d And he wanted to\njoin \u2014 he wanted to join, but they wouldn\u2019t take him. Said, \u201cYou old man, go back\nhome.\u201d",
        "A: There was apprehension, but not real fear. We kind of felt that, \u201cWell, regardless how\nbad it is, it\u2019s going to be on the Western border. There may be a stalemate, they may be\ngoing for some time, but most likely they won\u2019t come here.\u201d Of course, later on we, we\nlearned better.",
        "A: Well, first of all, we heard a lot of that perse-persecute-persecution in Germany. We had\nsome Jewish people who came and lived with our Jewish friends in Kaluszyn, who came\nfrom Germany and told a lot how they were being \u201ckicked around,\u201d as \u2014 as they said. The\nGermans had demands \u2014 wanted to have the northern part of Poland, the Polish corridor\nthat we had, going to the Baltic Sea. First they asked for free passage back and forth\nbetween East Prussia and Germany. Later on, they asked for the corridor, they just\nwanted there \u2014 they wanted Gdynia, they wanted Danzig, they wanted the whole\nterritory. And of course, Poland was not about to give it to them, so we knew that a war\nwas on-coming.",
        "A: Yes, we did. We knew it was a policy of the German government. We knew \u2014 our press \u2014\nPola-Poland had quite a free press. I mean there were Socialist papers, there were\nextreme Rightist papers and the general press was kind of in between. So there was a lot\nabout the persecution of minorities in Germany. And also, we knew a lot about the\nhoodlums who came to rule Germany. And we kind of wondered, especially in school,\nwhen I was still in school, that winter and spring before the hostilities started. We talked\na lot with professors and we were greatly impressed always by the German scholarship,\nby the German philosophy, by the German literature. And then we thought, how could\nthat ever happen, that the Germans let themselves be led \u2014 those intelligent, those bright,\nthose advanced Germans can be led by a group of hoodlums of that kind \u2014 of that sort.",
        "A: That summer, we work on farm. I work \u2014 help my father on the farm, we \u2014 we it was \u2014\neverything was almost planted when I came home from school in June, but the harvest\ncame soon, first the hay. And the haying was done all by hand, even the mowing of the\nhay was done by hand. And the first day of haying \u2014 of mowing the hay, when you came\nhome at night, you didn\u2019t feel like eating, you could not sleep, your bone ached, every\nmuscle your body ached. You were pulling the scythe, mowing the hay all day. Second\nday was better, the third day was nothing to it. Then the harvest came, of course and it\nwas a hot, dry summer. The harvest was quite good, so we harvested first the rye, then\nthe wheat, then the potato picking did not come until September. By that time, the war\nwas over, when we picked the potatoes, so it wa\u2014 else, was just about ending. It was a\nsummer of apprehension, a summer of some fear \u2014 what is going to happen? And of\ncourse, when the war started, things started happening.",
        "A: My plans were just about broken. I knew that I probably wouldn\u2019t go to school any more.\nAnd I was very reluctant to stay and work on the farm. And when the war came and we \u2014\nwhen we lost the war to Germans and the Soviets, I knew I was going to be stuck and\nwork on a farm with my father, which \u2014 I was quite resigned to it. Said, \u201cWell, hopefully\nthe war will end and maybe I wi\u2014 I can go back to school and perhaps live \u2014 even live in\na city. But for now, I\u2019m stuck here, so I better make the best of it.\u201d",
        "A: It was \u2014 we knew that it was going to start soon, like in August. And we knew that\nGermany was going to attack soon. And then we heard the news about the Polish \u2014 a\nsmall group attacking Germany, in Silesia \u2014 it was a little town of Glewice, where a\nGerman dressed up a group of their own soldiers in Polish uniforms and attacked their\nradio station, took it over. And of course they had brought bodies from concentration\ncamps, dead bodies and dressed them in Polish uniform \u2014 uniforms and had some\ncasualties there. So we heard about that and of course, few days later, September first,\nthey attacked.",
        "A: In Glewice?",
        "A: Ah, it was a p\u2014a put up affair by the Germans. They dressed up Wehrmacht\" people in\nPolish uniforms and attacked their own radio station. It was the incident that created the\nwar. They had the pretext, \u201cThe Polish \u2014 Poles attacked us and now we have to, of\ncourse, defend ourselves.\u201d",
        "A: It was on a Polish radio, it was in \u2014 was in Polish papers. Polish intelligence at that time\napparently, was quite keen. And they knew all about it.",
        "A: I was in my village, listening to a crystal radio and I thought, \u201cWell, it\u2019s inevitable, the\nwar 1S CO \u2014 war 1s coming and we\u2019ll have to fight.\u201d I was too young to \u2014 to be\nconscripted. My father was too old. He, of course, wanted to go and join. They said, \u201cGo\n\u2014 old man, go back home. You had yours.\u201d",
        "A: Within about three weeks, they were, in our neighborhood, the \u2014 kind of a pincer\nmovement went around Warsaw. The \u2014 Warsaw was still fighting, but they went around\nand approached our neighborhood. There was quite a sharp firefight in my village.\nStarted early morning \u2014 the Polish cavalry came in and some infantry came in. The\ncavalry dismounted and sent horses back and they dug in on the periphery of my village.\nThey had a whole bunch of little, anti-tank artillery. Was two fat wheels, and a horse and\nthey could pull it like the dickens. Two men could pull that little thing. It was very\neffective against German tanks. So they dug in and they were waiting, and of course, the\nGermans attacked. And it\u2019s kind of strange, my father said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you take\nthe cows to the pasture?\u201d And my father dug a dugout for the family, in a garden in the\norchard, so they were \u2014 went all there and I took their horses and the cows to the pasture\nin the back \u2014 way back, beyond the village \u2014 it was a communal pasture. By the time I \u2014 I\ndid get there, I couldn\u2019t come back because there was a \u2014 I mean, was honest to goodness\nfirefight. It was long distance artillery German \u2014 German artillery shooting. And a \u2014a\nkind of bombarding the neighborhood, there was a \u2014 more machine guns going all over,\nso I just stayed behind the village, there, for about two hours. In about two hours, the\nPoles retreated and went and then came two cavalry men, who said, \u201cHey, little boy, do\nyou know that little wood across the hill, there?\u201d \u201cOf course I know it.\u201d \u201cWe have horses\n'' Armed forces (German)\nthere, about 15 horses, can you go and get the horses here?\u201d \u201cOh, sure. Why not?\u201d So I\nstarted running, kind of over the hill \u2014 I run over the hill and there was lot of firing and\ngoing and then I see \u2014 all of a sudden, I was kind of running on the border of a hi \u2014 of a \u2014\nof a field. The border was kind of a strip of grass, it was higher than a field and I see right\nby my feet there, dust flying. And I didn\u2019t think \u2014 think much of it, but it was somebody\nshooting machine gun from a way, way distance there \u2014 German machine gun and hitting\nright where I was running, below my feet. It was several times, right below my feet.\nApparently, whoever was shooting, was shooting little too low, thank goodness. When I\nran to \u2014 I ran over the hill, the horses were gone.\nSo I laid down behind a bunch of trees, big Olszyna'\u201d trees. There were such trees here.\nAnd artillery was shooting and hitting in \u2014 in transit was hitting a top of a trees and\nbranches were falling down. So I just laid there for about half an hour, then it slowed\ndown, I went back to the village, village was on fire and about two-thirds of the village\nwas burned. There were nobody \u2014 no civilian casualties. There were about 35 Polish\nsoldiers, who were killed. There were about 100 of Germans who were killed, back in\napproach the village. There were about 11 tanks that were mashed to smithereens by\nthose little ca \u2014 Polish cannons. And of course the Poles ran away and the Germans came\nin. We were taking \u2014 getting water in pails, out of a \u2014 out of a well and I was \u2014 I climbed\nup on a top of a roof to prevent our house from being burned, because the neighbors\nhouse were burning, so I was handed the pails of water, I was pouring on the \u2014 on the\nroof of the house to prevent it from burning on. And the refugees who are running around\nthe Warsaw, the bunch \u2014 were a group of people from Warsaw who were running around,\n\u201cWhat will happen to us, what will happen to us? The Germans are going to kill us.\u201d\nWell, the German patrol came down the village and they just came, they didn\u2019t bother\nanybody, went across the village and went into the woods beyond the village, where the\nPolish army escaped. And more patrols came and more patrols came. But they were very\ncorrect, they did not bother anybody. They questioned a few men and they took\ndocument \u2014 asked for documents and they did not bother anybody. In \u2014 in other places,\nthey would take young men and \u2014 and kill them. In our village, they were quite correct.",
        "A: Well, kind of, but I was almost a bystander, but I was little foolhardy running over the\ntop of a hill where the shooting is going on. Of course I can \u2014 I could run. I said, \u201cI can\nrun \u2014 outrun anything. Nobody can hit me \u2014 aim and hit.\u201d And they didn\u2019t.\n'? Alder tree (Polish)",
        "A: Well, yeah, sure, of course I told him, I bragged about it. And he said, \u201cGood for you.\u201d\nBecause my father went with horses to the forefront, where the Polish soldiers were dug\nin, he was doing some field work. And when there started shooting, he just stayed with\nthem. And he went to talk to them in a \u2014 1n the \u2014 in foxholes, said, \u201cYou better go there.\nGet on this side, get on this side.\u201d \u201cWhat do you know, old man?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean\nold man? I\u2019m an old soldier. Right here get mutilated, get behind that bush. Dig \u2014 dig a\nlittle foxhole there.\u201d So they did and sure enough, long distance artillery shell came right\nwhere they were and made a hole you can drive \u2014 ride horses 1n it. So they turn and said,\n\u201cWell, you old man, you \u2014 you knew what you were doing.\u201d Well, they retreated. So he\nwent back with them and he wanted a rifle, but they said, \u201cWhy, we don\u2019t give rifles to\ncivilians.\u201d So of course he came home and my sisters and my mother and some of the\nrefugee from Warsaw women were in our dugout there. Of course, everything was\nburning. The pigs were burning and squealing and \u2014 it was kind of a bedlam.",
        "A: Yes. We were lucky. Our house and our barn \u2014 animal barn \u2014 I mean cow barn and our\ngrain barn were not burned, so. We had a lot of people living with us for \u2014 after then.\nSome were relatives who were burnt out, some were neighbors who got burnt out. We\nhad probably 35 people living with us. Was a three room part of a house. We cooked a\nlot. We rescued some of the pigs that were burned and we lived high on the hog for\nseveral weeks.",
        "A: The Germans were not around at all. There was some German police, that went and\nstayed with the Polish Blue Police in the Grebkow by middle, my school village where I\nwent to grade fourth and up. And there were Germans in Wegrow , the county town.\nThere was a\u2014a small army detachment. And later on \u2014 later, later on, there were\nGermans \u2014 German cavalry standing in neighb-\u2014 sitting \u2014 staying in neighboring village,\nbut to my village, 1t came only for a visit. It was a time when they were apparently\npreparing for the eastern front, but of course I wasn\u2019t there then. I was way out of it.",
        "A: People were quite bewildered. They didn\u2019t know exactly what was going to go on. The\ncivil administration was left intact, as it was. They had German supervisors, but on our\nlittle district, there was not even a German supervisor. There was a count and there was a\ndistrict secretary and couple helpers, couple typists. There were a three man police force,\nwhich was staying there and they got orders from a Germans, but not really any orders to\ndo anything unusual, just to keep peace. And of course, bunch of little boys \u2014 I joined the\nunderground organization immediately. I think it was in early \u2014 late September or early\nOctober. We had a swearing in ceremony, one by one, in a cemetery. I can still remember\nit by heart. That was the \u2014 that was the O.P., Obroncy Polski,\u2019 the Defenders of Poland.",
        "A: Well, you swore in that you are joining the defenders of Poland and, \u201cI\u2019m going to obey\nall orders by the organization. I will not disclosed any secrets to the enemy, regardless of\nwhatever happens and I will fight to the end for the freedom of my country.\u201d That was\nabout it. I still remember it in Polish.",
        "A: Not really. And we did \u2014 not much, but we did get together once or twice a week and we\ntalked and we collected arms and ammunition that was dropped by the Polish army, or by\nthe Germans. We had a German light machine gun. We had a Polish light machine gun\nand we had a lot of rifles. I even found a six-shooter. It just \u2014 looked almost like a\nAmerican six-shooter. Of course I gave it away to my commander later on, because he\nhad to have a side-arms and I didn\u2019t need to.",
        "A: There were 12 of us. Just a litt\u2014 from two small villages, from Lesnogora and Zarnowka.\nAnd of course, the swearing ceremony was very young and moving, you know, in a\ncemetery.",
        "A: It was in the evening, yes.",
        "A: Well, the commander came from somewhere, I don\u2019t know where, we\u2019re not supposed to\nknow. And he administered the oath. You would swear upon your grandfather grave.

        "A: All dead.",
        "A: None alive. Mostly were killed. Most of them were dead by 1943.",
        "A: Well, see when I \u2014 when I took my little side trip, they were in their organization. They\nbecame an active, so-called active group. And they went on so-called wet works,\nattacking German patrols, German moving troops, German riding on a freeway toward\nthe eastern front. And they did get mutilated. They got shot and killed and apprehended\nand killed in prisons and \u2014 out of those, I don\u2019t think anybody is still alive.",
        "A: We awaited orders. There were group in almost every small village. Every two villages\nthey had a group. There was a overall command. We don\u2019t know who they \u2014 we didn\u2019t\nknow who they were. They came for a visit, they announced, by runner they would come\nfor a visit, we'll talk to you and they came and talked and gave us instruction and send us\ntrainers, who trained us for the things to come.

We had some\nfamily things to do. I brought some documents to him that he needed. And when I came,\nit was the night where they came. The Soviets NK WD\u2122 came with lists and took\neverybody who was anybody in the Polish administration, with their family. There was a\n' NKVD\njudgment night in a marketplace. There was a town of about 18-20,000 people. They took\n1,800 people. Men who were in administration, who were teachers or preachers or\npolicemen or anybody who were representatives to Polish legislation. And the judgment\ntime took about four and a half hours. It was about like 37 seconds per person. There\nwere three men. There was a man sitting behind a table with a long list, civilian, kind of\nweasely little person.

And if we \u2014 some of us had\nsome money, they wanted Polish money or they wanted goods. They figured a piece of\nclothes, they could get some good food. We bantered, we laughed, we sang a lot. It was\njust accomplished fact, nothing to do \u2014 you can do about it. The guards were not very\nbad. If you wanted to run away \u2014 if you tried to run away, they shot you.

        "A: Waked up in su\u2014 before sunrise, counting \u2014 Appell\u2019, counting. You got a pot of tea,\nwhich was made out of birch leaves. You got a little, tiny piece of bread, maybe half an\nounce or so. You ate it. Then you dressed up and you went walking. If you remember,\nabout four or five years ago, where there was a Olympics in Sarajevo, they showed the\nRussian Siberian man, who was a weightlifter and a wrestler, how he ran a mile in the\nsnow that deep? This is the snow we walked in. It was two guards and about 50 of us and\nwe walked. And the person who walked ahead was changed every hundred feet or so. If,\nfor \u2014 sometime for punishment, if they made one person walk all way, a mile or two or\n\u201d Felt boots (Polish)\n*\u00bb Roll call (German).\nthree miles to the place of work. He \u2014 by the time he got there, he was dead \u2014 breaking\nthe snow. So we went \u2014 we cut trees for about five hours, then came soup at noon. People\ncame with sleds from a camp, with big kettles of fish and cabbage soup. It was mostly\nwater. We sat down and ate the soup, then we cut tree \u2014 trees again and stacked them and\ncame back. Six p.m., we started on the way home, we got there by seven or so. Were\ncounted again, got another pot of tea and a little slice of bread and of course to sleep. We\nhad a good guard. I mean he was a damn Soviet, but he was a good guy, the guard. I\nmean, he was just out of this world. When we did get there, said, \u201cTea. Make fire.\u201d So we\nmade fire. \u201cMake big fire. Sit and rest.\u201d So we sat around and rest. And he looked at his\nwatch, he had a Polish watch that he stole during 1939 campaign, said \u201cpolsky chasy.\u201d'\u201d\nPolish watch runs well. \u201cGo and cut.\u201d So we went and cut for about, oh probably one\nhour. So then, \u201cHey, come on back.\u201d So we came back. \u201cSit and rest. Soup coming.\u201d Oh,\nin about one hour, soup came. \u201cEat.\u201d We ate. \u201cSit and rest.\u201d We sat and rest. \u201cGo and\ncut.\u201d So went and cut for about one hour. And he \u2014 then he went \u2014 came to us there\nwhere we were. \u201cNow, go and steal.\u201d So we went stealing. A prisoner had to cut a cubic\nyard of wood a day. And regardless how young, how strong, how big you were, you\ncould never do it. If you didn\u2019t cut a square yard per person, your group didn\u2019t, at night\nyour soup was cut, your bread was cut accordingly. Next day you were weaker. In a week\nyou were gone. So we would go and steal the wood that we cut day before and day before\nand day before stack it up, he would measure it. \u201cOkay, now we sit down and rest, we go\nhome soon. Make bigger fire.\u201d So we went home. That Ivan Ivanovich was a damn good\nman.\nAlso, I was lucky. I spoke some English, I spoke some German. I spoke Russian quite\nwell. When my father and mother wanted us kid not to know what was going on, they\nspoke Russian. My mother was a Russian teacher in middle school before she got\nmarried. My father was of course, Russian speaking person. So we kids learned it in a\nhurry. We knew exactly what was going on. On the train for six weeks, by the time we\ngot to Siberia, my Russian was almost as good as my English. Much more colorful\nbecause I knew a lot of swear words. So they found out and I was called to the\ncommanders office and he said, \u201cYou stay here, you translate.\u201d And he got the German\nword, \u201cYou dolmetscher.*\u201d\u201d \u201cYou interpreter.\u201d I don\u2019t know how he got that German\nword, I knew what it was, but \u201cYou dolmetscher.\u201d When new prisoners came, I would\nget up on that barrel and I would shout, \u201cHis Excellency, Commander so and so says this\nand says that and says that. You don\u2019t do this, you don\u2019t do that. You get shot for this,\nyou get in solitary for that. You get hunged up for this. So remember.\u201d And of course,\nafter a few days, I\u2014 one time a group of Czechs came and I got up on the barrel and I\nbecame kind of \u2014 took it for granted, became rambunctious \u2014 young, stupid kid.

So he came and he knocked me down and he kicked me. Said, \u201cYou\nlittle so and so, you called me sukin-syn.\u201d Said, \u201cI called you Excellency, and Excellency\nin Polish \u2014 in Czech, and sukin-syn sounds almost close together. I call you Excellency.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I know Polish and I know Czech, you call me sukin-syn. If you say that again,\nPll shoot you, you little so and so.\u201d Said, \u201cCommander, I did not say it, but I will not sa\u2014\never say it again if I did.\u201d I thought my goose was cooked, but it wasn\u2019t. So I stayed in\nbarrack, I peeled potatoes, I swept the barracks. I had a norm man, a man who wrote the\nnorms for the people, what people did during the day. I helped him do the norms. The\nclassification, how much soup at night everybody gets. And I learn how to cheat, how to\nwrite up \u2014 how to cheat so that people made more than they did. Anyway, I made it.",

        "A: Died hard \u2014 hard work. Mistreatment, beating occasionally. Some guards were vicious.\nSome guards were not as good as Ivan Ivanovich. I still say a prayer for him\noccasionally.",
        "A: For him. We did get out. We were allowed to go to southern part of Russia, where Poles\nare being collected and Polish army, to fight with the Soviets against the Germans, was\nformed. Some of us crossed into Iran. The Soviets had a hard time taking care of all of us.\nIran was run by the Russians and the British. We did sneak into the British part. The\nBritish trained us, armed us, fed us \u2014 formed Polish second corps under Polish General\nAnders.\u201d They went to fight in North Africa. In Egypt, North Africa, all way to Tripoli.\nLater on they went fighting in Italy, all way to Monte Cassino.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Son of a whore (Polish)\n** Son of a bitch (Russian)\n> Gen. Wladyslaw Anders",
        "A: My cousin \u2014 women and \u2014 and children were bundled up and sent to India and South\nAfrica. They build camps for them to stay for duration. After the war, they were all sent\nback to Europe.",
        "A: Mine was all right. I had enough to eat. I had a sideline. After about seven weeks there, I\nwas allowed to go out. There was a little settlement, winter settlement. They wer\u2014 they\nwere the Samoyed people. Siberian people like American Eskimos. Samoyed people\nraised reindeer and fished. So I went and wandered around and a young boy came and\ntalked to me, he said, \u201cWho you are?\u201d \u201cKto vy takoy?\u201d\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, I am Polish.\u201d\nAnd, \u201cChto eto takoy?\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cWhat is that?\u201d Said, \u201cWell, I am from a country way, way\nwest. Just like your Samoyed country, the damn Soviets took us over, they took you over\nand beat the bejesus out of us and sent us here to work in a camp.\u201d \u201cUh-huh. You\nhungry?\u201d \u201cOf course I\u2019m hungry.\u201d \u201cCome and eat.\u201d And Samoyed build, build \u2014 live-in\nyurtas. Yurta is a kind of a conical tent made of bearskins, double bearskin \u2014 four out and\nfour in. And it\u2019s kind of a good size, about the size of this living room here, about 12, 15\nfeet in diameter. But if you get into the yurta, if you \u2014 they use a \u2014 long handed hatchets,\nlike American Indian tomahawks. If you pick up the hatchet and put it like this and take\nyour hand off, the hatchet will stay there, the air is so thick. The Samoyed had people\nwash twice a year, if they have to or not. And they cook, they sleep, they make babies,\nthey do everything in the yurta. I mean the smell is overpowering. But they say, \u201cNever\nmind, pribyknyesh\u201d \u2014 you get used to it.\u201d So I ate a lot of fish and the young man said,\n\u201cYou come tomorrow?\u201d \u201cIf I can, I come tomorrow.\u201d So he gave me some fish, I took the\nfish to the camp. I shared some with the guards, I shared some with fellow prisoners.\nNext day I couldn\u2019t go, so third day I went and, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d \u201cStefan.\u201d \u201cWe call\nyou Stepka. Khorosho, kak Vas velichat\u2019?\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cHow do we call you?\u201d Velichat\u2019\u201d\u201d, it\nmeans, you use you name, your father\u2019s name. So I said my father was Jana. \u201cOkay,\nStepka Ivanovich, come on and eat.\u201d So we ate. \u201cYi\u2014 How much time do you have?\u201d\n\u201cOh, some time.\u201d \u201cWe'll go fishing.\u201d So we went fishing. So they gave me \u2014 gave me\nharpoon and we walked, on the River Lena. And I fell in. I didn\u2019t know what was what.\nRiver Lena is a very brisk river. The ice that time was probably 20 feet thick, but there\n\u00b0\u00b0 Who are you such? (Russian)\n*\u2019 What is that such? (Russian)\n*\u00ae You get accustomed (Russian)\n*\u201d Good, what are you called? (Russian)\n~\u2019 To be called by name (Russian)\nwere wash-outs, little bubbles. If you step on the bubble, you go in. I was lucky, I had the\nharpoon. So I fell only in \u2014 that way I got wet. It was not very cold, just about maybe 25\nbelow zero. So two of them grabbed me and ran back \u2014 ran to the \u2014 back to the yurta\nwhere I s \u2014I stripped. And he said, \u201cWell, I loan you my suit.\u201d His suit was made of\nsilver foxes. Big pants up to here and a big parka, with a big, huge hood \u2014 silver fox\noutfit, and reindeer. It was soft as silk. Because this man had three suits and he had three\nwives. Good Siberian women can make only one suit at a time. She has to chew the skin.\nSiberian wives has teeth just about three millimeters long, where they constantly chew\nthe skin. You \u2014 you tan it and then you invert it and you chew the inside of it to make it\nsoft, and becomes \u2014 either the chewing process or the saliva makes it as soft as silk. So I\nwore his suit. Went fishing again, we caught some sturgeon. They made a hole ina\nbubble, we got some sturgeon, we came back. We cooked some fish, we ate some fish.\nMy suit was still wet so he said, \u201cYou wear my suit.\u201d So I went. I was the best dressed\nprisoner in the whole damn Soviet system. I came, everybody\u2019s oh-ing and oo-ing and\nthe guards and especially the chachainsis.*' There were bunch of chachainsis.\nChachainsis is a bunch \u2014 a bunch of son of a guns. They are cutthroats, they are thieves,\nthey are murderers, everything. They kept looking. \u201cOh, too bad he 1s so small. Oh, too\nbad he is so small. We would take it off you.\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t take it off me.\u201d \u201cT\nwouldn\u2019t?\u201d I said that, \u201cWhat would you do to me?\u201d \u201cCut your head off, you stupid so\nand so.\u201d \u201cYou little so and so, you would cut my head off? We cut your head off.\u201d They\nfrequently would \u2014 if somebody wa-\u2014 had something they didn\u2019t\u2014 didn\u2019t want to give,\nthey would come and cut his head off at night and took whatever they wanted. Anyway,\nthey became my friends and protectors. I don\u2019t know why. I was just like a, like a little\nto\u2014 a flea, in comparison with them.",
        "A: Of co \u2014 oh I kept it for duration. Later on, that man said \u2014 well he was a chief\u2019s son, he\nhad three suits and three wives and 700 reindeer. So he said, \u201cWell, I got enough, two\nsuits, you can \u2014 Stepka, you\u2019re my brother, you wear my suit.\u201d So I wore his suit for the\nduration. And when I \u2014 I was ready to leave, I went to visit him and he said, \u201cWell,\nyou\u2019re going to stay with us \u2014 I mean all the time, stay with us. You can marry one my\nsister, you can marry two my sisters. You can marry three of my sisters if you want to.\nYou my brother, you stay with us.\u201d So when I went to say goodbye, I brought his suit\nback. I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have to leave. I want to go and fight for my country.\u201d So we\nhad a good cry and I went away.",
        "A: Was \u2014\n*! Chechens (Russian)",
        "A: Krugly.*\u201d That means the round one, Krugly. I could not pronounce his Samoyed name,\nbut he was Krugly, the round one. He was a tough, young Samoyed, with three wives. He\ndidn\u2019t have any children yet.",
        "A: I hoped so, I hoped so. Well, we\u2019re told by the political officer, by the politruk\u2019\u2019 in a\ncamp that, \u201cYou are going to join Polish forces, you are going to join our victorious Red\nArmy \u2014 are going to fight the damn Germans.\u201d\n[Technical conversation]\nEnd of Tape #3\n** Round (Russian)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Political instructor (Russian)\nTape #4\n[Technical conversation]",
        "A: Yes, we said goodbye and she was whisked away. In about \u2014 after we moved to the\nBritish zone there, we were together for about a week. And we \u2014 they collected all\nwomen and children and she went to India. Some went to South Africa, but she stayed in\nIndia for the duration of the war.",
        "A: Well, we just \u2014 actually, we just walked. And the Soviets stopped some groups. Some\ngroups were not even bothered with. Especially groups that had women and children and\nthey didn\u2019t want to bother with. We just walked and hoped for the best.",
        "A: Yeah, it was close to \u2014 1t were close to Teheran, it was west of Teheran. It was kind of a\ndesert area and there was some local people who traveled with herds of sheep and such,\nfrom place to place, so we would stay overnight with them. We just sleep outside, it was\n\u2014 you know, subtropics, it was warm and the \u2014 the British built camps already, so we\nwent to the camp that was built for the refugees, by the British. And of course, pretty\nsoon they started asking young men to come to lectures and come to training and, \u201cDo\nyou want to fight?\u201d \u201cOf course, what do you think? I\u2019m going \u2014 I came here for it.\u201d And\nmany people joined. And then I don\u2019t know if I want to divert. I think I will have to\ndivert back, before I \u2014 I left Siberia. About six months after we be \u2014 were there, they\nfished out 17 young boys, between 16 and 19. And I was one of them and we went\nthrough a heavy indoctrination course. Eight, 10, 12 weeks, eight hours a day. Heavy\nindoctrination course. And if you \u2014 if I get the three of you in a secluded place, that you\nare not allowed to leave, in about two weeks, you'll believe any \u2014 everything that I will\ntell you. They \u2014 there\u2019s nothing better than Communism. Dialectical materialism is the\nonly doctrine that works among peoples. Soviet Russia is the most powerful, most wise,\nmost \u2014 the best of all, the richest. We have the riches in Siberia that you never heard of.\nWe have enormous Ukrainian plains that we can \u2014 if we \u2014 planting our grain, we can s \u2014\nwe can feed the whole world. This is the best. You had to listen closely, you have to\nlisten attentively. If you smirked, if you made a face, if you make a funny remark, you\nwere thrown \u2014 your shoes were taken, your jacket was taken, you were thrown into\nsolitary, which was six \u2014 what \u2014 four by four feet. Your shoes were taken, too, overnight.\nYou had to dance, jump, run all night. If you sat down, you never waked up. Well, I was\nlucky, I spent only three nights. I couldn\u2019t keep my tongue. I mean I couldn\u2019t keep my\nmouth shut. I had to make remarks. I made faces, I laughed in his face, the politruk was a\nbig man, had a face that was asking for a brick, too. I just sm\u2014 laughed in his face. And I\ntold him once, \u201cHow little you know.\u201d So he was lenient with me, but still he, still he\nthrow me in, in the solitary, one night at a time. If you spent two nights, you didn\u2019t make\nit. Some people \u2014 there were a few people who made it for two nights. Three nights\nnobody made, in a row.\nAnyway, by the time we graduated, we had a talk, 45 minute talk. And if you missed two\nwords, you were thrown into solitary, had to repeat it. You had to give a lecture that told\neverything about the dialect \u2014 dialectical materialism. You knew all about Engels*\u2019, you\nknew all about Marx.\u00b0? You knew everything about Lenin.*\u00ae And you most about\nStalin.\u2019 I mean those were the holy \u2014 not a trinity, but a quadruplinity. And you had to\ntalk about them in glowing terms. Your tone of your voice had to be just like a great\n* Friedrich Engels\n\u00b0\u00b0 Karl Marx\n\u00b0\u00b0 Vladimir Ilich Lenin\n\u00b0\u2019 Joseph Stalin\nsermon on a mount. And you know, by the \u2014 by the end of it, I believed, strongly. I\nbecame a honest to goodness believer. So when we were later let go and I think it was\nsomewhat with premeditation that this little group was let go into the British part.\nBecause we going to be the avant-garde of Communism. We are going to get introduced\ninto armed forces or whatever groups there were and we\u2019re going to propagate it by\ngoing \u2014 we are going to be the true believers. And there \u2014 for some way or another, the\nBritish knew it. They collected us again. We went through a heavy indoctrination by the\nPolish political officers, by the British, who some spoke Polish, some worked with the\ntranslators. In about three weeks we lost the faith. We lost the true faith. And then they\nformed the armed forces. Yes, let\u2019s say they went to fight, they fought, fought all way to\nMonte Cassino. By Monte Cassino \u2014 when they took Monte Cassino, the second Polish\ncorps \u2014 after British and the Australians and the Americans couldn\u2019t take it, they were so\nbloodied, they were sent to recuperation\u2014",
        "A: It was 1941. 1941 summer\u2014",
        "A: Out of Teheran, last \u2014 late summer.",
        "A: ...and from Polish, we\u2019re getting training. So my 17 were re-indoctrinated, re-\nbrainwashed and trained in sabotage and demolition. The whole 17. They were bright ki\u2014\nI mean, of course we were bright kids. We got to brag about it a lot, I mean we used to\nbrag a lot about it. \u201cWe are the best of the best.\u201d Were trained in sabotage and demolition\nand the underground work. We were put in small groups. We went back to Poland.",
        "A: The training was in the morning, was calisthenics. There was a five mile run. There were\nfour hours of lectures, in \u2014 mostly about small arms training and the firefights. Mostly\nfirefights, being surrounded \u2014 being surrounded by a superior group and getting out.\nConstantly, constantly, constantly.",
        "A: How, how to fight your way out. How to fight your way out. Then in afternoon was\nanother lecture, which was a political lecture, whom we have to fight. Then of course,\nkind of a \u2014 the lecture would, would tell about how we do fight the Germans. \u201cBut, if you\nwant to, you can fight the damn Russians, too.\u201d And by nightfall, you fell sleepy, you fell\noff your feet, you slept. And the same and the same. And then sabotage, blowing up\nbridges, blowing up trains, blowing up buildings. Demolishing rail \u2014 train tracks, if you\ndid not have explosives. And a lot \u2014 a lot of training with semi and automatic weapons. It\nwas a time when the British introduced a sten gun and we trained a lot with the sten guns.\nWe trained little with regular rifles, but they said, \u201c\u201cWhen you get there, we will provide\nyou with sten guns, you will have a lot of firepower.\u201d And a sten gun is similar to\nAmerican Thompson submachine gun. But it\u2019s a piece of junk, actually. You shoot about\n1700 rounds and you throw it away, because after 1700 rounds, becomes more dangerous\nto you than to your pos\u2014 opponent. Anyway, seven of us went on a trip. We walked, we\nrode trains, we hitched up rides on the tracks. We rode donkeys most of the time. We\nwent through the western Iran, into northern Iraq. We went through the Kurdistan. By the\nway, the Kurdish people are the greatest people ever. They can cut your head off, if you\nhave \u2014 if you have something they like, but if you come in, it is so much like in \u2014 in\nPoland, \u201cGuest in, God in.\u201d They treat you like you were a god visit-visiting them. They\ngive you food. They give you \u2014 what they have, they share with you. If you are ragged,\nthey will give you shirt or pair of pants. But don\u2019t look at anything good they have,\nbecause they will give it to you. If you look at something, \u201cOh gee, this is so neat.\u201d They\nwill let you sleep with his \u2014 with his wife if you like her. But you get out of a tent, they\nwill follow you, cut your head off and take the stuff back. So we\u2019re told, \u201cBe careful with\nthe Kurds.\u201d\nAnyway, we walked through part of Turkey, we diverted into Syria and backed in\nAnatolia, Turkey, Anatolia. We did come to Bosporus Straits and we were kind of\npursued at that time, we knew something was happening. We were being hunted. So we\nmet a old fisherman on the Bosporus and he spoke Russian. He was an old Turk who\nspoke Russian. And said, \u201cGrandpa, please take us across.\u201d And he said, \u201cLords, night 1s\nfalling, there\u2019s going to be storm tonight, we cannot get a \u2014 go across.\u201d \u201cGrandpa, please\ntake us across, because we \u2014 if we don\u2019t leave here tonight, we may not be alive\ntomorrow. We know something is happening.\u201d The German had a Intelligence pe\u2014\nIntelligence people in Turkey and they organized pursuit parties, we overheard before\nthen. So he said, \u201cWell, Lords, I\u2019m old, my boat is leaky and if you want to risk, what am\nI to say?\u201d So we said, \u201cGrandpa, we\u2019ll pay you.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to be paid.\u201d So we said,\n\u201cGrandpa, we\u2019ll give you the donkeys.\u201d \u201cDonkeys, they\u2019re not worth anything. They are\nworn up completely.\u201d Said, \u201cGrandpa, you give them on a p \u2014 good grass, they\u2019 Il be as\ngood as new in two or three weeks. Leave them here.\u201d We got in the boat, he gave each a\n\u2014 each one of us a piece of rope. \u201cTie yourself ti\u2014 s \u2014 well.\u201d Storm came. It was the\nscariest five hours I lived in my life \u2014 scariest. I was in dark places, but this was the\nworst. I think I fell out about four times. If it wasn\u2019t for rope, I wouldn\u2019t be talking to you\ntonight. The Mediterranean fish would have eaten me up. Anyway, we did get to the\nTurkish side on the north side of \u2014 it was almost morning. Beautiful, quiet, sun was\ncoming up. And the old Ismael said, \u201cLords, the Allah was with you. I don\u2019t want to be\npaid.\u201d But before we left, the British gave us some gold pieces. \u201cCase you\u2019re in a tight\nspot, trading, whatever.\u201d So we said, \u201cGrandpa, we don\u2019t want to pay you, we just want\nto give you baksheesh, a gift from the heart.\u201d And each one of us gave him a gold piece.\nHe looked, said, \u201cOh my Allah. My granddaughter will get married, my younger\ndaughter will get married, my grandson get married, I can pay dowry to every one of\nthem and I\u2019m going to live high on the hog for the rest of my days.\u201d He got in his boat\nand a little breeze came, he just zoomed out of there.\nAnd we walked across a part of Turkey, went into Bulgaria, we caught rides on trains \u2014\ntracks, we head into Romania. We sneaked into Nazi occupied Poland. You know, the\nfront li\u2014 eastern front was way, way out. By that time, on Polish territory, the Germans\ndeveloped Einsatzgruppen,\u201d\u00ae special forces. They call them Einsatzgruppen or\nVernichtungsgruppen,\u201d\u2019 the exterminators. So they were killing lot of Jewish people and\nthey were killing all the Jewish people they could find. And they were killing a lot of\nPolish people. So the Polish underground suffered for a time. But then, when we came,\nthey provided us with arms and ammunition and some unstable Polish dynamite. And we\n\u2014 each one of us \u2014 I was given 17 people. Seventeen plus two, plus \u2014 plus me. That were\n20 people. And we became the exterminators of exterminators. We would create false\nalarms. Because when something happen in certain village or little town, they would just\nswoop upon it. They \u2014 those groups were about 100, 75 to 125 in each group. They\nwould swoop around, swoop in, surround it, burn it down, kill everybody. That was their\nstandard procedure. And when they went to a ghetto, they would just kill all the Jewish\npeople in the ghetto. Of course, ghettos were already fenced in \u2014 barbed wired in. So we\ndid few things with them and we blew up \u2014 we could not blow up \u2014 blow up complete\nbridge, but we blew up parts of a bridge. We demolished a lot of railroad tracks. We blew\nup some trains when we had explosives. And I was \u2014 oh, my gosh, my commander was a\n\u2014I still don\u2019t know his name. His name was, was \u201cB. Dab\u201d \u2014 \u201cB. the Old Oak.\u201d He said,\n\u201cYou little shit, \u2019m going to shoot you, I\u2019m going to court martial you, you missed it.\u201d I\nwould sit in a field with the two wires and a battery, holding here and I would touch it\nand the damn thing would not explode and the train would go by. Or sometime I would\nblow it up before the train came. So after each incident \u2014 mishap like this, he would gave\nme a dressing and threaten me with, with an execution and court martial and God knows\nwhat. He was a big, fat man with a very sharp temper.\n*\u00ae Task forces (German); mobile killing units, employed especially in the destruction of the\nJewish communities of Eastern Europe.\n*\u2019 Annihilation group (German)\nAnd we slept in bunks. We slept on farms that were far away from habitations. We had\ndugouts in half a dozen different forests. Run around constantly. We did get surrounded a\nlot of times. We had to fight \u2014 were in lot of firefights with those groups. Were\nsurrounded frequently by them and had to fight our way out. And about \u2014 in 1943, it was\n\u201842, fall and winter when we started. Forty-three, in late spring, we hijacked German\narmy bank on a street of Warsaw. We lost three people out of about 25 or 30 that were \u2014\nbut we got a lot of money. We got about 15 million marks. Each one was \u2014 one of us was\ngiven a bonus, and you were given operating expenses. I think we \u2014 my group got about\nhalf a million marks. And I had a drinking buddy, who was a young, German soldier,\nsupply officer. So we had drinks, we met few times. I introduced him to some Polish\ngirls. And we talked and he sold me about over 100 Schmeissers. Schmeisser 1s a light,\nautomatic weapon, similar to American Thompson submachine gun, but much, much\nmore effective. Much more effective. And I don\u2019t know how many, probably about 12,\n15 million rounds of ammunition. So from then on, my little group of 17 plus three were\ncarrying 27 Schmeissers, because some of the boys said, \u201cI don\u2019t trust that damn German\nweapon, I want to carry two.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, you know, we have a \u2014 we join \u2014 we\nshared those with some other groups, but we have plenty of it in places, hidden places. If\nyou want to carry 17 extra pounds, what am I to say? Go ahead, be my guest.\u201d The\nGerman groups \u2014 ordinarily each squad had one Schmeisser and the rest of them had\nmanual Mauser rifles. So when we \u2014 from then on, we \u2014 on purpose, did \u2014 when it cato\u2014\ncame to firefight, let ourselves be surrounded. And then when we opened up, we went\njust like a hot knife through a piece of butter. They had to keep their heads down, or they\nlost them. And anybody who stuck their head up did not get up again. So we went out\nand went out and went out and \u2014 course we were losing people. At the start we lost like\n11 people in two months. So the boys who were in my group said, \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWell, I tried to train you, you refused to be trained. You think you know\neverything. You were as full of beans, you want to fight, well do \u2014 surely we fight, but\nare going to lose people constantly if you don\u2019t want to train.\u201d So they said, \u201cDo anything\nthat \u2014 to train us.\u201d So we did. For about four weeks, we got the guts out of ourselves. We\ndid it the British way. The way the British Major Thompson did to us, we did to\nourselves. From then on we became almost invincible. We would lose a person from time\nto time, but very, very seldom.",
        "A: We drop back to countryside, we took a week or two off, then we \u2014 most of the time we\nfound the places we wanted to take care of ourselves. Sometime our commander would\ncontact us and gave us \u2014 gave us an order to do this or to do that. And there was a \u2014 one\nof the Eisengrupp \u2014 Eisens \u2014 Eis \u2014 Einsatzgruppen in neighborhood where my \u2014 not\nexactly my own family neighborhood, but close by. It was in a town called Biala\nPodlaska. It was about 100 kilometers east of Warsaw. There was the group that was\nlarge, it was very well entrenched. Very, very foxy, we just couldn\u2019t do anything to them.\nSo he called me the carpet and he said, \u201cYou are supposed to take care of that group. You\ndon\u2019t sa\u2014 you don\u2019t have to kill all of them, but really give them a good thrashing.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cCommander, I tried \u2014 we tried everything, I tried everything, nothing works.\u201d Said,\n\u201cYou have to do something.\u201d \u201cThey are entrenched. They stay in a solid building, which\nused to be monastery, with a great gate. They built a wall around, there\u2019s some barbed\nwire on the top of it. There\u2019s electricity in the barbed wire. We just can\u2019t touch them.\u201d So\nhe said, \u201cWell, we can, come on here.\u201d Led me to the next room, open a wardrobe and he\nsaid, \u201cLook at this. You see this nice, little Hitlerjugend\u201d\u00b0 uniform?\u201d And I said, \u201cOh, no\nyou don\u2019t.\u201d Said, \u201cOh yes, I do.\u201d And as you can see, I was a little blonde boy \u2014 little\nblonde boy, this one on the right. This one here, with blue eyes and very, very bleached,\nbleached hair. So he said, \u201cPut it on.\u201d So I put the thing, fitted me just right and a little \u2014\nlittle \u2014 little jacket, shorts, you know. High socks, hobnail boots, little dagger, little hat.\nSaid, \u201cThere, you look like a damn German Hitlerjugend.\u201d So I didn\u2019t have much choice.\nIn the afternoon, the boys brought me within about two or three blocks from that\nmonastery. I just walked toward the gates, there were two burly SS men with the\nSchmeissers standing by the gate. And I said, \u201cHeil Hitler, Heil Hitler.*! Wie geht\u2019s denn,\nJunge*\u201d\u201d \u201cGanz gut.*\u201d \u201cHow are you young man?\u201d \u201cVery well.\u201d \u201cWie geht\u2019s denn, Herr\nOberst.**\u201d How about you, Commander? \u201cGanz gut.\u201d So I said, \u201cI - Ich wiinschte mit ihre\nofficer gesprochen.\u201d\u201d\u201d I want to speak to your officer, your commander here. \u201cWeiter-\nweitermachen.*\u00b0\u201d \u201cGo right in.\u201d So I went in, I went through the corridors, I went up the\nsteps, I went to the back there and there was an outside window, I unlatched the window.\nI went downstairs again, I went to the back and I notice there\u2019s a gate there with a bolt, so\nI pulled the bolt slowly out. Then I went to the corr\u2014 second floor again \u2014 again had to go\nto second floor to go to the front, so I walked. There was some secretaries running out\nand some officers running back and forth. \u201cHeil Hitler, Heil Hitler, Junge.\u201d\u2019 Wie\ngeht\u2019s.\u201d>\u201d I walked out. Said, \u201cAuf wiedersehen,\u201d\u201d\u201d to those nice, two, big son of a so and\nso in the front. Walked out to the corner, walked beyond \u2014 about a block away, the boys\nare waiting with the car, they grabbed me, we ran away. I was so mad at myself. I wet my\n\u201d Hitler youth (German); Nazi youth organization.\n*! Hail Hitler (German)\n* How are you then, young man? (German)\n* Very good (German)\n\u201c How are you then, Mr. Colonel? (German)\n\u00a9 T wish to spoke [sic] with your officer. (German)\n*\u00b0 Continue (German)\n*\u201d Young man (German)\n*S How are you? (German)\n\u201d Good-bye (German)\npants. My pants were wet, my socks were wet, my shoes were squelching. I must have\nbeen afraid. And strange enough, I was in tougher places. I was being shot at, I was being\nhit, I was being mutilated, practically, but this must have been scary time that I had had.\nWas first and the last time that I wetted my pants. That night we came in and the\ncommander came with us. B. Dab came with us. He said, \u201cYou know where everything\nis, SO you go in.\u201d So I went with my big rucksack. And then we came with a ladder, we\u2019re\ngoing to climb to that window there.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: Yes, lucky enough, they did not board the back door. But we came with big oil cans and\nwe Oiled all the hinges, you know, and \u2014 and my commander said, \u201cWell, you know\nwhere everything is, you will go in.\u201d Said, \u201cMe? Was supposed to be somebody else\ngoing in.\u201d \u201cOh, shut up and go in.\u201d So I went in, I set sev\u2014 set up 17 charges, one for\neach boy in the outfit and we blew the place sky high. It just blew up. There was a\narmory, and I notice where it was, I put a charge on the door to the armory. Whatever\nthey had there \u2014 it must have been a lot of explosives \u2014 blew up. And of course, some of\nthem were running out of the front gate and the back gate and we met them in the street,\ntoo. And I don\u2019t know how many were left, but there were some left, I presume. And of\ncourse, then we took off and \u2014 and got the hell out of there. That was a feather in my hat.",
        "A: We just went out for \u2014 far away from it, as far as we could from the neighborhood.\nSometime we had horses, sometime we had horse-wagons. Occasionally we would have a\ntruck, produce truck that we \u201cborrowed\u201d from the Germans. Well, we would just stop a\ndriver and take him away and appropriate the truck. Take his uniform and one of us\nwould dress in it and we would have it ready after a job like this. And actually, this thing,\nstrange enough, did not have many repercussions. \u201cThe armory blew up. There\u2019s \u2014\nsomething happen, the armory blew up.\u201d The German papers were saying, \u201cthe armory\nblew up and some of our people were hurt.\u201d",
        "A: They did not want to acknowledge, apparently. So then we had a week of rest. My\ncommander said, \u201cNow you deserve a rest.\u201d And I said, \u201cAre you going to gift me with\nthat Hitlerjugend uniform?\u201d \u201cOh no, that is useful \u2014 that will be for somebody else. You\npissed it, you so and so.\u201d I said, \u201cListen Dab, I was scared.\u201d \u201cWell, I think you were\nscared, but you should have been scared before hand, not when you were right there.\u201d",
        "A: Occasionally, I would visit my family, but very seldom. But most of the time I would\nstay in the forest and enjoy it and bring some good food and have a drinking party. And\noccasionally we\u2019d have a drinking party with the Mongol people. Wanted \u2014wanted to\ndemolish a track, or a trail, demolish a train. And the Germans had the Mongolians, from\nouter Mongolia, who volunteered to serve the Germans. They placed them along the\nrailroad tracks to guard it. So, when we wanted to blow up a train, we just go for about\ntwo or three kilometers and collect bunch of those people and invite them to a party.\nCourse they had to come if they wanted or not. They didn\u2019t want to get shot. So we\nwould provide a few gallons of moonshine and some smoked meat and a lot of bread,\nwe'd have a party with them, get them roaring drunk and then we would wait for the \u2014 we\nknew when the train that \u2014 in question was coming in there, with armament or with a\ngroup of soldiers going to the eastern front. And we would try to blow it up. Sometimes\nsucceeded, sometime not. After we \u2014 after not, my commander would call on me and\nsaid, \u201cYou little so and so, what\u2019s the matter with you? Losing your touch?\u201d I said, \u201cYes,\nsir, 1am losing my touch.\u201d \u201cLet that not happen again.\u201d \u201cYes sir, 1t will never happen\nagain.\u201d If it happened next time, he said, \u201cYou forgot you said never again.\u201d \u201cWell\u201d, said,\n\u201cwell, I thought I \u2014 maybe I would be dead before next time.\u201d",

Occasionally \u2014 later \u2014 later on, after we\nappropriated a lot of German uniforms, those that were not very bloody, we would \u2014 we\nwould wear. Matter of fact, we had them tailored, beautiful tailored. We had a Jewish\ntailor, Mr. \u2014 Mr. Grzebien, who could make a beautiful fitting outfit, regardless what it\nwas.

And then, after we felt that we were too unnerved, we would st\u2014 we would take a\nfew days rest. Occa-occasionally some of us would go for a short visit, but very seldom\nbecause Germans had also quite good Intelligence. And they had a lot of local people\nwho were reporting to them. So you had to be careful where you go, when you go. Like,\nfor instance, I don\u2019t know if I was that religious, but frequently on Sunday I would sneak\ninto the church, to my pastor. And he was friend of mine, I read all his books. I read all\nthe books in the public library and school library and I discovered he had a big library, so\nI read all of his books and I served Mass. Oh my God, I served Mass forever, I was 19\nand 20, I still served Mass. So he would say, \u201cOh Stefan, come on, serve the Mass.\u201d\n\u2018Father, I can\u2019t. I messed up last night, I blew up a train. There were people on that train\n\u2014,\u201d or else I did something. \u201cCome on, I\u2019Il listen to your confe\u2014 I'll hear your confession.\nCome on, serve the Mass.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m too old.\u201d \u201cOh, you\u2019re so little, nobody will know.\u201d\nSo he gave me key to the wardrobe, he kept, \u201cPut your \u2014 put your items in a ke\u2014\u201d I put \u2014\nput my trench coat and my Schmeisser and a bunch of boxes of my magazines of\nammunition in his wardrobe, lock it up, serve the Mass. And then he said, \u201cOkay, now\nyou can go.\u201d So before he walked out, I would go into sacristy, unlock, jump out of a\nwindow and disappear. He was a good old man.",
        "A: Yeah, Ksiadz\u201d\u2019 Miazga.",
        "A: My parish priest, Ksiadz Miazga. He was older. He was patriotic. And I would tell him\nthat I really can\u2019t serve Mass, nor can I go to communion \u2014 what I did. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep\nnights, my conscience bothers me, cause some of the people that we exterminated were\nnot really willingly going there.\u201d Said, \u201cEverybody who is Ein\u2014 in Einsatzgruppe went\nwillingly. And if you did kill some soldiers on the train, some officers, this is a war.\u201d\nAnyways, I still occasionally spend sleepless night. So, it lasted \u2014 1t was good when it\nlasted. And then in spring, early spring of 1944, I was caught in a lapanka. Lapanka is a\nround-up, like they caught slaves in Africa, like they go hunting and have a \u2014 surround\nmeters and hunters. In Poland, the lapanka was an institution. The group of German\nSchutzpolizei\u00b0' would stop a train or a bus, mostly train, get everybody out, fish out all\n\u00bb\u00b0 Priest (Polish)\n>!

It was called the \u201cfree labor.\u201d So I left what I was carrying \u2014 I was carrying a\nsuitcase of dynamite and some wiring, so I left it on the train. It was \u2014 I was a little boy,\ncaught on a train traveling between Warsaw and \u2014 and whatever.\nAnd of course I was sent to western part \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, eastern part of Germany, Silesia.\nThen there was almost like a \u2014 like a slave market. They took us to that Kreuzburg town,\nsmall town like a county town, Kreuzburg. We were kept \u2014 put in a \u2014 1n a building next to\na square \u2014 there we be walked out to the square and then farmers and people from\ndifferent little factories, shops and so on, would come. \u201cI\u2019ll take this one, I\u2019ll take that\none, I\u2019ll take that one.\u201d \u201cOkay. Here\u2019s your ai\u2014,\u201d they filled out an arbeitbuch,\u201d a little\nwork book for you \u2014 your name and your employers name and you went and you were\nservant to that person. If you got to be on a farm, it wasn\u2019t too bad, because you had\nenough to eat. A group of us \u2014 the group of us, about 25 boys and 23 girls, between like\n13 and 19 or so, were put in a village called Schorka and we worked in a forest, natching\nout the trees, pine trees and collecting the resin. Resin was used by German industry for\nmaking synthetic rubber. So we worked there about eight hours a day, worked in a group\nwith a supervisor. And sometime the Stadtpolizei?\u2019 worked with us, they try and they did\nnot. So, some of us would be escaping now and then, of course, they would be\napprehended and brought back and so on and so forth. And I worked there for, oh,\nprobably three or four weeks. So a small group of us took off and went away. So, \u201cI\nwould \u2014 won\u2019t work for the damn Germans here. Let us go home.\u201d And the home was a\ngeneral government the center of Poland, which was so called \u201cFree Poland,\u201d it was\nunder \u2014 it was a protectorate, Hans Frank was the gover-governor and it was run by the\nGermans, for the Germans, by the Germans and the Poles who were there had to give\neverything that they produced, they raised on the farm and so on, to the German war\neffort. But you were kind of semi-free. Anyway, those of us who were in the underground\nwere free because we could go anyplace we want to.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I w \u2014 just walked away. Partway home, close to town called Lubliniec and\ncloser to little town called Blachownia, we split \u2014 we got chased by some\nVolksdeutsche\u2122 people with shotguns.

Are you \u2014 do you know anything about wet works?\u201d \u201cOh, a\nlittle.\u201d \u201cWell, you know, there is a Gestapo man who is such a son of a bitch, he mistreats\npeople, he beats people, he shot some people, he killed some people during interrogation.\nAnd we want to do something willa\u2014 with him, but we are not \u2014 we got the sentence,\ndeath sentence for him from the \u2014 our underground authorities, the NSZ.\u201d The National \u2014\nNSZ, which was the National Armed Forces.

So we ask him to excuse himself and we excuse the lady and we walk him a\nshort distance, we read him the sentence. And of course after we left, he \u2014 he was dead.\nAnd I should have known better, I should have gotten the hell out of there, but I stayed\nfor a few more days and there was somebody who reported. And they came and I was so\nwell trained and I became sloppy. I was too lucky for too long. I survived too long. I\nbecame sloppy and careless and my goose was cooked. I stayed with a family in a\nBlachownia \u2014 Blachstadt(ph) in German. And it was kind of a storage room in a\nbackyard, I stayed there. And they came at about one a.m. We had a shootout. Two of\nthose two who first came in, one was dead and one was badly wounded. And they shot\nacross and they killed another one of their own. And I jumped out of a window, I thought\nI would \u2014 I was free to get out. And then I got hit from behind. I don\u2019t know what\nhappened after that. When I was up to \u2014 I had a few broken ribs. I was badly kicked and\nmutilated, practically trampled into the soil in that little garden there.

        "A: German, yeah. Gestapo officer came from Warsaw. He was Ph.D. from Heidelberg\nUniversity. He was highly educated person. And he joined the Nazi party, of course. He\ndidn\u2019t know any better. And he became special investigator for the Gestapo. He\nintroduced himself and when he came in, the people who led him in, they said, \u201cWhere\nyou from?\u201d So he told them. And said, \u201cYou know, wir hat die schlange, wir hat die\nschlange.\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cWe have the snake.\u201d Because where I came from, they call me the\nschlange\u201d\u2019 \u2014 the schlange, yeah the Germans. Because I lived forever and lasted foreve-\nforever, so they called me the snake. \u201cWir hat die schlange.\u201d We talked for five days and\nfor five nights. He would not let me sleep. He would go and take a nap now and then,\nsomebody else talked to me. After five 24 hour talks, he said, \u201cYou know, I think we\nbecame friends and I th\u2014 and I thought you were going to tell me everything that you\nknow. Really, \u2019'm your friend. I don\u2019t want to hurt you, I want to do anything. But you\ndidn\u2019t tell me a damn thing. So we\u2019ll try something else.\u201d And I was just out of my \u2014\ncompletely out of myself. I was sleepy, I was hungry, I was thirsty. So the first thing he\ndid \u2014 he would \u2014 they would give me a little water now and then, but I don\u2019t think I ate\nanything for those five days and five nights. So then the first thing he did, he brought a\nbig dish of ice water and gave me a big spoon. He said, \u201cSit and eat. If you don\u2019t finish it\noff, \u2019'm going to shoot you right here.\u201d The most horrible thing in you life can be eating\nice water with a spoon. What \u2014 it was probably a gallon and a half, maybe two gallons. If\nyou try sometime, this is almost like a Chinese torture, maybe even worse. I ate the whole\ndarn thing. And I was just getting out of my mind. So he would not let me go to the\nbathroom, so I just sat in a chair and made a big puddle on the floor, several times.\nAnd then he called two men \u2014 two big, strong men and they gave me hell for about two\nhours. I was in and out several times. I didn\u2019t know what was happening to me. Then\nthey would pour a pile of water on me, I would come back to it and they gave me \u2014 and\nbeat me again. So then he asked questions and I apparently didn\u2019t tell him very much, so\nhe said, \u201cOkay, take him in a swing.\u201d So they took my clothes off, they tied my hands on\nand \u2014 my hands like this, put a broomstick here, put it on the top of the stools and I was\nswinging back and forth. And one of them was swinging hose, rubber hose, hitting my\nbehind. \u201cAnd talk and tell me this and tell me that. Well, you know about si\u2014 something\nabout this?\u201d So I was prepared, I told him blue streak. I told him \u2014 oh, I told him tall\nstories. All the people, all the names, who were dead. So then he left me \u2014 left me alone\nand he went and checked and he came back. He said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me a thing.\u201d So\nthey gave me beating again and beating again and beating again. And then he said, \u201cWell,\nthat\u2019s enough, we are ready.\u201d So I had a \u2014 and normally, I mean, they just took out \u2014 they\nshoot you. They shoot everybody in the neighborhood and this case, they wanted to be so\nlegalistic, they wanted to be so exact, that I had a case in court. I had a defense attorney,\n~\u201d We has [sic] the snake (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Snake (German)\nMr. Heinrich Schmidt. Yeah, Heinrich Schmidt. And he was telling \u2014 he was talk to the\ncourt \u2014 it was the Volksgericht.\u00b0' People who did not have any training in law, appointed\nby the German authorities to deal punishment sentences. So, my attorney was asking for\nthree death sentences. And the \u2014 I don\u2019t remember \u2014 or did \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I ever knew\nthe name of the judge. He said, \u201cTwo, enough. Zwei ganz genug. Zwei ganz genug.\u00b0\u201d So\nhe gave me two death sentences. And then he stamped \u201cN and N\u201d on my document. \u201cN\nand N\u201d is, is \u201cNacht und Nebel.\u00ae\u201d \u201cNight and fog.\u201d\nA person who got a sentence \u2014 who even did not get a sentence, but had an N and N on\nhis documents, he was sent to concentration camp, he was finished off \u2014 taken to the gas\nchamber or given an injection \u2014 phenol injection. Or went to the bunker to starve to\ndeath, or got mutilated or got hung in a \u2014 in a camp square. His documents were\ndestroyed. His ashes were \u2014 his family was not notified to send seven marks for the\nashes. You disappeared just like in a night and fog. So I was the Nacht und Nebel baby. I\nstayed in prison, in Lubliniec for two, three weeks. I healed. I could sleep on my back.\nWhen I got there, I could sleep only on my stomach. There were 17 of us in a two person\ncell. We slept like sardines 1n a can on the floor. And the one who was the latest, had to\nsleep next to kiibel. And kiibel was a garbage pail that everybody emptied themselves.\nSo I slept next to the ktbel for about a week. And of course I advanced, later on. But\nafter about two or three nights, they looked at me, at my back and they said, \u201cWell,\nmaybe you should move little here.

        "A: Yes, I did. I prayed a lot. And I \u2014 actually I never prayed for anything. I prayed \u2014 I still\nhave a ta\u2014 hard time praying for anything. Like for instance, presently I pray in\nthanksgiving that I\u2019m still alive, can take nourishment, I can run a mile, I can skate, I can\ndo some skiing. And I\u2019m 75 and counting. So I never prayed for something, not even for\nrelease, not even for a longer life. I knew I wouldn\u2019t live to be 20. I was sure I would\nnever live to be, to, to, to be ninet\u2014 19 and a half or 20. I was \u2014 by that time I was almost\n19. I never \u2014 I knew I was not going to live. But I prayed and I was so thankful that I was\nstill alive. Anyway, after the sentence, I stayed there in a prison for a short time, then I\nwent on a transport to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, which is in western Poland\npresently. At that time it was in eastern East Germany, close to Opole, German Oppeln. I\nwas there in transit, in the block number 12, which was a subterranean block. It was a\ntime \u2014 it was just a time when Polish Prince Radziwill\u201d was sent to Gross-Rosen. The\nGermans wanted him to from Polish government under German auspices and he refused.\nSo they sent him to concentration camp. He was a brother-in-law of Mrs. Kennedy.\nKennedy\u2019s \u2014 Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s sister married one of the \u2014 his \u2014 that Polish Prince\nRadziwill, who was in Great Britain then. Anyway, Prince Radziwill came with a servant.\nAnd after they were told that sup \u2014 they took him \u2014 the ser\u2014 took the servant away. They\ngave a black number, black triangle and sent him to the stone quarry. And the person who\nreceived black triangle was \u2014 went to sa\u2014 to stone quarry, was not to survive. So his Kapo\ntold him, \u201cPrince, I\u2019m going to kill you, over the next week or two, so if you want to\njump, go ahead.\u201d So he jumped.",

        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have to witness, but I spoke to one people who had a black number and was\nin the quarry. He came and by that time I developed a friendship with a Blockiltester,\u201d\u00b0\nwho was a Polish young boy, who was killing people right and left, to survive. Killing\nprisoners right and left, to survive. When I first came, we got into that barrack, we were\nput three people to the bunk and a bunk was about two and a half foot wide. Three people\nto a bunk and bunks were three piles high. So I went in the corner between the bunk and I\nstood against the wall, because my back, my seat, my \u2014 was kind of awful. And the\nBlockaltester was a young Warsaw boy who became a killer to survive. He came and he\nsaid, \u201cWhat do you think you are doing, you stupid so and so?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I am\nresting.\u201d \u201cGet in the bunk.\u201d I said, \u201cBlockaltester, I cannot get in a bunk.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d\nSo, I turned around and lifted my clothes. \u201cUh-huh. Come on.\u201d So normally, when you\nsaid, \u2018come on\u2019, you were going to get 25 with a ax handle or \u2014 or a \u2014 or a rubber\ntruncheon. So he led me to his little room and he said, \u201cTake your clothes and lay down.\u201d\nSo \u2014 \u201cThis is my bunk, lay down.\u201d So I lay down and he brought a \u2014 a towel, he brought\na pail of water. He washed my back. He had some kind of an ointment that he put on me.\nAnd he said, \u201cYou cannot turn, can you?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I cannot turn.\u201d \u201cOkay, you can\nsleep on my stomach. I can go and get my \u2014 see my girlfriend.\u201d So he went. Before\nmorning he came back and said, \u201cNow you can go back there and be one of the prisoners.\nAnd don\u2019t let me catch you again standing there. Go to bed. Cause if you don\u2019t, PI kill\nyou.\u201d",
        "A: Yes, he did. There were some people who were in position, occasionally they would give\nyou \u2014 do you a favor. But don\u2019t ever ask them for a second favor, because that was the\nend of you. I met many people like that later \u2014 later on in Mauthausen. Anyway, I stayed\nthere for a short duration and just about the same time, a bishop from my archdiocese \u2014 I\ncan\u2019t ever remember his name, from Siedlce, came. He lasted only four days. They put\nhim into Strafkommando.\u00b0\u2019 People who were carrying big loads of stone with a\nwheelbarrow.

        "A: I\u2019m sorry\u201d?",
        "A: No, we stayed in the barrack. We were a kind of a zugang\u201d\u201d\u2019 people \u2014 new prisoners in\ntransit. So about \u2014 I can\u2019t even remember how many it was \u2014 eight or nine days, we put \u2014\nwere put on a transport and went, and went, and went all the way to Mauthausen. Came\nto Mauthausen, got shaved, got disinfected, went to the showers, were given a pair of\nclodhoppers, wooden shoes and a prison uniform and went to a barrack. Barracks zwei\nund zwanzig\u2019\u2019 \u2014 the first quarantine. There was a main camp and a first quarantine. First\nquarantine they had barracks 21, 22, 23. After that there was a wall, there was 24 and 25,\nbut those were the bunker barracks, where people went, never to get out. Anyway,\nbarrack 22 was the barrack of the people with \u201cN and N.\u201d So we went to a little chamber\nwhere they gave shots, phenol, derivative of gasoline. It is the most horrible death you\ncan ever have. You die for about 45 minutes. That courses through your veins, gets into\nyour heart several times, and you just die in a horrible torment. Just the worse thing ever.\nI saw dead people who died that way. They looked like the gargoyles on Notre-Dame\nCathedral. Or they went on a transport, or went to Gusen Zwei,\u2019' never to come out. Or\nthey went to gas chamber, or they went on special transport behind the front line. If\nsomething happened behind the front line, in a town or village, they would hang 10, 15,\n20 local hostages and let them hang there for \u2014 sometime for weeks. If they did not have\nlocal people, they would bring people from concentration camp and execute them there.\nBut for some strange reason, after a very short time, I was whisked out, my number was\nread, I was put by the gate with 500 people. We marched again to the train depot, which\nwas about like three, four kilometers, through the little town of Mauthausen. Put on a\ntrain and went to Vienna. And put in a concentration camp which was a sub-camp of\nMauthausen, 11\" Bezirk\u201d kolo Wiednia.\u201d And we\u2019re put to work in an armament\nfactory. It was an Ostermann-Sauer Werke, which built tractors and cars. It was a Swiss-\nAustrian-American company, built cars and trucks.

I was turning openings and grinding the huge blocks for the big, big heavy motor\nfor the \u2014 was a horrible work, it was 12 hours a day. The food was bad. Most of what we\nwere supposed to get, the people who handled it stole and ate and gorged themselves on.\nIt wasn\u2019t too bad, actually. When I think back, it wasn\u2019t too bad. I got beaten a few times\nby the SS men, but it wasn\u2019t too bad.",
        "A: Well, I think it\u2019s \u2014 you \u2014 you looked wrong way, he came and slugged you. And one time\n\u2014 oh, my gosh, I never forget that. There was a little SS man, my size \u2014 big, fat thing. He\nwas just kind of a, a roly-poly thing and he walked with a rifle. The rifle was three times\nas big as he is. And we walked the factory in a fives \u2014 you know, row \u2014 I mean fives \u2014 in\nkind of marching. And I look and I said, \u201cLook at that little son of a bitch. He is my size\nand he is so damn fat. If he falls over, he is going to roll forever.\u201d\u2019 And he understood\nPolish. And he got after me. And the boys hid me and we were just in the gate, so I ran\nquickly into the factory and got to my machine. And he was walking back and forth and\nwatching and walking, looking for me. And every time he walked, I would duck behind\nthe machine. I had a young Russian boy working with me, I would duck behind the\nmachine. And he never found me. He would have probably finished me.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t escape that. Many times my mouth ran away from me.",
        "A: It was a chore for the authorities. I stayed there from \u2014 oh my gosh, from October,\nNovember, until the second part of January, I think. I think so \u2014 does it say so?",
        "A: Yes. Because \u2014 because every...\n[Technical conversation]",
        "A: Yes, the situation was such, they had a \u2014 I was a, I was a bloody headache for them.\nBecause every four weeks, two big, burly SS people would bundle me up, take me on the\ntrain, we would go to Mauthausen, 120 kilometers in the train and I would be taken out to\nthe Politische Abteilung\u2019, Gestapo office outside of camp. I would be asked some\nquestions and I would get the treatment that I couldn\u2019t sit for next two weeks, and back to\nwork. Every four weeks, every four weeks.",
        "A: Interrogate my case. The reason why they didn\u2019t finish me off was because, \u201c\u201cYou\u2019re case\n\u2014Du kleine Schlange,\u201d\u00b0 your, your case is not yet finished. Your case is not yet finished,\nso we have to ask you a few more questions.\u201d",
        "A: \u201cWell, what happened then? Did you blow the train? How many people in your group?\nGive me their names. Who was your commander? What are the other groups around?\nWhat did you go this place? When you go that place? How come \u2014 how come at one\ntime, you were by Smolensk? How come at one time you were by Minsk \u2014 the Soviet\nMinsk? Can you explain? Can you tell?\u201d",
        "A: Well, I made the tall stories, I talk blue streak. I tried not to repeat myself, I tried not to\nchange what I told before. As I said, I do \u2014 I did have a good memory. I could memorize\npages and pages of \u2014 I could memorize the 45 minutes of a propaganda talk. I didn\u2019t miss\na word the second time. Anyway, and they would let me go. \u201cWell, that\u2019s enough for\nnow. We\u2019ll see you in four weeks.\u201d So the authorities in Vienna apparently got sick and\ntired of it, so for a time, they put me on a bomb squad. There were fifee\u2014 50 people and\nafter Americans started bombing Vienna \u2014 they came first in All Saint\u2019s Day, in 1944 and\nbombed the bejesus out of Vienna. They say there about 1200 American super fortress\ncame. You couldn\u2019t see sun, you couldn\u2019t see anything for three days \u2014 fires. And they\nkept burning \u2014 Bezirk, district, 21, 22 and 23. All those three days. And finally they hit \u2014\nthere was a Tiergarten,\u2019\u00b0 there was a park there and under the park there were enormous\ntanks \u2014 buried tanks of aviation gasoline. And they finally \u2014 the third night they hit, and\nthe thing was boiling horribly. Because my factory lost all the roof too and we worked,\nyou know, January \u2014 worked practically outside. We danced, we jumped. We tried to put\ncardboard in our jackets. If you got caught with a cardboard, you were beaten severely,\nsometimes shot.

We will try something else.\u201d So then something else, when I came back\nto Mauthausen, the first two days \u2014 I was on block 22 again. Block where people got \u2014\nwho were not supposed to leave. And two days later I was called in and there said, \u201cWell,\nwe'll try something else.\u201d So they made me take my shoes off and I\u2014 leaned me on a\nchair and beat my heels. And this is the most horrible feeling. When they hit your heel, it\nfeels like your brain wants to jump out. And \u2014 it was part of it \u2014 one of the stupid,\nuntrained henchmen hit my foot and broke a m \u2014 broke my \u2014 my \u2014 some bones in my\nfeet. Now I am a walking barometer. If \u2014 if the rain is coming tomorrow, I know there is\ngoing to be rain, because my foot bothers me. My heels were just like balloons. So I\ntalked to some prisoners there, they said, \u201cWe just yell a lot.\u201d So, as from then on,\nwhenever they took me there, before they hit me, I would scream bloody murder. I would\nyell, I would swear up and down. I would talk in Russian, I would talk in Polish. So they\nbrought Russian and Polish interpreter, thinking that I was going to spill something. I\nwould just talk blue streak. And I knew little Samoyed language, I would talk some\nSamoyed, cause then they would \u2014 later I\u2019m sitting down, \u201cWhat did you say then?

Effektenkammer was that big warehouse with the best,\nbeautiful thing, that came with people who went directly to gas, were stored. Beautiful\nsuit, beautiful boots, silk underwear and so on. So we got dressed like a \u2014 dressed well. I\ngot silken underwear, I had beautiful socks. I had beautiful Hungarian boots. Woolen\nsuit, tie \u2014 silk tie, fur hat, fur coat. They would put us by the gate and the prisoners were\ncome in and said, \u201cMan, look at the bunch of Jewish barons.

So he gave me a bundle of jewelry. He said, \u201cIf you go on a trip, maybe you can\nbuy your way out.\u201d And he gave me a Polish marine knife. So I tucked it in. We\u2019re\nstanding there and pretty soon, SS squad came and we hiked to that depot, about three\nkilometers to the train and they put us in a prison compartments \u2014 went on a trip. And on\nthe train, there was one SS man who was coming back and forth \u2014 coming back and forth,\nlooking. And he came to a window, I, \u201cHerr, Herr Ober\u2014 Ober\u2014 Herr Oberst, can you tell\nme where we are going?\u201d And he looked, he said, \u201cWhat is u \u2014 what is worth to you?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cTwo carats?\u201d \u201cGanz gut.

They filled your mouth with a\n\u2014 with gypsum, so you couldn\u2019t yell, took you out and hanged you in a marketplace. So\nthat was it. Said, \u201cOh gosh, now I got to watch. I have that knife, I have all the jewelry.\u201d\nNothing do it \u2014 doing. Went to Vienna, they backed up prison van to the train and two\npeople with truncheons and two people with machine guns \u2014 into, into it, they drove into\n\u2014 us to the Elizabethpromenade \u2014 huge prison, put us in a cell. Next morning, likewise.\nPut us in a train. We went through Budejovice, we went as far as Brno in\nCzechoslovakia. They put us in old Franciscan monastery that was made into prison.

Bunch of Czech, pretty Czech\ngirls. They send me a paper, they send me a piece of candy and we talk blue streak all\nnight. And the next night and the next night and those people who are with me, those\nprisoners who are with me said, \u201cMy gosh\u201d \u2014 those were Bibelforscher*\u2019 people, those\nwere Baptist people.

There were tables ready, the registering\ntables.

        "A: Oh, of course, yes. And it was a time when I \u2014 when I met Victor Frankl. You heard of\nVictor Frankl? He was a Jew from Vienna. He just died about a year ago, he was in his\nupper 90\u2019s. He was a great man, he was a psychoanalyst. If you ever see a little book\ncalled my \u2014 Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, it was translated into English, many of his books\nwere translated, he was a psychoanalyst. And he \u2014 when he came to Mauthausen, I don\u2019t\nknow if \u2014 1f he came from Auschwitz or elsewhere, he was just on his last leg. He lost his\nspoon, he lost his dish and with those two, you were dead. But he had a big bundle of\npapers. And we met, he somehow plopped next to me and \u2014 and he said, \u201cNu, who are\nyou?\u201d \u201cOh, I am Polish.\u201d \u201cOh, I am Jew from Vienna. And what do you do in your life?\u201d\nI said, \u201cI did nothing, I was a student and I was doing some little work after that \u2014 before\nthe Germans caught me. What did you do?\u201d \u201cWell, I was a doctor and I\u2019m a doctor of\npsychology.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhere\u2019s your spoon?\u201d \u201cOh, I lost it.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s your dish?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I lost it.\u201d I said, \u201cMan, you dead, because you won\u2019t get your soup, you won\u2019t get\nanything to eat with.\u201d And if you try to catch some \u2014 some servers would give it into your\nhat, but most of them wouldn\u2019t. They would just take you aside and kill you. Anyway,\nfound him soup spoon and found him dish and we became friends. And he was great. For\nnext few days we just talked and every time we felt bad, 1t was just \u2014 end was coming,\nyou know, people are being taken to gas chamber and places. He\u2019s a \u2014 he said, \u201cOh, sit\ndown here, let\u2019s talk.\u201d So we talk blue streak and we got cheered up. He developed a\u2014a\nspecial kind of psychotherapy call \u2014 called logotherapy. And he\u2019s went talking on \u2014 on \u2014\ntalking tours through United States many times. One time he came in 1970\u2019s, late 70\u2019s\nand we couldn\u2019t get together, but I phoned him at Coffman Union at the University here\nand he called me back at work and then he talk \u2014 we \u2014 he phoned at night and we talked\nfor about three hours, from about 12 until 3:30. Said, \u201cWell, I got to go, my train is \u2014 my\nplane is leaving shortly.\u201d So we said, \u201cAuf wiedersehen\u201d and then \u2014 anyway, he\nsurvived, but when \u2014 I never thought he would make it, but he did. He stayed in\nMauthausen to the very \u2014 time of liberation. But, my case, again, I was fished out after a\nfew \u2014 in a few days after the great crowds came and I was transported to Gusen Zwei,\nwhich was a walking distance. Gusen Eins ~ was about two mi- two kilometers, Gusen\nZwei was about five kilometers, so we walked. There were about 5,000 of us walked that\nday. We were gather at the nightfall. We were \u2014 our clothes was taken, only belt and\nshoes were left on us. Our clothes was taken to be disinfected. We went to showers,\nwhich were cold at that time. We were put outside and we stayed until about four a.m. I\nwas still quite nimble and quite healthy. I got in the middle of a group. My head kind of\nfroze, but at morning we found about 500 people who were dead, out of 5,000. This is\nonly 10 percent.\n*\u201d Gusen I",

You\nbecome kind of a frozen stick. And Gusen Zwei was the worst camp you ever heard of.\nNormally, it had 50,000 prisoners and by the end of a week would be 45,000. Every week\n5,000 prisoners came, sometime 10,000. And it never went above 50. Never went about\n40. In a week would be 40. About \u2014 attrition ration was about 20 percent a week. Was a\nhorrible work, we worked digging tunnels under mountain. The tunnels were buil\u2014 dug\nespecially to put armament industries in them. They already built tanks. They built\nMesserschmitt \u2014 Messerschmitt planes. And I think they built also rocket planes that they\nused \u2014 I mean, the Vau-Eins,\u201d> Vau-Eins, Vau-Zwei,\u201d to bomb England. But I\u2019m not sure\nof that. But I knew they built Messerschmitts. But I was on a crew that was digging the\ntunnel, digging with a \u2014 straight ahead of you, in a kind of a softish stone, with a air drill.\nAnd a person as strong as he is, or he is, could stand about four days. After four days you\nbroke down. Well, I stood it for about seven days and I was given a shovel to shovel\nbecause I couldn\u2019t lift 1t any more. And I had a Yugoslavian friend \u2014 Janko \u2014 Janko, I\ncan\u2019t remember his last name. He lasted 27 days drilling. The drill weighed probably 35 -\n40, maybe 50 pounds, straight into the wall, drilling. Then he dropped dead. Just dropped\nthe drill and dropped. By the time we turn him over, he was dead. Yeah, he was a \u2014\nYugoslavians and especially Albanian. Albanian people are the tough son of a guns.\nAlbanian man can swear for 15 minutes and never repeat himself.

At noon, you got a half a gallon\nof soup that had practically nothing in it and a small slice of bread.

        "A: I was lucky. I had a Russian friend who was a thief. He can steal anything out of\nanyplace.

So he shared his cigarettes with me. Cigarette were the high, hard\ncurrency. For one-fourth of a cigarette, you got portion of bread. For one-eighth of a\ncigarette, you got a dish of soup. So when I had an access to something, I shared with\nhim. To make it short, I had a SS man who didn\u2019t like me, who beat me frequently. He\nwas a beautiful, young, tall, blonde beast and he had a German Shepherd, young German\nShepherd with him. So one time, I got the sh\u2014- German Shepherd in a dark tunnel and of\ncourse I dispose of him, I skinned him. I had him baked in a ba\u2014 in the smithy, because I\nthat time was \u2014 I was a \u2014 a Laufer, \u2019 I was a runner. I was running with the drills to the\nsmithy and back, you know, carrying them back and forth to be sharpened and to be\nbrought back. So I gave the smith one-fourth of a dog, he baked it for me. Then I shared\nanother quarter with the people who worked with me and a half of the dog, I brought to\nthe camp and that three or four of us lived high on the dog for about a week and a half.\nOh, that was an enormous shot in the arm.

        "A: We had a gas chamber, but I \u2014 no, there was a gas chamber in Gusen One, but not Gusen\nZwei. But the mortality ratio was so enormous that \u2014 that nothing else was necessary. Of\ncourse the Kapos killed their portion of people every day. We went to camp, I mean went\nto work \u2014 on the way home we carried five, six, 10 - 15 - 20 people out of a hundred.\nCarried them because they were killed at the job. Some dropped dead but most of them\n\u201d\u00bb Crook from Rostov (Russian)\n*\u00b0 | walked in pockets (Russian)\n*7 Runner (German)\nwere killed by the Kapo. Kapo would get a cigarette for every person he killed. If he\nwere a heavy smoker, he killed a lot of people. Also, there was a Krankenhaus, there was\na hospital and if you went to Krankenhaus, never came back, of course \u2014 but some people\ndid. So from time to time, they would have a \u2014 a Krankenhaus had to be disinfected. So\nthey would take the people from a Krankenhaus and make them walk across the railroad\ntracks to another barrack that was empty, kind of a temporary Krankenhaus and keep\nthem there, and there would be a line of Kapos lined up on each side of the group\nwalking. Anybody who would walk, they ran a gauntlet. They had ax handles on \u2014 or two\nby fours, and anybody who did not run, was killed. So I remember once in the first of\nFebruary, 1945, they killed that night, 400 sick people out of 700, about 300 only made\nit, could run. The rest were killed. I had a friend at that time, he was a Polish\nmountaineer. He was a tough son of a \u2014 he was just wiry, he was strong. He was\neverything. Anyway, he got sick or he \u2014 maybe he malinger.

He went to hospital, couple nights later comes a Kapo from a hospital and say \u2014\ncalls my number, so I answer him, and said, \u201cYou have a friend in the hospital.\u201d \u201cYes, I\nhave a friend in the hospital.\u201d \u201cHis \u2014 his name is Janko the Goral,\u201d* \u201cJohn \u2014 little Johnny,\nthe mountaineer.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthat window, so he wants you to come and\nsee him at that window.\u201d So at night I sneaked in \u2014 that was not allowed. To get out of a\nbarrack, going get killed. So I went and I knocked the window, he opened it up and, \u201cOh,\nStefan, come tomorrow and bring me a big jug of water. I\u2019m so thirsty, there\u2019s not\nenough water here. Here.\u201d So he gave me a little bundle. I came back, there were about\nseven portions of bread. It was a fortune. Eating an extra portion a day, keep you alive\nand up your spirit for at least a week, maybe 14 days. So I brought him some water next\nday and I said, \u201cJanko, where did you get all that bread?\u201d \u201cWell, you know, those damn\nMuselmans \u2019.\u201d Muselmans was a name for people who were on their last foot. You\nknow, they just lay there, they can\u2019t eat, they hold their bread. So when the\nFliegeralarm'\u2019\u2019 comes, you know, night, when the lights are out and planes are flying \u2014\nlights are all \u2014 all the lights are off, he just went from bed to bed and swiped the bread\nand lived high on the hog.\nAnd I said, \u201cJanko, but this is un-Christian.\u201d \u201cThey are going to die anyway. I\u2019m not\ngoing to \u2014I\u2014I\u2019m not killing them, but they can\u2019t eat.

And Janko came back, got out of a ba\u2014 of a hospital, came back to the barrack\nand he was given three days of convalescence. He was staying in the barrack, did not\nhave to go to work. And the Kapo, day Kapo in the barrack, ask him to do something and\nJanko said, \u201cYou so and so, get away from me.

And we lined up, you know laid down, it was 10 - 20 - 50\npeople a day who were dying. So I went. Yes, Janko was still there, laying, his head\nbashed in. So I did have his address. I wrote to his family after the war and his sister\nanswered and she said, \u201cWell, my mother feels so bad because Janko was taken because\nhe argued with her, so he volunteered and went to work in Germany and he got himself\ncharge with sabotage and sent to concentration camp. And please tell me, did he have a\nnice casket? How was he buried, did he have a priest?\u201d Janko, with probably 500 others,\nnext day, was dumped into big wagon, that about 50 prisoners pushed and pulled. They\njust had big sides and their wheels were just like the Conestoga wagons in America there,\nbut bigger. And they pushed and pulled to the first Gusen Eins, where the crematortum\nwas.

And he was \u2014 he was just like a\ntiny, little bird. He was so skinny, he was so miserable. He just looked like a \u2014 like a \u2014\nlike will of a wisp. And Mr. Bujywid wanted greatly \u2014 to help him. So when he \u2014\nexecution time came, Mr. Bujwid went to the \u2014 camp secretary went to Gestapo office\nand begged for him, one day. So they postpone it. And the next day \u2014 next day he came\nhis face was bitten up and swollen. He came \u2014",
        "A: Our secretary. He went next day again and again he had welts on his back and his face\nwas beaten some more. So the fourth day, a list came \u2014 Laufer came running. Laufer was\nthe runner, you know, as I \u2014 pretty young boys were runners, Laufers. They ran between\nthe camps and delivered messages. So Laufer came with a list and \u2014 and said, \u201cMr.\nBujwid,\u201d I mean, \u201cHerr Bujwid.'\u201d\u2019 Exekution eintreten, Exekution eintreten.'\u201d\u2019 Roll up\nwith execution.\u201d So Mr. Buywid came to barrack and read the list and I was sure I was\ngoing to be on the list and the little boy was on the list. And he walked out into the front\n'? Mr. Bujwid\n'? Fall in for execution (German)\nand they got lined up and the Blockaltester, Max, the German criminal who was the block\nleader, led them out.... And it was so, so funny, Mr. Bujwid talked with that little Henry.\nOh, they talk blue streak. \u201cBecause we both are from the holy Zmudz.\u201d Because the little\nboy was from the same territory that Mr. Buywid was. They say, \u201cWe\u2019re holy people, we\nbelieve in God, we hate the damn Communists. We hate those Germans even more\nbecause they\u2019re ungodly creatures. And we are going to survive for ever and ever and\never.\u201d And the last day, before Henry went to be killed, he said, \u201cMr. Bujwid, thank\nyou.\u201d Yeah, he, he knew what was coming.\nAnyway, that was still in Mauthausen and that was I wa\u2014 then I wa\u2014 on our way in \u2014\nGusen Zwei and of course, it \u2014 I heard it later on, but it was a good story. A Swedish Red\nCross person, whose name nobody ever found, came to speak to the commander, General\nPohl,'** P-o-h-I. And he came to talk to him and General Pohl was complaining, he said,\n\u201cSee here,\u201d was a telegram or was a letter. \u201cI have an befehl'\u00b0 here,\u201d I have an order, \u201cto\nlead all these people I have left here, about 42,000, into the tunnel. The ends of the\ntunnels are already mined to be dynamited and those people will suffocate there, within\nin probably one, two hours.\u201d He said, \u201cIf it was only telephone order, I probably could\nescape not doing it, but is a befehl, it\u2019s a telegram, I had to sign for it. What I am going to\ndo?\u201d He was not \u2014 he was not a very bad person, that man was. Matter of fact, he had a\ncase in court later on and some of us testified for him. Anyway, when this man left his\noffice, the document disappeared. The man \u2014 and the general was diverted somewhat \u2014\nthe man swiped it. He borrowed a bicycle from a German guard, then he borrowed a\nhorse. And the American front line was just beyond Linz. It was probably 30 - 35 - 40\nmiles. He went across the whole front line on a horse, then \u2014 he in tie and suit. Why the\nGerman Ges-\u2014 SS didn\u2019t kill him, I don\u2019t have an idea. Did he talked to somebody, I don\u2019t\nhave an idea. Did he identify himself, I don\u2019t have an idea. He got across, he got as far as\nGeneral Patton'\u201d\u00b0 headquarters. And nobody wanted to talk to him, so he bothered\neverybody there and eventually somebody did talk to him. So he mentioned that, he\ndescribed it. So they said, \u201cOkay, come on in, come on in.\u201d They let him talk to assistant\nto Patton. And then Patton came and asked a few questions. And Patton sent five\nAmerican tanks. They broke across the front line, they went and went and went. They\ncame to Gusen Zwei, they took few potshots at the guard towers. The SS people\nsurrendered. They left tank, I think about five soldiers, to guard those 800 SS, who are\nherded into \u2014 into \u2014 into a big kind of a barn. And the rest of us, who were just barely\nmoving, because we haven\u2019t gotten anything to eat about four days and my case, I was\nflat on my back. I couldn\u2019t even turn over. Then the four tanks went to Mauthausen, five\nmore miles and sur\u2014 and get around, too few \u2014 took few potshots at the guard towers.\n'* The interviewee later corrected this name to Max Pausch, Kommandant of Gusen II.\n'\u00b0\u00b0 Order (German)\n'\u00b06 Gen.

        "A: They told us there was no food. \u201cWe cannot give you anything because there isn\u2019t any.\u201d\nWell, it turned out, that the warehouses were full of bread and the bread was \u2014 after we\nfound it after a few days after liberation, it was all moldy by then. There was probably\ntwo, three, four, five tons of bread. They just probably tried to starve us to death. And\nmany did. Many did. We had an enormous ditch dug out between the Gusen Eins and\nGusen Zwei by American bulldozers, army bulldozers. Just an enormous ditch. And they\ntook all the Germans from the countryside, with horses and carts and wheelbarrows and\nall and they came and picked up all the people, washed up everybody and laid them\nevenly, not just dumped them, but laid them evenly in a \u2014 in that grave. There are about\n18,000 people buried there. And those were the dead for last four or five days, when the\ncrematorium did not work.",

        "A: Well, they expected \u2014 they, they all knew the front was nearby, but they expect it to be\nstill fighting there for quite sometime, but this \u2014 they just broke through. They said, \u201cOh\nmy God, the armies are coming. \u201cAmerikaner, Amerikaner \u2014 run!\u201d And the SS of course,\njust surrendered and the Commander Ziereis'\u201d\u2019 was a horrible man \u2014 of Mauthausen. He\nwas \u2014 people testified and \u2014 against him and he was hanged, later on. But General Pohl of\nMau-\u2014 of Gusen Zwei, was exonerated.",
        "A: It was kind of a bedlam \u2014 it was a bedlam and it was a\u2014 Americans really came, you\nknow \u2014 really came. It was about two days later that the front moved, Americans came.\nThey just came in, walking around. Taking lot of pictures and they came to my \u2014 to my\nbarrack and they looked up and \u2014 and one of them spoke German, \u201cKommen Sie da,\n'\"\u2019 Franz Ziereis\nkommen Sie da.'\u2019*\u201d And I said, \u201cI can\u2019t move.

I was \u2014 I was shitty and \u2014 and stinking, and all that and\nthey covered me up with a German army overcoat. Took me to Gusen Eins and there was\na little hospital made there and were given little milk \u2014 milk with \u2014 mixed with water and\nkind of a gruel, that you give to babies, for a few days. Eventually, we started eating\nfood. And people who were in \u2014 who got hold of a solid food, like American were tossing\ncans of Spam \u2014 and Spam was the heavenly food. Oh my God. Spam was it. I still can\nclose my eyes and I can taste that beautiful American Spam. So somebody would eat it,\nwould not share it with somebody else and he would die, immediately, on the spot. Could\nnot \u2014 could not take it.",
        "A: Well, there were so many of us, they were just flabbergasted. They kept us there and they\ntook us some, on \u2014 in trucks, to hospital in Bamberg, which was couple hundred miles\nwest, into West Germany. And I was in a Stadtischer Hospital,''\u00ae the state hospital for\nabout four, five, six months there. I had \u2014 well, I was down to 72 pounds, had a \u2014 I had a\nbad case of tuberculosis. And my lungs were collecting liquid, especially my left lung. So\nI got shots. I got shots, it was the 10 cubic centimeters lime \u2014 lime shots. Know lime, like\nthe \u2014 used for building? Calcium \u2014 calcium shots. Calcium shots. And when you get the\nshot, you get hot from your tip of your toe \u2014 fingers to tippy toes and to your head, you\njust get pleasantly hot. And that was supposed to sh\u2014 to dry up that liquid in your lungs.\nAnd after a few weeks, when a nurse was coming with a needle, my veins went south.\nShe would jab and jab and jab and she could not find a vein. She said, \u201cJust don\u2019t look\nwhen I come. I don\u2019t want you to see, because your veins disappear.\u201d My both arms were\njust like \u2014 like I was a heavy addict to God knows what. But it didn\u2019t dry it. It didn\u2019t dry,\nthey had to make a puncture in the back and pump it out. And they couldn\u2019t put me\nunder, because I would never wake up. So two big men, just like those two, big clunks\nheld me and the doctor went back and he made \u2014 punctured my back and he pumped, oh\nprobably gallon and a half of horrible liquid. And he said \u2014 the doctor said, \u201cWell, if\nyou\u2019re lucky, this is it. If you\u2019re not lucky, you have to pump it every six months for the\nrest of your days. Of course, if are still unlucky, you die of TB, well, you\u2019ll be dead.\u201d I\nwas lucky. I didn\u2019t die of TB and I did not have to ever have it pumped again, except that\nI have two big stones on the bottom of my lungs, because the calcium goes all the\norganism and collects in your lungs and settles on the bottom. Occasionally when I have\n'\u00b08 Come there [sic] (German)\n' Yes, we help you, we help you. (German)\n'!\u00ae Municipal hospital (German)\ncold, when I cough, little grainy stuff, I do cough out. Doesn\u2019t bother me any. Except I go\nto x-ray. When I first came to x-ray, he says, the doctor \u2014 technician looked, call the\ndoctor and doctor said, \u201c\u201cWhat is that?\u201d And I said, \u201c\u201cWhat is what?\u201d \u201cWhat is that on\nbottom of your lungs?\u201d I said, \u201cCalcium.\u201d \u201cCalctum? How come calcium?\u201d Said, \u201cWell, I\nwas given about 310 cubic centimeters as injections of calctum to dry up my wet\npleurisy, they called it, Pleuritism Exudative''\u2019 in Latin \u2014 my wet pleurisy.\u201d \u201cOh, they\ndid that?\u201d \u201cYes, they did that.\u201d \u201cDid it dry out?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d",

When we went to work, there was a train going\nover the viaduct and you saw the German people standing in the windows and smiling,\nyou know.

        "A: They are from different part of the country, they\u2019re no relation, most likely. Stefan\nWojtyla joined the Communist party, he was sent for training to Soviet Russia, he came\nback in 1949 or 1950. He joined Polish army. He became a law officer. He became, last\ntime \u2014 he used to write to me, say \u201cStefan, come back. Your were shedding blood, you\nwere fighting. You will get your rewards here.\u201d So we wrote back and forth and I\ndiscovered that Stefan Wojtyla arrested at least dozen of my people and at least eight\nwere put against the wall and shot without trial. In 1973, he became a persecutor general\nof the Polish armed forces and was the last time he wrote to me, because I wrote him that,\n\u201cYou dirty, damn Communist. Why did you have to do that?\u201d So he wrote back, \u201cI\nhaven\u2019t done anything, I helped a lot of people, I helped a lot of people.\u201d And I wrote\nhim, \u201cDo you want a feather in your hat? You want me to come back and you put me\nagainst the wall?\u201d So he wrote, \u201cI would never do that to you, you were my friend\nalways, you always will be my friend. But I am becoming the prosecutor general of the\nPolish armed forces and I cannot write you to \u2014 to you any more. But I promise you that\n\u2014 your folder, that is about three inches thick, is going to disappear when I get my\nposition. Nobody\u2019s going to see it again.\u201d And my sisters, when they came \u2014 they came\nhere, said, \u201cYes, he came for a visit, many times,\u201d and the times were hard in Poland, so\nsh\u2014 they said that he brought always some very exquisite food. He always brought a\nbottle of champagne and \u2014 with a lunch with him and he said, \u201cI never will forget what\nyou did for me.\u201d He said, \u201cWhen I was a kid, and we were dirt poor, when Stefan and I\nwere going to school in the morning, I would sneaked into your house early and your\nmother always would give me a good breakfast with Stefan. And then we walked our\nthree kilometers to school.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019Il never forget that. And you can write Stefan that\nI would never hurt him.\u201d Anyway, when I go back, I will spit \u2014",
        "A: Well, probably not. I should be Christian and forgive him. But I can not forget. Just like\nthat \u2014 there\u2019s a little German saying that says, \u201cOrte und Zeiten der Schrecken die wir\nniemals vergessen werden.''\u201d\u201d \u201cThe times and places of horror, we should never forget.\u201d\nEspecially this day and age. You know, you talk to young people \u2014 I spoke to about 110\nyoung people in a middle school about two weeks ago. And they had a course on\nHolocaust, they wanted to know what was going on. They don\u2019t know who Hitler was.\nThey heard little of Stalin, they don\u2019t remember who Roosevelt was. They learn little\n'!? The places and times of terror should never be forgotten. (German)\nabout the Holocaust. They were living \u2014 reading Elie Wiesel, the book \u2014 little book,\nNight. They were just about few pages gone and they wanted to ask many questions and I\ntold them little story. So I frequently go and talk to group \u2014 various groups of people,\nwillingly, and few of us that are still alive should not forget. And it seems like your\npeople with the museum there and whatever information you impart to people must have\nsome influence, because a lot of schools, even grade schools, have a special course every\nyear on the Holocaust. And as far as I know, almost all the middle schools here,\nespecially the religious schools, Catholic and Lutheran schools, do have it too.",
        "A: Well, I\u2014I\u2014I could not go.",
        "A: Because those people are \u2014 my sisters wrote me in 1955, I think and said, \u201cWell, we\nwould like to see you, but if you come, you may end in a piaskowo.'\u201d\u201d\u201d Piaskowo is a\ncemetery \u2014 1s a sandy hill. Said, \u201cBecause many people like you are being taken out.\u201d I\nhad two little relatives, they were two girls my age. They were actually my nieces but I \u2014\nthey were my age. In 1947, they were arrested, they were mistreated, they were sent to\njai\u2014 to prison for 10, 15, 20 years. They were exonerated in 1960, released and they even\nwere allowed to live in Warsaw, which was a great privilege. They\u2019re both dead. They\ndidn\u2019t survive very long.",
        "A: My father survived. My \u2014 my mother was dead by then. My mother was a war, war\ncasualty. She had a baby and all doctors were arrested and sent to concentration camps.\nShe had a very child \u2014 difficult childbirth and she died in childbirth at 41.",
        "A: Yes. But those two girls in question, they were couriers for our underground. They\ncarried mostly explosives on the train. They\u2019d have two huge suitcases of explosives, get\non the train, they spoke little German. They\u2019re pretty young girls. Well, frequently they\nwould get into a German car \u2014 a bunch of German soldiers, officers had a special car, so\nthey\u2019re, \u201cMadchen, madchen, kommen Sie hier.'*!\u201d So they would came with the big\nsuitcase that the German would pick up the suitcase, put it up on the upper. Because there\nwere controls frequently, they would stop a train and search and contraband like food, the\n'\u00b0 Sandy hill (Polish); colloquially \u201ccemetary.\u201d\n'*! Girls, girls, come here! (German)\nso-called black market, which was a free market, people training would be stole \u2014 taken\naway from people. So if you are pretty girl and you carry that, Germans invited you, took\nyour bundle there and nobody could come and search you. And they would come to\nWarsaw and said, \u201cauf wiedersehen\u201d and \u201cdanke schon\u201d and went blissfully their own\nway with four big suitcases, carrying enough stuff to blow up four \u2014 four or five trains.\nBut the Communists got them. They said, \u201cBut we helped you.\u201d \u201cWell, helpers like you\nwe don\u2019t need any more.\u201d Just like with my four boys. \u201cHelpers like you we don\u2019t need\nany more.\u201d\nAnd mainly, we were helpers in one aspect. In 1943, in summer, a Communist young\nman, slightly older than I, came and talk \u2014 talked. He said, \u201cStefan, we need to blow up\nsomething and I know that you can do it.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re a dirty Communist. I wouldn\u2019t\nbend my finger to do anything for you.\u201d \u201cBut you know, you really got to help us. You\nreally got to help us.\u201d So I talked to my commander and my commander said, \u201cOh, you\nstupid so and so. Go help them? If you go and lose your behind, it will serve you well\nbecause you lost your head already.\u201d But he reconsidered. Few days later he came and\nsaid, \u201cYes, you can go and help them. I talked \u2014 we talked.\u201d So they provided me with\ntwo \u2014 well, they gave me two of my boys and myself and a load of explosives. And\nprovided us with a German chauffeur. German chauffeur who was carrying a truckload of\narm \u2014 war material to a certain spot. And we\u2019re going to that spot. It was kind of an army\nfilled depot. There were a lot of explosives there and then tanks and aircraft bombs and\nGod knows what else. So he left us out in the forest. He went and delivered the stuff and\nthen came back and he was going to wait for us in the forest. And I was told, \u201cYou send\none boy, if he doesn\u2019t make it, send a second one. Don\u2019t go yourself, because if you go,\nyou get court martialed when you get back.\u201d So one of my boys went in, he went under\nthe first wire and had a little shovel, dug out. Then he went to a second wire and a dog\ngot him. And the guards, the SS guards came in and shot him. And well, he didn\u2019t suffer\nbecause they shot what he had with him and he just gro\u2014 got blown up to smithereens. So\nthen I said, \u201cWell, your turn.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going.\u201d I said, \u201cBut you have to, you\nswore.\u201d \u201cYou can shoot me, I\u2019m not going. I\u2019m not going to help those son of a bitches\nagainst those son of a bitches.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t have much choice, do we? I\nhave to shoot you.\u201d \u201cWell, go ahead and shoot me. You\u2019re my friend. I would rather be \u2014\nbe shot by a friend than \u2014 then relative.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to try, but\nbe sure when we come back, don\u2019t you ever tell.\u201d Said, \u201cDll save my life, I won\u2019t tell.\u201d\nSo I went \u2014 I went to the first place, I went to a second place, there was still stuff around.\nIt was muddy also, but was quite muddy from the person who blew up. And a dog came\nand for quite sometime \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I had \u2014 it\u2019s like I had affinity with dogs.\nActually when we walked \u2014 my group walked to the village and I was with them, not a\nsingle dog would bark. And a bunch of dogs would fo\u2014 I would go \u2014 walk behind and a\nbunch of dogs would follow me and squeal \u2014 wanted to be petted. So the dog came and\nhe squealed and I petted him and he raised his \u2014 his \u2014 his leg and sprayed me from head\nto toe. I was so mad at that dog. I said, \u201cIf that was elsewhere, I would show you what 1s\nwhat.\u201d And the guards came by and the dog followed them and I was right at their feet\nthere. They never looked. So I scrambled in \u2014 I walked in. I had \u2014 I always ruled by 17, I\nhad \u2014 my lucky 17. So I went for my 17 charges, put them here and there. Then I got out\nthe same way, I watched the guards when they just passed. I got from \u2014 was a kind of a\nhalf truck standing nearby, got from behind it. Scrambled under one wire and a second\nwire and ran like hell. Got to my boy, grabbed him and we both ran like hell. We got to\nthe forest. Probably was a good kilometer, was like three-fourths of a mile. He started the\ntruck, we drove. We drove like hell for about 10 - 15 minutes and it blew up. The first\nexplosion blew up all the windows in the truck, back and front. And then it blew and it\nblew and it blew and it blew. It was just like an atomic f \u2014bomb fireworks. They were\npreparing pa \u2014 putsch on Moscow and the Russians \u2014 and the Russian under \u2014 Soviet\nunderground wanted badly to demolish this. So that\u2019s why my boys, after the war were\ninvited to the big party. \u201cYou did for us, you did for us, but now we don\u2019t need you any\nmore. Also, people like you we don\u2019t need here. Out you go.\u201d And they asked about me\nand they said, \u201cThe Germans got him, probably killed him.\u201d",
        "A: Well, yes. I think we \u2014 I thought we did them, did them a favor. I was sorry to have done\nit, but was fun to blow up that thing. Oh my God, it was just like a \u2014 like a Easter\nMonday \u2014 like Easter Sunday. You should see those explosions, sky high, flying in every\ndirection. Oh, it was a blow out. I was practically intoxicated watching it. But we were\nrepaid and my friend Stefan Wojtyla mentioned it. He said, \u201cThey would never do\nanything to you.\u201d So later on I wrote to somebody, \u201cAsk Stefan what happened to my\nfour boys.\u201d Later on he said, talked to some, \u201cIt was an aberration.\u201d Anyway, he went to\nhis rewards. I don\u2019t know, maybe he \u2014 maybe he became a good Christian and 1s happy in\nparadise, playing the lyre. But I kind of suspect that the good Lucifer is poking him with\na fork now, la-bas.!\u201d\u201d",
        "A: Yes, when I \u2014 when I recei\u2014 became better, I was in a \u2014 a Hohenfels, then I was in Lohr,\nwhich was not really \u2014 it was like a hospital, it was called sanatorium. Then I became\nbetter and I went \u2014 was sent to Aschaffenburg, Jager Kaserne,'~\u2019 a displaced person\ncamp. And I kind of convalesced there for a short while. Then I work in the kitchen for a\n'*? There (French)\n'* Barrack (German)\ntime and I became an accountant in the kitchen. Well, the Jager Kaserne was disbanded,\nwe went to a da \u2014 different Kaserne, closer to Aschaffenburg, within a city, stay there for\na time. Then I worked as a courier there, for a time, between those three camps. There\nwas Ukrainian camp and two Polish camps. Then we were se \u2014 to \u2014 moved again to a\ncamp, Wildflecken, which 1s close to Schweinfurt in Bavaria. It was enormous German\narmy camp. I think it was the ski troops that were trained there. Enormous, there were\nprobably 15 - 20,000 refugees there. By that time I was \u2014 for a time I was stenographer\nfor the police force and then became a detective and worked there for the duration as a\ndetective until I left in 1949 for America.",
        "A: Local crimes, there were some murders, there were some rapes, there were some so\ncalled sui\u2014 faked up suicides \u2014 murders that looked like suicides. There were malpractice,\nmedical malpractice. I had one medical malpractice where a lady went to have a appendix\ntaken and the doctor forgot to tie one blood vessel and she bled to death, into her\nabdomen. And some interesting cases. Shoot \u2014 shoot-outs with gangs occasion, but very\nseldom.",
        "A: Well, there were Polish gangs that went \u2014 black market operators mostly. Well, if for\ninstance, we\u2019d go to a farm and they would need a cow, they put boots on a cow legs and\nlead the cow to the camp and lead the cow to the fourth floor to the attic and slaughter it\nand have a lot of meat to sell. It was all kind of shenanigans going on. And from time to\ntime I would make a document for somebody. See, people who escaped from across \u2014\nfrom there \u2014 behind Iron Curtain, some want \u2014 some had a hard time documenting\nthemselves. So when I felt that somebody was not guilty of anything and worthy, more or\nless, I would \u2014 I was specialist in sacram\u2014 sac\u2014 document forging. When I was still in\nPolish underground, I went through a crash course and worked for sometime in the so\ncalled \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201d Kind of got to \u2014 little vacation from my group. From a\nfighting group. So I could make documents. I can make you a document. I can make a\nstamp. I can forge your signature or your signature and your signature, if I \u2014 if I want to \u2014\nif I practice long enough.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I\u2019m still alive, I think. Of course, holy providence had something to do with\nit, but most of the time I avoided getting killed. I got beaten \u2014 I, I got almost finished off\none time, when I worked in a tunnel. I had a Kapo who was a Czech, he hated Poles and\nhe hated me specially. \u201cYou shitty little Polack.\u201d He would beat me up and do things to\nme. So, one time I was working up \u2014 up there and he was passing by and I took the\nrailroad tie and I put \u2014 put it down on him. Got him hit quite badly. Anyway, I was very\nsympathetic when I later on saw him. \u201cOh, Gabriel you get hurt? Oh, you poor thing,\nwhat happened to you?\u201d He said, \u201cSome son of a bitch tossed a railroad tie on me.\u201d\nAnyway poor Gabriel got so bad that he lost his Kapo job and he got the shits and if you\ngot those, you got loose stomach in a camp, you are done. So, I even went and burned my\nportion of bread for two days and fed it to him. Cause if you got very loose stomach,\nwhich was a killing thing, three days you are done \u2014 if you had enough bread and charred\nit and ate it, it would stop it. So I fed the poor Gabriel with my own bread and every time\nI turn around, I felt like spitting in my face, helping that old son of a gun. I mean he was\nold, he was 31, but he was old in comparison, I mean he was. And I don\u2019t even know if\nhe survived or not because I was transferred to a different barrack and he stayed in the\nsame barrack. I don\u2019t know if he made it or not. That old Gabriel, Angel Gabriel, he was\nnot. I still got a little scar, he one time chopped me with a \u2014 with a shovel, just swung the\nshovel and cut me right over my forehead.\nEnd of Tape #9\nTape #10\n[Technical conversation]",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I felt sorry for that \u2014 for that old, shitty son of a gun. I kind of forgot what\nhe had been before and didn\u2019t really dwell upon it. Things happen and you go. And\nordinarily we did help one another. We did help one another. It was kind of a dog eat dog\nat times, when some people tried to get to the top and become a top dog, they had to kill\nand steal and do the horrible things. But there was cases people did help one another. I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I felt compassion or if I were just \u2014 saw him so miserable, I said,\n\u201cOkay, you dog, eat that bread. Maybe \u2014 maybe your loose stomach will stop.\u201d",
        "A: He was still grumbling. He didn\u2019t call me names any more. Because I wa- by that time I\nwas stronger. And he lost his job. He lost his job. He was not a lord almighty any more.\nHe could kill all 25 people he had, in one day, if he wanted to. He would get 20 \u2014 a pack\nof cigarettes for it. He did beat many people, I don \u2014 never saw him kill anybody, but he\ncould if he wanted to. So maybe he wasn\u2019t very bad. But angel Gabriel, he was not.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they made me any better. Maybe they made me a little more understanding.\nBut they did not deflate my ego. And I still talk a blue streak. Well, they made me \u2014\nsurviving it made me very thankful, as I previously said. I never prayer \u2014 had \u2014 pray a\nprayer of petition. I always say a small prayer of thanksgiving. So it made me appreciate\nlife and the presently, I mean, I wake up every morning and I feel so free. And I\u2019m not\nhungry and I\u2019m not cold. And I have a darn good job. I love books and I work with\nbooks. I buy a lot of books, I\u2019 Il sell a few books. Ill read. I work five and a half days in\nthe bookstore. Every second Monday, you go to public library, we get our 10 or 15\nbooks, so we have something to read. Sylvia reads too, a lot.",
        "A: My wife, Sylvia reads a lot, too. And every Thursday Sylvia comes downtown on a bus\nand we have lunch and we talk blue streak. Because normally, after supper \u2014 when she\nhas supper ready when I come from work. I come on a bus and I walk a mile. We eat\nsupper, I wash the dishes and we sit with our noses in a book. So, to preserve domestic\ntranquillity, we get together once a wook \u2014 once a week and we have a lunch out. Just\nlike one person said, I think it was a good saying, \u201cMy family \u2014 family ate out a lot, but\nthey always went to the cheap places.\u201d That\u2019s it.",
        "A: And I\u2019m free.",
        "A: I can \u2014 I can\u2019t remember it. Occasionally \u2014 well mainly, what \u2014 I remember it in the \u2014 in\ndreams. I used to have nightmares. Presently I have them very seldom. I probably will\nhave one next couple nights. When I saw Schindler\u2019s List \u2014 after I saw Schindler\u2019s List, |\nhad a couple real \u2014 just almost like \u2014 like it really happened there and I was there back \u2014\nback there. But it is so far away. One time, St. Paul Cathedral was showing a film,\nNacht'** \u2014 Night and Fog. The film still exists. It was made by the Polish French\ncompany and you can still get the video of it. Anyway, I was asked to come and watch\nwith them and to talk about it later on. Well, it was shortly after I came here and after that\nwent \u2014 that went through, I could not talk, mainly because I saw the steps. Hundred and\neighty-six steps from a stone quarry, leading to the camp in Mauthausen. And I walked\nthose steps for 11 days, carrying a big stone. When you first came into Mauthausen, you\nwent through the introduction, you were put in a Strafkommando, punishment company.\nYou went down to the quarry and you went up, you went down. Oh, it was about six,\nseven times a day and you took the biggest stone you could carry, because if you didn\u2019t,\nwhen you got to about 100 steps up, the Kapo would look and said, \u201cHey you and you\nand you and you, step out there. You stupid so and so. Look at the rest of them, they are\njust breaking down, getting ruptures. And you took two those little stones?\u201d So he give\nthem a push and they would fly down. And that happened just about every day. Five, 10 -\n15 -20 people would be killed a day, in the Strafkommando. And sometime, when he had\na special order, they would make people run. It was Fliegerbriicke,'\u201d the flying bridge.\nThere was a kind of a little platform and he would run people to the platform and they\nwould fly down, like two or 300 feet. And then the quarry supervisor started complaining\nthat they messed \u2014 \u201cHe is messing up my work, so make him stop. That so and so is\n'** Night (German)\n'\u00b0 Flyer\u2019s bridge (German)\nmessing up my work. He had all those \u2014 those \u2014 all that mess, those smashed prisoners\nthere. I have to clean it up every day.\u201d\nSo it kind of abated, but he was still killing people. If he didn\u2019t do that, when you \u2014 didn\u2019t\nlike you or you got close up and the upper was kind of a steep road into the gate, front\ngate of the Grosse Tor \u2014 he would take your hat, we had those stripped berets \u2014 he would\ntake it and make it fly beyond the post line. And you had to put your stone down,\neverybody waited and you went to retrieve it. And that was a no-no, because it was\nbeyond the line, and people up on the tower there would open up and shoot you.\nSometimes they would just wound you, most of the time they would kill you. And you\nhad to go and retrieve your hat because if you walked to the gate, you had to take your\nhat and walk at attention, you know, your hat to your leg and walk stiffly and carry your\nbig stone here, you know. Straighten up. SS at the gate, if you did not have a hat to take\noff, they would take you \u2014 take you aside and beat you \u2014 most of the time they would\ntake you aside and shoot you. There would be pile of people, dead bodies on the side,\npeople who did not have their hats with them. Those little exercises. I made it for 11 days\nand lived to tell. Anyway, it was kind of a little introduction to the system.",
        "A: When I saw those steps, I could not talk. Hundred and eighty-six steps \u2014 stone steps,\nquite steep. Just try to walk 180 \u2014 80 steep \u2014 86 steps carrying nothing, at a good clip. I\ndon\u2019t think I could now. I walk up a bunch of steps when you go to state park and you\nhear, \u201cOh, let\u2019s stand down for awhile, Steven, let\u2019s take a rest.\u201d",
        "A: Yes, it does. But in that time, it was nothing. I just thought I was tough son of a gun. I\ncouldn\u2014 I could do anything. Especially after surviving two and a half, almost \u2014 well not\nexactly three \u2014 is about two and a half years in Polish underground with a \u2014 with a\nfighting group. That was a survival. Later on, camp at times, was almost like a \u2014 well,\nkind of a mild danger. You avoid this, you avoid that, you may live forever. You are\nhungry, maybe you can organize something, you can steal something. Maybe somebody\nwill give you piece of bread. Maybe you\u2019ll catch a dog.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014I stayed and worked most of the time, most of the people didn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t\nwant to. People who stay in places who don\u2019t have to work, they don\u2019t want to work. We\ntalk sometime about our welfare people, they\u2019re paid little and not to have to work.\nPeople who don\u2019t work, won\u2019t work. There were probably \u2014 out of five, eight, 10,000, in\nWildflecken, maybe 200 of us who worked. The rest of the people didn\u2019t. And I knew\none person who was a black market operator, he was a rich \u2014 one rich young man. And\neach person were living in a camp had to donate half a day work to the camp, like\nchopping trees for the fuel, sweeping streets or doing something. Well, he didn\u2019t. So he\nwas called to the camp director and the camp director said, \u201cMr. So and So, I have a\nreport here you haven\u2019t worked last week.\u201d And said, \u201cMr. Director, that\u2019s a lie. I never\nworked.\u201d \u201cYou never worked? You are supposed to work.\u201d \u201cI pay well, people who go\nand work for me. When my time comes, there is a person who goes and works for me\nhard, for half a day or a day, I pay him well. Mr. Director, that\u2019s a lie, I never worked.\u201d\nThat was the mentality of \u2014 that people developed. Later on when they went to various\ncountries, there were some were repatriated to Poland, but very few. When Communism\ntook over, they did not want to, as I didn\u2019t want to. Many went to Canada, many went \u2014\nmany \u2014 some \u2014 everybody wanted to come to America. Some went to Belgium, some\nwent to England. Many went to Australia and New Zealand. While those people had \u2014 at\ntimes had a hard time adjusting back and going back to work. So I stayed in Wildflecken\nuntil 1949 and the U.S. Catholic Conference found a sponsor here and I went through the\nconsul and a doctor and document this and document that \u2014 all kind of little documents.\nAs the Russians said, \u201cS propiskom vsy\u00e9 mozhna'\u201d\u00b0 zrobic.'*\u201d\u201d With a little card, you can\ndo almost anything. Ru\u2014 in Russia, if you had to have a propiska'** to move from place to\nplace, to visit next village, you have to have a propiska issued by police because you\ncannot move freely. Well, now maybe you can, but that time you could not. So all this\nlittle documents and you had to go through a doctor and \u2014 well, I worked part time with\nAmerican CIC. '*\u201d They came one time when I was still in Aschaffenburg.",
        "A: The American CIC people came and talked to me and said, \u201cWe are catching some of the\nGerman criminals and we kind of feel that you may some \u2014 have something against it,\nwould you want to help us?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d \u201cHow much you want to paid?\u201d \u201cPaid? If I had\nmoney, I would pay you.\u201d CIC was the counter-intelligent corps, U.S. Army. There were\ntwo captains who worked there and I worked with them until full maturation. One or two\ndays a week I would get release from the police force and work with them. We went\nacross the green border into East Germany and occasionally apprehended somebody who\nwas being searched for and brought him back.\n'\u00b0\u00b0 With a visa one can...anything (Russian)\n\"27 To (Polish)\n'8 Visa (Russian)\n'\u00b0 Counter Intelligence Corps",

So then they helped me a lot, too \u2014 to go through and get in. Yes, but was\nmostly the Catholic organization who found me sponsor here. I came to St. Paul, I lived\nwith a old couple \u2014 old, ancient couple for quite some time, paid room and board. Then I\nmoved out and leaded my little \u2014 one little single room overlooking the whole city. I had\na beautiful view, it was up on a hill. Old house with little rooms and a landlady who\ncharged us very little rent. It was a very carefree life.",
        "A: Not really, I think we just did almost everything. Oh yes. Yes, I\u2014 I met Hans Christian,\nwho was my interrogator.",
        "A: Yes, my German interrogator. Ph.D. from Heidelberg University. He was arrested, he\nwas in jail under different name and Captain Wulkanowski took me \u2014 took me to\nBriickenau, where the man was in jail and he said, \u201cStefan, maybe you would like to talk\nto this man, he speaks Polish.\u201d So they took me to his cell and I said, \u201cHans Christian,\nwhat are you doing here?\u201d \u201cWas machen Sie da hier?'*\u201d\u201d And he looked, he said,\n\u201cStefan?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cDu bist no\u2019 nit tot?\u2019*'\u201d I said, \u201cWell, if I was dead, I\u2019m resurrected.\u201d\nSo I asked him what his name is and he had different name. I said, \u201cHis name is Hans\nChristian. He was in \u2014 a Gestapo interrogator. When he was questioning me, he took me\nout four times and shot next to me, four different people and told me I was going to be\nthe next one if I don\u2019t tell him what he wants to know. And I know that those people are\nnot tried to be executed.\u201d I testified against him. So he \u2014 Mister \u2014 Captain Wulkanowski\nsaid, \u201cWell\u201d \u2014 he chain him. He chain him to the bed. He said, \u201cStay a while. Beat the\nshit out of him.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, Il stay with him for awhile.\u201d So we \u2014 I stayed and we\ntalked.

And Captain\nWulkanowski, I walked out and said, \u201cTake my pistol, go and shoot the son of a bitch.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cShoot him? You people can hang him, I don\u2019t want to shoot him.\u201d Yeah, Hans\nChristian. Beautiful, tall, blonde man with blue eyes and beautiful bleach hair.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. We promised ourselves, when we were in a camp, when we were 1n Gusen,\nwhen the freedom come, if we are alive, we will go burning, killing. Not raping because\nwe are not strong enough, but we will do horrible things here. Nobody did anything. The\nonly one atrocity that we committed \u2014 that people committed in a camp \u2014 was a Spanish\nfrom a Spanish civil war \u2014 his name was Santacara. He was Oberkapo'\u201d of the first shift.\nHe had under him about 20,000 people. And he beat people and he killed people, he\ndrowned people. If, if somebody he didn\u2019t like, he would just pick them up and \u2014 and tip\nhim.\n[Technical conversation]\nHe was very bad person, he would \u2014 didn\u2019t like somebody, he would lead a person to a\nwashroom, pick him up and put him in the barrel head first and drown him. I mean he\nwas just a bad person. Anyway, there were a bunch of Russians who hated him, because\nhe especially hated Russians, I don\u2019t know why, because he was a Spanish Communist\nand the Russians were Russian Communists, but he hated them. So they nailed him \u2014\nthey stripped him, they nailed him to the barrack by hands and feet and they took a heavy\nmachine gun and they shot him to pieces. And I watched \u2014 when I was in the hospital I\nwatched out of my window \u2014 was \u2014 my bunk was next to the window, I watched it. And I\nasked, \u201cWho that was?\u201d \u201cOh, was Santacara.\u201d \u201cOh, Santacara.

I\u2019ll bring some good schnapps.\u201d So I\ncame the next day. Instead of watery beer, he had some good schnapps, we had a drink\nand we used to meet from time to time. And he even did me little favors. He liked those\ntwo girls, apparently. So later on discovered he was the supply officer, I kind of went\nclo\u2014 and I showed a bunch of money, said, \u201cWould you like some money?\u201d \u201cJa, Ja.'*\u00b0\nWhat do you want me to sell you?\u201d I said, \u201cA Schmeisser.\u201d \u201cJa.\u201d \u201cZwei Schmeissers?\u2019*\u201d\u201d\n\u201cJa.\u201d \u201cFiinf und zwanzig Schmeissers?'\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cTwenty-five Schmeissers?\u201d \u201cJa.

He had it delivered to a place\nwhere I want it, driving the truck himself, we unloaded it. He went \u2014 happy with his\nmoney. A good German can sell you his mother or daughter. Well, I have a \u2014 after the\nwar I had a lady who used to do my washing, a German lady, refugee lady who had a\nbunch of children and she escaped from the eastern part of Germany to western part of\nGermany, she has a daughter, was \u201cRita the Virgin.\u201d And I went out with her daughter a\nfew times and she says, \u201cStefan, be sure that you don\u2019t go to sleep with my daughter.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cFrau Anders, '*\u2019 I would never go to sleep with a beautiful young girl.\u201d \u201cRita is a\nvirgin.\u201d Well, we called her from then on, we called \u201cRita the Virgin.\u201d \u201cI would let Rita\nsleep with a rich American who would give me a big bag of Polen kaffee'*\u201d \u2014 unground\ncoffee.
