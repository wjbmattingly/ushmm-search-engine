        "Question: This is an interview with Itka Zygmuntowicz recorded on May 30, 1996. Tape one, side\none.",
        "Answer: This is one of my poems that I have written. It's called \"The Silent Voice'. It is dedicated\nto all those who's voices have been silenced forever in the Holocaust from 1933 to 1945. I wrote\nthis poem May 11, 1980.\nWhen ages of civilization crumble to dust\nAnd death is raging supreme\nWhen the Devil is crowned by the power of deceit\nThen freedom is a far away dream.\nWhen all that you loved is taken from you\nAnd you are stripped to the bare bone\nWhen all moral boundaries and laws are broken\nThen you are in Hell with Satan alone.\nWhen Jews are depicted as sub-human, as vermin\nAnd brute force and evil prevail\nWhen Nazi doctors turn children to corpses\nThen all logic and reason fails.\nWhen the whole world remains dead silent\nWith the exception of just a few\nThen they grant Satan license and opportunity\nTo murder in the gas chambers a God-loving Jew.\nWhen man and woman are kept apart\nAnd new life is not conceived\nWhen there is no sound of laughter or song\nHow can God by man be perceived?\nWhen mass murder of the Jews becomes legal\nUnder the banner of an ideology or God's sacred name\nThen its not the victims but the nazi murderers who did not resist Satan and defile God's name.\nWhen living skeletons are marching at gunpoint\nThrough the gate of Auschwitz in long columns of five, cold, starved, forced to hard labor\nWhat power on earth gave them the strength to survive?\nWhen all heads are shaved, all human rights denied\nAnd all wear the same kind of striped dress\nWhen to worship God becomes a crime\nThen the whole world is in a very terrible mess.\nWhen Hitler's dreams become a reality\nAnd the nazi's send Jews to the left and to the right\nThen such men are not ruled by God's divine power\nBut by their own burning ambition for power and might.\nWhen the so-called superior Arian nazi race used all their knowledge, technology and skill\nTo murder 6 million Jews merely for being born Jewish\nThat I don't believe was God, but Hitler's demonic will.\nThat explains a lot to us.",
        "Q: Why don't we, I'd like to begin by having you tell me your name, date of birth and where you\nwere born, and a little bit about your family. And you might tell me your name now and your name\nat birth.",
        "A: My legal name is Itka Zygmuntowicz. I was named after my maternal great-grandmother Itka\nwho was also born in Poland. And my family name, my parents name, was Cim-mo-nella-simon\n(ph). My family use to call me Yit-cola (ph) In-de-yum-fa-yetska (ph), a name which I\nlike to be called. I was born April 15, 1926 during Passover, the Jewish holiday celebrating\n. I was the oldest of three siblings. I was born in a small town, Chair-han-off (ph)\nPoland, located about 90 kilometers north of Warsaw. At the time when the Nazis came in, I was\n13 years old and the population of our hometown, Chair-han-off (ph) Poland was about 15,000. A\nlittle less than half of that was Jewish. My family consisted at that time of my parents,\nHymen, my little brother Soo-lick (ph), my little sister Zee-sil (ph) and my maternal\nwidowed grandmother, . My ancestors on my mother's side came to\nPoland from Germany around the 16\" century. Four generations were still alive and each one had a\nlot of children because they came from an orthodox background. So my grandmother was one of\nseven siblings. My mother was one of seven siblings. My Aunt who lived also in Chair-han-off\n(ph) had also seven children. My other Uncle had three children. They all had, the younger ones\nhad less because we didn't have enough opportunity before the war to have more children. So we\nhad a very large family. I feel that both my parents and my grandmother were my first teachers and\nmy first role models. I remember when I was a little girl, my grandmother used, who was an\nextremely religious woman, observant woman, at home we only spoke Yiddish. We observed the\nJewish laws, customs and traditions. And my grandmother was wearing a shaytle (ph), in Yiddish\nits called, and it's called a wig in English, but not to beautify herself but for religious purposes. For\nmy grandmother religion was not just a belief, it was a way of life which effected the way she\nbehaved, the way she dressed, the way she taught us. And I remember that every morning when I\nwould get up my grandmother would say with me the prayers and in the evening she would say with\nme the prayers. She used to give me coins to put in the push-ka (ph), which is called her charity\nbox, and she would tell me, \"Yit-cola (ph), to help those who are less fortunate than we are is our\nmitzvah (ph), our commandment.\" I remember one time I was still a preschooler, didn't know one\ncoin from another, and a poor man came to our door and asked my grandmother for alms. And my\ngrandmother gave me some change, some coins, I had no idea the value of it but I looked in my\nhand and I said, \"Grandma, so much money?\" And my grandmother said, \"My child, you only have\nwhat you give away.\" I questioned my grandmother's proverb because I couldn't understand it,\nbeing so little, how can you give away something and still have it? So my grandma began with a\nsmile and says, \"Yit-cola (ph), I only give what God and my parents have given me. I'm not giving\nmine.\" This is how she felt. And she taught me lots of Yiddish songs, told me lots of stories. I\ncame from a family of story-tellers. And since, at that time, technology was not developed so much\nso, and my grandmother had lots of children. In fact, when Germany invaded Poland, my\ngrandmother had five married children, 21 great-children and one great-grandchild. Only one\ngranddaughter, which I'm going to speak about a little later, her name was also Yit-cola (ph). I was\neight years old when she emigrated to Palestine in 1934, to get married with somebody who was,\nwithout her boyfriend, that she met also in Poland, Check-han-off (ph), who was from the same city,\nthe same, and he left a little earlier, so she went there to marry him. And I remember that the whole\nfamily was gathered and everybody was crying and saying, \"God knows if we will see each other\nagain.\" And my grandmother, who was a woman of very deep faith, tried to comfort us and she\nsaid, \"Yit-cola (ph), , don't cry. With God all things are possible.\" I\nalways admired my grandmother's strength because she lived through World War One. She lost a\nbrother, she lost her husband, she lost two of her children, that was before the Holocaust, and she\nlost a granddaughter. But she never lost her unshakable faith in God. And she always believed and\nshe never questioned. And it seemed to me the more she suffered, the more she believed and the\nkinder she was, so she was a wonderful role model for me. And she lived with us from the day I\nwas born. And she was the only one in my family who was privileged to die a natural death shortly\nafter Germany invaded Poland. From early childhood on my parents and grandmother stressed to\nus children the meaning and importance of , which in English means\nhumanness. Whenever I would do something that didn't measure up to the yardstick of\n, they never screamed at me, they didn't hit me, but they would explain to me why it's\nwrong, and usually they would say, \"Yit-cola (ph), its not .\" Tuse to cringe when\nthey said this here because I knew that they disapproved and eventually I started to view myself\nthrough that yardstick. You know, when I did something I felt always will my parents approve?\nBut they also, what they did also is that they, when I did something good they used to praise me.\nAnd I really felt that they loved me unconditionally and that was a wonderful gift. But they were\nstrict with me. When I was already a school girl, I remember in Poland was very cold winters and\nsome of the kids, and we were wearing old wool socks, stockings I mean, and I don't even\nremember how they use to hold up but I remember they were always rolling up, they were like\nyou know and the kids didn't like it. So a few kids put on knee socks and I wanted to\nwear knee socks too. So I remember that I asked my parents, can I put on the knee socks? And\nthey said, \"Yit-cola (ph), its too cold\". And I was naughty and I figured I'm not going to start to\nconvince them, I felt I'm not going to be cold, , so what did I do? I went in\nand I put the knee socks underneath my stockings and I went to school. My father often used to\ncome to the school yard because he had actually two kinds of, first we were in the dairy business,\nlike wholesale dairy business, but he was with a partner and obviously I don't know why, whether\nthey, like the partnership dissolved, and then he started to work in photography and picture framing.\nSo he used to travel sometimes and whenever he would come home, or before he left, if I wasn't\nhome, the school wasn't far to drop in and sometimes even bring me some goodies or something,\njust to see me. So that particular morning, I went to school and it was recess and some of the kids\nstarted to say, \"Yit-cola (ph), your father is here.\" And I didn't know what to do. I was wearing the\nknee socks. And my father looked at me, and I'll never forget for as long as I live, that look, and he\nsaid, \"Yit-cola (ph), I feel very and disappointed in you. Because everybody can make\na mistake, but when a person lies, he deliberately deceives you and this is not and\nI'm very disappointed.\" And I felt so terrible and I started to cry and ask forgiveness, so he fixed me\nup and said, I was still not so old yet, and he said to me, I'll never forget it, \"Yit-cola (ph),\neverybody makes a mistake but only a fool makes twice the same. And in everything there is a\nlesson. So I hope that you have learned, that you cannot lie without becoming a liar and helping\nother people.\" The reason I am sharing this story is because I found out later when the Nazis came\nin, when everything was deception, how important it is to speak the truth and not to lie, and you\nknow how justice is important. I remember one time I was walking home from school alone and a\nbunch of kids that I didn't know, and who did not know me, attacked me both verbally and\nphysically. I tried to free myself but the circle closed around me and I felt punches coming all over.\nAnd I couldn't, it was both the physical pain and the emotional because that was my first encounter\nwith an incident like this here, with anti-Semitism. And I couldn't understand why. Why are they\nso angry with me? Why do they hate me so much? I was too young to understand it and I came\nhome crying bitterly. Usually I was not a cry baby and my mother saw that something serious must\nhave happened, she was home. And she asked me, \"Yit-cola (ph), what's happened?\" You'll see\nlater why those things are important, because of the values.",
        "Q: So your mother asked you what happened?",
        "A: What happened. I related to her the whole story. And she did not say a single word, she just\ntook me lovingly in her arms and she tried to comfort me. After I finally quieted down and stopped\ncrying, she looked at me and she asked me, \"Yit-cola (ph), and what did you do?\" And I was\nshocked. I said, \"Nothing.\" And my mother looked , She said, \"Well my\nchild, then you have nothing to cry about. Your does not depend on how others\ntreat you but on how you treat others.\" And I remember my family taught me that my\ndoes not depend on how others treat me but how I treat others, which had a tremendous\nimpact on me up to this date. Because they taught me how never to held others, how not to shame\nor held others because its not . But they never taught me, what should I do\nwhen I am held, how should I respond? So what I used to do, I use to cry. Because I knew I cannot\nheld anybody and I cannot, and another thing which they taught me, is that no one can break my\nspirit as long as I don't do something evil. As long as I don't do something wrong. So they actually\nvery much stressed , Yiddish , . I received\nboth, like I said at home we spoke Yiddish but in school we spoke Polish and I had also, I went to\nBant-tee-os-kov (ph), which was a Jewish and Hebrew school. My little brother actually started at\nage three. My parents were both culturally and religiously Jewish but they were not orthodox. But\nin those days, not orthodox was more than today, just like because we observed all the holidays, we\nhad in our home, and we lived accordingly to the Jewish teachings and customs and\ntraditions. Because my mother was the only one of my grandmother's children who didn't wear a\nshaytal (ph), who didn't wear a wig, because my mother was a very artistic person. She had a\nbeautiful voice and I remember still how she used to sing to me, teach me Yiddish songs. Because\nbefore my mother was married, she belonged to a Jewish drama group and she use to play in the\nYiddish Theater. And at that time, the Yiddish Theater used to be the , like a\nregular theater but they had that in the fire house, you know? Where the firemen lived, so they\nwould allow them there. But after she was married and she had a family she would do it only for\ncharity. So my parents very often used to take me to the theater and my mother belonged to a\nliterary group. She was more, she was very artistic. If she would have had the opportunity then she\nwould have done much more, but unfortunately. And I think that she instilled in me a love for\nliterature, she use to read aloud and tell stories, because as I said, my grandmother had lots of\ngrandchildren and children. Except for one son and one cousin, you know the cousin that left in\n1934, my cousin Yitle Pash-o-vick (ph), and one of my Uncles who left when he was 18 years old, I\nnever knew him. I knew him only through photographs and through letters that the family used to\nget from England, London. Because that's where he married and he lived. So the whole family\nlived in Poland and we used to be a very close-knit family. So we got together and because there\nwas not, as I had mentioned before, technology, so parts of, when we would get together they used\nto, the family used to sit and tell stories, reminisce, you know? And everybody thought that I don't\neven pay attention and I was just sitting in a corner and listen and take in all these stories. Another\ntime also that I heard a lot of stories is that in Poland, Chair-han-off (ph), where we lived, there was\nonly one Synagogue. But there was the , like they call it, like the study house and a\nlot of the boys who came to study there, to the Yit-shiva (ph), some of them were from other cities\nso they used to be on Friday or on holidays, my father would always bring home, in the Hebrew its\ncalled , or guests. And then there would be conversation at the table and they used to\nask him questions and he would tell adventures and stories. So it was, and one thing also, that after\nmy mother was married she didn't work so I always had my mother and my grandmother home,\nwhich was a great influence. I remember another story which also had a very great influence on me,\nis that we didn't have running water or electricity in our home. And winter, to heat the house, we\ncooked on an iron stove, and to heat the house it used to be a tile oven, which reached from the\nfloor, most people in Poland had those, and they used to, they were able to open wells, you put the\nwood to heat it, to bake potatoes and bake apple in there sometimes, but mostly the winter time this\nwould be the source of heat, that heated the house. So when they came on the holidays and\n, they would sit around the oven and tell these stories. And so I heard a lot of stories\nand I knew a lot about Jewish life. And I was always, when I started to go to school, one of my\nworst subjects was history. Because the way it was presented, it was just to me a bunch of dates,\nlong ago, and a lot of places. But it was not presented as relevant to our life and I had no idea\nbefore the Holocaust how history effects our lives, because history is made by people and it effects\npeople. And I was a creative child. I loved to sing, I loved to write and to read, I was forever doing\nthis. And I was dreaming that when I, after I finished public school, that I going to continue to have\nmore formal education, that I'm going to become a writer. Even as a young girl I used to write a lot.\nAnd I remember my father always was so proud of me, my parents, my grandmother, and my father\nused to take me a lot with him so when we went someplace he always said, \"Yit-cola (ph), recite a\npoem.\" And I was blessed until this day to God with a good memory and I've learned the poems\nand I learned lots of songs, both at home. And another source of, I remember that it's almost funny,\nthat there used to people who would go in the courtyard and sing and play instruments and some\nhad wonderful voices and played well, and people would throw them down money. So I remember\nonce I was going home, it was on a Friday, I was going home from school. And those people\nplayed in our yard and I always wanted to learn all the songs, so they sung a new song. I caught\nmost of it but not all the words for the first time, so I figured they probably will not sing it again in\nthe same courtyard so I followed them. And I got so involved that I completely forgot that its\nFriday and the family is going to be ready, the sha-bot (ph) was observed very strictly. And I\nremember I came home, the candles were lit already, and my father was sitting because the sha-bot\n(ph) was very strictly observed, and here I came in and my mother looked at me, and she said, \"Yit-\ncola (ph), quickly. Go in and wash up. Come to sha-bot (ph).\" And I was so grateful that she didn't\nscream at me or anything. And I remember the holidays and sha-bot (ph), but like I mentioned\nbefore, I was born during Passover, so Passover was my birthday and we always faithfully, every\nyear, we observed Passover. And it was so different than it is now because every single object of\nthe house was taken out in the courtyard. Dishes were changed. And at that time, I remember, we\ndidn't have regular mattresses like today, we had some burlap sacks and it was with straw, it was put\nin the, they changed the straw. And paint the house and wash every object. It was more for\ncleanliness, it was also because of the holiday, so Passover was both a physical and spiritual\ncleansing and I remember, the reason why I speak about Passover, is because it 1s very, it is\ncoincidental, because I was born on Passover and I was liberated on Passover, during Passover, the\nliberation. And I was thinking that before, when we sat at the , and we're talking about\nslavery, talking about the Israelites, the slavery, about the plagues, about starvation, I couldn't\nunderstand this here. Because up until then, I was never starved. I never had any personal tragedy.\nMy faith in God was not tested, it wasn't a , and I couldn't understand all those things. And\nI remember, now when I think back, I said, I'm not surprised that people do not understand what we\nsuffered because only somebody who suffered can, maybe they can understand but not the same\nway. They cannot relate because, to give you an example, if someone, God forbid, has a terrible\nillness then when he talks with somebody who 1s healthy at that time, the healthy person could talk\nabout the future and relates different to life, sees life differently, and this is here. So, in my, it never\nentered my mind that one day I will suffer like this here. That my people will suffer like this here.\nAnd I remember also another incident, its like I started to tell you, we didn't have heat but, we didn't\nhave running water and we didn't have electricity in our home, so we...",
        "Q: Let me just ask here, you didn't have these but that was normal? You were fairly middle\nincome?",
        "A: Yeah, that was not because we were of poverty. This was because in the small ;\nnobody in the small had it at that time. So, in fact, when I went now back to Poland,\nthey still have, some people have outhouses and things, you know? But its so much more modern,\nits more in the larger city. But at that time it was common, you didn't know\nanything different because I remember, my Aunt lived, my mother's sister, lived in Warsaw. When\nmy family took me I came home and told all my friends, I was excited, she had a toilet and you\npulled the string from the ceiling and I said, \"It was like a miracle to me.\" So it was because this\nwas, I'm describing the world the way I knew it and this all influenced, you know? Because when\nthere was not water in the house, so we had a water carrier who would bring in water. We didn't\nhave like today ready-made foods and, or you could go into the kosher butcher like today and buy a\nchicken. At that time we used to go to the market which was the market place was the place where\nJews and Gentiles had the most relations, was the most involved, because they would bring\nlivestock, chickens, turkey and cows and they would bring vegetable and fruits. The Jewish people\nwould bring what they made, shoes and boots and clothes. So that was the exchange because that\nwas the most time when Jewish people intermingled with the Gentiles. And so those things were,\nthe life was different and it influenced differently also. But going back now to the not having\nelectricity, even though we didn't have electricity we had a light, from a nuft (ph) its called in\nPolish, petroleum, you know?",
        "Q: Kerosene?",
        "A: Kerosene, yes, I forgot the word, kerosene. So we had a kerosene lamp. And still we would\nalways sit and read and it was very, education was extremely important. And so I remember that we\ndidn't have a refrigerator. We didn't have all the modern appliances because at that time nobody had\nthem in our ;\n[end of side 1 of tape 1] So of course we didn't have any, we didn't have electricity, we didn't have\nany refrigerator. And we used to store food in the root cellar. We called it root because, besides\nholding the perishable food we would put in there for the winter, sometimes my father would go to\nthe country and buy like a whole sack of potatoes, carrots, onions, for the winter. And we also\nwould keep there in the winter the perishable food, you know, when we cooked something.\nSometimes when it was very cold, I remember my mother used to put it on the window sill, outside\non the window sill, but mostly in the root cellar. So one time, in the root cellar it was dark. You\nhad to, you opened, there was a square in the kitchen floor with a ring, you pulled up the ring and\nthere was a long ladder. It wasn't built in, 1t was put in, and you had to walk this, this ladder down,\nit was dark. A dirt floor. No windows. Cold. It smelled wonderful with all the different kinds of\nvegetable things. But it was dark and I was, as I mentioned before, I was only 13 when the war\nbroke out and this was earlier, so I was afraid to go down. And my mother noticed that I am afraid.\nShe said, \"Lit a candle.\" She gave me the candle to my hand, and she tell me, she waved to me, for\nme, and she said, \"Go Yit-cola (ph), go. God is in the root cellar too.\" And I loved her, I trusted\nher, and I knew. I understood that if there would be danger for me she wouldn't send me because\nshe was very protective of me. In fact, I was never away one single day in my, until the Nazis came\nin, alone. I was always with the family. So I walked down and I brought up the butter. And\nafterwards I wasn't so afraid anymore of the dark root cellar. For two reasons. First of all, because I\nremembered my mother's words, \"Go, Yit-cola (ph), God is 1n the root cellar.\" And secondly, for\nmyself I thought, if I could do it once I can do it again. And so at home it was warm, it was a\nwonderful world. My grandmother was, like I mentioned, she would not permit me to take a bite of\nfood without saying , which means a special prayer. And always stressed the\nimportance. Yiddish guide, the mental guide to her was . And another thing which I\ndo really appreciate a lot about my grandmother is, that whenever I did for her a little added. She\nnever took me for granted. She would many times over say, \"Oh my , God Bless you\nand thank you\", and she would make me feel so good. And one time I said, \"Grandma, its just a\nlittle thing.\" I didn't call her grandma, I called her ; for grandmother.\nAnd I said, \"It's just a little thing.\" And my grandmother would smile and she would say, she\nalways, when I asked her something she had such a beautiful, warm smile, she said, \"Yes my child.\nBut kindness and caring are not little things.\" And the reason why the is later I found\nout how much those values helped to shape me. And also of course there was the influence from\nfriends. In fact, I used to have one friend because where we lived, we lived at two addresses. I was\nborn 1n one house and then we moved. And the first house, the entrance was from the back and I\nremember like today, there was a huge field and I used to play there. And one of my girlfriends was\na Polish little girl, her name was Helenka (ph). I cannot remember any longer the last name, but we\nused to play a lot together. And I remember that she used to come like in the morning when it\nsnowed, winters were cold, so I don't know how its called in English but I would go out and lay\ndown on the snow and make a...",
        "Q: An angel?",
        "A: An angel, you know? And with Helenka (ph) we would, you know? And then I remember like\ntoday, I was always very happy child and I was playing. And I remember when I was little and I\nwent to the field and I felt such a sense of , SO I would flop my hands like a feldas (ph)\nand pretend that I'm a bird and fly. And later, it never entered my mind that one day all this going to\nbe gone. That I will not have this anymore. And then, everything all of a sudden changed when the\nNazis came in.",
        "Q: You mentioned this Polish girl. Did you have other friends or other neighbors who were not\nJewish?",
        "A: We, there were not too many, not too many. We had some non-Jewish, and we had a good\nrelationship to them. Actually, I personally, the only serious incident of anti-Semitism was when I\nwas walking home. And another thing which also, but that was not, it was verbal, it was not\nattacked. I once heard a non-Jewish child saying to me, \"The houses are yours but the streets are\nours.\" And at that time it didn't reflect, but I could, also when I was thinking about it I said, \"What\ndo you mean? My family lives here already for, my ancestors came here in the 1600's. We are\ncitizens. We do everything. And yet, we're not looked as equals?\" You know, you sense a little bit.\nBut I personally didn't sense it so much. I knew more about it from going to Hebrew school,\nknowing about the poems from my grandmother and my parents, use to tell how it was. I also knew\ngood things also about some neighbors, but we had pretty decent relationships. It wasn't at that\ntime, but that was after like, after Pew-suit-ski (ph), Mal-shall-vic Pew-suit-ski (ph) died, things\nstarted to change. And you know, we were not treated, we were treated like second-class citizens in\nmany ways because when we wanted to go to higher studies, it started like a few years before the\nHolocaust, you couldn't go, Jewish people couldn't go to the university, we were not allowed.",
        "Q: What year are you talking?",
        "A: What year? I would say like in 1937 or 1938 it started to get a little more because I don't\nremember the exact year that Pew-suit-ski (ph) died, but things were a lot better. Though the\ngovernment officially didn't have any law against Jews, or sanctions, but there were many types of\nthings I remember from the stories that I heard, the family tell and from other people, and from\nhistory. That I know that the Jewish people were, we were on the .",
        "Q: Did you know about, or did your family talk about, what was happening in Germany prior to\n1939? Did you know who Hitler was?",
        "A: At the time? No. I didn't know much of politics, yes. I was like I said a creative child. I was\nmore interested in writing and in playing with the kids and doing art work and singing, I loved to\nsing since I was a child. And my mother taught me, not just my mother but both my parents\nbecause they used to take me to the theater, many songs and things.",
        "Q: So your family didn't talk about what was happening in neighboring Germany?",
        "A: Maybe they talked but I don't remember this in particular. That didn't, you know, like I said, I\nwas only 13 years old when the war broke out. And another thing when I was a child, here a 13\nyear old child knows a lot about her body, knows, you know? Because I wasn't brought up in the\nenvironment and my grandmother was so orthodox, so it was more modest and you didn't know\nmuch about sex, you know? And we didn't talk too much about those things at that time. And I\nremember that in our city there was a girl, her name was Rosa Loberta (ph) and she was a leader\nfrom . And because some of my friends who were somewhat older along\nthere, to tell you the truth, I knew it\u2019s a Zionistic organization. I didn't understand yet exactly the, I\ndidn't know too much about politics to be very honest with you. So I wanted to belong too. And in\nPoland everybody belongs to orthodox, to some different organizations, but practically everybody\nbelonged to the organizations, so I wanted to belong to . And I\nremember she took me to one meeting and Rosa Loberta (ph) was there and I met her and I said to\nher, \"Rosa, I would like to belong to the meeting.\" And this was about a year before the Nazis came\nin. And she said, \"Yit-cola (ph), you have to wait because it starts from\n\"And when came I no longer could do it. And later, I don't know\nif you know about Rosa Loberta (ph), she was...",
        "Q: Did she impress you at the time?",
        "A: Yes. She was a very happy person and from what everybody told me a tremendous leader.\nVery, very much for Israel. She was very much involved in Zionist and she was hoping that, very\nmuch involved. You know, the older children, because I was and I think because of my\ngrandmother I didn't, I was more in the religious influence, but I also was lucky because I had all\nother influence from my parents who took me to the theaters, who took me to Jewish plays and\nevery summer we would go to the country and , cousins, from Warsaw, because I\nhad cousins there, I had cousins, the , SO we would get together.\nAnd I remember like today, I used to be so happy to go with my mother and she was very\naffectionate, she was very warm. And I remember, I'm not a thinker, but my mother, which also\nmade a great influence, that she instilled in me a love for literature and for singing and everything.\nIs that when we lived in Poland, we didn't have closets like we have now. We had what they called\na French amour' (ph) and it was a wooden chest that reached almost from the floor to the ceiling and\nit had two doors. Facing the chest, the right-hand side was wider, it was used for the wardrobe, and\nthe left side was for linen and the very highest it had hats of my grandmother's and my mother's,\nhats lying there. And for some reason, when I was younger, this was still a pre-schooler, this was\nalways locked, this side of the wardrobe. And I couldn't understand why, I was so curious and I\nused to try to play all kinds of games to try to guess what is in that chest. And I used to think,\nmaybe a treasure, maybe a skeleton, I even used to went so far as to think that maybe I am adopted\nand they don't want me to know that I am adopted and they are hiding the papers. It was a whole\nsource of curiosity for me. And I remember one day my mother said, \"Yit-cola (ph), please come.\nCome here. I want to show you something.\" She took out the key and she opened the chest. And I\nhad like two kinds of emotions. In one way, I was burning with curiosity to see what is in the chest\nthat was constantly closed. And on the other hand, I was frightened, what I'm going to find there?\nWhat is there? And she opened the chest and she said, \"Look Yit-cola (ph).\" And it was a whole\nchest full of books, all leather-bound books. And she took out a book, pointed to the closet, she\nsaid, \"Yit-cola (ph), when you will learn how to read, you will be with the greatest minds. You can\nsit right here in Chair-hon-off (ph), you will see the world through great poets and writers and you\nwill travel all over the world.\" And she took out a book, she took me on her knee, and she started to\nread. And this became a daily ritual to which I looked forward. And I was quite young when I\nknew a lot of Yiddish literature and Yiddish plays and poetry because my mother never read to me\nlittle children's stories, she started with this grown up stuff. And one story that I wanted to relate,\nwhich was written by , a Yiddish writer, it was called\n, Bunchos (ph) of the Silent. I remember many stories, but this\nstory I'm relating to you because I've been thinking about it most of the time when I was in\nAuschwitz. And the story is about a young child, about a man actually who was called Bunchos\n(ph), which means silent. And this man, when he was a little child, lost\nhis mother and became an orphan, only had his father. At the age of 13, the father remarried and\ntook a very cruel woman who abused the little boy. She would eat well but she would starve him.\nShe made him chop wood barefoot in the winter. He never had a new change of clothes. They\ndidn't send him to school. Didn't have a friend. But no matter what she, he was constantly lonely,\nbut he never complained, not even to his father. And one time, in the middle of the winter, in a\ndrunken stupor, his father threw him out in the middle of the night, dragged him out by the hair. He\npicked himself up and he left and he was going from place to place. He wandered into a big city\nand for no reason known to him he was put in jail. And then he was, for the same unknown reason\nto him, he was let go. But he was still silent. Never complained. Then the story relates how he\nsuffered also, starvation, looking for job, and worse than the job was looking for the job, and then\npeople wouldn't pay him. He was constantly abused but Buncho (ph) was always silent. And then\nhe married a woman who already had a child. And it was a little boy, a baby. And she left him with\nthe child and he raised the child, when the boy was 15 years old, he threw him out from the house.\nBut Buncho (ph) was again silent. And it relates the whole story, a beautiful story. It kept me so in\nsuspense. I remember it today. Actually when I learned to read Yiddish, which I learned to read\nwell, I read many of the books which my mother had in that chest. And the reason why she kept it\nlocked is because I was the oldest child and she was afraid that the little children might damage her\nbooks. Later, when we were older, the chest was open when we learned to respect it. But its just\nthe values that she had. So this man was constantly abused and later somebody run him over with a\nhorse and wagon. And even in the hospital where people are allowed to complain, he was still\nsilent. And in silence he lived and in silence he died. And after he was buried they put a piece of\nwood and a marker on his grave and the wind blew away the marker and the gravedigger's wife\nfound it and used it to light the, to heat the stove. So he didn't even have a grave or anything. And\nthen, but it was different, the writer says, in the other world, the world where there is justice. And\nwhen he came up, they told him, \"Buncho (ph), here in heaven everything is yours. Whatever you\nwant. Pick, choose.\" And he couldn't believe it. Why would somebody be so good to him in the\nother world where they were so cruel to him here? And yet, Buncho (ph) didn't complain. Not to\nman, not to God, never, he was envious that somebody had more. So finally they said, \"Buncho\n(ph), what would you like?\" And he couldn't believe it. And finally he said, \"Well, your\nExcellency, all I would like is every morning for breakfast a hot roll with butter.\" And when I was,\nlater during the Nazis, I was thinking very much about this story because I realized why he was\nsilent. He had no choice. And also, what would we give for a piece of bread. So the literature, and\nalso another thing which I often think about this story, is that Paris (ph) who was a great Yiddish\nwriter, that he wrote about one man and this has become a Yiddish classic. This book is in English\nstill and its beautiful. I didn't go into all the details because it would be too long, but the basic thing\nis, the cruelty. And when he says here that they look, why was he silent? He didn't have to be\nsilent, he should have cried out. But when the Nazis came in, I realized that I became like Buncho\n(ph) the Silent. When Germany invaded Poland, the first thing of the hometown, the first thing I\nremember, because at that time we lived in the other house already. And our house was strict\n, which was near Warsaw Street, which was the main street. And as soon as we\ncame out, this was almost in the corner, was a large house and they had a cellar, they had like big\ncellars. So when the air raids was, we went to hiding, into hiding. And even there, sitting there, my\nmother tried to calm us down with telling us stories. She was such a wonderful story-teller and she\nknew so much literature and so many plays. And then, when they just came in, we were still\nallowed to move from place to place, so people started to run. People from Warsaw came to small\ntowns. Other people came to different places. And my father's entire family, his sisters, three\nsisters, one natural sister and two half-sisters, because his father died when he was a young boy, and\nmy father was born in Pull-tos (ph), Poland. So they still lived with the children and, I think, their\nnieces and nephews, they lived in Pull-tos (ph). And we didn't know what's happened to them\nbecause, so my father was going to go, I remember today the conversation between my parents, he\nsaid, \"Let's go to Pull-tos (ph). My sisters are gone.\" Because both parents, like, I never knew my\ngrandparents on my father's side, so he held the responsibilities being the oldest child, to take care of\nthem. But we didn't know, we didn't go. And then, when they took Warsaw, we could no longer go\nfrom place to place. That's when the Nazis begun their systematic destruction.",
        "Q: Did the Germans come into your town? Were there bombings? Did the soldiers actually come\nin?",
        "A: The soldiers came in. There was bombing. And, I just told you, we went into hiding. And then\nwhen the bombing stopped, I'll tell you what my grandmother did. It's almost ironic. My\ngrandmother lived through World War One, so she remembered a different kind of Germany.\nBecause she remembered a Germany not at war against civilian people, women and children\nespecially targets, and Jewish people. So she baked a cake and she said, \"Yit-cola (ph), take it out\nto the poor soldiers that are away from home.\" She was a very compassionate woman. She had\nnothing to do with political , and she asked me to bring it out. So later when they, I think\nit was towards the end of, they came in October, I mean September 1, 1939. At that time was about\n3,300,000 Jews in Poland. Ninety-percent have perished. And most of those, the ten percent who\nsurvived, mostly survived in the USSR Because there were no ghettos. There was no\nconcentration, no gas chambers, you know, concentration camps with gas chambers. They also\nhave suffered.",
        "Q: Okay, tell me your story.",
        "A: So, anyhow. When the Nazis came in to the other cities, that was the last time that I saw my\nrelatives. All the other relatives that lived in the other towns because we could no longer travel\nfrom place to place. They started by taking up the spiritual and the community leaders, the\nintelligencia (ph). Some Polish people too. And they took them away some, they shot, the ones\nthey took away, I didn't see what they did with them so I can only bear witness for what I saw. And\nthey started to destroy the Synagogues, the Holy Scriptures. They confiscated all our businesses.\nWe didn't have, in Check-hon-off (ph) a business. My father was, like I said, I told you before.\nAnd they started to put on curfews. We were not allowed to congregate in large groups. I could no\nlonger, we could no longer go to school, all schools were closed. All social Temples were closed.\nWe had to wear a yellow star. We were not allowed to walk on the pavement, just in the street.\nAnd we had to give up, everyday when we're told this is the worst, something worst happened.\nEveryday they made new laws. And we were not allowed any longer to observe the Jewish laws\nbecause they burned, not openly, they had to do it in hiding.",
        "Q: How soon did this happen after they came in?",
        "A: Well the burnings, they started to burn books. I told you, my mother valued so much book and\nits still such a love for me, for books, and here they started to burn the Holy, all the books that was\nfrom the Yi-shiv-as (ph) and all the books from the Synagogue, in the Synagogue, they burned\ndown everything. So they started to just destruction right away, and curfews, and we were not\nallowed to congregate in large groups, you know, for religious people, to go for ;\nwhich is you have to have 10 people to have for the prayers. So all those things were, actually\nreligious people suffered the most. They started to, when they saw elderly men, most of the people,\nmy father didn't have a beard, he was clean-shaven, but so many other people did. So they laughed,\nthey started to pull out the beard or they would shave off half a beard. They started to torture, to\nmock. Because to, they did whatever they wanted. They had all legal rights to do those things.\nAnd then they confiscated the business, they looted the merchandise. They started to ration the food\nand started starvation. And also we had to, they would grab people to do the work in the street.\nAnd after a whole day's work, they would come home and would have to stay in long lines to get a\nsmall ration, a very small ration. So right away we started to starve. Couldn't go to school. And in\nother country the most important right is the right to protest, to speak up. But you\ncouldn't. So that's when I was thinking a lot about starvation, about Buncho (ph) the Silent. That\nwe had to be silent, you know, in order to survive. And then something happened which effected\nme very much personally, and my mother. They asked us to give up all our valuables, gold and\nvaluables, so we become impoverished and we had to do forced labor. So one day, and also there\nwas a law, that the Jewish people, for the Germans to associate with Jewish people was\nbecause they singled us out as an inferior race. And we were not allowed to have\nany transactions, not business, not social, not sexual, because for the Nazi and the Jew, if this would\nhappen, it would be punished. And we had a big and one time a man, a civilian, until\nthis day I don't know his name, but I remember the incident very clearly because I was also\ninvolved in it. A man came in and he was selling household articles. Since people, most people\ngave up the money because they didn't want to risk, if they are caught for whatever you did against\nthe law, it was punishable by death. And even without any reason they shot and they killed and they\ntortured. But anyhow, so when he came in a lot of people, just for curiosity, came and looked. And\none man walked by, his name was Cal-fus (ph). He was the owner of the building where I went to\nschool. And he walked by too and he came in. And my mother all of a sudden realized that if\nsomebody is going to see us standing and having any business transaction with somebody who 1s\nnot Jewish, and we didn't know whether he was Polish or whether he was German, because there\nwas a lot of , that is somebody who is of German descent but he didn't live\nin Poland. So she said, she was afraid, so she said, \"Please come into my house.\" She invited\neverybody. And Cal-fus (ph) obviously took a risk and he didn't give away all the money. So he\nbought maybe 90 percent of the merchandise. My mother didn't buy anything. We gave up the\nmerchandise, you know? Maybe he hid a little bit because I remember, but before we came to the\nghetto I remember seeing my mother taking out from her corset, you know women were wearing\ncorsets, and it was like a bone, like a plastic bone, she pulled this out and she made rolls of money\nand she stuffed it in so they could hide it on them, so they must have saved some money but maybe\nshe didn't want to spend it or whatever. But anyhow, the Nazis left, I mean the, Cal-fus (ph) left, the\npeople left and this man, who was selling the merchandise. But it didn't take long, this same man\nbrought the Gestapo into our house and denounced my mother. And they asked my mother, \"Who\nis the man who brought the merchandise, because he told us.\" And that is the first time in my life\nthat I heard my mother lie. She said she didn't know. But she did know who he was. He was not a\npersonal friend so we were not very involved with him, but we knew who Cal-fus (ph) is, I knew\nhim very well because, like I said, I went to school there. So after...\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2",
        "A: So, I was telling you of the story about, when this man who sold the household articles that we\ndidn't know brought the Gestapo to our house and they interrogated my mother. They wanted her to\ntell who Cal-fus (ph) was. And, I'm not sure whether I mentioned this, that this was the first time I\nheard my mother lying. That she said she didn't know, she denied it. So after interrogated for quite\na while, they saw that they cannot get out of her anything. They took her away. The Gestapo took\nher away. I was by that time 13 years old, and I saw already the cruelty, what's going on, they\nstarted many destructions, many people were already killed and tortured. So I was afraid to be\nseparated from my mother. So I run after her. And I was determined, no matter what's going to\nhappen, I'm not going to leave her alone. So they kept on chasing me away. And finally, one of\nthem said, \"Take her too.\" And I was almost happy that they took me too because I think that\nwhatever happened, otherwise I won't even know if they take her away, I want to know what's\nhappened to her. And they brought us to the Gestapo, the station, and they separated us. They took\nmy mother in to a separate room. This, I was not an eye-witness, I was an ear-witness. And, what I\nheard, it sounded like they were beating her and she was screaming. The shouts got louder and\nlouder and after a while it was silent. That's when my heart almost stopped too, because as long as\nshe was screaming, I knew that she's still alive. But when it was silent, I had no longer any\nknowledge, whether she's still alive, whether she's conscious. And what seemed to me like an\neternity, I cannot estimate how long it took, but finally the doors swung open. Two Gestapos, each\nholding her under the armpit, dragging her across the floor. And took me in, to be next. And I\nwanted to see whether my mother, I saw she was bleeding, and I wanted to see whether she 1s still\nalive. So I looked at her, while they took me out, took her out, they took me into the same place.\nAnd she didn't say anything, but she gave me a sign not to say anything. And I loved my mother\nbecause she always loved me so much and I knew what kind of a person she was. So I was, when\nthey started to ask me questions I said, \"I don't know it.\" I lied too. Deliberately. And they started\nto beat me and I was screaming, and my mother heard me scream but she didn't say anything. And\nafter I was beaten quite well, they, because we spoke Yiddish at home, and Yiddish is similar to\nGerman, they understood, that they said, \"Gin-nook (ph)\". Enough.\n, which means maybe we don\u2019t know. Maybe we don't know. And\nthat's when they released us. This story begun in 1939, shortly after Germany invaded Poland. I\ndidn't see anymore Cal-fus (ph). I didn't know what's happened to him. At that time, the Nazis used\nall kinds of techniques. They reversed, you see, Hitler's laws were a reversal of all the Jewish laws.\nWe, in Judaism, in home and in Hebrew school, they taught us that we are all responsible for one\nanother. What they did is that if one person did something wrong, they punished us all. Group\npunishment for individual action. So, and ironically, what was legally ours they took away by force\nand we were punished for trying to keep it or to have it. So I didn't know what's happened to the\nCal-fus (ph) family but what we knew, both my mother and I, is that if we would have told they\nwould have killed the whole family, not just the father. And I'm going to stop here because I don't\nwant to lose the end of this story because this story had a tremendous impact on me. And I'm going\nto skip and come back later to 1939. I'm going now to 1981 when I went to the world gathering of\nJewish Holocaust survivors, okay?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And when we came, only Jewish survivors, there was some people before I left that they wanted\nme to be in a documentary, to be a witness in a documentary. And I told them that story. Anyhow,\nwhen we came there, each of us, I'm not going to go into the whole, direct to the story, each of us\ngot a badge and it says, on mine it says, Itka Zygmuntowicz USA. That was all. And as I was\nstanding, this was the last date when we were marched into the courtyard, you know? And\nMenachem Bacon was the President there. And I was overwhelmed with emotion to think from the\ngates of Auschwitz, to come now to the gates of Jerusalem and after so many, more than 2,000\nyears, to have our homeland, and then I understood already what it means to have our homeland,\nthen people cannot tell you, \"The houses are yours but the streets are ours.\" And I was\noverwhelmed. And I was so eager to go to march, and that march as a free person, as a proud Jew,\nbut they asked me not to because they needed me to bear testimony in case I see something or to ask\nquestions. And as the people are marching and I'm standing there, all of a sudden I said to myself,\n\"Can I have a marker or a pen?\" And I wrote on my badge, Fri-mand (ph), Check-hon-off (ph),\nPoland and Auschwitz. I figured in case somebody recognized, you know, walks by, they do not\nrecognize me. I was 13 when the war broke out and now I am an adult. My name has changed.\nWho will know me? And as I stand there, Kentel Vee-che-nya (ph) from Lindstrom, Pennsylvania\n(ph) was bringing the American flag as a gift to Menachem Bacon. And he looked at my badge, he\nsaid, \"You're from Chair-hon-off (ph)?\" And I said, \"Yes, Chair-hon-off (ph).\" And with him\nwalked another man and he said, \"I'm from Chair-hon-off (ph) too.\" And I said, \"Who are you?\"\nAnd he said, \"Cal-hus (ph).\" And I went berserk. I started to cry and to laugh and I was so excited\nand he had the matches, holding the cup, and the people who were interviewing him said, \"Ask him\nfor the address.\" So I asked him for the address and before he gave I said, \"Are you\nthe son or the father?\" Because he looked too young to be the father. He said, \"I'm Cal-hus's (ph)\nson.\" And he gave us a card, he lives in Natan-alia (ph), Israel because after the war he went to\nIsrael, and he married an Israeli-Jewish . And we went there to interview him too. And I\nfound out his father, unfortunately, died in Auschwitz, was murdered in Auschwitz. But he and\nanother brother survived. And both are married and have children and grandchildren. And that's\nwhen I was understood, my grandmother's saying, that you only have what you give away. And\nthat you don\u2019t have to be rich or famous and you can give away , good deed and your\n, and three generations. When I was in 1981, alive because of our sacrifice.\nAnd that's when I learned spiritual resistance, from my mother. And I learned what\nis. What to do with humanness. And now you understand why I was sharing with you\nthe lessons, what my mother said. doesn't depend, and then I'm going back to\n1939, but I felt, I wanted to finish and complete the story so that you will know. Actually, Cal-fus\n(ph) invited us, our family, and there was a tremendous reunion. They took him and made him a\npart of the, you know, the interview. Anyhow, we are back in Chair-hon-off (ph) in 1939. After\nthey took away from us all our freedom, they took away from us all our possessions. In the\nmeantime, my grandmother died. That was before we went to the ghetto. My grandmother was no\nlonger alive. And I was heartbroken because, except for my parents, I have never had as a close\nrelationship with anyone as I had with my parents and with my grandmother. And she had such a\ngreat influence in this, I was heartbroken. But looking back, I am grateful that she did not have to\ngo to what we went through and she died in her own bed and she was buried in Chair-hon-off (ph)\nand is there still. That was already, it was not as open, another kind of funeral that would be\notherwise.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask, in this period where the Synagogue was burned, you weren't allowed to go to\nschool, there were all kinds of restrictions. Did you pray at home? Did you try to continue to. . .?",
        "A: Yes, yes. I still said every, in fact, even today, so many years, I still have the\n, It's like in-bred in me. Because I said it every morning when I was a child.\nAnd then, it just...",
        "Q: Were you able to try to observe holidays and things like that?",
        "A: We couldn't observe holidays anymore because, first of all, Jews were not allowed often to pray\nor to go among the Synagogues. We couldn't make a traditional sha-but (ph), there was no food.\nWe lived in constant fear. And I saw, for instance, I think that I mentioned it, the religious people\nsuffered more because they couldn't often and there was starvation. When you, we\ntried as much as we could. I still knew what day it is and we tried as much as we could to keep the\nsha-but (ph), but that was when we were still living in Chair-hon-off (ph). And I actually didn't say\ngood-bye to any of my relatives. Only, from all the family, from all the members, the only person\non my mother's side that I said good-bye was to my grandmother. Because my mother and I was at\nher bed side when she died. And she was clear, her mind was so clear. And I remember that I was\nterribly upset and my mother said something that also was to be a lesson. She said, \"Yit-cola (ph),\n(she said that in Yiddish, of course, because as I said I spoke Yiddish), death teaches us not to take\nfor granted life.\" And we still had, usually you know, according to tradition, the Jewish burial was\nvery important. But later we couldn't have, people couldn't ultimately go and bury so we still, she\nwas still buried in Chair-hon-off (ph).",
        "Q: You were able to bury her properly?",
        "A: We did, we were able to bury her properly but it was not like a big funeral that she would have\nhad because the children from Warsaw, the children from and all of them, they couldn't\ncome. We just, our family, and the people who were involved. Because from everything, from\nbirth to death, our lives was different than it is now, how it was during the Holocaust. Because, for\ninstance, there was not funeral pyres. There was not, you didn't bury people the same way that is\nhere. And everything was different, on the way the customs were done. Our whole lives changed.\nBefore the Nazis came in, the longest that I ever didn't eat was from one meal to the other. And\nbeing that we have a kosher home and familiar, after meat, eating, you wait six hours. So the\nreligion taught me a lot of discipline too. And later the people who kept kosher could not keep\nkosher, they didn't have food at all. They were starving. So then in the middle of the night. . .",
        "Q: Did you break those rules? Did you eat whatever you could at that point?",
        "A: At that point there was no meat. There was no meat and we tried as much to keep as we could.\nBut eventually when the hunger tool over you no longer could do it anymore because I remember a\nyoung pupil once of a Rabbi, when I was in Chair-hon-off (ph). Somebody was sick so he said that\nyou're allowed, you don't have to fast if you don't feel good because to preserve your health, that\nwas the first obligation. So all the laws, all the rules that applied before into other times that no\nlonger could be applied here. Because here was just one thing, survival.",
        "Q: How long were you able to live in your own home?",
        "A: This is where I'm coming to now. I remember exactly. It was in the middle of the night.\nOctober 15, 1941. We were asleep and we heard, they broke in, the middle of the night. \"All you-\nden rouse.\" All Jews out. And at that point we only, we couldn't, you wake up and you are tired,\noh, the first thing with my mother, grab what she was mostly interested of course, the family should\nget out alive. She took the candlesticks, books, her books. A few books and a couple of bundles\nbecause everybody was constantly having, like a few things, we didn't know from day to day. And\nwe didn't know, where are they taking us? And when I was a child, we use to, I use to play a lot at,\nyou know they have, it was called, a river. I'm trying to, 1s this a river or a lake? Which\nis larger? A lake? A river. A lake is larger, I think, but this was a river. And in this river, we used\nto play as children, I use to go, and there were big trees. In fact, I remember a story when I talk\nabout the river and, I don't know, should I tell it? Which is really, okay. But anyhow, since people\nin this river, people used to bathe and there was like a special, like a place where on sha-but (ph) we\nused to go, they use to call it, you know, to go for a walk. And we would go to the\nriver. And had beautiful moments. And then was a big castle near the river, there was a castle.\nWhen I lived there, it was empty, nobody lived in there. But a beautiful castle. In fact, I was now in\nPoland, it's still there, the castle is still there. I have a photograph of it. So, in the middle of the\nnight, \"All you-den rouse.\" With dogs, rifles, and they chased us out and they took us to the castle\nnear the river. Lee-din-ya (ph) was called the river. And from there they put us on trucks and they\ntook us to the ghetto, Nove\u2019 Mesto, Poland.",
        "Q: Now who was with you at this place? Your entire immediate family?",
        "A: My parents, my little brother and my little sister. That was all. My Aunt and Uncle and their\nchildren, they were the only ones that I saw still in the beginning, but when they chased us out they\nwere not with us. So like I said, the only person that I said good-bye was my grandmother. The rest\nof the family we didn't know because to the other cities we couldn't even go, but them we would see\noccasionally. But when they chased us out, not until after the war I found out that when they chased\nus out they didn't chase out the whole city, they just chased out part. I don't know whether it was\nthe larger or the smaller but the rest they chased out later, so my Aunt must have been, and her\nfamily with them.",
        "Q: Did you have any sense of why you were chosen to go at that point verses another family?",
        "A: I didn't even know that we were, that somebody was left. Because they chased us out in the\nmiddle of the night. We didn't have a chance to talk to anybody. Not until after the war did I find\nthis out.",
        "Q: So they sent you to this other town?",
        "A: They sent us to other town which was called Nove' Mesto, they changed the names, everything\nwas changed. And Nove' Mesto, where previously lived one family, they put in six, seven and eight\nfamilies. And the ghetto, you know, I don't have to explain to you what a ghetto is, we were\nisolated from the whole city. And it was so terribly crowded. And there, where we lived in was a\nfamily, the family which lived there was called Yat-rack (ph), and when we came there the facilities\nwere not much better, like in ours. And so many families with little children, and everybody wanted\nto be able to go to the stove or use the facilities and everything. So, it was already horrible just\nbeing so crowded. And one time, my mother and father said to us, \"Kindle-left (ph) children, get\ntogether the few belongings, we are leaving.\" And I thought to myself, are they loosing, have they\nlost their minds? Where are we leaving? It's a ghetto. We cannot go out. But we were, knew to\nrespect our parents so we obeyed. And we went to a place where was before a storage for grains.\nAnd it was empty, it was a dirt floor and nothing there, just a small window and a door. And my\nparents went, there were many ruins and they got together some bricks and by themselves they built\na little stove. But what they said is still clear and vivid in my mind. They said, \"At least here we'll\nhave, it's enough that the Nazis destroy us from the outside. Here at least we'll have a little bit more\npeace and we'll be together. But 1t won't be because the fighting, the screaming, the children crying.\nSo we'll live there, right here, in this storage room.\" Exactly, and the conditions of the ghetto, I\ndon't think I need to go 1n because its very clear at this point.",
        "Q: Well how bad was it? I mean, there are many kinds of ghettos.",
        "A: Okay. This ghetto, to my knowledge, was not like the Warsaw ghetto where there was physical\nresistance, of fighting. In fact, there was some ghetto, it was not as large a ghetto. What I\nremember is that we were constantly hungry. And my mother tried from the little meal that we had,\nshe tried to make meals and many times what she did, she would take a little of hers, she would give\nto the smaller children because they couldn't endure so much. We wanted the parents, if the parents\nwanted to protect the children, she still was trying to read poetry and to sing songs, she still had the\nbooks, and she says, \"We must, as long as we live, we must go on like a clock. We cannot stop.\nWe have to go on.\" And she tried to teach my little sister who didn't have a chance to go to school,\nso she tries to teach her at home, and to write a little bit. And my brother never had a\nchance to become barmitzvah. I don't know the exact age of them but I know that before, that he\nwas not yet barmitzvah. And barmitzvah was always a very, very important thing for a Jewish\nchild. So we lived in constant, and there was a lot of sicknesses. Because the sanitary, there was no\nmedication, there wasn't a sanitary. A lot of parents died. You saw little orphaned children in the\nstreet begging for food. It was just horrible. Why I don't go in so much detail from the ghetto,\nbecause remember like I said before, that each time we thought it's the worst, something worse\ncame. So after Auschwitz, this was like paradise. And for the main reason, because I still had my\nfamily.",
        "Q: Okay, but then let me ask you a few questions.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Because we know a lot more about some of the larger ghettos, but I don't know too much about\nthis one. Was there an organization within it? Was there a yudden-rot (ph)? Where there Jewish\npolicemen? Or did the Germans patrol the ghetto?",
        "A: The Germans patrolled, I don't know why I don't have so much knowledge of how it was in the\nghetto. Because I know one thing, that most of the time we stayed inside so much. I know there\nwas a lot of sickness. I know that they tried to help, there were people who tried to help each other.\nBut the problem is that everybody was starved. Everybody was hungry. You couldn't go, it's just\nthat sometimes the parents like made sacrifices. They would give a little of their ration to a younger\nchild and the starvation. The kids couldn't anymore go to school. But if they would discover that\nwe teach the children, we could be shot. They didn't want us to be educated. They wanted to\ndestroy everything else. So still, the parents tried to teach and there were groups and we tried, like\nthere was a group and if somebody got sick they tried to help. But the exact conditions that I should\nremember so clearly, I don't remember. I didn't know, I was too young still to know everything.",
        "Q: So you didn't know how it was organized or run?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was there a soup kitchen? Do you remember that?",
        "A: I don't. No, I don't.",
        "Q: It's okay. If you don't mind, ask you a few questions.",
        "A: No, no, you can ask me. But I don't know. I know that, yeah, there must have been a soup\nkitchen because I remember that we used to go to get some food, because we didn't have the food at\nhome. We got rations. But I don't remember exactly how it was organized.",
        "Q: Did people work in the ghetto? Did either of your parents, were they forced to work?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think too much, no.",
        "Q: Okay. Did you play with other children?",
        "A: Yes. In fact, there was one girl that I got to know in the ghetto. We stayed friends. So yes, I did\nhave friends, tried to as much as we could to go on and to talk, but the conditions were so horrible.\nBecause hunger and no place to wash, no place to, if somebody got sick there was no medication.\nSo there was a lot of illnesses, like typhus was a lot, also, going in. Some people died of starvation.\nSome people died, that's what I remember most, is little kids crying a lot and begging. And older\npeople sitting outside because there 1s already a lot of orphans.",
        "Q: Were bodies buried when people died?",
        "A: This I don't know.",
        "Q: Did you, were you able to sort of, you were, was the ghetto fenced in? Were you able to go out\nof it?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, it was fenced in.",
        "Q: But you could wander freely on the streets in the ghetto?",
        "A: In the ghetto, people tried not to wander around too much because they didn't want to, they\nwanted to avoid to be visible. Not to get hit because the Nazis had a tendency to torture, to mock\nus. In fact, for that reason, we tried as much to stay out of sight. I remember that I was mostly\ntrying to be inside, like I felt safer to be inside.",
        "Q: Did the Nazis come into the ghetto? Do you remember seeing people in uniform inside the\nghetto?",
        "A: Yes. But not constantly. I don't know why I have so little recollection of the ghetto. That is not\ntoo much, I was a whole year in the ghetto. It was exactly October 15, 1941. They chased us from\nhome. And the ghetto, the entire ghetto was liquidated on November 17, 1942. About a year later.\nWhat I remember is that when, again in the middle of the night, I don't know why, but when we\nwere chased off it was in the middle of the night. But this time we were told, they got us all\ntogether, and we were told that we're going to be resettled to a family camp where we are going to\nhave better conditions. Where we are going to have food and medications and where the families\nare going to be together and work. And people were happy that we're going to have better medical\nconditions and better food. And then they took us all and they put us in the cattle cars. I still had. .",
        "Q: How did you get this information?",
        "A: From the because I went there too.",
        "Q: No, how did you get the information that you were going to be moved supposedly to these\nfamily camps?",
        "A: Because a Nazi say this.",
        "Q: So they came and they told you that?",
        "A: They told us that we are going to be resettled to a family camp and we are going to have better\nconditions. We're going to have medicine, because a lot of people died because they got sick, they\ndidn't have any medication. And that we're going to have more food, that we're going to have good\nconditions. We're going to work but we're going to have good conditions. And it made sense\nbecause they want us well, that's what we thought. So they are going to feed us better, they are\ngoing to give us medication, and we didn't put any resistance because we didn't know. We believed\nit. I was brought up to trust people, to believe. You know, in my life, my family didn't ever betray\nme. Like I said, the only time I heard my mother lying is this, so I had no reason why not to\nbelieve.",
        "Q: Let me ask you one question. Did your family talk about what was happening or you just got by\nday to day?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t hear much discussion, I don't know whether my parents wanted to shield us. Believe it\nor not, in the worst conditions, they were telling us stories, they were teaching us...\n[end of side | of tape 2]",
        "Q: So you and your family were put on cattle cars?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Tell me about the trip, the journey.",
        "A: Oh that was a time I will never forget. They closed, they closed, we were put in the cattle cars,\nthey pushed in, it was so tight that you hardly had place to sit down. There was nothing to sit on.\nAnd there was no place to relieve yourself. They locked us in with just a small window that you\nlooked out, and they locked us, you know, hermetically sealed cattle trains. And when the journey\nbegun, there was so many people packed in this here, and we traveled with this here, the train, from\nNovember 17, 1942, when we arrived in Auschwitz was November 22, 1942. So five days, right?",
        "Q: What was happening in the cars?",
        "A: What was happening in the cars? It was hot. We were hungry. We were thirsty. People were\ncrying. People were praying. People were screaming, going crazy. We had no choice, we had to\nrelieve ourselves in front of other people. Starvation. Fear. Where are we going? How long are\nwe going to go? Where they are taking us? They promised better conditions, when is it going to\nbe? And I remember parents tried to comfort, when we arrive there things are going to get better.\nAnd in the meantime, people were fainting. People got sick. It was just a living Hell.",
        "Q: As a young girl do you remember what was going on in your mind, what you were thinking\nabout?",
        "A: What was going on, I was clinging to my parents. And I was wondering, what's going to\nhappen? And I was crying because I saw my little brother and sister so hungry and I had nothing to\ngive them. The parents wanted to protect us, we want to protect the parents. And we saw older\npeople, we were always told by my parents and my grandmother, may she rest in peace, that we\nalways help those who are less fortunate but here we were all less fortunate. And the worst thing\nwas that we couldn't help each other too much. We were all in the same condition. There was no\nrelief, no relief. And just, I kept on thinking about, I wanted to turn my mind off so I was trying to\nthink of stories but the hunger took over. We were sleepy, there was no place to lay down. It was\nthe most horrible journey. It was a horrible journey. And then, after five days like this, the stench,\nthe tiredness, you know? The Holocaust for me, it was not,\nwas nothing to compare to what we suffered. But the worst suffering was that we, I\nsaw the people I loved and I couldn't help them, and they couldn't help us. We lost control of our\nlives. And that was even before we came to Auschwitz. And when we arrived, this train stopped all\nof a sudden, the door flung open, people who looked very strange to us in striped gray and blue\nstripes, wearing, with hats, . And then the Gestapo came and said, \"All rouse, schnell,\nschnell, schnell.\" Always schnell, always rouse. And they told us to leave everything, to leave our\nbundles there. We didn't have too much to begin with. And everything went so fast. And then the\nGestapo were chasing us and I remember I saw a gate. It said All-might-muck-fry (ph). All-might-\nmuck-fry (ph) means work makes you free. But as I found out later, the only dead was only when\nthey liberate us. Only a few survived. When we came they started to make selections. And\nMengelia, at that time I didn't know that this is Mengelia, some very well fed, good looking Nazis,\nwith the Nazis uniforms, with the swastika, stood so, they were, you couldn't tell from their faces\nanything. Expression was like mocking and everything. And later I found out that the one who\nmade the selection when we were there was Mengelia. And they started to separate male from\nfemales and make selection. To the right and to the left. I had no idea. And all of a sudden, when\nwe came there facing the gate where it said All-might-muck-fry (ph), this is the gate. On the right-\nhand side, which would be the left, but on my side facing, was a Red Cross truck with a sign, Red\nCross. And I remember I pointed it out to my parents. I said, \"See, they kept their promise. The\nRed Cross stands for help.\" And then they said, they started to tear apart the families. Separate the\nfamilies. Pulled out children from the hands of their parents. Little infants away from the mother.\nAnd they started to make the selection. To the left and to the right. Immediately they took away\nmy father. My father was a young man, maybe early 40's or 40 or so. And they took away my little\nbrother and sister. My mother and I they put together in the line, we were selected to go each. And\nat that point...",
        "Q: How old were your brother and sister at that time?",
        "A: I don't know their exact age, they were younger than I but I just go by because I know that my\nlittle sister, when the Nazis came in she hadn't start yet school. And my brother wasn't yet\nbarmitzvah, so I don't know their exact age. It was, at home we didn't celebrate birthdays like here\nbecause for the Jewish people didn't, some people didn't want to say their age because they believe\nin the evil eye and things like this. I don't know, superstitious. But anyhow, they were still young.\nSo when they took them away, my mother was with me, and everything went so fast that I didn't\neven have time to think. And then my mother turned to me and she said, \"Yit-cola (ph), you\u2019re a\nbig girl. I have to go with the little children. But remember my child, no matter what's going to\nhappen to you, don't become hateful and bitter. Don't let them destroy you.\" That was her last\nwords. And all of a sudden I was all alone. And that's it, everything that I had, everything, because\nI was became dead. And I didn't even have a chance to say good-bye because I didn't know that we\nare parting forever. I didn't know about gas chambers, nothing. My personal experience, nothing\ncan historically, I never knew about gas chambers. When you saw that we were deceived.\nDeceived, we didn't know. So then they lined us up and we were taken into the, a different way.\nAnd they left for the barracks. And they took them away. I didn't know at that time where, I had no\nidea. Now when I know what's happened, but I mean, at the time when they took us away we didn't\nknow. And they took away all older people, young children, pregnant woman. So I talk to myself, I\nremember it today, look how kind they are because we were told that we were all going to be\ntogether. So we thought that they give them a ride, which I appreciated very much. I figured the\nlittle children, but I had no idea that we are parted forever. Who could know that doctors who were\ntrained to say the Hippocratic oath, that are trained to heal the sick are going to kill their health. In\nfact, I wrote a poem about Mengelia. Would you like me to say it?",
        "Q: I think I'd like you to continue now and then we'll see if you feel like reading it later.",
        "A: Yes. Anyhow, when they took us away all of a sudden they brought us into a place and we were,\nthey shaved, first of all they made their number. We had to give up everything. I remember I was\nclutching a little picture, a photograph of my family, and I had to give it up. At first I didn't want to\nso they started to beat me so I figured its not worth it to, you know? I knew that I'm not going to be\nable to keep it so I gave it up. And we had to...",
        "Q: What is your number?",
        "A: My number?",
        "Q: They gave you a number?",
        "A: Yes. 2-5-6-7-3. Not everyone got numbers. The ones who they took away to the gas chambers,\nthey didn't get numbers. And also, I don't know whether you are aware, Auschwitz was Auschwitz\nI, II. I was taken to Birkenau and Birkenau was where the gas chambers were, all the gas chambers.",
        "Q: Were your brother and sister still with you at this point?",
        "A: When they took away...",
        "Q: When they took you into the shaved and tattooing .. .",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no. They immediately had the selections. Mangelia sent them to the trucks. And I\nremember they were holding hands, you know, my little brother and sister. My brother was\nprotecting my little sister, they took them away. And then my mother saw them going away. I don't\nknow how much she know, what she knew, but again her , she made a fatal choice and\nshe went with the children. She said she cannot leave them alone, you are a big girl. So that was\nthe last time I ever saw them. The whole family for four generations. And I had no idea where my\nAunt, who lived in Warsaw, she was married with children, my Aunt in the . Another\n, all the relatives. I never said good-bye, I don't know what's happened to them.\nWhether my Aunt in Warsaw died in the Warsaw ghetto, whether she was, this we will never know.\nWe don't even have, you understand why this story of Buncho (ph) the Silent, I was thinking.\nBecause, I don't know whether it was just coincidental that this story had such an effect on me and\nwhy I remembered because Buncho (ph) the Silent in the story was 13 years old, when the step-\nmother came. And also I was many times thinking that we live for so long, since about the 1600\ncentury my ancestors came to Poland. And yet, we had to leave everything. Everything that was\nours they inherited, they took away everything. Nothing was ours. And, you know? And then\nwhen we came there, they shaved our heads, everybody had shaved heads. The guys, it was done\ntoo. And then we were the fortunate ones, at that time we didn't know because good and bad\nfortune can only be understood in retrospect. So I didn't realize that I was still lucky, that I got the\nnumber. At least I'm alive with the number. And then we really got a bath, we didn't get gassed,\nbut obviously, or I wouldn't be here to tell you this. But we got a bath, which we welcomed because\na shower was, you know? And then we went out for, a whole full of the floor was laying uniforms.\nAnd they were striped, the same thing as we saw with the ones who came to the train. And, not\nfrom the Nazis, this was also hefflinger (ph), which means Jewish people who were interred there.\nAnd then they gave us those uniforms and they took away our shoes. Everything was taken. Our\nclothes, our shoes, our hair, our name. Everything. And all of a sudden, I realized that to them I\nwas just a number. And I remember that at the time, when they called, you know they never called\nus by name but number, in order to dehumanize us, that we should give in and give up. They\nalways would call my number, which was 2-5-6-7-3 [in German], and whenever they say that I\nalways would say under my breath, \"Yit-cola (ph)\". Because I thought to myself, how can I be a\nnumber? I can feel, I can think, I can laugh. Of course I didn't have freedom but I had freedom of\nmind, freedom of thoughts. And so I, this was my spiritual form of resistance. That I refused to see\nmyself through their minds. And after they gave us the, instead of my shoes, which was a nice pair\nof shoes too, they gave us wooden clogs. And mine, unfortunately, were not matching. And we got\nan enamel bowl. And this was all our worldly possessions. In one day our entire past was wiped\nout. And we had no future. We didn't know it then yet. I didn't know about gas chambers yet. And\nthey marched us into a barrack.",
        "Q: Let me ask you one question here. Was there anyone in this group you knew from before? Did\nyou know some people from your town?",
        "A: Sure. We came with people from our town who were in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Did any of the older people try to protect you because your mother wasn't with you?",
        "A: The older people didn't come in with me.",
        "Q: Well, older meaning three years older, or?",
        "A: In the ghetto, I mean, in the concentration camp there was pretty much solidarity. However, I\nhad one bad experience. And I'll come to it. So when they gave us, and we always had to march to\nline up, never, since I came in on November 22, 1942, until Auschwitz was resolved, until January\n18, 1945, I had no longer freedom. No freedom. We were, everything, because from the morning\nwe woke up, we came in the barrack, it was a real big, long barracks. And was three\nlayer bunk beds. And crowded on the bunk beds with one blanket. And they were so low that you\ncouldn't sit up. We couldn't sit up. The same clothes, the shift that we got, with this I slept. There\nwas no night clothes. From 1942 to 1945 I never brushed my teeth. I never saw myself in a mirror.\nNobody ever embraced me. Nobody ever said, after having so much love. So when I'm looking\nback from an environment where I was free like a bird, to come to a place where I felt like in a cage.\nAnd you know, you can put a bird in a cage but you cannot deprive them of their desire to fly. They\ntook away my freedom but they couldn't take away my desire to be free. They took away my loved\nones but they could not take away my desire to live. And I guess there were many horrible things\nbut probably the most horrible was losing everyone I loved. And not only experiencing my own\nsuffering, but witnessing the suffering of others and have to be silent like Buncho (ph) the Silent.\nAnd I couldn't say anything. And in the barracks, where I could say something when the Nazis\nwere not there at night, it was like the Tower of Babel. Because everyone spoke a different\nlanguage. And we were too tired, too grieved in the beginning. So when we came in, so many\npeople were crowded in this barrack. And all of a sudden, from a happy sheltered loving home to\nbe thrown into an environment like this. And everybody was suffering. My first concern was,\nwhen is our family going to come? But I still was natve enough to believe what the Nazis told us,\nthat we are going to get united. So I'm waiting. And I don't see them. So I start asking questions.\nAnd there is a conspiracy almost like, so silent. Whether they didn't want to tell us because they\ndidn't want to break my heart, or whether they were not allowed to? This I don't know, but whoever\nI asked nobody answered anything. They didn't say yes or no, nothing. Finally, after constantly\nbadgering and repeating, one of the girls said, \"You might as well tell her. We are all here\ncondemned to die.\" And she points at the smoke and she said, \"You see that chimney? This is\nwhere your parents are.\" And tells me the story about the gas chambers. She said, \"This is where\nwe're all going to be.\" Remember I related a story, it was when I was a child, I went to the funeral,\nmy parents took me to the funeral and they told me that, to take your own life is a sin. It's like\nspitting God and your parents in their face because they gave you a gift and its against the Jewish\nlaw. So I did not for once think about committing suicide. But at that moment, if I would have\nbeen able to die when I found this out, that's how horrible my grief was. And I just was ready to\ngive up. I was not trying to think about committing suicide, but I became oblivious. I didn't care\nwhat's happening. And anyhow...",
        "Q: Can I ask you a question here?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How long do you think you were there before you realized this? Or before you were told this?",
        "A: I didn't know the first day.",
        "Q: Was it a few months?",
        "A: No, no, not months. It was in a few days. The exact day I don't know. Not very long, not very\nlong. Because I was constantly asking and badgering the girls. And I'm going to go in later to\ndescribe what a day in Auschwitz was, but for now, they gave us the ration bread and I felt like, its\nlike a funeral for me. I lost everybody. So I didn't, couldn't, I was starved but I couldn't eat. So I\ntook the bread and left it. In the morning my bread was gone. And one of the girls there, I don't\nremember her last name any longer, Esther I know was her first name, she was from Chair-ta-hoff\n(ph) and she actually came from a prison. I don't know whether the prison was during the war\nbecause from what I know she was not a criminal, so maybe she, the Nazi laws were different than\nour laws. For keeping on, for wanting to practice our religion, for wanting to live. To\nkill you was legal. But to save a Jewish child or a Jewish adult was illegal and punishable by death.\nTo survive was to them, everything that was our they have taken away, if we would try to keep\nsomething, we were treated like criminals. So anyhow, in the morning Esther says to me, \"Oh poo\nYit-ka (ph), somebody stole your bread.\" And I said, \"My gosh, what place is this? Stealing\nsomebody's piece of bread.\" And when I got the next day my bread, I couldn't eat again. Even\nthough I was, like my throat was locked. And I left the bread. In the night for some reason we slept\nso many people on one bunk, so if one had to turn, so we slept on our sides like sardines, the other,\nwe had to wake the others, so somebody woke up. And as I wake up, the girl, Esther, who pitied me\nwas eating my bread. And that was almost like the last straw for me. And at that point I just didn't\ncare what's happening. And I was sitting and crying. And I didn't know it at the time, in Auschwitz\nif you didn't get up for the or the counting, if you didn't obey the law for anything, you\nwould right away be killed, taken to the gas chambers. So a girl walks over and she ask me, \"Why\nare you crying?\" And I didn't care at all, I was so, so heartbroken, that I just started crying. I just\ndidn't even want to answer. Finally she, it was something in her voice, that I felt that like she's\ncaring, which I started to understand and I remembered what my grandmother use to say, \"Yes my\nchild, but kindness and caring cannot be little things.\" Like when I did the . And\nwhat's happened\u2019? And finally I tell her. And she said, she thought that I cried because of the bread,\nI cried of the whole situation, of losing the family and everything. So she took a piece of her bread\nand she broke it off and she said, \"Take it.\" And I didn't want to take it. Because I already knew\nthat we are all there to be killed, that it's just a matter of trme. So I figured I cannot afford to get\ninvolved with anybody, to care for someone, to have a relationship, because in case one of us goes,\nthere's going to be additional pain, to protect myself from the pain. But there was something in her\nvoice and her face and everything. Her name is Benack (ph), at the time, was Binna Gold-cut (ph),\nYanka Gold-cut (ph), because she use to call herself Yanka. And finally I took the bread and I said,\n\"No, I cannot alone, no matter how long I'm going to live, alone. It's not even worth living. I'm all\nalone.\" I took the bread and Binna became my dearest friend. And from that day on, she became\nlike my sister. We cared for each other. We cared deeply for each other and we helped each other.\nIn Auschwitz, a piece of bread meant life. Meant winning in the game of survival. So I just felt that\nshe was so kind, that she was able to break up, and the contrast. Here, Esther stole my piece of\nbread. And this girl gave away a piece of bread. I didn't even know until this day, I don't know\nwhen she came, I didn't know at that time anything. Now I know that she was born in Warsaw, but\nI didn't know. At that time we didn't think of it. And I took the bread and with it something in my\nspirit started to soar again and we made a commitment, Binna and I. We didn't know if we were\ngoing to get out of there, but to live or to die with , with humanness. Not to lose\nour dignity. And this is important to know, that in Auschwitz there were two kinds of laws. If\nsomebody was hungry and while they were carrying the cauldron with soup, people would lift up\nthe lid and put in their bowl and grab and run. If they were lucky they could run away. If they\ncaught them, they would get 25 on their bare behind. And sometimes even worse. But one inmate\nfrom the other, that was a no law. Would not take, because we know this meant survival. And from\n1942 to 1945 I was in Auschwitz, nobody ever stole from me anything. You know? And we felt\nlike we had no freedom at all. No freedom of movement, only in our soul and our mind could we\nbe free. And just to feel that I had some kind of choices yet to make. We use to switch, you know,\nlike to share. I would give Binna a little bit of my soup and she would give me a piece of bread, or\nvis-a-versa. One day when she had the . And even sisters and mothers, sometimes, if\nthey were lucky to be together, they kept separate the plate, everybody would, they would measure\nwhen they divided. You shouldn't be a hair bigger than the other because the starvation was so\ngreat. Binna and I trusted each other and we kept together our bread. We didn't keep it separate and\nshe never betrayed me, or vice-a-versa. And somehow knowing, she became the, next to my\nfamily, she became the friend that I kept with. When other friends in concentration, but Binna and I\nwere more like friends, under such circumstances. And when the day that they usually begun, when\nthe whistle would blow, get up. And we would always, it was still dark. I didn't have a clock\nbecause as I said, my only worldly possession was the shift, the wooden clog and the bowl.\nNothing else. So I didn't have a watch, I didn\u2019t know what day it is, I didn't have a calendar. We\ndidn't have anything. People say, did you have this? So that's why I'm pointing out, I didn\u2019t have\nmore than this...\nEnd of Tape 2.\nTape 3",
        "Q: You were beginning to tell me what an average day or a typical day in Auschwitz was like for\nyou.",
        "A: We didn't wake up by the clock. We woke up, until this day I don't know what time, I know it\nwas still dark. We would wake up and didn't have to dress because I slept in the shift, the same shift\nthat we wore during the day. We didn't have any extra clothes. This was all that we had. And there\nwas water but we were told that this is not good drinking water. So water was very scarce. We\ndidn't have, we couldn't go to the bathroom when we wanted. It was like a collective bathroom, like\nthe latrines you know? And it was just a wooden board and in it like cut out a piece. So we couldn't\ngo where we wanted and this was a terrible thing because certain people, sometimes out of, there\nwas such a terrible thirst or a hunger, that sometimes they would eat things that they shouldn't eat, or\ndrink. And therefore they got diarrhea. And because the conditions, we couldn't wash up. We\ndidn't have anywhere to wash. So it wasn't clean. And once you got the diarrhea, that was the end\nof you, because when you have diarrhea you have to run a lot and they wouldn't let you go and\nwork. And if you soiled yourself, then when they made the selections, then you would go now. So\nit was important. And in order to feel a sense of freedom, since we couldn't wash, I could go\nthrough the movements of pretending that I'm washing myself, just to have some, to feel some\nfreedom. So when I got up in the morning, it was dark and in the summer it was hot, winter was\ncold, and out of habit I was still saying the , | would still say the prayers, even in\nAuschwitz. And we would start, go to the where we are counted. Alive or dead, we had\nto be . And they used the matter that one was responsible for all. So if one person\nwould not be found because he's sick or wouldn't come out, or whatever, we all had to stand no\nmatter how long. Rain, in the biggest rain and the frost without a coat, without anything. If we\ndidn't have, and we would stay, freeze. So we used to try to warm each other, one in the back, you\nknow somebody would stand, you stay in the front and somebody in the back and embrace each\nother. And one day we couldn't do it ultimately because the Nazis, they counted. And sometimes\nwe would be lucky, that everybody was accounted for. Other times we would stay for hours. And\nthen they would give us something, even though we didn't have enough of it and we wish we would\nhave had more, but its suppose to be coffee, it resembled muddy water. A little beet. A piece of\nbread. Some kind of smelly cheese, its like Limburger cheese, it was smelly. But we didn't get\nenough of it. We were grateful that we had this here because we were so hungry that we would eat\nanything almost. In fact we had to restrain ourselves, sometimes not to eat things which could harm\nus. And in the winter, because there was lack of water and no place to wash, we would pick up the\nsnow. And if a Nazi would see us or the one who was watching us, we would get beaten for that.\nThey tried to torture us. And then after we got our ration, we had to line up, and I can still hear,\n\"Links.\" Line up and go march. And on both sides big, long lines with the prisoners marching,\nwith the inmates marching. And I don't know how to call ourselves because when they talk about\nslavery in Egypt or was not as bad as what we had, yet they don't call them slaves. So\nprisoners, I don't know what, but I feel we were worse than slaves because slaves are not\ncondemned to die, you know? Not that way, they used them for something. And we started to walk\nand on both sides were guards and the Nazis with the dogs, that went with us to work. And then we\nhad to go through the gates, and at the gates many times was a dren-dall (ph), they would take out\nsomebody who didn't walk too good or didn't look to good. Other times we were just called, 1-2-3,\n5-6-7, the 8\" out, sometimes the 10\" out, we never know. So you could not plan from one second\nto the other because you don\u2019t know whether you come back, would you be alive the next day.\nThat's when I realized how a person was condemned to death, you know, who has a family illness\nmust feel. And I found out pretty soon that it was more dangerous to walk on the outside line so we\ntried to be in the inside line and not to be the very first or the very last. The less visible you could\nmake yourself. And we marched. When I came I was assigned to Block 8 and a Turkish woman\nwas our Block Elster (ph). A Block Elster (ph) had a little more privileges than the others, she\ndidn't have to go out to work but she was responsible. And then we went out to work and I cannot\nestimate how long of time or how many miles because I had no way of measuring, but I know we\nworked snow, winter, sunshine, it didn't matter. And then we came to work. And we always\nworked outside the camp. And, outer-commando (ph) it was called, when you worked outside,\nouter-commando (ph). And what I started to realize is that the work we were doing at that time was\nnot usual work. We would take stones or gravel and carry it from place to place and the Nazis used\nto mock us. And point to the gas chambers and they said, \"See? That's where\nyou're all going to come out.\" And then he said, \"Where is your God now?\" And that's when I\nremembered what my mother told me, when I had to go to the root cellar. \"Go, Yit-cola (ph), go.\nGod 1s in the root cellar too.\" And I said to myself, \"Go, Yit-cola (ph), go. You\u2019re the last one of\nyour family. If you don\u2019t survive, the world will not know and it will be the last. It's like your\nfamily will not have existed. Go. God is here too. But man is not here.\n[humanness] is not here.\" And I started to understand what means, why my\nparents stressed it so much. And I never for once felt like God has failed me. I felt the people failed\nme. Because God gives men choices to do good or evil. But they have chosen and they were the\neducated people. My family always stressed education. . In fact, my family used to\nsay that is the highest form of religion, science and achievement. And in\nAuschwitz, I had a chance to find out that this was true. Because Mengelia has doctoral degrees.\nAnd he's responsible for the death of 400,000 people including my own family. So I did not doubt\nGod. In spite of what was happening, that I still pray to God and I still believed in God and I\nremembered other things, which I didn\u2019t mentioned this story and I think I will now because I\nthought of that story often. You know, for Passover and Rash-sha-shona (ph) every year, regardless\nof how poor you were, or rich, people would get new clothes. It didn't matter whether you had a lot.\nAnd most, and there was not big department stores like this here, so mostly we would go to the\ndressmaker to make a dress. That particular summer, I was like in my pre-teens, and I remember\nmy mother ordered for me navy blue . And the dressmaker made me a dress, a two-\npiece dress, a sailor dress, a pleated skirt with the collar like this. And when we went to try on first\nthe measurements and everything. And then when the dress was ready I would try it on again and\nlook in the mirror and it fit well. And I felt so proud, so happy with this dress. The sailor dress.\nAnd I came home and it was early Passover, before Passover. So, like a child, I wanted to put on\nthe dress and to show my girlfriends what a pretty dress, I was so proud of it. And when I was\ngoing to put on the dress, my mother said to me, \"Yit-cola (ph), please don't put on the dress now.\"\nI said, \"Oh Mom, it's gonna...\" She said, \"It might get tore and it might get stains and then you\nwon't have it for Passover.\" And I said, \"Oh Mom, its going to be okay.\" So I remember my\nmother said to me, \"Yit-cola (ph), please. Don't take chances on something you can't afford to\nlose.\" But as a child I started to nudge, oh please and please and please. So finally my mother said,\nshe says, \"Well, you learn about responsibility. That's the only way you\u2019re going to learn.\" And I\npromised I won't, I'll be careful. And I had every intentions of doing it, 1t was not out of mischief or\nnot caring. And I put on the dress and I came out. And I was very, a combination. In one way I\ncould be very serious and I was very playful and a little tomboy and I remember I mentioned to you\nthat we had the , the river. And we use to go there, it had beautiful trees. And the kids\ncame and somebody challenged, they said, \"Who can climb up highest on the tree?\" And I was\npretty good at that, you know? I was never heavy, which actually in Poland that was not looked at\nfavorably. They use to say that she has consumption if you were thin. People were more, so\nanyhow, in no time I climbed up this tree, the tree, and I was, I dissed the person who was\nchallenging me. And all of a sudden I hear somebody say, \"Yit-cola (ph), Yit-cola (ph) your mother\nis coming.\" And I got scared and I remembered, my gosh, I'm wearing the good dress. And I went\nto get off the tree fast and the skirt, the pleated skirt got caught in a branch and I tore the skirt. I\ncame down. My mother wasn't even there, it was just a prank they played on me. And I was in\ntears. And I said, \"My God. My mother begged me not to take chances. Not to take a chance to\nlose something and now my dress is torn.\" And I remember like today, I took the pleats and I\nfolded it over so it wouldn't show my flesh, because it was a big tear. And when I came into the\nhouse with tears in my eyes, my mother looked at me, she didn't have to ask much. All she said,\n\"Take of the skirt.\" Because she saw the way I held it with tears in my eyes, so she put two and two\ntogether. \"And I'll fix it for you.\" But she said, \"Remember one thing. It's up to you. You can\nwear your old dress or the dress that I'll fix for you. But you\u2019re going to go to services.\" I was\ncrying my eyes out because I didn't want to wear my old dress and I didn't want everybody to see\nthat, what I did with this dress. But I remembered the lesson. Because my father always pointed\nout, in everything there is a lesson. In every experience. And what I remembered from that lesson\nis not to take chances with something I cannot afford to lose. And this was for me a terrific lesson\nbecause I knew one thing I cannot afford in Auschwitz, is to lose my life. So what I tried to do,\nmany think rather than to take chances like grabbing a little soup, you know, although I was starved,\nI said no. I don't want to take chances because if they catch me they can kill me or beat me up so\nbadly and if I cannot work they'll take me away. And I started to realize there how important it is,\nthe upbringing, the influences that I had and the lessons I had. And mostly I saw, you see before the\nHolocaust I had no frame of reference with which to compare the things, the values, and the things\nor the blessings that I had. And then I had a chance to see what it is to be without a family, without\na Jewish community, without the , we were always Jewish there, but we were not,\nJewish people were not the only people who were in Auschwitz. There were Gypsies, there were\nJehovah Witness, there were the Polish people, they were from all countries. However, the Jewish,\nwe, the Jewish girls, we were not together with the men in the same camp. The Polish girls were\nnot together in the same barracks with us. We were separated. So in all the years that I was there, I\nnever had any contact with a man. I'm not talking in a sexual way, but I mean even to be friends or\nto be in the company of men. And here, this is my teen-age years. The price of going to ;\nthe price of higher education that I was dreaming, to get a good, formal education. The price of all\nthe things, of liberty, which I started to realize how important freedom is. Our liberty. And this is\nwhen, when I felt all this here, then I felt, oh I wish I had a pencil and paper so I could write down\nhow I feel. But I didn't have. And at that time, I wrote in my head to past time, to forget, to run\naway from the harsh reality. So I remembered that I wrote a poem in my mind and it was what I felt\nand it was, I feel like a bird with clipped wings, tied to this earth by invisible strings, chained to a\ndestiny I did not chose, I feel like a prisoner that cannot break loose, I look at the sky with a heavy\nsigh, but my wings have been clipped and I no longer can fly. And I was looking out and seeing the\nphysical surroundings. Around us was the barbed wires, the watch towers, the crematories. The\nsmoke constantly above our heads and beneath us was mud. There was so much mud there that\nwhen we wore those wooden clogs, sometimes they got stuck in the mud and the feet got wet and\non cold, winter days they, for a long time you couldn't even take them off, if the feet got frozen, the\nbite, frost bite, and then after a day like this of suffering and on the job they would mock\nus, they would beat us. We could not, we were not allowed to help each other. And the useless\nwords. And I was thinking to myself, my gosh, if this 1s, if this is our , | don\u2019t even have\nthe word to express it, its like a different planet. It's in the same world like a different planet, a\nplanet of destruction, of death. The dead were not buried and was mountains, everything was\nmountains. Mountains of dead bodies until they buried them. And constant living under the fear of\nmaybe today they are going to take you away, and if you got sick you had no luck, there was no\nmedication. Everything that they promised was not. And once I found out what they do with the\npeople who come, that they take away, and I heard music playing. And I asked somebody, \"Where\nis the music?\" And that's when I found out that they have a live orchestra playing. When the\ntransport was coming and they made selections, sending away people to the gas chamber, the music\nwas playing. Classical music. And later, when I heard the music, I always started to cry because I\nknew that my people are burning, the music is playing. And you know, even after the Holocaust I\nalways loved music and singing, but for a long time whenever I start to hear music, I started to cry\nbecause the visions of the little children, of everything separated and how they tore apart. And then,\nafter a long day, again, walking through the gate, the selections. Some people got beaten to death.\nOther people from working were injured, some people got sick. And every day there became lesser\nand lesser of us. And the bodies, more skeletal. And we didn't, couldn't take a shower or anything\nand we started to accumulate lice. So a big treat was when we could take off that dress and try to\nto expose of the lice. And people with diarrhea, and it was just Dante's Inferno is a\ncomedy comparing to what it was. That's what I say because you ask me, did I, it's impossible to\ndescribe everything. So we came back tired, frozen, cold, over heated from the heat in the whole\nday, we came back, again the appeal (ph), say appeal (ph) and check there, there to alive, we are\nthere. And then we had to wait, after they count again they give us a little soup, a little bread. It\nwasn't enough to live and not enough to die. And many people, many, constantly people died. And\nseeing, here you was with somebody, a few minutes later they were gone. And constantly new\ntransports, and you couldn't speak. So, and the filth, the starvation, the loneliness. Like I started\nbefore to tell you, 1s all this time not seeing yourself in a mirror, not having a toothbrush. They tried\nto dehumanize us to the point where we didn't even, I'm embarrassed to talk about it, but when I\nremember what my parents taught me, that my does not depend on how other treat\nme but how I treat others, than I'm not ashamed because I haven't done anything to deserve it. We\ndidn't even have a piece of toilet tissue. All the time I was in Auschwitz, I couldn't have a piece of\ntoilet tissue. This is how they deprived us. Not a spoon, not a fork, nothing. You know, they tried\nto reduce us to be like non-humans. And the mocking constantly and everything. So again, each\nday the same thing, over and over, starting the and just hanging on another day. Just if you\ncould get through the day, not get beaten, not go to the gas chamber, go through the day and come\nhome together with Binna, that's . And many times, people would go in the evening\nand somebody would say, \"Listen, I'm going to give you a little of my soup. You want to give me a\npiece of your bread?\" Some people preferred the, a little soup to the bread. And the starvation.\nAnd then the Nazis would come and they would say that they are going to give us extra bread, who\nwants to have extra bread? And I learned very quickly, whenever they called for volunteers for\nsomething, I never wanted to volunteer. I felt, others suffered but I don\u2019t want to get involved to do\nsomething which wouldn't be , you know? And what I found out one time, they took,\nthey made a selection. They gave, it was true, they did give this time a little more bread, but they\ntook away the girls and not until after the war, one who was taken away and survived, I found out\nthat they took them for experiments. And they, the doctors experimented without anesthesia. You\nknow, they castrated some men and some women, the operations, so they could never bear children\nanymore. And some people, one woman, she 1s already dead now, but a few years ago she was still\nalive, I don't know what they did to her but hair was growing on her face so she had to go Electro-\nsomething, I forget how this is called, they had to take it off from her face. Hair grew like a man,\nyou know? And different things. There were plenty, I know certain people who I personally know\nwho got married but never could have children because of those experiments. And some got sick.\nBut the majority died, they didn't survive this here. Yes, and another thing. There was a\n, you know? So, and they sometimes Mengelia or other doctors would come and\nwe had to strip and, which is . He would look us over and those who looked already\nskinny or they are too sick or, away to, but at that point, away to the gas chambers. There was a\nblock where they would send away, and sometimes they didn't have enough time to get them out, so\nthey would put them, put them in this block and they no longer gave them food or anything. And\nthen they take them away. If you got sick, it was tough luck. Then you were a goner. Until this\nday, I cannot, I'm thinking and I'm amazed myself that I didn't, wasn't able to be clean there. I didn't\nhave medications, a few times I got sick. Not like real serious. Without an aspirin, without\nmedication, everything else. And yet to survive. And then constantly transports. And then was one\nday, we were called , they asked us to stay longer and there was a girl and her name was\n, something with a \"Z\" begins, I forget her last name, Zit-a-emir (ph), something\nlike this here. I didn't know her personally but I knew of her. She was a messenger, you know\u2019?\nAnd I don\u2019t know the exact story because I don't, I'm not, I was not a witness when she run away, I\ndidn't see her run away. But I know that one day we were all called together and we were, they\nprepared a gallow and they were going to hang her because she run away and they brought her back,\nthey found her. And she, when they found her, I don't know from where because in Auschwitz I\ncouldn't get anything more than what I got, the bowl and the clothes. She had a razor someplace\nhidden. And before they hang her, she cut her wrists in my prescence. Then there was another\nhanging. This hanging I did not witness because Rosa Loberta (ph), my , the beautiful\nRosa, this story I just know from my , the few to have survived. That she was also\nhanged in Auschwitz because she wasn't dead and they destroyed one of the crematortums. And\nwhen the Nazis started to lose the war, of course I didn't know about it because we had no outside\ncommunication. Completely cut off. That's why I say, its in this world but a planet like a different\nworld because we were isolated completely. They started to speed up the gassing and they wanted\nto destroy everybody because even though he 1s losing the war but he still was carrying on with the\nplan of destroying the Jewish people. So the girls made to destroy the gas chambers. And anyhow,\nthere is somebody who's name is Noy-ia Zub-o-dal-vich (ph), he lives in Israel. And he was able,\nbecause they kept him in solitary, and they tortured her. And from him I know this story. That they\nhang her. And before they hand her, she said, \"Ha-zak viv-lots (ph)\", the strong and brave. And\nwhat they wanted from her is that she should denounce, they interrogated her too and they wanted\nher that she should tell who the others were. The resistance, you know, she was involved with other\npeople. She, from the story that I've heard, that she was smuggling pieces of ammunition or\nsomething, but as I said, I'm not a witness to that but I heard. So there was resistance but very, not\nspeaking for the Warsaw ghetto we know that resistance, but this I'm not going to speak because I\nwasn't in those ghettos, I wasn't there. But the very fact, to want it to go on knowing that nobody is\nleft anymore. There is no place to go back or anything. So surviving, and we didn't know how\nothers, what's going on, what are they doing with the war or anything. But I kept constantly asking\nmyself, the German people at that time were the most educated people and yet they did the most\nhorrible things. A doctor who takes the Hippocratic oath to heal sick people is murdering healthy?\nAnd everything, it seemed to me like ironical. The youngster he considered too young to live and\nthe old were too old to live and the teen-agers, from teen-age years to older a little bit, they were just\nright to go to Hell and live and to suffer and to die there. So it was extremely, constantly living with\npain to see that everyday there is less and less. And there was the son-day-commander (ph). And\nthe son-day-commander (ph) was a group of Jewish prisoners in Auschwitz who were operating the\ninvolvement with gassing the people. And I didn\u2019t know it then but now, afterwards I found out,\nand almost I was in there. I returned to Poland and I went to the gas chambers now because I never\nsaw a gas chamber inside. And what I, so we saw, I have photographs and I saw it by myself. The\nprocess that they had, that to tell the people that they are going to take a bath but instead to put on\ngas, this was out completely of my experience both historically and privately. I never heard this.\nAnd not only that, everything that they took away that was ours became theirs . . .[end of side 1 of\ntape 3]... You know, all the values, all the many beliefs that I've been taught and many things, I had\nto tell them everything. It was not just the physically, but to tell them because I started to ask\nquestions of myself. I said, what is education for if it leads to Auschwitz, to gas chambers?\nImagine. Not only did they took away our possessions, our homes, our traditions and everything,\nbut a lot in Poland, gold teeth was our status symbol. Plus people did it to fix their teeth, but those\nwho were wealthier used to make the crowns for the teeth, they put in gold teeth. So when the\npeople were dead, before they went in they cut their hair and this was used for German economy, it\nwas for mattress stuffing and everything. And I was thinking, we had straw mattresses. My parents\ndidn't go to college, and my grandmother. But how did they live? I started to compare the values.\nAnd then, is another thing, from the teeth they took away everything and they selected, the glasses,\nand every single thing they took away from every part of the body. From the skin, lamp shades and\neverything. So everything was, again, what is technology for? And this is why, when I got out, I\ncould no longer have the same values. I had to tear down everything and to compare. What did my\nparents teach me? What did my grandmother teach me? What does my religion teach me? That\nthe most important thing was a human life, to save one life, the Talmud teaches us, is like to save\nthe whole world. And here was my mother who didn't have college degrees, was a extremely\nintelligent woman, well-red and intelligent and very artistic, but she didn't have college degree. And\nyet she resisted. She resisted both physically and spiritually. She did not give up Cal-fus (ph). And\nfrom one person that is now several generations of people. Can you imagine how many generations\nwould be if they wouldn't have killed the six million? How many people? And one Mengelia could\ndo so much damage. And that's when I started to realize, by going back. Not everything that I\nreflect while being there. Many things I reflected upon until this day. And I started to say, so I\nrealized something very important. That four groups of people actually influenced my destiny.\nBecause the Nazis, the only reason why the Nazis did this to us is because we were born Jewish. I\ndid not choose my parents and my parents didn't choose to die in the gas chambers, to be murdered.\nThey didn't die. They didn't die. They were murdered. Those who starved of starvation, those who\nwere killed or those from diseases, they were murdered because they put us in those conditions.\nAnd everything that was ours became their by brute force, by terror and by deception. And this is\nwhy I start about honesty. And then I started to realize, when I look back now, I realized also that\nthere are some things you cannot buy without money but there are also some things we cannot buy\nfor money. And those are the things that I miss the most. No money in the world can replace the\nsix million Jewish people and five million non-Jewish people who were murdered by the Nazis.",
        "Q: I want to ask you some specific questions about Auschwitz. You've told me quite a bit but I'd\nlike to learn a little bit more about who the guards were? How they treated you? Who were the\npeople you lived with? Where were they from and did that keep changing?",
        "A: Well in Auschwitz everything kept changing constantly. Because people were dying very fast,\nokay? And people were coming constantly. So the turnover was very quick. People came. The\npeople in Auschwitz, we were in the same barrack but as I told you, we could not speak each other's\nlanguage. Some could. The people who spoke Yiddish came very handy for me. Because in\nEurope not everybody, but those who came from religious homes, they could speak Yiddish. So it,\nas far as the guard, the people in the barracks I couldn't speak with everybody, nor did I have the\nenergy, nor was there enough time. We came home, we were dead tired. And once we gave us the\npiece of bread we were lucky that we could lay down our heads because before we knew it, it was\nmorning again.",
        "Q: How many people slept on your bed with you?",
        "A: I think it was like about six people or something like this here.",
        "Q: In that one-third of the bunk?",
        "A: Yes. And the bunks were so low you couldn't sit up. You couldn't sit up. And sometimes it\nhappened that somebody died in the middle of the night. Couldn't do anything about it. The corpse.",
        "Q: Were you aware, I mean at certain periods because you were there a long time, you were there\ntwo years?",
        "A: I was from 1942 to 1945.",
        "Q: Yeah, the end of 1942?",
        "A: In November.",
        "Q: Yes. Were you aware of periods when there were less people there or all of a sudden there was a\nhuge new transport coming in?",
        "A: Towards the end when they started to lose the war, there was more transport. They were\nbringing more people. It's like, 1t seemed to me from looking back now, that Hitler was determined\nto destroy everybody. He was also determined that there shouldn't be any traces. And another\nthing, which, see somebody would run away. Everything 1s relevant to conditions I've learned. For\ninstance, if one girl would run away, there were a lot of obstacles. The first obstacle was that if one\nwould run away the others would stay in until they found of that, we all would\nbe punished. So those who had a conscious and who cared said, how can I save my life at the\nexpense of others? Secondly, they evacuated, Auschwitz was called before Oswiecim, it was a\ntown. In fact there is a survivor who 1s from Oswiecim. That was her hometown. So it was a town\nlike any other towns in Poland. So they cleared, they evacuated all the people from there because\nthey didn't want to have witnesses. Plus for miles and miles away there were no people so you\ncouldn't hide. And Auschwitz, Birkenau was the only concentration camp to my knowledge, but I\ndon't know everything, so as far as I know until this day Birkenau was the only concentration camp\nwhere they made, they put on numbers. So you had the numbers. Your head was shaved. You had\nno, you were wearing the clothes. And the same number that you had on the arm was also put on\nthe dress, shift. Where could you go? And there was barbed wires, guards, watch towers. So it's\none of the two, she would want to go to the barbed wires because, so two things happened. Either\nyou get electrocuted or you get shot from the guards. So it was impossible almost to run away from\nAuschwitz.",
        "Q: Did people try?",
        "A: Not too many tried for the reason that I told you, because there was no place to go. Who would\ntake you in? Where would you go? So not too many people. Some people might have jumped the\ntrain, but I don't know of any.",
        "Q: Were there many suicides?",
        "A: Relatively very few. That I am surprised. Very few. For me, its like, when I told you, at the\npoint when Binna and I decided to accept it, I accepted her piece of bread but I also accepted what\nshe offered more, her friendship. At that point, I made a decision. I will, first of all, of my\nupbringing, I told you what my, this here had a very great influence. Plus I said, I will not\ncollaborate in my own destruction. I did everything to try to keep myself clean, to keep myself,\nunder the conditions. I even went through like the motions of washing myself just to feel and try to\nthink, its ironic we were thinking, I remember that Binna and I was talking, said, if we're going to\ngo out from here, once in my lifetime I want to still have a whole loaf of bread. That was my\ndreams. Dreams change. It was one of my dreams. When I was, before the Holocaust, I was\ndreaming of getting a good formal education, become a writer. When I was in Auschwitz, I was\ndreaming about once in my life, before I die, once to have the feeling of not going, my stomach\nshould not turn from hunger, have cramps, hunger cramps. And the other dream was still to be free.\nTo be able to walk once in my lifetime still without the guards walking with me, with the guns and\nhaving to march. I-spy-dry-links (ph), I-spy-dry-links (ph), I still hear that in my head, the columns.\nAnd to see people dying and suffering in a world of destruction when I was brought up to respect\nlife. This was, and another thing that we were naive, and I see now that its not so, 1s that whoever\ngoes out, if I have one dress, just a clean dress and someplace to put my head I will not ask for\nanything more, but if I have a loaf of bread, a clean dress. We wanted so little. But we still have\nnot faced reality then because in concentration camp, in Auschwitz, I was with other people. And\nactually, even though the conditions were so horrible, somebody still took care, I still have\nsomeplace to, even that was the horrible conditions, but I had where to put my head down. And\neven though there was so little, hardly enough to get through the day, food, I still had somebody. So\nafter age 13 I was never on my own. I never, I was protective, loving environment. Here\ncompletely alone except for Binna, which became my friend from, in Auschwitz. I didn't know her\nfrom before. And then, to go out in the world, I didn't face it because at that time all we had, all we\nwere thinking about is of surviving. Of having the things, the things that I want. So at that time I\nwasn't thinking of other things. It's not until I came out that everything hit me. And so\nwe were in Auschwitz and with all this here, constantly dead around us. No separation between life\nand death. The dead people were not buried there. They put them, they took them in, they had like\na little wagon and they would pull them away. And if somebody died when we were at work or was\nkilled, we had to carry them back to the concentration camp to be counted, because we knew we are\naccountable. They made us responsible, one for the other. And this was going on for years. And\nnot having, loneliness, cold, starvation.",
        "Q: You had to carry bodies, you personally carried bodies back?",
        "A: I personally was fortunate that I didn't have to, but there were many times that our commanders,\nyou know, it was a commander, you were assigned to a specific group, we had to carry home,\nsomebody was killed or died on the way, we had to carry them home. Dead or alive they had to be\naccounted for.",
        "Q: Do you remember other things that you and your friend talked about?",
        "A: We was talking about how, that when we going to get out we are going to be grateful. And you\nknow, I'll tell you something. You know, intuition has nothing to do with logic, right? But you\nknow, I once read that the heart knows of the reason, that reason doesn't know heart. But actually,\none time, its like, I don't know, it was not at night, its not what I was dreaming. Its just like a, its\nlike a vision that I see that I am free and people are standing around me and asking me what the\nnumber is. I didn't know whether the outside world knows. I didn't know at all what it was. I was\nisolated. Imagine, in older years, not only did they take away everything from me but they stole\nthree, six years, nearly six years of my life. They stole the chance of education. They stole the\nchance, I never could go to proms, to dates. So from one thing to the other. And still they didn't\nfinish in Auschwitz. In 1945, it was January 8.",
        "Q: Okay, but I want to still ask you a few more questions before we move on?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When it started getting, more transports would come in. Did the conditions get worse or did they\nstay pretty much the same?",
        "A: The condition got constantly worse for me because I became weaker. My body was almost like\na skeleton. And the longer you suffer the harder it gets. And to see the constant destruction.\nBecause I, I cannot praise myself and say, but I had, 1t was helping me to see the people suffer. It is\nhelping me when I see that, I wanted to help somebody. They didn't allow us to help each other.\nWe had to do it in hiding. Let's say if somebody fell and you were to lift up and to help you got\nbeaten. Sometimes you both could get killed.",
        "Q: So you got weaker but you didn't get less food or treated worse or anything like that?",
        "A: Well personally it didn't change that much, but the only thing is that there was more, the\ntransport was so constantly, the smoke coming and the music playing. And more people, we lost\nmore people. So that was the worst thing.",
        "Q: Did the music playing when you went in and out of work too? When you left for work every\nday?",
        "A: Basically the music plays mostly when a new transport came.",
        "Q: Did you pass by or did you live near the crematortum?",
        "A: I have, I was never in the building where the crematorium because if I would be there I wouldn't\nbe here speaking to you.",
        "Q: No, I'm saying were you nearby there?",
        "A: No, not so near.",
        "Q: So you didn't see the people being taken there, that kind of thing?",
        "A: No. Even my own family. When they took away, I just saw them taking them on the trucks, but\nI didn't see them taking this here. But what they did with them and the conditions there, this I found\nout afterwards. I also found out that the people who worked in the crematorium, every three months\nthey would gas them too. Because they were most anxious that nobody should know. They wanted\nto wipe out every trace of the crime.",
        "Q: Who were the guards? Who were your guards?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know them personally.",
        "Q: Were they Germans? Were they Polish? Were there Jewish guards too?",
        "A: No. No Jewish guards. Mostly I heard German. There was also like somebody who watched\nover us. We were watched constantly. Back breaking labor, which was not useful, starvation,\nisolation, all those things you know, any, this is why if there is a plague we experienced it. If there\nis a plague we experienced this.",
        "Q: So your guards and the work commandos. Your , all of these people you really\ndidn't have any contact with, other than them watching you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were they mean to you?",
        "A: The guards were terribly mean because if you for one second to stop to say something you got\nbeaten. If you wanted to help somebody you could get beaten or shot. They teased us, they mocked\nus deliberately. You know, and constantly lived under the fear that you can be taken away. The\nfear of getting sick. So constantly. And then after a while if you, like I made up my mind, live or\ndie. Because everybody has to die. But it was important to, I was grateful each day I\nthey did not assign me some kind of duties or things to do which would dehumanize me really.\nBecause what they said about the dead didn't dehumanize me. That dehumanized them.",
        "Q: What about corruption? Were you aware of other prisoners trying to get stuff or being able to\nkind of manipulate the situation?",
        "A: From whom to get stuff?\nW: From whom ever they could get, I don't know, guards or?",
        "A: The thing is, the guards, those who were there were already sadistic and cruel, otherwise they\nwouldn't be there. And with the guards we couldn't, I told you from the beginning, it was\n, they, we were, the dogs. A dog should also be treated with respect because\neverything that God created should, but the dogs had better than we had. They loved all their dogs.\nSometimes they would let their dogs bite some people. And a lot of mockery. That I felt, okay,\nthey say that they had to carry out their duty. But they really didn't. They could resist. They could\nsay no. They couldn't maybe, when Hitler became so powerful, but they could have done that in the\nbeginning. My mother risks my life and hers and she wouldn't do because she would rather have\ndied than to turn in another person and to survive on somebody else's expense.",
        "Q: Were all the prisoners in your block Jewish?",
        "A: Yes. Only Jewish people. In our barracks were only Jewish. I didn't have contact with non-\nJewish people. I didn\u2019t have any contact, there was no men. The men were separated. In all those\nyears that I, in all the time I was there the only people that I saw is Jewish people.",
        "Q: You came from a very loving family?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: A very affectionate, loving family. Were you able to recreate some of that warmth and affection\nwith your friend there?",
        "A: Yes. We were very, very nice to each other. We tried to help each other. Like I said, we would\nshare, when she had her worse day she would give me a little of her food and we always tried to\nencourage, not to give up. We used to say, and we spoke always Yiddish with each other, and I\nused to say to her, \"They want to kill us. We must not help them.\" We really make a conscious\neffort. Physically I had no choice because they could take us away anytime. They didn't need a\nreason. They had complete control of our lives. But at least we tried not to destroy, we tried to\nencourage each other. Maybe tomorrow something will happen. . And I didn't\nrealize it but I must have had always a very deep faith, very deep faith. I'll tell you something,\nwhich is not, it didn't happen then .. .",
        "Q: Let me just, I just want to finish this. As I'm trying to get a sense of how all of the prisoners\nrelated to each other, the, you mostly related to this one girl? The older people didn't try to take care\nof the younger people or any of that?",
        "A: There wasn't so many older...",
        "Q: Well, but there were people older than you?",
        "A: Yes, there were people older. No. People were helpful to each other because we knew that we\nare, we share the same circumstances, the same destiny. There were, I talk mostly about Binna\nbecause I was closest with her. With her I become, we shared such a traumatic, such an extreme\nexperience. And that's when you really get to know people. That's where the weaknesses, and\nwhen I saw the contrast of Esther to her. With Esther I never hounded, I never, I wish if she is alive\nuntil today, I don\u2019t even hold that against her because under those circumstances not everybody was\nstrong, to resist. But the point it, she didn't want to do me harm, she just couldn't resist the hunger\nso I, this was my only experience where somebody from the girls were mean to me. I never\nsuffered any cruelties from the Jewish girls there.",
        "Q: Did you share physical affection? I don\u2019t mean necessarily sexual, but just that sort of warmth\nthat people need from each other?",
        "A: There wasn't too much of this here. We were dirty, we were cold, we were tired constantly. On\nthe job you were this, but I could feel for instance that Binna cared for me. Because as I went to the\ngate, we were going to go through the gate, and when she knows that they always looked how you\nlook, not that they needed because they took away my family and they were Nazi, so\nshe would say, \"Yit-cola (ph), you are pale.\" She pinched my cheeks. I would do the same for her.\nIf we stood in the pen or where we stood, she said, \"Get into this light.\" She was three years older\nthan I, so it was like, in fact, after the liberation when we were together some people said, \"Well,\nshe's acting like she's your mother.\" She just felt about me like I'm her younger sister. But\naffection, hugging, kissing? There was not, no, there was not affection. You feel, you don\u2019t have\njust , okay, physical affection is very important because at home I could not walk by\nmy parents or my grandmother without a hug and a kiss. But this was not the place, 1t was not the\ntime. If you would see, we were so thin, so skeletal, so dirty, so lonely, so terrible, so full of pain,\nthat those things wasn't even on the mind. You know, the hug. It wasn't because we hug each other,\nthere was not, you came home from work. I don't remember it, special hugging each other. The\nonly time was like if one of us broke down, the other would embrace and say, try to comfort and\nsay, especially like this. No, I felt deprived and I missed this a lot because I was always an\naffectionate person.",
        "Q: That's why I was asking you.",
        "A: Yes, I missed it terribly.",
        "Q: Were you at all aware of when Jewish holidays were?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you have much information about the rest, what was going on in the rest of the camp?",
        "A: Not at all. Very isolated, not knowing what, just this world. Getting cup, coming to the barrack,\nwaiting, and by the time you got your piece, little food, and everything and the finished,\nespecially in the cold, you were so glad, you were so tired that you laid down. Sometimes you were\ntoo tired to talk even.",
        "Q: When you first got there, were there prisoners who had been there longer who would give you\nadvice?",
        "A: When I came in the beginning, I described to you the conditions. I was very, very down, very\nworried to what's happened to my family. But when I found out I was so, felt betrayed, I felt\nshocked, I felt grieved, I felt so many emotions. And I was just, I don't know if it wouldn't be for\nBinna, whether I would have even survived. Just knowing that we need each other for support, that\nshe is already an orphan and alone. And you can't imagine how many times I told her about the\nstory, Buncho (ph) the Silent. Because I remember that, when my mother finished reading this\nstory and I asked her, I'll never forget this, and I said, \"How could Buncho (ph) the Silent endure so\nmuch suffering and pain?\" And my mother answered me, \"My child, sometimes are many stronger\nthan iron and other times we can't enough lie, but no one knows their own strength until they are\never tested.\" And that's when I found out, if somebody would tell me, this I remember this thing.\nThat the very first time when I came and I saw the conditions, I saw everything. And for the first\ntime I was isolated from my family, I said to myself, at that time I was not in contact with anybody\nyet, I'm not going to survive here one day. And you know something? It was ironic. When I went\non the March of the Living, there was a girl and the first day she said to me, \"Yit-cola (ph), I'm not\ngoing to make it.\" And I said, \"Survivors don't give up, honey.\" And I told her, that when I was in\nconcentration camp, that I'm not going to make it, and I made it. You're going to make it, I'm going\nto help you. And she called me, you know, what kind of award I got. It was funny. At the end,\nwhen we were going already from the airport to Philadelphia, two kids who were very creative, they\nobserved everyone. So somebody, they took a napkin and they tore it in pieces and they wrote\ndown, one got the award for the best dancer, one for the best whatever, and I got the Bobbie (ph)\naward. I was to them the Bobbie (ph), the grandmother. And she even introduced me to her father\nby saying, \"Yit-cola's (ph) my adopted grandmother.\" And all the kids say, I'm like a Bobbie (ph) to\nher.",
        "Q: Did you toward the end do different work assignments or did you stay mostly on that one?",
        "A: No. Toward the end of it almost, toward the end of 1944 I got a lucky stroke. I was given a job\nto the , the they called it, the , they were\ncalled because we were wearing red kerchiefs.",
        "Q: How did you get this assignment?",
        "A: Just was lucky. Somebody must have died or something or maybe they needed more. I don't\nknow. But one day, instead of taking me out, they took me to the commander. And that was, I wish\nit would have happened earlier then I would not have lost so much weight and so much suffering.\nBecause this was better, for several reasons. First of all, you didn't have to work outside. The\noutside work was a killer. Many, many people died. I was young and maybe that helped me to\nsurvive, I don't know. But anyhow, in the we would go, we work inside. Our work\nconsisted of selecting, you know the people who arrived they took away everything from them. It\ncame from the, and all the bundles were brought to the , they called it. Why they\ncalled it Canada (ph) I cannot tell you, I don\u2019t know. But this is what it was called. And my job,\nand the jobs of those who were there, was to take apart the bundles and to select and to put in\nbundles the towels with towels, and all this went to Germans for their economy. Everything that\nwas ours became theirs.",
        "Q: Was it strange going through other people's belongings?",
        "A: It was very strange. But we had no choice. We had to obey orders. At least, 1t was not hurting\npeople. Those were things.\nEnd of Tape 3.\nTape 4",
        "Q: You were telling me about the work commando at Canada.",
        "A: Yes. In Canada we had to work also every day. My work consisted, and everybody's work\nactually consisted, we took apart the bundles and we had to select them. Put each item of the same\nkind in bundles and in places. Now, let me start with the advantage for me. The advantage was that\nI didn't have to work outside. I was shielded a little from the cold and from the heat. The work was\neasier than it was to drag the stones and everything else. And also I couldn't take anything from\nthere but there were Nazis that were watching us too. But what I could do, occasionally but not\nalways, nobody could see. Let's say if I found a piece of bread, I couldn't take it out but I could take\na piece of it and eat it. So that provided a little extra food for me. Then there was something that\nthey did that if it wouldn't be for what my mother taught me, that my does not depend\non how others treat me but how I treat others, I would feel ashamed to tell this here. It's just like a\nwoman who is raped, and it doesn't have a good self and she doesn't understand that it\u2019s the\nvictimizer not the victim who is suppose to feel ashamed, then I would feel ashamed to tell you this\nhere. But I don't. I feel pained. When we were leaving, every single day, the most humiliating, the\nmost painful thing, they would search us internally so we wouldn't smuggle out any diamonds, any\ngold, because sometimes you did find those things there. So we couldn't take out anything. And\nthat was so humiliating for me. A girl who was modest, who wouldn't even undress in front of her\nparents. And you know I was like a budding teen-ager when the Holocaust begun. And here, to go\nthrough, that sometimes I wish I would have still walked in the outside commando because each\ntime they did this, I felt like I was dying by inches. It was so humiliating and so disgusting to have\nthese Nazis to search me. So as far as this, if you heard stories that somebody smuggled out, that's\nnot true. , maybe they didn't tell you, but they searched us. They searched us every inch,\nall over, even internally so what, how can you smuggle something out?",
        "Q: Were you searched by men or women?",
        "A: Sometimes were men, sometimes women. It was not, and either way it was disgusting, 1t was\nhorrible. I feel, I cannot tell you how much, how I felt. Because I was never, until I came to\nI never had a internal examination. And this was my experience, it was horrible.\nAnd also the horrible thing was to see, to know that, seeing all the things from some families\nbrought beautiful things because they were not in ghetto, they came in and many people were rich.\nAnd knowing that the people are dead and that these clothes are going to go away for the German\neconomy, that for the Jewish children who were wearing the clothes, Jewish mothers and fathers\nand grandfathers. I shed plenty of tears. The only advantage was that I was warm and had a little\nbit of extra food. That was the only advantage of this job.",
        "Q: So in your two years plus in Auschwitz, basically you had this job and you had that outside\nwork\u2019?",
        "A: That's all. It started physically and emotionally and spiritually in every single way. That's why I\nrelated to you the story about going to because I thought, how could a writer stand so\nmuch suffering and abuse, and I don't know because at that time, it was almost like it felt,\nwhy was Buncho (ph) the Silent silent, why didn't he say something? But I had to find out that I\nhad to be silent to survive because even when they called me number, tried to reduce me to a\nnumber, I couldn't say loudly or anything, but under my breath I said, Yit-cola (ph). You know\nwhat I called my number? My badge of honor. And somebody asked me once, a reporter, why do\nyou call it your badge of honor? And I told him. I got the number merely for being born Jewish.\nTo be born Jewish or Gentile 1s not a choice, but to murder people because they are different,\nbecause they are Jewish or Gentile and because somebody gets a crazy idea that somebody 1s\nsuperior to somebody else, which is a figment of Hitler's imagination, then this is something which\nmade me even more proud to be Jewish.",
        "Q: Toward the end, did you have a sense that you might get out of there? That the war was shifting,\nthat there was a possibility you would be free?",
        "A: I had no, I didn't have any knowledge what was going outside. There was no paper, no\nof communication, no meeting with anybody else. I didn't have any contact.",
        "Q: No rumors?",
        "A: No rumors. Nothing. I didn't hear anything. I don't know, it seemed to me like all I did was\nwork, come home, just waited. Couldn't wait to get, to lay down, to put down your head, it was so\nexhausted and cold. And sometimes, you know what was our, but that was not done deliberately,\nwe slept so many on one bunk bed. So out of necessity of the overcrowdedness we slept on the side\nlike I told you, close one another. So that was our, you know body gives out heat too. So we had\none blanket, everybody was pulling in different direction. So laying, whoever was lucky was laying\nin the middle, felt less cold. So it was not, its an existence, not knowing. Can you imagine? All\nthose years, not having the things which you take for granted. Like a piece of toilet tissue? How\ndegrading.",
        "Q: So you had no idea what was going on?",
        "A: I didn't know anything what was going on. I was living, each day was the same from day to day.\nJust knew inwardly, emotionally, spiritually that I need to hold on. But that's all.",
        "Q: And by saying that, I need to hold on, there obviously was some hope that you would get\nthrough it?",
        "A: No, I don't. But you know what? I remembered the upbringing I had, that we never, we don't\ngive up hope. We don't give up hope. In fact, I remember saying, from my family,\n, which means as long as one vein is still moving there is hope. So we were\nhoping. I had even after the Holocaust situations where everybody gave up hope. I didn't. I'm not\nthis kind of a person.",
        "Q: So how did you happen to leave Auschwitz?",
        "A: I didn't, again, I didn't make any choice. In Auschwitz, the only choice I made is, you cannot\nalways pick circumstances but you can pick responses. So the only choice I made, to live or to die,\nwith dignity, with Menschlichkeit, and to hold on as long as I can. So I didn't make any choice, but\none morning we woke up and I didn't even know what's happened. We didn't have the\n. They started to chase us out. And we started on the death march. And that was\nthe most horrible thing because you survive for so long and here we had to march because the Nazis\nwanted to make sure that we should not get into the hands of the Russians. They wanted, they blew\nup some, I didn't see them do that, but later I was, now I know how many things they blew up.\nThey tried to destroy all the evidence of the crimes that they committed. So we had to march.",
        "Q: What did they say to you? What happened?",
        "A: They didn't say anything. They said, \"Just go. Go.\" And what happened, and we even in\nconcentration camp we were not allowed ultimately to help each other, in their presence. But here\nwas even worse. Because if one, we had to walk. It was, imagine Poland is very, very cold. We\nwere now in April and it was still pretty cold.",
        "Q: January.",
        "A: No, no. Iwas...",
        "Q: The march?",
        "A: No, the march of the living was in January but when I was now in Auschwitz, when I went to\nvisit now...",
        "Q: Okay. But I'm talking about, I'm confusing this. Let's stay with 1945 because it's getting\nconfusing.",
        "A: Right. I'm just trying to tell you the truth, very cold.",
        "Q: It was in January?",
        "A: In January, January 18\" we were chased out. I didn't know at the time if everybody was left or\nnot because there was no time to find out. And what they did or didn't do, once I wasn't there I\ncouldn't see. But we had to march on foot. If you stopped, if you fell, they shot you. If somebody\nfell or couldn't go you were not allowed to help them. So many people, there were plenty people\nwho I saw on the way who was laying dead. And we could not do anything about it. This is the\nmost, this probably, besides my own experience from my own suffering, this was the most horrible\nthing for me. To be human and not to be able to help another human being, if somebody falls.\nLived for so many years and then in that way to die? A lot of people died on the way. A lot of\npeople died on the way. And we started to march on January 18, 1945 and we came to\nRavensbruck. I'm thinking , | wrote down the date someplace. It escapes me now\nbecause I'm so, I'm going to give you the dates I wrote 1t down but not right now.",
        "Q: January 24?",
        "A: I think. Six day march, after six days, okay?",
        "Q: Were there people from a lot of different barracks or was it just your group on this march?",
        "A: There was lots of people. I don't know whether the whole camp or not because I don't know,\nwhat the case was. But there was, you could see like marching very, very long. And not until we\nwere almost German, and then they took us to this, to Revensbruck. We arrived to Ravensbruck.",
        "Q: Okay. On the march, did they give you any food? Did you stay someplace at night? Did you\nsleep?",
        "A: We had to walk. Walk and walk. Not until we were already on the German soil, and I don't\nknow exactly what spot it was, then there was like some trucks that picked us up. And on the truck\non the way we fell asleep, standing, sitting, in anyplace. But while you walked you had to stay alive\nand to be silent, to be Buncho (ph) the Silent.",
        "Q: Did they give you any bread or anything?",
        "A: Not while we were walking. Some people had a little piece, people died of thirst, of cold. It was\nso cold and with the clogs, with the frozen feet. And by that time we were skeletons. Most of us\nwas more dead than alive. If it would take a little longer we probably would not have made it.",
        "Q: Was it all women on the march?",
        "A: I marched with all women. Maybe there were men too but when they chased us out of the camp\nfrom the rest it was, I mostly saw women. Maybe men came too but when they took us out we were\nall women.",
        "Q: And you were with your friend?",
        "A: Yes. Fortunately she made the march. And then we came to Ravensbruck.",
        "Q: Oh I know, there was one other question I did want to ask you. As you were marching did you\nnotice any of the local people along the way?",
        "A: I didn't notice anything. I was just having one thing in mind, the only thing I looked if Binna is\nstill walking with me. That was my concern and if they other girls, if nobody is, and I knew with\nthe last strength, I don't know with what strength I, I remembered my mother's words, \"Sometimes a\nman is stronger than I am.\"",
        "Q: I just wondered if people saw you marching?",
        "A: This I don't know. I was too involved, to make sure that I can make it, you know, when you\nwent so long.",
        "Q: So what happened when you arrived at Ravensbruck?",
        "A: We arrived at Ravensbruck, that's a date that I also wrote but right now I'm so upset, when I'm\nthinking about this Canada, the , the search.",
        "Q: I think you've said that you were there about two to three weeks?",
        "A: Yes. I think February 24 I think?",
        "Q: January 24 to February 11?",
        "A: February 11\", right. January 18\" we were chased and then we came six days later, the six-day\nmarch, and then we came in February 11. And there was also, this was the only concentration\ncamp, death camp, on German soil that has also gas chambers.",
        "Q: Ravensbruck?",
        "A: Ravensbruck.",
        "Q: And you were there for two or three weeks?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was it like?",
        "A: What was it like? Same kind of suffering, same kind of suffering still. They still didn't let go.\nAnd I made a stew and Esther dead. They took us, this time we didn't have to walk already, they\ntook us with trucks. And they brought us to another concentration camp in Malchow, Germany. In\nthe Malchow, Germany they had no gas chambers.",
        "Q: You didn't work in Ravensbruck did you?",
        "A: Not very much. It was not a long time. It was already confusion. Did some work but it was not\nalready as extensive as it was in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: So in the daytime?",
        "A: We did work but, yes we did work. I'm trying to think because I know I worked in an\nammunition factory, but that was in Malchow. Because I remember we sabotaged a lot of the things\nthere.",
        "Q: So, in Ravensbruck during the day. . .?",
        "A: We did work. I don't remember exactly what type of work we did there. To an ammunition\nfactory or something. There was not any Canada or anything like this here anymore. I don't\nremember. I don't have that many because Auschwitz, other towers, everything , this\nis why I, the others is, but I know that there was crematoriums. I was less shielded.",
        "Q: Do you remember any striking differences between Ravensbruck and Auschwitz?",
        "A: It wasn't as huge. I didn't hear the orchestra playing so that was the, and there wasn't so many\npeople. And I didn't stay so long so there I have, when I speak even though I was there but I must\nnot speak of Auschwitz because that's where, it was the last day when I came with family, that was\nthe last day on earth for my entire family. Thousands of Jews from the ghetto Nove Mesto\nincluding my friends and relatives. And the first day of , that's why Auschwitz\nwas the worst of it, Birkenau, that was the worst.",
        "Q: Well of course, and you also were there much longer. I was just trying to get a picture.",
        "A: Yes, we did work but I don't, I remember that after that, after Auschwitz, I no longer worked on\nthe outside commando. So it must either an ammunition factory or something. To be very honest\nwith you I don't remember because I didn't stay that long there. But I know that there was gas\nchambers and I know they wouldn't just sit and not do anything.",
        "Q: And the people, the other prisoners who were there when you arrived, they looked pretty much\nlike the people at Auschwitz? They were thin and sick?",
        "A: Not everybody, not everybody because it depended on the length of time. That had a lot to do, it\ndepended on the physical strength of a person. Some were, not just people but they were\nfortunate they didn't get sick because if you got sick it's the end. I don't remember Ravensbruk (ph)\nin as many details but I know it was, the people there was more Polish people in Ravensbruk (ph).\nA lot of Polish people and some were a little older too. So it seems like they allowed older people\nmaybe more there to come.",
        "Q: So then they took you to Malchow?",
        "A: And they took and brought me to Malchow. And I came there with Binna too. And there, to my\nrecollection, there was no gas chambers anymore. We still were treated badly, we still had little\nfood. The only good better thing was, and we went every day to work, and the conditions were\nhorrible. The only better thing was for me personally, for Binna, that we didn't work outside.\nBecause outside, winter or summer, without clothes, the proper clothes without. That was, and we\nworked inside and we, there I remember exactly what, an ammunition factory. And I know that\nthey gonna use this ammunition maybe against us or other people so whenever we could sabotage\nsomething we did.",
        "Q: How\u2019?",
        "A: How? You know, like if you\u2019re suppose to put it on this way you put it in the opposite. I didn't\nhave any tools or anything to sabotage it but not to do it. And if you could work slower we worked\nslower, you know, the productions. And we knew, whatever we can we didn't want to do to help the\nNazis. To help them to succeed.",
        "Q: Was anybody, of the prisoners, kind of organizing this? Sort of advising people what to do? Or\nyou just thought this up on your own?",
        "A: With what?",
        "Q: With the sabotage.",
        "A: That was a pretty veiled conception. We all wanted all the time but what could we do? We\ncouldn't. In Auschwitz I couldn't, what could I sabotage?",
        "Q: But here did people talk about it? Did they, when you were new there did people who were\nalready there make suggestions or you just figured it out?",
        "A: Some word would get out and some we saw other people doing it. It was not discussed, we were\nafraid to talk. You know, somebody, you never knew who can hear us or something. But we saw\nthat whenever we could, not to do properly or something, then we did it. If it would be, I don't\nknow. Knowing myself, I don't know, if I had opportunity to damage the Nazis, that I don't know if\nI could do. But the things that helped them to kill people, that I did with good conscious.",
        "Q: And enjoyed doing it?",
        "A: Not a question enjoyed, but almost felt like a responsibility. It felt that, they used everything for\ndestruction, you know? People can be creators or destroyers of life. Everything can be used for\ngood and evil. That is the education, I was dreaming about a formal education but I tell you, there 1s\nno substitute for personal experience. And what this experience in the concentration camp taught\nme no professor, no text books, no school could teach me. Because there you had the consequences\nof your action. When, learning, book learning is important but it doesn't have consequences. It's\nnot the same thing. It's one thing to read about slavery than being a slave. It's one thing about\nlosing, if somebody lost a family, than losing your own. Same thing about suffering, about\nbelieving from that my ancestors were in Egypt, its different when you go on yours.\nThen you know. And then something happens inside you. Depending on your attitude. You\nbecome either bitter or better. My mother's last words were not to become bitter and hateful and not\nto let them destroy, and I realize this now. That hate is the most destructive thing.",
        "Q: What else can you tell me about Malchow?",
        "A: Well I can tell that Malchow? I just felt everyday, everyday was like you want another lease on\nlife. I know that the worse the condition got the longer it took. We tried to encourage each other\nagain, maybe tomorrow, don't give up, hold on. That was like a , don't give up. Don't\ngive them the victory, don't give them the final victory. And we just went, we knew we were\ntrapped and we were hoping for a miracle. And not knowing if its going to happen. It just went on.\nWorked and another day, another day, not knowing what's going to happen.",
        "Q: Now at this point did you have a little bit more information about the war?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Still?",
        "A: We didn't have contacts with anyone. From 1942, until I came to concentration camp. Actually\nfrom the ghettos we knew nothing, until I came to the ghetto, before the ghetto I could still hear\nrumors or something but nobody, we didn't have, who could tell us? The only people that we saw\nwhen I was in concentration camp is the inmates and the Nazis.",
        "Q: I just figured that maybe at this point you might have some sense that you had been moved into\nGermany .. .?",
        "A: No I didn't because I didn't know. Because, I had been told not to build, not to assume. An\nassumption is different from a fact. So I didn\u2019t know, so I didn't make any assumption. I just hoped\nand prayed and tried to hold on for as long as I could. That's all.",
        "Q: How long were you there?",
        "A: I was there until I was liberated on, during Passover, April 26, 1945.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: What happened? That's an interesting story. I woke up one morning. No .\nCommotion. And then the Swedish Red Cross came to save us. Not everybody. They took out\nmostly those who were sick and by that time I was pretty sick. And Binna and I, and a few other\npeople, there was a girl, Franya Gilman (ph), she was also on our truck. And ironically, being\ndeceived by the Nazis about this, Red Cross. When I saw this Red Cross I was afraid to go up. But\nyou know, people convey messages by words, by their emotion, by their body language. And those\npeople didn't seem like Nazis. First of all, they didn't wear the uniforms. And I felt that this is not,\nbut at first there was fear to go up. But, so they took us on the trucks. From on the date that I gave\nyou and the war was still going on because it didn't finish officially. So a bomb, a part of a bomb\nfell in our truck and it hit Franya Gilman (ph) and Franya Gilman (ph) had to have her foot\namputated. That was already toward the end, on the way. And from there we traveled from\nGermany to via Copenhagen.",
        "Q: I want to ask you a question before you continue. When you say you saw the Swedish Red\nCross, where were the Nazi guards? Where were the Germans at this point?",
        "A: I didn't see the Nazis. I don't know what's happened to them. I didn't see anybody. All of a\nsudden I didn't see, in the commotion, we didn't know, something . And frankly I\ndidn't know what was going on. I didn't know if I should be happy or should be unhappy, I didn't\nknow what was going on. But then they came and they helped me. By that time I was pretty sick.\nAnd they helped me to come to a truck, they helped me up. And we came to, we traveled. It took a\nwhole day. At night I remember we were in a barn, in Copenhagen, Denmark, Copenhagen.",
        "Q: Did you take a boat?",
        "A: No, no. By bus. Not bus, by trucks. Trucks also. But not such a, not with Nazis anymore. And\nI didn't know what to think, I felt sick and I didn't know already but I saw from the way they\ntouched us because the Nazis never would touch us because we were full of lice and\n. And those people seemed to be kind and we came Denmark. So we stayed\nover night in a barn. And after that they brought us to Lund, Sweden. A university city, to a\nhospital. And I was alive but I had no home to live in so the hospital, they gave me my first home\nafter liberation. But before we went in we had to strip again, naked, throw away the tattered\nconcentration camp shift, and we got a bed. And after all those years, nearly six years, I saw myself\nin front of the mirror. I couldn't speak a lot of Swedish, or understand. I was stateless, homeless,\npenniless, jobless. Unlike my non-Jewish fellow survivors, I couldn't go back home to my family,\nto my relatives, to my friends because Jewish home, Jewish families and Jewish communities were\ndestroyed. I had no one left, to help me, to love me, to wait for me, or to miss me. But I missed\nterrible, everybody. And I remember the shock I got when I saw myself for the first time in the\nmirror. I didn't know myself. I didn't see myself all those years. And it was no sign of\nwomanhood. Another thing, during this Auschwitz I didn't get my period. Until this day, I don't\nknow the reasons why. That was malnutrition or whether they were putting something in the food?\nI would suspect its malnutrition. And I didn't know if I am going to be like a normal woman. And\nwhen I saw myself in the mirror, I started to scream. The nurses didn't know what's happened. And\nI didn't know how to explain. [end of side 1 of tape 4] Anyhow, I, it was a coincidence because I\nwas born during Passover and I was liberated during Passover. And I had less, I had more on the\nday when I was born than the day of liberation. Not a tangible shred was left of my pre-war\nchildhood world. Not a single document, not a family annual, not a photograph, nothing. And the\nSwedish people in the hospital were very kind. Very, very kind, very caring. And to me, if I didn't\nget beaten that was already a lucky day. Because then I started to realize I didn't know anything\nwhat was happen, with Hitler, I didn't know what's Germany, I didn't know how the war is. I was\naway from the war for nearly six years, not having any contact, isolated from the whole world. Not\nreading, not knowing anything. I only knew what I sensed, what I felt and what I, by comparison.\nAnd I talked to myself and I started to realize how one person can make a difference. This was\nGentile people and this was Gentile people. One destroyed so many of my people, the other saved\nthem. And I started to understand many, many things. Not immediately, because in the beginning I\nwas too sick to think and it was lonely. Binna fortunately survived too. At what point I realized...",
        "Q: That you were actually free?",
        "A: When I was with the Swedish Red Cross. Then I started to realize, when we were going, when\nwe came to Copenhagen and I saw that they treat us, it was like between night and day, the contrast.\nThey treat us kindly, the others treated us cruel. They took care of us.",
        "Q: And you felt you were able to trust them?",
        "A: At first I was afraid to go because I didn't know. What the Red Cross represented to me\ndestruction of so many people at first. But then I didn't see any Nazis. I wasn't, I was naive, I was\nyoung but I wasn't completely stupid. And I could see that, the difference of the way they treated us\nand, you know? They fed us.",
        "Q: What did it feel like, being liberated?",
        "A: It was a tremendous shock, a tremendous, the transition was not, I didn't, all the time I dreamt\nabout being free but the every day struggle to survive, to get through the day, not to be put to the gas\nchambers, not to be maimed, not to be, health, and to live. It was the struggle to survive so that you\ncouldn't think about all the other things. You were with everybody together. Many people together,\nwe were on the same boat like we used to say. But when we were liberated, and when I came there,\nI couldn't speak the language. I was 19 years old. I couldn't understand a word of anything. A\nstranger in a strange world. Not having anyone. And all of a sudden, in the beginning right away I\ndidn't even think so much. I was too sick, too tired, the shock was very much. But then the very\nfirst time, I will never forget, but this was later, but I'm sharing now an experience when I was the\nfirst ttme, or maybe I should go when I come to it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I was in the hospital there. I was getting good care. The contrast was a sharp contrast from the\nway the Nazis treated us here. And I remember one thing I was thinking, if this 1s, I remember I\nwas seeing the differences because I always had the ability because I was creative to compare. I\nsaid, \"This is Gentiles and this is Gentiles.\" So good and evil, no one has a monopoly on it. It has\nmore to do with the . With who you are as a human being. What you believe about\nyourself, about God and about others. That effects your behavior. And therefore, I realized even\nmore what my mother's last words, don't become hateful and bitter, don't let them destroy you, I\nrealized what tragedies and hatred is. And the more the Nazis tortured me, the more I was\ndetermined never to become like them, to view myself through their eyes. And here I saw kind\npeople. I had a very, very wonderful memories. Very, very grateful to the Swedish people, the way\nthey helped me. They helped me to get on my feet. I have nothing. I came in, like I said, I had\nmore on the day I was born. Here I went in the hospital, I came in nude because they couldn't allow\nthis filthy dress to come in this here, the first thing, we came in and took the showers and they\nhelped me to bathe, covered, nurse me back to health. And for this I will be always grateful because\nI learned not to take anyone or anything for granted. Because its very easy to lose everything. And\nwe stayed in the hospital and then, I think I gave you all the dates, right?",
        "Q: Well I don't know...",
        "A: Otherwise I have everything, I have it all written down.",
        "Q: I don't know how long you were in the hospital, I just know that you arrived in Lund on April\n28\".",
        "A: Right. Because on the 26\" I was liberated. On the 27\" I was in Copenhagen. The 28\" I arrived.\nAnd at that time, when I started to get healthy I started to examine and to re-evaluate everything.\nWhat is it? Who 1s responsible? And basically what I was interested 1s, in the beginning, to regain\nmy health. I started concentrating on regaining my health because I realize that health is wealth,\nhealth is important because if you\u2019re sick and you are alone, you cannot do very much. And I was\nvery much aware that I no longer have anyone to love me, to protect me, to take care of me. So I\nneeded to become my own parent and start taking care of myself. Of course, Binna and I were still\nvery devoted and very loyal to each other and we were each other's family at the time. And I was\nthere in the hospital, I got very good care. I also was always fortunately a good student and always\nloved language, words. I always realized the power of words, so I was very eager to learn Swedish.\nSo while there, I started, they were very kind to me, they gave me a dictionary and I started to learn\na little bit. And to recover. And I was in Lund, Sweden until May 7, 1945. From there I was sent\nto Dod-ug-stup (ph) in Sweden. It's called Dod-ug-stup (ph), it's you know? And\nthis was DP Camp, which in Swedish is called . On Rinks-vagen (ph) 20 B, that\nwas the address. Now there we were in a quarantine, we still couldn't go out because the people\nwere afraid, if we are, if we don't carry any diseases or, so we were not treated badly, in fact we\nwere treated very nice. However, we only got 50 cents a week, it's 50 , which is like 50\ncents here, for pocket money. And we started, the people from the town came to the, there was also\na fence, but was not barbed wires, it was not electrocuted wires, and we would come to the fence\nand they looked. Some came and we would give them sometimes the money and ask them to buy\nlittle trinkets for us. And there was a couple with a young son, must have been maybe early 20's,\nand with the few words that I could speak we made contact. I already recovered a little bit, looked a\nlittle better. And I didn't think of myself at that time as a woman yet, but obviously he thought of\nme that way, and he asked me, and in the broken Swedish with the dictionary, I understood that\nwhen I get allowed, when I will be allowed to get out from the quarantine, will I go on a date with\nhim. And that was the first date of my life, okay? So I was very excited and anxious. I didn't know\nhow I'm going to know how to behave with a man, I didn't see a man for all those years. I didn't\nhave any experience in dating and mating. I went out with him. It was a very, very painful\nexperience for me. Because as soon as we started to talk, and not very much, he paid me a\ncompliment, you don't look Jewish. And that was like a knife in my, twisted in my heart. Here I\nsuffered so much and I'm not Jewish? And again, he doesn't see me as a human being. Yes, I'm not\ndenying my Jewishness, I'm proud to be who Iam. Would I be born a Gentile, I would be proud to\nbe Gentile, but I'm born, I didn't make choices about this. It hit me so hard, and I don\u2019t believe he\nmeant it in a bad way, in a malicious way. He was a kind person. But for somehow he reminded\nme who I am, not that I ever forgot it. And I said, \"Good-bye.\" Excuse myself with tears in my\neyes and I left. And I made a decision. Never will I go out with somebody who is not Jewish\nbecause I'm the only link left, the only daughter left of my family. I cannot do it to my family or to\nmy people or to myself. And in our camp there, in the DP Camp, was a woman which was called,\nwe called her , means she was a Rabbi's wife, so the husband is a Rabbi, she is\nthe Rabbi's wife. So she was the Rabbi's wife and she was orthodox and she took a great interest,\nshe wanted the children, those who are under 21, to remain Jewish. So she took us, she told us there\nis a camp that she wanted to take us. Also, we were not still completely free to go. A kosher, a\ncamp. It was no, it was, I prefer kosher to not kosher of course at that time, but it wasn't so much\nthe kosher because in the concentration camp I ate not kosher, so, but it was that I felt I need to be\nwith Jewish people.",
        "Q: The DP Camp was mixed?",
        "A: The DP Camp was only Jewish, but when I went out, and he tells me this here, I was too\nwounded yet from the whole experience. Maybe if he would say today I would laugh it off, it\nwouldn't even have mattered to me this much. But at that time, I wanted to be accepted for who I\nam because I realized by that time, if I cannot be accepted for who I am surely I will not be accepted\nfor what I am not. So I wanted somebody to accept me for, it's not that I had anything about a\nGentile or anything, but I wanted to be, I needed to be among my people who are Jewish in order to\nknow that I don't, shouldn't be told you don\u2019t look Jewish, or be accepted for who I am. So I\nvolunteered to go to the camp. And on July 10, 1945 I left and I went to Hel-shin-\nfel-hol-it (ph), this is what the place called. However, there was something which was troubling\nme. I wanted Binna to come too. I didn't want to separate. I thought of Binna as my extended\nfamily. The Rabbi's wife said, \"Itka, I don't want to separate you from your friend, but I can't take\nher. Not now at least. Because I cannot make exceptions.\" And she was three years older so she\ncould no longer go. But she said, \"I give you my word that after a few weeks, I will bring her too.\nBut not right now because then I cannot give about this.\" So I decided to go and I told\nBinna that I'm going to try to make sure that she comes later. And the Rabbi's wife certainly kept\nher promise and she brought Binna there too.",
        "Q: Now I have a question about actually both of these camps.",
        "A: The DP Camps?",
        "Q: Right. Because I'm curious who organized them and supported them? And also, what sort of\nactivity went on in them? They were trying to, I think, restore people. Were there family tracing\nservices? Did they have religious services? In these DP camps?",
        "A: In the first camp there was hardly anything. There was just the emphasis on restoring us to\nhealth. Even when I came there, I was not physically that strong yet. So the emphasis was on\nrestoring, to get us used to a normal life, 1f you can call it normal. And so there was not much, we\nrested basically. We didn't do very much. It was more recuperating. It was like a convalescent\nhome you would go from a hospital, that sense, except better because we were already, we were not\ninvalids.",
        "Q: Any religious services?",
        "A: No. Not at that point. Nothing yet. At that point it was just plain start putting us a little in the,\nnow when I came to Hem-shed (ph), we observed strictly the Shabbat. In fact, Mr. Pound (ph) was\nthe name of the and he could only speak Swedish. He was the, in Swedish was the\n. This was like the manger, like the, whatever you call it, when somebody is in\ncharge of. He couldn't speak a single word of other language, just Swedish. So he asked, \"Is there\nanyone who can speak Swedish a little?\" . I learned quickly the\nlanguage. While I was there, I was always with the dictionary and trying to learn the language. So\nhe, I became his helper in the office. I had no training to be in an office and I wasn't asked to do any\noffice work. My job consisted basically, translating. If somebody came in and needed something.\nWe got sheets and pillow cases and things like this from there, so we needed to change them, I\nwould be in charge of this here. If somebody, basically helping him translate and do duties like this\nbut no office work because I had no training in this here.",
        "Q: Who supported these camps?",
        "A: I have no idea. At that time I didn't know, I was still not having, I was in the world already, in\nthe normal world but it wasn't yet a normal life for me, it was not. So I would rather not say and tell\nyou something which I have no knowledge. But I know it must have been, I don't know. Now I'm\nasking, I'm glad you\u2019re asking those question because maybe I'm going to ask around to find out.",
        "Q: It may be , it may be International Red Cross.",
        "A: Yeah, it could be somebody, maybe the Red Cross or maybe the Swedish . . .",
        "Q: Or the World Jewish Congress, or...",
        "A: Yeah, somebody. But who? I don't know at that time. But we had good meals. It was in a very\nnice place, physically it was a nice place, nice surroundings. A lot of nice greens and it felt good.\nWhen we came there we didn't have anything. Everybody got a suit case, the same kind, and a\nchange of clothes next to what we were wearing. And sheets, pillow cases, soaps, towels, this we\ngot from there. And I was working there and then at one point, I start to feel that I no longer want to\nbe in collective life. I want to start a life on my own because when its collective, it has advantages,\nbut it has the disadvantage. You don't develop an identity as much. I needed to start a field, build a\nlife. So Binna and another girl, Regina Shapiro (ph), who was there also, we were assigned to go,\nwe got our first job. And this, I didn't have any, I was 19 years old. I had no marketable skills and\nonly seven grade of public school and a few grades of Hebrew school. So I didn't have, I had to\ntake whatever job they would give me as long as it was respectable. And on November 18, 1945 I\nleft, Binna Gold-gramp (ph) and Regina Shapiro (ph) and I left and we went to a , it\ncalled Redland-da (ph),\n, you know, not so far from Bar-oss (ph). At that time I didn't know where its\nlocated. And Binna saw that we were, I mean Regina saw that we were like sisters and she was all\nalone so she asked us if she wants to be with us. And I said of course. So we went to work.",
        "Q: You had complete freedom to leave when you wanted to?",
        "A: Yes, at that time we could leave. That was because when I came there in was in\nJuly and we went on November 18\", so by that time, yes, we could leave. Of course, a lot was still\nlacking to my complete health and everything else, but I was ready, I wanted to assume a job.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something, did you think there was a chance that maybe some of your family\nmembers had survived? And did you think about going back to Poland?",
        "A: Not once. I knew that they didn't. I knew that my immediate, when you say immediate family,\ndoesn't...",
        "Q: Not immediate family but you had a lot of cousins and...",
        "A: I didn't go to Poland. I didn't have the means, I didn\u2019t have the strength, I didn't have the know-\nhow, I didn't have the money, I didn't have anything. I just stayed, this is why later, towards the\nend, I'm going to just make a summation and you are going to see why I realized that, I'll talk about\nthis later because then its going to make more sense than now. Anyhow, so when we went to work\nhere, we came, that was my first job. Freedom by choice. Until that date, whatever I did is where\nthey sent me, even to go into , to the kosher , the DP camp. I don't\nknow if we didn't call it, we called it . I didn\u2019t even know that it exist, DP camp,\nso I was still cut off of the world. I had no communication because I wasn't on my own, I didn't\nhave any radio, I didn't have, you know those things, papers and things. I couldn't read too well yet\nto be able to understand, so it was pretty tough still. And when I came to , on my\nfirst job I had a very traumatic experience. I came willing to except any job providing its\nrespectable. I was determined, if I survived Auschwitz with dignity I will not, I was determined on\nthree things not to give up, on my life, on my and on my freedom. Because I realized\nwithout it life is not worth living for me. And I came there, there was basically a very tiny village.\nThere was a sanatorium for children with TB. And most of the inhabitants there, I don't know how\nmuch the population, were people who were elderly people. Single, elderly people. There was\nvery, I don't think there was anybody my age there. But at that time I didn't think about those\nthings. I was just grateful and why I accepted the job also because it was room and board and I\nwould still get paid a little. And I need that to have because that was, I didn't have a home still. I\ndidn't have an apartment or anything on my own yet.",
        "Q: How did you find out about this job?",
        "A: Mr. Pound helped me out. Mr. Pound liked me a lot. In fact, he said to me, we got to know each\nother and he liked me a lot and he said, \"Itka, if this doesn't work out you come back to me. I have a\nwife and children and we'll take you in until you get on your feet.\" He was very nice. He was not\ninterested in me as a woman, he was interested as a human being, to help me. He saw me as a\nhomeless child. And he offered, but I was determined to make it on my own. And we went there,\nand the general boss was a very nice woman. She would sometimes invite me for a walk, to go with\nher, she would help me a little with Swedish. Anyone who didn't help me was nice to me then, you\nknow? The comparisons, you know? That's what I said, when you heard me saying a reference\nwith which to compare. And she took me into the kitchen, assigned me to work in the kitchen. In\ncontrast, the woman who was the manager of the kitchen, she was the general manager. The\nwoman who was in the kitchen for no apparent reason hated me with a passion. From the moment\nshe brought me in. Why? I have no idea and it doesn't surprise me. Half of the world hated me,\nthat I didn't care and I survived, so I didn't worry about it anymore. However, she assigned me to\nher and one day the general boss said to me, \"Make the sandwiches.\" As soon as she left, she would\nsay, \"Scrub the floor\", or do something that was not as easy or as good as the other job. But I\nfigured, I came here to work and I'm going to do what they tell me until I'm able to get on my feet\nand then I'll see. And I worked there and I got paid, not too much. And Binna, Regina and I shared\none room and we got room and board. One day was my half a day off and I was going to leave and\nthey burst from the kitchen, made like \"Don't go!\" And all of a sudden I had a flashback from\nconcentration camp and I was getting nervous. And I very politely ask, \"Why not?\" \"There are still\ndishes\", she answered. And I said, \"There will always be dishes in our hospital, but it's my half a\nday off.\" Because I was thinking, if she would have asked me I would have gladly stayed. Because\nthen I have a choice. But when I'm ordered I have no choice. And if I accept it once, the beginning\nis the most important, than I'm going to have to do it all the time. And I'll lose my freedom and I'm\nnot ready to, after Auschwitz, never again will I give up my freedom willingly.",
        "Q: Were you afraid to say no?",
        "A: Nope. And I marched out. After Auschwitz I'm not afraid of anything. Just to do something to\ndisgrace myself or my family. Other things I'm not afraid. What can scare me after Auschwitz?\nAnd as soon as I walked out, and I came to my room, this so-called good manager comes in and she\nsays to me, \"Itka, I heard what's happened. But would you do it for me? Go back?\" And I had\nmixed feelings. The heart said one thing, the head said another. But I went back. Walking on the\nway, everything in me revolted. I said, \"I'm sorry, I can't do it.\" I started to cry and I run back in\nand I didn't go in. I had been taught as a child that never make serious decision, long range decision\nwhen you\u2019re under emotional strain. So I told myself, I said, suppose I left?) Where am I going to\ngo? I have no home. The only option is to go to Mr. Pound and I don't want to do that. To be a\nburden for them. What future is there for me? It also meant to leave Binna, to separate from Binna.\nBecause I didn't dare ask her, come with me, when I have nothing to offer. Not a place, not an\napartment, not a job. So I said, no, I can't do it. So I went to the good boss and I told her how I feel\nabout it, and I said, \"Listen. I have no home and no place to go. But I am a survivor of a\nconcentration camp. I got so much abuse that I promised that I will never allow anybody to abuse\nme again or give up my freedom. So I will gladly stay because I don\u2019t have any other place to go.\nGive me any job. I don't mind scrubbing toilet. Job doesn't scare me. I was working carrying stone\nand things. But I want to be treated with dignity. If somebody wants something from me, let them\nask. And if I can I will gladly give, but I don't take orders anymore.\" And she said, \"I'm sorry. I\nwould gladly do it but she has been working for me for 36 years. I can't afford to lose her.\" After\nthat I had no longer to think. So I figured, so again not justice. It's just for convenient for me. At\nthat point I said, whatever is involved, whatever risk, I must take it. I went in with tears in my eyes,\nI said good-bye to both my friends. They didn't offer to come and I didn't ask them. At that time I\ndidn't even consider, I didn't even, now I am thinking, how come I didn't offer to come Binna? I\nwouldn't let them anyhow, but they didn't. You know, everything went so fast. And I picked\nmyself up and I went. Like Buncho (ph) the Silent. Went to the world with no one, an orphan, with\nno one to care. And when I came to the train, they asked me where do you want to go?\nEnd of Tape 4.\nTape 5",
        "Q: At the last tape you were getting ready to get on a train for somewhere.",
        "A: Somewhere. And when I came to the train, running not walking, because I want to make the\ntrain. I didn't have too many belongings to take with me, I didn't have very much. And I didn't even\nhave time to buy the ticket at the office, at the station, but I boarded on the train. And the conductor\nasked me, \"Where are you going?\" I said, \"To the nearest, largest city.\" Because I didn't know\nSweden at that time, I hadn't been around yet. So he said, \"Boss (ph)? Boss (ph), Sweden? You\nknow Boss (ph)?\" I said, \"Okay.\" And that's where I learned. When I came into Boss (ph),\nSweden, I did not know a single soul. I had no home. And all of a sudden it dawned on me. Where\nam I going now? Now I am completely alone. No family, and not even friends. My two friends are\nalso without me. Where am I going to sleep? What am I going to do? And I walked quite a while,\nmostly I was completely oblivious of time, I didn't know, and in desperation, when I started to\nrealize my situation, that I have nothing. I have no money. I have no home. I'm a homeless person\nand I'm all alone. Even as bad as it was in concentration camp, I knew this is where I'm going to\nsleep at night. Here, I don't have anything. And I must admit I was concerned. And all of a sudden\nI looked up to Heaven and I found myself praying. And I remember exactly what I said, inside\nmyself. Dear God, I am all alone and I am helpless. I'm in your hands. Guide me. I don't want to\ndo something to disgrace myself or my family. And I had been walking, I don't know how long,\nand then all of a sudden I thought that I hear somebody saying, \"Yit-cola.\" I said, am I losing my\nmind? I'm hearing voices? And again I hear repeating, \"Yit-cola.\". And I look around and a girl\nfrom concentration camp recognized me. She lived in Boss (ph). And I tell her my story and she\nsaid, \"Don't worry. We are concentration camp survivors. We can share whatever we have. Come\nup.\" And I stayed overnight. She directed me how to go to the unemployment office, the next day,\nand I went. They asked me, did you work before? I told them, yes. Why did you leave? I said, \"I\ntell you the truth, there's no young people. And I wanted to start a new life. There was nobody for\nme to associate with.\" Which was not a lie. But that was not the only reason because eventually I\nwould have left anyhow. But it didn't dawn on me. She asked me to come back, that she's going to\ncheck out my story. Because I wasn't used to telephones yet because I didn't have a telephone. And\nshe checked out the story and when I came back, she asked me, \"Why did you try to protect her?\"\nAnd I said, \"Listen. I didn't leave, I'm not going to gain anything by making her look bad.\" You\nknow, my manager from the kitchen. \"I just don't have a future there. And I left for this reason, but\nI also eventually would have left anyhow because there is no life for me.\" And I told her a little bit,\nnot much, but I told her that I have two friends who stayed there and I want to be with them, can she\nfind a job for me, for them too? And she did find me a job. However, in Sweden was a custom.\nThat you only, if you worked for somebody they provided you with an apartment. You paid for it\nbut if you stopped working you no longer could use that apartment. So I went to work and, when I\nhad already a job for the three of us, and an apartment, I got in touch with my friends and I brought\nthem over. With Regina it didn't work out too well because there was, two is okay, four is okay,\nthree is a little part in our relationship. Because Binna and I, except for underwear, shared\neverything. Even after we were liberated. It wasn't mine and yours. Money, time, work. She felt\nbetter if she did for me, if I did better I did for her. So we were like sisters. Regina wasn't, she was\nmore, she was a nice girl but, like, this 1s mine, this is yours, and we were not accustom because\neven in Auschwitz we shared. So we decided that she's going to have for herself a room. So we\nwere on the second floor, was also a little room. So Binna and I shared one room, she\nshared another room. In Sweden, the custom was the dinner was not in the evening, it was during\nlunchtime. Since I was brought up in Poland and there was no ready-made foods and everything, so\nI was still accustom to do, I knew a little bit how to cook because when I was at home I used to help\nmy and my parents, you know? Chop this and... so I knew that my mother tried to\nteach me everything, what she could, and I would, we would make meals together. And every day\nsomebody would go take turns, one day Binna would go and warm up the food a little early and I\ndid, I had a day when I didn't feel so good she would help. We were really devoted to each other.\nAnd one day, I was walking home from work and I was rushing. I was always very fast and\nenergetic. And bingo, I'm on the ground. And I feel that from the elbow, from the back,\nsomebody's helping me up. I turn around. And it was a man. I thanked him and he starts talking to\nme and he notices that I have an accent. And we start talking and he had an accent too and we\nfound out that we are both survivors of the Holocaust. And he tells me that he lives on the same\nstreet, he asked me where I lived, I told him, the same street. But he lives in a hotel and I was, I got\na small apartment. He helped me home and he tells me that his father was, not a , but\nyou know like a self-made ; . There used to be a lot of people like\nhome-made remedies and he was going to clean up my knees and bandage, I was still, even though I\nwent through Auschwitz, but I still was not the kind of girl that would let him see my knees, you\nknow? So I said, no thank you. And I warmed up the food and offered him some food. And he\nsaid it smelled nice and everything, and he said, \"Oh, I would gladly pay to have a meal like this.\"\nAnd I said, \"I don\u2019t run a restaurant. However, if you want to have a home-made meal, during the\nweek we work, I don't have the time, but on Sunday you're welcome. Binna and I is going to be\nhome. You can come up and have dinner with us.\" His name is in Yiddish, Avrum Schmol-lev-itz\n(ph), now he called himself Abe. And Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) started to come. I don\u2019t know\nhow I should call it, to date me? But he would come constantly visiting. Showed a great interest in\nme. I liked him very much as a friend. Very loyal, well devoted, caring. But I didn't have any\nfeelings for him otherwise. And he was coming to our home for almost a year. Now, at that time,\nthey sent to Sweden, when we came to Sweden, all the women were there. . There\nwere other women from Sweden too, that were survivors. But the men they sent in other places. So\nthere were only two men in our city. So there was no prospect for somebody to find, you know? So\neverybody, Binna and everybody else is saying, \"Itka, you're so lucky. You have a man who likes\nyou so much.\" And, I don\u2019t know, I never talked with him about love because I certainly didn't love\nhim. I loved him as a human being, as a good person, but no otherwise. And I remember that\nBinna said, \"Oh, I would be lucky to find a man like this.\" And, \"Why don't you marry him?\" And\nI said, \"You like him, you marry him.\" Anyhow, I didn't marry him and Avram, in Yiddish we\nactually called him Avrum because we spoke Yiddish, he received, found out that he has two sisters\nwho live in America, who survived. I don\u2019t know where, I don't know too much about those things.\nAnd they send him a visa. And I could have gone with him to America but I did not want to go.\nBecause I said, I'm not going to negate myself in any way. If I'm going to marry someone it's going\nto be somebody who I have deep feelings for. Love not only as a friend but as a .\nAnd anyhow, one time, Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) comes up to our apartment and he tells me, he\ninvites me to come to his apartment. I got so angry. I said, \"After knowing me so long don't you\nknow I'm not the kind of girl that doesn't go to a man's apartment?\" You know, we were brought\nup, you had to be a virgin when you got married, it's not like today, you know? And he said, \"Sha-\nsha, I'm not just inviting you. I'm inviting Binna too and there are going to be other people.\" And I\ndidn't know at that time yet what's, and I came. And this was either June 24, 1946, yes, it was\nalready 1946. June 26 or, I think it was June the 24\" in 1946, and I come to the party and as I come\nin with Binna, there are lots of guests, and I didn't know that this was the party for his, farewell\nparty, good-bye party, bon voyage party. He was leaving for America. And as I come in a man sits\nthere and as soon as I look at him and he looks at me, he moves a little bit and makes room and says\nto me in Polish, \"Please sit here.\" And I sit down next to him, and from the first moment, I care\ndeeply about him. And I started to get worried, what about Binna? And he, I found out later that\nAvrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) and this man, and I'll tell you later who he was, knew each other from\nthe same hometown and the man that this man came with was also from the same hometown. From\nBell-hot-off (ph), Poland. They're all survivors and they knew each other from home, they went\nfrom . And found out later that there were even some cousins also between these men.\nAnd he, what I found later out, that he knew already that I am not going to get involved with him so\nhe said to his friend, \"If she cannot be for me at least let her be for you.\" Because he considered me\nto be okay, I don't know what he thought about me, but he wanted me to get a nice man. And the\nperson that I met there was Rockmiel Zygmuntowicz (ph), my husband. And after, and he ask me\ncan he take us home. So I said to him, \"You came with your friend. Why don't you invite him too\nand we'll go together?\" Because I wanted for Binna to have somebody, to make ;\nyou know how is, to be the matchmaker. And he said, \"Okay.\" And they want\nto go upstairs and I said, \"No, it's too late. After a certain hour nobody comes to our apartment.\" So\nhe said, \"Promise me that you're going to wait for me.\" He worked in shifts from morning until\n2:00 and from 2:00 to 11:00. That I'm going to wait. He got a job and the other man was\n, which turned out later to be Binna's husband. And he said to\ncome, will we wait for him? And I agreed. Anyhow, I met him a couple of times and\nstarted to date Binna too. And one time, Rockmiel (ph) says to me, \"Do you know a\ngirl, her name is Manya Mo-nes-ka (ph)?\" And I said, \"By sight I don't know much about her. I\njust know she's a pretty girl. That's all I know about her, from sight. Why are you asking?\" And he\ntells me that her brother was with him from where he came from, another city in Sweden, and he\nasked him to meet his sister. He wanted to make a match. He didn't tell me at the time though that\nhe gave him a letter, he really was trying to make a match. So I said, \"Why don't you go?\" And\nBinna kicks me under the table, she said, \"Are you crazy? You're going to send a cat for\n. You like him so much and you're going to send him to another girl?\" I said. \"Yes. If\nhe likes her better, it's better he makes the choice now than later.\" And she didn't like that so she\nsent . He came back and he said, \"Now we can get engaged.\" So a week\nlater, after I met him, I was engaged. And on July 13, 1946, before Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) left\nto go to America, we had a double wedding. Binna married Mendal Crook (ph) and I married\nRockmiel Zygmuntowicz (ph). That was the happiest and the most tragic day of my life. Happy\nbecause obviously I love my husband, we loved each other. But he is the sole survivor of a large\nfamily. He was one of seven. Only one sister died before the Holocaust and the rest of his family\ndidn't survive. And I was the sole survivor of my family. At least he had three at his\nwedding. I didn't have one single person from my hometown. One single person who knew me.\nMy family. And I remembered that when my, when we lived in Check-hon-off (ph), we used to, I\nmentioned before that we were kosher, so we would buy chickens, ducks, geese. And from the\nchicken feathers we took to the ritual slaughter and then they would pluck, it wasn't ready-made like\nhere, so all the other feathers they threw away. But from the geese and from the ducks, they would\nsave it. The down. And this was suppose to be for a trousseau, for Yit-cola (ph), when she's going\nto get married. And whenever they had a wish, they said they should live to see me under the\n, which means under the canopy. And here I was all alone. I had no one. And it hit\nme. The only person I had is my husband, Binna and , who was my dear friend.\n, bless his memory, he is no longer alive, he died several years ago. And at our\nwedding, I had a borrowed dress. I didn't have anything. We married deliberately during vacation,\nthe week of vacation, because we didn't have enough money for the next week. And on our\nhoneymoon, we didn't go anyplace and we cooked a big pot of soup. And for a whole week, the\nfour of us shared. This was our condition in the beginning. And yet, I've tried to make a go of it\nand Binna and I made a switch. I shared with her my apartment and Mandle (ph) and Rockmiel\n(ph) shared a little apartment when they came from the other city. So Binna went to live where\nRockmiel (ph) lived with Mendle (ph) and Mendle (ph) moved in with me and Binna moved out, in\nthat little apartment. You don't understand? I had an apartment where I shared with Binna before I\nwas married. Mendle (ph) and Rockmiel (ph) came from another city and they had a little\napartment. So when we got married, so Binna went to live with Mendle (ph), it was her husband.\nAnd I lived with Rockmiel (ph). But there is something that, it\u2019s a curious thing, because I learn a\nlot from people. When an engagement we made, I didn't know too many people. So there was only\nBinna and Mendle (ph), Rockmeil (ph) and I, Avram, and two girls that I met in Boss (ph), that I\ndidn't know from before. One girl tells, who was invited there, Rose Lift-ka (ph) she was called at\nthat time, I don't know what's her, she was married, and she was very anxious to get married. She\nwas a lot older and there wasn't any boys to marry, the girls were worried that they won't find, and\nnot everybody wanted to marry out of their religion. So anyhow, we had a tiny room. All there was\nin the room is two single beds, a table and a couple of chairs. I didn't even have a stove in the room\nSO we went to going from the steps, to go up to the first floor, I took a little, made a little curtain or\ndrape and I bought a hot plate. And that's how I cooked. And from the sink that we used. But I\nwas Satisfied. So I went out to bring in the food. Anyhow, this girl says to me, I introduce my\nfianc\u00e9e when we got engaged, and she says to me, \"Yit-cola (ph), he's not for you.\" And I said,\n\"Why?\" And she said, \"He's too big a flirt.\" And I think to myself, wait a minute, I only deal with\nfacts. How would she know what he is, she just met him? She would say he's not attractive, she\ncan see, but how can she know he's a flirt? He's never, she never met him before. So I just ignored.\nAfter we were married, my husband asked me, \"Are you good friends?\" And I said, \"Just met her.\"\nBut I had no one else and I wanted somebody to be with us at our engagement. So he said, \"Did\nyou know that when you went out to , She invited me to come to her apartment without\nyou?\" I'm going to cook for you, I'm going to do this. And I thought to myself, you see how\nimportant is the thing for yourself. To think what people say and use your own common sense.\nThis is why I'm telling you the story. Anyhow, we were married and eventually my husband was\nworking very hard. And Mendle (ph) told me how hard he's working so I was upset about it so I\nwent and I gave up the job I had, which was that I could have, because, that he should be able to get\na better job. And I should get apartment, to get a little bigger apartment. And we were in Sweden\nand we didn't have anything, we started without anything. But we understood that it\u2019s a beginning\nand we worked hard. And then in 1948, and for a long time I was worried whether I'll be able to\nbear a child. Because I didn't get the period yet for so long. Finally I got the period. And anyhow,\nwe got an apartment. And you know, I'm telling you those stories because I'm seeing that all over,\nin every country and in every religion, and even in every home, there can be people who are good or\nnot so good. So anyhow, we had an apartment and this, in this house where I had the apartment\nfrom this lady, I had another job, she told me from the beginning that I'm not allowed to have any\nchildren in that home, in that place. Because there were only living people without children.\nMostly elderly people. And she put in our apartment two beds, single beds. And one time, at night,\nI hear somebody is opening the door. She came to check if we are sleeping together, and here I am\nmarried. And I always, I don\u2019t know so much about how I was when I was real young, but as far as\nI can remember, I was taught to think for myself and to trust myself. And my parents always gave\nme confidence, you know, that I had that, that I was able to trust myself. So I figured, let her say\nwhat she wants. I didn't argue, I didn't talk back. And it so happen that that's when I got pregnant,\nin that place. But I knew, as soon as it will be shown she will make me miserable. So again, I had\nto switch because I didn't want it to have, to worry, and somebody hear, so many of my people were\nmurdered. And here, I had worried for so long, if I'll be able to bear a child. Here I'm pregnant and\nsomebody looking down on me or not permitting me to have a child. I need her permission? So I\nstarted to look for an apartment to get, to keep the moving again. Anyhow, when, before, when I\nmoved into another, when I was pregnant I moved to another apartment. And I didn't know\nanything about how the human body works. A woman's body. And the doctor just told me the date,\nwhen to expect. And just told me two things, that I'll have pains, bleeding, then it's time to come.\nAll the time my husband and I was rehearsing. Where we going to go? How we going to go?\nEverything. It so happened he had still shift work. And he left in the morning and I woke up and\nmy water bag broke but at that time I didn't know that I had a water bag and I didn't know what it\nwas. I just saw it's not something that's, not, that I never had before. So I go in, I don't have a\nfriend, I don't have a family, I don't have anyone that lives near that I can ask. So I go into a\nneighbor, to ask her, what does that mean? She said, \"I don't know. Go ask the doctor.\" So she's\nadvising me to go ask the doctor. My husband is not home, I don\u2019t have a telephone number. And\nhere I see something is not right and I don't know what it is. So I take my bicycle and I'm going on\na bicycle to ask the doctor. And here my water bag is broken. And I came to the doctor and they\ndon't let me go home anymore. In the meantime, I'm showing you the different influences, how one\nthing influences the other. And in the meantime, my husband meets somebody in the street and\nthey ask him, how is Yit-cola (ph), and he told them that I am expecting the baby. And here I was a\nlittle bit . Anyhow, and this was already after he knew that I went on the bike to the\nhospital, that the water bag broke. And he tells her the story. So she says, \"Well, if the water bag\nbroke and the baby's not born then the baby cannot live.\" In the meantime, I gave birth to a healthy\nboy and my husband comes to the hospital and he comes in, I see the uncertainty on his face. He\nholds his hands behind his back and not a smile, no emotion. I said, \"What's going on here?\" And I\nwas wondering. No congratulations, no nothing. So distant and cold? I said, that's not my husband.\nThat's not the man I know. And I said to him, \"Mistletov, we have a son.\" And he get so excited\nand tears are in his eyes, and behind he had a bouquet of flowers but he was afraid to show them\nbecause she told him the baby might not live, and he thought maybe it was a mistake. So I'm\nshowing you, why am I telling you this story? I had no experience. I was alone. That when I\nneeded somebody, a mother, I needed relatives to help me, I had nobody. You know? And my son\nwas born October 12, 1948, the same year the State of Israel was born. Two miracles in my life. A\nson and after 2,000 years I lived to see the dream that my people prayed, the State of Israel. But\nunfortunately I didn't have relatives to share . And ever since I've been\nliberated, I couldn't even tell you the time because usually I know, that I feel, I told you\nI want to do something, but I couldn't put it in words. I knew that I had to go back\none day to Auschwitz. I never said good-bye to my family. I just knew that something is still not\nfinished yet. Anyhow, and I stayed in there. Then after that I was, started to work, no, the first year\nwe had no choice so we had to take, after my son was about a year, we took him to a nursery\nbecause we had nothing. We needed to work and I was suffering tremendously because I was\nbrought up with two loving women at home and a father. And, but I had no choice. And my little\nboy had an accident. He was accidentally, you know in Sweden we still didn't have the modern\nconveniences so we had a stove, a wood-burning stove, and I was use from Poland, so we washed\nthe diapers and we boiled them. And I even ironed them. And one day, by accident, and I always\ncaution him don't go to the stove, and the hot water spilled on him. And I thought that I'm going to\nlose him so I went with him to the hospital. I come back to the work, and my boss saw, the first day\nshe didn't say anything, and I wanted to stay, this is our little boy, he's . And she tells\nme, \"Your personal life is of no concern of mine.\" I didn\u2019t say anything and I thought to myself, I'm\nfree physically. Now I have to be independent financially too. And since my husband had shift and\ngot my child with others, and I started to go to fashion design school. And I'll show you, I have the\ndiploma. And I started to work. And when my second son was born, I no longer had to take him to\nthe nursery. I could be home with him. Now, Binna and I, as I mentioned before, had a double\nwedding. She was, before I got pregnant she was pregnant and she miscarried. So she got pregnant\nagain. I was early, she was, it turned out that we were, both she and I gave birth in the same\nhospital. Her first child was born on October 1, 1948. My son was born October 10, 1948. And\nsince in Sweden, so many adjustments. In Europe, we didn't know about formulas. So we used to\nnurse each others children. We were very close with each other. Anyhow, then in November 29,\n1951 my second son was born, . And as I said, I no longer needed to go to work outside\nbut it was very, very difficult because I had, I sewed everything, from little suits for the children, to\ndraperies, to slip covers, to custom and I worked very, very hard. But I was happy\nbecause I could be home with the family. Then I received information that, from the , that\nwe can go to America if we want to. And I decided that I'm going to talk with my husband, find out\nhow he feels. And we both decided. We're going to go to America.",
        "Q: Why did you want to come to America and leave Sweden? Or not go to Israel?",
        "A: They didn't give me a choice to go to Israel. If they would give me a choice I would go.\nBecause they would take care of it, so I had to go again where I was, the reason why I was leaving\nSweden is because there was no synagogue. There was, the few Jews that were there, if any, were\nassimilated. And I felt I survived as a Jew, I suffered as a Jew, I lost my family because we were\nJewish. And orthodox or not orthodox, but I want to give my children a Jewish education. A\neducation, not just the secular but a Jewish education too. I wanted to be, for\ninstance, when my son had to be circumcised we had to bring a Rabbi from Stockholm. When we\nwant to have kosher meat we had to send it, by the time it comes after three days its no longer\nkosher if you know the laws of .",
        "Q: But you could have moved to Stockholm?",
        "A: No, we felt there is no, that there, we could have moved, it's not so easy to move. You have to\nhave a job, you have to move, and you have the circumstances. We had nothing, we started with\nnothing. So we decided, plus, I just felt that too many, you know, in Europe there were too many\npainful memories. If they would have given me a choice I surely would have gone to Israel and that\ntime, but I didn't have a choice. They assigned me to come Philadelphia, so on February 15, 1953\nwe arrived to the United States and settled in Philadelphia, and we've lived there ever since. During\nthe time when we came here, I knew that we wanted to have a larger family. And we had to make a\nchoice. And I knew that all life, from the morning you wake up until the time you go to sleep, you\nmake choices. And I was also taught that every, in every choice there are consequences and there\nare lessons. So I had to put my value system to work. And I said one thing, if I have children I\ndon't want them somebody else to take, I want to be with them. I want to, I didn't have that\nprivilege because it was not of my choice, my mother would have wanted me, because one of the\nthings which I remembered, very distinctly, is that my mother put aside her, she wanted to be an\nactress but she put away. And the family was always first. And other things which I heard when I\nwas home is that my mother was pregnant but she had a miscarriage and I was very much the child\nthat she wanted so much and I was loved unconditionally by my parents. And I felt I don't want to\ndeprive my children of that. So we decided, my husband and I, as long as we can pay our bills, we'll\nforego luxuries. I would never accept a handout from anyone. We worked hard work. And I will\nstay home with the children . And then in 1956, November 24, 1956, our son Samuel\nwas born. Again, I remember that when I was going to go to America people said, where you going\nto go with a baby? Or the seas, and how are you going to make out? I always had faith. I said,\nlisten, I'm nursing the baby. So at least until I nurse him he's not going to starve. And then\nsomehow its going to work. You cannot have everything mapped out every inch of the way. And\nwe went. It was difficult. I came here. I didn't know a single person in this country. I didn't know\na single word of English. Again we had to adjust, to start anew, to make adjustment, to make work.\n, | was already skilled, I was already a fashion designer but my husband had no\nmarketable skills. He was working in a knitting factory making nylon stockings. But he was\nwilling to work and take it, we went from one, it was very hard because he got a job here when we\ncame to Philadelphia, he worked in . By the time he came, the the children\nwere asleep. By the time he came home, they were already, they were still asleep, they were\nalready asleep. And I said, no, this won't do. Because I will never put material possessions above\nspiritual things, which we need. So I encouraged him to change the job. There was an\nadvertisement. After he worked a few days, they just had a few , they let him go. So he\nwas taking any kind of job, three, four jobs. But he would never, we never took anything from\nanyone. And we struggled and then on February 21, 1964 our youngest son, Michael, was born.\nAnd I knew that I made the right decision, to stay with the kids at home. Because, first of all, it\nwould cost a fortune, four children you have to camp, and I didn't want to send them to camp\nbecause I remembered the beautiful summers that I had in the country, picking mushrooms and my\nmother showing, making crowns and put on your head, and singing, and I don\u2019t want them to miss\nall this here. I felt that to give them love, because I started to realize that it's the love that I received\nthat I can give to others now. And that you can survive with very little because in Auschwitz I\ndidn't have anything. And after I was married. Anyhow, when my youngest son was suppose to\nbecome barmitzvah, we decided instead for making a big party, his name was Michael, may be rest\nin peace, that we're going to go to Israel instead. And to celebrate his barmitzvah there. And since\nI'm an intuitive person, and we decided this already, I wake up one morning and I said to my\nhusband, \"Honey, let's go now.\" And he said, \"When was this born? Why?\" And I said, \"I don't\nknow why. I just now feel we should go now.\" And he agreed. And it was a very good decision.\nAnd we went. And for the first time I met my cousin Uta (ph), okay? I was eight years old in 1934\nwhen she left. I came there in 1974, with my youngest son. Ours was always a very close knit\nfamily and Uta (ph) was thrilled. We cried in each others arms. Because she was the sole survivor\nof her family. She always felt bad that she left. She never could come back. And I remembered\nmy grandmother saying, . So I was able to go back with my son, to meet\nmy cousin Uta (ph). And there is Israel, there is a country now. And she gave him for his\nbarmitzvah a and a . And she asked him, just like my parents called me\naffectionate, I called my children affectionate, \"Michael, what would you like besides this.\" He\nsaid, \"Nothing, I'm just happy to see you.\" She says, \"No, tell me.\" He said, \"Okay.\" He wants a\nlittle chain, Michael. And I went to Israel, it didn't take long. I receive a call. My cousin Uta (ph)\nwent to the doctor, her check up, and either on the way there or on the way home, got a heart attack\nand died. If I wouldn't have gone then, I already told you what I, my intuition and that I listen to my\nintuition. And I would not have seen her. Anyhow, Michael was a beautiful young man. He was\nvery successful because he was loved and he had a talent to laugh, a full measure. I remember when\nhe was a little boy. He used to ask me, \"How come that we don\u2019t have family? How come you\nhave a number?\" And I told him, and the conversations, I wrote it down and then I made a poem\nfrom it. And I remember that when we moved into our first home, this is my second home in\nAmerica. He walked over to a neighbor's, his mother, an elderly lady. He said, \"Lady, I don't have\nany grandparents. Would you be my grandmother?\" I'm telling you those things, that it effected not\nonly us, it effected the children. And she became like his adopted grandmother. She was very good\nto him. She lived to be 96. Anyhow, Michael and I, and I remember one time, you know he was\nmore than fifteen years between him and my older son. So he almost grew up like an only child\nbecause they were already in college, . And one time I was sitting and I felt so lonely\nand I said, \"Michael, I need a little medicine.\" And I'll never forget his scared look. And he said,\n\"Ma, are you sick?\" And I said, \"Oh, not that kind of medicine. I need a hug and a kiss.\" And he\ncame over and gave me a hug and a kiss and after that he would come over many times, he would\nsay, \"Want a little medicine?\" And that became our between us, medicine meant a hug\nand a kiss. And when he was already in college, he would always, when I would write to him or\ncall him, I'd say, \"Michael, I can't wait to have a little medicine.\" And he said, \"I can\u2019t wait to give\nit to you.\" And he was very successful because he was loved by many people. He was successful\nin college. He graduated from the University of Rochester. At age 25 he was already in a\nwonderful position and he owned his own home and he was successful in every way. He was dating\na beautiful girl. And it was, my son Jerry was suppose to graduate in 1990, from University of\nCornell. And Michael was here Thursday and he said, \"Mom, Dad. Be ready. I'm going to come\nand pick you up. We're going to go to my brother's graduation.\" That was Thursday. Friday, the\npolice came and told me that I have no longer a son. My son, Michael, was killed. And instead of a\ngraduation party I had a funeral. He was killed instantly in an automobile. .. [end of side 1 of tape\n5] Michael was loved. Hundreds and hundreds of people came to his funeral. Hundreds of trees\nwere planted. He has a garden in Eastside from all the trees that was planted. My cousin,\n, my son is gone, my family is gone. And I always wear this, this is my most\nprecious piece of jewelry. Michael. And in my lifetime, I see the destruction of European jewelry.\nThe and defeat of Nazi Germany. And the rebirth of the State of Israel. I remember one\ntime, Michael and I were very, very close because he was the youngest. And he was the longest\nhome. And he was very, very affectionate and he gave me back what I gave him. And when I lost\nhim I was thinking, at least I was always for him. And his cards, in our home we have a tradition,\nwe write home-made cards. And in each card he said, Mom you were always there for me and you\nloved me unconditionally. And the kids, when I went now to where they are living, I mean to the\nWorld Holocaust Survivors, Michael is no longer with me. He is still with me because he died late.\nHe didn't go with me to the gathering. And now when I went to the March of the Living, and I saw\nthe trees and I was thinking. When I went the first time I went for Michael's barmitzvah. My\nhusband was still a healthy man, now he's not. How many changes in our lives and how quickly,\nfrom good fortune to bad fortune, life can change. And how many times, if we don't have a, if we\ndon't say good-bye to the ones we loved. And because of that, I never leave anyone without giving\na hug and a kiss, and giving the love and affection. And I feel I did make the right decision, that I\ngave up everything and was a full-time mother, wife and friend to those who needed me. After\nMichael started college and I said to myself, when I can close the door and nobody will wait for me\nand depend on me, then I can start paying back the community. In the 1970's I got involved in\nspeaking on the Holocaust. But before that, I was a volunteer in Hospital in the Mental\nHealth Department. I was going as a volunteer to the Great-a-felt (ph) Prison. I was going on\n. Iremembered my grandmother's teaching. Help those who are less fortunate than\nwe are.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a couple of questions.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Are you okay? Do you want to take a break?",
        "A: No it's okay.",
        "Q: You sure\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When you came over here, to this country, was it easy for you to make new friends? And to start\nagain? You had to begin again in Sweden.",
        "A: When I came here, as I said before without wanting to repeat myself, I didn't know one single\nperson in Philadelphia. But when I was still in Sweden, when I came to Sweden, it was the same\nthing. And I'm going to go back something, to Sweden, because the same thing happened here. It\nhappens to be related. When I was in Sweden, and one time it dawned on me, that if something\nwould happen to me, you know? So alone and everything. Nobody would miss me. If I would die,\nnobody would, it wouldn't be a loss if people don't know me. And I decided that the most important\nthing is family and friends. And I made an effort to reach out. I was no longer of being hurt, that I\nlose somebody, because in life everyone that we love either they will die before us or we will die\nbefore them. But not to love is the greatest loss. Not to trust is the greatest loss. When I came here,\nI didn't know anyone. When I made my son's barmitzvah, the first one, I had over 100 people. And\nwhen I make my barmitzvah, I have over 300 people. When I was going to make\nMichael's barmitzvah, and I start to make the list, we needed 500 people. I don't say everybody was\na personal, close friend, but they were people who I was involved. And I said, no, I cannot get\ninvolved. I made for my friends already now, I in Israel. I find one thing. That the\nsurvivors of the Holocaust here in Philadelphia, we have our, first we were called the Jewish New\nAmericans. Then we changed the name to Holocaust Survivors. We have a common past and a\ncommon responsibility. To remember our personal stories. Because for us the Holocaust is both a\npersonal and a collective Jewish tragedy. It's a human tragedy.",
        "Q: Did you find that, certainly as you were getting started here, that it was easier to be close to\npeople who had also undergone the Holocaust? Or did you readily make friends with other people\nwho hadn't been in Europe?",
        "A: First of all, I couldn't make friends with other people until I learned the language. And we\nformed already 1956, we already had here the organization. So we shared a lot together. And we\nrealized that this cannot be just a social organization. We have to work for Israel. We have to\nremember the Holocaust and to share with others and to teach. But for me, I had and I still have, all\nkinds of people. If I would show you my telephone book, you will say how can you keep up?\nBecause I made, I didn't discriminate. I feel one thing, the only criteria that I, that is important to\nme, is not how much somebody has, who he knows, what he knows, but how much he cares. And\nwhen a person is caring, and he is a good, decent human being, than I can be their friend and they\ncan be mine.",
        "Q: Was it easy for you in the early days here? Before you were going around and speaking about\nthe Holocaust? To talk about your experiences?",
        "A: It was difficult then, it's difficult still. However, I don't do only the things which are easy. I do\nmany things which are difficult but they are necessary. And when I was asked, there was here a\nprofessor , the late , | mentioned to you before. And she is from\n. And she wrote a book of the Holocaust and she, once a friend of ours from the\norganization invited about 20 survivors. I didn't know what the purpose was, it wasn't like a social\nthing. And I found out that she wanted to organize, that people should speak on the Holocaust.\nAnd I went there and that was the first time that different survivors among ourselves started to share\na little feelings. And I realized that there is not, we realized that there 1s very little in the text books\nabout it.",
        "Q: Actually what I'm trying to understand 1s, not so much in a formal way, speaking about it, but\nyou had friends from all walks of life, talking in the earlier days here. Was this something that you\ncould talk about? That you could share? Did people want to hear about it?",
        "A: I never went around and volunteered.",
        "Q: Just on a personal basis.",
        "A: Okay, but I mean, what happened was that when people saw the number they start to ask me\nquestions. And I answered. I always, I did the same thing like I did with my children when they\nasked about sex. Short question, short answer. They asked me so I answered. And people, not too\nmany people were so interested, they didn't know what it is. And then, a little later, when people\nstarted to know about it, especially the Holocaust survivors, realized that in the text book there 1s\nvery little about the Holocaust. They speak about World War One but not about the Holocaust. So\nwe started to form an organization and be involved with this here. So it was difficult. Because, to\ngive you one example, with some people it was easier. Some are more compassionate, some are\nmore understanding and more curious. Others are more involved with their own life. So it depends\nwho it was. I had my late friend told me that someone asked her once about the Holocaust and she\nstarted to tell a little bit. She said, \"Well, we had that in America hard too. We didn't have any\nsteak.\" And after that she decided never to talk about the Holocaust to her. The Holocaust has\ntaught me many lessons. Because before the Holocaust I only had positive experiences. I had no\nframe of reference with which to compare all the blessings that I have. The blessing of a loving\nfamily. The blessing of good health. The blessing of having my home. Not to be called all\ndifferent names. Because I've been called all kinds of names. I've been called no name at all. I've\nbeen called, derogatory now, Jewess, which was anti-Semitic name. I was called you\nrefugee. You foreigner. All kinds of name. And I feel one thing, that its very important. Respect\nfor one another. Respect for differences. That we cannot expect everybody to be alike. And that\nwe must, I don't want to use the word must because that sounds dictatorial. It's important to protect\nour human rights. And just, in the very beginning, with even the smallest incident that's happened.\nWhen somebody does not treat you right. I have learned to become a . I want to\ngive you an example because that's going to be more. I was invited several years ago to an open\nhouse, a barbecue. And the barbecue started because there was some people who were suppose to\ncome from other cities too, it was like a big gathering. They started to come on Friday until Sunday\nevening. We came Sunday. We live, it wasn't in Philadelphia. And when we arrived, not the\nowner but one of the guests greeting me with anger. \"What's the matter? Why so late?\" At that\ntime I realized, I had a chance to sort out my emotions, and I realized that if I answer in anger he is\ncontrolling me emotionally. So I looked at him very calmly and I said, \"Thank you. I am so glad\nthat you missed me.\" And he answered, \"You know I like you Yit-cola (ph).\" And I said, \"Thank\nyou\" again. This man, may he rest in peace, is no longer alive. He was otherwise a good man, but\nhe had a habit of putting some people down. And I have noticed that volubility illicits aggression in\nthe group, compassion in the kind, and silence in the indifferent. And this is nothing to do with\nrace, color or religion. It has to do with the ability of self image, of confidence, of the ability to love\nyourself because you cannot love others if you don't love yourself. And to care. To know that what\nwe do effects not only us, it effects others too. Because after the Holocaust, I was thinking many\ntimes, you know I told you I like to write, and I was thinking up to age 13 most decisions my\nparents and grandmother made for me. You know children don't make where to live and what to\ndo, of course I had some. During the Holocaust I couldn't make choices about my life. Even after\nthe Holocaust. Okay, I could have said no, I don't want to come here. But I didn't have many\nchoices. I could say, I come, I don't come, but I couldn't say I want to go someplace else because\nthe . So I felt that so much in my life I had to live and to do by choices\nwhich others made that effected me. And I sat down once and I wrote just a few words. And it\ngoes like this:\nFour groups of people\nDramatically influence my destiny.\nMy late, beloved family in Check-hon-off (ph), Poland\nWho knew me and loved me and empowered me with positive energy.\nHitler's Nazis who didn't know me\nBut hated me merely for being born Jewish and in one, single day\nMurdered in Auschwitz my entire family.\nThe bystanders, who knew but didn't care.\nAnd the Swedish Red Cross, who didn't know me but liberated me\nFrom Nazi tyranny and brought me to a hospital in , sweden.\nI am one and the same person.\nIf four different groups of people viewed me differently,\nAnd treated me differently,\nI was loved for who I am\nAnd I was hated and starved and tortured for who I am.\nThe more the Nazis tortured me for who I am\nThe more I was determined never to become like them,\nBut to view myself through their eyes.\nTo the Nazis, I was just a number, sub-human, a vermin.\nBut I am not a number.\nMy number is my badge of honor.\nLet those responsible for the number feel ashamed, or whatever they want.\nI am a proud Jewish daughter.\nTo be born Jewish 1s neither a crime nor a disgrace,\nBut to starve, torture and murder innocent people\nFor being born Jewish is a crime against God and humanity.\nA crime that has influenced the entire world.\nBecause whatever we choose to say and do\nWe are becoming partners too.\nBut others are becoming the beneficiaries of our good deeds\nOr the victims of our evil deeds.\nWe each can make a difference.\nOne person can save many people\nAnd one person can destroy many people.\nMengelia is responsible for the dead, over 400,000 people.\nOn the other hand, Wahlenberg and even Shindler is responsible for so many lives.\nFrom the 1,100 Jews that Shindler saved, 6,000 descendents are now alive.\nCan you imagine how many would be if the others had survived?\nTherefore, I feel that my first responsibility\nIs to God\nTo live by the commandments\nAnd not to transgress them\nBecause I cannot do evil without becoming evil.\nThe lessons that my father taught me, whatever I do I become, if I lie I'm going to become a liar and\nI'll help him and others.\nAnd I know one thing, we live in this world\nWe are responsible for one another.\nBut not in a way to punish each other.\nSo whenever there 1s injustice and cruelty\nWe need to be, to speak out, no matter where it is.\nAnd to stand in solidarity with those who are repressed\nAnd not with the oppressor.\nIn the final analysis, without , all , religion and education fails.\nSo we need first to improve ourselves because then we make a better world.\nIf you wish I can share with you a few of the poems if there is still time.",
        "Q: I have a question. Because you do feel responsible, a sense of responsibility for your world . . .",
        "A: Our world.",
        "Q: Right, but it's the same. Are there certain events, historical events, in the last forty years or so\nthat had a really strong impact on you other than, you've mentioned the birth of the Israeli State.\nAre there other things that have effected you in this country, like the Civil Rights Movement or\nwars or anything?",
        "A: Yes. I feel, do you remember there was a who came and he wanted to, here in\nPhiladelphia, to speak in the movies about the Nazis? We went and marched. When there was, we\nwent to speak. Then there was suppose to be a rally here, Nazis wanted to march here. We went to\ncourt, I was among them, and we fought against it. When I hear in private life, it doesn't only have\nto be in big things, in private life, when I was, when I hear that somebody is making a joke or on\nsomebody else's expense, or an ethnic group, generalizations, I stand up and I speak up. I said, \"I\ndon't appreciate what you said.\" In fact, one of my dear friends who is non-Jewish, who I met\nthrough such occasion. Because we were in the , It was a meeting and somebody\nsaid something negative about another group. And I said, \"I really don't appreciate because I know\nhow it feels when people do that.\" So in small thing. You know, prejudice is very easy because\nyou don't have to give accounts for it. You just say it but you don't have to give, you know? And\nthe point is one thing, it's like fire. When there is only one spark, you can erase it. But if there is a\nbig fire, you have no control any longer. So in the little thing and the inter-relationship, in our daily\nlife, in the personal, how we do people. Because usually when a person from one group offends\nanother, sometimes he starts hating or being angry towards the whole group. So its important to\nrespect each other. It's important to speak up when there is a cause, when the Russian people\nworked, you know, when there was Iron Curtain, and we were fighting to release them, I was\nmarching. So when there is something, a special cause, if I know, if I see something injustice I\nwrite a letter, I speak up. That's my contribution. Those are the things which I do. I cannot say, it\ndoesn't bother because it effects. You know, I just wanted to add, the Holocaust effected not just\nme, because the point is one thing, six million Jewish people and about 5 million non-Jewish people\nhave lost. They will never become what they had the potential of becoming. The world will never\nknow how many wonderful people we have lost. Nor how many Nazi war criminals we have\ngained. Because some of them still live in hiding . So what did the world gain?\nLose good people and gained criminals? Whenever there is a crime we lose a good person, we gain\na criminal. What trade-off is that? So it's important. Even to, in my own home, to my own\nhusband, I once told my husband, in sickness and in poverty and in riches and poor and everything,\nI will always stand by you . But you commit a crime and I don't want to be any part\nof it. Then you have to trade yourself in. So there are certain loyalties. In life we need to make\nchoices. We need to say to bring up decent children we have to learn to say no. Because you know,\nin the commandments there is the ten commandments. It says you shall, you shall not. And another\nthing how you can put out, you cannot hatred with hatred, anger with anger. Somebody once said in\nanger to me, I hate you. Because I wouldn't give in to something that was not moral or ethical. I\nsaid, it's okay I love you for both of us. And the person apologized, she said, I really don't hate you\nit's just that I was angry with you, I couldn't, you are stubborn. I said, what you call stubborn, that\nstubborn is what saved me from. Because, in fact, I always felt what my family taught me. That no\npower in the world can break my spirit as long as I don't collaborate with people in my own\ndestruction. Because what we do, this is what we become. You kill you become a killer. You\ncheat you become a cheat. You save somebody so you, so the final analysis, it's not how much we\nknow or how much we have, how much we care. Caring is what life is all about. And we have a\nwonderful group in Philadelphia now, that was in the museum last week. They are called\nChampions of Caring. High School students. And this is sponsored by the Holocaust Museum in\nthe Washington. And by the Jewish Relations Counsel in Philadelphia. And the , also in\nPhiladelphia. And those kids, what do they do? They go and help those who are less fortunate.\nThe sick, the elderly, the disabled. This is what we need to do. You know, the strongest message I\ncan give, what I've learned, if we are not our brother's keeper, by omission we become our brother's\nkillers. Because there are sins by omission and sins by commission.",
        "Q: Would you like to read something?",
        "A: Yes. I picked those two poems because, actually there are three poems that I would like to share\nwith you if there is enough time.",
        "Q: We'll see.",
        "A: Okay. The first one is called 'A World That Vanished.",
        "Q: And when did you write these?",
        "A: This was written May 8, 1978. A long time ago because the Holocaust, I've been living and\nbreathing it, it's effected so deeply my life.\nJust like a leaf tossed to the wind\nSeparated from its branches and tree\nNot belonging anymore\nLiberated but not free\nCarrying the pain of separation\nMemories so painful and dear\nMemories of our world, it use to be\nA world that is no longer here\nI still see the Sabbath candles\nAnd my mother's gentle face\nMy father is chanting the prayers\nMy grandmother with her white shawl of lace\nI see my little sister and brother\nSo young and so full of cheer\nNot yet understanding tragedies and hatred\nBut sensing uncertainty and fear\nThe Nazi boots are marching\nMy world with terror is filled\nThe Holy Scriptures are burning\nChildren are starved, tortured and killed\nThe ghettos are closing us in\nWhat is there for us in store?\nMy world is going slower and slower\nNothing is like it was before.\nThe freight trains are taking us on a journey\nFor most it is the last ride\nMy brothers and sisters are burning\nThere is no more place to hide\nHitler's final solution is sealed\nWe are trapped in a world of Hell\nI am amazed that I have survived\nThe horrors from the Holocaust to tell\nAnd there is another poem, which is called \"I Am Not A Number\", and I wrote it May 13, 1994.\nI was trapped in the killing center of Auschwitz\nSurrounded by barbed wires, gas chambers, smoke and flame\nThe Nazis tattooed a number on my arm\n2-5-6-7-3 became my new name\nThey tried to reduce me to a number\nDehumanize me day by day\nBut regardless of all their efforts\nThe could not take my self worth away\nThey murdered in the gas chambers my entire family\nIn one single day\nAll my earthly possessions were so brutally taken away\nThey treated me worse than a hardened criminal\nEven though I did not commit any crime\nThey hated me merely for being born Jewish\nAnd starved and tortured me all the time.\nI was only 13 years old when they took away from me my right to life\nBut they could not take away my will to live and to survive\nFor nearly six nightmarish years\nI have endured a living Hell\nNevertheless, I have outlived Hitler and the Third Reich\nAnd lived my story to tell\nThe third one is my conversations with my late son, Michael. When he asked me the first time\nabout the number. And this was written May 14, 1979.\nWho wrote on your arm, Mom?\nAsked curiously my little boy one day\nI looked sadly at my innocent child and thought\nVery carefully what to say\nThe Nazis tattooed this number on my arm\nI told my son short and plain\nWhy did they do it, Mom? He asked further\nMy God, I thought, how can I explain?\nYou see my child, there was a man\nAdolph Hitler was his name\nHe was very cruel and hateful\nAnd inflicted on people suffering and pain\nOh, said he, and ran out to play\nAnd I signed with great relief\nI wanted to protect him for as long as I could\nFrom knowing my deep sore and grief\nHe grew and I could not protect him forever\nSo I answered his questions one at a time\nHe wanted to know why we Jews are hated\nDid we commit some kind of a crime?\nNo, my child, I told my son,\nWe have not committed any crime\nYet we Jews have been victimized and slaughtered\nBy ; and Hitlers all the time\nDo you hate the Nazis for what they did to us?\nNow I have no grandparents and relatives like my friends\nThe Nazi murdered all our loved ones\nThey have blood on their hands\nI know, my child, that you too are hurting\nBut hatred and revenge can never restore\nThe lives of those who perished in the Holocaust\nAnd the precious things we had once before\nYou and I who know what pain is\nMust never inflict hurt and pain\nWe must try to build a better world\nSo the death of the victims shall not be in vain\nThis is my message.",
        "Q: Did you talk much about your experiences with your sons?",
        "A: Yes. But I spoke to them, I told them, but I spoke to them more about my experiences before the\nHolocaust. I wanted them to know their grandparents. Because I felt its important. And as a result,\nmy oldest son , a couple of years, two or three years ago and maybe a little longer,\ncame here to visit. He lives in New York. And afterwards he calls me up and he said, \"Ma, I had a\nvery traumatic experience.\" I said, \"What's happened?\" He said, \"I was waiting for the train and I\nsaw a man laying face down across the tracks. And I saw from nearby that the train is coming. I\ndidn't know whether he was drunk, dead, sick, pushed, or wanted to commit suicide. I had no idea.\nAnd I was thinking, what should I do? My mind was racing. On the one hand, I risk my life\nbecause I didn't know if I'm going to be able, get time to get back. And on the other hand, I thought,\nwhat would my grandmother do? My grandmother .\". Because I told him the\nstory how my mother sacrificed herself and me. And he said, \"I jumped up and I saved him. People\nhad to pull me up.\" My first reaction was, how could you do something like this? And then I said,\n\" , when you graduated from Yale University I felt you achieved something special.\nBut this is something more special. You proved that you are a and that is the highest\nreligion, education and achievement. I am very grateful.\" Another thing, because everything\neffects, another thing is that when he was little and he was the oldest and he was not born in this\ncountry, had also to learn the language and go through the difficulty as a child. I once told him,\nbecause he asked me also about my experience. I said, \" , both your parents are\nsurvivors of the Holocaust. We lost everything that was ours. All that we have is our good name.\nAnd if you will, I will always love you unconditionally, no matter what you will do because you are\nmy child. But just like I ought to feed you, I ought to feed you spiritually. But there is one thing.\nYou do something morally and ethically wrong, you will not be allowed to have my name.\" And I\ncompletely dismissed it from my mind. When he was an adult already and I came to visit. And all\nof a sudden, he starts telling me, \"You know, Mom? Whenever I was going to do something I\nasked myself, is this going to disgrace my parents?\" And thank God, my son grew up to be a very\nrespectable, loving son, husband, father. He has now a little girl, my grandchild, our grandchild.\nShe is named after my late son, second name. Her name is Elizabeth Michaela. We call her Eliza-\nla (ph). And she was here shortly before I went on the March of the Living, April 14, 1996. And\nfor the first time, she noticed my number. And she looks at me, she says, she was here Mother's\nDay. During the time she learned a little more, she grew. And she's playing, busy playing, and she\ntakes a look on my arm and she says, \"Barbie, A-B-C's.\" Because she has a book with A-B-C's and\nshe sensed that this is related. She's only two years old. So it's even effecting her. For me, for my\nchildren, even for my grandchildren, it's too late. They will never know the joy of having\ngrandparents and Aunts and Uncle, they didn't know. But hopefully its not going to be too late for\nothers. And I want to finish with a very inspiring story. Remember that I repeated many times that\nmy grandmother's proverb, you only have what you give away. In 1984, I received a letter from a\nperson that I didn't even know. Ida Jervis (ph), , Washington. And I opened the\nletter and I start reading it and it says, I'm your cousin. I'm named after the same great-\ngrandmother, . I was four years old when my family left Poland and\nI'm sure that you will appreciate this. And I'm looking, she send me a photograph of my\ngrandmother and her son. And I thanked her. She invited me to come and visit. Really not\nknowing what to expect, a survivor, how I'm going to act? Am I going to be reacting normal, am I\nbeing all broken up, or whatever. And I came and there was another relative who knew my mother\nbecause they were cousins and she left shortly before the war. And she's telling me that every year\nfor many years now, they have a family reunion, because this cousin was\nand she came with her sister and they started this because people lived in different\nplaces. And they invited me to come with my family. We went. From not having any relatives\nhere, all of sudden I had more than 130, 140 relatives. And until this day, whenever we can we go\nfor Thanksgiving reunion. We are close. And my cousins speak with price, my cousin, every\noccasion, my cousins. They have family. So, because my grandmother send this picture away from\nEurope, this picture is now returned to me and I realized now I can tell you what you can give away,\nyou still have it. After I lost everything in the Holocaust. My home, my family, my community,\nmy earthly possessions, six years of my life and went through a living Hell. I found out, when I had\nlost everything material, that I have spiritual things to give. The Nazis hated me but they couldn't\nstop me from loving people, from believing in God, and from caring and wanting to help. And we\ncertainly have what we give away. We can give up, for over 20 years I've been giving away stories,\nabout the Holocaust, about my family. Many people tell me, I know you because your grandmother\nand parents, like they would be mine. And I still can give away. We can give knowledge, a poem,\nlove, compassion. What you are doing, to give away typed, to record this here, it's the spiritual\nthings that nobody can take away. And the result, passing them onto the next generations. The\nresult is passing them onto any person, older, young, stranger or family. When we do that, then\nlong after we are gone they remain. Because Anne Frank wrote a diary. She is gone and her diary\nis going to live on. And we can always give away kind words and good deeds. No matter how poor\nor rich we are. How educated or not. And this is what is important. This is the lesson of the\nHolocaust. Now you understand why I felt it's important to talk about my family. They gave me\nunconditional love. Showed me, my mother's experience and I, many times when I think, if she\ncould love me so, so much a stranger, how much more did she love me? And that gives me, makes\nme feel like I'm worthwhile. And this is very important.",

        "Answer: This is one of my poems that I have written. It's called \"The Silent Voice'. It is dedicated\nto all those who's voices have been silenced forever in the Holocaust from 1933 to 1945. I wrote\nthis poem May 11, 1980.\nWhen ages of civilization crumble to dust\nAnd death is raging supreme\nWhen the Devil is crowned by the power of deceit\nThen freedom is a far away dream.\nWhen all that you loved is taken from you\nAnd you are stripped to the bare bone\nWhen all moral boundaries and laws are broken\nThen you are in Hell with Satan alone.\nWhen Jews are depicted as sub-human, as vermin\nAnd brute force and evil prevail\nWhen Nazi doctors turn children to corpses\nThen all logic and reason fails.\nWhen the whole world remains dead silent\nWith the exception of just a few\nThen they grant Satan license and opportunity\nTo murder in the gas chambers a God-loving Jew.\nWhen man and woman are kept apart\nAnd new life is not conceived\nWhen there is no sound of laughter or song\nHow can God by man be perceived?\nWhen mass murder of the Jews becomes legal\nUnder the banner of an ideology or God's sacred name\nThen its not the victims but the nazi murderers who did not resist Satan and defile God's name.\nWhen living skeletons are marching at gunpoint\nThrough the gate of Auschwitz in long columns of five, cold, starved, forced to hard labor\nWhat power on earth gave them the strength to survive?\nWhen all heads are shaved, all human rights denied\nAnd all wear the same kind of striped dress\nWhen to worship God becomes a crime\nThen the whole world is in a very terrible mess.\nWhen Hitler's dreams become a reality\nAnd the nazi's send Jews to the left and to the right\nThen such men are not ruled by God's divine power\nBut by their own burning ambition for power and might.\nWhen the so-called superior Arian nazi race used all their knowledge, technology and skill\nTo murder 6 million Jews merely for being born Jewish\nThat I don't believe was God, but Hitler's demonic will.\nThat explains a lot to us.",
        "A: My legal name is Itka Zygmuntowicz. I was named after my maternal great-grandmother Itka\nwho was also born in Poland. And my family name, my parents name, was Cim-mo-nella-simon\n(ph). My family use to call me Yit-cola (ph) In-de-yum-fa-yetska (ph), a name which I\nlike to be called. I was born April 15, 1926 during Passover, the Jewish holiday celebrating\n. I was the oldest of three siblings. I was born in a small town, Chair-han-off (ph)\nPoland, located about 90 kilometers north of Warsaw. At the time when the Nazis came in, I was\n13 years old and the population of our hometown, Chair-han-off (ph) Poland was about 15,000. A\nlittle less than half of that was Jewish. My family consisted at that time of my parents,\nHymen, my little brother Soo-lick (ph), my little sister Zee-sil (ph) and my maternal\nwidowed grandmother, . My ancestors on my mother's side came to\nPoland from Germany around the 16\" century. Four generations were still alive and each one had a\nlot of children because they came from an orthodox background. So my grandmother was one of\nseven siblings. My mother was one of seven siblings. My Aunt who lived also in Chair-han-off\n(ph) had also seven children. My other Uncle had three children. They all had, the younger ones\nhad less because we didn't have enough opportunity before the war to have more children. So we\nhad a very large family. I feel that both my parents and my grandmother were my first teachers and\nmy first role models. I remember when I was a little girl, my grandmother used, who was an\nextremely religious woman, observant woman, at home we only spoke Yiddish. We observed the\nJewish laws, customs and traditions. And my grandmother was wearing a shaytle (ph), in Yiddish\nits called, and it's called a wig in English, but not to beautify herself but for religious purposes. For\nmy grandmother religion was not just a belief, it was a way of life which effected the way she\nbehaved, the way she dressed, the way she taught us. And I remember that every morning when I\nwould get up my grandmother would say with me the prayers and in the evening she would say with\nme the prayers. She used to give me coins to put in the push-ka (ph), which is called her charity\nbox, and she would tell me, \"Yit-cola (ph), to help those who are less fortunate than we are is our\nmitzvah (ph), our commandment.\" I remember one time I was still a preschooler, didn't know one\ncoin from another, and a poor man came to our door and asked my grandmother for alms. And my\ngrandmother gave me some change, some coins, I had no idea the value of it but I looked in my\nhand and I said, \"Grandma, so much money?\" And my grandmother said, \"My child, you only have\nwhat you give away.\" I questioned my grandmother's proverb because I couldn't understand it,\nbeing so little, how can you give away something and still have it? So my grandma began with a\nsmile and says, \"Yit-cola (ph), I only give what God and my parents have given me. I'm not giving\nmine.\" This is how she felt. And she taught me lots of Yiddish songs, told me lots of stories. I\ncame from a family of story-tellers. And since, at that time, technology was not developed so much\nso, and my grandmother had lots of children. In fact, when Germany invaded Poland, my\ngrandmother had five married children, 21 great-children and one great-grandchild. Only one\ngranddaughter, which I'm going to speak about a little later, her name was also Yit-cola (ph). I was\neight years old when she emigrated to Palestine in 1934, to get married with somebody who was,\nwithout her boyfriend, that she met also in Poland, Check-han-off (ph), who was from the same city,\nthe same, and he left a little earlier, so she went there to marry him. And I remember that the whole\nfamily was gathered and everybody was crying and saying, \"God knows if we will see each other\nagain.\" And my grandmother, who was a woman of very deep faith, tried to comfort us and she\nsaid, \"Yit-cola (ph), , don't cry. With God all things are possible.\" I\nalways admired my grandmother's strength because she lived through World War One. She lost a\nbrother, she lost her husband, she lost two of her children, that was before the Holocaust, and she\nlost a granddaughter. But she never lost her unshakable faith in God. And she always believed and\nshe never questioned. And it seemed to me the more she suffered, the more she believed and the\nkinder she was, so she was a wonderful role model for me. And she lived with us from the day I\nwas born. And she was the only one in my family who was privileged to die a natural death shortly\nafter Germany invaded Poland. From early childhood on my parents and grandmother stressed to\nus children the meaning and importance of , which in English means\nhumanness. Whenever I would do something that didn't measure up to the yardstick of\n, they never screamed at me, they didn't hit me, but they would explain to me why it's\nwrong, and usually they would say, \"Yit-cola (ph), its not .\" Tuse to cringe when\nthey said this here because I knew that they disapproved and eventually I started to view myself\nthrough that yardstick. You know, when I did something I felt always will my parents approve?\nBut they also, what they did also is that they, when I did something good they used to praise me.\nAnd I really felt that they loved me unconditionally and that was a wonderful gift. But they were\nstrict with me. When I was already a school girl, I remember in Poland was very cold winters and\nsome of the kids, and we were wearing old wool socks, stockings I mean, and I don't even\nremember how they use to hold up but I remember they were always rolling up, they were like\nyou know and the kids didn't like it. So a few kids put on knee socks and I wanted to\nwear knee socks too. So I remember that I asked my parents, can I put on the knee socks? And\nthey said, \"Yit-cola (ph), its too cold\". And I was naughty and I figured I'm not going to start to\nconvince them, I felt I'm not going to be cold, , so what did I do? I went in\nand I put the knee socks underneath my stockings and I went to school. My father often used to\ncome to the school yard because he had actually two kinds of, first we were in the dairy business,\nlike wholesale dairy business, but he was with a partner and obviously I don't know why, whether\nthey, like the partnership dissolved, and then he started to work in photography and picture framing.\nSo he used to travel sometimes and whenever he would come home, or before he left, if I wasn't\nhome, the school wasn't far to drop in and sometimes even bring me some goodies or something,\njust to see me. So that particular morning, I went to school and it was recess and some of the kids\nstarted to say, \"Yit-cola (ph), your father is here.\" And I didn't know what to do. I was wearing the\nknee socks. And my father looked at me, and I'll never forget for as long as I live, that look, and he\nsaid, \"Yit-cola (ph), I feel very and disappointed in you. Because everybody can make\na mistake, but when a person lies, he deliberately deceives you and this is not and\nI'm very disappointed.\" And I felt so terrible and I started to cry and ask forgiveness, so he fixed me\nup and said, I was still not so old yet, and he said to me, I'll never forget it, \"Yit-cola (ph),\neverybody makes a mistake but only a fool makes twice the same. And in everything there is a\nlesson. So I hope that you have learned, that you cannot lie without becoming a liar and helping\nother people.\" The reason I am sharing this story is because I found out later when the Nazis came\nin, when everything was deception, how important it is to speak the truth and not to lie, and you\nknow how justice is important. I remember one time I was walking home from school alone and a\nbunch of kids that I didn't know, and who did not know me, attacked me both verbally and\nphysically. I tried to free myself but the circle closed around me and I felt punches coming all over.\nAnd I couldn't, it was both the physical pain and the emotional because that was my first encounter\nwith an incident like this here, with anti-Semitism. And I couldn't understand why. Why are they\nso angry with me? Why do they hate me so much? I was too young to understand it and I came\nhome crying bitterly. Usually I was not a cry baby and my mother saw that something serious must\nhave happened, she was home. And she asked me, \"Yit-cola (ph), what's happened?\" You'll see\nlater why those things are important, because of the values.",
        "A: What happened. I related to her the whole story. And she did not say a single word, she just\ntook me lovingly in her arms and she tried to comfort me. After I finally quieted down and stopped\ncrying, she looked at me and she asked me, \"Yit-cola (ph), and what did you do?\" And I was\nshocked. I said, \"Nothing.\" And my mother looked , She said, \"Well my\nchild, then you have nothing to cry about. Your does not depend on how others\ntreat you but on how you treat others.\" And I remember my family taught me that my\ndoes not depend on how others treat me but how I treat others, which had a tremendous\nimpact on me up to this date. Because they taught me how never to held others, how not to shame\nor held others because its not . But they never taught me, what should I do\nwhen I am held, how should I respond? So what I used to do, I use to cry. Because I knew I cannot\nheld anybody and I cannot, and another thing which they taught me, is that no one can break my\nspirit as long as I don't do something evil. As long as I don't do something wrong. So they actually\nvery much stressed , Yiddish , . I received\nboth, like I said at home we spoke Yiddish but in school we spoke Polish and I had also, I went to\nBant-tee-os-kov (ph), which was a Jewish and Hebrew school. My little brother actually started at\nage three. My parents were both culturally and religiously Jewish but they were not orthodox. But\nin those days, not orthodox was more than today, just like because we observed all the holidays, we\nhad in our home, and we lived accordingly to the Jewish teachings and customs and\ntraditions. Because my mother was the only one of my grandmother's children who didn't wear a\nshaytal (ph), who didn't wear a wig, because my mother was a very artistic person. She had a\nbeautiful voice and I remember still how she used to sing to me, teach me Yiddish songs. Because\nbefore my mother was married, she belonged to a Jewish drama group and she use to play in the\nYiddish Theater. And at that time, the Yiddish Theater used to be the , like a\nregular theater but they had that in the fire house, you know? Where the firemen lived, so they\nwould allow them there. But after she was married and she had a family she would do it only for\ncharity. So my parents very often used to take me to the theater and my mother belonged to a\nliterary group. She was more, she was very artistic. If she would have had the opportunity then she\nwould have done much more, but unfortunately. And I think that she instilled in me a love for\nliterature, she use to read aloud and tell stories, because as I said, my grandmother had lots of\ngrandchildren and children. Except for one son and one cousin, you know the cousin that left in\n1934, my cousin Yitle Pash-o-vick (ph), and one of my Uncles who left when he was 18 years old, I\nnever knew him. I knew him only through photographs and through letters that the family used to\nget from England, London. Because that's where he married and he lived. So the whole family\nlived in Poland and we used to be a very close-knit family. So we got together and because there\nwas not, as I had mentioned before, technology, so parts of, when we would get together they used\nto, the family used to sit and tell stories, reminisce, you know? And everybody thought that I don't\neven pay attention and I was just sitting in a corner and listen and take in all these stories. Another\ntime also that I heard a lot of stories is that in Poland, Chair-han-off (ph), where we lived, there was\nonly one Synagogue. But there was the , like they call it, like the study house and a\nlot of the boys who came to study there, to the Yit-shiva (ph), some of them were from other cities\nso they used to be on Friday or on holidays, my father would always bring home, in the Hebrew its\ncalled , or guests. And then there would be conversation at the table and they used to\nask him questions and he would tell adventures and stories. So it was, and one thing also, that after\nmy mother was married she didn't work so I always had my mother and my grandmother home,\nwhich was a great influence. I remember another story which also had a very great influence on me,\nis that we didn't have running water or electricity in our home. And winter, to heat the house, we\ncooked on an iron stove, and to heat the house it used to be a tile oven, which reached from the\nfloor, most people in Poland had those, and they used to, they were able to open wells, you put the\nwood to heat it, to bake potatoes and bake apple in there sometimes, but mostly the winter time this\nwould be the source of heat, that heated the house. So when they came on the holidays and\n, they would sit around the oven and tell these stories. And so I heard a lot of stories\nand I knew a lot about Jewish life. And I was always, when I started to go to school, one of my\nworst subjects was history. Because the way it was presented, it was just to me a bunch of dates,\nlong ago, and a lot of places. But it was not presented as relevant to our life and I had no idea\nbefore the Holocaust how history effects our lives, because history is made by people and it effects\npeople. And I was a creative child. I loved to sing, I loved to write and to read, I was forever doing\nthis. And I was dreaming that when I, after I finished public school, that I going to continue to have\nmore formal education, that I'm going to become a writer. Even as a young girl I used to write a lot.\nAnd I remember my father always was so proud of me, my parents, my grandmother, and my father\nused to take me a lot with him so when we went someplace he always said, \"Yit-cola (ph), recite a\npoem.\" And I was blessed until this day to God with a good memory and I've learned the poems\nand I learned lots of songs, both at home. And another source of, I remember that it's almost funny,\nthat there used to people who would go in the courtyard and sing and play instruments and some\nhad wonderful voices and played well, and people would throw them down money. So I remember\nonce I was going home, it was on a Friday, I was going home from school. And those people\nplayed in our yard and I always wanted to learn all the songs, so they sung a new song. I caught\nmost of it but not all the words for the first time, so I figured they probably will not sing it again in\nthe same courtyard so I followed them. And I got so involved that I completely forgot that its\nFriday and the family is going to be ready, the sha-bot (ph) was observed very strictly. And I\nremember I came home, the candles were lit already, and my father was sitting because the sha-bot\n(ph) was very strictly observed, and here I came in and my mother looked at me, and she said, \"Yit-\ncola (ph), quickly. Go in and wash up. Come to sha-bot (ph).\" And I was so grateful that she didn't\nscream at me or anything. And I remember the holidays and sha-bot (ph), but like I mentioned\nbefore, I was born during Passover, so Passover was my birthday and we always faithfully, every\nyear, we observed Passover. And it was so different than it is now because every single object of\nthe house was taken out in the courtyard. Dishes were changed. And at that time, I remember, we\ndidn't have regular mattresses like today, we had some burlap sacks and it was with straw, it was put\nin the, they changed the straw. And paint the house and wash every object. It was more for\ncleanliness, it was also because of the holiday, so Passover was both a physical and spiritual\ncleansing and I remember, the reason why I speak about Passover, is because it 1s very, it is\ncoincidental, because I was born on Passover and I was liberated on Passover, during Passover, the\nliberation. And I was thinking that before, when we sat at the , and we're talking about\nslavery, talking about the Israelites, the slavery, about the plagues, about starvation, I couldn't\nunderstand this here. Because up until then, I was never starved. I never had any personal tragedy.\nMy faith in God was not tested, it wasn't a , and I couldn't understand all those things. And\nI remember, now when I think back, I said, I'm not surprised that people do not understand what we\nsuffered because only somebody who suffered can, maybe they can understand but not the same\nway. They cannot relate because, to give you an example, if someone, God forbid, has a terrible\nillness then when he talks with somebody who 1s healthy at that time, the healthy person could talk\nabout the future and relates different to life, sees life differently, and this is here. So, in my, it never\nentered my mind that one day I will suffer like this here. That my people will suffer like this here.\nAnd I remember also another incident, its like I started to tell you, we didn't have heat but, we didn't\nhave running water and we didn't have electricity in our home, so we...",
        "A: Yeah, that was not because we were of poverty. This was because in the small ;\nnobody in the small had it at that time. So, in fact, when I went now back to Poland,\nthey still have, some people have outhouses and things, you know? But its so much more modern,\nits more in the larger city. But at that time it was common, you didn't know\nanything different because I remember, my Aunt lived, my mother's sister, lived in Warsaw. When\nmy family took me I came home and told all my friends, I was excited, she had a toilet and you\npulled the string from the ceiling and I said, \"It was like a miracle to me.\" So it was because this\nwas, I'm describing the world the way I knew it and this all influenced, you know? Because when\nthere was not water in the house, so we had a water carrier who would bring in water. We didn't\nhave like today ready-made foods and, or you could go into the kosher butcher like today and buy a\nchicken. At that time we used to go to the market which was the market place was the place where\nJews and Gentiles had the most relations, was the most involved, because they would bring\nlivestock, chickens, turkey and cows and they would bring vegetable and fruits. The Jewish people\nwould bring what they made, shoes and boots and clothes. So that was the exchange because that\nwas the most time when Jewish people intermingled with the Gentiles. And so those things were,\nthe life was different and it influenced differently also. But going back now to the not having\nelectricity, even though we didn't have electricity we had a light, from a nuft (ph) its called in\nPolish, petroleum, you know?",
        "A: Kerosene, yes, I forgot the word, kerosene. So we had a kerosene lamp. And still we would\nalways sit and read and it was very, education was extremely important. And so I remember that we\ndidn't have a refrigerator. We didn't have all the modern appliances because at that time nobody had\nthem in our ;\n[end of side 1 of tape 1] So of course we didn't have any, we didn't have electricity, we didn't have\nany refrigerator. And we used to store food in the root cellar. We called it root because, besides\nholding the perishable food we would put in there for the winter, sometimes my father would go to\nthe country and buy like a whole sack of potatoes, carrots, onions, for the winter. And we also\nwould keep there in the winter the perishable food, you know, when we cooked something.\nSometimes when it was very cold, I remember my mother used to put it on the window sill, outside\non the window sill, but mostly in the root cellar. So one time, in the root cellar it was dark. You\nhad to, you opened, there was a square in the kitchen floor with a ring, you pulled up the ring and\nthere was a long ladder. It wasn't built in, 1t was put in, and you had to walk this, this ladder down,\nit was dark. A dirt floor. No windows. Cold. It smelled wonderful with all the different kinds of\nvegetable things. But it was dark and I was, as I mentioned before, I was only 13 when the war\nbroke out and this was earlier, so I was afraid to go down. And my mother noticed that I am afraid.\nShe said, \"Lit a candle.\" She gave me the candle to my hand, and she tell me, she waved to me, for\nme, and she said, \"Go Yit-cola (ph), go. God is in the root cellar too.\" And I loved her, I trusted\nher, and I knew. I understood that if there would be danger for me she wouldn't send me because\nshe was very protective of me. In fact, I was never away one single day in my, until the Nazis came\nin, alone. I was always with the family. So I walked down and I brought up the butter. And\nafterwards I wasn't so afraid anymore of the dark root cellar. For two reasons. First of all, because I\nremembered my mother's words, \"Go, Yit-cola (ph), God is 1n the root cellar.\" And secondly, for\nmyself I thought, if I could do it once I can do it again. And so at home it was warm, it was a\nwonderful world. My grandmother was, like I mentioned, she would not permit me to take a bite of\nfood without saying , which means a special prayer. And always stressed the\nimportance. Yiddish guide, the mental guide to her was . And another thing which I\ndo really appreciate a lot about my grandmother is, that whenever I did for her a little added. She\nnever took me for granted. She would many times over say, \"Oh my , God Bless you\nand thank you\", and she would make me feel so good. And one time I said, \"Grandma, its just a\nlittle thing.\" I didn't call her grandma, I called her ; for grandmother.\nAnd I said, \"It's just a little thing.\" And my grandmother would smile and she would say, she\nalways, when I asked her something she had such a beautiful, warm smile, she said, \"Yes my child.\nBut kindness and caring are not little things.\" And the reason why the is later I found\nout how much those values helped to shape me. And also of course there was the influence from\nfriends. In fact, I used to have one friend because where we lived, we lived at two addresses. I was\nborn 1n one house and then we moved. And the first house, the entrance was from the back and I\nremember like today, there was a huge field and I used to play there. And one of my girlfriends was\na Polish little girl, her name was Helenka (ph). I cannot remember any longer the last name, but we\nused to play a lot together. And I remember that she used to come like in the morning when it\nsnowed, winters were cold, so I don't know how its called in English but I would go out and lay\ndown on the snow and make a...",
        "A: An angel, you know? And with Helenka (ph) we would, you know? And then I remember like\ntoday, I was always very happy child and I was playing. And I remember when I was little and I\nwent to the field and I felt such a sense of , SO I would flop my hands like a feldas (ph)\nand pretend that I'm a bird and fly. And later, it never entered my mind that one day all this going to\nbe gone. That I will not have this anymore. And then, everything all of a sudden changed when the\nNazis came in.",
        "A: We, there were not too many, not too many. We had some non-Jewish, and we had a good\nrelationship to them. Actually, I personally, the only serious incident of anti-Semitism was when I\nwas walking home. And another thing which also, but that was not, it was verbal, it was not\nattacked. I once heard a non-Jewish child saying to me, \"The houses are yours but the streets are\nours.\" And at that time it didn't reflect, but I could, also when I was thinking about it I said, \"What\ndo you mean? My family lives here already for, my ancestors came here in the 1600's. We are\ncitizens. We do everything. And yet, we're not looked as equals?\" You know, you sense a little bit.\nBut I personally didn't sense it so much. I knew more about it from going to Hebrew school,\nknowing about the poems from my grandmother and my parents, use to tell how it was. I also knew\ngood things also about some neighbors, but we had pretty decent relationships. It wasn't at that\ntime, but that was after like, after Pew-suit-ski (ph), Mal-shall-vic Pew-suit-ski (ph) died, things\nstarted to change. And you know, we were not treated, we were treated like second-class citizens in\nmany ways because when we wanted to go to higher studies, it started like a few years before the\nHolocaust, you couldn't go, Jewish people couldn't go to the university, we were not allowed.",
        "A: What year? I would say like in 1937 or 1938 it started to get a little more because I don't\nremember the exact year that Pew-suit-ski (ph) died, but things were a lot better. Though the\ngovernment officially didn't have any law against Jews, or sanctions, but there were many types of\nthings I remember from the stories that I heard, the family tell and from other people, and from\nhistory. That I know that the Jewish people were, we were on the .",
        "A: At the time? No. I didn't know much of politics, yes. I was like I said a creative child. I was\nmore interested in writing and in playing with the kids and doing art work and singing, I loved to\nsing since I was a child. And my mother taught me, not just my mother but both my parents\nbecause they used to take me to the theater, many songs and things.",
        "A: Maybe they talked but I don't remember this in particular. That didn't, you know, like I said, I\nwas only 13 years old when the war broke out. And another thing when I was a child, here a 13\nyear old child knows a lot about her body, knows, you know? Because I wasn't brought up in the\nenvironment and my grandmother was so orthodox, so it was more modest and you didn't know\nmuch about sex, you know? And we didn't talk too much about those things at that time. And I\nremember that in our city there was a girl, her name was Rosa Loberta (ph) and she was a leader\nfrom . And because some of my friends who were somewhat older along\nthere, to tell you the truth, I knew it\u2019s a Zionistic organization. I didn't understand yet exactly the, I\ndidn't know too much about politics to be very honest with you. So I wanted to belong too. And in\nPoland everybody belongs to orthodox, to some different organizations, but practically everybody\nbelonged to the organizations, so I wanted to belong to . And I\nremember she took me to one meeting and Rosa Loberta (ph) was there and I met her and I said to\nher, \"Rosa, I would like to belong to the meeting.\" And this was about a year before the Nazis came\nin. And she said, \"Yit-cola (ph), you have to wait because it starts from\n\"And when came I no longer could do it. And later, I don't know\nif you know about Rosa Loberta (ph), she was...",
        "A: Yes. She was a very happy person and from what everybody told me a tremendous leader.\nVery, very much for Israel. She was very much involved in Zionist and she was hoping that, very\nmuch involved. You know, the older children, because I was and I think because of my\ngrandmother I didn't, I was more in the religious influence, but I also was lucky because I had all\nother influence from my parents who took me to the theaters, who took me to Jewish plays and\nevery summer we would go to the country and , cousins, from Warsaw, because I\nhad cousins there, I had cousins, the , SO we would get together.\nAnd I remember like today, I used to be so happy to go with my mother and she was very\naffectionate, she was very warm. And I remember, I'm not a thinker, but my mother, which also\nmade a great influence, that she instilled in me a love for literature and for singing and everything.\nIs that when we lived in Poland, we didn't have closets like we have now. We had what they called\na French amour' (ph) and it was a wooden chest that reached almost from the floor to the ceiling and\nit had two doors. Facing the chest, the right-hand side was wider, it was used for the wardrobe, and\nthe left side was for linen and the very highest it had hats of my grandmother's and my mother's,\nhats lying there. And for some reason, when I was younger, this was still a pre-schooler, this was\nalways locked, this side of the wardrobe. And I couldn't understand why, I was so curious and I\nused to try to play all kinds of games to try to guess what is in that chest. And I used to think,\nmaybe a treasure, maybe a skeleton, I even used to went so far as to think that maybe I am adopted\nand they don't want me to know that I am adopted and they are hiding the papers. It was a whole\nsource of curiosity for me. And I remember one day my mother said, \"Yit-cola (ph), please come.\nCome here. I want to show you something.\" She took out the key and she opened the chest. And I\nhad like two kinds of emotions. In one way, I was burning with curiosity to see what is in the chest\nthat was constantly closed. And on the other hand, I was frightened, what I'm going to find there?\nWhat is there? And she opened the chest and she said, \"Look Yit-cola (ph).\" And it was a whole\nchest full of books, all leather-bound books. And she took out a book, pointed to the closet, she\nsaid, \"Yit-cola (ph), when you will learn how to read, you will be with the greatest minds. You can\nsit right here in Chair-hon-off (ph), you will see the world through great poets and writers and you\nwill travel all over the world.\" And she took out a book, she took me on her knee, and she started to\nread. And this became a daily ritual to which I looked forward. And I was quite young when I\nknew a lot of Yiddish literature and Yiddish plays and poetry because my mother never read to me\nlittle children's stories, she started with this grown up stuff. And one story that I wanted to relate,\nwhich was written by , a Yiddish writer, it was called\n, Bunchos (ph) of the Silent. I remember many stories, but this\nstory I'm relating to you because I've been thinking about it most of the time when I was in\nAuschwitz. And the story is about a young child, about a man actually who was called Bunchos\n(ph), which means silent. And this man, when he was a little child, lost\nhis mother and became an orphan, only had his father. At the age of 13, the father remarried and\ntook a very cruel woman who abused the little boy. She would eat well but she would starve him.\nShe made him chop wood barefoot in the winter. He never had a new change of clothes. They\ndidn't send him to school. Didn't have a friend. But no matter what she, he was constantly lonely,\nbut he never complained, not even to his father. And one time, in the middle of the winter, in a\ndrunken stupor, his father threw him out in the middle of the night, dragged him out by the hair. He\npicked himself up and he left and he was going from place to place. He wandered into a big city\nand for no reason known to him he was put in jail. And then he was, for the same unknown reason\nto him, he was let go. But he was still silent. Never complained. Then the story relates how he\nsuffered also, starvation, looking for job, and worse than the job was looking for the job, and then\npeople wouldn't pay him. He was constantly abused but Buncho (ph) was always silent. And then\nhe married a woman who already had a child. And it was a little boy, a baby. And she left him with\nthe child and he raised the child, when the boy was 15 years old, he threw him out from the house.\nBut Buncho (ph) was again silent. And it relates the whole story, a beautiful story. It kept me so in\nsuspense. I remember it today. Actually when I learned to read Yiddish, which I learned to read\nwell, I read many of the books which my mother had in that chest. And the reason why she kept it\nlocked is because I was the oldest child and she was afraid that the little children might damage her\nbooks. Later, when we were older, the chest was open when we learned to respect it. But its just\nthe values that she had. So this man was constantly abused and later somebody run him over with a\nhorse and wagon. And even in the hospital where people are allowed to complain, he was still\nsilent. And in silence he lived and in silence he died. And after he was buried they put a piece of\nwood and a marker on his grave and the wind blew away the marker and the gravedigger's wife\nfound it and used it to light the, to heat the stove. So he didn't even have a grave or anything. And\nthen, but it was different, the writer says, in the other world, the world where there is justice. And\nwhen he came up, they told him, \"Buncho (ph), here in heaven everything is yours. Whatever you\nwant. Pick, choose.\" And he couldn't believe it. Why would somebody be so good to him in the\nother world where they were so cruel to him here? And yet, Buncho (ph) didn't complain. Not to\nman, not to God, never, he was envious that somebody had more. So finally they said, \"Buncho\n(ph), what would you like?\" And he couldn't believe it. And finally he said, \"Well, your\nExcellency, all I would like is every morning for breakfast a hot roll with butter.\" And when I was,\nlater during the Nazis, I was thinking very much about this story because I realized why he was\nsilent. He had no choice. And also, what would we give for a piece of bread. So the literature, and\nalso another thing which I often think about this story, is that Paris (ph) who was a great Yiddish\nwriter, that he wrote about one man and this has become a Yiddish classic. This book is in English\nstill and its beautiful. I didn't go into all the details because it would be too long, but the basic thing\nis, the cruelty. And when he says here that they look, why was he silent? He didn't have to be\nsilent, he should have cried out. But when the Nazis came in, I realized that I became like Buncho\n(ph) the Silent. When Germany invaded Poland, the first thing of the hometown, the first thing I\nremember, because at that time we lived in the other house already. And our house was strict\n, which was near Warsaw Street, which was the main street. And as soon as we\ncame out, this was almost in the corner, was a large house and they had a cellar, they had like big\ncellars. So when the air raids was, we went to hiding, into hiding. And even there, sitting there, my\nmother tried to calm us down with telling us stories. She was such a wonderful story-teller and she\nknew so much literature and so many plays. And then, when they just came in, we were still\nallowed to move from place to place, so people started to run. People from Warsaw came to small\ntowns. Other people came to different places. And my father's entire family, his sisters, three\nsisters, one natural sister and two half-sisters, because his father died when he was a young boy, and\nmy father was born in Pull-tos (ph), Poland. So they still lived with the children and, I think, their\nnieces and nephews, they lived in Pull-tos (ph). And we didn't know what's happened to them\nbecause, so my father was going to go, I remember today the conversation between my parents, he\nsaid, \"Let's go to Pull-tos (ph). My sisters are gone.\" Because both parents, like, I never knew my\ngrandparents on my father's side, so he held the responsibilities being the oldest child, to take care of\nthem. But we didn't know, we didn't go. And then, when they took Warsaw, we could no longer go\nfrom place to place. That's when the Nazis begun their systematic destruction.",
        "A: The soldiers came in. There was bombing. And, I just told you, we went into hiding. And then\nwhen the bombing stopped, I'll tell you what my grandmother did. It's almost ironic. My\ngrandmother lived through World War One, so she remembered a different kind of Germany.\nBecause she remembered a Germany not at war against civilian people, women and children\nespecially targets, and Jewish people. So she baked a cake and she said, \"Yit-cola (ph), take it out\nto the poor soldiers that are away from home.\" She was a very compassionate woman. She had\nnothing to do with political , and she asked me to bring it out. So later when they, I think\nit was towards the end of, they came in October, I mean September 1, 1939. At that time was about\n3,300,000 Jews in Poland. Ninety-percent have perished. And most of those, the ten percent who\nsurvived, mostly survived in the USSR Because there were no ghettos. There was no\nconcentration, no gas chambers, you know, concentration camps with gas chambers. They also\nhave suffered.",
        "A: So, anyhow. When the Nazis came in to the other cities, that was the last time that I saw my\nrelatives. All the other relatives that lived in the other towns because we could no longer travel\nfrom place to place. They started by taking up the spiritual and the community leaders, the\nintelligencia (ph). Some Polish people too. And they took them away some, they shot, the ones\nthey took away, I didn't see what they did with them so I can only bear witness for what I saw. And\nthey started to destroy the Synagogues, the Holy Scriptures. They confiscated all our businesses.\nWe didn't have, in Check-hon-off (ph) a business. My father was, like I said, I told you before.\nAnd they started to put on curfews. We were not allowed to congregate in large groups. I could no\nlonger, we could no longer go to school, all schools were closed. All social Temples were closed.\nWe had to wear a yellow star. We were not allowed to walk on the pavement, just in the street.\nAnd we had to give up, everyday when we're told this is the worst, something worst happened.\nEveryday they made new laws. And we were not allowed any longer to observe the Jewish laws\nbecause they burned, not openly, they had to do it in hiding.",
        "A: Well the burnings, they started to burn books. I told you, my mother valued so much book and\nits still such a love for me, for books, and here they started to burn the Holy, all the books that was\nfrom the Yi-shiv-as (ph) and all the books from the Synagogue, in the Synagogue, they burned\ndown everything. So they started to just destruction right away, and curfews, and we were not\nallowed to congregate in large groups, you know, for religious people, to go for ;\nwhich is you have to have 10 people to have for the prayers. So all those things were, actually\nreligious people suffered the most. They started to, when they saw elderly men, most of the people,\nmy father didn't have a beard, he was clean-shaven, but so many other people did. So they laughed,\nthey started to pull out the beard or they would shave off half a beard. They started to torture, to\nmock. Because to, they did whatever they wanted. They had all legal rights to do those things.\nAnd then they confiscated the business, they looted the merchandise. They started to ration the food\nand started starvation. And also we had to, they would grab people to do the work in the street.\nAnd after a whole day's work, they would come home and would have to stay in long lines to get a\nsmall ration, a very small ration. So right away we started to starve. Couldn't go to school. And in\nother country the most important right is the right to protest, to speak up. But you\ncouldn't. So that's when I was thinking a lot about starvation, about Buncho (ph) the Silent. That\nwe had to be silent, you know, in order to survive. And then something happened which effected\nme very much personally, and my mother. They asked us to give up all our valuables, gold and\nvaluables, so we become impoverished and we had to do forced labor. So one day, and also there\nwas a law, that the Jewish people, for the Germans to associate with Jewish people was\nbecause they singled us out as an inferior race. And we were not allowed to have\nany transactions, not business, not social, not sexual, because for the Nazi and the Jew, if this would\nhappen, it would be punished. And we had a big and one time a man, a civilian, until\nthis day I don't know his name, but I remember the incident very clearly because I was also\ninvolved in it. A man came in and he was selling household articles. Since people, most people\ngave up the money because they didn't want to risk, if they are caught for whatever you did against\nthe law, it was punishable by death. And even without any reason they shot and they killed and they\ntortured. But anyhow, so when he came in a lot of people, just for curiosity, came and looked. And\none man walked by, his name was Cal-fus (ph). He was the owner of the building where I went to\nschool. And he walked by too and he came in. And my mother all of a sudden realized that if\nsomebody is going to see us standing and having any business transaction with somebody who 1s\nnot Jewish, and we didn't know whether he was Polish or whether he was German, because there\nwas a lot of , that is somebody who is of German descent but he didn't live\nin Poland. So she said, she was afraid, so she said, \"Please come into my house.\" She invited\neverybody. And Cal-fus (ph) obviously took a risk and he didn't give away all the money. So he\nbought maybe 90 percent of the merchandise. My mother didn't buy anything. We gave up the\nmerchandise, you know? Maybe he hid a little bit because I remember, but before we came to the\nghetto I remember seeing my mother taking out from her corset, you know women were wearing\ncorsets, and it was like a bone, like a plastic bone, she pulled this out and she made rolls of money\nand she stuffed it in so they could hide it on them, so they must have saved some money but maybe\nshe didn't want to spend it or whatever. But anyhow, the Nazis left, I mean the, Cal-fus (ph) left, the\npeople left and this man, who was selling the merchandise. But it didn't take long, this same man\nbrought the Gestapo into our house and denounced my mother. And they asked my mother, \"Who\nis the man who brought the merchandise, because he told us.\" And that is the first time in my life\nthat I heard my mother lie. She said she didn't know. But she did know who he was. He was not a\npersonal friend so we were not very involved with him, but we knew who Cal-fus (ph) is, I knew\nhim very well because, like I said, I went to school there. So after...\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2",
        "A: So, I was telling you of the story about, when this man who sold the household articles that we\ndidn't know brought the Gestapo to our house and they interrogated my mother. They wanted her to\ntell who Cal-fus (ph) was. And, I'm not sure whether I mentioned this, that this was the first time I\nheard my mother lying. That she said she didn't know, she denied it. So after interrogated for quite\na while, they saw that they cannot get out of her anything. They took her away. The Gestapo took\nher away. I was by that time 13 years old, and I saw already the cruelty, what's going on, they\nstarted many destructions, many people were already killed and tortured. So I was afraid to be\nseparated from my mother. So I run after her. And I was determined, no matter what's going to\nhappen, I'm not going to leave her alone. So they kept on chasing me away. And finally, one of\nthem said, \"Take her too.\" And I was almost happy that they took me too because I think that\nwhatever happened, otherwise I won't even know if they take her away, I want to know what's\nhappened to her. And they brought us to the Gestapo, the station, and they separated us. They took\nmy mother in to a separate room. This, I was not an eye-witness, I was an ear-witness. And, what I\nheard, it sounded like they were beating her and she was screaming. The shouts got louder and\nlouder and after a while it was silent. That's when my heart almost stopped too, because as long as\nshe was screaming, I knew that she's still alive. But when it was silent, I had no longer any\nknowledge, whether she's still alive, whether she's conscious. And what seemed to me like an\neternity, I cannot estimate how long it took, but finally the doors swung open. Two Gestapos, each\nholding her under the armpit, dragging her across the floor. And took me in, to be next. And I\nwanted to see whether my mother, I saw she was bleeding, and I wanted to see whether she 1s still\nalive. So I looked at her, while they took me out, took her out, they took me into the same place.\nAnd she didn't say anything, but she gave me a sign not to say anything. And I loved my mother\nbecause she always loved me so much and I knew what kind of a person she was. So I was, when\nthey started to ask me questions I said, \"I don't know it.\" I lied too. Deliberately. And they started\nto beat me and I was screaming, and my mother heard me scream but she didn't say anything. And\nafter I was beaten quite well, they, because we spoke Yiddish at home, and Yiddish is similar to\nGerman, they understood, that they said, \"Gin-nook (ph)\". Enough.\n, which means maybe we don\u2019t know. Maybe we don't know. And\nthat's when they released us. This story begun in 1939, shortly after Germany invaded Poland. I\ndidn't see anymore Cal-fus (ph). I didn't know what's happened to him. At that time, the Nazis used\nall kinds of techniques. They reversed, you see, Hitler's laws were a reversal of all the Jewish laws.\nWe, in Judaism, in home and in Hebrew school, they taught us that we are all responsible for one\nanother. What they did is that if one person did something wrong, they punished us all. Group\npunishment for individual action. So, and ironically, what was legally ours they took away by force\nand we were punished for trying to keep it or to have it. So I didn't know what's happened to the\nCal-fus (ph) family but what we knew, both my mother and I, is that if we would have told they\nwould have killed the whole family, not just the father. And I'm going to stop here because I don't\nwant to lose the end of this story because this story had a tremendous impact on me. And I'm going\nto skip and come back later to 1939. I'm going now to 1981 when I went to the world gathering of\nJewish Holocaust survivors, okay?",
        "A: And when we came, only Jewish survivors, there was some people before I left that they wanted\nme to be in a documentary, to be a witness in a documentary. And I told them that story. Anyhow,\nwhen we came there, each of us, I'm not going to go into the whole, direct to the story, each of us\ngot a badge and it says, on mine it says, Itka Zygmuntowicz USA. That was all. And as I was\nstanding, this was the last date when we were marched into the courtyard, you know? And\nMenachem Bacon was the President there. And I was overwhelmed with emotion to think from the\ngates of Auschwitz, to come now to the gates of Jerusalem and after so many, more than 2,000\nyears, to have our homeland, and then I understood already what it means to have our homeland,\nthen people cannot tell you, \"The houses are yours but the streets are ours.\" And I was\noverwhelmed. And I was so eager to go to march, and that march as a free person, as a proud Jew,\nbut they asked me not to because they needed me to bear testimony in case I see something or to ask\nquestions. And as the people are marching and I'm standing there, all of a sudden I said to myself,\n\"Can I have a marker or a pen?\" And I wrote on my badge, Fri-mand (ph), Check-hon-off (ph),\nPoland and Auschwitz. I figured in case somebody recognized, you know, walks by, they do not\nrecognize me. I was 13 when the war broke out and now I am an adult. My name has changed.\nWho will know me? And as I stand there, Kentel Vee-che-nya (ph) from Lindstrom, Pennsylvania\n(ph) was bringing the American flag as a gift to Menachem Bacon. And he looked at my badge, he\nsaid, \"You're from Chair-hon-off (ph)?\" And I said, \"Yes, Chair-hon-off (ph).\" And with him\nwalked another man and he said, \"I'm from Chair-hon-off (ph) too.\" And I said, \"Who are you?\"\nAnd he said, \"Cal-hus (ph).\" And I went berserk. I started to cry and to laugh and I was so excited\nand he had the matches, holding the cup, and the people who were interviewing him said, \"Ask him\nfor the address.\" So I asked him for the address and before he gave I said, \"Are you\nthe son or the father?\" Because he looked too young to be the father. He said, \"I'm Cal-hus's (ph)\nson.\" And he gave us a card, he lives in Natan-alia (ph), Israel because after the war he went to\nIsrael, and he married an Israeli-Jewish . And we went there to interview him too. And I\nfound out his father, unfortunately, died in Auschwitz, was murdered in Auschwitz. But he and\nanother brother survived. And both are married and have children and grandchildren. And that's\nwhen I was understood, my grandmother's saying, that you only have what you give away. And\nthat you don\u2019t have to be rich or famous and you can give away , good deed and your\n, and three generations. When I was in 1981, alive because of our sacrifice.\nAnd that's when I learned spiritual resistance, from my mother. And I learned what\nis. What to do with humanness. And now you understand why I was sharing with you\nthe lessons, what my mother said. doesn't depend, and then I'm going back to\n1939, but I felt, I wanted to finish and complete the story so that you will know. Actually, Cal-fus\n(ph) invited us, our family, and there was a tremendous reunion. They took him and made him a\npart of the, you know, the interview. Anyhow, we are back in Chair-hon-off (ph) in 1939. After\nthey took away from us all our freedom, they took away from us all our possessions. In the\nmeantime, my grandmother died. That was before we went to the ghetto. My grandmother was no\nlonger alive. And I was heartbroken because, except for my parents, I have never had as a close\nrelationship with anyone as I had with my parents and with my grandmother. And she had such a\ngreat influence in this, I was heartbroken. But looking back, I am grateful that she did not have to\ngo to what we went through and she died in her own bed and she was buried in Chair-hon-off (ph)\nand is there still. That was already, it was not as open, another kind of funeral that would be\notherwise.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I still said every, in fact, even today, so many years, I still have the\n, It's like in-bred in me. Because I said it every morning when I was a child.\nAnd then, it just...",
        "A: We couldn't observe holidays anymore because, first of all, Jews were not allowed often to pray\nor to go among the Synagogues. We couldn't make a traditional sha-but (ph), there was no food.\nWe lived in constant fear. And I saw, for instance, I think that I mentioned it, the religious people\nsuffered more because they couldn't often and there was starvation. When you, we\ntried as much as we could. I still knew what day it is and we tried as much as we could to keep the\nsha-but (ph), but that was when we were still living in Chair-hon-off (ph). And I actually didn't say\ngood-bye to any of my relatives. Only, from all the family, from all the members, the only person\non my mother's side that I said good-bye was to my grandmother. Because my mother and I was at\nher bed side when she died. And she was clear, her mind was so clear. And I remember that I was\nterribly upset and my mother said something that also was to be a lesson. She said, \"Yit-cola (ph),\n(she said that in Yiddish, of course, because as I said I spoke Yiddish), death teaches us not to take\nfor granted life.\" And we still had, usually you know, according to tradition, the Jewish burial was\nvery important. But later we couldn't have, people couldn't ultimately go and bury so we still, she\nwas still buried in Chair-hon-off (ph).",
        "A: We did, we were able to bury her properly but it was not like a big funeral that she would have\nhad because the children from Warsaw, the children from and all of them, they couldn't\ncome. We just, our family, and the people who were involved. Because from everything, from\nbirth to death, our lives was different than it is now, how it was during the Holocaust. Because, for\ninstance, there was not funeral pyres. There was not, you didn't bury people the same way that is\nhere. And everything was different, on the way the customs were done. Our whole lives changed.\nBefore the Nazis came in, the longest that I ever didn't eat was from one meal to the other. And\nbeing that we have a kosher home and familiar, after meat, eating, you wait six hours. So the\nreligion taught me a lot of discipline too. And later the people who kept kosher could not keep\nkosher, they didn't have food at all. They were starving. So then in the middle of the night. . .",
        "A: At that point there was no meat. There was no meat and we tried as much to keep as we could.\nBut eventually when the hunger tool over you no longer could do it anymore because I remember a\nyoung pupil once of a Rabbi, when I was in Chair-hon-off (ph). Somebody was sick so he said that\nyou're allowed, you don't have to fast if you don't feel good because to preserve your health, that\nwas the first obligation. So all the laws, all the rules that applied before into other times that no\nlonger could be applied here. Because here was just one thing, survival.",
        "A: This is where I'm coming to now. I remember exactly. It was in the middle of the night.\nOctober 15, 1941. We were asleep and we heard, they broke in, the middle of the night. \"All you-\nden rouse.\" All Jews out. And at that point we only, we couldn't, you wake up and you are tired,\noh, the first thing with my mother, grab what she was mostly interested of course, the family should\nget out alive. She took the candlesticks, books, her books. A few books and a couple of bundles\nbecause everybody was constantly having, like a few things, we didn't know from day to day. And\nwe didn't know, where are they taking us? And when I was a child, we use to, I use to play a lot at,\nyou know they have, it was called, a river. I'm trying to, 1s this a river or a lake? Which\nis larger? A lake? A river. A lake is larger, I think, but this was a river. And in this river, we used\nto play as children, I use to go, and there were big trees. In fact, I remember a story when I talk\nabout the river and, I don't know, should I tell it? Which is really, okay. But anyhow, since people\nin this river, people used to bathe and there was like a special, like a place where on sha-but (ph) we\nused to go, they use to call it, you know, to go for a walk. And we would go to the\nriver. And had beautiful moments. And then was a big castle near the river, there was a castle.\nWhen I lived there, it was empty, nobody lived in there. But a beautiful castle. In fact, I was now in\nPoland, it's still there, the castle is still there. I have a photograph of it. So, in the middle of the\nnight, \"All you-den rouse.\" With dogs, rifles, and they chased us out and they took us to the castle\nnear the river. Lee-din-ya (ph) was called the river. And from there they put us on trucks and they\ntook us to the ghetto, Nove\u2019 Mesto, Poland.",
        "A: My parents, my little brother and my little sister. That was all. My Aunt and Uncle and their\nchildren, they were the only ones that I saw still in the beginning, but when they chased us out they\nwere not with us. So like I said, the only person that I said good-bye was my grandmother. The rest\nof the family we didn't know because to the other cities we couldn't even go, but them we would see\noccasionally. But when they chased us out, not until after the war I found out that when they chased\nus out they didn't chase out the whole city, they just chased out part. I don't know whether it was\nthe larger or the smaller but the rest they chased out later, so my Aunt must have been, and her\nfamily with them.",
        "A: I didn't even know that we were, that somebody was left. Because they chased us out in the\nmiddle of the night. We didn't have a chance to talk to anybody. Not until after the war did I find\nthis out.",
        "A: They sent us to other town which was called Nove' Mesto, they changed the names, everything\nwas changed. And Nove' Mesto, where previously lived one family, they put in six, seven and eight\nfamilies. And the ghetto, you know, I don't have to explain to you what a ghetto is, we were\nisolated from the whole city. And it was so terribly crowded. And there, where we lived in was a\nfamily, the family which lived there was called Yat-rack (ph), and when we came there the facilities\nwere not much better, like in ours. And so many families with little children, and everybody wanted\nto be able to go to the stove or use the facilities and everything. So, it was already horrible just\nbeing so crowded. And one time, my mother and father said to us, \"Kindle-left (ph) children, get\ntogether the few belongings, we are leaving.\" And I thought to myself, are they loosing, have they\nlost their minds? Where are we leaving? It's a ghetto. We cannot go out. But we were, knew to\nrespect our parents so we obeyed. And we went to a place where was before a storage for grains.\nAnd it was empty, it was a dirt floor and nothing there, just a small window and a door. And my\nparents went, there were many ruins and they got together some bricks and by themselves they built\na little stove. But what they said is still clear and vivid in my mind. They said, \"At least here we'll\nhave, it's enough that the Nazis destroy us from the outside. Here at least we'll have a little bit more\npeace and we'll be together. But 1t won't be because the fighting, the screaming, the children crying.\nSo we'll live there, right here, in this storage room.\" Exactly, and the conditions of the ghetto, I\ndon't think I need to go 1n because its very clear at this point.",
        "A: Okay. This ghetto, to my knowledge, was not like the Warsaw ghetto where there was physical\nresistance, of fighting. In fact, there was some ghetto, it was not as large a ghetto. What I\nremember is that we were constantly hungry. And my mother tried from the little meal that we had,\nshe tried to make meals and many times what she did, she would take a little of hers, she would give\nto the smaller children because they couldn't endure so much. We wanted the parents, if the parents\nwanted to protect the children, she still was trying to read poetry and to sing songs, she still had the\nbooks, and she says, \"We must, as long as we live, we must go on like a clock. We cannot stop.\nWe have to go on.\" And she tried to teach my little sister who didn't have a chance to go to school,\nso she tries to teach her at home, and to write a little bit. And my brother never had a\nchance to become barmitzvah. I don't know the exact age of them but I know that before, that he\nwas not yet barmitzvah. And barmitzvah was always a very, very important thing for a Jewish\nchild. So we lived in constant, and there was a lot of sicknesses. Because the sanitary, there was no\nmedication, there wasn't a sanitary. A lot of parents died. You saw little orphaned children in the\nstreet begging for food. It was just horrible. Why I don't go in so much detail from the ghetto,\nbecause remember like I said before, that each time we thought it's the worst, something worse\ncame. So after Auschwitz, this was like paradise. And for the main reason, because I still had my\nfamily.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: The Germans patrolled, I don't know why I don't have so much knowledge of how it was in the\nghetto. Because I know one thing, that most of the time we stayed inside so much. I know there\nwas a lot of sickness. I know that they tried to help, there were people who tried to help each other.\nBut the problem is that everybody was starved. Everybody was hungry. You couldn't go, it's just\nthat sometimes the parents like made sacrifices. They would give a little of their ration to a younger\nchild and the starvation. The kids couldn't anymore go to school. But if they would discover that\nwe teach the children, we could be shot. They didn't want us to be educated. They wanted to\ndestroy everything else. So still, the parents tried to teach and there were groups and we tried, like\nthere was a group and if somebody got sick they tried to help. But the exact conditions that I should\nremember so clearly, I don't remember. I didn't know, I was too young still to know everything.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I don't. No, I don't.",
        "A: No, no, you can ask me. But I don't know. I know that, yeah, there must have been a soup\nkitchen because I remember that we used to go to get some food, because we didn't have the food at\nhome. We got rations. But I don't remember exactly how it was organized.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think too much, no.",
        "A: Yes. In fact, there was one girl that I got to know in the ghetto. We stayed friends. So yes, I did\nhave friends, tried to as much as we could to go on and to talk, but the conditions were so horrible.\nBecause hunger and no place to wash, no place to, if somebody got sick there was no medication.\nSo there was a lot of illnesses, like typhus was a lot, also, going in. Some people died of starvation.\nSome people died, that's what I remember most, is little kids crying a lot and begging. And older\npeople sitting outside because there 1s already a lot of orphans.",
        "A: This I don't know.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, it was fenced in.",
        "A: In the ghetto, people tried not to wander around too much because they didn't want to, they\nwanted to avoid to be visible. Not to get hit because the Nazis had a tendency to torture, to mock\nus. In fact, for that reason, we tried as much to stay out of sight. I remember that I was mostly\ntrying to be inside, like I felt safer to be inside.",
        "A: Yes. But not constantly. I don't know why I have so little recollection of the ghetto. That is not\ntoo much, I was a whole year in the ghetto. It was exactly October 15, 1941. They chased us from\nhome. And the ghetto, the entire ghetto was liquidated on November 17, 1942. About a year later.\nWhat I remember is that when, again in the middle of the night, I don't know why, but when we\nwere chased off it was in the middle of the night. But this time we were told, they got us all\ntogether, and we were told that we're going to be resettled to a family camp where we are going to\nhave better conditions. Where we are going to have food and medications and where the families\nare going to be together and work. And people were happy that we're going to have better medical\nconditions and better food. And then they took us all and they put us in the cattle cars. I still had. .",
        "A: From the because I went there too.",
        "A: Because a Nazi say this.",
        "A: They told us that we are going to be resettled to a family camp and we are going to have better\nconditions. We're going to have medicine, because a lot of people died because they got sick, they\ndidn't have any medication. And that we're going to have more food, that we're going to have good\nconditions. We're going to work but we're going to have good conditions. And it made sense\nbecause they want us well, that's what we thought. So they are going to feed us better, they are\ngoing to give us medication, and we didn't put any resistance because we didn't know. We believed\nit. I was brought up to trust people, to believe. You know, in my life, my family didn't ever betray\nme. Like I said, the only time I heard my mother lying is this, so I had no reason why not to\nbelieve.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t hear much discussion, I don't know whether my parents wanted to shield us. Believe it\nor not, in the worst conditions, they were telling us stories, they were teaching us...\n[end of side | of tape 2]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh that was a time I will never forget. They closed, they closed, we were put in the cattle cars,\nthey pushed in, it was so tight that you hardly had place to sit down. There was nothing to sit on.\nAnd there was no place to relieve yourself. They locked us in with just a small window that you\nlooked out, and they locked us, you know, hermetically sealed cattle trains. And when the journey\nbegun, there was so many people packed in this here, and we traveled with this here, the train, from\nNovember 17, 1942, when we arrived in Auschwitz was November 22, 1942. So five days, right?",
        "A: What was happening in the cars? It was hot. We were hungry. We were thirsty. People were\ncrying. People were praying. People were screaming, going crazy. We had no choice, we had to\nrelieve ourselves in front of other people. Starvation. Fear. Where are we going? How long are\nwe going to go? Where they are taking us? They promised better conditions, when is it going to\nbe? And I remember parents tried to comfort, when we arrive there things are going to get better.\nAnd in the meantime, people were fainting. People got sick. It was just a living Hell.",
        "A: What was going on, I was clinging to my parents. And I was wondering, what's going to\nhappen? And I was crying because I saw my little brother and sister so hungry and I had nothing to\ngive them. The parents wanted to protect us, we want to protect the parents. And we saw older\npeople, we were always told by my parents and my grandmother, may she rest in peace, that we\nalways help those who are less fortunate but here we were all less fortunate. And the worst thing\nwas that we couldn't help each other too much. We were all in the same condition. There was no\nrelief, no relief. And just, I kept on thinking about, I wanted to turn my mind off so I was trying to\nthink of stories but the hunger took over. We were sleepy, there was no place to lay down. It was\nthe most horrible journey. It was a horrible journey. And then, after five days like this, the stench,\nthe tiredness, you know? The Holocaust for me, it was not,\nwas nothing to compare to what we suffered. But the worst suffering was that we, I\nsaw the people I loved and I couldn't help them, and they couldn't help us. We lost control of our\nlives. And that was even before we came to Auschwitz. And when we arrived, this train stopped all\nof a sudden, the door flung open, people who looked very strange to us in striped gray and blue\nstripes, wearing, with hats, . And then the Gestapo came and said, \"All rouse, schnell,\nschnell, schnell.\" Always schnell, always rouse. And they told us to leave everything, to leave our\nbundles there. We didn't have too much to begin with. And everything went so fast. And then the\nGestapo were chasing us and I remember I saw a gate. It said All-might-muck-fry (ph). All-might-\nmuck-fry (ph) means work makes you free. But as I found out later, the only dead was only when\nthey liberate us. Only a few survived. When we came they started to make selections. And\nMengelia, at that time I didn't know that this is Mengelia, some very well fed, good looking Nazis,\nwith the Nazis uniforms, with the swastika, stood so, they were, you couldn't tell from their faces\nanything. Expression was like mocking and everything. And later I found out that the one who\nmade the selection when we were there was Mengelia. And they started to separate male from\nfemales and make selection. To the right and to the left. I had no idea. And all of a sudden, when\nwe came there facing the gate where it said All-might-muck-fry (ph), this is the gate. On the right-\nhand side, which would be the left, but on my side facing, was a Red Cross truck with a sign, Red\nCross. And I remember I pointed it out to my parents. I said, \"See, they kept their promise. The\nRed Cross stands for help.\" And then they said, they started to tear apart the families. Separate the\nfamilies. Pulled out children from the hands of their parents. Little infants away from the mother.\nAnd they started to make the selection. To the left and to the right. Immediately they took away\nmy father. My father was a young man, maybe early 40's or 40 or so. And they took away my little\nbrother and sister. My mother and I they put together in the line, we were selected to go each. And\nat that point...",
        "A: I don't know their exact age, they were younger than I but I just go by because I know that my\nlittle sister, when the Nazis came in she hadn't start yet school. And my brother wasn't yet\nbarmitzvah, so I don't know their exact age. It was, at home we didn't celebrate birthdays like here\nbecause for the Jewish people didn't, some people didn't want to say their age because they believe\nin the evil eye and things like this. I don't know, superstitious. But anyhow, they were still young.\nSo when they took them away, my mother was with me, and everything went so fast that I didn't\neven have time to think. And then my mother turned to me and she said, \"Yit-cola (ph), you\u2019re a\nbig girl. I have to go with the little children. But remember my child, no matter what's going to\nhappen to you, don't become hateful and bitter. Don't let them destroy you.\" That was her last\nwords. And all of a sudden I was all alone. And that's it, everything that I had, everything, because\nI was became dead. And I didn't even have a chance to say good-bye because I didn't know that we\nare parting forever. I didn't know about gas chambers, nothing. My personal experience, nothing\ncan historically, I never knew about gas chambers. When you saw that we were deceived.\nDeceived, we didn't know. So then they lined us up and we were taken into the, a different way.\nAnd they left for the barracks. And they took them away. I didn't know at that time where, I had no\nidea. Now when I know what's happened, but I mean, at the time when they took us away we didn't\nknow. And they took away all older people, young children, pregnant woman. So I talk to myself, I\nremember it today, look how kind they are because we were told that we were all going to be\ntogether. So we thought that they give them a ride, which I appreciated very much. I figured the\nlittle children, but I had no idea that we are parted forever. Who could know that doctors who were\ntrained to say the Hippocratic oath, that are trained to heal the sick are going to kill their health. In\nfact, I wrote a poem about Mengelia. Would you like me to say it?",
        "A: Yes. Anyhow, when they took us away all of a sudden they brought us into a place and we were,\nthey shaved, first of all they made their number. We had to give up everything. I remember I was\nclutching a little picture, a photograph of my family, and I had to give it up. At first I didn't want to\nso they started to beat me so I figured its not worth it to, you know? I knew that I'm not going to be\nable to keep it so I gave it up. And we had to...",
        "A: My number?",
        "A: Yes. 2-5-6-7-3. Not everyone got numbers. The ones who they took away to the gas chambers,\nthey didn't get numbers. And also, I don't know whether you are aware, Auschwitz was Auschwitz\nI, II. I was taken to Birkenau and Birkenau was where the gas chambers were, all the gas chambers.",
        "A: When they took away...",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no. They immediately had the selections. Mangelia sent them to the trucks. And I\nremember they were holding hands, you know, my little brother and sister. My brother was\nprotecting my little sister, they took them away. And then my mother saw them going away. I don't\nknow how much she know, what she knew, but again her , she made a fatal choice and\nshe went with the children. She said she cannot leave them alone, you are a big girl. So that was\nthe last time I ever saw them. The whole family for four generations. And I had no idea where my\nAunt, who lived in Warsaw, she was married with children, my Aunt in the . Another\n, all the relatives. I never said good-bye, I don't know what's happened to them.\nWhether my Aunt in Warsaw died in the Warsaw ghetto, whether she was, this we will never know.\nWe don't even have, you understand why this story of Buncho (ph) the Silent, I was thinking.\nBecause, I don't know whether it was just coincidental that this story had such an effect on me and\nwhy I remembered because Buncho (ph) the Silent in the story was 13 years old, when the step-\nmother came. And also I was many times thinking that we live for so long, since about the 1600\ncentury my ancestors came to Poland. And yet, we had to leave everything. Everything that was\nours they inherited, they took away everything. Nothing was ours. And, you know? And then\nwhen we came there, they shaved our heads, everybody had shaved heads. The guys, it was done\ntoo. And then we were the fortunate ones, at that time we didn't know because good and bad\nfortune can only be understood in retrospect. So I didn't realize that I was still lucky, that I got the\nnumber. At least I'm alive with the number. And then we really got a bath, we didn't get gassed,\nbut obviously, or I wouldn't be here to tell you this. But we got a bath, which we welcomed because\na shower was, you know? And then we went out for, a whole full of the floor was laying uniforms.\nAnd they were striped, the same thing as we saw with the ones who came to the train. And, not\nfrom the Nazis, this was also hefflinger (ph), which means Jewish people who were interred there.\nAnd then they gave us those uniforms and they took away our shoes. Everything was taken. Our\nclothes, our shoes, our hair, our name. Everything. And all of a sudden, I realized that to them I\nwas just a number. And I remember that at the time, when they called, you know they never called\nus by name but number, in order to dehumanize us, that we should give in and give up. They\nalways would call my number, which was 2-5-6-7-3 [in German], and whenever they say that I\nalways would say under my breath, \"Yit-cola (ph)\". Because I thought to myself, how can I be a\nnumber? I can feel, I can think, I can laugh. Of course I didn't have freedom but I had freedom of\nmind, freedom of thoughts. And so I, this was my spiritual form of resistance. That I refused to see\nmyself through their minds. And after they gave us the, instead of my shoes, which was a nice pair\nof shoes too, they gave us wooden clogs. And mine, unfortunately, were not matching. And we got\nan enamel bowl. And this was all our worldly possessions. In one day our entire past was wiped\nout. And we had no future. We didn't know it then yet. I didn't know about gas chambers yet. And\nthey marched us into a barrack.",
        "A: Sure. We came with people from our town who were in the ghetto.",
        "A: The older people didn't come in with me.",
        "A: In the ghetto, I mean, in the concentration camp there was pretty much solidarity. However, I\nhad one bad experience. And I'll come to it. So when they gave us, and we always had to march to\nline up, never, since I came in on November 22, 1942, until Auschwitz was resolved, until January\n18, 1945, I had no longer freedom. No freedom. We were, everything, because from the morning\nwe woke up, we came in the barrack, it was a real big, long barracks. And was three\nlayer bunk beds. And crowded on the bunk beds with one blanket. And they were so low that you\ncouldn't sit up. We couldn't sit up. The same clothes, the shift that we got, with this I slept. There\nwas no night clothes. From 1942 to 1945 I never brushed my teeth. I never saw myself in a mirror.\nNobody ever embraced me. Nobody ever said, after having so much love. So when I'm looking\nback from an environment where I was free like a bird, to come to a place where I felt like in a cage.\nAnd you know, you can put a bird in a cage but you cannot deprive them of their desire to fly. They\ntook away my freedom but they couldn't take away my desire to be free. They took away my loved\nones but they could not take away my desire to live. And I guess there were many horrible things\nbut probably the most horrible was losing everyone I loved. And not only experiencing my own\nsuffering, but witnessing the suffering of others and have to be silent like Buncho (ph) the Silent.\nAnd I couldn't say anything. And in the barracks, where I could say something when the Nazis\nwere not there at night, it was like the Tower of Babel. Because everyone spoke a different\nlanguage. And we were too tired, too grieved in the beginning. So when we came in, so many\npeople were crowded in this barrack. And all of a sudden, from a happy sheltered loving home to\nbe thrown into an environment like this. And everybody was suffering. My first concern was,\nwhen is our family going to come? But I still was natve enough to believe what the Nazis told us,\nthat we are going to get united. So I'm waiting. And I don't see them. So I start asking questions.\nAnd there is a conspiracy almost like, so silent. Whether they didn't want to tell us because they\ndidn't want to break my heart, or whether they were not allowed to? This I don't know, but whoever\nI asked nobody answered anything. They didn't say yes or no, nothing. Finally, after constantly\nbadgering and repeating, one of the girls said, \"You might as well tell her. We are all here\ncondemned to die.\" And she points at the smoke and she said, \"You see that chimney? This is\nwhere your parents are.\" And tells me the story about the gas chambers. She said, \"This is where\nwe're all going to be.\" Remember I related a story, it was when I was a child, I went to the funeral,\nmy parents took me to the funeral and they told me that, to take your own life is a sin. It's like\nspitting God and your parents in their face because they gave you a gift and its against the Jewish\nlaw. So I did not for once think about committing suicide. But at that moment, if I would have\nbeen able to die when I found this out, that's how horrible my grief was. And I just was ready to\ngive up. I was not trying to think about committing suicide, but I became oblivious. I didn't care\nwhat's happening. And anyhow...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I didn't know the first day.",
        "A: No, no, not months. It was in a few days. The exact day I don't know. Not very long, not very\nlong. Because I was constantly asking and badgering the girls. And I'm going to go in later to\ndescribe what a day in Auschwitz was, but for now, they gave us the ration bread and I felt like, its\nlike a funeral for me. I lost everybody. So I didn't, couldn't, I was starved but I couldn't eat. So I\ntook the bread and left it. In the morning my bread was gone. And one of the girls there, I don't\nremember her last name any longer, Esther I know was her first name, she was from Chair-ta-hoff\n(ph) and she actually came from a prison. I don't know whether the prison was during the war\nbecause from what I know she was not a criminal, so maybe she, the Nazi laws were different than\nour laws. For keeping on, for wanting to practice our religion, for wanting to live. To\nkill you was legal. But to save a Jewish child or a Jewish adult was illegal and punishable by death.\nTo survive was to them, everything that was our they have taken away, if we would try to keep\nsomething, we were treated like criminals. So anyhow, in the morning Esther says to me, \"Oh poo\nYit-ka (ph), somebody stole your bread.\" And I said, \"My gosh, what place is this? Stealing\nsomebody's piece of bread.\" And when I got the next day my bread, I couldn't eat again. Even\nthough I was, like my throat was locked. And I left the bread. In the night for some reason we slept\nso many people on one bunk, so if one had to turn, so we slept on our sides like sardines, the other,\nwe had to wake the others, so somebody woke up. And as I wake up, the girl, Esther, who pitied me\nwas eating my bread. And that was almost like the last straw for me. And at that point I just didn't\ncare what's happening. And I was sitting and crying. And I didn't know it at the time, in Auschwitz\nif you didn't get up for the or the counting, if you didn't obey the law for anything, you\nwould right away be killed, taken to the gas chambers. So a girl walks over and she ask me, \"Why\nare you crying?\" And I didn't care at all, I was so, so heartbroken, that I just started crying. I just\ndidn't even want to answer. Finally she, it was something in her voice, that I felt that like she's\ncaring, which I started to understand and I remembered what my grandmother use to say, \"Yes my\nchild, but kindness and caring cannot be little things.\" Like when I did the . And\nwhat's happened\u2019? And finally I tell her. And she said, she thought that I cried because of the bread,\nI cried of the whole situation, of losing the family and everything. So she took a piece of her bread\nand she broke it off and she said, \"Take it.\" And I didn't want to take it. Because I already knew\nthat we are all there to be killed, that it's just a matter of trme. So I figured I cannot afford to get\ninvolved with anybody, to care for someone, to have a relationship, because in case one of us goes,\nthere's going to be additional pain, to protect myself from the pain. But there was something in her\nvoice and her face and everything. Her name is Benack (ph), at the time, was Binna Gold-cut (ph),\nYanka Gold-cut (ph), because she use to call herself Yanka. And finally I took the bread and I said,\n\"No, I cannot alone, no matter how long I'm going to live, alone. It's not even worth living. I'm all\nalone.\" I took the bread and Binna became my dearest friend. And from that day on, she became\nlike my sister. We cared for each other. We cared deeply for each other and we helped each other.\nIn Auschwitz, a piece of bread meant life. Meant winning in the game of survival. So I just felt that\nshe was so kind, that she was able to break up, and the contrast. Here, Esther stole my piece of\nbread. And this girl gave away a piece of bread. I didn't even know until this day, I don't know\nwhen she came, I didn't know at that time anything. Now I know that she was born in Warsaw, but\nI didn't know. At that time we didn't think of it. And I took the bread and with it something in my\nspirit started to soar again and we made a commitment, Binna and I. We didn't know if we were\ngoing to get out of there, but to live or to die with , with humanness. Not to lose\nour dignity. And this is important to know, that in Auschwitz there were two kinds of laws. If\nsomebody was hungry and while they were carrying the cauldron with soup, people would lift up\nthe lid and put in their bowl and grab and run. If they were lucky they could run away. If they\ncaught them, they would get 25 on their bare behind. And sometimes even worse. But one inmate\nfrom the other, that was a no law. Would not take, because we know this meant survival. And from\n1942 to 1945 I was in Auschwitz, nobody ever stole from me anything. You know? And we felt\nlike we had no freedom at all. No freedom of movement, only in our soul and our mind could we\nbe free. And just to feel that I had some kind of choices yet to make. We use to switch, you know,\nlike to share. I would give Binna a little bit of my soup and she would give me a piece of bread, or\nvis-a-versa. One day when she had the . And even sisters and mothers, sometimes, if\nthey were lucky to be together, they kept separate the plate, everybody would, they would measure\nwhen they divided. You shouldn't be a hair bigger than the other because the starvation was so\ngreat. Binna and I trusted each other and we kept together our bread. We didn't keep it separate and\nshe never betrayed me, or vice-a-versa. And somehow knowing, she became the, next to my\nfamily, she became the friend that I kept with. When other friends in concentration, but Binna and I\nwere more like friends, under such circumstances. And when the day that they usually begun, when\nthe whistle would blow, get up. And we would always, it was still dark. I didn't have a clock\nbecause as I said, my only worldly possession was the shift, the wooden clog and the bowl.\nNothing else. So I didn't have a watch, I didn\u2019t know what day it is, I didn't have a calendar. We\ndidn't have anything. People say, did you have this? So that's why I'm pointing out, I didn\u2019t have\nmore than this...\nEnd of Tape 2.\nTape 3",
        "A: We didn't wake up by the clock. We woke up, until this day I don't know what time, I know it\nwas still dark. We would wake up and didn't have to dress because I slept in the shift, the same shift\nthat we wore during the day. We didn't have any extra clothes. This was all that we had. And there\nwas water but we were told that this is not good drinking water. So water was very scarce. We\ndidn't have, we couldn't go to the bathroom when we wanted. It was like a collective bathroom, like\nthe latrines you know? And it was just a wooden board and in it like cut out a piece. So we couldn't\ngo where we wanted and this was a terrible thing because certain people, sometimes out of, there\nwas such a terrible thirst or a hunger, that sometimes they would eat things that they shouldn't eat, or\ndrink. And therefore they got diarrhea. And because the conditions, we couldn't wash up. We\ndidn't have anywhere to wash. So it wasn't clean. And once you got the diarrhea, that was the end\nof you, because when you have diarrhea you have to run a lot and they wouldn't let you go and\nwork. And if you soiled yourself, then when they made the selections, then you would go now. So\nit was important. And in order to feel a sense of freedom, since we couldn't wash, I could go\nthrough the movements of pretending that I'm washing myself, just to have some, to feel some\nfreedom. So when I got up in the morning, it was dark and in the summer it was hot, winter was\ncold, and out of habit I was still saying the , | would still say the prayers, even in\nAuschwitz. And we would start, go to the where we are counted. Alive or dead, we had\nto be . And they used the matter that one was responsible for all. So if one person\nwould not be found because he's sick or wouldn't come out, or whatever, we all had to stand no\nmatter how long. Rain, in the biggest rain and the frost without a coat, without anything. If we\ndidn't have, and we would stay, freeze. So we used to try to warm each other, one in the back, you\nknow somebody would stand, you stay in the front and somebody in the back and embrace each\nother. And one day we couldn't do it ultimately because the Nazis, they counted. And sometimes\nwe would be lucky, that everybody was accounted for. Other times we would stay for hours. And\nthen they would give us something, even though we didn't have enough of it and we wish we would\nhave had more, but its suppose to be coffee, it resembled muddy water. A little beet. A piece of\nbread. Some kind of smelly cheese, its like Limburger cheese, it was smelly. But we didn't get\nenough of it. We were grateful that we had this here because we were so hungry that we would eat\nanything almost. In fact we had to restrain ourselves, sometimes not to eat things which could harm\nus. And in the winter, because there was lack of water and no place to wash, we would pick up the\nsnow. And if a Nazi would see us or the one who was watching us, we would get beaten for that.\nThey tried to torture us. And then after we got our ration, we had to line up, and I can still hear,\n\"Links.\" Line up and go march. And on both sides big, long lines with the prisoners marching,\nwith the inmates marching. And I don't know how to call ourselves because when they talk about\nslavery in Egypt or was not as bad as what we had, yet they don't call them slaves. So\nprisoners, I don't know what, but I feel we were worse than slaves because slaves are not\ncondemned to die, you know? Not that way, they used them for something. And we started to walk\nand on both sides were guards and the Nazis with the dogs, that went with us to work. And then we\nhad to go through the gates, and at the gates many times was a dren-dall (ph), they would take out\nsomebody who didn't walk too good or didn't look to good. Other times we were just called, 1-2-3,\n5-6-7, the 8\" out, sometimes the 10\" out, we never know. So you could not plan from one second\nto the other because you don\u2019t know whether you come back, would you be alive the next day.\nThat's when I realized how a person was condemned to death, you know, who has a family illness\nmust feel. And I found out pretty soon that it was more dangerous to walk on the outside line so we\ntried to be in the inside line and not to be the very first or the very last. The less visible you could\nmake yourself. And we marched. When I came I was assigned to Block 8 and a Turkish woman\nwas our Block Elster (ph). A Block Elster (ph) had a little more privileges than the others, she\ndidn't have to go out to work but she was responsible. And then we went out to work and I cannot\nestimate how long of time or how many miles because I had no way of measuring, but I know we\nworked snow, winter, sunshine, it didn't matter. And then we came to work. And we always\nworked outside the camp. And, outer-commando (ph) it was called, when you worked outside,\nouter-commando (ph). And what I started to realize is that the work we were doing at that time was\nnot usual work. We would take stones or gravel and carry it from place to place and the Nazis used\nto mock us. And point to the gas chambers and they said, \"See? That's where\nyou're all going to come out.\" And then he said, \"Where is your God now?\" And that's when I\nremembered what my mother told me, when I had to go to the root cellar. \"Go, Yit-cola (ph), go.\nGod 1s in the root cellar too.\" And I said to myself, \"Go, Yit-cola (ph), go. You\u2019re the last one of\nyour family. If you don\u2019t survive, the world will not know and it will be the last. It's like your\nfamily will not have existed. Go. God is here too. But man is not here.\n[humanness] is not here.\" And I started to understand what means, why my\nparents stressed it so much. And I never for once felt like God has failed me. I felt the people failed\nme. Because God gives men choices to do good or evil. But they have chosen and they were the\neducated people. My family always stressed education. . In fact, my family used to\nsay that is the highest form of religion, science and achievement. And in\nAuschwitz, I had a chance to find out that this was true. Because Mengelia has doctoral degrees.\nAnd he's responsible for the death of 400,000 people including my own family. So I did not doubt\nGod. In spite of what was happening, that I still pray to God and I still believed in God and I\nremembered other things, which I didn\u2019t mentioned this story and I think I will now because I\nthought of that story often. You know, for Passover and Rash-sha-shona (ph) every year, regardless\nof how poor you were, or rich, people would get new clothes. It didn't matter whether you had a lot.\nAnd most, and there was not big department stores like this here, so mostly we would go to the\ndressmaker to make a dress. That particular summer, I was like in my pre-teens, and I remember\nmy mother ordered for me navy blue . And the dressmaker made me a dress, a two-\npiece dress, a sailor dress, a pleated skirt with the collar like this. And when we went to try on first\nthe measurements and everything. And then when the dress was ready I would try it on again and\nlook in the mirror and it fit well. And I felt so proud, so happy with this dress. The sailor dress.\nAnd I came home and it was early Passover, before Passover. So, like a child, I wanted to put on\nthe dress and to show my girlfriends what a pretty dress, I was so proud of it. And when I was\ngoing to put on the dress, my mother said to me, \"Yit-cola (ph), please don't put on the dress now.\"\nI said, \"Oh Mom, it's gonna...\" She said, \"It might get tore and it might get stains and then you\nwon't have it for Passover.\" And I said, \"Oh Mom, its going to be okay.\" So I remember my\nmother said to me, \"Yit-cola (ph), please. Don't take chances on something you can't afford to\nlose.\" But as a child I started to nudge, oh please and please and please. So finally my mother said,\nshe says, \"Well, you learn about responsibility. That's the only way you\u2019re going to learn.\" And I\npromised I won't, I'll be careful. And I had every intentions of doing it, 1t was not out of mischief or\nnot caring. And I put on the dress and I came out. And I was very, a combination. In one way I\ncould be very serious and I was very playful and a little tomboy and I remember I mentioned to you\nthat we had the , the river. And we use to go there, it had beautiful trees. And the kids\ncame and somebody challenged, they said, \"Who can climb up highest on the tree?\" And I was\npretty good at that, you know? I was never heavy, which actually in Poland that was not looked at\nfavorably. They use to say that she has consumption if you were thin. People were more, so\nanyhow, in no time I climbed up this tree, the tree, and I was, I dissed the person who was\nchallenging me. And all of a sudden I hear somebody say, \"Yit-cola (ph), Yit-cola (ph) your mother\nis coming.\" And I got scared and I remembered, my gosh, I'm wearing the good dress. And I went\nto get off the tree fast and the skirt, the pleated skirt got caught in a branch and I tore the skirt. I\ncame down. My mother wasn't even there, it was just a prank they played on me. And I was in\ntears. And I said, \"My God. My mother begged me not to take chances. Not to take a chance to\nlose something and now my dress is torn.\" And I remember like today, I took the pleats and I\nfolded it over so it wouldn't show my flesh, because it was a big tear. And when I came into the\nhouse with tears in my eyes, my mother looked at me, she didn't have to ask much. All she said,\n\"Take of the skirt.\" Because she saw the way I held it with tears in my eyes, so she put two and two\ntogether. \"And I'll fix it for you.\" But she said, \"Remember one thing. It's up to you. You can\nwear your old dress or the dress that I'll fix for you. But you\u2019re going to go to services.\" I was\ncrying my eyes out because I didn't want to wear my old dress and I didn't want everybody to see\nthat, what I did with this dress. But I remembered the lesson. Because my father always pointed\nout, in everything there is a lesson. In every experience. And what I remembered from that lesson\nis not to take chances with something I cannot afford to lose. And this was for me a terrific lesson\nbecause I knew one thing I cannot afford in Auschwitz, is to lose my life. So what I tried to do,\nmany think rather than to take chances like grabbing a little soup, you know, although I was starved,\nI said no. I don't want to take chances because if they catch me they can kill me or beat me up so\nbadly and if I cannot work they'll take me away. And I started to realize there how important it is,\nthe upbringing, the influences that I had and the lessons I had. And mostly I saw, you see before the\nHolocaust I had no frame of reference with which to compare the things, the values, and the things\nor the blessings that I had. And then I had a chance to see what it is to be without a family, without\na Jewish community, without the , we were always Jewish there, but we were not,\nJewish people were not the only people who were in Auschwitz. There were Gypsies, there were\nJehovah Witness, there were the Polish people, they were from all countries. However, the Jewish,\nwe, the Jewish girls, we were not together with the men in the same camp. The Polish girls were\nnot together in the same barracks with us. We were separated. So in all the years that I was there, I\nnever had any contact with a man. I'm not talking in a sexual way, but I mean even to be friends or\nto be in the company of men. And here, this is my teen-age years. The price of going to ;\nthe price of higher education that I was dreaming, to get a good, formal education. The price of all\nthe things, of liberty, which I started to realize how important freedom is. Our liberty. And this is\nwhen, when I felt all this here, then I felt, oh I wish I had a pencil and paper so I could write down\nhow I feel. But I didn't have. And at that time, I wrote in my head to past time, to forget, to run\naway from the harsh reality. So I remembered that I wrote a poem in my mind and it was what I felt\nand it was, I feel like a bird with clipped wings, tied to this earth by invisible strings, chained to a\ndestiny I did not chose, I feel like a prisoner that cannot break loose, I look at the sky with a heavy\nsigh, but my wings have been clipped and I no longer can fly. And I was looking out and seeing the\nphysical surroundings. Around us was the barbed wires, the watch towers, the crematories. The\nsmoke constantly above our heads and beneath us was mud. There was so much mud there that\nwhen we wore those wooden clogs, sometimes they got stuck in the mud and the feet got wet and\non cold, winter days they, for a long time you couldn't even take them off, if the feet got frozen, the\nbite, frost bite, and then after a day like this of suffering and on the job they would mock\nus, they would beat us. We could not, we were not allowed to help each other. And the useless\nwords. And I was thinking to myself, my gosh, if this 1s, if this is our , | don\u2019t even have\nthe word to express it, its like a different planet. It's in the same world like a different planet, a\nplanet of destruction, of death. The dead were not buried and was mountains, everything was\nmountains. Mountains of dead bodies until they buried them. And constant living under the fear of\nmaybe today they are going to take you away, and if you got sick you had no luck, there was no\nmedication. Everything that they promised was not. And once I found out what they do with the\npeople who come, that they take away, and I heard music playing. And I asked somebody, \"Where\nis the music?\" And that's when I found out that they have a live orchestra playing. When the\ntransport was coming and they made selections, sending away people to the gas chamber, the music\nwas playing. Classical music. And later, when I heard the music, I always started to cry because I\nknew that my people are burning, the music is playing. And you know, even after the Holocaust I\nalways loved music and singing, but for a long time whenever I start to hear music, I started to cry\nbecause the visions of the little children, of everything separated and how they tore apart. And then,\nafter a long day, again, walking through the gate, the selections. Some people got beaten to death.\nOther people from working were injured, some people got sick. And every day there became lesser\nand lesser of us. And the bodies, more skeletal. And we didn't, couldn't take a shower or anything\nand we started to accumulate lice. So a big treat was when we could take off that dress and try to\nto expose of the lice. And people with diarrhea, and it was just Dante's Inferno is a\ncomedy comparing to what it was. That's what I say because you ask me, did I, it's impossible to\ndescribe everything. So we came back tired, frozen, cold, over heated from the heat in the whole\nday, we came back, again the appeal (ph), say appeal (ph) and check there, there to alive, we are\nthere. And then we had to wait, after they count again they give us a little soup, a little bread. It\nwasn't enough to live and not enough to die. And many people, many, constantly people died. And\nseeing, here you was with somebody, a few minutes later they were gone. And constantly new\ntransports, and you couldn't speak. So, and the filth, the starvation, the loneliness. Like I started\nbefore to tell you, 1s all this time not seeing yourself in a mirror, not having a toothbrush. They tried\nto dehumanize us to the point where we didn't even, I'm embarrassed to talk about it, but when I\nremember what my parents taught me, that my does not depend on how other treat\nme but how I treat others, than I'm not ashamed because I haven't done anything to deserve it. We\ndidn't even have a piece of toilet tissue. All the time I was in Auschwitz, I couldn't have a piece of\ntoilet tissue. This is how they deprived us. Not a spoon, not a fork, nothing. You know, they tried\nto reduce us to be like non-humans. And the mocking constantly and everything. So again, each\nday the same thing, over and over, starting the and just hanging on another day. Just if you\ncould get through the day, not get beaten, not go to the gas chamber, go through the day and come\nhome together with Binna, that's . And many times, people would go in the evening\nand somebody would say, \"Listen, I'm going to give you a little of my soup. You want to give me a\npiece of your bread?\" Some people preferred the, a little soup to the bread. And the starvation.\nAnd then the Nazis would come and they would say that they are going to give us extra bread, who\nwants to have extra bread? And I learned very quickly, whenever they called for volunteers for\nsomething, I never wanted to volunteer. I felt, others suffered but I don\u2019t want to get involved to do\nsomething which wouldn't be , you know? And what I found out one time, they took,\nthey made a selection. They gave, it was true, they did give this time a little more bread, but they\ntook away the girls and not until after the war, one who was taken away and survived, I found out\nthat they took them for experiments. And they, the doctors experimented without anesthesia. You\nknow, they castrated some men and some women, the operations, so they could never bear children\nanymore. And some people, one woman, she 1s already dead now, but a few years ago she was still\nalive, I don't know what they did to her but hair was growing on her face so she had to go Electro-\nsomething, I forget how this is called, they had to take it off from her face. Hair grew like a man,\nyou know? And different things. There were plenty, I know certain people who I personally know\nwho got married but never could have children because of those experiments. And some got sick.\nBut the majority died, they didn't survive this here. Yes, and another thing. There was a\n, you know? So, and they sometimes Mengelia or other doctors would come and\nwe had to strip and, which is . He would look us over and those who looked already\nskinny or they are too sick or, away to, but at that point, away to the gas chambers. There was a\nblock where they would send away, and sometimes they didn't have enough time to get them out, so\nthey would put them, put them in this block and they no longer gave them food or anything. And\nthen they take them away. If you got sick, it was tough luck. Then you were a goner. Until this\nday, I cannot, I'm thinking and I'm amazed myself that I didn't, wasn't able to be clean there. I didn't\nhave medications, a few times I got sick. Not like real serious. Without an aspirin, without\nmedication, everything else. And yet to survive. And then constantly transports. And then was one\nday, we were called , they asked us to stay longer and there was a girl and her name was\n, something with a \"Z\" begins, I forget her last name, Zit-a-emir (ph), something\nlike this here. I didn't know her personally but I knew of her. She was a messenger, you know\u2019?\nAnd I don\u2019t know the exact story because I don't, I'm not, I was not a witness when she run away, I\ndidn't see her run away. But I know that one day we were all called together and we were, they\nprepared a gallow and they were going to hang her because she run away and they brought her back,\nthey found her. And she, when they found her, I don't know from where because in Auschwitz I\ncouldn't get anything more than what I got, the bowl and the clothes. She had a razor someplace\nhidden. And before they hang her, she cut her wrists in my prescence. Then there was another\nhanging. This hanging I did not witness because Rosa Loberta (ph), my , the beautiful\nRosa, this story I just know from my , the few to have survived. That she was also\nhanged in Auschwitz because she wasn't dead and they destroyed one of the crematortums. And\nwhen the Nazis started to lose the war, of course I didn't know about it because we had no outside\ncommunication. Completely cut off. That's why I say, its in this world but a planet like a different\nworld because we were isolated completely. They started to speed up the gassing and they wanted\nto destroy everybody because even though he 1s losing the war but he still was carrying on with the\nplan of destroying the Jewish people. So the girls made to destroy the gas chambers. And anyhow,\nthere is somebody who's name is Noy-ia Zub-o-dal-vich (ph), he lives in Israel. And he was able,\nbecause they kept him in solitary, and they tortured her. And from him I know this story. That they\nhang her. And before they hand her, she said, \"Ha-zak viv-lots (ph)\", the strong and brave. And\nwhat they wanted from her is that she should denounce, they interrogated her too and they wanted\nher that she should tell who the others were. The resistance, you know, she was involved with other\npeople. She, from the story that I've heard, that she was smuggling pieces of ammunition or\nsomething, but as I said, I'm not a witness to that but I heard. So there was resistance but very, not\nspeaking for the Warsaw ghetto we know that resistance, but this I'm not going to speak because I\nwasn't in those ghettos, I wasn't there. But the very fact, to want it to go on knowing that nobody is\nleft anymore. There is no place to go back or anything. So surviving, and we didn't know how\nothers, what's going on, what are they doing with the war or anything. But I kept constantly asking\nmyself, the German people at that time were the most educated people and yet they did the most\nhorrible things. A doctor who takes the Hippocratic oath to heal sick people is murdering healthy?\nAnd everything, it seemed to me like ironical. The youngster he considered too young to live and\nthe old were too old to live and the teen-agers, from teen-age years to older a little bit, they were just\nright to go to Hell and live and to suffer and to die there. So it was extremely, constantly living with\npain to see that everyday there is less and less. And there was the son-day-commander (ph). And\nthe son-day-commander (ph) was a group of Jewish prisoners in Auschwitz who were operating the\ninvolvement with gassing the people. And I didn\u2019t know it then but now, afterwards I found out,\nand almost I was in there. I returned to Poland and I went to the gas chambers now because I never\nsaw a gas chamber inside. And what I, so we saw, I have photographs and I saw it by myself. The\nprocess that they had, that to tell the people that they are going to take a bath but instead to put on\ngas, this was out completely of my experience both historically and privately. I never heard this.\nAnd not only that, everything that they took away that was ours became theirs . . .[end of side 1 of\ntape 3]... You know, all the values, all the many beliefs that I've been taught and many things, I had\nto tell them everything. It was not just the physically, but to tell them because I started to ask\nquestions of myself. I said, what is education for if it leads to Auschwitz, to gas chambers?\nImagine. Not only did they took away our possessions, our homes, our traditions and everything,\nbut a lot in Poland, gold teeth was our status symbol. Plus people did it to fix their teeth, but those\nwho were wealthier used to make the crowns for the teeth, they put in gold teeth. So when the\npeople were dead, before they went in they cut their hair and this was used for German economy, it\nwas for mattress stuffing and everything. And I was thinking, we had straw mattresses. My parents\ndidn't go to college, and my grandmother. But how did they live? I started to compare the values.\nAnd then, is another thing, from the teeth they took away everything and they selected, the glasses,\nand every single thing they took away from every part of the body. From the skin, lamp shades and\neverything. So everything was, again, what is technology for? And this is why, when I got out, I\ncould no longer have the same values. I had to tear down everything and to compare. What did my\nparents teach me? What did my grandmother teach me? What does my religion teach me? That\nthe most important thing was a human life, to save one life, the Talmud teaches us, is like to save\nthe whole world. And here was my mother who didn't have college degrees, was a extremely\nintelligent woman, well-red and intelligent and very artistic, but she didn't have college degree. And\nyet she resisted. She resisted both physically and spiritually. She did not give up Cal-fus (ph). And\nfrom one person that is now several generations of people. Can you imagine how many generations\nwould be if they wouldn't have killed the six million? How many people? And one Mengelia could\ndo so much damage. And that's when I started to realize, by going back. Not everything that I\nreflect while being there. Many things I reflected upon until this day. And I started to say, so I\nrealized something very important. That four groups of people actually influenced my destiny.\nBecause the Nazis, the only reason why the Nazis did this to us is because we were born Jewish. I\ndid not choose my parents and my parents didn't choose to die in the gas chambers, to be murdered.\nThey didn't die. They didn't die. They were murdered. Those who starved of starvation, those who\nwere killed or those from diseases, they were murdered because they put us in those conditions.\nAnd everything that was ours became their by brute force, by terror and by deception. And this is\nwhy I start about honesty. And then I started to realize, when I look back now, I realized also that\nthere are some things you cannot buy without money but there are also some things we cannot buy\nfor money. And those are the things that I miss the most. No money in the world can replace the\nsix million Jewish people and five million non-Jewish people who were murdered by the Nazis.",
        "A: Well in Auschwitz everything kept changing constantly. Because people were dying very fast,\nokay? And people were coming constantly. So the turnover was very quick. People came. The\npeople in Auschwitz, we were in the same barrack but as I told you, we could not speak each other's\nlanguage. Some could. The people who spoke Yiddish came very handy for me. Because in\nEurope not everybody, but those who came from religious homes, they could speak Yiddish. So it,\nas far as the guard, the people in the barracks I couldn't speak with everybody, nor did I have the\nenergy, nor was there enough time. We came home, we were dead tired. And once we gave us the\npiece of bread we were lucky that we could lay down our heads because before we knew it, it was\nmorning again.",
        "A: I think it was like about six people or something like this here.",
        "A: Yes. And the bunks were so low you couldn't sit up. You couldn't sit up. And sometimes it\nhappened that somebody died in the middle of the night. Couldn't do anything about it. The corpse.",
        "A: I was from 1942 to 1945.",
        "A: In November.",
        "A: Towards the end when they started to lose the war, there was more transport. They were\nbringing more people. It's like, 1t seemed to me from looking back now, that Hitler was determined\nto destroy everybody. He was also determined that there shouldn't be any traces. And another\nthing, which, see somebody would run away. Everything 1s relevant to conditions I've learned. For\ninstance, if one girl would run away, there were a lot of obstacles. The first obstacle was that if one\nwould run away the others would stay in until they found of that, we all would\nbe punished. So those who had a conscious and who cared said, how can I save my life at the\nexpense of others? Secondly, they evacuated, Auschwitz was called before Oswiecim, it was a\ntown. In fact there is a survivor who 1s from Oswiecim. That was her hometown. So it was a town\nlike any other towns in Poland. So they cleared, they evacuated all the people from there because\nthey didn't want to have witnesses. Plus for miles and miles away there were no people so you\ncouldn't hide. And Auschwitz, Birkenau was the only concentration camp to my knowledge, but I\ndon't know everything, so as far as I know until this day Birkenau was the only concentration camp\nwhere they made, they put on numbers. So you had the numbers. Your head was shaved. You had\nno, you were wearing the clothes. And the same number that you had on the arm was also put on\nthe dress, shift. Where could you go? And there was barbed wires, guards, watch towers. So it's\none of the two, she would want to go to the barbed wires because, so two things happened. Either\nyou get electrocuted or you get shot from the guards. So it was impossible almost to run away from\nAuschwitz.",
        "A: Not too many tried for the reason that I told you, because there was no place to go. Who would\ntake you in? Where would you go? So not too many people. Some people might have jumped the\ntrain, but I don't know of any.",
        "A: Relatively very few. That I am surprised. Very few. For me, its like, when I told you, at the\npoint when Binna and I decided to accept it, I accepted her piece of bread but I also accepted what\nshe offered more, her friendship. At that point, I made a decision. I will, first of all, of my\nupbringing, I told you what my, this here had a very great influence. Plus I said, I will not\ncollaborate in my own destruction. I did everything to try to keep myself clean, to keep myself,\nunder the conditions. I even went through like the motions of washing myself just to feel and try to\nthink, its ironic we were thinking, I remember that Binna and I was talking, said, if we're going to\ngo out from here, once in my lifetime I want to still have a whole loaf of bread. That was my\ndreams. Dreams change. It was one of my dreams. When I was, before the Holocaust, I was\ndreaming of getting a good formal education, become a writer. When I was in Auschwitz, I was\ndreaming about once in my life, before I die, once to have the feeling of not going, my stomach\nshould not turn from hunger, have cramps, hunger cramps. And the other dream was still to be free.\nTo be able to walk once in my lifetime still without the guards walking with me, with the guns and\nhaving to march. I-spy-dry-links (ph), I-spy-dry-links (ph), I still hear that in my head, the columns.\nAnd to see people dying and suffering in a world of destruction when I was brought up to respect\nlife. This was, and another thing that we were naive, and I see now that its not so, 1s that whoever\ngoes out, if I have one dress, just a clean dress and someplace to put my head I will not ask for\nanything more, but if I have a loaf of bread, a clean dress. We wanted so little. But we still have\nnot faced reality then because in concentration camp, in Auschwitz, I was with other people. And\nactually, even though the conditions were so horrible, somebody still took care, I still have\nsomeplace to, even that was the horrible conditions, but I had where to put my head down. And\neven though there was so little, hardly enough to get through the day, food, I still had somebody. So\nafter age 13 I was never on my own. I never, I was protective, loving environment. Here\ncompletely alone except for Binna, which became my friend from, in Auschwitz. I didn't know her\nfrom before. And then, to go out in the world, I didn't face it because at that time all we had, all we\nwere thinking about is of surviving. Of having the things, the things that I want. So at that time I\nwasn't thinking of other things. It's not until I came out that everything hit me. And so\nwe were in Auschwitz and with all this here, constantly dead around us. No separation between life\nand death. The dead people were not buried there. They put them, they took them in, they had like\na little wagon and they would pull them away. And if somebody died when we were at work or was\nkilled, we had to carry them back to the concentration camp to be counted, because we knew we are\naccountable. They made us responsible, one for the other. And this was going on for years. And\nnot having, loneliness, cold, starvation.",
        "A: I personally was fortunate that I didn't have to, but there were many times that our commanders,\nyou know, it was a commander, you were assigned to a specific group, we had to carry home,\nsomebody was killed or died on the way, we had to carry them home. Dead or alive they had to be\naccounted for.",
        "A: We was talking about how, that when we going to get out we are going to be grateful. And you\nknow, I'll tell you something. You know, intuition has nothing to do with logic, right? But you\nknow, I once read that the heart knows of the reason, that reason doesn't know heart. But actually,\none time, its like, I don't know, it was not at night, its not what I was dreaming. Its just like a, its\nlike a vision that I see that I am free and people are standing around me and asking me what the\nnumber is. I didn't know whether the outside world knows. I didn't know at all what it was. I was\nisolated. Imagine, in older years, not only did they take away everything from me but they stole\nthree, six years, nearly six years of my life. They stole the chance of education. They stole the\nchance, I never could go to proms, to dates. So from one thing to the other. And still they didn't\nfinish in Auschwitz. In 1945, it was January 8.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The condition got constantly worse for me because I became weaker. My body was almost like\na skeleton. And the longer you suffer the harder it gets. And to see the constant destruction.\nBecause I, I cannot praise myself and say, but I had, 1t was helping me to see the people suffer. It is\nhelping me when I see that, I wanted to help somebody. They didn't allow us to help each other.\nWe had to do it in hiding. Let's say if somebody fell and you were to lift up and to help you got\nbeaten. Sometimes you both could get killed.",
        "A: Well personally it didn't change that much, but the only thing is that there was more, the\ntransport was so constantly, the smoke coming and the music playing. And more people, we lost\nmore people. So that was the worst thing.",
        "A: Basically the music plays mostly when a new transport came.",
        "A: I have, I was never in the building where the crematorium because if I would be there I wouldn't\nbe here speaking to you.",
        "A: No, not so near.",
        "A: No. Even my own family. When they took away, I just saw them taking them on the trucks, but\nI didn't see them taking this here. But what they did with them and the conditions there, this I found\nout afterwards. I also found out that the people who worked in the crematorium, every three months\nthey would gas them too. Because they were most anxious that nobody should know. They wanted\nto wipe out every trace of the crime.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know them personally.",
        "A: No. No Jewish guards. Mostly I heard German. There was also like somebody who watched\nover us. We were watched constantly. Back breaking labor, which was not useful, starvation,\nisolation, all those things you know, any, this is why if there is a plague we experienced it. If there\nis a plague we experienced this.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The guards were terribly mean because if you for one second to stop to say something you got\nbeaten. If you wanted to help somebody you could get beaten or shot. They teased us, they mocked\nus deliberately. You know, and constantly lived under the fear that you can be taken away. The\nfear of getting sick. So constantly. And then after a while if you, like I made up my mind, live or\ndie. Because everybody has to die. But it was important to, I was grateful each day I\nthey did not assign me some kind of duties or things to do which would dehumanize me really.\nBecause what they said about the dead didn't dehumanize me. That dehumanized them.",
        "A: From whom to get stuff?\nW: From whom ever they could get, I don't know, guards or?",
        "A: The thing is, the guards, those who were there were already sadistic and cruel, otherwise they\nwouldn't be there. And with the guards we couldn't, I told you from the beginning, it was\n, they, we were, the dogs. A dog should also be treated with respect because\neverything that God created should, but the dogs had better than we had. They loved all their dogs.\nSometimes they would let their dogs bite some people. And a lot of mockery. That I felt, okay,\nthey say that they had to carry out their duty. But they really didn't. They could resist. They could\nsay no. They couldn't maybe, when Hitler became so powerful, but they could have done that in the\nbeginning. My mother risks my life and hers and she wouldn't do because she would rather have\ndied than to turn in another person and to survive on somebody else's expense.",
        "A: Yes. Only Jewish people. In our barracks were only Jewish. I didn't have contact with non-\nJewish people. I didn\u2019t have any contact, there was no men. The men were separated. In all those\nyears that I, in all the time I was there the only people that I saw is Jewish people.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. We were very, very nice to each other. We tried to help each other. Like I said, we would\nshare, when she had her worse day she would give me a little of her food and we always tried to\nencourage, not to give up. We used to say, and we spoke always Yiddish with each other, and I\nused to say to her, \"They want to kill us. We must not help them.\" We really make a conscious\neffort. Physically I had no choice because they could take us away anytime. They didn't need a\nreason. They had complete control of our lives. But at least we tried not to destroy, we tried to\nencourage each other. Maybe tomorrow something will happen. . And I didn't\nrealize it but I must have had always a very deep faith, very deep faith. I'll tell you something,\nwhich is not, it didn't happen then .. .",
        "A: There wasn't so many older...",
        "A: Yes, there were people older. No. People were helpful to each other because we knew that we\nare, we share the same circumstances, the same destiny. There were, I talk mostly about Binna\nbecause I was closest with her. With her I become, we shared such a traumatic, such an extreme\nexperience. And that's when you really get to know people. That's where the weaknesses, and\nwhen I saw the contrast of Esther to her. With Esther I never hounded, I never, I wish if she is alive\nuntil today, I don\u2019t even hold that against her because under those circumstances not everybody was\nstrong, to resist. But the point it, she didn't want to do me harm, she just couldn't resist the hunger\nso I, this was my only experience where somebody from the girls were mean to me. I never\nsuffered any cruelties from the Jewish girls there.",
        "A: There wasn't too much of this here. We were dirty, we were cold, we were tired constantly. On\nthe job you were this, but I could feel for instance that Binna cared for me. Because as I went to the\ngate, we were going to go through the gate, and when she knows that they always looked how you\nlook, not that they needed because they took away my family and they were Nazi, so\nshe would say, \"Yit-cola (ph), you are pale.\" She pinched my cheeks. I would do the same for her.\nIf we stood in the pen or where we stood, she said, \"Get into this light.\" She was three years older\nthan I, so it was like, in fact, after the liberation when we were together some people said, \"Well,\nshe's acting like she's your mother.\" She just felt about me like I'm her younger sister. But\naffection, hugging, kissing? There was not, no, there was not affection. You feel, you don\u2019t have\njust , okay, physical affection is very important because at home I could not walk by\nmy parents or my grandmother without a hug and a kiss. But this was not the place, 1t was not the\ntime. If you would see, we were so thin, so skeletal, so dirty, so lonely, so terrible, so full of pain,\nthat those things wasn't even on the mind. You know, the hug. It wasn't because we hug each other,\nthere was not, you came home from work. I don't remember it, special hugging each other. The\nonly time was like if one of us broke down, the other would embrace and say, try to comfort and\nsay, especially like this. No, I felt deprived and I missed this a lot because I was always an\naffectionate person.",
        "A: Yes, I missed it terribly.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Not at all. Very isolated, not knowing what, just this world. Getting cup, coming to the barrack,\nwaiting, and by the time you got your piece, little food, and everything and the finished,\nespecially in the cold, you were so glad, you were so tired that you laid down. Sometimes you were\ntoo tired to talk even.",
        "A: When I came in the beginning, I described to you the conditions. I was very, very down, very\nworried to what's happened to my family. But when I found out I was so, felt betrayed, I felt\nshocked, I felt grieved, I felt so many emotions. And I was just, I don't know if it wouldn't be for\nBinna, whether I would have even survived. Just knowing that we need each other for support, that\nshe is already an orphan and alone. And you can't imagine how many times I told her about the\nstory, Buncho (ph) the Silent. Because I remember that, when my mother finished reading this\nstory and I asked her, I'll never forget this, and I said, \"How could Buncho (ph) the Silent endure so\nmuch suffering and pain?\" And my mother answered me, \"My child, sometimes are many stronger\nthan iron and other times we can't enough lie, but no one knows their own strength until they are\never tested.\" And that's when I found out, if somebody would tell me, this I remember this thing.\nThat the very first time when I came and I saw the conditions, I saw everything. And for the first\ntime I was isolated from my family, I said to myself, at that time I was not in contact with anybody\nyet, I'm not going to survive here one day. And you know something? It was ironic. When I went\non the March of the Living, there was a girl and the first day she said to me, \"Yit-cola (ph), I'm not\ngoing to make it.\" And I said, \"Survivors don't give up, honey.\" And I told her, that when I was in\nconcentration camp, that I'm not going to make it, and I made it. You're going to make it, I'm going\nto help you. And she called me, you know, what kind of award I got. It was funny. At the end,\nwhen we were going already from the airport to Philadelphia, two kids who were very creative, they\nobserved everyone. So somebody, they took a napkin and they tore it in pieces and they wrote\ndown, one got the award for the best dancer, one for the best whatever, and I got the Bobbie (ph)\naward. I was to them the Bobbie (ph), the grandmother. And she even introduced me to her father\nby saying, \"Yit-cola's (ph) my adopted grandmother.\" And all the kids say, I'm like a Bobbie (ph) to\nher.",
        "A: No. Toward the end of it almost, toward the end of 1944 I got a lucky stroke. I was given a job\nto the , the they called it, the , they were\ncalled because we were wearing red kerchiefs.",
        "A: Just was lucky. Somebody must have died or something or maybe they needed more. I don't\nknow. But one day, instead of taking me out, they took me to the commander. And that was, I wish\nit would have happened earlier then I would not have lost so much weight and so much suffering.\nBecause this was better, for several reasons. First of all, you didn't have to work outside. The\noutside work was a killer. Many, many people died. I was young and maybe that helped me to\nsurvive, I don't know. But anyhow, in the we would go, we work inside. Our work\nconsisted of selecting, you know the people who arrived they took away everything from them. It\ncame from the, and all the bundles were brought to the , they called it. Why they\ncalled it Canada (ph) I cannot tell you, I don\u2019t know. But this is what it was called. And my job,\nand the jobs of those who were there, was to take apart the bundles and to select and to put in\nbundles the towels with towels, and all this went to Germans for their economy. Everything that\nwas ours became theirs.",
        "A: It was very strange. But we had no choice. We had to obey orders. At least, 1t was not hurting\npeople. Those were things.\nEnd of Tape 3.\nTape 4",
        "A: Yes. In Canada we had to work also every day. My work consisted, and everybody's work\nactually consisted, we took apart the bundles and we had to select them. Put each item of the same\nkind in bundles and in places. Now, let me start with the advantage for me. The advantage was that\nI didn't have to work outside. I was shielded a little from the cold and from the heat. The work was\neasier than it was to drag the stones and everything else. And also I couldn't take anything from\nthere but there were Nazis that were watching us too. But what I could do, occasionally but not\nalways, nobody could see. Let's say if I found a piece of bread, I couldn't take it out but I could take\na piece of it and eat it. So that provided a little extra food for me. Then there was something that\nthey did that if it wouldn't be for what my mother taught me, that my does not depend\non how others treat me but how I treat others, I would feel ashamed to tell this here. It's just like a\nwoman who is raped, and it doesn't have a good self and she doesn't understand that it\u2019s the\nvictimizer not the victim who is suppose to feel ashamed, then I would feel ashamed to tell you this\nhere. But I don't. I feel pained. When we were leaving, every single day, the most humiliating, the\nmost painful thing, they would search us internally so we wouldn't smuggle out any diamonds, any\ngold, because sometimes you did find those things there. So we couldn't take out anything. And\nthat was so humiliating for me. A girl who was modest, who wouldn't even undress in front of her\nparents. And you know I was like a budding teen-ager when the Holocaust begun. And here, to go\nthrough, that sometimes I wish I would have still walked in the outside commando because each\ntime they did this, I felt like I was dying by inches. It was so humiliating and so disgusting to have\nthese Nazis to search me. So as far as this, if you heard stories that somebody smuggled out, that's\nnot true. , maybe they didn't tell you, but they searched us. They searched us every inch,\nall over, even internally so what, how can you smuggle something out?",
        "A: Sometimes were men, sometimes women. It was not, and either way it was disgusting, 1t was\nhorrible. I feel, I cannot tell you how much, how I felt. Because I was never, until I came to\nI never had a internal examination. And this was my experience, it was horrible.\nAnd also the horrible thing was to see, to know that, seeing all the things from some families\nbrought beautiful things because they were not in ghetto, they came in and many people were rich.\nAnd knowing that the people are dead and that these clothes are going to go away for the German\neconomy, that for the Jewish children who were wearing the clothes, Jewish mothers and fathers\nand grandfathers. I shed plenty of tears. The only advantage was that I was warm and had a little\nbit of extra food. That was the only advantage of this job.",
        "A: That's all. It started physically and emotionally and spiritually in every single way. That's why I\nrelated to you the story about going to because I thought, how could a writer stand so\nmuch suffering and abuse, and I don't know because at that time, it was almost like it felt,\nwhy was Buncho (ph) the Silent silent, why didn't he say something? But I had to find out that I\nhad to be silent to survive because even when they called me number, tried to reduce me to a\nnumber, I couldn't say loudly or anything, but under my breath I said, Yit-cola (ph). You know\nwhat I called my number? My badge of honor. And somebody asked me once, a reporter, why do\nyou call it your badge of honor? And I told him. I got the number merely for being born Jewish.\nTo be born Jewish or Gentile 1s not a choice, but to murder people because they are different,\nbecause they are Jewish or Gentile and because somebody gets a crazy idea that somebody 1s\nsuperior to somebody else, which is a figment of Hitler's imagination, then this is something which\nmade me even more proud to be Jewish.",
        "A: I had no, I didn't have any knowledge what was going outside. There was no paper, no\nof communication, no meeting with anybody else. I didn't have any contact.",
        "A: No rumors. Nothing. I didn't hear anything. I don't know, it seemed to me like all I did was\nwork, come home, just waited. Couldn't wait to get, to lay down, to put down your head, it was so\nexhausted and cold. And sometimes, you know what was our, but that was not done deliberately,\nwe slept so many on one bunk bed. So out of necessity of the overcrowdedness we slept on the side\nlike I told you, close one another. So that was our, you know body gives out heat too. So we had\none blanket, everybody was pulling in different direction. So laying, whoever was lucky was laying\nin the middle, felt less cold. So it was not, its an existence, not knowing. Can you imagine? All\nthose years, not having the things which you take for granted. Like a piece of toilet tissue? How\ndegrading.",
        "A: I didn't know anything what was going on. I was living, each day was the same from day to day.\nJust knew inwardly, emotionally, spiritually that I need to hold on. But that's all.",
        "A: No, I don't. But you know what? I remembered the upbringing I had, that we never, we don't\ngive up hope. We don't give up hope. In fact, I remember saying, from my family,\n, which means as long as one vein is still moving there is hope. So we were\nhoping. I had even after the Holocaust situations where everybody gave up hope. I didn't. I'm not\nthis kind of a person.",
        "A: I didn't, again, I didn't make any choice. In Auschwitz, the only choice I made is, you cannot\nalways pick circumstances but you can pick responses. So the only choice I made, to live or to die,\nwith dignity, with Menschlichkeit, and to hold on as long as I can. So I didn't make any choice, but\none morning we woke up and I didn't even know what's happened. We didn't have the\n. They started to chase us out. And we started on the death march. And that was\nthe most horrible thing because you survive for so long and here we had to march because the Nazis\nwanted to make sure that we should not get into the hands of the Russians. They wanted, they blew\nup some, I didn't see them do that, but later I was, now I know how many things they blew up.\nThey tried to destroy all the evidence of the crimes that they committed. So we had to march.",
        "A: They didn't say anything. They said, \"Just go. Go.\" And what happened, and we even in\nconcentration camp we were not allowed ultimately to help each other, in their presence. But here\nwas even worse. Because if one, we had to walk. It was, imagine Poland is very, very cold. We\nwere now in April and it was still pretty cold.",
        "A: No, no. Iwas...",
        "A: No, the march of the living was in January but when I was now in Auschwitz, when I went to\nvisit now...",
        "A: Right. I'm just trying to tell you the truth, very cold.",
        "A: In January, January 18\" we were chased out. I didn't know at the time if everybody was left or\nnot because there was no time to find out. And what they did or didn't do, once I wasn't there I\ncouldn't see. But we had to march on foot. If you stopped, if you fell, they shot you. If somebody\nfell or couldn't go you were not allowed to help them. So many people, there were plenty people\nwho I saw on the way who was laying dead. And we could not do anything about it. This is the\nmost, this probably, besides my own experience from my own suffering, this was the most horrible\nthing for me. To be human and not to be able to help another human being, if somebody falls.\nLived for so many years and then in that way to die? A lot of people died on the way. A lot of\npeople died on the way. And we started to march on January 18, 1945 and we came to\nRavensbruck. I'm thinking , | wrote down the date someplace. It escapes me now\nbecause I'm so, I'm going to give you the dates I wrote 1t down but not right now.",
        "A: I think. Six day march, after six days, okay?",
        "A: There was lots of people. I don't know whether the whole camp or not because I don't know,\nwhat the case was. But there was, you could see like marching very, very long. And not until we\nwere almost German, and then they took us to this, to Revensbruck. We arrived to Ravensbruck.",
        "A: We had to walk. Walk and walk. Not until we were already on the German soil, and I don't\nknow exactly what spot it was, then there was like some trucks that picked us up. And on the truck\non the way we fell asleep, standing, sitting, in anyplace. But while you walked you had to stay alive\nand to be silent, to be Buncho (ph) the Silent.",
        "A: Not while we were walking. Some people had a little piece, people died of thirst, of cold. It was\nso cold and with the clogs, with the frozen feet. And by that time we were skeletons. Most of us\nwas more dead than alive. If it would take a little longer we probably would not have made it.",
        "A: I marched with all women. Maybe there were men too but when they chased us out of the camp\nfrom the rest it was, I mostly saw women. Maybe men came too but when they took us out we were\nall women.",
        "A: Yes. Fortunately she made the march. And then we came to Ravensbruck.",
        "A: I didn't notice anything. I was just having one thing in mind, the only thing I looked if Binna is\nstill walking with me. That was my concern and if they other girls, if nobody is, and I knew with\nthe last strength, I don't know with what strength I, I remembered my mother's words, \"Sometimes a\nman is stronger than I am.\"",
        "A: This I don't know. I was too involved, to make sure that I can make it, you know, when you\nwent so long.",
        "A: We arrived at Ravensbruck, that's a date that I also wrote but right now I'm so upset, when I'm\nthinking about this Canada, the , the search.",
        "A: Yes. I think February 24 I think?",
        "A: February 11\", right. January 18\" we were chased and then we came six days later, the six-day\nmarch, and then we came in February 11. And there was also, this was the only concentration\ncamp, death camp, on German soil that has also gas chambers.",
        "A: Ravensbruck.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: What was it like? Same kind of suffering, same kind of suffering still. They still didn't let go.\nAnd I made a stew and Esther dead. They took us, this time we didn't have to walk already, they\ntook us with trucks. And they brought us to another concentration camp in Malchow, Germany. In\nthe Malchow, Germany they had no gas chambers.",
        "A: Not very much. It was not a long time. It was already confusion. Did some work but it was not\nalready as extensive as it was in Auschwitz.",
        "A: We did work but, yes we did work. I'm trying to think because I know I worked in an\nammunition factory, but that was in Malchow. Because I remember we sabotaged a lot of the things\nthere.",
        "A: We did work. I don't remember exactly what type of work we did there. To an ammunition\nfactory or something. There was not any Canada or anything like this here anymore. I don't\nremember. I don't have that many because Auschwitz, other towers, everything , this\nis why I, the others is, but I know that there was crematoriums. I was less shielded.",
        "A: It wasn't as huge. I didn't hear the orchestra playing so that was the, and there wasn't so many\npeople. And I didn't stay so long so there I have, when I speak even though I was there but I must\nnot speak of Auschwitz because that's where, it was the last day when I came with family, that was\nthe last day on earth for my entire family. Thousands of Jews from the ghetto Nove Mesto\nincluding my friends and relatives. And the first day of , that's why Auschwitz\nwas the worst of it, Birkenau, that was the worst.",
        "A: Yes, we did work but I don't, I remember that after that, after Auschwitz, I no longer worked on\nthe outside commando. So it must either an ammunition factory or something. To be very honest\nwith you I don't remember because I didn't stay that long there. But I know that there was gas\nchambers and I know they wouldn't just sit and not do anything.",
        "A: Not everybody, not everybody because it depended on the length of time. That had a lot to do, it\ndepended on the physical strength of a person. Some were, not just people but they were\nfortunate they didn't get sick because if you got sick it's the end. I don't remember Ravensbruk (ph)\nin as many details but I know it was, the people there was more Polish people in Ravensbruk (ph).\nA lot of Polish people and some were a little older too. So it seems like they allowed older people\nmaybe more there to come.",
        "A: And they took and brought me to Malchow. And I came there with Binna too. And there, to my\nrecollection, there was no gas chambers anymore. We still were treated badly, we still had little\nfood. The only good better thing was, and we went every day to work, and the conditions were\nhorrible. The only better thing was for me personally, for Binna, that we didn't work outside.\nBecause outside, winter or summer, without clothes, the proper clothes without. That was, and we\nworked inside and we, there I remember exactly what, an ammunition factory. And I know that\nthey gonna use this ammunition maybe against us or other people so whenever we could sabotage\nsomething we did.",
        "A: How? You know, like if you\u2019re suppose to put it on this way you put it in the opposite. I didn't\nhave any tools or anything to sabotage it but not to do it. And if you could work slower we worked\nslower, you know, the productions. And we knew, whatever we can we didn't want to do to help the\nNazis. To help them to succeed.",
        "A: With what?",
        "A: That was a pretty veiled conception. We all wanted all the time but what could we do? We\ncouldn't. In Auschwitz I couldn't, what could I sabotage?",
        "A: Some word would get out and some we saw other people doing it. It was not discussed, we were\nafraid to talk. You know, somebody, you never knew who can hear us or something. But we saw\nthat whenever we could, not to do properly or something, then we did it. If it would be, I don't\nknow. Knowing myself, I don't know, if I had opportunity to damage the Nazis, that I don't know if\nI could do. But the things that helped them to kill people, that I did with good conscious.",
        "A: Not a question enjoyed, but almost felt like a responsibility. It felt that, they used everything for\ndestruction, you know? People can be creators or destroyers of life. Everything can be used for\ngood and evil. That is the education, I was dreaming about a formal education but I tell you, there 1s\nno substitute for personal experience. And what this experience in the concentration camp taught\nme no professor, no text books, no school could teach me. Because there you had the consequences\nof your action. When, learning, book learning is important but it doesn't have consequences. It's\nnot the same thing. It's one thing to read about slavery than being a slave. It's one thing about\nlosing, if somebody lost a family, than losing your own. Same thing about suffering, about\nbelieving from that my ancestors were in Egypt, its different when you go on yours.\nThen you know. And then something happens inside you. Depending on your attitude. You\nbecome either bitter or better. My mother's last words were not to become bitter and hateful and not\nto let them destroy, and I realize this now. That hate is the most destructive thing.",
        "A: Well I can tell that Malchow? I just felt everyday, everyday was like you want another lease on\nlife. I know that the worse the condition got the longer it took. We tried to encourage each other\nagain, maybe tomorrow, don't give up, hold on. That was like a , don't give up. Don't\ngive them the victory, don't give them the final victory. And we just went, we knew we were\ntrapped and we were hoping for a miracle. And not knowing if its going to happen. It just went on.\nWorked and another day, another day, not knowing what's going to happen.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We didn't have contacts with anyone. From 1942, until I came to concentration camp. Actually\nfrom the ghettos we knew nothing, until I came to the ghetto, before the ghetto I could still hear\nrumors or something but nobody, we didn't have, who could tell us? The only people that we saw\nwhen I was in concentration camp is the inmates and the Nazis.",
        "A: No I didn't because I didn't know. Because, I had been told not to build, not to assume. An\nassumption is different from a fact. So I didn\u2019t know, so I didn't make any assumption. I just hoped\nand prayed and tried to hold on for as long as I could. That's all.",
        "A: I was there until I was liberated on, during Passover, April 26, 1945.",
        "A: What happened? That's an interesting story. I woke up one morning. No .\nCommotion. And then the Swedish Red Cross came to save us. Not everybody. They took out\nmostly those who were sick and by that time I was pretty sick. And Binna and I, and a few other\npeople, there was a girl, Franya Gilman (ph), she was also on our truck. And ironically, being\ndeceived by the Nazis about this, Red Cross. When I saw this Red Cross I was afraid to go up. But\nyou know, people convey messages by words, by their emotion, by their body language. And those\npeople didn't seem like Nazis. First of all, they didn't wear the uniforms. And I felt that this is not,\nbut at first there was fear to go up. But, so they took us on the trucks. From on the date that I gave\nyou and the war was still going on because it didn't finish officially. So a bomb, a part of a bomb\nfell in our truck and it hit Franya Gilman (ph) and Franya Gilman (ph) had to have her foot\namputated. That was already toward the end, on the way. And from there we traveled from\nGermany to via Copenhagen.",
        "A: I didn't see the Nazis. I don't know what's happened to them. I didn't see anybody. All of a\nsudden I didn't see, in the commotion, we didn't know, something . And frankly I\ndidn't know what was going on. I didn't know if I should be happy or should be unhappy, I didn't\nknow what was going on. But then they came and they helped me. By that time I was pretty sick.\nAnd they helped me to come to a truck, they helped me up. And we came to, we traveled. It took a\nwhole day. At night I remember we were in a barn, in Copenhagen, Denmark, Copenhagen.",
        "A: No, no. By bus. Not bus, by trucks. Trucks also. But not such a, not with Nazis anymore. And\nI didn't know what to think, I felt sick and I didn't know already but I saw from the way they\ntouched us because the Nazis never would touch us because we were full of lice and\n. And those people seemed to be kind and we came Denmark. So we stayed\nover night in a barn. And after that they brought us to Lund, Sweden. A university city, to a\nhospital. And I was alive but I had no home to live in so the hospital, they gave me my first home\nafter liberation. But before we went in we had to strip again, naked, throw away the tattered\nconcentration camp shift, and we got a bed. And after all those years, nearly six years, I saw myself\nin front of the mirror. I couldn't speak a lot of Swedish, or understand. I was stateless, homeless,\npenniless, jobless. Unlike my non-Jewish fellow survivors, I couldn't go back home to my family,\nto my relatives, to my friends because Jewish home, Jewish families and Jewish communities were\ndestroyed. I had no one left, to help me, to love me, to wait for me, or to miss me. But I missed\nterrible, everybody. And I remember the shock I got when I saw myself for the first time in the\nmirror. I didn't know myself. I didn't see myself all those years. And it was no sign of\nwomanhood. Another thing, during this Auschwitz I didn't get my period. Until this day, I don't\nknow the reasons why. That was malnutrition or whether they were putting something in the food?\nI would suspect its malnutrition. And I didn't know if I am going to be like a normal woman. And\nwhen I saw myself in the mirror, I started to scream. The nurses didn't know what's happened. And\nI didn't know how to explain. [end of side 1 of tape 4] Anyhow, I, it was a coincidence because I\nwas born during Passover and I was liberated during Passover. And I had less, I had more on the\nday when I was born than the day of liberation. Not a tangible shred was left of my pre-war\nchildhood world. Not a single document, not a family annual, not a photograph, nothing. And the\nSwedish people in the hospital were very kind. Very, very kind, very caring. And to me, if I didn't\nget beaten that was already a lucky day. Because then I started to realize I didn't know anything\nwhat was happen, with Hitler, I didn't know what's Germany, I didn't know how the war is. I was\naway from the war for nearly six years, not having any contact, isolated from the whole world. Not\nreading, not knowing anything. I only knew what I sensed, what I felt and what I, by comparison.\nAnd I talked to myself and I started to realize how one person can make a difference. This was\nGentile people and this was Gentile people. One destroyed so many of my people, the other saved\nthem. And I started to understand many, many things. Not immediately, because in the beginning I\nwas too sick to think and it was lonely. Binna fortunately survived too. At what point I realized...",
        "A: When I was with the Swedish Red Cross. Then I started to realize, when we were going, when\nwe came to Copenhagen and I saw that they treat us, it was like between night and day, the contrast.\nThey treat us kindly, the others treated us cruel. They took care of us.",
        "A: At first I was afraid to go because I didn't know. What the Red Cross represented to me\ndestruction of so many people at first. But then I didn't see any Nazis. I wasn't, I was naive, I was\nyoung but I wasn't completely stupid. And I could see that, the difference of the way they treated us\nand, you know? They fed us.",
        "A: It was a tremendous shock, a tremendous, the transition was not, I didn't, all the time I dreamt\nabout being free but the every day struggle to survive, to get through the day, not to be put to the gas\nchambers, not to be maimed, not to be, health, and to live. It was the struggle to survive so that you\ncouldn't think about all the other things. You were with everybody together. Many people together,\nwe were on the same boat like we used to say. But when we were liberated, and when I came there,\nI couldn't speak the language. I was 19 years old. I couldn't understand a word of anything. A\nstranger in a strange world. Not having anyone. And all of a sudden, in the beginning right away I\ndidn't even think so much. I was too sick, too tired, the shock was very much. But then the very\nfirst time, I will never forget, but this was later, but I'm sharing now an experience when I was the\nfirst ttme, or maybe I should go when I come to it.",
        "A: I was in the hospital there. I was getting good care. The contrast was a sharp contrast from the\nway the Nazis treated us here. And I remember one thing I was thinking, if this 1s, I remember I\nwas seeing the differences because I always had the ability because I was creative to compare. I\nsaid, \"This is Gentiles and this is Gentiles.\" So good and evil, no one has a monopoly on it. It has\nmore to do with the . With who you are as a human being. What you believe about\nyourself, about God and about others. That effects your behavior. And therefore, I realized even\nmore what my mother's last words, don't become hateful and bitter, don't let them destroy you, I\nrealized what tragedies and hatred is. And the more the Nazis tortured me, the more I was\ndetermined never to become like them, to view myself through their eyes. And here I saw kind\npeople. I had a very, very wonderful memories. Very, very grateful to the Swedish people, the way\nthey helped me. They helped me to get on my feet. I have nothing. I came in, like I said, I had\nmore on the day I was born. Here I went in the hospital, I came in nude because they couldn't allow\nthis filthy dress to come in this here, the first thing, we came in and took the showers and they\nhelped me to bathe, covered, nurse me back to health. And for this I will be always grateful because\nI learned not to take anyone or anything for granted. Because its very easy to lose everything. And\nwe stayed in the hospital and then, I think I gave you all the dates, right?",
        "A: Otherwise I have everything, I have it all written down.",
        "A: Right. Because on the 26\" I was liberated. On the 27\" I was in Copenhagen. The 28\" I arrived.\nAnd at that time, when I started to get healthy I started to examine and to re-evaluate everything.\nWhat is it? Who 1s responsible? And basically what I was interested 1s, in the beginning, to regain\nmy health. I started concentrating on regaining my health because I realize that health is wealth,\nhealth is important because if you\u2019re sick and you are alone, you cannot do very much. And I was\nvery much aware that I no longer have anyone to love me, to protect me, to take care of me. So I\nneeded to become my own parent and start taking care of myself. Of course, Binna and I were still\nvery devoted and very loyal to each other and we were each other's family at the time. And I was\nthere in the hospital, I got very good care. I also was always fortunately a good student and always\nloved language, words. I always realized the power of words, so I was very eager to learn Swedish.\nSo while there, I started, they were very kind to me, they gave me a dictionary and I started to learn\na little bit. And to recover. And I was in Lund, Sweden until May 7, 1945. From there I was sent\nto Dod-ug-stup (ph) in Sweden. It's called Dod-ug-stup (ph), it's you know? And\nthis was DP Camp, which in Swedish is called . On Rinks-vagen (ph) 20 B, that\nwas the address. Now there we were in a quarantine, we still couldn't go out because the people\nwere afraid, if we are, if we don't carry any diseases or, so we were not treated badly, in fact we\nwere treated very nice. However, we only got 50 cents a week, it's 50 , which is like 50\ncents here, for pocket money. And we started, the people from the town came to the, there was also\na fence, but was not barbed wires, it was not electrocuted wires, and we would come to the fence\nand they looked. Some came and we would give them sometimes the money and ask them to buy\nlittle trinkets for us. And there was a couple with a young son, must have been maybe early 20's,\nand with the few words that I could speak we made contact. I already recovered a little bit, looked a\nlittle better. And I didn't think of myself at that time as a woman yet, but obviously he thought of\nme that way, and he asked me, and in the broken Swedish with the dictionary, I understood that\nwhen I get allowed, when I will be allowed to get out from the quarantine, will I go on a date with\nhim. And that was the first date of my life, okay? So I was very excited and anxious. I didn't know\nhow I'm going to know how to behave with a man, I didn't see a man for all those years. I didn't\nhave any experience in dating and mating. I went out with him. It was a very, very painful\nexperience for me. Because as soon as we started to talk, and not very much, he paid me a\ncompliment, you don't look Jewish. And that was like a knife in my, twisted in my heart. Here I\nsuffered so much and I'm not Jewish? And again, he doesn't see me as a human being. Yes, I'm not\ndenying my Jewishness, I'm proud to be who Iam. Would I be born a Gentile, I would be proud to\nbe Gentile, but I'm born, I didn't make choices about this. It hit me so hard, and I don\u2019t believe he\nmeant it in a bad way, in a malicious way. He was a kind person. But for somehow he reminded\nme who I am, not that I ever forgot it. And I said, \"Good-bye.\" Excuse myself with tears in my\neyes and I left. And I made a decision. Never will I go out with somebody who is not Jewish\nbecause I'm the only link left, the only daughter left of my family. I cannot do it to my family or to\nmy people or to myself. And in our camp there, in the DP Camp, was a woman which was called,\nwe called her , means she was a Rabbi's wife, so the husband is a Rabbi, she is\nthe Rabbi's wife. So she was the Rabbi's wife and she was orthodox and she took a great interest,\nshe wanted the children, those who are under 21, to remain Jewish. So she took us, she told us there\nis a camp that she wanted to take us. Also, we were not still completely free to go. A kosher, a\ncamp. It was no, it was, I prefer kosher to not kosher of course at that time, but it wasn't so much\nthe kosher because in the concentration camp I ate not kosher, so, but it was that I felt I need to be\nwith Jewish people.",
        "A: The DP Camp was only Jewish, but when I went out, and he tells me this here, I was too\nwounded yet from the whole experience. Maybe if he would say today I would laugh it off, it\nwouldn't even have mattered to me this much. But at that time, I wanted to be accepted for who I\nam because I realized by that time, if I cannot be accepted for who I am surely I will not be accepted\nfor what I am not. So I wanted somebody to accept me for, it's not that I had anything about a\nGentile or anything, but I wanted to be, I needed to be among my people who are Jewish in order to\nknow that I don't, shouldn't be told you don\u2019t look Jewish, or be accepted for who I am. So I\nvolunteered to go to the camp. And on July 10, 1945 I left and I went to Hel-shin-\nfel-hol-it (ph), this is what the place called. However, there was something which was troubling\nme. I wanted Binna to come too. I didn't want to separate. I thought of Binna as my extended\nfamily. The Rabbi's wife said, \"Itka, I don't want to separate you from your friend, but I can't take\nher. Not now at least. Because I cannot make exceptions.\" And she was three years older so she\ncould no longer go. But she said, \"I give you my word that after a few weeks, I will bring her too.\nBut not right now because then I cannot give about this.\" So I decided to go and I told\nBinna that I'm going to try to make sure that she comes later. And the Rabbi's wife certainly kept\nher promise and she brought Binna there too.",
        "A: The DP Camps?",
        "A: In the first camp there was hardly anything. There was just the emphasis on restoring us to\nhealth. Even when I came there, I was not physically that strong yet. So the emphasis was on\nrestoring, to get us used to a normal life, 1f you can call it normal. And so there was not much, we\nrested basically. We didn't do very much. It was more recuperating. It was like a convalescent\nhome you would go from a hospital, that sense, except better because we were already, we were not\ninvalids.",
        "A: No. Not at that point. Nothing yet. At that point it was just plain start putting us a little in the,\nnow when I came to Hem-shed (ph), we observed strictly the Shabbat. In fact, Mr. Pound (ph) was\nthe name of the and he could only speak Swedish. He was the, in Swedish was the\n. This was like the manger, like the, whatever you call it, when somebody is in\ncharge of. He couldn't speak a single word of other language, just Swedish. So he asked, \"Is there\nanyone who can speak Swedish a little?\" . I learned quickly the\nlanguage. While I was there, I was always with the dictionary and trying to learn the language. So\nhe, I became his helper in the office. I had no training to be in an office and I wasn't asked to do any\noffice work. My job consisted basically, translating. If somebody came in and needed something.\nWe got sheets and pillow cases and things like this from there, so we needed to change them, I\nwould be in charge of this here. If somebody, basically helping him translate and do duties like this\nbut no office work because I had no training in this here.",
        "A: I have no idea. At that time I didn't know, I was still not having, I was in the world already, in\nthe normal world but it wasn't yet a normal life for me, it was not. So I would rather not say and tell\nyou something which I have no knowledge. But I know it must have been, I don't know. Now I'm\nasking, I'm glad you\u2019re asking those question because maybe I'm going to ask around to find out.",
        "A: Yeah, it could be somebody, maybe the Red Cross or maybe the Swedish . . .",
        "A: Yeah, somebody. But who? I don't know at that time. But we had good meals. It was in a very\nnice place, physically it was a nice place, nice surroundings. A lot of nice greens and it felt good.\nWhen we came there we didn't have anything. Everybody got a suit case, the same kind, and a\nchange of clothes next to what we were wearing. And sheets, pillow cases, soaps, towels, this we\ngot from there. And I was working there and then at one point, I start to feel that I no longer want to\nbe in collective life. I want to start a life on my own because when its collective, it has advantages,\nbut it has the disadvantage. You don't develop an identity as much. I needed to start a field, build a\nlife. So Binna and another girl, Regina Shapiro (ph), who was there also, we were assigned to go,\nwe got our first job. And this, I didn't have any, I was 19 years old. I had no marketable skills and\nonly seven grade of public school and a few grades of Hebrew school. So I didn't have, I had to\ntake whatever job they would give me as long as it was respectable. And on November 18, 1945 I\nleft, Binna Gold-gramp (ph) and Regina Shapiro (ph) and I left and we went to a , it\ncalled Redland-da (ph),\n, you know, not so far from Bar-oss (ph). At that time I didn't know where its\nlocated. And Binna saw that we were, I mean Regina saw that we were like sisters and she was all\nalone so she asked us if she wants to be with us. And I said of course. So we went to work.",
        "A: Yes, at that time we could leave. That was because when I came there in was in\nJuly and we went on November 18\", so by that time, yes, we could leave. Of course, a lot was still\nlacking to my complete health and everything else, but I was ready, I wanted to assume a job.",
        "A: Not once. I knew that they didn't. I knew that my immediate, when you say immediate family,\ndoesn't...",
        "A: I didn't go to Poland. I didn't have the means, I didn\u2019t have the strength, I didn't have the know-\nhow, I didn't have the money, I didn't have anything. I just stayed, this is why later, towards the\nend, I'm going to just make a summation and you are going to see why I realized that, I'll talk about\nthis later because then its going to make more sense than now. Anyhow, so when we went to work\nhere, we came, that was my first job. Freedom by choice. Until that date, whatever I did is where\nthey sent me, even to go into , to the kosher , the DP camp. I don't\nknow if we didn't call it, we called it . I didn\u2019t even know that it exist, DP camp,\nso I was still cut off of the world. I had no communication because I wasn't on my own, I didn't\nhave any radio, I didn't have, you know those things, papers and things. I couldn't read too well yet\nto be able to understand, so it was pretty tough still. And when I came to , on my\nfirst job I had a very traumatic experience. I came willing to except any job providing its\nrespectable. I was determined, if I survived Auschwitz with dignity I will not, I was determined on\nthree things not to give up, on my life, on my and on my freedom. Because I realized\nwithout it life is not worth living for me. And I came there, there was basically a very tiny village.\nThere was a sanatorium for children with TB. And most of the inhabitants there, I don't know how\nmuch the population, were people who were elderly people. Single, elderly people. There was\nvery, I don't think there was anybody my age there. But at that time I didn't think about those\nthings. I was just grateful and why I accepted the job also because it was room and board and I\nwould still get paid a little. And I need that to have because that was, I didn't have a home still. I\ndidn't have an apartment or anything on my own yet.",
        "A: Mr. Pound helped me out. Mr. Pound liked me a lot. In fact, he said to me, we got to know each\nother and he liked me a lot and he said, \"Itka, if this doesn't work out you come back to me. I have a\nwife and children and we'll take you in until you get on your feet.\" He was very nice. He was not\ninterested in me as a woman, he was interested as a human being, to help me. He saw me as a\nhomeless child. And he offered, but I was determined to make it on my own. And we went there,\nand the general boss was a very nice woman. She would sometimes invite me for a walk, to go with\nher, she would help me a little with Swedish. Anyone who didn't help me was nice to me then, you\nknow? The comparisons, you know? That's what I said, when you heard me saying a reference\nwith which to compare. And she took me into the kitchen, assigned me to work in the kitchen. In\ncontrast, the woman who was the manager of the kitchen, she was the general manager. The\nwoman who was in the kitchen for no apparent reason hated me with a passion. From the moment\nshe brought me in. Why? I have no idea and it doesn't surprise me. Half of the world hated me,\nthat I didn't care and I survived, so I didn't worry about it anymore. However, she assigned me to\nher and one day the general boss said to me, \"Make the sandwiches.\" As soon as she left, she would\nsay, \"Scrub the floor\", or do something that was not as easy or as good as the other job. But I\nfigured, I came here to work and I'm going to do what they tell me until I'm able to get on my feet\nand then I'll see. And I worked there and I got paid, not too much. And Binna, Regina and I shared\none room and we got room and board. One day was my half a day off and I was going to leave and\nthey burst from the kitchen, made like \"Don't go!\" And all of a sudden I had a flashback from\nconcentration camp and I was getting nervous. And I very politely ask, \"Why not?\" \"There are still\ndishes\", she answered. And I said, \"There will always be dishes in our hospital, but it's my half a\nday off.\" Because I was thinking, if she would have asked me I would have gladly stayed. Because\nthen I have a choice. But when I'm ordered I have no choice. And if I accept it once, the beginning\nis the most important, than I'm going to have to do it all the time. And I'll lose my freedom and I'm\nnot ready to, after Auschwitz, never again will I give up my freedom willingly.",
        "A: Nope. And I marched out. After Auschwitz I'm not afraid of anything. Just to do something to\ndisgrace myself or my family. Other things I'm not afraid. What can scare me after Auschwitz?\nAnd as soon as I walked out, and I came to my room, this so-called good manager comes in and she\nsays to me, \"Itka, I heard what's happened. But would you do it for me? Go back?\" And I had\nmixed feelings. The heart said one thing, the head said another. But I went back. Walking on the\nway, everything in me revolted. I said, \"I'm sorry, I can't do it.\" I started to cry and I run back in\nand I didn't go in. I had been taught as a child that never make serious decision, long range decision\nwhen you\u2019re under emotional strain. So I told myself, I said, suppose I left?) Where am I going to\ngo? I have no home. The only option is to go to Mr. Pound and I don't want to do that. To be a\nburden for them. What future is there for me? It also meant to leave Binna, to separate from Binna.\nBecause I didn't dare ask her, come with me, when I have nothing to offer. Not a place, not an\napartment, not a job. So I said, no, I can't do it. So I went to the good boss and I told her how I feel\nabout it, and I said, \"Listen. I have no home and no place to go. But I am a survivor of a\nconcentration camp. I got so much abuse that I promised that I will never allow anybody to abuse\nme again or give up my freedom. So I will gladly stay because I don\u2019t have any other place to go.\nGive me any job. I don't mind scrubbing toilet. Job doesn't scare me. I was working carrying stone\nand things. But I want to be treated with dignity. If somebody wants something from me, let them\nask. And if I can I will gladly give, but I don't take orders anymore.\" And she said, \"I'm sorry. I\nwould gladly do it but she has been working for me for 36 years. I can't afford to lose her.\" After\nthat I had no longer to think. So I figured, so again not justice. It's just for convenient for me. At\nthat point I said, whatever is involved, whatever risk, I must take it. I went in with tears in my eyes,\nI said good-bye to both my friends. They didn't offer to come and I didn't ask them. At that time I\ndidn't even consider, I didn't even, now I am thinking, how come I didn't offer to come Binna? I\nwouldn't let them anyhow, but they didn't. You know, everything went so fast. And I picked\nmyself up and I went. Like Buncho (ph) the Silent. Went to the world with no one, an orphan, with\nno one to care. And when I came to the train, they asked me where do you want to go?\nEnd of Tape 4.\nTape 5",
        "A: Somewhere. And when I came to the train, running not walking, because I want to make the\ntrain. I didn't have too many belongings to take with me, I didn't have very much. And I didn't even\nhave time to buy the ticket at the office, at the station, but I boarded on the train. And the conductor\nasked me, \"Where are you going?\" I said, \"To the nearest, largest city.\" Because I didn't know\nSweden at that time, I hadn't been around yet. So he said, \"Boss (ph)? Boss (ph), Sweden? You\nknow Boss (ph)?\" I said, \"Okay.\" And that's where I learned. When I came into Boss (ph),\nSweden, I did not know a single soul. I had no home. And all of a sudden it dawned on me. Where\nam I going now? Now I am completely alone. No family, and not even friends. My two friends are\nalso without me. Where am I going to sleep? What am I going to do? And I walked quite a while,\nmostly I was completely oblivious of time, I didn't know, and in desperation, when I started to\nrealize my situation, that I have nothing. I have no money. I have no home. I'm a homeless person\nand I'm all alone. Even as bad as it was in concentration camp, I knew this is where I'm going to\nsleep at night. Here, I don't have anything. And I must admit I was concerned. And all of a sudden\nI looked up to Heaven and I found myself praying. And I remember exactly what I said, inside\nmyself. Dear God, I am all alone and I am helpless. I'm in your hands. Guide me. I don't want to\ndo something to disgrace myself or my family. And I had been walking, I don't know how long,\nand then all of a sudden I thought that I hear somebody saying, \"Yit-cola.\" I said, am I losing my\nmind? I'm hearing voices? And again I hear repeating, \"Yit-cola.\". And I look around and a girl\nfrom concentration camp recognized me. She lived in Boss (ph). And I tell her my story and she\nsaid, \"Don't worry. We are concentration camp survivors. We can share whatever we have. Come\nup.\" And I stayed overnight. She directed me how to go to the unemployment office, the next day,\nand I went. They asked me, did you work before? I told them, yes. Why did you leave? I said, \"I\ntell you the truth, there's no young people. And I wanted to start a new life. There was nobody for\nme to associate with.\" Which was not a lie. But that was not the only reason because eventually I\nwould have left anyhow. But it didn't dawn on me. She asked me to come back, that she's going to\ncheck out my story. Because I wasn't used to telephones yet because I didn't have a telephone. And\nshe checked out the story and when I came back, she asked me, \"Why did you try to protect her?\"\nAnd I said, \"Listen. I didn't leave, I'm not going to gain anything by making her look bad.\" You\nknow, my manager from the kitchen. \"I just don't have a future there. And I left for this reason, but\nI also eventually would have left anyhow because there is no life for me.\" And I told her a little bit,\nnot much, but I told her that I have two friends who stayed there and I want to be with them, can she\nfind a job for me, for them too? And she did find me a job. However, in Sweden was a custom.\nThat you only, if you worked for somebody they provided you with an apartment. You paid for it\nbut if you stopped working you no longer could use that apartment. So I went to work and, when I\nhad already a job for the three of us, and an apartment, I got in touch with my friends and I brought\nthem over. With Regina it didn't work out too well because there was, two is okay, four is okay,\nthree is a little part in our relationship. Because Binna and I, except for underwear, shared\neverything. Even after we were liberated. It wasn't mine and yours. Money, time, work. She felt\nbetter if she did for me, if I did better I did for her. So we were like sisters. Regina wasn't, she was\nmore, she was a nice girl but, like, this 1s mine, this is yours, and we were not accustom because\neven in Auschwitz we shared. So we decided that she's going to have for herself a room. So we\nwere on the second floor, was also a little room. So Binna and I shared one room, she\nshared another room. In Sweden, the custom was the dinner was not in the evening, it was during\nlunchtime. Since I was brought up in Poland and there was no ready-made foods and everything, so\nI was still accustom to do, I knew a little bit how to cook because when I was at home I used to help\nmy and my parents, you know? Chop this and... so I knew that my mother tried to\nteach me everything, what she could, and I would, we would make meals together. And every day\nsomebody would go take turns, one day Binna would go and warm up the food a little early and I\ndid, I had a day when I didn't feel so good she would help. We were really devoted to each other.\nAnd one day, I was walking home from work and I was rushing. I was always very fast and\nenergetic. And bingo, I'm on the ground. And I feel that from the elbow, from the back,\nsomebody's helping me up. I turn around. And it was a man. I thanked him and he starts talking to\nme and he notices that I have an accent. And we start talking and he had an accent too and we\nfound out that we are both survivors of the Holocaust. And he tells me that he lives on the same\nstreet, he asked me where I lived, I told him, the same street. But he lives in a hotel and I was, I got\na small apartment. He helped me home and he tells me that his father was, not a , but\nyou know like a self-made ; . There used to be a lot of people like\nhome-made remedies and he was going to clean up my knees and bandage, I was still, even though I\nwent through Auschwitz, but I still was not the kind of girl that would let him see my knees, you\nknow? So I said, no thank you. And I warmed up the food and offered him some food. And he\nsaid it smelled nice and everything, and he said, \"Oh, I would gladly pay to have a meal like this.\"\nAnd I said, \"I don\u2019t run a restaurant. However, if you want to have a home-made meal, during the\nweek we work, I don't have the time, but on Sunday you're welcome. Binna and I is going to be\nhome. You can come up and have dinner with us.\" His name is in Yiddish, Avrum Schmol-lev-itz\n(ph), now he called himself Abe. And Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) started to come. I don\u2019t know\nhow I should call it, to date me? But he would come constantly visiting. Showed a great interest in\nme. I liked him very much as a friend. Very loyal, well devoted, caring. But I didn't have any\nfeelings for him otherwise. And he was coming to our home for almost a year. Now, at that time,\nthey sent to Sweden, when we came to Sweden, all the women were there. . There\nwere other women from Sweden too, that were survivors. But the men they sent in other places. So\nthere were only two men in our city. So there was no prospect for somebody to find, you know? So\neverybody, Binna and everybody else is saying, \"Itka, you're so lucky. You have a man who likes\nyou so much.\" And, I don\u2019t know, I never talked with him about love because I certainly didn't love\nhim. I loved him as a human being, as a good person, but no otherwise. And I remember that\nBinna said, \"Oh, I would be lucky to find a man like this.\" And, \"Why don't you marry him?\" And\nI said, \"You like him, you marry him.\" Anyhow, I didn't marry him and Avram, in Yiddish we\nactually called him Avrum because we spoke Yiddish, he received, found out that he has two sisters\nwho live in America, who survived. I don\u2019t know where, I don't know too much about those things.\nAnd they send him a visa. And I could have gone with him to America but I did not want to go.\nBecause I said, I'm not going to negate myself in any way. If I'm going to marry someone it's going\nto be somebody who I have deep feelings for. Love not only as a friend but as a .\nAnd anyhow, one time, Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) comes up to our apartment and he tells me, he\ninvites me to come to his apartment. I got so angry. I said, \"After knowing me so long don't you\nknow I'm not the kind of girl that doesn't go to a man's apartment?\" You know, we were brought\nup, you had to be a virgin when you got married, it's not like today, you know? And he said, \"Sha-\nsha, I'm not just inviting you. I'm inviting Binna too and there are going to be other people.\" And I\ndidn't know at that time yet what's, and I came. And this was either June 24, 1946, yes, it was\nalready 1946. June 26 or, I think it was June the 24\" in 1946, and I come to the party and as I come\nin with Binna, there are lots of guests, and I didn't know that this was the party for his, farewell\nparty, good-bye party, bon voyage party. He was leaving for America. And as I come in a man sits\nthere and as soon as I look at him and he looks at me, he moves a little bit and makes room and says\nto me in Polish, \"Please sit here.\" And I sit down next to him, and from the first moment, I care\ndeeply about him. And I started to get worried, what about Binna? And he, I found out later that\nAvrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) and this man, and I'll tell you later who he was, knew each other from\nthe same hometown and the man that this man came with was also from the same hometown. From\nBell-hot-off (ph), Poland. They're all survivors and they knew each other from home, they went\nfrom . And found out later that there were even some cousins also between these men.\nAnd he, what I found later out, that he knew already that I am not going to get involved with him so\nhe said to his friend, \"If she cannot be for me at least let her be for you.\" Because he considered me\nto be okay, I don't know what he thought about me, but he wanted me to get a nice man. And the\nperson that I met there was Rockmiel Zygmuntowicz (ph), my husband. And after, and he ask me\ncan he take us home. So I said to him, \"You came with your friend. Why don't you invite him too\nand we'll go together?\" Because I wanted for Binna to have somebody, to make ;\nyou know how is, to be the matchmaker. And he said, \"Okay.\" And they want\nto go upstairs and I said, \"No, it's too late. After a certain hour nobody comes to our apartment.\" So\nhe said, \"Promise me that you're going to wait for me.\" He worked in shifts from morning until\n2:00 and from 2:00 to 11:00. That I'm going to wait. He got a job and the other man was\n, which turned out later to be Binna's husband. And he said to\ncome, will we wait for him? And I agreed. Anyhow, I met him a couple of times and\nstarted to date Binna too. And one time, Rockmiel (ph) says to me, \"Do you know a\ngirl, her name is Manya Mo-nes-ka (ph)?\" And I said, \"By sight I don't know much about her. I\njust know she's a pretty girl. That's all I know about her, from sight. Why are you asking?\" And he\ntells me that her brother was with him from where he came from, another city in Sweden, and he\nasked him to meet his sister. He wanted to make a match. He didn't tell me at the time though that\nhe gave him a letter, he really was trying to make a match. So I said, \"Why don't you go?\" And\nBinna kicks me under the table, she said, \"Are you crazy? You're going to send a cat for\n. You like him so much and you're going to send him to another girl?\" I said. \"Yes. If\nhe likes her better, it's better he makes the choice now than later.\" And she didn't like that so she\nsent . He came back and he said, \"Now we can get engaged.\" So a week\nlater, after I met him, I was engaged. And on July 13, 1946, before Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) left\nto go to America, we had a double wedding. Binna married Mendal Crook (ph) and I married\nRockmiel Zygmuntowicz (ph). That was the happiest and the most tragic day of my life. Happy\nbecause obviously I love my husband, we loved each other. But he is the sole survivor of a large\nfamily. He was one of seven. Only one sister died before the Holocaust and the rest of his family\ndidn't survive. And I was the sole survivor of my family. At least he had three at his\nwedding. I didn't have one single person from my hometown. One single person who knew me.\nMy family. And I remembered that when my, when we lived in Check-hon-off (ph), we used to, I\nmentioned before that we were kosher, so we would buy chickens, ducks, geese. And from the\nchicken feathers we took to the ritual slaughter and then they would pluck, it wasn't ready-made like\nhere, so all the other feathers they threw away. But from the geese and from the ducks, they would\nsave it. The down. And this was suppose to be for a trousseau, for Yit-cola (ph), when she's going\nto get married. And whenever they had a wish, they said they should live to see me under the\n, which means under the canopy. And here I was all alone. I had no one. And it hit\nme. The only person I had is my husband, Binna and , who was my dear friend.\n, bless his memory, he is no longer alive, he died several years ago. And at our\nwedding, I had a borrowed dress. I didn't have anything. We married deliberately during vacation,\nthe week of vacation, because we didn't have enough money for the next week. And on our\nhoneymoon, we didn't go anyplace and we cooked a big pot of soup. And for a whole week, the\nfour of us shared. This was our condition in the beginning. And yet, I've tried to make a go of it\nand Binna and I made a switch. I shared with her my apartment and Mandle (ph) and Rockmiel\n(ph) shared a little apartment when they came from the other city. So Binna went to live where\nRockmiel (ph) lived with Mendle (ph) and Mendle (ph) moved in with me and Binna moved out, in\nthat little apartment. You don't understand? I had an apartment where I shared with Binna before I\nwas married. Mendle (ph) and Rockmiel (ph) came from another city and they had a little\napartment. So when we got married, so Binna went to live with Mendle (ph), it was her husband.\nAnd I lived with Rockmiel (ph). But there is something that, it\u2019s a curious thing, because I learn a\nlot from people. When an engagement we made, I didn't know too many people. So there was only\nBinna and Mendle (ph), Rockmeil (ph) and I, Avram, and two girls that I met in Boss (ph), that I\ndidn't know from before. One girl tells, who was invited there, Rose Lift-ka (ph) she was called at\nthat time, I don't know what's her, she was married, and she was very anxious to get married. She\nwas a lot older and there wasn't any boys to marry, the girls were worried that they won't find, and\nnot everybody wanted to marry out of their religion. So anyhow, we had a tiny room. All there was\nin the room is two single beds, a table and a couple of chairs. I didn't even have a stove in the room\nSO we went to going from the steps, to go up to the first floor, I took a little, made a little curtain or\ndrape and I bought a hot plate. And that's how I cooked. And from the sink that we used. But I\nwas Satisfied. So I went out to bring in the food. Anyhow, this girl says to me, I introduce my\nfianc\u00e9e when we got engaged, and she says to me, \"Yit-cola (ph), he's not for you.\" And I said,\n\"Why?\" And she said, \"He's too big a flirt.\" And I think to myself, wait a minute, I only deal with\nfacts. How would she know what he is, she just met him? She would say he's not attractive, she\ncan see, but how can she know he's a flirt? He's never, she never met him before. So I just ignored.\nAfter we were married, my husband asked me, \"Are you good friends?\" And I said, \"Just met her.\"\nBut I had no one else and I wanted somebody to be with us at our engagement. So he said, \"Did\nyou know that when you went out to , She invited me to come to her apartment without\nyou?\" I'm going to cook for you, I'm going to do this. And I thought to myself, you see how\nimportant is the thing for yourself. To think what people say and use your own common sense.\nThis is why I'm telling you the story. Anyhow, we were married and eventually my husband was\nworking very hard. And Mendle (ph) told me how hard he's working so I was upset about it so I\nwent and I gave up the job I had, which was that I could have, because, that he should be able to get\na better job. And I should get apartment, to get a little bigger apartment. And we were in Sweden\nand we didn't have anything, we started without anything. But we understood that it\u2019s a beginning\nand we worked hard. And then in 1948, and for a long time I was worried whether I'll be able to\nbear a child. Because I didn't get the period yet for so long. Finally I got the period. And anyhow,\nwe got an apartment. And you know, I'm telling you those stories because I'm seeing that all over,\nin every country and in every religion, and even in every home, there can be people who are good or\nnot so good. So anyhow, we had an apartment and this, in this house where I had the apartment\nfrom this lady, I had another job, she told me from the beginning that I'm not allowed to have any\nchildren in that home, in that place. Because there were only living people without children.\nMostly elderly people. And she put in our apartment two beds, single beds. And one time, at night,\nI hear somebody is opening the door. She came to check if we are sleeping together, and here I am\nmarried. And I always, I don\u2019t know so much about how I was when I was real young, but as far as\nI can remember, I was taught to think for myself and to trust myself. And my parents always gave\nme confidence, you know, that I had that, that I was able to trust myself. So I figured, let her say\nwhat she wants. I didn't argue, I didn't talk back. And it so happen that that's when I got pregnant,\nin that place. But I knew, as soon as it will be shown she will make me miserable. So again, I had\nto switch because I didn't want it to have, to worry, and somebody hear, so many of my people were\nmurdered. And here, I had worried for so long, if I'll be able to bear a child. Here I'm pregnant and\nsomebody looking down on me or not permitting me to have a child. I need her permission? So I\nstarted to look for an apartment to get, to keep the moving again. Anyhow, when, before, when I\nmoved into another, when I was pregnant I moved to another apartment. And I didn't know\nanything about how the human body works. A woman's body. And the doctor just told me the date,\nwhen to expect. And just told me two things, that I'll have pains, bleeding, then it's time to come.\nAll the time my husband and I was rehearsing. Where we going to go? How we going to go?\nEverything. It so happened he had still shift work. And he left in the morning and I woke up and\nmy water bag broke but at that time I didn't know that I had a water bag and I didn't know what it\nwas. I just saw it's not something that's, not, that I never had before. So I go in, I don't have a\nfriend, I don't have a family, I don't have anyone that lives near that I can ask. So I go into a\nneighbor, to ask her, what does that mean? She said, \"I don't know. Go ask the doctor.\" So she's\nadvising me to go ask the doctor. My husband is not home, I don\u2019t have a telephone number. And\nhere I see something is not right and I don't know what it is. So I take my bicycle and I'm going on\na bicycle to ask the doctor. And here my water bag is broken. And I came to the doctor and they\ndon't let me go home anymore. In the meantime, I'm showing you the different influences, how one\nthing influences the other. And in the meantime, my husband meets somebody in the street and\nthey ask him, how is Yit-cola (ph), and he told them that I am expecting the baby. And here I was a\nlittle bit . Anyhow, and this was already after he knew that I went on the bike to the\nhospital, that the water bag broke. And he tells her the story. So she says, \"Well, if the water bag\nbroke and the baby's not born then the baby cannot live.\" In the meantime, I gave birth to a healthy\nboy and my husband comes to the hospital and he comes in, I see the uncertainty on his face. He\nholds his hands behind his back and not a smile, no emotion. I said, \"What's going on here?\" And I\nwas wondering. No congratulations, no nothing. So distant and cold? I said, that's not my husband.\nThat's not the man I know. And I said to him, \"Mistletov, we have a son.\" And he get so excited\nand tears are in his eyes, and behind he had a bouquet of flowers but he was afraid to show them\nbecause she told him the baby might not live, and he thought maybe it was a mistake. So I'm\nshowing you, why am I telling you this story? I had no experience. I was alone. That when I\nneeded somebody, a mother, I needed relatives to help me, I had nobody. You know? And my son\nwas born October 12, 1948, the same year the State of Israel was born. Two miracles in my life. A\nson and after 2,000 years I lived to see the dream that my people prayed, the State of Israel. But\nunfortunately I didn't have relatives to share . And ever since I've been\nliberated, I couldn't even tell you the time because usually I know, that I feel, I told you\nI want to do something, but I couldn't put it in words. I knew that I had to go back\none day to Auschwitz. I never said good-bye to my family. I just knew that something is still not\nfinished yet. Anyhow, and I stayed in there. Then after that I was, started to work, no, the first year\nwe had no choice so we had to take, after my son was about a year, we took him to a nursery\nbecause we had nothing. We needed to work and I was suffering tremendously because I was\nbrought up with two loving women at home and a father. And, but I had no choice. And my little\nboy had an accident. He was accidentally, you know in Sweden we still didn't have the modern\nconveniences so we had a stove, a wood-burning stove, and I was use from Poland, so we washed\nthe diapers and we boiled them. And I even ironed them. And one day, by accident, and I always\ncaution him don't go to the stove, and the hot water spilled on him. And I thought that I'm going to\nlose him so I went with him to the hospital. I come back to the work, and my boss saw, the first day\nshe didn't say anything, and I wanted to stay, this is our little boy, he's . And she tells\nme, \"Your personal life is of no concern of mine.\" I didn\u2019t say anything and I thought to myself, I'm\nfree physically. Now I have to be independent financially too. And since my husband had shift and\ngot my child with others, and I started to go to fashion design school. And I'll show you, I have the\ndiploma. And I started to work. And when my second son was born, I no longer had to take him to\nthe nursery. I could be home with him. Now, Binna and I, as I mentioned before, had a double\nwedding. She was, before I got pregnant she was pregnant and she miscarried. So she got pregnant\nagain. I was early, she was, it turned out that we were, both she and I gave birth in the same\nhospital. Her first child was born on October 1, 1948. My son was born October 10, 1948. And\nsince in Sweden, so many adjustments. In Europe, we didn't know about formulas. So we used to\nnurse each others children. We were very close with each other. Anyhow, then in November 29,\n1951 my second son was born, . And as I said, I no longer needed to go to work outside\nbut it was very, very difficult because I had, I sewed everything, from little suits for the children, to\ndraperies, to slip covers, to custom and I worked very, very hard. But I was happy\nbecause I could be home with the family. Then I received information that, from the , that\nwe can go to America if we want to. And I decided that I'm going to talk with my husband, find out\nhow he feels. And we both decided. We're going to go to America.",
        "A: They didn't give me a choice to go to Israel. If they would give me a choice I would go.\nBecause they would take care of it, so I had to go again where I was, the reason why I was leaving\nSweden is because there was no synagogue. There was, the few Jews that were there, if any, were\nassimilated. And I felt I survived as a Jew, I suffered as a Jew, I lost my family because we were\nJewish. And orthodox or not orthodox, but I want to give my children a Jewish education. A\neducation, not just the secular but a Jewish education too. I wanted to be, for\ninstance, when my son had to be circumcised we had to bring a Rabbi from Stockholm. When we\nwant to have kosher meat we had to send it, by the time it comes after three days its no longer\nkosher if you know the laws of .",
        "A: No, we felt there is no, that there, we could have moved, it's not so easy to move. You have to\nhave a job, you have to move, and you have the circumstances. We had nothing, we started with\nnothing. So we decided, plus, I just felt that too many, you know, in Europe there were too many\npainful memories. If they would have given me a choice I surely would have gone to Israel and that\ntime, but I didn't have a choice. They assigned me to come Philadelphia, so on February 15, 1953\nwe arrived to the United States and settled in Philadelphia, and we've lived there ever since. During\nthe time when we came here, I knew that we wanted to have a larger family. And we had to make a\nchoice. And I knew that all life, from the morning you wake up until the time you go to sleep, you\nmake choices. And I was also taught that every, in every choice there are consequences and there\nare lessons. So I had to put my value system to work. And I said one thing, if I have children I\ndon't want them somebody else to take, I want to be with them. I want to, I didn't have that\nprivilege because it was not of my choice, my mother would have wanted me, because one of the\nthings which I remembered, very distinctly, is that my mother put aside her, she wanted to be an\nactress but she put away. And the family was always first. And other things which I heard when I\nwas home is that my mother was pregnant but she had a miscarriage and I was very much the child\nthat she wanted so much and I was loved unconditionally by my parents. And I felt I don't want to\ndeprive my children of that. So we decided, my husband and I, as long as we can pay our bills, we'll\nforego luxuries. I would never accept a handout from anyone. We worked hard work. And I will\nstay home with the children . And then in 1956, November 24, 1956, our son Samuel\nwas born. Again, I remember that when I was going to go to America people said, where you going\nto go with a baby? Or the seas, and how are you going to make out? I always had faith. I said,\nlisten, I'm nursing the baby. So at least until I nurse him he's not going to starve. And then\nsomehow its going to work. You cannot have everything mapped out every inch of the way. And\nwe went. It was difficult. I came here. I didn't know a single person in this country. I didn't know\na single word of English. Again we had to adjust, to start anew, to make adjustment, to make work.\n, | was already skilled, I was already a fashion designer but my husband had no\nmarketable skills. He was working in a knitting factory making nylon stockings. But he was\nwilling to work and take it, we went from one, it was very hard because he got a job here when we\ncame to Philadelphia, he worked in . By the time he came, the the children\nwere asleep. By the time he came home, they were already, they were still asleep, they were\nalready asleep. And I said, no, this won't do. Because I will never put material possessions above\nspiritual things, which we need. So I encouraged him to change the job. There was an\nadvertisement. After he worked a few days, they just had a few , they let him go. So he\nwas taking any kind of job, three, four jobs. But he would never, we never took anything from\nanyone. And we struggled and then on February 21, 1964 our youngest son, Michael, was born.\nAnd I knew that I made the right decision, to stay with the kids at home. Because, first of all, it\nwould cost a fortune, four children you have to camp, and I didn't want to send them to camp\nbecause I remembered the beautiful summers that I had in the country, picking mushrooms and my\nmother showing, making crowns and put on your head, and singing, and I don\u2019t want them to miss\nall this here. I felt that to give them love, because I started to realize that it's the love that I received\nthat I can give to others now. And that you can survive with very little because in Auschwitz I\ndidn't have anything. And after I was married. Anyhow, when my youngest son was suppose to\nbecome barmitzvah, we decided instead for making a big party, his name was Michael, may be rest\nin peace, that we're going to go to Israel instead. And to celebrate his barmitzvah there. And since\nI'm an intuitive person, and we decided this already, I wake up one morning and I said to my\nhusband, \"Honey, let's go now.\" And he said, \"When was this born? Why?\" And I said, \"I don't\nknow why. I just now feel we should go now.\" And he agreed. And it was a very good decision.\nAnd we went. And for the first time I met my cousin Uta (ph), okay? I was eight years old in 1934\nwhen she left. I came there in 1974, with my youngest son. Ours was always a very close knit\nfamily and Uta (ph) was thrilled. We cried in each others arms. Because she was the sole survivor\nof her family. She always felt bad that she left. She never could come back. And I remembered\nmy grandmother saying, . So I was able to go back with my son, to meet\nmy cousin Uta (ph). And there is Israel, there is a country now. And she gave him for his\nbarmitzvah a and a . And she asked him, just like my parents called me\naffectionate, I called my children affectionate, \"Michael, what would you like besides this.\" He\nsaid, \"Nothing, I'm just happy to see you.\" She says, \"No, tell me.\" He said, \"Okay.\" He wants a\nlittle chain, Michael. And I went to Israel, it didn't take long. I receive a call. My cousin Uta (ph)\nwent to the doctor, her check up, and either on the way there or on the way home, got a heart attack\nand died. If I wouldn't have gone then, I already told you what I, my intuition and that I listen to my\nintuition. And I would not have seen her. Anyhow, Michael was a beautiful young man. He was\nvery successful because he was loved and he had a talent to laugh, a full measure. I remember when\nhe was a little boy. He used to ask me, \"How come that we don\u2019t have family? How come you\nhave a number?\" And I told him, and the conversations, I wrote it down and then I made a poem\nfrom it. And I remember that when we moved into our first home, this is my second home in\nAmerica. He walked over to a neighbor's, his mother, an elderly lady. He said, \"Lady, I don't have\nany grandparents. Would you be my grandmother?\" I'm telling you those things, that it effected not\nonly us, it effected the children. And she became like his adopted grandmother. She was very good\nto him. She lived to be 96. Anyhow, Michael and I, and I remember one time, you know he was\nmore than fifteen years between him and my older son. So he almost grew up like an only child\nbecause they were already in college, . And one time I was sitting and I felt so lonely\nand I said, \"Michael, I need a little medicine.\" And I'll never forget his scared look. And he said,\n\"Ma, are you sick?\" And I said, \"Oh, not that kind of medicine. I need a hug and a kiss.\" And he\ncame over and gave me a hug and a kiss and after that he would come over many times, he would\nsay, \"Want a little medicine?\" And that became our between us, medicine meant a hug\nand a kiss. And when he was already in college, he would always, when I would write to him or\ncall him, I'd say, \"Michael, I can't wait to have a little medicine.\" And he said, \"I can\u2019t wait to give\nit to you.\" And he was very successful because he was loved by many people. He was successful\nin college. He graduated from the University of Rochester. At age 25 he was already in a\nwonderful position and he owned his own home and he was successful in every way. He was dating\na beautiful girl. And it was, my son Jerry was suppose to graduate in 1990, from University of\nCornell. And Michael was here Thursday and he said, \"Mom, Dad. Be ready. I'm going to come\nand pick you up. We're going to go to my brother's graduation.\" That was Thursday. Friday, the\npolice came and told me that I have no longer a son. My son, Michael, was killed. And instead of a\ngraduation party I had a funeral. He was killed instantly in an automobile. .. [end of side 1 of tape\n5] Michael was loved. Hundreds and hundreds of people came to his funeral. Hundreds of trees\nwere planted. He has a garden in Eastside from all the trees that was planted. My cousin,\n, my son is gone, my family is gone. And I always wear this, this is my most\nprecious piece of jewelry. Michael. And in my lifetime, I see the destruction of European jewelry.\nThe and defeat of Nazi Germany. And the rebirth of the State of Israel. I remember one\ntime, Michael and I were very, very close because he was the youngest. And he was the longest\nhome. And he was very, very affectionate and he gave me back what I gave him. And when I lost\nhim I was thinking, at least I was always for him. And his cards, in our home we have a tradition,\nwe write home-made cards. And in each card he said, Mom you were always there for me and you\nloved me unconditionally. And the kids, when I went now to where they are living, I mean to the\nWorld Holocaust Survivors, Michael is no longer with me. He is still with me because he died late.\nHe didn't go with me to the gathering. And now when I went to the March of the Living, and I saw\nthe trees and I was thinking. When I went the first time I went for Michael's barmitzvah. My\nhusband was still a healthy man, now he's not. How many changes in our lives and how quickly,\nfrom good fortune to bad fortune, life can change. And how many times, if we don't have a, if we\ndon't say good-bye to the ones we loved. And because of that, I never leave anyone without giving\na hug and a kiss, and giving the love and affection. And I feel I did make the right decision, that I\ngave up everything and was a full-time mother, wife and friend to those who needed me. After\nMichael started college and I said to myself, when I can close the door and nobody will wait for me\nand depend on me, then I can start paying back the community. In the 1970's I got involved in\nspeaking on the Holocaust. But before that, I was a volunteer in Hospital in the Mental\nHealth Department. I was going as a volunteer to the Great-a-felt (ph) Prison. I was going on\n. Iremembered my grandmother's teaching. Help those who are less fortunate than\nwe are.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: No it's okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: When I came here, as I said before without wanting to repeat myself, I didn't know one single\nperson in Philadelphia. But when I was still in Sweden, when I came to Sweden, it was the same\nthing. And I'm going to go back something, to Sweden, because the same thing happened here. It\nhappens to be related. When I was in Sweden, and one time it dawned on me, that if something\nwould happen to me, you know? So alone and everything. Nobody would miss me. If I would die,\nnobody would, it wouldn't be a loss if people don't know me. And I decided that the most important\nthing is family and friends. And I made an effort to reach out. I was no longer of being hurt, that I\nlose somebody, because in life everyone that we love either they will die before us or we will die\nbefore them. But not to love is the greatest loss. Not to trust is the greatest loss. When I came here,\nI didn't know anyone. When I made my son's barmitzvah, the first one, I had over 100 people. And\nwhen I make my barmitzvah, I have over 300 people. When I was going to make\nMichael's barmitzvah, and I start to make the list, we needed 500 people. I don't say everybody was\na personal, close friend, but they were people who I was involved. And I said, no, I cannot get\ninvolved. I made for my friends already now, I in Israel. I find one thing. That the\nsurvivors of the Holocaust here in Philadelphia, we have our, first we were called the Jewish New\nAmericans. Then we changed the name to Holocaust Survivors. We have a common past and a\ncommon responsibility. To remember our personal stories. Because for us the Holocaust is both a\npersonal and a collective Jewish tragedy. It's a human tragedy.",
        "A: First of all, I couldn't make friends with other people until I learned the language. And we\nformed already 1956, we already had here the organization. So we shared a lot together. And we\nrealized that this cannot be just a social organization. We have to work for Israel. We have to\nremember the Holocaust and to share with others and to teach. But for me, I had and I still have, all\nkinds of people. If I would show you my telephone book, you will say how can you keep up?\nBecause I made, I didn't discriminate. I feel one thing, the only criteria that I, that is important to\nme, is not how much somebody has, who he knows, what he knows, but how much he cares. And\nwhen a person is caring, and he is a good, decent human being, than I can be their friend and they\ncan be mine.",
        "A: It was difficult then, it's difficult still. However, I don't do only the things which are easy. I do\nmany things which are difficult but they are necessary. And when I was asked, there was here a\nprofessor , the late , | mentioned to you before. And she is from\n. And she wrote a book of the Holocaust and she, once a friend of ours from the\norganization invited about 20 survivors. I didn't know what the purpose was, it wasn't like a social\nthing. And I found out that she wanted to organize, that people should speak on the Holocaust.\nAnd I went there and that was the first time that different survivors among ourselves started to share\na little feelings. And I realized that there is not, we realized that there 1s very little in the text books\nabout it.",
        "A: I never went around and volunteered.",
        "A: Okay, but I mean, what happened was that when people saw the number they start to ask me\nquestions. And I answered. I always, I did the same thing like I did with my children when they\nasked about sex. Short question, short answer. They asked me so I answered. And people, not too\nmany people were so interested, they didn't know what it is. And then, a little later, when people\nstarted to know about it, especially the Holocaust survivors, realized that in the text book there 1s\nvery little about the Holocaust. They speak about World War One but not about the Holocaust. So\nwe started to form an organization and be involved with this here. So it was difficult. Because, to\ngive you one example, with some people it was easier. Some are more compassionate, some are\nmore understanding and more curious. Others are more involved with their own life. So it depends\nwho it was. I had my late friend told me that someone asked her once about the Holocaust and she\nstarted to tell a little bit. She said, \"Well, we had that in America hard too. We didn't have any\nsteak.\" And after that she decided never to talk about the Holocaust to her. The Holocaust has\ntaught me many lessons. Because before the Holocaust I only had positive experiences. I had no\nframe of reference with which to compare all the blessings that I have. The blessing of a loving\nfamily. The blessing of good health. The blessing of having my home. Not to be called all\ndifferent names. Because I've been called all kinds of names. I've been called no name at all. I've\nbeen called, derogatory now, Jewess, which was anti-Semitic name. I was called you\nrefugee. You foreigner. All kinds of name. And I feel one thing, that its very important. Respect\nfor one another. Respect for differences. That we cannot expect everybody to be alike. And that\nwe must, I don't want to use the word must because that sounds dictatorial. It's important to protect\nour human rights. And just, in the very beginning, with even the smallest incident that's happened.\nWhen somebody does not treat you right. I have learned to become a . I want to\ngive you an example because that's going to be more. I was invited several years ago to an open\nhouse, a barbecue. And the barbecue started because there was some people who were suppose to\ncome from other cities too, it was like a big gathering. They started to come on Friday until Sunday\nevening. We came Sunday. We live, it wasn't in Philadelphia. And when we arrived, not the\nowner but one of the guests greeting me with anger. \"What's the matter? Why so late?\" At that\ntime I realized, I had a chance to sort out my emotions, and I realized that if I answer in anger he is\ncontrolling me emotionally. So I looked at him very calmly and I said, \"Thank you. I am so glad\nthat you missed me.\" And he answered, \"You know I like you Yit-cola (ph).\" And I said, \"Thank\nyou\" again. This man, may he rest in peace, is no longer alive. He was otherwise a good man, but\nhe had a habit of putting some people down. And I have noticed that volubility illicits aggression in\nthe group, compassion in the kind, and silence in the indifferent. And this is nothing to do with\nrace, color or religion. It has to do with the ability of self image, of confidence, of the ability to love\nyourself because you cannot love others if you don't love yourself. And to care. To know that what\nwe do effects not only us, it effects others too. Because after the Holocaust, I was thinking many\ntimes, you know I told you I like to write, and I was thinking up to age 13 most decisions my\nparents and grandmother made for me. You know children don't make where to live and what to\ndo, of course I had some. During the Holocaust I couldn't make choices about my life. Even after\nthe Holocaust. Okay, I could have said no, I don't want to come here. But I didn't have many\nchoices. I could say, I come, I don't come, but I couldn't say I want to go someplace else because\nthe . So I felt that so much in my life I had to live and to do by choices\nwhich others made that effected me. And I sat down once and I wrote just a few words. And it\ngoes like this:\nFour groups of people\nDramatically influence my destiny.\nMy late, beloved family in Check-hon-off (ph), Poland\nWho knew me and loved me and empowered me with positive energy.\nHitler's Nazis who didn't know me\nBut hated me merely for being born Jewish and in one, single day\nMurdered in Auschwitz my entire family.\nThe bystanders, who knew but didn't care.\nAnd the Swedish Red Cross, who didn't know me but liberated me\nFrom Nazi tyranny and brought me to a hospital in , sweden.\nI am one and the same person.\nIf four different groups of people viewed me differently,\nAnd treated me differently,\nI was loved for who I am\nAnd I was hated and starved and tortured for who I am.\nThe more the Nazis tortured me for who I am\nThe more I was determined never to become like them,\nBut to view myself through their eyes.\nTo the Nazis, I was just a number, sub-human, a vermin.\nBut I am not a number.\nMy number is my badge of honor.\nLet those responsible for the number feel ashamed, or whatever they want.\nI am a proud Jewish daughter.\nTo be born Jewish 1s neither a crime nor a disgrace,\nBut to starve, torture and murder innocent people\nFor being born Jewish is a crime against God and humanity.\nA crime that has influenced the entire world.\nBecause whatever we choose to say and do\nWe are becoming partners too.\nBut others are becoming the beneficiaries of our good deeds\nOr the victims of our evil deeds.\nWe each can make a difference.\nOne person can save many people\nAnd one person can destroy many people.\nMengelia is responsible for the dead, over 400,000 people.\nOn the other hand, Wahlenberg and even Shindler is responsible for so many lives.\nFrom the 1,100 Jews that Shindler saved, 6,000 descendents are now alive.\nCan you imagine how many would be if the others had survived?\nTherefore, I feel that my first responsibility\nIs to God\nTo live by the commandments\nAnd not to transgress them\nBecause I cannot do evil without becoming evil.\nThe lessons that my father taught me, whatever I do I become, if I lie I'm going to become a liar and\nI'll help him and others.\nAnd I know one thing, we live in this world\nWe are responsible for one another.\nBut not in a way to punish each other.\nSo whenever there 1s injustice and cruelty\nWe need to be, to speak out, no matter where it is.\nAnd to stand in solidarity with those who are repressed\nAnd not with the oppressor.\nIn the final analysis, without , all , religion and education fails.\nSo we need first to improve ourselves because then we make a better world.\nIf you wish I can share with you a few of the poems if there is still time.",
        "A: Our world.",
        "A: Yes. I feel, do you remember there was a who came and he wanted to, here in\nPhiladelphia, to speak in the movies about the Nazis? We went and marched. When there was, we\nwent to speak. Then there was suppose to be a rally here, Nazis wanted to march here. We went to\ncourt, I was among them, and we fought against it. When I hear in private life, it doesn't only have\nto be in big things, in private life, when I was, when I hear that somebody is making a joke or on\nsomebody else's expense, or an ethnic group, generalizations, I stand up and I speak up. I said, \"I\ndon't appreciate what you said.\" In fact, one of my dear friends who is non-Jewish, who I met\nthrough such occasion. Because we were in the , It was a meeting and somebody\nsaid something negative about another group. And I said, \"I really don't appreciate because I know\nhow it feels when people do that.\" So in small thing. You know, prejudice is very easy because\nyou don't have to give accounts for it. You just say it but you don't have to give, you know? And\nthe point is one thing, it's like fire. When there is only one spark, you can erase it. But if there is a\nbig fire, you have no control any longer. So in the little thing and the inter-relationship, in our daily\nlife, in the personal, how we do people. Because usually when a person from one group offends\nanother, sometimes he starts hating or being angry towards the whole group. So its important to\nrespect each other. It's important to speak up when there is a cause, when the Russian people\nworked, you know, when there was Iron Curtain, and we were fighting to release them, I was\nmarching. So when there is something, a special cause, if I know, if I see something injustice I\nwrite a letter, I speak up. That's my contribution. Those are the things which I do. I cannot say, it\ndoesn't bother because it effects. You know, I just wanted to add, the Holocaust effected not just\nme, because the point is one thing, six million Jewish people and about 5 million non-Jewish people\nhave lost. They will never become what they had the potential of becoming. The world will never\nknow how many wonderful people we have lost. Nor how many Nazi war criminals we have\ngained. Because some of them still live in hiding . So what did the world gain?\nLose good people and gained criminals? Whenever there is a crime we lose a good person, we gain\na criminal. What trade-off is that? So it's important. Even to, in my own home, to my own\nhusband, I once told my husband, in sickness and in poverty and in riches and poor and everything,\nI will always stand by you . But you commit a crime and I don't want to be any part\nof it. Then you have to trade yourself in. So there are certain loyalties. In life we need to make\nchoices. We need to say to bring up decent children we have to learn to say no. Because you know,\nin the commandments there is the ten commandments. It says you shall, you shall not. And another\nthing how you can put out, you cannot hatred with hatred, anger with anger. Somebody once said in\nanger to me, I hate you. Because I wouldn't give in to something that was not moral or ethical. I\nsaid, it's okay I love you for both of us. And the person apologized, she said, I really don't hate you\nit's just that I was angry with you, I couldn't, you are stubborn. I said, what you call stubborn, that\nstubborn is what saved me from. Because, in fact, I always felt what my family taught me. That no\npower in the world can break my spirit as long as I don't collaborate with people in my own\ndestruction. Because what we do, this is what we become. You kill you become a killer. You\ncheat you become a cheat. You save somebody so you, so the final analysis, it's not how much we\nknow or how much we have, how much we care. Caring is what life is all about. And we have a\nwonderful group in Philadelphia now, that was in the museum last week. They are called\nChampions of Caring. High School students. And this is sponsored by the Holocaust Museum in\nthe Washington. And by the Jewish Relations Counsel in Philadelphia. And the , also in\nPhiladelphia. And those kids, what do they do? They go and help those who are less fortunate.\nThe sick, the elderly, the disabled. This is what we need to do. You know, the strongest message I\ncan give, what I've learned, if we are not our brother's keeper, by omission we become our brother's\nkillers. Because there are sins by omission and sins by commission.",
        "A: Yes. I picked those two poems because, actually there are three poems that I would like to share\nwith you if there is enough time.",
        "A: Okay. The first one is called 'A World That Vanished.",
        "A: This was written May 8, 1978. A long time ago because the Holocaust, I've been living and\nbreathing it, it's effected so deeply my life.\nJust like a leaf tossed to the wind\nSeparated from its branches and tree\nNot belonging anymore\nLiberated but not free\nCarrying the pain of separation\nMemories so painful and dear\nMemories of our world, it use to be\nA world that is no longer here\nI still see the Sabbath candles\nAnd my mother's gentle face\nMy father is chanting the prayers\nMy grandmother with her white shawl of lace\nI see my little sister and brother\nSo young and so full of cheer\nNot yet understanding tragedies and hatred\nBut sensing uncertainty and fear\nThe Nazi boots are marching\nMy world with terror is filled\nThe Holy Scriptures are burning\nChildren are starved, tortured and killed\nThe ghettos are closing us in\nWhat is there for us in store?\nMy world is going slower and slower\nNothing is like it was before.\nThe freight trains are taking us on a journey\nFor most it is the last ride\nMy brothers and sisters are burning\nThere is no more place to hide\nHitler's final solution is sealed\nWe are trapped in a world of Hell\nI am amazed that I have survived\nThe horrors from the Holocaust to tell\nAnd there is another poem, which is called \"I Am Not A Number\", and I wrote it May 13, 1994.\nI was trapped in the killing center of Auschwitz\nSurrounded by barbed wires, gas chambers, smoke and flame\nThe Nazis tattooed a number on my arm\n2-5-6-7-3 became my new name\nThey tried to reduce me to a number\nDehumanize me day by day\nBut regardless of all their efforts\nThe could not take my self worth away\nThey murdered in the gas chambers my entire family\nIn one single day\nAll my earthly possessions were so brutally taken away\nThey treated me worse than a hardened criminal\nEven though I did not commit any crime\nThey hated me merely for being born Jewish\nAnd starved and tortured me all the time.\nI was only 13 years old when they took away from me my right to life\nBut they could not take away my will to live and to survive\nFor nearly six nightmarish years\nI have endured a living Hell\nNevertheless, I have outlived Hitler and the Third Reich\nAnd lived my story to tell\nThe third one is my conversations with my late son, Michael. When he asked me the first time\nabout the number. And this was written May 14, 1979.\nWho wrote on your arm, Mom?\nAsked curiously my little boy one day\nI looked sadly at my innocent child and thought\nVery carefully what to say\nThe Nazis tattooed this number on my arm\nI told my son short and plain\nWhy did they do it, Mom? He asked further\nMy God, I thought, how can I explain?\nYou see my child, there was a man\nAdolph Hitler was his name\nHe was very cruel and hateful\nAnd inflicted on people suffering and pain\nOh, said he, and ran out to play\nAnd I signed with great relief\nI wanted to protect him for as long as I could\nFrom knowing my deep sore and grief\nHe grew and I could not protect him forever\nSo I answered his questions one at a time\nHe wanted to know why we Jews are hated\nDid we commit some kind of a crime?\nNo, my child, I told my son,\nWe have not committed any crime\nYet we Jews have been victimized and slaughtered\nBy ; and Hitlers all the time\nDo you hate the Nazis for what they did to us?\nNow I have no grandparents and relatives like my friends\nThe Nazi murdered all our loved ones\nThey have blood on their hands\nI know, my child, that you too are hurting\nBut hatred and revenge can never restore\nThe lives of those who perished in the Holocaust\nAnd the precious things we had once before\nYou and I who know what pain is\nMust never inflict hurt and pain\nWe must try to build a better world\nSo the death of the victims shall not be in vain\nThis is my message.",
        "A: Yes. But I spoke to them, I told them, but I spoke to them more about my experiences before the\nHolocaust. I wanted them to know their grandparents. Because I felt its important. And as a result,\nmy oldest son , a couple of years, two or three years ago and maybe a little longer,\ncame here to visit. He lives in New York. And afterwards he calls me up and he said, \"Ma, I had a\nvery traumatic experience.\" I said, \"What's happened?\" He said, \"I was waiting for the train and I\nsaw a man laying face down across the tracks. And I saw from nearby that the train is coming. I\ndidn't know whether he was drunk, dead, sick, pushed, or wanted to commit suicide. I had no idea.\nAnd I was thinking, what should I do? My mind was racing. On the one hand, I risk my life\nbecause I didn't know if I'm going to be able, get time to get back. And on the other hand, I thought,\nwhat would my grandmother do? My grandmother .\". Because I told him the\nstory how my mother sacrificed herself and me. And he said, \"I jumped up and I saved him. People\nhad to pull me up.\" My first reaction was, how could you do something like this? And then I said,\n\" , when you graduated from Yale University I felt you achieved something special.\nBut this is something more special. You proved that you are a and that is the highest\nreligion, education and achievement. I am very grateful.\" Another thing, because everything\neffects, another thing is that when he was little and he was the oldest and he was not born in this\ncountry, had also to learn the language and go through the difficulty as a child. I once told him,\nbecause he asked me also about my experience. I said, \" , both your parents are\nsurvivors of the Holocaust. We lost everything that was ours. All that we have is our good name.\nAnd if you will, I will always love you unconditionally, no matter what you will do because you are\nmy child. But just like I ought to feed you, I ought to feed you spiritually. But there is one thing.\nYou do something morally and ethically wrong, you will not be allowed to have my name.\" And I\ncompletely dismissed it from my mind. When he was an adult already and I came to visit. And all\nof a sudden, he starts telling me, \"You know, Mom? Whenever I was going to do something I\nasked myself, is this going to disgrace my parents?\" And thank God, my son grew up to be a very\nrespectable, loving son, husband, father. He has now a little girl, my grandchild, our grandchild.\nShe is named after my late son, second name. Her name is Elizabeth Michaela. We call her Eliza-\nla (ph). And she was here shortly before I went on the March of the Living, April 14, 1996. And\nfor the first time, she noticed my number. And she looks at me, she says, she was here Mother's\nDay. During the time she learned a little more, she grew. And she's playing, busy playing, and she\ntakes a look on my arm and she says, \"Barbie, A-B-C's.\" Because she has a book with A-B-C's and\nshe sensed that this is related. She's only two years old. So it's even effecting her. For me, for my\nchildren, even for my grandchildren, it's too late. They will never know the joy of having\ngrandparents and Aunts and Uncle, they didn't know. But hopefully its not going to be too late for\nothers. And I want to finish with a very inspiring story. Remember that I repeated many times that\nmy grandmother's proverb, you only have what you give away. In 1984, I received a letter from a\nperson that I didn't even know. Ida Jervis (ph), , Washington. And I opened the\nletter and I start reading it and it says, I'm your cousin. I'm named after the same great-\ngrandmother, . I was four years old when my family left Poland and\nI'm sure that you will appreciate this. And I'm looking, she send me a photograph of my\ngrandmother and her son. And I thanked her. She invited me to come and visit. Really not\nknowing what to expect, a survivor, how I'm going to act? Am I going to be reacting normal, am I\nbeing all broken up, or whatever. And I came and there was another relative who knew my mother\nbecause they were cousins and she left shortly before the war. And she's telling me that every year\nfor many years now, they have a family reunion, because this cousin was\nand she came with her sister and they started this because people lived in different\nplaces. And they invited me to come with my family. We went. From not having any relatives\nhere, all of sudden I had more than 130, 140 relatives. And until this day, whenever we can we go\nfor Thanksgiving reunion. We are close. And my cousins speak with price, my cousin, every\noccasion, my cousins. They have family. So, because my grandmother send this picture away from\nEurope, this picture is now returned to me and I realized now I can tell you what you can give away,\nyou still have it. After I lost everything in the Holocaust. My home, my family, my community,\nmy earthly possessions, six years of my life and went through a living Hell. I found out, when I had\nlost everything material, that I have spiritual things to give. The Nazis hated me but they couldn't\nstop me from loving people, from believing in God, and from caring and wanting to help. And we\ncertainly have what we give away. We can give up, for over 20 years I've been giving away stories,\nabout the Holocaust, about my family. Many people tell me, I know you because your grandmother\nand parents, like they would be mine. And I still can give away. We can give knowledge, a poem,\nlove, compassion. What you are doing, to give away typed, to record this here, it's the spiritual\nthings that nobody can take away. And the result, passing them onto the next generations. The\nresult is passing them onto any person, older, young, stranger or family. When we do that, then\nlong after we are gone they remain. Because Anne Frank wrote a diary. She is gone and her diary\nis going to live on. And we can always give away kind words and good deeds. No matter how poor\nor rich we are. How educated or not. And this is what is important. This is the lesson of the\nHolocaust. Now you understand why I felt it's important to talk about my family. They gave me\nunconditional love. Showed me, my mother's experience and I, many times when I think, if she\ncould love me so, so much a stranger, how much more did she love me? And that gives me, makes\nme feel like I'm worthwhile. And this is very important.",
