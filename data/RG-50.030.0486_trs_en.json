So your -- your family was not only wealthy and -- and prominent in\nterms of being wealthy, but they were very well connected in terms of people who knew what\nwas going on in the world. So, in a sense t -- your father was warned, maybe it would be just\nbetter to leave.",
        "A: Well now, I tell you that our friends were all Christians.",

        "A: Well, no, I didn\u2019t even think of it when I was -- I didn\u2019t think about it. And my parents\nprobably did. But when we sold it, we sold it for nothing.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Cause nobody wanted it. Who wants a big house like that?",
        "Q: Right.",

        "A: Yes. But we put him first with a friend of ours, a Christian friend of ours, because we thought\nto be with us in a house, day and night, he couldn\u2019t do it. So we left him alone with a family, but\nhe couldn\u2019t stand it there.",
        "Q: He couldn\u2019t stand it?",
        "A: No, because he wanted to be with us. And he wrote a letter to my mother, and I have to read it\nagain, because I forgot it. And it was a -- I read little bit, 1t was so sweet to my mother, you\nknow? And she didn\u2019t want to -- her to know that she wa -- he wasn\u2019t happy.",

        "Q: Nothing. And you know the war is going on in Europe?",
        "A: Yeah, I know.",
        "Q: But you\u2019 re not afraid.",
        "A: But no, because they were -- they were caught by the Greeks at the time that I saw them.",
        "Q: Right, the Italians were stopped, or at least there\u2019s a stalemate, they can\u2019t get through. But\nthen the Germans come in, and they do win, and they divide the country into three parts.",
        "A: But the archbishop didn\u2019t want to give us away, but at the end, couldn\u2019t make it.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: And especially there, in Thessaloniki, in Salonika, where there were so many, you know?",
        "Q: Right. No, the Salonika Jews just get -- it\u2019s dec -- decimated.",
        "A: 90 percent of them perished.",
        "Q: Yes, yes. Do you remember when th -- when, after the German invasion, and that Athens is\noccupied by both the Italians and the Germans? Do you remember seeing both troops?",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. As a matter of fact at the beginning, we didn\u2019t think that this -- the\narchbishop didn\u2019t want to give their na -- our names or any -- anything. I used to go -- I still used\nto go to the theater. We have an ancient theater in Athens.",
        "Q: Ancient theater, yeah.",
        "A: Ancient theater, we -- has a -- has a better acoustics than the latest theater here in the United\nStates. Amazing, it\u2019s unbelievable. So I was in that theater, and besides me, there were Germans,\nand when I turn, who do I see? My piano teacher, that she used to tell me that she was Jewish,\nand she was German, she was with the Germans.",
        "Q: She was with them. So that must have been a big shock, yeah.",
        "A: And to have the Germans behind us, but we weren\u2019t afraid at that time, you know? It\u2019s when\nthey started taking the Jews and putting them in -- in Haidari, the prison in Greece, then --",
        "Q: Then you got worried.",
        "A: We thought that this was momentarily, and finally you know that, and understand that they\nwere all --",
        "Q: That they would stop.",
        "A: Yeah, but we were wrong with that.",
        "Q: Right. We have to stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Wer -- where was this ancient theater? This wasn\u2019t the colis -- this is not --",
        "A: In -- in Athens.",

        "A: But they are in other parts of the -- but this one was -- is inside Athens.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And if you heard Yanni.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Have you heard Yanni?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He played in that theater in Athens.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, so -- I see. These outdoor theaters are just -- it\u2019s outdoors, right? It\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nwonderful.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You never get hot or sweating, or --",
        "Q: No matter when, in the year, really? It sounds wonderful. Were there restrictions once the\nGermans took over Athens? Did you have to wear a Jewish star --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No Jewish star?",
        "A: No. They took us all of the sudden, you know, it seemed, that they decided to take us in -- in\nAthens. I don\u2019t know what they did in Salonika.",
        "Q: No, but you\u2019re not -- you\u2019re go -- you move too fast.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: That was in 1944. I\u2019m talking about 1941.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When they take over, are there -- there must be restrictions for Jews?",
        "A: No, n-not yet.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: They asked to show up in the synagogue. I don\u2019t know too much because, see, I wasn\u2019t with\nthe -- the rest of the Jews to see --",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: -- what was going on. See, I was 1-inside with this family. And --",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m talking about before you\u2019re in hiding. You go into hiding f -- \u201942 - \u00b043, but you\u2019re not\n-- you\u2019re in your house with your parents and Haim in 1941, yes?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: In 1941, yes.",
        "Q: Yes. So for one year --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- you\u2019re not in hiding.",
        "A: Mm-hm, right.",
        "Q: Right? So what happens? You stay pretty much in the house?",
        "A: No, we go out.",
        "Q: You go out?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And -- and so you don\u2019t feel -- are you going to school?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, you couldn\u2019t bi -- ga -- you couldn\u2019t go to school.",
        "A: Probably -- no, probably that -- that\u2019s when I used to go to school.",
        "Q: Now, was everybody stopped from going to school, or only the Jewish students, do you\nremember?",
        "A: I tell you the -- I don\u2019t remember --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember, okay.",
        "A: -- Imi -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know what the other children did.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Because I was with Christians, Greeks. Orthodox Greeks.",
        "Q: Yes. So you don\u2019t know, huh?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know much.",
        "Q: So who ma -- the su -- was there a discussion in your house about hiding?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: There was?",
        "A: And then is when we came in contact with all our friends. They said you can come out in\nhouse whenever you want, in the evening, any time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the last house that we went to before we were caught, they had the big house, they send\nthe maids away because they were afraid that the maids may say something. And they enclosed\nthemselves in one room, and they gave us the rest of the house -- to us, and my father said, \u201cWhy\nare you doing this?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I want to show that there are nice people out\nthere -- there -- there were, because we can go out, we are free to go out any time we want to.\nBut you stay home, and you need more room and everything.\u201d So they did that, and the love that\nthey show us, and they used to bring us food and this and that -- amazing.",
        "Q: Really? So you didn\u2019t just stay with one family during this -- is it --",
        "A: No, n-no, about two or three families.",
        "Q: Two or three families. And who ma -- did your father make the decision that you sh -- you\nshould hide, or was it obvious, there were a lot of families who were doing this?",
        "A: No, because when we thought that someone has seen one of us, because my brother used to\nwalk around, but he thought someone saw him, or someone may see him, or someone saw me 1n\nthe -- in the window --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: You know. We had to move.",
        "Q: Did you look -- I don\u2019t know what it means in Greece. In Poland it seems that some Jews\nlooked Jewish to Polish Catholics. Was there a look, so that if someone saw Haim they would\nthink he was a Jewish --",
        "A: N-No, no, but there were some that look -- so. But ma -- the majority looked like a -- like a --",
        "Q: Like everybody else.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But when you say Haim might be seen, it was because he was known to be Jewish --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- not because he looked Jewish, I see. So were you afraid of these Germans now? Did -- at\nsome point did you become afraid of these guys?",
        "A: If -- we\u2019re afraid now, or then?",
        "Q: No, no, no, then.",
        "A: Then.",
        "Q: When -- when you went into hiding.",
        "A: Well, until we went to Haidari, I wasn\u2019t afraid.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay.",
        "A: It -- Haidari they put us in a room with two other people, and -- and then after that they put us\nall together in one big room, where we stayed there, and after a week they send us to -- put us in\ntrains.",
        "Q: In trains, to Auschwitz.",
        "A: To Auschwitz.",
        "Q: So the hiding period is not such a terrible period because you\u2019re with people who know you.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Who care about you.",
        "A: In Greece, yes.",
        "Q: In Greece, and want to be good to you. But your life is all indoors, because the Germans are\nclearly looking for Jews, yes?",
        "A: Or someone will tell them --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- there, because the Germans didn\u2019t know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- who were Jews, and who were not, you know. Or, we didn\u2019t have ghettos like --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- other places. We lived everywhere.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So they couldn\u2019t know unless somebody told them that these are Jews.",
        "Q: Right. Now, your father is not working when you\u2019re in hiding, or is he going in and out?",
        "A: No, he stays in.",
        "Q: He stays -- he stays inside. Do you think your father is -- is -- is helping with the cost of\nkeeping you there by paying people, or are these wealthy people and they don\u2019t want money?",
        "A: Well, they don\u2019t want money, but my father was -- didn\u2019t want them to spend all their money,\nyou know?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: We used to give them money.",
        "Q: Now, what happened to the house that you had bought? You just left that house, with now\nless clothes, I assume, and go into hiding. So each time you move, you have less and less things.\nIs there something that you take with you because you -- some, I don\u2019t know --",
        "A: No, I tell you, when we were caught, we decided that -- we used to listen the radio, th-the\nBritish --",
        "Q: BBC.",
        "A: -- telling us all the time that we\u2019re coming, this and that, and years went by and nothing\nhappened. And my father was still very young, and my brother, they were getting tired. We leave\nthe country. [inaudible]. So we decided to go to Egypt, and from Egypt to Israel, and -- and we\ndecided that we\u2019re -- we\u2019re going to get dressed as if we\u2019re going to a wedding, in case they si --\nthey stop us, we\u2019ll tell them that we are going to a wedding. And that\u2019s what happened. And a\nfriend of ours -- you see, we had so many friend -- one of them gave us up. He [indecipherable]\nin Germany, and we thought that he was working for the Greek government, trying to find out\nthings from the Germans. And maybe he did, but he was on both sides.",
        "Q: Both sides.",
        "A: And maybe the Germans found out that he was hiding Jews, who knows if he gave us up. And\nall of a sudden Germans stop us going to the -- to the ship, and since I knew German, I got out of\nthe car, and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you taking us. I mean now, as you see, we are\ndressed, we are going to a wedding.\u201d He said, \u201cFraulein, we know everything about you. You\ndon\u2019t have to tell us any more.\u201d\u201d Mm-hm. \u201cSo you\u2019ll come with us.\u201d And they took us to a place\nto -- where the Germans were. And they started to interrogate first my father and my brother. So\nthey came back, when they came back I was so scared to look at them, because my father didn\u2019t\nhave the front teeth, and you know, it seems that they hit them. So then they came to pick us up,\nmy mother and myself. And I spoke to them in German because I knew German, and -- and\nprobably that\u2019s the reason they didn\u2019t behave bad with us, they didn\u2019t do anything to us. So we\nwent back to the room where my brother and [indecipherable] and my brother comes to me and\nsays, \u201cYou are no longer my sister.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWhy they didn\u2019t do anything to you? Look\nat us,\u201d you know. \u201cProbably you told them where our relatives are.\u201d I say, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that for\nanything in the world. They ask me, and do you know what I told them? In -- in German, I told\nthem, and they didn\u2019t hit me.\u201d So, I told the Germans, I know where my -- I don\u2019t know where\nmy relatives are, but even if I knew it, I wouldn\u2019t tell you. So they started laughing.",
        "Q: The Germans started laughing?",
        "A: So then after that they let me -- let us go, you know? And my brother was very mad at me\nthinking that if they let us go like that, without hitting us, I told them where my relatives are and\nso forth. I didn\u2019t do it, and that\u2019s why all my relatives who were hidden, they were alive after we\nreturned.",
        "Q: Right, right. Did he believe you?",
        "A: Who?",
        "Q: Your brother, when you told him.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: He did. That was a very difficult situation I would imagine --",
        "A: It was, it -- it was --",
        "Q: -- very painful.",
        "A: -- it was.",
        "Q: And hi -- was he hit? Did he look as beaten -- yes.",
        "A: He -- oh, sure, sure.",
        "Q: Yes. Do you think also that they were hit because they were men and you were women? Do\nyou think there was some difference?",
        "A: N-No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: N-No. They didn\u2019t hit us because I spoke to them in German, and I guess they liked that.",
        "Q: But didn\u2019t your father speak German?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Oh, he didn\u2019t.",

        "A: And that was here in Washington I believe, and she won it. Yeah, yeah, and I have some\npapers with me.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s her --",
        "A: She died. We were such good friends, even though w-we lived so far away from each other.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: We used to call each other every si -- almost every day.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And all of a sudden I heard she died.",
        "Q: And how was she able to come to you in the other barrack? Were you working in a similar\nplace in Auschwitz so she could see you regularly?",
        "A: Well see, she wasn\u2019t like all of us, she was like --",
        "Q: Oh, she was a blochal -- sh -- a Blochalteste, she was the head of the barrack [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, I\u2019d say so. But she was Jewish.",
        "Q: Right. But she had more freedom to move around.",
        "A: Right, right, right.",
        "Q: So that was wonderful for her to do that, yeah.",
        "A: She could be in trouble also.",
        "Q: Of course. Did you then go back to your barrack, or you stayed in her barrack, do you think?",
        "A: I stayed for a little bit, until they left -- the Nazis from our bar -- they took whichever they\nfound, and they left, and then she took me back.",
        "Q: I see. So she was a real protector, huh?",
        "A: Yeah. And she was always like that, till she died.",
        "Q: Was she older than you?",
        "A: No, I think we were the same age.",
        "Q: About the same age?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When did she die? Few years ago, about --",
        "A: I think it\u2019s a -- a year ago.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: \u2019'm not sure.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: My mind is getting so bad. Rinette probably will remember.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you remember leaving Auschwitz for Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: N -- well, what I remember is that they had us for a couple of days outdoors, it was raining\nand everything, and we didn\u2019t have any clothes, or right shoes, or anything, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And -- and until today I\u2019m flabbergasted how I didn\u2019t get sick. The whole time that I was\nthere, I never had any headache, or I was sneezing or anything. You know, isn\u2019t that strange?",
        "Q: Yeah. So you -- you\u2019re saying 1n --",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know, maybe it -- this time when we were out [indecipherable] women, then they\nmoved us. And then they took us to where they make arms and things like that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. A munitions factory.",
        "A: Yeah, a factory.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: This is in Bergen-Belsen? You think -- you --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I think it was in Bergen-Belsen.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. And we were staying there for a little bit. In the meantime they heard that\nthe -- the allies were coming. And they gave it to each one of us, my friends and myself, they\ngave us something to cover ourself. It\u2019s because the allies were coming. And so -- and we\ncouldn\u2019t see, you know, because it was cold, and we had it lowered, and I couldn\u2019t see where my\nfriends were, and we used to call every five minutes, Leoni, Milka,",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And then finally -- we always stay together, and they took us to Theresienstadt. That was a\nghetto, and there were -- there were Jewish doctors and everything, and they were so sweet to us,\nso nice. And my hair had started to -- to be okay, you know, I had some hair after all this time.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So, and -- to one of the [indecipherable], because they were cutting our hairs because we had\ntyphus, all of us. So I said, \u201cWould you please don\u2019t cut my hair,\u201d I said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m going to\nmeet my father pretty soon, and I don\u2019t want him to see me like that.\u2019 And he said okay, and he\ntook care, he treated me and everything, and he [inaudible] you know, and then we -- we were\nthere, all Jews in this ghetto, and -- and they would come to me and say Rachelle -- the Russians",
        "Q: After the liberation, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- the -- the -- the Russians are outside, and they\u2019re cooking, and we didn\u2019t have any food.\nSaid, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go in the window, maybe they\u2019Il give you some food?\u201d I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t\nyou go? I mean, th-there\u2019s a -- why are you sending me, I do -- I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d they\nsaid, \u201cyou are the only one who has hair.\u201d",
        "Q: So did you go?",
        "A: Well, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. And did they give you food?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. What were the Russians like when they came, do you remember?",
        "A: Well, they seemed to be very sweet and everything. And then after that, they moved me to a\nhospital where the Russians were, because they didn\u2019t have all the necessary things there in the\nghetto.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So -- and they took me there, and while I was there I heard that they were taking all the Jews\nto Siberia. And I thought to myself, no way. So I had th -- they gave me a shirt to sleep, and I\nhad -- how do you call it --",
        "Q: The pillowcase?",
        "A: The pillowcase. From the pillowcase I made that -- a skirt, because I couldn\u2019t go out, and I\ncouldn\u2019t go through the door because they will attack me, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, from the window, I --",
        "Q: You jumped from the win --",
        "A: -- [jumped. And nothing -- I was very thin, you know, and nothing happened to me, and I\nstarted walking fast. And I found some French women that they -- I-I knew in the concentration\ncamp, and they said to me, \u201cOh Rachelle, comme vous \u00e9tes chic.\u201d",
        "Q: Whoa.",
        "A: Chic.",
        "Q: Chic [indecipherable]",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so that was funny. And I always say something funny to friends if they ask me\nsomething, you know, because -- and you will see some pictures, you saw some pictures where --\nwhere the ji -- the Americans --",
        "Q: Yes.",

        "A: You know, I\u2019m laughing, like.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because I had this thing in my mind that we have to do the best we can while we are alive,\nforget what happened. We are good friends, you know, [indecipherable] and -- but then when we\nwent to Greece, we didn\u2019t find the parents.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]. Where was pa -- Paula did not go with you to Bergen-Belsen? Cause you\nmentioned Leoni and --",
        "A: Right.",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Milka, rather.",
        "A: Right, no, Paula, no, she wasn\u2019t with us there.",
        "Q: She wasn\u2019t with you. But the three of you went --",
        "A: Went -- we stayed together.",
        "Q: -- to Bergen-Belsen, Theresienstadt, and then you all became interpreters --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- with the Americans?",
        "A: Yes. See, we -- we didn\u2019t want to stay there with the Russians because -- so 1 -- 1t was the\nFrench Red Cross that came to pick up their people. So we all knew French [indecipherable] so\nthey took us, and they took us to where the Americans were, in Frankfort.",
        "Q: Did they say that you were French? Did you say we\u2019re French, or you just said you spoke\nFrench, do you remember?",
        "A: We -- we spoke to them fr -- in French, yeah --",
        "Q: In French?",
        "A: -- and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Now, why did they take you to the Americans, do you think, rather than to the French side?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s where they were -- they weren\u2019t going straight to --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see.",
        "A: -- yeah, they stopped there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the Americans [indecipherable] they wanted us as interpreters, and they gave us clothes\nbecause we didn\u2019t have any clothes, we were dressed alike.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: With a soldier\u2019s clothes.",
        "Q: Right, because you were all dressed in pants and a shirt, just like the soldiers.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I look fat there, and you know, little earlier I was very thin --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- when I [indecipherable]. But the Americans gave us everything good they had, they used to\nsend them from th -- America --",

        "A: Yeah, I-I know. I know, and the |-laughing, I mean, like nothing happened.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s because we had th-that kind of thought, you know? We\u2019 forget what --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- hap -- happened in the past, now we\u2019 ll have to start a new life --",
        "Q: A new life.",
        "A: -- and try to do the best we can.",

        "A: I didn\u2019t know until later, until I came here.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Rinette tried to -- because you see, Rinette said, maybe he went -- they send him to Siberia. I\nsaid, if [indecipherable] they sent to Siberia, he was too intelligent not to know how to come\nback to Greece, you know? So I didn\u2019t believe that --",
        "Q: That he went, yes.",
        "A: So then we found out that he died immediately after the war --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And my father, too.",
        "Q: And the three of you, you and your two friends, go back to Athens because you\u2019re all hoping\nto find family, I assume? And you --",
        "A: And the thing is, where I used to ask rush -- the Russians, that we wanted to go back to\nGreece, and they said, well, we can give you some money. But we were -- how can we go from -\n- that far, you know, go to Greece with a little bit of money. Was impossible. Instead, when I\nspoke to the Russians, the Russian were telling us, we\u2019ll take you to America, and we\u2019ll give you\ngood life and everything. Ye -- well, I-I said I\u2019m sorry, I said --",
        "Q: You mean the Americans said this to you.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Not the Russians, yes, okay, right.",
        "A: No, the American. They were extremely nice. And I said, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t.\u201d I said, \u201cWe can\u2019t go\nnow because we have to go back and find out -- our parents, if our parents returned.\u201d\u201d And do you\nknow what? He gave us a plane.",
        "Q: He gave you a --",
        "A: A plane.",
        "Q: A plan?",
        "A: Plane.",
        "Q: A plane? To go from Munich to Athens? Really? For just the three of you?",
        "A: No, it w-were about six, but a -- ma -- the -- most of the plane was empty.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. See, w-who would do that? Nobody, nobody. They were so nice, it\u2019s -- Pll never forget\nthat.",
        "Q: No. But then of course, you go back.",
        "A: But you know, it was one of us when -- a Jewish man that he ask me to be his girlfriend, and I\nsaid, I\u2019m sorry. At this point, you know, my mind 1s not ki -- cannot think anything, you know,\nright now. I want to go to Greece and find my parents.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So what he did is he was writing the names that will be on the plane, he took my name off. A\nJewish man.",
        "Q: He took it off? Because he wanted you to be his girlfriend?",
        "A: Yeah, because I said that I couldn\u2019t be, because -- I had a good reason, I mean it\u2019s not that I\nwas going with anybody else, or anything.",
        "Q: Right, right, right.",
        "A: I said that I wasn\u2019t ready for something like that. And so a friend of mine, Leoni, took the list,\nand she says, \u201cWell, Rachelle is not here in this list.\u201d\u201d And that\u2019s how I know. I got back into the\nlist, and I went.",
        "Q: So he put you back on?",
        "A: Well, Leoni put it back on.",
        "Q: Or la -- Leoni -- but this was a very difficult trip for you, because what you found at the other\nend was that no one --",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t expect the same day to find them, you know? We thought with another plane,\nwith -- or maybe they -- they -- there were nice other people like this Americans, you know. So -\n- and maybe they\u2019Il come in a few days. And my uncle, which -- I mean, he -- like I said, he\u2019s a\ngood man, very good man, he helps others, he doesn\u2019t care about himself, but he wants to help\nwith the rest of the family. He went to -- to our friends, and he wanted the things they were\nholding for us, to take h-he -- and you know, ma -- our friends were embarrassed by that. They\n[indecipherable] and they said well, when Rachelle or the rest of the family comes, you know,\nwe'll give it to them.",
        "Q: Now, th-the -- the people who were holding your -- the stuff from your family, were these the\npeople who were hiding you also, or was this another family?",
        "A: Well, we -- we used to go from one house to the other.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So they kept it for you, and are those the people you went to first when you came?",
        "A: In Athens?",
        "Q: Yeah, do you remember?",
        "A: No, first we bought a house, because the Germans weren\u2019t there yet.",
        "Q: No, no, I meant after you came back.",
        "A: Oh after I ca --",
        "Q: After the war, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: After the war. Well, I saw them, but I could tell that they were very embarrassed by my uncle\n-- what my uncle did, and I was embarrassed too. And -- and with that man that gave us up, you\nknow, to the Germans --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: All this started coming up, you know, and I didn\u2019t want to think much about it. So -- and I\nwas involved with my relatives and others, so -- I didn\u2019t see -- and I forgot their names. My\ndaughter -- every time we see each other, she tries t -- for me to remember, I can\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I only remember one name, Kalantzi. He\u2019s the one who wrote the poem, but I didn\u2019t know\nhim, I knew his -- a-another man that was a friend of my father, and his name was Kalantzi.",
        "Q: Kalantzi, uh-huh.",
        "A: But this one I didn\u2019t know, as -- just we met, you know, and it\u2019s amazing the poem he wrote.\nThings that we Jews don\u2019t say, you know, he said for us. And that\u2019s the kind of friends we need.\nWe can say a lot of things, instead of making friends, we can make enemies, but when they say\nthe good things, then people listen.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So were the three of you living together when you went back to Athens, or did you\nsplit up?",
        "A: Well, we intended that because Leoni had an aunt in Athens that survived, and she had a big\nhouse, and she told us you stay with me, we\u2019ll stay together. But when my cousin came to see\nme, she said -- he said, no I don\u2019t think you can stay here because my mother will die. See, she\nwas my only aunt, there. But I wish I would stay with my friends.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So then you stayed with your aunt, uh-huh. That was -- was that difficult for you?",
        "A: It was difficult because I couldn\u2019t talk. I -- I used to say -- you know me, I don\u2019t say things\nthat are very bad, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I try to make things, I don\u2019t know, easier a little bit for the other person that listens. And I\ndidn\u2019t -- knowing that she lost her brother, you know, I tried to be nice, and yet she -- she fell\ndown by herself. She lost --",
        "Q: You mean, she became weaker? Or she really fell?",
        "A: Sh-She fell.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: How you say that -- the word when --",
        "Q: She collapsed?",
        "A: Collapsed.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Was this -- your aunt was on your father\u2019s side, or your mother\u2019s side?",
        "A: On my father\u2019s side.",
        "Q: Your father\u2019s side. So you really couldn\u2019t talk with her?",
        "A: Not much.",
        "Q: Yeah. So how long did you live with her? Do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Well a la -- I lived about a year.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And then I went to the house that my father had bought. But other people were living inside.\nSo they decide to give me two or three rooms there. So I stayed there for awhile, and then my ex-\nhusband -- we used to be good friends, but that\u2019s all, you know? I was too young, and I didn\u2019t\ndate before, I didn\u2019t know too much about men. I don\u2019t know -- well, I thought since he is my\nbest friend, you know, we\u2019ll be good. But unfortunately -- I -- I stayed with him until the\nchildren grew up, they finished college and everything. And then I thought, ah well, that\u2019s it, I ca\n-- I can\u2019t take no more.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And you know, sometimes I think maybe the reason that we both went through a lot, maybe\nthis is the reason that we couldn\u2019t stay together.",
        "Q: Because it was too much to be --",
        "A: You know, yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s possible.",
        "A: Yeah, you know, because if I would marry someone that didn\u2019t go through all this -- we\nwould just say sometimes jokes and things like that, that will make me change little bit, or -- but\nno, it -- it wasn\u2019t a --",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t easy.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t easy.",
        "Q: And did you have two children? Rinette is one, and a boy, or another girl?",
        "A: A boy. I lost my son.",
        "Q: You lost your son.",
        "A: I lost my son when he was 25.",
        "Q: Oh my. So you haven\u2019t had an easy time at all.",
        "A: That was my worst part.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you talk a lot about the Holocaust, a-about your experiences after the war? You\ndidn\u2019t?",
        "A: Cause nobody knew in Houston about it.",
        "Q: And you -- when you were in Greece, were you talking with people more?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: It was -- it was -- did it make it easier to talk?",
        "A: Yeah, right, because they were asking me questions like you ask me now.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Exactly like that.",
        "Q: And that was easier?",
        "A: But still I wouldn\u2019t say, because my aunt fainted, and I found out the word now.",
        "Q: And so you thought that that\u2019s what peo -- what would happen to people if you talked? You\nwould be doing something bad to them.",
        "A: And I tried to make some jokes, and I mean [inaudible]",
        "Q: Yeah, right. I -- okay, let\u2019s change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: You know, it\u2019s interesting, because it -- when the camera was not -- was not on, you were\ntalking about what you had to learn, which I guess you watched your mother cooking, but you --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Oh, you didn\u2019t? So you were not aware of how to keep a house?",
        "A: Is th -- the way, is I smell the food, that\u2019s how I thought that that\u2019s what probably did it.",
        "Q: So you -- you could tell what the smell was --",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: -- that a food should --",
        "A: And my ex-husband used to say that I\u2019m the best cook.",
        "Q: How long did it take you to learn how to cook?",
        "A: It didn\u2019t take me long.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t take you long?",
        "A: No. And it\u2019s amazed me.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because I never liked to cook, and I cook so well, because he used to say that I\u2019m the best\ncook.",
        "Q: Right. Was it easy for you to learn how to take care of children, or was that hard?",
        "A: It was hard, especially that my ex-husband didn\u2019t -- he wasn\u2019t the type to -- what he -- when\nhe wanted to talk to them, he would write to me, please tell Rinette so and so, or tell Fred so and\nso, you know.",

        "Q: Guns, right. But you know what the -- Plato quoted Socrates as saying it\u2019s better to suffer\nwrong than to do wrong. So I begin to think that maybe this comes from your Greek background.",
        "A: The Greek philosophy.",
        "Q: Right. Maybe.",

        "A: I wait, because they didn\u2019t have a chance to speak with anybody. It was much too much to tell\nthem, and to keep them inside of them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, nobody, even in the synagogues, there -- people won\u2019t let their -- the rabbi to\nspeak about the Holocaust, until recently. About 10 days in -- 10 years, because they didn\u2019t want\ntheir children to know.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t want their children to know, period.",
        "A: So it was very hard for the children [inaudible]",

        "A: Well, it\u2019s after I brought her here --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- last year. It did a lot of good her. She wasn\u2019t talking at all. See? And I thought -- and I tell\nyou the truth, if I came, I came more for her. So that she will see other people, she will talk, she\nwill find out things --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- and you know, because you know, I-I could tell her suffering, you know?",
        "Q: Yes. And she -- she --",
        "A: She had -- she had to let it go, you know, and talk.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I think it did a lot of good, because coming back to Houston, she started talking and\nbeing involved in everything.",
        "Q: And could she hear you better, do you think?",
        "A: Yeah, I think so, and we talked these things together a lot.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t talk for years, until recently.",
        "Q: So the tribute -- you\u2019re talking about the Holocaust museum tribute to survivors in November\nof \u00b093. I guess it was a year ago. No, less than a year ago. This past November.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: Is that \u201993?\nQ2: \u201903.",
        "Q: \u00b003. I\u2019m sorry. \u201903, right, 2003. Well that\u2019s interesting, because it\u2019s a long time to not talk. Do\nyou wish you had spoken before, in some ways, or not?",
        "A: Well, I was hurting her, it felt like I was hurting her.",
        "Q: By telling her?",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s why I wanted t -- for her to talk with other people the same age, you know.",
        "Q: Right, right, right. Do you think she thinks it hurts you too much to talk, so that\u2019s why it hurts\n-- see that -- that --",
        "A: Exactly. Exactly.",
        "Q: So in some ways it stops both of you, because you don\u2019t want to hurt each other.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, she\u2019s very sensitive.",

        "A: Not much.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But I think probably his mother talked to him a little bit.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "A: Not much, but --",
        "Q: Right. Have you ever talked in schools, with -- with kids?",
        "A: Well, I tell you, they were asking me a lot to go to schools and talk, and I went once, they\nforce [indecipherable]. It was a woman from a school, a Jewish woman, but she used to teach\nthat school, it was for advanced children. And they told her to -- to whom to come, and she came\nto me. I liked her very much. And I said, \u201cWell why you want me? You see that I have difficulty,\nand,\u201d -- I said, \u201cI can tell you -- I can tell you which people you can go to, and th-they help you\nout better.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cI want you.\u201d And she kept coming, coming at my house until she\nmade me go. I said, \u201cOkay, but we won\u2019t let my daughter come, because she\u2019s going to be\nembarrassed.\u201d So -- and she didn\u2019t come, we didn\u2019t tell her. So -- and I went with her, and the\nchildren were so involved that they didn\u2019t want to go. They [indecipherable]",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t want to leave you?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t want to go. The -- their mothers came to pick them up and they didn\u2019t want to\nleave. So what happened is their mothers stayed there. And -- and the mothers all start asking\nquestions. I -- I th -- I thought that I won\u2019t be able to -- to talk, and I said \u2019Il embarrass\neverybody, you know? But they liked it. And -- and they keep asking me again and again, but I\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened that day,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s a miracle, because I -- I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t\ndiscuss.\u201d",
        "Q: Did it mean something to you that they were so involved? Was that goo -- good for you?",
        "A: Oh, of cour --",
        "Q: It must have been, yes, huh?",
        "A: -- oh, you should see the way the children came and hugged me, and one black child was\nthere, and -- what did he say? I don\u2019t remember what, he said something that impressed me, but I\ncan\u2019t remember. And -- and the one Jewish girl, her mother ma -- married a -- a Jew, and her\nmother was -- she said that, \u201cIf I lived at that time in Europe,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019s what they will do\nto me, too, even though.\u201d I said yes. It doesn\u2019t make [indecipherable]. I had to be honest, you\nknow. Because it doesn\u2019t -- if one of the parent Jew, they go.",
        "Q: Right. So, if that was so meaningful, why do you think you didn\u2019t do it again? You think it\nwas some miracle? It was some odd event?",
        "A: It couldn\u2019t have been me, I couldn\u2019t [indecipherable |",
        "Q: It couldn\u2019t be you? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re right.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I used to say, why doesn\u2019t me believe me?",
        "Q: Tell me something, what do you -- what did all of this teach you, you think?",
        "A: Well, it teaches me to learn lessons from the past, and not to ne -- e -- repeat them again,\nbecause we\u2019re getting more interesting, more intelligent, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s why go through this?",
        "Q: You think the world has changed?",
        "A: It hasn\u2019t change, but we want to change.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, they can see all these things. Instead of having all of these ugly movies and everything,\nwe should have more history, say what happened, you know? And things keep repeating and\nrepeating, and they\u2019re getting worse now. So --",
        "Q: So do you really think people can learn from the past?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think, no.",
        "Q: But you as an individual, did you think that these events changed you?",
        "A: Of course I\u2019m not the same person that I was before, but I\u2019m stronger. Maybe you see me\nnow walking when I [indecipherable] today I wasn\u2019t feeling well. But I feel strong inside of me.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I feel like we have to do the best we can, and talk. Talk not maliciously, talk in the way\nthat we can understand each other, and be friends with each other.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And everybody can, if they want to pray to God, or they want to pray to Christ, and they can\ndo that. But you can -- there\u2019s no reason for us not to talk, not to be friends. We all are children\nof God.",
        "Q: But you also learned that from your father, didn\u2019t you, in some way?",
        "A: Well -- well, I -- I think I learned more from my uncle [indecipherable] than my father.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Mm-hm. He was very religious.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: My father wasn\u2019t. He would wake up in the morning and he\u2019Il put his --",
        "Q: Tefillin on, yeah?",
        "A: Uh-huh, yeah. And five o\u2019clock he\u2019ll be up.",
        "Q: This is your uncle?",
        "A: He was a very good man, and very religious. None of us was -- was religious.",
        "Q: Was -- yes. And you\u2019re more religious now than you were when you were a child, when you\nwere younger, or not?",
        "A: Well, I believe -- n-now I believe that our religion makes sense, you know? And I don\u2019t see\nany other makes sense as a -- as ours. And I think it\u2019s superior. And I feel like how can anybody\nbelieve anything else, you know, and we do. We made mistakes, too.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But still, I think, we gave the best to the world.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Is there anything more you\u2019d like to say? Something I haven\u2019t asked you, or\n[indecipherable] think?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know, huh?",
        "A: I wish I can think something.",
        "Q: Let me ask you what\u2019s -- what -- I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s a fair question. Do you wish all of\nthat didn\u2019t happen? I know -- I mean it -- clearly you wish that your relatives hadn\u2019t died, and\nother people hadn\u2019t died. But in terms of what happened to you, since you survived, do you look\nat your life and say I just wish all of that didn\u2019t happen, or is there something about it that\nactually became important for you in who you became? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s even a fair\nquestion, but --",
        "A: Well, I thi -- I couldn\u2019t wait to -- to be free. And I thought the first thing that I would do is I\nwould go to a mountain and thank God, you know? Or -- but I was too sick and -- to do that, I\ncouldn\u2019t do it. First thi -- I -- I had -- I couldn\u2019t understand why God did this to us.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Couldn\u2019t understand. But now I feel maybe they are in better place.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And I\u2019m not afraid to die myself. I\u2019m going with them.",
        "Q: Well, I want to thank you. It\u2019s really been wonderful to be with you today.",
        "A: Oh, I hope so.",
        "Q: It really has, it\u2019s been a pleasure for me.",

        "Q: Yeah. Go ahead.",
        "Q: Okay, and --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t go hiking in the mountains, or skiing, or did you?",
        "Q: Isn\u2019t there a mountain near you called Falakro mountain, in Drama?",
        "Q: F-a-l-a-k-r-o. No? Maybe that\u2019s later.",
        "Q: So did you -- when you -- did you go outside with the family and go on picnics, or --",
        "Q: Yes, you did.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: But this is as a family?",
        "Q: You\u2019re not going alone anywhere?",
        "Q: No. Did you ever say anything to your father or mother?",
        "Q: No, you didn\u2019t. This was how you were raised, and this was the way it was.",
        "Q: Right. When Hitler takes over in Germany, when the Nazis take over, in 1933, do people get\nworried? Does your family get worried? Do you feel it? I mean you were --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: They open an account in Switzerland?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: A grudge?",
        "Q: No grudge.",
        "Q: Yes. So were your parents putting money there because you -- they thought that maybe they\nwould try to leave?",
        "Q: All in one place, anyway.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: The people who had a lot of money?",
        "Q: So -- and the Nazis take over, there\u2019s -- there\u2019s not -- you\u2019re not feeling tension in \u201933 - 34 -\n\u00b035 - \u00b036. You\u2019re going to school, you\u2019re in Salonika, Thalonika, right, and going to school.",
        "Q: Is it Salonika or Thalonika?",
        "Q: Thessaloniki.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Else, right. In 1936, Metaxas becomes prime minister and he\u2019s -- likes fascism. He likes the\nGermans, he likes --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember. So you think perhaps it didn\u2019t have any impact on you in 1936? You\u2019re\nstill in school --",
        "Q: No, nothing.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re hearing nothing from your family?",
        "Q: Are you reading the newspapers?",
        "Q: In school?",
        "Q: Did you read it when you were home?",
        "Q: And what were -- what were you reading?",
        "Q: So who did you read in Russian? Tolstoy? Dostoyevsky?",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "Q: Did you read Babel? Maybe it wasn\u2019t published then. Not Tolstoy?",
        "Q: And who did you read in French?",
        "Q: French books, yes?",
        "Q: Okay then -- then we won\u2019t ask. Maybe it\u2019ll come [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: No, unfortunately, I think you\u2019re right. Did you like movies?",
        "Q: No, but when you were a child, when you were young, in Greece?",
        "Q: Did you see American movies also?",
        "Q: Yeah, did you like them?",
        "Q: Yeah? American movies went everywhere, I guess.",
        "Q: But Greek --",
        "Q: Cowboys?",
        "Q: I knew you were going to say that, yes. Well, what can I tell you?",
        "Q: No, we\u2019ll see it later.",
        "Q: You have a cowboy hat, yes?",
        "Q: Cow -- a cow -- well, you moved to cowboy country.",
        "Q: No, no. Did -- did you have any boyfriends when you were in boarding school?",
        "Q: No. This was no -- was this all girls?",
        "Q: It was all girls.",
        "Q: What do you mean it was with the family? [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Uh-huh, so it was always chaperoned in some respect. You look a little funny with that. You\ndon\u2019t think that was such a good idea?",
        "Q: Right, right. Who decides to move to Athens?",
        "Q: They both decided.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So they thought you should leave?",
        "Q: Well, let me ask you something before, cause that\u2019s really very important. Wh-When you and\nyour family are in Drama, your father is close to the king. Am I right, or at least he knows --",
        "Q: That was -- okay --",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay, is it all right? Because I -- it\u2019s going to start with me, too. The if the king would\ncome to town, to Drama, your father would see him, yes? And -- am I right that you tell me when\nhe wanted to call his wife he would come to your house, because he could be private, and\nnobody would be listening. So your -- your family was not only wealthy and -- and prominent in\nterms of being wealthy, but they were very well connected in terms of people who knew what\nwas going on in the world. So, in a sense t -- your father was warned, maybe it would be just\nbetter to leave.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Now were these people in Athens who said that, or people all over Greece who said that to\nyou?",
        "Q: And maybe outside?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Let -- let me ask you just a funny question now. You say Greeks, and you mean Greek\nChristians. So what did you call yourself?",
        "Q: Jew.",
        "Q: But when you say Greeks, you don\u2019t mean Jewish.",
        "Q: Greek Orthodox when you say Greek. I\u2019m just -- it\u2019s very -- it\u2019s --",
        "Q: Right, but you were a Greek Jew, not just Greek.",
        "Q: No, right. Okay.",
        "Q: Right. When you moved to Greece, was that before the Italians attacked? Cause you moved in\nOctober of 1940.",
        "Q: And October 28\", the Italians attacked Greece.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes, okay.",
        "Q: Right, uh-huh.",
        "Q: So when -- when you left Drama with the family, you left everything there, and you just took\nclothes. And did you go by car?",
        "Q: You flew from Drama to Athens. And did you go to someone\u2019s house in Athens, or did you\nrent a place, or buy a place?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And was it as big, and as --",
        "Q: No, it wasn\u2019t, no. It wasn\u2019t like what it was before.",
        "Q: It was --",
        "Q: Right. And what happened to the house?",
        "Q: You just left 1t? Did that make you feel funny?",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: After the war.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t feel much of a transition to go to Athens and live in a smaller place? No.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting, cause y --",
        "Q: It was okay.",
        "Q: And Haim, of course, is with you, yes?",
        "Q: He couldn\u2019t stand it?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: You brought him to -- so he\u2019d be with you. He wasn\u2019t hitting you any more though, I assume.",
        "Q: No, this --",
        "Q: Right. And was your father still working in Athens? I mean, how would you take care of\nyourself?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Sheets --",
        "Q: Pillows --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Is there a school for you, or no school?",
        "Q: In 1940 -- not [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Public school?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, high school?",
        "Q: Oh, to college? In Athens?",
        "Q: The Germans come in --",
        "Q: -- in \u00b041, yes?",
        "Q: I think so, yes. In April they invade --",
        "Q: -- in 1941. When you moved to Athens and you see the Italian soldiers, are you then more\nafraid?",
        "Q: Nothing. And you know the war is going on in Europe?",
        "Q: But you\u2019 re not afraid.",
        "Q: Right, the Italians were stopped, or at least there\u2019s a stalemate, they can\u2019t get through. But\nthen the Germans come in, and they do win, and they divide the country into three parts.",
        "Q: So --",
        "Q: Right. No, the Salonika Jews just get -- it\u2019s dec -- decimated.",
        "Q: Yes, yes. Do you remember when th -- when, after the German invasion, and that Athens is\noccupied by both the Italians and the Germans? Do you remember seeing both troops?",
        "Q: Ancient theater, yeah.",
        "Q: She was with them. So that must have been a big shock, yeah.",
        "Q: Then you got worried.",
        "Q: That they would stop.",
        "Q: Right. We have to stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape Two",
        "Q: Wer -- where was this ancient theater? This wasn\u2019t the colis -- this is not --",
        "Q: In Athens.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, so -- I see. These outdoor theaters are just -- it\u2019s outdoors, right? It\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nwonderful.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: No matter when, in the year, really? It sounds wonderful. Were there restrictions once the\nGermans took over Athens? Did you have to wear a Jewish star --",
        "Q: No Jewish star?",
        "Q: No, but you\u2019re not -- you\u2019re go -- you move too fast.",
        "Q: That was in 1944. I\u2019m talking about 1941.",
        "Q: When they take over, are there -- there must be restrictions for Jews?",
        "Q: No?",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m talking about before you\u2019re in hiding. You go into hiding f -- \u201942 - \u00b043, but you\u2019re not\n-- you\u2019re in your house with your parents and Haim in 1941, yes?",
        "Q: No?",
        "Q: Yes. So for one year --",
        "Q: -- you\u2019re not in hiding.",
        "Q: Right? So what happens? You stay pretty much in the house?",
        "Q: You go out?",
        "Q: And -- and so you don\u2019t feel -- are you going to school?",
        "Q: No, you couldn\u2019t bi -- ga -- you couldn\u2019t go to school.",
        "Q: Now, was everybody stopped from going to school, or only the Jewish students, do you\nremember?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember, okay.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: Yes. So you don\u2019t know, huh?",
        "Q: So who ma -- the su -- was there a discussion in your house about hiding?",
        "Q: There was?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Really? So you didn\u2019t just stay with one family during this -- is it --",
        "Q: Two or three families. And who ma -- did your father make the decision that you sh -- you\nshould hide, or was it obvious, there were a lot of families who were doing this?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: Did you look -- I don\u2019t know what it means in Greece. In Poland it seems that some Jews\nlooked Jewish to Polish Catholics. Was there a look, so that if someone saw Haim they would\nthink he was a Jewish --",
        "Q: Like everybody else.",
        "Q: But when you say Haim might be seen, it was because he was known to be Jewish --",
        "Q: -- not because he looked Jewish, I see. So were you afraid of these Germans now? Did -- at\nsome point did you become afraid of these guys?",
        "Q: No, no, no, then.",
        "Q: When -- when you went into hiding.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay.",
        "Q: In trains, to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: So the hiding period is not such a terrible period because you\u2019re with people who know you.",
        "Q: Who care about you.",
        "Q: In Greece, and want to be good to you. But your life is all indoors, because the Germans are\nclearly looking for Jews, yes?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: Right. Now, your father is not working when you\u2019re in hiding, or is he going in and out?",
        "Q: He stays -- he stays inside. Do you think your father is -- is -- is helping with the cost of\nkeeping you there by paying people, or are these wealthy people and they don\u2019t want money?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: Now, what happened to the house that you had bought? You just left that house, with now\nless clothes, I assume, and go into hiding. So each time you move, you have less and less things.\nIs there something that you take with you because you -- some, I don\u2019t know --",
        "Q: BBC.",
        "Q: Both sides.",
        "Q: The Germans started laughing?",
        "Q: Right, right. Did he believe you?",
        "Q: Your brother, when you told him.",
        "Q: He did. That was a very difficult situation I would imagine --",
        "Q: -- very painful.",
        "Q: And hi -- was he hit? Did he look as beaten -- yes.",
        "Q: Yes. Do you think also that they were hit because they were men and you were women? Do\nyou think there was some difference?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: But didn\u2019t your father speak German?",
        "Q: Oh, he didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: I see, I see.",
        "Q: Oh yes, right. So did this person who denounced you, who told the Germans, did he know that\nyou were leaving? He must have known, because otherwise why would they stop your car?",
        "Q: Ah, so --",
        "Q: Right. But he wasn\u2019t the person at the time who was -- whose house you were staying at?",
        "Q: No, it was somebody else\u2019s.",
        "Q: Did you ever re-meet this man? Did you ever see him again?",
        "Q: Something.",
        "Q: Yes, right.",
        "Q: Mm. The people who were hiding you, wi -- were they harmed because they were hiding\nyou? The ger -- they --",
        "Q: They weren\u2019t?",
        "Q: There.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: They did it anyway. But the ge -- it\u2019s interesting that the Germans wouldn\u2019t then try to find\nthe people who were hiding you, even though you were outside the house.",
        "Q: Because you would think that they would --",
        "Q: -- punish them.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So being in Haidari had to be a big shock for you, because now you knew\nyou were endangered, yes?",
        "Q: Tell me something, had you heard the rumors about anything the Nazis were doing?",
        "Q: That they were shooting Jews, and some [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Not much.",

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So this 1 -- this is --",
        "Q: So she -- she had the sense that something really terrible was --",
        "Q: So how do you know she knew? Did she talk to you later?",
        "Q: I-I see. And they didn\u2019t listen. So, it\u2019s 1944, and you\u2019re 20 years old.",
        "Q: Your brother is 22 and a half --",
        "Q: 20 -- right? And your parents are how old, about?",
        "Q: Dates --",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see, your father was born 1896 or something?",
        "Q: So they\u2019re very young people. They\u2019re in their 40\u2019s.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: And she had white hair when she was very young?",
        "Q: This happened in Athens?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. That must have been a shock to you too, to watch your mother\u2019s hair --",
        "Q: No?",
        "Q: So ar-are there -- are there members of your family with you in Haidari before you go on the\ntrain? Or their friends? There was a group of people that you know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] So that\u2019s Margosh, yeah. And then there are some friends that you have, that\nyou know.",
        "Q: In the concentration camp, not on the train?",
        "Q: Milka and Leoni?",
        "Q: I see. So tell me about this train. How do you get from Haidari to the train, 1s the -- is Haidari\nright near a train station?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember, okay. And wh-what are you allowed to take with you?",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "Q: Because you didn\u2019t have anything, you were -- so what were you wearing, a gown?",
        "Q: Just a regular -- because you were supposed to be going to this wedding, but it was not such a\nbig --",
        "Q: And shoes, just high heels?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Cause you were in Haidari for a few weeks, yes?",
        "Q: You mean the Germans took you -- they took you someplace to do this questioning.",
        "Q: So was it a prison or jail, or a room?",
        "Q: A house, uh-huh. Did they give you food in Haidar1?",
        "Q: They did. Was it -- you were able to sleep?",
        "Q: Yeah? So you -- I think you said first they put you in a small room, and then they put you all\nin one larger room. And Haidari was like what -- was it a --",
        "Q: -- it was a pri -- it was really a prison. And were there mainly Jews there by the time you got\nthere, as far as you know, or di -- was it [indecipherable]",
        "Q: All Jews.",
        "Q: Iola?",
        "Q: Rhodes, yes.",
        "Q: Tied?",
        "Q: Oh, so they were bandaged?",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t the right strategy, I guess, right?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you\u2019re in a cattle train, there are no seats, of course, yes? You\u2019re put into a -- a\ntrain, and you\u2019re standing, and ya -- are -- are you with your parents? And your ex-husband is\nthere, but you -- do you know him then?",
        "Q: He was in another place.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did you --",
        "Q: I see, okay. So, is this a long trip to Auschwitz?",
        "Q: A few days?",
        "Q: Few days. Was it terrible?",
        "Q: To -- to go to the bathroom, yeah.",
        "Q: Was there a bucket?",
        "Q: But -- and did you st -- do you remember standing, sitting?",

        "Q: Uh-huh. Were people screaming, were people crying?",
        "Q: Nothi -- everybody was quiet?",
        "Q: And they left?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Huh. Did you think about doing that?",
        "Q: He wouldn\u2019t?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So, does your mother si -- 1s there any conversation between all of you? Nothing?\nYou must have been all in shock. So what happens when you arrive in this place? Nobody -- of\ncourse, they don\u2019t tell you that you\u2019re going to Auschwitz, yes?",
        "Q: They did put a tattoo?",

        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Let -- let me go back for a moment. When -- when you arrive in Auschwitz, they separate the\nmen and the women, yes? So you\u2019re with your mother, and you see your father and your brother\noff -- going off to another direction.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: To the gas chamber? But this was a way to save you, what she told. She knew what she was\ndoing.",
        "Q: And how long did it take you to find out what had happened?",
        "Q: At the end of the war, or --",
        "Q: Right, you were -- a few months.",

        "A: And maybe the Germans found out that he was hiding Jews, who knows if he gave us up. And\nall of a sudden Germans stop us going to the -- to the ship, and since I knew German, I got out of\nthe car, and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you taking us. I mean now, as you see, we are\ndressed, we are going to a wedding.\u201d He said, \u201cFraulein, we know everything about you. You\ndon\u2019t have to tell us any more.\u201d\u201d Mm-hm. \u201cSo you\u2019ll come with us.\u201d And they took us to a place\nto -- where the Germans were. And they started to interrogate first my father and my brother. So\nthey came back, when they came back I was so scared to look at them, because my father didn\u2019t\nhave the front teeth, and you know, it seems that they hit them. So then they came to pick us up,\nmy mother and myself. And I spoke to them in German because I knew German, and -- and\nprobably that\u2019s the reason they didn\u2019t behave bad with us, they didn\u2019t do anything to us. So we\nwent back to the room where my brother and [indecipherable] and my brother comes to me and\nsays, \u201cYou are no longer my sister.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWhy they didn\u2019t do anything to you? Look\nat us,\u201d you know. \u201cProbably you told them where our relatives are.\u201d I say, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that for\nanything in the world.

        "A: And -- and until today I\u2019m flabbergasted how I didn\u2019t get sick. The whole time that I was\nthere, I never had any headache, or I was sneezing or anything. You know, isn\u2019t that strange?",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know, maybe it -- this time when we were out [indecipherable] women, then they\nmoved us. And then they took us to where they make arms and things like that.",
        "A: Yeah, a factory.",

And they gave it to each one of us, my friends and myself, they\ngave us something to cover ourself. It\u2019s because the allies were coming. And so -- and we\ncouldn\u2019t see, you know, because it was cold, and we had it lowered, and I couldn\u2019t see where my\nfriends were, and we used to call every five minutes, Leoni, Milka,",
        "A: And then finally -- we always stay together, and they took us to Theresienstadt. That was a\nghetto, and there were -- there were Jewish doctors and everything, and they were so sweet to us,\nso nice. And my hair had started to -- to be okay, you know, I had some hair after all this time.",
        "A: So, and -- to one of the [indecipherable], because they were cutting our hairs because we had\ntyphus, all of us. So I said, \u201cWould you please don\u2019t cut my hair,\u201d I said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m going to\nmeet my father pretty soon, and I don\u2019t want him to see me like that.\u2019 And he said okay, and he\ntook care, he treated me and everything, and he [inaudible] you know, and then we -- we were\nthere, all Jews in this ghetto, and -- and they would come to me and say Rachelle -- the Russians",
        "A: -- the -- the -- the Russians are outside, and they\u2019re cooking, and we didn\u2019t have any food.\nSaid, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go in the window, maybe they\u2019Il give you some food?\u201d I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t\nyou go?

        "A: Well, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, they seemed to be very sweet and everything. And then after that, they moved me to a\nhospital where the Russians were, because they didn\u2019t have all the necessary things there in the\nghetto.",
        "A: So -- and they took me there, and while I was there I heard that they were taking all the Jews\nto Siberia. And I thought to myself, no way. So I had th -- they gave me a shirt to sleep, and I\nhad -- how do you call it --",
        "A: The pillowcase. From the pillowcase I made that -- a skirt, because I couldn\u2019t go out, and I\ncouldn\u2019t go through the door because they will attack me, you know.",
        "A: So, from the window, I --",
        "A: -- [jumped. And nothing -- I was very thin, you know, and nothing happened to me, and I\nstarted walking fast. And I found some French women that they -- I-I knew in the concentration\ncamp, and they said to me, \u201cOh Rachelle, comme vous \u00e9tes chic.\u201d",
        "A: Chic.",
        "A: See, I had the -- my hair.",
        "A: And so that was funny. And I always say something funny to friends if they ask me\nsomething, you know, because -- and you will see some pictures, you saw some pictures where --\nwhere the ji -- the Americans --",
        "A: -- and y-you can\u2019t tell that I\u2019m a survivor.",
        "A: You know, I\u2019m laughing, like.",
        "A: Because I had this thing in my mind that we have to do the best we can while we are alive,\nforget what happened. We are good friends, you know, [indecipherable] and -- but then when we\nwent to Greece, we didn\u2019t find the parents.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right, no, Paula, no, she wasn\u2019t with us there.",
        "A: Went -- we stayed together.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. See, we -- we didn\u2019t want to stay there with the Russians because -- so 1 -- 1t was the\nFrench Red Cross that came to pick up their people. So we all knew French [indecipherable] so\nthey took us, and they took us to where the Americans were, in Frankfort.",
        "A: We -- we spoke to them fr -- in French, yeah --",
        "A: -- and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s where they were -- they weren\u2019t going straight to --",
        "A: -- yeah, they stopped there.",
        "A: And the Americans [indecipherable] they wanted us as interpreters, and they gave us clothes\nbecause we didn\u2019t have any clothes, we were dressed alike.",
        "A: With a soldier\u2019s clothes.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I look fat there, and you know, little earlier I was very thin --",
        "A: -- when I [indecipherable]. But the Americans gave us everything good they had, they used to\nsend them from th -- America --",
        "A: -- they used to give it to us.",
        "A: Yeah, I-I know. I know, and the |-laughing, I mean, like nothing happened.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s because we had th-that kind of thought, you know? We\u2019 forget what --",
        "A: -- hap -- happened in the past, now we\u2019 ll have to start a new life --",
        "A: -- and try to do the best we can.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know until later, until I came here.",
        "A: Rinette tried to -- because you see, Rinette said, maybe he went -- they send him to Siberia. I\nsaid, if [indecipherable] they sent to Siberia, he was too intelligent not to know how to come\nback to Greece, you know? So I didn\u2019t believe that --",
        "A: So then we found out that he died immediately after the war --",
        "A: And my father, too.",
        "A: And the thing is, where I used to ask rush -- the Russians, that we wanted to go back to\nGreece, and they said, well, we can give you some money. But we were -- how can we go from -\n- that far, you know, go to Greece with a little bit of money. Was impossible. Instead, when I\nspoke to the Russians, the Russian were telling us, we\u2019ll take you to America, and we\u2019ll give you\ngood life and everything. Ye -- well, I-I said I\u2019m sorry, I said --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, the American. They were extremely nice. And I said, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t.\u201d I said, \u201cWe can\u2019t go\nnow because we have to go back and find out -- our parents, if our parents returned.\u201d\u201d And do you\nknow what? He gave us a plane.",
        "A: A plane.",
        "A: Plane.",
        "A: No, it w-were about six, but a -- ma -- the -- most of the plane was empty.",
        "A: Yeah. See, w-who would do that? Nobody, nobody. They were so nice, it\u2019s -- Pll never forget\nthat.",
        "A: But you know, it was one of us when -- a Jewish man that he ask me to be his girlfriend, and I\nsaid, I\u2019m sorry. At this point, you know, my mind 1s not ki -- cannot think anything, you know,\nright now. I want to go to Greece and find my parents.",
        "A: So what he did is he was writing the names that will be on the plane, he took my name off. A\nJewish man.",
        "A: Yeah, because I said that I couldn\u2019t be, because -- I had a good reason, I mean it\u2019s not that I\nwas going with anybody else, or anything.",
        "A: I said that I wasn\u2019t ready for something like that. And so a friend of mine, Leoni, took the list,\nand she says, \u201cWell, Rachelle is not here in this list.\u201d\u201d And that\u2019s how I know. I got back into the\nlist, and I went.",
        "A: Well, Leoni put it back on.",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t expect the same day to find them, you know? We thought with another plane,\nwith -- or maybe they -- they -- there were nice other people like this Americans, you know. So -\n- and maybe they\u2019Il come in a few days. And my uncle, which -- I mean, he -- like I said, he\u2019s a\ngood man, very good man, he helps others, he doesn\u2019t care about himself, but he wants to help\nwith the rest of the family. He went to -- to our friends, and he wanted the things they were\nholding for us, to take h-he -- and you know, ma -- our friends were embarrassed by that. They\n[indecipherable] and they said well, when Rachelle or the rest of the family comes, you know,\nwe'll give it to them.",
        "A: Well, we -- we used to go from one house to the other.",
        "A: In Athens?",
        "A: No, first we bought a house, because the Germans weren\u2019t there yet.",
        "A: Oh after I ca --",
        "A: After the war. Well, I saw them, but I could tell that they were very embarrassed by my uncle\n-- what my uncle did, and I was embarrassed too. And -- and with that man that gave us up, you\nknow, to the Germans --",
        "A: All this started coming up, you know, and I didn\u2019t want to think much about it. So -- and I\nwas involved with my relatives and others, so -- I didn\u2019t see -- and I forgot their names. My\ndaughter -- every time we see each other, she tries t -- for me to remember, I can\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I only remember one name, Kalantzi. He\u2019s the one who wrote the poem, but I didn\u2019t know\nhim, I knew his -- a-another man that was a friend of my father, and his name was Kalantzi.",
        "A: But this one I didn\u2019t know, as -- just we met, you know, and it\u2019s amazing the poem he wrote.\nThings that we Jews don\u2019t say, you know, he said for us. And that\u2019s the kind of friends we need.\nWe can say a lot of things, instead of making friends, we can make enemies, but when they say\nthe good things, then people listen.",
        "A: Well, we intended that because Leoni had an aunt in Athens that survived, and she had a big\nhouse, and she told us you stay with me, we\u2019ll stay together. But when my cousin came to see\nme, she said -- he said, no I don\u2019t think you can stay here because my mother will die. See, she\nwas my only aunt, there. But I wish I would stay with my friends.",
        "A: It was difficult because I couldn\u2019t talk. I -- I used to say -- you know me, I don\u2019t say things\nthat are very bad, you know?",
        "A: I try to make things, I don\u2019t know, easier a little bit for the other person that listens. And I\ndidn\u2019t -- knowing that she lost her brother, you know, I tried to be nice, and yet she -- she fell\ndown by herself. She lost --",
        "A: Sh-She fell.",

        "A: Not much.",
        "A: Well a la -- I lived about a year.",
