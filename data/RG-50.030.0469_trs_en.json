And when he heard that they took my parents, he ran away from\nhis hidden pla -- place, came home to help my parents, to go with them, and therefore he went\nwith them. And there -- I met once in a train, one of his friends who was in the same lager that he\n-- he says they worked in a forest with my brother, many people went in, and the young men, in\nDeblin -- in Deblin, it\u2019s somewhere near to Lublin. I didn't say -- I didn\u2019t see mention these\nlager, this concentration lager, but it must have been a small lager.

That\u2019s where they died, all three of them. My mother, she worked\nin a bakery, and she worked at home. She had many friends in the bakery, many, many friends,\npeople liked her. She liked to talk. A real woman. And so I was a quiet child, working very, very\nhard, I studied hard because I promised myself that I don\u2019t want to be poor. I have to make it.\nAnd therefore I studied for a decent future. And like a girl, a young girl, I hoped that I will be\nhappy sometimes. That\u2019s approximate the same. Maybe [indecipherable] will -- lived in a big\nhouse from my great-grandfather, yes? Apartment was small, but there were tenants there. It was\nan aun -- no, it was a -- an grand-aunt. Was my mother\u2019s brother there, my mother\u2019s sister there\nliving. My mother\u2019s two cousins, and then some tenants, all [indecipherable].

        "A: Not cruelty.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Not cruelty. But some of misery. People were poor, people didn\u2019t understand each other.\nPeople didn\u2019t try to help, they didn\u2019t care about each other. It\u2019s a like -- like here. Who cares if\nsomebody\u2019s poor, if some -- if they are not so poor, [indecipherable] somebody should care\nabout us, but still I saw that it\u2019s a big difference between people.

        "A: Dieter Rishter, from Bratislava. Was a story -- I have so many stories.",
        "Q: That\u2019s great.",
        "A: When I was home, at home, my uncle the teacher, he was not much older than me because he\nwas from the second husband of my grandmother, yeah. He wasn\u2019t much older. Even I liked him\nlike [indecipherable] boy, and so -- so I went once in his room, and I saw there a letter lying on\nthe table, I was looking at it. And there was a little picture, little picture of a girl, and it was\nsigned like, eira Dieter, e1ra Dieter, yeah. I didn\u2019t ask anybody. I always had the nature not to\nask, I don\u2019t ask people anything. When they s -- you say something to me, you say\n[indecipherable]. So I was -- and I remembered this name Dieter, yes, and I knew that was from\nBratislava, because he went, this cousin, to visit. That\u2019s it. And went to [indecipherable] in the\nlager, and there -- you see, when people cannot fight enemies, yeah, Americans with the\nCanadians, with Mexicans and so they turn against groups, yeah. So was in lager also. The first\nday, the girls started. Oh you western girls, be ashamed, all you eastern girls, yes. I was from\nwest Slovakia, or east Slovakia -- my direction is always [indecipherable] -- east Slovakia,\nBratislava was from west Slovakia. So -- and once, in 1942, we were in Birkenau right aw --\nright away, yes, was maybe in -- in -- no, I don\u2019t ri -- in winter after we came there. We were\nstanding the whole Sunday outside, was cold, very cold. We are standing there. And that time I\nthink we didn\u2019t have more these uniforms, we were somehow in civil dresses, and we had the\nline. [indecipherable]. There was a group of girls and they played around and talked and so, and\nthey were from the other part of Slovakia, and they asked me where I am from. I said from this\npart of slo -- said, oh, you are the same like we are. You are -- you don\u2019t belong there\n[indecipherable]. I was very honored, yes. Bigger group. So and there was a girl and they played\naround with her joking, and said -- oh, somebody said, oh my Dieter. Dieter, yeah. And I ask her,\n\u2018Are you Dieter Rishter?\u201d She said, \u201cYes, I am Dieter Rishter.\u201d So -- because he told me her\nname is Dieter Rishter. So I said, my uncle is whoever. She said, oh, I remember him very well.\nAnd then I stayed with them, and she said, come with me, come with me, we will be together.\nBecause we could move our bunks, yes, and in this barrack where we were, there were beds,\neverybody had one bed, not this bunk. [indecipherable]. But two -- two girls slept together\nbecause these beds were -- come, come with me, we will be together. She has a -- she had the\nolder sister there. So then I stayed with her, and we became very, very good friends. We worked\ntogether, we were in the same commando and we were together. But she became sick. And when\nwe had our biggest, biggest selection, 1943, so she had swollen legs. We were sitting in the\nsauna the whole night on benches and so, so she had up her legs and I was massaging her legs,\nshe was very, very sick. I took care of her. And then in the -- the whole night we were sitting\nthere in the sauna, and during the morning we had to line up, and it was a selection, and that was\nthe biggest, biggest selection, because always when the lager was full, 1t wasn\u2019t place where to\nsleep, then they made the selection. Between that time we went back to the other barrack, we had\n-- we slept on these bunks and so -- and so it was a big selection, very big, first they took one,\nthen five left, and so on and so on and so. So I asked myself someday, how come that they never\nselected me, that they never pointed on me. So I came to the conclusion, maybe it\u2019s true, because\nI never looked at them. [indecipherable] like this. I was straight, and I never looked up there. I\nsays, and maybe they pointed and I didn\u2019t see. But I think [indecipherable] maybe\n[indecipherable]. Anyhow, so I put Dieter in front of me, Dieter do -- she spoke German, you go\nin front of me, and I will follow you on the selection, because I was so sure that I will make it,\nthat time. So she pointed like that, and she went, and I was praying, oh my God, help me, Dieter\nshould pass by. [indecipherable]. So -- and she went, she passed. They didn\u2019t take her to the gas\nchamber, she passed by. I was so happy, thanks God. Dieter went through sick. And then we had\nto line up again and then they send us to barracks, to different barracks, here, here, we stopped,\nSO, SO, So -- So I lost her, no. She went somewhere else. And the next day in the morning, I don\u2019t\nremember if we didn\u2019t go to work or so, or maybe early morning, I went from one barrack to the\nother one to call her name. Dieter Rishter, Dieter Rishter. No answer. So I went to the next\nbarrack, and to next barrack. And somebody said, \u201cDieter Rishter died.\u201d She survived the\nselection, but she died, sick and exhausted. So what happened? She went down from the\n[indecipherable] from the bank [indecipherable] she had to go down. She went down, she fell\ndown. And she wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] they took her to the -- through to -- to the other\n[indecipherable] and I lost Dieter. I cannot still forget her, such a nice girl. So -- and before --\nexcuse me -- before her, her sister died, before her, you know.",

We made even business together, because\nshe was [indecipherable] work -- working on a place with clothing, you know, from the gas\nchamber when the people arrived. They had to drop there the things, they didn't arrive to the\nlager to leave them. And then they carried the things to our company and we had to -- to -- to\nfold them, to bundle them, and they send it, probably to Germany. And people had some\njewelries, diamonds, and -- in their clothing, yeah. So it was there a pile of this clothing and they\nhave to sortir it, and she was on the pile and I was folding, yeah. So she said once, when I will\ncall summerkleider, summer dresses, so you come, that means that I found something, some\njewelry, something.

Then I\nwent to work on a -- where we were digging soil and preparing a place for roads, for road,\ndigging soil. Then we took the soil from one place to the other one, and so prepare for roads with\nthe this one. Sometimes I went like the time with Tsipi on a field, too. Sometimes we went -- in\nthe wintertime I remember we went -- we took over some straw from one place to the other one,\nsome useless things.

        "A: Okay. So, it was at the beginning, I was still in Auschwitz one, in Auschwitz one, and I had\ngood shoes with laces, high shoes, good shoes, but it was I think in the spring, because I\nremember that the sole was wet sometimes, and -- and cold still. So I don\u2019t know which month it\ncould have been, yes. Maybe between -- between the naishtuber, laundry, maybe between the\nlaundry, because from laundry I went to the naishtuber between -- before. So we had to wear\nimpossible thing, our shoes on our shoulders. You tied the shoes to put on the shoulder, and\nbarefoot in to walk to a forest where there were little stones like gravel, yeah? And we have to\nwalk, so -- and [indecipherable] little gravels, they were cold, and they were wet. And first of all\nmy -- my soles, they became hard and -- and painful, yes, you mention, like that. Later on the\nsoles, they became hard, trained well, no problem. But my eyes, probably from an infa -- an\ninflammation from these cold stones. So on my eyelashes, they were some kind of glue. You\nknow, when I woke up in the morning, I couldn\u2019t open my eyes, cause they were so dry on the\neyelashes, got dry glue. So I had to take off little by little, little by little. And then next night\nagain happened, yes, so I was -- I was f -- quite for a few -- for a time with this -- my eyes, and --\nand one morning, I w -- yeah, so we -- we had to walk barefooten, we worked with the shoes,\nand then we had to take off the shoes, and to come back again barefooten, again this -- to this --\nthrough this -- was so bad, thank God, I still feel chilly when I think about it. So one day I was\nstanding on zaeh -- zaehlappell, and I used to stand in the -- I don\u2019t know why, in the front, first\none. And suddenly was quie -- very quiet, very quiet, and I heard this name Himmler. I knew\nwho was him, who was Himmler. I looked around, not frar -- far from me was standing\nHimmler, with his fancy gla -- eyeglasses. Oh my God, I was so scared that Himmler will look at\nme, and he\u2019ll see my -- my -- my eyes, I thought this [indecipherable] I heard the Gypsies, they\nused to have [indecipherable] too. I was so scared he would send me for death. I didn't know that\ntime gas chambers was in Auschwitz. So I moved slowly, slowly in the back, he shouldn\u2019t see\nme, I should save myself from Himmler. He was standing there looking.",
        "Q: So you did take risks, didn\u2019t you?",
        "A: I took --",
        "Q: Cause it was risky for you to move.",
        "A: I took always risks. I took always risks. And I couldn't when I saw the situation is bad, I\ncannot lose anything, then I took risks. But I cannot lose anything, only my life, and this was a\nrisk by itself. Yeah, so I --",
        "Q: Where did that come from?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",

        "A: No, nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing. And nobody\u2019s said anything to you?",
        "A: But we knew when we were standing in the evening on zaehlappell, so far away, like in a\nforest, there were moving people, bodies moving, somehow it was far, so it seemed to me, or it\nm-meant to me that they are in white uniforms, they are moving around, and flame, we saw\nflame there. And there was a rumor always, we talked about lager.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Said there is the place where they burn people. It was flame, and people were moving there.\nBut later on I learned that they burned outside the crematoriums, people.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right [indecipherable]",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t see close to me.",
        "Q: Did you hear about shooting in -- in Auschwitz one, that there was a punishment block, that\nthey were shooting, did you -- did you hear about that when you were there? No.",
        "A: Not about that, but I -- I heard it.",

And\nthere were boards on the windows, boards, but there were little distances between the boards,\nyes, wooden boards. Little, little distances, and used to look during the day when I came -- it was\nlight, yeah, but at the beginning I even didn\u2019t go for a few days to work because I was washing\nthe stairs and the -- and -- and the -- the floors and whatever. It made me sickening, that was\ndepressing. So anyhow, during the day when we came early probably, I don\u2019t know what time, I\ncannot say that, but I know that was light then, until August was lighter in the day\n[indecipherable] the little distances, I saw these high, high poles, steel from st -- I think from\nsteel, wood, or steel, I don\u2019t know. They were high poles, that\u2019s for sure, a pole like this, and\nthen crosswise on the top, and there I saw a man, young men -- they were high, again I say high,\nhigher than a man. They were hanging like that, the hands in the back like this, like this, and here\nbetwe -- they were hanging on the poles so that their feet didn\u2019t reach the floor -- the earth -- the\nfloor, yes? The earth -- the concrete or what.",
        "Q: So they -- they were being hung by their hands behind their back?",
        "A: Yeah, they were hanged there. So I saw this one, always a few, few, few. And then during the\nnight, sometimes -- sometimes, not always, sometimes I -- but I was always scared to look th-\nthere, I knew I don\u2019t have to see that, was a silent shooting, very silently, cause I was at the\nwindow. And I didn't look out so I wouldn\u2019t see, because it was darkness probably, I don\u2019t -- no,\nI didn\u2019t look. But I heard silent shooting. So I thought, oh, now they are killing, and now after\nthe war, I was in Auschwitz, and I asked somebody there [indecipherable] when I left\n[indecipherable] I met her in Birkenau. I said, I didn\u2019t see these poles where the people were\nhanging. But then later somehow on -- before I -- before I ask, because then bef -- then I went\nthrough these barracks, becau -- and I saw in one place these pole. And my son, I said, you see,\nthese are these poles where people were hanging. And she said it was a quiet [indecipherable] I\nsays, and every night I heard a very, very silent shooting. She said yes, during the night was this\nsilent shooting. And there is now a wall, a-and flowers and Slovak people put flowers. I think it\u2019s\nblack. And even the wooden walls, I think they are black now.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, because she asked me, was it painted? I said no. From this side was not, I didn\u2019t see it\nfrom the other side.",
        "Q: Yeah, Alice, when you say silent shooting, what -- what do you mean? You mean that there\nwas -- there was a silencer on the gun that -- or that you were so far away you could only hear it\na little bit?",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t far.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t far.",

        "A: It\u2019s the closest to the wall.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",

        "Q: Yeah, but what were you hearing, a pop? Just a --",
        "A: Yeah, something like that, yes, not like boom, boom, in the war.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: In combat in the field. Not like that. Silently.",
        "Q: You -- you didn't help at all in building Birkenau. Some of the prisoners were doing that.\nWere you ever over there?",

        "A: No -- yes, the roads.",

        "Q: You think so, but you you\u2019re -- but you\u2019re not sure.",
        "A: I think it. Iam not sure. I know we demolished it there, that place --",

        "Q: Planing?",
        "A: Planing, maybe in German, I would say planating --",
        "Q: Making it smooth?",
        "A: We made it smooth and straight, yes, so we had to dig it, and shovels to dig out and to -- and\nto put it in this wooden container -- container --",
        "Q: A wheelbarrow?",
        "A: Yeah, something and take it to another place, and so on and so -- many useful thing -- useless\nthings we had to -- from one place to the other one. So we did something, yes. And it was at the\nbeginning where we worked at the roads, we [indecipherable] the roads, there was also a civilian\nwho was leading this probably [indecipherable] and the kapos, and SS men, and we worked. And\nthen they were looking, so we were working when they were not looking and not working, and\n[indecipherable] see in -- in -- in German number -- number eight is acht.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Acht -- acht, and -- and be careful is achtung, no -- achtung, so the SS came close, when he\nturned, so we said that in Slovak is acht -- is acht -- achtung, so we said awesome Is -- 1S --\nawesome is acht. [indecipherable]. Then we worked hard. We couldn\u2019t work always like that\n[indecipherable] it easy.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]. Right.",
        "A: We cannot be always a honest worker.",
        "Q: No, not in a situation where they treated you so bad.",
        "A: No [indecipherable]",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, so if I -- if I helped to -- to build, so I hel -- helped to destroy a place, and I helped to\nbuild the roads, yes.",
        "Q: Were there lights in Auschwitz one? Was it -- were there actual lights there?",
        "A: I think that there were in the barracks.",
        "Q: In -- in the barracks?",
        "A: Yeah, I think so, but around the fences there were.",
        "Q: There were.",
        "A: There were high lights during -- with this high voltage electricity during the night. When we\narrived, the day when we arrived, and then always during nights, and the guards they were\nstanding on towers and guarding us, the soldiers, yeah, was a [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So when did you find out that you were all -- all the women were being -- I know me -- men\nwere going into aush -- into Auschwitz-Birkenau, they were already there.",
        "A: The men?",
        "Q: [indecipherable] and being --",
        "A: Of the men I didn\u2019t know. I knew that the women went there because when we came there,\nthey were -- was some life there.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know. Probably it could happen that we were on a zaehlappell on a roll call, and they\nsaid now turn and we go.",
        "Q: And you go.",
        "A: There\u2019s nothing to take. Moving was very easy.",
        "Q: Nothing to -- nothing to pack, easy, right.",
        "A: I cannot remember, I think and think if this container in which we ate, you know the bowl.",
        "Q: The bowl.",
        "A: If we took it with us or we -- or we left it in the -- in the barrack and -- and then we got it\nwhen -- received it when we ar -- I cannot -- I don\u2019t remember, this I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Did you carry the bowl with you all the time?",
        "A: No, that what I don\u2019t remember. I know that we had some little sack hanging, and I don\u2019t\nremember where we took the material to sew it and a needle. I don\u2019t remember. I can see myself\nonly suddenly hanging here something.",
        "Q: Something.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: And what was in it?",
        "A: And a little -- a little bit of bread which we saved from the evening.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And maybe a -- a first knife or s -- when somebody found somewhere on the field a little -- a\nlittle steel or something, and we sharped it on -- on -- on a stone, an-and we cut our bread. So\nmaybe these -- maybe we found somewhere a -- I don\u2019t know how we got a spoon, I don\u2019t know,\nI don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t given a spoon, you were given the bowl.",
        "A: The bowl, but I don\u2019t remember we carried the -- with us when we went to work far, where\nwe were serve. I don\u2019t think -- I cannot see the -- the move around, I know we have only this\nlittle sack, and a little bread, and if we had a little plate, this 1s to cut our bread and\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t remember that, this I don\u2019t. I know only a little bread, and on the way to\nwork, always a bite. It was easy, because we didn\u2019t have to think too much, we -- our thinking\nwent so far as into the [indecipherable] I have still a slice of bread, I get still a little bit.",
        "Q: So -- so your mental state becomes smaller and smaller?",
        "A: Smaller and smaller.",
        "Q: So that you think about very few things.",
        "A: Yes. The emotions, they tend to apathy, total apathy. You think, I do this, I will think about\nfood, I will think about when they will -- no, only when we arrive -- when we arrive back\nafterward, we think if we have a blanket to cover ourselves. Little things, we -- if it is cold, if it 1s",
        "Q: If you picture the barrack and your bed in Auschwitz one, do you see the bowl there? Do you\nthink that you left the bowl on the bed?",
        "A: Not on the bed, maybe there was a little room, concrete floor, maybe -- may -- there were\nservants stumalteste, stumdienst, maybe. Maybe they got there, th-that they put it there, and they\nwashed it there, but 1t wasn\u2019t dirty because if you didn\u2019t wash it -- in Birkenau, we didn\u2019t have\nwater. So couldn\u2019t be so dirty that [indecipherable] after food. So probably they carried from --\nprobably. I don\u2019t know -- know, I speculate on it. Probably they got from the sauna, water, the\nsauna in a bucket or so, and they washed it there and they left it and then we took it from there. A\nlittle room at the end of the barrack -- of the block. I -- I don\u2019t remember how it was.",
        "Q: So do you remember entering Birkenau in August of \u201943, do you remember --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: -- that first day?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I remember.",
        "Q: What -- what can you tell me about it? What was it like?",
        "A: We entered and -- and difference was that they were brick barracks, brick blocks in\nAuschwitz, also brick blocks, but they were lower -- lower brick blocks. And in Auschwitz we\nhad beds, bed, everybody has a bed, or we didn\u2019t have -- and there were these bunks, in Birkenau\nwere bunks, one, two, three.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s three, three high, right?",
        "A: Three, yes.",
        "Q: And more than two people are sleeping on each bunk?",
        "A: Oh my God. Yes, depends how many people were in the block. There were also sometimes\nfive people, and -- and so I fell once down during the night when I had to go on it, so we were\nfour like that, and above us like that, crosswise. And I was afraid to s -- that I will sit on -- on this\nperson who is crosswise, so I went to the end, very end. So I -- I went to the end. So I fell on my\nback on the concrete, and was a big boom. In the morning I went to work, and back pain.",
        "Q: In a lot of pain?",
        "A: Oh, ho, how. I still remember. I was young.",
        "Q: But it\u2019s interesting, because as bad as Auschwitz one was, Birkenau was much worse.",
        "A: Much worse.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: In b -- in Auschwitz, we didn\u2019t know about the gas chambers. We didn\u2019t know. We worked,\nwas very, very hard to work. We didn\u2019t know about the gas chambers. When we came from work\nwe ran around into the -- into this washroom or whatever, there were horizontal pipes, went to\nclean up, and maybe we washed something. There were toilets, there were toilets, I -- I\nremember, so maybe I am wrong, but in my memories that there were -- yes, surely there were\ntoilets, because there were toilet rumors. We went in the toilet and we heard rumor that the -- the\nwagons are from Slovakia here, they came to pick up us, and so on, so -- there were toil -- there\nwere toilets, there is wasser -- water [indecipherable] more. We were not gas -- there were gas\nchambers, which I saw after when I went, after the war, two or three ga -- not gas chambers but\ncrematorium. Were no gas chambers, at least we didn\u2019t know about the gas chambers. We\nworked very hard. The same food, but it was easier.",
        "Q: It was easier than in Birkenau.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it was easier.",
        "Q: So Birkenau becomes a shock. There is no running water, right?",
        "A: No run -- only in the sauna. In the sauna they used for us and we went for delousing, get\ndelousing. And that time [indecipherable] the delousing we went to a -- to a real sauna where\nthey used hot bricks, hot bricks and they pour water on it, so it was a steam, so we went in the\nsteam. And there were showers in the sauna, in the same building, yes. It was -- but outside was -\n- it was not -- it wasn\u2019t a toilet, was a latrine, yeah. And we had to go far up.",
        "Q: Right. It\u2019s a -- a room with just lots of holes in it, right?",
        "A: Not holes.",
        "Q: Holes?",
        "A: The hole was open.",
        "Q: Ah, period, completely open.",
        "A: Open, and there was like a bench, and we had to -- we went on the bench, and -- and we lean\nto there, and -- and we hold it on. It was also -- they had also -- it was on one side up the hill, and\ndown there were toilets, but a German haftlings, for the German prisoners. The Germans. They\nhad -- had toilet, but not a toilet like that. Was something also like a latrine, something like that,\nthat was a clean one and so for the Germans.

So we used to say they take somebody.\nAnd like these my friend, these -- who had insulin in -- in this one, the purse, in -- in the suitcase,\nI didn\u2019t see her more, that means they were taken. And also up the stairs was a little like a loft, a\nlittle room, and some family was looking out through the window, they didn\u2019t go to zaehlappell\nand they loo -- used to smile at us, you know, they were so happy that they are there. They didn\u2019t\ngo to -- but they disappeared also. So they -- probably with these black car, they took people out.\nAn-And we used to hear or say that they\u2019re in the forest with this white uniform, was where that\nflame, we say that they take there, the people to burn.",

        "A: I -- I knew that I cannot make it more. I was so tired, an-and hungry, and everything, and\nwhen I will go on like this, next selection I am going, they will take me, I cannot take it more. So\nI took a risk and I stayed in the barrack, in the block, I didn\u2019t go to work. And I knew that I take\na risk because when -- sometimes, once in awhile the SS, somebody from the SS came through,\nthey went through the barrack, the blocks. And when they found somebody who didn\u2019t go to\nwork, they took to block 25. And I took this risk. I said, I cannot. I have to take risk that they will\ncome today and they will take me to block 25. I cannot walk, first, then I was lying there on the -\n- on the bunk, and the -- for lunchtime -- for lunchtime I went to the kitchen to -- to carry this\nfood, that I helped them [indecipherable] and I was lying there. And a girl came the afternoon,\nand she said, in the lager, they are selecting for a new commando. So I went there, she said\nexactly where. And that was the place where the -- we saw that there\u2019s a new commando, it was\ncalled [indecipherable] a new uniform, stripe. In the morning I lined up and I went to\n[indecipherable] this one. And I was not safe, I was happy. Had good work, yeah. I stayed there\nfor -- for October, ma-maybe through summer or so, \u00b043. Yeah.",
        "Q: 1943.",
        "A: Yeah. If I didn't take this risk, I collapsed, I couldn\u2019t move.",

        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: And this was where you were sorting clothes?",
        "A: Yeah, because there was [indecipherable], in -- in Birkenau was a commando sc -- which they\nwore red scarves, so they were red scarves and that was the Canada called. So they were the red\nscarves and we were the white scarves.",
        "Q: So what was the difference between the work that you were doing sorting clothes and the\nwork that Canada commando was doing sorting clothes, do you know?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t say exactly. I think that we had from the gas chamber, things in the gas chamber,\nand people arrived straight there. And those I don\u2019t know. We had that. Maybe they had also\nfrom the gas chamber, but it was so much that they divided there, [indecipherable] that.",
        "Q: And -- and your commando wasn\u2019t connected with Canada commando?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No, it was totally separate.",
        "A: Yeah, only when -- when the commando was closed, then we were transferred or suggested to\ngo there --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- yeah, to Canada.",
        "Q: Did you like working in that commando?",
        "A: In Canada, no.",
        "Q: No, no, the other one [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And wh-why did you like that and you didn\u2019t like the Canada?",
        "A: It was so relaxing there, relaxing. We relaxing in [indecipherable]. The commander, the SS,\nScharfuehrer, was very nice, a nice man. He was very helpful when it was longer -- for longer at\nzaehlappell, yes, roll call, and during that time was sometimes a selection after this roll call, so --\nor when the commanders arrived, then he kept us longer there to work. We didn't work, but he\nkept us longer and he phoned into the lager that we are very busy, that we have to stay longer,\nand so probably he saved many people.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And we had to cross only from one -- from one ba -- not barrack, from one part to the other\npart through a big door, so we -- we avoided the main door also, by coming home and selection\nwe avoided. And then when it was -- it was typhus epidemic there, so he let many girls to sit on,\nand not to work. And he asked for tea, for enough tea to drink. So he carried in a lot of tea we\nshould have enough, fever -- feverish and who couldn\u2019t work, didn\u2019t have to work. He was a ma\n-- ma -- nice man. That was very important. And the other one, maybe he was also nice, but I\ndidn\u2019t like him, he was so noisy. During the first lunch when I was there -- during lunch, as we\nate, he said lie down all of you. We had to put the food down an-and to lie down in the mud. And\nthen when -- after work, the girls -- not always, I wasn\u2019t there for a -- for a few days, but\nsometimes we had to undress and so he looked through ours if we didn\u2019t take something. He was\nso s -- crazy. Didn\u2019t like it.",
        "Q: Do you remember the name of this nice man [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, I think it Ambrose.",
        "Q: Ambrose.",
        "A: I think that Ambrose was his name, I think so. Or something similar, because we called him\nScharfuehrer.",
        "Q: Right. Were you surprised that there would be somebody who was so nice 1n that position?\nIt\u2019s an odd position to be in and then --",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t surprised, I was pleased.",
        "Q: Mm. So how did it happen that you moved from this commando? It was closed?",
        "A: It was closed. He -- it was closed, but in the meantime he wasn\u2019t more there, the other one,\nsomebody else came. I don\u2019t know what -- sometimes they placed to other places. Maybe he was\ntoo nice, I don\u2019t know, but -- what the reason.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: And the other one, he wasn\u2019t for long there, but he suggested me there for, because one day\nhe came and he asked, who knows the difference between pure silk and artificial material. I say, I\nknow it, cause I learned at school. So then I was, from the bundles I had to find a pure silk\nlingerie to take out and to bundle it differently. So he knew that I am not stupid.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I was -- I was quiet, but I knew things. And then the other one, the new one from Canada\nasked, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d And I didn\u2019t answer [indecipherable] say -- so he said, \u201cHow is she\n-- how is she smart, she doesn\u2019t know how to talk even.\u201d And he said, \u201cYes, she knows how to\ntalk.\u201d So he took me. But I didn\u2019t like him, you know, it was -- for -- for a Auschwitz, wasn\u2019t the\nattitude, not the -- the girls they were used to him, so they laughed, they joked with him.",
        "Q: Yeah [indecipherable] but you didn\u2019t --",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t, no. Didn\u2019t want to.",
        "Q: Were these commandos protected commandos, there were no selections?",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "Q: There were selections?",
        "A: Were selection. They came also later from Canada. They came also later, so sometimes they\navoided selections. But this one [indecipherable] be avoided. Once happened that in the morning\none girl didn\u2019t arrive, and somebody told him. He was -- she was selected in the afternoon, or in\nthe morning. So he t-took his bike and he went there, and then in -- he returned, he said that he\ntold them that she\u2019s the best worker in his commando, when they will not return her, then she has\nto -- he has to close the commando, so then he brought her back.",
        "Q: And he brought her back.",
        "A: Yeah, he was a -- a really -- a good man.",
        "Q: But were there selections inside the commando?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Only from the barrack\u2019?",

        "A: Zaehlappell, or when they arrived --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- when we arrived from work or so.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Or that time when I met this Dieter Rishter, and we\u2019re standing the whole Sunday, after, when\nwe came into the lager, there was a ditch, a ditch. So we had to jump through the ditch. And who\ndidn\u2019t make it, went to chamber.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you had to jump over the ditch?",
        "A: Yeah, through, through.",

        "Q: And if someone fell --",
        "A: I-I wasn\u2019t there, but --",
        "Q: That\u2019s what you were told?",
        "A: -- the back -- they said from the front that who cannot jump over, they take you away because\n[indecipherable] standing there, but it was before.",
        "Q: So when you went to the Canada commando, you didn't stay for very long.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: How long?",
        "A: Few days, and I wer --",
        "Q: A few days?",
        "A: -- no, for a few days, for a few -- and then I went to Ausenkommando.",
        "Q: And that was less difficult for you. You liked that better, being outside [indecipherable]",
        "A: I decided. I decided I go rather to Ausenkommando, what will happen will happen. And then,\nfrom that, what I -- it was a good decision because I would have stayed in Canada. But from\nAusenkommando -- Ausenkommando I took a [indecipherable] a risk. Say that\u2019s enough, now I\nhave to do something else. So -- and then I became a Laeuferin.",
        "Q: And how did that happen? Can you explain?",
        "A: Yeah. That was risky. There was -- was a Rapportfuehrer, an SS, his name was Hans Tauber,\nAustrian. He was very bad, he was very bad. Always on the back and he was hitting. He had\nalways something in his boot, here, some -- some -- I don\u2019t know, [indecipherable] or what. He\nwas hitting --",
        "Q: A whip? Yes?",
        "A: -- he -- every pers -- yes, he was hitting, and he was selecting, he was everything bad. The\nboth men in the la -- the both -- both men in the lager. And I heard that they will open the other\nentrance, other entrance to the lager from the outside, entrance [indecipherable] and that they\nwill need Laeuferins, you know Laeuferin? Well, it\u2019s like they send, run here, run here, there\u2019s a\nLaeuferin come, go to the other door [indecipherable] go to this barrack, to this block and so --\nso they needed, I heard that. So I decided -- decided, I says, I will talk to Tauber, the worst. And\nafter the appell, after that zaehlappell, I was on the road, on the sidewalk and he went on his\nbike, this strong Tauber. And I stopped him from the bike, and I said, Herr Rapportfuehrer,\nhaftling [speaks German here]. Mr. Rapportfuehrer -- you will understand, yes, that want to talk -\n- talk to you. So he went down from the bike, and was standing looking at me. And I said, I am\nhere from the very beginning -- it was true. I didn\u2019t say it between I was a [indecipherable]\nbeginning, and I am -- I worked in Ausenkommando. And I know that you are the only one who\ncan help me. I heard that you need Laeuferin, other Laeuferin. I would like to be a Laeuferin.\nAnd he said, \u201cGo to Katya,\u201d she was the -- the -- the main registrar. Yeah, the Schreibstuber,\nKatya Singer. \u201cGo to her and say that I send you that she should place you in a other block where\nthe Laeuferins are.\u201d So, thanks a lot. And I let -- ran to Katya Singer, and I said, Tauber send me.\nShe said, I need a -- a written note from Tauber. Couldn\u2019t do anything else. Next day -- morning,\nI went to Ausenkommando again, and then in the evening when it was zaehlappell, he came to\nthe block, and he was choosing the other girl for Laeuferin. So I went out to him, and I said,\n\u201cHerr |-lager -- Herr Rapportfuehrer, I spoke to you yesterday and I went to Katya Singer, and\nshe said that she wants -- she needs from you a note, a written note.\u201d She didn\u2019t say -- he didn\u2019t\nsay anything, he said to the -- turned to the blockalteste and said, \u201cTake her also to Katya, take\nboth to Katya.\u201d So she took us to Katya, and I became Laeuferin. And then I was safe, I didn\u2019t go\nto selections, and I had a bed for myself, I had a nice block. Became an [indecipherable]",

        "A: Yes. No. I felt safe. I felt safe, but still I didn\u2019t think so far, because as I said at the beginning,\nI was afraid, or I -- I thought that the last day they will kill us all, they will throw a bomb, or -- or\nI don\u2019t know how [indecipherable] what way --",

        "A: Yes. [indecipherable]. We were standing at the entrance, and in front of us, like you -- no,\nfurther, let\u2019s say, opened the wagons, cattle wagons and stepped out people from there, and they\nwere hurrying like [indecipherable], and they holding tight to their belongings. They were\nholding tight to their families, and they were hungry and they were thirsty and it was hot. Nearly,\nwhen they -- when the Hungarian came, this was the 16\"\" of May, hot. They didn\u2019t have enough\nair, they\u2019re smelling an-and shiny. Water was -- was running from the [indecipherable] that\nreligious men were in these black caftans with beards and with hats. And two of them came to\nus, we were two at the entrance and said in Yiddish, that you are Jewish children, give to us\nwater. They left everybody and they came to us. What could we have done? I went to the Ausen,\nand she was -- her name was Grese, Ausen Grese, a beautiful lady -- girl, a little bit crazy, but\nshe wasn\u2019t so mean. I went, I said -- and I had to report why they came to us, yes, was\ndangerous. So I said, these two men came and they ask for water. What can we do? We didn\u2019t\nhave even water. She said, don\u2019t bother with them, because it could happen that they will take\nyou also with them. So we were standing, looking at them, and didn\u2019t say even anything. It was\nvery sad, very sad to see so many people. And they had to leave their belongings, they had to\nleave the families because the SS said line up, line up. They were their prisoners also in these\nuniforms. They had to help with the belongings, their suitcases. But they ran all over among\nthem, among the newcomers and they said -- they suggested, mothers with children, give over\nthe children to the grandmothers. Men, you say that you are younger. Boys, when you are told,\nyou say that you are older. When they ask you about your profession, you say that you have a\ntrade in -- not in German I don\u2019t know [indecipherable] they could understand each other. And\nthe SS, they yelled los, los, and line up. So suddenly in five minutes they didn\u2019t have their\nbelongings, they didn\u2019t have their families. Some mothers, they give over to their grandmothers,\nsome kept them. They had to line up again, men to me -- with men, women with women. Women\n-- mothers hold the children, and then came the doctor, and selected with one finger. He didn\u2019t\nbother too much, he didn\u2019t think too much. And so they came with a little wand, they took the\nsick ones first, yes, and then they took them. They didn\u2019t know what happened to them. It was so\nsudden that they didn\u2019t know what happened to them. And they were carried away. And some of\nthem then came to the lager, but not right away, not right away, they took them some\n[indecipherable] place and then they came into. And in a short time you saw the flames. So that\nwas very often a st -- we were so close, the crematory wasn\u2019t far from the entrance. So often was\nthere a strong smell of burned flesh and burned bones, very often, more often than not, from the\nburning people. Was very sad. They came, they came, it was time and they came and came.\nNever stopped. Was time and for weeks nobody came, maybe for a month, I don\u2019t know, don\u2019t\nremember. It was really when the Hungarian came, very often.",

        "Q: Now were you also standing when they took the family camp, the Theresienstadt camp out to\nbe gassed, were you there? Am I wrong, or --",
        "A: No. The -- it was during the evening, or -- late evening, summertime. Nobody was there,\nnobody was at the lager, nobody. Somebody came only from the office and told me, you have to\nstand between that -- not in the front. The -- the Theresien lager was cross the street from -- from\nBirkenau [indecipherable] lager. But between the A and B lager was a door, yes. Nobody was\nthere, and from the -- as I said, from the office they -- somebody came, I don\u2019t remember who,\nand said, you will stand today between A and B lager, that is your post in the evening. I didn't\nknow the reason why I will stand there, so I went. I would have gone also [indecipherable] cause\nI had to when they send me. They\u2019re sending -- standing, and as I said, nobody was in the lager,\nit was not permitted, because the guards stay there on the towers, and suddenly I heard a cry, and\n-- and -- and -- and running around, and so -- and that was the time when they took the people\nfrom Terezin lager, or the family lager it was called. Because it was like that that this famil --\nthose families from Theresienstadt, they were together, and that was called family lager. And\nlater on only when I am here, so I read somewhere that it was written on the -- on the wagons,\nSB, Sonder Behandlung, and that meant -- that what they write in the book, that meant that six --\nfor six months, or -- I think six months, they had to stay there as a family, and then they sent\nthem. And that time, that evening, or that night when I was late night there, they -- in the\nmorning I heard -- in the morning somebody said that they put them on -- on the -- on tracks, on\ntracks they put them, on car -- on tracks, they took them to the city of Auschwitz, and they\ncarried them the whole night all over, to -- to -- to mix them up, that they don\u2019t know where they\nare going, and then they put them in the warehouse, or somewhere into a place, I don\u2019t know, I\nwasn\u2019t there, and then they gassed them there, in some warehouse, or somewhere, a place. That\nwas -- I wasn\u2019t there --",
        "Q: Not in Auschwitz, that\u2019s the pl --",
        "A: In Auschwitz, but outside of the -- not in the gas chamber. Outside of Auschwitz that time.\nOther times I don\u2019t know, because they gassed them other times also. And then in the morning,\nor the next day I heard that in one barrack they found a place where a teacher was there, and he\nwrote down everything what happened in the lager that night. That what I know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- people said, I wasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t there. I was standing between the two barracks, between two lagers, which didn\u2019t\nhave anything to do with Theresienstadt, only the noise. Maybe that nobody should be outside,\nbut there were the guards. That I know about Theresiens --",
        "Q: But being outside and watching that must have been very upsetting.",

        "Q: Tell me about it",
        "A: It\u2019s the nicest thing maybe there, only one nice thing in lager, what I -- what I experienced,\nAlma Ros\u00e9. She came at the beginning sometimes when I was Laeuferin, and I c -- became\nLaeuferin, it was still warm. [indecipherable] remember -- I remember her dress, it was satin,\nblack dress with polka dots. Pale --",
        "Q: With polka dots?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",

And she\nwas a real big musician, because they played together with her father in Vienna, Austria. She\nmarried through Holland, so they b -- they s -- brought her from Holland, yes. She mentioned\nthat sh -- her second husband was a Czech, because I said I am Czechoslovakian. And so -- so --\nso they took her from this experimental block, and they brought her to Birkenau, and they made\nher as a [indecipherable] after [indecipherable] maybe. So she was playing with them. She had\nsuch a small stick, a thin stick play, and she used to complain that her stick 1s too heavy for her,\nand we used to laugh that this is heavy for Alma Ros\u00e9, and we use all equipment, we have to\nwork and so -- so -- and she played beautiful. For Sundays sometimes, or more often, I don\u2019t\nremember if every Sunday, she played by herself. I-I was young, and I-I didn\u2019t go to these big\nplaces and so -- but I couldn\u2019t imagine something nicer than she -- when she play -- when she\nplay, and there came also high rank officers were standing around and playing -- and listening.",

        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So when -- when they went to work, to the orchestra played these march songs, and march\nmusic, they should -- they should march in-in military steps, yes. And we had to lead them by --\nshall I tell you how?",

        "Q: So they had to march in unison, together?",
        "A: Together yes, in lines, and she played with her orchestra. We had to tell them how to mar --\nhow to start and so on and so. And when they came and returned from work, they had to march\nalso by we -- without orchestra when they return, I think without. We had to lead them, but\nsometimes we didn\u2019t, when nobody was there from the SS. [indecipherable] She was ha -- she\nwas a musician, oh mine God, never her [indecipherable] yeah and then she died. It was April the\nfourth, I remember. I remember it from -- from reading. April the fourth, 1944, when we heard\nAlma Ros\u00e9 die. She was invited to a party and they said that she was poisoned there.

I don\u2019t know about Koshitzer, I was in\nKoshitzer, I never asked about her, but I\u2019m sure that [indecipherable] was healthy, and I don\u2019t\nknow about this Hungarian lady, I don\u2019t know. But three I know.",
        "Q: So tell me the story about Vera Isen.",
        "A: I told you, no? With my father, aha happen, what happened.",
        "Q: No, you didn\u2019t. What happened, yeah.",
        "A: I came to the -- came to the barrack and they were sending a nice looking girl, young, maybe\n20 or so. I said -- and I knew that she\u2019s not from the barrack, because I would know her. I said,\n\u201cWhat are you -- are you looking for somebody?\u201d She said \u201cYes, I am looking for Aliska Roth,\u201d\nor for -- yeah. So I said, \u201cWhy are you looking for Aliska Roth?\u201d She said, \u201cBecause she\u2019s my\ncousin.\u201d I said, \u201cYour cousin, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Vera Isen. I said, \u201cOh, so what\u2019s the\nproblem?\u201d I didn\u2019t say anything to her, what\u2019s the problem [indecipherable] wasn\u2019t interest to\ntalk too much. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Said, \u201cI am on 20 -- on block 25.\u201d So I said -- I\ndidn\u2019t ask why, I didn\u2019t know why she\u2019s there. I said [indecipherable] afternoon, I cannot do\nanything, I will try tomorrow to do something. Come with me, I go with you to 25. Since I was --\nbefore Laeuferin, I was Schreiberin, so I -- people knew me, so I had some position. So I went\nthere, there was a Slovak lady, older than -- she was a mother of a girl [indecipherable]. I said\n[indecipherable] didn\u2019t ask who we are, what -- what [indecipherable], no, nothing nothing. I\nsaid, \u201c\u201cNow this is my cousin and she\u2019s here in your block.\u201d It was impossible to take out from\nthere. \u201cShe\u2019s in this block, I want to help her, but today is no time because late. So I-I -- I will\ncome tomorrow, so please hide her,\u201d and I looked up there where the dished, and some storage. I\nsaid, \u201cIf something would happen during the night, place her there, send her there, she should\nhide there. In the morning I will be here.\u201d She said okay. And I am wondering how she could do\nthat, because she had her on the list, yeah. She says okay. So -- and I went in the morning there. I\nsaid, I came for my cousin. She says okay, so I took her. I took my cousin and I went with her to\nthe sauna, because I knew that that time they were sending the haftlings to -- to Germany to\nwork, you know, Philips and so on and so. They went there. And there was an SS,\n[indecipherable] and these SS people they knew me, because I was standing there. Her name was\nZiatz, and I knew she\u2019s a simple woman, older woman, in her 40\u2019s, somehow, I never heard her\nvoice, she must be a nice woman. So I went to her and I said [indecipherable], I said this is my\ncousin, look how beautiful she is, she is nicer looking than I am, I gave her some\n[indecipherable]. And she\u2019s in -- the problem with -- with her that she\u2019s in block 25. She has to\ngo to the gas chamber. And she can go as a nice looking girl, then I can go also. I am not so nice\nlooking than her. Please help me. Send her away with the -- with these people to Germany to\nwork. And she looked, and she said, leave her here. And I left her there, and I believed her, this\n[indecipherable] I left her there. And that\u2019s it. And I had the feeling, that\u2019s a good feeling, the\ngirl is safe. After the wer -- war, when I came to PreSov, I met a girl from Hungary, from there,\nand we were so [indecipherable] saw me, knew the name. She said, I was in [indecipherable]\nwith the -- they had a -- a grape garden. So I met there Vera Isen, and she said you should come\nthere to pick up grapes. So I said, well I don\u2019t know. But I knew that I will not go, I wasn\u2019t the\nmood to travel with grapes, forget about it. And then I said, are you go back, tell her that I thank,\nthat I\u2019m here and I thank, and -- but I will not be here, I will be in Humenn\u00e9, I go to my uncle. So\nthen I received from her a letter. I\u2019m not sure if I wrote her or she wrote me, that I don\u2019t know.\n[indecipherable] was a little place, Humenn\u00e9 was also a little place, was enough to know the\nname, okay, [indecipherable]. So I received a letter that she\u2019s with her brother there and they\nwant to go to the States, to New York. But that time wasn\u2019t permitted from Hungary to write to\nNew York, wasn\u2019t permitted somehow connection [indecipherable] I should write -- she wrote\nme the address to New York, I should wr-write in Hungarian [indecipherable]. So I wrote there,\nand that\u2019s it. I never heard about her, never, never, never. After years and years my cousin from\nKoshitza, from Slovakia wrote to me that she -- she received a letter from Israel -- from Israel\nfrom my other cousin, that this cousin from Israel was in New York to visit a other cousin and\nthat Vera wi -- Vera Isen was there and she\u2019s in this book about Auschwitz, and she said the\nstory that the -- she was select -- she was selected to -- for -- for Germany to work, and I didn\u2019t\nknow that time that she had a sister and she had a mother there. And the other blockalteste came\nthere, and managed -- because she was the last one, that they took her out from the line, and she\nput her sister or her cousin or somebody, this blockalte -- somebody instead her, and they took\nher from there to block 25, ye -- and that I took her out, and -- and so -- and sh -- and this cousin\nfrom Israel said that she wanted my [indecipherable] wanted my address where I live now, to tell\nme that she\u2019s alive. So I wrote to her, but she didn\u2019t write for a long time. So I said, when she\ndoesn\u2019t write, ask from Israel her address. [indecipherable] I -- I never said to her -- she doesn\u2019t\nknow the story of my father, that my father had her -- I don\u2019t know what -- what kind of reli --\nrelative was his mother and so -- so as was -- so a few -- then she in -- then she invited me to\nFlorida, I should come, I knew that I will not go. I said maybe. And then she called I shouldn\u2019t\ngo for January because her children are there, sh -- I should come for February. And I said, I will\ngo rather to -- to New York. Then I had my hip operation, I said [indecipherable] called me, I\nsaid I -- I cannot go because I have a hip operation. Then she called me again, I said I want to go\nto -- to Washington first, and I will come from Washington, maybe I will come to visit you. I\nnever went and she never called or never --",
        "Q: So you\u2019ve never seen her since that day?",
        "A: No, I saw her only once. But then I wrote to the [indecipherable] my new cousin, my new\ncousin.",
        "Q: Right, right. Did you tell her when you brought her to -- to the sauna, did you say I am your\ncousin, or you never told her?",

        "A: Yeah, I had other times also when I saved.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: So -- but how I understand myself, after many years -- and I was happy that I could help.\nAfter many years I sometimes ask was it worthwhile. Who cares, nobody cares. If it 1s\nworthwhile to be a [indecipherable]. Then but sometimes maybe. Nobody said ever, thanks.",
        "Q: Nobody?",
        "A: Nobody. Nobody. So they were thankful it\u2019s -- my aunt and the other lady, but I don\u2019t know if\nit is worthwhile to risk your life, as I risked my life. I risked also [indecipherable] Polish -- I\nwrote it, Polish women. They wanted to take them to Visla to [indecipherable]. I mean, the SS\ncame and he said where are -- I had to line up. It was a rec -- convalescent barrack where they\ndidn\u2019t go to work, they stayed there. And he came, where are they. Polish women. I said, we\ndon\u2019t have here Polish women. He left, but I had statistics, I had -- I wrote every day stat -- and\nthey would say, show me your statistics. I finished [indecipherable]. He turned and he left.",
        "Q: And you had just faked everything?",

Yes. Give me a\nsmile. It was always my reaction. Yeah, it was very risky. Once somebody saw me from the\nsauna, was also a -- some relative that I knew her before. And I went to the Schreiberin that time,\nI said, take her a -- take out her name, yeah. She said, find me a razor -- an eraser. So I went all\nover, I found the eraser, so she wrote through and erased, it should be so mixed up that she made\nthe mistake. When I took her out, was evening. Then one Polish lady who was then my\nblockalteste when I was Schreiberin with her in the last barrack. She came to -- now you stole\nthis girl, you took her out from the -- I said no, no, I didn\u2019t. She said yes, I saw you.

And nationalities, how many those, those, those, those, those, according, a list\nhas to be put together, and to take to the Schriebstuber. Then we had a reconvalescent lag --\nblock. That meant some people, they -- which they were sick and they were not sent to the gas\nchamber, let\u2019s see, the non-Jews, they were not sent to the gas chamber, yes. You are sick, you\nwent to the Revere, to the [indecipherable]. And then they send them for a few day -- let\u2019s say\nfor three days or four or five, six days or [indecipherable] mostly to a reconvalescent block. And\nthen you had to place them from the reconvalescent block according to regulations, back. And\nback from there they came, yes. So, when we had to send them back, we had to go to the same\nroute as who was there when Mala -- was Mala, who me she slapped, for permission -- he had to\nsign that go to place, and so on. But again, I didn\u2019t place back. [indecipherable] I knew when I\nwas Laeuferin, he was there in this -- that was his office. So I used to go to him, I said, Herr -- it\nwas the Arbeitsfuehrer, something like that, please sign me, sign me this. And he used -- used to\nsmile, so -- he didn\u2019t look at me, only smiled, and signed, didn\u2019t say anything. And I sent to the -\n- to the sewing room, sewing, because there we were exchange for young -- for older people\nfrom Auschwitz. But the -- here was older people, so mainly older people came. So sent them\nthere, or I kept them longer or so -- so we had to be in [indecipherable] maybe he didn\u2019t know,\nmaybe he smiled only like, I don\u2019t know, I never ask him why he smiles, I didn\u2019t care, he sign.\nSo we had to be in connection with this -- this Arbeitskommandant. We had to go to the\nSchreibstuber, and the Zaehlappell had to be correct, yes, so that was -- now, and beside that, we\nhelp, from -- we order, and so food came, too. Sliced bread to -- and the portions of soup -- the\nstoup beans the -- the stew beans, they gave them food, but bread to prepare every evening again,\nso I would work around, there were many people in there. I don\u2019t know how many hundreds of\npeople sometimes in a block.",

        "A: That was when we left -- when we left A barrack, the A lager, and we left A lager when I said\nthat we s -- we were there -- left -- we were there, only few girls yes, and I was scared, but we\u2019ll\nhave [indecipherable] to die, I was scared --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and so on, and so what will. So one day came an SS, and he took us to a other lager, to\nanother lager, only by foot, it was close, yeah. And I came to this blockalteste, who saw me that\nevening that I took somebody from this road that was outside there, standing, here they were\nstanding, and then -- but that\u2019s interesting, that this girl became a woman, and she committed in\nIsrael suicide. Whom I took from the sauna, you know it?",
        "Q: Yes, that one you took from the sauna?",
        "A: Which I -- the -- the other --",
        "Q: Yes.",

She came to New York, she divorced her\nhusband, left her son with her husband, went to -- to Israel, married again, and then she\ncommitted the suicide. Destiny, yeah. So the question was, this drunk SS.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. So from there we went to the other and this blockalteste who saw me to steal her\n[indecipherable] I came there, and she said that she wanted a -- I wrote it there -- somebody as a\nPolish, a Polish woman, as a Schreiberin, but the other one, who worked with Katya\n[indecipherable] means miss, misses, yeah. She told me, the blockalte -- probably not\n[indecipherable] that I have to take -- she didn\u2019t know me, I didn\u2019t know her, we saw each other\nonly this evening, yeah. She said that Aliska has to be her Schreiberin, because when Aliska was\ngood to -- to save the Polish women, you know, from the Visla that she sent to the latrine, go to\nthe latrine, then she\u2019s got to be Schreiberin here. So I became the Schreiberin there, and it was\nthe a-assistant blockalteste a Polish woman, a other one, they were sitting together, two Polish\nwomen. And I was with them, the Schreiber. It was -- I think it was late -- yeah, in October we\ncame there, I think maybe in October, could have been winter or -- or so, 1t was cold, I know it --\nwe didn\u2019t have a calendar there. I didn\u2019t know the date, I didn\u2019t know the day. Sunday we knew\nbecause we didn\u2019t go to work. So, open the door and an SS man came into [indecipherable]\nroom, because blockalteste, Schreiberin and assistant, we had a little room, yeah. So we were\nsitting that time there, and this drunk SS came in, took off his hat, put on a chair and said -- put --\ntook off the gun, put on the chair and sit there and said, I will stay here with you, and I will -- I\nwill sleep here on the floor with you, or I will go into the barrack and I will sleep on the bunk,\nthe bunk [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t leave from here, I will stay with you here. An SS. And this\nother -- the -- the assistant -- the assistant blockalteste, she was so strict to him, she started to spit\non his head, and so -- and then he said -- but he was very, very drunk, and he said, I don\u2019t want\nto live. And there -- therefore, I don\u2019t want to go from here, I -- therefore, I want to stay here,\nbecause I am not worthwhile to live. I killed so many girls from Holland, Dutch girls. They were\nso beautiful, and I went up the gas chamber, and I threw inside Zyklon B, Zyklon B, and I threw\nand I killed them, and they were so beautiful, and therefore I don\u2019t want to live. Now we were\nscared. A drunk SS and talk like that, and she spitting on his head. That was tragic, yeah? So it --\nwhat to do? So I didn\u2019t say anything, and I left. I left them, and I went at the end of the lager was\na office for the SS men. They stayed always there, I saw them to go into there, yeah. Never had\nanything to do with them. I saw them there. So I went into that office, to the SS office, and I said,\nwe have in our block an SS who is drunk, and he has a gun, and we are scared of his gun, and of\nhis -- could you please come to pick him up? I didn\u2019t say what he said, only that. And one of -- I\ndon\u2019t know, there were two or three there, I don\u2019t remember. Maybe I didn\u2019t notice, even. So he\ngot up and he followed me again, came into our little room, took him, didn\u2019t say anything -- he\nwas scared when he saw him. He took him, and -- he took him.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "A: The gun as well. This SS had also. Was dangerous, dangerous.",
        "Q: Dangerous, but -- but interesting that -- that any of them would have that response, and come\nto you.",
        "A: Yes. N -- to me accidentally to --",
        "Q: I mean, no, no, I know that, but coming to the prisoners --",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Really hard, because she stated was my name, that means my responsibility. Was easy to -- to\nget slapping. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: What did that -- what did that -- did that do something to you as a human being, to be\nslapped? It must have been --",
        "A: Yeah, humiliation for sure.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: How come? [indecipherable] I said no and it is, and I didn\u2019t say anything else. Humiliation.",
        "Q: Right. Okay.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t more, no.",
        "Q: When someone says the word Auschwitz to you, what\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind?",
        "A: I don\u2019t like to hear about it.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t like to hear about it.",
        "A: No, no, whey they talk about it at home, or somebody, I say, please stop it. No, I don\u2019t like\nthat. Or very rarely I will say something, you know.",
        "Q: So do you -- do you have a lot of friends who were from Auschwitz, a lot of people you\nknow, or you -- you don\u2019t?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: And so that you don\u2019t -- over the years you haven\u2019t talked about this very much?",
        "A: Not too much, but I meet people which they were there, or they -- they lost their families and\nso they were yes. No I -- I would say the contrary. When Jewish people meet, they come always\nto this the end. They always end up with this lagers, with whom they lost and so forth.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. The -- they mention, remember him, him, him, my friend, this, this. So most of the time\nthey end -- or we end up with Auschwitz, or with -- with lagers, you know, I cannot. And my onk\n-- others which I met here, which I know here, new friends, or n-new acquaintances, I don\u2019t talk,\nI don\u2019t bring up this thing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But most of the time, or almost always, when people which --which they were friends before\nwe had -- which had the same friends and so -- so they end up or we end up to talk about it. No,\nit\u2019s a -- something what we never miss when we are among our people which they grew up in the\nsame city as it. We have a friend with my husband, we are every Sunday together, besides the\nother one who doesn\u2019t know, but he is somehow a little bit mixing up maybe. He said\n[indecipherable] why do you go to -- to Washington? He said, oh they called her from museum.\nAnd then I started to talk about something else.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. But when it is somebody from our group whom we knew, we almost always end up\nabout Auschwitz. And my thinking, my feeling is sadness, almost, or very often about the lager.",
        "Q: Do you dream about it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t dream directly that I am in lager, but I dream often that I am lost. I go -- I go\nsomewhere, the place where I don\u2019t know, and I\u2019m barefoot and I don\u2019t have money, I don\u2019t\nhave anything, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m only dressed up somehow and I\u2019m lost, I lost everybody, I lost my\nhusband, my -- my son. Nobody\u2019s there and I\u2019m by myself. Always I -- I go somewhere and I\ndon\u2019t know where. Yeah, something like -- I think something [indecipherable]. With my family I\ndon\u2019t dream so often. I was in Auschwitz, I used to dream with my brother. I knew, now I will go\nto bed and I will dream the same. Was still alive that time [indecipherable] thinking about it, and\nyou have no idea. That was my life, that I am with my brother.",
        "Q: With your brother.",
        "A: Yeah, my life. My real life [indecipherable], yes. But I imagine. When I wake up, I have to\nget up because my thinking comes [indecipherable] so I get up, stand up and I should finish. And\nI go out to the kitchen cooking [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right. Okay.\nEnd of Tape Nine\nBeginning Tape 10",
        "Q: -- ing about your brother in Auschwitz, or dreaming --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- as if you were dreaming with him? Is this what you were saying? Explain that to me.",
        "A: I was dreaming that he is there.",
        "Q: That\u2019s he\u2019s there.",
        "A: That he\u2019s there.",
        "Q: Ah, you\u2019re having dreams with your brother in it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes. So when -- did you find out in Auschwitz what had happened to your brother and your\nmother and father, or was it after?",
        "A: No, in Auschwitz -- in Auschwitz, I found out that they left -- that they left --",
        "Q: That they left.",
        "A: -- my family left.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Nothing more, that they left. But when I returned, then I met in a train, one of his friends or --\nor acquaintances who was in the same lager. And he told me in the train, I was with your brother,\nI worked with him in the forest, and he run away when he heard that they take the parent of the\npeople to help them. He said, and then I stayed there, I went again to work there, and somehow I\nmet partisans and the partisans took me with him -- with them, and so I was saved. Was a smaller\nlager ne -- next to Lublin. And that -- that he was hidden. I think that he said that he knew from\nhim, or the lady where he worked, but I don\u2019t know who told me that he was hidden, and he\ncame home when he heard that they took hi -- but he told me this story and it\u2019s a true story.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: That he was -- he worked with him in the forest.",
        "Q: So twice your brother left a place --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- where he might have been saved.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Once when he was hidden and he went to your parents to help them when they were being\ndeported, and then the second time he left the forest to be with them. Do you know where they\nwere sent?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but I imagine that to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: You think to Auschwitz?",
        "A: Because this -- the small lager they sent people to Auschwitz, I think so.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Maybe I was -- I wasn\u2019t standing there, because it was \u201942, and I came through there --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- \u00b043. Probably not [indecipherable] before.",
        "Q: So, you go on the Death March, and you obviously see there are a new set of guards now,\nright? These are not the guards you know.",
        "A: Wehrmacht, Wehrmacht, not SS --",
        "Q: Wehrmacht, uh-huh.",
        "A: Wehrmacht.",
        "Q: Really. So these are all strangers?",
        "A: I saw Wehrmacht. Strangers.",
        "Q: And there\u2019s a lot of shooting, isn\u2019t there?",
        "A: Yes, at the beginning --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- a lot of shooting. I was al -- almost always among them, because I wasn\u2019t enough strong to\nmarch. I had to lean on somebody. We were four girls.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: For me it was the most difficult part.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t -- so they pulled me in.",
        "Q: And so they pulled you.",
        "A: Pulled me.",
        "Q: In some way like you pulled Dieter out of --",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Yeah. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- they kept you going, yes?",
        "A: Yeah. It was there -- Wehrmacht -- Wehrmacht. Not everybody was bad, not everybody. I\ncouldn\u2019t say that everybody was bad. And when they -- it was a order to -- to -- to rest. And --\nrest [indecipherable] and hi -- I had a -- a raincoat, a raincoat, a tin raincoat and it was very cold,\n18\" of January, and my shoes with laces, but they were narrow, they were not enough big. After\nthe war I had an operation, a bunion operation, both of them, because they became so big my --\nsee this line here?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: You had big bunions from those shoes.",
        "A: I think so.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And frozen, too.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I couldn't march. My hip. So when they said [indecipherable] I was lying -- I always lied\ndown in this -- my raincoat in the snow, others also, but I always, see? And this SS, he was, I\nknow from where, he was from Dusseldorf, Dooler, what Dooler? It will come to my name -- my\nmemory, Willie Dooler from Dusseldorf, and -- a Wehrmacht, and he said get up, get up. I said\nno, I am so tired. He said, you will get a cold. I said, I don\u2019t care. I really didn\u2019t care, I so tired.\n[indecipherable] get up, get up, because when you will stay in the back they will shoot you. So\nsomehow I managed. And so he was really often beside or behind us and he said go, go, go, go,\nso we went. He found us all the place to sleep, because some of them, or most of them, they slept\nin a barn, and he\u2019s -- he found us a place to sleep in a house. Was a woman there, a Polish\nwoman. He asked her to cook -- prepare us supper. She made us potatoes and ham -- and ham?\nHam, yeah, potatoes and ham. And after so many years, we --we slept in a bed.",
        "Q: On the Death March?",
        "A: On the Death March, during the night. The other was in a barn. And I told him I want -- he --\nI loved his approach yes, I saw that he\u2019s so earnest. I said, I want to stay here, I want to hide. He\nsaid, if you want to, hide, but you take a risk because could happen that the Germans will -- will\nburn the village and you will burn with them. If you want I will give you bread. You can stay,\nbut rather go on. It\u2019s a risk to stay. So we went on and on, like him -- with him. And between\nthere -- between this time, they -- they were shooting people [indecipherable] the most sad part\nwhich I saw was when I saw a woman lying and a ho -- a brain next to her. They shoot her\nthrough the brain. And then a other one when -- a woman, she was Italian, not Jewish, she was\npregnant, and she was in my block where I was Schreiberin so she noticed me from somewhere\non a higher spot, she was standing with somebody. And it made -- she made a impression that\nshe is giving birth. A big stomach and so -- felling down and looking at me [indecipherable] but I\ncouldn\u2019t -- first of all, I couldn\u2019t go out and I wouldn\u2019t risk that I couldn\u2019t do, and then I couldn\u2019t\nwalk myself. It was very sad, this marching. I had these tied shoes, and even th-that time were --\nwere not pantyhoses, only stockings, remember, and girdles, yes?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And my girdle went into my flesh, so this was bleeding, and in -- in my flesh there. The\ngirdle, and my shoes were tied, my -- my raincoat was cold. So we went.",
        "Q: And this was miles --",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: -- that you walked.",
        "A: I walked. Miles.",
        "Q: Miles and miles and miles in very cold January weather.",
        "A: Was very cold [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you have gloves this time?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. It was so difficult that some people managed to have some bread in the\nrucksacks. We had some material, we could -- we made ourselves some rucksacks, and they\nthrew on the -- on the road, see loaves of bread. Because before, the day when we left for this\nmarch, somebody opened the storages, the bread storages and they were stealing bread, so some\nof them, but th-throwing everything, even -- even a little clothing, whatever somebody had,\nthrown. Everything was too heavy, was very bad.",
        "Q: Yes. So how many day -- do you have any idea how many days you marched til you got to the\ntrain that took you to Ravensbriick?",
        "A: Yes, I think that only two days because I remember two nights that we slept on the way, two\nnights, yes.",
        "Q: Did you sleep two -- two nights in some --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So this man arranged on the second [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yes, he arranged the first day, and then the second day he arranged in a house where on the\nfirst floor were sleeping SS -- not SS, soldiers, probably Wehrmacht, they were sleeping there.\nAnd we were upstairs, and he was so nice. We were two Jewish girls and two Christians. One of\n-- probably was Jewish and she said that she is Christian because people said that she 1s Jewish,\nso I don\u2019t know, but re-regularly were two and two. And he was so nice that he said to the two\nChristian girls, Polish girls, to tell us we shouldn\u2019t say that we are Jewish in front of the soldiers\nor the people because that would be bad for us. We -- we wouldn\u2019t say anyhow, yeah. Yeah, he\nhelped us.",
        "Q: Were there people in the Polish population that saw you as you were marching?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Wi -- di -- did people say anything, did anybody give you anything?",
        "A: Yes. It was -- I wrote about it. In one village, I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t know the\nvillages, I didn't know the times. There were a few women standing with buckets full of water\nand with little containers and they -- they passed on. I was on the other side, I didn\u2019t get a water,\nbut on this side, they -- standing, I don\u2019t know, maybe 10 - 12 women, Polish women.",
        "Q: Standing there.",
        "A: And they hand over water, yes, it was very touchy.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, it was waiting --",
        "Q: And the Germans didn\u2019t stop them?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. Maybe -- maybe they were between --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- them. And I don\u2019t remember even it was first day or second day, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Probably first day because we were rushing, and so they could help --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- they helped with water, and that was a big thing, a big thing.",
        "Q: It must have been important as a human being to see it, yes?",
        "A: Very important, very important, even I didn\u2019t get the water, was very important to see that\nsome people are nice, and they were not scared of the Germans, they gave us water.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: See that means water, when you don\u2019t have it --",
        "Q: Yes, it may be more important than food in some ways.",
        "A: Yeah, more important for sure, yeah.",
        "Q: So do you get on a train to go to Ravensbriick?",

        "Q: So you\u2019re still freezing?",
        "A: Yeah. Mm-hm, and in the meantime the men were there already, and probably they were the\nwhole night there on the station, because they threw them ou-out, off the trains, frozen, like\npieces of -- of wood. They take a piece of wood --",
        "Q: And throw it out? [indecipherable]",
        "A: Th -- they were only in a -- in -- in the uniforms, thin, from cotton probably, and a little cap.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s it.",
        "A: No glove, nothing else, no, no.",
        "Q: So a lot of them died? They just threw them --",

        "A: -- threw them down, skinny, yes. Musselmens.",
        "Q: So were the women in better shape than that -- than the men?",
        "A: That time I think that they were --",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: -- because I didn\u2019t see anybody, only what -- who was shot, but I didn\u2019t see anybody through\n-- through them, because we came and we entered the -- the train, the open wagon.",
        "Q: Yeah. Right.",

And they got\nfrozen there on the train, on the train station they got frozen because they arrived there, so they\nwere there. But they couldn\u2019t make it. After we left, we -- we -- the train stopped in Berlin, was\nbombed that time. And the women said that they don\u2019t know about Auschwitz. Girls ask, do you\nknow about a place, Auschwitz, where they burn people? No. But then they took us to different\nplaces, train stopped, and we went further, further, because it was no place. Everything was\nevacuating from -- from pop -- from Poland. So we went, went til we came to Ravensbriick, and\nthere started the other misery.",
        "Q: It was really bad there.",
        "A: Bad because no food, only the second day or third day some food, but we didn\u2019t have\ncontainers. Only our friend Vera Kubario, she had some [indecipherable] containers she brought,\nand she gave us sips to take, we counted the sips. Now you will take five sips, now five, five,\nfive.

        "Q: Bigger sips.",
        "A: Yeah, that was [indecipherable]. We didn\u2019t have place where to sleep, it was a big place. We\nsit down, we didn\u2019t have even to -- to sit where.

        "A: But then we went and we saw everybody\u2019s evacuating, we knew that\u2019s the end.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I must again [indecipherable] to march home, but we were free, we were free.",
        "Q: But it doesn\u2019t end easily, it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re liberated and everything\u2019s fine",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: All of Europe is devastated --",
        "A: No, when you come ho --",
        "Q: -- and families are gone from --",
        "A: Families are gone, you are alone, and you are not the same as the other ones who are fr -- who\nwere free, you are not the same. You don\u2019t understand each other. The values are different. They\ntalk about different things. They are interested about different things. It\u2019s not the same. And to fit\nin into the free world is not so easy. We are not the same. Not the same, because --",
        "Q: Can you explain that more? What were people talking about that you were not talking --",
        "A: It\u2019s not in t -- because it is not interesting to us, but [indecipherable] for important. Not\ninteresting for us, no. They will -- we will try, let\u2019s see, let\u2019s see, now I make it up. Let\u2019s see they\nwill dress up, or -- or they will [indecipherable] something expensive, or I don\u2019t know. So it\u2019s\nnot interesting. We\u2019re alive, so we have to survive and it\u2019s not -- and they don\u2019t take you as -- as\nthe same. They take -- they think that you are different, yeah. They take all -- by myself I feel I\nam different from them now, yeah.",
        "Q: And did people ask you what happened? Did they care?",
        "A: Once we went to -- to a city. I met people on the -- on the way and so and so. We went\nthrough a city, that city was called [indecipherable] and one man from PreSov, I s-saw him on the\nstreet because I had the business on the same street [indecipherable] from me. But I talked to him\nand we went -- I kept with them, with him and with two friend -- two friends? Yeah, and with\ntwo friends. They went three mile and I was with them. And he took us to a house, to his\nrelatives, to his relatives in [indecipherable]. And they gave me a room, and they had the other\nroom. They were nice, they gave me a -- something -- something to wash up and so. And I heard\nhow the woman, Jewish -- Jewish couple, older couple, a woman said to the man, did you hear\nwhat these girls said? They said [indecipherable] or they will be -- and he said, you don\u2019t have to\n-- to listen and to -- to -- to -- to -- listen to -- to believe her everything. You don\u2019t have to\nbelieve her everything, what he said. And then I decided I don\u2019t want to talk more about what\nhappened there. That was very painful. I come to a first house --",
        "Q: And they don\u2019t believe you.",
        "A: They don\u2019t believe me, no.",
        "Q: So, did you stop talking?",
        "A: Not totally, but I didn\u2019t say that I wasn\u2019t no -- nowhere or so, but I didn\u2019t explain, I didn\u2019t\nexplain. Maybe to my uncle, maybe like that. He -- he lost also ev -- some [indecipherable] yeah.\nNo, I -- and since then I sometimes mention it for among people. I don\u2019t want to talk about it\nbecause that time, right away, on the way, he said to her, you don\u2019t have to believe her\neverything what she says. No.",
        "Q: You went back to PreSov, we talked about that in the beginning. And then you went to your\nuncle in Humenne\u00e9.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes. And you met your husband.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You met the person who became your husband, if you will.",
        "A: Yeah he came -- became his boss.",
        "Q: Yes. Why did the two of you decide to stay in Slovakia, or was there no choice, until \u201968?",
        "A: Yeah. It\u2019s a reasonable question. Life was good there. After the war, people were happy. They\nwere not -- we were also to dancing, so still, if also [indecipherable] different who was there, not\neverybody was there, because not everybody returned, yes?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But those who were there, they wanted enjoy life. So life was joyful and even the economy\nwas good, because nothing was there more, so when somebody started business or so, so he\nmade -- he was doing well, or -- or he got a job, or so. Nothing was there, everything was like a\nvacuum in Slovakia. People were missing, so everything had to be built again, so economy was\ngood.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And it was also music, and it was -- here and there somebody returned, so they were happy,\nso they used to say, oh here will be better than in America, so I will stay here, yeah. But then\nslowly, slowly we realized that it\u2019s not the same life than it was, because first of all, we missed\nour families.",
        "Q: I was going to say, it must --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- must have been very difficult to be there.",
        "A: Yes, it was, it was. Well, it\u2019s -- I married. I had the home, yes. I -- I wasn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t have to\nbe hungry. Was a reasonal --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Now, I liked him. We didn\u2019t go out, no -- nothing. He was a [indecipherable] and I was a --\nand suddenly -- I was engaged to somebody. And somebody -- suddenly he asked me if I want to\nmarry him, I said yes. But beside that, yes, beside that he was a -- was a nice boy, quiet boy and\nso, but I was happy that I have a home, yes, have a home, and I have somebody, somebody close.\nI needed somebody to talk. Somebody who would under -- who would be willing to understand.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Who will be willing to listen [indecipherable] so it was not reason to go out. Then later on we\nwanted to go here. My uncle left for America, for New York, and he wanted me to come with\nhim, he wrote to his relatives they should send me an affidavit --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but they didn\u2019t. And -- we have to stop, huh?",
        "Q: No, go ahead.",
        "A: And then my husband got an affidavit from his uncle, from Texas or from where. But affida --\nand then he asked for me because we were engaged, til the affidavit came, we -- we worked on a\npassport. The numbers were very high in the States, yes, registration number. And til -- and he\nhas his -- he had his store, his house and so on, til he deci -- he -- til he started to be -- to turn to\nthe Communists. So til then we asked for the passport and we send the last minute the pa -- the\naffidavit to the consulate, to the American consulate, and it was late, was late, because -- because\nwhy? Because the numbers were high. So somehow it didn\u2019t work, til we decided that we want\nto leave. So the numbers were late, and we stayed. And then it was impossible to go.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: For years. And then we left still, to s -- we came to New York in 1966. They permitted us for\na -- for a visit. They believed that we will return. But we didn\u2019t find that what we -- what we\nwere looking for in New York. We stayed for two months, and we had -- had on jobs. So we\ndidn\u2019t have to -- where to sleep, we slept once here, once there, we have shift from place to\nplace, yes. So we went back. And then we started again --",
        "Q: Again, right.",
        "A: -- and we came there, then we returned.",

        "Q: Alice is it.",
        "A: -- regularly, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. Do you have -- when you think about your life, do you think that Auschwitz changed\nyou a great deal? Or how -- how do you think that -- be-besides the loss, I mean that\u2019s clear --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- that the loss is tremendous and there\u2019s nothing -- but you as a person, do you think it\nchanged you a great deal?",
        "A: Yes. I don\u2019t find things so -- some things for s-so important than -- than many people, ye --\nyes. I don\u2019t find little things so very important. Things are which -- you will leave and they will\nstay and nothing will change. No, I -- I don\u2019t know how I was there at that time, because I was so\nyoung.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So I didn't have certain [indecipherable] for life. I didn\u2019t have certain -- any [indecipherable].\nI wanted to be well, I wanted to be happy, and that\u2019s it. So I -- I didn\u2019t have [indecipherable] I\nwant this, this, I -- my values are this or this. But only for now, I -- I feel sometimes different\nfrom others in this aspect, that not everything is for me so important like for you here in the\nStates, who didn\u2019t go through these harsh times. And maybe I understand better people. I look\nfor a reasons when somebody is not as I want to. So I try to find the reason why is he not,\nbecause I believe that everybody has some reason for his way, how he thinks, yes. And\neverybody is right, in his way, and that perception is different, but is a big value to you. Doesn\u2019t\nhave to be to me, or to others. And then, not everybody has the strength to -- to struggle the same\nway for life, yes. You will go for -- you want to be, let\u2019s see, I don\u2019t know, maybe you are the\ndirector of the whole museum or something, or a minister of -- of welfare, or something. And\nsomebody will not have courage, or I will not have courage and you do it your way because you\nbelieve in your strengths and so somebody doesn\u2019t believe, or you believe in -- in mankind,\nsomebody doesn\u2019t. You will risk your life for somebody, and some -- whatever. It doesn\u2019t mean\nthe other one is better or worse. That\u2019s your -- your -- these are your values and your beliefs.\nWho believes and values the same thing, yes? You believe in this [inaudible]",
        "Q: So, it -- has it in some strange way made you more tolerant than you would have been?",
        "A: Yes. I think so.",
        "Q: That you\u2019re easier on people, you don\u2019t judge people?",

        "A: I like to understand people.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

But I -- I didn\u2019t have -- maybe somehow\nunconsciously I had these beliefs but I didn't know about it because I didn\u2019t have to deal with\nreal life. I went home, I have my food, I have my bed, I have my -- my love from my parents,\nfrom my family. So I didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t have to speculate why it\u2019s like that or like that. Life was\nsimple. Was a [indecipherable] yeah, but I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t have my own [indecipherable] and I\nhave to make up my own [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and that is [indecipherable]",
        "Q: But it\u2019s interesting that such a brutal place as Auschwitz --",

        "A: No. No, I didn\u2019t.",

        "Q: Right, right. But you did realize a dream that you had when you were a child, and that was to\nbecome a teacher.",
        "A: Yes, I wanted to become a teacher.",
        "Q: And you did.",
        "A: Yes, and after the war I wanted double to be a teacher. Not [indecipherable] so much to teach,\nbut how to behave and didn\u2019t succeed always, not all the students were good, but I tried, I tried.",

        "A: That is family living, that 1s what -- housing and design, that is nutrition and cooking and\nsewing and material. That\u2019s my -- yeah. But in Canada 1s like that, that you don\u2019t -- sorry -- that\nyou don\u2019t stick only to one subject, you teach everything what you need to teach, okay? You\nteach it. So I taught many things. I studied mathematics, which I am not so good in mathematics,\nI couldn\u2019t say, but I didn\u2019t know [indecipherable] taught me, and even physics one time I had to\nteach, lot more. I taught many things, what they needed, yeah, so.",
        "Q: But what you were really teaching was [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well [indecipherable] that was family living, that means -- I studied human relations and\nfamily living see, for eight years at Magill to -- to make up my -- my -- my studies, yeah, for\nupdate my studies [indecipherable] what did I stu -- yeah, I had special education\n[indecipherable] and then I had there a teacher certificate and here I made the [indecipherable]\nthree diplomas here. But they -- everywhere was psychologic, everywhere was psychologic.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: To understand people, that was my first thing. And I think I master this one, to understand\npeople. I try evaluate people, and then to understand them. That is my main thing in life, toward\npeople.",
        "Q: And what did you enjoy most about teaching?",
        "A: Mostly check. I used to say, you don\u2019t like your -- your -- your day, think about the check. Or\n-- or think about the -- some people work also in a mental hospital. But I -- I used to say really\nwas -- I was joking, that if one -- if only one student understood me, if I changed only one\nstudent, then it was worthwhile everything to study, to teach and so -- to change them, to change\nthem, to -- to -- to give them self confidence -- first of all self confidence, that\u2019s very important.\nAnd self reliance and -- and things like that to -- to help them to -- to make a living, to help them\nto make something about themselves. But then I saw that, that as soon changed, he didn\u2019t believe\nin himself. Sometimes I gave him a better mark, and I implanted into him that he is good. And\nsometimes it worked that he believed in himself. That is the most -- that was the most important\npart to me. And they should respect people and so, but mainly self respect. I used to say, and you\ndon\u2019t respect yourself, nobody will respect you. That was [indecipherable] I believe that\u2019s the\nmain thing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Courage, self respect, self confidence.",

        "Q: You wouldn\u2019t say.",
        "A: No, I wouldn\u2019t say, because I have to be one of them. Nothing has to be in my life which\nwould differ me, which would make me different, yeah?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see.",
        "A: Cause they were not in Auschwitz. They have to deal with life how it is.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] is.",
        "A: How it 1s, they have to deal this way. It\u2019s their [indecipherable]",

        "A: I was a good teacher.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: People liked me, yeah. Not everybody was -- had discipline in my class, no, because on the\nother side they counted on the that I am soft, maybe, right?",
        "Q: Right. Yeah, well --",
        "A: Oh that\u2019s right, yes, I couldn\u2019t say for sure I was so respected and so, but they liked me, and\nthey trusted me, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. So is there anything that we -- I know you have all sorts of things 1n your life that we\nhaven\u2019t talked about, but there -- 1s there anything important about your experiences during the\nHolocaust that you want to talk about that we haven\u2019t?",
        "A: Maybe about this lady, it\u2019s amazing, the German lady whom I met. She was lageralteste. This\nwas lagerfuehrer, an SS, and a haftling was lageralteste. She came, I met her, and she said that\nshe was a lagerfuehrerin. In a lager she was an SS, and that she opened the door and she let out\nthe prisoners and so she became a haftling. I mentioned her in my thing. And she -- and so she\nbecame a prisoner. Then I didn\u2019t see -- see her too much. And we discussed with her -- I suppose\nI spoke to her, discussed about human relations, among human feelings, about beha -- humanly\nto behave. And she said, it\u2019s very easy outside to behave humanly, according to etiquette, and\naccording to -- to -- to rules, human rules. But here it\u2019s very difficult, because first of all, we\nhave to think about ourselves, yes. Was difficult. So that outside I am very -- she said, outside in\nthe world, people move with masks on their faces. They smile, they speak nicely, it seems that\nthey care about themselves. But here you have to talk, you have to think about yourself. So it 1s\nnot so difficult that here you see the human being as it is -- as he is, as he is. There it is a mask.\nIt\u2019s a play. Outside, the world is a play, in lager --",
        "Q: It\u2019s not like that.",
        "A: -- 1s the real human being. Y-You show yourself -- you present yourself as you really are.\nYou don\u2019t try to cover up yourself. However, who -- how is -- whoever -- how he is, so he -- he\npresents himself. That\u2019s the real life, that\u2019s school.",
        "Q: And you think that\u2019s true?",
        "A: That\u2019s true.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s true, that\u2019s true. Yes, it\u2019s very true.",
        "Q: So -- so, if that\u2019s true, then was, in some sense, living outside the lager difficult, even though\nit was horrible in Auschwitz, there was something about it --",
        "A: No, nothing [indecipherable]",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: There you learn how to face people, how to understand people, you search in them how they\nare and you take them how they are. You understand them how they are. Not difficult.\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: But outside, it\u2019s harder.",
        "A: Outside, well, there are people which they -- which they try to -- to -- to present themselves\nbetter than they are.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It\u2019s hard for them to change, they should be really as they think that they have to be, or they\nwant to be seen. Understand that?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the mask.",
        "A: That\u2019s the mask. You have to take off the mask and --",
        "Q: Yeah, and be real.",
        "A: -- be real, yeah, and try to help and don\u2019t wait anything for -- somehow for a -- a reward.\nNobody has to thank me that I helped somebody [indecipherable]. I do it myself. I did it and it is,\nyes. No, it -- not for money, nor for favors, nothing. Yeah, you see [indecipherable]. And you\ncannot change people totally. You can adjust -- you cannot change too much, you have to try,\nyeah. You cannot change all that -- we say that you cannot change all that, well you change, you\nknow, you cannot. Exterior, you cannot change, you have to change your other, yourself.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] yourself inside.",
        "A: Inside, yes. And maybe you influence people this way, yes. You treat somebody nicely, he\nhas to be also nice, no? You be rough to somebody, or he will be rough, or he turns away from\nyou, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I think so. Life\u2019s not easy, but you have to manage, you know, right?",
        "Q: Well, I want to thank you so very much for coming to Washington and for being willing to\nsay as much as you have. It\u2019s really been an honor to be with you.",
        "A: Thanks. But it was something that I had to do. I had to do. And I think that I will feel more\nfree. Not free that -- not surrounded by fences, but free that I said what I had to say, yes. It was\nmany times my wish that everybody for the whole world should stay here for one night and for\none day and then to go home, to see how life is here [indecipherable] America.",
        "Q: But everybody should have seen what Auschwitz was like for one day and one night?",

        "Q: And more than two people are sleeping on each bunk?",
        "Q: In a lot of pain?",

        "Q: Early -- everybody -- every barrack would have that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And then who would then give you an assignment? You would wait?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: And who was the they, who would give -- who would tell you what to do?",
        "Q: So she remembers that the two of you had met each other in barrack four?",

        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: So someone would --",
        "Q: -- send you --",
        "Q: So you would translate from what to what?",
        "Q: And you knew Polish?",
        "Q: And it\u2019s enough -- it\u2019s close enough.",
        "Q: So was a lot of your work doing translations? Was that a great deal of the work?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: In Slovak.",
        "Q: Right. But you could speak with the Polish women who were there?",
        "Q: [indecipherable] you could -- you learned how to speak, yeah.",

        "Q: So it\u2019s possible.",
        "Q: It\u2019s possible that that\u2019s where you --",
        "Q: But that -- it\u2019s a vague memory for you.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "Q: At a certain point, when the transports are coming in to Auschwitz-Birkenau, and from the\noutside they\u2019re killing so many people, do the -- do the internal selections get less, so the people\nwho are already there --",
        "Q: -- are less likely to be selected?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Because there was too many?",
        "Q: So what was this like for you, you\u2019re seeing these people, you know by now --",
        "Q: -- the people are being gassed.",
        "Q: These are not simply people who have died and are being cremated, this 1s a factory of killing.",

        "Q: No.",
        "Q: So --",
        "Q: Because you were tired, or because --",
        "Q: Yeah, uh-huh",
        "Q: Now you mentioned the name of a woman guard, Irma Grese, who many people say wer --\nwas very cruel, but that\u2019s now how you remember her?",
        "Q: She wasn\u2019t cruel.",
        "Q: And was that the only time you had seen her?",
        "Q: You saw her other times? But she was never cruel to you?",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "Q: How come you were there, standing at the entrance?",
        "Q: Now, why was Laeuferin standing there, is -- in order to translate if there was a need to\ntranslate, or --",
        "Q: No, no, no, I mean when the transports are coming in.",
        "Q: So would you translate for -- the Germans were not speaking Polish?",
        "Q: So if they would say something 1n German --",
        "Q: You -- having to do with people, nothing.",
        "Q: Now were you also standing when they took the family camp, the Theresienstadt camp out to\nbe gassed, were you there? Am I wrong, or --",
        "Q: Not in Auschwitz, that\u2019s the pl --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: But being outside and watching that must have been very upsetting.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: What about the women\u2019s orchestra, was that important for you?",
        "Q: Alma Ros\u00e9.",

        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "Q: So they had to march in unison, together?",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t the same.",
        "Q: Now, there are some people who think they remember the orchestra playing when people\nwent to the gas, and other people saying there was never an orchestra.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: So the music for you was really important.",
        "Q: Did you know that Tsipi was in the orchestra, that she played mandolin?",
        "Q: She played mandolin and when they went -- they -- they marched out, so they would play for\npeople who were going to work, they would come by block four and pick her up, and she would\ngo with them and play. I don\u2019t know if she ever played concerts, but she played --",
        "Q: You didn't know that.",

        "Q: So that was very hard on you to lose her.",
        "Q: Still hard?",
        "Q: I see what you\u2019re saying.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Were -- the -- the women that you saw, did most of them have one very close person?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know how they -- how it was working.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right. Did you ever see men coming into the camp and working?",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t it the case that there was some -- somebody who was working the Sonderkommando,\nwho spoke with you about what happened? Some person who saw you in Auschwitz, and talked\nto you, who came in the women\u2019s camp? Didn\u2019t you write about that?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "Q: He found a mirror? This was after the war, this was --",
        "Q: -- during? He found a mirror and so he was fixing himself up.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: But there were a number of times when you actually saved people, you risked your life.",
        "Q: Not just with -- with your friend Dieter, that was very dangerous to go into block 25 to bring\nher out.",
        "Q: In front, even in front.",
        "Q: Cause clearly she was waiting.",
        "Q: And how did you do that?",
        "Q: So I-let\u2019s stop the tape and we\u2019ll start with that --",
        "Q: -- on the next tape with you -- with getting Vera out.",
        "Q: Okay, before we talk about your saving Vera Isen, tell me what impelled you to do this? It\nwas so dangerous, you could have been caught in a second and killed.",
        "Q: What made you do it? How --",
        "Q: And nobody saw you, Irma didn\u2019t see you. Irma -- irm -- was Irma Weiss, right?",
        "Q: Irna, rather, right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: She knew.",
        "Q: But if they were going through the -- th -- the process, this wasn\u2019t outside, this was inside --",
        "Q: -- were they not taking down names?",
        "Q: They can -- not that -- it was just n -- just moving people.",
        "Q: I see, so --",
        "Q: I see, so they can -- there was no way to check if you --",
        "Q: I see. Now, there were other people in that room.",
        "Q: Did they realize what you were doing, or you don\u2019t know?",
        "Q: That was people who were deteriorated and -- and close to death also, right.",
        "Q: So she escaped herself.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: And what gave you -- were you holding onto this young -- this 16 year old girl when you said\nto this other woman if you -- if you will take --",
        "Q: You just took her.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] you just took her.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what brought --",
        "Q: -- together. And what made you th -- I understand this was some instinctual thing --",
        "Q: -- o-on your part, but what made you say that to her? Because you didn\u2019t think that the 16\nyear old would survive if she didn\u2019t have somebody?",
        "Q: Did they sur -- did they survive?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So tell me the story about Vera Isen.",
        "Q: No, you didn\u2019t. What happened, yeah.",
        "Q: So you\u2019ve never seen her since that day?",
        "Q: Right, right. Did you tell her when you brought her to -- to the sauna, did you say I am your\ncousin, or you never told her?",
        "Q: Oh, you did tell her.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: As a cousin",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: So how do you understand yourself doing all of this?",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "Q: Nobody?",
        "Q: And you had just faked everything?",
        "Q: But he didn\u2019t look.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: But don\u2019t you, even if people don\u2019t thank you, you have some feeling in yourself about what\nyou did.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: But something -- something must have been in your family, there\u2019s a certain kind of justice,\nor evenness, even what you did after the war, that even though this woman had no right to get\nmoney from you.",
        "Q: None --",
        "Q: -- whatsoever. But you -- it was more important for you to shut her up essentially --",
        "Q: -- so she wouldn\u2019t say nasty things about your father.",
        "Q: It was your responsibility.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s a -- oh, there\u2019s -- there\u2019s something, something.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: You just did it.",
        "Q: You just did it.",
        "Q: So you did it.",
        "Q: But you know, when you said -- when we were talking before, about having -- being practical.",
        "Q: In a situation that was --",
        "Q: -- clearly completely crazy.",
        "Q: But in order to live in it, you had to think in a practical way --",
        "Q: -- not in some fantasy land, right?",
        "Q: So you were thinking and strategizing --",
        "Q: -- and seeing --",
        "Q: -- little ways.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: I-I would think it would make somehow living with that experience a little bit easier, but you\nactually acted --",
        "Q: -- on behalf of other people.",
        "Q: And didn\u2019t simply watch -- you got saved and watched --",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think you could have --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes, I think it\u2019s very interesting.",

        "Q: Why did he -- yes, can you -- was this in block four?",

        "Q: Uh-huh, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Do you remember when you left Birkenau before you actually were evacuated? Did you\nevacuate and go back to Auschwitz one? Or did you leave from Birkenau and start the Death\nMarch immediately?",
        "Q: Right away?",
        "Q: And that was January 18?",
        "Q: So, before you do that, let me -- did you smoke when you were in Auschwitz?",
        "Q: Sometimes?",
        "Q: I understood that men were allowed cigarettes but women were not.",

        "Q: And did other women in block four smoke --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s how you got, somebody would just say that you want a cigarette?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: But how would people get cigarettes, they would barter with something? H-How did these\nwomen get cigarettes do you think?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you had access in that barrack to things, because you could walk around and you also were\nable to do that, whereas most women couldn't do that in the camp.",
        "Q: No, you had access to be able to barter with the Germans.",
        "Q: No?",
        "Q: As a [indecipherable]. Right.",

Even I liked him\nlike [indecipherable] boy, and so -- so I went once in his room, and I saw there a letter lying on\nthe table, I was looking at it. And there was a little picture, little picture of a girl, and it was\nsigned like, eira Dieter, e1ra Dieter, yeah. I didn\u2019t ask anybody. I always had the nature not to\nask, I don\u2019t ask people anything. When they s -- you say something to me, you say\n[indecipherable]. So I was -- and I remembered this name Dieter, yes, and I knew that was from\nBratislava, because he went, this cousin, to visit. That\u2019s it. And went to [indecipherable] in the\nlager, and there -- you see, when people cannot fight enemies, yeah, Americans with the\nCanadians, with Mexicans and so they turn against groups, yeah. So was in lager also. The first\nday, the girls started. Oh you western girls, be ashamed, all you eastern girls, yes. I was from\nwest Slovakia, or east Slovakia -- my direction is always [indecipherable] -- east Slovakia,\nBratislava was from west Slovakia. So -- and once, in 1942, we were in Birkenau right aw --\nright away, yes, was maybe in -- in -- no, I don\u2019t ri -- in winter after we came there. We were\nstanding the whole Sunday outside, was cold, very cold. We are standing there. And that time I\nthink we didn\u2019t have more these uniforms, we were somehow in civil dresses, and we had the\nline. [indecipherable]. There was a group of girls and they played around and talked and so, and\nthey were from the other part of Slovakia, and they asked me where I am from. I said from this\npart of slo -- said, oh, you are the same like we are. You are -- you don\u2019t belong there\n[indecipherable]. I was very honored, yes. Bigger group. So and there was a girl and they played\naround with her joking, and said -- oh, somebody said, oh my Dieter. Dieter, yeah. And I ask her,\n\u2018Are you Dieter Rishter?\u201d She said, \u201cYes, I am Dieter Rishter.\u201d So -- because he told me her\nname is Dieter Rishter. So I said, my uncle is whoever. She said, oh, I remember him very well.\nAnd then I stayed with them, and she said, come with me, come with me, we will be together.\nBecause we could move our bunks, yes, and in this barrack where we were, there were beds,\neverybody had one bed, not this bunk. [indecipherable]. But two -- two girls slept together\nbecause these beds were -- come, come with me, we will be together. She has a -- she had the\nolder sister there. So then I stayed with her, and we became very, very good friends. We worked\ntogether, we were in the same commando and we were together. But she became sick. And when\nwe had our biggest, biggest selection, 1943, so she had swollen legs. We were sitting in the\nsauna the whole night on benches and so, so she had up her legs and I was massaging her legs,\nshe was very, very sick. I took care of her. And then in the -- the whole night we were sitting\nthere in the sauna, and during the morning we had to line up, and it was a selection, and that was\nthe biggest, biggest selection, because always when the lager was full, 1t wasn\u2019t place where to\nsleep, then they made the selection. Between that time we went back to the other barrack, we had\n-- we slept on these bunks and so -- and so it was a big selection, very big, first they took one,\nthen five left, and so on and so on and so. So I asked myself someday, how come that they never\nselected me, that they never pointed on me. So I came to the conclusion, maybe it\u2019s true, because\nI never looked at them. [indecipherable] like this. I was straight, and I never looked up there. I\nsays, and maybe they pointed and I didn\u2019t see. But I think [indecipherable] maybe\n[indecipherable]. Anyhow, so I put Dieter in front of me, Dieter do -- she spoke German, you go\nin front of me, and I will follow you on the selection, because I was so sure that I will make it,\nthat time. So she pointed like that, and she went, and I was praying, oh my God, help me, Dieter\nshould pass by. [indecipherable]. So -- and she went, she passed. They didn\u2019t take her to the gas\nchamber, she passed by. I was so happy, thanks God. Dieter went through sick. And then we had\nto line up again and then they send us to barracks, to different barracks, here, here, we stopped,\nSO, SO, So -- So I lost her, no. She went somewhere else. And the next day in the morning, I don\u2019t\nremember if we didn\u2019t go to work or so, or maybe early morning, I went from one barrack to the\nother one to call her name. Dieter Rishter, Dieter Rishter. No answer. So I went to the next\nbarrack, and to next barrack. And somebody said, \u201cDieter Rishter died.\u201d She survived the\nselection, but she died, sick and exhausted. So what happened? She went down from the\n[indecipherable] from the bank [indecipherable] she had to go down. She went down, she fell\ndown. And she wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] they took her to the -- through to -- to the other\n[indecipherable] and I lost Dieter. I cannot still forget her, such a nice girl. So -- and before --\nexcuse me -- before her, her sister died, before her, you know.",

        "A: -- or maybe longer, I don\u2019t know, maybe longer. We made even business together, because\nshe was [indecipherable] work -- working on a place with clothing, you know, from the gas\nchamber when the people arrived. They had to drop there the things, they didn't arrive to the\nlager to leave them. And then they carried the things to our company and we had to -- to -- to\nfold them, to bundle them, and they send it, probably to Germany. And people had some\njewelries, diamonds, and -- in their clothing, yeah. So it was there a pile of this clothing and they\nhave to sortir it, and she was on the pile and I was folding, yeah. So she said once, when I will\ncall summerkleider, summer dresses, so you come, that means that I found something, some\njewelry, something. So once she found ducats -- ducats, golden ducats, golden [indecipherable]",
        "A: So I took it a few ounce, I think eight or so.

I used to see him to come in -- into work place,\nso -- and I noticed that he takes something from girls and then he brings something. So I stopped\nhim, I said I have ducats, I have golden ducats, I gave him.

So I don\u2019t know which month it\ncould have been, yes. Maybe between -- between the naishtuber, laundry, maybe between the\nlaundry, because from laundry I went to the naishtuber between -- before. So we had to wear\nimpossible thing, our shoes on our shoulders. You tied the shoes to put on the shoulder, and\nbarefoot in to walk to a forest where there were little stones like gravel, yeah? And we have to\nwalk, so -- and [indecipherable] little gravels, they were cold, and they were wet. And first of all\nmy -- my soles, they became hard and -- and painful, yes, you mention, like that. Later on the\nsoles, they became hard, trained well, no problem. But my eyes, probably from an infa -- an\ninflammation from these cold stones. So on my eyelashes, they were some kind of glue. You\nknow, when I woke up in the morning, I couldn\u2019t open my eyes, cause they were so dry on the\neyelashes, got dry glue. So I had to take off little by little, little by little. And then next night\nagain happened, yes, so I was -- I was f -- quite for a few -- for a time with this -- my eyes, and --\nand one morning, I w -- yeah, so we -- we had to walk barefooten, we worked with the shoes,\nand then we had to take off the shoes, and to come back again barefooten, again this -- to this --\nthrough this -- was so bad, thank God, I still feel chilly when I think about it. So one day I was\nstanding on zaeh -- zaehlappell, and I used to stand in the -- I don\u2019t know why, in the front, first\none.

I looked around, not frar -- far from me was standing\nHimmler, with his fancy gla -- eyeglasses. Oh my God, I was so scared that Himmler will look at\nme, and he\u2019ll see my -- my -- my eyes, I thought this [indecipherable] I heard the Gypsies, they\nused to have [indecipherable] too. I was so scared he would send me for death. I didn't know that\ntime gas chambers was in Auschwitz.

We didn't work, but he\nkept us longer and he phoned into the lager that we are very busy, that we have to stay longer,\nand so probably he saved many people.",
        "A: And we had to cross only from one -- from one ba -- not barrack, from one part to the other\npart through a big door, so we -- we avoided the main door also, by coming home and selection\nwe avoided. And then when it was -- it was typhus epidemic there, so he let many girls to sit on,\nand not to work. And he asked for tea, for enough tea to drink. So he carried in a lot of tea we\nshould have enough, fever -- feverish and who couldn\u2019t work, didn\u2019t have to work. He was a ma\n-- ma -- nice man. That was very important. And the other one, maybe he was also nice, but I\ndidn\u2019t like him, he was so noisy. During the first lunch when I was there -- during lunch, as we\nate, he said lie down all of you. We had to put the food down an-and to lie down in the mud. And\nthen when -- after work, the girls -- not always, I wasn\u2019t there for a -- for a few days, but\nsometimes we had to undress and so he looked through ours if we didn\u2019t take something.

        "A: And the other one, he wasn\u2019t for long there, but he suggested me there for, because one day\nhe came and he asked, who knows the difference between pure silk and artificial material. I say, I\nknow it, cause I learned at school. So then I was, from the bundles I had to find a pure silk\nlingerie to take out and to bundle it differently. So he knew that I am not stupid.",

Well, it\u2019s like they send, run here, run here, there\u2019s a\nLaeuferin come, go to the other door [indecipherable] go to this barrack, to this block and so --\nso they needed, I heard that. So I decided -- decided, I says, I will talk to Tauber, the worst. And\nafter the appell, after that zaehlappell, I was on the road, on the sidewalk and he went on his\nbike, this strong Tauber. And I stopped him from the bike, and I said, Herr Rapportfuehrer,\nhaftling [speaks German here]. Mr. Rapportfuehrer -- you will understand, yes, that want to talk -\n- talk to you. So he went down from the bike, and was standing looking at me. And I said, I am\nhere from the very beginning -- it was true. I didn\u2019t say it between I was a [indecipherable]\nbeginning, and I am -- I worked in Ausenkommando. And I know that you are the only one who\ncan help me. I heard that you need Laeuferin, other Laeuferin. I would like to be a Laeuferin.\nAnd he said, \u201cGo to Katya,\u201d she was the -- the -- the main registrar.

And I let -- ran to Katya Singer, and I said, Tauber send me.\nShe said, I need a -- a written note from Tauber. Couldn\u2019t do anything else. Next day -- morning,\nI went to Ausenkommando again, and then in the evening when it was zaehlappell, he came to\nthe block, and he was choosing the other girl for Laeuferin.

We were standing at the entrance, and in front of us, like you -- no,\nfurther, let\u2019s say, opened the wagons, cattle wagons and stepped out people from there, and they\nwere hurrying like [indecipherable], and they holding tight to their belongings. They were\nholding tight to their families, and they were hungry and they were thirsty and it was hot. Nearly,\nwhen they -- when the Hungarian came, this was the 16\"\" of May, hot. They didn\u2019t have enough\nair, they\u2019re smelling an-and shiny. Water was -- was running from the [indecipherable] that\nreligious men were in these black caftans with beards and with hats. And two of them came to\nus, we were two at the entrance and said in Yiddish, that you are Jewish children, give to us\nwater. They left everybody and they came to us. What could we have done? I went to the Ausen,\nand she was -- her name was Grese, Ausen Grese, a beautiful lady -- girl, a little bit crazy, but\nshe wasn\u2019t so mean. I went, I said -- and I had to report why they came to us, yes, was\ndangerous. So I said, these two men came and they ask for water. What can we do? We didn\u2019t\nhave even water. She said, don\u2019t bother with them, because it could happen that they will take\nyou also with them. So we were standing, looking at them, and didn\u2019t say even anything. It was\nvery sad, very sad to see so many people. And they had to leave their belongings, they had to\nleave the families because the SS said line up, line up. They were their prisoners also in these\nuniforms. They had to help with the belongings, their suitcases. But they ran all over among\nthem, among the newcomers and they said -- they suggested, mothers with children, give over\nthe children to the grandmothers. Men, you say that you are younger. Boys, when you are told,\nyou say that you are older. When they ask you about your profession, you say that you have a\ntrade in -- not in German I don\u2019t know [indecipherable] they could understand each other. And\nthe SS, they yelled los, los, and line up. So suddenly in five minutes they didn\u2019t have their\nbelongings, they didn\u2019t have their families. Some mothers, they give over to their grandmothers,\nsome kept them. They had to line up again, men to me -- with men, women with women. Women\n-- mothers hold the children, and then came the doctor, and selected with one finger. He didn\u2019t\nbother too much, he didn\u2019t think too much. And so they came with a little wand, they took the\nsick ones first, yes, and then they took them. They didn\u2019t know what happened to them. It was so\nsudden that they didn\u2019t know what happened to them. And they were carried away. And some of\nthem then came to the lager, but not right away, not right away, they took them some\n[indecipherable] place and then they came into. And in a short time you saw the flames. So that\nwas very often a st -- we were so close, the crematory wasn\u2019t far from the entrance. So often was\nthere a strong smell of burned flesh and burned bones, very often, more often than not, from the\nburning people. Was very sad. They came, they came, it was time and they came and came.\nNever stopped. Was time and for weeks nobody came, maybe for a month, I don\u2019t know, don\u2019t\nremember.

Since I was --\nbefore Laeuferin, I was Schreiberin, so I -- people knew me, so I had some position. So I went\nthere, there was a Slovak lady, older than -- she was a mother of a girl [indecipherable]. I said\n[indecipherable] didn\u2019t ask who we are, what -- what [indecipherable], no, nothing nothing.

I took my cousin and I went with her to\nthe sauna, because I knew that that time they were sending the haftlings to -- to Germany to\nwork, you know, Philips and so on and so. They went there. And there was an SS,\n[indecipherable] and these SS people they knew me, because I was standing there. Her name was\nZiatz, and I knew she\u2019s a simple woman, older woman, in her 40\u2019s, somehow, I never heard her\nvoice, she must be a nice woman. So I went to her and I said [indecipherable], I said this is my\ncousin, look how beautiful she is, she is nicer looking than I am, I gave her some\n[indecipherable]. And she\u2019s in -- the problem with -- with her that she\u2019s in block 25. She has to\ngo to the gas chamber. And she can go as a nice looking girl, then I can go also. I am not so nice\nlooking than her. Please help me. Send her away with the -- with these people to Germany to\nwork. And she looked, and she said, leave her here. And I left her there, and I believed her, this\n[indecipherable] I left her there. And that\u2019s it. And I had the feeling, that\u2019s a good feeling, the\ngirl is safe. After the wer -- war, when I came to PreSov, I met a girl from Hungary, from there,\nand we were so [indecipherable] saw me, knew the name. She said, I was in [indecipherable]\nwith the -- they had a -- a grape garden. So I met there Vera Isen, and she said you should come\nthere to pick up grapes. So I said, well I don\u2019t know. But I knew that I will not go, I wasn\u2019t the\nmood to travel with grapes, forget about it. And then I said, are you go back, tell her that I thank,\nthat I\u2019m here and I thank, and -- but I will not be here, I will be in Humenn\u00e9, I go to my uncle. So\nthen I received from her a letter. I\u2019m not sure if I wrote her or she wrote me, that I don\u2019t know.\n[indecipherable] was a little place, Humenn\u00e9 was also a little place, was enough to know the\nname, okay, [indecipherable]. So I received a letter that she\u2019s with her brother there and they\nwant to go to the States, to New York. But that time wasn\u2019t permitted from Hungary to write to\nNew York, wasn\u2019t permitted somehow connection [indecipherable] I should write -- she wrote\nme the address to New York, I should wr-write in Hungarian [indecipherable]. So I wrote there,\nand that\u2019s it. I never heard about her, never, never, never. After years and years my cousin from\nKoshitza, from Slovakia wrote to me that she -- she received a letter from Israel -- from Israel\nfrom my other cousin, that this cousin from Israel was in New York to visit a other cousin and\nthat Vera wi -- Vera Isen was there and she\u2019s in this book about Auschwitz, and she said the\nstory that the -- she was select -- she was selected to -- for -- for Germany to work, and I didn\u2019t\nknow that time that she had a sister and she had a mother there. And the other blockalteste came\nthere, and managed -- because she was the last one, that they took her out from the line, and she\nput her sister or her cousin or somebody, this blockalte -- somebody instead her, and they took\nher from there to block 25, ye -- and that I took her out, and -- and so -- and sh -- and this cousin\nfrom Israel said that she wanted my [indecipherable] wanted my address where I live now, to tell\nme that she\u2019s alive. So I wrote to her, but she didn\u2019t write for a long time. So I said, when she\ndoesn\u2019t write, ask from Israel her address. [indecipherable] I -- I never said to her -- she doesn\u2019t\nknow the story of my father, that my father had her -- I don\u2019t know what -- what kind of reli --\nrelative was his mother and so -- so as was -- so a few -- then she in -- then she invited me to\nFlorida, I should come, I knew that I will not go. I said maybe. And then she called I shouldn\u2019t\ngo for January because her children are there, sh -- I should come for February. And I said, I will\ngo rather to -- to New York. Then I had my hip operation, I said [indecipherable] called me, I\nsaid I -- I cannot go because I have a hip operation.

        "A: He doesn\u2019t know. Now, Hugo said we go to -- to [indecipherable] what for? I said, we are\ninvited to say about our e-experiences, that\u2019s all. And I was thinking about it, and I said\n[indecipherable] to tell him, maybe I have to say to him that I was in Auschwitz.",

At school, my -- my college, they didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t say anything about.\nWhat should I be special? But Mala was somebody, you know. She was beautiful, an-an-and she\nwas a personality -- not personality, a leader type, yes?",
        "A: The people, if they come into somewhere and they will be right away lead -- visible, yes? And\nthat was Mala. Was not smart.",
        "A: Too much self confidence. She went over the limit, stepped out from the lager in SS uniform.",
        "A: No, no, no, she had --",

        "A: And he also had -- very attractive man, smart and everything, courageous and proud.\n[indecipherable |",

        "A: They didn\u2019t hang her.",
        "A: Yes, I was there.",
        "A: Yeah, it was everywhere.",
        "A: Yeah. And we were exchange, we were placed into -- in-into the blocks, yes, I was -- became\nSchreiberin. And --",
        "A: After her escape --",
        "A: -- yeah, and they put 16 years old girls, and I had to see the Lagerfuehrerin with a message,\nyes? And I had so -- so much courage that I said to the Lagerfuehr [indecipherable] was the\nLagerfuehrerin. I said, Frau Lagerfuehrerin, is this possible, to work with children? Yeah. Maybe\nI wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] and she said, for us is everything possible. Yeah [indecipherable] so I\nleft, turned and ran. So after that, a few days later, somebody came into the barrack and said\nMala 1s back. She stands on the entrance, she is on the entrance. She is back in lager. They\nbrought her [indecipherable] from the prison. And then somebody said the other one -- I think\nthat -- I think that Sally -- Sally was her name, Sal -- I don\u2019t know, one was Herta, the other one\nwas Leah, I think. But the third one, I think that\u2019s Sallah, I don\u2019t know. And that I don\u2019t\n[indecipherable] that she went to -- to the entrance, and she gave her a razor blade, in case she\nhas to cut her veins. And then was a whistle and all of us who was in the lager, had to go into the\nB lager to stand there. We were standing and they brought, I don\u2019t know who came with her,\nMala. She was there to [indecipherable] Mala is here. Wasn\u2019t so simple. And there was the\nLageralteste, and was a Scharfuerer [indecipherable]. Lageralteste Mandel, and Scharfuerer\n[indecipherable]. And Mandel, the la -- the SS Mandel, she said to -- the short speech, and she\nsaid, we got a message from Berlin, this Mala has to be put into a crematorium alive, alive.",
        "A: Aloud, for everybody. And whoever would escape, will happen for everybody. And then --\nthen Mala took the razor blade, and she cut her forehead -- forehand, yes, forehand like this, and\nturned her arm, and blood dripped from her, and with the right hand she slapped this thir -- yeah,\nand the thir -- the [indecipherable] she too -- he took razor blade from her hand out, so she\nslapped him, yes. And blood was dripping. And then he took her hand down and sent her I don\u2019t\nknow, I don\u2019t remember who went with her to the [indecipherable] to the [indecipherable] to the\nemergency or something like that. They went with her, and we were standing there, and then she\nreturned and -- and bandaged her forearm, and then I don\u2019t -- don\u2019t remember if [indecipherable]\nor there they put her in some carriage, and somebody pulled her out of the lager. And then in the\nmorning we heard that when she arrived there was an SS man, and he said, oh that\u2019s you. He\nrecognize her, because they went out and -- it\u2019s you. I will not throw you in the oven alive. And\n[indecipherable] we know that -- knew that from the Sonderkommando who worked there,\nsomebody said that he gave her a pill, and -- and here, poison yourself. Or the mer -- there most\nprobably was that he shot her -- I will shot her -- shot you first. And the third version was that\nshe took a pill, that she had the poisonous pill. She killed her -- poisoned herself. And Edek was\nhanged.",
        "A: Edek was hanged [indecipherable]",

        "A: She has to have evidence of people, somebody\u2019s placed to the barrack, somebody\u2019s placed\nfrom the barracks. And nationalities, how many those, those, those, those, those, according, a list\nhas to be put together, and to take to the Schriebstuber. Then we had a reconvalescent lag --\nblock. That meant some people, they -- which they were sick and they were not sent to the gas\nchamber, let\u2019s see, the non-Jews, they were not sent to the gas chamber, yes. You are sick, you\nwent to the Revere, to the [indecipherable]. And then they send them for a few day -- let\u2019s say\nfor three days or four or five, six days or [indecipherable] mostly to a reconvalescent block. And\nthen you had to place them from the reconvalescent block according to regulations, back. And\nback from there they came, yes. So, when we had to send them back, we had to go to the same\nroute as who was there when Mala -- was Mala, who me she slapped, for permission -- he had to\nsign that go to place, and so on. But again, I didn\u2019t place back. [indecipherable] I knew when I\nwas Laeuferin, he was there in this -- that was his office. So I used to go to him, I said, Herr -- it\nwas the Arbeitsfuehrer, something like that, please sign me, sign me this. And he used -- used to\nsmile, so -- he didn\u2019t look at me, only smiled, and signed, didn\u2019t say anything. And I sent to the -\n- to the sewing room, sewing, because there we were exchange for young -- for older people\nfrom Auschwitz. But the -- here was older people, so mainly older people came. So sent them\nthere, or I kept them longer or so -- so we had to be in [indecipherable] maybe he didn\u2019t know,\nmaybe he smiled only like, I don\u2019t know, I never ask him why he smiles, I didn\u2019t care, he sign.\nSo we had to be in connection with this -- this Arbeitskommandant. We had to go to the\nSchreibstuber, and the Zaehlappell had to be correct, yes, so that was -- now, and beside that, we\nhelp, from -- we order, and so food came, too. Sliced bread to -- and the portions of soup -- the\nstoup beans the -- the stew beans, they gave them food, but bread to prepare every evening again,\nso I would work around, there were many people in there. I don\u2019t know how many hundreds of\npeople sometimes in a block.",

        "A: -- yes, among the elite, and I was a little lower in the same barrack I were when I went as a\nSchreiberin made -- this my notes and I sent there, I give it there, and they gave it to her from --\nis interesting, no? And now we meet.",

        "A: Very interesting.",

        "A: That was when we left -- when we left A barrack, the A lager, and we left A lager when I said\nthat we s -- we were there -- left -- we were there, only few girls yes, and I was scared, but we\u2019ll\nhave [indecipherable] to die, I was scared --",
        "A: -- and so on, and so what will. So one day came an SS, and he took us to a other lager, to\nanother lager, only by foot, it was close, yeah. And I came to this blockalteste, who saw me that\nevening that I took somebody from this road that was outside there, standing, here they were\nstanding, and then -- but that\u2019s interesting, that this girl became a woman, and she committed in\nIsrael suicide. Whom I took from the sauna, you know it?",
        "A: Which I -- the -- the other --",
        "A: -- Schreiberin erased her name, and so I took her from the sauna, she went to her\n[indecipherable] and I took her to the other one. She came to New York, she divorced her\nhusband, left her son with her husband, went to -- to Israel, married again, and then she\ncommitted the suicide. Destiny, yeah. So the question was, this drunk SS.",
        "A: Yeah. So from there we went to the other and this blockalteste who saw me to steal her\n[indecipherable] I came there, and she said that she wanted a -- I wrote it there -- somebody as a\nPolish, a Polish woman, as a Schreiberin, but the other one, who worked with Katya\n[indecipherable] means miss, misses, yeah. She told me, the blockalte -- probably not\n[indecipherable] that I have to take -- she didn\u2019t know me, I didn\u2019t know her, we saw each other\nonly this evening, yeah. She said that Aliska has to be her Schreiberin, because when Aliska was\ngood to -- to save the Polish women, you know, from the Visla that she sent to the latrine, go to\nthe latrine, then she\u2019s got to be Schreiberin here. So I became the Schreiberin there, and it was\nthe a-assistant blockalteste a Polish woman, a other one, they were sitting together, two Polish\nwomen. And I was with them, the Schreiber. It was -- I think it was late -- yeah, in October we\ncame there, I think maybe in October, could have been winter or -- or so, 1t was cold, I know it --\nwe didn\u2019t have a calendar there. I didn\u2019t know the date, I didn\u2019t know the day. Sunday we knew\nbecause we didn\u2019t go to work. So, open the door and an SS man came into [indecipherable]\nroom, because blockalteste, Schreiberin and assistant, we had a little room, yeah. So we were\nsitting that time there, and this drunk SS came in, took off his hat, put on a chair and said -- put --\ntook off the gun, put on the chair and sit there and said, I will stay here with you, and I will -- I\nwill sleep here on the floor with you, or I will go into the barrack and I will sleep on the bunk,\nthe bunk [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t leave from here, I will stay with you here. An SS. And this\nother -- the -- the assistant -- the assistant blockalteste, she was so strict to him, she started to spit\non his head, and so -- and then he said -- but he was very, very drunk, and he said, I don\u2019t want\nto live. And there -- therefore, I don\u2019t want to go from here, I -- therefore, I want to stay here,\nbecause I am not worthwhile to live. I killed so many girls from Holland, Dutch girls. They were\nso beautiful, and I went up the gas chamber, and I threw inside Zyklon B, Zyklon B, and I threw\nand I killed them, and they were so beautiful, and therefore I don\u2019t want to live. Now we were\nscared. A drunk SS and talk like that, and she spitting on his head. That was tragic, yeah? So it --\nwhat to do? So I didn\u2019t say anything, and I left. I left them, and I went at the end of the lager was\na office for the SS men. They stayed always there, I saw them to go into there, yeah. Never had\nanything to do with them. I saw them there. So I went into that office, to the SS office, and I said,\nwe have in our block an SS who is drunk, and he has a gun, and we are scared of his gun, and of\nhis -- could you please come to pick him up? I didn\u2019t say what he said, only that. And one of -- I\ndon\u2019t know, there were two or three there, I don\u2019t remember. Maybe I didn\u2019t notice, even. So he\ngot up and he followed me again, came into our little room, took him, didn\u2019t say anything -- he\nwas scared when he saw him. He took him, and -- he took him.",
        "A: And that was.",
        "A: The gun as well. This SS had also. Was dangerous, dangerous.",
        "A: Yes. N -- to me accidentally to --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right, yes. His conscience [indecipherable]",

        "A: October -- it was in October 1944? You see, I don\u2019t know. I know that I was in the lager,\nyeah, October 1944, which means I wasn\u2019t more Laeuferin, because I was til the end of June. It\nmeans I was -- October 1944? Yeah, before we left, before -- maybe it was before I left -- before\nwe left a -- A lager --",
        "A: -- which was -- that was sometimes in the fall. And I said that in October, probably we left A\nlager. So suddenly I saw -- we saw people running, running and with the running, running,\nrunning, and [indecipherable] was it blowed up? Probably yes. Running from there, from -- from\n[indecipherable] where the crematorium, people were running and now I really don\u2019t remember.\nI couldn\u2019t -- I cannot state that I saw to you the dynamite to blow up the crematorium, but\nprobably yes. But I remember for sure what I can picture how people run away. And that was the\nSonderkommando. Not Sonderkommando they [indecipherable] so -- and that was -- then was a\nrumor that it was a boxer -- boxer, a boxer, a French boxer?",
        "A: Among the Sonderkommando, and he said -- he said it to the SS, that they are planning to\nblow up the crematorium.",
        "A: And so they discovered it, and they ran. Was funny to see that somebody started to run in the\nlager, you know, the la -- lager to run, we couldn\u2019t understand, I was -- I think, I\u2019m not sure, I\ncannot state it again, but I think that one disappeared, I think so, but I am not sure.

And when he came to me, he said -- looked at me, that I\ndon\u2019t know if he saw me to steal, and he said, Zagmuzi, tell me, how many pairs of -- of\nstockings do you have in your shoes?

Had to write her name and to put into the bundle,\nyes, into the bundle. So I was responsible for one group like this. And once the kapo called me,\nkapo [indecipherable] prisoner kapo, and there was the Scharfuehrer, the commandant, the SS,\nand she -- and one of those showed me my name, my name on a paper in a bundle of man coats -\n- cold man coats, winter coats. And these -- there in this bundle was a coat which was muddy,\njust muddy. And he said, why did you put this -- your name -- the SS, why did you put this in --\nyour name in this bundle and it\u2019s dirty, you didn\u2019t clean it. I said, I never worked with -- with\nmen coats, I never worked there. I worked there in the front with the linen, bed linen. I never\nworked there and I -- and she slapped me, this kapo slapped me once, twice. He didn\u2019t say\nanything, he asked only. And I still said I didn\u2019t, and was never he -- and that was all, so twice,\nshe was slapping me, and she was slapping me for about -- oh, for --",
        "A: Really hard, because she stated was my name, that means my responsibility. Was easy to -- to\nget slapping. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, humiliation for sure.",

        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Not too much, but I meet people which they were there, or they -- they lost their families and\nso they were yes. No I -- I would say the contrary. When Jewish people meet, they come always\nto this the end. They always end up with this lagers, with whom they lost and so forth.",
        "A: Yeah. The -- they mention, remember him, him, him, my friend, this, this. So most of the time\nthey end -- or we end up with Auschwitz, or with -- with lagers, you know, I cannot.

        "A: But most of the time, or almost always, when people which --which they were friends before\nwe had -- which had the same friends and so -- so they end up or we end up to talk about it. No,\nit\u2019s a -- something what we never miss when we are among our people which they grew up in the\nsame city as it. We have a friend with my husband, we are every Sunday together, besides the\nother one who doesn\u2019t know, but he is somehow a little bit mixing up maybe. He said\n[indecipherable] why do you go to -- to Washington? He said, oh they called her from museum.\nAnd then I started to talk about something else.",

Nobody\u2019s there and I\u2019m by myself. Always I -- I go somewhere and I\ndon\u2019t know where. Yeah, something like -- I think something [indecipherable]. With my family I\ndon\u2019t dream so often. I was in Auschwitz, I used to dream with my brother. I knew, now I will go\nto bed and I will dream the same. Was still alive that time [indecipherable] thinking about it, and\nyou have no idea. That was my life, that I am with my brother.",

And he told me in the train, I was with your brother,\nI worked with him in the forest, and he run away when he heard that they take the parent of the\npeople to help them. He said, and then I stayed there, I went again to work there, and somehow I\nmet partisans and the partisans took me with him -- with them, and so I was saved. Was a smaller\nlager ne -- next to Lublin. And that -- that he was hidden. I think that he said that he knew from\nhim, or the lady where he worked, but I don\u2019t know who told me that he was hidden, and he\ncame home when he heard that they took hi -- but he told me this story and it\u2019s a true story.",

And this SS, he was, I\nknow from where, he was from Dusseldorf, Dooler, what Dooler? It will come to my name -- my\nmemory, Willie Dooler from Dusseldorf, and -- a Wehrmacht, and he said get up, get up. I said\nno, I am so tired. He said, you will get a cold. I said, I don\u2019t care. I really didn\u2019t care, I so tired.\n[indecipherable] get up, get up, because when you will stay in the back they will shoot you. So\nsomehow I managed. And so he was really often beside or behind us and he said go, go, go, go,\nso we went. He found us all the place to sleep, because some of them, or most of them, they slept\nin a barn, and he\u2019s -- he found us a place to sleep in a house. Was a woman there, a Polish\nwoman. He asked her to cook -- prepare us supper. She made us potatoes and ham -- and ham?\nHam, yeah, potatoes and ham. And after so many years, we --we slept in a bed.",
        "A: On the Death March, during the night. The other was in a barn. And I told him I want -- he --\nI loved his approach yes, I saw that he\u2019s so earnest. I said, I want to stay here, I want to hide. He\nsaid, if you want to, hide, but you take a risk because could happen that the Germans will -- will\nburn the village and you will burn with them. If you want I will give you bread. You can stay,\nbut rather go on. It\u2019s a risk to stay. So we went on and on, like him -- with him. And between\nthere -- between this time, they -- they were shooting people [indecipherable] the most sad part\nwhich I saw was when I saw a woman lying and a ho -- a brain next to her. They shoot her\nthrough the brain. And then a other one when -- a woman, she was Italian, not Jewish, she was\npregnant, and she was in my block where I was Schreiberin so she noticed me from somewhere\non a higher spot, she was standing with somebody. And it made -- she made a impression that\nshe is giving birth. A big stomach and so -- felling down and looking at me [indecipherable] but I\ncouldn\u2019t -- first of all, I couldn\u2019t go out and I wouldn\u2019t risk that I couldn\u2019t do, and then I couldn\u2019t\nwalk myself. It was very sad, this marching. I had these tied shoes, and even th-that time were --\nwere not pantyhoses, only stockings, remember, and girdles, yes?",

We had some material, we could -- we made ourselves some rucksacks, and they\nthrew on the -- on the road, see loaves of bread. Because before, the day when we left for this\nmarch, somebody opened the storages, the bread storages and they were stealing bread, so some\nof them, but th-throwing everything, even -- even a little clothing, whatever somebody had,\nthrown. Everything was too heavy, was very bad.",

We were two Jewish girls and two Christians. One of\n-- probably was Jewish and she said that she is Christian because people said that she 1s Jewish,\nso I don\u2019t know, but re-regularly were two and two. And he was so nice that he said to the two\nChristian girls, Polish girls, to tell us we shouldn\u2019t say that we are Jewish in front of the soldiers\nor the people because that would be bad for us.

After we left, we -- we -- the train stopped in Berlin, was\nbombed that time. And the women said that they don\u2019t know about Auschwitz. Girls ask, do you\nknow about a place, Auschwitz, where they burn people? No. But then they took us to different\nplaces, train stopped, and we went further, further, because it was no place.

        "A: Bad because no food, only the second day or third day some food, but we didn\u2019t have\ncontainers.

        "A: Yeah, that was [indecipherable]. We didn\u2019t have place where to sleep, it was a big place. We\nsit down, we didn\u2019t have even to -- to sit where. Legs one on the other one and so were very bad.\nAnd they didn\u2019t let us in to drink water, the old ones said we -- we are bringing from Auschwitz\npests. So you cannot come in.

But I -- I didn\u2019t have -- maybe somehow\nunconsciously I had these beliefs but I didn't know about it because I didn\u2019t have to deal with\nreal life. I went home, I have my food, I have my bed, I have my -- my love from my parents,\nfrom my family. So I didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t have to speculate why it\u2019s like that or like that. Life was\nsimple. Was a [indecipherable] yeah, but I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t have my own [indecipherable] and I\nhave to make up my own [indecipherable]",

        "A: Yes. Didn\u2019t have to evaluate them because I was a young girl, could I evaluate older people,\nfor politics or something like that, no.",
        "A: Yes, I wanted to become a teacher.",
        "A: Yes, and after the war I wanted double to be a teacher. Not [indecipherable] so much to teach,\nbut how to behave and didn\u2019t succeed always, not all the students were good, but I tried, I tried.",
        "A: My main subject was home economics.",
        "A: That is family living, that 1s what -- housing and design, that is nutrition and cooking and\nsewing and material. That\u2019s my -- yeah. But in Canada 1s like that, that you don\u2019t -- sorry -- that\nyou don\u2019t stick only to one subject, you teach everything what you need to teach, okay? You\nteach it. So I taught many things. I studied mathematics, which I am not so good in mathematics,\nI couldn\u2019t say, but I didn\u2019t know [indecipherable] taught me, and even physics one time I had to\nteach, lot more. I taught many things, what they needed, yeah, so.",

But they -- everywhere was psychologic, everywhere was psychologic.",
        "A: To understand people, that was my first thing. And I think I master this one, to understand\npeople. I try evaluate people, and then to understand them. That is my main thing in life, toward\npeople.",
        "A: Mostly check. I used to say, you don\u2019t like your -- your -- your day, think about the check. Or\n-- or think about the -- some people work also in a mental hospital. But I -- I used to say really\nwas -- I was joking, that if one -- if only one student understood me, if I changed only one\nstudent, then it was worthwhile everything to study, to teach and so -- to change them, to change\nthem, to -- to -- to give them self confidence -- first of all self confidence, that\u2019s very important.\nAnd self reliance and -- and things like that to -- to help them to -- to make a living, to help them\nto make something about themselves. But then I saw that, that as soon changed, he didn\u2019t believe\nin himself. Sometimes I gave him a better mark, and I implanted into him that he is good. And\nsometimes it worked that he believed in himself. That is the most -- that was the most important\npart to me. And they should respect people and so, but mainly self respect. I used to say, and you\ndon\u2019t respect yourself, nobody will respect you. That was [indecipherable] I believe that\u2019s the\nmain thing.",

        "A: I was a good teacher.",
        "A: People liked me, yeah. Not everybody was -- had discipline in my class, no, because on the\nother side they counted on the that I am soft, maybe, right?",
        "A: Oh that\u2019s right, yes, I couldn\u2019t say for sure I was so respected and so, but they liked me, and\nthey trusted me, yes.",
        "A: Maybe about this lady, it\u2019s amazing, the German lady whom I met. She was lageralteste. This\nwas lagerfuehrer, an SS, and a haftling was lageralteste. She came, I met her, and she said that\nshe was a lagerfuehrerin. In a lager she was an SS, and that she opened the door and she let out\nthe prisoners and so she became a haftling. I mentioned her in my thing. And she -- and so she\nbecame a prisoner. Then I didn\u2019t see -- see her too much. And we discussed with her -- I suppose\nI spoke to her, discussed about human relations, among human feelings, about beha -- humanly\nto behave. And she said, it\u2019s very easy outside to behave humanly, according to etiquette, and\naccording to -- to -- to rules, human rules. But here it\u2019s very difficult, because first of all, we\nhave to think about ourselves, yes. Was difficult. So that outside I am very -- she said, outside in\nthe world, people move with masks on their faces. They smile, they speak nicely, it seems that\nthey care about themselves. But here you have to talk, you have to think about yourself. So it 1s\nnot so difficult that here you see the human being as it is -- as he is, as he is. There it is a mask.\nIt\u2019s a play. Outside, the world is a play, in lager --",
        "A: -- 1s the real human being. Y-You show yourself -- you present yourself as you really are.\nYou don\u2019t try to cover up yourself. However, who -- how is -- whoever -- how he is, so he -- he\npresents himself. That\u2019s the real life, that\u2019s school.",
        "A: That\u2019s true.",
        "A: That\u2019s true, that\u2019s true. Yes, it\u2019s very true.",
        "A: No, nothing [indecipherable]",
        "A: There you learn how to face people, how to understand people, you search in them how they\nare and you take them how they are. You understand them how they are. Not difficult.\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Outside, well, there are people which they -- which they try to -- to -- to present themselves\nbetter than they are.",
        "A: It\u2019s hard for them to change, they should be really as they think that they have to be, or they\nwant to be seen. Understand that?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s the mask. You have to take off the mask and --",
        "A: -- be real, yeah, and try to help and don\u2019t wait anything for -- somehow for a -- a reward.\nNobody has to thank me that I helped somebody [indecipherable]. I do it myself. I did it and it is,\nyes. No, it -- not for money, nor for favors, nothing. Yeah, you see [indecipherable]. And you\ncannot change people totally. You can adjust -- you cannot change too much, you have to try,\nyeah. You cannot change all that -- we say that you cannot change all that, well you change, you\nknow, you cannot. Exterior, you cannot change, you have to change your other, yourself.",
        "A: Inside, yes. And maybe you influence people this way, yes. You treat somebody nicely, he\nhas to be also nice, no? You be rough to somebody, or he will be rough, or he turns away from\nyou, you know?",
        "A: I think so. Life\u2019s not easy, but you have to manage, you know, right?",
        "A: Thanks. But it was something that I had to do. I had to do. And I think that I will feel more\nfree. Not free that -- not surrounded by fences, but free that I said what I had to say, yes. It was\nmany times my wish that everybody for the whole world should stay here for one night and for\none day and then to go home, to see how life is here [indecipherable] America.",
