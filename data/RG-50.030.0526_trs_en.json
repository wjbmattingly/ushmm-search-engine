        "Question: Good morning, Mr. Shipper.",
        "Answer: Good morning to you.",
        "Q: Thank you very much for agreeing to be interviewed with us today.",
        "A: Now, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s my pleasure and it\u2019s an honor to come to the United States, you know, to be\ninterviewed. So, I\u2019m only too pleased to be here.",
        "Q: Well, we\u2019re glad to have you. Tell me if you would your -- the name you were born with and\nwhat town you were born in.",
        "A: I -- my name is -- originally was Zygmund Shipper. Now it is Ziggy Shipper, you know,\nbecause in England Zygmund would have been a problem, you know, with pronunciation and --\nbut it was -- it\u2019s Shipper now and it was Shipper originally, except the spelling was different, it\nwas S-zed-y-p-e-r and now it\u2019s S-h-1- double p -e-r. The reason, my wife decided when we got\nmarried, because when we had children they had problems at school, you know, is it Zyper, 1s it\nZipper? So we thought the best thing is that we change the spelling, and we did. Now, I was born\nin a city, second biggest city in Poland, called Lodz, L-o-d-zed, and that\u2019s where I lived til I was\ndeported from Lodz.",
        "Q: And you were born in 1930, is that correct?",
        "A: I was born, yes, 18\" of January, 1930.",
        "Q: And tell me a little about your parents.",
        "A: Well, unfortunately my parents, you know -- I come from a very Orthodox family, Jewish\nOrthodox family and my parents were divorced and my mother left me with my father and my\ngrandparents. And with a Jewish family in the 1930\u2019s Orthodox, divorce was as bad as death, or\neven worse, you know. It was such a terrible thing for a Jewish family, you know. So as far as I\nknew, you know, after awhile, you know, I -- I thought my mother was dead, and I didn\u2019t see my\nmother and that was it. So I was just left with my grandparents, of course, and my father, which\nmy father worked, so I didn\u2019t see that much of him either. But my grandmother, as far as I can\nremember, she was a wonderful woman and I owe her so much that I wish I could have told her\nthat when I grew up, but unfortunately there was no chance of that.",
        "Q: Yeah. Would you like to tell me your grandparents\u2019 names and where they were from?",
        "A: My grandfather was Itzhak Szypers, he was from Lodz. My grandmother came from a place\ncalled Zdunska Wola, and her name was Esther Berger, before she has a ma -- her maiden name,\nbefore she got married. I had -- she had six children. Unfortunately, two of my aunts died well\nbefore the war. One aunt was left and I also -- my father had two brothers, which were in the --\nwith me all the -- well, not with me, but they were -- they were in the -- in Lodz.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, so you had an extended family --",
        "A: [had an extended family, yes, and my father and one of my uncles and my grandfather\nworked in the same business, they had their own business in -- import business of chemical\nmaterials. And the other uncle was an engineer, he had his own business, you know, he worked.\nSo in a way, I think, from what I know now that we had a -- a reasonable comfortable life, you\nknow, I -- I remember having enou -- my own bedroom, which is almost unheard. But I suppose\nbecause we lived in a big city, it was a second -- as I said, second biggest city in Poland, and you\nknow, there was a million inhabitants before the war, and 25 percent, like 240,000 were Jewish\npeople. I went to a Jewish school, you know, I -- it wasn\u2019t a cheder or a Orthodox school, it was\na Jewish school, but we learned Hebrew much more so than -- we didn't learn the Bible or things\nlike that. Hebrew we learned and -- and all the other things that children of six, seven, eight\nlearn, you know, it was -- it was almost a normal life I had. I don\u2019t -- after awhile I don\u2019t think I\nmissed that I haven\u2019t got my mother, you know, really. I was -- maybe I was too young too,\nbecause my grandmother was -- was a -- certainly a very good substitute for a mother, you know.",
        "Q: Was your grandfather working when you were small, too?",
        "A: Yes. He was in the business with my -- where my father was there, and my uncle, the three of\nthem worked in the business, you know.",
        "Q: What was the name of the business, do you know?",
        "A: Szyper and sin, you know. Father and son, the name of the father and just son, it\u2019s like it\nwould be here Berger and sons, limited, that company.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. They were importing chemicals for -- do you know what --",
        "A: Yes, soda and those big bottles of -- of different acids and things like that, you know?",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: All I remember, my father had to wear goggles and gloves, you know, to protect, because it\nwas coming on trains, you know, the -- their place was on a railway sidings. So they --",
        "Q: They had a warehouse?",
        "A: Oh yes, a very big warehouse, you know, and that\u2019s what I can remember.",
        "Q: Right. And your school was all Jewish children?",
        "A: All Jewish children, the school I went to.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And did you like school, were you happy in school?",
        "A: As far as I remember, yes, you know, I -- I -- I wa -- there was no choice anyway and at -- I\nthink so. I -- you know, it\u2019s going back 70 years. I should imagine that I did like school.",
        "Q: And -- and you were born in 1930, so you grew up throughout the 1930\u2019s in Poland.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Any -- anything remarkable that you remember in those early years before 1939 about your\nlife, or was it just --",
        "A: N-No, I mean -- I didn\u2019t come across -- you see, that\u2019s -- the thing was that the school was in\nthe same building at -- where we lived, you see? It was a small school and so I didn\u2019t come\nacross anti-Semitism as much as other children that had to go in the street in school and non-Jew,\nyou know, Polish kids, so -- and they used to throw stones at them, and so on and call them\nnames and there were always fights. I guess I wasn\u2019t out that much, only played in the yard with\nother children, even with Poles. Course, lots of times, you know, there were anti-Semitic\nremarks, but there -- 1t didn\u2019t mean that much to me, I didn\u2019t quite understand what it meant, you\nknow, why are they calling me dirty Jew, or something like that. You see, which they did, you\nknow, in Polish.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But it -- it -- I had no problems about, you know, possibly, you know, when you\u2019re six, seven,\neight years old, I don\u2019t think any child has problems, they just fight. If it wouldn\u2019t be with them,\nmost probably they would have fought amongst each other, you know, whether were they Jewish\nkids or non-Jewish kids.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you ever travel anywhere?",
        "A: Ah, no. I have -- the only place we went, we -- we traveled to a place called Columnow,\nwhich was sort of a s -- not a seaside because we weren\u2019t on the sea. You know, there wa -- there\nwas a lake and you know, and I remember going swimming, you know, we went away, sort of. I\ndon\u2019t know what month it was, whether it was July or August, because Poland gets very cold in\nthe winter, but very hot in the summer, you know, and I remember going there as a child and\nhaving a good time, you know? I -- on the whole, I think I had a good life, you know, til 19 -- til\nSeptember 1939, you know.",
        "Q: Did you live in a part of town where there were mostly Jews then?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No, I lived in a -- in one of the main st -- roads in -- in Lodz, you know, it\u2019s funny enough, I\nwent to visit it first time I went back to Poland. And even -- it was a nice apartment and 1 -- ik --\nwe even had a -- we lived on a second floor, we -- as I said, we -- I had my own bedroom, you\nknow, and we had a balcony, you know, and -- you know, even when I showed it to my\ndaughters when I went back to Poland, I couldn't believe it, you know, I mean, because, you\nknow, everybody -- well, not everybody, most people Is -- in England, and I don\u2019t know how it\nis in the U.S. think that everybody lived like \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u2019 in a little shtetl. It wasn't, you\nknow. Warsaw, Krakow, Lodz, you know, they were big cities, and you know there were -- there\nwere poor areas, naturally, and there were sort of not so much affluent areas. But there were the\nareas, you know, which all apartments. There was no small houses or something like that, that\nwas all apartments. But I mean, you know, it -- it is just unbelievable. When I tell my friends,\nthey don\u2019t even want to believe that we had a telephone.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: You see, I-I\u2019m -- not that I spoke on the telephone, I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t know how to dial it\neven, you know, and --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So it was -- it -- it -- as I said, I think it -- we had a good life, as I had a good life as a child.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Had wonderful gr -- well, parents almost, they weren\u2019t parents, but grandparents. As I said,\nmy father I didn\u2019t see that much, you know, because he worked all day and I suppose he had his\nown life to lead. But he knew that he left me with good -- and so I s-suppose my mother must\nhave known that she is leaving me with -- you know.",
        "Q: Did your mother ever come back to visit?",
        "A: My mother came back once, and I still remember that. I don\u2019t know whether I was six years\nold, five years old, you know, don\u2019t know exactly. And I c -- I wouldn\u2019t go to her and I\nscreamed. I even hit her or scratched her or something like that. I -- I just -- I don\u2019t know why.\nYou know, today I think back, why did I do it, I --",
        "Q: Did you know who she was, or did --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know who she was, but she says I\u2019m your mother and maybe that\u2019s what -- you know,\nmaybe I thought how could you be my mother if my mother is dead, you know, and so on. I --\nyou know, I tried to analyze it -- I did years ago to analyze it, which you can\u2019t, you know, but no,\nI wasn't happy to see her and when she left I didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t mean anything to me, I mean, she\nleft and I think that\u2019s it, I\u2019ll never see her again, and --",
        "Q: Did you know -- was there -- do you know why she left? Did you ever hear --",
        "A: No. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s one of my regrets, you know, that I never knew why she left, you know? I --\nlook, when you sort of -- especially when you grow up and you\u2019re 13 - 14 and you see other\npeople with mothers and fathers, you know, and -- and you think to yourself, how could she\nleave me? But of course you get older and you realize things are not that simple, you know, that\nthere must have been a good reason why she left.",
        "Q: Well tell me now about the late 30\u2019s and -- and how did you notice things starting to change\nin your life?",
        "A: Well, in -- in about 19 -- I would say 1938 there was a lot of talk about war. You know, eight\nyear old boy, I mean, what did I know about war? I didn\u2019t even mean -- didn\u2019t realize what it\nmeans there\u2019s a war. And they said, you know, Germany and the Germans will come in and they\n-- | [indecipherable] and this was carry on like that til 1939, you know, and then 1939, you know,\nin September \u201939, one morning I was in bed, you know, my father came to me and he said he has\nto go away. And I said, why are you going away, you know? So I says -- I thought to myself,\nnow here a mother I haven\u2019t got, now I won\u2019t even have a father. Oh no, he says, don\u2019t worry at\nall, Pll be back within six months because there\u2019s going to be a war and the German armies are\ngoing to invade Poland and the first thing they will do is take all the young men away, you know,\nbut you and your grandmother and grandfather and the children a -- they will -- won\u2019t touch\nthem, it\u2019s only the young people. Of course, he couldn\u2019t have been more wrong, but nevertheless\nhe left and I never saw my father again. He run away to Russia and I suppose conditions in\nRussia were not that good either because at that time the Russians already were together with the\nGermans, they split up Poland in half, you know, some part went to Russia and so on. So he\ndecided to come back, and he managed to get to Warsaw, because Warsaw was by then -- the\nwhole of Poland was already occupied by the Germans or by the Russians. But Warsaw was a\noccupied part of Poland by the Germans. L6dz was part of Germany, they annexed it. That\u2019s the\nThird Reich. So he couldn\u2019t get back to us, you see? But that\u2019s what I had found out, later. But\n\u00b039 when he left, you know, and within a few weeks, of course, the German armies came in and\nthings completely changed straight away.",
        "Q: Do you remember that, when --",
        "A: Oh yes. I remember certain things, not everything. I-I -- I hadn\u2019t seen it, but everybody was\ntalking about it, first of all, as soon as they came in they destroyed most of the synagogues in --\nin -- in Poland, in Lodz especially, you know. And -- and you know, to -- to a -- to a child, even\nnine year old, you know, being brought up as -- in a very Orthodox family, you know, to destroy\na synagogue is -- 1s the most terrible thing that could happen. But of course everything changed,\nyou know. We -- we weren\u2019t allowed to travel on normal transport like on trams. We had trams\nin Lodz, we couldn\u2019t travel on trams. I found out because I never traveled on trains, you know,\nbut you couldn\u2019t travel on a train. Jewish doctors couldn\u2019t practice medicine, Jewish teachers\ncouldn\u2019t go to school. And of course, there was no school, you know. I left school when I was --\nin June. That\u2019s where they had stopped it in -- in Poland at the time and I was about nine and a\nhalf years old, and I never went back to school. That was my education in life. And every day\ndifferent things happened. I mean, ya -- you know, we couldn\u2019t -- we weren\u2019t allowed to walk --\nnot that people came out of [indecipherable] they were too frightened to come out, but you know\nyou\u2019ve got to eat, you\u2019ve got to buy food. And food was scarce because Jewish shops weren\u2019t\nopened, they closed them up. We weren\u2019t even allowed to walk on pavements, you know. But of\ncourse children like my age, you know, we got away with it, we walked. But the thing was, you\nknow, they called a je -- a -- a Jewish man, you know, with the long beard, which they knew he\nwas a Jew, you could recognize the Jewish people that were Orthodox, especially in -- in Lodz.\nThey used to -- first thing they did, you know, took out the beard off and I -- and I asked why are\nthey doing, you know, I didn\u2019t ask the Germans, I asked my grandmother, why do they do that?\nThey said, purely to humiliate him, you know, because they know it\u2019s the most terrible thing to\nhave that beard cut off. And then they made him wash the pavement, for no reason at all, just to\ndegrade him, to humiliate him, to -- and you know, you\u2019re not even 10 years old, you cannot\nunderstand why and you keep asking question and there is like always, there\u2019s -- there\u2019s no\nanswers why.",
        "Q: Did anything like that happen specifically to your grandfather?",
        "A: No. My grandfather didn\u2019t go out, you see, and he was at home and food was very, very\nscarce and he was getting weaker and weaker and -- and -- because he wouldn\u2019t eat that food that\nwasn\u2019t kosher and kosher food was almost impossible to get. So he lived on bread an-and\npotatoes and things like that, you could still get some. But it was getting more and more difficult\nand then they decided, you know, to recognize every Jew that is not recognizable, we have to\nwear a Star of David and in -- in some places, like in [indecipherable] they used to wear one in\nthe front. We had to wear one in the front and the back so that the minute th-they saw you they --\nthey knew who you were, so you get beaten up, especially the older people, not -- you know, and\nthe children started stealing food wherever they could, you know, to bring home.",
        "Q: Did you do that?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Was your grandmother then going out to get food or try to find food --",
        "A: Yes, when she --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- had to, I -- there was no choice.",
        "Q: And would you with her when you --",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember me ever going with her, you know, but we were out, you know. When I say\nstealing food, there was a lot of trees with apples and pears and plums and things like that, you\nknow, whatever there was at that time of the year. You know, we used to go and st-steal and we\nused to get beaten up, but you know, but when you s -- nine, 10 years old, it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a game more\nthan anything else, so we didn't mind, you know, we got beaten up, so we went next day again\nan-and bring home something, you know, and --",
        "Q: So she didn\u2019t try to keep you in the house?",
        "A: Not that I can tell. I\u2019m sure she tried, but you know -- you know what that 10 year old child\nis, 1t\u2019s -- you know, he goes anyway, you know. She turns around and he\u2019s out, you know, it\u2019s --\nand that\u2019s what I did, you know. A-And then it\u2019s by November of 1939 we were told, you know,\nI -- I was told by my grandmother, you know, we\u2019ve got to leave our apartment. We\u2019ve got to\nmove to a certain area of Lodz, which was the poorest area of Lodz, which was called Baluty,\nyou know, it\u2019s funny enough, a lot of Jewish people lived there before the war, you see. And of\ncourse, a lot of Polish people lived -- now the Poles had to move out of their apartments and we\nhad to move into theirs. Now, the Poles were very happy about it, because they moved into a\ngood area, a nice apartment, nice furniture, because we couldn\u2019t take much with us, you know,\nand out of the three bedroom apartment we had with a bathroom, you know, a -- we managed my\n-- and I had an aunt also living with us, and the four of us moved into one single room on a\nsecond floor in a -- in a tenement building with stone steps. And it was already November, it was\ngetting very cold. In November it\u2019s full blown winter in Poland and no running water, no toilet\nor everything. And the four of us had one single room, no kitchen, no nothing, you know, and --",
        "Q: Do you remember going there?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember how -- how was your grandmother and grandfather, how were they notified\nand -- and do you remember that moment when they were notified?",
        "A: No, no. All I remember is going on a horse and cart, you know, with a bit of things we had to\ntake with us, you know, we\u2019ve -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t even know how we found it, that -- that\napartment, but all I remember is living there.",
        "Q: And did you go -- was it far from where you lived?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: And you had to go across town?",
        "A: The other side of town, right across town.",
        "Q: Did you go with other people, or do you remember seeing people on the streets?",
        "A: Oh yes, there was a whole lot of people going all the time, from morning til night, moving\nthere. I don\u2019t even know how we found, whether we were offered that place, or we were\nallocated that place. I don\u2019t know, that I cannot remember. Maybe I was too young to -- to know.\nBut I know where it was, I remember the name, the street, the number, the second floor, and --",
        "Q: What was the street?",
        "A: Limanowskiego 26. And it was, the thing was, you see, by April the whole -- everybody in\nLodz had to be -- if he was caught outside the ghetto, he was shot. So by that they surrounded\nwith barbed wire. They had -- we had our own Jewish police and a Jewish sort of committee,\ngovernment thing with a -- with a leader of that. His name, I\u2019m sure you know, was Rumkowsk1.\nAnd -- but the street where I lived they had a problem because how would they go from -- the\nGermans or the Poles go from one side of town to the other? So two streets were blocked -- were\n-- the actual road was outside the ghetto with barbed wires. And for us to cross -- we had the\nbridge, or two bridges to cross from one side -- because I worked on the other side, we had to\ncross on a bridge. So they -- which was, in a way for -- for us 1t was lucky, because what was\nhappening, when lorries with food and potatoes or carrots or something, they weren\u2019t in sacks,\nthey were loose -- or they [indecipherable], so, you know, you soon find ways, so we had long\nwires and we used to try to hook them onto the lorries when they were passing, or a horse and\ncart, and move that thing and they fell down and eventually we could get some potatoes or\nwhatever was on the [indecipherable] we had -- we had to try to steal things. But the worst thing\nwas, winter came and you know, we had to go downstairs to fetch water, you know, to pump\nactually water and to carry up [indecipherable] and that I still remember. I remember falling\ndown because it was all frozen, you know, and it was slippery from the water, you know, and --",
        "Q: And that was your job, to go get the water?",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t my job, but somebody had to do it. My grandfather could -- certainly couldn\u2019t\ndo it because he was already too ill and, you know, within a very short time he died, in 1940.\nAnd purely from -- from -- I think he had a broken heart because he was so religious and he so\nhad -- even -- even the rabbis came and they said, you know, you can eat anything, because you\nknow, life is more important than anything else. But he wouldn\u2019t and he -- he died from\nmalnutrition and -- and everything else. So it was just left my aunt still there an-and she died\nsoon afterwards as well, and it was just my grandmother and I, and then they said, you know, we\neach could get the ration card, but you had to work. If you didn\u2019t work, you didn\u2019t get the ration\ncard. I was about 10 and a half when I started working in a metal factory.",
        "Q: Before we get to the metal factory, tell me something about when your grandfather died. Did -\n- did you take him -- there was a cemetery\u201d?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: There was a cemetery in -- which 1s even there today. You know, there was a cemetery just a -\n- just outside but it was still in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Right at the end of town, there was a Jewish cemetery there. Because as I said too, you know,\nbefore the war there was a lot of Jewish people living in that area, in the poor area, you know,\nand of course so they had a cemetery.",
        "Q: And did someone come and get his body and take him there --",
        "A: Oh yes --",
        "Q: -- or did you have to do that?",
        "A: -- yeah, it was a proper, it was a proper -- at that time still, in 1940, yes, proper --",
        "Q: So that --",
        "A: -- everybody that died in the ghetto was buried there.",
        "Q: And then there was a service of any kind?",
        "A: That I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I honestly don\u2019t remember a servi -- I\u2019m sure there must have been something, and as I said, I\n-- one of my uncles was in the ghetto. You see, my father wasn\u2019t, but one of my uncles was in\nthe ghetto, so I\u2019m sure he was there that could say kaddishim, you know, but I don\u2019t remember it.\nI -- I certainly wasn\u2019t at the funeral. Why? Because I would say the first time I went to a funeral\nwas in -- in London, in England. So I am sure I wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t.",
        "A: I would have remembered.",
        "Q: Yeah. But -- so it would have been your grandmother and your aunt, maybe.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Would you tell me your aunt\u2019s name so we --",
        "A: Genya Szyper.",
        "Q: Genya. And how was she related to your grandparents?",
        "A: She -- she was a daughter.",
        "Q: Oh, your father\u2019s sister?",
        "A: Sim -- a sister, yes, as I said to you in the beginning, there were three sisters, two died before\nthe war, and one remained, and that was the one that remained.",
        "Q: And she was single?",
        "A: Single, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. Younger than your father?",
        "A: Yes. She was the youngest in the family.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you know how old she would have been, ro-roughly?",
        "A: I honestly don\u2019t know, but she must have been pretty young, be -- I know my father was born\nin 1900, and that means he would have been 40 in -- when I was in the ghetto with my aunt and\nmy grandparents at the time. So she could have been -- she must have died when she was about, I\ndon\u2019t know, 38 or something like, I do -- 35, you know --",
        "Q: And -- and you think it was also malnutrition like your grandfather?",
        "A: Malnutrition also, and I remember she had a boyfriend. I remember then, as a young kid like\nthat, I remember she had a boyfriend and then they split up, something, and she was also -- I\ndon\u2019t think she wanted to live, you know. The circumstances we lived in, you know, and she had\nnothing to live for, you know, and -- and -- and unfortunately she also died, and -- and --",
        "Q: That winter?",
        "A: Winter, oh yes.",
        "Q: The first winter?",
        "A: Oh yes, the first winter, yes.",
        "Q: Your grandmother must have been a strong person.",
        "A: She was, you know, I mean you\u2019ve got to remember women in -- in Poland and Russia and\neastern Europe, you know, before the war, they were hard working. When I think back, you\nknow, to bring up six children, you know, without -- without help. We had no maids or help.\nYou know, to bring up six children, to -- to cook and wash and as you, I\u2019m sure you know, in\nPoland, you know, a lot of food, you know, you made yourself. You didn\u2019t go to shop to buy you\nknow, you know. Like vermicelli, you know, [indecipherable] you know, you -- you made\nyourself. I remember that. And -- and even the challahs, you know, you baked yourself, and you\nknow, I just -- and I -- all I know is I think my -- my grandmother already had the first child\nwhen she was 16 years old because in them days in Poland, when you were 20 and you weren\u2019t\nmarried, you were already on the shelf, you know, it was a stigma. How come you don\u2019t just --\nnot married, or something like that. So no, she -- she must have be -- you wouldn\u2019t, if you looked\nat her, and I look at her picture now and I think she couldn\u2019t have been that strong, but she was.",
        "Q: We need to take a little break and change tapes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And we\u2019ll come back in a minute.",
        "A: That\u2019s quite all right.",
        "Q: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: W-We were talking about your grandmother before we took a break and I -- I just want to ask\nyou one other question about her. W-Was she -- did she -- was she optimistic in any way? Was\nshe giving you hope throughout this period, and was she the strong one in the --",
        "A: It was -- absolutely, she was -- she -- she never thought oh, we\u2019ll get killed, or we will not\nsurvive. It was always, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t believe what she was telling me, but she\nalways, oh, it won\u2019t last long, itll get better, and so on. And I think this is also a Jewish trait, you\nknow, of it\u2019ll get better, don\u2019t worry, you know, an-and the usual thing you know, with Jewish\npeople, you know, next week, next -- you know, and -- and God will see to it and so on and so\non. No, she was -- she wa -- I don\u2019t know, like I said, whether she was optimistic or she was just\ntalking to me as a child, you know.",
        "Q: Right. When you were in the ghetto, you got a job in a metal factory.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, tell me about that job.",
        "A: It was -- we were producing all different things for the German war effort, you know, an-and\nthere were different groups. I was assigned to a group that we were producing little metal things\nthat were going onto shoes, you know, so that the soles, and you know, and -- and the heels, to\nlast, there were some little s -- round things to put on the soles so that they should last, the shoes\nshould last longer, you shouldn\u2019t wear them out as quick as that. So it was two of us, one was\nputting things into a wooden things, six of them, and the other one was making holes into them,\nyou know what --",
        "Q: With a -- with a press?",
        "A: With a press, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. You were 10 years old.",
        "A: I was 10 and a half, you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Is that --",
        "A: You know ac -- you know, ya -- this you get sa -- no, it wasn\u2019t a question that I a -- I had to\nwork because if I didn\u2019t work then there was no ration card, there was no food. Whatever little\nfood we had, I had to obtain on my ration card. At work we worked like six days a week from\nwhat, I don\u2019t know, seven to seven or something, and there was nightshifts as well, which I\ndidn\u2019t work and lunch time we used to get a soup and -- to keep us going and so on, and I had a\nvery good man that I worked for, that he was the boss of the group of about, I don\u2019t know, 20 or\nso. And he was very good, he tried to look after me for a certain -- to a certain extent, you know.\nWhen he thought that I -- I can\u2019t do it, you know, because I\u2019m so tired, he says go underneath the\nbench and sleep for an hour and so on. Because there was no -- we weren\u2019t surrounded by\nGermans, you know, it was all done by Jews. Everything was Jewish, you know, whether it was\ndoctors or hospital, or whatever, you know. But unfortunately, the food that we were -- were\ngetting, even with the rations, every month, you know, it got worse and worse, or less and less,\nand people are dying of malnutrition and -- and of course, frost and -- 1t was that cold. You\nknow, when the summer came, of course it was a bit better. But every morning we used to go to\nwork, and -- you know and we were -- had to step over dead bodies, cause they didn\u2019t have a\nchance yet -- they had a special group of people that were taking the bodies away and then taking\nit to the -- I suppose there were mass graves, you know.",
        "Q: You mean -- are bodies in the street?",
        "A: In the street, yes, we had to just go walk over them almost, to go to work, and you know, you\nget so immune, you know, that you just don\u2019t care any more.",
        "Q: And where -- where was the factory? Where did you go to work?",
        "A: The factory was about on the other side, as I said to you we ha -- I had to cross the bridge and\nit wasn\u2019t that far, 1t was about 20 minutes, half an hour to walk to the factory. It was a very big\nfactory.",
        "Q: Did your mother go, or I mean, your grandmother go as well?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. She --",
        "Q: Did you go by yourself? You walked --",
        "A: -- I -- yes, oh yes. I -- you were quite safe, you know, as far as walking in the ghetto, you\nknow, you had no problems there, you know. But unfortunately, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s the -- the\nmain thing there was the food and -- and the conditions we lived in. And, you know, by the time\nwe -- we went into the ghetto we were about 150,000, eventually finished with 70,000. But\npeople were dying. Also people that were coming in and sending -- they said we need 5,000\npeople to go out to work, you know, in -- in labor camps. Which wasn\u2019t true, we found out later\nbecause the people that were taken, you know, they were like -- but the problem was they took\npeople out so that you thought there was more room. But then what the Germans did, the S -- the\nNazis, the SS or whoever they were, they were liquidating all the small ghettos because they said\nit\u2019s useless having more guards to guarding small ghettos, we\u2019ll take those people and send them\nto the bigger camp -- ghettoes like Lodz or Warsaw or whatever there was. So every time they\nsent people in, you know, from other ghettoes, so it was -- it was never enough room for people\nto -- to -- to exist, to live, to --",
        "Q: Did you n -- did you know that at the time, did you know that people were coming from other\nghettos? Were you talking to people, or --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, they sat and you know, they told us how bad it is there. They didn\u2019t realize how\nmuch worse it is in our ghetto, because Lodz was -- Lodz and Warsaw was one of the worst\nghettos in Poland you know, because [indecipherable] was -- a small ghetto was not, but we were\nso overcrowded, you know, and -- and like I said, overcrowded. In the winter it was cold, in the\nsummer -- I don\u2019t know what was worse, because disease in the summer was worse, you know.\nLuckily that -- that at least we had enough water to wash.",
        "Q: And how was your health? Did you get sick?",
        "A: Well, as far as I know, all the years I was in the ghetto, I wasn\u2019t ill. I had no problem with\nillness. I was problem with lack of food. I was -- you know, 1 -- hunger is a funny thing. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter how much you eat, you\u2019re still hungry, because it\u2019s all in your mind most of the\ntime. You know, even when I had -- when we used to go out sort of near the outskirts of the\nghetto, you know, and there was some stuff we could steal, you know, and -- so we used to go, a\nfew of the kids used to go out and you know, then we were either at the borders, you know, of it\n-- of -- where the barbed wire, you were hit by the Germans, or the Jewish police culture, you\nknow, we were sort of -- have the -- our jackets or shirts inside the trousers, so that we could put\nthe food away there and they caught us, they just opened it up and the food came out. We got a\ngood hiding and we run back home and that was it. But then -- but they didn\u2019t stop us going\nagain, you know. But if -- there were times, of course, that we managed to get home with some\nfood and we had so much food, and -- but we were still -- it doesn\u2019t matter how much we had,\nwe were hungry.",
        "Q: Yeah. In the Lodz ghetto they were rounding up children too, weren't they?",
        "A: Well yeah, of course.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yes, but the worst thing was -- you see, was in -- I think it was 1942, the Germans decided\nthey need 10,000 people, you know, a day or something like that, something -- an enormous\namount of people --",
        "Q: Right, yeah.",
        "A: -- and they\u2019Il do it in a week and they\u2019ll take them away, so most of the people they would\nhave taken away. But I asked the -- which I don\u2019t think it could have been 10,000, but they said -\n- the Jewish police have to go and give them every day so many people to bring out. But of\ncourse they came to the -- to the Jewish homes and they got beaten up by the people. Nobody\nwould have given away people, you know, nobody would go. And then the Jews -- so the\nGermans said there is no way they can do it, so they said they are going to do it themselves, and -",
        "Q: Did they ever come to your place?",
        "A: Oh yes. Not the Jewish police, I don\u2019t remember them coming, but the Germans said right,\nwe're going to do it systematically, nobody\u2019s going to work for a whole week. And from\nMonday onwards, you know, they went from street to street, house to house and everybody had\nto come down and they took people away and they said they\u2019re taking them to work. But you\nknow, as young as I was, you know, I -- I realized, you know, you don\u2019t take people to work that\nare disabled people, old people, women and children. And my grandmother was hidden\nsomewhere and I went down and they took me, they slung me on the lorry and it was a similar\nscene, funny enough, like in \u201cSchindler\u2019s List.\u201d And I -- I don\u2019t know why it was so bad and I\nwas alone, I s -- I would have thought why did I want to escape? Maybe because I thought to\nmyself I\u2019ll be alone and I wanted to be back with my grandmother and I jumped off the lorry.\nAnd the Germans were inside the yard, you know, had they stepped out they would have seen\nme, they would have shot. I\u2019m sure they would have hit me because I wouldn't have been that far\naway. Anyway, I -- I was lucky once again and I run and I hid myself in the house and I stayed\nthere for hours. And I remember a distant cuz -- well, it -- a distant cousin came and he also\nescaped, also jumped off the lorry and he escape and I remember -- I remember like today and he\nsays, come on, let\u2019s go home, cause we lived in the same sort of block or yard or something. And\nI started screaming at him, I was in such a state, you know. Eventually, of course, I did. But the\nfunny thing was, it --",
        "Q: What did you scream?",
        "A: I just screamed at him that why he said to me we should go back home, I was -- I don\u2019t know,\nI was -- my mind was completely -- I was completely confused, you know, and -- but a funny\nthing happened that that boy, that cousin of mine was the only one of his family that survived,\nand not so ma -- and he was very religious. And -- and he became the chief rabbi of Poland.\nAbout 10 years ago he was a -- or 15 years ago, a chief rabbi of Poland. He lived in Jerusalem,\nbut --",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Joskovich. And anyway, I went back and after awhile things went back to as it was, you\nknow, my grandmother came back and --",
        "Q: Where had she gone?",
        "A: She went to hiding somewhere, I don\u2019t know where.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know where? Not in a building?",
        "A: No, it must have been from my uncle, you know, I don\u2019t honestly know. May -- could have\nbeen in a basement somewhere.",
        "Q: But when you -- when they took -- came to take people away, she was -- she was gone?",
        "A: She wasn\u2019t there, she was gone, you know, she sha --",
        "Q: And you had come home and found that she was gone?",
        "A: And -- no, she wasn\u2019t there, but I knew she was in hiding.",
        "Q: And why didn\u2019t you go to hiding?",
        "A: I -- there was no way I could go, for some -- I don\u2019t know what the reason it was, but I wasn\u2019t\n-- | didn\u2019t go into hiding and --",
        "Q: And the Germans came and physically dragged you out?",
        "A: Oh yeah -- no, we had to go downstairs, they didn\u2019t come. Everybody had to leave and they\nsearched the rooms, you know, and downstairs they said they just picked up people and -- and --\nand I saw women, children, disabled people, it\u2019s not -- something is not right, and this was the\nreason it made me jump -- jumped off the lorry, and you know, and -- and we found out later,\nyou know, we never had all those people again, so we knew that they were -- where they were\ntaken I don\u2019t know, but they were certainly -- at that time there was no Auschwitz yet -- you\nknow, I mean there was Auschwitz because Auschwitz was built much earlier, but 1t wasn\u2019t built\nfor Jews, it was built for Polish prisoners of war, you know, and certainly Birkenau wasn\u2019t in\nexistence. And you know, in -- within two days we went back to work and we carried on and --\nand things got worse and worse and worse, til it carried on like that til 1944.",
        "Q: Two -- three years.",
        "A: Mm -- well, I was -- from 1940 til 1944, you know, was --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- April 1940 the ghetto was shut, you know, and it\u2019s liquidated in autumn of 1944.",
        "Q: Were there other deportations that you escaped? I mean --",
        "A: Not from Lodz, no. I never escaped another deportation, Lodz or otherwise, you know, it --\nbut when they liquidated the ghetto it was automatically -- but where I was -- you see, I -- I don\u2019t\nknow, in my life I always seem to have been lucky. And were -- the factory that I worked for, the\nmetal factory, when we -- the Lodz ghetto was liquidated because they said the Russians are\ngetting nearer, and we\u2019ve got to -- they\u2019re going to send us to working camps inside Germany,\nand so street by street, day by day, they were taking away peop -- people had to report to the\nrailway station and they were allowed to take one suitcase. They said when we get there we get\nmore clothes and all the rest of it. But me, they didn\u2019t take -- they didn\u2019t tell us to come from the\nhouse where I lived then, but from the factory, because I said they were going to take us to\nGermany and we\u2019re going to work in a metal factory there. Which the funny thing was that it\nwas true. We didn\u2019t reach Germany to work in a factory, but that was the intention.",
        "Q: This factory -- the fellow you mentioned who ran the factory, say his name, because he was\nvery important to you.",
        "A: Well, th-the man that -- that saved my life --",
        "Q: Yes --",
        "A: -- twice --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- you know, he saved my life, his name was Zilbershatz. And also a funny thing that a\nnephew of his is a friend of mine today, he lives in London, you know. And the man also\nsurvived the war, the one, Willie Zilbershatz, he lived in Israel. Unfortunately I never managed\nto see him because by the time I went the first time to Israel, he was -- he died. But I am very\nmuch in touch with his nephew and -- you know, and --",
        "Q: Did you know very much about him before he had this factory in the ghetto? Did he --",
        "A: Well, he didn\u2019t have a factory, he was just in charge of that group. It was a very big factory. It\nwas -- somebody else was in charge of the whole factory, his name was Hemovich.",
        "Q: I see, 1t wasn\u2019t his factory.",
        "A: No, no, no, it wasn't his factory, it was -- 1t was nobody\u2019s factory, it belonged to the ghetto,\nyou know, it belonged to the Germans really. I don\u2019t know what it was before the war, whether it\nwas a factory before the war and who owned it.",
        "Q: So he was the manager.",
        "A: He was the manager and you know, they had groups, managers of each, you know, like 20\npeople worked in one group and -- and that man Zilbershatz was in charge of that group that I\nworked for.",
        "Q: Was he a young man? He --",
        "A: Yes, oh yes, he must have been about 30 at the most, you know. You know, to me he wasn\u2019t a\nyoung man, you know, and I -- I was 10 years old, 11 years old, 12 years old, a -- he wasn\u2019t a\nyoung man, you know, but he was a very young man.",
        "Q: And there were times when he saw that you were tired and he let you rest --",
        "A: Rest, oh yes.",
        "Q: -- were there other children? Were there other children working there?",
        "A: There were a few other children. I d -- I don\u2019t remember whether the others, you know, I -- I\nha -- I don\u2019t know what it 1s, but I -- I think I\u2019ve always had a -- in Yiddish they would say\nchutzpah, you know. And I still have. I\u2019m 78 years old and I still have a chutzpah today, you\nknow. And I think I get away with many things which others might not have got away with them.\nSo he was very good to me as that was, you know, and there were some good people there. Not\nmany, but there were some. It\u2019s -- 1t wasn\u2019t a question that a -- I mean, people become very\nselfish, you know, everybody wants to live, so why, if he\u2019s got something more than you, why\nshould he share with you, you know? You gotta be a real great person to do that, and you know,\nnot many people are around like that, to share their last piece of bread or something, you know.\nBut there were some, and I came across them.",
        "Q: So tell about when the n -- when in \u201944 they liquidated the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes, they told us that we\u2019re going to Germany, and that we\u2019re going to build the factory. And\nagain we had to get just one suitcase, and I went with my grandmother to the station. She also\ncame -- as I was in the metal factory, she came with my group, as a group. And we went to the\nstation, reported to the station.",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t work in the factory.",
        "A: No, she didn\u2019t work.",
        "Q: So that you --",
        "A: But nevertheless, she came with us, you know.",
        "Q: They allowed -- so this was the manager --",
        "A: Yes, well, they allowed --",
        "Q: -- her to do that.",
        "A: -- yes -- well, yes. And as we arrived, you know, th-there were cattle trucks waiting for us,\nyou know, which I couldn\u2019t understand, you know, and they just said, take a suitcase, get onto\nthe cattle trucks. We were helped by the Jewish police. And this is when it started. We thought,\nyou know, that things are bad in -- 1n -- in the ghetto, but that\u2019s when our trouble started,\nbetween 1944 and 1945, those were the worst -- the worst year, well it was less than a year that\nhappened to me that stand out in my -- mostly in my -- first of all I was already older. I was\nalready, you know, I was 14 years old, 14 and a half. I was already -- to my way of thinking, I\nwas already a grown up person already. And when they put us in the -- those trucks, do you\nknow, it was just impossible to survive. It was so packed, you couldn\u2019t breathe. And do you\nknow, today, I said that many times, you know, I feel ashamed, not only for other people, for\nmyself, what can happen to a person, that when we stopped -- th-th-the train stopped somewhere\nafter a day or so, and -- and there were a few people were dead, you know. First of all there --\nthere was no water to drink. You remember like I said to you, we\u2019re -- it was July, August, in the\nsummer in Poland, the heat. You know, you talk about your sort of 90 degrees or something like\nthat, packed like sardines. And people, you know, elderly people, people that ha-had problems\nwere dying and -- and I\u2019m so ashamed today, you know, when I think of it, how could I have\never done that, say thank God they died, there\u2019Il be more room for us, you know? And of course\nat that time it -- that\u2019s how I felt, but -- and most people, and -- but today when I think back, like\nI wasn\u2019t human any more, you know? How can a human being think like that? To be that selfish,\nyou know? But unfortunately that\u2019s how it is, you know. I -- I saw children stealing a piece of\nbread from their father. I saw a father s-stealing a piece of bread from -- from a child. And do\nyou know I\u2019m a father today and a grandfather and I think I would rather die than do that. But if I\nwould have a father then, would he steal from me, or would I steal from him? Maybe. I don\u2019t\nknow, you know. You\u2019ve got to be in that position to realize. It\u2019s easy to say how could he do it,\nbut today, you know what, I\u2019ve got a family and I\u2019ve got -- I\u2019m not short of -- of anything, you\nknow. When I say anything, food, or drink, or -- I can say that. Would -- how would it have been\nin those circumstances, you know, if I was starving and knowing that my child has got a piece of\nbread, could I have stolen it? May -- I definitely say today no, but I don\u2019t know. You have to be\nin those circumstances to realize whether you can do it or not. And we traveled for a few days\nand it was less and less people in -- in -- in -- in the coaches, you know. And eventually one\nmorning at about, must have been five, six o\u2019clock in the morning, the train stopped, and you\nknow, we could see through the slats, you know, of the truck, something written up, Oswiecim,\nand then it said Auschwitz and I -- didn\u2019t mean anything to me, an-and the grown up people say\noh, it\u2019s a concentration camp, and I didn\u2019t know what a concentration camp was. And they\nopened it, the gates and straight away in German they started shouting, raus, raus, raus. And\nthere were people sort of wearing striped things and striped caps and we did -- still didn\u2019t\nunderstand that. And it was -- like I said, 1t was in the summer and it was hazy, the sun was hazy\nbecause it was very early in the morning. And there was like a haze, yellow haze, and then we\nsaw chimneys and we saw that\u2019s bakeries, or [indecipherable] whatever it 1s there, and -- and\nthen, as I said, we had to jump down, you know, and it was pretty high, and some of those people\nthat were there, they were Jewish inmates of Auschwitz that helped people to jump down. We\nweren't allowed to take our suitcase, they said, you leave everything behind. When you get to\nwhere we going, we get our luggage back, you know, and of course, we didn\u2019t. And then we had\nto go through a selection committee. And here we go again, I was lucky again. Being in the\nfactory, we were a main transport that went through the selection committee. Women, children,\ndisabled people, everybody went through. We were 500 and odd people. But the train had many\nmore people on it, and all the others had to go -- the selection, there were German officers with\ndogs and batons, you know, and everywhere -- and they were rushing them, and you know it was\nright and left, right and left. And then we realized what was happening, that the people going to\nthe right were disabled people, women with babies, with children. And some of them -- and there\nwere screams, you know, because they -- they -- they took the child away and the woman they\nsaid to go to the left. And of course, can you imagine a mother giving up a child. So the mother\nrun towards it, she was beaten, but she was left with the child. And they said they\u2019re going to\ntake them to showers, but we found out soon afterwards, you know, beca -- from the guards,\nfrom the Jewish people that were [indecipherable] that an hour after a -- that train arrived in\nAuschwitz, in Birkenau, you know, those people were dead. They were gassed and put in -- and\nhow can a human being do that? Taking a child, a p -- a person, a woman, a disabled person,\nwhoever and put in a gas oven, and then burned? It just -- but unfortunately I learned. I\u2019m now\nan old man so I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s -- appear it\u2019s happening today. I mean, maybe not to the --\nthat extent and maybe not to the Jewish people, but it\u2019s happening. And us they took to -- the\npeople that went to the left, we all went to showers. They were actually showers, they were not\ngas -- they were not gas cha -- crematoriums, gas chambers. And we had to take all our clothes\noff and we never saw it again. They shaved everybody, whoever had hair, wherever you had hair\nhad to be shaved, women and men. And we came out and they gave us striped clothing. And of\ncourse the women went separate to a different one, we went separate. And had a -- one of those\ncaps. They didn\u2019t tattoo us at the time, it was -- I don\u2019t know whether that was because we were\nwith a group, or whether they didn\u2019t tattoo any more people, but they -- but we had a number, so\nat that time that was -- I wasn\u2019t Ziggy Shipper, I was 83303. Not that anybody called me by the\nnumber or so, but that\u2019s what I had writ -- a stripe, think here.",
        "Q: On your jacket?",
        "A: On my jacket, yes, an-and trousers. And I remember like today, and I don\u2019t know why, you\nknow, they just gave me a uniform, one of those striped thing. I mean, they didn\u2019t say oh, you are\nsmall, we give you a small one, big one, and I got a very big one, and I don\u2019t -- and you know\nthat my trousers went almost to -- under my arms. And somebody came, oh I got the smaller one,\ncan you give me the bigger one? I don\u2019t know why, you know, I remember like today I said no.\nMaybe I thought because it\u2019s bigger itll be warmer in the winter or something. I didn't know\nhow long I\u2019m going to wear those. Anyway, after the showers, disinfection, haircut, you know,\nshaving, we -- they went into barracks. Now that I -- we expected many things, but we didn\u2019t\nexpect that. I don\u2019t know whether you know what it looked like. I went back after the war to see\nthat and you know, it was bunks, three bunks, one out -- above the other. You know, three bunks,\nI don\u2019t remember if I was in the bottom or middle. I think I was in the middle bunk. Three\npersons to a bunk, you know. Two one way, one that. And straw and every morning we used to\nget the -- it was hot, you were -- could suffocate. Every morning we had black coffee and a piece\nof bread. Every evening we had -- we didn\u2019t work. We just had to stand outside all day long, you\nknow, and then go back.",

        "A: It was very, very qui -- one thing what they did was everything was quick. Quick, quick,\nquick. From the minute the ghetto [indecipherable] opened, you know, all you heard was raus,\nraus, raus, quick, quick, quick. And even the selection, when you went through selection, if you\nweren't fast they were beating you, you see? That\u2019s why they had those batons, you know, those\nbig things and they were knocking you, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Hitting you, and you know, and --",
        "Q: It must have been so frightening, so chaotic and so like a nightmare when you --",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s -- 1t was a nightmare because you -- you just didn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t understand what\nwas happening to you and to the people. What\u2019s going on, you know? It wasn\u2019t like -- it wasn\u2019t\nlike being in the ghetto, you know, that every week it got a bit worse and more people are dying\nand -- and people are dying of starvation and whatever else, of illness, and you know. But here it\nwas something happened so fast, you know, an-and -- and the people kept asking, where are\nthey? Where\u2019s my wife, where\u2019s my mother, where\u2019s my child, where\u2019s -- you know, the ma --\nmen would be saying, you know, and then -- and there was no answer, because there wasn\u2019t\nother camps that you could see them. You know, where have they gone? But they soon found\nout, you see, because the -- the inmates, you know, th-the ones that were doing all the cleaning\nup and the disposing of the bodies, you know, and so on after they were gassed they had to put\nthem in the ovens, you know, and -- to cremate them in. They asked them, and they were soon\ntold, you know, what it is. But you know, even then, as a 14 year old boy, you doi -- 1-it didn\u2019t\nsort of -- possibly, personally, I was lucky. I came with my grandmother and I knew my\ngrandmother is still there. I had no siblings, you know, so I didn't have to worry about where --\nwhere\u2019s my little sister, or my brother, or -- or -- nothing s -- sort of happened to me that I should\nfeel in a terrible state, you know? And at 14 and a half, do you care what happens to other\npeople, you know? And especially in the position where we are all in, like I said to you before,\nyou become so selfish and so hard, that all you care is about yourself, don\u2019t care about anybody\nelse. Because you are not human any more. They dis-humanized you. You know, yo-you -- you\nbecome a terrible person. I found that out years later [indecipherable]. But you see it today even,\nyou know, in -- you know, people in -- in -- in the African nations or in the Middle East, you\nknow, you know, people starving, you know and -- and you become -- you steal. You steal from\neach other, you know.",
        "Q: So you were in the barracks with [indecipherable]",

        "Q: -- a men\u2019s barracks, in a --",
        "A: Yes, a men\u2019s barrack, there must have been at least eight - 900 people in the barracks. There\ncertainly -- there was room for them because we -- everybody s -- had where to sleep. The only\nthing the stench, the smell, th-the -- the heat, you know, 1 -- and people were dying there, they\ndidn\u2019t have to kill them, they didn\u2019t have to take them to g -- the gas chambers to kill them, they\nwere dying there. Wat -- anybody that was there was finished, you know. Either he -- first of all\nhe couldn\u2019t survive and secondly they took him away and took him to -- straight away to a gas\nchamber.",
        "Q: You would sleep three to a bunk?",
        "A: Three to a bunk, and there were three bunks right, and there was another one next to it again,\nso it was like 18 people in a square sort of thing.",
        "Q: Could you sleep?",
        "A: I would imagine so, you know, as a child, yes, you know, and a -- the problem was always,\nyou know, if you gi -- when you got your piece of bread and you thought you\u2019 ll put it under the -\n- inside you -- in your jacket because you slept in your clothes, there was no undressing. And you\ncouldn\u2019t sleep. That\u2019s the only time I couldn\u2019t sleep, personally, you know, it -- when I knew I\nhad a piece of bread there. I had to eat it up, you know and then I managed I\u2019m sure after, to\nsleep. You know, and we got up very early to c\u2019est l\u2019appel, which was the counting of the\npeople. Why they had to count people, what were they worried, they were going to kill them\nanyway, why were they worried whether was one missing or not, you know? But that\u2019s the\nGermans.",
        "Q: During those times when you were in the barracks, did people -- what did people talk about?\nWhat did they --",

        "Q: -- what was it like? Do you remember that?",
        "A: No. No. Well, the only thing we were talking about, when will it finish. When will we get out\nof here, will we survive, will they take -- because we already knew about the gas chambers then.\nWill they take us away to the gas chambers? But -- ami -- but me as a child of 14 or 14 and a\nhalf, it never entered my mind that I'll be killed. I could never understand -- you know, I saw my\nfriends dying, I saw other people dying. But I could never -- I couldn\u2019t accept it, that Pll die.\nThat eventually it will be the end, you know? And you know, there were always rumors, you\nknow, the Russians are near, the British are near, the Americans are coming in. Eventually we\nwill be rescued. You know what, maybe that helped me to survive, I don\u2019t know. But I survived\nthat and after a few weeks, not very long, we weren't a long time in Auschwitz, they found us.\nThe Germans actually found us and they took us -- they said, right, now we\u2019re going towards\nGermany, which we didn\u2019t, we went -- well, it -- in a way we did, I suppose, because they took\nus to a concentration camp.",
        "Q: Oh s -- is this group of people --",
        "A: The group of 500, yes.",

        "A: My grandmother.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, your grandmother.",
        "A: Yes, my grandmother. And we went to a concentration camp called -- 1t wasn\u2019t a\nextermination camp, it was a concentration camp called Stutthof, which was very near Danzig.\nNow there was a bigger problem because as hot as it was in Auschwitz, we were going on to the\nBaltic. And after a few weeks in that camp -- the camp was west, the living accommodation --\nand the food was even worse than Auschwitz. We again didn\u2019t work, but it was getting late, you\nknow, after a few weeks, you know, it was getting September, October, November, most people\nthat were with us, even from that group, were dying. You know, the elderly people were dying,\nyou know, from sp -- pure starvation and disease. And what we were saying when I -- I was\nasked, was I small, or was I tall, or was I, for a child of 14 and a half or so, I was\n[indecipherable] at 15. No, I was small. And what we did, when it was cold in the camp they\nmade human ovens. What it meant to people was sort of getting together and make group and get\nbigger, bigger, bigger, sort of a round thing. And what we were supposed to do, the people from\ninside were coming out and going outside. And so me, I came out, but I soon managed, as being\nvery little, I managed to get in -- back inside t-to --",

        "A: That\u2019s right, a human oven.",
        "Q: How long would they do this for?",
        "A: Oh, we could stand for hours like that, you know. You know, we couldn\u2019t fall because we\nwere all s-squashed together.",
        "Q: And si -- and you weren\u2019t working, so --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- this would go on --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- outside?",
        "A: The only work that we\u2019re do -- the only work we had to do was carrying big stones from one\nof the camp to the other side. When it was there we -- they had to carry it back to the other.\nThere was no work there. There was just -- they wanted to kill you, but there was no such a thing\nas -- as they took you to the -- only if you were ill. Of course there, there was no hospitals or\nanything. They straight away took you to the gas chamber. They only had one gas chamber, one\ncrematorium. And that -- the only problem was in the winter, if somebody did escape and there\nwas w -- a person missing, we had to stand there all day long in the cold, in below freezing\ntemperatures to stand there, you know. And then what happened -- of course, food was even\nscarcer than it was in Auschwitz. Then they said they wanted 20 young people to go to work in a\ncat -- in a working camp. And I said -- they said, who is 17, and I couldn\u2019t volunteer 17, I was 14\nand a half and my size was about 12 years old. And they said there wasn\u2019t enough, so they said,\nwho is 16? And I stood on my toes and I lifted my hand. And everybody said, all the others were\nsaying don\u2019t volunteer, don\u2019t volunteer, they\u2019re going to kill you. I said, listen, if I stay here Pll\nbe dead within a very short time. No food and cold and frost. I\u2019m going. And so they took 20\nboys, all Polish boys, Jewish boys, you know, and they took, by passenger train -- oh, they gave\nus -- by the way, they gave us new winter clothes, which was the same stripes, but warmer. So I\nsaid, well it\u2019s getting better already. A -- and they -- you know, listen, everything is -- is a matter\nof -- it\u2019s relative to it, you know, it -- and they took us on passenger trains, oddly enough, to a\nplace called Stolp in Pomerania.",
        "Q: Before you tell me about that, did you have a conversation with your grandmother about\nleaving?",
        "A: Ahy-y -- only through the wires I could shout, because I could see her. You know, and I said,\nI\u2019m going away and I'l see you after the war. You know, everything was I'll see you after the\nwar, you know.",
        "Q: What did she say?",
        "A: Nothing, she -- I don\u2019t remember exactly the words she said. I suppose she must have said\nsomething in Yiddish to bless me, or something. And maybe that helped, you know, and I -- they\ntook us, like I said, on those passenger trains. We arrived at that Stolp. And the only thing that\nwas better, it was in the winter, still Pomerania, which is very cold. But it was warmer for us\nbecause we worked on a railway yard, you see, to do with the trains and so on, I don\u2019t know\nwhat. And the food was even slightly better. We -- at least we got something, a piece of bread in\nthe morning and in the evening and lunchtime we had the soup. And we had -- we worked for\nGerman people, and not the army, just German people.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: We were guarded by the -- but we worked for -- it was a factory there, that we worked at.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, tell me where Pomerania is, my geography 1s not that good.",
        "A: It is that -- today it\u2019s Poland, at that time it was Germany, it was east.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s eastern --",
        "A: East, yes.",
        "Q: -- western Poland.",
        "A: Yes. It was -- it\u2019s about -- I would say about 50 kilometers from Danzig, you know, so it was\nalso near the Baltic, but it wasn\u2019t on the Baltic. And also the advantage was, there were only\nJewish people in that camp. This was a labor camp, there was no extermination, like I said. And\nworking on the railways, there\u2019s always a chance to steal some food.",
        "Q: Cause these were passenger trains?",
        "A: There were passenger trains, there were goods trains. Thank God there were goods trains so\nwe could [indecipherable] goods train, we managed to eat whatever their goods they were\ncarrying, we managed to get them, we managed to steal some carrots or potatoes or beets. The\nonly thing was, whatever we stole we had to eat raw there. We couldn\u2019t cook it, there was\nnowhere to cook. But it didn\u2019t -- it tasted very good, you know. Doesn\u2019t matter, when you\u2019re\nhungry everything tastes good. You know, the unfortunate part was there, that one day five boys,\nolder than I was, they stole some cigarettes or tobacco that was going to the German army, to the\nfront, where they were fighting. And they were caught. So they put them -- there was a little\nroom like a disinfection room, with no windows, nothing. They put them there and they kept\nthem there for a week, then they said -- then they announced they\u2019re going to let them out. But\nthe problem was they -- we had to come and see those boys. I don\u2019t know how those boys\nsurvived without water, without food, without anything in that thing. But when we came to the\nsquare where they were going to let out, we saw gallows, five gallows and little stools standing\nthere. And they took those boys out, they put those ropes round their neck -- five boys, and I\nmean, I\u2019ve seen people die next to me, you know, and -- but I\u2019ve never seen somebody young,\nyou know, putting a rope around their necks and going to hang. And they were start to read out\nwhy they\u2019re being, you know, German, another thing, they had to -- why did they have to say\nwhy? They were going to hang them. But those five boys didn\u2019t give them a chance, even. They\njumped off the stools and they killed themselves, th-they didn\u2019t wait for the Germans to kill\nthem.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: All five of them. And that was, like I said, the first time I saw people being hanged, actually,\nyou know, people not dying, but being people killed. I mean, when they took away the people to\nthe gas chambers, we didn\u2019t see it, we only saw the people taking away. But here I -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s --\nit -- do you know, I can see it today like it\u2019s happening now, in front of me, of -- of -- of course,\nwhat happened then. Then we started working again and going back to the factory and work\nagain.",
        "Q: Before we go on, I want to ask you another question about that.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: These five boys who were hanged were not much older than you?",
        "A: Well, no, I -- today that certainly wasn\u2019t, but they were like 18 or 19 --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- which were much older at the time, you know.",
        "Q: But did it -- at that point, when you saw that happen, did you think then that you could die as\nwell?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It never -- it still --",
        "A: It never -- right through the five years, it never occurred to me. I don\u2019t know why, it just --\nmaybe that\u2019s how I am, you know, and --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- I never thought -- never thought -- I thought, one day I\u2019Il be free, you know.",
        "Q: Did you feel fear?",
        "A: Oh yes. Oh yes, every time, you know, you saw -- even in that camp that we were in, which\nwe -- we -- it was considerable better than it was in Auschwitz or Stutthof, when we saw a\nGerman officer come in now, 1s he going to take us away, you know? Fear yes, but --",
        "Q: Fear -- and what was your worst fear? If you weren't afraid of dying, if that wasn\u2019t --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, just seeing that German was fear enough, you see. But no, and --\nand then of course, what was happening that the Russians are getting nearer again, so they took\nus to another camp. Don\u2019t ask me where it was, but it wasn\u2019t very far from where I was in\nPomerania. A place called Buschgraben, which was a German name, most probably it wa -- it\nwas still in Poland, so it was -- I don\u2019t know what it was called in -- in -- in Polish. And there we\nstayed, there we did nothing. We had no food, no drink. And the Russians were so near us, the\nRussian soldiers, that at night we could hear the music. During the day we saw the planes flying\nover, you know, very low and the Russian would say we could -- you could see the pilots in the\nplane. And one sort of afternoon we looked around and we couldn\u2019t find any Germans. We were\nfree. And so we said th-the -- the boys sort of my age, you know, said right, let\u2019s go over to the\nRussians, you know. At least we get some food and drink. But the grownups said you can\u2019t do\nthat because they might -- they won\u2019t know who you are, they might kill you, they might shoot at\nyou. So we said all right, we went to s -- we went to sleep that night, you know, woke up in the\nmorning we were surrounded by the SS troops, by the Nazis again. And they were coaches\nwaiting for us.",
        "Q: Coaches?",
        "A: Yes, ordinary car -- vehicles, you know?",
        "Q: Cars. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Car -- well, you know, big. Like buses, you know? Luxury buses. And today I cannot\nunderstand it. They didn\u2019t have enough petrol for their soldiers, but they had petrol to transport\nJews. And they said now they\u2019re going to st -- again, every time they\u2019re going to send us to\nGermany. And they said we go back to Danzig. And we went back to Stutthof to wait, which was\neven -- there was no gas, there wa -- and there was no electricity, there was no water, people are\ndying. But we stayed there only a few days and then they said now they\u2019re going to take us to a\nboat and they\u2019re going to put us on boats and we\u2019re going to Denmark.",
        "Q: So the Germans were going to send you to Denmark?",
        "A: To den -- yes, well, Denmark was occupied by the --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- Germans.",
        "Q: But what happened -- do you know what happened to the Russians? You thought the Russians\nwere So close.",
        "A: Yes, but they took us away, you know, so most probably next day the Russians were there,\nthey -- they occupied that place. But us they took away. The whole camp that was there in\nBuschgraben, and they say -- as I said, they were going to take us to Denmark. There wi --\neverything will be better. And it was already getting late, 1t was already March, April or so in --\nin -- SO we went to that port and they put us on -- into barges, like you carry coal, or wheat or\ncorn.",
        "Q: Open on the top?",
        "A: Open, and there was no watcher [indecipherable] you know, there was -- I mean, it could be\nclosed, they could close the hatches, you know, but there was nothing on top. There was, well,\njust for you -- just for transporting goods. It wasn\u2019t a ship, you know, it was -- and they put us in\nthose barges. And they said we arrive in Denmark, everything [indecipherable] I\u2019m sure\nDenmark was already liberated by then. We didn\u2019t know that. And we were only for about 10\ndays, eight to 10 days.",
        "Q: Did they feed you?",
        "A: There was no f -- no food, no drink, nothing. It wasn\u2019t a question like when we left the ghetto,\nwe could take a little bit of food with us. Here we had nothing.",
        "Q: And you were how many people?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know exactly, but it was more than just one camp, you know.",
        "Q: It was more than just that 20 that were --",
        "A: It must have been about a thousand people there.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: You know what -- you know -- but there wasn\u2019t one barge, there was many barges. You\nknow, we also had luck [indecipherable] we had some Norwegian and Danish prisoners of war\non those barges and they were treated much better than us, because they were prisoners of war,\nso they used to get better food. They were much more able-bodied people. And that was very\nlucky for us, but anyway, at that time I already had typhus. I didn\u2019t know then I had typhus, but I\nfound out later. Now, you can imagine having an illness like typhus, never mind medication, that\nwas, of course, out. There was no medication. But there was no water. And I think what saved\nme again -- it\u2019s funny -- that I was so ill that I didn\u2019t drink the salt water, cause I didn\u2019t have a\nchance to get it. A lot of people drank the salt water, within one day they were dead, because\nthey swelled up and they just died. Cause you -- you can imagine how much salt there is 1n that\nwater. Now --",
        "Q: With typhus do you have a high fever?",
        "A: I should imagine so.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: A-As far as I know, yes.",
        "Q: Did you -- were you conscious during this --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- boat trip. You were awake?",
        "A: I was almost conscious, semi-conscious, I suppose. And after -- I said we were traveling for\nabout 10 days and one -- one evening we were very near land and the German -- the troops, the\nSS, the whoever was guarding us got off those barges, then we were just alone. But we couldn\u2019t\nhave -- we weren\u2019t on land, they went across on little boats. So the Norwegians, when I said why\nwe were lucky that they [indecipherable] the Danish, they said, you know what, if you want to,\nwhoever wants to, we will take over onto dry land. Because there were still little boats left. So\nslowly, right through the night, they took every person off, onto land. Some people escaped.\nWell, I wasn\u2019t in a state to escape, I do -- I couldn\u2019t walk, never mind run. The Germans came\nback in the morning and they saw what happened, they didn\u2019t put us back on the boat. We are 15\nkilometers away from a town, which is a naval town called Neustadt. We go there, our boat that\nwe are -- got to go on it will be waiting for us to go --",
        "Q: The German [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- yeah, to go. So we had to go on a march. And ev --",
        "Q: We -- how many people -- the Norwegians brought people over during the night --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and some of them just ran and escaped?",
        "A: Some of them ran away, I don\u2019t know how many ran away. Not that it was important to us --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- you know.",
        "Q: But then the Germans came back to get you --",
        "A: Yeah, well they didn\u2019t count us --",
        "Q: -- and you were already on land.",
        "A: -- you know. Whoever was there they took away. And that was one thing. You had to walk. If\nyou fell you were shot on the spot. There was no transport and they weren't going to leave you\nthere. And they were not going to carry you. So luckily I ha -- I was with friends that I was\ntogether during all the times even from Poland, from the ghetto, through the camps together and\ntwo of them managed to carry me -- sort of half carry, half walk and somehow, don\u2019t ask me\nhow, I don\u2019t know, once again I survived and we arrived eventually. If we started a thousand\npeople, we might have finished up about three, 400, the rest fell and were shot.",
        "Q: How long did this take?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know exactly, but 1t took hours and hours. And it was only another 50 kilometers, like\n10 miles. Shouldn\u2019t have take -- well, to a able bodied person it wouldn\u2019t have taken that long.\nAnyway they -- we arrived at the place and it was a port and it was a boat waiting for us. That\u2019s\nth -- the only time they told us the truth. It was a proper ship, a liner, you know? Atlantic ocean\nliner, it wasn\u2019t some little ship. And there was already a transport of people from other camps on\nthat ship. We didn\u2019t know then, but the re -- we found out, because there were planes going\naround and we knew it couldn\u2019t be German planes. We didn\u2019t know whether they were Russians,\nAmericans or British. It turned out they were British planes, and all of a sudden they started\nbombing. And they hit that boat, but they didn\u2019t hit it that it was completely damaged, you know,\nand they started -- people started shouting, screaming that we\u2019re on the boat. That\u2019s how we\nfound out that there were other people on the --",
        "Q: So you saw the boat you were on?",
        "A: Oh yes, we were just in front, like in front waiting to go on it. But they couldn\u2019t do it because\nof the -- the bombing. And the people started screaming and jumping into the water and of\ncourse some of them drowned, you know. And we were waiting and waiting, waiting and it took\n-- must have been at least a half an hour and then it stopped, so we didn\u2019t know whether they --\neverybody was already jumped off or they were dead, whatever it was. And then about av -- 10\nminutes, 20 minutes later, we heard people shouting again, but it was different. They were\nwaving things. We couldn\u2019t understand what was happening. And then all of a sudden we looked\naround and we didn\u2019t see any Germans. We were surrounded by the British army tanks. That was\nthe third of May, 1945. And I went over to the -- to the tank and the first thing -- he was talking\nto me in English and I didn\u2019t know what he was saying, you know. And the only thing I kept on\nsaying is in -- in German, wasser, wasser. You know, wasser, he must have understood wasser,\nwater, you know and he gave me some water. This is the first water I drunk after 10 days. And\nnot only that I drunk after 10 days, as a free man, you know. I don\u2019t think I appreciated the free,\nyou know, because I didn't know, and of course then they threw me a little parcel as well, and I\nmanaged to hide it. A usual thing, I thought no, everybody\u2019! want it, and it was true, everybody\nwanted [indecipherable] they didn\u2019t realize that we are free, that we can get food as much as we\nwant. And they -- straight away some others came and some people could speak German, you\nknow, some people -- British soldiers. And you know, they said you are free now, you can do\nwhatever you want, you can go around. You can rope, you can steal, you can kill, do whatever\nyou want. Well, of course, being Jewish and being a child, all we were interested was to get\nfood. And this, to a certain extent, I wish they wouldn\u2019t have done that, I wish they would have\nkept us and put us in -- somewhere in a camp and give us food. Not tell us that we can go and\ntake whatever we want, because I would imagine that the first month of the liberation, more\npeople died than in previous months purely from overeating. You couldn\u2019t -- our stomachs\ncouldn\u2019t take it. And here we were just eating for the sake of it, you know, we couldn't -- we\nwere right up to our necks in food, you know. We were eating meat and jam and cheese,\neverything together. And the British were so good to us, you know. Every time they -- they used\nto come in, they -- first of all they said to us, go and live wherever you want. We, a few of us\nfound a prison. So we thought we\u2019ll stay there. But not where the prisoners -- there was no\nprisoners, but where the guards must have slept, you know, and that was first time in years of so\nwhite sheets, you know, and -- and of cour --",

        "A: We were free. We could do -- and unfortu -- well, not -- I suppose unfortunately, there were\nalso some Russians from the -- not prisoner of war, also inmates like us, on the boats, you know,\nand they did commit a lot of crimes, unfortunately.",
        "Q: What kind of crimes?",
        "A: Well, the natural thing was rape, you know, rape and murder and stealing and -- we were\nstealing, well, in a way we didn\u2019t think we were stealing, the food was there in the open.",
        "Q: And the people were there who owned the stores or the market --",
        "A: No, no, no, it wasn\u2019t --",
        "Q: -- or they were bombed?",
        "A: -- it was -- it was a naval port.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And -- and the -- the -- the marines, the German Marines weren\u2019t there, you know, the\nGerman Navy wasn\u2019t there. It was open, it was -- nobody was there, you know, you could take\nwhatever you wanted, you know, and like I said, you know and I slept in that prison with white\nsheets for the first time in my life, you know. But the funny thing was I woke up in the morning,\nI -- I didn\u2019t have a bath or a shower even then, I mean, this was the least of my problems, you\nknow. Food was the only problem. And got up -- but when I got up in the morning I looked at\nmy sheet and it looked so dirty, and I said, well, it must be from my body, you know, I -- I -- I\nhaven\u2019t washed for -- for -- for days and days, for weeks. And the same clothes, there was no\nother clothes. Only one shirt, one pair of boots, you know, which were wooden clogs. And I\nlooked at it and then -- then I saw things were moving and then I realized that it was lice. And of\ncourse, I was covered completely with lice. You know, but this didn\u2019t matter, you know, as long\nas I had food. And every morning, you know, they -- the British troops, soldiers were coming\nand with the Red Cross vans and they said anybody that wants to go hospital, and you know, and\nI ne -- I -- somehow my typhus didn\u2019t sort of exist any more, you know. And -- but I\u2019m sure I\nwas still very, very ill, and -- but I laughed. I said, why do they want to take us to the hospital?\nNow we\u2019ve got everything. Everything in life was food. That\u2019s the only thing we are orientated.\nThree days later when they came I said I would like to go to hospital, but I won\u2019t manage\nbecause whatever I had came down, came out of me. And they took me to a hospital in Neustadt.\nI was -- they took away my clothes, I was -- had nothing and -- and then th -- they put me to bed.\nAnd I, even now I was -- I was very, very ill. I was -- I don\u2019t know what was wrong with me, I\nwa -- but I was semiconscious. And do you know -- and they asked me, do you want anything?\nAnd don\u2019t ask me why, the only thing I wanted is salami. It\u2019s just one of those stupid things\nwhen I think of it today. Well, of course I didn\u2019t get that [indecipherable] they put me to bed and\nfor three months I was in the hospital you know, when -- when I was already okay, I couldn\u2019t get\nout of bed, I couldn\u2019t walk.",

        "A: I was t -- yeah, I couldn't -- they had to teach me to walk, you know. And you know tha -- I\nsaid, what is wrong with me, they said nothing. What was wrong with me? Also nothing, you\nhad typhus when you came in but otherwise there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong, but you know --\nand I remember such stupid thing, I couldn\u2019t walk.

So of course you didn\u2019t steal, you didn\u2019t\nhave to steal, but wo -- we were doing, you know, the -- I mean, I was only -- I didn't need it,\nyou know, I had enough food in the hospital. But when they came, to -- to the children they gave\nchocolates. To the grownup that were there they gave cigarettes. So of course when they -- the\npeople that -- with the chocolates ha -- came, so I was there, sitting up in bed and I took the\nchocolate. When I knew the people with the cigarettes are coming, I covered myself over the\nhead. And they asked, who is there, I says, oh, there\u2019s a man there, so they left me cigarettes, you\nknow, that -- that mind that works, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s --",

        "A: Oh, keep thing is not, it didn\u2019t matter, I had to put -- have things, you know. Well eventually\nthey said yes, you\u2019ll be able to go out. I said yes, that\u2019s all very good. I\u2019ve got no clothes.",
        "Q: How did you communicate with the British at that time?",
        "A: Oh, there were -- there were already -- first of all, after a few months, the German nurses were\ndoing everything and I spoke German t -- you know, I spoke Yiddish and a bit of German, you\nknow, mixed it up. They understood. And some of the soldiers even, you see, the ones that\nliberite -- that liberated us went -- carried on fighting, you know. So the -- the ones that came in\nwere different already and there were some soldiers that could speak Polish, there were soldiers\nthat could speak Yiddish, there were Jewish soldiers, so there was no problem. So -- and the\nthing was that it was already three months after the liberation, so the -- the -- the German nurses\nalready were girlfriends of British soldiers, you see? So she said to me, I try to get you\nsomething to wear, one of the nurses and she brought me a British uniform, you know. I said,\nthat\u2019s very nice, but I mean, I\u2019m a little boy, I mean, it\u2019Il be too big. Anyway, don\u2019t worry and\nthey shortened it for me. And I came out of hospital and some friends of mine that I was with in\nthe camps said oh, we going to a displaced person camp. Which was a camp where we had where\nto live, where we used to get enough food. They they said, you know, there is -- I think now the\nBritish government is allowing a thousand children to come to England. The Swedish\ngovernment is allowing a thousand children to go to Sweden. And we can also go to Palestine\nbecause Palestine -- we can\u2019t go as such, just say right, we going, because there is a quota,\nbecause they said, according to the British government, because it was under the British\nprotection, British mandate, that it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the other population to send all the people\nthat want to go to Israel in one go. So every month groups will go. I said okay. But I definitely --\nso, we sat down, we thought Sweden, England, it must be about 50,000 miles away. I said, what\nwill we go to England, we know nobody. No, let\u2019s stay and go to Palestine. I said, I\u2019ve got\nnobody in England, I\u2019ve got nobody anywhere else as far as I know. And I said right, we\u2019ll do\nthat. So we stayed in the displaced person camp, then we went to a -- ab -- about 10 miles away\nto a children\u2019s home, and there were a few grown up people there, Jewish people and they kept\non teaching us a little bit, you know. And --",
        "Q: Teaching, you mean English?",
        "A: Eng -- no, no. English was unimportant, we didn\u2019t need to know English. You know, we\nweren\u2019t going to England, it was in ger -- I was in Germany so we learned Hebrew mainly, you\nknow, because going to Palestine and then they said all the kids that go to Palestine will go to\nHamburg. And in Hamburg we were at -- they sent us there, so I said, let\u2019s go to Hamburg. It\nwas a beautiful place. It was donated by the Varberek family, which was a Jewish family, Jewish\nbankers that when the war broke out in Germany they went to live in Switzerland and some went\nto live in England, you know. So we stayed there, then I got ill, I needed an operation. So again\nthey sent me to the hospital, I had the operation. Of course there was no anesthetic at the time,\nbut --",
        "Q: What was it -- what was it for?",
        "A: I ruptured myself --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- you know. It la -- it was -- I can\u2019t tell you how it happened, you know, cause I\u2019m too\nembarrassed.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. Anyway, I wanted to look somewhere where I shouldn\u2019t have done, you know, being\n15 years old, you\u2019re very inquisitive. And I -- but anyway, so I went to hospital and had the\noperation. Then two friends came to me and -- with a letter. And the letter was from London,\nEngland. And I s -- who would write to me from England? I don\u2019t know anybody in England. I\nlook, and you know, the usual thing, I look at the back, there was a return address, London. And\nit give a name, it means absolutely nothing to me, and --",
        "Q: Do you remember what the name was?",
        "A: Oh yes, I remember it very well. Pll come to it in a minute.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And -- so my friend went up to [indecipherable] and says, why the hell don\u2019t you open the\nletter and you\u2019ll know who it\u2019s from and who is writing to you. And I open the letter and it says,\nwritten in Polish, you know, my name is so and so and I left Poland in the 30\u2019s -- it\u2019s a woman --\nand I had a son in Poland, same age as you and I -- I found that name on the British Red Cross\nlist in London. She even says where, in Woburn House. The only thing, the year of the -- of the -\n- the birth is different. It says that Zygmund Shipper, born 18\" of January, 1931, and I know that\nmy son was born in 1930. And she says, but if you have a look at your left wrist, as a child of\nabout three or four you burnt yourself and there should still be a mark there. And you know, I\ndidn\u2019t even think of the mark. I knew I had a mark because it was very -- you could see it very\neasily. But of course, today you can just about see it.",
        "Q: Right there, yeah.",
        "A: And you know, and I looked at that and I found my mother, that I knew that she was dead for\nover 10 years. As a child of five I knew my mother was dead. At least that\u2019s what I thought. And\nhere a woman found me and she says she is my mother. The funny thing is I -- I -- tears come\ndown now. When I actually knew about it, it didn\u2019t mean that much to me. And of course, in the\nletter she says, if I\u2019m your mother I -- I want you to come to England to be with me, you know,\nand -- and I said to -- I turned around to my friends and -- you know, and I said, I don\u2019t know the\nwoman. She doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. I mean, you are my family. You are -- you two are\nmy brothers. She is a stranger to me. And of course, you know, they said, how can you say that,\nyou know. And when I came out of hospital an-and went back and the teacher there, we had\nteachers from the Jewish brigade, that were teaching us Hebrew and we had lessons in -- in -- in\nmath and whatever else, German, I\u2019m not sure, history or so on. And everybody said --\neverybody was talking about the incident and they said you found your mother, how can you not\n-- you\u2019re one of the luckiest people alive that you\u2019ve got somebody, a mother, and we\u2019ve got\nnothing. You must go to your mother. Anyway, they persuaded me and it took about -- at that\ntime I couldn\u2019t go, just go, she had to get a visa for me, and it took 10 months to get a visa, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: Oh yes, it -- or even longer. Than happened in January and I think -- and I came to England in\nDecember -- 22\" or 23\" of December 1946. And I arrived -- I came on a boat, I arrived in Hull.\nA man met me, and he said to me in Yiddish, because I couldn\u2019t speak English, he says -- when I\ncame off the boat he says, if you\u2019ve got your things, get your luggage and we will go on the\ntrain, we'll go to London. I looked at him and I be -- start laughing. He says, why are you\nlaughing? I said, what luggage? You see what I\u2019ve got. I was -- I was -- when I was in Hamburg\nI was very friendly with a girl and the only reason -- reason I was so friendly with her is because\nI had one shirt and I had -- needed somebody to wash my shirt. When she washed my shirt I had\nto stay inside because I had no other shirt to wear. And he talks to me about luggage. Anyway,\nhe turned out to be my stepfather, my mother remarried. And that\u2019s what I said to you I\u2019II tell\nyou the name, it was Killberg. And eventually we came home and you know, we -- I arrived and\nmy mother cried, and made me cry as well, but I still didn\u2019t feel anything towards her at the time,\nyou know? And the first six months I didn\u2019t go to work, I did nothing, but it was the worst -- one\nof the worst times in my life. I thought my wer -- bad times have finished but they were bad, I\nhad nobody. My family was in Germany, waiting to go to Palestine.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question about the time, that year that you spent waiting to go to England.\nWhat did you do, and what did you think about? I mean, did you -- and did you write to your\nmother, did you --",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: -- get caught up and so --",
        "A: I wrote. Yeah, not as often maybe as I should have done, but I did write, and what did I do?\nWe had school. And you know, we were outside Hamburg and we -- we had a time of our lives,\nyou know. We had money to burn. We -- we -- we used to get Red Cross parcels that were sent\nduring the war for the American prisoners of war. And there were mountains of those. And --\nand you know, we used to -- and in the parcel there was two pa -- a parcel for two people, so we\nused to share it. There was Nescafe, I'll never see Nescafe. There was -- there was prunes, there\nwas sugar, there was chocolate. And of course the most important thing was the Nescafe and a\npack of 200 cigarettes. Not that we smoked, but we could buy things with them. If we wanted to\ngo to a theater, you know, to see an opera -- I mean, I never knew what an opera was -- we --\nthere was no tickets, you couldn\u2019t get. But when you put a packet of cigarettes at the desk where\nthey were selling -- where the -- the ticket thing was, then you straight away got tickets, and\ncoffee as well. We used to go to the farms, you know, German farms, and you know, exchange a\ntin of Nescafe, those small tins at the time, which cames in the parcel, for some eggs or some\nham, or whatever we wanted, I mean --",
        "Q: Was Nescafe ground coffee?",
        "A: You know -- yes, you know, the tins. You\u2019ve got it here, you know --",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But it was Nescafe, it\u2019s the same as today in England. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got it here. Anyway, so\nwe were -- excuse me [tape break] Yes, and it was carrying on like that. I was with them. They\ndidn\u2019t say you\u2019ve got to leave because you\u2019re not going to Palestine, so I stayed with them and --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] you stay, yeah.",
        "A: -- til -- til we went, you know. I didn\u2019t want to go, right up til the last minute I didn\u2019t want to\ngo. But anyway I came, like I said, and for the first six months I didn\u2019t do any work, all I did was\ngo to cinemas. I\u2019ve never seen a film before in my life. Now I certainly made up in those six\nmonths. And then one day they -- somebody came to me and said, you know, there is a club that\nyoung Holocaust survivors, boys and girls meet in a certain area in London in Belsize Park, as it\nhappens, and why don\u2019t you go there one day? On a Saturday night they\u2019 ve got a dance, so why\ndon\u2019t you go? I said all right, so I decided I'll go, you know, so I arrived at the door, you know,\nit -- they had a dance in a church hall. I knocked on the door and they opened. And I said some\nwords then that I -- in the book what -- what Sir Martin Gilbert wrote about us, the boys that\ncame here -- that came to England,. and I said -- the first thing I said when th -- I opened the\ndoor, I found my family again. That\u2019s what they meant to me, more than my mother. And from\nthen on, my life completely changed, you know. I joined the club straight away and I spent more\ntime in the club than anywhere else. I got a job, my mother said and my stepfather said every\nperson should have a trade. What would you like to do? I said, I haven\u2019t got a clue what I want to\ndo. My mother said, would you like to go to school and [indecipherable]. I say, I\u2019m too old for\nschool. At 17 I was -- I can\u2019t go back to school, you know, I sort of -- so they said, what about\ntailoring? I said okay. So I went to t-tailoring. I worked in tailoring for about six or seven years\nand I must tell you I hated every minute of it. By then I already found th -- in that club, a refugee\ngirl as well, but they came in 1939, she came with her parents to England. We started dating, you\nknow, and I said to her, do you know what? The day the man will say that I\u2019m a qualified tailor,\nthis will be the day I give up tailoring and I\u2019Il never hold a needle in my hand. And I kept to it.\nHe said, now you can -- he says, you\u2019|l have more money. I said, thank you very much, but now\nI\u2019m leaving the job. And going back to that girl, we started going out together. Eventually we got\nmarried. And I opened a delicatessen business, that didn\u2019t go very well eventually. So she said,\nyou know, my father is in business, but if you go in, you can go much bigger in the business, we\n-- why don\u2019t you go in? And the father said, why don\u2019t you come in with me, and I did. It was a\nstationery and printing business. And eventually, after a few years, I left him and he retired and I\ngot bigger and I did wholesale, I had my own print place. I had retail shops in London. But you\nknow my mother -- going back to my mother, you know, I realized then, you know, when I got\nmarried I realized, you know, there must -- she must have had a good reason why she left. You\nknow, things are not so ha -- black and white. I realize people do get divorced, you know. But I\nregret -- I\u2019ve got a regret, that -- I\u2019ve got very few regrets, but one regret 1s -- which you did ask\nme, and I never asked my mother til she died, and she died, unfortunately, very young, why?\nWhat was the reason? And up to today I don\u2019t know the reason, you know, why she left, for\nwhat, whether there was another person involved, or whether she just couldn\u2019t live with my\nfather, or vice versa. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: [coughs] Excuse me. I want to a -- I\u2019m glad you brought up your father because during this\ntime, while you were in the -- in the ghetto, in the camps, you didn't know what had happened to\nyour father. You never heard from your father?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you -- w-w-when you were finally liberated, was it on your mind to try and go to Poland\nor find out about anybody in Poland, or was that a possibility?",
        "A: Now -- the funny thing was that we -- very, very few of us Polish boys -- Polish young --\nyoungsters wanted to go back to Poland. Don\u2019t ask me why. I -- when I think back today I don\u2019t\nknow why. But unfortunately some of them went back and were killed by the Poles. You see, the\nPoles were very scared of the Jewish people coming back and trying to claim their properties. I\nmean, those people lived in those properties for five years, and all of a sudden a Jew will come\nand take their properties away. They were beaten, they were killed in many, many places. There\nwas a pogrom in Kielce, you know, in Poland, where they killed a lot of Jewish people, you\nknow, because they were terrified that they\u2019re going to take away their homes. I can understand\nthat, you know. Why they should kill, I don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t have to kill them not to give\nthem back their homes, but they did. I -- I asked questions, you know, but I didn\u2019t look properly\ntil years later, you know, but like I said, you know, I was in business and I got married in 1954.\nIn 1956 my wife became pregnant. October -- the eighth of October I went to the hospital, she\nwas in labor. And I will never forget that moment, it was the happiest moment in my life, you\nknow. And you know, when I walked in -- because at that time there wasn\u2019t such a thing as a\nhusband watching the birth of a child, you know, and that woman presented me with that bundle,\nand I looked at it and I couldn\u2019t stop crying. And I said, at last, I know I\u2019ve got a family of my\nown, you know. When I look at that child, it was the greatest thing, that whenever I say that and\nmy younger daughter is there -- because a few years later I had another daughter, she says, Dad,\nwhat about me, you know. And she knows how much I love both of them, there is absolutely no\ndifferent. But you know, it did something to me, you know, that I cannot explain, you know. I\nknow that every parents 1s -- it\u2019s the most happiest day of their life when their child is born. But\nthe Holocaust survivor, when he\u2019s lost almost everything -- I mean some of my friends, they\u2019 ve\ngot -- they had families, they had siblings and they\u2019ve got not one member of the family\nsurvived, you know. You know, and I was lucky enough that my mother survived. Unfortunately\n-- | mean, she was lucky enough to see grandchildren, you know, which was a great thing for me\nand for her. And unfortunately I think she died thinking that I\u2019ve never forgiven her for leaving\nme. And when we discussed it, and I used to -- about leaving me, she never said why and I never\nasked, but I said, if you would have stayed, most probably both of us would have been dead\ntoday. So, at least both of us survived. And I certainly did -- did not hold it against her. You\nknow, I did, most probably as a child, but in later years, you know, when I came to England, you\nknow, it never crossed my mind that she\u2019s guilty of something. And she got on better with my\nwife than she got on with me because she had it in the back of her mind that I must hate her, or --\nand I know, I -- I -- I loved her as much as I could, you know. I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t love her as a\nnormal child will love a mother, you know. But I did love her, I respected her, you see? But then,\nas I said, I had children, and eventually they grew up. Good kids. They produced three children\neach. You know, I\u2019ve got six grandchildren and I think how lucky I am, you know. In 1981, I --\nunfortunately I did work very hard, you know? I also played very hard, you know. I -- I smoke\nand I drunk and I goed -- went to casinos and I -- I -- I went to football, I did everything. I wasn\u2019t\na father like I -- I even apologized to my two daughters for not being a father like I should have\nbeen. They don\u2019t think so, but you know. But today they think I\u2019m the greatest thing alive. I\ndon\u2019t know why, you know. They are wonderful, wonderful kids. And when I think I came to\nEngland, without education I couldn\u2019t read and write. Never mind English, I couldn\u2019t hardly read\nand write in Polish. And the -- my oldest grandson has a master\u2019s degree in mathematics and\nstatistics. From a poor little boy to come to this country, to meet her Majesty the Queen and\nshake hands with her. To meet the prime minister of this country and go to his place where he\nlives and where he works, why me? In 1981, as I said, I worked very hard. I had to go to hospital\nand they sent me home, they said there\u2019s nothing wrong. Four hours later I was in hospital again\nwith a heart attack and they -- I think it\u2019s cutting out.",
        "Q: Okay, we'll take a break, all right?",
        "A: \u2019'm nearly finished anyway.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: Id like to go back and ask you about this group of survivors that you met six months after\nyou came to London, and -- and I\u2019d like to just t-talk a little bit more about who they were and\nwhat kinds of things you did together, and you -- did -- just -- just give me a little bit of better\nsense of what that group of people was like.",
        "A: You see, they\u2019re a group of retired soldiers, they were the ones that came here in -- between\nAugust 1945, and sort of end of 1947. But tha -- on the 14 of August 1945 was the first lot that\ncame here from Theresienstadt concentration camp. They were there -- they were liberated in\nTheresienstadt, then they went to Prague and from Prague they came to England. Originally they\ncame to the north of England to a beautiful place called Windermere. And I don\u2019t know the\nreason why they brought them there, but people think it\u2019s because they were scared to bring them\ninto a capital like London or Manchester, because they didn\u2019t know who they were bringing in\nhere. They are bringing young people that were five years interned. Now, how are they going to\nbehave? Now, within a few months they dispersed them, they sent them to London and\nManchester, Liverpool and so on. Now, the people that I met, of course, they were the\nLondoners.",
        "Q: Now, who is they? Who brought them?",
        "A: They Central British Fund, which Leonard Montefiore was the head of Central British Fund,\nit was a charity, and they brought them to England, they supplied teachers and doctors.\nEverything was supplied by Central British Fund. They even paid for the transport, they paid for\neverything. The government allowed a thousand children, but the government didn\u2019t pay for it,\nthe Central British Fund paid.",
        "Q: And it was a non-governmental organization?",
        "A: Yes, completely charity. Was a complete charity organization, they\u2019re still in existence now,\nbut they -- they amalgamated with the big charities, they are not any more the Central British\nFund, the Jewish [indecipherable] this -- this -- the whole thing involved, you know. And they\nhad homes, you know, for the survivors and for refugees that came before the war to Britain, you\nsee? And that group that I was with is the group that came. They were -- they were survivors\noriginally from Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia. Very, very few from Germany, but they were\nall a mixture of [indecipherable]. And we -- we came -- and when they came to London they\nlived in hostels and then they decided -- the CBF decided that they should form a club to keep\nthe youngsters together. And they formed a club and it was like any other club. We did a lot of\nsport. One of our members, which today is the chairman of our society, which after the club\nfinished we formed a society, became British lightweight champion in weightlifting. Now him\nthey made British very quickly because he was very good. He represented England in the\nOlympic games, in the commonwealth games and of course in the Maccabee in Israel. And we\nhad -- and some went to college, some went to university. Some became doctors, lawyers. You\nknow, we had one who was working 1n -- in university as a lecturer, you know, and so -- well,\nactually two. One was a mathematician, you know, and we did -- they did quite well. And most\nof them went to trades or business, and -- and -- but the most important thing was that because of\nthe club, we kept together. Now, eventually, you know, we got married and had children, we\ncouldn\u2019t have a club, because it wouldn\u2019t work, because we wouldn\u2019t have time to go to a club.\nAnd we -- you couldn\u2019t carry on playing football, basketball, cricket and so on. We had other --\nwe had to work and we had to look after families. So they decided to form a society, which we\nstill got up til today, which is called the 45 Aid Society, I think I told you that. We raise money\nfor charity, for eng -- in England and in Israel, mainly for children. Because we feel we were\nchildren when it happened to us, we want to help children.",
        "Q: Is it just for Jewish children?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, no, in England it\u2019s -- whoever approaches us, we try to give. But of course, in -- in Israel\nit is for children. We -- we have been giving to a home for deaf children, you know, for -- for oh,\nfor about 30 years now, if not longer. And we feel we should, you know, and -- and also, I think,\nbecause of that, having had a club and then having this society, which we look after also our own\nmembers, if they need help, we are there. They\u2019ve got somebody to turn to, because they\u2019ve got\nno other families. Of course, they got married and have got their children and grandchildren. But\notherwise they\u2019ve got nobody. They got no brothers or sisters, so -- or very few have.",
        "Q: When you -- when you found this group, six months after you arrived, how many people were\nthere wi -- more or less?",
        "A: Oh, I wouldn\u2019t like to say, but there must have been at least about oh -- members, about 400.",
        "Q: Oh really, that many?",
        "A: Yeah, but, you see, a lot of them went to the United States, Canada, Australia, a few\nSwitzerland. And of course, you see we are scattered all over Britain. Like, 1n Manchester we\u2019ve\ngot some members and of -- we\u2019ve got a lot of members that were then in Israel are now -- that\nwer -- are now in Israel were originally in England, and some of them -- in 1948, or \u201947 and \u00b048,\nthey decided to go and fight in the War of Independence when the state of Israel was born. Some\ncame back. Those that w -- came back, had to come back within a year, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t\nhave been let into Britain. And some of them didn\u2019t want to come back, and they stayed in Israel.\nAnd we\u2019ve got quite a big grou -- well, not a big group, but a biggish group in Israel of those\npeople. So much so that this year we had our own reunion every -- we have a reunion every\nSunday -- every year in the first Sunday in May, because most of the people are liberated in that\ntime. So, we have a fa -- a reunion of everybody. People come from the States, people come\nfrom Israel. This year nobody came from Israel, the reason being that a lot of the people in\nEngland went to Israel on the sixth and seventh of May to be -- and they had their own reunion in\nIsrael, the Israeli people put on the reunion, and it was also because it was the 60\" anniversary of\nthe birth of the state of Israel, so they went. So we\u2019re a very close family and I think this helped a\nlot, because when you think that very few of us of that whole group needed psychiatric help, or\nbeing counseled -- I don\u2019t know anybody who was counseled through the years, because we had\nsuch a family, we had. And a lot of survivors that were in England or in Britain, I should say,\nneeded help because they were on their own. And you know, they didn\u2019t have anybody. Like my\nchildren -- I mean, I never had a brother, never had a sister, but my children had a lot of uncles\nand aunts. And up til today, they call my friends, many of them, I mean it\u2019s, it\u2019s not everybody,\nuncle or aunt. You see, because this -- I think this helped us a hell of a lot.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: You see --",
        "Q: Let me ask you also about your grandmother. You said goodbye to her as you were being\ntaken away --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- to go and work in this railroad yard, with those other young men.",
        "A: Well, this was the last time, of course, I saw my grandmother, and -- and this is one of my\nmain regrets, you know, that I didn\u2019t have a chance, you know, to thank her for what she did for\nme, to bringing me up. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t easy, you know, but there was nobody else that could\nhelp me at the time, only her. And she was like a mother to me. And what I am today, I owe it to\nher. And unfortunately, a few years ago -- well, quite a while ago now, I found out that she died\nin Theresienstadt, but she died on the day of the liberation.",
        "Q: She got moved to Theresienstadt?",
        "A: Yes, all of them finished up in Theresienstadt from Stutthof, because Stutthof was overrun\nvery quickly by the Russians. And she finished up in Theresienstadt and she died out -- on the\nday of the liberation. That means she didn\u2019t even have one day to say, well I survived the war\nand maybe my grandson survived the war, maybe my son survived the war, or sons, I should say.\nWhich one did. You see, my father -- the other regret is, I don\u2019t know when, I don\u2019t know where\nmy father died. And I would have liked to have gone -- I\u2019m not religious, but I would like to go\nand stand in front of his grave and say Kaddish for him, and you know, to say a prayer, you\nknow, and -- and that\u2019s about all, but --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know anything about where he died?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing.",
        "A: I\u2019ve been to Yad Vashem in Jerusalem years ago and I tried to find out, I couldn\u2019t find\nanything out. I -- I tried everything you know, and those are the only regrets. Otherwise, I\nconsider myself one of the luckiest people alive. Listen, I survived all that. I -- in 1981,\nunfortunately I had to go to hospital because thought I was -- I -- I thought I was a heart attack,\nbut they finished up saying me, I had -- it\u2019s nothing. Four hours later I was back in hospital\nhaving had a heart attack. And but they said, well, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a mild one, we\u2019ll keep you here for\nthree, four days and then you can go home. I said, thank you very much. They took me up to the\ncoronary care unit. I was there, my wife came in and for some reason when she walked in, must\nhave been two hours after they brought me in, I started speaking in Yiddish, not in English. And\nI said to her in Yiddish, you know, I -- I don\u2019t think this 1s a good business being here. And the\nnext thing I know I had six doctors around me. And one of them said, do you know what\nhappened to you? I said, I was talking to my wife and I must have fallen asleep. When I said the\nword sleep, I realized -- I was conscious enough then to realize that I didn\u2019t fall asleep, that I\nmust have gone, you know, and they resuscitated me. And then later I found out, you know, they\ntold my wife and my two daughters, who were there already, that my chances of surviving were\nnil, you know. That the -- the next 24 hours and they said go home and pray. And my wife said,\nyou know the Germans tried five years to kill him and they didn\u2019t succeed. So -- and all I can tell\nyou, three weeks later I walked out without medication. And that was 27 years ago. I don\u2019t know\nhow I\u2019m going -- how long I\u2019m going to live, but I certainly survived 24 hours. And I ask again,\nwhy? Why did I escape such a lot of incidents, such a lot of -- the gas chambers, a massive\ncoronary? I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t, you know, there\u2019s no answer to that. But I cannot thank enough\nthe British people what they did for me, first of all they liberated me. They let me come into their\ncountry and I could do whatever I wanted, I had no restriction of movement, I had no restriction\nof business, I could open any business I wanted, you know? So I am thankful to them. I\u2019m\nthankful -- if there is a God, I thank God for what happened to me and I had a very good life.",
        "Q: Are you a religious person? Do you attend synagogue? Do --",
        "A: Iam not a religious person. I go to synagogue twice a year on new year, Rosh Hashanah and\nYom Kippur. This is what I go, it\u2019s nothing to do -- as far as I\u2019m concerned it\u2019s nothing to do\nwith religion, because I sit down and I think of my family and what happened to them, and of\ncourse my grandparents were very religious, so I owe them that, you know. And I -- as I st -- as\nyou remember, I said that I was brought up in a very religious home, but unfortunately after the\nwar, you know, when I asked questions, I couldn\u2019t accept the answers that were given to me\nwhen I asked like a foolish 15 year old, I asked questions that there were no answers to that. But\nthe question the rabbis gave me, I wouldn\u2019t accept. And I --",
        "Q: What was the question and what was the [indecipherable |",
        "A: Well, I ask why. The thing I\u2019m ask that everybody ask. Why. I said okay, grown-up people I\ncan understand. I mean, people committed so many things against people, against God, they were\npunished for it. But a six month old baby being violated, put in a gas chamber? No, I couldn\u2019t\naccept the answer and I was very, very much against religion, so much so when it came to Yom\nKippur, which is, you know, we got to fast 25 hours, we mu -- all we are allowed to do is to pray,\nI used to eat twice as much as normal that day. I used to go to football, I used to go to dog racing,\nI used to do everything, I -- I hated the religion so much. But you know -- because, you know,\nlike everybody else wif -- you always blame God for good or bad, you know? And then I thought\n-- you know, you get older, you\u2019ve got a family and you start thinking. Well, I cannot tell\nanybody that there is a God and nobody can tell me there is no God. I don\u2019t know, and nobody\nelse knows. We -- we think we know. But what I cannot understand, why, if there is a God, why\ndo we blame God for everything? We are the people that doing all those things. God doesn\u2019t tell\nus. It doesn\u2019t say anywhere God tell us to kill people, to let people starve. You see, I -- I mean,\nsix million Jews alone were killed, for no reason. One and a half million children were killed.\nAnd not only Jews were killed. The Gypsy population of -- of Europe was almost wiped out.\nHomosexuals were killed. Disabled people were killed, including German disabled people. And\nit\u2019s only us that doing it, 1t\u2019s not God. When I look today, you know, that I looked -- I watch\ntelevision, when I speak to students and I ask them what they ask me, that old question, can it\nhappen again, I say, don\u2019t you ever watch television or read the newspapers and you what\u2019s\nhappening in Rwanda, Darfur and other places like that? And I think to myself, when I look at\nchildren starving, I -- I\u2019m in such a state. And I don\u2019t see a black child, I don\u2019t see a white child,\nI see a child. And I think -- like I said to the Prime Minister of England, I said, when I was\ninvited to his place, I said why can\u2019t we do something about it, to give a -- to give them each at\nleast in -- a day a -- a bowl of rice, that would keep them alive?

        "Q: And was it hard for you to explain some of the things that you\u2019d been through? Was that ever\na problem for you?",
        "A: Well, we have -- we never -- she knew about it, you know, what she had me speak to other\npeople and so on, and she didn\u2019t ask too many questions. But you know, belonging to that club\nthat she belonged, that every boy there was a Holocaust survivor, not a refugee, not a\nKindertransport, he was a Holocaust survivor. So she knew quite a lot about it without me telling\nher, you see? Then my children -- and even today my children ask more than she does because\nshe knows most of it, you know, and --",
        "Q: Did you ever have -- did you ever hesitate telling your children, or do you think that your\nchildren ever hes -- hesitated asking you?",
        "A: Well, I think it was both. I -- for the first, I would say 25 years, very few of us Holocaust\nsurvivors spoke about it, whether it was [indecipherable] I think there\u2019s many reasons, you\nknow. When we first survived and came to this country, we were 15 - 16 year olds, you know,\nwould people believe us if we told them, you know? They would say well, you know, kids\nexaggerate, children, oh it\u2019s a lot of nonsense, you know. And then, you know, we were so\nwrapped up in -- in work and in marriage and in bringing up a family, now are we going to tell\nthe children? Is it fair to tell the children what you went through? But the children started\nreading. My two daughters at least, you know, that\u2019s t -- watching films and -- and then asking\nquestions, you know, and they realized what it was. And then, you know, the time came that\nsome of us decided we\u2019ve got to do is talk about it, you know. And my two daughters insisted on\ngoing to Auschwitz, and going to Lodz where I\u2019m -- was born. They wanted to see we -- I\u2019m\nvery close to my daughters and I -- they are very close to me and they wanted -- I said -- I said,\nwhy do you want to go? You -- you know all about it, you\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ve read about it. They\nsaid no. We want to feel what you went through. I said, that\u2019s not a -- what for? Anyway, they --\nthey said if I don\u2019t go, after time and again refusing, you know, they said right, we go alone. So I\nsaid I can\u2019t allow that, so we all went. And it was one of the better things I did in life, by doing\nit, because I felt then that I owe it to people -- I owe it to the people that did not survive when I\nspeak to young students, I say -- when they ask me, why do you come and give talks? Surely it\nhurts you, you -- brings back memories. I said, doesn\u2019t matter what it does, I said, there are --\nthere were families, you know, that not one member of them survived. Now who is going to tell\ntheir story? Because all the stories are very similar, you know? So I decided then that I want to\ndo a lot before it\u2019s too late. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve still got. So for the last sort of 15 years,\n20 years, I\u2019ve been going more and more to speak to students mainly, you know, to tell them\nwhat happened because of hatred, bigotry, anti-Semitism, racism, and the main -- the main thing\nI tell them is hate. And I insist -- my last two words to the students is, do not hate. And never\ngive in, never give up. I don\u2019t hate and I certainly didn\u2019t give up. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s why I\nsurvived, but I feel it -- it\u2019s a little bit of a reason why, maybe. The rest -- 99 percent is -- was\nluck. It wasn\u2019t that I was clever, it wasn\u2019t such a -- that I was such a good person or something.\nNo, it was luck and never have the -- the willpower, maybe, to live.",
        "Q: You mentioned that when you went to -- back to Poland, that you went to Auschwitz.",

        "Q: And that your grandson was with you and that he was the same age --",
        "A: Yes, he was 16, you know, he was the youngest of my grandsons. He was 16, of course, I was\n14 and a half, was there. I went, was for the 60\" anniversary of liberation of Auschwitz.",
        "Q: What was that like, how did he react?",
        "A: He -- he wrote about it and he really -- I -- I was very happy that I took him, you know,\nbecause where we were standing on the last day in Auschwitz, with the snow falling, 18 below\nzero an-and he wrote an article, I\u2019ve got it here and I certainly will give it to you. It\u2019s a very short\narticle, and he says how he felt standing there, and he wanted to come over to me and say,\nGrandpa, can we go now, you know, in the coach to go back to Krakow because I\u2019m so cold.\nAnd then I thought, I\u2019ve got two pair of trousers, three pair of socks, two coats -- a pullover, a\ncoat and a hat, boots. And he said -- and in it he says, and then, I thought, there were people like\nmy grandfather here wearing lit -- like pajamas, standing in that cold. How can I go to my\ngrandfather and tell him that I am cold? And he didn\u2019t, and I didn't know about it til I came back\nto England and I found the article, my daughter gave me the article wrote, and it was published\nin a magazine as well afterwards, you know, and I felt -- I felt very proud of him. Like I do about\nall my grandchildren, you know, and --",
        "Q: What\u2019s his name?",
        "A: Elliot Stern. Yes, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s very, very much. He\u2019s one of them -- they\u2019re all interested 1n it.\nI think he\u2019s -- might be more. He comes, tries to listen to those things, you know, and asks\nquestions, you know. A-Another one of my grandson wrote an article -- wrote a play on the\nHolocaust. He is now finishing university, but he was taking the A levels -- \u2019'm sure you know\nwhat the A level is, that\u2019s the last exams the last two years before you go to university. And for\nthat -- so he wrote an article that -- for his -- on the Holocaust and he performed. There were\nseven boys performing [indecipherable] and it was very good. And he asked me very little about\nit, so he must have gone on the internet or books or -- he knew a lot from me without me telling\nhim. And he did well on it. So yes, he\u2019s good. But I was gl -- you asked me before about me\ngoing back to Auschwitz. He was very good because, you know, I saw things that I\u2019ve never saw\nwhen I was in Auschwitz. There was no way I could see those things, you know, you didn\u2019t walk\naround. And first of all, I was in biren -- Birkenau and Auschwitz is just the -- the -- today the\nexhibition place, you know, where you see everything and we all cried, especially when I saw\nthat room under glass with th -- with the babies, with the children\u2019s toys and toothbrushes and\nlittle spectacles, little shoes. And we hugged and we all cried. Said listen, under different\ncircumstances that could have been my children\u2019s things, you know, and -- and they were\nsomebody\u2019s children\u2019s things and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s tragic, you know, it\u2019s -- it -- it was one of the worst\nthings. But when I stood in the tower of Auschwitz [indecipherable] you know, where the things\nare, and I said to my kids, you see, whatever Hitler wanted to do, he did not achieve the end. We\nwon, he lost. Unfortunately, six million people died, but -- Jews, I mean, I -- like I said before,\nother people died.",

Whether he knew much about me, I don\u2019t think so, for a simple reason; my\nmother didn\u2019t know much about me. She didn\u2019t know what I was, what person I was. Listen, I\ncertainly, at 16 or almost 17 wasn\u2019t the same person that she left in Poland when she left us. So I\ndon\u2019t know what he knew about me, you know.

        "A: No. Well, it was -- you see, it was funny, because it\u2019s a very, very similar thing that you got\nhere. We -- in -- a few years ago the -- the museum, the Holocaust Museum was opened in the\nImperial War Museum in London and the quee -- queen was invited to open the museum and\nwhen it was finished she was leaving, she was coming across to meet people and the president of\nthe museum, or -- Englishman, that is the -- was involved in the Holocaust Museum, must have\nsaid something to her, whispered something, that there are some survivors here, and she came\nover and she shook hands with us, you know, with a few of us, and I was one of them that she\nshook hands with me and through my work for the Holocaust Education Trust I was invited to\nher garden party, that was the second time. But years and years ago, quite a long time ago, I was,\nthrough the work I was doing for Save the Children Fund, my wife and I were also invited to the\ngarden party. But that was a long time ago.

It was a big honor for me to meet Gordon Brown, whatever I think of\nhim or don\u2019t think of him, you know. I didn\u2019t tell him whether I\u2019m going to vote for him or not,\nyou know. But no, I felt, as a Holocaust survivor, you know, I felt it\u2019s not only I was invited,\nmost -- I was representing the Holocaust survivors, not only me, and I can tell you one thing, I\nthink my two daughters are more proud of the thing. Everybody I -- people ring me up and you\nknow and it\u2019s friends of my daughters\u2019. Oh, you met the queen, oh, you met -- oh, you\u2019re going\nto Washington, oh, that\u2019s --",
        "Q: Well tell me more about your work with the Holocaust Education Trust.",
        "A: Well, the Holocaust Education Trust 1s -- was formed, oh about 10 years ago by -- it started\nby a rabbi, not Holocaust Education Trust, but he decided -- a local rabbi, Barry Markus, in\nLondon, and he took a group of people to Auschwitz for the day and then somehow they got\ntogether with a group of other people and they decided to form a Holocaust Education Trust,\nwhich is a working people, it\u2019s not a -- they work there full time, and what they do, they also\nteach teachers about the Holocaust. Teachers that have retired, or they want to be in teaching\nprofession any more, and they devote their time for that. They do it -- they get paid for it,\nnaturally, otherwise they couldn\u2019t do it. And they do seminars for young people. But the\nHolocaust Education Trust is mainly interest in taking young people to Auschwitz. Now that,\nafter that rabbi, Rabbi Barry Markus did that, they decided they would be able -- they can afford\nto take two groups of children, around 200 people -- there would be like 160 children. There\u2019 ll\nbe teachers from each school. Because it\u2019s not as a school, it\u2019s about 80 schools. They take two\nstudents from a school, you see, local, 1n London, plus teachers, plus journalists. And they take\nthem just for one day, they go very early in the morning and come back late. And they go to\nAuschwitz, they go to birk -- to Krakow, Auschwitz and Birkenau. The main thing is Auschwitz\nand Birkenau. And they come back and they\u2019ve got the bef -- but, so what I do, or people like\nme, we come and talk to them, because they know very little about the Holocaust. They know\nvery little about the second World War. But now it\u2019s a thing that they\u2019ve got to learn in school,\nit\u2019s -- it\u2019s a must, it\u2019s not whether they want or not. But how much is not -- doesn\u2019t come into it\nbecause how much they can just learn one hour in three months about the Holocaust. So they go\n-- so by doing -- what the Holocaust Education Trust does is they bring them -- they get them\ntogether, and they listen to a Holocaust survivor. Then they get another seminar, then they go to\nAuschwitz and when they come back they go to write about it, what they thought of it, what they\n-- the whole thing and they\u2019ve got to send it in to the Holocaust Education Trust, and a panel sits\nthen pick four schools of two children each and they got to come back to the Houses of\nParliament or to the House of Lords, here in -- and start presenting their stories, what they think,\nthey\u2019re int -- they\u2019re interviewed, they ask questions, you know, and usually some of the\nsurvivors are also there, a few of us. And then one of them is voted as ambassadors of the year.\nSo what they have to do, they\u2019ve got to go to other local schools and tell them all what they saw,\nwhat they heard. And being young people I am very much involved in it because I lungya -- I\nlike young people, and I think it\u2019s very, very imporstant they should know what happened,\nbecause -- and they are lovely students, most of them. I\u2019ve never had any problems, you know?\nIt\u2019s as quiet as anything, you know, and I talk to them for about an hour or so and they ask\nquestions and -- you know, and --",
        "Q: What kind of questions do they ask?",
        "A: Well, all different. Some are a bit silly ones, you know, like naturally young people, they\nwant to know whether I met Hitler, you know. I haven\u2019t been invited to tea by Hitler, but -- but\nthat th -- one of the main question, it\u2019s always asked 1s, do I hate the German people. And they\ncannot understand when I tell them no, I do not hate the German people. Why should I hate\npeople for -- most probably the people that they think I should hate are not alive today. You\nknow, they\u2019re grandparents. And most German people are the same as any other people. Why\nshould I blame something -- body for what their grandfather did, you know? Do I ask me -- do I\nforgive them? Now the people that did it, I haven\u2019t got the right to forgive. If there is a God, God\ncan forgive them. The others are the people that died can forgive. I certainly haven\u2019t got the right\nto forgive, but I certainly do not hate, and I beg of you, when I talk to them, do not hate. Because\nthis is not an answer, to hate. You are the one that will suffer if you hate. So no, I -- I love the\nquestions. Some, like I said, are silly, but some are very [indecipherable] how they -- the usual\nthing, how did you survive? I wish I could tell them. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s one of those things.\nPeople that are -- there are some students that are religio -- religious and they, do you think God\nwanted you to stand -- to stay -- to save you so that you can tell the story? I said maybe, I don\u2019t\nknow. But I feel it\u2019s very important it should be told. We\u2019ve got to have awareness of what\nhappened.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because you know, in another few years there won\u2019t be -- the only thing you\u2019ll be able to do\nis to read about us, what happened to the people in Europe between 1933 and 1945. There won\u2019t\nbe anybody, you know, to substantiate the story. So people say well, is it true, is it not, and you\ncan be the one to say, well, I met a Holocaust survivor. I have been to Auschwitz, I have seen\nwith my own eyes. And I feel that\u2019s important.",
        "Q: Thank you very much for sharing your story with the Holocaust Museum.",
        "A: Well, it was -- it was really -- I don\u2019t know whether pleasure\u2019s the right word, but it was\ncertainly my duty. The more people I tell it to, the more I am satisfied and I am happy about it\nwith -- especially with the feedback I get, which makes me very happy that people do listen.",

The reason, my wife decided when we got\nmarried, because when we had children they had problems at school, you know, is it Zyper, 1s it\nZipper? So we thought the best thing is that we change the spelling, and we did. Now, I was born\nin a city, second biggest city in Poland, called Lodz, L-o-d-zed, and that\u2019s where I lived til I was\ndeported from Lodz.",

And with a Jewish family in the 1930\u2019s Orthodox, divorce was as bad as death, or\neven worse, you know. It was such a terrible thing for a Jewish family, you know. So as far as I\nknew, you know, after awhile, you know, I -- I thought my mother was dead, and I didn\u2019t see my\nmother and that was it. So I was just left with my grandparents, of course, and my father, which\nmy father worked, so I didn\u2019t see that much of him either.

But I suppose\nbecause we lived in a big city, it was a second -- as I said, second biggest city in Poland, and you\nknow, there was a million inhabitants before the war, and 25 percent, like 240,000 were Jewish\npeople. I went to a Jewish school, you know, I -- it wasn\u2019t a cheder or a Orthodox school, it was\na Jewish school, but we learned Hebrew much more so than -- we didn't learn the Bible or things\nlike that.

It was a small school and so I didn\u2019t come\nacross anti-Semitism as much as other children that had to go in the street in school and non-Jew,\nyou know, Polish kids, so -- and they used to throw stones at them, and so on and call them\nnames and there were always fights. I guess I wasn\u2019t out that much, only played in the yard with\nother children, even with Poles. Course, lots of times, you know, there were anti-Semitic\nremarks, but there -- 1t didn\u2019t mean that much to me, I didn\u2019t quite understand what it meant, you\nknow, why are they calling me dirty Jew, or something like that.

But of course you get older and you realize things are not that simple, you know, that\nthere must have been a good reason why she left.",
        "A: Well, in -- in about 19 -- I would say 1938 there was a lot of talk about war. You know, eight\nyear old boy, I mean, what did I know about war? I didn\u2019t even mean -- didn\u2019t realize what it\nmeans there\u2019s a war.

And I said, why are you going away, you know? So I says -- I thought to myself,\nnow here a mother I haven\u2019t got, now I won\u2019t even have a father. Oh no, he says, don\u2019t worry at\nall, Pll be back within six months because there\u2019s going to be a war and the German armies are\ngoing to invade Poland and the first thing they will do is take all the young men away, you know,\nbut you and your grandmother and grandfather and the children a -- they will -- won\u2019t touch\nthem, it\u2019s only the young people. Of course, he couldn\u2019t have been more wrong, but nevertheless\nhe left and I never saw my father again. He run away to Russia and I suppose conditions in\nRussia were not that good either because at that time the Russians already were together with the\nGermans, they split up Poland in half, you know, some part went to Russia and so on. So he\ndecided to come back, and he managed to get to Warsaw, because Warsaw was by then -- the\nwhole of Poland was already occupied by the Germans or by the Russians. But Warsaw was a\noccupied part of Poland by the Germans. L6dz was part of Germany, they annexed it. That\u2019s the\nThird Reich. So he couldn\u2019t get back to us, you see? But that\u2019s what I had found out, later. But\n\u00b039 when he left, you know, and within a few weeks, of course, the German armies came in and\nthings completely changed straight away.",
        "A: Oh yes. I remember certain things, not everything.

And -- and you know, to -- to a -- to a child, even\nnine year old, you know, being brought up as -- in a very Orthodox family, you know, to destroy\na synagogue is -- 1s the most terrible thing that could happen.

I found out because I never traveled on trains, you know,\nbut you couldn\u2019t travel on a train. Jewish doctors couldn\u2019t practice medicine, Jewish teachers\ncouldn\u2019t go to school. And of course, there was no school, you know. I left school when I was --\nin June. That\u2019s where they had stopped it in -- in Poland at the time and I was about nine and a\nhalf years old, and I never went back to school. That was my education in life. And every day\ndifferent things happened. I mean, ya -- you know, we couldn\u2019t -- we weren\u2019t allowed to walk --\nnot that people came out of [indecipherable] they were too frightened to come out, but you know\nyou\u2019ve got to eat, you\u2019ve got to buy food. And food was scarce because Jewish shops weren\u2019t\nopened, they closed them up. We weren\u2019t even allowed to walk on pavements, you know. But of\ncourse children like my age, you know, we got away with it, we walked. But the thing was, you\nknow, they called a je -- a -- a Jewish man, you know, with the long beard, which they knew he\nwas a Jew, you could recognize the Jewish people that were Orthodox, especially in -- in Lodz.\nThey used to -- first thing they did, you know, took out the beard off and I -- and I asked why are\nthey doing, you know, I didn\u2019t ask the Germans, I asked my grandmother, why do they do that?\nThey said, purely to humiliate him, you know, because they know it\u2019s the most terrible thing to\nhave that beard cut off. And then they made him wash the pavement, for no reason at all, just to\ndegrade him, to humiliate him, to -- and you know, you\u2019re not even 10 years old, you cannot\nunderstand why and you keep asking question and there is like always, there\u2019s -- there\u2019s no\nanswers why.",
        "A: No. My grandfather didn\u2019t go out, you see, and he was at home and food was very, very\nscarce and he was getting weaker and weaker and -- and -- because he wouldn\u2019t eat that food that\nwasn\u2019t kosher and kosher food was almost impossible to get. So he lived on bread an-and\npotatoes and things like that, you could still get some. But it was getting more and more difficult\nand then they decided, you know, to recognize every Jew that is not recognizable, we have to\nwear a Star of David and in -- in some places, like in [indecipherable] they used to wear one in\nthe front. We had to wear one in the front and the back so that the minute th-they saw you they --\nthey knew who you were, so you get beaten up, especially the older people, not -- you know, and\nthe children started stealing food wherever they could, you know, to bring home.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yes, when she --",
        "A: -- had to, I -- there was no choice.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember me ever going with her, you know, but we were out, you know. When I say\nstealing food, there was a lot of trees with apples and pears and plums and things like that, you\nknow, whatever there was at that time of the year. You know, we used to go and st-steal and we\nused to get beaten up, but you know, but when you s -- nine, 10 years old, it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a game more\nthan anything else, so we didn't mind, you know, we got beaten up, so we went next day again\nan-and bring home something, you know, and --",
        "A: Not that I can tell. I\u2019m sure she tried, but you know -- you know what that 10 year old child\nis, 1t\u2019s -- you know, he goes anyway, you know. She turns around and he\u2019s out, you know, it\u2019s --\nand that\u2019s what I did, you know. A-And then it\u2019s by November of 1939 we were told, you know,\nI -- I was told by my grandmother, you know, we\u2019ve got to leave our apartment. We\u2019ve got to\nmove to a certain area of Lodz, which was the poorest area of Lodz, which was called Baluty,\nyou know, it\u2019s funny enough, a lot of Jewish people lived there before the war, you see. And of\ncourse, a lot of Polish people lived -- now the Poles had to move out of their apartments and we\nhad to move into theirs. Now, the Poles were very happy about it, because they moved into a\ngood area, a nice apartment, nice furniture, because we couldn\u2019t take much with us, you know,\nand out of the three bedroom apartment we had with a bathroom, you know, a -- we managed my\n-- and I had an aunt also living with us, and the four of us moved into one single room on a\nsecond floor in a -- in a tenement building with stone steps. And it was already November, it was\ngetting very cold. In November it\u2019s full blown winter in Poland and no running water, no toilet\nor everything. And the four of us had one single room, no kitchen, no nothing, you know, and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no. All I remember is going on a horse and cart, you know, with a bit of things we had to\ntake with us, you know, we\u2019ve -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t even know how we found it, that -- that\napartment, but all I remember is living there.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: The other side of town, right across town.",
        "A: Oh yes, there was a whole lot of people going all the time, from morning til night, moving\nthere. I don\u2019t even know how we found, whether we were offered that place, or we were\nallocated that place. I don\u2019t know, that I cannot remember. Maybe I was too young to -- to know.\nBut I know where it was, I remember the name, the street, the number, the second floor, and --",
        "A: Limanowskiego 26. And it was, the thing was, you see, by April the whole -- everybody in\nLodz had to be -- if he was caught outside the ghetto, he was shot. So by that they surrounded\nwith barbed wire. They had -- we had our own Jewish police and a Jewish sort of committee,\ngovernment thing with a -- with a leader of that. His name, I\u2019m sure you know, was Rumkowsk1.\nAnd -- but the street where I lived they had a problem because how would they go from -- the\nGermans or the Poles go from one side of town to the other? So two streets were blocked -- were\n-- the actual road was outside the ghetto with barbed wires. And for us to cross -- we had the\nbridge, or two bridges to cross from one side -- because I worked on the other side, we had to\ncross on a bridge. So they -- which was, in a way for -- for us 1t was lucky, because what was\nhappening, when lorries with food and potatoes or carrots or something, they weren\u2019t in sacks,\nthey were loose -- or they [indecipherable], so, you know, you soon find ways, so we had long\nwires and we used to try to hook them onto the lorries when they were passing, or a horse and\ncart, and move that thing and they fell down and eventually we could get some potatoes or\nwhatever was on the [indecipherable] we had -- we had to try to steal things. But the worst thing\nwas, winter came and you know, we had to go downstairs to fetch water, you know, to pump\nactually water and to carry up [indecipherable] and that I still remember. I remember falling\ndown because it was all frozen, you know, and it was slippery from the water, you know, and --",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t my job, but somebody had to do it. My grandfather could -- certainly couldn\u2019t\ndo it because he was already too ill and, you know, within a very short time he died, in 1940.\nAnd purely from -- from -- I think he had a broken heart because he was so religious and he so\nhad -- even -- even the rabbis came and they said, you know, you can eat anything, because you\nknow, life is more important than anything else. But he wouldn\u2019t and he -- he died from\nmalnutrition and -- and everything else. So it was just left my aunt still there an-and she died\nsoon afterwards as well, and it was just my grandmother and I, and then they said, you know, we\neach could get the ration card, but you had to work. If you didn\u2019t work, you didn\u2019t get the ration\ncard. I was about 10 and a half when I started working in a metal factory.",

        "A: Right at the end of town, there was a Jewish cemetery there. Because as I said too, you know,\nbefore the war there was a lot of Jewish people living in that area, in the poor area, you know,\nand of course so they had a cemetery.",
        "A: Oh yes --",

We had no maids or help.\nYou know, to bring up six children, to -- to cook and wash and as you, I\u2019m sure you know, in\nPoland, you know, a lot of food, you know, you made yourself.

And -- and even the challahs, you know, you baked yourself, and you\nknow, I just -- and I -- all I know is I think my -- my grandmother already had the first child\nwhen she was 16 years old because in them days in Poland, when you were 20 and you weren\u2019t\nmarried, you were already on the shelf, you know, it was a stigma.

        "A: You know ac -- you know, ya -- this you get sa -- no, it wasn\u2019t a question that I a -- I had to\nwork because if I didn\u2019t work then there was no ration card, there was no food. Whatever little\nfood we had, I had to obtain on my ration card. At work we worked like six days a week from\nwhat, I don\u2019t know, seven to seven or something, and there was nightshifts as well, which I\ndidn\u2019t work and lunch time we used to get a soup and -- to keep us going and so on, and I had a\nvery good man that I worked for, that he was the boss of the group of about, I don\u2019t know, 20 or\nso. And he was very good, he tried to look after me for a certain -- to a certain extent, you know.\nWhen he thought that I -- I can\u2019t do it, you know, because I\u2019m so tired, he says go underneath the\nbench and sleep for an hour and so on. Because there was no -- we weren\u2019t surrounded by\nGermans, you know, it was all done by Jews. Everything was Jewish, you know, whether it was\ndoctors or hospital, or whatever, you know. But unfortunately, the food that we were -- were\ngetting, even with the rations, every month, you know, it got worse and worse, or less and less,\nand people are dying of malnutrition and -- and of course, frost and -- 1t was that cold. You\nknow, when the summer came, of course it was a bit better. But every morning we used to go to\nwork, and -- you know and we were -- had to step over dead bodies, cause they didn\u2019t have a\nchance yet -- they had a special group of people that were taking the bodies away and then taking\nit to the -- I suppose there were mass graves, you know.",

        "A: No.",
        "A: No. She --",
        "A: -- I -- yes, oh yes. I -- you were quite safe, you know, as far as walking in the ghetto, you\nknow, you had no problems there, you know. But unfortunately, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s the -- the\nmain thing there was the food and -- and the conditions we lived in. And, you know, by the time\nwe -- we went into the ghetto we were about 150,000, eventually finished with 70,000. But\npeople were dying. Also people that were coming in and sending -- they said we need 5,000\npeople to go out to work, you know, in -- in labor camps. Which wasn\u2019t true, we found out later\nbecause the people that were taken, you know, they were like -- but the problem was they took\npeople out so that you thought there was more room. But then what the Germans did, the S -- the\nNazis, the SS or whoever they were, they were liquidating all the small ghettos because they said\nit\u2019s useless having more guards to guarding small ghettos, we\u2019ll take those people and send them\nto the bigger camp -- ghettoes like Lodz or Warsaw or whatever there was. So every time they\nsent people in, you know, from other ghettoes, so it was -- it was never enough room for people\nto -- to -- to exist, to live, to --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: You know, they sat and you know, they told us how bad it is there. They didn\u2019t realize how\nmuch worse it is in our ghetto, because Lodz was -- Lodz and Warsaw was one of the worst\nghettos in Poland you know, because [indecipherable] was -- a small ghetto was not, but we were\nso overcrowded, you know, and -- and like I said, overcrowded. In the winter it was cold, in the\nsummer -- I don\u2019t know what was worse, because disease in the summer was worse, you know.\nLuckily that -- that at least we had enough water to wash.",
        "A: Well, as far as I know, all the years I was in the ghetto, I wasn\u2019t ill. I had no problem with\nillness. I was problem with lack of food. I was -- you know, 1 -- hunger is a funny thing. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter how much you eat, you\u2019re still hungry, because it\u2019s all in your mind most of the\ntime. You know, even when I had -- when we used to go out sort of near the outskirts of the\nghetto, you know, and there was some stuff we could steal, you know, and -- so we used to go, a\nfew of the kids used to go out and you know, then we were either at the borders, you know, of it\n-- of -- where the barbed wire, you were hit by the Germans, or the Jewish police culture, you\nknow, we were sort of -- have the -- our jackets or shirts inside the trousers, so that we could put\nthe food away there and they caught us, they just opened it up and the food came out. We got a\ngood hiding and we run back home and that was it. But then -- but they didn\u2019t stop us going\nagain, you know. But if -- there were times, of course, that we managed to get home with some\nfood and we had so much food, and -- but we were still -- it doesn\u2019t matter how much we had,\nwe were hungry.",
        "A: Well yeah, of course.",
        "A: Yes, but the worst thing was -- you see, was in -- I think it was 1942, the Germans decided\nthey need 10,000 people, you know, a day or something like that, something -- an enormous\namount of people --",
        "A: -- and they\u2019Il do it in a week and they\u2019ll take them away, so most of the people they would\nhave taken away. But I asked the -- which I don\u2019t think it could have been 10,000, but they said -\n- the Jewish police have to go and give them every day so many people to bring out. But of\ncourse they came to the -- to the Jewish homes and they got beaten up by the people. Nobody\nwould have given away people, you know, nobody would go. And then the Jews -- so the\nGermans said there is no way they can do it, so they said they are going to do it themselves, and -",
        "A: Oh yes. Not the Jewish police, I don\u2019t remember them coming, but the Germans said right,\nwe're going to do it systematically, nobody\u2019s going to work for a whole week. And from\nMonday onwards, you know, they went from street to street, house to house and everybody had\nto come down and they took people away and they said they\u2019re taking them to work. But you\nknow, as young as I was, you know, I -- I realized, you know, you don\u2019t take people to work that\nare disabled people, old people, women and children. And my grandmother was hidden\nsomewhere and I went down and they took me, they slung me on the lorry and it was a similar\nscene, funny enough, like in \u201cSchindler\u2019s List.\u201d And I -- I don\u2019t know why it was so bad and I\nwas alone, I s -- I would have thought why did I want to escape? Maybe because I thought to\nmyself I\u2019ll be alone and I wanted to be back with my grandmother and I jumped off the lorry.\nAnd the Germans were inside the yard, you know, had they stepped out they would have seen\nme, they would have shot. I\u2019m sure they would have hit me because I wouldn't have been that far\naway. Anyway, I -- I was lucky once again and I run and I hid myself in the house and I stayed\nthere for hours. And I remember a distant cuz -- well, it -- a distant cousin came and he also\nescaped, also jumped off the lorry and he escape and I remember -- I remember like today and he\nsays, come on, let\u2019s go home, cause we lived in the same sort of block or yard or something. And\nI started screaming at him, I was in such a state, you know. Eventually, of course, I did. But the\nfunny thing was, it --",
        "A: I just screamed at him that why he said to me we should go back home, I was -- I don\u2019t know,\nI was -- my mind was completely -- I was completely confused, you know, and -- but a funny\nthing happened that that boy, that cousin of mine was the only one of his family that survived,\nand not so ma -- and he was very religious.

        "A: Oh yeah -- no, we had to go downstairs, they didn\u2019t come. Everybody had to leave and they\nsearched the rooms, you know, and downstairs they said they just picked up people and -- and --\nand I saw women, children, disabled people, it\u2019s not -- something is not right, and this was the\nreason it made me jump -- jumped off the lorry, and you know, and -- and we found out later,\nyou know, we never had all those people again, so we knew that they were -- where they were\ntaken I don\u2019t know, but they were certainly -- at that time there was no Auschwitz yet -- you\nknow, I mean there was Auschwitz because Auschwitz was built much earlier, but 1t wasn\u2019t built\nfor Jews, it was built for Polish prisoners of war, you know, and certainly Birkenau wasn\u2019t in\nexistence. And you know, in -- within two days we went back to work and we carried on and --\nand things got worse and worse and worse, til it carried on like that til 1944.",

And were -- the factory that I worked for, the\nmetal factory, when we -- the Lodz ghetto was liquidated because they said the Russians are\ngetting nearer, and we\u2019ve got to -- they\u2019re going to send us to working camps inside Germany,\nand so street by street, day by day, they were taking away peop -- people had to report to the\nrailway station and they were allowed to take one suitcase. They said when we get there we get\nmore clothes and all the rest of it. But me, they didn\u2019t take -- they didn\u2019t tell us to come from the\nhouse where I lived then, but from the factory, because I said they were going to take us to\nGermany and we\u2019re going to work in a metal factory there.

        "A: Yes, oh yes, he must have been about 30 at the most, you know. You know, to me he wasn\u2019t a\nyoung man, you know, and I -- I was 10 years old, 11 years old, 12 years old, a -- he wasn\u2019t a\nyoung man, you know, but he was a very young man.",
        "A: Rest, oh yes.",
        "A: There were a few other children. I d -- I don\u2019t remember whether the others, you know, I -- I\nha -- I don\u2019t know what it 1s, but I -- I think I\u2019ve always had a -- in Yiddish they would say\nchutzpah, you know. And I still have. I\u2019m 78 years old and I still have a chutzpah today, you\nknow. And I think I get away with many things which others might not have got away with them.\nSo he was very good to me as that was, you know, and there were some good people there. Not\nmany, but there were some. It\u2019s -- 1t wasn\u2019t a question that a -- I mean, people become very\nselfish, you know, everybody wants to live, so why, if he\u2019s got something more than you, why\nshould he share with you, you know? You gotta be a real great person to do that, and you know,\nnot many people are around like that, to share their last piece of bread or something, you know.\nBut there were some, and I came across them.",
        "A: Yes, they told us that we\u2019re going to Germany, and that we\u2019re going to build the factory. And\nagain we had to get just one suitcase, and I went with my grandmother to the station. She also\ncame -- as I was in the metal factory, she came with my group, as a group. And we went to the\nstation, reported to the station.",
        "A: No, she didn\u2019t work.",
        "A: But nevertheless, she came with us, you know.",
        "A: Yes, well, they allowed --",
        "A: -- yes -- well, yes. And as we arrived, you know, th-there were cattle trucks waiting for us,\nyou know, which I couldn\u2019t understand, you know, and they just said, take a suitcase, get onto\nthe cattle trucks. We were helped by the Jewish police. And this is when it started. We thought,\nyou know, that things are bad in -- 1n -- in the ghetto, but that\u2019s when our trouble started,\nbetween 1944 and 1945, those were the worst -- the worst year, well it was less than a year that\nhappened to me that stand out in my -- mostly in my -- first of all I was already older. I was\nalready, you know, I was 14 years old, 14 and a half. I was already -- to my way of thinking, I\nwas already a grown up person already. And when they put us in the -- those trucks, do you\nknow, it was just impossible to survive. It was so packed, you couldn\u2019t breathe. And do you\nknow, today, I said that many times, you know, I feel ashamed, not only for other people, for\nmyself, what can happen to a person, that when we stopped -- th-th-the train stopped somewhere\nafter a day or so, and -- and there were a few people were dead, you know. First of all there --\nthere was no water to drink. You remember like I said to you, we\u2019re -- it was July, August, in the\nsummer in Poland, the heat. You know, you talk about your sort of 90 degrees or something like\nthat, packed like sardines. And people, you know, elderly people, people that ha-had problems\nwere dying and -- and I\u2019m so ashamed today, you know, when I think of it, how could I have\never done that, say thank God they died, there\u2019Il be more room for us, you know? And of course\nat that time it -- that\u2019s how I felt, but -- and most people, and -- but today when I think back, like\nI wasn\u2019t human any more, you know? How can a human being think like that? To be that selfish,\nyou know? But unfortunately that\u2019s how it is, you know. I -- I saw children stealing a piece of\nbread from their father. I saw a father s-stealing a piece of bread from -- from a child. And do\nyou know I\u2019m a father today and a grandfather and I think I would rather die than do that. But if I\nwould have a father then, would he steal from me, or would I steal from him? Maybe. I don\u2019t\nknow, you know. You\u2019ve got to be in that position to realize. It\u2019s easy to say how could he do it,\nbut today, you know what, I\u2019ve got a family and I\u2019ve got -- I\u2019m not short of -- of anything, you\nknow. When I say anything, food, or drink, or -- I can say that. Would -- how would it have been\nin those circumstances, you know, if I was starving and knowing that my child has got a piece of\nbread, could I have stolen it? May -- I definitely say today no, but I don\u2019t know. You have to be\nin those circumstances to realize whether you can do it or not. And we traveled for a few days\nand it was less and less people in -- in -- in -- in the coaches, you know. And eventually one\nmorning at about, must have been five, six o\u2019clock in the morning, the train stopped, and you\nknow, we could see through the slats, you know, of the truck, something written up, Oswiecim,\nand then it said Auschwitz and I -- didn\u2019t mean anything to me, an-and the grown up people say\noh, it\u2019s a concentration camp, and I didn\u2019t know what a concentration camp was. And they\nopened it, the gates and straight away in German they started shouting, raus, raus, raus. And\nthere were people sort of wearing striped things and striped caps and we did -- still didn\u2019t\nunderstand that. And it was -- like I said, 1t was in the summer and it was hazy, the sun was hazy\nbecause it was very early in the morning. And there was like a haze, yellow haze, and then we\nsaw chimneys and we saw that\u2019s bakeries, or [indecipherable] whatever it 1s there, and -- and\nthen, as I said, we had to jump down, you know, and it was pretty high, and some of those people\nthat were there, they were Jewish inmates of Auschwitz that helped people to jump down. We\nweren't allowed to take our suitcase, they said, you leave everything behind. When you get to\nwhere we going, we get our luggage back, you know, and of course, we didn\u2019t. And then we had\nto go through a selection committee. And here we go again, I was lucky again. Being in the\nfactory, we were a main transport that went through the selection committee. Women, children,\ndisabled people, everybody went through. We were 500 and odd people. But the train had many\nmore people on it, and all the others had to go -- the selection, there were German officers with\ndogs and batons, you know, and everywhere -- and they were rushing them, and you know it was\nright and left, right and left. And then we realized what was happening, that the people going to\nthe right were disabled people, women with babies, with children. And some of them -- and there\nwere screams, you know, because they -- they -- they took the child away and the woman they\nsaid to go to the left. And of course, can you imagine a mother giving up a child. So the mother\nrun towards it, she was beaten, but she was left with the child. And they said they\u2019re going to\ntake them to showers, but we found out soon afterwards, you know, beca -- from the guards,\nfrom the Jewish people that were [indecipherable] that an hour after a -- that train arrived in\nAuschwitz, in Birkenau, you know, those people were dead. They were gassed and put in -- and\nhow can a human being do that? Taking a child, a p -- a person, a woman, a disabled person,\nwhoever and put in a gas oven, and then burned? It just -- but unfortunately I learned. I\u2019m now\nan old man so I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s -- appear it\u2019s happening today. I mean, maybe not to the --\nthat extent and maybe not to the Jewish people, but it\u2019s happening. And us they took to -- the\npeople that went to the left, we all went to showers. They were actually showers, they were not\ngas -- they were not gas cha -- crematoriums, gas chambers. And we had to take all our clothes\noff and we never saw it again. They shaved everybody, whoever had hair, wherever you had hair\nhad to be shaved, women and men. And we came out and they gave us striped clothing. And of\ncourse the women went separate to a different one, we went separate. And had a -- one of those\ncaps. They didn\u2019t tattoo us at the time, it was -- I don\u2019t know whether that was because we were\nwith a group, or whether they didn\u2019t tattoo any more people, but they -- but we had a number, so\nat that time that was -- I wasn\u2019t Ziggy Shipper, I was 83303. Not that anybody called me by the\nnumber or so, but that\u2019s what I had writ -- a stripe, think here.",
        "A: On my jacket, yes, an-and trousers. And I remember like today, and I don\u2019t know why, you\nknow, they just gave me a uniform, one of those striped thing. I mean, they didn\u2019t say oh, you are\nsmall, we give you a small one, big one, and I got a very big one, and I don\u2019t -- and you know\nthat my trousers went almost to -- under my arms. And somebody came, oh I got the smaller one,\ncan you give me the bigger one? I don\u2019t know why, you know, I remember like today I said no.\nMaybe I thought because it\u2019s bigger itll be warmer in the winter or something. I didn't know\nhow long I\u2019m going to wear those. Anyway, after the showers, disinfection, haircut, you know,\nshaving, we -- they went into barracks. Now that I -- we expected many things, but we didn\u2019t\nexpect that. I don\u2019t know whether you know what it looked like. I went back after the war to see\nthat and you know, it was bunks, three bunks, one out -- above the other. You know, three bunks,\nI don\u2019t remember if I was in the bottom or middle. I think I was in the middle bunk. Three\npersons to a bunk, you know. Two one way, one that. And straw and every morning we used to\nget the -- it was hot, you were -- could suffocate. Every morning we had black coffee and a piece\nof bread. Every evening we had -- we didn\u2019t work. We just had to stand outside all day long, you\nknow, and then go back.\nBeginning Tape Three",

It wasn\u2019t like -- it wasn\u2019t\nlike being in the ghetto, you know, that every week it got a bit worse and more people are dying\nand -- and people are dying of starvation and whatever else, of illness, and you know. But here it\nwas something happened so fast, you know, an-and -- and the people kept asking, where are\nthey? Where\u2019s my wife, where\u2019s my mother, where\u2019s my child, where\u2019s -- you know, the ma --\nmen would be saying, you know, and then -- and there was no answer, because there wasn\u2019t\nother camps that you could see them. You know, where have they gone? But they soon found\nout, you see, because the -- the inmates, you know, th-the ones that were doing all the cleaning\nup and the disposing of the bodies, you know, and so on after they were gassed they had to put\nthem in the ovens, you know, and -- to cremate them in. They asked them, and they were soon\ntold, you know, what it is. But you know, even then, as a 14 year old boy, you doi -- 1-it didn\u2019t\nsort of -- possibly, personally, I was lucky.

And at 14 and a half, do you care what happens to other\npeople, you know? And especially in the position where we are all in, like I said to you before,\nyou become so selfish and so hard, that all you care is about yourself, don\u2019t care about anybody\nelse. Because you are not human any more. They dis-humanized you. You know, yo-you -- you\nbecome a terrible person. I found that out years later [indecipherable].

And we went to a concentration camp called -- 1t wasn\u2019t a\nextermination camp, it was a concentration camp called Stutthof, which was very near Danzig.\nNow there was a bigger problem because as hot as it was in Auschwitz, we were going on to the\nBaltic. And after a few weeks in that camp -- the camp was west, the living accommodation --\nand the food was even worse than Auschwitz. We again didn\u2019t work, but it was getting late, you\nknow, after a few weeks, you know, it was getting September, October, November, most people\nthat were with us, even from that group, were dying. You know, the elderly people were dying,\nyou know, from sp -- pure starvation and disease. And what we were saying when I -- I was\nasked, was I small, or was I tall, or was I, for a child of 14 and a half or so, I was\n[indecipherable] at 15. No, I was small. And what we did, when it was cold in the camp they\nmade human ovens. What it meant to people was sort of getting together and make group and get\nbigger, bigger, bigger, sort of a round thing. And what we were supposed to do, the people from\ninside were coming out and going outside. And so me, I came out, but I soon managed, as being\nvery little, I managed to get in -- back inside t-to --",

        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: The only work that we\u2019re do -- the only work we had to do was carrying big stones from one\nof the camp to the other side. When it was there we -- they had to carry it back to the other.\nThere was no work there. There was just -- they wanted to kill you, but there was no such a thing\nas -- as they took you to the -- only if you were ill. Of course there, there was no hospitals or\nanything. They straight away took you to the gas chamber. They only had one gas chamber, one\ncrematorium. And that -- the only problem was in the winter, if somebody did escape and there\nwas w -- a person missing, we had to stand there all day long in the cold, in below freezing\ntemperatures to stand there, you know. And then what happened -- of course, food was even\nscarcer than it was in Auschwitz. Then they said they wanted 20 young people to go to work in a\ncat -- in a working camp. And I said -- they said, who is 17, and I couldn\u2019t volunteer 17, I was 14\nand a half and my size was about 12 years old. And they said there wasn\u2019t enough, so they said,\nwho is 16? And I stood on my toes and I lifted my hand. And everybody said, all the others were\nsaying don\u2019t volunteer, don\u2019t volunteer, they\u2019re going to kill you. I said, listen, if I stay here Pll\nbe dead within a very short time. No food and cold and frost. I\u2019m going. And so they took 20\nboys, all Polish boys, Jewish boys, you know, and they took, by passenger train -- oh, they gave\nus -- by the way, they gave us new winter clothes, which was the same stripes, but warmer. So I\nsaid, well it\u2019s getting better already. A -- and they -- you know, listen, everything is -- is a matter\nof -- it\u2019s relative to it, you know, it -- and they took us on passenger trains, oddly enough, to a\nplace called Stolp in Pomerania.",

        "A: Nothing, she -- I don\u2019t remember exactly the words she said. I suppose she must have said\nsomething in Yiddish to bless me, or something. And maybe that helped, you know, and I -- they\ntook us, like I said, on those passenger trains. We arrived at that Stolp. And the only thing that\nwas better, it was in the winter, still Pomerania, which is very cold. But it was warmer for us\nbecause we worked on a railway yard, you see, to do with the trains and so on, I don\u2019t know\nwhat. And the food was even slightly better. We -- at least we got something, a piece of bread in\nthe morning and in the evening and lunchtime we had the soup. And we had -- we worked for\nGerman people, and not the army, just German people.",
        "A: We were guarded by the -- but we worked for -- it was a factory there, that we worked at.",
        "A: It is that -- today it\u2019s Poland, at that time it was Germany, it was east.",
        "A: East, yes.",
        "A: Yes. It was -- it\u2019s about -- I would say about 50 kilometers from Danzig, you know, so it was\nalso near the Baltic, but it wasn\u2019t on the Baltic. And also the advantage was, there were only\nJewish people in that camp. This was a labor camp, there was no extermination, like I said. And\nworking on the railways, there\u2019s always a chance to steal some food.",
        "A: There were passenger trains, there were goods trains. Thank God there were goods trains so\nwe could [indecipherable] goods train, we managed to eat whatever their goods they were\ncarrying, we managed to get them, we managed to steal some carrots or potatoes or beets. The\nonly thing was, whatever we stole we had to eat raw there. We couldn\u2019t cook it, there was\nnowhere to cook. But it didn\u2019t -- it tasted very good, you know. Doesn\u2019t matter, when you\u2019re\nhungry everything tastes good. You know, the unfortunate part was there, that one day five boys,\nolder than I was, they stole some cigarettes or tobacco that was going to the German army, to the\nfront, where they were fighting. And they were caught. So they put them -- there was a little\nroom like a disinfection room, with no windows, nothing. They put them there and they kept\nthem there for a week, then they said -- then they announced they\u2019re going to let them out. But\nthe problem was they -- we had to come and see those boys. I don\u2019t know how those boys\nsurvived without water, without food, without anything in that thing. But when we came to the\nsquare where they were going to let out, we saw gallows, five gallows and little stools standing\nthere. And they took those boys out, they put those ropes round their neck -- five boys, and I\nmean, I\u2019ve seen people die next to me, you know, and -- but I\u2019ve never seen somebody young,\nyou know, putting a rope around their necks and going to hang. And they were start to read out\nwhy they\u2019re being, you know, German, another thing, they had to -- why did they have to say\nwhy? They were going to hang them. But those five boys didn\u2019t give them a chance, even. They\njumped off the stools and they killed themselves, th-they didn\u2019t wait for the Germans to kill\nthem.",
        "A: All five of them. And that was, like I said, the first time I saw people being hanged, actually,\nyou know, people not dying, but being people killed. I mean, when they took away the people to\nthe gas chambers, we didn\u2019t see it, we only saw the people taking away. But here I -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s --\nit -- do you know, I can see it today like it\u2019s happening now, in front of me, of -- of -- of course,\nwhat happened then. Then we started working again and going back to the factory and work\nagain.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, just seeing that German was fear enough, you see. But no, and --\nand then of course, what was happening that the Russians are getting nearer again, so they took\nus to another camp. Don\u2019t ask me where it was, but it wasn\u2019t very far from where I was in\nPomerania. A place called Buschgraben, which was a German name, most probably it wa -- it\nwas still in Poland, so it was -- I don\u2019t know what it was called in -- in -- in Polish. And there we\nstayed, there we did nothing. We had no food, no drink. And the Russians were so near us, the\nRussian soldiers, that at night we could hear the music. During the day we saw the planes flying\nover, you know, very low and the Russian would say we could -- you could see the pilots in the\nplane. And one sort of afternoon we looked around and we couldn\u2019t find any Germans. We were\nfree. And so we said th-the -- the boys sort of my age, you know, said right, let\u2019s go over to the\nRussians, you know. At least we get some food and drink. But the grownups said you can\u2019t do\nthat because they might -- they won\u2019t know who you are, they might kill you, they might shoot at\nyou. So we said all right, we went to s -- we went to sleep that night, you know, woke up in the\nmorning we were surrounded by the SS troops, by the Nazis again. And they were coaches\nwaiting for us.",

        "A: Car -- well, you know, big. Like buses, you know? Luxury buses. And today I cannot\nunderstand it. They didn\u2019t have enough petrol for their soldiers, but they had petrol to transport\nJews. And they said now they\u2019re going to st -- again, every time they\u2019re going to send us to\nGermany. And they said we go back to Danzig. And we went back to Stutthof to wait, which was\neven -- there was no gas, there wa -- and there was no electricity, there was no water, people are\ndying. But we stayed there only a few days and then they said now they\u2019re going to take us to a\nboat and they\u2019re going to put us on boats and we\u2019re going to Denmark.",
        "A: To den -- yes, well, Denmark was occupied by the --",
        "A: -- Germans.",
        "A: Yes, but they took us away, you know, so most probably next day the Russians were there,\nthey -- they occupied that place. But us they took away. The whole camp that was there in\nBuschgraben, and they say -- as I said, they were going to take us to Denmark. There wi --\neverything will be better. And it was already getting late, 1t was already March, April or so in --\nin -- SO we went to that port and they put us on -- into barges, like you carry coal, or wheat or\ncorn.",
        "A: Open, and there was no watcher [indecipherable] you know, there was -- I mean, it could be\nclosed, they could close the hatches, you know, but there was nothing on top. There was, well,\njust for you -- just for transporting goods. It wasn\u2019t a ship, you know, it was -- and they put us in\nthose barges. And they said we arrive in Denmark, everything [indecipherable] I\u2019m sure\nDenmark was already liberated by then. We didn\u2019t know that. And we were only for about 10\ndays, eight to 10 days.",
        "A: There was no f -- no food, no drink, nothing. It wasn\u2019t a question like when we left the ghetto,\nwe could take a little bit of food with us. Here we had nothing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know exactly, but it was more than just one camp, you know.",
        "A: It must have been about a thousand people there.",
        "A: You know what -- you know -- but there wasn\u2019t one barge, there was many barges. You\nknow, we also had luck [indecipherable] we had some Norwegian and Danish prisoners of war\non those barges and they were treated much better than us, because they were prisoners of war,\nso they used to get better food. They were much more able-bodied people. And that was very\nlucky for us, but anyway, at that time I already had typhus. I didn\u2019t know then I had typhus, but I\nfound out later. Now, you can imagine having an illness like typhus, never mind medication, that\nwas, of course, out. There was no medication. But there was no water. And I think what saved\nme again -- it\u2019s funny -- that I was so ill that I didn\u2019t drink the salt water, cause I didn\u2019t have a\nchance to get it. A lot of people drank the salt water, within one day they were dead, because\nthey swelled up and they just died. Cause you -- you can imagine how much salt there is 1n that\nwater. Now --",
        "A: I should imagine so.",
        "A: A-As far as I know, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I was almost conscious, semi-conscious, I suppose. And after -- I said we were traveling for\nabout 10 days and one -- one evening we were very near land and the German -- the troops, the\nSS, the whoever was guarding us got off those barges, then we were just alone. But we couldn\u2019t\nhave -- we weren\u2019t on land, they went across on little boats. So the Norwegians, when I said why\nwe were lucky that they [indecipherable] the Danish, they said, you know what, if you want to,\nwhoever wants to, we will take over onto dry land. Because there were still little boats left. So\nslowly, right through the night, they took every person off, onto land. Some people escaped.\nWell, I wasn\u2019t in a state to escape, I do -- I couldn\u2019t walk, never mind run. The Germans came\nback in the morning and they saw what happened, they didn\u2019t put us back on the boat. We are 15\nkilometers away from a town, which is a naval town called Neustadt. We go there, our boat that\nwe are -- got to go on it will be waiting for us to go --",
        "A: -- yeah, to go. So we had to go on a march. And ev --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Some of them ran away, I don\u2019t know how many ran away. Not that it was important to us --",
        "A: -- you know.",
        "A: Yeah, well they didn\u2019t count us --",
        "A: -- you know. Whoever was there they took away. And that was one thing. You had to walk. If\nyou fell you were shot on the spot. There was no transport and they weren't going to leave you\nthere. And they were not going to carry you. So luckily I ha -- I was with friends that I was\ntogether during all the times even from Poland, from the ghetto, through the camps together and\ntwo of them managed to carry me -- sort of half carry, half walk and somehow, don\u2019t ask me\nhow, I don\u2019t know, once again I survived and we arrived eventually. If we started a thousand\npeople, we might have finished up about three, 400, the rest fell and were shot.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know exactly, but 1t took hours and hours. And it was only another 50 kilometers, like\n10 miles. Shouldn\u2019t have take -- well, to a able bodied person it wouldn\u2019t have taken that long.\nAnyway they -- we arrived at the place and it was a port and it was a boat waiting for us. That\u2019s\nth -- the only time they told us the truth. It was a proper ship, a liner, you know? Atlantic ocean\nliner, it wasn\u2019t some little ship. And there was already a transport of people from other camps on\nthat ship. We didn\u2019t know then, but the re -- we found out, because there were planes going\naround and we knew it couldn\u2019t be German planes. We didn\u2019t know whether they were Russians,\nAmericans or British. It turned out they were British planes, and all of a sudden they started\nbombing. And they hit that boat, but they didn\u2019t hit it that it was completely damaged, you know,\nand they started -- people started shouting, screaming that we\u2019re on the boat. That\u2019s how we\nfound out that there were other people on the --",
        "A: Oh yes, we were just in front, like in front waiting to go on it. But they couldn\u2019t do it because\nof the -- the bombing. And the people started screaming and jumping into the water and of\ncourse some of them drowned, you know. And we were waiting and waiting, waiting and it took\n-- must have been at least a half an hour and then it stopped, so we didn\u2019t know whether they --\neverybody was already jumped off or they were dead, whatever it was. And then about av -- 10\nminutes, 20 minutes later, we heard people shouting again, but it was different. They were\nwaving things. We couldn\u2019t understand what was happening. And then all of a sudden we looked\naround and we didn\u2019t see any Germans. We were surrounded by the British army tanks. That was\nthe third of May, 1945. And I went over to the -- to the tank and the first thing -- he was talking\nto me in English and I didn\u2019t know what he was saying, you know. And the only thing I kept on\nsaying is in -- in German, wasser, wasser. You know, wasser, he must have understood wasser,\nwater, you know and he gave me some water. This is the first water I drunk after 10 days. And\nnot only that I drunk after 10 days, as a free man, you know. I don\u2019t think I appreciated the free,\nyou know, because I didn't know, and of course then they threw me a little parcel as well, and I\nmanaged to hide it. A usual thing, I thought no, everybody\u2019! want it, and it was true, everybody\nwanted [indecipherable] they didn\u2019t realize that we are free, that we can get food as much as we\nwant. And they -- straight away some others came and some people could speak German, you\nknow, some people -- British soldiers. And you know, they said you are free now, you can do\nwhatever you want, you can go around. You can rope, you can steal, you can kill, do whatever\nyou want. Well, of course, being Jewish and being a child, all we were interested was to get\nfood. And this, to a certain extent, I wish they wouldn\u2019t have done that, I wish they would have\nkept us and put us in -- somewhere in a camp and give us food. Not tell us that we can go and\ntake whatever we want, because I would imagine that the first month of the liberation, more\npeople died than in previous months purely from overeating. You couldn\u2019t -- our stomachs\ncouldn\u2019t take it. And here we were just eating for the sake of it, you know, we couldn't -- we\nwere right up to our necks in food, you know. We were eating meat and jam and cheese,\neverything together. And the British were so good to us, you know. Every time they -- they used\nto come in, they -- first of all they said to us, go and live wherever you want. We, a few of us\nfound a prison. So we thought we\u2019ll stay there. But not where the prisoners -- there was no\nprisoners, but where the guards must have slept, you know, and that was first time in years of so\nwhite sheets, you know, and -- and of cour --",

        "A: Well, the natural thing was rape, you know, rape and murder and stealing and -- we were\nstealing, well, in a way we didn\u2019t think we were stealing, the food was there in the open.",

It was open, it was -- nobody was there, you know, you could take\nwhatever you wanted, you know, and like I said, you know and I slept in that prison with white\nsheets for the first time in my life, you know. But the funny thing was I woke up in the morning,\nI -- I didn\u2019t have a bath or a shower even then, I mean, this was the least of my problems, you\nknow. Food was the only problem. And got up -- but when I got up in the morning I looked at\nmy sheet and it looked so dirty, and I said, well, it must be from my body, you know, I -- I -- I\nhaven\u2019t washed for -- for -- for days and days, for weeks. And the same clothes, there was no\nother clothes. Only one shirt, one pair of boots, you know, which were wooden clogs. And I\nlooked at it and then -- then I saw things were moving and then I realized that it was lice. And of\ncourse, I was covered completely with lice. You know, but this didn\u2019t matter, you know, as long\nas I had food. And every morning, you know, they -- the British troops, soldiers were coming\nand with the Red Cross vans and they said anybody that wants to go hospital, and you know, and\nI ne -- I -- somehow my typhus didn\u2019t sort of exist any more, you know. And -- but I\u2019m sure I\nwas still very, very ill, and -- but I laughed. I said, why do they want to take us to the hospital?\nNow we\u2019ve got everything. Everything in life was food. That\u2019s the only thing we are orientated.\nThree days later when they came I said I would like to go to hospital, but I won\u2019t manage\nbecause whatever I had came down, came out of me. And they took me to a hospital in Neustadt.\nI was -- they took away my clothes, I was -- had nothing and -- and then th -- they put me to bed.\nAnd I, even now I was -- I was very, very ill. I was -- I don\u2019t know what was wrong with me, I\nwa -- but I was semiconscious. And do you know -- and they asked me, do you want anything?\nAnd don\u2019t ask me why, the only thing I wanted is salami. It\u2019s just one of those stupid things\nwhen I think of it today. Well, of course I didn\u2019t get that [indecipherable] they put me to bed and\nfor three months I was in the hospital you know, when -- when I was already okay, I couldn\u2019t get\nout of bed, I couldn\u2019t walk.",
        "A: I was t -- yeah, I couldn't -- they had to teach me to walk, you know. And you know tha -- I\nsaid, what is wrong with me, they said nothing. What was wrong with me? Also nothing, you\nhad typhus when you came in but otherwise there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong, but you know --\nand I remember such stupid thing, I couldn\u2019t walk. But when I was in bed, you know, and the --\nthe -- the -- there was the American people were coming in from Joint, the American jo -- Joint --",
        "A: Yeah, and they were bringing us chocolates and cigarettes you know, so -- and you know that\n-- that mind that work, that -- that -- to steal, you know. So of course you didn\u2019t steal, you didn\u2019t\nhave to steal, but wo -- we were doing, you know, the -- I mean, I was only -- I didn't need it,\nyou know, I had enough food in the hospital. But when they came, to -- to the children they gave\nchocolates. To the grownup that were there they gave cigarettes. So of course when they -- the\npeople that -- with the chocolates ha -- came, so I was there, sitting up in bed and I took the\nchocolate. When I knew the people with the cigarettes are coming, I covered myself over the\nhead.

        "A: Oh, there were -- there were already -- first of all, after a few months, the German nurses were\ndoing everything and I spoke German t -- you know, I spoke Yiddish and a bit of German, you\nknow, mixed it up. They understood. And some of the soldiers even, you see, the ones that\nliberite -- that liberated us went -- carried on fighting, you know. So the -- the ones that came in\nwere different already and there were some soldiers that could speak Polish, there were soldiers\nthat could speak Yiddish, there were Jewish soldiers, so there was no problem. So -- and the\nthing was that it was already three months after the liberation, so the -- the -- the German nurses\nalready were girlfriends of British soldiers, you see? So she said to me, I try to get you\nsomething to wear, one of the nurses and she brought me a British uniform, you know. I said,\nthat\u2019s very nice, but I mean, I\u2019m a little boy, I mean, it\u2019Il be too big. Anyway, don\u2019t worry and\nthey shortened it for me. And I came out of hospital and some friends of mine that I was with in\nthe camps said oh, we going to a displaced person camp. Which was a camp where we had where\nto live, where we used to get enough food. They they said, you know, there is -- I think now the\nBritish government is allowing a thousand children to come to England. The Swedish\ngovernment is allowing a thousand children to go to Sweden. And we can also go to Palestine\nbecause Palestine -- we can\u2019t go as such, just say right, we going, because there is a quota,\nbecause they said, according to the British government, because it was under the British\nprotection, British mandate, that it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the other population to send all the people\nthat want to go to Israel in one go. So every month groups will go. I said okay. But I definitely --\nso, we sat down, we thought Sweden, England, it must be about 50,000 miles away. I said, what\nwill we go to England, we know nobody. No, let\u2019s stay and go to Palestine. I said, I\u2019ve got\nnobody in England, I\u2019ve got nobody anywhere else as far as I know. And I said right, we\u2019ll do\nthat. So we stayed in the displaced person camp, then we went to a -- ab -- about 10 miles away\nto a children\u2019s home, and there were a few grown up people there, Jewish people and they kept\non teaching us a little bit, you know. And --",
        "A: Eng -- no, no. English was unimportant, we didn\u2019t need to know English. You know, we\nweren\u2019t going to England, it was in ger -- I was in Germany so we learned Hebrew mainly, you\nknow, because going to Palestine and then they said all the kids that go to Palestine will go to\nHamburg. And in Hamburg we were at -- they sent us there, so I said, let\u2019s go to Hamburg. It\nwas a beautiful place. It was donated by the Varberek family, which was a Jewish family, Jewish\nbankers that when the war broke out in Germany they went to live in Switzerland and some went\nto live in England, you know. So we stayed there, then I got ill, I needed an operation. So again\nthey sent me to the hospital, I had the operation. Of course there was no anesthetic at the time,\nbut --",
        "A: I ruptured myself --",
        "A: -- you know. It la -- it was -- I can\u2019t tell you how it happened, you know, cause I\u2019m too\nembarrassed.",
        "A: Yeah. Anyway, I wanted to look somewhere where I shouldn\u2019t have done, you know, being\n15 years old, you\u2019re very inquisitive. And I -- but anyway, so I went to hospital and had the\noperation. Then two friends came to me and -- with a letter. And the letter was from London,\nEngland. And I s -- who would write to me from England? I don\u2019t know anybody in England. I\nlook, and you know, the usual thing, I look at the back, there was a return address, London. And\nit give a name, it means absolutely nothing to me, and --",
        "A: Oh yes, I remember it very well. Pll come to it in a minute.",
        "A: And -- so my friend went up to [indecipherable] and says, why the hell don\u2019t you open the\nletter and you\u2019ll know who it\u2019s from and who is writing to you. And I open the letter and it says,\nwritten in Polish, you know, my name is so and so and I left Poland in the 30\u2019s -- it\u2019s a woman --\nand I had a son in Poland, same age as you and I -- I found that name on the British Red Cross\nlist in London. She even says where, in Woburn House. The only thing, the year of the -- of the -\n- the birth is different. It says that Zygmund Shipper, born 18\" of January, 1931, and I know that\nmy son was born in 1930. And she says, but if you have a look at your left wrist, as a child of\nabout three or four you burnt yourself and there should still be a mark there. And you know, I\ndidn\u2019t even think of the mark. I knew I had a mark because it was very -- you could see it very\neasily. But of course, today you can just about see it.",
        "A: And you know, and I looked at that and I found my mother, that I knew that she was dead for\nover 10 years. As a child of five I knew my mother was dead. At least that\u2019s what I thought. And\nhere a woman found me and she says she is my mother. The funny thing is I -- I -- tears come\ndown now. When I actually knew about it, it didn\u2019t mean that much to me. And of course, in the\nletter she says, if I\u2019m your mother I -- I want you to come to England to be with me, you know,\nand -- and I said to -- I turned around to my friends and -- you know, and I said, I don\u2019t know the\nwoman. She doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. I mean, you are my family. You are -- you two are\nmy brothers. She is a stranger to me. And of course, you know, they said, how can you say that,\nyou know. And when I came out of hospital an-and went back and the teacher there, we had\nteachers from the Jewish brigade, that were teaching us Hebrew and we had lessons in -- in -- in\nmath and whatever else, German, I\u2019m not sure, history or so on. And everybody said --\neverybody was talking about the incident and they said you found your mother, how can you not\n-- you\u2019re one of the luckiest people alive that you\u2019ve got somebody, a mother, and we\u2019ve got\nnothing. You must go to your mother. Anyway, they persuaded me and it took about -- at that\ntime I couldn\u2019t go, just go, she had to get a visa for me, and it took 10 months to get a visa, you\nknow.",
        "A: Oh yes, it -- or even longer. Than happened in January and I think -- and I came to England in\nDecember -- 22\" or 23\" of December 1946. And I arrived -- I came on a boat, I arrived in Hull.\nA man met me, and he said to me in Yiddish, because I couldn\u2019t speak English, he says -- when I\ncame off the boat he says, if you\u2019ve got your things, get your luggage and we will go on the\ntrain, we'll go to London. I looked at him and I be -- start laughing. He says, why are you\nlaughing? I said, what luggage? You see what I\u2019ve got. I was -- I was -- when I was in Hamburg\nI was very friendly with a girl and the only reason -- reason I was so friendly with her is because\nI had one shirt and I had -- needed somebody to wash my shirt. When she washed my shirt I had\nto stay inside because I had no other shirt to wear. And he talks to me about luggage. Anyway,\nhe turned out to be my stepfather, my mother remarried. And that\u2019s what I said to you I\u2019II tell\nyou the name, it was Killberg. And eventually we came home and you know, we -- I arrived and\nmy mother cried, and made me cry as well, but I still didn\u2019t feel anything towards her at the time,\nyou know? And the first six months I didn\u2019t go to work, I did nothing, but it was the worst -- one\nof the worst times in my life. I thought my wer -- bad times have finished but they were bad, I\nhad nobody. My family was in Germany, waiting to go to Palestine.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: I wrote. Yeah, not as often maybe as I should have done, but I did write, and what did I do?\nWe had school. And you know, we were outside Hamburg and we -- we had a time of our lives,\nyou know. We had money to burn. We -- we -- we used to get Red Cross parcels that were sent\nduring the war for the American prisoners of war. And there were mountains of those. And --\nand you know, we used to -- and in the parcel there was two pa -- a parcel for two people, so we\nused to share it. There was Nescafe, I'll never see Nescafe. There was -- there was prunes, there\nwas sugar, there was chocolate. And of course the most important thing was the Nescafe and a\npack of 200 cigarettes. Not that we smoked, but we could buy things with them. If we wanted to\ngo to a theater, you know, to see an opera -- I mean, I never knew what an opera was -- we --\nthere was no tickets, you couldn\u2019t get. But when you put a packet of cigarettes at the desk where\nthey were selling -- where the -- the ticket thing was, then you straight away got tickets, and\ncoffee as well. We used to go to the farms, you know, German farms, and you know, exchange a\ntin of Nescafe, those small tins at the time, which cames in the parcel, for some eggs or some\nham, or whatever we wanted, I mean --",

I was with them. They\ndidn\u2019t say you\u2019ve got to leave because you\u2019re not going to Palestine, so I stayed with them and --",
        "A: -- til -- til we went, you know. I didn\u2019t want to go, right up til the last minute I didn\u2019t want to\ngo. But anyway I came, like I said, and for the first six months I didn\u2019t do any work, all I did was\ngo to cinemas. I\u2019ve never seen a film before in my life. Now I certainly made up in those six\nmonths. And then one day they -- somebody came to me and said, you know, there is a club that\nyoung Holocaust survivors, boys and girls meet in a certain area in London in Belsize Park, as it\nhappens, and why don\u2019t you go there one day? On a Saturday night they\u2019 ve got a dance, so why\ndon\u2019t you go? I said all right, so I decided I'll go, you know, so I arrived at the door, you know,\nit -- they had a dance in a church hall. I knocked on the door and they opened. And I said some\nwords then that I -- in the book what -- what Sir Martin Gilbert wrote about us, the boys that\ncame here -- that came to England,. and I said -- the first thing I said when th -- I opened the\ndoor, I found my family again. That\u2019s what they meant to me, more than my mother. And from\nthen on, my life completely changed, you know. I joined the club straight away and I spent more\ntime in the club than anywhere else. I got a job, my mother said and my stepfather said every\nperson should have a trade. What would you like to do? I said, I haven\u2019t got a clue what I want to\ndo. My mother said, would you like to go to school and [indecipherable]. I say, I\u2019m too old for\nschool. At 17 I was -- I can\u2019t go back to school, you know, I sort of -- so they said, what about\ntailoring? I said okay. So I went to t-tailoring. I worked in tailoring for about six or seven years\nand I must tell you I hated every minute of it. By then I already found th -- in that club, a refugee\ngirl as well, but they came in 1939, she came with her parents to England. We started dating, you\nknow, and I said to her, do you know what? The day the man will say that I\u2019m a qualified tailor,\nthis will be the day I give up tailoring and I\u2019Il never hold a needle in my hand. And I kept to it.\nHe said, now you can -- he says, you\u2019|l have more money. I said, thank you very much, but now\nI\u2019m leaving the job. And going back to that girl, we started going out together. Eventually we got\nmarried. And I opened a delicatessen business, that didn\u2019t go very well eventually. So she said,\nyou know, my father is in business, but if you go in, you can go much bigger in the business, we\n-- why don\u2019t you go in? And the father said, why don\u2019t you come in with me, and I did. It was a\nstationery and printing business. And eventually, after a few years, I left him and he retired and I\ngot bigger and I did wholesale, I had my own print place. I had retail shops in London. But you\nknow my mother -- going back to my mother, you know, I realized then, you know, when I got\nmarried I realized, you know, there must -- she must have had a good reason why she left. You\nknow, things are not so ha -- black and white. I realize people do get divorced, you know. But I\nregret -- I\u2019ve got a regret, that -- I\u2019ve got very few regrets, but one regret 1s -- which you did ask\nme, and I never asked my mother til she died, and she died, unfortunately, very young, why?\nWhat was the reason? And up to today I don\u2019t know the reason, you know, why she left, for\nwhat, whether there was another person involved, or whether she just couldn\u2019t live with my\nfather, or vice versa. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Now -- the funny thing was that we -- very, very few of us Polish boys -- Polish young --\nyoungsters wanted to go back to Poland. Don\u2019t ask me why. I -- when I think back today I don\u2019t\nknow why. But unfortunately some of them went back and were killed by the Poles. You see, the\nPoles were very scared of the Jewish people coming back and trying to claim their properties. I\nmean, those people lived in those properties for five years, and all of a sudden a Jew will come\nand take their properties away. They were beaten, they were killed in many, many places. There\nwas a pogrom in Kielce, you know, in Poland, where they killed a lot of Jewish people, you\nknow, because they were terrified that they\u2019re going to take away their homes. I can understand\nthat, you know. Why they should kill, I don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t have to kill them not to give\nthem back their homes, but they did. I -- I asked questions, you know, but I didn\u2019t look properly\ntil years later, you know, but like I said, you know, I was in business and I got married in 1954.\nIn 1956 my wife became pregnant. October -- the eighth of October I went to the hospital, she\nwas in labor. And I will never forget that moment, it was the happiest moment in my life, you\nknow. And you know, when I walked in -- because at that time there wasn\u2019t such a thing as a\nhusband watching the birth of a child, you know, and that woman presented me with that bundle,\nand I looked at it and I couldn\u2019t stop crying. And I said, at last, I know I\u2019ve got a family of my\nown, you know. When I look at that child, it was the greatest thing, that whenever I say that and\nmy younger daughter is there -- because a few years later I had another daughter, she says, Dad,\nwhat about me, you know. And she knows how much I love both of them, there is absolutely no\ndifferent. But you know, it did something to me, you know, that I cannot explain, you know. I\nknow that every parents 1s -- it\u2019s the most happiest day of their life when their child is born. But\nthe Holocaust survivor, when he\u2019s lost almost everything -- I mean some of my friends, they\u2019 ve\ngot -- they had families, they had siblings and they\u2019ve got not one member of the family\nsurvived, you know. You know, and I was lucky enough that my mother survived. Unfortunately\n-- | mean, she was lucky enough to see grandchildren, you know, which was a great thing for me\nand for her. And unfortunately I think she died thinking that I\u2019ve never forgiven her for leaving\nme. And when we discussed it, and I used to -- about leaving me, she never said why and I never\nasked, but I said, if you would have stayed, most probably both of us would have been dead\ntoday. So, at least both of us survived. And I certainly did -- did not hold it against her. You\nknow, I did, most probably as a child, but in later years, you know, when I came to England, you\nknow, it never crossed my mind that she\u2019s guilty of something. And she got on better with my\nwife than she got on with me because she had it in the back of her mind that I must hate her, or --\nand I know, I -- I -- I loved her as much as I could, you know. I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t love her as a\nnormal child will love a mother, you know. But I did love her, I respected her, you see? But then,\nas I said, I had children, and eventually they grew up. Good kids. They produced three children\neach. You know, I\u2019ve got six grandchildren and I think how lucky I am, you know. In 1981, I --\nunfortunately I did work very hard, you know? I also played very hard, you know. I -- I smoke\nand I drunk and I goed -- went to casinos and I -- I -- I went to football, I did everything. I wasn\u2019t\na father like I -- I even apologized to my two daughters for not being a father like I should have\nbeen. They don\u2019t think so, but you know. But today they think I\u2019m the greatest thing alive. I\ndon\u2019t know why, you know. They are wonderful, wonderful kids. And when I think I came to\nEngland, without education I couldn\u2019t read and write. Never mind English, I couldn\u2019t hardly read\nand write in Polish. And the -- my oldest grandson has a master\u2019s degree in mathematics and\nstatistics. From a poor little boy to come to this country, to meet her Majesty the Queen and\nshake hands with her. To meet the prime minister of this country and go to his place where he\nlives and where he works, why me? In 1981, as I said, I worked very hard. I had to go to hospital\nand they sent me home, they said there\u2019s nothing wrong. Four hours later I was in hospital again\nwith a heart attack and they -- I think it\u2019s cutting out.",

But tha -- on the 14 of August 1945 was the first lot that\ncame here from Theresienstadt concentration camp. They were there -- they were liberated in\nTheresienstadt, then they went to Prague and from Prague they came to England. Originally they\ncame to the north of England to a beautiful place called Windermere. And I don\u2019t know the\nreason why they brought them there, but people think it\u2019s because they were scared to bring them\ninto a capital like London or Manchester, because they didn\u2019t know who they were bringing in\nhere. They are bringing young people that were five years interned. Now, how are they going to\nbehave? Now, within a few months they dispersed them, they sent them to London and\nManchester, Liverpool and so on. Now, the people that I met, of course, they were the\nLondoners.",

Was a complete charity organization, they\u2019re still in existence now,\nbut they -- they amalgamated with the big charities, they are not any more the Central British\nFund, the Jewish [indecipherable] this -- this -- the whole thing involved, you know. And they\nhad homes, you know, for the survivors and for refugees that came before the war to Britain, you\nsee? And that group that I was with is the group that came. They were -- they were survivors\noriginally from Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia. Very, very few from Germany, but they were\nall a mixture of [indecipherable]. And we -- we came -- and when they came to London they\nlived in hostels and then they decided -- the CBF decided that they should form a club to keep\nthe youngsters together. And they formed a club and it was like any other club. We did a lot of\nsport. One of our members, which today is the chairman of our society, which after the club\nfinished we formed a society, became British lightweight champion in weightlifting. Now him\nthey made British very quickly because he was very good. He represented England in the\nOlympic games, in the commonwealth games and of course in the Maccabee in Israel. And we\nhad -- and some went to college, some went to university. Some became doctors, lawyers. You\nknow, we had one who was working 1n -- in university as a lecturer, you know, and so -- well,\nactually two. One was a mathematician, you know, and we did -- they did quite well. And most\nof them went to trades or business, and -- and -- but the most important thing was that because of\nthe club, we kept together. Now, eventually, you know, we got married and had children, we\ncouldn\u2019t have a club, because it wouldn\u2019t work, because we wouldn\u2019t have time to go to a club.\nAnd we -- you couldn\u2019t carry on playing football, basketball, cricket and so on. We had other --\nwe had to work and we had to look after families. So they decided to form a society, which we\nstill got up til today, which is called the 45 Aid Society, I think I told you that. We raise money\nfor charity, for eng -- in England and in Israel, mainly for children. Because we feel we were\nchildren when it happened to us, we want to help children.",

And we feel we should, you know, and -- and also, I think,\nbecause of that, having had a club and then having this society, which we look after also our own\nmembers, if they need help, we are there. They\u2019ve got somebody to turn to, because they\u2019ve got\nno other families. Of course, they got married and have got their children and grandchildren. But\notherwise they\u2019ve got nobody.

        "A: Yeah, but, you see, a lot of them went to the United States, Canada, Australia, a few\nSwitzerland. And of course, you see we are scattered all over Britain. Like, 1n Manchester we\u2019ve\ngot some members and of -- we\u2019ve got a lot of members that were then in Israel are now -- that\nwer -- are now in Israel were originally in England, and some of them -- in 1948, or \u201947 and \u00b048,\nthey decided to go and fight in the War of Independence when the state of Israel was born. Some\ncame back. Those that w -- came back, had to come back within a year, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t\nhave been let into Britain. And some of them didn\u2019t want to come back, and they stayed in Israel.\nAnd we\u2019ve got quite a big grou -- well, not a big group, but a biggish group in Israel of those\npeople. So much so that this year we had our own reunion every -- we have a reunion every\nSunday -- every year in the first Sunday in May, because most of the people are liberated in that\ntime. So, we have a fa -- a reunion of everybody. People come from the States, people come\nfrom Israel. This year nobody came from Israel, the reason being that a lot of the people in\nEngland went to Israel on the sixth and seventh of May to be -- and they had their own reunion in\nIsrael, the Israeli people put on the reunion, and it was also because it was the 60\" anniversary of\nthe birth of the state of Israel, so they went. So we\u2019re a very close family and I think this helped a\nlot, because when you think that very few of us of that whole group needed psychiatric help, or\nbeing counseled -- I don\u2019t know anybody who was counseled through the years, because we had\nsuch a family, we had. And a lot of survivors that were in England or in Britain, I should say,\nneeded help because they were on their own. And you know, they didn\u2019t have anybody. Like my\nchildren -- I mean, I never had a brother, never had a sister, but my children had a lot of uncles\nand aunts.

I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t easy, you know, but there was nobody else that could\nhelp me at the time, only her. And she was like a mother to me. And what I am today, I owe it to\nher.

Otherwise, I\nconsider myself one of the luckiest people alive. Listen, I survived all that. I -- in 1981,\nunfortunately I had to go to hospital because thought I was -- I -- I thought I was a heart attack,\nbut they finished up saying me, I had -- it\u2019s nothing. Four hours later I was back in hospital\nhaving had a heart attack. And but they said, well, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a mild one, we\u2019ll keep you here for\nthree, four days and then you can go home. I said, thank you very much. They took me up to the\ncoronary care unit. I was there, my wife came in and for some reason when she walked in, must\nhave been two hours after they brought me in, I started speaking in Yiddish, not in English. And\nI said to her in Yiddish, you know, I -- I don\u2019t think this 1s a good business being here. And the\nnext thing I know I had six doctors around me. And one of them said, do you know what\nhappened to you? I said, I was talking to my wife and I must have fallen asleep. When I said the\nword sleep, I realized -- I was conscious enough then to realize that I didn\u2019t fall asleep, that I\nmust have gone, you know, and they resuscitated me. And then later I found out, you know, they\ntold my wife and my two daughters, who were there already, that my chances of surviving were\nnil, you know. That the -- the next 24 hours and they said go home and pray. And my wife said,\nyou know the Germans tried five years to kill him and they didn\u2019t succeed. So -- and all I can tell\nyou, three weeks later I walked out without medication. And that was 27 years ago. I don\u2019t know\nhow I\u2019m going -- how long I\u2019m going to live, but I certainly survived 24 hours. And I ask again,\nwhy? Why did I escape such a lot of incidents, such a lot of -- the gas chambers, a massive\ncoronary? I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t, you know, there\u2019s no answer to that. But I cannot thank enough\nthe British people what they did for me, first of all they liberated me. They let me come into their\ncountry and I could do whatever I wanted, I had no restriction of movement, I had no restriction\nof business, I could open any business I wanted, you know? So I am thankful to them. I\u2019m\nthankful -- if there is a God, I thank God for what happened to me and I had a very good life.",

No, I couldn\u2019t\naccept the answer and I was very, very much against religion, so much so when it came to Yom\nKippur, which is, you know, we got to fast 25 hours, we mu -- all we are allowed to do is to pray,\nI used to eat twice as much as normal that day. I used to go to football, I used to go to dog racing,\nI used to do everything, I -- I hated the religion so much. But you know -- because, you know,\nlike everybody else wif -- you always blame God for good or bad, you know?

I don\u2019t know, and nobody\nelse knows. We -- we think we know. But what I cannot understand, why, if there is a God, why\ndo we blame God for everything? We are the people that doing all those things. God doesn\u2019t tell\nus. It doesn\u2019t say anywhere God tell us to kill people, to let people starve. You see, I -- I mean,\nsix million Jews alone were killed, for no reason. One and a half million children were killed.\nAnd not only Jews were killed. The Gypsy population of -- of Europe was almost wiped out.\nHomosexuals were killed. Disabled people were killed, including German disabled people.

        "A: Well, I think it was both. I -- for the first, I would say 25 years, very few of us Holocaust\nsurvivors spoke about it, whether it was [indecipherable] I think there\u2019s many reasons, you\nknow. When we first survived and came to this country, we were 15 - 16 year olds, you know,\nwould people believe us if we told them, you know? They would say well, you know, kids\nexaggerate, children, oh it\u2019s a lot of nonsense, you know. And then, you know, we were so\nwrapped up in -- in work and in marriage and in bringing up a family, now are we going to tell\nthe children? Is it fair to tell the children what you went through? But the children started\nreading. My two daughters at least, you know, that\u2019s t -- watching films and -- and then asking\nquestions, you know, and they realized what it was. And then, you know, the time came that\nsome of us decided we\u2019ve got to do is talk about it, you know. And my two daughters insisted on\ngoing to Auschwitz, and going to Lodz where I\u2019m -- was born. They wanted to see we -- I\u2019m\nvery close to my daughters and I -- they are very close to me and they wanted -- I said -- I said,\nwhy do you want to go? You -- you know all about it, you\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ve read about it. They\nsaid no. We want to feel what you went through. I said, that\u2019s not a -- what for? Anyway, they --\nthey said if I don\u2019t go, after time and again refusing, you know, they said right, we go alone. So I\nsaid I can\u2019t allow that, so we all went. And it was one of the better things I did in life, by doing\nit, because I felt then that I owe it to people -- I owe it to the people that did not survive when I\nspeak to young students, I say -- when they ask me, why do you come and give talks? Surely it\nhurts you, you -- brings back memories. I said, doesn\u2019t matter what it does, I said, there are --\nthere were families, you know, that not one member of them survived. Now who is going to tell\ntheir story? Because all the stories are very similar, you know? So I decided then that I want to\ndo a lot before it\u2019s too late. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve still got. So for the last sort of 15 years,\n20 years, I\u2019ve been going more and more to speak to students mainly, you know, to tell them\nwhat happened because of hatred, bigotry, anti-Semitism, racism, and the main -- the main thing\nI tell them is hate. And I insist -- my last two words to the students is, do not hate. And never\ngive in, never give up. I don\u2019t hate and I certainly didn\u2019t give up. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s why I\nsurvived, but I feel it -- it\u2019s a little bit of a reason why, maybe. The rest -- 99 percent is -- was\nluck. It wasn\u2019t that I was clever, it wasn\u2019t such a -- that I was such a good person or something.\nNo, it was luck and never have the -- the willpower, maybe, to live.",

It\u2019s a very short\narticle, and he says how he felt standing there, and he wanted to come over to me and say,\nGrandpa, can we go now, you know, in the coach to go back to Krakow because I\u2019m so cold.\nAnd then I thought, I\u2019ve got two pair of trousers, three pair of socks, two coats -- a pullover, a\ncoat and a hat, boots. And he said -- and in it he says, and then, I thought, there were people like\nmy grandfather here wearing lit -- like pajamas, standing in that cold. How can I go to my\ngrandfather and tell him that I am cold? And he didn\u2019t, and I didn't know about it til I came back\nto England and I found the article, my daughter gave me the article wrote, and it was published\nin a magazine as well afterwards, you know, and I felt -- I felt very proud of him. Like I do about\nall my grandchildren, you know, and --",
        "A: Elliot Stern. Yes, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s very, very much. He\u2019s one of them -- they\u2019re all interested 1n it.\nI think he\u2019s -- might be more. He comes, tries to listen to those things, you know, and asks\nquestions, you know. A-Another one of my grandson wrote an article -- wrote a play on the\nHolocaust. He is now finishing university, but he was taking the A levels -- \u2019'm sure you know\nwhat the A level is, that\u2019s the last exams the last two years before you go to university. And for\nthat -- so he wrote an article that -- for his -- on the Holocaust and he performed. There were\nseven boys performing [indecipherable] and it was very good. And he asked me very little about\nit, so he must have gone on the internet or books or -- he knew a lot from me without me telling\nhim. And he did well on it. So yes, he\u2019s good. But I was gl -- you asked me before about me\ngoing back to Auschwitz. He was very good because, you know, I saw things that I\u2019ve never saw\nwhen I was in Auschwitz. There was no way I could see those things, you know, you didn\u2019t walk\naround. And first of all, I was in biren -- Birkenau and Auschwitz is just the -- the -- today the\nexhibition place, you know, where you see everything and we all cried, especially when I saw\nthat room under glass with th -- with the babies, with the children\u2019s toys and toothbrushes and\nlittle spectacles, little shoes. And we hugged and we all cried. Said listen, under different\ncircumstances that could have been my children\u2019s things, you know, and -- and they were\nsomebody\u2019s children\u2019s things and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s tragic, you know, it\u2019s -- it -- it was one of the worst\nthings. But when I stood in the tower of Auschwitz [indecipherable] you know, where the things\nare, and I said to my kids, you see, whatever Hitler wanted to do, he did not achieve the end. We\nwon, he lost. Unfortunately, six million people died, but -- Jews, I mean, I -- like I said before,\nother people died.\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: It was ver -- he was -- he was a very good man, he was a very nice man. He certainly treated\nme like his own son. Whether he knew much about me, I don\u2019t think so, for a simple reason; my\nmother didn\u2019t know much about me. She didn\u2019t know what I was, what person I was. Listen, I\ncertainly, at 16 or almost 17 wasn\u2019t the same person that she left in Poland when she left us. So I\ndon\u2019t know what he knew about me, you know. My mother certainly didn\u2019t know what she\u2019s\ngetting herself into when I came to England. What is he going to be like, you know, as a person.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I was it -- no, well the funny thing is he was married before and he had children and one of\nthe boys lived with my mother during the war, you know. But then he left, I think he went to live\nwith his brother and his mother somewhere in South America, Argentina, I think, or Brazil, I\u2019m\nnot quite sure, but --",
        "A: Joseph Kilberg. Joe Kilberg. And he was very good, he was a -- he treated my grandchil -- my\nchil-children, his grandchildren, like his own grandchildren, you know. He loved them to bits\nand -- unfortunate --",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Yes, very much so, Polish Jew, very much so. But he left Poland, you know, well before the\nwar, you know, he must have left Poland in the 20\u2019s, or something like it. But I don\u2019t know much\nabout the background, you know. I know he didn\u2019t come from L6dz where I come from. I know\nvery little about his sons and his ex -- first wife I also know -- he never discussed it, I never\nasked the question, but I knew there were two boys, you know. And --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. Well, it was -- you see, it was funny, because it\u2019s a very, very similar thing that you got\nhere. We -- in -- a few years ago the -- the museum, the Holocaust Museum was opened in the\nImperial War Museum in London and the quee -- queen was invited to open the museum and\nwhen it was finished she was leaving, she was coming across to meet people and the president of\nthe museum, or -- Englishman, that is the -- was involved in the Holocaust Museum, must have\nsaid something to her, whispered something, that there are some survivors here, and she came\nover and she shook hands with us, you know, with a few of us, and I was one of them that she\nshook hands with me and through my work for the Holocaust Education Trust I was invited to\nher garden party, that was the second time. But years and years ago, quite a long time ago, I was,\nthrough the work I was doing for Save the Children Fund, my wife and I were also invited to the\ngarden party. But that was a long time ago. So -- so --",
        "A: Same queen, much younger, you know, but same queen. No, I -- I -- I felt -- I was honored.\nYou know, to meet the head of state, you know, 1 -- I wouldn\u2019t like to meet Mugabi of -- or\npeople like that, but to meet -- I should call her by the right name, Her Majesty, the Queen, you\nknow, it was a big honor. It was a big honor for me to meet Gordon Brown, whatever I think of\nhim or don\u2019t think of him, you know. I didn\u2019t tell him whether I\u2019m going to vote for him or not,\nyou know. But no, I felt, as a Holocaust survivor, you know, I felt it\u2019s not only I was invited,\nmost -- I was representing the Holocaust survivors, not only me, and I can tell you one thing, I\nthink my two daughters are more proud of the thing. Everybody I -- people ring me up and you\nknow and it\u2019s friends of my daughters\u2019. Oh, you met the queen, oh, you met -- oh, you\u2019re going\nto Washington, oh, that\u2019s --",
        "A: Well, the Holocaust Education Trust 1s -- was formed, oh about 10 years ago by -- it started\nby a rabbi, not Holocaust Education Trust, but he decided -- a local rabbi, Barry Markus, in\nLondon, and he took a group of people to Auschwitz for the day and then somehow they got\ntogether with a group of other people and they decided to form a Holocaust Education Trust,\nwhich is a working people, it\u2019s not a -- they work there full time, and what they do, they also\nteach teachers about the Holocaust. Teachers that have retired, or they want to be in teaching\nprofession any more, and they devote their time for that. They do it -- they get paid for it,\nnaturally, otherwise they couldn\u2019t do it. And they do seminars for young people. But the\nHolocaust Education Trust is mainly interest in taking young people to Auschwitz. Now that,\nafter that rabbi, Rabbi Barry Markus did that, they decided they would be able -- they can afford\nto take two groups of children, around 200 people -- there would be like 160 children. There\u2019 ll\nbe teachers from each school. Because it\u2019s not as a school, it\u2019s about 80 schools. They take two\nstudents from a school, you see, local, 1n London, plus teachers, plus journalists. And they take\nthem just for one day, they go very early in the morning and come back late. And they go to\nAuschwitz, they go to birk -- to Krakow, Auschwitz and Birkenau. The main thing is Auschwitz\nand Birkenau. And they come back and they\u2019ve got the bef -- but, so what I do, or people like\nme, we come and talk to them, because they know very little about the Holocaust. They know\nvery little about the second World War. But now it\u2019s a thing that they\u2019ve got to learn in school,\nit\u2019s -- it\u2019s a must, it\u2019s not whether they want or not. But how much is not -- doesn\u2019t come into it\nbecause how much they can just learn one hour in three months about the Holocaust. So they go\n-- so by doing -- what the Holocaust Education Trust does is they bring them -- they get them\ntogether, and they listen to a Holocaust survivor. Then they get another seminar, then they go to\nAuschwitz and when they come back they go to write about it, what they thought of it, what they\n-- the whole thing and they\u2019ve got to send it in to the Holocaust Education Trust, and a panel sits\nthen pick four schools of two children each and they got to come back to the Houses of\nParliament or to the House of Lords, here in -- and start presenting their stories, what they think,\nthey\u2019re int -- they\u2019re interviewed, they ask questions, you know, and usually some of the\nsurvivors are also there, a few of us. And then one of them is voted as ambassadors of the year.\nSo what they have to do, they\u2019ve got to go to other local schools and tell them all what they saw,\nwhat they heard. And being young people I am very much involved in it because I lungya -- I\nlike young people, and I think it\u2019s very, very imporstant they should know what happened,\nbecause -- and they are lovely students, most of them. I\u2019ve never had any problems, you know?\nIt\u2019s as quiet as anything, you know, and I talk to them for about an hour or so and they ask\nquestions and -- you know, and --",
        "A: Well, all different. Some are a bit silly ones, you know, like naturally young people, they\nwant to know whether I met Hitler, you know. I haven\u2019t been invited to tea by Hitler, but -- but\nthat th -- one of the main question, it\u2019s always asked 1s, do I hate the German people. And they\ncannot understand when I tell them no, I do not hate the German people. Why should I hate\npeople for -- most probably the people that they think I should hate are not alive today. You\nknow, they\u2019re grandparents. And most German people are the same as any other people. Why\nshould I blame something -- body for what their grandfather did, you know? Do I ask me -- do I\nforgive them? Now the people that did it, I haven\u2019t got the right to forgive. If there is a God, God\ncan forgive them. The others are the people that died can forgive. I certainly haven\u2019t got the right\nto forgive, but I certainly do not hate, and I beg of you, when I talk to them, do not hate. Because\nthis is not an answer, to hate. You are the one that will suffer if you hate. So no, I -- I love the\nquestions. Some, like I said, are silly, but some are very [indecipherable] how they -- the usual\nthing, how did you survive? I wish I could tell them. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s one of those things.\nPeople that are -- there are some students that are religio -- religious and they, do you think God\nwanted you to stand -- to stay -- to save you so that you can tell the story? I said maybe, I don\u2019t\nknow. But I feel it\u2019s very important it should be told. We\u2019ve got to have awareness of what\nhappened.",
        "A: Because you know, in another few years there won\u2019t be -- the only thing you\u2019ll be able to do\nis to read about us, what happened to the people in Europe between 1933 and 1945. There won\u2019t\nbe anybody, you know, to substantiate the story. So people say well, is it true, is it not, and you\ncan be the one to say, well, I met a Holocaust survivor. I have been to Auschwitz, I have seen\nwith my own eyes. And I feel that\u2019s important.",
        "A: Well, it was -- it was really -- I don\u2019t know whether pleasure\u2019s the right word, but it was\ncertainly my duty. The more people I tell it to, the more I am satisfied and I am happy about it\nwith -- especially with the feedback I get, which makes me very happy that people do listen.",
