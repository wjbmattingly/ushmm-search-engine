        "Q: Today is March 29, 1992, I am Anthony DiOrio and I am at the home of Mr. Gerald Grossman,\nBayside, New York. I am here on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to\ninterview Mr. Grossman about his experiences during the Holocaust. Good morning, Mr.\nGrossman.",
        "A: Good morning.",
        "Q: Perhaps we could begin by your telling us when you were born and where you were born.",
        "A: I was born in Rovno, Poland at the time, it\u2019s part of the Ukraine, December 20, 1923.",
        "Q: When it was part of Poland?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Could you tell us about your parents.",
        "A: My parents were of Jewish religion and my father was born in 1900, worked as a tailor all his\nlife, my mother was a housewife and was born in 1902 in Rovno.",
        "Q: And how many brothers and sisters did you have?",
        "A: I had three brothers, excuse me, and a sister. We were five children all told",
        "Q: Were you the oldest?",
        "A: I was the oldest of the five.",
        "Q: What was it like growing up in Rovno?",
        "A: Well, I thought it was O.K.. As a child I went to school and my father worked always very\nhard. Sometimes day and night to support the whole family because he was the only one\nworking in the family to provide. My life was, I would say, normal, according to the\ncircumstances in that particular town during the Polish occupation.",
        "Q: For example, your father as a tailor, did he have his own shop?",
        "A: Well, at certain times he did have a shop for himself but most of the time he worked in a small\ntown which 1s eight kilometers from the city of Rovno, it\u2019s called Abarrov (?) and he worked\nthere as a custom tailor for the people of commerce that lived in that town and he was always\nhired by them by the week to work and he used to move into their homes while he was sewing\nfor the whole family.",
        "Q: And was he originally from that town?",
        "A: No, he was from Rovno but he used to go away for the whole week and come back to the house\non Friday nights for the weekend, like for Shabbat.",
        "Q: How did he come and go?",
        "A: Most of the time he would walk the eight kilometers to come home or he used to take a train.\nThat was only about twenty minute\u2019s ride by train.",
        "Q: You mentioned going to school. What kind of school did you go to?",
        "A: I went to all kinds of schools. As a child, and I can give you exactly the, before I went to public\nschool, I must have been six, five or six, I used to go to Cheder. Like to a rabbi to learn\nYiddish. I used to go to a small Talmud Torah also before, and then I went to public school,\nwhich was compulsory at the time, when I was seven years old, in Polish public schools. And\nafter I finished, I went to a special school, specialized school sponsored by ORT, American\nORT, for three years to learn how to become an inspector for tailors which was only about\ntwenty boys. Specialized for the Polish government to spread them all over Poland to become\ninspectors.",
        "Q: Is this what you wanted to be?",
        "A: Yes. Each tailor that opened up a shop had to have a diploma, a master\u2019s diploma, before he\ncould open up and he had to get it from this kind of inspectors to see if they are good tailors or\nnot.",
        "Q: So, conceivably you may have become your father\u2019s inspector?",
        "A: My father would have been probably too old by then.",
        "Q: So you went to Cheder until you were 12 or 13?",
        "A: No, I went to Cheder in the evenings after school and the rest of the time I spent in public\nschool.",
        "Q: Until what age did you finish public school?",
        "A: 1936 and then I switched over to that specialized school, ORT, which happened to be that we\nwere supposed to graduate just 100 days before the war started. No, the 100 days before\ngraduation the war started and that interrupted the whole thing.",
        "Q: And this was in 1939?",
        "A: 1939, yes.",
        "Q: So that was a public government school as well?",
        "A: It was, no, it was a private school sponsored by ORT.",
        "Q: The government didn\u2019t subsidize it?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Your brothers and sister, did they follow you in going to public school?",
        "A: Well, my, yes. My second brother and third brother were going to public schools and the little\nones were not of school age yet.",
        "Q: What languages were spoken at home?",
        "A: In my house we spoke Yiddish. Outside we spoke Ukrainian and Polish.",
        "Q: How were relations between Jews and non-Jews in Rovno?",
        "A: Well, the city of Rovno itself there was, I would say, eighty-five to ninety percent Jewish and so\nwe used the Polish language and Yiddish and we had very little to do with other nationalities\nexcept school where we used to get together. There was anti-Semitism but we were used to it\nand that was part of life, sorta. So we accepted it as it is.",
        "Q: Do you recall any specific instances of anti-Semitism?",
        "A: Well, yes, there was plenty. I, myself, before the war, my looks are not, typical sort of Jewish. I\nhave blue eyes and not a typical. I used to be able to walk on the other side where the church\nwas standing, the Polish church. It was called Koschua (?) in Rovno where I observed and read\nthe literature put out in front of the church against the Jews and anything that was possible to\nprint and make hatred. So I used to relay this information to others because it was a little\ndangerous to walk on the other side of the street. And that\u2019s the only kind of a thing. I came\nacross, myself, before the war, certain episodes like, when I used to walk to visit my father in\nAbarrov. I had to pass a little section where only Polish people live and as I was walking some\nyoungsters would attack Jewish guys. The episode was that as I was walking on the street, one\nwas screaming in Polish, \u201cDer is Yid, der is Yid . That means, \u201cis a Jew, catch him.\u201d\nWhen the other friend of his came and said are you a Jew, I said where, where is the Jew? And\nsomehow because of that asking the question where is the Jew, he was puzzled. He didn\u2019t know\nI was Jewish and he let me go. This is the kind of things as youngsters we knew. There was\nanti-Semitism.",
        "Q: Were any of your brothers accosted in similar ways?",
        "A: No, my brothers they were younger and they didn\u2019t do out of the house that much. They didn\u2019t\ntravel outside the city of Rovno so they didn\u2019t have any experiences like that, except going to\nschool.",
        "Q: How about your teachers at public school and private school?",
        "A: Well, I personally didn\u2019t have any problems with teachers. The only thing I did have a problem\nwas because I was Jewish, they transferred me from the school that was next to my house to\ntwo kilometers further, which was Degrabnik all the way in the back of the town. I had to walk\nevery day to go to school, two kilometers each way, yet there was a school next door to me.",
        "Q: Did you live in the center of Rovno?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was it a Jewish neighborhood?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How about relations between your father and his customers? Earlier you mentioned that he\nprovided customized tailoring for farmers and so forth.",
        "A: Yes. He had good relations with them. There was no problem at that time, among the\nUkrainian people, and my father that worked for them. He used to stay in their houses, they\ntreated him like their own.",
        "Q: When he walked, he wasn\u2019t approached the way that you were approached?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You mentioned that school wasn\u2019t the big problem, but I am just wondering whether after the\n1935, after 1936 with the death of Pilsudski, whether you saw any changes either in the school,\nor in the town?",
        "A: Yes. Right after the death of Pilsudski, which the Jewish people liked, there was another\nMarshall, I think his name was Rydz-Smigly and his government looks like change. Because as\na youngster I realized that we had a lot of trouble. The first thing, I think that the government\nwas infiltrated with German people and they made new laws, especially for the Jews. Where\nthey made them eat non-kosher foods, they didn\u2019t allow them to kill like the Jewish way of\nkosher, and I think the woman was called Madame Priestaroba that was in charge of all this\nbusiness. Just to give the Jews a little problem.",
        "Q: Did this affect you in anyway in school, for example?",
        "A: Personally, in school it didn\u2019t affect us but I remember there was a lot of problems among the\nJews for that problem about Kashrut. They didn\u2019t eat meat because they wouldn\u2019t eat non-\nkosher meat.",
        "Q: Did these changes affect your father in any way?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell at the time, I was too young to understand. All I knew there was no kosher food\nfor a long time and there was a strike against the government and the Jews didn\u2019t eat any meat.",
        "Q: Were you a good student?",
        "A: Fairly good student. Yes.",
        "Q: Did you pay any attention to politics?",
        "A: Somewhat. I did not get into it although I had a friend whose father was a communist and was\nin jail for five years for communism and he was a good friend of mine and we used to talk about\nother ways of life. I was only studying this but I didn\u2019t belong to this kind of group at that time.",
        "Q: What was the political orientation of your parents?",
        "A: Well, mainly Zionist orientated. Talking about Israel all the time. Judaism. We had\norganizations, Zionist organizations all kinds. There was there was Agudas\nYisroel, there was a lot of different Zionist organizations and I belonged to some of them.",
        "Q: Which ones did you belong to?",
        "A: I belonged to once Agudas Yisroel, which is the religious Zionist organization, I also belonged\nto a Socialist sort of organization, I also belonged to a Socialist sort of organization\nlike . So I used to walk from one place to the other.",
        "Q: Did anybody in your family, extended family go to Palestine?",
        "A: One of my cousins, which is my father\u2019s sister\u2019s son, left for Israel in 1935 and he just recently\ndied in Israel. He was one of the first Halutzim they called them, that volunteered to go to build\nIsrael. It was in 1935 and I met him for the first time after the war in 1968.",
        "Q: Do you recall any discussions during these years about Hitler and the Nazis in Germany?",
        "A: Yes. When Hitler took over, I think it was in 1933, after that on the radio people used to get\ntogether and listen to the speeches and all the propaganda they used to put out against Jews and\nother things. I remember as a child, as a youngster, that people were very upset.",
        "Q: Did you recall your father speaking about Hitler and Nazism?",
        "A: My most of the time was out of the house, which I told you before, and we didn\u2019t have a chance\nto talk politics with my father.",
        "Q: How about your mother?",
        "A: My mother did not get involved with politics. She was a plain ordinary housewife taking care\nof her children and times were not good, economic times were pretty bad before the war and she\ndid not get involved in politics.",
        "Q: Did you live in an apartment?",
        "A: We lived in an apartment, yes, we didn\u2019t have our own house. The house that my mother had\nwhen she got married, my grandmother came back from the United States and sold the house\nand made them move out because one of her brothers had to go to Argentina and they needed\nthe money and that was it for the house.",
        "Q: So you had family members who had been to America?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was there any thought of leaving Poland, or Rovno, at any point for economic reasons or for\nother reasons?",
        "A: No. There was no thought. We didn\u2019t have the means to move out and the family was too big\nand, I guess, that was the aim to stay in Rovno.",
        "Q: Did you know, in describing the differences between Jews and non-Jews, any differences\nbetween the Poles and the Ukrainians 1n the way in which they were treated you or treated each\nother?",
        "A: No. We didn\u2019t have, I personally as I said before, we used to walk to that village Abarrov where\nmy father used to work and we had very good relations with the Ukrainian people. We never\nheard any anti-Semitic things against the Jews, and I used to have friends that used to play with\nUkrainians.",
        "Q: Did you have Ukrainian friends?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you also have Polish friends?",
        "A: Yes, we had Polish friends in school.",
        "Q: When the war begins did 1t come as a complete surprise?",
        "A: No. It didn\u2019t come as a complete surprise because, as I said, the propaganda and the talk on the\nradio and all the preparation that the Polish government made before the war like digging, in\nPolish they call it ditches against bombs, places to hide. It was prepared before\nSeptember 1939.",
        "Q: How much before?",
        "A: I would say about a year. Everyplace in Rovno we dug ditches to hide against bomb, shelters.",
        "Q: From Germany?",
        "A: From Germany.",
        "Q: So the German attack was expected?",
        "A: It was expected, yes.",
        "Q: And how about the Soviet Union? What was expected of the Soviet Union?",
        "A: Well the Soviet Union was not expected. That was a surprise. That was called a blitzkrieg, sort\nof, against the Russians. That\u2019s what happened in 1941, June the 22, 1941.",
        "Q: The German attack on the Soviet Union. I mean the Soviet Union marching in Poland?",
        "A: Oh, excuse me. The Soviet Union, that was a surprise, yes. The Soviet Union the way we\nknow made an agreement with Germany to split Poland in half. I guess the river Bulg was the\nborderline where they had the border, Poland was divided at the Bulg. My part of the territory\nfell into the Russian side.",
        "Q: Did you see any Russian soldiers in 1939?",
        "A: Just Russians.",
        "Q: Just Russians. At the time that the Russians came in, I was in that town of Abarro because we\nthought we had a lot of friends in that town. In order to hide from the war. My father took the\nwhole family to that town of Abarro. And some of the families took us in...",
        "Q: Ukrainian families?",
        "A: Ukrainian families took us in and when the Russians were approaching the Ukrainians were not\nso happy about that. They would have rather had the Germans come in than the Russians.\nSomehow I assume that the relations between the communist Russians and the Ukrainians were\nnot so good and they were afraid for the Russians. And as the Russians came in they asked us\nto leave their house and go back to our house which we did.",
        "Q: The Ukrainians asked you to leave?",
        "A: \u201cYes, the Ukrainians. They didn\u2019t want to keep us. So the whole family was walking from that\ntown, eight kilometers, already with some Polish soldiers that gave themselves up to the\nRussian military, and we also walked back and as we came to the city of Rovno, there was a\nguard checking everyone who came back into the town.",
        "Q: Did they give you any trouble?",
        "A: No. They just looked at us, checked us out and see, they wanted to see if we are not bourgeois\ncapitalist, and they let us in.",
        "Q: So they decided you were not bourgeois?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, thy decided that we didn\u2019t look like bourgeois.",
        "Q: So your father was afraid that his family would be in danger. Was he afraid that there would be\nbombings?",
        "A: Yes, they were afraid that there may be bombings or maybe attacks on Jews, so he was safer in\nthat little town with his friends that he knew all the time than he was in the city of Rovno.\nThat\u2019s why he took the whole family out.",
        "Q: Was there any destruction or attacks on Jews in Rovno?",
        "A: Not at the time when the Russians occupied. The Russians just walked in the city of Rovno.\nThey were attacked by the Polish army and by the Polish police in the city of Rovno.",
        "Q: Who was attacked?",
        "A: The Russians.",
        "Q: So there was Polish resistance?",
        "A: There was Polish resistance in both parts of the main streets of it was called at\nthe time in Rovno, I remember there was a military church where they were hiding, the Polish\npolice was hiding and as the Russian soldiers with their equipment were coming in they were\nshooting at them from behind the buildings and some of them got killed and then they killed all\nthe police that were shooting at them. Because the next day, as I walked out, when the Russians\nwere there already, I walked out and I saw a lot of them killed, police lying on the ground.",
        "Q: How did you feel when you saw this?",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t feel so good to see that people, it was not an interesting sight.",
        "Q: Seeing the Russians come in and take over from the Poles, 1s this something to their credit?\u2019",
        "A: Well, for us as, I would consider ourselves poor family, the Russian people that came into\nRovno was better for us. We accepted them, the whole city was not so bad off when the\nRussians were there because of the city wasn\u2019t that rich and for my personal family, 1t was\ngood. The economic times got better for us as a poor family.",
        "Q: So the Russian occupation was not necessarily a bad thing?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t bad in comparison to the Polish government.",
        "Q: Were there any changes in particular under Russian rule?",
        "A: Yes, all the rules changed. There was a change in the system. It was a communist system and\neverything, they had propaganda and telling all the people that it\u2019s a very good system and\nthey\u2019 ll like it and it\u2019s going to be better for everybody.",
        "Q: How about walking back and forth, the eight kilometers, that your father walked so often. Was\nthat safer or less dangerous?",
        "A: It was not dangerous because most of the Polish army that was walking on that same road with\nus, were giving themselves up to the Russian people.",
        "Q: How about the Ukrainian farmers that your father knew so well, did they lose their farms or\nsuffer in any way?",
        "A: In the beginning they still kept their farms but, I understand that later on they had to give up\ntheir farms to the Russian government and work with them as co-hosts whatever they\nestablished at that point. But personally when the Russians came in I was going to school and\nthen I transferred to a Russian controlled school where they taught us Russian language and\ncontinued education.",
        "Q: So you had been going to that private school to become an inspector, you went to a different\nschool under the Russians?",
        "A: Yes, that was not necessary anymore because the Russian government didn\u2019t have the same\nsystem as the Polish government so I gave up the whole education that I had for that purpose. I\nwent to a Russian public school for a short time, and after awhile I read an announcement that\nthey are looking for students for a specialized school and I signed up. This specialized school\nhad to do with railroad working, on the railroad, which was located in Zdolbuniv, twelve\nkilometers from the city of Rovno. The school was very nicely organized, we had dormitories\nwhere we stayed all the time and we were learning Russian and also specialty in locomotive\nwork, locomotive engineering, building cars, railroad cars, and after that to work on the\nrailroad.",
        "Q: So you were preparing to be a machinist?",
        "A: Yes, I graduated to become a locomotive engineer, driving a locomotive which I liked very\nmuch, and after I graduated they sent me to a place to work, which was called Kamionka\nStrumifowa located about twenty five kilometers from Lubov, the city of Lubov. It was also\nlocated on the German border, very close t the German new border, which was in Poland.",
        "Q: When did you graduate?",
        "A: I graduated in 1941.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s when you went to the city?",
        "A: That\u2019s when I went to work. A few months maybe three or four months before the war started.",
        "Q: Meanwhile your family. Now you separated several hundred miles.",
        "A: Now, I separated for about 200 to, I would say about 300 kilometers from the city of Rovno,\nand I was already on my own just in touch by writing letters and that\u2019s all. I was already grown\nup at that time.",
        "Q: How was your family doing during these years?",
        "A: My family, my father was still working as a tailor and there was not much different than it was\nbefore.",
        "Q: Your brothers and sister were growing up?",
        "A: My brothers and sister were growing up and I was not in touch with them.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember anything special happening to them?",
        "A: During the time that I was gone, nothing especially happened to my family, they were growing\nup and I was there until the war started..",
        "Q: Were you thinking of getting married?\nS: No.",
        "Q: Just trying to get your first real job?.",
        "A: Just getting myself established. I always wanted to grow up, my aim was to grow up and to\nhelp my family. Because I was the oldest one and I saw how much they were suffering\neconomically, I felt that with the education that I got I would be able to help them, and that was\non my mind at all times.",
        "Q: Who was paying when you went to the private school and then to the Russian school, who was\npaying for your education?",
        "A: I was always sponsored. My parents did not have the means to pay for my education, so I was\nsponsored by the ORT organization. Then when the Russians came in there was no charge.",
        "Q: So you were here in Lobov when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union?",
        "A: Yes, I was in and that\u2019s when the real business started, right there.",
        "Q: What did you see?",
        "A: On June, would you like to tell me the whole episode?",
        "A:\u201d \u2014 Sure. One June the 22\u2122, early in the morning about 4 o\u2019clock in the morning, being that I was\non the border and working on the railroad at that particular town , 1n the morning I\nsaw airplanes overhead fighting with Russian airplanes. That was the start of the war. Already\nI saw one airplane shot down by the German airplanes and that pilot landed not far from us. He\nparachuted out. I saw the Germans were flying around him while he was being parachuted and\nthey were shooting at him flying down. They made a few holes in the parachute, but they didn\u2019t\nget him and he safely landed. That\u2019s how we knew that something was going on between the\nGermans and the Russians. At 12 0\u2019clock that day, the, Molotov at the time, announced that\nthere was war and attack on Russia and there was war between Russia and Germany. The first\nfew hours while I was there, the railroad lines between and Lutzk was cut. So, we\nalready were paralyzed on the railroad because the Germans bombarded the railroad and no\ntrains were coming into our station. My chief of the station knew about that, that we were\nparalyzed. He was upset, he had his whole family, he was a Russian. He was the chief of that\nstation, and I worked under his command. And, he said to me that you stay over here I will take\nmy family with the children and take them out to the city of Lubov. I saw that there was no\nreason for me to stay at the station because there was no communication and there was no\nconnection between the stations already, because we were cut off, and I was upset about staying\nall by myself in that station. I knew the Germans were close by, so I said why do I have to stay\nhere, there is nothing to do anyway now, why won\u2019t I go with you and help you to evacuate\nyour family to Lubov and then we will together come back to the station to work. Well, he\nagreed and it was my luck, we camouflaged, it was the only locomotive left on the station. We\ncamouflaged one of the cars traveling to Lubov. We never made it back, because the Germans\noccupied that part and from there on we did not stop in Lubov, but we got connected to another\ntransport and we traveled towards the Russian territory in the east, by train, and we had, I\nremember, a open platform train, where old cars were open like platforms and we took that train\nand we traveled to Rovno which took us a couple of days. I would say about three days to\ntravel from Lubov to Rovno because of the bombardments from the air by the Germans. Every\ntime we heard airplanes we had to stop the trains, run off to the sides, hide because they were\nshooting, they were flying very low and shooting at us with the automatic machine guns from\nthe airplanes. When they were gone, we continued until I came to where I was still\nassigned to the railroad and this , which I mentioned before was twelve kilometers\nfrom Rovno. I think it was June the 25\". Being that was only twelve kilometers\nfrom Rovno and my family lived in Rovno, and I didn\u2019t see them for a long time, I decided to\ngo to Rovno to see my family. I was assigned to a post to be back at 10 o\u2019clock at night, to\nwatch a certain part of the main terminal of and I was free until 10 o\u2019clock that\nevening. So I went to Rovno and met my family.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t know you were coming?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know I was coming, they were very happy to see me, they thought I was already\ndead, maybe, or whatever, and I decided at that time, there were bombardments while I was in\nRovno. During the day the German airplanes used to fly in and bombard sections of the city. In\norder for my family to be safer, I told them to move to a section which was called Kapkaz that\nwas the other part of the city, like one section 1s towards east of the city like facing the Russians\nand we had an uncle who was the keeper of the synagogue.\nTape 1, Side 1",
        "A: To bring them over to that part of the town was already late and I had to go back\nto where I was assigned to be there at 10 o\u2019clock. Because about 7:30 or 8\u2019clock,\nI left my family, I said goodbye to my father, my whole family and (a portion of tape is blank).",
        "A: I am going to repeat a few sentences. When I brought my family over to Kafkaz it was late in\nthe day and I had to go back to Slobonov where I was assigned. We didn\u2019t know at the time that\nthe Germans are going to take over most of the territory. We figured it\u2019s just a temporary thing\nand the Russians are going to be able to fight back the Germans and life 1s going to go on\nnormal. I was responsible for my job where I was in Slobonov so I had to leave my family. My\nmother did not want me to go back. She insisted I should stay with the family, in that\nsynagogue. I spoke to my father, he was more like sort of reasonable, and he said to me, I\nremember and I\u2019ll never forget it, he said, my son, you are a grown man, you have to make your\nown decisions what to do. If you think that it 1s important for you to go back, then you have to\ngo back. So I had no problems with my father, but my mother was insisting I should stay with\nthem. I made up my mind to go back because I felt that if I don\u2019t, I will be responsible for the\njob I\u2019m supposed to do on the railroad in Slobonov because it is a major depot place where\nsoldiers and with the Russian soldiers and they had to be transported from one place to the other\nand it was important for me to be there. So, I said to my parents that I\u2019m going to be there\ntonight. After I finish my job in the morning I\u2019ll see you back. [ll come back to the city and\nsee you again. On the way to Slobonov walking, I walked out about six kilometers, about half\nway, from the city of Rovno to Slobonov there was an attack. It was sort of getting dark that\nday, already late in the day, and I was walking with the road of the railroad, that\u2019s how I came to\nSlobonov and a lot of planes were coming towards us and there were another few people and\neveryone was hiding and I was also hiding from the airplanes. We didn\u2019t know they were going\nto attack us, they were flying very low and I saw them go towards Rovno, towards the city of\nRovno. A few minutes later I looked out, all the airplanes they spread like sort of in one line\nand they attacked the city of Rovno from one end to the other. And a few minutes later I saw\nthe whole city burning. I was six kilometers out of the city. It was very hard for me to make a\ndecision what to do now. I didn\u2019t know whether my family was killed at the time or not,\nbecause the city was on fire from one end to the other. I made a decision to go to work because\nI figured like that. If I don\u2019t go to work and nothing happened to my family I would be a\ndeserter, because I was sort of mobilized already by the Russian army to be on the railroad, and\nthen they will kill me as a deserter, the Russian government. If my family is dead, I won\u2019t see\nthem anyhow. So I decided that in the morning when I finish my work, I will run back to the\ncity. Being that I came back to Slobonov I was on my place of work, watching the cars on the\noutside. I was assigned to that, we had a few attacks in the middle, like already dark later on,\nwe had attacks by the German airplanes on the railroad, on the station.",
        "Q: On your station?",
        "A: On the station that I was working. A whole group of people started to run out of the station\nbecause they aimed at the depot, at the station where I was working. And I ran out to the\noutskirts of Slobonov. We went into a house a few kilometers from the depot, from the\nSlobonov station and I walked into the house and I said I have to stay here, I have to rest until\nthis thing is over and I\u2019ll have to rest here in your house and the woman did not disagree, she let\nus in, there were a few men already sleeping on the floor, and she said I have no room, the only\nplace I have is on the floor. If you want to accept it, it\u2019s O.K. I asked her, I said please, if I fall\nasleep, wake me up, but early, early in the morning. Being that I was tired and I didn\u2019t sleep for\na few days, traveling from Lubov to Rovno, I was very tired so I fell asleep on the floor. I was\nso tired that the woman just couldn\u2019t get me up early in the morning and she let me sleep. She\ndidn\u2019t know the reason why I had to be up early. About 8 o\u2019clock, sort of, in the morning I got\nup. I said, why didn\u2019t you wake me up, I was supposed to be on the station working. Well, I\nwalked out of the house and I ran towards the station where I was supposed to be working. As I\ncame close to the rails, I saw German tank facing a column of Russian soldiers with their gun\nfrom the tank pointing at them and all the Russians with their hands up were standing in front of\ntheir building from that column. And I couldn\u2019t figure it out that the Germans were there\nalready because I didn\u2019t see Germans until that point, that was the first tank I ever saw German\nexcept in the air, the bombardment. So I walked around behind the tank.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have a uniform on?",
        "A: I had a uniform, I had a railroad uniform on but not a Russian soldier uniform and behind the\ntank I just passed, they didn\u2019t mind me they only wanted the soldiers and they didn\u2019t do\nanything to me. So I walked right up. It was an uphill, I walked up to the railroad and I went\ninto the station and I took a look. During the night most of the trains and locomotives were\nevacuated going east while I was asleep and I didn\u2019t see anybody on the station. Everybody\nwas evacuated. It was empty. It was a very foolish, stupid episode that if you\u2019re interested I'll\ntell you that I carried a little suitcase, I had some underwear, clothes that I had and I put it in a\nwarehouse when I came down with the train from Slobonov originally, and it was in that\nwarehouse. I figured if I have to run I got to have my suitcase so I ran to that warehouse and\nthere was still an old woman closing up to run away too. I said to her, I have my suitcase with\nmy clothes in it, I would like to get it. There were hundreds of suitcases lying there, I was\nlooking for my personal suitcase which didn\u2019t have much to look at and I found my suitcase and\nwith the suitcase I ran towards the smoke that I saw going east from the chimney. The smoke\nwas coming out of the locomotives, they were going one after the other probably about two\nkilometers away from the station already.",
        "Q: To the east?",
        "A: To the east. I decided to go as fast as I can towards those locomotives and they were going very\nslow because they couldn\u2019t, looks like ahead of them they had some problems, so they were\ntraveling very slow and I could catch up with them, and the last locomotive was a friend of\nmine that also was operating that locomotive. When he saw me run he slowed down and he\npicked me up. And on that locomotive I was until we got into Russia. Never had a chance to\ngo back to Rovno to see if my family was alive or dead. And this was the last time I ever saw\nmy family.",
        "Q: June 25\u201d",
        "A: About June 26\".",
        "Q: Your mother was afraid for you or afraid for herself and family?",
        "A: I think my mother was, she wanted to keep the family together. Being I was the only one out\nworking, so she wanted me to be with them.",
        "Q: Did you ever find out what happened to them?",
        "A: Well, after I was working, I was on the railroad traveling around for six months, I was assigned\nin Russia to be on a group of railroad people, a special transport that would be kept in case they\nneed us for work with the military. So as the Russians, which most of the time they were\nretreating, the Russian army, we were like sort of behind the lines traveling back and forth in\ncase the government would need a transport for some reason. So I was on the railroad for six\nmonths, just living in cars with a whole group, hundreds of people, of railroad people, that\nworked on the railroad for the purpose of restoring the railroad if it was bombarded, for\ntransporting military back and fort. So my job at the time was just to travel. That\u2019s why I lived\nand as the Russians were retreating so did we with the transport we were retreating. Where we\ngot up to a town further away from Harkov. I don\u2019t remember that town that we stayed. As I\nwas working on the station over there we actually parked at that place and we worked at the\nstation and I used to go out to see all the transports that were coming by this station going east\ntowards Russia and they called them , people that run away from the occupied areas\nof Germany, people that were running away from the front. Whoever could evacuate\nthemselves, they were passing by our station and I was checking every car to look for relatives,\nfriends from the city of Rovno. Whether they were passing by too. And I looked into every car\nas they were coming by. I met one guy and he was a son of one of our landlords and he knew\nmy family very well. He met me and he told me that my family, my father, met him on the\nstation in Harkov, that\u2019s a city in Russia.",
        "Q: Far away?",
        "A: It was in the Ukraine. It wasn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know exactly the mileage how far it was from Rovno,\nbut it was still the Ukraine. He said to me that my father approached me and asked him whether\nhe saw me. And at that time, nobody saw me, and he said to my father, no. Well, he repeated\nthose words to me when he met me. He said my father asked if I saw you, but I did not see you\nuntil now. He knew that, he said to me that the whole family and my father were in a school in\nHarkov, and they were waiting for evacuation further, or something. He continued and I\ndecided to go to Harkov, which was already evacuated.",
        "Q: When was this now?",
        "A: This was in 1941.",
        "Q: Months later?",
        "A: No, not that much later. I would say maybe a month. Sometimes, I would say, in July. I don\u2019t\nremember the date. Bit I decided to run and take the first transport that goes there and being I\nworked on the railroad, I could travel and I traveled towards Harkov. I walked on the streets,\nwhich were deserted. There were no people in Harkov anymore. I tried to find somebody to\ndirect me to a certain school, I came to that school and nobody was there. I came back to the\nsame city I worked and did not meet anybody in Harkov. The whole city was deserted and\nevacuated. That was the only information that I ever had about my family. Whether they\nremained in the city, whether they were evacuated someplace, whether they walked out, I will\nnever know.",
        "Q: This person that you described, he\u2019s the last person you know.",
        "A: He was the only one that I ever met.",
        "Q: That was July?",
        "A: It was sometime in July in Harkov. And that\u2019s it. Since then...",
        "Q: And after the war you never found out.",
        "A: After the war, \u2019'm going to jump a little bit. After the war I managed to get out of Russia, I\ntraveled, they told us that we will go to Poland. Rovno the city of Rovno remained under the\nRussian government after the war, because this was part of the Ukraine and never changed\nhands back to Poland. On the way back I managed to get out of Russia and we were supposed\nto travel towards Kovid, it\u2019s a city, Kovid, and my transport got diverted instead of going to\nKovid, went towards Rovno. Overnight was traveling and in the morning I get up and I walk\nout on the station and when I opened up the doors, we stopped at that station, and as I opened\nup the door I see a church, the one I mentioned before, a Polish church, which I recognized, I\nfigured that every city in Poland, I knew I was in Poland but I didn\u2019t know which town, I\nfigured in my mind that every city in Poland has a church like that. So I say this must be\nPoland already, because I see the church 1s just like the one we had in Rovno. The rest of the\ntown was completely bombarded, it was leveled. So as I walk out of the station, I didn\u2019t\nrecognize the station, it was also bombarded, demolished, and I asked one man that was passing\nby, I asked him, I say what city is this? He says to me this is Rovno. Can you imagine the guy\ntelling me, I was born in Rovno, I knew the whole city and I didn\u2019t recognize it. Only\nrecognized the church that was sticking out. It looked like they never aimed at churches or big\nsynagogues because that survived in the city in Rovno.",
        "Q: Synagogues survived too?",
        "A: One big synagogue which looked like a church. The main synagogue in the city of Rovno\nsurvived, and I visited Russia recently and I saw that synagogue. I was in there.",
        "Q: How about the one in which your family was hiding in?",
        "A: No, that didn\u2019t survived. Most of the houses were demolished. I couldn\u2019t even recognize the\narea where my family was. It was completely rebuilt. The whole city was rebuilt. It had only\nhappened a few years ago when I was there. When I saw this in Rovno, I wasn\u2019t able to remain\nbecause my transport was going toward Kovid and Krakow and I had to stay on the transport\nthat was taking me out of Russia until I came to the borders of Poland, and we entered Poland\nsomewheres near Krakow. When I first got off, on the first station as we entered Poland in\n1946, we saw the Polish officers, checking us out and we immediately noticed the anti-\nSemitism right away was worse than it was in Russia. They greeted us with hatred and you can\nunderstand what kind of feeling I had and I thought I made a mistake coming back to Poland. I\ncame back to Poland only to have freedom, but I didn\u2019t find it in the behavior of the Polish\npeople. So I traveled from there to a town which was Bittem. It was somewheres, I think it\nwas , the town of Bittem. It used to be a German, a lot of German people used to\nlive there before the war. When I came to the town a group of Zionist, young people, came to\nthe transport and asked all the young Jewish people that came from Russia to join the Zionist\norganization and from there go to Israel. Being that I was single and I didn\u2019t find my family, I\nknew I was all alone and young, I decided to join this organization which I was with them for\nquite a while and working with the organization in Bittem. If it was of interest to you, this\nwhole organization was trying to snuggle into Israel. It was Palestine at the time, under the\nBritish occupation and the situation at that time before the Jewish State was established, was\ncontrolled by the British and they didn\u2019t allow any Jewish people to settle, they took them all to\nCypress and other camps where they caught them on the open seas. But, nevertheless, we all\ntried very hard to get there one way or the other, because Poland was no more a place for Jews.\nDuring the time I was in that particular place, I was assigned from the organization to go on the\nmarket and buy out all the soap, which was called Rif, in Germany it was called , it\nwas made out of Jewish people and openly the German people on the market were selling that\nparticular soap in bags. It looks like it must have been with the help of the Israeli government\nor the Jewish government, we used to buy that soap out of the markets, wherever we saw it\nbeing sold and eventually, I understand it, that soap went to Israel, it was buried because it was\nmade out of Jewish people\u2019s fat. So this was one of my jobs in that particular organization in\nBittem. We also tried to find children, Jewish children that were kept in some Christian homes\nand we tried to buy them out from the Christian people to be able to go back to Israel. And we\nmanaged to find a lot of Jewish children through certain ways and investigations who had\nchildren like that. Some Christian, Polish families took in very, very young Jewish children and\nthey kept them as their own. Which was very nice. Some Christian families did not want to\ngive up their children. But a lot of them decided to allow them to go back to Israel where they\nbelong and we paid, the Jewish government, the Israeli government paid a certain amount for\nthem as a price for the good deeds that they did. Later on, I am not going to go into details\nabout what happened when Poland attacked, the Polish government attacked our house.",
        "Q: The building...",
        "A: The building where the Jewish organization was we had ninety people in this building and in\nthe middle of the night they tried to attack, the Polish army tried to attack us, which we resisted.\nWe had some guns with us but they decided and not get into that building. That building was\nclosed, it had a gate, pretty strong gate and they didn\u2019t break the gate. Somehow they went\naway and this what happened over there. This was in Bittem, and we called on the telephone\nthe Russian military which was stationed in that town, and the Russian military told us on the\ntelephone that they don\u2019t interfere with the Polish government. S they didn\u2019t want to help us.",
        "Q: When did this incident take place?",
        "A: This incident took place, 1946. There came an order from, it looks like, you know we were\ninvolved with the and other organizations that worked underground from Israel to\nbring the people, the Jewish people into Israel at the time. An order came for us to depart\nBittem, start going towards sort of Italy and we had to go to another town which was called\nKatowice and from Katowice we had special papers made for us like new names and the names\nwere given to all the ninety people, more than ninety because families of these youngsters that\nlived outside of this particular building were also taken at the same time so all of us were given\nGreek names, each one had a Greek name sort of, that we were not Jews but Greeks escaping,\ngoing to Greece and we got false documents with Polish stamps that we were Greeks and in the\nmiddle of the night, one night, we smuggled the border from Poland to Czechoslovakia. We\nhad a special guide in the middle of the night. Old and young, were walking through the woods\nin the dark and people were falling and it was raining that night, and was mud on our feet, but\nwe had to go as fast as possible because the guide he knew the way and he was going fast. So\nthe whole length of that echelon, all the people that were going in one line sort of, it stretched\nfor a long way, we managed to get in to Czechoslovakia. And we had an assigned building that\nwas waiting for us. They took us to that particular house. We came in all muddy with shoes\nfull of mud and wet. We had to wash ourselves outside in the middle of the night and from there\nwe had to go, the woman from the house took care of us, and we had something to eat and early\nin the morning they brought a truck, a flat truck sort of, maybe about two feet high, flatbed not\ncovered, they took all the older people and the children, the young children, on that truck, and it\ntraveled to Bratislava. Lying down on the truck like from , that was the town that we\nstarted, right on the border to Bratislava, the older people were lying and they were covered\nwith a canvas, and that\u2019s how they traveled all the way to Bratislava to a hotel where they had in\nBratislava for the refugees. The younger people were assigned to go by train so being\nthat is a tiny little town, didn\u2019t see too many people, slowly two by two, a boy and a\ngirl, walked towards the train station and we wanted to buy tickets. As we went to the station,\ntwo by two, not in a group, the station manager, whoever was there, noticed that so many\npeople are here. He never had that many people going by train to Bratislava that he called the\npolice, the Czechoslovakian police, the police came and arrested us. Naturally we had\ndocuments that we were Greeks so we had to, Greek we did not know how to speak, so we\nspoke whatever we knew in the Seder, in the praying book, so sort of this kind of language sort\nof we spoke. We didn\u2019t understand each other, but we made believe that we speak Greek. They\narrested us, the whole group. A Jewish organization in Bratislava found out that we were\narrested by the Czechoslovakian police, they worked very hard and they got us out and they\ntransferred us to Bratislava into that hotel where we were going to leave Czechoslovakia. They\ndidn\u2019t want us there. So we were lucky that they didn\u2019t send us back to Poland because we\nreally smuggled out of that country with false papers. When we got to Bratislava they\norganized a group of, about 200 people, to go to the border to come to Vienna. The leadership\nthat was in charge of that group had a permission to take out twenty people out of\nCzechoslovakia on the border crossing. They made 200 out of that twenty, they added another\nzero and they took 200 people on that particular document. When we came to the border, they\ngave the Czechoslovakian guard on the border a couple of cartons of American cigarettes. So\nwe crossed the border and now we are in no-man\u2019s land. We came to the Russian side which\nwas part of Vienna.",
        "Q: The Russian occupation zone?",
        "A: The Russian occupation zone of Vienna. They gave them a couple of bottles of vodka and they\nlet us through. So we boarded a streetcar in Vienna and with the streetcar we went to the\nAmerican side of Vienna and we stayed in the Rothschild Hospital in Vienna. That was like\nsort of a place, we organized that hospital as a transition place, a place for refugees until it was\ntime to go further towards Italy. My uncle Menachim was with me at certain times. He found\nme in Russia. That was my mother\u2019s youngest brother. He was in the Russian army and then\nhe was bombarded and shot. He wound up in certain parts of Russia where he found me\naccidentally and I was with him at certain places. Which, if you are interested, later on I will go\ninto it. He volunteered during Russia he volunteered to the army and we separated again in\nRussia. He was in Czechoslovakia until the end of the war even after the war, fighting Germans\nand somehow he survived and he wound up in , In a camp, displaced persons camp,\nwhere he was in sort of citizens police, in camp police, as a policeman. All the Zionist\norganizations had a conference in this camp and through one person at the conference he found\nout that I was in Vienna on the American side in Rothschild Hospital. That person at the\nconference took a message to me telling me about my uncle that he is living in ;\nwhich at that time I did not know where it was, and I should pick myself up and travel with the\nnext transport that passes by Linz and he\u2019ll wait for me. Well, I excused myself from this\norganization because I was with the Zionist organization going towards Israel all this time, and I\nsaid my uncle was there and if you don\u2019t mind I want to travel to meet him. That was the first\nrelative I ever found since the war started. And, as I was traveling, they gave me permission\nand I was traveling towards Linz. He was waiting for me, he didn\u2019t know which transport, but\nhe was waiting for one transport to the other until he found me on the transport. But the\ntransport was not supposed to stop in Linz, only stop there for refueling or something, water.\nThat transport was going towards Italy with Jewish people that were going to Israel. And as I\ncame to Linz I knew that somebody was going to wait for me at the station. I looked out the\nwindow and he spotted me and he was in sort of a Jewish with a Star of David on his sleeve,\nwith a whistle on his neck over here with a uniform Jewish Police, with a hat. So somehow the\nAustrian police at the station allowed him to get me off that transport and take me with him.\nAnd that\u2019s how I was able to get into this particular camp or displaced persons camp. He signed\nme into that camp which was a little hard because this particular camp did not\nallow new people to sign into that camp. The only ones that they allowed was brothers, sisters,\nrelatives that were there and if they found them they allowed them to take into the same room\nthey had in the camp. Because there was no room in this camp for newcomers. He managed to\ndo that by saying that I was his brother, not a nephew and I was able to get into this camp under\nthe name of Grossman, which was his name too, my name was changed a few times before that,\nso I accepted the name Grossman. He accepted the name Grossman because he knew that in\nAmerica his brothers names were Grossman, so he didn\u2019t want to make complications, so he\nmarked the name Grossman and I became a Grossman which I was a few times before when I\nmet him, and that\u2019s how I am a Grossman all this time it would be too hard to explain to\nanybody why I am not Tannenbaum, but Grossman. So under Grossman I live in the United\nStates since I came here.",
        "Q: What year?",
        "A: 1948. That\u2019s after the present.",
        "Q: Now earlier we left you...\nTape 2, Side 1. (Something is missing in going from tape | to tape 2)",
        "A: We\u2019re in Zagorsk and we built that...; it was called in Russian , 1n Russian. And\nthat\u2019s the railroad that will protect Moscow because Stalin decided, and we did. We did and we\nran it around Moscow and when Hitler came close to Moscow, about twelve kilometers, from\none part of this railroad, he probably saw it and he saw Moscow already through his binoculars.\nBut he never crossed that railroad and the railroad many times was bombarded and destroyed\nand rebuilt and stuff like that. There was an order by the Russian government to take all these\nrailroad people that were working, hundreds, maybe thousands that were all around Russia,\naround Moscow, excuse me, to ship them, and they were getting ready in Stalingrad and this\nmust, I don\u2019t remember the time.",
        "Q: Would this be after the winter?",
        "A: I don\u2019t, I can\u2019t recall the time when Stalingrad made the . Maybe in 1942 or the\nbeginning of \u201942, something like that.",
        "Q: You passed the winter near Moscow?",
        "A: Yes. When I found out that this transport is going to Stalingrad and I figure they are pushing,\naccording to the information I got, I knew that I am going to have to fight for Stalingrad and\nprobably get killed like everybody else did. But I decided to go deeper into Russia. And I took\na group of four guys, four railroad people that I knew; they were from Kovid, from my area. I\ntold them, I said, now we\u2019re not going to work on the railroad anymore, looks like we\u2019re going\ninto some kind of a different uniform and we\u2019re going to have to fight or shoot or something\nlike that, because the whole transport is going towards Stalingrad. If you want, I say we should\ndo another thing and go someplace else. Being that we didn\u2019t know where to go, but we\ndecided, all the five of us, decided to escape from that place because we are not needed\nanymore, in the middle of the night we went from that place. We were not arrested or kept\nunder special supervision, but if somebody would see us go away from that transport they\nwould be suspicious. So in the middle of the night we decided to go to the railroad station that\nwas not far from Zagorsch and go wherever it is possible to go deeper to Russia, deeper in\nRussia because the Germans were very close. We found, I particular noticed a transport that\nwas assembled with cars from the Moscow Metro and they were already stationed, they were on\nplatforms, platform beds on the railroad cars and those cars were hooked up next to these\nparticular platform station. I said to my friends, I say, look, I don\u2019t know where, but when I was\nin Moscow I saw these particular cars in the metro, in the underground, in the subway. I think\nthat these trains are being evacuated because they are valuable trains, they were very nice and if\nthey are evacuated they are not going to the front they are probably going toward deep into\nRussia. If we manage to get on this particular train we will probably go towards Russia,\nbecause we did not get information where the transport is going. So that train took off and went\nto a town of Gorki, which was north and east. It was, now I remember, it was wintertime, it was\ncold, so it must have been between \u00b041 and \u00b042, because I froze my hands someplace near\nGorki. We went into certain, there were cars, on flatbeds, there were also trucks standing on the\nplatforms so we managed to get into a door into the trucks and we were traveling in that\nparticular truck in the cabins all the way to Gorki in the cold. When we got to Gorki, we found\nout it was Gorki, we really didn\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to come to Gorki. We came to Gorki\nwe saw a whole transport of wounded soldiers. We were still in the uniform of the railroad. We\nhad our uniforms on. We went in to speak to, there were passenger train, a lot of refugees were\nthere in Gorki and they didn\u2019t allow anybody to hook on to this train because there were\nwounded soldiers from the front sort of going deep. Being that they were wounded soldiers, I\ndidn\u2019t think that these soldiers are going towards the front, they were going to deep into Russia\nfor treatment. So we decided as railroad people to go with them, but they didn\u2019t allow us to go\ninto the inside of the train to the compartments because they were soldiers and we were railroad\npeople, but they allowed us to stay in between the cars on the outside and travel till the next\nstation, maybe we\u2019ll find another transport someplace else. We traveled for a while. I know\nwhen I came off I was all frozen, my hands were frozen and all the other guys were all frozen\ntraveling in between the trains and we got out of Gorki. We managed to hook onto some\nrefugee trains later on in the cattle cars. When we got into some cars there were also refugees\nfrom Europe, from Russia, from all different towns and we managed to get in there with them,\ntravel to Quebishov, there\u2019s a town Quebishov and from Quebishov they took us to Tashkent,\nwe got off in Tashkent, that\u2019s Asia already. On the way we had a lot of trouble because the\nsanitary ways were very bad and we had lice and sicknesses and typhoid and all kinds of\nsicknesses among the people, but we managed, I managed to get to Tashkent. In Tashkent as a\nrailroad guy and as a student for a certain school in Russia in , | made an\nappointment with the chief of the railroad from the Tashkent. I was lucky enough that he made\nan appointment for me to see him and when I got up there, he was an old man, he was the chief,\nthe Kamisar, they call it, and I told him that, I told him a little lie, that we were bombarded o the\nroad as I was traveling and my transport that I was with disappeared and I managed to come\nhere and I am looking for a place to live and to stay and to work on the railroad. Well he gave\nus a place, he told me O.K., you as a machinist, you know mechanics, we\u2019ll give you a job ona\nmachine on a certain machine to work, but the other four I don\u2019t have any place except for a\nplace in Tashkent to work on the same machine that was cutting railroad ties for the railroad.\nThey would be pushing the trees up to the machine by hand and that will be their job. He gave\nus a place to live in Tashkent, a dorm. They took us into places where we could clean ourselves\nup and delouse ourselves and we lived there. I lived in Tashkent for about nine months working\non that machine, which even though there was hunger and not enough food, but I survived in\nthat place. Before I got the job, I was sleeping in Tashkent on the railway station where every\nmorning hundreds of people died, they took out, they found in the morning. They used to clean\nup the station, they found dead people from typhoid that they used to pick him up and just\nthrow him on the wagon. These were all refugees, and I couldn\u2019t live like that, that\u2019s why I\nwent to look for that job, and I was lucky enough to be able to get that job and signed in to\nTashkent under the name of Gedale Tenenboim. And I worked there for nine months with the\nmachine in this factory until my uncle, Menachim came down to the station. He passed through\nTashkent, he was on his way to the Polish army with a group. He was dismissed from the\nRussian army, he was wounded in his thigh and his mouth, but the Russians did not trust the\nPolish people to be in the Russian army so they dismissed all the Ukrainian Polish citizens, so\nthat before the Russians took over. They told them that if you want to go and join you can join\nthe army in Russia which was forming up there. When he stopped on the way to\nGuzar which was near the Afghanistan border, that\u2019s where the Polish army made, accepted\ntheir recruits. He stopped in Taskent and he found a friend from the city of Rovno and he asked\nhim what, who are the people that he knows that are from Rovno. Maybe there are some\npeople. He mentioned to him that I know there is one guy Gedale Tennenboim that comes here\nevery morning, I used to work nights on the machine. In the morning I used to go to the station\nto look for relatives, whoever passes by or who stops maybe I'll find some relatives of my\nmother or father or brothers or sister. He met me and he said, he used to meet me all the time\nand we used to talk to each other. When he saw my uncle he didn\u2019t know that he was my uncle;\nhe only mentioned my name as there is one guy Gedale Tennenboim that works here in\nTashkent. He said Gedale Tennenboim, that\u2019s my sister\u2019s son. To make it short, he went to\nthe bureau in Russia, in Tashkent, where everybody that works in the city, not as\na refugee, but if he works there has to be signed to the city, signed up as a citizen of the city. I\nwas signed in the books where I work and my name was right there. He looked it up and they\ntold him where I am, he came to the place where I was working and I\u2019m not going to go into the\ndetails how we met. It was quite a scene and he told me that now that I have found you, you\nhave to go with me. I said I can\u2019t leave the machine. I\u2019m working at night, night is my time\nwhen I have to be at the machine. There are forty people working on this particular machine. If\nI don\u2019t show up they can\u2019t work. And he says never mind, he says, you\u2019re going with me. He\nhad a list of about fifteen people that was in a group that was going with him. A lot of them\ndisappeared on the road so the list got smaller and smaller. One of the names from that\nparticular list I took. I don\u2019t remember the name and I decided to go with him. Naturally, I\ndeserted my job and I was shaking pretty badly because if the Russian , or the KGB\nwould find me, they would probably hang me. The next morning I was already back on the\nstation with all of the refugees and the way I came to Tashkent and the next morning there was a\ntrain going to this particular spot of Guzar near the Afghanistan border\nwhere the Polish were recruiting members to go to England from Russia. And I went with him\nand took one of the names on that list that he had. And on the way there was, they call it an\nablava the Russian were checking all the people on that station and checking their\npassports, their names. All my passports, all my documents, all the pictures that I had with me I\nhad to destroy at that particular station. I went into the toilet, threw out all my pictures of my\nfamily, of my brothers, whatever I had with me, my parents, all documents under the name of\nTenenboim, all my passports, and my documents that I had and I had to destroy because I was\nsort of a deserter from this particular work place and that was the end of my name Tenenboim.\nFrom there on I took the name what was on that paper, I don\u2019t remember the name because it\nwas a very short time and we went to Cuzar. And when I came to Cuzar with my uncle to sign\nup to the Polish army to fight the Germans from the English side. It was supposed to take all\nthe Polish people. Bring them to sort of Palestine, from Palestine they took them back to\nEngland and fight from maybe down there. I don\u2019t know what the English were going to do\nwith them, but help the English people fight Germany. And we wanted to sign up. When they\ntook me for a medical examination, which they undressed us completely. At that particular\npoint in Cuzar I was rejected because they found out that I was circumcised and I am Jewish,\nnot Polish even though I spoke Polish and my uncle spoke Polish and we were born in Poland,\nbut because we were Jewish they didn\u2019t accept us. And they gave me a document, in Polish it\nwas written . They gave me a document under the name of Grisorus which was the\noriginal name of my uncle, and I said I am Grisorus and the accepted it, they made me Grisorus\nand since then I was Grisorus. And I had to leave. They didn\u2019t accept me or my uncle. From\nthat point on the Russians had to go back to Russia, stay in Russia and they, because I was a\nPolish born person, they took me to different places of work, camp. They called\nit . That was work, it was an army sort of, out of civilians that were not labor, that\nwere not taken to the Russian army because we were Polish citizens and they only took us from\none camp to another camp and they shipped us to places of work like farms where they needed\nworkers and all kind of different places, from one place to the other. The last place that I was,\nbecause I can\u2019t go into that certain. I have to skip over that.",
        "Q: You were all over the place?",
        "A: I was all over the place and they worked me very hard. The last place we were was Danscoya.\nIn Danscoya I was with my uncle. He decided to volunteer to the army and he escaped from\nthat particular town into the recruiting place of the Russian army. He wanted to volunteer to\nfight the Germans and anybody that volunteered over there to the Russian army they took,\n\u2018cause they needed people to fight, and he was accepted. He left me behind in this particular\nplace, this was Khazikstan and not far from , the place was called\nDanscoya .The place was a place where they were digging ore mines and also had\npolitical prisoners. It was 200 kilometers from . It was very hard to escape from\nthere because the wilderness was all around the place of Danscoya. You couldn\u2019t escape. Even\nthe prisoners couldn\u2019t escape. It was 200 kilometers to walk in the wilderness some wolf or\nthey had wild animals on the road, they would eat you up. So nobody could escape from that\nplace and this is the last place I was. When the war ended I tried to sign up as a Polish citizen\nto go back to Poland. I had to provide certain documents, which I didn\u2019t have under the name\nof Grisaurus. I showed a picture with epaulets that I kept... That particular picture I didn\u2019t\ndestroy because there was nothing written, but was only written something in Polish with a\nstamp on the corner from the school that I went to in Poland in Rovno. And that particular\npicture I kept with me. I still have it today, a copy of it in my album and because of the\nepaulets, it was from a Zionist organization, so we had those in Poland and the corner of it was\nwritten in Polish from a Polish school. It wasn\u2019t written Rovno because that part of Rovno was\nnot on the picture, like a corner of the picture was showing but it was written in Polish so they\ncould read it. They accepted me as a Polish citizen only because of that picture and I was able\nto get documents to get out of Russia under this picture, under this document. That\u2019s how I\ncame back to Poland where I met my first anti-Semites near Krakow.",
        "Q: That was some experience. In your work I know you worked in private research, you were\nnever able to find out what happened to the rest of your family? Either through your uncle.",
        "A: Yes I have applications with the Red Cross who are looking into it now. It will probably take a\nyear, but I don\u2019t believe they will ever find it. My father would be today, if he was alive, he\nwould have been 92 years old and my mother would have been 90. My younger brothers\nrecently. My younger brothers I can\u2019t find them, but I\u2019m looking for them for the last fifty\nyears. I have documents over here that I wrote every place you could think of to look for my\nfamily. I was under the impression because of the information that I got from that friend of\nmine in Harkov that told me that he met my father, that maybe they are alive in Russia\nsomeplace. And I did everything. I wrote to Moscow, I wrote to HIAS, I wrote to Yad Vashem\nin Israel, any organization that is available, private organizations, that are searching for people\nand I never was able to get any information whether they are alive or dead. I was under the\nimpression for many years that they are alive. I was hoping, and even today I still hope, that\nmaybe they are alive. But I have doubt. Just recently the last year I gave up and I decided, no,\nthey are not alive. I went to see the graves three and a half years ago to the city where I was\nborn, Rovno. I took my wife and my daughter, who was born in the United States, and we went\nthere for a visit to the place where 17,500 Jews of that city was shot, murdered by the Germans\nwith the help of the Ukrainian police over there in the place of Susneke, the woods, which I\nknew before the war very well and they were all shot. They assembled all the Jews, most of the\nJews, and they were shot there between November 6 and 7, 1941, right after the Germans\noccupied the city. A few months later they destroyed all the Jews. Whatever was left later on,\nthey had another 5,000 Jews and they kept them in ghettos and they were killed also. And\nanother place, which was called Bially Street, I visited that particular place. I am under the\nimpression that my whole family was killed over there and the information I got was false.",
        "Q: You mean the friend of yours who saw them?",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe it. Because I did all the years, I did all I could to look for them and I can\u2019t find\nanybody.",
        "Q: Did you recognize some of the names on the monument that you saw?",
        "A: The monument, I put in my family\u2019s name on the monument down there now, because in 1990,\nthe end of October 1990, I visited Rovno again to the opening of a big monument that the\nRussian government put up in place where the Jews were killed. Because up till now there was\nno mention that Jews were killed over there. Only sort of Russian citizens. But now they have\na big tremendous monument with plates all around that particular monument. I have a picture\nof it, Pll show you a picture of that particular spot, it\u2019s tremendous, it\u2019s very big. Seventy plates\nwith 4,000 names of people that sort of got killed in this place are written. And I also registered\nmy family there.",
        "Q: Did you recognize other names there?",
        "A: The names I didn\u2019t see, I only know that after we left Rovno in 1990 where I visited, the plates\nwere written. The other writing was in Yiddish, Hebrew and Ukrainian on the monument for\nthe first time in Russia that they allowed things written in Yiddish in places like that. Because\nthe other towns, every town in the Ukraine has a massacre place has one, Ludsk has\none, Kiev, Kovid has one has one. All these towns, every town there was a\nmassacre place where they killed the Jews. At that time they didn\u2019t think of sending them to\nconcentration camps. Therefore I don\u2019t believe Pll get any knowledge from, any information\nfrom , Germany because they did not take names of the people that they were killing\nin the towns. They just surrounded them, they told them to come and they just killed them. The\ninformation that I got from Rovno where I met people, Jewish people are still living in Rovno,\nthey told me the whole story of what happened and how it happened. I met a woman in Rovno\nthat survived, which I have on video. She survived the graves, she crawled out of the graves\nbecause that night she was not hit by bullet. She survived and crawled out nude and she ran to a\nChristian, a Ukrainian or Polish I don\u2019t remember what she said, and they kept her and helped\nher to get dress and wash and she 1s one of the survivors. I met her in Rovno, she is there today,\nshe is an older woman and she 1s one of the survivors.",
        "Q: Did any of the survivors know your family?",
        "A: Down here in New York I have some people that knew my family. The people in Rovno that\nare there today did not know my family.",
        "Q: So your last image of your family is that in the synagogue on the 26\" of June 1941?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And you were going back to work?",
        "A: That was the last time I saw them, yes. In 1941, I was probably--.",
        "Q: Eighteen.",
        "A: Eighteen years old? Yeah.",
        "Q: Starting out .",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Five years of my youth was just destroyed.",
        "Q: Do you recall saying goodbye to your brothers?",
        "A: Oh, yes. There is a picture in my mind at all times. It never leaves, that picture. I will never\nforget because I remember when I said goodbye, my father took me around and hugged me and\nkissed me. My mother was crying and she was practically, like sort of hysterical, like she\nwould know that I\u2019ll never see her again. When I left her, I tried to be like a grown person\nbecause I had tears in my eyes. At the time, the tears are coming back to me right now as I\u2019m\ntalking to you, I didn\u2019t want to show her that I\u2019m like sort of a sissy that I\u2019m crying and I didn\u2019t\nturn my head back.",
        "Q: Your brothers and sister?",
        "A: They were youngsters, they were kids and they didn\u2019t understand much.",
        "Q: Any further observations?\nA I am working now with Holocaust Search for the same purpose. That I know so many people\nare looking for relatives and I don\u2019t think there 1s a better person than I am and dedicated more\nto that cause because I, myself, have the feeling and I know what it means to lose family and\nnot to be able to see them again.",

        "A: I had three brothers, excuse me, and a sister. We were five children all told",
        "A: I was the oldest of the five.",
        "A: Well, I thought it was O.K.. As a child I went to school and my father worked always very\nhard. Sometimes day and night to support the whole family because he was the only one\nworking in the family to provide. My life was, I would say, normal, according to the\ncircumstances in that particular town during the Polish occupation.",
        "A: Well, at certain times he did have a shop for himself but most of the time he worked in a small\ntown which 1s eight kilometers from the city of Rovno, it\u2019s called Abarrov (?) and he worked\nthere as a custom tailor for the people of commerce that lived in that town and he was always\nhired by them by the week to work and he used to move into their homes while he was sewing\nfor the whole family.",
        "A: No, he was from Rovno but he used to go away for the whole week and come back to the house\non Friday nights for the weekend, like for Shabbat.",
        "A: Most of the time he would walk the eight kilometers to come home or he used to take a train.\nThat was only about twenty minute\u2019s ride by train.",
        "A: I went to all kinds of schools. As a child, and I can give you exactly the, before I went to public\nschool, I must have been six, five or six, I used to go to Cheder. Like to a rabbi to learn\nYiddish. I used to go to a small Talmud Torah also before, and then I went to public school,\nwhich was compulsory at the time, when I was seven years old, in Polish public schools. And\nafter I finished, I went to a special school, specialized school sponsored by ORT, American\nORT, for three years to learn how to become an inspector for tailors which was only about\ntwenty boys. Specialized for the Polish government to spread them all over Poland to become\ninspectors.",
        "A: Yes. Each tailor that opened up a shop had to have a diploma, a master\u2019s diploma, before he\ncould open up and he had to get it from this kind of inspectors to see if they are good tailors or\nnot.",
        "A: My father would have been probably too old by then.",
        "A: No, I went to Cheder in the evenings after school and the rest of the time I spent in public\nschool.",
        "A: 1936 and then I switched over to that specialized school, ORT, which happened to be that we\nwere supposed to graduate just 100 days before the war started. No, the 100 days before\ngraduation the war started and that interrupted the whole thing.",
        "A: 1939, yes.",
        "A: It was, no, it was a private school sponsored by ORT.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, my, yes. My second brother and third brother were going to public schools and the little\nones were not of school age yet.",
        "A: In my house we spoke Yiddish. Outside we spoke Ukrainian and Polish.",
        "A: Well, the city of Rovno itself there was, I would say, eighty-five to ninety percent Jewish and so\nwe used the Polish language and Yiddish and we had very little to do with other nationalities\nexcept school where we used to get together. There was anti-Semitism but we were used to it\nand that was part of life, sorta. So we accepted it as it is.",
        "A: Well, yes, there was plenty. I, myself, before the war, my looks are not, typical sort of Jewish. I\nhave blue eyes and not a typical. I used to be able to walk on the other side where the church\nwas standing, the Polish church. It was called Koschua (?) in Rovno where I observed and read\nthe literature put out in front of the church against the Jews and anything that was possible to\nprint and make hatred. So I used to relay this information to others because it was a little\ndangerous to walk on the other side of the street. And that\u2019s the only kind of a thing. I came\nacross, myself, before the war, certain episodes like, when I used to walk to visit my father in\nAbarrov. I had to pass a little section where only Polish people live and as I was walking some\nyoungsters would attack Jewish guys. The episode was that as I was walking on the street, one\nwas screaming in Polish, \u201cDer is Yid, der is Yid . That means, \u201cis a Jew, catch him.\u201d\nWhen the other friend of his came and said are you a Jew, I said where, where is the Jew? And\nsomehow because of that asking the question where is the Jew, he was puzzled. He didn\u2019t know\nI was Jewish and he let me go. This is the kind of things as youngsters we knew. There was\nanti-Semitism.",
        "A: No, my brothers they were younger and they didn\u2019t do out of the house that much. They didn\u2019t\ntravel outside the city of Rovno so they didn\u2019t have any experiences like that, except going to\nschool.",
        "A: Well, I personally didn\u2019t have any problems with teachers. The only thing I did have a problem\nwas because I was Jewish, they transferred me from the school that was next to my house to\ntwo kilometers further, which was Degrabnik all the way in the back of the town. I had to walk\nevery day to go to school, two kilometers each way, yet there was a school next door to me.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. He had good relations with them. There was no problem at that time, among the\nUkrainian people, and my father that worked for them. He used to stay in their houses, they\ntreated him like their own.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes. Right after the death of Pilsudski, which the Jewish people liked, there was another\nMarshall, I think his name was Rydz-Smigly and his government looks like change. Because as\na youngster I realized that we had a lot of trouble. The first thing, I think that the government\nwas infiltrated with German people and they made new laws, especially for the Jews. Where\nthey made them eat non-kosher foods, they didn\u2019t allow them to kill like the Jewish way of\nkosher, and I think the woman was called Madame Priestaroba that was in charge of all this\nbusiness. Just to give the Jews a little problem.",
        "A: Personally, in school it didn\u2019t affect us but I remember there was a lot of problems among the\nJews for that problem about Kashrut. They didn\u2019t eat meat because they wouldn\u2019t eat non-\nkosher meat.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell at the time, I was too young to understand. All I knew there was no kosher food\nfor a long time and there was a strike against the government and the Jews didn\u2019t eat any meat.",
        "A: Fairly good student. Yes.",
        "A: Somewhat. I did not get into it although I had a friend whose father was a communist and was\nin jail for five years for communism and he was a good friend of mine and we used to talk about\nother ways of life. I was only studying this but I didn\u2019t belong to this kind of group at that time.",
        "A: Well, mainly Zionist orientated. Talking about Israel all the time. Judaism. We had\norganizations, Zionist organizations all kinds. There was there was Agudas\nYisroel, there was a lot of different Zionist organizations and I belonged to some of them.",
        "A: I belonged to once Agudas Yisroel, which is the religious Zionist organization, I also belonged\nto a Socialist sort of organization, I also belonged to a Socialist sort of organization\nlike . So I used to walk from one place to the other.",
        "A: One of my cousins, which is my father\u2019s sister\u2019s son, left for Israel in 1935 and he just recently\ndied in Israel. He was one of the first Halutzim they called them, that volunteered to go to build\nIsrael. It was in 1935 and I met him for the first time after the war in 1968.",
        "A: Yes. When Hitler took over, I think it was in 1933, after that on the radio people used to get\ntogether and listen to the speeches and all the propaganda they used to put out against Jews and\nother things. I remember as a child, as a youngster, that people were very upset.",
        "A: My most of the time was out of the house, which I told you before, and we didn\u2019t have a chance\nto talk politics with my father.",
        "A: My mother did not get involved with politics. She was a plain ordinary housewife taking care\nof her children and times were not good, economic times were pretty bad before the war and she\ndid not get involved in politics.",
        "A: We lived in an apartment, yes, we didn\u2019t have our own house. The house that my mother had\nwhen she got married, my grandmother came back from the United States and sold the house\nand made them move out because one of her brothers had to go to Argentina and they needed\nthe money and that was it for the house.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. There was no thought. We didn\u2019t have the means to move out and the family was too big\nand, I guess, that was the aim to stay in Rovno.",
        "A: No. We didn\u2019t have, I personally as I said before, we used to walk to that village Abarrov where\nmy father used to work and we had very good relations with the Ukrainian people. We never\nheard any anti-Semitic things against the Jews, and I used to have friends that used to play with\nUkrainians.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, we had Polish friends in school.",
        "A: No. It didn\u2019t come as a complete surprise because, as I said, the propaganda and the talk on the\nradio and all the preparation that the Polish government made before the war like digging, in\nPolish they call it ditches against bombs, places to hide. It was prepared before\nSeptember 1939.",
        "A: I would say about a year. Everyplace in Rovno we dug ditches to hide against bomb, shelters.",
        "A: From Germany.",
        "A: It was expected, yes.",
        "A: Well the Soviet Union was not expected. That was a surprise. That was called a blitzkrieg, sort\nof, against the Russians. That\u2019s what happened in 1941, June the 22, 1941.",
        "A: Oh, excuse me. The Soviet Union, that was a surprise, yes. The Soviet Union the way we\nknow made an agreement with Germany to split Poland in half. I guess the river Bulg was the\nborderline where they had the border, Poland was divided at the Bulg. My part of the territory\nfell into the Russian side.",
        "A: Just Russians.",
        "A: Ukrainian families took us in and when the Russians were approaching the Ukrainians were not\nso happy about that. They would have rather had the Germans come in than the Russians.\nSomehow I assume that the relations between the communist Russians and the Ukrainians were\nnot so good and they were afraid for the Russians. And as the Russians came in they asked us\nto leave their house and go back to our house which we did.",
        "A: \u201cYes, the Ukrainians. They didn\u2019t want to keep us. So the whole family was walking from that\ntown, eight kilometers, already with some Polish soldiers that gave themselves up to the\nRussian military, and we also walked back and as we came to the city of Rovno, there was a\nguard checking everyone who came back into the town.",
        "A: No. They just looked at us, checked us out and see, they wanted to see if we are not bourgeois\ncapitalist, and they let us in.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, thy decided that we didn\u2019t look like bourgeois.",
        "A: Yes, they were afraid that there may be bombings or maybe attacks on Jews, so he was safer in\nthat little town with his friends that he knew all the time than he was in the city of Rovno.\nThat\u2019s why he took the whole family out.",
        "A: Not at the time when the Russians occupied. The Russians just walked in the city of Rovno.\nThey were attacked by the Polish army and by the Polish police in the city of Rovno.",
        "A: The Russians.",
        "A: There was Polish resistance in both parts of the main streets of it was called at\nthe time in Rovno, I remember there was a military church where they were hiding, the Polish\npolice was hiding and as the Russian soldiers with their equipment were coming in they were\nshooting at them from behind the buildings and some of them got killed and then they killed all\nthe police that were shooting at them. Because the next day, as I walked out, when the Russians\nwere there already, I walked out and I saw a lot of them killed, police lying on the ground.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t feel so good to see that people, it was not an interesting sight.",
        "A: Well, for us as, I would consider ourselves poor family, the Russian people that came into\nRovno was better for us. We accepted them, the whole city was not so bad off when the\nRussians were there because of the city wasn\u2019t that rich and for my personal family, 1t was\ngood. The economic times got better for us as a poor family.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t bad in comparison to the Polish government.",
        "A: Yes, all the rules changed. There was a change in the system. It was a communist system and\neverything, they had propaganda and telling all the people that it\u2019s a very good system and\nthey\u2019 ll like it and it\u2019s going to be better for everybody.",
        "A: It was not dangerous because most of the Polish army that was walking on that same road with\nus, were giving themselves up to the Russian people.",
        "A: In the beginning they still kept their farms but, I understand that later on they had to give up\ntheir farms to the Russian government and work with them as co-hosts whatever they\nestablished at that point. But personally when the Russians came in I was going to school and\nthen I transferred to a Russian controlled school where they taught us Russian language and\ncontinued education.",
        "A: Yes, that was not necessary anymore because the Russian government didn\u2019t have the same\nsystem as the Polish government so I gave up the whole education that I had for that purpose. I\nwent to a Russian public school for a short time, and after awhile I read an announcement that\nthey are looking for students for a specialized school and I signed up. This specialized school\nhad to do with railroad working, on the railroad, which was located in Zdolbuniv, twelve\nkilometers from the city of Rovno. The school was very nicely organized, we had dormitories\nwhere we stayed all the time and we were learning Russian and also specialty in locomotive\nwork, locomotive engineering, building cars, railroad cars, and after that to work on the\nrailroad.",
        "A: Yes, I graduated to become a locomotive engineer, driving a locomotive which I liked very\nmuch, and after I graduated they sent me to a place to work, which was called Kamionka\nStrumifowa located about twenty five kilometers from Lubov, the city of Lubov. It was also\nlocated on the German border, very close t the German new border, which was in Poland.",
        "A: I graduated in 1941.",
        "A: That\u2019s when I went to work. A few months maybe three or four months before the war started.",
        "A: Now, I separated for about 200 to, I would say about 300 kilometers from the city of Rovno,\nand I was already on my own just in touch by writing letters and that\u2019s all. I was already grown\nup at that time.",
        "A: My family, my father was still working as a tailor and there was not much different than it was\nbefore.",
        "A: My brothers and sister were growing up and I was not in touch with them.",
        "A: During the time that I was gone, nothing especially happened to my family, they were growing\nup and I was there until the war started..\nS: No.",
        "A: Just getting myself established. I always wanted to grow up, my aim was to grow up and to\nhelp my family. Because I was the oldest one and I saw how much they were suffering\neconomically, I felt that with the education that I got I would be able to help them, and that was\non my mind at all times.",
        "A: I was always sponsored. My parents did not have the means to pay for my education, so I was\nsponsored by the ORT organization. Then when the Russians came in there was no charge.",
        "A: Yes, I was in and that\u2019s when the real business started, right there.",
        "A: On June, would you like to tell me the whole episode?",
        "A:\u201d \u2014 Sure. One June the 22\u2122, early in the morning about 4 o\u2019clock in the morning, being that I was\non the border and working on the railroad at that particular town , 1n the morning I\nsaw airplanes overhead fighting with Russian airplanes. That was the start of the war. Already\nI saw one airplane shot down by the German airplanes and that pilot landed not far from us. He\nparachuted out. I saw the Germans were flying around him while he was being parachuted and\nthey were shooting at him flying down. They made a few holes in the parachute, but they didn\u2019t\nget him and he safely landed. That\u2019s how we knew that something was going on between the\nGermans and the Russians. At 12 0\u2019clock that day, the, Molotov at the time, announced that\nthere was war and attack on Russia and there was war between Russia and Germany. The first\nfew hours while I was there, the railroad lines between and Lutzk was cut. So, we\nalready were paralyzed on the railroad because the Germans bombarded the railroad and no\ntrains were coming into our station. My chief of the station knew about that, that we were\nparalyzed. He was upset, he had his whole family, he was a Russian. He was the chief of that\nstation, and I worked under his command. And, he said to me that you stay over here I will take\nmy family with the children and take them out to the city of Lubov. I saw that there was no\nreason for me to stay at the station because there was no communication and there was no\nconnection between the stations already, because we were cut off, and I was upset about staying\nall by myself in that station. I knew the Germans were close by, so I said why do I have to stay\nhere, there is nothing to do anyway now, why won\u2019t I go with you and help you to evacuate\nyour family to Lubov and then we will together come back to the station to work. Well, he\nagreed and it was my luck, we camouflaged, it was the only locomotive left on the station. We\ncamouflaged one of the cars traveling to Lubov. We never made it back, because the Germans\noccupied that part and from there on we did not stop in Lubov, but we got connected to another\ntransport and we traveled towards the Russian territory in the east, by train, and we had, I\nremember, a open platform train, where old cars were open like platforms and we took that train\nand we traveled to Rovno which took us a couple of days. I would say about three days to\ntravel from Lubov to Rovno because of the bombardments from the air by the Germans. Every\ntime we heard airplanes we had to stop the trains, run off to the sides, hide because they were\nshooting, they were flying very low and shooting at us with the automatic machine guns from\nthe airplanes. When they were gone, we continued until I came to where I was still\nassigned to the railroad and this , which I mentioned before was twelve kilometers\nfrom Rovno. I think it was June the 25\". Being that was only twelve kilometers\nfrom Rovno and my family lived in Rovno, and I didn\u2019t see them for a long time, I decided to\ngo to Rovno to see my family. I was assigned to a post to be back at 10 o\u2019clock at night, to\nwatch a certain part of the main terminal of and I was free until 10 o\u2019clock that\nevening. So I went to Rovno and met my family.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know I was coming, they were very happy to see me, they thought I was already\ndead, maybe, or whatever, and I decided at that time, there were bombardments while I was in\nRovno. During the day the German airplanes used to fly in and bombard sections of the city. In\norder for my family to be safer, I told them to move to a section which was called Kapkaz that\nwas the other part of the city, like one section 1s towards east of the city like facing the Russians\nand we had an uncle who was the keeper of the synagogue.\nTape 1, Side 1",
        "A: To bring them over to that part of the town was already late and I had to go back\nto where I was assigned to be there at 10 o\u2019clock. Because about 7:30 or 8\u2019clock,\nI left my family, I said goodbye to my father, my whole family and (a portion of tape is blank).",
        "A: I am going to repeat a few sentences. When I brought my family over to Kafkaz it was late in\nthe day and I had to go back to Slobonov where I was assigned. We didn\u2019t know at the time that\nthe Germans are going to take over most of the territory. We figured it\u2019s just a temporary thing\nand the Russians are going to be able to fight back the Germans and life 1s going to go on\nnormal. I was responsible for my job where I was in Slobonov so I had to leave my family. My\nmother did not want me to go back. She insisted I should stay with the family, in that\nsynagogue. I spoke to my father, he was more like sort of reasonable, and he said to me, I\nremember and I\u2019ll never forget it, he said, my son, you are a grown man, you have to make your\nown decisions what to do. If you think that it 1s important for you to go back, then you have to\ngo back. So I had no problems with my father, but my mother was insisting I should stay with\nthem. I made up my mind to go back because I felt that if I don\u2019t, I will be responsible for the\njob I\u2019m supposed to do on the railroad in Slobonov because it is a major depot place where\nsoldiers and with the Russian soldiers and they had to be transported from one place to the other\nand it was important for me to be there. So, I said to my parents that I\u2019m going to be there\ntonight. After I finish my job in the morning I\u2019ll see you back. [ll come back to the city and\nsee you again. On the way to Slobonov walking, I walked out about six kilometers, about half\nway, from the city of Rovno to Slobonov there was an attack. It was sort of getting dark that\nday, already late in the day, and I was walking with the road of the railroad, that\u2019s how I came to\nSlobonov and a lot of planes were coming towards us and there were another few people and\neveryone was hiding and I was also hiding from the airplanes. We didn\u2019t know they were going\nto attack us, they were flying very low and I saw them go towards Rovno, towards the city of\nRovno. A few minutes later I looked out, all the airplanes they spread like sort of in one line\nand they attacked the city of Rovno from one end to the other. And a few minutes later I saw\nthe whole city burning. I was six kilometers out of the city. It was very hard for me to make a\ndecision what to do now. I didn\u2019t know whether my family was killed at the time or not,\nbecause the city was on fire from one end to the other. I made a decision to go to work because\nI figured like that. If I don\u2019t go to work and nothing happened to my family I would be a\ndeserter, because I was sort of mobilized already by the Russian army to be on the railroad, and\nthen they will kill me as a deserter, the Russian government. If my family is dead, I won\u2019t see\nthem anyhow. So I decided that in the morning when I finish my work, I will run back to the\ncity. Being that I came back to Slobonov I was on my place of work, watching the cars on the\noutside. I was assigned to that, we had a few attacks in the middle, like already dark later on,\nwe had attacks by the German airplanes on the railroad, on the station.",
        "A: On the station that I was working. A whole group of people started to run out of the station\nbecause they aimed at the depot, at the station where I was working. And I ran out to the\noutskirts of Slobonov. We went into a house a few kilometers from the depot, from the\nSlobonov station and I walked into the house and I said I have to stay here, I have to rest until\nthis thing is over and I\u2019ll have to rest here in your house and the woman did not disagree, she let\nus in, there were a few men already sleeping on the floor, and she said I have no room, the only\nplace I have is on the floor. If you want to accept it, it\u2019s O.K. I asked her, I said please, if I fall\nasleep, wake me up, but early, early in the morning. Being that I was tired and I didn\u2019t sleep for\na few days, traveling from Lubov to Rovno, I was very tired so I fell asleep on the floor. I was\nso tired that the woman just couldn\u2019t get me up early in the morning and she let me sleep. She\ndidn\u2019t know the reason why I had to be up early. About 8 o\u2019clock, sort of, in the morning I got\nup. I said, why didn\u2019t you wake me up, I was supposed to be on the station working. Well, I\nwalked out of the house and I ran towards the station where I was supposed to be working. As I\ncame close to the rails, I saw German tank facing a column of Russian soldiers with their gun\nfrom the tank pointing at them and all the Russians with their hands up were standing in front of\ntheir building from that column. And I couldn\u2019t figure it out that the Germans were there\nalready because I didn\u2019t see Germans until that point, that was the first tank I ever saw German\nexcept in the air, the bombardment. So I walked around behind the tank.",
        "A: I had a uniform, I had a railroad uniform on but not a Russian soldier uniform and behind the\ntank I just passed, they didn\u2019t mind me they only wanted the soldiers and they didn\u2019t do\nanything to me. So I walked right up. It was an uphill, I walked up to the railroad and I went\ninto the station and I took a look. During the night most of the trains and locomotives were\nevacuated going east while I was asleep and I didn\u2019t see anybody on the station. Everybody\nwas evacuated. It was empty. It was a very foolish, stupid episode that if you\u2019re interested I'll\ntell you that I carried a little suitcase, I had some underwear, clothes that I had and I put it in a\nwarehouse when I came down with the train from Slobonov originally, and it was in that\nwarehouse. I figured if I have to run I got to have my suitcase so I ran to that warehouse and\nthere was still an old woman closing up to run away too. I said to her, I have my suitcase with\nmy clothes in it, I would like to get it. There were hundreds of suitcases lying there, I was\nlooking for my personal suitcase which didn\u2019t have much to look at and I found my suitcase and\nwith the suitcase I ran towards the smoke that I saw going east from the chimney. The smoke\nwas coming out of the locomotives, they were going one after the other probably about two\nkilometers away from the station already.",
        "A: To the east. I decided to go as fast as I can towards those locomotives and they were going very\nslow because they couldn\u2019t, looks like ahead of them they had some problems, so they were\ntraveling very slow and I could catch up with them, and the last locomotive was a friend of\nmine that also was operating that locomotive. When he saw me run he slowed down and he\npicked me up. And on that locomotive I was until we got into Russia. Never had a chance to\ngo back to Rovno to see if my family was alive or dead. And this was the last time I ever saw\nmy family.",
        "A: About June 26\".",
        "A: I think my mother was, she wanted to keep the family together. Being I was the only one out\nworking, so she wanted me to be with them.",
        "A: Well, after I was working, I was on the railroad traveling around for six months, I was assigned\nin Russia to be on a group of railroad people, a special transport that would be kept in case they\nneed us for work with the military. So as the Russians, which most of the time they were\nretreating, the Russian army, we were like sort of behind the lines traveling back and forth in\ncase the government would need a transport for some reason. So I was on the railroad for six\nmonths, just living in cars with a whole group, hundreds of people, of railroad people, that\nworked on the railroad for the purpose of restoring the railroad if it was bombarded, for\ntransporting military back and fort. So my job at the time was just to travel. That\u2019s why I lived\nand as the Russians were retreating so did we with the transport we were retreating. Where we\ngot up to a town further away from Harkov. I don\u2019t remember that town that we stayed. As I\nwas working on the station over there we actually parked at that place and we worked at the\nstation and I used to go out to see all the transports that were coming by this station going east\ntowards Russia and they called them , people that run away from the occupied areas\nof Germany, people that were running away from the front. Whoever could evacuate\nthemselves, they were passing by our station and I was checking every car to look for relatives,\nfriends from the city of Rovno. Whether they were passing by too. And I looked into every car\nas they were coming by. I met one guy and he was a son of one of our landlords and he knew\nmy family very well. He met me and he told me that my family, my father, met him on the\nstation in Harkov, that\u2019s a city in Russia.",
        "A: It was in the Ukraine. It wasn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know exactly the mileage how far it was from Rovno,\nbut it was still the Ukraine. He said to me that my father approached me and asked him whether\nhe saw me. And at that time, nobody saw me, and he said to my father, no. Well, he repeated\nthose words to me when he met me. He said my father asked if I saw you, but I did not see you\nuntil now. He knew that, he said to me that the whole family and my father were in a school in\nHarkov, and they were waiting for evacuation further, or something. He continued and I\ndecided to go to Harkov, which was already evacuated.",
        "A: This was in 1941.",
        "A: No, not that much later. I would say maybe a month. Sometimes, I would say, in July. I don\u2019t\nremember the date. Bit I decided to run and take the first transport that goes there and being I\nworked on the railroad, I could travel and I traveled towards Harkov. I walked on the streets,\nwhich were deserted. There were no people in Harkov anymore. I tried to find somebody to\ndirect me to a certain school, I came to that school and nobody was there. I came back to the\nsame city I worked and did not meet anybody in Harkov. The whole city was deserted and\nevacuated. That was the only information that I ever had about my family. Whether they\nremained in the city, whether they were evacuated someplace, whether they walked out, I will\nnever know.",
        "A: He was the only one that I ever met.",
        "A: It was sometime in July in Harkov. And that\u2019s it. Since then...",
        "A: After the war, \u2019'm going to jump a little bit. After the war I managed to get out of Russia, I\ntraveled, they told us that we will go to Poland. Rovno the city of Rovno remained under the\nRussian government after the war, because this was part of the Ukraine and never changed\nhands back to Poland. On the way back I managed to get out of Russia and we were supposed\nto travel towards Kovid, it\u2019s a city, Kovid, and my transport got diverted instead of going to\nKovid, went towards Rovno. Overnight was traveling and in the morning I get up and I walk\nout on the station and when I opened up the doors, we stopped at that station, and as I opened\nup the door I see a church, the one I mentioned before, a Polish church, which I recognized, I\nfigured that every city in Poland, I knew I was in Poland but I didn\u2019t know which town, I\nfigured in my mind that every city in Poland has a church like that. So I say this must be\nPoland already, because I see the church 1s just like the one we had in Rovno. The rest of the\ntown was completely bombarded, it was leveled. So as I walk out of the station, I didn\u2019t\nrecognize the station, it was also bombarded, demolished, and I asked one man that was passing\nby, I asked him, I say what city is this? He says to me this is Rovno. Can you imagine the guy\ntelling me, I was born in Rovno, I knew the whole city and I didn\u2019t recognize it. Only\nrecognized the church that was sticking out. It looked like they never aimed at churches or big\nsynagogues because that survived in the city in Rovno.",
        "A: One big synagogue which looked like a church. The main synagogue in the city of Rovno\nsurvived, and I visited Russia recently and I saw that synagogue. I was in there.",
        "A: No, that didn\u2019t survived. Most of the houses were demolished. I couldn\u2019t even recognize the\narea where my family was. It was completely rebuilt. The whole city was rebuilt. It had only\nhappened a few years ago when I was there. When I saw this in Rovno, I wasn\u2019t able to remain\nbecause my transport was going toward Kovid and Krakow and I had to stay on the transport\nthat was taking me out of Russia until I came to the borders of Poland, and we entered Poland\nsomewheres near Krakow. When I first got off, on the first station as we entered Poland in\n1946, we saw the Polish officers, checking us out and we immediately noticed the anti-\nSemitism right away was worse than it was in Russia. They greeted us with hatred and you can\nunderstand what kind of feeling I had and I thought I made a mistake coming back to Poland. I\ncame back to Poland only to have freedom, but I didn\u2019t find it in the behavior of the Polish\npeople. So I traveled from there to a town which was Bittem. It was somewheres, I think it\nwas , the town of Bittem. It used to be a German, a lot of German people used to\nlive there before the war. When I came to the town a group of Zionist, young people, came to\nthe transport and asked all the young Jewish people that came from Russia to join the Zionist\norganization and from there go to Israel. Being that I was single and I didn\u2019t find my family, I\nknew I was all alone and young, I decided to join this organization which I was with them for\nquite a while and working with the organization in Bittem. If it was of interest to you, this\nwhole organization was trying to snuggle into Israel. It was Palestine at the time, under the\nBritish occupation and the situation at that time before the Jewish State was established, was\ncontrolled by the British and they didn\u2019t allow any Jewish people to settle, they took them all to\nCypress and other camps where they caught them on the open seas. But, nevertheless, we all\ntried very hard to get there one way or the other, because Poland was no more a place for Jews.\nDuring the time I was in that particular place, I was assigned from the organization to go on the\nmarket and buy out all the soap, which was called Rif, in Germany it was called , it\nwas made out of Jewish people and openly the German people on the market were selling that\nparticular soap in bags. It looks like it must have been with the help of the Israeli government\nor the Jewish government, we used to buy that soap out of the markets, wherever we saw it\nbeing sold and eventually, I understand it, that soap went to Israel, it was buried because it was\nmade out of Jewish people\u2019s fat. So this was one of my jobs in that particular organization in\nBittem. We also tried to find children, Jewish children that were kept in some Christian homes\nand we tried to buy them out from the Christian people to be able to go back to Israel. And we\nmanaged to find a lot of Jewish children through certain ways and investigations who had\nchildren like that. Some Christian, Polish families took in very, very young Jewish children and\nthey kept them as their own. Which was very nice. Some Christian families did not want to\ngive up their children. But a lot of them decided to allow them to go back to Israel where they\nbelong and we paid, the Jewish government, the Israeli government paid a certain amount for\nthem as a price for the good deeds that they did. Later on, I am not going to go into details\nabout what happened when Poland attacked, the Polish government attacked our house.",
        "A: The building where the Jewish organization was we had ninety people in this building and in\nthe middle of the night they tried to attack, the Polish army tried to attack us, which we resisted.\nWe had some guns with us but they decided and not get into that building. That building was\nclosed, it had a gate, pretty strong gate and they didn\u2019t break the gate. Somehow they went\naway and this what happened over there. This was in Bittem, and we called on the telephone\nthe Russian military which was stationed in that town, and the Russian military told us on the\ntelephone that they don\u2019t interfere with the Polish government. S they didn\u2019t want to help us.",
        "A: This incident took place, 1946. There came an order from, it looks like, you know we were\ninvolved with the and other organizations that worked underground from Israel to\nbring the people, the Jewish people into Israel at the time. An order came for us to depart\nBittem, start going towards sort of Italy and we had to go to another town which was called\nKatowice and from Katowice we had special papers made for us like new names and the names\nwere given to all the ninety people, more than ninety because families of these youngsters that\nlived outside of this particular building were also taken at the same time so all of us were given\nGreek names, each one had a Greek name sort of, that we were not Jews but Greeks escaping,\ngoing to Greece and we got false documents with Polish stamps that we were Greeks and in the\nmiddle of the night, one night, we smuggled the border from Poland to Czechoslovakia. We\nhad a special guide in the middle of the night. Old and young, were walking through the woods\nin the dark and people were falling and it was raining that night, and was mud on our feet, but\nwe had to go as fast as possible because the guide he knew the way and he was going fast. So\nthe whole length of that echelon, all the people that were going in one line sort of, it stretched\nfor a long way, we managed to get in to Czechoslovakia. And we had an assigned building that\nwas waiting for us. They took us to that particular house. We came in all muddy with shoes\nfull of mud and wet. We had to wash ourselves outside in the middle of the night and from there\nwe had to go, the woman from the house took care of us, and we had something to eat and early\nin the morning they brought a truck, a flat truck sort of, maybe about two feet high, flatbed not\ncovered, they took all the older people and the children, the young children, on that truck, and it\ntraveled to Bratislava. Lying down on the truck like from , that was the town that we\nstarted, right on the border to Bratislava, the older people were lying and they were covered\nwith a canvas, and that\u2019s how they traveled all the way to Bratislava to a hotel where they had in\nBratislava for the refugees. The younger people were assigned to go by train so being\nthat is a tiny little town, didn\u2019t see too many people, slowly two by two, a boy and a\ngirl, walked towards the train station and we wanted to buy tickets. As we went to the station,\ntwo by two, not in a group, the station manager, whoever was there, noticed that so many\npeople are here. He never had that many people going by train to Bratislava that he called the\npolice, the Czechoslovakian police, the police came and arrested us. Naturally we had\ndocuments that we were Greeks so we had to, Greek we did not know how to speak, so we\nspoke whatever we knew in the Seder, in the praying book, so sort of this kind of language sort\nof we spoke. We didn\u2019t understand each other, but we made believe that we speak Greek. They\narrested us, the whole group. A Jewish organization in Bratislava found out that we were\narrested by the Czechoslovakian police, they worked very hard and they got us out and they\ntransferred us to Bratislava into that hotel where we were going to leave Czechoslovakia. They\ndidn\u2019t want us there. So we were lucky that they didn\u2019t send us back to Poland because we\nreally smuggled out of that country with false papers. When we got to Bratislava they\norganized a group of, about 200 people, to go to the border to come to Vienna. The leadership\nthat was in charge of that group had a permission to take out twenty people out of\nCzechoslovakia on the border crossing. They made 200 out of that twenty, they added another\nzero and they took 200 people on that particular document. When we came to the border, they\ngave the Czechoslovakian guard on the border a couple of cartons of American cigarettes. So\nwe crossed the border and now we are in no-man\u2019s land. We came to the Russian side which\nwas part of Vienna.",
        "A: The Russian occupation zone of Vienna. They gave them a couple of bottles of vodka and they\nlet us through. So we boarded a streetcar in Vienna and with the streetcar we went to the\nAmerican side of Vienna and we stayed in the Rothschild Hospital in Vienna. That was like\nsort of a place, we organized that hospital as a transition place, a place for refugees until it was\ntime to go further towards Italy. My uncle Menachim was with me at certain times. He found\nme in Russia. That was my mother\u2019s youngest brother. He was in the Russian army and then\nhe was bombarded and shot. He wound up in certain parts of Russia where he found me\naccidentally and I was with him at certain places. Which, if you are interested, later on I will go\ninto it. He volunteered during Russia he volunteered to the army and we separated again in\nRussia. He was in Czechoslovakia until the end of the war even after the war, fighting Germans\nand somehow he survived and he wound up in , In a camp, displaced persons camp,\nwhere he was in sort of citizens police, in camp police, as a policeman. All the Zionist\norganizations had a conference in this camp and through one person at the conference he found\nout that I was in Vienna on the American side in Rothschild Hospital. That person at the\nconference took a message to me telling me about my uncle that he is living in ;\nwhich at that time I did not know where it was, and I should pick myself up and travel with the\nnext transport that passes by Linz and he\u2019ll wait for me. Well, I excused myself from this\norganization because I was with the Zionist organization going towards Israel all this time, and I\nsaid my uncle was there and if you don\u2019t mind I want to travel to meet him. That was the first\nrelative I ever found since the war started. And, as I was traveling, they gave me permission\nand I was traveling towards Linz. He was waiting for me, he didn\u2019t know which transport, but\nhe was waiting for one transport to the other until he found me on the transport. But the\ntransport was not supposed to stop in Linz, only stop there for refueling or something, water.\nThat transport was going towards Italy with Jewish people that were going to Israel. And as I\ncame to Linz I knew that somebody was going to wait for me at the station. I looked out the\nwindow and he spotted me and he was in sort of a Jewish with a Star of David on his sleeve,\nwith a whistle on his neck over here with a uniform Jewish Police, with a hat. So somehow the\nAustrian police at the station allowed him to get me off that transport and take me with him.\nAnd that\u2019s how I was able to get into this particular camp or displaced persons camp. He signed\nme into that camp which was a little hard because this particular camp did not\nallow new people to sign into that camp. The only ones that they allowed was brothers, sisters,\nrelatives that were there and if they found them they allowed them to take into the same room\nthey had in the camp. Because there was no room in this camp for newcomers. He managed to\ndo that by saying that I was his brother, not a nephew and I was able to get into this camp under\nthe name of Grossman, which was his name too, my name was changed a few times before that,\nso I accepted the name Grossman. He accepted the name Grossman because he knew that in\nAmerica his brothers names were Grossman, so he didn\u2019t want to make complications, so he\nmarked the name Grossman and I became a Grossman which I was a few times before when I\nmet him, and that\u2019s how I am a Grossman all this time it would be too hard to explain to\nanybody why I am not Tannenbaum, but Grossman. So under Grossman I live in the United\nStates since I came here.",
        "A: 1948. That\u2019s after the present.\nTape 2, Side 1. (Something is missing in going from tape | to tape 2)",
        "A: We\u2019re in Zagorsk and we built that...; it was called in Russian , 1n Russian. And\nthat\u2019s the railroad that will protect Moscow because Stalin decided, and we did. We did and we\nran it around Moscow and when Hitler came close to Moscow, about twelve kilometers, from\none part of this railroad, he probably saw it and he saw Moscow already through his binoculars.\nBut he never crossed that railroad and the railroad many times was bombarded and destroyed\nand rebuilt and stuff like that. There was an order by the Russian government to take all these\nrailroad people that were working, hundreds, maybe thousands that were all around Russia,\naround Moscow, excuse me, to ship them, and they were getting ready in Stalingrad and this\nmust, I don\u2019t remember the time.",
        "A: I don\u2019t, I can\u2019t recall the time when Stalingrad made the . Maybe in 1942 or the\nbeginning of \u201942, something like that.",
        "A: Yes. When I found out that this transport is going to Stalingrad and I figure they are pushing,\naccording to the information I got, I knew that I am going to have to fight for Stalingrad and\nprobably get killed like everybody else did. But I decided to go deeper into Russia. And I took\na group of four guys, four railroad people that I knew; they were from Kovid, from my area. I\ntold them, I said, now we\u2019re not going to work on the railroad anymore, looks like we\u2019re going\ninto some kind of a different uniform and we\u2019re going to have to fight or shoot or something\nlike that, because the whole transport is going towards Stalingrad. If you want, I say we should\ndo another thing and go someplace else. Being that we didn\u2019t know where to go, but we\ndecided, all the five of us, decided to escape from that place because we are not needed\nanymore, in the middle of the night we went from that place. We were not arrested or kept\nunder special supervision, but if somebody would see us go away from that transport they\nwould be suspicious. So in the middle of the night we decided to go to the railroad station that\nwas not far from Zagorsch and go wherever it is possible to go deeper to Russia, deeper in\nRussia because the Germans were very close. We found, I particular noticed a transport that\nwas assembled with cars from the Moscow Metro and they were already stationed, they were on\nplatforms, platform beds on the railroad cars and those cars were hooked up next to these\nparticular platform station. I said to my friends, I say, look, I don\u2019t know where, but when I was\nin Moscow I saw these particular cars in the metro, in the underground, in the subway. I think\nthat these trains are being evacuated because they are valuable trains, they were very nice and if\nthey are evacuated they are not going to the front they are probably going toward deep into\nRussia. If we manage to get on this particular train we will probably go towards Russia,\nbecause we did not get information where the transport is going. So that train took off and went\nto a town of Gorki, which was north and east. It was, now I remember, it was wintertime, it was\ncold, so it must have been between \u00b041 and \u00b042, because I froze my hands someplace near\nGorki. We went into certain, there were cars, on flatbeds, there were also trucks standing on the\nplatforms so we managed to get into a door into the trucks and we were traveling in that\nparticular truck in the cabins all the way to Gorki in the cold. When we got to Gorki, we found\nout it was Gorki, we really didn\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to come to Gorki. We came to Gorki\nwe saw a whole transport of wounded soldiers. We were still in the uniform of the railroad. We\nhad our uniforms on. We went in to speak to, there were passenger train, a lot of refugees were\nthere in Gorki and they didn\u2019t allow anybody to hook on to this train because there were\nwounded soldiers from the front sort of going deep. Being that they were wounded soldiers, I\ndidn\u2019t think that these soldiers are going towards the front, they were going to deep into Russia\nfor treatment. So we decided as railroad people to go with them, but they didn\u2019t allow us to go\ninto the inside of the train to the compartments because they were soldiers and we were railroad\npeople, but they allowed us to stay in between the cars on the outside and travel till the next\nstation, maybe we\u2019ll find another transport someplace else. We traveled for a while. I know\nwhen I came off I was all frozen, my hands were frozen and all the other guys were all frozen\ntraveling in between the trains and we got out of Gorki. We managed to hook onto some\nrefugee trains later on in the cattle cars. When we got into some cars there were also refugees\nfrom Europe, from Russia, from all different towns and we managed to get in there with them,\ntravel to Quebishov, there\u2019s a town Quebishov and from Quebishov they took us to Tashkent,\nwe got off in Tashkent, that\u2019s Asia already. On the way we had a lot of trouble because the\nsanitary ways were very bad and we had lice and sicknesses and typhoid and all kinds of\nsicknesses among the people, but we managed, I managed to get to Tashkent. In Tashkent as a\nrailroad guy and as a student for a certain school in Russia in , | made an\nappointment with the chief of the railroad from the Tashkent. I was lucky enough that he made\nan appointment for me to see him and when I got up there, he was an old man, he was the chief,\nthe Kamisar, they call it, and I told him that, I told him a little lie, that we were bombarded o the\nroad as I was traveling and my transport that I was with disappeared and I managed to come\nhere and I am looking for a place to live and to stay and to work on the railroad. Well he gave\nus a place, he told me O.K., you as a machinist, you know mechanics, we\u2019ll give you a job ona\nmachine on a certain machine to work, but the other four I don\u2019t have any place except for a\nplace in Tashkent to work on the same machine that was cutting railroad ties for the railroad.\nThey would be pushing the trees up to the machine by hand and that will be their job. He gave\nus a place to live in Tashkent, a dorm. They took us into places where we could clean ourselves\nup and delouse ourselves and we lived there. I lived in Tashkent for about nine months working\non that machine, which even though there was hunger and not enough food, but I survived in\nthat place. Before I got the job, I was sleeping in Tashkent on the railway station where every\nmorning hundreds of people died, they took out, they found in the morning. They used to clean\nup the station, they found dead people from typhoid that they used to pick him up and just\nthrow him on the wagon. These were all refugees, and I couldn\u2019t live like that, that\u2019s why I\nwent to look for that job, and I was lucky enough to be able to get that job and signed in to\nTashkent under the name of Gedale Tenenboim. And I worked there for nine months with the\nmachine in this factory until my uncle, Menachim came down to the station. He passed through\nTashkent, he was on his way to the Polish army with a group. He was dismissed from the\nRussian army, he was wounded in his thigh and his mouth, but the Russians did not trust the\nPolish people to be in the Russian army so they dismissed all the Ukrainian Polish citizens, so\nthat before the Russians took over. They told them that if you want to go and join you can join\nthe army in Russia which was forming up there. When he stopped on the way to\nGuzar which was near the Afghanistan border, that\u2019s where the Polish army made, accepted\ntheir recruits. He stopped in Taskent and he found a friend from the city of Rovno and he asked\nhim what, who are the people that he knows that are from Rovno. Maybe there are some\npeople. He mentioned to him that I know there is one guy Gedale Tennenboim that comes here\nevery morning, I used to work nights on the machine. In the morning I used to go to the station\nto look for relatives, whoever passes by or who stops maybe I'll find some relatives of my\nmother or father or brothers or sister. He met me and he said, he used to meet me all the time\nand we used to talk to each other. When he saw my uncle he didn\u2019t know that he was my uncle;\nhe only mentioned my name as there is one guy Gedale Tennenboim that works here in\nTashkent. He said Gedale Tennenboim, that\u2019s my sister\u2019s son. To make it short, he went to\nthe bureau in Russia, in Tashkent, where everybody that works in the city, not as\na refugee, but if he works there has to be signed to the city, signed up as a citizen of the city. I\nwas signed in the books where I work and my name was right there. He looked it up and they\ntold him where I am, he came to the place where I was working and I\u2019m not going to go into the\ndetails how we met. It was quite a scene and he told me that now that I have found you, you\nhave to go with me. I said I can\u2019t leave the machine. I\u2019m working at night, night is my time\nwhen I have to be at the machine. There are forty people working on this particular machine. If\nI don\u2019t show up they can\u2019t work. And he says never mind, he says, you\u2019re going with me. He\nhad a list of about fifteen people that was in a group that was going with him. A lot of them\ndisappeared on the road so the list got smaller and smaller. One of the names from that\nparticular list I took. I don\u2019t remember the name and I decided to go with him. Naturally, I\ndeserted my job and I was shaking pretty badly because if the Russian , or the KGB\nwould find me, they would probably hang me. The next morning I was already back on the\nstation with all of the refugees and the way I came to Tashkent and the next morning there was a\ntrain going to this particular spot of Guzar near the Afghanistan border\nwhere the Polish were recruiting members to go to England from Russia. And I went with him\nand took one of the names on that list that he had. And on the way there was, they call it an\nablava the Russian were checking all the people on that station and checking their\npassports, their names. All my passports, all my documents, all the pictures that I had with me I\nhad to destroy at that particular station. I went into the toilet, threw out all my pictures of my\nfamily, of my brothers, whatever I had with me, my parents, all documents under the name of\nTenenboim, all my passports, and my documents that I had and I had to destroy because I was\nsort of a deserter from this particular work place and that was the end of my name Tenenboim.\nFrom there on I took the name what was on that paper, I don\u2019t remember the name because it\nwas a very short time and we went to Cuzar. And when I came to Cuzar with my uncle to sign\nup to the Polish army to fight the Germans from the English side. It was supposed to take all\nthe Polish people. Bring them to sort of Palestine, from Palestine they took them back to\nEngland and fight from maybe down there. I don\u2019t know what the English were going to do\nwith them, but help the English people fight Germany. And we wanted to sign up. When they\ntook me for a medical examination, which they undressed us completely. At that particular\npoint in Cuzar I was rejected because they found out that I was circumcised and I am Jewish,\nnot Polish even though I spoke Polish and my uncle spoke Polish and we were born in Poland,\nbut because we were Jewish they didn\u2019t accept us. And they gave me a document, in Polish it\nwas written . They gave me a document under the name of Grisorus which was the\noriginal name of my uncle, and I said I am Grisorus and the accepted it, they made me Grisorus\nand since then I was Grisorus. And I had to leave. They didn\u2019t accept me or my uncle. From\nthat point on the Russians had to go back to Russia, stay in Russia and they, because I was a\nPolish born person, they took me to different places of work, camp. They called\nit . That was work, it was an army sort of, out of civilians that were not labor, that\nwere not taken to the Russian army because we were Polish citizens and they only took us from\none camp to another camp and they shipped us to places of work like farms where they needed\nworkers and all kind of different places, from one place to the other. The last place that I was,\nbecause I can\u2019t go into that certain. I have to skip over that.",
        "A: I was all over the place and they worked me very hard. The last place we were was Danscoya.\nIn Danscoya I was with my uncle. He decided to volunteer to the army and he escaped from\nthat particular town into the recruiting place of the Russian army. He wanted to volunteer to\nfight the Germans and anybody that volunteered over there to the Russian army they took,\n\u2018cause they needed people to fight, and he was accepted. He left me behind in this particular\nplace, this was Khazikstan and not far from , the place was called\nDanscoya .The place was a place where they were digging ore mines and also had\npolitical prisoners. It was 200 kilometers from . It was very hard to escape from\nthere because the wilderness was all around the place of Danscoya. You couldn\u2019t escape. Even\nthe prisoners couldn\u2019t escape. It was 200 kilometers to walk in the wilderness some wolf or\nthey had wild animals on the road, they would eat you up. So nobody could escape from that\nplace and this is the last place I was. When the war ended I tried to sign up as a Polish citizen\nto go back to Poland. I had to provide certain documents, which I didn\u2019t have under the name\nof Grisaurus. I showed a picture with epaulets that I kept... That particular picture I didn\u2019t\ndestroy because there was nothing written, but was only written something in Polish with a\nstamp on the corner from the school that I went to in Poland in Rovno. And that particular\npicture I kept with me. I still have it today, a copy of it in my album and because of the\nepaulets, it was from a Zionist organization, so we had those in Poland and the corner of it was\nwritten in Polish from a Polish school. It wasn\u2019t written Rovno because that part of Rovno was\nnot on the picture, like a corner of the picture was showing but it was written in Polish so they\ncould read it. They accepted me as a Polish citizen only because of that picture and I was able\nto get documents to get out of Russia under this picture, under this document. That\u2019s how I\ncame back to Poland where I met my first anti-Semites near Krakow.",
        "A: Yes I have applications with the Red Cross who are looking into it now. It will probably take a\nyear, but I don\u2019t believe they will ever find it. My father would be today, if he was alive, he\nwould have been 92 years old and my mother would have been 90. My younger brothers\nrecently. My younger brothers I can\u2019t find them, but I\u2019m looking for them for the last fifty\nyears. I have documents over here that I wrote every place you could think of to look for my\nfamily. I was under the impression because of the information that I got from that friend of\nmine in Harkov that told me that he met my father, that maybe they are alive in Russia\nsomeplace. And I did everything. I wrote to Moscow, I wrote to HIAS, I wrote to Yad Vashem\nin Israel, any organization that is available, private organizations, that are searching for people\nand I never was able to get any information whether they are alive or dead. I was under the\nimpression for many years that they are alive. I was hoping, and even today I still hope, that\nmaybe they are alive. But I have doubt. Just recently the last year I gave up and I decided, no,\nthey are not alive. I went to see the graves three and a half years ago to the city where I was\nborn, Rovno. I took my wife and my daughter, who was born in the United States, and we went\nthere for a visit to the place where 17,500 Jews of that city was shot, murdered by the Germans\nwith the help of the Ukrainian police over there in the place of Susneke, the woods, which I\nknew before the war very well and they were all shot. They assembled all the Jews, most of the\nJews, and they were shot there between November 6 and 7, 1941, right after the Germans\noccupied the city. A few months later they destroyed all the Jews. Whatever was left later on,\nthey had another 5,000 Jews and they kept them in ghettos and they were killed also. And\nanother place, which was called Bially Street, I visited that particular place. I am under the\nimpression that my whole family was killed over there and the information I got was false.",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe it. Because I did all the years, I did all I could to look for them and I can\u2019t find\nanybody.",
        "A: The monument, I put in my family\u2019s name on the monument down there now, because in 1990,\nthe end of October 1990, I visited Rovno again to the opening of a big monument that the\nRussian government put up in place where the Jews were killed. Because up till now there was\nno mention that Jews were killed over there. Only sort of Russian citizens. But now they have\na big tremendous monument with plates all around that particular monument. I have a picture\nof it, Pll show you a picture of that particular spot, it\u2019s tremendous, it\u2019s very big. Seventy plates\nwith 4,000 names of people that sort of got killed in this place are written. And I also registered\nmy family there.",
        "A: The names I didn\u2019t see, I only know that after we left Rovno in 1990 where I visited, the plates\nwere written. The other writing was in Yiddish, Hebrew and Ukrainian on the monument for\nthe first time in Russia that they allowed things written in Yiddish in places like that. Because\nthe other towns, every town in the Ukraine has a massacre place has one, Ludsk has\none, Kiev, Kovid has one has one. All these towns, every town there was a\nmassacre place where they killed the Jews. At that time they didn\u2019t think of sending them to\nconcentration camps. Therefore I don\u2019t believe Pll get any knowledge from, any information\nfrom , Germany because they did not take names of the people that they were killing\nin the towns. They just surrounded them, they told them to come and they just killed them. The\ninformation that I got from Rovno where I met people, Jewish people are still living in Rovno,\nthey told me the whole story of what happened and how it happened. I met a woman in Rovno\nthat survived, which I have on video. She survived the graves, she crawled out of the graves\nbecause that night she was not hit by bullet. She survived and crawled out nude and she ran to a\nChristian, a Ukrainian or Polish I don\u2019t remember what she said, and they kept her and helped\nher to get dress and wash and she 1s one of the survivors. I met her in Rovno, she is there today,\nshe is an older woman and she 1s one of the survivors.",
        "A: Down here in New York I have some people that knew my family. The people in Rovno that\nare there today did not know my family.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: That was the last time I saw them, yes. In 1941, I was probably--.",
        "A: Eighteen years old? Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Five years of my youth was just destroyed.",
        "A: Oh, yes. There is a picture in my mind at all times. It never leaves, that picture. I will never\nforget because I remember when I said goodbye, my father took me around and hugged me and\nkissed me. My mother was crying and she was practically, like sort of hysterical, like she\nwould know that I\u2019ll never see her again. When I left her, I tried to be like a grown person\nbecause I had tears in my eyes. At the time, the tears are coming back to me right now as I\u2019m\ntalking to you, I didn\u2019t want to show her that I\u2019m like sort of a sissy that I\u2019m crying and I didn\u2019t\nturn my head back.",
        "A: They were youngsters, they were kids and they didn\u2019t understand much.\nA I am working now with Holocaust Search for the same purpose. That I know so many people\nare looking for relatives and I don\u2019t think there 1s a better person than I am and dedicated more\nto that cause because I, myself, have the feeling and I know what it means to lose family and\nnot to be able to see them again.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome.\n"
