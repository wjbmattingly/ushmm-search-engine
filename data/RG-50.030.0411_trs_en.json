        "Q: And he died before you were born?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, in Some sense, you were treated at a certain point like the first born.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Were you spoiled?",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t spoiled. We had a very happy family life. We - I always remember singing\nand dancing at home. The parents were very good to us. They took a big part in our lives.\nThey cared a lot for us, and we were all, we were very happy then.",
        "Q: Do you remember the character of your father, what your father was like and what your\nrelationship was like? Were you very close with him?",
        "A: My father was an educated man. He was - he didn\u2019t mix into our lives, into the kids. My\nmother took complete charge of us. She was like our friend. She was always interested in\nevery aspect of our lives, and we responded to her that way.",
        "Q: And was your father sort of a distant father?",
        "A: He wasn\u2019t a distant father, but he didn\u2019t mix into our upbringing.",
        "Q: So, did you have private time with your father or primarily private time with your\nmother?",
        "A: Rather with my mother.",
        "Q: And, since you were the eldest child, what was your relationship with your two younger\nsisters? One was two years younger then you and the other is, what, five years younger?",
        "A: Yes, five.",
        "Q: So, were you close with them?",
        "A: Well, I was close with them, but they say, I don\u2019t remember this, but they say I was\nbossy.",
        "Q: You were bossy?",
        "A: That I was bossing them around, but we loved each other. We were always - we never\nhad any fights unless it\u2019s true what they say that I was bossing them around.",
        "Q: Do you remember - Chris said that you had - you all had to have collars for school?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Clean collars?",
        "A: Clean collars.",
        "Q: So, they had to be washed and then sewn on every day, right?",
        "A: Yes, but that was when I was at school in Radom. I had a girlfriend, and since I was good\nat writing essays and stuff like that, I was writing her essays and she was washing my\ncollars for me, and attaching them to whatever I wore.",
        "Q: Now, Chris remembers you asking her to do that for her before.",
        "A: That\u2019s very possible. I don\u2019t remember, but it\u2019s possible. Her things were always neatly\nhung up in the closet. I remember, we had a shelf together. My mother divided it, and she\nsays, \u201cYou will have one side, and Chris will have the other side.\u201d Hers was always\nneatly put together, and mine was a mish-mash. So, I remember my mother says, \u201cWhy\ncan\u2019t you keep it like your sister?\u201d I said, \u201cShe has a better side.\u201d So, Krysia says, \u201cOkay,\nI'll give you my side.\u201d And soon enough, this side was all neatly put together and mine\nwas all messy.",
        "Q: [Laughs.] What did you like to study? Did you like studying?",
        "A: I was a very good student. My mother - my mother calls me a genius, and I believed her.\n[Laughs. |",
        "Q: Well, your sisters call you a genius too, you know?",
        "A: That\u2019s - my mother was very proud of me because I was very well brought up, like I had\nvery nice manners and since I was a little assimilated and I had a lot of Polish girlfriends,\nusually the Polish parents did not like the Datastrassas (ph), the Jews, but since I was so\nwell brought up and polite at all time, and I was helping them with school, I was always\nwelcome to their homes, and to me, at that time, it was very important.",
        "Q: Why was it so important?",
        "A: It was important because I wanted to be one of them, because I felt so persecuted as a\nJew that I felt that - I just wanted - at that time, when I was a kid - don\u2019t forget, that that\nwas at the time when I was nine, eight, ten, you know - I wanted to be one of them at that\ntime.",
        "Q: So, explain how to me persecuted as a Jew? What was it like for you as a Jewish child?",
        "A: Actually, I felt it because I noticed that we had - in our town, there was a lot of religious\nJews. Most of the Jewish people that lived in Wierzbnik were religious, and I always saw\nPolacks, throwing stones at them, talking to them in a way that it was ridiculing them,\nand so - I, personally, since I was just a child at the time, I didn\u2019t feel it, and being with\nthe Polish girls, you know, associating with them, I didn\u2019t feel it, but I saw it on the\noutside, and that\u2019s why maybe I wanted to be one of them.",
        "Q: Did you yourself feel uncomfortable with the very Orthodox Jews?",
        "A: To a point, because they - they couldn\u2019t speak Polish. I mean, they spoke Polish with an\naccent. They spoke mostly, among themselves, they spoke Yiddish, and being so very\nreligious, they had a certain mannerism that distinguished them for the other people.\nThey were dressed differently. They acted differently. They spoke differently. So, but I\nidentified with them, but sometimes I felt a little bit uncomfortable with them.",
        "Q: Do you remember what the population of Starachowice was?",
        "A: Yes, it was - Wierzbnik-Starachowice were like twin cities, if you can call that that. That\ntotal population was 35,000, and ten percent of it were Jewish people like between 3,200\nto 3,500. And, most of them lived in Wierzbnik; some Poles lived in Wierzbnik, too.\nStarachowice was mostly - in Starachowice, there were mostly - not mostly, I would say\nalmost 95 percent Poles. They worked there because we had the munition factory there.\nThey worked there and they lived there. Some of them lived in Wierzbnik, too, but all\nJews lived in Wierzbnik.",
        "Q: You left?",
        "A: I left. My mother sent me to school in Radom when I was eleven years old.",
        "Q: Was that an ordinary thing? Why did that happen?",
        "A: No, because I was a good student and we had what they call Gymnasium, which was a\nhigh school in Starachowice, but it wasn\u2019t one of the best. In Radom, there was - there\nwas one of the best girls\u2019 school, but it was almost impossible to get in for the Jews. At\nfirst, we had numerus klausus (ph), which meant one Jewish girl for 45 students in a class\nwould be accepted, and then in the later years it was numerus nolus (ph), which means\nnone of the Jewish girls could be accepted. So, I was lucky. You have to pass a\ncompetitive exam, and you had to really be very, very good to be accepted. So, my\nmother tried - she sent me there and I passed the exam, and at the end of the year, she\nfound out that I was accepted. So, for her it was the biggest achievement that she could\never achieve at the time which - and I went to that school there and I lived on my own.\nLike, I had relatives, but my mother placed me in a - like she rented a room, with like\nthere were kids there my age. So, she rented a room with a family, and that\u2019s where I\nstayed.",
        "Q: Did that scare you to go away?",
        "A: At first it did. As a matter of fact, I cried for a long time before I went there, and when I\nfound myself there, I also felt a little bit strange, but soon I got used to it, and I got to\nknow all the people my age and a year older or a year younger, because they were several\nschools in Radom. It was a big city with 100,000 people there. They had several different\nschools. They even had a Jewish high school, called Pzhiachu Wierze (ph), which meant\n\u201cfriends of knowledge\u2019, if I were to translate it exactly. So, there were a lot of Jewish\nkids that were educated in Starachowice, Wierzbnik. The religious people didn\u2019t send the\ngirls to high school because of the fact that they had to go to school on Shabbat. You\nknow, because we had six days of school. So, the parents wouldn\u2019t let them do that. So,\nthey had a lot of other schools that were connected with the religious movement. But in\nRadom, the parents were a little bit - I mean, it was a bigger city, and there was a lot of\nyoung people that were going to those different schools, and the schools were much\nbetter than in Wierzbnik.",
        "Q: Was it kind of exciting to be in a much larger city?",
        "A: Well, once I got to know the people my age, I felt very good there. As a matter of fact,\nuntil today, I have a lot of friends from Radom. And, as a matter of fact, my husband\nmade a party for them all like at the cottage a year before he died. There was fifty of us.",
        "Q: Really. And, what were your favorite subjects?",
        "A: At the time, languages and mathematics.",
        "Q: Mathematics?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did that come from your father since he was an engineer?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s true. [Laughs.] It was -talking about home, when he counted, he counted in\nGerman, because he was educated in German. I count - no matter what language I speak -\nif I have to count, I count in Polish. My husband, no matter what language he spoke, he\nwould count in Yiddish. And since you are talking about languages....",
        "Q: How do you account for that?",
        "A: I think you - like I was used to speaking - we spoke Polish at home. So, I was used to\nspeaking Polish all the time, and because I suppose that I got used to counting. I think it\u2019s\nvery normal.",
        "Q: Did you write home a great deal?",
        "A: Well, I did write home. Every week my mother would send me home-baking and stuff\nlike that, a parcel, and then, whoever would travel to Radom, she would send something\nfor me. So, when this person came I wrote a letter to my parents. We didn\u2019t have a\ntelephone at all.",
        "Q: Did you write to your sisters? Or does the one letter count?",
        "A: One letter.",
        "Q: Did they write to you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No, because we were, you know, for every holy day, I went home. As a matter of fact, the\nmonth of September, since Radom was about sixty kilometers away from Wierzbnik, it\nwas a two hour ride on the train because I had to change trains half way. So, at the\nbeginning, I didn\u2019t want to go back to Radom because when I was at home it felt so good\nto be at home. So, the first month, I was traveling every day to Radom and back.",
        "Q: Every day?",
        "A: Every day to get home. But then, then later when the days became shorter, I stayed there.\nBut I had a very, very good life in Radom because, as a say, I had lots of friends there.",
        "Q: Do you remember the Paliszewskis?",
        "A: Yes, I remember them very well.",
        "Q: Were you close to them also?",
        "A: Very close. Those were the Polish friends of my parents, and we were very close. The\nfather was - I mean, we called him a doctor. He didn\u2019t have an education, but he, I mean,\nmaybe he wasn\u2019t a doctor really, but he was acting as a doctor. And there were four\ndaughters there and they opened, how should I say, a school. Since the age of two or so,\nwe went to that school. It was like a - I don\u2019t know whether to call it a kindergarten or\nwhatever. And they taught us - they taught us to such a degree that when I went to public\nschool, the transferred me immediately the first day because I could read and write\nalready, and then I skipped again, because they were very good teachers and they were\nvery good friends of our parents. We went there for Christmas and I enjoyed so much\nseeing the Christmas tree and she had home baked cookies on the tree. We really liked it,\nand they were very, very good friends of our parents. As a matter of fact, they kept\ncertain things for us, like valuables and they - and this was the only family that returned\nour valuables after the war because I also had - we also had friends, they were also\nteachers, that we left some clothes and stuff like this, and when we came back, they\nwouldn\u2019t give us anything. Not only that they wouldn\u2019t give us anything, but they said,\n\u201cIf you are need, go to the Jewish congress.\u201d So, the Paliszewskis were very, very\nexceptional.",
        "Q: So, in your experience with Polish Catholics, that\u2019s an unusual experience, the\nPaliszewskis, the way they were with you?",
        "A: Very unusual, but they weren\u2019t - maybe they were, but I thought they came from the\nRussian side so maybe they were, whatever...",
        "Q: Greek Orthodox?",
        "A: Greek Orthodox, I\u2019m not sure, maybe not, but Christmas was Christmas, so maybe they\nweren\u2019t, but they spoke with a Russian accent. They weren\u2019t born in Wierzbnik; they\ncame from the Russian side.",
        "Q: Were there other Polish Catholic friends that you had, that you were that close with or\nnot?",
        "A: I had a girlfriend, the doctor\u2019s daughter. Her name was Helena Lambaska. She had, her\nparents were - in addition that he was a doctor, he was also such a Polish aristocrat, and I\nremember them. She was a very good friend of mine right through school, right through\nthe public school and then in Radom, as well. And I remember when she came to us, she\nrode a horse and I was envious, but I was afraid of the horse.",
        "Q: So, you never got on the horse?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, did she ever ask you to try?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember your dog?",
        "A: Dog, yes, I think we had a dog called \u201cLady\u201d, but I was mostly, at this time I was away\nfrom home, but I remember it being there.",
        "Q: So, you left to go to Radom in \u00b033 or \u201934?",
        "A: No, \u00b035.",
        "Q: \u00b035, so you were twelve? No, you were eleven.",
        "A: Eleven.",
        "Q: You were eleven.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, even though you\u2019re still a kid, do you begin to hear things about what\u2019s happening in\nGermany, or is that not very conscious yet?",
        "A: Not conscious until - as a matter of fact, I had no idea. I mean, first of all, we knew what\nwas happening in Germany, but we - I, myself, believed that Poland is so strong that we\nare not going to be afraid of the Germans. What should I say? I really believed that\nPoland was one of the, how should I say it, the strongest countries in Europe.",
        "Q: So, you had no idea what sort of an army they really had.",
        "A: No idea.",
        "Q: So, you had no fear?",
        "A: No fear.",
        "Q: None. But, you were conscious in some way about what was happening in Germany?",
        "A: I was conscious, but I didn\u2019t believe it. Like, my father, who was educated in Germany -\nnot in Germany, in Austria, I think, but he said the German people are so good, that\nnothing - I mean, not to worry about it. That, you know, like, that\u2019s what he believed\nbecause he himself was brought up in a different atmosphere at the time.",
        "Q: So, a couple of years later, in \u201937-\u201938, before the war begins and there are German Jews\nwhose ancestors came from Poland, who are sent back to Poland and come into the area\nof Starachowice, right?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So, do you see these people when you come back on vacation? Do you notice that there\nare these German Jews who have been sent away?",
        "A: But, there weren\u2019t too many yet in Wierzbnik or Starachowice, but they might have gone\nto other cities. I don\u2019t remember any German people. Mind you, when I came home, my\nmother used to send me to different aunts on vacation, and they all - since I was used not\nto being at home and my mother felt that my sisters had it better because they were at\nhome and I was away., so when I came home she would send me to a relative for the\nvacation in another part of Poland. So, I really was very little in Wierzbnik.",
        "Q: Tell me - I want to go back a little bit. Tell me about your grandma. You all seem to have\nhad an extremely close relationship.",
        "A: Very close relationship. She lived about - I don\u2019t remember. It would be about 20 or 30\nkilometers from Wierzbnik. The place was called Ostrowiec. We had three aunts and a\ngrandmother that we were very close with them. The aunts were very nice women. They\nwere running my grandmother\u2019s business, and the youngest one was going to university,\nand she finished pharmacy. We were very close with this grandmother. I was going there\nvery often, and I developed like a friendship with many kids my age there, and I like to\ngo to Ostrowiec, and my grandma liked us to come to visit her all the time. She was a\nvery - she really loved us.",
        "Q: Did she teach you about Jewish prayers?",
        "A: Yes, she was very religious, extremely religious. My grandfather was - I would say, he\nwas wearing the clothes that the religious Jews wore. And I remember that on her stove,\nshe had a wooden kind of a board that would divide the milk dishes, if she cooked milk\ndishes, and the other dishes on the same stove. She had this board so the vapor shouldn\u2019t\nmix with the other. My mother was Kosher, because otherwise my grandmother would\nnever eat when she would come to the house. But we were more traditional and my\nmother and father were very much involved in the Zionist movement. So, they were\nworking for Israel all the time.",
        "Q: You may not remember this or even know this. Was your mother in conflict with her\nmother because she wasn\u2019t as religious?",
        "A: Never, no. As a matter of fact, she was very much loved by her mother and grandfather, I\nwas told. The grandfather was so religious, and his sons - I don\u2019t know whether Renta\ntold you that his sons turned to be Communist. They had to run away because the\ngrandfather wouldn\u2019t accept them. Then he sat Shiva after them because he was so\nreligious and they were Communists. So, how could that be reconciled? But my mother,\nregardless of what she was, she was very much loved by her family.",
        "Q: So, was it odd for you to learn this much about - did she expect that you would become\nreligious? Was that her hope?",
        "A: My mother?",
        "Q: No, your grandma.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: She just wanted you to know?",
        "A: Yes, right, and as far as my mother is concerned, I remember she brought in a teacher and\nshe opened - because the Zionists had an organization, we had a room there - so, my\nmother was instrumental in bringing a Hebrew teacher. He lived in our house at first. He\nwas like, you know, they couldn\u2019t pay him much, and she opened the Tarbut school, and\nwe were learning the modern Hebrew.",
        "Q: So, your mother opened the Tarbut school?",
        "A: My mother opened it.",
        "Q: And there were a lot of children who went?",
        "A: I would say there was about twenty percent of families that weren\u2019t orthodox, so they\nwould send the kids there.",
        "Q: Because, of course, the orthodox would not go.",
        "A: No, they had their own school called Bysiarkev (ph) for the girls, and for the boys they\nwere studying at the schribus (ph) and the synagogue - the religious ones.",
        "Q: I think we may be close to the end of the tape, but I\u2019m not exactly sure. Four minutes,\nokay. Did you graduate from high school before the war began?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: How many years was high school?",
        "A: High school and lyc\u00e9e, we had both. Like before the war, I finished four years of high\nschool, and after the war, I went back to high school, and then I went to university in\nPoland, what they call Cultural Diplomatic school.",
        "Q: So, as you\u2019re going to high school, so between \u201935 and September of \u00b039, right, do you\nfeel things getting difficult, or are you still believing, \u201cGermany\u2019s not going to do\nanything.\u201d",
        "A: No, Germany will not do anything. I still believed it, because at school they let us believe\nthat Poland is very strong.",
        "Q: So, you don\u2019t live with any fear.",
        "A: No fear.",
        "Q: So, war must have come as a complete shock to you.",
        "A: Complete shock to us and when we had to run away from home because they were\nbombing the factories in Starachowice, and we had to run away to different villages to\njust not be - but, Poland was taken in a few days. So, soon after the Germans came in - I\nwasn\u2019t afraid of them at the beginning - but soon I learned that we have to be afraid of\nthem.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s stop the tape and change it please.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Hania, what happened when the war began? You were in Radom at school.",
        "A: No, I was at home. I came home for the vacation in June, and I stayed at home, and the\nwar broke out on September the 1\u201c. As I said, we had to run away. We ran away to\nwhatever close village. We stayed with some farmers, and when Poland was taken by the\nGermans, which was in a few days, we were sent home.",
        "Q: Was that a very frightening experience the evacuation?",
        "A: It was very frightening because we did - war was something strange to us. We didn\u2019t\nknow what war means, but we when we heard the bombs flying and when we heard that\npeople got killed, we got scared. But when we returned home and the Germans came in,\nthey walked with dogs. We were afraid of them, and we were told like when we were\nwalking on the same sidewalk, we had to go off the sidewalk when the Germans were\nwalking through. So, at first we laughed that they are so proud, they are so stupid, but\nthen later we started getting scared.",
        "Q: Do you happen to remember the first night you came back after you had been evacuated\nand you had a very formal kind of dinner, that your father wanted there to be a tablecloth\non the table? Do you remember that?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: So, what is your first memory after you come back from the bombardment? What is the\nclearest memory that you have of how life changes for you?",
        "A: That we were afraid, but my father assured us that the soldiers and the government is bad,\nbut the German people are straightforward, good people, that not to be afraid of the\ncivilians, just the soldiers. But they were like, there were soldiers all over, only soldiers. I\nwas afraid of them, but we just stayed away from them as much as we could. So, we\ndidn\u2019t pay very much attention to them. Like, we did, but when we came home, at first,\nlike in 1939, there were things happening, but not - we weren\u2019t really afraid. I wasn\u2019t, at\nleast.",
        "Q: Do you remember whether your sisters were afraid? Do you remember talking with\nthem?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember this part of my life really that much.",
        "Q: Let me ask you this: you move about three times.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Between the first evacuation, when you come back to your apartment, until the ghetto is\nclosed.",
        "A: Yes, first they moved - we lived on the main street, so, first of all, we were moved away\nfrom the main streets, and the ghetto was a little bit bigger, and then they squeezed us.\nWe had to move because the place where we were, they moved us again a little bit closer\nto the original ghetto. So, we moved three times. I remember all those.",
        "Q: You remember all those moves?",
        "A: Moves, yes.",
        "Q: Now, was that - what did you think when that was happening? Do you know how...?",
        "A: You know, like, when I think of it now, I didn\u2019t have any idea that it\u2019s going - that it\ncould be so bad. Like, we didn\u2019t really - we didn\u2019t know what was going on around us,\nlike in Warsaw. We heard it, but we didn\u2019t want to believe it, to believe in it. But we\nwere more scared then than at the beginning, because at the beginning we lived a little bit\nmore normal, but now we had to watch every move that we made because we\u2019re not\nallowed to get out of the ghetto. We were wearing those - we wearing the armband with\nthe Jewish star in it, and if they catch you outside of the ghetto, they would kill you. I\nheard that. I had a case where I was very foolish. I had a boyfriend at the time who lived\nin Busko Zdro}. It was - but that was around \u201941 already, and the parents invited me to\ncome there, and Jews weren\u2019t allowed to travel. So, they had hotels there. It was a place\nlike where they had cures for arthritis and they owned hotels there. The Germans took\naway their hotels, but they worked there as workers. So, they send me a work order that I\nwas supposed to work in the hotel. That was just - it was just for the purpose of me being\nable to go, to travel. So, I remember I went to Kielce, which was a place where the train\nstopped, and like when I say stopped, the train line stopped and there were buses going to\nBusko, and I couldn\u2019t get on this train. I couldn\u2019t get on the bus because they sent the\nJews to the very end, and I was wearing this band, and the Jews to the very end. So, I was\nwaiting the whole day there, and all the time, the Jews to the very end, I had to stay in\nline. So, I decided - I didn\u2019t have any fear at the time - I decided to just hitchhike to\nBusko, because I figured I couldn\u2019t do anything else. So, what did I do? I took off my\nband, put it in my purse, and then I stood on the corner and a car stopped and it was a\nguy, a German-speaking guy. He asked me if I would like a lift, and I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I said, \u201cTo Busko.\u201d So, he says, \u201cGet in.\u201d So, I get in, and\nhe started speaking to me. He asked me - I didn\u2019t know who he was. I had no idea. It was\na German. I was scared to death. That\u2019s the first time I was scared, but I was already\nsitting there. So, he started asking me where am I going. I said, \u201cI go there.\u201d He said,\n\u201cFor what?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a job there.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d So, of course, I gave a\nPolish name because I was afraid Laks was a Jewish name. I couldn\u2019t say that my name is\nso and so. So, anyway, what he was, he was like a troihinder (ph) of the Jewish\nbusinesses. What it meant - the Germans took away the Jewish businesses, and he was\nlike - he was checking on all those businesses, and among others, he was checking on this\nfamily that I was going to. So, I told him that I\u2019m going to work there, and that was okay.\nSo, he stopped in a place called Miernic (ph) because he had some business to do there.\nSo, he asked me to sit in the car and he would take me because he was going to Busko.\nSo, a Polish guy - in each city they had a Polish supervisor, in each town and city like on\nhis way because he was the main one. He was in charge of it, but the Polacks were\nsupervising those Jewish businesses. The Polack recognized me that I was Jewish. He\nrecognized me. He didn\u2019t tell me anything, although I spoke Polish perfectly, and I\nthought I didn\u2019t look Jewish. He recognized that I was Jewish. So, when the guy came\nback, I noticed that he went and he told him, and this fellow - he was so nice to me all the\nway - he came and he says, \u201cBist du eiben?\u201d So, I said, \u201cYah.\u201d So, he screamed - do you\nunderstand what that means, \u201cBist du eiben.\u201d - \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d So, I said, \u201cYes.\u201d So,\nhe said, \u201cWo hast du die Armband?\u201d That means, \u201cWhere is your band?\u201d So, I was stupid\n- at that time I was crystal clear like as far, I was so idealistic. I never lied, and I was so\nwell brought up. So, I took my purse, and I took it out and showed it to him. He took me\nby the collar, threw my out, threw my suitcase. The suitcase fell apart, and he took - it\u2019s a\ngood thing he didn\u2019t kill me because he could have. He was so embarrassed, you know,\nin front of the Polack, the Polish supervisor that he didn\u2019t know what to do. So, he ran to\nthe car so fast, and then the Polish guy comes to me and says, \u201cDo you have anywhere to\ngo in Miernic?\u201d So, I said to him, \u201cAs a matter of fact I do. I know a doctor here, and his\nname is Dr. Reichman.\u201d And I remember and he says, \u201cI can take you.\u201d So, he carried my\nsuitcase. He carried my suitcase to Dr. Reichman there. He wasn\u2019t even embarrassed. He\ncaused all the trouble, because otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have had any trouble. I\u2019m telling you\nonly how - not only that I was idealistic, but I was so naive, and I\u2019Il tell you, stupid to a\ncertain point because, I mean, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I just took a...hitchhiked. So, I\ndon\u2019t know what I was referring to when I told you the story when you asked me.",
        "Q: It\u2019s every interesting. First of all, the Germans could not recognize who was Jewish and\nwho was not; only the Poles could.",
        "A: The Poles could, and I never - believe me, by accident, I don\u2019t know how he knew that I\nwas Jewish, and then I had to call my boyfriend from this doctor\u2019s place, that I\u2019m here\nand he worked for the Germans as a chauffer at the time. He was a medical student, but\nhe was working for the Germans as a chauffer, so the German - his boss of him came to\npick me up, and then from that time on, I was just sitting there. I was afraid that, because\nhe knew what I was, I thought he would come and kill me. But, that\u2019s how I trusted\npeople.",
        "Q: Did this Polish guy tell you why he told the German guy?",
        "A: I never told him. I never asked him, but I thought that it was - like, 1t was almost cruel\nbecause, I mean, the Germans, they all carried guns with them, and if he could kill me,\nnobody would ask questions.",
        "Q: Were you surprised that the German guy didn\u2019t ask for your identification, because all of\nyou had to carry identification?",
        "A: No, we did, and I did, and I had a letter where I\u2019m going to work. I wasn\u2019t going to work,\nas I told you, and he never asked me. I\u2019 Il tell you, whenever I\u2019m late from that time on,\nwhenever I met a German, I pretended that I don\u2019t understand German. I thought that was\nthe best - that was the best, if I couldn\u2019t - if I don\u2019t understand. I always said, \u201cNo.\u201d",
        "Q: Why? Why did you think that was the best way?",
        "A: Because I figured that if speak German well, he will ask me more questions. This way\nthey won\u2019t ask any questions.",
        "Q: And you being so honest.",
        "A: I was so straightforward, my father used to that he didn\u2019t like it.",
        "Q: So, did you go to work at this place?",
        "A: No, I never.",
        "Q: You never got there.",
        "A: No, I did get there, but this letter and the request for work was only for me to be able to\ntravel, because otherwise I couldn\u2019t get out, being Jewish, I couldn\u2019t get out of the ghetto.\nBut if I got a permit to work somewhere, I was allowed to - of course, I had to wear my\nband - but I did wear my band until I couldn\u2019t get on the bus, and if I stayed in Kielce,\nthere was no place I could go anywhere, and I wasn\u2019t sure whether the next bus will take\nme.",
        "Q: And, the armband that you wore was white?",
        "A: White with the Jewish star, but at the time, when I went hitchhiking, I didn\u2019t wear the\nband.",
        "Q: What made...? You weren\u2019t afraid to take it off?",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t afraid because I knew that I looked Polish. I have no accent that would nobody\nwould recognize me. I was told so many times in my lifetime that I don\u2019t look Jewish that\nI believed it. I just told him a false name. Like, he asked me what my name was, so, I told\nhim Lisowska, or whatever was a Polish name, the first name that came to my mind.",
        "Q: Did you speak German with him, this guy?",
        "A: I spoke German with him, like, to a point, but I did speak German because he didn\u2019t\nspeak Polish.",
        "Q: He was really embarrassed because he didn\u2019t figure it out.",
        "A: If you knew how he screamed at me when he threw me out of this car. He just took me by\nmy collar and just threw me. He was so embarrassed. He wouldn\u2019t have done that if the\nPolack wouldn\u2019t look at it. I don\u2019t think so. Maybe I\u2019m wrong.",
        "Q: When did you start dating?",
        "A: I was, like, shortly before the war, when I was fifteen.",
        "Q: Yeah, was that sort of a typical time for young girls?",
        "A: Yeah, but when you say dating, it wasn\u2019t dating. We went in groups. We never went one\nby one. Like, we met - we were going to movies together. So, there was a whole group of\nboys and girls, and of course, I had my favorite, or he had his favorite, but we were going\nalways together, not by ourselves.",
        "Q: And did you like going to the movies?",
        "A: Yeah, I loved it.",
        "Q: Any particular favorites?",
        "A: The old movies, Jeannette MacDonald and all those, the musicals. It was really like -\nevery student was going at least once a week to the movies, at least once a week.",
        "Q: These were American movies that you saw?",
        "A: American movies, yeah, we didn\u2019t have any others.",
        "Q: I think it sort of surprises people to think about people going to those movies.",
        "A: Yeah, but we had subtitles.",
        "Q: In Polish?",
        "A: In Polish",
        "Q: So, Jeanette MacDonald singing.",
        "A: Singing with - that was one of my most favorite movies. Her movies were - and Shirley\nTemple, of course, at the time, because she was so cute.",
        "Q: Did they show you dramatic movies as well and mysteries or was it mainly the musicals\nthat came over?",
        "A: No, there were different movies. As a matter of fact at that time, we were collecting the\nmovie stars photos and we were exchanging them. This was like a treasure. We were\nbuying all those photos and putting them into an album, and then if - because they were\nquite expensive those photos - so if you had some doubles or if you didn\u2019t like some, you\ncould always exchange it with someone else because everybody had an album and\nphotos.",
        "Q: Was this boys and girls?",
        "A: Yeah, both.",
        "Q: Both, and where would you buy - how would they selling them?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, really I don\u2019t remember. We often, when we get together, we often\ntalk about the, the albums that we had.",
        "Q: Because when I was a kid, people used to buy them, and they were in candy or bubble\ngum or something.",
        "A: I had no idea where we got them, but we had to buy them like...",
        "Q: I understand that, once there was no schooling for Jewish kids, that you became a teacher\nin your house.",
        "A: Oh, that was during the war.",
        "Q: Right, that\u2019s what I mean.",
        "A: That was during - school\u2019s finished for us. The war finished, like, we were not allowed to\ngo to any schools. So, there was nothing else to do, and the people thought that I was\nintelligent, that I was smart, that I was going to Radom to school. It was a myth really.\nSo, the parents started coming and asking whether I could give them lessons. So, I had\ntwo sisters. So, I figured I\u2019Il open this - 1t wasn\u2019t a school - whoever wanted to come,\nlike, people that were more or less on that level, on Renia\u2019s level I had a few, and on\nChris\u2019s level I had a few, and Chris was teaching. She was also teaching, but she was\nteaching younger kids, and I was good at school because when I was in Radom, I had a\nFrench teacher who just, I don\u2019t know, she liked me, loved me. So, when people had\nproblems with the French language - and I learned very fast - so when people had\ntroubles, she says, she made me a tutor. So, right from the beginning almost. And, if I\nwas their tutor, they passed. No, but most likely, I could do it. So, you know, I had a little\nbit of experience from Radom. So, when I came home during the war, my pupils were\nvery happy with me. Some of them were until today - as a matter of fact, I went now to\nthe Wierzbnik Society meeting and I met two of my pupils. They kissed me and went,\n\u201cMy lovely teacher.\u201d And I was not very much older than them.",
        "Q: That\u2019s true. You were fifteen, sixteen years old at this time.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s true.",
        "Q: Do you remember how you treated Renia?",
        "A: Pll tell you. I think that I treated them well. I thought that, but I was very strict with my\npupils, and especially strict with Renia. Renia says that I was sometimes I\u2019d give her a\nsmack. I don\u2019t remember it. Renia must tell you. As a matter of fact, one day, Renia, like,\nwhen we arrived here, we got together the three of us, and Renia says that she remembers\nthat I gave, you know, I smacked her a few times. So, I said, and I started crying because\nI didn\u2019t remember. I said, \u201cWhy would I do it?\u201d So, she wanted to be nice to me, and on\nthe way home they came back out. She stopped somewhere. She called me. She said,\n\u201cYou know what? I remind myself that I gave it back to you.\u201d She wanted me to feel\nbetter. She didn\u2019t, but I don\u2019t remember it. Maybe it\u2019s true, but I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Was this good for you to be able to teach them, to have that time?",
        "A: I was very, you know, like I was really happy to be a teacher because I noticed that the\nkids - those kids looked at me with such admiration. So, I really enjoyed it, and I know\nthat Renia\u2019s friend - the one in Israel - whenever she talks to me on the phone, she recites\nall the poems, even the Latin poems, that I made them memorize. I myself remember it.\nAs a matter of fact, when I was in the university in Toronto after the war, after I came to\nCanada, and on my first - I took - the first course I took was French. So, I remember all\nthe French Canadians, they speak perfect French. I wasn\u2019t - my French was only from\nschool, so I couldn\u2019t speak so fluently, but I remember grammar and everything much\nbetter, and one day the teacher comes when we were taking La Fontaine, that\u2019s a French\npoet, and he says, \u201cDoes any of you remember any poems?\u201d And, remember that this is\nyears and years after; that was when I was already Canada and we came here in 1948, and\nI didn\u2019t go to school until 1970. So, that was in 1970. So, I said to him, \u201cI remember\nMaitre Corbeau,, but I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019d remember it all.\u201d So, he said, \u201cWould you\nlike to try it?\u201d So, I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d So, I closed my eyes like this and I started and I\nremembered the whole poem. So, after I finished, the whole class stood up and clapped,\nand I was so proud that I remembered, because, you know, it\u2019s how many years from\n1939 to 1970?",
        "Q: Let me go back a few years, because I was recalling that Chris said that, prior to you\u2019re\ngoing to Radom to high school, you would bring home friends and you would sit around\nand you would talk about books, and Renia said she also was listening, but she was sort\nof listening, and Chris said you wouldn\u2019t let them be part of the group because they were\nchildren. Do you have any recollection of your friends coming into the house and talking\nabout books?",
        "A: I had a lot of friends. I always had a lot of friends, but you know, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay. What do you remember about your parents during this period, \u201939 to \u201941, when\nthings are beginning to get tougher, but they\u2019re not quite as bad as they become? Is your\nfather working? He\u2019s lost his job, I gather.",
        "A: Yeah, he lost his job. First of all, he lost his job because he was assessing the forests and\nstuff like that for the government. In 1933, he lost the job and he lost his pensions.",
        "Q: \u00b033 or \u00b037?",
        "A: No, he lost his - the government job in \u201933, and then he started working in the same\ncapacity for private enterprise, which wasn\u2019t the same, and the reason why they let him\ngo because they didn\u2019t want to pay his pension, or because he was Jewish, they didn\u2019t\nwant to pay his pension. So, my parents went - they struggled but we lived normally like\nany other, because the Jewish people - the Jewish population, especially the religious\nones, they were tradesmen, small businessmen. They were all poor, like, they weren\u2019t\nrich people. So, although we were quite - we lived quite modestly, we weren\u2019t any\ndifferent than any other people. I remember, my mother learned a trade but it was, you\nknow, I don\u2019t really remember exactly what - my father was also selling something. I\ncouldn\u2019t tell you really exactly what they did during the war.",
        "Q: So, if you would...",
        "A: Riches wasn\u2019t important then.",
        "Q: But, you did have a maid.",
        "A: Yes, we did.",
        "Q: And a seamstress and a laundress, I believe, before the war.",
        "A: Yeah, they were coming once a month. It wasn\u2019t that they were there all the time. We\ndidn\u2019t have a maid continuously. We did - there were two sisters where we lived that they\nwere doing this kind of work. So, like, to wash the laundry, I don\u2019t know if they were\ncoming once a month or every two weeks. I couldn\u2019t tell you. I don\u2019t really remember,\nbecause during the war, during ghetto we didn\u2019t have any help any more and Renia and\nKrysia would remember more of what we had right before the war because they were at\nhome.",
        "Q: So, one wouldn\u2019t have to be wealthy to bring in some people?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So, if you would describe...",
        "A: But, my parents were both educated. So, that was the difference between them and - I\nmean, there were a few others that were like my parents, but most of the people were\nreligious, educated only - that\u2019s all they knew: how to pray and how to... You know, that\nwas the type - that\u2019s the type of people that lived in our town.",
        "Q: When is the ghetto formed, in your view? I can\u2019t quite understand because it doesn\u2019t\nbecome a closed ghetto.",
        "A: No, at first - I would think that was \u201941, maybe \u201940 - when they moved us from our first\nlocation to the second location, and they were closing on, but it wasn\u2019t closed. We were\nnot supposed to get out of the camp unless we had a work permit or whatever. That\u2019s how\nclose to the, how should I say, October the 27\", people were going to work, too, because\nwe had an Arbeitsamt, a German Arbeitsamt that said - enlisting people for work. And a\nlot of people from the villages were coming to Starachowice already in the ghetto to look\nfor work, but they had to come somehow, maybe they were brought by the Germans, I\ncouldn\u2019t tell you, but I know that we had an Arbeitsamt, which 1s a labor bureau,\nwhatever you call it, where people were coming and asking for work because they knew\nfrom the other places that only the ones that will work will live. Because we heard what\nwas going in Warsaw and all over. So, people - as a matter of fact I was working in the\nArbeitsamt, and my father and I we both worked in the Arbeitsamt.",
        "Q: I think we have to change the tape.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: ...And I think that story about that holiday, that\u2019s a wonderful st-, I mean, it\u2019s a very - I\nunderstand.",
        "A: But, you know, I cried my eyes out, and, again, the people that I knew in Radom, the\nJewish people that were sending their kids to high school there because it was expensive,\nwell-to-do people. So, at that time, 1t wasn\u2019t nice to be - you had to be rich. You wouldn\u2019t\nadmit that you weren\u2019t. So, let\u2019s say my mother was sending me home baking on Friday.\nEvery Friday she would send me a parcel with someone who was going that way. And\nmy girlfriends loved my mother\u2019s baking. And this was for the whole week for me to eat!\nBecause I didn\u2019t, you know, it wasn\u2019t that she was, she says, \u201cOh, today is Friday! Let\u2019s\ngo to Hania. She has her mother\u2019s cake!\u201d And those kids, they didn\u2019t miss anything. You\nknow, they were rich kids. They ate all my cakes. My mother would buy me fruits like\noranges that were extremely expensive, but for me, maybe one orange, maybe a few\ngrapes. You know, she would do the best she could. And they ate everything and I didn\u2019t\nhave what to eat for the whole week.",
        "Q: Hania, I want to take us back to your life in Radom, because I think it\u2019s important for us\nto get a sense of what it meant for you to be that independent, and how different it was\nfor you to be home than for your other sisters to be home. So, let\u2019s talk a little about what\nyour life was like during that time and some incidences that happened to you.",
        "A: Well, I lived in - my mother used to rent a room for me in a friend\u2019s place or whatever\nand I lived there for the 10 months; for the vacation I went home. And she did the best\nshe could. She washed my laundry every week. I sent her my laundry to be washed at\nhome because I didn\u2019t have the facilities. And every week she would send me the home\nbaking and the best she could, she could afford to buy at the time: some fruits that were\nimported that were so expensive that only the sick ones would get them sometimes. And I\nwas very good at school, so I had no problem there. I always had straight A\u2019s. My parents\nwere very proud of me; they were always bragging. And I also tutored French, and I was\npaid for those lessons, so this was my spending money. We could go to a movie or for ice\ncream, like, we were going in groups, but it was expensive, so I could afford to pay for it\nbecause I was making some money there. And for holidays, I usually used to come home,\nbut for the Yom Kippur and the Rosh Hashana, I not always could because it was the\nbeginning of school and I didn\u2019t want to miss - don\u2019t forget, I was the only Jewish girl in\nour class, so I couldn\u2019t afford to miss a week of school at the very beginning. So, I\nremember, one year I was living with the professor, the professor\u2019s family, and for the\nholidays, I also had an aunt living, an aunt and uncle in Radom. My uncle was the brother\nof my father, but I didn\u2019t live with them. I lived with this family. And the lady of the\nhouse asked me what am I going to do for the holidays. So, I couldn\u2019t say \u201cnothing\u201d\nbecause I didn\u2019t want to be invited by them, because it is a family holiday and they had\ntheir family. So, she says, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d So, I said to her, \u201cMy aunt invited\nme for dinner.\u201d So she said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s good.\u201d So when they sat at the table, I went out\non the street, and you know, that was - all the smells were so, I mean, so inviting\neverywhere. And I wasn\u2019t invited to my aunt\u2019s for the holidays. I was walking the streets\nuntil I got tired, and I sat down on a stone somewhere near the road and started crying. I\ncried myself to death. I was so hungry and I was thinking of the house and I was envious\nof my sisters being there, you know, with the whole family and eating well and all. So, I\nreally felt very bad and I couldn\u2019t go home until they finished the dinner because I went\nto my aunt\u2019s officially, so when I came home, and they were already - I heard the dishes\nbeing washed and put away - and I went to bed. I was so hungry. I was so hungry, so I\ncried all night. That\u2019s how I remember one of the incidents of being independent.",
        "Q: And why, were you not close with your aunt?",
        "A: No, my aunt was very envious that I was - from the beginning, when I was accepted,\nwhen my mother brought me to Radom and when I passed the exam and the results were\nbeing, like, \u2018til the end of the summer, the results were unknown. So, my aunt says to my\nmother, \u201c\u201cWhat do you expect? You come from a small town there, and you come from\nWierzbnik, that they\u2019ll accept you with open arms? First of all, she has to pass as the best\nexam because she\u2019s Jewish. Secondly, what do you expect? They have in Radom a lot of\npeople that they know, and they\u2019re prominent people, that they\u2019ll accept you?\u201d And she\nsays, \u201cThe hair will grow on my wrist if she would be accepted.\u201d So, anyway, towards\nthe end, my mother registered - at the same time, she registered me at the Jewish\ngymnasium. And when she came to look at the results, she went by herself because she\nwas sure that I won\u2019t be accepted. So, she went there and, sure enough, I was accep- my\nname was there, so she fainted. And then my aunt and the whole family wanted to be sure\nthat this is true, they all went to see whether it\u2019s true. But that wasn\u2019t the only - I talked to\nher many times. We had many conversations because she was in America. And she\nknows that she did me wrong. But she had two sons and she says that she didn\u2019t want me\nto live in her house because the sons were my age, and that was her explanation.",
        "Q: So, you sometimes made decisions...?",
        "A: No. I mean, I had to make decisions the way I could. I was just a kid. I couldn\u2019t call my\nparents; we didn\u2019t have a telephone. I remember it one time, I was sick, and I was living\nin another place where, like, I had a girlfriend in the family, so they accepted me, and I\nshared her room. And I got sick, so my landlady called my mother to come and pick me\nup because, I mean, she wasn\u2019t ready to look after a sick child. So, my mother came and\npicked me up and took me home for a week or two until I recovered and I came back.",
        "Q: And I understand that the packages she would send you...",
        "A: Yeah, the packages - every Friday she would - because she baked for - every Friday she\nbaked a babka, and other very - I mean, her baking was very good - and every Friday, she\nwould send me a parcel containing, like, her baking and some imported fruit, a little bit of\nthis, a little bit of that, which was very special and very expensive. And I had a lot of\nfriends in Radom that visit me many times, and we went out with them to the movies.\nAnd they knew that on Friday night, I would get a parcel with all the goodies, so they\nsay, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Hania because she got a parcel!\u201d\u2019 But those kids were at home and they\ndidn\u2019t miss anything, and I didn\u2019t have anything for the week. I mean, except for the\ndinner that I was given. Like, when my mother paid for the room, she paid also for one\nmeal for me to eat, a hot meal, and the rest I was supposed to buy by myself.",
        "Q: So, where would you then eat breakfast and lunch?",
        "A: In my room, but you know, like, it wasn\u2019t like - I would have a bagel and cheese or\nsomething. And I remember I had a tremendous appetite, and one day my father came to\nvisit me. And on the way from the train, he stopped to buy bagels - not bagels, I think\nrolls, kaiser rolls - and cheese, because I really liked the yellow cheese. So, he bought six\nrolls for me to have for the week or whatever. And I remember, he never forgot to\nmention it that I had all six rolls at one time. [Laughs. |",
        "Q: So, you really had a big appetite!",
        "A: Tremendous, because I grew very fast. When I came to Radom, I was the smallest one in\nmy class, but when I was thirteen years old, I grew twelve centimeters. I was the tallest\none in my class. And from there on, when we carried the insignia of the school, the tallest\nused to get it, I used to be the one.",
        "Q: Tell me, what was it like for you to be the only Jewish kid in that school? Was that\ndifficult?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t difficult because - I had a few kids that were really ridiculing me, they called\nme all kinds of names - but they were just a few. But in general, I tried to be like them. I\nhelped them out, I stayed after school, did their assignments, helped them with\neverything, like, for free because I wanted so badly to mix with them. And certain people,\nones, I learned to disregard what they were saying. They called me all sorts of names. I\u2019m\nnot saying \u2018they\u2019 because there were a couple of such girls. I remember them very well.\nSo if they called me such names, I just pretended not to hear. But I had also one case\nwhere the parents treated me very badly. I was sitting at one desk with a girl called Janina\nKremska (ph). Her father was a judge; I don\u2019t know what her mother - her mother was\napparently not well. I couldn\u2019t tell you - I have never before been in her house. Before we\nleft she offered that she would take me to the station. We had some time yet. So, I took\nmy suitcase and - when we got our school certificate at the end of the year, our marks -\nso, She says, \u201cYou come, we\u2019ll have lunch at our house, and I\u2019Il take you to the station,\nPll help you.\u201d So I went to her house. She wasn\u2019t a very good student. Anyway, the\nmother asked her to show her her report card. So, the mother looked and didn\u2019t say\nanything. So, before she set the lunch, she asked me if I\u2019d show her mine. So, I always\nhad straight A\u2019s, I mean, that was to me - I took it out without even thinking that I could\nhave told her that I don\u2019t want to because I knew Janina Kremska (ph) wasn\u2019t such a\ngood student. She got so mad, she threw me out of the house!",
        "Q: She got mad at you?",
        "A: At me. She got mad at me, but she told me later the father apologized. He came down\nlater and he apologizes. He said to me that she\u2019s not - she\u2019s not - that she\u2019s sick. But I\ndidn\u2019t notice that she should be sick. She just threw me out, she told me to go. So, you\nsay, \u201cHow did they treat you?\u201d Well, that was my best friend!",
        "Q: And the teachers at the school?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s also, some - all the teachers were - the French teacher was Catholic, but she\nwas converted. She was really Jewish. She loved me - I had no problems with her. And\nthe teachers in general liked me because I was a good student. Like, even in Latin, I was\ngetting harder work, like when we had an exam at school, she would put me at the end of\nthe class with a longer exam because she didn\u2019t want me to sit there while the others were\nstill struggling. So, the teachers liked me because I was a good student. As a matter of\nfact, there was a mathematics teacher, her name was Kostetska (ph). Nobody ever had a -\nlike, we had numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, so 5 was the best, you know, it\u2019s like \u2018very good\u2019 here.\nI was the only one that, throughout the school, I used to get 5. My friend still today says,\n\u201cIf you got a 5 from Kostetska (ph), you\u2019re lucky.\u201d So, the teachers all liked me, but the\nsecretary - the secretary, whenever I went there, she made very bad remarks to me. One\nday, she says, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I said, \u201cAnna Laks.\u201d She says, \u201cYour name isn\u2019t\nAnna. Your name is Hannah.\u201d I says, \u201cNo, my name is Anna.\u201d And she says, \u201cNo, your\nname is Hannah.\u201d And she emphasized the \u2018H\u2019 because she couldn\u2019t stand it that my\nname was Polish while I was Jewish. And she was mean to me, but I mean, I didn\u2019t come\nin contact with her too much, only when I had to bring my parents\u2019 check for the tuition.\nBut I did feel a little bit of anti-Semitism, but I disregarded it completely because most of\nthe girls were really nice to me. There was 45 of us and we met after school, and then\nthere were dances. I didn\u2019t have any problem because - there was a similar men\u2019s\ngymnasium under the same name as ours - so, once a year we had a dance, so they put all\nthe boys in a row and the girls in a row, and whoever you met you had to dance. So, I\nnever had any problems, but I heard from a friend - as a matter of fact we just talked the\nother day about it - from a male friend that, he was standing across from one Polish girl\nand she was so cute, and then she says, \u201cI don\u2019t dance with Jews.\u201d He says he felt so bad\nbecause it never happened before because he was a good-looking boy. So, there were -\nbut as I said, the few incidents that were happening to me I tried to disregard because\notherwise I couldn\u2019t live with them. I was the only one!",
        "Q: Do you know if other Jews applied to the school - other Jewish girls applied to that\nschool as well and couldn\u2019t get in?",
        "A: Oh, yes, because I have here - there 1s how many are we here? There are about five of us\nleft from that school, and we still meet here.",
        "Q: Jewish girls, you mean?",
        "A: Yes, because one year they accepted four girls instead of one girl, and after that it was\nnumerus nolus already. Why four girls? Because one of the girls that lives here in Miami,\nher father had a brick factory, so he built a gymnasium for the school for free, so they\naccepted the four girls. When I say gymnasium, like exercise, a big exercise gymnasium\nfor the school. He donated the bricks and the labor.",
        "Q: Tell me something, going back now to the ghetto, when the Germans attach Russian in\nJune of 1941, do you remember that as being a significant change?",
        "A: I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t? Okay. So, the ghetto experience up to the end of the ghetto, October, when do\nyou start working in the brick factory with Chris?",
        "A: Okay, first I worked in Arbeitsamt, and they closed this - maybe I should also not tell you\nthat a German, before we got sent to the camp, that a German under the name Pohl - P-O-\nH-L - who was the Lagerftihrer of Majowka, he was coming to recruit some people, like,\npick some other new people, you know, to work. He noticed me working in the office\nthere, and so he was always telling us things, that the ghetto is going to be liquidated. But\nhe didn\u2019t tell us when; he only told us that it\u2019s going to be liquidated. Anyway, towards\nthe end, the last time he came to the office, he told us that the ghetto is going to be\nliquidated the day later than in reality it was. So, we had an idea. So, Arbeitsamt - about\ntwo weeks before they liquidated the ghetto, they closed the Arbeitsamt. The Arbeitsamt\nwasn\u2019t needed anymore because the people that had the war cards already were located.\nAnd Krysia and I...",
        "Q: Excuse me, but the Arbeitsamt did what?",
        "A: They were assigning people - like, they were employing people. They were assigning\npeople to different factories",
        "Q: In the area.",
        "A: In the area. We had, we had the worker, where they were making bullets, they\nwere making guns. This was a war kind of factory, a big factory. Rogalin (ph) was a\nplace where they were making bricks. So, towards the end, when we knew that we have\nto work somewhere else, that we have to get our cards, Krysia and I started working -\nthey closed the Arbeitsamt, let\u2019s say, I think 1t was about two weeks before the\nliquidation. It could have been three weeks or maybe shorter, I couldn\u2019t tell you. But we\nstarted working in this factory, on the night shift, Chris and I. Like, when they liquidated\nthe ghetto, we had to find another job. When they liquidated the Arbeitsamt, I started\nworking for this brick factory and Krysia worked with me at night.",
        "Q: And you were doing what?",
        "A: We were making bricks. Like, there were machines, but we stayed in water, I mean, the\nwater was dripping, and we were making those bricks. We were putting the stuff in those\nmachinery and when the bricks were coming out, we were working...",
        "Q: Now, your mother was not working?",
        "A: No, but I provided her, like, a card, too. I mean, she wasn\u2019t working just for her to have a\ncard. Everybody had to have a working card.",
        "Q: And your father was also working in the Arbeitsamt?",
        "A: No, he worked in the Arbeitsamt. And I don\u2019t remember what - I don\u2019t think that he - or\nmaybe he went to work? I couldn\u2019t tell you later. I couldn\u2019t tell you because it was very\nshort-lived. That was a very hard time for all of us because we heard already that there\nwas that village and this village, and they were bringing the people to Starachowice\nbecause, in these villages, they only had a few - not too many Jews, because the\nliquidation was for the whole district there.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re hearing rumors about the killing of Jews.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And does it make any connection with you about what...?",
        "A: It did, it did. But we felt that if we worked, we will survive, because that was the -\neverybody believed that if you worked, you save your life. Because I don\u2019t think they\npaid for the labor. I don\u2019t remember whether we got paid for the work when we\nwere making bricks, but once you worked, you saved your life.",
        "Q: So, that was the strategy. And Renia, what was she doing at that time?",
        "A: Renia, I don\u2019t know what she was doing before, because she was, during the liquidation,\nshe was at the marketplace with Mother and Father, and Krysia and I were at work\nbecause we worked night shift.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about a story that Chris told, and I wanted to know if you\nremembered it and how you remembered it. She talked about all of you being outside - I\nstill don\u2019t know whether Renia was outside - you were outside somewhere where there\nwere bushes. And some guy came out and used the code word \u201cAmhat\u201d was used.",
        "A: Amhut.",
        "Q: Amhut. You knew that he was Jewish. And he said that he escaped from Treblinka. And\nChris tells the story that she really didn\u2019t believe him; she didn\u2019t know what he was really\ntalking about. She brought him inside the house, or the apartment, or wherever you were\nstaying, to your parents, and your parents kicked you all out and talked with him. Do you\nhave any recollection?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, no.",
        "Q: So, what recollection do you have of what you\u2019re hearing about what the Nazis are\ndoing?",
        "A: We were scared but we believed, we somehow believed that if we have work, we\u2019 ll\nsurvived. So, that was our main - like, we tried to work, to have the proper papers to\nprove that we work.",
        "Q: Do you remember the illness, the typhus, that your mother had?",
        "A: I remember my mother being very sick. I remember this, that she almost died. But she\nwas sick at home. That wasn\u2019t in the camp.",
        "Q: Yes, this is before.",
        "A: It was before. I remember it very well, and I remember the Paliszewskis were coming to the\nhouse to help with that. Renia will tell you.",
        "Q: So, in spite of the rumors that you\u2019re hearing about the extermination of Jews, you still\nthink that they\u2019re exterminating Jews who either can\u2019t work or won\u2019t work? Or you...?",
        "A: We still, we couldn\u2019t believe that things like that could happen. Although we heard about\nit, we tried to work in order to save our lives, but we still did not believe that they are\nexterminating them. We still believed that they are deporting them somewhere for other\nwork. But we wanted to stay where we are because we knew already what it was.",
        "Q: Did you ever get depressed during this period, before the liquidation of the ghetto?",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t - I was so engrossed in saving our lives. I was always trying to save\nmy life. And I knew that I will eventually die, whether I will be killed that way or the\nother way, but life was so precious that we concentrated more on how to live than how...\nI don\u2019t remember being depressed.",
        "Q: But frightened.",
        "A: Frightened.",
        "Q: Yeah. Do you remember the mood of people around you, other than your family, the way\npeople were?",
        "A: Other than my family, I don\u2019t remember. But while we\u2019re talking about it, I will tell you,\nthe grown-ups were more scared. Because, see, when you are young, you\u2019re daring, and\nyou are not so afraid because you think to yourself, \u201cI will run away.\u201d That\u2019s why we\u2019re\nthinking of uprising inside the camp already in Starachowice, because we didn\u2019t want to\nbe killed just like we heard that other people are getting killed.",
        "Q: All right, we\u2019ll stop the camera here.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: Hania, let\u2019s talk about the night of the evacuation, or the night before. You and Chris are\nin the brick factory doing the night shift, but they don\u2019t let you go in the morning. So, tell\nme about that day and what you remember.",
        "A: We are expecting the liquidation of the ghetto a day later. My mother prepared everyone\nof us had a knapsack, I mean, whatever, so that when we are going to work anywhere, it\nwas a little bit of clothes, you know, and it was - but a change - some shoes maybe or so.\nSo, everybody had it ready for the next day. But, unfortunately we went to work in our\nwork clothes for the night, not knowing that the liquidation would be that night. So, we\ndidn\u2019t take anything with us, only the way we were. And at night we noticed on the roof\nof the factory, like through the window - through the roof - above the roof of the factory,\nwe saw people walking toward the station, walking, and Germans with dogs and we were\nwondering what happened. So, we knew that the liquidation is going on, and we tried to -\nI mean, it wasn\u2019t far from the station, but we couldn\u2019t - we only saw lots of people\nwalking slowly with kids, but we didn\u2019t see any of our relatives or friends. We tried to.\nThey told us that we will go straight to camp. At that time, we had three ready camps to\nmove in. Strzelnica, which was the biggest camp, Majowka, which was the smallest\ncamp. So, just to give you an idea, let\u2019s say in Strzelnica, they could keep a thousand\npeople. Majowka was about five hundred. I mean, it\u2019s not exact, but just to give you an\nidea that Majowka was a smaller camp, and they had a third camp called Tartak (ph).\nThis camp - it was a sawmill and they only had room for about a hundred workers. So,\nsome people, as you know, from the marketplace, they all went to Strzelnica, the ones\nthat were chosen to work. The ones that were chosen to die, at that time nobody knew\nwhere they were going, went to the train station. We were sent direct to Majowka, and in\nMajowka this Pohl, guy was the Lagerfiihrer. He was in charge of that Lager. So, when\nwe arrived there, he right away - I mean, since he knew that I had experience, he put me\nin his office. I don\u2019t remember what Krysia was to do. Then, we found out that - we\ndidn\u2019t know who survived. We didn\u2019t know whether Renia was alive, whether my father\nwas alive - I didn\u2019t know that, whether my mother is alive. We had no idea. We were sent\nto Majowka, and Renia and Father were sent to Strzelnica. Of course, my father went to\nthe office right away because they knew him also from the Arbeitsamt. And I don\u2019t\nremember whether that day or some other day we found out that my mother didn\u2019t make\nit, that she was sent out together with the other people. We believed that they were sent\nsomewhere else. We never believed that they were going to Treblinka although we heard\nabout Treblinka many times, but in our mind, we couldn\u2019t believe that atrocities like that\ncould happen. So, life was hard. Like, the people that went to Strzelnica, started going to\nwork right away. I don\u2019t remember what Krysia did. Maybe she was working with... I\ndon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember where she worked. A few days later, and Vaschek (ph)\nwas in charge of the other Lager, came to inspect what - because he was actually in\ncharge of the two Lagers; Pohl was in the smaller camp. He came to the office. He\nlooked at my work, and he says, \u201cYou know what?\u201d I think that because he liked the way\nI wrote those lists, you know, those - we started - what did we do at the office? We kept\nrecords of all the people that lived there. Everyone had a card. On the card, it was his\nname, the barrack number, because, I mean, the date of birth, and the barrack number,\nand where he worked. Then, from those cards, we were making up lists - daily work lists\n- because they were different departments in the factory and those workers, like, in the\nmorning, you would call the names and they would go to those, and the next day maybe\nthey were changed. So, I was making all those lists. So, I remember Vaschek (ph) liked\nthe way I make the lists and he says, \u201cFrom now on,\u201d he sent my father. So, Krysia was\nwith my father, and since Renta was in Strzelnica, I was sent to Strzelnica to do the work\nthere, to work in the office. Now, Ill just mention it, because if somebody died, was\nkilled, whatever, most of the people were very strong, the ones that committed\nthemselves to work, so they didn\u2019t die the normal way. Most of them were either killed\nhere or there. We used to write down in the Polish \u201cdeceased\u201d, and we kept the cards\nseparate. Otherwise, we knew exactly how many people we have in each camp. Tartak\n(ph) was a separate unit. They had their own office and their own people. They - it wasn\u2019t\nconnected. But those two camps were connected.",
        "Q: So, you were making the lists for both camps.",
        "A: I was keeping all the records. The records to - Vaschek (ph) - maybe I'll talk about him\nwhen I talk about the other Germans - he kept under lock and key; that was in his office.\nAnd in the morning was allowed to go in there, take whatever I needed to do the - to\nprepare whatever, and I had to put it back in his office and he was the only one that had\naccess. I didn\u2019t have any access to any of those records. I was doing what I was supposed\nto, I put it in the place, and it went under lock and key. Now, the structure - are you\ninterested in the structure?",
        "Q: Yes, it\u2019s very important. It\u2019s very important, yes, please.",
        "A: So, Pll start with Strzelnica. The same was in Majowka. We had a Judenrat - first the\nJewish people - we had a Judenrat, we had the police, and we had people that were in\ncharge of the - where they lived in the barracks. The Judenrat were the elders - do you\nneed the names?",
        "Q: That would be great.",
        "A: Mr. Minzberg (ph), Mr. Billingriecht (ph), Mr. Einisemann (ph), Mr. Wolfowicz (ph).\nThe police - there were 12 policemen, 12 Jewish policemen, and one in charge, and the\none in charge was my husband\u2019s father. Then there were Ukrainians - guards. They\nwere...",
        "Q: Go back to how the Judenrat was chosen and how the police were chosen.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell you because when I came to Strzelnica, that was already a done fact. What\nthe police were doing. The policemen had no rights of any sort, just gather together the\npeople in the morning. They were supposed to keep an order inside the Lager, but people\nat that time were very orderly, they were doing what they were supposed to do. So, there\nwas no problem of this sort, but their main job was to bring all those people - they came\nto the office, got the list, this one, this one. So, they would round up those people that\nwere going to this department, this department. The policemen would take them to the\ngate, and from the gate, the Ukrainians would take over. And, they were supposed to\nkeep an order, and of course, when the Germans used to come and whatever they had to\ndo, they were using them to do what - what should I say? They had no arms, no - not only\nno arms, no sticks, no anything. Like, there was about 12 of them.",
        "Q: Did they wear any special hats or anything? Did they have any way of identifying\nthemselves?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. They must have had, but I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t remember, to\ntell you the truth. Then, there was Judenrat. They were in charge, you know, of - they\nwere responsible for the kitchen and for the supplies and, you know, in general - the\nGermans would dump the food and dump it, and they were in charge of all those, I mean,\nthey were running a camp where was a thousand or over people. So, they had to be fed,\nthey had to be clothed, they were bringing the clothes at one time and just dump it. And\nat the office, let\u2019s say, I and maybe another two or three girls to help were giving out the\nclean stuff for the people, like because, you know, and they were responsible for the\ninside of the camp. And there was a lot of - there was a lot of bribery going on. They had\nto pay the Germans off for this and for whatever. They did the smallest favor, they were\ncollecting whatever they could collect. And a lot of the Germans were only asking for\nbribes. Now, what was - so, the guards - I'll go back now to the guards - the guards were\nwatching the gate. There was a tower, one tower near the gate where they watching, and\nas I said, they were taking people to work and from work, and they were transporting\nwhatever had to be transported. Now, the guards were Ukrainians. Then there were\nGermans, heads of the guards. So, there was three of them. There was Schrodt - he was\nfamous and notorious and I\u2019Il tell you stories about him - Schleizier and Wolf. There\nwere three shifts. So, a German was responsible for the guards. Then, we had - we had\nthe Lagerfuhrer, which was responsible for the camp. He lived outside of camp, but he\nwas there all day. That was in Strzelnica. I'll talk about Strzelnica because I was there the\nlongest. His name was Vaschek (ph). He was a sudetendeutche (ph), which means he\ncame from Czechoslovakia. He spoke Czechoslovakian, Czech, so we could understand.\nHe could understand Polish, and he had the green uniform, and he was - he had a very\nfoul language. He talked so badly, but he had - he was the only one that had a heart, the\nonly one, because he never - he would always screamed at the people, screamed at and\nswore at them, even at me, like he called me all kinds of name, but I didn\u2019t pay attention\nbecause I knew that he had a heart. He never touched a Jew, although he had this rubber\nstick. He would pick it up and he would scream, \u201cGet the hell out of here.\u2019 And he was\nscreaming, but he never - to such a degree that once he told the Ukrainians, \u201cNo one\ntouches my Jews. Only I have the right to touch my Jews.\u201d So, he wasn\u2019t so bad, and as a\nmatter of fact, he was there for a long time. I don\u2019t know why he was later let go. He\nwent to Ostrowiec, which was a camp not far from us, and they tell me that he was\nhorrible there. So, I don\u2019t know. He was the only German that I could say a good word\nabout because the others were all murderers and, I mean, I\u2019 Il tell you stories unbelievable\nstories. Then we had - then we had in camp, above Vaschek (ph), Vaschek (ph) was in\ncamp all the time. Then there was a guy by the name of Meyer (ph) who was overseeing\nall the camps, but he would only come for an hour. He would talk with Vaschek (ph).\nYou know, they would walk and talk. He wasn\u2019t yet - I mean, he wasn\u2019t good, but he\nwasn\u2019t yet as bad as the top man was called Altov (ph). He was the most horrible killer\nthat one, I mean, he was - he was killing Jews and when he arrived into the camp, he\nwanted everybody to freeze in the place where - if you walked you had to stand up. He\njumped over fences. He killed from all kinds of situations, like he would sit down, he\nwould jump, he would kill people that appeared on his way, and we will just make a note\nthen at the office that 1s deceased. He was the worst of them, and apparently I heard that\nhe was from a family because there was as I said called Altov (ph), apparently in\nGermany a very famous circus. So, he must have been an acrobat, because the way he\nbehaved, I mean, only an acrobat could kill people from all positions like him. Everybody\nwas so scared of him that I didn\u2019t even look in his - I don\u2019t even - I don\u2019t remember his\nface because when he came to the office and asked for Vaschek (ph), I would pretend that\n- | was afraid to look up. So, that was the worst. Then, in the factories we had - we had\npeople. Okay.",
        "Q: Can I ask you a question about somebody like Altov (ph)? How did you - how did you\nmake sense then or how do you make sense now of this kind of brutality?",
        "A: I think that he was not accepted by the Germans because I think - he didn\u2019t have a\nuniform, he didn\u2019t have an SS, most likely because we found out later, whether it\u2019s true\nor not, we met his mother in Auschwitz and she was a gypsy. Whether this was the same\nMrs. Altov (ph), but if must have been because I talked personally with her. When I\nheard that she was an Altov (ph), I went and I talked to her. And the way she described\nhim, it must have been her son, and she says she was a gypsy and they were in the circus\nbusiness. So, I can\u2019t tell you, but he wasn\u2019t an SS man. Everybody was afraid of him. The\nJudenrat was afraid of him. They were hardly talking to him, and I\u2019m telling you, I mean\nI would freeze. I put my eyes down, I so was afraid, and I kept my shoulders up because I\nwas afraid that he would shoot me in a minute.",
        "Q: But, the Germans didn\u2019t stop him. They didn\u2019t care that he was doing this.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t care. He was the worst and he was - his title was Stumftihrer (ph). Then we\nhad - and Meyer (ph) died, I think, yes, he died. So, he was replaced by a guy called\nColditz (ph). He was very fat man. He was also screaming. He was almost as bad as\nAltov (ph).",
        "Q: On the Judenrat.",
        "A: No, no, he was almost as bad as Altov (ph) by his behavior like when he was coming\nthey\u2019d he also demanded to freeze, people to freeze, and then they were the people, the\nSicherheit Polizei, which was the, like - I don\u2019t know how to say encavudei (ph) in\nRussian, how do Sicherheit Polizei (ph), they were...",
        "Q: Intelligence police?",
        "A: Intelligence police. Okay?",
        "Q: Maybe security police.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, Sicherheit (ph). And, I'll tell you stories about him, what he did to people,\nbecause I'll give specific stories about him, horrible man, horrible. Then there was\nKashmider (ph), and who was in charge of, like - the Germans were - the Germans\nsoldiers, the German officials who were wearing uniforms were in charge of the place\nwhere the Jews worked. So, they would come and look around and change workers and\nstuff like that. Those were the people that accepted all sorts of bribes, you know, to take\nsomebody to work or to change his job, you know, what it was. So, they used to come to\nthe, for conferences, to the Judenrat, but it wasn\u2019t a conference. They had to be prepared\nwith bribes. There was another one. I think I gave you all the names already.",
        "Q: Can I ask you something? I think most people assume that Judenrat was a function inside\na ghetto, as opposed to a labor camp. Was this camp somehow in between being a labor\ncamp and a ghetto?",
        "A: No, that was the labor camp, and those people were - maybe the Judenrat was the same\npeople who were in the ghetto. The same as they took me and my father because we were\nin Arbeitsamt, maybe that\u2019s why we got into the office. Otherwise, I mean, I don\u2019t know\nhow we could get into the office if they didn\u2019t see us writing there and keeping records.",
        "Q: Was you in somewhat of a privileged position because of the job?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You were not?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So, whatever...",
        "A: I slept in the same barrack, and I wasn\u2019t in any privileged position at - they never spoke\nto me, nobody except for my boss, that Vaschek (ph). He was the only one that talked to\nme; otherwise, nobody else talked to me ever.",
        "Q: Did you actually have conversations with Vaschek (ph)?",
        "A: No, because he had such a foul mouth, I was afraid to, I mean, I wasn\u2019t afraid of him, but\nI just couldn\u2019t take the way he - I mean, he didn\u2019t mistreat me, but he called me all sorts\nof names, but 1t wasn\u2019t only to me. He did that to everybody. But that was only words.\nThat\u2019s why I say he had heart, because sometimes there were a few cases when I was\nsaved because of him, because he sent me to the factory to work, to type letters, and type\nlists where they had - when they had some kind of action. I only think like that because\non two occasions, I was sent to the factory during selection, and the first time I thought I\nwas lucky, but the second time, I thought maybe Vaschek (ph) did that. Although he\ntalked to me so badly, but I didn\u2019t care. It was a good job.",
        "Q: So, how regularly were there selections? Was it regular or was it just...?",
        "A: No, only sometimes, and the selections were only when people were sick. So, Ill tell you\nthose stories separately because it was very important how they were treating it.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re now in this - are you with Renia or with your father?",
        "A: No, my father and Krysia were in - on Majowka, and Renia and I were there for awhile,\nand then later - I don\u2019t - this I don\u2019t remember exactly how it happened, because they\nbrought all the people from Majowka to Strzelnica and then from Strzelnica to Majowka.\nYou know, it was, I don\u2019t remember exactly what time and when, but Strzelnica was the\nbigger camp, the bigger camp, but then later we were all moved to Majowka. At first,\nbecause for a time I was with my father and Krysia, and for a time I was away from them.\nI don\u2019t really remember when it was, what year it was, because I\u2019m sure that Krysia must\nhave been - they must have taken them from Strzelnica to Majowka maybe first and then\nto - they made one camp at a certain time, maybe for repairs or for other things, I couldn\u2019t\ntell you.",
        "Q: But, when you went to Majowka, 1s Majowka larger than 500 people or was it was still\nonly 500 people?",
        "A: Five hundred people, but maybe they - maybe they enlarged it meanwhile, because, you\nknow, later on they were taking us, towards the end - towards the end, we were taken to\nanother camp altogether. They were building a special camp for us, just to get rid of us,\nbecause it was near a train line.",
        "Q: Can you give us some idea of what these camps looked like?",
        "A: Yes. When you walked in, there was a gate and there was a tower. The Ukrainian was on\nthe tower with a gun. The Ukrainian that was at the gate also had a gun - did he have a\ngun or one of those sticks? And, the office in Strzelnica was almost close to the gate, like,\nyou walked and that was - such a barrack was an office, and then, I remember, there was\na kitchen there further away, where they were cooking the soup, and you would have to\nline up for the soup right away. And there was a laundry where Renia later worked. She\nworked in a laundry, and then there were the barracks. The barracks were separate from\nthe men and separate for the women, and I don\u2019t remember how many of the barracks\nwere there, but we slept two on one cot, and...",
        "Q: And, where these buildings brick?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Wood?",
        "A: Wood.",
        "Q: And, were they made specially?",
        "A: I suppose they had - there was no camps before, so they must have made them specially\nwhen we were in ghettos, because there were no camps there before.",
        "Q: And how terrible were the conditions? I mean, was there any water running? Where was\nthe latrines, if there were latrines?",
        "A: There were latrines and there were showers, but you k now what? I don\u2019t remember. I\nreally, like, I was thinking the other night, \u201cWhere did we eat?\u201d Because I remember that\nwe lined up for food. We lined up for food - for soup. That was the main meal. The\npeople that worked in the factories got their meal, but the people that were on shifts, and\nthe people that worked in camp ate - we had to line up for the soup and line-up for the\nbread. But, if you ask me where did we eat? Did we eat - it wasn\u2019t a dining room - but in\na big room or whether we eat in our barracks? You know, I couldn\u2019t remember. I was\ntrying to think, \u201cHow did we eat?\u201d I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Did you eat outside?",
        "A: I don\u2019t - I don\u2019t remember, like, I don\u2019t think that we would sit outside and eat. So, we\nmust have eaten somewhere, but where? Maybe there was a room behind the kitchen, but\nI couldn\u2019t tell you. I forgot.",
        "Q: Did you carry bowls or did they hand them out to you?",
        "A: No, we had such metal dishes that they were - because they served the soup and you left\nyour dish there later. But it wasn\u2019t - in concentration camp we had metal kind of\nmanashki (ph), we called it, and with the handles so we could put it on a string and carry\nit all the time.",
        "Q: I think we probably have to stop the tape now, am I right? Two minutes, all right then\nlet\u2019s stop.",
        "A: Then we'll have lunch?",
        "Q: We have lunch? I don\u2019t know.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: Hania, I know that you can\u2019t remember where you ate, but can you describe the process\nof getting food and the container in which you got food and if you had a utensil, and\ndescribe the food if you can.",
        "A: Okay, there was - there was a kitchen and some of the people worked 1n the kitchen, and\none of them was Salka Perinsweic (ph). She was in charge of the kitchen, if that\u2019s\nimportant. Every noon - or the main meal - I don\u2019t know if it was at twelve or at two\no\u2019clock, or whatever - the main meal we would get soup and we had to all line up for the\nsoup. The workers that went to the factories were getting their main mail in the factories.\nSo, there weren\u2019t that many people, only the workers inside, the people that weren\u2019t well,\nand the people that didn\u2019t go to work that day or whatever. So, but she would - there were\nsome metal plates painted white. We would line up, get the food, and I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t\nremember where we ate, whether we took it to the barrack, whether we ate outside. I\ndon\u2019t remember any rooms that would be available for us to sit down at the table. I don\u2019t\nremember. Maybe there were. I couldn\u2019t really tell you. Then we would get bread in the\nmorning, I think. Each time, we had to line-up, but food, like, the morning breakfast\nwasn\u2019t so important because many times the workers that went to the factories were\nbuying somehow or exchanging things with the Polacks and were bringing home some\nbread and some other stuff.",
        "Q: What was the soup made of?",
        "A: The soup, potato soup, I remember. I don\u2019t really remember exactly, but whatever they\nhad, they put 1n this pot, and that was the soup for the - that was our dinner for the day.",
        "Q: And, do you remember how about how many people were being fed like this? I mean,\nwere there a lot of people working in the kitchen.",
        "A: A few people.",
        "Q: A few.",
        "A: A few people. I would say that at least half of them, because don\u2019t forget that we had\nshift work, that some people were going to work at night, in the evening, I don\u2019t know\nwhether we had three shifts, I think. So, they were getting food at the factory or on the\npremises, but this Salka Perinsweic (ph) was, she was one of the inmates as I call it. She\nwas in charge of the kitchen. That was her job.",
        "Q: And it was a big job.",
        "A: Yeah, a big job.",
        "Q: Do you remember being very hungry\u201d?",
        "A: Not in labor camp. You know that I really don\u2019t remember being so very hungry. That\nmeans that we must have had - we didn\u2019t have any fancy food. We didn\u2019t have - we had\nbread and soup, but maybe we were allowed to eat as much as we could. I couldn\u2019t, I\ndon\u2019t remember. I remember being very, very hungry in the concentration camp, but\nmaybe because in concentration camp it was - it was, I mean, we were almost dying from\nhunger that - that the camp in Starachowice was already like a restaurant.",
        "Q: So, I guess as you progress for deprivation, you remember the least bad as being not so\nbad somehow.",
        "A: That\u2019s true. I just don\u2019t remember those things.",
        "Q: Did you have an evening meal?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember. Tell me something about what your day would be like. How early\nwould you get up in order to go to the office?",
        "A: I would go very early because the first shift, if the shift was going, I had to give them the\nwork list. I had to prepare it for them. So, if they went to work at seven o\u2019clock, I had to\nbe there, and I worked until the last shift would go to work and Vaschek (ph) - before\nVaschek (ph) would go home and put all the records under the lock and key.",
        "Q: Did you make up the work lists or did Vaschek (ph) tell you who would be on it?",
        "A: No, I was told either by the policemen or like, I was, if there was any changes. If the list\nwas the same, I didn\u2019t have to change it. I just - because I got reports that would say,\n\u201cThis was transferred to here.\u201d So, I knew that the next day, I\u2019d have to put this name on\nanother list. And I had to adjust the cards, as well. I had to write on it, let\u2019s say if she\nworked, if he worked in Department A, as an example, I\u2019m just saying. So, if he was\nchanged to C, I had to put it on his card too.",
        "Q: So, everybody in the camp had a kind of identity card.",
        "A: Yes, in the inside office. They didn\u2019t carry any cards.",
        "Q: And how big were these cards?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: How big?",
        "A: They were small cards because all we had was the name, as I told you, the birth date, the\nbarrack number where they lived or slept, and the department where they work, and a\nplace whether he\u2019s still alive or dead.",
        "Q: Now, did you type these lists?",
        "A: First, we didn\u2019t have like a typewriter in camp at first. So, if he wanted typed lists or\nsomething, he would send me to the factory, Vaschek (ph) would. But, if - but I had a\nvery good handwriting, very legible, I remember, and that\u2019s why he took me to his place,\nbecause he could read so easily my writing, and I was doing it all by hand. Later on, I\nremember, I don\u2019t know when, he brought a typewriter, an old typewriter, to the office.",
        "Q: Did you...?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know how to type, but I pretended. I said, \u201cWith two fingers, I type so fast.\u201d I\nlearned so fast. I never learned how to type. So, when he asked me if I could type, I had\nto say yes. I mean, otherwise he\u2019Il take somebody else to the office. That was a good job.\nSo, I typed with my fingers and I learned to type so fast that I was faster than the others -\nto such a degree that, in my office later, when I worked for ourselves, I took typing\nclasses and I could never learn because I was much faster with two fingers, the way I\nlearned in camp.",
        "Q: And did you print when you were not using the typewriter or did you handwrite?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t print, I wrote, but my letters were like printing. They were like\ncalligraphically. Like, I had a very good handwriting. You wouldn\u2019t believe when you\nsee how I sign my name now, with my eyes.",
        "Q: And how many people worked in the same office with you?",
        "A: Three people. There was one girl that cleaned the office. She\u2019s still alive. She lives in\nToronto. And there was one seamstress. She actually - he hired her as a helper to the -\nwhen I say he, I mean Vaschek (ph) because he was in charge of this office - he hired her\nto help the other girl to bring wood and stuff. We had a fireplace. There was no heating\nthere. So, there was such a fireplace and the girls had to bring wood, chop wood, they had\nto do all this. So, he hired her, but since she was a seamstress, Mrs. Vaschek (ph) used to\ncome very often to the office just to visit because this third girl was sewing dresses for\nher. So, she would bring materials and she would sit there, she would try on, and she\nwould - so, actually officially she was a helper to the cleaner, but in reality, she was a\nseamstress that sewed dresses. I don\u2019t remember because there was - I don\u2019t remember a\nsewing machine there. So, unless he provided a sewing machine, I don\u2019t remember, but\nshe made many dresses for her.",
        "Q: What was Vaschek\u2019s (ph) wife like?",
        "A: She was a very quiet woman, German, tall like him or maybe a little bit shorter because\nhe was extremely tall, and she was slim and she was a very pretty woman, and she was\nvery nice to us. I mean, she didn\u2019t talk with the other people, but if she would come to the\noffice, she would say hello to me. She would say hello to the seamstress. She would say\nhello to the other girl that cleaned the place. She was very nice. She used to come quite\noften because she - I don\u2019t know where she got all those materials. So, that girl sewed for\nher.",
        "Q: So, was your work day like nine, ten hours?",
        "A: Yes, as long as people were going out and coming in, until the last shift went to work, I\nhad to be at the office, to give them the list and then I went home.",
        "Q: So, your day...",
        "A: And sometimes Vaschek (ph) wouldn\u2019t be there so long. I mean, he would be working\nmaybe eight hours or seven or six, but I had to be in the office. But when he left, he\nlocked all his - I had no access to the papers anymore, but the list were prepared in\nadvance, so the lists that I was giving out before they went to work.",
        "Q: So, all day long you were doing lists and changing the things.",
        "A: I kept all kinds of records, like, when I say all kinds of records- they brought in, let\u2019s say\nif there was a delivery of clothes and we were giving the clothes out. So, I would say - I\nwouldn\u2019t, let\u2019s say, tell them what\u2019s going - we got a shipment of clothes and it came on\nsuch and such a date, and we gave them out on such and such a date. And, if the other\nsupplies would come or whatever, like, somebody had to keep records of those things.",
        "Q: So, you really were the record keeper of the whole camp?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Of these two camps?",
        "A: Right, in one camp, but later on when they put us together, my father worked with me.\nKrysia told me that in Majowka she was helping father in the office, but I couldn\u2019t tell\nyou because when my father was transferred to Majowka and I was transferred to\nStrzelnica, for a long time, I didn\u2019t have any contact with them, until we came together.\nBut I remember when I had typhoid, I think Krysia was there with me. I think so, but I\ndon\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Was it typhoid or typhus?",
        "A: Typhus, but isn\u2019t it called typhoid in English?",
        "Q: No, I think they\u2019re two different diseases.",
        "A: I see, because we had what they called - it wasn\u2019t connected with the stomach. It was...",
        "Q: Spotted.",
        "A: Spotted. It\u2019s called typhus, right? Okay.",
        "Q: Pll have to look it up. \u2019'm not...",
        "A: We called it tiphus.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So, I think I told someone typhus and he said, \u201cNo, typhoid.\u201d So, I say typhoid.",
        "Q: Now, tell me something, were people coming into your office to talk with you or to find\nout information?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t such a big wheel. The Judenrat was deciding, you know, they were - I was just -\nI was just writing and typing and stuff like that. But I\u2019ll tell you that people liked me a\nlot, because I remember once when I was distributing clothes and, you know, I was so\nstraightforward, I was transparent. So, I started giving clothes and people were grabbing\nand they started taking like instead of one shirt or whatever T-shirt, they would grab from\nmy hands and run. So, you know, I started crying. I said, \u201cWhat do you want from my\nlife? I have so many I have to give and get to everybody.\u201d I started crying. So, some\npeople who stood in line were chasing those other people to take it away, to help me\nbecause they were sorry for me because, you know, I would like to give them three or\nfour of them, but, I mean, I only had a limited amount. So, I must say that people always\nhelped me.",
        "Q: It\u2019s very interesting that you would cry at that moment.",
        "A: Yeah, I was crying because you know why?",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: I was crying because I felt that, because of those few pigs that want to grab all this, the\npeople at the end won\u2019t get nothing, will get nothing. So, I felt sorry for them. I started\ncrying and I remember they ran them and chase the down the guys.",
        "Q: Did you see a lot of that kind of behavior, people...",
        "A: Yeah, people were grabby, people were, you know, but, you know, this was life like - it\nwas hard. It wasn\u2019t as hard, in comparison to concentration camps, it was a picnic, but it\nwas still hard because we were still treated like animals.",
        "Q: Why do you think that you and your sisters remained...? You didn\u2019t do that. You kept\nwanting to be fair.",
        "A: You know, we were fair and because of that we really - we really always had protectors.\nPll tell you later stories about Auschwitz, how we remained alive because we kept\nourselves together and how people were helping us, people that were in charge of\nsomething. They would pick us because they felt sorry for us - more sorry for us because\nwe didn\u2019t fight, like we didn\u2019t - we didn\u2019t fight for food or grab it or anything like that.\nWe wanted to be fair. We were brought up that way.",
        "Q: All right, let\u2019s get back to some of the - let me ask you, did you know the people on the\nJudenrat?",
        "A: All of them, because they were from Wierzbnik. One was the father of our very good\nfriend, Krysia knows - Krysia and my friend, Mr. Minzberg (ph). He was a very well-\nknown man in Wierzbnik. They were once very rich, but at the time when we met them,\nthey had some kind of possessions, lots of land, landowners, bankers, who knows? Like,\nhis predecessor. At that time when we knew them, they were just like any others. There\nwere no rich people in Wierzbnik, but they were very well-known and very respected. He\nwas very well known and very respected person, and although he belonged to the Zionist\norganization, he was also very religious. But he was - we didn\u2019t have a synagogue. We\nused the school the Tarbut school we used for prayers, and he was - he was the one that\nprayed like he was religious. Another one was Minzburg (ph). Einisemann (ph) was just a\nshoemaker, but he was a very simple man, but he was a good man. So, they have chosen\nhim because he was also - he tried to be fair. Then there was Mr. Wolfowicz (ph). They\nhad the store, like in Wierzbnik; they had the store materials, sewing materials. He wasn\u2019t\nthat pleasant, but he was good at giving orders and stuff like that. He wasn\u2019t as pleasant,\nas matter of fact, he was a little mean, but he was good if people refused to do things, you\nknow, that they sent. Then, there was...Minzberg (ph), Wolfowicz (ph)... Wirenswiec\n(ph), Wirenswiec was - they had a - they had a liquor store, I mean, not a liquor store, a\nliquor restaurant or whatever you call it, a bar. And, you know, in Starachowice because\nthe Polacks, the minute - the minute they finished work, they got their pay they were\ngoing to drink vodka. So, he was quite well off, and he was okay. So, those were the four.",
        "Q: So, it\u2019s a small group.",
        "A: A small group.",
        "Q: And, what did you think of these folks and what they did?",
        "A: They - we had to have them, because otherwise the German would run it. So, they were\nrunning the - they were under Vaschek (ph). What I mean under Vaschek (ph), Vaschek\n(ph) supervised their work, that let\u2019s say if we needed supplies or something, they had to\ntell Vaschek (ph) and he would do those things or whatever, but they were trying the best\nthey could for the people in the camp. So, as I said, supplies and what else would they\ndo? Order and complaints, you know, I mean, when they didn\u2019t want to sleep with one\nanother, because there were two people to a cot. So, you know, they would solve all the\nproblems, inside problems.",
        "Q: Was there something like a court?",
        "A: There was, but they had nothing to say. They weren\u2019t - I mean their orders were what?\nPeople didn\u2019t listen to them. But they didn\u2019t go and squeal to Vaschek (ph), they had to\nsettle it, but they didn\u2019t have very much - they didn\u2019t have very much power. The same as\nAdash\u2019s, my husband\u2019s father. He was in charge of the police. He didn\u2019t have that much\npower. I mean, I saw how they - how the Germans were almost murdering him, giving\nhim orders. So, he screened and he did what he could, but, I mean, his power was limited.",
        "Q: So, what would happen if someone really was committing a crime? I don\u2019t mean a\nGerman definition.",
        "A: No, no, no, no - we would keep it quiet. Nobody would - nobody would squeal to the\nGermans, unless the Germans would find it out somewhere else. Like, we were always\nprotect - when I say we, there was Judenrat and the police - they were always protecting\nthe people. On the outside they had to - on the outside they had to pretend that they are -\nthat they are solving all the problems.",
        "Q: So, you really didn\u2019t have anyone in those positions who you thought were betraying the\nJews and trying to protect themselves.",
        "A: No, it was - how could they protect themselves? They were in the same shoes. I mean, the\npolicemen were - when we planned the uprising, all those strong people and the people\nwould only keep a secret, because you couldn\u2019t tell everybody - but the policemen were\nessential because they were all strong young men. So, when we were planning the - this -\nnot the...",
        "Q: The breakout?",
        "A: ...the breakup...out, the policemen were influential. They were organizing it. They were\norganizing the break.",
        "Q: When did you meet Adrian?",
        "A: I knew Adrian all my life, because he comes from the same town, but I had - when I went\nto Radom, I didn\u2019t see him - I saw him in camp, but at that time, I had another boyfriend.\nSo, actually I didn\u2019t identify with him. Firstly, because they were the orthodox people.",
        "Q: Adrian was?",
        "A: Adrian was, like his father, he wasn\u2019t, but his father was orthodox people. Secondly,\nsince they were religious, they didn\u2019t mix with the Zionists because they didn\u2019t believe in\nZionism. So, the groups were divided, you know. So, my mother - I always laugh when I\nsay this, what would she call me? Genius. I had to have a doctor for a husband, otherwise\nshe wouldn\u2019t accept him. So...",
        "Q: So, that\u2019s why you were dating this medical student?",
        "A: Yeah, she was so happy because he was, you know, that was a real find. She could tell all\nher friends her daughter is going with a medical student. But then, I met him after the\nwar, because I remember he helped us a lot, because we came to Lodz. We couldn\u2019t go\nanywhere. All the Jews went to Lodz after the war. They had a Judenrat there. So, we\nheard that his family lives there because he was in the partisan groups, and for him, the\nwar ended in January. For us, we didn\u2019t come until June. So, he already had his own\napartment, and so when we came, he said he would do anything for us. He found us. First\nof all, he asked us what we wanted to do. So, I wanted to go back to school. So, he found\n- he regist-... because he was the big shot. He was at that time a Polish officer. So, he\narranged for me this school, like, found this school that was for gifted people that was in\na half a year you could do a year. So, he found this school and he registered me there. He\nfound me a job, and he found us an apartment, and that\u2019s how we started going, and he\nwas sending me flowers every day to the office, to the house. That\u2019s how it started.",
        "Q: So, you weren\u2019t very close in the camp. You just knew him.",
        "A: I talked to him because we had a lot to do together, not only with him, with all the\npolicemen, because they were coming to the office every minute for whatever list they\nneeded or whatever order they needed, they had to come to the office.",
        "Q: So, he was one of the policemen whose father was the head of the police.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: I see. So, you\u2019re 18 in 1942 through this period. This 1s one of the worst years. Probably\nmore Jews are killed in 1942 than any other year.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Do you - are you hearing rumors from outside and...?",
        "A: Pll tell you what I heard also. My boyfriend got killed in such a manner. He was working\nas a chauffeur for the Germans. I mentioned that to you before. And the Germans were so\ngood to him because his boss was also a medical student. So, they had a lot in common\nand they really liked him, and they picked him up at the time from Wierzbnik - my\nboyfriend with his boss. They gave me all - they treated me as if I was - as if I wasn\u2019t\nJewish. And I remember, one of them, his boss went home, so he asked - my boyfriend\nasked him at the time to buy me a raincoat. He bought me the most beautiful raincoat - of\ncourse, my boyfriend paid for it. And then Busko was liquidated before Starachowice,\nand they send them all to Treblinka, the whole family. He was the only one who survived\nTreblinka and broke out of Treblinka. How? Because when he came, they were looking\nfor truck drivers. So, since he was a chauffeur for the Germans, he had very good\ncredentials. So, they picked, they took him. So, I heard the story from somebody else,\nbecause I never saw him again. I'll tell you later, but they said he was a truck driver.\nWhatever he was doing, he was going outside with the Germans. Apparently - he was\ndriving - apparently, at one time - he was a strong and tall man - apparently, he killed a\nGerman that he was driving and he ran away. And, when he ran away, he went back to\nBusko because they were quite wealthy people. They had all those hotels at the time. So,\nhe figured that when he goes to his friend, his boss that he will help him - he will help\nhim. Meanwhile - and I\u2019Il tell you how I found out about that, too - so, he went to Busko\nand he registered with his boss. He told him how he ran away. He most likely didn\u2019t tell\nhim that he killed a German, and - and the guy said to him that he should show him\nwhere the family wealth is. They had money, like gold and rings and jewelry, and hidden\nsomewhere on the property. So, he went with him and he showed it to him and he gave it\nto him, and the German killed him right on the spot. I found it out from a girl - like we\nhad...",
        "Q: Wait a second, I think we have to stop at this point. We don\u2019t? All right, then, continue",
        "A: So, PII just tell you how I found it out. We had an address. He gave me an address. He\nhad the Paliszewskis\u2019 and he gave me an address from a girl that - to write her if I ever\nwant to get in touch with him, because it was before the - it was 1940 or \u00b041. So, of\ncourse, after the war, I wrote the girl and she wrote me and told me the whole story. His\nboss killed him for the money.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019ll take a break and change.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Boy, that\u2019s quite a story.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: Tell me what your relationship was like with the sisters now. Are things changing?\nYou\u2019re now 18 years old, and Renia is 13, and Chris is 16. Do you have roles with each\nother?",
        "A: No, never. We were always - we tried to be always together, because we knew if\nsomething happens to one of us - like, we tried to keep together to defend one another.\nSo, in camp, actually, we slept together in one barrack. We went most - in our free time\nwe spent together, protecting each other. Renia was always scared. She was always\nsickly, I mean, a little bit sick, and she was always cold. She had to have - she was\nwearing all kinds of covers not to shiver. So, Renia was really - we had to take care of\nher.",
        "Q: Did you ever have conflicts with each other?",
        "A: Not really. I mean, not really conflicts. As I said - as my sister tells me now, I\u2019d give her\na punch here and there because her closet was better organized than mine or, you know,\nbut it wasn\u2019t important really. We always kept together.",
        "Q: And, how do you remember your father during this period? Do you now, after the...",
        "A: My father - I will tell you, my father was, when he lost his wife, he was very much to\nhimself. He was working in the office and - I don\u2019t remember going to him and\ncomplaining to him like I would to my mother or looking for protection of any sort\nbecause he was - he wasn\u2019t the way he was at home. He was a broken-down man. But, of\ncourse, we cared for him and we talked to him, but not the same way as to our mother.",
        "Q: So, that would have been true even if your mother had been there.",
        "A: Actually, maybe not to such a degree because he didn\u2019t take an active part, you know, in\nour when we were growing up. Like, I couldn\u2019t go to tell him and tell him a story that I\nfound a boyfriend or something, that I had a good time. I\u2019 Il tell it to my mother. But if I\nhad a report card, I would run to show it to him so he could be proud of it.",
        "Q: Do you think he knew that your mother was dead?",
        "A: Most definitely.",
        "Q: At that point?",
        "A: Definitely. Definitely.",
        "Q: And you? When did you think you...?",
        "A: I thought to myself at one time at the camp. I don\u2019t know whether it was to make us mad\nor whatever, one Ukrainian came in to the office once and told me that he saw my mother\nin a camp somewhere, that she\u2019s alive. So, we wanted to believe that that\u2019s true. But on\nthe other hand, if my mother was alive, she would have - and she knew that such and\nsuch Ukrainian, I mean, how would he know that she was my mother, but if she knew,\nshe would have written on a newspaper or something - she would send some kind of a\nsign, but how could she? They took them all, and then later after the war we found out\nthat everyone from Wierzbnik went to Treblinka and they were - they were right away\nkilled there. So, it was impossible that my mother survived the war. Why did he come to\nthe office just and told me that? I couldn\u2019t tell you.",
        "Q: Did you believe him then?",
        "A: At the time, I didn\u2019t know whether to believe him. I told my sisters about it and we\nwanted - when you want to believe, you believe. But, then we knew it\u2019s impossible.\nMaybe he made a mistake. How did he know that she was my mother? How did he know\nthat, I mean, he didn\u2019t know us. It was a strange Ukrainian. It wasn\u2019t one of the guards.\nHow did he come there to tell us? I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And did you see your father deteriorating during this period?",
        "A: Yes. He was - he wasn\u2019t as energetic as he used to be, because he was very energetic and\nhe was very resourceful and he wasn\u2019t. He was kept to himself, going to the office. He\nwas working there, and that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: So, that must have been very upsetting to you.",
        "A: Yes, very upsetting, yeah. But he still lived long enough to go to Auschwitz, where he\nperished.",
        "Q: I guess deterioration sometimes takes a long time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you get very sick with typhus?",
        "A: Very sick.",
        "Q: Were you the first of the three?",
        "A: I was one of the first ones. I don\u2019t remember. Renia says that one of them recovered\nbefore I, but I - I don\u2019t remember whether Renia or Krysia told me that I was really very\nsick, that I had a very high temperature and I was talking nonsense. I was delirious. But\nonce, when you were sick, like when you had typhus - first of all, when you had this high\nfever, this very high fever, you burned like anything, and even if you were delirious and\nyou were contagious, you weren\u2019t as sick as during the crisis - when the crisis came,\nwhen your temperature went right down, you couldn\u2019t move, and this was - if you\nsurvived the crisis, you lived. Otherwise - and then you, after a while, you were yourself,\nbut a lot of people didn\u2019t survive the crisis, and that was the time that I want to tell you\nabout Sulamite (ph). Because that was when typhus was so rampant, everybody was sick.\nThe Germans decided they\u2019d have to kill off the people that are sick. So, what they did,\nthe decided, the army came in. It was as they - it wasn\u2019t - 1t wasn\u2019t because they needed\nsoldiers to put all the sick ones on the truck to take them out. So, what they did, they told\nthe policemen that everybody had to come out of the barracks, whether he was sick or\nhealthy, and the Germans were watching them and asked them to run. Whoever could run\n- the sick ones with the fever could run - but the ones that were just going through the\ncrisis, they couldn\u2019t. So, those were put on the truck, and they called me from the office\nto write down the names of the people that were going on the trucks. Also, at that time,\nevery policeman was - every policeman was responsible for a group, for a few barracks\nor one barrack, I forget how it was, but the policemen were responsible that everyone that\nwas in the barrack came out. So, at that time, I remember, my sister-in-law, like my\nhusband\u2019s sister\u2019s husband was also a policeman, he hid somebody there and covered\nbecause they person couldn\u2019t walk. So, later after what happened when they found the\nsick one there covered, you know, and very sick, they killed the policeman. Cogord (ph)\nwas killed right on the spot. Then, as I was writing the names - I had two very good\nfriends from Lodz, two very intelligent, beautiful, two tall girls - I forgot whether they\nwere twins, but they were always together. One\u2019s name was Sulamite (ph), and the other\nMira (ph). One went through quickly, like she ran through, and this Sulamite (ph)\ncouldn\u2019t run, she just - because the reason for it was she was in crisis, and she runned, he\nsent her to, for me to write her name down. So, I thought that they will take her to the\ntruck. So, I asked - I didn\u2019t know those people because they came especially for that\nfunction. They were Becker\u2019s people. You know, Becker was outside the Lagers.\nSicherheit Polizei or whatever you call it - Sicherheit Deist, I think they were called. So,\nthose people were assigned this function. So, I said to the guy that was standing near me,\n\u201cPlease leave her. She\u2019s my best friend.\u201d So, he says, \u201cOh, she is, eh?\u201d He took out the\ngun and killed her right in my presence. So, I remember that - I didn\u2019t remember - I don\u2019t\nremember what happened to me because I fainted, but the policemen later told me they\ngot me quickly off my job, put me in the police barracks, covered me there, and the\npoliceman was writing down the names after later. So, that was very traumatic to me\nbecause I saw it with my own eye. I mean, it wasn\u2019t her fault. She was sick, and all I did,\nI felt - I felt guilty because I told him she was my friend, but I thought that if I would tell\nhim that she was friend, that he would spare her life, but he just killed her.",
        "Q: So, in some sense, you think you\u2019re responsible for that?",
        "A: I felt that - I thought that maybe if I would have leaved her or something, but I said,\n\u2018\u201cShe\u2019s my best friend, please leave her. Let her go.\u201d So, he killed her.",
        "Q: Was that the first time you saw anything quite like that?",
        "A: No, things happened before when Altov (ph) was killing. I remember, one day he made\none Jew dance, like, I don\u2019t know, he - he - and he killed him there, and then I watched\nfrom the office window when he killed him, they called the Ukrainian to take him away,\nso the Ukrainian caught him by the legs, and the camp was full of sand or something. So,\nhe was dragging - not dragging, running with him, wherever they told him to take him,\nand you know all this sand was - how should I say - covering the face of this Jewish man.\nSo, I saw a few people that were killed and by Atlov (ph), I mean, you know, nobody\nlooked, but when he came and he always killed a few people.",
        "Q: What sort of affect does this have on you? Do you stop feeling things? I mean, as you\nstart seeing so much brutality, what...?",
        "A: Well, it was traumatic. It was traumatic, very traumatic, and it made us cry, but we\ncouldn\u2019t help it. I mean, we got so used to it that at night, when we were in the barrack,\nwe sang. Like, we would always, there were songs - special camp songs. They were\ndifferent from the songs that we sang in the past. Today\u2019s your turn and tomorrow\u2019s\ngoing to be our turn. So, we never knew whose turn it was going to be. So, we really\ndidn\u2019t care. We wanted to live - life, the will for life was very strong, but not to a point to,\nyou know, to such - because we knew that today\u2019s their turn, and tomorrow\u2019s going to be\nours.",
        "Q: Tell me something. I don\u2019t know whether you know this, when you fainted, when your\nfriend Sulamite (ph) was killed, and the police grabbed you and put you in the...",
        "A: The Jewish police.",
        "Q: Right, the Jewish police, I understand.",
        "A: They took me - the barrack was very close to where we were arriving, the police barrack.\nIt wasn\u2019t a barrack - it wasn\u2019t my barrack. It was the police - you know, they had their - if\nyou want to call it office there, and their beds there.",
        "Q: And, we - the security police didn\u2019t stop them. It didn\u2019t matter that they took you away, I\nguess.",
        "A: That\u2019s what they told me, because I fainted, but they told me that they grabbed me and\nthey said, \u201cAh, she\u2019s no good,\u201d or whatever they said, they took me to the barrack and\none of the policemen took over.",
        "Q: How long were you in the police barrack? Do you know?",
        "A: After the finished with it all, the truck went away. I know - to tell you the truth, I know\nhow they were killed because they were making all these graves outside the barrack. I\ndon\u2019t know how many people. I don\u2019t remember because right after that, 1t was very bad\nwhen I had to put down \u2018deceased\u2019 for those people.",
        "Q: Does it take you a while to get over the death of Sulamite (ph)?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, until today I can\u2019t forget it.",

        "A: Sulamite (ph).",
        "Q: From Lodz?",
        "A: From Lodz? They were Mira and Sulamite (ph). Mira is still alive, but I don\u2019t remember\nthe name. They were from Lodz, and they were also teacher. They, you know, every girl\nthat was in Wierzbnik, like going back here, every girl that knew how to read was a\nteacher.",
        "Q: When people were shot, some people died of disease, right?",
        "A: Very few people. Typhus, typhus was the biggest killer.",
        "Q: Not starvation?",
        "A: Not starvation. No, not in Starachowice, no.",
        "Q: And, every name was given to you.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Even if Altov (ph) came in and shot somebody.",
        "A: So, we took the card out and I would write down \u201cdead\u201d\u2019\u2019, \u201cdeceased\u201d.",
        "Q: And, who would tell you the name of the person? Because Altov (ph) wouldn\u2019t know\nwho he\u2019s killing.",
        "A: No, but the police...",
        "Q: Would know?",
        "A: They would - you know, they were inside. I mean, they would report to me, so that we\ncould take them off the list. And Vaschek (ph), I mean, you know, he was there every\nday.",
        "Q: So, this was clearly the worst part of your job.",
        "A: The worst.",
        "Q: To write down...",
        "A: To write down \u2018deceased\u2019, but if I didn\u2019t know the people - I mean, I got so used to it\nbecause it happened quite often, I would say. So, if I didn\u2019t know the face of that person,\nit was just a name, it was different than when I had to write that Sulamite (ph) was dead.",
        "Q: Help me to understand something, because there are people who, when you\u2019re afraid, are\nyou constantly afraid or does the terror go up and down? Because you have to watch all\nthe time, that\u2019s clear.",
        "A: All the time.",
        "Q: Right? So, is there a funny feeling in the pit of your...?",
        "A: I\u2019m going to tell you something that I\u2019m embarrassed to admit, but it\u2019s true. I believed,\nalthough I was - I\u2019m really a non-believer. In camp, I believed that God 1s taking care of\nme, that nothing could happen to me. I\u2019m embarrassed to admit because I wasn\u2019t\nreligious and I didn\u2019t earn this special privilege. But somehow - I even told my sisters\nduring selections in Auschwitz, \u201cIf I\u2019m sent there go after me, because God is watching\nover me.\u201d Because you know like I went through so much and nothing - I cannot say that\nnothing happened to me because all those incidents that I\u2019m tell you about were very\ntraumatic, but somehow I believed - I somehow believed in God, that he\u2019s watching over\nme.",
        "Q: Where do you think that came from?",
        "A: Pll tell you, I just don\u2019t know, because things happened to me many times - like, things\nhappening, like people were helping me. So, I thought that God sent them.",
        "Q: So, you might be a believer in angels or something.",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t believe in anything. But during the camp, I really and truly - and I said I\ndidn\u2019t earn this because I wasn\u2019t religious before, and I wasn\u2019t religious after, so I didn\u2019t\nearn God\u2019s special attention - but that\u2019s why I believe that he\u2019s taking care of me.",
        "Q: Were you...",
        "A: Because I figured, how come that I wasn\u2019t in the marketplace when the things happened?\nHow come the German that took me hitchhiking didn\u2019t kill me on the spot? I mean, he\ndidn\u2019t even have to make any excuses. How come he didn\u2019t kill me then? And I had a lot\nof happenings that [Il tell you later. How come that nothing...? I mean, I was right there\nand somebody - somebody helped me. So, that\u2019s why I believe that God is watching over\nme.",
        "Q: This is going to leap - just for a second - leap forward and then we\u2019ll go back. Were you\nwith the Paliszewski when Chris was told about what your mother said.",
        "A: No, what happened - no, with Paliszewski I was there, but I will tell you that this goes\nalready after the liberation. Since you asked for Paliszewski, you know the Polacks killed\nthose Einisemann kids and Wolfowicz\u2019s kids, and we were in Stratachowice at the time.\nWe came to visit the Paliszewskis. And that day when they killed the whole families\nincluding the Einisemanns, the Wolfowiczs, together with the kids that survived the war,\nbeing small kids like seven or nine or eight, you know. They knocked at the door at\nPaliszewski and they said - Polish partisans or who knows, Polish anti-Semites - they\nknocked at the door and they said to Paliszewski, \u201cI know that Laksuvnas (ph) are here,\nand we want them.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t let them have it - Krysia remembers that she said, \u201cI\nwon\u2019t let you have them.\u201d But I remember that she said, \u201cWhat do you mean? I wouldn\u2019t\nkeep Jewish people here.\u201d I remember that way, that she said that, that when they went\naway, like, they came to kill us. I mean, specifically they asked for us. The next morning,\nthe husband of one of the Paliszewskis took us in a horse and wagon thing, covered us\nwith straw and took us to another - to Skarzysko, which was a little bit further away, so\nthat we can go to Lodz, that nobody will know that he\u2019s helping us. You asked for the\nPaliszewski story.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you another part of the story because what I heard from Chris was that\nyour mother, the day before the liquidation of the ghetto, came to Paliszewski...",
        "A: No, my mother couldn\u2019t have come to Paliszewski. No, she couldn\u2019t have because she\nwent to - before maybe she went.",
        "Q: No, before.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, before. Because she\u2019s was taken to Treblinka.",
        "Q: But the day before or two days before or something, she came to give her some things.\nAnd Chris said, this is what she heard, that your mother told her that if only my three\ndaughters will survive, I will give my life.",
        "A: Yeah, she said that. She said that to me. She said in Jewish, because she never spoke in\nJewish to us. She always Polish, but she in Jewish to me that if you survive, I would like\nto be the orben (ph), the sacrifice. That\u2019s what - she said it in Polish, but she used this\nHebrew word.",
        "Q: She said this to you?",
        "A: To me. She says, \u201cI hope that three of - I want to be your orben (ph),\u201d or whatever, like,\nshe said it in Jewish.",
        "Q: What did that make you feel?",
        "A: That means that I want to be victim, so that you can live. She said that to me, and she\ncould\u2019ve said it to Paliszewski because she could have - Paliszewskis\u2019 was our point of\nmeeting after the war. They were very good friend of ours. So, we always used to tell\nthem everything.",
        "Q: That\u2019s quite something for your mother to have said to you.",
        "A: Yeah, she said it to me. I remember it all the time, and I never believed - that was a\ncouple of days before, before the - I remember it.",
        "Q: So, who should we talk about? Tobah (ph)? Adrian\u2019s escape? Which do you want to start\nwith?",
        "A: Because everything happened the same time. So, maybe I\u2019Il start with Tobah (ph)\nbecause maybe it will be shorter. I don\u2019t know that much about her, but about my\nhusband\u2019s escape and the way that he bought the gun and stuff like that, it might be a\nlittle longer. So, Tobah (ph) - one day Becker, who was the Sicherheit Deist, came in a\ncar with another German soldiers and they came and asked for Tobah (ph), and they took\nher out of the camp. We didn\u2019t know why. Then, she came back. We didn\u2019t know why.\nThen, a few days later, he came for Tobah (ph) again. Took her himself already. He took\nher out again. He was very polite. I remember because I was near the office, like they\nbrought her to the office, and you know, I could look through the window and see. He\nopened the door for her, like if she was - like a girl, and he took her out and he brought\nher back the same day. The third time, he took her out - I don\u2019t know if it was a few days\nor a week or two later - he took her out and he never brought her back. Now, that day, he\nwas ordered - her father was ordered to, to dig a grave, and of course, it was like, they\ncalled him to work. He didn\u2019t know it was going to be for him. So, he started digging but\nhe was an older man. It took him a little time. So, Schrodt came out of his office, and he\ntook the gun and killed him on the spot. The grave wasn\u2019t dug exactly - like, the grave\nwas half-finished and he called other workers to cover him. And she never came back.\nThen we found out, because they were from Opatow - it was about, I would say, about 40\nkilometers away from Wierzbnik. Apparently, they had money - money or some goods or\nsome jewelry. I don\u2019t know. She must have showed it to them, and after they got\nwhatever they wanted, you know, the money, they just killed her. I didn\u2019t know what\nhappened to her because they didn\u2019t bring her to camp, but I was talking to the professor\nabout her because he had - he had her - heard the story and his records. He told me that\nhe asked, whether he asked himself or whether one of those people that he - that he was\ntalking to told him that she was - the grave was found later in the woods very close to\nwhere she lived - where they lived, where they found the treasures. So, this was Tobjah\nWeisblum (ph) that\u2019s how she perished, and her father, for money. Not only because they\nwere Jews, but because they had money.",
        "Q: Why did they kill the father, do you think, at the moment?",
        "A: Because I suppose they decided they didn\u2019t want to have any witnesses because nobody\nknew why Tobjah Weisblum (ph) was taken out, nobody knew, and she never told\nanybody.",
        "Q: But the father knew?",
        "A: The father probably didn\u2019t knew.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t know?",
        "A: Didn\u2019t know what for they are taking her out. Because he was - when he was digging the\ngrave, it was an older man as I say, he never suspected that that was for him, but Schrodt\nkilled him even before he finished. Like, he just killed him in front, like during the\ndaytime, when everybody looked on.",
        "Q: Did you see that killing?",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t near the grave then. No, but of course, I was the one that wrote down\n\u2018deceased\u2019.",
        "Q: Okay, I think we\u2019ll change the tape now.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "Q: Hania, before we go onto the next story, I\u2019m just wondering if you have a sense if there\nwas different treatment of men and women. Was there anything about the women\u2019s part\nof the camp that was different then the men? Were women afraid of being mistreated as\nwomen, not just being brutalized, but sexually?",
        "A: Actually, it would be - to them, it would be a sacrilege to talk to - not to talk to associate\nwith any Jewish girl, because the Jews were not people. They were animals. So, you are\ntalking about the people in the camp, the people that lived in camp or the Germans.",
        "Q: There are two sets of possible relationships. One is between the prisoners, right?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And, then there is between the guards. Now, there were Ukrainian guards, and I\u2019m\nwondering, they didn\u2019t have Ros Hashanda (ph).",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t have Ros Hashanda (ph).",
        "Q: So, they wouldn\u2019t be necessarily...",
        "A: Well, they were - maybe they treated the women a little bit better, but I don\u2019t think. When\nI say \u201cbetter\u201d, we have nothing to do with them, but maybe they wouldn\u2019t push us or hit\nus or whatever, but I don\u2019t think the Ukrainians would dare, or whether they would dare\nor whether the Jewish girls would go with Ukrainians. I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Were women able to be in contact with men in the camp?",
        "A: To a certain point. As a matter of fact, certain names maybe I should mention, it must\nhave been Mr. Billenswiec had a - because his wife was there, too - and everybody knew\nthat he had a lover there, a woman from Lodz, but that was - everybody knew about it,\nand - because see the camp, the camp had separate barracks for women and separate for\nmen. So, if they met together it must have been during the day sometime, so the barrack\nwas open for everybody to see. It wasn\u2019t that they had separate rooms or anything,\nbecause we had - it was like a cot underneath and another one above. It was good for two\npeople, but like people were saying, \u201cOh, this one or that one,\u201d but that was about the\ninmates. But you know people, I think that people behaved a little better in camps. What I\nmeant - I mean, there was nowhere to go, you had to do it - if you wanted to do it,\neverybody could watch. I don\u2019t know how many people got into a barrack. I was asked\nthe same question by the historian. So I said, at night, the women were separated because,\nyou know, there was no movement from one barrack to another, but during the day,\nmaybe.",
        "Q: Tell me, did you menstruate in the camp.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Not in Auschwitz, though.",
        "Q: But in Majowka.",
        "A: In Majowka and Strzelnica, yes.",
        "Q: How did you take care of yourself?",
        "A: You know, you\u2019re asking me questions, and I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t\nremember. I really don\u2019t. We must have had some way to do it, but I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: So, you were not starved enough so that you couldn\u2019t get your period. Did women get\npregnant in this camp?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No one got pregnant?",
        "A: No one. I don\u2019t know of anybody. They would be afraid to get pregnant, I suppose. Even\nif they had a relationship with their husband, there were husbands and wives there, but\nthey were separated. And I, so I - to tell you the truth, I don\u2019t remember having any\nproblems with protecting - not protecting ourselves, but keeping ourselves clean. I don\u2019t\nremember.",
        "Q: It is possible that some women came into the camp pregnant, however, even...?",
        "A: No, there were some children in the camp that were already the children, not too many.\nEinisemann (ph) had his kids. Wolfowicz (ph) had his kids. Vera Veislava (ph) had a son,\na young son, and he survived. She was from Lodz. There were several kids, but I would\nsay not more than ten.",
        "Q: Shall we talk about the escape and the plans for the escape? This is from 1943.",
        "A: Yes. So, what happened - the conditions were worse and worse and, you know, when\nthings were happening, a group of people decided that we have to make an uprising and\nto liberate the camp. It was an idea that we didn\u2019t know how to achieve it, but we knew\none thing: that we have to get arms, some kinds of guns and stuff like that. And this was\nvery secretive. All the policemen knew about it, because they were young and strong\npeople, and some people, but you know, some people that belonged to the group or was\ntold about it, but not everybody knew about the preparations or the intentions because we\nwere afraid that we could be denounced and killed. So, anyway, we decided - everything\nwas secret - and we decided that Adrian was the best one to acquire - he volunteered\nbecause he was very good at schmoozing and talking people into it. So, we decided he\u2019s\ngoing to buy guns. We would collect whatever we can from the Ukrainians because when\nthey were going home, they had to give their guns away and they went to get the guns\nwhen they came back to work. They didn\u2019t keep the guns with them. So, when they - that\nthey were supposed to steal - the first gun was purchased, and my husband had it. He was\nthe one to purchase this gun.",
        "Q: Where did he...?",
        "A: Where did he keep it? I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: No, where did it get it from?",
        "A: From a Ukrainian, a guard, bought it. They paid for it through the nose with the collected,\nwhatever we could collect. And he talked to one Ukrainian, and this Ukrainian agreed\nthat he would be selling guns for such and such a price. I don\u2019t remember what it was,\nwhether it was in gold or whether it was in money or whether it was in other things.\nWhen I say other things, some people were, in Wierzbnik, like if we left a lot of things -\nvaluables - not only gold and silver, but other valuables like blankets and furniture and all\nthis. So, you know, we could tell the Ukrainian go to such and such, and we have the,\nlet\u2019s say, two watches or something. Take the two watches and bring me a gun. I don\u2019t\nremember exactly how he got the first gun because that\u2019s as far as he got, the first gun.\nOn the second try, they caught the Ukrainian, when he was stealing. Instead of taking one\ngun with him or whatever, they caught him stealing - they found two guns in his\npossession when he - whatever. So, of course, they investigated and they interrogated him\nand he said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know the name, but there 1s one of the policemen.\u201d So, they\nlined up the policemen, all twelve of them, and the Ukrainian came in and of course he\nsold it to Adrian, so he went there and he showed, \u201cThis is the policeman that bought\nfrom me the gun.\u201d Right away, Becker came in and he started interrogating my husband,\nand my husband said, Adrian, he says, \u201cI never bought from him a gun. I don\u2019t know\nhim. I didn\u2019t - I never saw him.\u201d But, of course, they didn\u2019t believe him. He was\ninterrogated and we had such a bunker, a small bunker that was made out of concrete.\nThey put him there for a while, and then Judenrat went to Becker, and Becker came in\nand he said that he is lying, that Adrian is lying, because the Ukrainian didn\u2019t have any\nproblems finding him, and he\u2019s going to be condemned to death. So, the Judenrat decided\nthat - Becker you can buy him. This is the guy who took out , SO, he says, \u201cOkay, if\nyou give me...\u201d No, the Jew said, the Judenrat said to him, \u201cHow do you know? Maybe\nhe\u2019s lying. Why not put him somewhere like lock him up until we find out, until the\ninvestigation 1s through. If this is true what happened, then he should be killed, but how\nyou can take an innocent man? I mean the Ukrainian, maybe he had another reason why\nhe showed that this is the guy that bought from him the gun.\u201d So, they agreed. They put\nhim in this bunker, and he had to dig his own grave, and Becker, not Becker, the other,\nthe Baumgarten read, he read, you know, he read to him the order, that because he bought\nthe gun from the Ukrainian and because he is key of an uprising, he\u2019s condemned to\ndeath. He said it in the name of Adolf Hitler, and whatever it 1s, and so he read this to\nhim, and this was the first time that a grave was dug up and they had no body, because\nthey kept him there and then when he got his money, they wanted a kilo of gold. A kilo\nof gold, but we didn\u2019t have gold, so everybody, if they hid some ring or whatever, even\nteeth they were putting in their head, and what happened, they went to Becker and this\nBaumgarten to say, \u201cNow, you can start the investigation.\u201d So, in order for him not to be\nable to escape, they took him out of the bunker, took two Ukrainians, they covered his\nhead - like, they put him on a bench, took off his clothes, put a sack, you know, like a\nsack hat you put potatoes in or sugar or whatever with holes in it? They put it over the\nhead. They took two rubber sticks or whatever and they had such whips - whatever you\ncall it - and they told him that he would get now a hundred whips and he has to count. So,\nyou know, one, two, three... Adrian said after the twentieth whip, his body was numb. He\nsays he couldn\u2019t even feel anything. He didn\u2019t care. So, anyway, after they did that, they\nput him back into the police barrack there, because they figured that after his body was\nblack and blue and red and bloody. But he was a very strong boy, and don\u2019t forget that in\n1943 he was nineteen. So, I mean, he was a young, strong boy. They put him in the\nbarrack and they said, \u201cThis is only so that he can\u2019t escape or can\u2019t do anything.\u201d So, they\ntook him from the bunker because he couldn\u2019t breathe there, and they put him in the\nbarrack, and the next day they called in appel. Everybody had to go to the - everybody\nhad to an appel so that they could tell them that what happens if - everybody will be shot\nwho will take part, that if things like this, if people want to escape, if anybody escapes\nthey will kill ten people for each one that escapes, and in addition, they are not going to -\nbecause somebody - they didn\u2019t say it anymore that Adrian bought the gun - somebody\nbought the gun for a certain purpose. They didn\u2019t know about the gun that already\nexisted. They were talking about the gun that they caught the Ukrainian with, you know?\nThere must be a reason why they wanted the gun, and while they were doing it, the guys\nthat were thinking of escaping, of the uprising, they decided that when they visited\nAdrian later, when he was so sick, that they had to escape at the first opportunity. So,\nwhen everybody was standing at the appel and they were saying that, the policemen were\nmoving because they were always helping to round up people. So, they went to Adrian\u2019s\nroom. They took him out. They had some shears, and they decided, because the\nUkrainians were also watching us inside - not outside, the only Ukrainian that was okay\nwas kept, was on the gate. But they decided to cut - there was ten of them, ten young\npeople. I don\u2019t know how many policemen, but I think about two or three policemen. The\nrest were young boys that were always in contact to do the uprising. So, while they were\ntalking and we were watched by the Ukrainians and the policemen moving around, they\ncut the barbed wire and my husband, like Adrian was at the time, you can imagine, after\nhe got those lashes the night before or the day before. They jumped over the fence and\nstarted running. They had to run quickly over the road because on the other side of the\nroad there were forests and the Germans usually, like, all they wanted 1s to get to the\nforest as fast as they could. But meanwhile Schrodt, the guy that was watching, he started\nshooting. So, immediately they took all the Ukrainians and Schrodt was in charge. He\nhad a motorcycle and he started running after them. But until they found they were a little\nbit further. So, anyway they managed to go to the forest and the Ukrainians and Schrodt\ncame back and Schrodt said to Vaschek (ph), like they said, \u201cI am telling you, the young\nWilczek (ph) \u00bb which in German means the younger Wilczek (ph) I killed\npersonally. So, we all thought that he\u2019s dead, like his mother and his sister assumed that\nhe\u2019s completely dead. Meanwhile, the ten of them managed to go to the forest, and what\nare they going to do? I mean, they run away the way they were. Nothing - they had\nnothing on them. They had no guns, no knives, I mean, I don\u2019t know why Adrian didn\u2019t\ntake his gun. I never asked him that question, but when they reached the forest, they were\nvery happy. And we had three kinds of partisans in the forest. One - I\u2019Il name them by the\nPolish name, and then I\u2019ll try to translate. One was Armia Rudowa (ph), which means the\nPeople\u2019s Army. This was run by the Russians. It was a Communist party under Russian\nsupervision, and they were taking everybody, like not everybody. They were accepting\npeople that when they needed them. The second group was called Armia Kryowa (ph),\nwhich means the home army. Those were Polacks, those were Polish people. They\nwouldn\u2019t accept Jews, but they would accept Polish people. They didn\u2019t kill the Jews.\nThey hated them, but they didn\u2019t kill them. But then there was an /nnoset (ph) which was\na partisan group that were like Nazi, National Polish Organization that they were killing\nthe Jews like if they met them - the real anti-Semites. So, anyway, they were sitting there.\nI remember four names - three names - four names. I remember four names of the\nescapees. I don\u2019t remember the rest. So, it was Adrian. It was a guy Salik Anulevicz (ph),\nhe was the real first cousin of Daniel Levicz (ph) from Warsaw ghetto. And, the third one\nwas Freumik Singer (ph), he was from Opatow - he was related to Tobjah Weisblum\n(ph), and the fourth one was James Levy (ph), he was also a policeman, and there were\nsix others, but I really don\u2019t remember their names now. So, as they were waiting in the\nforest, the Russian group came by. So, they told them that they are from camp escapees\nand so on. So the guys said, \u201cI can\u2019t take ten. We can\u2019t take ten. We don\u2019t have room for\nten. We don\u2019t have arms for ten.\u201d Because the supplies came directly from Russia by\nplane. So, they couldn\u2019t take so many. So, he says, \u201cWe can only take two of you.\u201d So, he\npicked up this Freumik (ph) from Opatow and they picked Adrian. And, he says, \u201cAnd\nyou stay here, maybe the next group will take you because we don\u2019t have room.\u201d There\nwas apparently 25 of them in this group, this Russian group. So, there were 27 of them.\nThen - so, I will now speak about them, and I'll come back later to those. I\u2019Il say what\nhappened to them later. So, anyway they started to - they needed miner. What I mean\nminers - the ones who will put mines under bridges so that the German arms couldn\u2019t put\nthem in trains like - what they had to do, they had to put mines under the bridges, but the\nmines were not like today\u2019s sophisticated. They had their mine. They had the string. They\nhad to first go by boat, don\u2019t forget the Germans were watching. They were over every\nbridge, there were German soldiers walking back and forth because that\u2019s what they were\nafraid of, that the bridges would be mined. So, they had to swim or go by such a boat that\ncouldn\u2019t hear anything under the bridge, put the mine there, go far enough with the string,\nwait until the train comes - goes by, and pull it. It was a very dangerous job, and very\nspecialized because when the Germans were up there, if they heard anybody in the river,\nthey were shooting them right away. So, that was a very - the two Jewish boys that were\naccepted, Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were doing those jobs, and now, they had\ndifferent encounters with the Germans looking for them, but the Germans were always\nafraid to go straight to the forest. They had people that were in the village, Polish villages\nthat were telling them about the movement of the Germans and where they were going,\nand whether they were coming, what happened here and there. So, they had contact with\nthe world. They had enough to eat there. I mean, not that they were given special - like\nAdrian says, they would bring them a glop of pork, you know, the fat, and they would\njust eat half a pound to a pound of it, no bread or anything because it depends on what\nthey had and brought in, and he says, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe what I could eat - this pure\nfat.\u201d And, they could really eat the pound of fat without anything. So, they weren\u2019t really\nhungry. They slept in the woods, and they were doing the mine work. That was their\nwork.",
        "Q: Now, when the Russian...",
        "A: I will tell you about the others.",
        "Q: But, I wanted to ask you, there was no question about whether these guys were Jewish, or\nthey said they were not Jewish?",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t say. And, they knew that they were Jewish, and to such a point they said\nthat they are happy that Adrian had the name Wilczek (ph) which means \u201c\u2018little wolf\u201d\nbecause everybody in the partisan group had a nickname and the nickname was an\nanimal. Do you know what I mean? Like, he was called a cat, a dog, whatever. So, he had\n- his name \u201clittle wolf\u2019 was suitable, but they knew that they were Jewish.",
        "Q: Tell me something, Adrian\u2019s physical condition then... Did anybody take care of him?",
        "A: And, you know what? That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to say. At first, they let him rest because\nthey told them what happened. So, those were the Russians, mostly Russians there.\nAnyway, one day, he got so sick, he got delirious, so they said they had to move for\nwhatever reason, and they told him that they can\u2019t take him because he couldn\u2019t walk. So,\nhe asked them to kill him. He said, \u201cMaybe if you kill me because I...\u201d But they couldn\u2019t\nkill him. So, they gave him, like, they gave him a gun. They covered him up. They gave\nhim all the food they had, and they left him there. They kissed him and they said, \u201cWe\nare very sorry,\u201d because they left him there to die because he was so sick. So some\npeople were going by the woods and they found him and they took him - some Polacks,\nmost of them were collaborating with the partisans. They were the people that were\nsaying where the Germans are. So, they took him home and they, and it took him ten days\nand he was better. So, he decided to go back to his group. When he went to his - before\nhe went out, he contacted one of those people that they were in contact with, and he said,\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to tell you that somebody denounced the group, the Russian group. The\nGermans came in while they were asleep in there, and...and one of the - where they kept\nhorses or cows or whatever - one of those buildings, they put it afire and everybody got\nkilled. So, he felt so bad, but, I mean, he couldn\u2019t believe it. So, he went... he went back\nto the woods, after he felt better, and he decided he\u2019|I wait for another group. I'll tell you\nmore about the others that were left, the eight that were left, but I have to finish this story\nfirst. So...",
        "Q: Maybe we should stop so you can continue.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t want you to get caught in the middle.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "Q: Hania, before we go back to Adrian in the woods, let\u2019s talk just a little bit about him\ngetting a gun and where you think he may left it, if you have any idea, and did he have\nany experience with guns?",
        "A: He - he was a Jewish boy. He never had - he wasn\u2019t violent. He never saw a gun in his\nlife. I don\u2019t think if he was given a gun whether he knew what to do with it unless\nsomeone will tell him or show him. I don\u2019t know whether the gun was - the gun that he\nbought and he - from the Ukrainian guard - whether the gun was at all operational, and\nwhether - I couldn\u2019t tell you, maybe it was, maybe it was one of the best, but even if he\nhad it, he wouldn\u2019t know how to use it unless someone would show it to him. So...",
        "Q: So, tell me, of these boys who were planning the break-out...",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And, you were involved, too.",
        "A: I was involved.",
        "Q: Right, were there other women involved as well?",
        "A: I was involved. Some women were involved because we\u2019re talking about uprising. So,\nthe women were also involved. Like, we didn\u2019t think it would be so fast. We thought that\nit would take us time first of all to arms and to be prepared and to-to-to-to prepare a\nstrata-strategy. It wasn\u2019t - this was just the beginning. We had no idea what\u2019s - what\u2019s\ngoing to be after, and we had to be very, very careful and secretive because I think like\nthat, if the Germans would have found out, it would\u2019ve been death to all of us.",
        "Q: So, how many of you would there have been, fifteen, twenty people?",
        "A: That\u2019s the most - all the policemen were involved in it, because they - they were the\nstrongest and they were the ones that were supposed to know how to do that, and a few\nother people.",
        "Q: And, when would you meet and discuss this?",
        "A: One would tell - we didn\u2019t meet. They would - one of the policemen would come to me\nand tell me what they decided. One would tell the other one who\u2019d tell - we didn\u2019t meet.\nThere wasn\u2019t no meeting. I mean, how could you make a meeting?",
        "Q: No, I thought that might be the case, but one doesn\u2019t know how those things happen.",
        "A: We knew that the policemen were the - the initiators of that. So, I knew it, and maybe - I\ndon\u2019t know if Chris knew it because she was too young to know about it. Maybe she did.\nI couldn\u2019t tell you, and there was a few people, so I would say if they would tell me to tell\nso and so, but not in certain - we didn\u2019t have meetings. We couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: So was there one person who was the leader who then made the decision?",
        "A: I think that my - that Adrian was the best at it because - because he knew how to talk to\npeople - how to talk to those Ukrainians to get what he wanted. He was the type of a\nperson that - that he knew how to - to get things.",
        "Q: And who had experience with arms in this?",
        "A: Nobody, nobody, even the policemen, they didn\u2019t carry anything in their hands. I mean,\nI\u2019m talking the Jewish policemen. I mean, they were only assigned a certain job and they\nwere - there was a good job, you know, by comparison, you know, and they didn\u2019t have\nto go to the factory and - and work at the iron stove where it was so hot that they couldn\u2019t\nbreathe. So, they - they were glad that they had this job, but they were - they were all\nthinking of uprising and getting rid of because we were too long - too long we listened to\nthat - we went like sheep to do that.",
        "Q: So, when you all were thinking about this separately - because clearly you\u2019re not\nsupposed to have conversations because it\u2019s too dangerous, right?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s too dangerous, and I\u2019ll tell you, I couldn\u2019t take a part in the running away,\nanyway, because they told us that if someone runs away, first the family and then ten\nother people and there were cases where they killed ten people for one. If one escaped,\nthey would round up ten people and kill them - shot them.",
        "Q: So, you were not going to take any chance.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t because I had my father and my two sisters. You couldn\u2019t take Renia with\nyou, but, you know, if I took part in it and knew what was going on, and in case - listen,\nwe didn\u2019t - we didn\u2019t expect that everybody - everybody would carry a gun. First we had\nto get the guns. I mean, the idea started - came to us, and we tried, but we weren\u2019t\nsuccessful because we just started.",
        "Q: But, was the idea that all fifteen or twenty, as many as...",
        "A: As many as possible. That\u2019s why ten of them - ten of them were from this group. The ten\npeople were from this group that ran away that night - that day.",
        "Q: And the idea was for that group, whatever the fifteen or whoever many of that group\ncould run away.",
        "A: Run away, and then - and then come and do something with, you know, like to maybe to\nget other guns somewhere else. Go to see the partisans and come back and - and - and\nfree all of us, but it was a stupid idea, but nobody - like you - you didn\u2019t believe, but you\nhad to believe that something would be done that we are not going to be killed like, you\nknow, like just go voluntarily to just be killed because the way we saw it, we didn\u2019t know\nabout - about what happened in Treblinka. We didn\u2019t know that there was an Auschwitz,\nbut it was enough that any German can - could come and kill anybody and, I mean, how\ndid we know? Maybe one day all of them would just, keep shooting until they shoot us\nall. So, those ten that ran away, they were from this group, and they had the best\nopportunity because the guards weren\u2019t there - only one guard. The Germans and\neverybody, they round us all up to teach us a lesson.",
        "Q: So, now Adrian having gotten better, and his...",
        "A: He came - he came to - he come - he\u2019s in the woods, but of course, already half his time -\nlike he was there for a long time with them, because I didn\u2019t tell you, that all he did was\nthe mines and stuff like that. I didn\u2019t tell you everything that happened because it wasn\u2019t\nimportant, but now - now it\u2019s already close to - already \u00b044.",
        "Q: So, he\u2019s with them almost a year or six months?",
        "A: Yes, he\u2019s been with them for a long time, but that\u2019s when he got sick and they left him.\nLike, he was working every day that he had another assignment. Most of them, he was a\nspecialist in mining. He was - I mean, working so long every day at it, he was a specialist\nin it. Because they had to observe the - the bridge going up. Like, when he had this string,\nhe had to go far enough so that nothing would happen to him. He had to - he - he\nactivated the mine, the bridge went up in flames or whatever it was, whatever, and he had\nto run away back to the forest. So, each - each of such escapade was very, very\ndangerous, but in his group, nobody - nobody died from that.",
        "Q: So, they taught him how to do all this?",
        "A: They taught him, and of course, he used his gun very efficiently later. I mean, after -\nbecause they carried guns all the time.",
        "Q: So, now he\u2019s waiting for another group.",
        "A: He\u2019s been waiting for another group, then the worst group comes in, and that was already\n\"44. Don\u2019t forget that the war in Poland - in Poland, in the woods there or in this district\nalready finished around January of 1945. So, that was shortly before - before the end of\nthe war. Because we were - for us, May was the end of the war, but for him, where he\nwas in Poland, the Russians were very close. So, January was already the end of the war.\nSo, anyway, when he came back to the woods, the worst of the groups, Anazed (ph), got\nhim. So, the - the name of - the name of the captain or whatever, whatever he was, I\nknow one of the leaders of this group was - his name was Orlig (ph), which means - how\ndo you call it now? The bird that has such a big beak, such a very aristocratic bird.",
        "Q: Tern?",
        "A: No, aristocratic. I forgot now. Anyway, it was a bird, like he said - Adrian told him the\ntruth because there was no use to tell him that - that he\u2019s Polish or whatever. So, the guy\nlooked at him and he figured like this - it\u2019s almost the end of the war, what they did now,\nthe Germans would go away because they were sometimes even they were more against\nRussians than the Germans. They were against Germans, too, but if they have to choose,\nthey would kill the Russians. So, he figured like in his mind was that if he keeps a Jew,\nhe\u2019 ll have a token no matter what happens. He had a son who befriended Adrian very\nmuch - was a friend. So, he told him, \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell the guys in the group that you are\nJewish.\u201d And, he went and he taught him to pray the Catholic prayer, and he made - he\nwas the one that started the prayer and then - but, Adrian was quite honest. So, he told his\nson, but the son never told on him. Adrian didn\u2019t realize that he wanted to - that he\nwanted to - the guy, the captain of the group wanted to save his life by holding a Jew, but\nhe didn\u2019t tell anybody else, but he figured when the Russians come, you prove to them\nthat he\u2019s a saint because he has a Jew there. So, anyway, soon after the war finished - and\nhe was working with them in the woods there - and soon the war finished, the Russians\nstarted appearing. And right away, this guy wanted to say that - that he saved a Jew, but\nAdrian didn\u2019t pay attention to it, but the Russian - the worst part was that the Russian,\nwhen he saw him, he said, \u201cTell me your story.\u201d So, Adrian tells him the story, and he\nsays he was in the People\u2019s Army. They were all Russians, mostly Russians and there\nwere two of them - he didn\u2019t say Jewish because he says that they escaped the camp, and\nthey were accepted there, and he says, \u201cThis is the last group.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything\nabout being Jewish or anything because he didn\u2019t know who the Russian 1s. So, the\nRussian says to him in Russian, he says, \u201cYou know, this is a very interesting story.\nThere was 27 of you - 27 of you -25 Russians and two Polacks,\u201d and he says, \u201cThat\u2019s\ninteresting that one Polack got out and all the Russians, you know, all the Russians\nperished.\u201d So, Adrian said, he says to his guy, \u201cKill him, like, shoot him - shoot him.\u201d So,\nhe says, \u201cWhat do you want? I\u2019m Jewish.\u201d So, the guy says in Jewish to him, \u201cWhy\ndidn\u2019t you tell me that before?\u201d So, anyway, he was saved, but now this guy from the\nAnazed that killed so many Jews on his ways, tried to - since Adrian was already there,\nlike the Russian and him were already such friends, and so, he tried to say that he was\nalso good to the Jews because he saved him, but he wasn\u2019t. So, Adrian says, \u201cI am the\nfirst Jew that he saved.\u201d Because he told him, when he accepted him, \u201cYou are the first\nJew that I met in my life that Ill save you - that I\u2019m going to save your life.\u201d So, he\nrepeated it. I mean, he just said it. I don\u2019t know what happened to them. I don\u2019t think that\nanything happened to them. Adrian was right away made, like, he was a lieutenant right\naway. They put all the stars on him, and then when he came home, he worked for the -\nlike, he was - he worked in the army as a lieutenant. Now, I\u2019ll go back to Salik Anulevicz\n(ph) and the others. When this - when they took the two of them - the two of them - the\ntwo guys Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were very much concerned what happened to the\nother guys, but they never found out. Only after the war, they found out what happened.\nSalik started his story. When they took them and went away, there was eight of them left.\nSo, Armia Kryowa, which was the home army, which wasn\u2019t killing the Jews, but they\nwere - they were doing everything possible to make their life miserable, went by and they\nsee eight people, and the people - they all told them what happened. They told them, \u201cWe\nrun away from this Jewish camp in...\u201d And not all of them spoke because the - Hassidic\nJews that spoke Yiddish at home, they had a very big accent. You could right away notice\nthat they were not - I mean, you couldn\u2019t tell them you are Polish. They all knew that\nthey were Jewish. So, they said, they, so, there was eight of them - they - they were anti-\nSemitic, but they said, \u201cWe are not going to kill you, but what we are going to do...\u201d\nThey told them to undress. They left them eight people naked, the way they are. They\ntook their clothes away. He says, \u201cNow, wait for the Russians to come, for the other army\n- for the People\u2019s Army. They\u2019Il take you.\u201d But, and they laughed and laughed that they\nleft them alive but completely naked and took away their clothes. So, they were there and\nthey started thinking, \u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201d I mean, they can\u2019t move. They\nhave nothing. They have no clothes. So, they sat and Salik Anulevicz (ph) was the only\none that spoke without an accent. So, they said, \u201cYou know what?\u201d There\u2019s a forest -\nthere was a farmhouse and the guy was looking after the forests, you know. So, he says,\n\u201cThere is this house. If you can go there and bring us clothes or food or something.\u201d So,\nhe says, \u201cWhy me? Why not you?\u201d He says, \u201cYou can speak Polish.\u201d So - so, he went.\nHe decided - I mean, he had no alternative. He went there, and on the way, a woman\ncame out of the house, and he told her the story. It was a young woman. It was the\ndaughter of the - this forestman. So, she took him home. She gave him something to wear\nand food and the father came in and the father says, \u201cI can\u2019t take eight people. I cannot.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, we can take food and clothes and whatever we can.\u201d But he says, \u201cThey will kill\nme, the Germans, if they know that I hide so many Jews.\u201d Anyway, apparently the girl\nfell in love with this Salik Anulevicz (ph) and she decided to save him, and she took him\nin and she was hiding him there, and he survived the war in her place. Now, I\u2019ll go back\nto the seven and I'll tell you what happened to Salik Anulevicz (ph). So, he and the\ndaughter - this daughter and her name was Hela (ph), because he always talked about her,\nSalik Analewicz, after the war. So, the girl\u2019s name was Hela (ph). He and Hela (ph) were\ngoing - went to give them food and give them clothes, but they under no circumstances\ncan they keep them there because there was eight of them. So, they were helping them\nwith - nobody knows what happened to them. Nobody - they didn\u2019t survive the war. How\ndid they perish in the woods because when one day they were there, they weren\u2019t there.\nLike, you know, they were taking daily food to them and water, but they weren\u2019t there.\nNobody knows whether they perished and they must have perished because nobody came\nback. Now, I'll go back to this Salik Anulevicz (ph). He lived there with this woman and\nshe promised - he promised that he would marry her. He promised he will marry her after\nthe war, but after the war he changed his mind, but he - he wanted to pay them back for\nwhat they did for him. So, he was a very rich guy - I forgot which city he lived, but he\nwas not far from the Czechoslovakian border there. They had some real estate and stuff\nlike that. He went to the lawyer and assigned all the real estate to her, and he says\nwhenever, as long as he lives, if he can help her in any way, he will help her. I don\u2019t\nknow whether he could do it, whether she cashed in on his promises, whether she could\nget - although he went to a lawyer and signed over all this properties to her, we don\u2019t\nknow because he never - no, he saw her once. Her father was - her father was accused of\nbeing, not a Nazi, but that he collaborated with the Germans, and they took him out, put\nhim to jail, and she new where Salik was in Poland at the time yet. So, she says, \u201cI want\nyou to be a witness to telling him that we - that we saved you.\u201d So, he went there and\nthey let the father go. Whether he was a German collaborator or not, I don\u2019t know.\nAnyway, Salik Anulevicz (ph) went to West Europe, and then he went to Brazil. He\nmarried a Swiss girl, and he was coming to Toronto every year because he had - he died\nfive years ago. He died before my husband because the two of them were friends like,\nyou know, and not only that, he had a brother Hirsa (ph). He was coming and he always\nwent, like he stayed with us with his wife and whenever we talked to them, he was\ntalking about this Hela. He wanted to go to Poland to see Hela, and the wife was willing\nto go with him, but she says, \u201cYou only know her first name, that Hela. She must have -\nsince then she must have been married. She must have moved out of this farmhouse. How\nare we going to find her?\u2019 He wanted to see Hela who saved his life. All his life, he was\ntalking about her. He died, as I said, about five years ago. We never heard of the eight -\nno, the seven other guys, and Freun (ph) was killed together with the - with like, by the\nGermans together with the whole group. So, this is Adrian\u2019s story.",
        "Q: Did he fall in love with Hela?",
        "A: Yes, but he was - you know, she was a very simple girl. She was a very simple girl. At\nthe time, he felt that he wanted a Jewish wife. You know, some people are - he was one\nJewish, he was religious. He was a nice guy. He wanted a Jewish wife. So, he decided\nthat maybe if he gives her the real estate that they had - houses and apartment houses or\nsomething - I don\u2019t whether she ever got it because the Polish government took over all\nthe properties, Jewish properties, so nobody gets anything anyway. So, maybe she didn\u2019t\nget it. He wanted to - and his ways, he was okay, but in his ways, he was also simple like\nhe didn\u2019t know how to go about it. He didn\u2019t know to go to Poland and to go the\nfarmhouse and start looking for Hela.",
        "Q: There\u2019s something so humorous about the meeting. He\u2019s coming out of the woods nude.",
        "A: And you know, may I say something on the tape? He said it in Jewish he said to him - I\nwill say it in Polish because my Jewish is not too good - he says, \u201cYou are lucky that you\nwere naked because when she saw you, she fell in love with you.\u201d But those were the\ncircumstances, and this is a real true story.",
        "Q: Unbelievable.",
        "A: Yeah, unbelievable.",
        "Q: So, she got to see everything long before most people.",
        "A: That\u2019s what he said. He said it in Jewish, \u201cYou were lucky that they undressed you\nbecause otherwise nobody would\u2019ve accepted you.\u201d But he was a very good looking man,\nand he was - he lived in Sao Paolo in Brazil.",
        "Q: But, you think he didn\u2019t know her last name?",
        "A: He said he didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: He never...",
        "A: Because, 1n a way, he was quite simple. Because I mean he asks his wife she should go\nand look for Hela, and she says, \u201cYou know what? I will go with you, but that he tells me\nwhere it was, he doesn\u2019t remember where the farmhouse was.\u201d You know, like, he was\nthere, but he was hidden. So, how did he know? You know? He don\u2019t know, and he\nwasn\u2019t smart enough to remember, because some people are fast, but Hela, how can you\nfind Hela in Poland?",
        "Q: So, let\u2019s go back.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You are now in the camp, after these boys leave, what is the effect? What did the Nazis\ndo? Or the Germans do?",
        "A: See that was shortly before - that was in 1943, but it must have been towards the end of\n1943, close to 44. Well, they didn\u2019t do anything. They didn\u2019t kill anybody when they ran\naway. They didn\u2019t because - maybe because Schrodt said that he killed them. He killed a\nperson - he young Wilczek (ph), as he said. Maybe he thought that he killed them all. I\ndon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember suffering any consequences because of that.",
        "Q: That seems surprising.",
        "A: Very surprising, yeah, but nothing happened.",
        "Q: And the people who didn\u2019t leave, who were part of the group who were thinking about\nresisting.",
        "A: Yeah, there was another - then later, it was another try of running after them. They were\nalready, how should I say, energized by their running away. And one night people went -\nthey started running - people started running to the barbed wires, cutting the barbed\nwires. And when I say a lot, I don\u2019t know how many, but I would say maybe a hundred\npeople got killed by the Germans, because they started shooting, the Ukrainians and the\nGermans, everybody, because they were much more ready to combat all those people\nafter the escape than before, because before it never happened, and - and those - I\u2019m sure\nthat Chris and Renia must have told you the story, how those people were moaning. They\nwere lying there. They didn\u2019t kill them, and they - they were crying and shouting and\nscreaming, all those people, because they tried to escape. We didn\u2019t try to escape because\nsomehow I didn\u2019t see - I mean, where would we go? There was nowhere for us to go. If\nwe could run away and be accepted by someone and live with someone or have some\nkind of a connection, but we didn\u2019t. And we were afraid that if one of us would run away,\nthe whole family would suffer, would be killed, and we didn\u2019t - we couldn\u2019t leave the\nfather there, and we couldn\u2019t leave Renta. I mean, where can you take Renia? I\u2019m telling\nyou, she was a sickly - always sick, always, every Tuesday and Thursday like this - it\u2019s a\nJewish expression - she had either a cold or she was sneezing. She was always sick. So,\nwe didn\u2019t but people did. That was after what happened to the ten, like after they run\naway, there was immediately the rest of them wanted to run away, too. Because they\nfigured if they could do it, but they run away under special circumstances, and those\npeople started at night. So, they were just shot like - there were so many dead people.",
        "Q: Actually, neither Chris nor Renia told me about this.",
        "A: Is that true?",
        "Q: Did they just spontaneously - this was a plan that hundreds of people were just...?",
        "A: Yeah, when I say hundreds, but about a hundred people, I would say, about that.",
        "Q: And they had no guns?",
        "A: No, nothing. They were just running to the barbed wires and tried to escape the way the\nothers because, you know, they saw what happened that the wires were cut and they run\naway, so they just blindly - they had nowhere to go. And all the guards were on alert, the\nGermans would come. I mean, Becker with his troops would come right away. I don\u2019t\nknow. That wasn\u2019t heroic; that was stupid.",
        "Q: I think we ought to stop the tape here to change.",
        "A: So, we are almost close to the end of Starachowice.\nEnd of Tape #8\nTape #9",
        "Q: When we ended the last tape, we were talking about this second break-out that you\nthought was really madness. So, all these people\u2019s bodies were just left there, and they\nwere left to die, moaning all night long. Was there, this time, a repercussion inside the\ncamp? This was still in Majowka. You were not in the third camp yet.",
        "A: No, we weren\u2019t in the third camp.",
        "Q: Did the Germans do anything to you who were left?",
        "A: No, nothing. Because they - there were so many bodies there that they had enough bodies\nalready, and it was close to - was close to us going to Auschwitz already, close.",
        "Q: Did you know people who tried to escape?",
        "A: Yeah, I know, because, I know a lot of people - young girls that ran, yeah.",
        "Q: And, did you know beforehand that they were going to try this?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you try to convince people not to do it?",
        "A: No, because I didn\u2019t believe anybody would do it. We all thought about running away all\nthe time. That was - that was our aim, to run away from this horrible camp, but you know\nwhen the time came to run away, we were too - too - too scared to because we were\nafraid. We couldn\u2019t take our father out. We couldn\u2019t take Renia out. And we are afraid\nthat they would be killed. So, we didn\u2019t even try.",
        "Q: You talked about roll call when they were going to do selections at times. Did you have\nroll call every day?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t in this camp?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So, how did...",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have roll call. They would call all the people - they had an announcement, and\nthey - and they, you know, the policemen then the Ukrainians said to come out and the\nJewish policemen would round us up - round us up and tell us that there\u2019s going to be a\nlecture, or whatever you call it, that we have to go and listen to it. That was the time\nwhen Adrian and his nine friends ran away.",
        "Q: So, how would you know - how would they count how many people there were?",
        "A: They were counting, but the policemen would, you know, don\u2019t forget when they started\ncounting, they knew how much we have to have, and the Germans were very gullible.\nLike, I told them, let\u2019s say that to talk, as an example, was 1,479, as an example. So, I\nwould tell the policeman that we have 1,479 people. So, they would come and report how\nmany people - people were taken from each barrack when he was rounding them up.\nThey were writing down - he\u2019s there. So, they - they made a count that should agree with\n1,479, and I remember Altov (ph) saying \u201cShtumpt!\u201d Because he didn\u2019t know that we\nfabricated those numbers because all the numbers he started counting together, not saying\nthe amount that I just told you was a fictitious amount.",
        "Q: So, you would make up a number\u2019?",
        "A: I knew the number because they would come - a policeman would come to me and say,\n\u201cHow much do we need?\u201d Like this, I\u2019d say, \u201c1,479.\u201d I\u2019m just inventing the number.\nOkay, so everyone knew. So, the first one, let\u2019s say came first and then the last one said,\n\u201cHow much do I need?\u201d You know, I mean, to give the number, and then they counted it\ntogether, and then Altov (ph) would come and start counting, \u201cBarrack 3 has so many.\nShtumpt (ph)! but meanwhile there were who knows how many missing? But, we had to\ndo it. I mean, we had to do it, and if they find out, I mean they didn\u2019t find us out, but if\nthey did. So, we would have had to suffer the consequences, but I mean, that was the only\nthing that we could do. and Irinst (ph), that\u2019s Adrian\u2019s sister\u2019s husband, got killed\nbecause they found one person in the barrack.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I was going to ask. This could be very dangerous if you...",
        "A: Very dangerous - they killed him on the spot, because we counted and the count was\nright, but there was somebody was - wasn\u2019t supposed - didn\u2019t come out. So, they killed\nhim on the spot.",
        "Q: Would that affect food distribution because, if saying there were X number, but there\nwere more...?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so because when they delivered to the kitchen - I wasn\u2019t in charge of it, so I\nreally don\u2019t know. I remember that Sal Kabiren\u2019s (ph) wife was in charge of it. So, she -\nshe - but, the Judenrat most likely was ordering or whatever. I know - I really don\u2019t know\nhow it worked, whether they ordered it, whether they sent at random so much of this and\nso much of this. I couldn\u2019t tell you.",
        "Q: During the break, you described nightmares that you had after the war.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did you have nightmares or dreams that weren\u2019t nightmares during the war?",
        "A: No, always - during the war?",
        "Q: Yes, during your experience in the camps here.",
        "A: Yes, after the war or before?",
        "Q: No, during.",
        "A: During the war. I don\u2019t know. I must have had nightmares, but I don\u2019t recall of any\nincidents of any importance.",
        "Q: Did you sleep well, do you think?",
        "A: Nobody slept well, really, because you were always thinking what happens, I mean,\nthings like that happened and we never knew what\u2019s going to happen the next day\nbecause there was always something happening in camp. I only told you a few stories that\naffected me personally, but such stories were - were happening all the time that affect\nother people. Everyday something happened.",
        "Q: So, do you recall when you went to bed in the barrack that you would close your eyes and\nbegin to see the things that happened during the day?",
        "A: Always, always.",
        "Q: So, it would be difficult to fall asleep.",
        "A: One day, I refused to come to work because, you know, Vaschek (ph) was insulting\neveryone. I\u2019m not saying that he was insulting me. Calling names - all the dirtiest of\nnames he would call, and I wasn\u2019t used to it. He wasn\u2019t bad to me. Like, I cannot say that\nhe did any harm to me, but I just didn\u2019t want to suffer all those insults. So, one day I\ndecided not to come. So, he sent a Jewish policeman with a pail of water to throw on me!\n[Laughs] So, I had to come to work, and that was his way of, but he still called me all\nkinds of dirty names. You know, he called me whatever he wanted to - not only me,\neverybody, all the girls, the other men, the policemen, everybody. That was his way, but\nlater on not only that I was glad that I worked for him not Altov (ph) or any of the other\nguys, because I would be dead by now.",
        "Q: So, that day somebody threw water at you, did you come to work wet?",
        "A: Right away, wet. I was scared. I said to myself, \u201cThe next thing would be that he would\nkill me.\u201d But, he was very - he knew that I was a very good worker, very consciencious.\nHe can find everything and always, and I kept his records to such a point that he knew\nright away, like, he was happy with my work. So, I knew that he\u2019s not going to kill me\nand take somebody else.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea whether any of these records still exist?",
        "A: I have no idea because when they threw us out, we went to another camp. Who knows?",
        "Q: So, Christopher Browning, when he interviewed you, did he say that he had found\nanything?",
        "A: No, I really - I don\u2019t know whether he would find.",
        "Q: Did you, by the way, have to make copies? Did you have carbons or only one copy?",
        "A: No, only one copy. I was doing the lists every day. I mean, he didn\u2019t need to have those\nlists, but every day - and then he put - he put, let\u2019s say - I don\u2019t know how long it kept the\nrecords - but he kept, you know, he had - he had them under lock and key so, I don\u2019t\nknow whether he kept them for a month, for two months. I don\u2019t know. Because he didn\u2019t\nneed like from last month\u2019s work, he didn\u2019t need the lists. I mean, really, he didn\u2019t - why\nshould - what would he use it for except for records. But, I really don\u2019t know what he did\nwith it.",
        "Q: So, one doesn\u2019t know whether they were sent to Berlin...",
        "A: I have no idea, no idea. We had no numbers. We had real names in this camp.",
        "Q: So, there were no - you weren\u2019t wearing insignias or anything?",
        "A: No, nothing yet.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have uniforms.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You wore your own clothes.",
        "A: No, the clothes that they were supplying. We didn\u2019t - don\u2019t - we didn\u2019t have not a\nbeautiful clothes. A shirt and some - a T-shirt or - the beds that we got was better than in\nAuschwitz where we got the uniforms and I couldn\u2019t find a uniform that would fit me. I\nhad to change with other girls that the uniform was still here, because then they just threw\nit at you. Here, at least, like when the things came, I had the first choice. I could\u2019 ve\npicked a better one. I, you know, than...",
        "Q: Did you have underwear and a bra?",
        "A: I must have, but where did I take it?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering.",
        "A: Because we didn\u2019t have an underwear - underwear or bra in Auschwitz, but we must have\nhad underwear and bra in camp, but we didn\u2019t buy it. [Laughs.] I don\u2019t remember, but I\nmust have. We must have had it.",
        "Q: Why do you think you must have had it?",
        "A: I think so. I might not as well had it - have had it. Really, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Do you remember having boots for the winter or what sort of shoes did you have?",
        "A: We wore our own shoes that we came in with. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Do you remember what you were wearing in the brick factory, right before you went in?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have the knapsack.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t take the knapsack. We didn\u2019t bring it and apparently, I don\u2019t know, I asked Renia\nand she doesn\u2019t remember, but some people told me that they saw my mother carrying\nthree knapsacks, and they think that this was the reason why they put her - her to the bad\nside. Although, because my mother had a card, as working in the Arbeitsamt, everybody\nhad a card, a working card. We really worked. My mother didn\u2019t work, or maybe she did,\nwho knows\u2019? But, she must have had a card, because, like, we were giving out the cards.\nBut I asked Renia. She says, \u201cOh, no.\u201d She says, \u201cMother didn\u2019t carry the three\nknapsacks.\u201d But somebody, I forgot who, some friend told me that they saw my mother\ncarrying all the knapsacks. That\u2019s why they pushed her to the bad side.",
        "Q: Why did - it was surprising to me that you said Pohl would come into the Arbeitsamt and\ntell you that the...",
        "A: Not tell me, tell the Nemcheck (ph).",
        "Q: Oh, so you heard that?",
        "A: I heard it. He didn\u2019t tell me personally. I mean, I didn\u2019t know him that well. I saw him a\nfew times in the Arbeitsamt, but he told that on such and such a date - it\u2019s going to be -\nthey are going to close the Arbeitsamt and on such and such a date, we\u2019ll all go to camp.\nWe - we were expecting going to camp because things like that were happening all\naround us.",
        "Q: So, did all the Jews realize, and so everybody was preparing?",
        "A: Everybody wanted to have a work card, and everybody was preparing to go to camp,\nwhether they know - knew where the camp was, because as far as I\u2019m concerned, I had\nno idea where the camp was, whether it was Majowka, Strzelnica, or Tartak (ph). I had\nno idea where those camps were until I came there. I didn\u2019t have any idea what they\nlooked like. I have never worked in the factory, the munition factory. I didn\u2019t know what\nconditions there were there. So... But we had so many things happening all around us,\nthat - that we knew that they would liquidate the ghetto, but we didn\u2019t realize how they\nwould liquidate. We didn\u2019t think that they would be so beastialic like that, you know, that\nthey would be pushing, and - I wasn\u2019t there, so I didn\u2019t see it, but from what people tell\nme, it was horrible in this marketplace. So, we thought that they would all take us to work\nnow, and we\u2019ll go to camps. We didn\u2019t even imagine what the camps looked like inside.\nWe had no idea. We were never in a camp before.",
        "Q: But you saw the people walking to the marketplace, am I right?",
        "A: No. I saw the people going already to the trains. Because the factory where we were was\nacross the road, a little to the left of - not much, I would say like how to describe it,\nprobably five hundred yards to the side. Like, let\u2019s say on this - let\u2019s say where I - where\nI\u2019m sitting is the factory. So, it wasn\u2019t right across the road. It was about five, six hundred\nyards to the side, on your side. So, we saw people walking from the marketplace, and the\nmarketplace was also to the left of where we were. So, we didn\u2019t see the marketplace. We\nsaw only people already boarding the train.",
        "Q: Where you standing with Chris?",
        "A: Yes, with Chris.",
        "Q: And did you talk to each other about this?",
        "A: We talked - yeah, because we said, we didn\u2019t expect it to be that day. We didn\u2019t have the\nknapsacks. We didn\u2019t have anything. We went just the way we went to work. We had\nnothing with us.",
        "Q: Did a lot of people see what was going on or just the two of you?",
        "A: Everybody that worked there saw it because we - we only had to go a little bit upstairs.\nWe didn\u2019t have that much supervision there because the ones that supervised us weren\u2019t -\nit wasn\u2019t a factory where like - 1t wasn\u2019t where there were people, inmates working there.\nThere were regular people working there. So, some of them were Jewish and some of\nthem were not Jewish. So, it wasn\u2019t such a supervision that the Ukrainians or policemen\nwas watching us, what we are doing every minute. We worked and we went to see, and\none of us would go and tell everybody else, and a few minutes later, somebody, and then\nthe two of would go and whatever and watch, and then we worked again. So, it wasn\u2019t\nthat forced labor. And if it was, we didn\u2019t have such - that was a night shift. During the\nnight, maybe they didn\u2019t have so much supervision, or maybe they felt sorry for us,\nwhatever, but I don\u2019t remember - the work was very messy, and dirty, and hard because,\nyou know, the bricks were heavy, and we had to carry them when they were finished, to\ncarry them elsewhere to dry them and then put - put them in place and so on. So, the\nwork was heavy, but it wasn\u2019t forced labor, like I said. Like, we didn\u2019t have any soldiers,\nGermans, Ukrainians, or we didn\u2019t. So, we could move around. I mean, not that we - we\nhad to work.",
        "Q: So, now back in the camp, Majowka. You wanted to tell us the story of a Frenchman?",
        "A: Yeah, the Frenchman was - that was in the last camp.",
        "Q: So, describe...",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: ...before you do that, describe the move to the last. What\u2019s going on?",
        "A: They built a new camp for us and that was for the purpose just to keep us there until the\ntrain comes to takes us to Auschwitz. We didn\u2019t know; we were moved there. I don\u2019t\nremember whether people were going to work from there, because it was a short time,\nmaybe two weeks, maybe three weeks. I really don\u2019t remember the times so exactly. But,\nonce we moved into this camp, there were no Ukrainian guards. There were no - the\nGermans didn\u2019t come, but - like we called them the canaries. They were...",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: The canaries. I\u2019ll tell you why. That was a German army. It was an army - I knew the\nname, now I forgot - it was Polizei, just let me think. Those were the ones that were\nguarding the soldiers that they shouldn\u2019t run away. Not, Sicherheit Polizei. | knew the\nname. I forgot. Anyway, it will come back. They were wearing light - they were wearing\nlight green uniforms and yellow insignia all over. The insignia was yellow. We called\nthem canaries because, like, we didn\u2019t know who they were. They were all around the\ncamp. There was - Altov (ph) didn\u2019t come, any more of our - those people that looked -\nthat were in Lager before. They were staying outside the new camp. Every, I would say,\nit would be six feet or so. Let\u2019s say every six weeks a canary would stay. You know, one\nof those soliders, but what\u2019s their name? I just - I was thinking and I knew it for one\nminute only - Feld Polizei. Those were the - they were guarding the soldiers they\nshouldn\u2019t run away, but, you know, during the battle. I just said it and I forget it. I just\ntold you and I forgot again, yeah, Feld Polizei. And we knew that something horrible 1s\ngoing to happen because we didn\u2019t see any of the guys that were normally coming to\ncamp, whether they were - no Ukrainians, no Germans, only this Feld Polizei all around\nthe camp. They were the ones who put us later on wagons. Anyway, when we were there,\nwe still kept the office, but I don\u2019t remember any German being with me because\nVaschek (ph) didn\u2019t work there for a while. They sent him to Ostrowiec, or maybe they\nsent - like they just let him go. I don\u2019t know. He wasn\u2019t needed. So, there was nobody\nthere but the typewriter was still there and I was still there, Jewish policemen were there.\nI don\u2019t remember any Germans except of those canaries outside.",
        "Q: This is in Tarbut (ph), or you are going back and forth, or this is the end?",
        "A: This is the end. This is the camp that was the end camp. Anyway, one of the soldiers\ncame up and he asked me in German whether I could - I could type a date on the\nenvelope, he\u2019s sending a letter. But he had such a French accent and I don\u2019t know why I\nsaid this, so I said, \u201cMoi, je parle francais un peu. Donc, si vous voulez, vous pouvez\nparler francais.\u201d So, he looked at me as if I came from another world. He said, \u201cHow do\nyou know French?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know French. I learned a little bit at school. That\u2019s all\nI know.\u201d He says, \u201cHow do you know I\u2019m French?\u201d I said, \u201cBecause you have a French\naccent.\u201d Anyway, I - I put the address on his envelope. He took it and he says, \u201cThank\nyou very much,\u201d and he went, and I didn\u2019t see him anymore. Then, came a time for us to\ngo to like - the train came over, and they were putting people, a hundred people - a\nminimum of a hundred people in each cattle wagon, a minimum of a hundred, because I\nknow that in some places there were 125 people instead of I don\u2019t know how many\nhorses they put in a wagon. The train was a small train, and it had two little windows with\nbars, and they were closing the doors by sliding one door, so I don\u2019t know how many\nhorses, maybe four or five horses. But we were in the last, like, there were mostly men\u2019s -\nmen\u2019s trains first and then they were ladies\u2019 friends - or trains, ladies\u2019 trains. So, we\nhappened to go, Renia and Chris and I, happened to go 1n the last train. They pushed us\nin. So, and the train moved and we knew and we heard crying because people were\nfighting with each other. They could only stand. In our wagon - in our train, we could sit\ndown. We couldn\u2019t lie down, but we could sit down and, you know, when the people are\nlike that, and they were hungry and thirsty and they were fighting with each other so we\nheard moans and stuff like that, and the train was very, very slow. So, when the train\nmoved and this Feld Polizei, they were sitting on the roofs, you know, they had - they\nwere sitting on the roofs of the train. They all went with us, as if we were the most\ndangerous criminals. They would because they - they were with guns. Anyway, as we\nwere going, it was time for us to get some water because at a certain station, they stopped\nthe train to get pails of water and to just put the pails of water for the people to have\nwater, like Renia and Chris - not Renia and Krysia, but people - and I tell, the people\nsays, \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any water.\u201d But anyway, this one guy, this guy, this French guy\ncame in and says, \u201cThe girl that speaks French.\u201d I didn\u2019t even get up. I forgot that I speak\nFrench, because I only spoke with him once. So, he says, \u201cThe girl that speaks French.\u201d\nSo, I came to this little window and he says, \u201cTake a couple of other girls because we are\ngoing for water. To bring water for them.\u201d So, he had some pails. So, I called - I thought\nthat I took Krysia and Renia, but Krysia went with me, but Renia says she doesn\u2019t\nremember. So, I maybe I took - like, I asked another girl, but Krysia definitely was with\nme. So, we went for to bring the water. Everyone was getting either one pail or two, I\ndon\u2019t remember. Anyway, when we came to the well where the water was to be, you\nknow, like we pumped the water, he says in French to me, \u201cI am going to let you\nrunaway now. You just run when you want. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m going to shoot later. First, I\nwill pretend that I didn\u2019t notice.\u201d He said it in French. \u201cI pretend that I didn\u2019t notice. I\ndon\u2019t want you here, run!\u201d So, I looked at him, and I thought to myself, \u201cHe\u2019s crazy. He\u2019s\ngoing to - we will run and he will kill us.\u201d So, I said to Chris in Polish, \u201cHe wants us to\nrun, but I\u2019m not going to run. I don\u2019t trust him.\u201d And he said again, \u201cRun, and I\u2019m going\nto shoot. Don\u2019t worry, just run.\u201d Where are we going to run? We are somewhere all\nstrange. We didn\u2019t know where to go. So, I said to Krysia, \u201cI\u2019m not going. I\u2019m going\nback. My father is there,\u201d and I thought Renia was with us, but I asked her. So, maybe\nRenia was there, so we didn\u2019t want to go. And so we went back. He says, \u201cI warned you.\u201d\nAnd then he says, \u201cOkay, if you don\u2019t want to run away now,\u201d because I said to him, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t have where to run.\u201d So, he says, \u201cIf you don\u2019t , but don\u2019t write it down, just\nremember, what I\u2019m going to tell you know. Just remember. My name is Leo Bernard.\nMy address is Merignan Mine (ph). Don\u2019t write it down anywhere, but if you ever have a\nchance or any of you have a chance. If you remember to tell them to come, I\u2019 ll say - you\ncould stay whatever.\u201d Like, we would have an address where to run away.",
        "Q: Hold the story. We have to stop the tape.",
        "A: This story\u2019s almost finished.",
        "Q: Okay, go ahead.",
        "A: So, anyway we came back. We didn\u2019t trust him. We stayed there for a long time until we\ncame to Auschwitz. We didn\u2019t trust him. From time to time, he open the door and he\u2019d\nput a few parcels of some food that he - I don\u2019t know - for anybody, and this is the end of\nthe story. When we came to Auschwitz, he says, \u201cI warned you, because from here, there\nis..\u201d\u201d He came to me again and says, \u201cI warned you because there\u2019s no escape from\nanywhere from here.\u201d And, this is the end. So, when I came to Canada, which was, we\ncame to Canada in \u201948 - I was thinking about it. I said, \u201cI wonder whether he told us the\ntruth.\u201d So, 20 years later or so, I wrote a letter to this address. I was just wondering\nwhether such a person - whether he was lying, whether a person like that would exist, that\nwhether he really wanted to save our lives, whether he wanted to shoot us. I was never\nsure, so I thought I would write him a thank you letter for his good intentions. I wrote in\nEnglish, and the letter came back \u201cNo One Under this Name\u201d So, did he lie? Did he say\nthe truth? But, he really and truly told us to run.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019ll change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #9\nTape #10",
        "Q: I want to go back to Majowka for just a moment. I want to ask you whether, as far as you\nremember, were there more men in the camp or women?",
        "A: More men.",
        "Q: By a considerable amount?",
        "A: Considerable amount. I would say, let\u2019s take a thousand as a unit - I would say there was\n700 men and 300 women. I mean, roughly; I\u2019m just estimating. Because I go by the\namount of barracks. There were more men\u2019s barracks than girls\u2019.",
        "Q: Do you think that\u2019s significant in any way?",
        "A: Because when they were picking people to work, there was more jobs for men than\nwomen. There were very - like the munitions factory, I had , they had different\ndepartments, but they were doing, like, iron in the hot fire and the women couldn\u2019t do\nwork like that. So, they had departments like that where you had - you had to have the\nstrength for this kind of work. So, there was always more men than women.",
        "Q: How long do you remember the trip being to Auschwitz?",
        "A: I would say that at least we traveled two nights because I remember a day and then a\nnight, and I remember another day and another night. So, it\u2019s possible that we came on\nthe third day, we came to. I was talking to Renia about it. She thinks we went there faster,\nbut those trains didn\u2019t go fast. The train didn\u2019t go on a regular route. They trains were\ngoing on side roads and they were very slow, very slow, and they stopped from time to\ntime for crossing, for different things, and I remember two nights when they closed the\ndoors and then when they opened the door slightly for us to get a little bit of breeze, and\nas you know, on the way to Auschwitz, a lot of people perished. Some were trampled by\nother people. As a matter of fact, my husband\u2019s brother and father died in the - because\nthere was so many people, 125 people, and they had to go to the bathroom and they had\nto do, you know, those things were not provided. I don\u2019t remember anymore going for\nwater except for this once, and also a lot of people jumped the trains and they couldn\u2019t\nhave jumped the trains if the train was going fast. One of them, some of them, like I\nremember, but I forgot the name of that man but I knew him well, but a lot of people\njumped and they were killed. They were killed because the guards - the canaries - were\nshooting at them, you know, like the train was going slow. So, I would say that two\nnights and two and a half days.",
        "Q: Did you have a pail to go to the bathroom?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: So, did you just go?",
        "A: Just go.",
        "Q: This must have felt horrible.",
        "A: Horrible. The stench was unbelievable.",
        "Q: And were people crying and screaming?",
        "A: Crying and screaming and that\u2019s why they jumped, because it didn\u2019t matter to them. They\njumped the train because it was better to be shot then to go wherever, I mean, in such\nconditions. We didn\u2019t where we were going, because I believed that we were going to\nanother camp to work, like, to another labor camp to work, but that was me. I wanted to\nbelieve it. But other people, I don\u2019t know whether they knew we were going to\nAuschwitz, but some people preferred to die than to go there.",
        "Q: And, what did this, as you were - what did this do to you as you saw people trying to\nescape?",
        "A: We heard - we heard shots and we heard moans and we heard screams. We heard it all,\nall the time, and I mean, you know, it was - that was a very traumatic time. Different\npeople reacted differently. I remember - I remember Krysia. My hair was shiny and I\nused to wear it like this with a - with a...whatever. Krysia used to say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry\nfor you, because if you die with such nice hair.\u201d",
        "Q: So, you, it was macabre jokes that you...",
        "A: Macabre jokes. But it was, you know, like we didn\u2019t know what to expect, where we are\ngoing. Like, later on we found out that we are in Auschwitz, but I mean, we didn\u2019t even\nknow how horrible Auschwitz was, because you heard things but you really didn\u2019t\nbelieve it.",
        "Q: So, had you heard the word Auschwitz?",
        "A: We heard it, but we never believed that it could be worse than Starachowice camp. Like,\nthe camp, consider going - don\u2019t forget they killed us slowly. First there was the ghetto,\nthen was a smaller ghetto, then there was the camp. So, I mean, we couldn\u2019t believe that\nanything could be any worse than we already went through. Like, you never believed that\nthey\u2019re killing people in Auschwitz. You heard about it, but you didn\u2019t believe it.",
        "Q: Were you frightened for your father as you were riding in the train?",
        "A: I was. Because I - I knew that he wasn\u2019t the same strong man as he was before, but we\nwere also afraid of us. Like, I was afraid that Renia would never survive because - not\nbecause I was afraid that they would kill her or anything, but that she was not healthy\nenough to survive such hard times.",
        "Q: But, she had already survived a couple of years.",
        "A: She did, but she was still - she was always the most frightened, because I was very\ndaring. I wasn\u2019t afraid. I was daring, but - and Krysia, too - but, Renia was always afraid.\nShe was always shaking, always afraid.",
        "Q: But neither you, you or Chris were not in the same way.",
        "A: Not in the same way. I think that Chris was the most realistic person. She organized\nthings for us, whether it was food in Auschwitz or whatever, she was able to do those\nthings. I, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t afraid of the devil. Like, if they told me to go right at\nsomething, I wouldn\u2019t have gone. I wasn\u2019t afraid because - I don\u2019t know why, but I\nwasn\u2019t. But Renia was - she always was hiding in corners. She was always cold. She was\nalways sick. So, that was our worry, but we were very lucky that we kept together. We\nalways watched for one another, and I'l tell you that, at a certain time when we were\ngoing to Auschwitz, not - from Auschwitz to Ravensbriick, when we were walking the\ndeath march, if not my sisters - I lost my conscious. I didn\u2019t know where I was. I couldn\u2019t\nwalk, and I was the tallest. Both of my sisters, Renia and Chris almost carried on one\nside. It\u2019s not far anymore, let\u2019s - a few more steps, Hania, a few more steps. They saved\nmy life, the same way as, in other moments, I saved their life.",
        "Q: So, Renta is the scared one, the baby. Chris is the organized, practical one.",
        "A: Organized, most practical, she always found us food. She was very, very, very good at\nthat way. And she always shared not only with us, she shared it with others. And I was a\ndevil. I wasn\u2019t afraid of anything. I was just not afraid, and I\u2019Il tell you, since I was the\ntallest, there was always a risk that whenever there was a selection or they looked for\nsomebody to work for a job or whatever, they would always - always - even if I was in\nthe back. Like, Krysia says, \u201cDon\u2019t stay 1n the front, stay in the back. They\u2019Il take you to\ntake blood. They\u2019ll take you to do this.\u201d So, but no matter where I stood they - because I\nwas a tall sticking out - so, \u201cThis one.\u201d But, sometimes it was good and sometimes it\nwasn\u2019t so good.",
        "Q: Does that mean you took risks?",
        "A: I took risks.",
        "Q: Bad ones?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know if they were.",
        "Q: They obviously didn\u2019t turn out bad.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t turn out bad.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t turn out bad because I wasn\u2019t afraid somehow.",
        "Q: SO...",
        "A: You know I helped us to escape from this last, last...but this will be another story.",
        "Q: You arrive in Auschwitz, the doors are open. As I understand it, your father is in the car\neither behind your or in front of you?",
        "A: No, we were in the last car. I think that my father was in the car before us, or two before\nus, because I don\u2019t remember whether all the women were one after the other or they\npicked a car full of women, then men and then women. I don\u2019t know, because we were in\nthe last car, and I know that my father was fairly close by. So, Krysia thinks that he was\nin the car right after us. I was under the impression - because we talked about - I was\nunder the impression that they kept women separately so, they must have been in the\nthird car, but he was close.",
        "Q: What was it like when the doors were opened? Was it...?",
        "A: When the doors were opened to go out?",
        "Q: To go out.",
        "A: First of all, we had a very bad experience because the guards that took us before they\ntook us to change our dresses and everything, we went very close by a crematorium, or if\nthat wasn\u2019t a crematorium, we were told it was a crematorium. So, I remember having a\nbottle of whiskey that this Frenchman - I forgot to tell you that the Frenchman left in\nAuschwitz, he says, \u201cIf they take you to the crematorium...\u201d So, we had this bottle of\nwhiskey. I never drank in my life, but all the girls - I told the girls, so when they German\nsoldiers stopped us in front of the crematorium, or he called this crematorium, so we took\nthis bottle and every girl had a taste. Not a taste of it, but you know, like we were\nthinking that we\u2019re going to die now so let\u2019s just be merry. We never drank in our\nlifetimes, but the whole bottle went. Like, as far as 1t went from us, and then they took us\nto the place where they cut our hair, and after that he stayed with us there for a few\nminutes to scare us or to whatever - to whatever, and then they took us to the place where\nwe had to leave everything we had, to put on the uniform or whatever you call it, a dress\nwith stripes, and they cut our hair. This is another story how I suffered the most out of all\nof three of us. And, then we went to the barrack. So, Pll tell you maybe how they first\nbrought us in and told us to take all our clothes off and they put nothing else, we had no\nbrassiere, this I remember - because I was so - it felt so strange to just have the dress on -\nand they gave us the dress. The dress was too short on me, so there was a small girl that I\ndon\u2019t know who, we changed dresses to fit us. Because we were all very skinny, but\nnobody was as tall as I. They were mostly smaller people. So, there were just a few long\ndresses. I was glad that somebody exchanged with me the dress. Then, they cut our hair\nto here. They checked our hair for lice. They put this stuff in, disinfectant or whatever\nyou call it, in our hair and on our bodies before they gave us the dresses, and I remember,\nthey took away my shoes. So, they gave us such wooden shoes - wooden shoes - and this\nwas a case where the wooden shoes - we were already in dresses and men from another\ncamp were distributing the shoes, and the guy says, \u201cTake it, take it.\u201d To me like, in\nPolish we have - like in English you say \u201cyou\u201d it means everything, but do you\nunderstand French or German? So, they say \u201cvous\u201d or \u201ctu\u201d or in German they said - they\nsay, because here you say \u201cyou\u201d, in Polish also you never talk to a lady by calling her\n\u201cDou\u2019(ph), you caller her \u201cVu\u201d like, and the guy says, \u201cTake those, take those.\u201d Well I\njust said, \u201cHow dare you calling me \u2018dou\u2019?\u201d Okay, it was so stupid. And, then so anyway\nI put those dresses - I couldn\u2019t walk in them, and then they put us five people in a row to\nmarch to the barracks. So, we were five, and so - Krysia, Renia and I were three and there\nwas three others. They didn\u2019t want to part and we didn\u2019t want to part. So, this woman\ngoes, she says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the commotion? The couple there.\u201d You know, I just came to a\nnew camp. I didn\u2019t like the way guy says to me \u201cDou,\u201d and here she screams at me. I\nwasn\u2019t really used to it because you know nobody really mistreated me when I worked\nbefore, and she says, \u201cGo to the back.\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to the back.\u201d She says - I\nsay, \u201cThose are my two sisters.\u201d She didn\u2019t even want to hear. She took me by the hair,\ngrabbed me by the hair, to the German man there that was cutting the hair, and she says,\n\u201cMake a cross on her head.\u201d So, you know, she was mad that I talked back to her. So,\nfirst he made the cross, and then he felt sorry for me and he shaved my head, but I was\nthe only one with a really shaved head of hair. You know, like, I didn\u2019t have anything on\nmy head - just - I don\u2019t know whether I looked like a boy or whatever. Anyway, finally\nwe just didn\u2019t want to be parted and I didn\u2019t care what she says. She couldn\u2019t kill me, like\nI was daring. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going, they are my two sisters. I\u2019m going with them.\u201d So,\nshe got mad. She pushed us. Anyway, we\u2019re together. I didn\u2019t want to part from them,\nbecause if I went to the back or whatever, I mean, it wasn\u2019t the next row - we would have\nnever been together. When we came to the barrack...",
        "Q: Can we go back before you get to the barrack?",
        "A: Right. Right.",
        "Q: Is the sequence that you get your hair cut - you take off your clothes...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Then you get your hair cut?",
        "A: I think so.",
        "Q: And, then you get a tattoo, and then you get the clothes.",
        "A: Oh, but you know, when did I get it there? When did I get the tattoo? After we had the\nshower, after we had the shower, and we got the dress, we went there and we got the\ntattoo. Before we went to the barrack - so, I must have had already my hair - I must have\nhad my hair cut short already. I - I was already with shaven head. I was the only one.\nEverybody had had hair to here because, you know, when we went to - they wouldn\u2019t\nhave touched us. This is my logic now - they wouldn\u2019t have touched us before they\ndisinfected us. Don\u2019t forget when we were - when we went under the shower, we shed\nour clothes and we got whatever clothes to put on. We were already, like, we were\nalready clean. It was after the wash. They sprayed such a horrible thing on us. It smelled\nhorrible, and it was stinging us because it was against - I don\u2019t know against what - a\ndisinfectant. So, I\u2019m positive that they wouldn\u2019t have touched our hair if we didn\u2019t go\nthrough disinfection before. That\u2019s my logic now; I don\u2019t remember the sequence.",
        "Q: Do you remember that it was men who cut your hair?",
        "A: Yeah, I remember that a German cut my hair.",
        "Q: A German what?",
        "A: A German man - soldier.",
        "Q: A soldier.",
        "A: He must have been a barber. He must have - a German soldier shaved my head. I don\u2019t\nremember who cut my hair or - because that was a routine. Like, everybody was just\ngetting their hair cut, but this one was a punishment for being disobedient, for talking\nback to the kapo.",
        "Q: After you got your tattoo and the dress, do you remember getting the tattoo?",
        "A: I do.",
        "Q: Did it hurt?",
        "A: No, it was like - like with a needle, that\u2019s what it was. It didn\u2019t hurt, but as if you put a lot\nof needles all the time, and we have numbers.",
        "Q: Sequential.",
        "A: Yeah. I have 1736 or something and Krysia has the next number and Reina has the next\nnumber.",
        "Q: You had 14176, Krysia has 14177...",
        "A: Yeah and Renia has...",
        "Q: Has 14178.",
        "A: Yeah, I remember that we had numbers one after another.",
        "Q: When you got - you remember getting striped - all of you got striped?",
        "A: All of them.",
        "Q: Did you then get a patch to sew on?",
        "A: You know that I don\u2019t remember, but we had a patch there. No, we didn\u2019t have - we had\nyellow patches. The Polish people had - a triangle.",
        "Q: One triangle?",
        "A: One triangle.",
        "Q: With a bar above it?",
        "A: Was it a bar above it? I don\u2019t remember, but that was a triangle. So, that was in\nAuschwitz.",
        "Q: Did you wear it here? Did you wear it...",
        "A: No, I wore it on my sleeve because in the last camp, we had red ones because we had\nregistered as Poles, but this is - in this camp, we had yellow, yellow triangles. I remember\nhaving the lower part here and like this. It wasn\u2019t a white armband, this was in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Did you have to sew this on, the triangle? Do you remember?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. Most likely, but I didn\u2019t have a needle, but maybe it was a glue that\nthey glued it on. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember, but we wore yellow triangles.",
        "Q: Do you remember whether they knew your names? Was there a list of all of you who\nwent to Auschwitz?",
        "A: I think that, when they gave us the tattoo, they wrote down the name and the number, and\nfrom there on we were numbers. There were no names.",
        "Q: So, there was an identity card in the...",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t get a card, but when they registered us, because the Starachowice group\ncame separately, and the Starachowice groups came separately. All Starachowice groups\nhave this number, you know, like one after another, and I forgot what you asked me.",
        "Q: Well, I asked you - identity is the wrong word. It\u2019s a registration card.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have a card.",
        "Q: Right, but there was a registration that was...",
        "A: They just wrote our names. They wrote down our numbers, and from there on, we had no\nnames. Like, we called each other by the name, but if they called - if they called you for\nsome reason, they called you by the number.",
        "Q: Now, did people recognize you when you got your...",
        "A: Now III tell you the story. I, myself - okay, we came in. They gave us a barrack, three\nrows of bunks, bigger bunks than we had, but I would say six - five to six people slept.\nWe had to sleep like sardines. One this way, one this way, one this way, because - and\nthey were boards, just boards, because in camp in Starachowice, we had straw\nunderneath. Here, you know, like it was a straw sack with straw inside. So, it wasn\u2019t so\nbad. This was on the bare thing and we - there wasn\u2019t enough room to sleep one way. We\nhad to have the heads one way... But now I\u2019m going back, because when we arrived,\nthere was a little window similar enough to the windows without bars, but similar to the\nwindow in the train that I told you, a small just to let some light in. So, I, you know, I\u2019m\ntall, so I stood there and I see - I see there\u2019s a man there, and I looked at - I looked, it was\nmyself, but I didn\u2019t know. So, I say, \u201cMan!\u201d I looked out this way. I don\u2019t see any man,\nbut then I looked in the mirror, and there\u2019s a man there. So, I started moving my head. I\nrealized that\u2019s me. I didn\u2019t recognize myself. I would never believe. I was very skinny at\nthe time and very tall, and my head looked like a pin drop, like with the hair, you know,\nmy head was very small by comparison. Like, I couldn\u2019t recognize myself, and it was\nfunny because one day I was walking the streets and, you know, the men was coming -\nwere coming to do the toilets in the ladies\u2019 - the ladies didn\u2019t clean - it wasn\u2019t a toilet -\nhow do you call it when there are only holes?",
        "Q: The latrine.",
        "A: The latrines. The men were coming to clean the latrine and one of our guys, a boy from\nGermany - I remember his name, Lothar - he was picked to clean the toilets. So, he came\nin and he saw me. He was so happy. He comes, he says, \u201cTell Hania that your father is\nalive.\u201d I looked at him and I was so vain, I didn\u2019t tell him for a minute that I was Hania,\nbecause I didn\u2019t want anybody to know that I looked like that. He didn\u2019t - I don\u2019t know -\nI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t ask him, but I came home and I said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad he didn\u2019t\nrecognize me.\u201d Like, people are stupid. I mean, I\u2019m talking about myself. So, then we\nwent into the barrack. The barrack was run by four people. There was the Lager Alteste,\nwhich was responsible for the barrack. There were two thousand people going in one\nbarrack, you can imagine how many people. So, there was the Lager Alteste. She was a\nCzechoslovakian girl. Her name was Yolichka (ph). Then there was a Shreiberin who had\na job like I had. She kept records who went to work, and she was doing all the office\nwork. Her name was Felicia Berlant (ph). She\u2019s still alive. She saved our lives. She was\nthe Shreiberin. Then there were two Steuben Alteste. The barrack was divided in four and\neach Steuben Alteste which was responsible for this part - for like two parts of the barrack\non this side, and two parts of the barrack on that side. She kept, she kept, she made us\nclean the places where you slept. She made us responsible for, responsible for\ncleanliness, that\u2019s all, and order in the places. When we arrived, this Yolichka (ph) spoke\nCzech to us, but we understood. This Fela Berlant (ph), she got the job because she could\nscream the most and she had a language similar to Vaschek (ph). So, when we arrived\nand we didn\u2019t stay straight she says, \u201cYou...\u201d - I have to translate 1t because - \u201cQuiet, you\nwhores from Starachowice.\u201d She didn\u2019t call us any other - not that she was bad. She\nsaved our lives and many other people. She was a good woman, but otherwise she\nwouldn\u2019t have had the job if she didn\u2019t speak like that. She called us names of all sorts.\nAnd when we arrived, and we got the job, we were working outside the camp, outside the\ncamp, and we were cutting bulrushes in wetland. So, we stood always in cold water,\nwetland, cutting, and those - we had those knives that the Germans gave us at the place of\nwork already, that we had to cut, but it was so woody, like it was so hard. It was the\nhardest job I ever had. My hands were bleeding because the bulrushes when they grow\nfor such a long time, they become woody, and to cut it with a knife it\u2019s very hard. He had\n- he had german shepherds, like he took us to work. We cut it. We were cutting those\nbushes, two german shepherds - like, I don\u2019t know how many of the guards were there\nthat took us, but two huge german shepherds and as a matter of fact, the first day he\ntaught me a lesson. Of course, I was picked because I was tall again. So, he wanted to\nshow us that if - because we were outside the camp and the reason why they were cutting\nthose bushes because they wanted to clean up the barbed wire walls in order, if somebody\nwanted to run away and hide there or if there was a partisan attack or some attack, so they\ncould hide in those bulrushes. So, we had to cut them. So, he wanted to show us what\nwould happen to everybody - to anybody that intends to run away. So, he called his dog\nand he told him to - he told him to start biting my dress, and he must have told him in\nGerman, because he didn\u2019t touch me. He just tear my dress to pieces, and of course, I\nfroze because I am afraid of dogs, like especially touch, you know, the mean dogs that\nbark so, and the teeth were so bad, and he stopped at him at a certain time and started\nagain. So, the dog didn\u2019t bite me, but he bit, like, my dress was in shreds. I got another\ndress from Fela when I went back. But, that was a time when I was really scared, very\nscared, because I thought the dog was going to kill me. So, I just stood there, and so we\nworked there for three months. After three months...",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. Did you take your shoes off, the wooden shoes?",
        "A: Yeah, no, I - I didn\u2019t have any other shoes. I had to wear the wooden shoes.",
        "Q: So, you wore the wooden shoes in the marshes?",
        "A: In the marshes - no, in the marshes we took off the shoes.",
        "Q: So, you were barefoot?",
        "A: And, as a matter of fact, we even washed our dresses as much because we didn\u2019t get them\nso often, maybe every two weeks or so. We didn\u2019t go to showers every day, you know,\nthe showers - I'll tell you a story about, a separate story, but when I came home Fela gave\nme right away another dress. So, that was okay.",
        "Q: One second - how are we doing? Okay let\u2019s change the tape. You had showers there?",
        "A: Not showers, we went every week they took us to such a place where they were - once a\nweek we went...\nEnd of Tape #10\nTape #11",
        "Q: Okay. We were talking about the marshes and the dog, but you were also beginning to\ntalk about the fact that you had, not exactly showers, but you could wash.",
        "A: Yeah, we were going to - I don\u2019t - in Birkenau, in another section, where they had a place\nwhere most likely they were taking the inmates - I call them inmates - regularly, once a\nweek or once every ten days, whatever time, you know, and we were going to those\nthings to have showers. So, I don\u2019t know how often I did that, I don\u2019t remember, but I\nthink once a week or once every ten days. When we arrived there, we undressed, they\ntook our clothes, they put it through the same function, like they gave us - okay, what\nthey had to do to put this stuff to disinfect all the dresses. So, they gave us - they took\nanother bunch that they already disinfected from another group, and they gave it to us,\nand we had a new dress, but each time it was a new old dress. Each time, I had to fight to\nget the longest, but I was very lucky. The girls always cooperated with me because\notherwise they would have to have a dress like this. So, that was the procedure. So,\nwhenever we went there, German soldiers would come - like, we would be - I mean, this\nwasn\u2019t in the plan, but I think that was the character that they wanted to do it - they would\ncome to the room where we were, and they would take a hose with cold water, put it on\nthe highest tension, and they would just not only tease the girls, but they would come and\nthey would just try to spray you with this - with all the force in your private parts. If you\nscreamed or you danced, they did worse to you. So, we knew that we had to stand still.\nWe had to disregard it. We had to say nothing, just stand there and pretend that it doesn\u2019t\nhappen to you. So, that - so, we weren\u2019t looking forward to the showers so much because\nwe had to suffer, and nobody - I\u2019m sure that it wasn\u2019t like, it wasn\u2019t meant to be like that,\nbut they did it.",
        "Q: Do you remember which barrack you were in?",
        "A: Yeah, 20...20. My sister thinks it was 25, but I think it was 20.",
        "Q: Have you ever looked at a map of Auschwitz?",
        "A: I never went back. I couldn\u2019t do it. Like, my sister...",
        "Q: No, a map? Not going there.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t look. No, I didn\u2019t look. I\u2019m almost positive it\u2019s 20, because I trust my memory,\nbut my sister thinks it\u2019s 25. Krysia thinks it\u2019s 25.",
        "Q: Well, I'll see if I can find out where Fela Berlant (ph) and this other woman were.",
        "A: Because we - we differ on that, because I remember - because Miles went to - went to -\nwhen he got the barrack, he wanted our barrack, and I was under the impression that they\ngave him, our barrack. I\u2019m not sure, but he said that when they offered to give him a\nbarrack for the museum, and he said when he goes there, he\u2019s going to ask for it, because\nthey don\u2019t care which barrack. They had to dismantle it anyway to send it to - so, he says\nhe will try to get our barrack. Whether he did or not, I couldn\u2019t tell you.",
        "Q: Weren\u2019t you in quarantine for a month before you went to this barrack?",
        "A: You know, that I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: So, your recollection is going directly to this barrack?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, you don\u2019t recollect sitting around for a couple of weeks doing practically nothing.",
        "A: No. I remember that we had to - I don\u2019t know whether it was the next day, but 1t was soon\nafter we came, we got this job.",
        "Q: Do you recall when you discovered the real truth about Auschwitz?",
        "A: Right away.",
        "Q: Right away, and you believed it?",
        "A: I believed it. I believed it.",
        "Q: So, this 1s the first time the thought you had in your head about what was going on was\nreally destroyed?",
        "A: Yeah, because we - the crematorium, we felt it. The stench of the, like, 1t was very easy\nbecause we met other girls from different barracks, and the stench from the crematorium,\nyou know, the bones burning and the hair burning and the heat and the fire that was going\nout from there. So, we knew that people - I even knew - I remember, someone told me\nthat 3,000 people can go into one of those crematoriums after they are gassed, apparently,\nthat\u2019s what I was told. I was never inside, but I\u20191l repeat what I was told, that 3,000\npeople can be put at one time into the gas chamber, and apparently after they\u2019re gassed,\nthe floor opens and they go, and the fire starts burning. So, they don\u2019t handle it, they only\nhandle ashes. They don\u2019t handle the bodies. That\u2019s what I was told, and I asked - I\nremember, they told me 3,000 people at one time.",
        "Q: And this was just another prisoner in the camp that told you this.",
        "A: Yeah, another woman prisoner from - maybe Fela told us or maybe Yolichka (ph), or\nmaybe one of those that were a little bit longer, the girls that worked there. They could\nhave told us, but I remember asking and that was the answer I got, and I could smell it\nmyself all day, every day.",
        "Q: Could you see fire?",
        "A: Yes. I mean, from the chimneys. I didn\u2019t see fire as fire, but they had such long chimneys\nand some flames were coming out, and they were making the air impossible, like it was\nimpossible to breath.",
        "Q: And were ashes coming down on your clothes?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: So, how long was it - well, first of all, how was your treatment in this barrack? Was the...",
        "A: Pll tell you what. This Fela took care of us immediately. She liked - I think she liked\nKrysia the most. I don\u2019t care, but she was so good to us, whenever she had an extra piece\nof bread or something, if she had something, the three girls - she just - she just was, I\nmean, as bad as she was - maybe she wasn\u2019t bad. She had a huge, big mouth. She\nscreamed, because otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have had a job.",
        "Q: And, where was she from? Do you know?",
        "A: Yeah, she was from Helm (ph). I know, because I just saw her. I\u2019m - we are friends\nbecause she really saved our lives, really saved our lives, and I'll tell you right away how.\nSo, anyway, when we were there for three months working so hard, she tried to always\ngive me a better dress, or you know, if she had something that was special, she would\nalways give it to us and really treat us a little better then she treated everybody else. And\nthen, one time, there was a Polish uprising in Warsaw, not Jewish, Polish uprising, and\nthey caught all the people - Polish girls to - that they caught, that they thought that took\npart in this uprising, maybe men, too, but they came to Auschwitz, and they were Polish\npeople, so they didn\u2019t go to crematorium and they didn\u2019t go to a barrack where they send\nthem to hard labor, and what they did - whatever they brought with them, the suitcases\nand everything, every piece of clothes had to be recorded, and when they - and they had\nred triangles - and when they finished their sentence, because they were not convicted for\nlife or taken to camp like that, but when they finished the verdict for two months, half a\nyear, a year, they were getting the clothes washed and ironed, and they went home. So, at\nthat time, Jews never worked in this department, only Polish people, but because of the\nfact that Polish people were coming and they didn\u2019t want any problems, they needed 20\ngirls to go there, to write down the, you know, to sort out the clothes, to write down the\nclothes, to hang up the clothes, to wash the laundry and stuff like that. So, they decided to\ntake 20 Jewish girls from our - from - and of course the Shreiberin got the order - the first\ntwo of us, she picked me and Krysia right away, and she had the 20 girls because we\nbegged her to take - to give Renia. She\u2019s like, \u201cI can\u2019t. This is office work. She looks -\nshe\u2019s too young. They want - they will never take her.\u201d So, we begged her and begged\nher. So, she went to Yolichka (ph) who was the Lager Alteste - the barrack Alteste, and\nshe asked her. She said, \u201cWell, all I can do is to ask the German.\u201d You know, the German\nguy that\u2019s going to pick them up if he agrees, but she says, \u201cI can\u2019t take all of them,\nbecause they need 20 people.\u201d So, anyway we were so nervous, I remember, the German\ncame in. Fela was there standing, and Yolichka (ph) went to the German soldier who was\ntransporting us to the new job, and she said to him, \u201cThere\u2019s three sisters, the youngest is\nthe best, but she looks a little bit small, but she isn\u2019t that young. She only looks young\nand she\u2019s the best of them all. She can organize...\u201d I don\u2019t know what happened to the\nGerman. He said yes for Reina. She brought her in. She was the 21\u201c, that never happened\nbefore. I don\u2019t know whether it was pure luck or whether it was Fela who did that for us,\nor whether it was Yolichka (ph) that did it for us, or whether the German just felt sorry\nfor whatever reason. We were transported to a new life. First of all, when we came there,\nthis department wasn\u2019t for Jews. So, everyone - although we slept, I don\u2019t know, ten in\none room, but we had - we had cots for separate, like, it was also three \u201cfloors\u201d I call it,\nbut they were single. They were single, and they had sheets and everything, like no\nappels, can you imagine? No - I didn\u2019t tell you a story about appels before. No appels of\nany kind because there was only 20 of us, and some of the Polish girls, they left a few\nPolish girls to teach us how to do the work. Some of them, we found out after the war,\nthey were Jewish but they were on Polish papers - some of them. With one, Krysia is in\ncontact with one Polish girl she\u2019s in contact with lived - that worked there. That was the\nbest job we could get. The Polish girls were coming. They gave us the stuff. In their\npresence, we wrote down everything they had. We put it in a sack. The sack was hanging\nthere with their number. And, when they were going out, we had to wash and iron their\nstuff, but we - we weren\u2019t there long enough to wash and iron, but we were taught to do\nthat. So, it was the best job. There was 21 girls that had - I mean, we weren\u2019t there too\nlong because we went there maybe in November and in January we were transported\nsomewhere else, but I didn\u2019t believe it\u2019s Auschwitz. It was the best job and I said now\nthat we were so lucky, because can you imagine, there was so many of us, and we were\nlucky, the three of us, that we got this job in Auschwitz. I mean, it was the best possible\nbecause it wasn\u2019t meant for Jews. It just happened that they needed - they didn\u2019t want\nPolish girls doing it.",
        "Q: I gather this was a shock to you that there would be protective kommandos in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: In certain places, there would be no selections.",
        "A: No...",
        "Q: Because there was no selection in...",
        "A: Not with us. We had to stand appel every morning, four o\u2019clock, five o\u2019clock. It was dark\nwhen we out for appe/ in Auschwitz, in Birkenau. But in here, we didn\u2019t have to do it\nbecause, when they brought - like, we had to work at any time they brought the - when\nthey arrived. When they arrived, we had to take their stuff away. They went to sauna,\nbecause there were the saunas were. As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, I reminded\nmyself now, that from camp, people were coming and you know what we were doing for\nthem, like when they were coming for - to the saunas? We took, like for drinking water\nwe had such - it wasn\u2019t a pail, it was such a thing with a spout - so, we would steal from\nthe Polish - from the Polish bags or suitcases or whatever a pair of underwear, a brassiere,\nbecause, you know, whatever we could put. We went for water, nobody asked us\nanything. We didn\u2019t have any German people supervising us. It was an easy job. So, we\nwent there for water, and then whatever we had in the pitcher - it was a big pitcher what\nwe were getting drinking water from. So, we would go there and distribute it to the\nStarachowice girls, and whoever wanted anything. So, we would - whatever we could\nsteal from the Polish girls we gave it to them.",
        "Q: Hania, do you recall where the Effektenkammer was in relationship to where the last\nbarrack you were at was? North of that? It\u2019s in Birkenau?",
        "A: In Birkenau. It was called - I know in Polish what it was called.",
        "Q: Say it in Polish.",
        "A: Rozowy effekt. Pink effekt because they were where the Jews where when they took all\nthe clothes was it was called Kanada, and it was Red effekt, but they - we didn\u2019t work in\nthis department. This was for specifically, not for gentile, but Polish people, you know,\nthis one, from the - maybe it was another department there - but after the uprising in\nWarsaw by the Polish people, very many were arrested. So, that was - it was called\nRozowy effekt, which means Pink effekt, whatever it was. The other was called Red effekt,\nand it was called Kanada. I don\u2019t know why.",
        "Q: And it was near the saunas.",
        "A: The sauna was there because, I remember, at first I didn\u2019t remember where we were\ngoing, but I remembered that those people were coming. I remember \u2019s sister, she\nwanted a powder box. I said, \u201cWhere would I find a powder box?\u201d",
        "Q: A powder box?",
        "A: Well, she wanted such a box to put powder in, with powder. But, you know, it was\nstrange but I mean, when you are in camp and you think that they could get anything,\nmaybe just to look at it. But that was the best job we had, because we didn\u2019t have to stand\nappel. We had enough food because there was only 20 of us. The Polish girls that were\nthere were getting parcels from home, and I remember they had onions, and the parents\nwere sending them stuff, food that was called like very nutritious, because we didn\u2019t get\nany apples or pears or anything. So, when the parents would send, and the Polish girls\nwere allowed to get parcels from home, and this girl Ioasha (ph) who 1s still alive and\nKrysia with her in contact all the time, she found her when they went to Warsaw. When\nshe got a parcel, she always shared it with us. So, we weren\u2019t - in addition to the bread\nand the soup that we were getting, in this camp - we weren\u2019t there too long, in this\nbarrack - but we were there all I say from the end of November until January the 18\", a\ncouple of months, because we arrived in Auschwitz in July, and so we were there July,\nAugust, September, October, November - five months. I said three months - five months\nin Auschwitz where we did the bulrushes, and then the two and a half months in this\nplace or two months.",
        "Q: So, did this bring back strength to you?",
        "A: Yes, it did, because we didn\u2019t see any Germans, like, there was only the supervisor and\nthe supervisor was the Polish girl who was really Jewish, but there she was nobody. She\nhad a Polish name. She, as a matter of fact, she wrote a book about Auschwitz and she\ntold - in the book she says her name was Landau, but there was Jevulska (ph). She had a\nPolish name. She was from - because there was just a few Polish girls that were\nsupervisors because before that there were other girls, but as I said, after the Warsaw\nuprising, they wanted Jews there.",
        "Q: Does Renia get better, as far as you\u2019re concerned? Does she actually work?",
        "A: She worked. She worked very - she was so efficient, believe me. Renia did the same job\nas we did, because once she got there, she was treated - nobody bothered with her. She\nworked very well. As a matter of fact, she was a very good worker. She was one of the\nbest.",
        "Q: So, did she - did you see her start getting stronger at that point?",
        "A: She was always a physical weakling. She was never very strong. Ever since she was a\nchild, she always was susceptible to different sicknesses.",
        "Q: So, how did you find out that the camp was going to be evacuated?",
        "A: We were told that, on the 18\" of J anuary, we are going west, because whatever it was, we\nknew that the Russians were very close. As a matter of fact, we were told that the\nRussians were 70 kilometers from Auschwitz, and they were sending the people west to\nBergen-Belsen and to all sorts of camps, but first we had to go through Ravensbrick. So,\nthat was the death march because the trains - 1t was, the weather was very bad. The trains\ndidn\u2019t go fast enough. It was very cold on the 18\" of March. On the 18\" of March, we\nleft Auschwitz.",
        "Q: No, the 18\" of January.",
        "A: Sorry, 18\" of January. I don\u2019t know why I said March. On the 18\" of January, I said, it\nwas snowing and blowing, on the 18\" of January we went to Ravensbriick. I\u2019m sorry. We\nwent to Ravensbruck, and the train was going slow, and part of it we were walking, and\nmy shoes were all frozen. I couldn\u2019t put them on. I had to put them in the car in the train.\nI put - to wear my shoes to just be able to slip them on because they, you know, when I\ntook them off to - for the night, I couldn\u2019t open them. And, then we...",
        "Q: What kind of shoes did you have when you left the Effektenkammer?",
        "A: Later, we got other shoes. I\u2019Il tell you, when we came to the - to the place where we\nworked with - the last place, we could pick up any shoes there and put my shoes.",
        "Q: The Effektenkammer, you were able to choose shoes.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s true.",
        "Q: But, let me ask you something, you had begun to describe that on the death march, you\nbegan to fall asleep, but Renia also describes that she thinks for the whole time, until you\ngot on the train, she was sleeping.",
        "A: That\u2019s possible, too, because I remember that if not my sisters - I couldn\u2019t walk. I was\ndragging my feet and I saw pictures that didn\u2019t exist. I saw horses and people, maybe I\nhad a bad - a bad vision there, but I couldn\u2019t have had, because I started so long I was\nworking, always was working like this. So, I saw things that didn\u2019t exist. And, if my\nsisters wouldn\u2019t have kept me, I don\u2019t think I would have survived. Maybe Renia had\n_____, or maybe I woke up a little and we carried Renia. That was the - then you saw so\nmany dead people because the Germans were pushing us to go west with their dogs, and\nwhoever couldn\u2019t go, they would just shooting, like they couldn\u2019t - and, you saw those\npeople. One person was sitting under a tree - was sitting there. He was dead, and you\nknow, what the worst part was that the people that were walking were taking the shoes\nand the - when they saw a dead person, quickly they would get the jacket or whatever\nthey could grab. Nobody worried about it - what shoes or whatever they could get quickly\nso the Germans wouldn\u2019t send the dogs after them, and they walked - we just disregarded\nall the - the dead people. But to me, the man that was sitting under the tree, he looked so\nreal and so alive and he was dead. Maybe, he just sat down to die. Then, we came to\nRavensbrick, I don\u2019t know, three days later, two days later. I don\u2019t know exactly what\ndate it was, and there was no room for us in the barracks, and it was freezing and it was\nsnowing, so we had to stay outside - sleep outside. So, we slept in the snow together, like\nwe just warmed each other from the bodies, you know, with our bodies, we just warmed\neach other, and slept in the snow. Then, in the morning, we didn\u2019t get anything to eat. So,\nwe took this dirty snow - most of the times, we took the snow from trees or something -\nand we drank it and ate it. For three days, we had no meat - because they didn\u2019t have any\nroom. From every side the people were sent to Ravensbriick. They didn\u2019t have - they\ndidn\u2019t even register us. They didn\u2019t even write our names. So, after three days, they send\nus to a camp called Retzow, which was...",
        "Q: Wait a second - isn\u2019t it the case that somebody asked for your names and you decided\nyou weren\u2019t - one of you decided that you were not going to say a Jewish name.",
        "A: No, that was...",
        "Q: You said \u201cGorska.\u201d Or is that only in Retzow.",
        "A: I think it was in Retzow. I'll tell you in a minute how it was, but I have to remind myself\nwhether it was in Ravens - no, it was - we were there three days, I don\u2019t remember. I\nthought that they didn\u2019t register us, only in Retzow. But I will tell you this story. Now, I\nget confused. I would have to ask them. When we stood in line to be registered, I think it\nwas in Retzow, but I could be wrong, maybe they did register us and that was in\nRavensbriick. We decided, like I told my sisters that if the Germans - the Russians were\n70 kilometers from Auschwitz, and sound away (ph) fire in Auschwitz, like before we\nwere moved, we were taken on the death march there to Ravensbriick, we saw fire. And\nsomebody told us that they are burning all the records. You know, and I believed it was\ntrue, because the Russians were so close, they didn\u2019t want to have the records. So, we\nsaid - I said to my sisters, \u201c\u201cWe can save our lives by pretending we are Polish.\u201d So, Chris\nhad a boyfriend; his name was Kleinburg. Kleinburg is a small mountain, you know,\nthat\u2019s what it means in German, like, if you translate it. So, she translated it into Polish:\nmala gorska. I said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s too long. Who 1s going to...? Let\u2019s eliminate the \u2018mala\u2019 and\nwe'll have the \u2018gorsky\u2019, \u2018gorska\u2019.\u201d So, we had to remember, what was the mother\u2019s\nname. So, my mother\u2019s name was Pola Blum - Tannenblum, but they were called Blum.\nSo, I said, in Polish, a blum 1s a flower, it\u2019s like fiatek, so Fiatekosky, because if it was\nfiatek, you couldn\u2019t say fiatek. What was your father\u2019s name? So, we said \u201cGorsky\u201d\nbecause our name was Gorsky, and the first name, his name was Isaac, so we said \u201cAnje\u201d\nbecause Anje was such a typical peasant Polish name. So, we gave this name to them.\nThen if they asked us any other questions, we have to remember that we are Polish; we\nare never Jewish. And of course, when we registered, we got the red, the red triangles.\nThat means political prisoners, so, you know. And immediately, when we arrived, I met\nsome people that I knew, and they didn\u2019t want to talk to me because they had the yellow -\nwe call it winkle (ph) - yellow triangle and we had the red one, and they didn\u2019t want to\ncause any problems for us that are Jewish and we are Polish, so they didn\u2019t talk to us, but\nlater we told them not to worry about it. When we arrived in Retzow - this is very, not a\nvery interesting, but that\u2019s again a personal story.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s pause for a moment because I think we only have a little bit of time left.\nEnd of Tape #11\nTape #12",
        "Q: We\u2019re in Retzow. What\u2019s happening in Retzow?",
        "A: So, we arrived in Retzow, I think we registered there, and then we lined up for work. So,\nthe man in charge - I don\u2019t know his name, but I know his title. It\u2019s a mouthful:\nHaupstunshaufithrer (ph), and he had - there was a barrack, the German barrack where\nthey worked, and it was this Haupstunshauftihrer (ph) and then they were kapos, women,\nand then they were guards in the camp. What we did there was when we arrived there, he\nlined us up for work. He needed about, I would say, 12 people I think or so to clean the\nGerman barracks. Some people were going out to work. I don\u2019t know what they did\nbecause we were either too short and I wasn\u2019t working outside. So, first of all, the cook\ncame in and he picked Krysia. That was the biggest, you know, as if she won the lottery\nbecause - because if she is going to work in the kitchens, we would have what to eat\nbecause we just come from a place where we didn\u2019t eat for three days, and from\nAuschwitz where the food was so scarce that we were fainting most of the times. So,\nKrysia got the job in the kitchen. Then, they started picking people to clean the barracks.\nThe Germans - those were the best jobs, don\u2019t misunderstand me, the best jobs. So,\nanyway, he picked me first, and he started picking people and Renia got also in this\ngroup. So, then he showed where we are going to live and so on, and then he showed - he\ntold us where we are going to work. So, he picked me to work in his office. So, I figured,\nwhat am I going to do here in the office. I - I thought I\u2019m going to be a secretary or\nsomething. So, he comes in and he tells me - he asks me, \u201cKannst du putzen?\u201d \u201cDo you\nknow how to clean?\u201d I think myself, \u201cOf course I know - that\u2019s the best job I could get to\nclean those barracks.\u201d So, I said, like, but then I see, there is his desk with all the papers\nand the radio is playing. I think if I\u2019m going to play smart, I won\u2019t get this job, because,\nyou know, I have to be dumb to know how to clean the floors. So, I decided that I\u2019m not\ngoing to tell him that I know German. I don\u2019t know why, but at that moment, my mind\nstarted working, and I figured to clean the floors, you don\u2019t need to be intelligent, just be\nas dumb as you can. So, he says, \u201cCan you...\u201d Pll speak English. \u201cCan you speak\nGerman?\u201d So, I said [so-so gesture with hand]. And he said to me, \u201cAnd how about -\nwhat do you speak?\u201d So, I said, \u201cPolish.\u201d Polish he couldn\u2019t speak. So, he says to me,\n\u2018So what can you do?\u201d So, I said, \u201cPutzen.\u201d I mean, he told me already that I\u2019m going to\nclean. So, that\u2019s what - I didn\u2019t know. I never did the - I never cleaned a floor in the\nhouse, in my house, never touched it. So, then he says to me, \u201cWhen you clean, I don\u2019t\nwant you to touch anything on my - on my desk because this 1s all private. I don\u2019t want -\nif you want to - from time to time, Ill clean it, and you will be able to clean. All I want is\nto clean around, to clean the floor, but don\u2019t touch it, and don\u2019t touch my radio.\u201d So...",
        "Q: Now, he\u2019s saying this to you in German.",
        "A: In German.",
        "Q: In simple German?",
        "A: I pretend that - the way he shows me around, I pretend that I only understand a little bit.\nSo, then he sees that I\u2019m - I always - since I walked 1n, I decided that Ill play dumb. So,\nthen he says, he looks at me, he tells me, he shows me how to do this, how to do this,\nokay. Then, he says not to touch those - I mean, he was showing me because he knew\nthat I could only speak a little - then he says, \u201cCan you read?\u201d So, I look at him. I pretend\nthat I don\u2019t understand and I says [shakes head]. \u201cAnd write?\u201d So, I says, again a listened.\nI pretend, so he shows me. I said [shakes head]. So, he said - I remember - Krysia will tell\neverybody my \u201cSo gross ker faxen so dum\u201d. Do you understand this? She\u2019s \u201cSo gross ker\nfaxen\u201d means \u201cShe grew so tall and she\u2019s so dumb.\u201d You know, like that\u2019s what he said. I\nwanted to laugh, but I really, believe me I was telling myself that I was the most clever\ngirl. I got the best job. I got the cleaning. So, I was reading all his - since I didn\u2019t know\nGerman well enough. So, he didn\u2019t clean the desk. He was leaving the papers. I read all\nthe papers because, if I was very careful, I could just pretend that I\u2019m cleaning the table\nand read the papers. I listened to the German broadcast, because the radio was on. I\ncouldn\u2019t understand, so he was - he got himself the best cleaner. We weren\u2019t there too\nlong, but during that time...",
        "Q: What did you hear and what did you read?",
        "A: That\u2019s what it is - I read all the orders. I knew that the war is being lost. I knew - I read\nall those - the letters that he gathered. That\u2019s how we ran away. Renia was cleaning\nanother room. I would go back to Krysia - how she fed us. She was marvelous, but I\u2019ll go\nback to this portion. I\u2019Il just talk now about this situation here. So, I read everything and\nthen, the Russians were already so close that he got orders that on such and such a date to\nlet everybody go except the guards, because they weren\u2019t sending the Jews anymore to\nwork, because they had to go out of the camp. So, that - we had the - like, we were Poles,\nbut we took off our triangles because then the people that work outside had white crosses\nacross the back with the paint. Like, whatever - if you worked outside, you had the white\ncross painted like this right across the back. So, Krysia and I, we came to a conclusion\nthat she works in the kitchen, she gets some flour and water, and she\u2019|l be able to make\nthe crosses, new crosses, on our clothes, because we - we had clothes there. We were also\ndistributed some clothes for us because it was a small camp. It wasn\u2019t a big camp. We\nwere all girls. And this, we decided that we are going to run away, but we had to have a\nstrategy. We had a Jewish girl from Lublin. She was blonde and had blue eyes, and she\nspoke perfect German. She was one of us working in the barracks because there were\neither ten or twelve of us working the barracks. I don\u2019t remember. Since she could speak\nso well German, we decided that she\u2019s going to steal the kapo\u2019s - you know, kapos were\nwearing a black cape, a black cape what covered whatever - they didn\u2019t wear uniforms,\njust a black cape with a hood. So, she stole this hood from her, and then Krysia - we\ndecided that what we can do to take the crosses off, all we had to do is this, is to just\ncrumbled the - like we had to wear the crosses inside, but in order to get outside, to run\naway from camp - I knew exactly because my boss didn\u2019t come to work that day. I don\u2019t\nknow whether he came later or so, because it was ten days before the end of the war - ten\nor twelve days before the end of the war. So, in the morning, we got up this Helena was\nher name - she put on the cape, we made sure that there was no sign of the cross, and she\n- we came to the gate. She told the post that she registers with him ten people going to\nwork outside, whatever - she knew what to say, where outside, and he says - he showed\nus to go. We went to the road, and all - from there on, we didn\u2019t have to worry because\nall the Germans were running towards west. They were afraid. The Russians were very\nclose, so the Germans were leaving their homes and everything marching, running away\nfrom the Russians. They were afraid. So, we were in the group. Nobody noticed us.\nNobody bothered us, but we didn\u2019t have what to eat and we didn\u2019t know what to do. But,\nwe tun away. We\u2019re out of the camp. As a matter of fact, one girl from Radom that I\nsuggested that she goes with us, she didn\u2019t want to go because she had - somebody gave\nher spreads - some sardines, a box of sardines. She had it with someone. She didn\u2019t want\nto leave it, or she didn\u2019t - she didn\u2019t want to give it to her, and she didn\u2019t want - because\nshe wanted to eat it, she didn\u2019t want to run away. So, they went to another camp from\nthere, you know, after - the Russians were - they must have gotten orders to go more\nwest, but we were already free. So, we - that was it. Those were the camps. Now, Krysia -\nshe worked in the kitchen so, she stuck, you know, she cooked and she - she was sending\nto us - she was working on the second floor and so, we - we used to go under - stand\nunder the kitchen and have our metal thing with the handle. She would push down a\nstring. We would put the string on the handle. She roped it, and she would take - because\nthere was meat, like horse meat, but we didn\u2019t get it; the Germans - the Germans got it.\nWe only got the soup. So, she would take a tongue or whatever, you know, she had there\na big piece - a big piece of meat she would send it back. We would take it and divide\namong all the girls. So, everybody had something, not only something to eat, but we were\nnot used to such - so rich food. It was tremendous. One day she tells me this story. She\nworked there. She stole a pound of butter. It was, you know, one of those pounds in foil,\nand she says she didn\u2019t know what to do with it because, I mean, the Germans was - her\nboss, the German cook, was watching her. So, she put it in her pants so that she could\ntake the butter to take to us, and when she started working and cleaning up, the butter\nstarted dripping, and she got so scared she almost died. She - but anyway, she managed\nsomehow to bring the butter - the butter to feed us. So, we really in Retzow we didn\u2019t\nhave a bad day, because she was supplying all the food. She was stealing it, but she was\nsupplying all the food and nobody - all the girls that knew, they noticed that I went out to\nget whatever, they were already waiting. I mean everybody was hungry. So, that was also\nlucky. We were lucky there. But, this is all about Retzow. There\u2019s very - we don\u2019t have\nmuch to say about it because we weren\u2019t there too long.",
        "Q: Did you feel liberated when you left?",
        "A: Right away. Right away. We walked with the Germans. We went that way, but we\ndecided to...",
        "Q: One second. I was asking you did you feel liberated when you left?",
        "A: We did. We did, but we were far away from home. We didn\u2019t know where we were\ngoing. We decided to - we decided to stop going west because we were going - by going\nwest we\u2019re getting too far away from home, and we - and we - we heard already Russians\nspeaking. So, we decided to get off the road, and just managed to go back - to walk back,\nbut we were afraid because this way where we were going west, nobody could - nobody\nwas suspecting us of running away from camp. We\u2019re running away to the west where all\nthe Germans, you know, with all their possible treasures that they had. They had horse\nand wagons and stuff like that, and they were all going west running away from the\nRussians, but then at one point, we decided, all ten of us, we had one Russian girl, not\nJewish, with us, too. Most of the girls were Jewish. Helena was also Jewish, but she\ndidn\u2019t look it. She spoke perfect German. She could get away with being German just in\ncase if something would happen, and we got off the road and we started going through\nthis forest. We started going back home. Back home! We were far away from home, but\nback to the east.",
        "Q: Pll tell you what. I think that we\u2019ve spent a very, very long day today, and I think that we\nshould just plan at some point that we continue this. That is enough.",
        "A: That would be great. Thank you.",
        "Q: And I really thank you.",
        "A: I thank you very much. I really thank you for your consideration and for being so delicate\nwith me, because I was always afraid of this - not afraid for, I was always - I felt that my\nbody, I mean, I\u2019m not healthy enough to take - to think about Holocaust for so many, you\nknow, hours at times because \u2019til now I was not successful in not suffering afterwards,\nbut really it was so nice of you. I feel good, and I\u2019m glad I give you this interview.",

        "Q: So, even though you\u2019re still a kid, do you begin to hear things about what\u2019s happening in\nGermany, or is that not very conscious yet?",
        "Q: So, you had no idea what sort of an army they really had.",
        "Q: So, you had no fear?",
        "Q: None. But, you were conscious in some way about what was happening in Germany?",
        "Q: So, a couple of years later, in \u201937-\u201938, before the war begins and there are German Jews\nwhose ancestors came from Poland, who are sent back to Poland and come into the area\nof Starachowice, right?",
        "Q: So, do you see these people when you come back on vacation? Do you notice that there\nare these German Jews who have been sent away?",
        "Q: Tell me - I want to go back a little bit. Tell me about your grandma. You all seem to have\nhad an extremely close relationship.",
        "Q: Did she teach you about Jewish prayers?",
        "Q: You may not remember this or even know this. Was your mother in conflict with her\nmother because she wasn\u2019t as religious?",
        "Q: So, was it odd for you to learn this much about - did she expect that you would become\nreligious? Was that her hope?",
        "Q: No, your grandma.",
        "Q: She just wanted you to know?",
        "Q: So, your mother opened the Tarbut school?",
        "Q: And there were a lot of children who went?",
        "Q: Because, of course, the orthodox would not go.",
        "Q: I think we may be close to the end of the tape, but I\u2019m not exactly sure. Four minutes,\nokay. Did you graduate from high school before the war began?",
        "Q: How many years was high school?",
        "Q: So, as you\u2019re going to high school, so between \u201935 and September of \u00b039, right, do you\nfeel things getting difficult, or are you still believing, \u201cGermany\u2019s not going to do\nanything.\u201d",
        "Q: So, you don\u2019t live with any fear.",
        "Q: So, war must have come as a complete shock to you.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s stop the tape and change it please.",
        "Q: Hania, what happened when the war began? You were in Radom at school.",
        "Q: Was that a very frightening experience the evacuation?",
        "Q: Do you happen to remember the first night you came back after you had been evacuated\nand you had a very formal kind of dinner, that your father wanted there to be a tablecloth\non the table? Do you remember that?",
        "Q: So, what is your first memory after you come back from the bombardment? What is the\nclearest memory that you have of how life changes for you?",
        "Q: Do you remember whether your sisters were afraid? Do you remember talking with\nthem?",
        "Q: Let me ask you this: you move about three times.",
        "Q: Between the first evacuation, when you come back to your apartment, until the ghetto is\nclosed.",
        "Q: You remember all those moves?",
        "Q: Now, was that - what did you think when that was happening? Do you know how...?",
        "Q: It\u2019s every interesting. First of all, the Germans could not recognize who was Jewish and\nwho was not; only the Poles could.",
        "Q: Did this Polish guy tell you why he told the German guy?",
        "Q: Were you surprised that the German guy didn\u2019t ask for your identification, because all of\nyou had to carry identification?",
        "Q: Why? Why did you think that was the best way?",
        "Q: And you being so honest.",
        "Q: So, did you go to work at this place?",
        "Q: You never got there.",
        "Q: And, the armband that you wore was white?",
        "Q: What made...? You weren\u2019t afraid to take it off?",
        "Q: Did you speak German with him, this guy?",
        "Q: He was really embarrassed because he didn\u2019t figure it out.",
        "Q: When did you start dating?",
        "Q: Yeah, was that sort of a typical time for young girls?",
        "Q: And did you like going to the movies?",
        "Q: Any particular favorites?",
        "Q: These were American movies that you saw?",
        "Q: I think it sort of surprises people to think about people going to those movies.",
        "Q: In Polish?",
        "Q: So, Jeanette MacDonald singing.",
        "Q: Did they show you dramatic movies as well and mysteries or was it mainly the musicals\nthat came over?",
        "Q: Was this boys and girls?",
        "Q: Both, and where would you buy - how would they selling them?",
        "Q: Because when I was a kid, people used to buy them, and they were in candy or bubble\ngum or something.",
        "Q: I understand that, once there was no schooling for Jewish kids, that you became a teacher\nin your house.",
        "Q: Right, that\u2019s what I mean.",
        "Q: That\u2019s true. You were fifteen, sixteen years old at this time.",
        "Q: Do you remember how you treated Renia?",
        "Q: Was this good for you to be able to teach them, to have that time?",
        "Q: Let me go back a few years, because I was recalling that Chris said that, prior to you\u2019re\ngoing to Radom to high school, you would bring home friends and you would sit around\nand you would talk about books, and Renia said she also was listening, but she was sort\nof listening, and Chris said you wouldn\u2019t let them be part of the group because they were\nchildren. Do you have any recollection of your friends coming into the house and talking\nabout books?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember?",
        "Q: Okay. What do you remember about your parents during this period, \u201939 to \u201941, when\nthings are beginning to get tougher, but they\u2019re not quite as bad as they become? Is your\nfather working? He\u2019s lost his job, I gather.",
        "Q: \u00b033 or \u00b037?",
        "Q: So, if you would...",
        "Q: But, you did have a maid.",
        "Q: And a seamstress and a laundress, I believe, before the war.",
        "Q: So, one wouldn\u2019t have to be wealthy to bring in some people?",
        "Q: So, if you would describe...",
        "Q: When is the ghetto formed, in your view? I can\u2019t quite understand because it doesn\u2019t\nbecome a closed ghetto.",
        "Q: I think we have to change the tape.",
        "Q: ...And I think that story about that holiday, that\u2019s a wonderful st-, I mean, it\u2019s a very - I\nunderstand.",
        "Q: Hania, I want to take us back to your life in Radom, because I think it\u2019s important for us\nto get a sense of what it meant for you to be that independent, and how different it was\nfor you to be home than for your other sisters to be home. So, let\u2019s talk a little about what\nyour life was like during that time and some incidences that happened to you.",
        "Q: And why, were you not close with your aunt?",
        "Q: So, you sometimes made decisions...?",
        "Q: And I understand that the packages she would send you...",
        "Q: So, where would you then eat breakfast and lunch?",
        "Q: So, you really had a big appetite!",
        "Q: Tell me, what was it like for you to be the only Jewish kid in that school? Was that\ndifficult?",
        "Q: She got mad at you?",
        "Q: And the teachers at the school?",
        "Q: Do you know if other Jews applied to the school - other Jewish girls applied to that\nschool as well and couldn\u2019t get in?",
        "Q: Jewish girls, you mean?",
        "Q: Tell me something, going back now to the ghetto, when the Germans attach Russian in\nJune of 1941, do you remember that as being a significant change?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t? Okay. So, the ghetto experience up to the end of the ghetto, October, when do\nyou start working in the brick factory with Chris?",
        "Q: Excuse me, but the Arbeitsamt did what?",
        "Q: In the area.",
        "Q: And you were doing what?",
        "Q: Now, your mother was not working?",
        "Q: And your father was also working in the Arbeitsamt?",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re hearing rumors about the killing of Jews.",
        "Q: And does it make any connection with you about what...?",
        "Q: So, that was the strategy. And Renia, what was she doing at that time?",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about a story that Chris told, and I wanted to know if you\nremembered it and how you remembered it. She talked about all of you being outside - I\nstill don\u2019t know whether Renia was outside - you were outside somewhere where there\nwere bushes. And some guy came out and used the code word \u201cAmhat\u201d was used.",
        "Q: Amhut. You knew that he was Jewish. And he said that he escaped from Treblinka. And\nChris tells the story that she really didn\u2019t believe him; she didn\u2019t know what he was really\ntalking about. She brought him inside the house, or the apartment, or wherever you were\nstaying, to your parents, and your parents kicked you all out and talked with him. Do you\nhave any recollection?",
        "Q: So, what recollection do you have of what you\u2019re hearing about what the Nazis are\ndoing?",
        "Q: Do you remember the illness, the typhus, that your mother had?",
        "Q: Yes, this is before.",
        "Q: So, in spite of the rumors that you\u2019re hearing about the extermination of Jews, you still\nthink that they\u2019re exterminating Jews who either can\u2019t work or won\u2019t work? Or you...?",
        "Q: Did you ever get depressed during this period, before the liquidation of the ghetto?",
        "Q: But frightened.",
        "Q: Yeah. Do you remember the mood of people around you, other than your family, the way\npeople were?",
        "Q: All right, we\u2019ll stop the camera here.",
        "Q: Hania, let\u2019s talk about the night of the evacuation, or the night before. You and Chris are\nin the brick factory doing the night shift, but they don\u2019t let you go in the morning. So, tell\nme about that day and what you remember.",
        "Q: So, you were making the lists for both camps.",
        "Q: Yes, it\u2019s very important. It\u2019s very important, yes, please.",
        "Q: That would be great.",
        "Q: Go back to how the Judenrat was chosen and how the police were chosen.",
        "Q: Did they wear any special hats or anything? Did they have any way of identifying\nthemselves?",
        "Q: Can I ask you a question about somebody like Altov (ph)? How did you - how did you\nmake sense then or how do you make sense now of this kind of brutality?",
        "Q: But, the Germans didn\u2019t stop him. They didn\u2019t care that he was doing this.",
        "Q: On the Judenrat.",
        "Q: Intelligence police?",
        "Q: Maybe security police.",
        "Q: Can I ask you something? I think most people assume that Judenrat was a function inside\na ghetto, as opposed to a labor camp. Was this camp somehow in between being a labor\ncamp and a ghetto?",
        "Q: Was you in somewhat of a privileged position because of the job?",
        "Q: You were not?",
        "Q: So, whatever...",
        "Q: Did you actually have conversations with Vaschek (ph)?",
        "Q: So, how regularly were there selections? Was it regular or was it just...?",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re now in this - are you with Renia or with your father?",
        "Q: But, when you went to Majowka, 1s Majowka larger than 500 people or was it was still\nonly 500 people?",
        "Q: Can you give us some idea of what these camps looked like?",
        "Q: And, where these buildings brick?",
        "Q: Wood?",
        "Q: And, were they made specially?",
        "Q: And how terrible were the conditions? I mean, was there any water running? Where was\nthe latrines, if there were latrines?",
        "Q: Did you eat outside?",
        "Q: Did you carry bowls or did they hand them out to you?",
        "Q: I think we probably have to stop the tape now, am I right? Two minutes, all right then\nlet\u2019s stop.",
        "Q: We have lunch? I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Hania, I know that you can\u2019t remember where you ate, but can you describe the process\nof getting food and the container in which you got food and if you had a utensil, and\ndescribe the food if you can.",
        "Q: What was the soup made of?",
        "Q: And, do you remember how about how many people were being fed like this? I mean,\nwere there a lot of people working in the kitchen.",
        "Q: A few.",
        "Q: And it was a big job.",
        "Q: Do you remember being very hungry\u201d?",
        "Q: So, I guess as you progress for deprivation, you remember the least bad as being not so\nbad somehow.",
        "Q: Did you have an evening meal?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember. Tell me something about what your day would be like. How early\nwould you get up in order to go to the office?",
        "Q: Did you make up the work lists or did Vaschek (ph) tell you who would be on it?",
        "Q: So, everybody in the camp had a kind of identity card.",
        "Q: And how big were these cards?",
        "Q: How big?",
        "Q: Now, did you type these lists?",
        "Q: Did you...?",
        "Q: And did you print when you were not using the typewriter or did you handwrite?",
        "Q: And how many people worked in the same office with you?",
        "Q: What was Vaschek\u2019s (ph) wife like?",
        "Q: So, was your work day like nine, ten hours?",
        "Q: So, your day...",
        "Q: So, all day long you were doing lists and changing the things.",
        "Q: So, you really were the record keeper of the whole camp?",
        "Q: Of these two camps?",
        "Q: Was it typhoid or typhus?",
        "Q: No, I think they\u2019re two different diseases.",
        "Q: Spotted.",
        "Q: Pll have to look it up. \u2019'm not...",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Now, tell me something, were people coming into your office to talk with you or to find\nout information?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: It\u2019s very interesting that you would cry at that moment.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "Q: Did you see a lot of that kind of behavior, people...",
        "Q: Why do you think that you and your sisters remained...? You didn\u2019t do that. You kept\nwanting to be fair.",
        "Q: All right, let\u2019s get back to some of the - let me ask you, did you know the people on the\nJudenrat?",
        "Q: So, it\u2019s a small group.",
        "Q: And, what did you think of these folks and what they did?",
        "Q: Was there something like a court?",
        "Q: So, what would happen if someone really was committing a crime? I don\u2019t mean a\nGerman definition.",
        "Q: So, you really didn\u2019t have anyone in those positions who you thought were betraying the\nJews and trying to protect themselves.",
        "Q: The breakout?",
        "Q: When did you meet Adrian?",
        "Q: Adrian was?",
        "Q: So, that\u2019s why you were dating this medical student?",
        "Q: So, you weren\u2019t very close in the camp. You just knew him.",
        "Q: So, he was one of the policemen whose father was the head of the police.",
        "Q: I see. So, you\u2019re 18 in 1942 through this period. This 1s one of the worst years. Probably\nmore Jews are killed in 1942 than any other year.",
        "Q: Do you - are you hearing rumors from outside and...?",
        "Q: Wait a second, I think we have to stop at this point. We don\u2019t? All right, then, continue",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019ll take a break and change.",
        "Q: Boy, that\u2019s quite a story.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: Tell me what your relationship was like with the sisters now. Are things changing?\nYou\u2019re now 18 years old, and Renia is 13, and Chris is 16. Do you have roles with each\nother?",
        "Q: Did you ever have conflicts with each other?",
        "Q: And, how do you remember your father during this period? Do you now, after the...",
        "Q: So, that would have been true even if your mother had been there.",
        "Q: Do you think he knew that your mother was dead?",
        "Q: At that point?",
        "Q: And you? When did you think you...?",
        "Q: Did you believe him then?",
        "Q: And did you see your father deteriorating during this period?",
        "Q: So, that must have been very upsetting to you.",
        "Q: I guess deterioration sometimes takes a long time.",
        "Q: Did you get very sick with typhus?",
        "Q: Were you the first of the three?",
        "Q: So, in some sense, you think you\u2019re responsible for that?",
        "Q: Was that the first time you saw anything quite like that?",
        "Q: What sort of affect does this have on you? Do you stop feeling things? I mean, as you\nstart seeing so much brutality, what...?",
        "Q: Tell me something. I don\u2019t know whether you know this, when you fainted, when your\nfriend Sulamite (ph) was killed, and the police grabbed you and put you in the...",
        "Q: Right, the Jewish police, I understand.",
        "Q: And, we - the security police didn\u2019t stop them. It didn\u2019t matter that they took you away, I\nguess.",
        "Q: How long were you in the police barrack? Do you know?",
        "Q: Does it take you a while to get over the death of Sulamite (ph)?",
        "Q: What was her last name?",
        "Q: Sulamite (ph).",
        "Q: From Lodz?",
        "Q: When people were shot, some people died of disease, right?",
        "Q: Not starvation?",
        "Q: And, every name was given to you.",
        "Q: Even if Altov (ph) came in and shot somebody.",
        "Q: And, who would tell you the name of the person? Because Altov (ph) wouldn\u2019t know\nwho he\u2019s killing.",
        "Q: Would know?",
        "Q: So, this was clearly the worst part of your job.",
        "Q: To write down...",
        "Q: Help me to understand something, because there are people who, when you\u2019re afraid, are\nyou constantly afraid or does the terror go up and down? Because you have to watch all\nthe time, that\u2019s clear.",
        "Q: Right? So, is there a funny feeling in the pit of your...?",
        "Q: Where do you think that came from?",
        "Q: So, you might be a believer in angels or something.",
        "Q: Were you...",
        "Q: This is going to leap - just for a second - leap forward and then we\u2019ll go back. Were you\nwith the Paliszewski when Chris was told about what your mother said.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you another part of the story because what I heard from Chris was that\nyour mother, the day before the liquidation of the ghetto, came to Paliszewski...",
        "Q: No, before.",
        "Q: But the day before or two days before or something, she came to give her some things.\nAnd Chris said, this is what she heard, that your mother told her that if only my three\ndaughters will survive, I will give my life.",
        "Q: She said this to you?",
        "Q: What did that make you feel?",
        "Q: That\u2019s quite something for your mother to have said to you.",
        "Q: So, who should we talk about? Tobah (ph)? Adrian\u2019s escape? Which do you want to start\nwith?",
        "Q: Why did they kill the father, do you think, at the moment?",
        "Q: But the father knew?",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t know?",
        "Q: Did you see that killing?",
        "Q: Okay, I think we\u2019ll change the tape now.",
        "Q: Hania, before we go onto the next story, I\u2019m just wondering if you have a sense if there\nwas different treatment of men and women. Was there anything about the women\u2019s part\nof the camp that was different then the men? Were women afraid of being mistreated as\nwomen, not just being brutalized, but sexually?",
        "Q: There are two sets of possible relationships. One is between the prisoners, right?",
        "Q: And, then there is between the guards. Now, there were Ukrainian guards, and I\u2019m\nwondering, they didn\u2019t have Ros Hashanda (ph).",
        "Q: So, they wouldn\u2019t be necessarily...",
        "Q: Were women able to be in contact with men in the camp?",
        "Q: Tell me, did you menstruate in the camp.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "Q: But in Majowka.",
        "Q: How did you take care of yourself?",
        "Q: So, you were not starved enough so that you couldn\u2019t get your period. Did women get\npregnant in this camp?",
        "Q: No one got pregnant?",
        "Q: It is possible that some women came into the camp pregnant, however, even...?",
        "Q: Shall we talk about the escape and the plans for the escape? This is from 1943.",
        "Q: Where did he...?",
        "Q: No, where did it get it from?",
        "Q: Now, when the Russian...",
        "Q: But, I wanted to ask you, there was no question about whether these guys were Jewish, or\nthey said they were not Jewish?",
        "Q: Tell me something, Adrian\u2019s physical condition then... Did anybody take care of him?",
        "Q: Maybe we should stop so you can continue.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t want you to get caught in the middle.",
        "Q: Hania, before we go back to Adrian in the woods, let\u2019s talk just a little bit about him\ngetting a gun and where you think he may left it, if you have any idea, and did he have\nany experience with guns?",
        "Q: So, tell me, of these boys who were planning the break-out...",
        "Q: And, you were involved, too.",
        "Q: Right, were there other women involved as well?",
        "Q: So, how many of you would there have been, fifteen, twenty people?",
        "Q: And, when would you meet and discuss this?",
        "Q: No, I thought that might be the case, but one doesn\u2019t know how those things happen.",
        "Q: So was there one person who was the leader who then made the decision?",
        "Q: And who had experience with arms in this?",
        "Q: So, when you all were thinking about this separately - because clearly you\u2019re not\nsupposed to have conversations because it\u2019s too dangerous, right?",
        "Q: So, you were not going to take any chance.",
        "Q: But, was the idea that all fifteen or twenty, as many as...",

        "Q: When we ended the last tape, we were talking about this second break-out that you\nthought was really madness. So, all these people\u2019s bodies were just left there, and they\nwere left to die, moaning all night long. Was there, this time, a repercussion inside the\ncamp? This was still in Majowka. You were not in the third camp yet.",
        "Q: Did the Germans do anything to you who were left?",
        "Q: Did you know people who tried to escape?",

        "Q: So, how would you know - how would they count how many people there were?",
        "Q: So, you would make up a number\u2019?",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I was going to ask. This could be very dangerous if you...",

        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t spoiled. We had a very happy family life. We - I always remember singing\nand dancing at home. The parents were very good to us. They took a big part in our lives.\nThey cared a lot for us, and we were all, we were very happy then.",
        "A: My father was an educated man. He was - he didn\u2019t mix into our lives, into the kids. My\nmother took complete charge of us. She was like our friend. She was always interested in\nevery aspect of our lives, and we responded to her that way.",

        "A: That I was bossing them around, but we loved each other. We were always - we never\nhad any fights unless it\u2019s true what they say that I was bossing them around.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Clean collars.",
        "A: Yes, but that was when I was at school in Radom. I had a girlfriend, and since I was good\nat writing essays and stuff like that, I was writing her essays and she was washing my\ncollars for me, and attaching them to whatever I wore.",
        "A: That\u2019s very possible. I don\u2019t remember, but it\u2019s possible. Her things were always neatly\nhung up in the closet. I remember, we had a shelf together. My mother divided it, and she\nsays, \u201cYou will have one side, and Chris will have the other side.\u201d Hers was always\nneatly put together, and mine was a mish-mash. So, I remember my mother says, \u201cWhy\ncan\u2019t you keep it like your sister?\u201d I said, \u201cShe has a better side.\u201d So, Krysia says, \u201cOkay,\nI'll give you my side.\u201d And soon enough, this side was all neatly put together and mine\nwas all messy.",
        "A: I was a very good student. My mother - my mother calls me a genius, and I believed her.\n[Laughs. |",
        "A: That\u2019s - my mother was very proud of me because I was very well brought up, like I had\nvery nice manners and since I was a little assimilated and I had a lot of Polish girlfriends,\nusually the Polish parents did not like the Datastrassas (ph), the Jews, but since I was so\nwell brought up and polite at all time, and I was helping them with school, I was always\nwelcome to their homes, and to me, at that time, it was very important.",
        "A: It was important because I wanted to be one of them, because I felt so persecuted as a\nJew that I felt that - I just wanted - at that time, when I was a kid - don\u2019t forget, that that\nwas at the time when I was nine, eight, ten, you know - I wanted to be one of them at that\ntime.",
        "A: Actually, I felt it because I noticed that we had - in our town, there was a lot of religious\nJews. Most of the Jewish people that lived in Wierzbnik were religious, and I always saw\nPolacks, throwing stones at them, talking to them in a way that it was ridiculing them,\nand so - I, personally, since I was just a child at the time, I didn\u2019t feel it, and being with\nthe Polish girls, you know, associating with them, I didn\u2019t feel it, but I saw it on the\noutside, and that\u2019s why maybe I wanted to be one of them.",
        "A: To a point, because they - they couldn\u2019t speak Polish. I mean, they spoke Polish with an\naccent. They spoke mostly, among themselves, they spoke Yiddish, and being so very\nreligious, they had a certain mannerism that distinguished them for the other people.\nThey were dressed differently. They acted differently. They spoke differently. So, but I\nidentified with them, but sometimes I felt a little bit uncomfortable with them.",
        "A: Yes, it was - Wierzbnik-Starachowice were like twin cities, if you can call that that. That\ntotal population was 35,000, and ten percent of it were Jewish people like between 3,200\nto 3,500. And, most of them lived in Wierzbnik; some Poles lived in Wierzbnik, too.\nStarachowice was mostly - in Starachowice, there were mostly - not mostly, I would say\nalmost 95 percent Poles. They worked there because we had the munition factory there.\nThey worked there and they lived there. Some of them lived in Wierzbnik, too, but all\nJews lived in Wierzbnik.",
        "A: I left. My mother sent me to school in Radom when I was eleven years old.",
        "A: No, because I was a good student and we had what they call Gymnasium, which was a\nhigh school in Starachowice, but it wasn\u2019t one of the best. In Radom, there was - there\nwas one of the best girls\u2019 school, but it was almost impossible to get in for the Jews. At\nfirst, we had numerus klausus (ph), which meant one Jewish girl for 45 students in a class\nwould be accepted, and then in the later years it was numerus nolus (ph), which means\nnone of the Jewish girls could be accepted. So, I was lucky. You have to pass a\ncompetitive exam, and you had to really be very, very good to be accepted. So, my\nmother tried - she sent me there and I passed the exam, and at the end of the year, she\nfound out that I was accepted. So, for her it was the biggest achievement that she could\never achieve at the time which - and I went to that school there and I lived on my own.\nLike, I had relatives, but my mother placed me in a - like she rented a room, with like\nthere were kids there my age. So, she rented a room with a family, and that\u2019s where I\nstayed.",
        "A: At first it did. As a matter of fact, I cried for a long time before I went there, and when I\nfound myself there, I also felt a little bit strange, but soon I got used to it, and I got to\nknow all the people my age and a year older or a year younger, because they were several\nschools in Radom. It was a big city with 100,000 people there. They had several different\nschools. They even had a Jewish high school, called Pzhiachu Wierze (ph), which meant\n\u201cfriends of knowledge\u2019, if I were to translate it exactly. So, there were a lot of Jewish\nkids that were educated in Starachowice, Wierzbnik. The religious people didn\u2019t send the\ngirls to high school because of the fact that they had to go to school on Shabbat. You\nknow, because we had six days of school. So, the parents wouldn\u2019t let them do that. So,\nthey had a lot of other schools that were connected with the religious movement. But in\nRadom, the parents were a little bit - I mean, it was a bigger city, and there was a lot of\nyoung people that were going to those different schools, and the schools were much\nbetter than in Wierzbnik.",
        "A: Well, once I got to know the people my age, I felt very good there. As a matter of fact,\nuntil today, I have a lot of friends from Radom. And, as a matter of fact, my husband\nmade a party for them all like at the cottage a year before he died. There was fifty of us.",
        "A: At the time, languages and mathematics.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s true. [Laughs.] It was -talking about home, when he counted, he counted in\nGerman, because he was educated in German. I count - no matter what language I speak -\nif I have to count, I count in Polish. My husband, no matter what language he spoke, he\nwould count in Yiddish. And since you are talking about languages....",
        "A: I think you - like I was used to speaking - we spoke Polish at home. So, I was used to\nspeaking Polish all the time, and because I suppose that I got used to counting. I think it\u2019s\nvery normal.",
        "A: Well, I did write home. Every week my mother would send me home-baking and stuff\nlike that, a parcel, and then, whoever would travel to Radom, she would send something\nfor me. So, when this person came I wrote a letter to my parents. We didn\u2019t have a\ntelephone at all.",
        "A: One letter.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, because we were, you know, for every holy day, I went home. As a matter of fact, the\nmonth of September, since Radom was about sixty kilometers away from Wierzbnik, it\nwas a two hour ride on the train because I had to change trains half way. So, at the\nbeginning, I didn\u2019t want to go back to Radom because when I was at home it felt so good\nto be at home. So, the first month, I was traveling every day to Radom and back.",
        "A: Every day to get home. But then, then later when the days became shorter, I stayed there.\nBut I had a very, very good life in Radom because, as a say, I had lots of friends there.",
        "A: Yes, I remember them very well.",
        "A: Very close. Those were the Polish friends of my parents, and we were very close. The\nfather was - I mean, we called him a doctor. He didn\u2019t have an education, but he, I mean,\nmaybe he wasn\u2019t a doctor really, but he was acting as a doctor. And there were four\ndaughters there and they opened, how should I say, a school. Since the age of two or so,\nwe went to that school. It was like a - I don\u2019t know whether to call it a kindergarten or\nwhatever. And they taught us - they taught us to such a degree that when I went to public\nschool, the transferred me immediately the first day because I could read and write\nalready, and then I skipped again, because they were very good teachers and they were\nvery good friends of our parents. We went there for Christmas and I enjoyed so much\nseeing the Christmas tree and she had home baked cookies on the tree. We really liked it,\nand they were very, very good friends of our parents. As a matter of fact, they kept\ncertain things for us, like valuables and they - and this was the only family that returned\nour valuables after the war because I also had - we also had friends, they were also\nteachers, that we left some clothes and stuff like this, and when we came back, they\nwouldn\u2019t give us anything. Not only that they wouldn\u2019t give us anything, but they said,\n\u201cIf you are need, go to the Jewish congress.\u201d So, the Paliszewskis were very, very\nexceptional.",
        "A: Very unusual, but they weren\u2019t - maybe they were, but I thought they came from the\nRussian side so maybe they were, whatever...",
        "A: Greek Orthodox, I\u2019m not sure, maybe not, but Christmas was Christmas, so maybe they\nweren\u2019t, but they spoke with a Russian accent. They weren\u2019t born in Wierzbnik; they\ncame from the Russian side.",
        "A: I had a girlfriend, the doctor\u2019s daughter. Her name was Helena Lambaska. She had, her\nparents were - in addition that he was a doctor, he was also such a Polish aristocrat, and I\nremember them. She was a very good friend of mine right through school, right through\nthe public school and then in Radom, as well. And I remember when she came to us, she\nrode a horse and I was envious, but I was afraid of the horse.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Dog, yes, I think we had a dog called \u201cLady\u201d, but I was mostly, at this time I was away\nfrom home, but I remember it being there.",
        "A: No, \u00b035.",
        "A: Eleven.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Not conscious until - as a matter of fact, I had no idea. I mean, first of all, we knew what\nwas happening in Germany, but we - I, myself, believed that Poland is so strong that we\nare not going to be afraid of the Germans. What should I say? I really believed that\nPoland was one of the, how should I say it, the strongest countries in Europe.",
        "A: No idea.",
        "A: No fear.",
        "A: I was conscious, but I didn\u2019t believe it. Like, my father, who was educated in Germany -\nnot in Germany, in Austria, I think, but he said the German people are so good, that\nnothing - I mean, not to worry about it. That, you know, like, that\u2019s what he believed\nbecause he himself was brought up in a different atmosphere at the time.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: But, there weren\u2019t too many yet in Wierzbnik or Starachowice, but they might have gone\nto other cities. I don\u2019t remember any German people. Mind you, when I came home, my\nmother used to send me to different aunts on vacation, and they all - since I was used not\nto being at home and my mother felt that my sisters had it better because they were at\nhome and I was away., so when I came home she would send me to a relative for the\nvacation in another part of Poland. So, I really was very little in Wierzbnik.",
        "A: Very close relationship. She lived about - I don\u2019t remember. It would be about 20 or 30\nkilometers from Wierzbnik. The place was called Ostrowiec. We had three aunts and a\ngrandmother that we were very close with them. The aunts were very nice women. They\nwere running my grandmother\u2019s business, and the youngest one was going to university,\nand she finished pharmacy. We were very close with this grandmother. I was going there\nvery often, and I developed like a friendship with many kids my age there, and I like to\ngo to Ostrowiec, and my grandma liked us to come to visit her all the time. She was a\nvery - she really loved us.",
        "A: Yes, she was very religious, extremely religious. My grandfather was - I would say, he\nwas wearing the clothes that the religious Jews wore. And I remember that on her stove,\nshe had a wooden kind of a board that would divide the milk dishes, if she cooked milk\ndishes, and the other dishes on the same stove. She had this board so the vapor shouldn\u2019t\nmix with the other. My mother was Kosher, because otherwise my grandmother would\nnever eat when she would come to the house. But we were more traditional and my\nmother and father were very much involved in the Zionist movement. So, they were\nworking for Israel all the time.",
        "A: Never, no. As a matter of fact, she was very much loved by her mother and grandfather, I\nwas told. The grandfather was so religious, and his sons - I don\u2019t know whether Renta\ntold you that his sons turned to be Communist. They had to run away because the\ngrandfather wouldn\u2019t accept them. Then he sat Shiva after them because he was so\nreligious and they were Communists. So, how could that be reconciled? But my mother,\nregardless of what she was, she was very much loved by her family.",
        "A: My mother?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Yes, right, and as far as my mother is concerned, I remember she brought in a teacher and\nshe opened - because the Zionists had an organization, we had a room there - so, my\nmother was instrumental in bringing a Hebrew teacher. He lived in our house at first. He\nwas like, you know, they couldn\u2019t pay him much, and she opened the Tarbut school, and\nwe were learning the modern Hebrew.",
        "A: My mother opened it.",
        "A: I would say there was about twenty percent of families that weren\u2019t orthodox, so they\nwould send the kids there.",
        "A: No, they had their own school called Bysiarkev (ph) for the girls, and for the boys they\nwere studying at the schribus (ph) and the synagogue - the religious ones.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: High school and lyc\u00e9e, we had both. Like before the war, I finished four years of high\nschool, and after the war, I went back to high school, and then I went to university in\nPoland, what they call Cultural Diplomatic school.",
        "A: No, Germany will not do anything. I still believed it, because at school they let us believe\nthat Poland is very strong.",
        "A: No fear.",
        "A: Complete shock to us and when we had to run away from home because they were\nbombing the factories in Starachowice, and we had to run away to different villages to\njust not be - but, Poland was taken in a few days. So, soon after the Germans came in - I\nwasn\u2019t afraid of them at the beginning - but soon I learned that we have to be afraid of\nthem.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: No, I was at home. I came home for the vacation in June, and I stayed at home, and the\nwar broke out on September the 1\u201c. As I said, we had to run away. We ran away to\nwhatever close village. We stayed with some farmers, and when Poland was taken by the\nGermans, which was in a few days, we were sent home.",
        "A: It was very frightening because we did - war was something strange to us. We didn\u2019t\nknow what war means, but we when we heard the bombs flying and when we heard that\npeople got killed, we got scared. But when we returned home and the Germans came in,\nthey walked with dogs. We were afraid of them, and we were told like when we were\nwalking on the same sidewalk, we had to go off the sidewalk when the Germans were\nwalking through. So, at first we laughed that they are so proud, they are so stupid, but\nthen later we started getting scared.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "A: That we were afraid, but my father assured us that the soldiers and the government is bad,\nbut the German people are straightforward, good people, that not to be afraid of the\ncivilians, just the soldiers. But they were like, there were soldiers all over, only soldiers. I\nwas afraid of them, but we just stayed away from them as much as we could. So, we\ndidn\u2019t pay very much attention to them. Like, we did, but when we came home, at first,\nlike in 1939, there were things happening, but not - we weren\u2019t really afraid. I wasn\u2019t, at\nleast.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember this part of my life really that much.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes, first they moved - we lived on the main street, so, first of all, we were moved away\nfrom the main streets, and the ghetto was a little bit bigger, and then they squeezed us.\nWe had to move because the place where we were, they moved us again a little bit closer\nto the original ghetto. So, we moved three times. I remember all those.",
        "A: Moves, yes.",
        "A: You know, like, when I think of it now, I didn\u2019t have any idea that it\u2019s going - that it\ncould be so bad. Like, we didn\u2019t really - we didn\u2019t know what was going on around us,\nlike in Warsaw. We heard it, but we didn\u2019t want to believe it, to believe in it. But we\nwere more scared then than at the beginning, because at the beginning we lived a little bit\nmore normal, but now we had to watch every move that we made because we\u2019re not\nallowed to get out of the ghetto. We were wearing those - we wearing the armband with\nthe Jewish star in it, and if they catch you outside of the ghetto, they would kill you. I\nheard that. I had a case where I was very foolish. I had a boyfriend at the time who lived\nin Busko Zdro}. It was - but that was around \u201941 already, and the parents invited me to\ncome there, and Jews weren\u2019t allowed to travel. So, they had hotels there. It was a place\nlike where they had cures for arthritis and they owned hotels there. The Germans took\naway their hotels, but they worked there as workers. So, they send me a work order that I\nwas supposed to work in the hotel. That was just - it was just for the purpose of me being\nable to go, to travel. So, I remember I went to Kielce, which was a place where the train\nstopped, and like when I say stopped, the train line stopped and there were buses going to\nBusko, and I couldn\u2019t get on this train. I couldn\u2019t get on the bus because they sent the\nJews to the very end, and I was wearing this band, and the Jews to the very end. So, I was\nwaiting the whole day there, and all the time, the Jews to the very end, I had to stay in\nline. So, I decided - I didn\u2019t have any fear at the time - I decided to just hitchhike to\nBusko, because I figured I couldn\u2019t do anything else. So, what did I do? I took off my\nband, put it in my purse, and then I stood on the corner and a car stopped and it was a\nguy, a German-speaking guy. He asked me if I would like a lift, and I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I said, \u201cTo Busko.\u201d So, he says, \u201cGet in.\u201d So, I get in, and\nhe started speaking to me. He asked me - I didn\u2019t know who he was. I had no idea. It was\na German. I was scared to death. That\u2019s the first time I was scared, but I was already\nsitting there. So, he started asking me where am I going. I said, \u201cI go there.\u201d He said,\n\u201cFor what?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a job there.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d So, of course, I gave a\nPolish name because I was afraid Laks was a Jewish name. I couldn\u2019t say that my name is\nso and so. So, anyway, what he was, he was like a troihinder (ph) of the Jewish\nbusinesses. What it meant - the Germans took away the Jewish businesses, and he was\nlike - he was checking on all those businesses, and among others, he was checking on this\nfamily that I was going to. So, I told him that I\u2019m going to work there, and that was okay.\nSo, he stopped in a place called Miernic (ph) because he had some business to do there.\nSo, he asked me to sit in the car and he would take me because he was going to Busko.\nSo, a Polish guy - in each city they had a Polish supervisor, in each town and city like on\nhis way because he was the main one. He was in charge of it, but the Polacks were\nsupervising those Jewish businesses. The Polack recognized me that I was Jewish. He\nrecognized me. He didn\u2019t tell me anything, although I spoke Polish perfectly, and I\nthought I didn\u2019t look Jewish. He recognized that I was Jewish. So, when the guy came\nback, I noticed that he went and he told him, and this fellow - he was so nice to me all the\nway - he came and he says, \u201cBist du eiben?\u201d So, I said, \u201cYah.\u201d So, he screamed - do you\nunderstand what that means, \u201cBist du eiben.\u201d - \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d So, I said, \u201cYes.\u201d So,\nhe said, \u201cWo hast du die Armband?\u201d That means, \u201cWhere is your band?\u201d So, I was stupid\n- at that time I was crystal clear like as far, I was so idealistic. I never lied, and I was so\nwell brought up. So, I took my purse, and I took it out and showed it to him. He took me\nby the collar, threw my out, threw my suitcase. The suitcase fell apart, and he took - it\u2019s a\ngood thing he didn\u2019t kill me because he could have. He was so embarrassed, you know,\nin front of the Polack, the Polish supervisor that he didn\u2019t know what to do. So, he ran to\nthe car so fast, and then the Polish guy comes to me and says, \u201cDo you have anywhere to\ngo in Miernic?\u201d So, I said to him, \u201cAs a matter of fact I do. I know a doctor here, and his\nname is Dr. Reichman.\u201d And I remember and he says, \u201cI can take you.\u201d So, he carried my\nsuitcase. He carried my suitcase to Dr. Reichman there. He wasn\u2019t even embarrassed. He\ncaused all the trouble, because otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have had any trouble. I\u2019m telling you\nonly how - not only that I was idealistic, but I was so naive, and I\u2019Il tell you, stupid to a\ncertain point because, I mean, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I just took a...hitchhiked. So, I\ndon\u2019t know what I was referring to when I told you the story when you asked me.",
        "A: The Poles could, and I never - believe me, by accident, I don\u2019t know how he knew that I\nwas Jewish, and then I had to call my boyfriend from this doctor\u2019s place, that I\u2019m here\nand he worked for the Germans as a chauffer at the time. He was a medical student, but\nhe was working for the Germans as a chauffer, so the German - his boss of him came to\npick me up, and then from that time on, I was just sitting there. I was afraid that, because\nhe knew what I was, I thought he would come and kill me. But, that\u2019s how I trusted\npeople.",
        "A: I never told him. I never asked him, but I thought that it was - like, 1t was almost cruel\nbecause, I mean, the Germans, they all carried guns with them, and if he could kill me,\nnobody would ask questions.",
        "A: No, we did, and I did, and I had a letter where I\u2019m going to work. I wasn\u2019t going to work,\nas I told you, and he never asked me. I\u2019 Il tell you, whenever I\u2019m late from that time on,\nwhenever I met a German, I pretended that I don\u2019t understand German. I thought that was\nthe best - that was the best, if I couldn\u2019t - if I don\u2019t understand. I always said, \u201cNo.\u201d",
        "A: Because I figured that if speak German well, he will ask me more questions. This way\nthey won\u2019t ask any questions.",
        "A: I was so straightforward, my father used to that he didn\u2019t like it.",
        "A: No, I never.",
        "A: No, I did get there, but this letter and the request for work was only for me to be able to\ntravel, because otherwise I couldn\u2019t get out, being Jewish, I couldn\u2019t get out of the ghetto.\nBut if I got a permit to work somewhere, I was allowed to - of course, I had to wear my\nband - but I did wear my band until I couldn\u2019t get on the bus, and if I stayed in Kielce,\nthere was no place I could go anywhere, and I wasn\u2019t sure whether the next bus will take\nme.",
        "A: White with the Jewish star, but at the time, when I went hitchhiking, I didn\u2019t wear the\nband.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t afraid because I knew that I looked Polish. I have no accent that would nobody\nwould recognize me. I was told so many times in my lifetime that I don\u2019t look Jewish that\nI believed it. I just told him a false name. Like, he asked me what my name was, so, I told\nhim Lisowska, or whatever was a Polish name, the first name that came to my mind.",
        "A: I spoke German with him, like, to a point, but I did speak German because he didn\u2019t\nspeak Polish.",
        "A: If you knew how he screamed at me when he threw me out of this car. He just took me by\nmy collar and just threw me. He was so embarrassed. He wouldn\u2019t have done that if the\nPolack wouldn\u2019t look at it. I don\u2019t think so. Maybe I\u2019m wrong.",
        "A: I was, like, shortly before the war, when I was fifteen.",
        "A: Yeah, but when you say dating, it wasn\u2019t dating. We went in groups. We never went one\nby one. Like, we met - we were going to movies together. So, there was a whole group of\nboys and girls, and of course, I had my favorite, or he had his favorite, but we were going\nalways together, not by ourselves.",
        "A: Yeah, I loved it.",
        "A: The old movies, Jeannette MacDonald and all those, the musicals. It was really like -\nevery student was going at least once a week to the movies, at least once a week.",
        "A: American movies, yeah, we didn\u2019t have any others.",
        "A: Yeah, but we had subtitles.",
        "A: In Polish",
        "A: Singing with - that was one of my most favorite movies. Her movies were - and Shirley\nTemple, of course, at the time, because she was so cute.",
        "A: No, there were different movies. As a matter of fact at that time, we were collecting the\nmovie stars photos and we were exchanging them. This was like a treasure. We were\nbuying all those photos and putting them into an album, and then if - because they were\nquite expensive those photos - so if you had some doubles or if you didn\u2019t like some, you\ncould always exchange it with someone else because everybody had an album and\nphotos.",
        "A: Yeah, both.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, really I don\u2019t remember. We often, when we get together, we often\ntalk about the, the albums that we had.",
        "A: I had no idea where we got them, but we had to buy them like...",
        "A: Oh, that was during the war.",
        "A: That was during - school\u2019s finished for us. The war finished, like, we were not allowed to\ngo to any schools. So, there was nothing else to do, and the people thought that I was\nintelligent, that I was smart, that I was going to Radom to school. It was a myth really.\nSo, the parents started coming and asking whether I could give them lessons. So, I had\ntwo sisters. So, I figured I\u2019Il open this - 1t wasn\u2019t a school - whoever wanted to come,\nlike, people that were more or less on that level, on Renia\u2019s level I had a few, and on\nChris\u2019s level I had a few, and Chris was teaching. She was also teaching, but she was\nteaching younger kids, and I was good at school because when I was in Radom, I had a\nFrench teacher who just, I don\u2019t know, she liked me, loved me. So, when people had\nproblems with the French language - and I learned very fast - so when people had\ntroubles, she says, she made me a tutor. So, right from the beginning almost. And, if I\nwas their tutor, they passed. No, but most likely, I could do it. So, you know, I had a little\nbit of experience from Radom. So, when I came home during the war, my pupils were\nvery happy with me. Some of them were until today - as a matter of fact, I went now to\nthe Wierzbnik Society meeting and I met two of my pupils. They kissed me and went,\n\u201cMy lovely teacher.\u201d And I was not very much older than them.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s true.",
        "A: Pll tell you. I think that I treated them well. I thought that, but I was very strict with my\npupils, and especially strict with Renia. Renia says that I was sometimes I\u2019d give her a\nsmack. I don\u2019t remember it. Renia must tell you. As a matter of fact, one day, Renia, like,\nwhen we arrived here, we got together the three of us, and Renia says that she remembers\nthat I gave, you know, I smacked her a few times. So, I said, and I started crying because\nI didn\u2019t remember. I said, \u201cWhy would I do it?\u201d So, she wanted to be nice to me, and on\nthe way home they came back out. She stopped somewhere. She called me. She said,\n\u201cYou know what? I remind myself that I gave it back to you.\u201d She wanted me to feel\nbetter. She didn\u2019t, but I don\u2019t remember it. Maybe it\u2019s true, but I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I was very, you know, like I was really happy to be a teacher because I noticed that the\nkids - those kids looked at me with such admiration. So, I really enjoyed it, and I know\nthat Renia\u2019s friend - the one in Israel - whenever she talks to me on the phone, she recites\nall the poems, even the Latin poems, that I made them memorize. I myself remember it.\nAs a matter of fact, when I was in the university in Toronto after the war, after I came to\nCanada, and on my first - I took - the first course I took was French. So, I remember all\nthe French Canadians, they speak perfect French. I wasn\u2019t - my French was only from\nschool, so I couldn\u2019t speak so fluently, but I remember grammar and everything much\nbetter, and one day the teacher comes when we were taking La Fontaine, that\u2019s a French\npoet, and he says, \u201cDoes any of you remember any poems?\u201d And, remember that this is\nyears and years after; that was when I was already Canada and we came here in 1948, and\nI didn\u2019t go to school until 1970. So, that was in 1970. So, I said to him, \u201cI remember\nMaitre Corbeau,, but I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019d remember it all.\u201d So, he said, \u201cWould you\nlike to try it?\u201d So, I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d So, I closed my eyes like this and I started and I\nremembered the whole poem. So, after I finished, the whole class stood up and clapped,\nand I was so proud that I remembered, because, you know, it\u2019s how many years from\n1939 to 1970?",
        "A: I had a lot of friends. I always had a lot of friends, but you know, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah, he lost his job. First of all, he lost his job because he was assessing the forests and\nstuff like that for the government. In 1933, he lost the job and he lost his pensions.",
        "A: No, he lost his - the government job in \u201933, and then he started working in the same\ncapacity for private enterprise, which wasn\u2019t the same, and the reason why they let him\ngo because they didn\u2019t want to pay his pension, or because he was Jewish, they didn\u2019t\nwant to pay his pension. So, my parents went - they struggled but we lived normally like\nany other, because the Jewish people - the Jewish population, especially the religious\nones, they were tradesmen, small businessmen. They were all poor, like, they weren\u2019t\nrich people. So, although we were quite - we lived quite modestly, we weren\u2019t any\ndifferent than any other people. I remember, my mother learned a trade but it was, you\nknow, I don\u2019t really remember exactly what - my father was also selling something. I\ncouldn\u2019t tell you really exactly what they did during the war.",
        "A: Riches wasn\u2019t important then.",
        "A: Yes, we did.",
        "A: Yeah, they were coming once a month. It wasn\u2019t that they were there all the time. We\ndidn\u2019t have a maid continuously. We did - there were two sisters where we lived that they\nwere doing this kind of work. So, like, to wash the laundry, I don\u2019t know if they were\ncoming once a month or every two weeks. I couldn\u2019t tell you. I don\u2019t really remember,\nbecause during the war, during ghetto we didn\u2019t have any help any more and Renia and\nKrysia would remember more of what we had right before the war because they were at\nhome.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: But, my parents were both educated. So, that was the difference between them and - I\nmean, there were a few others that were like my parents, but most of the people were\nreligious, educated only - that\u2019s all they knew: how to pray and how to... You know, that\nwas the type - that\u2019s the type of people that lived in our town.",
        "A: No, at first - I would think that was \u201941, maybe \u201940 - when they moved us from our first\nlocation to the second location, and they were closing on, but it wasn\u2019t closed. We were\nnot supposed to get out of the camp unless we had a work permit or whatever. That\u2019s how\nclose to the, how should I say, October the 27\", people were going to work, too, because\nwe had an Arbeitsamt, a German Arbeitsamt that said - enlisting people for work. And a\nlot of people from the villages were coming to Starachowice already in the ghetto to look\nfor work, but they had to come somehow, maybe they were brought by the Germans, I\ncouldn\u2019t tell you, but I know that we had an Arbeitsamt, which 1s a labor bureau,\nwhatever you call it, where people were coming and asking for work because they knew\nfrom the other places that only the ones that will work will live. Because we heard what\nwas going in Warsaw and all over. So, people - as a matter of fact I was working in the\nArbeitsamt, and my father and I we both worked in the Arbeitsamt.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: But, you know, I cried my eyes out, and, again, the people that I knew in Radom, the\nJewish people that were sending their kids to high school there because it was expensive,\nwell-to-do people. So, at that time, 1t wasn\u2019t nice to be - you had to be rich. You wouldn\u2019t\nadmit that you weren\u2019t. So, let\u2019s say my mother was sending me home baking on Friday.\nEvery Friday she would send me a parcel with someone who was going that way. And\nmy girlfriends loved my mother\u2019s baking. And this was for the whole week for me to eat!\nBecause I didn\u2019t, you know, it wasn\u2019t that she was, she says, \u201cOh, today is Friday! Let\u2019s\ngo to Hania. She has her mother\u2019s cake!\u201d And those kids, they didn\u2019t miss anything. You\nknow, they were rich kids. They ate all my cakes. My mother would buy me fruits like\noranges that were extremely expensive, but for me, maybe one orange, maybe a few\ngrapes. You know, she would do the best she could. And they ate everything and I didn\u2019t\nhave what to eat for the whole week.",
        "A: Well, I lived in - my mother used to rent a room for me in a friend\u2019s place or whatever\nand I lived there for the 10 months; for the vacation I went home. And she did the best\nshe could. She washed my laundry every week. I sent her my laundry to be washed at\nhome because I didn\u2019t have the facilities. And every week she would send me the home\nbaking and the best she could, she could afford to buy at the time: some fruits that were\nimported that were so expensive that only the sick ones would get them sometimes. And I\nwas very good at school, so I had no problem there. I always had straight A\u2019s. My parents\nwere very proud of me; they were always bragging. And I also tutored French, and I was\npaid for those lessons, so this was my spending money. We could go to a movie or for ice\ncream, like, we were going in groups, but it was expensive, so I could afford to pay for it\nbecause I was making some money there. And for holidays, I usually used to come home,\nbut for the Yom Kippur and the Rosh Hashana, I not always could because it was the\nbeginning of school and I didn\u2019t want to miss - don\u2019t forget, I was the only Jewish girl in\nour class, so I couldn\u2019t afford to miss a week of school at the very beginning. So, I\nremember, one year I was living with the professor, the professor\u2019s family, and for the\nholidays, I also had an aunt living, an aunt and uncle in Radom. My uncle was the brother\nof my father, but I didn\u2019t live with them. I lived with this family. And the lady of the\nhouse asked me what am I going to do for the holidays. So, I couldn\u2019t say \u201cnothing\u201d\nbecause I didn\u2019t want to be invited by them, because it is a family holiday and they had\ntheir family. So, she says, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d So, I said to her, \u201cMy aunt invited\nme for dinner.\u201d So she said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s good.\u201d So when they sat at the table, I went out\non the street, and you know, that was - all the smells were so, I mean, so inviting\neverywhere. And I wasn\u2019t invited to my aunt\u2019s for the holidays. I was walking the streets\nuntil I got tired, and I sat down on a stone somewhere near the road and started crying. I\ncried myself to death. I was so hungry and I was thinking of the house and I was envious\nof my sisters being there, you know, with the whole family and eating well and all. So, I\nreally felt very bad and I couldn\u2019t go home until they finished the dinner because I went\nto my aunt\u2019s officially, so when I came home, and they were already - I heard the dishes\nbeing washed and put away - and I went to bed. I was so hungry. I was so hungry, so I\ncried all night. That\u2019s how I remember one of the incidents of being independent.",
        "A: No, my aunt was very envious that I was - from the beginning, when I was accepted,\nwhen my mother brought me to Radom and when I passed the exam and the results were\nbeing, like, \u2018til the end of the summer, the results were unknown. So, my aunt says to my\nmother, \u201c\u201cWhat do you expect? You come from a small town there, and you come from\nWierzbnik, that they\u2019ll accept you with open arms? First of all, she has to pass as the best\nexam because she\u2019s Jewish. Secondly, what do you expect? They have in Radom a lot of\npeople that they know, and they\u2019re prominent people, that they\u2019ll accept you?\u201d And she\nsays, \u201cThe hair will grow on my wrist if she would be accepted.\u201d So, anyway, towards\nthe end, my mother registered - at the same time, she registered me at the Jewish\ngymnasium. And when she came to look at the results, she went by herself because she\nwas sure that I won\u2019t be accepted. So, she went there and, sure enough, I was accep- my\nname was there, so she fainted. And then my aunt and the whole family wanted to be sure\nthat this is true, they all went to see whether it\u2019s true. But that wasn\u2019t the only - I talked to\nher many times. We had many conversations because she was in America. And she\nknows that she did me wrong. But she had two sons and she says that she didn\u2019t want me\nto live in her house because the sons were my age, and that was her explanation.",
        "A: No. I mean, I had to make decisions the way I could. I was just a kid. I couldn\u2019t call my\nparents; we didn\u2019t have a telephone. I remember it one time, I was sick, and I was living\nin another place where, like, I had a girlfriend in the family, so they accepted me, and I\nshared her room. And I got sick, so my landlady called my mother to come and pick me\nup because, I mean, she wasn\u2019t ready to look after a sick child. So, my mother came and\npicked me up and took me home for a week or two until I recovered and I came back.",
        "A: Yeah, the packages - every Friday she would - because she baked for - every Friday she\nbaked a babka, and other very - I mean, her baking was very good - and every Friday, she\nwould send me a parcel containing, like, her baking and some imported fruit, a little bit of\nthis, a little bit of that, which was very special and very expensive. And I had a lot of\nfriends in Radom that visit me many times, and we went out with them to the movies.\nAnd they knew that on Friday night, I would get a parcel with all the goodies, so they\nsay, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Hania because she got a parcel!\u201d\u2019 But those kids were at home and they\ndidn\u2019t miss anything, and I didn\u2019t have anything for the week. I mean, except for the\ndinner that I was given. Like, when my mother paid for the room, she paid also for one\nmeal for me to eat, a hot meal, and the rest I was supposed to buy by myself.",
        "A: In my room, but you know, like, it wasn\u2019t like - I would have a bagel and cheese or\nsomething. And I remember I had a tremendous appetite, and one day my father came to\nvisit me. And on the way from the train, he stopped to buy bagels - not bagels, I think\nrolls, kaiser rolls - and cheese, because I really liked the yellow cheese. So, he bought six\nrolls for me to have for the week or whatever. And I remember, he never forgot to\nmention it that I had all six rolls at one time. [Laughs. |",
        "A: Tremendous, because I grew very fast. When I came to Radom, I was the smallest one in\nmy class, but when I was thirteen years old, I grew twelve centimeters. I was the tallest\none in my class. And from there on, when we carried the insignia of the school, the tallest\nused to get it, I used to be the one.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t difficult because - I had a few kids that were really ridiculing me, they called\nme all kinds of names - but they were just a few. But in general, I tried to be like them. I\nhelped them out, I stayed after school, did their assignments, helped them with\neverything, like, for free because I wanted so badly to mix with them. And certain people,\nones, I learned to disregard what they were saying. They called me all sorts of names. I\u2019m\nnot saying \u2018they\u2019 because there were a couple of such girls. I remember them very well.\nSo if they called me such names, I just pretended not to hear. But I had also one case\nwhere the parents treated me very badly. I was sitting at one desk with a girl called Janina\nKremska (ph). Her father was a judge; I don\u2019t know what her mother - her mother was\napparently not well. I couldn\u2019t tell you - I have never before been in her house. Before we\nleft she offered that she would take me to the station. We had some time yet. So, I took\nmy suitcase and - when we got our school certificate at the end of the year, our marks -\nso, She says, \u201cYou come, we\u2019ll have lunch at our house, and I\u2019Il take you to the station,\nPll help you.\u201d So I went to her house. She wasn\u2019t a very good student. Anyway, the\nmother asked her to show her her report card. So, the mother looked and didn\u2019t say\nanything. So, before she set the lunch, she asked me if I\u2019d show her mine. So, I always\nhad straight A\u2019s, I mean, that was to me - I took it out without even thinking that I could\nhave told her that I don\u2019t want to because I knew Janina Kremska (ph) wasn\u2019t such a\ngood student. She got so mad, she threw me out of the house!",
        "A: At me. She got mad at me, but she told me later the father apologized. He came down\nlater and he apologizes. He said to me that she\u2019s not - she\u2019s not - that she\u2019s sick. But I\ndidn\u2019t notice that she should be sick. She just threw me out, she told me to go. So, you\nsay, \u201cHow did they treat you?\u201d Well, that was my best friend!",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s also, some - all the teachers were - the French teacher was Catholic, but she\nwas converted. She was really Jewish. She loved me - I had no problems with her. And\nthe teachers in general liked me because I was a good student. Like, even in Latin, I was\ngetting harder work, like when we had an exam at school, she would put me at the end of\nthe class with a longer exam because she didn\u2019t want me to sit there while the others were\nstill struggling. So, the teachers liked me because I was a good student. As a matter of\nfact, there was a mathematics teacher, her name was Kostetska (ph). Nobody ever had a -\nlike, we had numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, so 5 was the best, you know, it\u2019s like \u2018very good\u2019 here.\nI was the only one that, throughout the school, I used to get 5. My friend still today says,\n\u201cIf you got a 5 from Kostetska (ph), you\u2019re lucky.\u201d So, the teachers all liked me, but the\nsecretary - the secretary, whenever I went there, she made very bad remarks to me. One\nday, she says, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I said, \u201cAnna Laks.\u201d She says, \u201cYour name isn\u2019t\nAnna. Your name is Hannah.\u201d I says, \u201cNo, my name is Anna.\u201d And she says, \u201cNo, your\nname is Hannah.\u201d And she emphasized the \u2018H\u2019 because she couldn\u2019t stand it that my\nname was Polish while I was Jewish. And she was mean to me, but I mean, I didn\u2019t come\nin contact with her too much, only when I had to bring my parents\u2019 check for the tuition.\nBut I did feel a little bit of anti-Semitism, but I disregarded it completely because most of\nthe girls were really nice to me. There was 45 of us and we met after school, and then\nthere were dances. I didn\u2019t have any problem because - there was a similar men\u2019s\ngymnasium under the same name as ours - so, once a year we had a dance, so they put all\nthe boys in a row and the girls in a row, and whoever you met you had to dance. So, I\nnever had any problems, but I heard from a friend - as a matter of fact we just talked the\nother day about it - from a male friend that, he was standing across from one Polish girl\nand she was so cute, and then she says, \u201cI don\u2019t dance with Jews.\u201d He says he felt so bad\nbecause it never happened before because he was a good-looking boy. So, there were -\nbut as I said, the few incidents that were happening to me I tried to disregard because\notherwise I couldn\u2019t live with them. I was the only one!",
        "A: Oh, yes, because I have here - there 1s how many are we here? There are about five of us\nleft from that school, and we still meet here.",
        "A: Yes, because one year they accepted four girls instead of one girl, and after that it was\nnumerus nolus already. Why four girls? Because one of the girls that lives here in Miami,\nher father had a brick factory, so he built a gymnasium for the school for free, so they\naccepted the four girls. When I say gymnasium, like exercise, a big exercise gymnasium\nfor the school. He donated the bricks and the labor.",
        "A: I don\u2019t.",
        "A: Okay, first I worked in Arbeitsamt, and they closed this - maybe I should also not tell you\nthat a German, before we got sent to the camp, that a German under the name Pohl - P-O-\nH-L - who was the Lagerftihrer of Majowka, he was coming to recruit some people, like,\npick some other new people, you know, to work. He noticed me working in the office\nthere, and so he was always telling us things, that the ghetto is going to be liquidated. But\nhe didn\u2019t tell us when; he only told us that it\u2019s going to be liquidated. Anyway, towards\nthe end, the last time he came to the office, he told us that the ghetto is going to be\nliquidated the day later than in reality it was. So, we had an idea. So, Arbeitsamt - about\ntwo weeks before they liquidated the ghetto, they closed the Arbeitsamt. The Arbeitsamt\nwasn\u2019t needed anymore because the people that had the war cards already were located.\nAnd Krysia and I...",
        "A: They were assigning people - like, they were employing people. They were assigning\npeople to different factories",
        "A: In the area. We had, we had the worker, where they were making bullets, they\nwere making guns. This was a war kind of factory, a big factory. Rogalin (ph) was a\nplace where they were making bricks. So, towards the end, when we knew that we have\nto work somewhere else, that we have to get our cards, Krysia and I started working -\nthey closed the Arbeitsamt, let\u2019s say, I think 1t was about two weeks before the\nliquidation. It could have been three weeks or maybe shorter, I couldn\u2019t tell you. But we\nstarted working in this factory, on the night shift, Chris and I. Like, when they liquidated\nthe ghetto, we had to find another job. When they liquidated the Arbeitsamt, I started\nworking for this brick factory and Krysia worked with me at night.",
        "A: We were making bricks. Like, there were machines, but we stayed in water, I mean, the\nwater was dripping, and we were making those bricks. We were putting the stuff in those\nmachinery and when the bricks were coming out, we were working...",
        "A: No, but I provided her, like, a card, too. I mean, she wasn\u2019t working just for her to have a\ncard. Everybody had to have a working card.",
        "A: No, he worked in the Arbeitsamt. And I don\u2019t remember what - I don\u2019t think that he - or\nmaybe he went to work? I couldn\u2019t tell you later. I couldn\u2019t tell you because it was very\nshort-lived. That was a very hard time for all of us because we heard already that there\nwas that village and this village, and they were bringing the people to Starachowice\nbecause, in these villages, they only had a few - not too many Jews, because the\nliquidation was for the whole district there.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: It did, it did. But we felt that if we worked, we will survive, because that was the -\neverybody believed that if you worked, you save your life. Because I don\u2019t think they\npaid for the labor. I don\u2019t remember whether we got paid for the work when we\nwere making bricks, but once you worked, you saved your life.",
        "A: Renia, I don\u2019t know what she was doing before, because she was, during the liquidation,\nshe was at the marketplace with Mother and Father, and Krysia and I were at work\nbecause we worked night shift.",
        "A: Amhut.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, no.",
        "A: We were scared but we believed, we somehow believed that if we have work, we\u2019 ll\nsurvived. So, that was our main - like, we tried to work, to have the proper papers to\nprove that we work.",
        "A: I remember my mother being very sick. I remember this, that she almost died. But she\nwas sick at home. That wasn\u2019t in the camp.",
        "A: It was before. I remember it very well, and I remember the Paliszewskis were coming to the\nhouse to help with that. Renia will tell you.",
        "A: We still, we couldn\u2019t believe that things like that could happen. Although we heard about\nit, we tried to work in order to save our lives, but we still did not believe that they are\nexterminating them. We still believed that they are deporting them somewhere for other\nwork. But we wanted to stay where we are because we knew already what it was.",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t - I was so engrossed in saving our lives. I was always trying to save\nmy life. And I knew that I will eventually die, whether I will be killed that way or the\nother way, but life was so precious that we concentrated more on how to live than how...\nI don\u2019t remember being depressed.",
        "A: Frightened.",
        "A: Other than my family, I don\u2019t remember. But while we\u2019re talking about it, I will tell you,\nthe grown-ups were more scared. Because, see, when you are young, you\u2019re daring, and\nyou are not so afraid because you think to yourself, \u201cI will run away.\u201d That\u2019s why we\u2019re\nthinking of uprising inside the camp already in Starachowice, because we didn\u2019t want to\nbe killed just like we heard that other people are getting killed.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: We are expecting the liquidation of the ghetto a day later. My mother prepared everyone\nof us had a knapsack, I mean, whatever, so that when we are going to work anywhere, it\nwas a little bit of clothes, you know, and it was - but a change - some shoes maybe or so.\nSo, everybody had it ready for the next day. But, unfortunately we went to work in our\nwork clothes for the night, not knowing that the liquidation would be that night. So, we\ndidn\u2019t take anything with us, only the way we were. And at night we noticed on the roof\nof the factory, like through the window - through the roof - above the roof of the factory,\nwe saw people walking toward the station, walking, and Germans with dogs and we were\nwondering what happened. So, we knew that the liquidation is going on, and we tried to -\nI mean, it wasn\u2019t far from the station, but we couldn\u2019t - we only saw lots of people\nwalking slowly with kids, but we didn\u2019t see any of our relatives or friends. We tried to.\nThey told us that we will go straight to camp. At that time, we had three ready camps to\nmove in. Strzelnica, which was the biggest camp, Majowka, which was the smallest\ncamp. So, just to give you an idea, let\u2019s say in Strzelnica, they could keep a thousand\npeople. Majowka was about five hundred. I mean, it\u2019s not exact, but just to give you an\nidea that Majowka was a smaller camp, and they had a third camp called Tartak (ph).\nThis camp - it was a sawmill and they only had room for about a hundred workers. So,\nsome people, as you know, from the marketplace, they all went to Strzelnica, the ones\nthat were chosen to work. The ones that were chosen to die, at that time nobody knew\nwhere they were going, went to the train station. We were sent direct to Majowka, and in\nMajowka this Pohl, guy was the Lagerfiihrer. He was in charge of that Lager. So, when\nwe arrived there, he right away - I mean, since he knew that I had experience, he put me\nin his office. I don\u2019t remember what Krysia was to do. Then, we found out that - we\ndidn\u2019t know who survived. We didn\u2019t know whether Renia was alive, whether my father\nwas alive - I didn\u2019t know that, whether my mother is alive. We had no idea. We were sent\nto Majowka, and Renia and Father were sent to Strzelnica. Of course, my father went to\nthe office right away because they knew him also from the Arbeitsamt. And I don\u2019t\nremember whether that day or some other day we found out that my mother didn\u2019t make\nit, that she was sent out together with the other people. We believed that they were sent\nsomewhere else. We never believed that they were going to Treblinka although we heard\nabout Treblinka many times, but in our mind, we couldn\u2019t believe that atrocities like that\ncould happen. So, life was hard. Like, the people that went to Strzelnica, started going to\nwork right away. I don\u2019t remember what Krysia did. Maybe she was working with... I\ndon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember where she worked. A few days later, and Vaschek (ph)\nwas in charge of the other Lager, came to inspect what - because he was actually in\ncharge of the two Lagers; Pohl was in the smaller camp. He came to the office. He\nlooked at my work, and he says, \u201cYou know what?\u201d I think that because he liked the way\nI wrote those lists, you know, those - we started - what did we do at the office? We kept\nrecords of all the people that lived there. Everyone had a card. On the card, it was his\nname, the barrack number, because, I mean, the date of birth, and the barrack number,\nand where he worked. Then, from those cards, we were making up lists - daily work lists\n- because they were different departments in the factory and those workers, like, in the\nmorning, you would call the names and they would go to those, and the next day maybe\nthey were changed. So, I was making all those lists. So, I remember Vaschek (ph) liked\nthe way I make the lists and he says, \u201cFrom now on,\u201d he sent my father. So, Krysia was\nwith my father, and since Renta was in Strzelnica, I was sent to Strzelnica to do the work\nthere, to work in the office. Now, Ill just mention it, because if somebody died, was\nkilled, whatever, most of the people were very strong, the ones that committed\nthemselves to work, so they didn\u2019t die the normal way. Most of them were either killed\nhere or there. We used to write down in the Polish \u201cdeceased\u201d, and we kept the cards\nseparate. Otherwise, we knew exactly how many people we have in each camp. Tartak\n(ph) was a separate unit. They had their own office and their own people. They - it wasn\u2019t\nconnected. But those two camps were connected.",
        "A: I was keeping all the records. The records to - Vaschek (ph) - maybe I'll talk about him\nwhen I talk about the other Germans - he kept under lock and key; that was in his office.\nAnd in the morning was allowed to go in there, take whatever I needed to do the - to\nprepare whatever, and I had to put it back in his office and he was the only one that had\naccess. I didn\u2019t have any access to any of those records. I was doing what I was supposed\nto, I put it in the place, and it went under lock and key. Now, the structure - are you\ninterested in the structure?",
        "A: So, Pll start with Strzelnica. The same was in Majowka. We had a Judenrat - first the\nJewish people - we had a Judenrat, we had the police, and we had people that were in\ncharge of the - where they lived in the barracks. The Judenrat were the elders - do you\nneed the names?",
        "A: Mr. Minzberg (ph), Mr. Billingriecht (ph), Mr. Einisemann (ph), Mr. Wolfowicz (ph).\nThe police - there were 12 policemen, 12 Jewish policemen, and one in charge, and the\none in charge was my husband\u2019s father. Then there were Ukrainians - guards. They\nwere...",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell you because when I came to Strzelnica, that was already a done fact. What\nthe police were doing. The policemen had no rights of any sort, just gather together the\npeople in the morning. They were supposed to keep an order inside the Lager, but people\nat that time were very orderly, they were doing what they were supposed to do. So, there\nwas no problem of this sort, but their main job was to bring all those people - they came\nto the office, got the list, this one, this one. So, they would round up those people that\nwere going to this department, this department. The policemen would take them to the\ngate, and from the gate, the Ukrainians would take over. And, they were supposed to\nkeep an order, and of course, when the Germans used to come and whatever they had to\ndo, they were using them to do what - what should I say? They had no arms, no - not only\nno arms, no sticks, no anything. Like, there was about 12 of them.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. They must have had, but I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t remember, to\ntell you the truth. Then, there was Judenrat. They were in charge, you know, of - they\nwere responsible for the kitchen and for the supplies and, you know, in general - the\nGermans would dump the food and dump it, and they were in charge of all those, I mean,\nthey were running a camp where was a thousand or over people. So, they had to be fed,\nthey had to be clothed, they were bringing the clothes at one time and just dump it. And\nat the office, let\u2019s say, I and maybe another two or three girls to help were giving out the\nclean stuff for the people, like because, you know, and they were responsible for the\ninside of the camp. And there was a lot of - there was a lot of bribery going on. They had\nto pay the Germans off for this and for whatever. They did the smallest favor, they were\ncollecting whatever they could collect. And a lot of the Germans were only asking for\nbribes. Now, what was - so, the guards - I'll go back now to the guards - the guards were\nwatching the gate. There was a tower, one tower near the gate where they watching, and\nas I said, they were taking people to work and from work, and they were transporting\nwhatever had to be transported. Now, the guards were Ukrainians. Then there were\nGermans, heads of the guards. So, there was three of them. There was Schrodt - he was\nfamous and notorious and I\u2019Il tell you stories about him - Schleizier and Wolf. There\nwere three shifts. So, a German was responsible for the guards. Then, we had - we had\nthe Lagerfuhrer, which was responsible for the camp. He lived outside of camp, but he\nwas there all day. That was in Strzelnica. I'll talk about Strzelnica because I was there the\nlongest. His name was Vaschek (ph). He was a sudetendeutche (ph), which means he\ncame from Czechoslovakia. He spoke Czechoslovakian, Czech, so we could understand.\nHe could understand Polish, and he had the green uniform, and he was - he had a very\nfoul language. He talked so badly, but he had - he was the only one that had a heart, the\nonly one, because he never - he would always screamed at the people, screamed at and\nswore at them, even at me, like he called me all kinds of name, but I didn\u2019t pay attention\nbecause I knew that he had a heart. He never touched a Jew, although he had this rubber\nstick. He would pick it up and he would scream, \u201cGet the hell out of here.\u2019 And he was\nscreaming, but he never - to such a degree that once he told the Ukrainians, \u201cNo one\ntouches my Jews. Only I have the right to touch my Jews.\u201d So, he wasn\u2019t so bad, and as a\nmatter of fact, he was there for a long time. I don\u2019t know why he was later let go. He\nwent to Ostrowiec, which was a camp not far from us, and they tell me that he was\nhorrible there. So, I don\u2019t know. He was the only German that I could say a good word\nabout because the others were all murderers and, I mean, I\u2019 Il tell you stories unbelievable\nstories. Then we had - then we had in camp, above Vaschek (ph), Vaschek (ph) was in\ncamp all the time. Then there was a guy by the name of Meyer (ph) who was overseeing\nall the camps, but he would only come for an hour. He would talk with Vaschek (ph).\nYou know, they would walk and talk. He wasn\u2019t yet - I mean, he wasn\u2019t good, but he\nwasn\u2019t yet as bad as the top man was called Altov (ph). He was the most horrible killer\nthat one, I mean, he was - he was killing Jews and when he arrived into the camp, he\nwanted everybody to freeze in the place where - if you walked you had to stand up. He\njumped over fences. He killed from all kinds of situations, like he would sit down, he\nwould jump, he would kill people that appeared on his way, and we will just make a note\nthen at the office that 1s deceased. He was the worst of them, and apparently I heard that\nhe was from a family because there was as I said called Altov (ph), apparently in\nGermany a very famous circus. So, he must have been an acrobat, because the way he\nbehaved, I mean, only an acrobat could kill people from all positions like him. Everybody\nwas so scared of him that I didn\u2019t even look in his - I don\u2019t even - I don\u2019t remember his\nface because when he came to the office and asked for Vaschek (ph), I would pretend that\n- | was afraid to look up. So, that was the worst. Then, in the factories we had - we had\npeople. Okay.",
        "A: I think that he was not accepted by the Germans because I think - he didn\u2019t have a\nuniform, he didn\u2019t have an SS, most likely because we found out later, whether it\u2019s true\nor not, we met his mother in Auschwitz and she was a gypsy. Whether this was the same\nMrs. Altov (ph), but if must have been because I talked personally with her. When I\nheard that she was an Altov (ph), I went and I talked to her. And the way she described\nhim, it must have been her son, and she says she was a gypsy and they were in the circus\nbusiness. So, I can\u2019t tell you, but he wasn\u2019t an SS man. Everybody was afraid of him. The\nJudenrat was afraid of him. They were hardly talking to him, and I\u2019m telling you, I mean\nI would freeze. I put my eyes down, I so was afraid, and I kept my shoulders up because I\nwas afraid that he would shoot me in a minute.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t care. He was the worst and he was - his title was Stumftihrer (ph). Then we\nhad - and Meyer (ph) died, I think, yes, he died. So, he was replaced by a guy called\nColditz (ph). He was very fat man. He was also screaming. He was almost as bad as\nAltov (ph).",
        "A: No, no, he was almost as bad as Altov (ph) by his behavior like when he was coming\nthey\u2019d he also demanded to freeze, people to freeze, and then they were the people, the\nSicherheit Polizei, which was the, like - I don\u2019t know how to say encavudei (ph) in\nRussian, how do Sicherheit Polizei (ph), they were...",
        "A: Intelligence police. Okay?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, Sicherheit (ph). And, I'll tell you stories about him, what he did to people,\nbecause I'll give specific stories about him, horrible man, horrible. Then there was\nKashmider (ph), and who was in charge of, like - the Germans were - the Germans\nsoldiers, the German officials who were wearing uniforms were in charge of the place\nwhere the Jews worked. So, they would come and look around and change workers and\nstuff like that. Those were the people that accepted all sorts of bribes, you know, to take\nsomebody to work or to change his job, you know, what it was. So, they used to come to\nthe, for conferences, to the Judenrat, but it wasn\u2019t a conference. They had to be prepared\nwith bribes. There was another one. I think I gave you all the names already.",
        "A: No, that was the labor camp, and those people were - maybe the Judenrat was the same\npeople who were in the ghetto. The same as they took me and my father because we were\nin Arbeitsamt, maybe that\u2019s why we got into the office. Otherwise, I mean, I don\u2019t know\nhow we could get into the office if they didn\u2019t see us writing there and keeping records.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I slept in the same barrack, and I wasn\u2019t in any privileged position at - they never spoke\nto me, nobody except for my boss, that Vaschek (ph). He was the only one that talked to\nme; otherwise, nobody else talked to me ever.",
        "A: No, because he had such a foul mouth, I was afraid to, I mean, I wasn\u2019t afraid of him, but\nI just couldn\u2019t take the way he - I mean, he didn\u2019t mistreat me, but he called me all sorts\nof names, but 1t wasn\u2019t only to me. He did that to everybody. But that was only words.\nThat\u2019s why I say he had heart, because sometimes there were a few cases when I was\nsaved because of him, because he sent me to the factory to work, to type letters, and type\nlists where they had - when they had some kind of action. I only think like that because\non two occasions, I was sent to the factory during selection, and the first time I thought I\nwas lucky, but the second time, I thought maybe Vaschek (ph) did that. Although he\ntalked to me so badly, but I didn\u2019t care. It was a good job.",
        "A: No, only sometimes, and the selections were only when people were sick. So, Ill tell you\nthose stories separately because it was very important how they were treating it.",
        "A: No, my father and Krysia were in - on Majowka, and Renia and I were there for awhile,\nand then later - I don\u2019t - this I don\u2019t remember exactly how it happened, because they\nbrought all the people from Majowka to Strzelnica and then from Strzelnica to Majowka.\nYou know, it was, I don\u2019t remember exactly what time and when, but Strzelnica was the\nbigger camp, the bigger camp, but then later we were all moved to Majowka. At first,\nbecause for a time I was with my father and Krysia, and for a time I was away from them.\nI don\u2019t really remember when it was, what year it was, because I\u2019m sure that Krysia must\nhave been - they must have taken them from Strzelnica to Majowka maybe first and then\nto - they made one camp at a certain time, maybe for repairs or for other things, I couldn\u2019t\ntell you.",
        "A: Five hundred people, but maybe they - maybe they enlarged it meanwhile, because, you\nknow, later on they were taking us, towards the end - towards the end, we were taken to\nanother camp altogether. They were building a special camp for us, just to get rid of us,\nbecause it was near a train line.",
        "A: Yes. When you walked in, there was a gate and there was a tower. The Ukrainian was on\nthe tower with a gun. The Ukrainian that was at the gate also had a gun - did he have a\ngun or one of those sticks? And, the office in Strzelnica was almost close to the gate, like,\nyou walked and that was - such a barrack was an office, and then, I remember, there was\na kitchen there further away, where they were cooking the soup, and you would have to\nline up for the soup right away. And there was a laundry where Renia later worked. She\nworked in a laundry, and then there were the barracks. The barracks were separate from\nthe men and separate for the women, and I don\u2019t remember how many of the barracks\nwere there, but we slept two on one cot, and...",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Wood.",
        "A: I suppose they had - there was no camps before, so they must have made them specially\nwhen we were in ghettos, because there were no camps there before.",
        "A: There were latrines and there were showers, but you k now what? I don\u2019t remember. I\nreally, like, I was thinking the other night, \u201cWhere did we eat?\u201d Because I remember that\nwe lined up for food. We lined up for food - for soup. That was the main meal. The\npeople that worked in the factories got their meal, but the people that were on shifts, and\nthe people that worked in camp ate - we had to line up for the soup and line-up for the\nbread. But, if you ask me where did we eat? Did we eat - it wasn\u2019t a dining room - but in\na big room or whether we eat in our barracks? You know, I couldn\u2019t remember. I was\ntrying to think, \u201cHow did we eat?\u201d I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I don\u2019t - I don\u2019t remember, like, I don\u2019t think that we would sit outside and eat. So, we\nmust have eaten somewhere, but where? Maybe there was a room behind the kitchen, but\nI couldn\u2019t tell you. I forgot.",
        "A: No, we had such metal dishes that they were - because they served the soup and you left\nyour dish there later. But it wasn\u2019t - in concentration camp we had metal kind of\nmanashki (ph), we called it, and with the handles so we could put it on a string and carry\nit all the time.",
        "A: Then we'll have lunch?\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: Okay, there was - there was a kitchen and some of the people worked 1n the kitchen, and\none of them was Salka Perinsweic (ph). She was in charge of the kitchen, if that\u2019s\nimportant. Every noon - or the main meal - I don\u2019t know if it was at twelve or at two\no\u2019clock, or whatever - the main meal we would get soup and we had to all line up for the\nsoup. The workers that went to the factories were getting their main mail in the factories.\nSo, there weren\u2019t that many people, only the workers inside, the people that weren\u2019t well,\nand the people that didn\u2019t go to work that day or whatever. So, but she would - there were\nsome metal plates painted white. We would line up, get the food, and I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t\nremember where we ate, whether we took it to the barrack, whether we ate outside. I\ndon\u2019t remember any rooms that would be available for us to sit down at the table. I don\u2019t\nremember. Maybe there were. I couldn\u2019t really tell you. Then we would get bread in the\nmorning, I think. Each time, we had to line-up, but food, like, the morning breakfast\nwasn\u2019t so important because many times the workers that went to the factories were\nbuying somehow or exchanging things with the Polacks and were bringing home some\nbread and some other stuff.",
        "A: The soup, potato soup, I remember. I don\u2019t really remember exactly, but whatever they\nhad, they put 1n this pot, and that was the soup for the - that was our dinner for the day.",
        "A: A few people.",
        "A: A few people. I would say that at least half of them, because don\u2019t forget that we had\nshift work, that some people were going to work at night, in the evening, I don\u2019t know\nwhether we had three shifts, I think. So, they were getting food at the factory or on the\npremises, but this Salka Perinsweic (ph) was, she was one of the inmates as I call it. She\nwas in charge of the kitchen. That was her job.",
        "A: Yeah, a big job.",
        "A: Not in labor camp. You know that I really don\u2019t remember being so very hungry. That\nmeans that we must have had - we didn\u2019t have any fancy food. We didn\u2019t have - we had\nbread and soup, but maybe we were allowed to eat as much as we could. I couldn\u2019t, I\ndon\u2019t remember. I remember being very, very hungry in the concentration camp, but\nmaybe because in concentration camp it was - it was, I mean, we were almost dying from\nhunger that - that the camp in Starachowice was already like a restaurant.",
        "A: That\u2019s true. I just don\u2019t remember those things.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I would go very early because the first shift, if the shift was going, I had to give them the\nwork list. I had to prepare it for them. So, if they went to work at seven o\u2019clock, I had to\nbe there, and I worked until the last shift would go to work and Vaschek (ph) - before\nVaschek (ph) would go home and put all the records under the lock and key.",
        "A: No, I was told either by the policemen or like, I was, if there was any changes. If the list\nwas the same, I didn\u2019t have to change it. I just - because I got reports that would say,\n\u201cThis was transferred to here.\u201d So, I knew that the next day, I\u2019d have to put this name on\nanother list. And I had to adjust the cards, as well. I had to write on it, let\u2019s say if she\nworked, if he worked in Department A, as an example, I\u2019m just saying. So, if he was\nchanged to C, I had to put it on his card too.",
        "A: Yes, in the inside office. They didn\u2019t carry any cards.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: They were small cards because all we had was the name, as I told you, the birth date, the\nbarrack number where they lived or slept, and the department where they work, and a\nplace whether he\u2019s still alive or dead.",
        "A: First, we didn\u2019t have like a typewriter in camp at first. So, if he wanted typed lists or\nsomething, he would send me to the factory, Vaschek (ph) would. But, if - but I had a\nvery good handwriting, very legible, I remember, and that\u2019s why he took me to his place,\nbecause he could read so easily my writing, and I was doing it all by hand. Later on, I\nremember, I don\u2019t know when, he brought a typewriter, an old typewriter, to the office.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know how to type, but I pretended. I said, \u201cWith two fingers, I type so fast.\u201d I\nlearned so fast. I never learned how to type. So, when he asked me if I could type, I had\nto say yes. I mean, otherwise he\u2019Il take somebody else to the office. That was a good job.\nSo, I typed with my fingers and I learned to type so fast that I was faster than the others -\nto such a degree that, in my office later, when I worked for ourselves, I took typing\nclasses and I could never learn because I was much faster with two fingers, the way I\nlearned in camp.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t print, I wrote, but my letters were like printing. They were like\ncalligraphically. Like, I had a very good handwriting. You wouldn\u2019t believe when you\nsee how I sign my name now, with my eyes.",
        "A: Three people. There was one girl that cleaned the office. She\u2019s still alive. She lives in\nToronto. And there was one seamstress. She actually - he hired her as a helper to the -\nwhen I say he, I mean Vaschek (ph) because he was in charge of this office - he hired her\nto help the other girl to bring wood and stuff. We had a fireplace. There was no heating\nthere. So, there was such a fireplace and the girls had to bring wood, chop wood, they had\nto do all this. So, he hired her, but since she was a seamstress, Mrs. Vaschek (ph) used to\ncome very often to the office just to visit because this third girl was sewing dresses for\nher. So, she would bring materials and she would sit there, she would try on, and she\nwould - so, actually officially she was a helper to the cleaner, but in reality, she was a\nseamstress that sewed dresses. I don\u2019t remember because there was - I don\u2019t remember a\nsewing machine there. So, unless he provided a sewing machine, I don\u2019t remember, but\nshe made many dresses for her.",
        "A: She was a very quiet woman, German, tall like him or maybe a little bit shorter because\nhe was extremely tall, and she was slim and she was a very pretty woman, and she was\nvery nice to us. I mean, she didn\u2019t talk with the other people, but if she would come to the\noffice, she would say hello to me. She would say hello to the seamstress. She would say\nhello to the other girl that cleaned the place. She was very nice. She used to come quite\noften because she - I don\u2019t know where she got all those materials. So, that girl sewed for\nher.",
        "A: Yes, as long as people were going out and coming in, until the last shift went to work, I\nhad to be at the office, to give them the list and then I went home.",
        "A: And sometimes Vaschek (ph) wouldn\u2019t be there so long. I mean, he would be working\nmaybe eight hours or seven or six, but I had to be in the office. But when he left, he\nlocked all his - I had no access to the papers anymore, but the list were prepared in\nadvance, so the lists that I was giving out before they went to work.",
        "A: I kept all kinds of records, like, when I say all kinds of records- they brought in, let\u2019s say\nif there was a delivery of clothes and we were giving the clothes out. So, I would say - I\nwouldn\u2019t, let\u2019s say, tell them what\u2019s going - we got a shipment of clothes and it came on\nsuch and such a date, and we gave them out on such and such a date. And, if the other\nsupplies would come or whatever, like, somebody had to keep records of those things.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right, in one camp, but later on when they put us together, my father worked with me.\nKrysia told me that in Majowka she was helping father in the office, but I couldn\u2019t tell\nyou because when my father was transferred to Majowka and I was transferred to\nStrzelnica, for a long time, I didn\u2019t have any contact with them, until we came together.\nBut I remember when I had typhoid, I think Krysia was there with me. I think so, but I\ndon\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Typhus, but isn\u2019t it called typhoid in English?",
        "A: I see, because we had what they called - it wasn\u2019t connected with the stomach. It was...",
        "A: Spotted. It\u2019s called typhus, right? Okay.",
        "A: We called it tiphus.",
        "A: So, I think I told someone typhus and he said, \u201cNo, typhoid.\u201d So, I say typhoid.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t such a big wheel. The Judenrat was deciding, you know, they were - I was just -\nI was just writing and typing and stuff like that. But I\u2019ll tell you that people liked me a\nlot, because I remember once when I was distributing clothes and, you know, I was so\nstraightforward, I was transparent. So, I started giving clothes and people were grabbing\nand they started taking like instead of one shirt or whatever T-shirt, they would grab from\nmy hands and run. So, you know, I started crying. I said, \u201cWhat do you want from my\nlife? I have so many I have to give and get to everybody.\u201d I started crying. So, some\npeople who stood in line were chasing those other people to take it away, to help me\nbecause they were sorry for me because, you know, I would like to give them three or\nfour of them, but, I mean, I only had a limited amount. So, I must say that people always\nhelped me.",
        "A: Yeah, I was crying because you know why?",
        "A: I was crying because I felt that, because of those few pigs that want to grab all this, the\npeople at the end won\u2019t get nothing, will get nothing. So, I felt sorry for them. I started\ncrying and I remember they ran them and chase the down the guys.",
        "A: Yeah, people were grabby, people were, you know, but, you know, this was life like - it\nwas hard. It wasn\u2019t as hard, in comparison to concentration camps, it was a picnic, but it\nwas still hard because we were still treated like animals.",
        "A: You know, we were fair and because of that we really - we really always had protectors.\nPll tell you later stories about Auschwitz, how we remained alive because we kept\nourselves together and how people were helping us, people that were in charge of\nsomething. They would pick us because they felt sorry for us - more sorry for us because\nwe didn\u2019t fight, like we didn\u2019t - we didn\u2019t fight for food or grab it or anything like that.\nWe wanted to be fair. We were brought up that way.",
        "A: All of them, because they were from Wierzbnik. One was the father of our very good\nfriend, Krysia knows - Krysia and my friend, Mr. Minzberg (ph). He was a very well-\nknown man in Wierzbnik. They were once very rich, but at the time when we met them,\nthey had some kind of possessions, lots of land, landowners, bankers, who knows? Like,\nhis predecessor. At that time when we knew them, they were just like any others. There\nwere no rich people in Wierzbnik, but they were very well-known and very respected. He\nwas very well known and very respected person, and although he belonged to the Zionist\norganization, he was also very religious. But he was - we didn\u2019t have a synagogue. We\nused the school the Tarbut school we used for prayers, and he was - he was the one that\nprayed like he was religious. Another one was Minzburg (ph). Einisemann (ph) was just a\nshoemaker, but he was a very simple man, but he was a good man. So, they have chosen\nhim because he was also - he tried to be fair. Then there was Mr. Wolfowicz (ph). They\nhad the store, like in Wierzbnik; they had the store materials, sewing materials. He wasn\u2019t\nthat pleasant, but he was good at giving orders and stuff like that. He wasn\u2019t as pleasant,\nas matter of fact, he was a little mean, but he was good if people refused to do things, you\nknow, that they sent. Then, there was...Minzberg (ph), Wolfowicz (ph)... Wirenswiec\n(ph), Wirenswiec was - they had a - they had a liquor store, I mean, not a liquor store, a\nliquor restaurant or whatever you call it, a bar. And, you know, in Starachowice because\nthe Polacks, the minute - the minute they finished work, they got their pay they were\ngoing to drink vodka. So, he was quite well off, and he was okay. So, those were the four.",
        "A: A small group.",
        "A: They - we had to have them, because otherwise the German would run it. So, they were\nrunning the - they were under Vaschek (ph). What I mean under Vaschek (ph), Vaschek\n(ph) supervised their work, that let\u2019s say if we needed supplies or something, they had to\ntell Vaschek (ph) and he would do those things or whatever, but they were trying the best\nthey could for the people in the camp. So, as I said, supplies and what else would they\ndo? Order and complaints, you know, I mean, when they didn\u2019t want to sleep with one\nanother, because there were two people to a cot. So, you know, they would solve all the\nproblems, inside problems.",
        "A: There was, but they had nothing to say. They weren\u2019t - I mean their orders were what?\nPeople didn\u2019t listen to them. But they didn\u2019t go and squeal to Vaschek (ph), they had to\nsettle it, but they didn\u2019t have very much - they didn\u2019t have very much power. The same as\nAdash\u2019s, my husband\u2019s father. He was in charge of the police. He didn\u2019t have that much\npower. I mean, I saw how they - how the Germans were almost murdering him, giving\nhim orders. So, he screened and he did what he could, but, I mean, his power was limited.",
        "A: No, no, no, no - we would keep it quiet. Nobody would - nobody would squeal to the\nGermans, unless the Germans would find it out somewhere else. Like, we were always\nprotect - when I say we, there was Judenrat and the police - they were always protecting\nthe people. On the outside they had to - on the outside they had to pretend that they are -\nthat they are solving all the problems.",
        "A: No, it was - how could they protect themselves? They were in the same shoes. I mean, the\npolicemen were - when we planned the uprising, all those strong people and the people\nwould only keep a secret, because you couldn\u2019t tell everybody - but the policemen were\nessential because they were all strong young men. So, when we were planning the - this -\nnot the...",
        "A: ...the breakup...out, the policemen were influential. They were organizing it. They were\norganizing the break.",
        "A: I knew Adrian all my life, because he comes from the same town, but I had - when I went\nto Radom, I didn\u2019t see him - I saw him in camp, but at that time, I had another boyfriend.\nSo, actually I didn\u2019t identify with him. Firstly, because they were the orthodox people.",
        "A: Adrian was, like his father, he wasn\u2019t, but his father was orthodox people. Secondly,\nsince they were religious, they didn\u2019t mix with the Zionists because they didn\u2019t believe in\nZionism. So, the groups were divided, you know. So, my mother - I always laugh when I\nsay this, what would she call me? Genius. I had to have a doctor for a husband, otherwise\nshe wouldn\u2019t accept him. So...",
        "A: Yeah, she was so happy because he was, you know, that was a real find. She could tell all\nher friends her daughter is going with a medical student. But then, I met him after the\nwar, because I remember he helped us a lot, because we came to Lodz. We couldn\u2019t go\nanywhere. All the Jews went to Lodz after the war. They had a Judenrat there. So, we\nheard that his family lives there because he was in the partisan groups, and for him, the\nwar ended in January. For us, we didn\u2019t come until June. So, he already had his own\napartment, and so when we came, he said he would do anything for us. He found us. First\nof all, he asked us what we wanted to do. So, I wanted to go back to school. So, he found\n- he regist-... because he was the big shot. He was at that time a Polish officer. So, he\narranged for me this school, like, found this school that was for gifted people that was in\na half a year you could do a year. So, he found this school and he registered me there. He\nfound me a job, and he found us an apartment, and that\u2019s how we started going, and he\nwas sending me flowers every day to the office, to the house. That\u2019s how it started.",
        "A: I talked to him because we had a lot to do together, not only with him, with all the\npolicemen, because they were coming to the office every minute for whatever list they\nneeded or whatever order they needed, they had to come to the office.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Pll tell you what I heard also. My boyfriend got killed in such a manner. He was working\nas a chauffeur for the Germans. I mentioned that to you before. And the Germans were so\ngood to him because his boss was also a medical student. So, they had a lot in common\nand they really liked him, and they picked him up at the time from Wierzbnik - my\nboyfriend with his boss. They gave me all - they treated me as if I was - as if I wasn\u2019t\nJewish. And I remember, one of them, his boss went home, so he asked - my boyfriend\nasked him at the time to buy me a raincoat. He bought me the most beautiful raincoat - of\ncourse, my boyfriend paid for it. And then Busko was liquidated before Starachowice,\nand they send them all to Treblinka, the whole family. He was the only one who survived\nTreblinka and broke out of Treblinka. How? Because when he came, they were looking\nfor truck drivers. So, since he was a chauffeur for the Germans, he had very good\ncredentials. So, they picked, they took him. So, I heard the story from somebody else,\nbecause I never saw him again. I'll tell you later, but they said he was a truck driver.\nWhatever he was doing, he was going outside with the Germans. Apparently - he was\ndriving - apparently, at one time - he was a strong and tall man - apparently, he killed a\nGerman that he was driving and he ran away. And, when he ran away, he went back to\nBusko because they were quite wealthy people. They had all those hotels at the time. So,\nhe figured that when he goes to his friend, his boss that he will help him - he will help\nhim. Meanwhile - and I\u2019Il tell you how I found out about that, too - so, he went to Busko\nand he registered with his boss. He told him how he ran away. He most likely didn\u2019t tell\nhim that he killed a German, and - and the guy said to him that he should show him\nwhere the family wealth is. They had money, like gold and rings and jewelry, and hidden\nsomewhere on the property. So, he went with him and he showed it to him and he gave it\nto him, and the German killed him right on the spot. I found it out from a girl - like we\nhad...",
        "A: So, PII just tell you how I found it out. We had an address. He gave me an address. He\nhad the Paliszewskis\u2019 and he gave me an address from a girl that - to write her if I ever\nwant to get in touch with him, because it was before the - it was 1940 or \u00b041. So, of\ncourse, after the war, I wrote the girl and she wrote me and told me the whole story. His\nboss killed him for the money.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: No, never. We were always - we tried to be always together, because we knew if\nsomething happens to one of us - like, we tried to keep together to defend one another.\nSo, in camp, actually, we slept together in one barrack. We went most - in our free time\nwe spent together, protecting each other. Renia was always scared. She was always\nsickly, I mean, a little bit sick, and she was always cold. She had to have - she was\nwearing all kinds of covers not to shiver. So, Renia was really - we had to take care of\nher.",
        "A: Not really. I mean, not really conflicts. As I said - as my sister tells me now, I\u2019d give her\na punch here and there because her closet was better organized than mine or, you know,\nbut it wasn\u2019t important really. We always kept together.",
        "A: My father - I will tell you, my father was, when he lost his wife, he was very much to\nhimself. He was working in the office and - I don\u2019t remember going to him and\ncomplaining to him like I would to my mother or looking for protection of any sort\nbecause he was - he wasn\u2019t the way he was at home. He was a broken-down man. But, of\ncourse, we cared for him and we talked to him, but not the same way as to our mother.",
        "A: Actually, maybe not to such a degree because he didn\u2019t take an active part, you know, in\nour when we were growing up. Like, I couldn\u2019t go to tell him and tell him a story that I\nfound a boyfriend or something, that I had a good time. I\u2019 Il tell it to my mother. But if I\nhad a report card, I would run to show it to him so he could be proud of it.",
        "A: Most definitely.",
        "A: Definitely. Definitely.",
        "A: I thought to myself at one time at the camp. I don\u2019t know whether it was to make us mad\nor whatever, one Ukrainian came in to the office once and told me that he saw my mother\nin a camp somewhere, that she\u2019s alive. So, we wanted to believe that that\u2019s true. But on\nthe other hand, if my mother was alive, she would have - and she knew that such and\nsuch Ukrainian, I mean, how would he know that she was my mother, but if she knew,\nshe would have written on a newspaper or something - she would send some kind of a\nsign, but how could she? They took them all, and then later after the war we found out\nthat everyone from Wierzbnik went to Treblinka and they were - they were right away\nkilled there. So, it was impossible that my mother survived the war. Why did he come to\nthe office just and told me that? I couldn\u2019t tell you.",
        "A: At the time, I didn\u2019t know whether to believe him. I told my sisters about it and we\nwanted - when you want to believe, you believe. But, then we knew it\u2019s impossible.\nMaybe he made a mistake. How did he know that she was my mother? How did he know\nthat, I mean, he didn\u2019t know us. It was a strange Ukrainian. It wasn\u2019t one of the guards.\nHow did he come there to tell us? I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes. He was - he wasn\u2019t as energetic as he used to be, because he was very energetic and\nhe was very resourceful and he wasn\u2019t. He was kept to himself, going to the office. He\nwas working there, and that\u2019s all.",
        "A: Yes, very upsetting, yeah. But he still lived long enough to go to Auschwitz, where he\nperished.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Very sick.",
        "A: I was one of the first ones. I don\u2019t remember. Renia says that one of them recovered\nbefore I, but I - I don\u2019t remember whether Renia or Krysia told me that I was really very\nsick, that I had a very high temperature and I was talking nonsense. I was delirious. But\nonce, when you were sick, like when you had typhus - first of all, when you had this high\nfever, this very high fever, you burned like anything, and even if you were delirious and\nyou were contagious, you weren\u2019t as sick as during the crisis - when the crisis came,\nwhen your temperature went right down, you couldn\u2019t move, and this was - if you\nsurvived the crisis, you lived. Otherwise - and then you, after a while, you were yourself,\nbut a lot of people didn\u2019t survive the crisis, and that was the time that I want to tell you\nabout Sulamite (ph). Because that was when typhus was so rampant, everybody was sick.\nThe Germans decided they\u2019d have to kill off the people that are sick. So, what they did,\nthe decided, the army came in. It was as they - it wasn\u2019t - 1t wasn\u2019t because they needed\nsoldiers to put all the sick ones on the truck to take them out. So, what they did, they told\nthe policemen that everybody had to come out of the barracks, whether he was sick or\nhealthy, and the Germans were watching them and asked them to run. Whoever could run\n- the sick ones with the fever could run - but the ones that were just going through the\ncrisis, they couldn\u2019t. So, those were put on the truck, and they called me from the office\nto write down the names of the people that were going on the trucks. Also, at that time,\nevery policeman was - every policeman was responsible for a group, for a few barracks\nor one barrack, I forget how it was, but the policemen were responsible that everyone that\nwas in the barrack came out. So, at that time, I remember, my sister-in-law, like my\nhusband\u2019s sister\u2019s husband was also a policeman, he hid somebody there and covered\nbecause they person couldn\u2019t walk. So, later after what happened when they found the\nsick one there covered, you know, and very sick, they killed the policeman. Cogord (ph)\nwas killed right on the spot. Then, as I was writing the names - I had two very good\nfriends from Lodz, two very intelligent, beautiful, two tall girls - I forgot whether they\nwere twins, but they were always together. One\u2019s name was Sulamite (ph), and the other\nMira (ph). One went through quickly, like she ran through, and this Sulamite (ph)\ncouldn\u2019t run, she just - because the reason for it was she was in crisis, and she runned, he\nsent her to, for me to write her name down. So, I thought that they will take her to the\ntruck. So, I asked - I didn\u2019t know those people because they came especially for that\nfunction. They were Becker\u2019s people. You know, Becker was outside the Lagers.\nSicherheit Polizei or whatever you call it - Sicherheit Deist, I think they were called. So,\nthose people were assigned this function. So, I said to the guy that was standing near me,\n\u201cPlease leave her. She\u2019s my best friend.\u201d So, he says, \u201cOh, she is, eh?\u201d He took out the\ngun and killed her right in my presence. So, I remember that - I didn\u2019t remember - I don\u2019t\nremember what happened to me because I fainted, but the policemen later told me they\ngot me quickly off my job, put me in the police barracks, covered me there, and the\npoliceman was writing down the names after later. So, that was very traumatic to me\nbecause I saw it with my own eye. I mean, it wasn\u2019t her fault. She was sick, and all I did,\nI felt - I felt guilty because I told him she was my friend, but I thought that if I would tell\nhim that she was friend, that he would spare her life, but he just killed her.",
        "A: I felt that - I thought that maybe if I would have leaved her or something, but I said,\n\u2018\u201cShe\u2019s my best friend, please leave her. Let her go.\u201d So, he killed her.",
        "A: No, things happened before when Altov (ph) was killing. I remember, one day he made\none Jew dance, like, I don\u2019t know, he - he - and he killed him there, and then I watched\nfrom the office window when he killed him, they called the Ukrainian to take him away,\nso the Ukrainian caught him by the legs, and the camp was full of sand or something. So,\nhe was dragging - not dragging, running with him, wherever they told him to take him,\nand you know all this sand was - how should I say - covering the face of this Jewish man.\nSo, I saw a few people that were killed and by Atlov (ph), I mean, you know, nobody\nlooked, but when he came and he always killed a few people.",
        "A: Well, it was traumatic. It was traumatic, very traumatic, and it made us cry, but we\ncouldn\u2019t help it. I mean, we got so used to it that at night, when we were in the barrack,\nwe sang. Like, we would always, there were songs - special camp songs. They were\ndifferent from the songs that we sang in the past. Today\u2019s your turn and tomorrow\u2019s\ngoing to be our turn. So, we never knew whose turn it was going to be. So, we really\ndidn\u2019t care. We wanted to live - life, the will for life was very strong, but not to a point to,\nyou know, to such - because we knew that today\u2019s their turn, and tomorrow\u2019s going to be\nours.",
        "A: The Jewish police.",
        "A: They took me - the barrack was very close to where we were arriving, the police barrack.\nIt wasn\u2019t a barrack - it wasn\u2019t my barrack. It was the police - you know, they had their - if\nyou want to call it office there, and their beds there.",
        "A: That\u2019s what they told me, because I fainted, but they told me that they grabbed me and\nthey said, \u201cAh, she\u2019s no good,\u201d or whatever they said, they took me to the barrack and\none of the policemen took over.",
        "A: After the finished with it all, the truck went away. I know - to tell you the truth, I know\nhow they were killed because they were making all these graves outside the barrack. I\ndon\u2019t know how many people. I don\u2019t remember because right after that, 1t was very bad\nwhen I had to put down \u2018deceased\u2019 for those people.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, until today I can\u2019t forget it.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Sulamite (ph).",
        "A: From Lodz? They were Mira and Sulamite (ph). Mira is still alive, but I don\u2019t remember\nthe name. They were from Lodz, and they were also teacher. They, you know, every girl\nthat was in Wierzbnik, like going back here, every girl that knew how to read was a\nteacher.",
        "A: Very few people. Typhus, typhus was the biggest killer.",
        "A: Not starvation. No, not in Starachowice, no.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: So, we took the card out and I would write down \u201cdead\u201d\u2019\u2019, \u201cdeceased\u201d.",
        "A: No, but the police...",
        "A: They would - you know, they were inside. I mean, they would report to me, so that we\ncould take them off the list. And Vaschek (ph), I mean, you know, he was there every\nday.",
        "A: The worst.",
        "A: To write down \u2018deceased\u2019, but if I didn\u2019t know the people - I mean, I got so used to it\nbecause it happened quite often, I would say. So, if I didn\u2019t know the face of that person,\nit was just a name, it was different than when I had to write that Sulamite (ph) was dead.",
        "A: All the time.",
        "A: I\u2019m going to tell you something that I\u2019m embarrassed to admit, but it\u2019s true. I believed,\nalthough I was - I\u2019m really a non-believer. In camp, I believed that God 1s taking care of\nme, that nothing could happen to me. I\u2019m embarrassed to admit because I wasn\u2019t\nreligious and I didn\u2019t earn this special privilege. But somehow - I even told my sisters\nduring selections in Auschwitz, \u201cIf I\u2019m sent there go after me, because God is watching\nover me.\u201d Because you know like I went through so much and nothing - I cannot say that\nnothing happened to me because all those incidents that I\u2019m tell you about were very\ntraumatic, but somehow I believed - I somehow believed in God, that he\u2019s watching over\nme.",
        "A: Pll tell you, I just don\u2019t know, because things happened to me many times - like, things\nhappening, like people were helping me. So, I thought that God sent them.",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t believe in anything. But during the camp, I really and truly - and I said I\ndidn\u2019t earn this because I wasn\u2019t religious before, and I wasn\u2019t religious after, so I didn\u2019t\nearn God\u2019s special attention - but that\u2019s why I believe that he\u2019s taking care of me.",
        "A: Because I figured, how come that I wasn\u2019t in the marketplace when the things happened?\nHow come the German that took me hitchhiking didn\u2019t kill me on the spot? I mean, he\ndidn\u2019t even have to make any excuses. How come he didn\u2019t kill me then? And I had a lot\nof happenings that [Il tell you later. How come that nothing...? I mean, I was right there\nand somebody - somebody helped me. So, that\u2019s why I believe that God is watching over\nme.",
        "A: No, what happened - no, with Paliszewski I was there, but I will tell you that this goes\nalready after the liberation. Since you asked for Paliszewski, you know the Polacks killed\nthose Einisemann kids and Wolfowicz\u2019s kids, and we were in Stratachowice at the time.\nWe came to visit the Paliszewskis. And that day when they killed the whole families\nincluding the Einisemanns, the Wolfowiczs, together with the kids that survived the war,\nbeing small kids like seven or nine or eight, you know. They knocked at the door at\nPaliszewski and they said - Polish partisans or who knows, Polish anti-Semites - they\nknocked at the door and they said to Paliszewski, \u201cI know that Laksuvnas (ph) are here,\nand we want them.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t let them have it - Krysia remembers that she said, \u201cI\nwon\u2019t let you have them.\u201d But I remember that she said, \u201cWhat do you mean? I wouldn\u2019t\nkeep Jewish people here.\u201d I remember that way, that she said that, that when they went\naway, like, they came to kill us. I mean, specifically they asked for us. The next morning,\nthe husband of one of the Paliszewskis took us in a horse and wagon thing, covered us\nwith straw and took us to another - to Skarzysko, which was a little bit further away, so\nthat we can go to Lodz, that nobody will know that he\u2019s helping us. You asked for the\nPaliszewski story.",
        "A: No, my mother couldn\u2019t have come to Paliszewski. No, she couldn\u2019t have because she\nwent to - before maybe she went.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, before. Because she\u2019s was taken to Treblinka.",
        "A: Yeah, she said that. She said that to me. She said in Jewish, because she never spoke in\nJewish to us. She always Polish, but she in Jewish to me that if you survive, I would like\nto be the orben (ph), the sacrifice. That\u2019s what - she said it in Polish, but she used this\nHebrew word.",
        "A: To me. She says, \u201cI hope that three of - I want to be your orben (ph),\u201d or whatever, like,\nshe said it in Jewish.",
        "A: That means that I want to be victim, so that you can live. She said that to me, and she\ncould\u2019ve said it to Paliszewski because she could have - Paliszewskis\u2019 was our point of\nmeeting after the war. They were very good friend of ours. So, we always used to tell\nthem everything.",
        "A: Yeah, she said it to me. I remember it all the time, and I never believed - that was a\ncouple of days before, before the - I remember it.",
        "A: Because everything happened the same time. So, maybe I\u2019Il start with Tobah (ph)\nbecause maybe it will be shorter. I don\u2019t know that much about her, but about my\nhusband\u2019s escape and the way that he bought the gun and stuff like that, it might be a\nlittle longer. So, Tobah (ph) - one day Becker, who was the Sicherheit Deist, came in a\ncar with another German soldiers and they came and asked for Tobah (ph), and they took\nher out of the camp. We didn\u2019t know why. Then, she came back. We didn\u2019t know why.\nThen, a few days later, he came for Tobah (ph) again. Took her himself already. He took\nher out again. He was very polite. I remember because I was near the office, like they\nbrought her to the office, and you know, I could look through the window and see. He\nopened the door for her, like if she was - like a girl, and he took her out and he brought\nher back the same day. The third time, he took her out - I don\u2019t know if it was a few days\nor a week or two later - he took her out and he never brought her back. Now, that day, he\nwas ordered - her father was ordered to, to dig a grave, and of course, it was like, they\ncalled him to work. He didn\u2019t know it was going to be for him. So, he started digging but\nhe was an older man. It took him a little time. So, Schrodt came out of his office, and he\ntook the gun and killed him on the spot. The grave wasn\u2019t dug exactly - like, the grave\nwas half-finished and he called other workers to cover him. And she never came back.\nThen we found out, because they were from Opatow - it was about, I would say, about 40\nkilometers away from Wierzbnik. Apparently, they had money - money or some goods or\nsome jewelry. I don\u2019t know. She must have showed it to them, and after they got\nwhatever they wanted, you know, the money, they just killed her. I didn\u2019t know what\nhappened to her because they didn\u2019t bring her to camp, but I was talking to the professor\nabout her because he had - he had her - heard the story and his records. He told me that\nhe asked, whether he asked himself or whether one of those people that he - that he was\ntalking to told him that she was - the grave was found later in the woods very close to\nwhere she lived - where they lived, where they found the treasures. So, this was Tobjah\nWeisblum (ph) that\u2019s how she perished, and her father, for money. Not only because they\nwere Jews, but because they had money.",
        "A: Because I suppose they decided they didn\u2019t want to have any witnesses because nobody\nknew why Tobjah Weisblum (ph) was taken out, nobody knew, and she never told\nanybody.",
        "A: The father probably didn\u2019t knew.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t know what for they are taking her out. Because he was - when he was digging the\ngrave, it was an older man as I say, he never suspected that that was for him, but Schrodt\nkilled him even before he finished. Like, he just killed him in front, like during the\ndaytime, when everybody looked on.",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t near the grave then. No, but of course, I was the one that wrote down\n\u2018deceased\u2019.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "A: Actually, it would be - to them, it would be a sacrilege to talk to - not to talk to associate\nwith any Jewish girl, because the Jews were not people. They were animals. So, you are\ntalking about the people in the camp, the people that lived in camp or the Germans.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t have Ros Hashanda (ph).",
        "A: Well, they were - maybe they treated the women a little bit better, but I don\u2019t think. When\nI say \u201cbetter\u201d, we have nothing to do with them, but maybe they wouldn\u2019t push us or hit\nus or whatever, but I don\u2019t think the Ukrainians would dare, or whether they would dare\nor whether the Jewish girls would go with Ukrainians. I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: To a certain point. As a matter of fact, certain names maybe I should mention, it must\nhave been Mr. Billenswiec had a - because his wife was there, too - and everybody knew\nthat he had a lover there, a woman from Lodz, but that was - everybody knew about it,\nand - because see the camp, the camp had separate barracks for women and separate for\nmen. So, if they met together it must have been during the day sometime, so the barrack\nwas open for everybody to see. It wasn\u2019t that they had separate rooms or anything,\nbecause we had - it was like a cot underneath and another one above. It was good for two\npeople, but like people were saying, \u201cOh, this one or that one,\u201d but that was about the\ninmates. But you know people, I think that people behaved a little better in camps. What I\nmeant - I mean, there was nowhere to go, you had to do it - if you wanted to do it,\neverybody could watch. I don\u2019t know how many people got into a barrack. I was asked\nthe same question by the historian. So I said, at night, the women were separated because,\nyou know, there was no movement from one barrack to another, but during the day,\nmaybe.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not in Auschwitz, though.",
        "A: In Majowka and Strzelnica, yes.",
        "A: You know, you\u2019re asking me questions, and I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t\nremember. I really don\u2019t. We must have had some way to do it, but I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No one. I don\u2019t know of anybody. They would be afraid to get pregnant, I suppose. Even\nif they had a relationship with their husband, there were husbands and wives there, but\nthey were separated. And I, so I - to tell you the truth, I don\u2019t remember having any\nproblems with protecting - not protecting ourselves, but keeping ourselves clean. I don\u2019t\nremember.",
        "A: No, there were some children in the camp that were already the children, not too many.\nEinisemann (ph) had his kids. Wolfowicz (ph) had his kids. Vera Veislava (ph) had a son,\na young son, and he survived. She was from Lodz. There were several kids, but I would\nsay not more than ten.",
        "A: Yes. So, what happened - the conditions were worse and worse and, you know, when\nthings were happening, a group of people decided that we have to make an uprising and\nto liberate the camp. It was an idea that we didn\u2019t know how to achieve it, but we knew\none thing: that we have to get arms, some kinds of guns and stuff like that. And this was\nvery secretive. All the policemen knew about it, because they were young and strong\npeople, and some people, but you know, some people that belonged to the group or was\ntold about it, but not everybody knew about the preparations or the intentions because we\nwere afraid that we could be denounced and killed. So, anyway, we decided - everything\nwas secret - and we decided that Adrian was the best one to acquire - he volunteered\nbecause he was very good at schmoozing and talking people into it. So, we decided he\u2019s\ngoing to buy guns. We would collect whatever we can from the Ukrainians because when\nthey were going home, they had to give their guns away and they went to get the guns\nwhen they came back to work. They didn\u2019t keep the guns with them. So, when they - that\nthey were supposed to steal - the first gun was purchased, and my husband had it. He was\nthe one to purchase this gun.",
        "A: Where did he keep it? I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: From a Ukrainian, a guard, bought it. They paid for it through the nose with the collected,\nwhatever we could collect. And he talked to one Ukrainian, and this Ukrainian agreed\nthat he would be selling guns for such and such a price. I don\u2019t remember what it was,\nwhether it was in gold or whether it was in money or whether it was in other things.\nWhen I say other things, some people were, in Wierzbnik, like if we left a lot of things -\nvaluables - not only gold and silver, but other valuables like blankets and furniture and all\nthis. So, you know, we could tell the Ukrainian go to such and such, and we have the,\nlet\u2019s say, two watches or something. Take the two watches and bring me a gun. I don\u2019t\nremember exactly how he got the first gun because that\u2019s as far as he got, the first gun.\nOn the second try, they caught the Ukrainian, when he was stealing. Instead of taking one\ngun with him or whatever, they caught him stealing - they found two guns in his\npossession when he - whatever. So, of course, they investigated and they interrogated him\nand he said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know the name, but there 1s one of the policemen.\u201d So, they\nlined up the policemen, all twelve of them, and the Ukrainian came in and of course he\nsold it to Adrian, so he went there and he showed, \u201cThis is the policeman that bought\nfrom me the gun.\u201d Right away, Becker came in and he started interrogating my husband,\nand my husband said, Adrian, he says, \u201cI never bought from him a gun. I don\u2019t know\nhim. I didn\u2019t - I never saw him.\u201d But, of course, they didn\u2019t believe him. He was\ninterrogated and we had such a bunker, a small bunker that was made out of concrete.\nThey put him there for a while, and then Judenrat went to Becker, and Becker came in\nand he said that he is lying, that Adrian is lying, because the Ukrainian didn\u2019t have any\nproblems finding him, and he\u2019s going to be condemned to death. So, the Judenrat decided\nthat - Becker you can buy him. This is the guy who took out , SO, he says, \u201cOkay, if\nyou give me...\u201d No, the Jew said, the Judenrat said to him, \u201cHow do you know? Maybe\nhe\u2019s lying. Why not put him somewhere like lock him up until we find out, until the\ninvestigation 1s through. If this is true what happened, then he should be killed, but how\nyou can take an innocent man? I mean the Ukrainian, maybe he had another reason why\nhe showed that this is the guy that bought from him the gun.\u201d So, they agreed. They put\nhim in this bunker, and he had to dig his own grave, and Becker, not Becker, the other,\nthe Baumgarten read, he read, you know, he read to him the order, that because he bought\nthe gun from the Ukrainian and because he is key of an uprising, he\u2019s condemned to\ndeath. He said it in the name of Adolf Hitler, and whatever it 1s, and so he read this to\nhim, and this was the first time that a grave was dug up and they had no body, because\nthey kept him there and then when he got his money, they wanted a kilo of gold. A kilo\nof gold, but we didn\u2019t have gold, so everybody, if they hid some ring or whatever, even\nteeth they were putting in their head, and what happened, they went to Becker and this\nBaumgarten to say, \u201cNow, you can start the investigation.\u201d So, in order for him not to be\nable to escape, they took him out of the bunker, took two Ukrainians, they covered his\nhead - like, they put him on a bench, took off his clothes, put a sack, you know, like a\nsack hat you put potatoes in or sugar or whatever with holes in it? They put it over the\nhead. They took two rubber sticks or whatever and they had such whips - whatever you\ncall it - and they told him that he would get now a hundred whips and he has to count. So,\nyou know, one, two, three... Adrian said after the twentieth whip, his body was numb. He\nsays he couldn\u2019t even feel anything. He didn\u2019t care. So, anyway, after they did that, they\nput him back into the police barrack there, because they figured that after his body was\nblack and blue and red and bloody. But he was a very strong boy, and don\u2019t forget that in\n1943 he was nineteen. So, I mean, he was a young, strong boy. They put him in the\nbarrack and they said, \u201cThis is only so that he can\u2019t escape or can\u2019t do anything.\u201d So, they\ntook him from the bunker because he couldn\u2019t breathe there, and they put him in the\nbarrack, and the next day they called in appel. Everybody had to go to the - everybody\nhad to an appel so that they could tell them that what happens if - everybody will be shot\nwho will take part, that if things like this, if people want to escape, if anybody escapes\nthey will kill ten people for each one that escapes, and in addition, they are not going to -\nbecause somebody - they didn\u2019t say it anymore that Adrian bought the gun - somebody\nbought the gun for a certain purpose. They didn\u2019t know about the gun that already\nexisted. They were talking about the gun that they caught the Ukrainian with, you know?\nThere must be a reason why they wanted the gun, and while they were doing it, the guys\nthat were thinking of escaping, of the uprising, they decided that when they visited\nAdrian later, when he was so sick, that they had to escape at the first opportunity. So,\nwhen everybody was standing at the appel and they were saying that, the policemen were\nmoving because they were always helping to round up people. So, they went to Adrian\u2019s\nroom. They took him out. They had some shears, and they decided, because the\nUkrainians were also watching us inside - not outside, the only Ukrainian that was okay\nwas kept, was on the gate. But they decided to cut - there was ten of them, ten young\npeople. I don\u2019t know how many policemen, but I think about two or three policemen. The\nrest were young boys that were always in contact to do the uprising. So, while they were\ntalking and we were watched by the Ukrainians and the policemen moving around, they\ncut the barbed wire and my husband, like Adrian was at the time, you can imagine, after\nhe got those lashes the night before or the day before. They jumped over the fence and\nstarted running. They had to run quickly over the road because on the other side of the\nroad there were forests and the Germans usually, like, all they wanted 1s to get to the\nforest as fast as they could. But meanwhile Schrodt, the guy that was watching, he started\nshooting. So, immediately they took all the Ukrainians and Schrodt was in charge. He\nhad a motorcycle and he started running after them. But until they found they were a little\nbit further. So, anyway they managed to go to the forest and the Ukrainians and Schrodt\ncame back and Schrodt said to Vaschek (ph), like they said, \u201cI am telling you, the young\nWilczek (ph) \u00bb which in German means the younger Wilczek (ph) I killed\npersonally. So, we all thought that he\u2019s dead, like his mother and his sister assumed that\nhe\u2019s completely dead. Meanwhile, the ten of them managed to go to the forest, and what\nare they going to do? I mean, they run away the way they were. Nothing - they had\nnothing on them. They had no guns, no knives, I mean, I don\u2019t know why Adrian didn\u2019t\ntake his gun. I never asked him that question, but when they reached the forest, they were\nvery happy. And we had three kinds of partisans in the forest. One - I\u2019Il name them by the\nPolish name, and then I\u2019ll try to translate. One was Armia Rudowa (ph), which means the\nPeople\u2019s Army. This was run by the Russians. It was a Communist party under Russian\nsupervision, and they were taking everybody, like not everybody. They were accepting\npeople that when they needed them. The second group was called Armia Kryowa (ph),\nwhich means the home army. Those were Polacks, those were Polish people. They\nwouldn\u2019t accept Jews, but they would accept Polish people. They didn\u2019t kill the Jews.\nThey hated them, but they didn\u2019t kill them. But then there was an /nnoset (ph) which was\na partisan group that were like Nazi, National Polish Organization that they were killing\nthe Jews like if they met them - the real anti-Semites. So, anyway, they were sitting there.\nI remember four names - three names - four names. I remember four names of the\nescapees. I don\u2019t remember the rest. So, it was Adrian. It was a guy Salik Anulevicz (ph),\nhe was the real first cousin of Daniel Levicz (ph) from Warsaw ghetto. And, the third one\nwas Freumik Singer (ph), he was from Opatow - he was related to Tobjah Weisblum\n(ph), and the fourth one was James Levy (ph), he was also a policeman, and there were\nsix others, but I really don\u2019t remember their names now. So, as they were waiting in the\nforest, the Russian group came by. So, they told them that they are from camp escapees\nand so on. So the guys said, \u201cI can\u2019t take ten. We can\u2019t take ten. We don\u2019t have room for\nten. We don\u2019t have arms for ten.\u201d Because the supplies came directly from Russia by\nplane. So, they couldn\u2019t take so many. So, he says, \u201cWe can only take two of you.\u201d So, he\npicked up this Freumik (ph) from Opatow and they picked Adrian. And, he says, \u201cAnd\nyou stay here, maybe the next group will take you because we don\u2019t have room.\u201d There\nwas apparently 25 of them in this group, this Russian group. So, there were 27 of them.\nThen - so, I will now speak about them, and I'll come back later to those. I\u2019Il say what\nhappened to them later. So, anyway they started to - they needed miner. What I mean\nminers - the ones who will put mines under bridges so that the German arms couldn\u2019t put\nthem in trains like - what they had to do, they had to put mines under the bridges, but the\nmines were not like today\u2019s sophisticated. They had their mine. They had the string. They\nhad to first go by boat, don\u2019t forget the Germans were watching. They were over every\nbridge, there were German soldiers walking back and forth because that\u2019s what they were\nafraid of, that the bridges would be mined. So, they had to swim or go by such a boat that\ncouldn\u2019t hear anything under the bridge, put the mine there, go far enough with the string,\nwait until the train comes - goes by, and pull it. It was a very dangerous job, and very\nspecialized because when the Germans were up there, if they heard anybody in the river,\nthey were shooting them right away. So, that was a very - the two Jewish boys that were\naccepted, Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were doing those jobs, and now, they had\ndifferent encounters with the Germans looking for them, but the Germans were always\nafraid to go straight to the forest. They had people that were in the village, Polish villages\nthat were telling them about the movement of the Germans and where they were going,\nand whether they were coming, what happened here and there. So, they had contact with\nthe world. They had enough to eat there. I mean, not that they were given special - like\nAdrian says, they would bring them a glop of pork, you know, the fat, and they would\njust eat half a pound to a pound of it, no bread or anything because it depends on what\nthey had and brought in, and he says, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe what I could eat - this pure\nfat.\u201d And, they could really eat the pound of fat without anything. So, they weren\u2019t really\nhungry. They slept in the woods, and they were doing the mine work. That was their\nwork.",
        "A: I will tell you about the others.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t say. And, they knew that they were Jewish, and to such a point they said\nthat they are happy that Adrian had the name Wilczek (ph) which means \u201c\u2018little wolf\u201d\nbecause everybody in the partisan group had a nickname and the nickname was an\nanimal. Do you know what I mean? Like, he was called a cat, a dog, whatever. So, he had\n- his name \u201clittle wolf\u2019 was suitable, but they knew that they were Jewish.",
        "A: And, you know what? That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to say. At first, they let him rest because\nthey told them what happened. So, those were the Russians, mostly Russians there.\nAnyway, one day, he got so sick, he got delirious, so they said they had to move for\nwhatever reason, and they told him that they can\u2019t take him because he couldn\u2019t walk. So,\nhe asked them to kill him. He said, \u201cMaybe if you kill me because I...\u201d But they couldn\u2019t\nkill him. So, they gave him, like, they gave him a gun. They covered him up. They gave\nhim all the food they had, and they left him there. They kissed him and they said, \u201cWe\nare very sorry,\u201d because they left him there to die because he was so sick. So some\npeople were going by the woods and they found him and they took him - some Polacks,\nmost of them were collaborating with the partisans. They were the people that were\nsaying where the Germans are. So, they took him home and they, and it took him ten days\nand he was better. So, he decided to go back to his group. When he went to his - before\nhe went out, he contacted one of those people that they were in contact with, and he said,\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to tell you that somebody denounced the group, the Russian group. The\nGermans came in while they were asleep in there, and...and one of the - where they kept\nhorses or cows or whatever - one of those buildings, they put it afire and everybody got\nkilled. So, he felt so bad, but, I mean, he couldn\u2019t believe it. So, he went... he went back\nto the woods, after he felt better, and he decided he\u2019|I wait for another group. I'll tell you\nmore about the others that were left, the eight that were left, but I have to finish this story\nfirst. So...",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "A: He - he was a Jewish boy. He never had - he wasn\u2019t violent. He never saw a gun in his\nlife. I don\u2019t think if he was given a gun whether he knew what to do with it unless\nsomeone will tell him or show him. I don\u2019t know whether the gun was - the gun that he\nbought and he - from the Ukrainian guard - whether the gun was at all operational, and\nwhether - I couldn\u2019t tell you, maybe it was, maybe it was one of the best, but even if he\nhad it, he wouldn\u2019t know how to use it unless someone would show it to him. So...",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I was involved.",
        "A: I was involved. Some women were involved because we\u2019re talking about uprising. So,\nthe women were also involved. Like, we didn\u2019t think it would be so fast. We thought that\nit would take us time first of all to arms and to be prepared and to-to-to-to prepare a\nstrata-strategy. It wasn\u2019t - this was just the beginning. We had no idea what\u2019s - what\u2019s\ngoing to be after, and we had to be very, very careful and secretive because I think like\nthat, if the Germans would have found out, it would\u2019ve been death to all of us.",
        "A: That\u2019s the most - all the policemen were involved in it, because they - they were the\nstrongest and they were the ones that were supposed to know how to do that, and a few\nother people.",
        "A: One would tell - we didn\u2019t meet. They would - one of the policemen would come to me\nand tell me what they decided. One would tell the other one who\u2019d tell - we didn\u2019t meet.\nThere wasn\u2019t no meeting. I mean, how could you make a meeting?",
        "A: We knew that the policemen were the - the initiators of that. So, I knew it, and maybe - I\ndon\u2019t know if Chris knew it because she was too young to know about it. Maybe she did.\nI couldn\u2019t tell you, and there was a few people, so I would say if they would tell me to tell\nso and so, but not in certain - we didn\u2019t have meetings. We couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: I think that my - that Adrian was the best at it because - because he knew how to talk to\npeople - how to talk to those Ukrainians to get what he wanted. He was the type of a\nperson that - that he knew how to - to get things.",
        "A: Nobody, nobody, even the policemen, they didn\u2019t carry anything in their hands. I mean,\nI\u2019m talking the Jewish policemen. I mean, they were only assigned a certain job and they\nwere - there was a good job, you know, by comparison, you know, and they didn\u2019t have\nto go to the factory and - and work at the iron stove where it was so hot that they couldn\u2019t\nbreathe. So, they - they were glad that they had this job, but they were - they were all\nthinking of uprising and getting rid of because we were too long - too long we listened to\nthat - we went like sheep to do that.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s too dangerous, and I\u2019ll tell you, I couldn\u2019t take a part in the running away,\nanyway, because they told us that if someone runs away, first the family and then ten\nother people and there were cases where they killed ten people for one. If one escaped,\nthey would round up ten people and kill them - shot them.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t because I had my father and my two sisters. You couldn\u2019t take Renia with\nyou, but, you know, if I took part in it and knew what was going on, and in case - listen,\nwe didn\u2019t - we didn\u2019t expect that everybody - everybody would carry a gun. First we had\nto get the guns. I mean, the idea started - came to us, and we tried, but we weren\u2019t\nsuccessful because we just started.",
        "A: As many as possible. That\u2019s why ten of them - ten of them were from this group. The ten\npeople were from this group that ran away that night - that day.",
        "A: Run away, and then - and then come and do something with, you know, like to maybe to\nget other guns somewhere else. Go to see the partisans and come back and - and - and\nfree all of us, but it was a stupid idea, but nobody - like you - you didn\u2019t believe, but you\nhad to believe that something would be done that we are not going to be killed like, you\nknow, like just go voluntarily to just be killed because the way we saw it, we didn\u2019t know\nabout - about what happened in Treblinka. We didn\u2019t know that there was an Auschwitz,\nbut it was enough that any German can - could come and kill anybody and, I mean, how\ndid we know? Maybe one day all of them would just, keep shooting until they shoot us\nall. So, those ten that ran away, they were from this group, and they had the best\nopportunity because the guards weren\u2019t there - only one guard. The Germans and\neverybody, they round us all up to teach us a lesson.",
        "A: He came - he came to - he come - he\u2019s in the woods, but of course, already half his time -\nlike he was there for a long time with them, because I didn\u2019t tell you, that all he did was\nthe mines and stuff like that. I didn\u2019t tell you everything that happened because it wasn\u2019t\nimportant, but now - now it\u2019s already close to - already \u00b044.",
        "A: Yes, he\u2019s been with them for a long time, but that\u2019s when he got sick and they left him.\nLike, he was working every day that he had another assignment. Most of them, he was a\nspecialist in mining. He was - I mean, working so long every day at it, he was a specialist\nin it. Because they had to observe the - the bridge going up. Like, when he had this string,\nhe had to go far enough so that nothing would happen to him. He had to - he - he\nactivated the mine, the bridge went up in flames or whatever it was, whatever, and he had\nto run away back to the forest. So, each - each of such escapade was very, very\ndangerous, but in his group, nobody - nobody died from that.",
        "A: They taught him, and of course, he used his gun very efficiently later. I mean, after -\nbecause they carried guns all the time.",
        "A: He\u2019s been waiting for another group, then the worst group comes in, and that was already\n\"44. Don\u2019t forget that the war in Poland - in Poland, in the woods there or in this district\nalready finished around January of 1945. So, that was shortly before - before the end of\nthe war. Because we were - for us, May was the end of the war, but for him, where he\nwas in Poland, the Russians were very close. So, January was already the end of the war.\nSo, anyway, when he came back to the woods, the worst of the groups, Anazed (ph), got\nhim. So, the - the name of - the name of the captain or whatever, whatever he was, I\nknow one of the leaders of this group was - his name was Orlig (ph), which means - how\ndo you call it now? The bird that has such a big beak, such a very aristocratic bird.",
        "A: No, aristocratic. I forgot now. Anyway, it was a bird, like he said - Adrian told him the\ntruth because there was no use to tell him that - that he\u2019s Polish or whatever. So, the guy\nlooked at him and he figured like this - it\u2019s almost the end of the war, what they did now,\nthe Germans would go away because they were sometimes even they were more against\nRussians than the Germans. They were against Germans, too, but if they have to choose,\nthey would kill the Russians. So, he figured like in his mind was that if he keeps a Jew,\nhe\u2019 ll have a token no matter what happens. He had a son who befriended Adrian very\nmuch - was a friend. So, he told him, \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell the guys in the group that you are\nJewish.\u201d And, he went and he taught him to pray the Catholic prayer, and he made - he\nwas the one that started the prayer and then - but, Adrian was quite honest. So, he told his\nson, but the son never told on him. Adrian didn\u2019t realize that he wanted to - that he\nwanted to - the guy, the captain of the group wanted to save his life by holding a Jew, but\nhe didn\u2019t tell anybody else, but he figured when the Russians come, you prove to them\nthat he\u2019s a saint because he has a Jew there. So, anyway, soon after the war finished - and\nhe was working with them in the woods there - and soon the war finished, the Russians\nstarted appearing. And right away, this guy wanted to say that - that he saved a Jew, but\nAdrian didn\u2019t pay attention to it, but the Russian - the worst part was that the Russian,\nwhen he saw him, he said, \u201cTell me your story.\u201d So, Adrian tells him the story, and he\nsays he was in the People\u2019s Army. They were all Russians, mostly Russians and there\nwere two of them - he didn\u2019t say Jewish because he says that they escaped the camp, and\nthey were accepted there, and he says, \u201cThis is the last group.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything\nabout being Jewish or anything because he didn\u2019t know who the Russian 1s. So, the\nRussian says to him in Russian, he says, \u201cYou know, this is a very interesting story.\nThere was 27 of you - 27 of you -25 Russians and two Polacks,\u201d and he says, \u201cThat\u2019s\ninteresting that one Polack got out and all the Russians, you know, all the Russians\nperished.\u201d So, Adrian said, he says to his guy, \u201cKill him, like, shoot him - shoot him.\u201d So,\nhe says, \u201cWhat do you want? I\u2019m Jewish.\u201d So, the guy says in Jewish to him, \u201cWhy\ndidn\u2019t you tell me that before?\u201d So, anyway, he was saved, but now this guy from the\nAnazed that killed so many Jews on his ways, tried to - since Adrian was already there,\nlike the Russian and him were already such friends, and so, he tried to say that he was\nalso good to the Jews because he saved him, but he wasn\u2019t. So, Adrian says, \u201cI am the\nfirst Jew that he saved.\u201d Because he told him, when he accepted him, \u201cYou are the first\nJew that I met in my life that Ill save you - that I\u2019m going to save your life.\u201d So, he\nrepeated it. I mean, he just said it. I don\u2019t know what happened to them. I don\u2019t think that\nanything happened to them. Adrian was right away made, like, he was a lieutenant right\naway. They put all the stars on him, and then when he came home, he worked for the -\nlike, he was - he worked in the army as a lieutenant. Now, I\u2019ll go back to Salik Anulevicz\n(ph) and the others. When this - when they took the two of them - the two of them - the\ntwo guys Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were very much concerned what happened to the\nother guys, but they never found out. Only after the war, they found out what happened.\nSalik started his story. When they took them and went away, there was eight of them left.\nSo, Armia Kryowa, which was the home army, which wasn\u2019t killing the Jews, but they\nwere - they were doing everything possible to make their life miserable, went by and they\nsee eight people, and the people - they all told them what happened. They told them, \u201cWe\nrun away from this Jewish camp in...\u201d And not all of them spoke because the - Hassidic\nJews that spoke Yiddish at home, they had a very big accent. You could right away notice\nthat they were not - I mean, you couldn\u2019t tell them you are Polish. They all knew that\nthey were Jewish. So, they said, they, so, there was eight of them - they - they were anti-\nSemitic, but they said, \u201cWe are not going to kill you, but what we are going to do...\u201d\nThey told them to undress. They left them eight people naked, the way they are. They\ntook their clothes away. He says, \u201cNow, wait for the Russians to come, for the other army\n- for the People\u2019s Army. They\u2019Il take you.\u201d But, and they laughed and laughed that they\nleft them alive but completely naked and took away their clothes. So, they were there and\nthey started thinking, \u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201d I mean, they can\u2019t move. They\nhave nothing. They have no clothes. So, they sat and Salik Anulevicz (ph) was the only\none that spoke without an accent. So, they said, \u201cYou know what?\u201d There\u2019s a forest -\nthere was a farmhouse and the guy was looking after the forests, you know. So, he says,\n\u201cThere is this house. If you can go there and bring us clothes or food or something.\u201d So,\nhe says, \u201cWhy me? Why not you?\u201d He says, \u201cYou can speak Polish.\u201d So - so, he went.\nHe decided - I mean, he had no alternative. He went there, and on the way, a woman\ncame out of the house, and he told her the story. It was a young woman. It was the\ndaughter of the - this forestman. So, she took him home. She gave him something to wear\nand food and the father came in and the father says, \u201cI can\u2019t take eight people. I cannot.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, we can take food and clothes and whatever we can.\u201d But he says, \u201cThey will kill\nme, the Germans, if they know that I hide so many Jews.\u201d Anyway, apparently the girl\nfell in love with this Salik Anulevicz (ph) and she decided to save him, and she took him\nin and she was hiding him there, and he survived the war in her place. Now, I\u2019ll go back\nto the seven and I'll tell you what happened to Salik Anulevicz (ph). So, he and the\ndaughter - this daughter and her name was Hela (ph), because he always talked about her,\nSalik Analewicz, after the war. So, the girl\u2019s name was Hela (ph). He and Hela (ph) were\ngoing - went to give them food and give them clothes, but they under no circumstances\ncan they keep them there because there was eight of them. So, they were helping them\nwith - nobody knows what happened to them. Nobody - they didn\u2019t survive the war. How\ndid they perish in the woods because when one day they were there, they weren\u2019t there.\nLike, you know, they were taking daily food to them and water, but they weren\u2019t there.\nNobody knows whether they perished and they must have perished because nobody came\nback. Now, I'll go back to this Salik Anulevicz (ph). He lived there with this woman and\nshe promised - he promised that he would marry her. He promised he will marry her after\nthe war, but after the war he changed his mind, but he - he wanted to pay them back for\nwhat they did for him. So, he was a very rich guy - I forgot which city he lived, but he\nwas not far from the Czechoslovakian border there. They had some real estate and stuff\nlike that. He went to the lawyer and assigned all the real estate to her, and he says\nwhenever, as long as he lives, if he can help her in any way, he will help her. I don\u2019t\nknow whether he could do it, whether she cashed in on his promises, whether she could\nget - although he went to a lawyer and signed over all this properties to her, we don\u2019t\nknow because he never - no, he saw her once. Her father was - her father was accused of\nbeing, not a Nazi, but that he collaborated with the Germans, and they took him out, put\nhim to jail, and she new where Salik was in Poland at the time yet. So, she says, \u201cI want\nyou to be a witness to telling him that we - that we saved you.\u201d So, he went there and\nthey let the father go. Whether he was a German collaborator or not, I don\u2019t know.\nAnyway, Salik Anulevicz (ph) went to West Europe, and then he went to Brazil. He\nmarried a Swiss girl, and he was coming to Toronto every year because he had - he died\nfive years ago. He died before my husband because the two of them were friends like,\nyou know, and not only that, he had a brother Hirsa (ph). He was coming and he always\nwent, like he stayed with us with his wife and whenever we talked to them, he was\ntalking about this Hela. He wanted to go to Poland to see Hela, and the wife was willing\nto go with him, but she says, \u201cYou only know her first name, that Hela. She must have -\nsince then she must have been married. She must have moved out of this farmhouse. How\nare we going to find her?\u2019 He wanted to see Hela who saved his life. All his life, he was\ntalking about her. He died, as I said, about five years ago. We never heard of the eight -\nno, the seven other guys, and Freun (ph) was killed together with the - with like, by the\nGermans together with the whole group. So, this is Adrian\u2019s story.",
        "A: Yes, but he was - you know, she was a very simple girl. She was a very simple girl. At\nthe time, he felt that he wanted a Jewish wife. You know, some people are - he was one\nJewish, he was religious. He was a nice guy. He wanted a Jewish wife. So, he decided\nthat maybe if he gives her the real estate that they had - houses and apartment houses or\nsomething - I don\u2019t whether she ever got it because the Polish government took over all\nthe properties, Jewish properties, so nobody gets anything anyway. So, maybe she didn\u2019t\nget it. He wanted to - and his ways, he was okay, but in his ways, he was also simple like\nhe didn\u2019t know how to go about it. He didn\u2019t know to go to Poland and to go the\nfarmhouse and start looking for Hela.",
        "A: And you know, may I say something on the tape? He said it in Jewish he said to him - I\nwill say it in Polish because my Jewish is not too good - he says, \u201cYou are lucky that you\nwere naked because when she saw you, she fell in love with you.\u201d But those were the\ncircumstances, and this is a real true story.",
        "A: Yeah, unbelievable.",
        "A: That\u2019s what he said. He said it in Jewish, \u201cYou were lucky that they undressed you\nbecause otherwise nobody would\u2019ve accepted you.\u201d But he was a very good looking man,\nand he was - he lived in Sao Paolo in Brazil.",
        "A: He said he didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Because, 1n a way, he was quite simple. Because I mean he asks his wife she should go\nand look for Hela, and she says, \u201cYou know what? I will go with you, but that he tells me\nwhere it was, he doesn\u2019t remember where the farmhouse was.\u201d You know, like, he was\nthere, but he was hidden. So, how did he know? You know? He don\u2019t know, and he\nwasn\u2019t smart enough to remember, because some people are fast, but Hela, how can you\nfind Hela in Poland?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: See that was shortly before - that was in 1943, but it must have been towards the end of\n1943, close to 44. Well, they didn\u2019t do anything. They didn\u2019t kill anybody when they ran\naway. They didn\u2019t because - maybe because Schrodt said that he killed them. He killed a\nperson - he young Wilczek (ph), as he said. Maybe he thought that he killed them all. I\ndon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember suffering any consequences because of that.",
        "A: Very surprising, yeah, but nothing happened.",
        "A: Yeah, there was another - then later, it was another try of running after them. They were\nalready, how should I say, energized by their running away. And one night people went -\nthey started running - people started running to the barbed wires, cutting the barbed\nwires. And when I say a lot, I don\u2019t know how many, but I would say maybe a hundred\npeople got killed by the Germans, because they started shooting, the Ukrainians and the\nGermans, everybody, because they were much more ready to combat all those people\nafter the escape than before, because before it never happened, and - and those - I\u2019m sure\nthat Chris and Renia must have told you the story, how those people were moaning. They\nwere lying there. They didn\u2019t kill them, and they - they were crying and shouting and\nscreaming, all those people, because they tried to escape. We didn\u2019t try to escape because\nsomehow I didn\u2019t see - I mean, where would we go? There was nowhere for us to go. If\nwe could run away and be accepted by someone and live with someone or have some\nkind of a connection, but we didn\u2019t. And we were afraid that if one of us would run away,\nthe whole family would suffer, would be killed, and we didn\u2019t - we couldn\u2019t leave the\nfather there, and we couldn\u2019t leave Renta. I mean, where can you take Renia? I\u2019m telling\nyou, she was a sickly - always sick, always, every Tuesday and Thursday like this - it\u2019s a\nJewish expression - she had either a cold or she was sneezing. She was always sick. So,\nwe didn\u2019t but people did. That was after what happened to the ten, like after they run\naway, there was immediately the rest of them wanted to run away, too. Because they\nfigured if they could do it, but they run away under special circumstances, and those\npeople started at night. So, they were just shot like - there were so many dead people.",
        "A: Is that true?",
        "A: Yeah, when I say hundreds, but about a hundred people, I would say, about that.",
        "A: No, nothing. They were just running to the barbed wires and tried to escape the way the\nothers because, you know, they saw what happened that the wires were cut and they run\naway, so they just blindly - they had nowhere to go. And all the guards were on alert, the\nGermans would come. I mean, Becker with his troops would come right away. I don\u2019t\nknow. That wasn\u2019t heroic; that was stupid.",
        "A: So, we are almost close to the end of Starachowice.\nEnd of Tape #8\nTape #9",
        "A: No, we weren\u2019t in the third camp.",
        "A: No, nothing. Because they - there were so many bodies there that they had enough bodies\nalready, and it was close to - was close to us going to Auschwitz already, close.",
        "A: Yeah, I know, because, I know a lot of people - young girls that ran, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, because I didn\u2019t believe anybody would do it. We all thought about running away all\nthe time. That was - that was our aim, to run away from this horrible camp, but you know\nwhen the time came to run away, we were too - too - too scared to because we were\nafraid. We couldn\u2019t take our father out. We couldn\u2019t take Renia out. And we are afraid\nthat they would be killed. So, we didn\u2019t even try.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have roll call. They would call all the people - they had an announcement, and\nthey - and they, you know, the policemen then the Ukrainians said to come out and the\nJewish policemen would round us up - round us up and tell us that there\u2019s going to be a\nlecture, or whatever you call it, that we have to go and listen to it. That was the time\nwhen Adrian and his nine friends ran away.",
        "A: They were counting, but the policemen would, you know, don\u2019t forget when they started\ncounting, they knew how much we have to have, and the Germans were very gullible.\nLike, I told them, let\u2019s say that to talk, as an example, was 1,479, as an example. So, I\nwould tell the policeman that we have 1,479 people. So, they would come and report how\nmany people - people were taken from each barrack when he was rounding them up.\nThey were writing down - he\u2019s there. So, they - they made a count that should agree with\n1,479, and I remember Altov (ph) saying \u201cShtumpt!\u201d Because he didn\u2019t know that we\nfabricated those numbers because all the numbers he started counting together, not saying\nthe amount that I just told you was a fictitious amount.",
        "A: I knew the number because they would come - a policeman would come to me and say,\n\u201cHow much do we need?\u201d Like this, I\u2019d say, \u201c1,479.\u201d I\u2019m just inventing the number.\nOkay, so everyone knew. So, the first one, let\u2019s say came first and then the last one said,\n\u201cHow much do I need?\u201d You know, I mean, to give the number, and then they counted it\ntogether, and then Altov (ph) would come and start counting, \u201cBarrack 3 has so many.\nShtumpt (ph)! but meanwhile there were who knows how many missing? But, we had to\ndo it. I mean, we had to do it, and if they find out, I mean they didn\u2019t find us out, but if\nthey did. So, we would have had to suffer the consequences, but I mean, that was the only\nthing that we could do. and Irinst (ph), that\u2019s Adrian\u2019s sister\u2019s husband, got killed\nbecause they found one person in the barrack.",
        "A: Very dangerous - they killed him on the spot, because we counted and the count was\nright, but there was somebody was - wasn\u2019t supposed - didn\u2019t come out. So, they killed\nhim on the spot.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so because when they delivered to the kitchen - I wasn\u2019t in charge of it, so I\nreally don\u2019t know. I remember that Sal Kabiren\u2019s (ph) wife was in charge of it. So, she -\nshe - but, the Judenrat most likely was ordering or whatever. I know - I really don\u2019t know\nhow it worked, whether they ordered it, whether they sent at random so much of this and\nso much of this. I couldn\u2019t tell you.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, always - during the war?",
        "A: Yes, after the war or before?",
        "A: During the war. I don\u2019t know. I must have had nightmares, but I don\u2019t recall of any\nincidents of any importance.",
        "A: Nobody slept well, really, because you were always thinking what happens, I mean,\nthings like that happened and we never knew what\u2019s going to happen the next day\nbecause there was always something happening in camp. I only told you a few stories that\naffected me personally, but such stories were - were happening all the time that affect\nother people. Everyday something happened.",
        "A: Always, always.",
        "A: One day, I refused to come to work because, you know, Vaschek (ph) was insulting\neveryone. I\u2019m not saying that he was insulting me. Calling names - all the dirtiest of\nnames he would call, and I wasn\u2019t used to it. He wasn\u2019t bad to me. Like, I cannot say that\nhe did any harm to me, but I just didn\u2019t want to suffer all those insults. So, one day I\ndecided not to come. So, he sent a Jewish policeman with a pail of water to throw on me!\n[Laughs] So, I had to come to work, and that was his way of, but he still called me all\nkinds of dirty names. You know, he called me whatever he wanted to - not only me,\neverybody, all the girls, the other men, the policemen, everybody. That was his way, but\nlater on not only that I was glad that I worked for him not Altov (ph) or any of the other\nguys, because I would be dead by now.",
        "A: Right away, wet. I was scared. I said to myself, \u201cThe next thing would be that he would\nkill me.\u201d But, he was very - he knew that I was a very good worker, very consciencious.\nHe can find everything and always, and I kept his records to such a point that he knew\nright away, like, he was happy with my work. So, I knew that he\u2019s not going to kill me\nand take somebody else.",
        "A: I have no idea because when they threw us out, we went to another camp. Who knows?",
        "A: No, I really - I don\u2019t know whether he would find.",
        "A: No, only one copy. I was doing the lists every day. I mean, he didn\u2019t need to have those\nlists, but every day - and then he put - he put, let\u2019s say - I don\u2019t know how long it kept the\nrecords - but he kept, you know, he had - he had them under lock and key so, I don\u2019t\nknow whether he kept them for a month, for two months. I don\u2019t know. Because he didn\u2019t\nneed like from last month\u2019s work, he didn\u2019t need the lists. I mean, really, he didn\u2019t - why\nshould - what would he use it for except for records. But, I really don\u2019t know what he did\nwith it.",
        "A: I have no idea, no idea. We had no numbers. We had real names in this camp.",
        "A: No, nothing yet.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, the clothes that they were supplying. We didn\u2019t - don\u2019t - we didn\u2019t have not a\nbeautiful clothes. A shirt and some - a T-shirt or - the beds that we got was better than in\nAuschwitz where we got the uniforms and I couldn\u2019t find a uniform that would fit me. I\nhad to change with other girls that the uniform was still here, because then they just threw\nit at you. Here, at least, like when the things came, I had the first choice. I could\u2019 ve\npicked a better one. I, you know, than...",
        "A: I must have, but where did I take it?",
        "A: Because we didn\u2019t have an underwear - underwear or bra in Auschwitz, but we must have\nhad underwear and bra in camp, but we didn\u2019t buy it. [Laughs.] I don\u2019t remember, but I\nmust have. We must have had it.",
        "A: I think so. I might not as well had it - have had it. Really, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: We wore our own shoes that we came in with. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t take the knapsack. We didn\u2019t bring it and apparently, I don\u2019t know, I asked Renia\nand she doesn\u2019t remember, but some people told me that they saw my mother carrying\nthree knapsacks, and they think that this was the reason why they put her - her to the bad\nside. Although, because my mother had a card, as working in the Arbeitsamt, everybody\nhad a card, a working card. We really worked. My mother didn\u2019t work, or maybe she did,\nwho knows\u2019? But, she must have had a card, because, like, we were giving out the cards.\nBut I asked Renia. She says, \u201cOh, no.\u201d She says, \u201cMother didn\u2019t carry the three\nknapsacks.\u201d But somebody, I forgot who, some friend told me that they saw my mother\ncarrying all the knapsacks. That\u2019s why they pushed her to the bad side.",
        "A: Not tell me, tell the Nemcheck (ph).",
        "A: I heard it. He didn\u2019t tell me personally. I mean, I didn\u2019t know him that well. I saw him a\nfew times in the Arbeitsamt, but he told that on such and such a date - it\u2019s going to be -\nthey are going to close the Arbeitsamt and on such and such a date, we\u2019ll all go to camp.\nWe - we were expecting going to camp because things like that were happening all\naround us.",
        "A: Everybody wanted to have a work card, and everybody was preparing to go to camp,\nwhether they know - knew where the camp was, because as far as I\u2019m concerned, I had\nno idea where the camp was, whether it was Majowka, Strzelnica, or Tartak (ph). I had\nno idea where those camps were until I came there. I didn\u2019t have any idea what they\nlooked like. I have never worked in the factory, the munition factory. I didn\u2019t know what\nconditions there were there. So... But we had so many things happening all around us,\nthat - that we knew that they would liquidate the ghetto, but we didn\u2019t realize how they\nwould liquidate. We didn\u2019t think that they would be so beastialic like that, you know, that\nthey would be pushing, and - I wasn\u2019t there, so I didn\u2019t see it, but from what people tell\nme, it was horrible in this marketplace. So, we thought that they would all take us to work\nnow, and we\u2019ll go to camps. We didn\u2019t even imagine what the camps looked like inside.\nWe had no idea. We were never in a camp before.",
        "A: No. I saw the people going already to the trains. Because the factory where we were was\nacross the road, a little to the left of - not much, I would say like how to describe it,\nprobably five hundred yards to the side. Like, let\u2019s say on this - let\u2019s say where I - where\nI\u2019m sitting is the factory. So, it wasn\u2019t right across the road. It was about five, six hundred\nyards to the side, on your side. So, we saw people walking from the marketplace, and the\nmarketplace was also to the left of where we were. So, we didn\u2019t see the marketplace. We\nsaw only people already boarding the train.",
        "A: Yes, with Chris.",
        "A: We talked - yeah, because we said, we didn\u2019t expect it to be that day. We didn\u2019t have the\nknapsacks. We didn\u2019t have anything. We went just the way we went to work. We had\nnothing with us.",
        "A: Everybody that worked there saw it because we - we only had to go a little bit upstairs.\nWe didn\u2019t have that much supervision there because the ones that supervised us weren\u2019t -\nit wasn\u2019t a factory where like - 1t wasn\u2019t where there were people, inmates working there.\nThere were regular people working there. So, some of them were Jewish and some of\nthem were not Jewish. So, it wasn\u2019t such a supervision that the Ukrainians or policemen\nwas watching us, what we are doing every minute. We worked and we went to see, and\none of us would go and tell everybody else, and a few minutes later, somebody, and then\nthe two of would go and whatever and watch, and then we worked again. So, it wasn\u2019t\nthat forced labor. And if it was, we didn\u2019t have such - that was a night shift. During the\nnight, maybe they didn\u2019t have so much supervision, or maybe they felt sorry for us,\nwhatever, but I don\u2019t remember - the work was very messy, and dirty, and hard because,\nyou know, the bricks were heavy, and we had to carry them when they were finished, to\ncarry them elsewhere to dry them and then put - put them in place and so on. So, the\nwork was heavy, but it wasn\u2019t forced labor, like I said. Like, we didn\u2019t have any soldiers,\nGermans, Ukrainians, or we didn\u2019t. So, we could move around. I mean, not that we - we\nhad to work.",
        "A: Yeah, the Frenchman was - that was in the last camp.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: They built a new camp for us and that was for the purpose just to keep us there until the\ntrain comes to takes us to Auschwitz. We didn\u2019t know; we were moved there. I don\u2019t\nremember whether people were going to work from there, because it was a short time,\nmaybe two weeks, maybe three weeks. I really don\u2019t remember the times so exactly. But,\nonce we moved into this camp, there were no Ukrainian guards. There were no - the\nGermans didn\u2019t come, but - like we called them the canaries. They were...",
        "A: The canaries. I\u2019ll tell you why. That was a German army. It was an army - I knew the\nname, now I forgot - it was Polizei, just let me think. Those were the ones that were\nguarding the soldiers that they shouldn\u2019t run away. Not, Sicherheit Polizei. | knew the\nname. I forgot. Anyway, it will come back. They were wearing light - they were wearing\nlight green uniforms and yellow insignia all over. The insignia was yellow. We called\nthem canaries because, like, we didn\u2019t know who they were. They were all around the\ncamp. There was - Altov (ph) didn\u2019t come, any more of our - those people that looked -\nthat were in Lager before. They were staying outside the new camp. Every, I would say,\nit would be six feet or so. Let\u2019s say every six weeks a canary would stay. You know, one\nof those soliders, but what\u2019s their name? I just - I was thinking and I knew it for one\nminute only - Feld Polizei. Those were the - they were guarding the soldiers they\nshouldn\u2019t run away, but, you know, during the battle. I just said it and I forget it. I just\ntold you and I forgot again, yeah, Feld Polizei. And we knew that something horrible 1s\ngoing to happen because we didn\u2019t see any of the guys that were normally coming to\ncamp, whether they were - no Ukrainians, no Germans, only this Feld Polizei all around\nthe camp. They were the ones who put us later on wagons. Anyway, when we were there,\nwe still kept the office, but I don\u2019t remember any German being with me because\nVaschek (ph) didn\u2019t work there for a while. They sent him to Ostrowiec, or maybe they\nsent - like they just let him go. I don\u2019t know. He wasn\u2019t needed. So, there was nobody\nthere but the typewriter was still there and I was still there, Jewish policemen were there.\nI don\u2019t remember any Germans except of those canaries outside.",
        "A: This is the end. This is the camp that was the end camp. Anyway, one of the soldiers\ncame up and he asked me in German whether I could - I could type a date on the\nenvelope, he\u2019s sending a letter. But he had such a French accent and I don\u2019t know why I\nsaid this, so I said, \u201cMoi, je parle francais un peu. Donc, si vous voulez, vous pouvez\nparler francais.\u201d So, he looked at me as if I came from another world. He said, \u201cHow do\nyou know French?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know French. I learned a little bit at school. That\u2019s all\nI know.\u201d He says, \u201cHow do you know I\u2019m French?\u201d I said, \u201cBecause you have a French\naccent.\u201d Anyway, I - I put the address on his envelope. He took it and he says, \u201cThank\nyou very much,\u201d and he went, and I didn\u2019t see him anymore. Then, came a time for us to\ngo to like - the train came over, and they were putting people, a hundred people - a\nminimum of a hundred people in each cattle wagon, a minimum of a hundred, because I\nknow that in some places there were 125 people instead of I don\u2019t know how many\nhorses they put in a wagon. The train was a small train, and it had two little windows with\nbars, and they were closing the doors by sliding one door, so I don\u2019t know how many\nhorses, maybe four or five horses. But we were in the last, like, there were mostly men\u2019s -\nmen\u2019s trains first and then they were ladies\u2019 friends - or trains, ladies\u2019 trains. So, we\nhappened to go, Renia and Chris and I, happened to go 1n the last train. They pushed us\nin. So, and the train moved and we knew and we heard crying because people were\nfighting with each other. They could only stand. In our wagon - in our train, we could sit\ndown. We couldn\u2019t lie down, but we could sit down and, you know, when the people are\nlike that, and they were hungry and thirsty and they were fighting with each other so we\nheard moans and stuff like that, and the train was very, very slow. So, when the train\nmoved and this Feld Polizei, they were sitting on the roofs, you know, they had - they\nwere sitting on the roofs of the train. They all went with us, as if we were the most\ndangerous criminals. They would because they - they were with guns. Anyway, as we\nwere going, it was time for us to get some water because at a certain station, they stopped\nthe train to get pails of water and to just put the pails of water for the people to have\nwater, like Renia and Chris - not Renia and Krysia, but people - and I tell, the people\nsays, \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any water.\u201d But anyway, this one guy, this guy, this French guy\ncame in and says, \u201cThe girl that speaks French.\u201d I didn\u2019t even get up. I forgot that I speak\nFrench, because I only spoke with him once. So, he says, \u201cThe girl that speaks French.\u201d\nSo, I came to this little window and he says, \u201cTake a couple of other girls because we are\ngoing for water. To bring water for them.\u201d So, he had some pails. So, I called - I thought\nthat I took Krysia and Renia, but Krysia went with me, but Renia says she doesn\u2019t\nremember. So, I maybe I took - like, I asked another girl, but Krysia definitely was with\nme. So, we went for to bring the water. Everyone was getting either one pail or two, I\ndon\u2019t remember. Anyway, when we came to the well where the water was to be, you\nknow, like we pumped the water, he says in French to me, \u201cI am going to let you\nrunaway now. You just run when you want. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m going to shoot later. First, I\nwill pretend that I didn\u2019t notice.\u201d He said it in French. \u201cI pretend that I didn\u2019t notice. I\ndon\u2019t want you here, run!\u201d So, I looked at him, and I thought to myself, \u201cHe\u2019s crazy. He\u2019s\ngoing to - we will run and he will kill us.\u201d So, I said to Chris in Polish, \u201cHe wants us to\nrun, but I\u2019m not going to run. I don\u2019t trust him.\u201d And he said again, \u201cRun, and I\u2019m going\nto shoot. Don\u2019t worry, just run.\u201d Where are we going to run? We are somewhere all\nstrange. We didn\u2019t know where to go. So, I said to Krysia, \u201cI\u2019m not going. I\u2019m going\nback. My father is there,\u201d and I thought Renia was with us, but I asked her. So, maybe\nRenia was there, so we didn\u2019t want to go. And so we went back. He says, \u201cI warned you.\u201d\nAnd then he says, \u201cOkay, if you don\u2019t want to run away now,\u201d because I said to him, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t have where to run.\u201d So, he says, \u201cIf you don\u2019t , but don\u2019t write it down, just\nremember, what I\u2019m going to tell you know. Just remember. My name is Leo Bernard.\nMy address is Merignan Mine (ph). Don\u2019t write it down anywhere, but if you ever have a\nchance or any of you have a chance. If you remember to tell them to come, I\u2019 ll say - you\ncould stay whatever.\u201d Like, we would have an address where to run away.",
        "A: This story\u2019s almost finished.",
        "A: So, anyway we came back. We didn\u2019t trust him. We stayed there for a long time until we\ncame to Auschwitz. We didn\u2019t trust him. From time to time, he open the door and he\u2019d\nput a few parcels of some food that he - I don\u2019t know - for anybody, and this is the end of\nthe story. When we came to Auschwitz, he says, \u201cI warned you, because from here, there\nis..\u201d\u201d He came to me again and says, \u201cI warned you because there\u2019s no escape from\nanywhere from here.\u201d And, this is the end. So, when I came to Canada, which was, we\ncame to Canada in \u201948 - I was thinking about it. I said, \u201cI wonder whether he told us the\ntruth.\u201d So, 20 years later or so, I wrote a letter to this address. I was just wondering\nwhether such a person - whether he was lying, whether a person like that would exist, that\nwhether he really wanted to save our lives, whether he wanted to shoot us. I was never\nsure, so I thought I would write him a thank you letter for his good intentions. I wrote in\nEnglish, and the letter came back \u201cNo One Under this Name\u201d So, did he lie? Did he say\nthe truth? But, he really and truly told us to run.\nEnd of Tape #9\nTape #10",
        "A: More men.",
        "A: Considerable amount. I would say, let\u2019s take a thousand as a unit - I would say there was\n700 men and 300 women. I mean, roughly; I\u2019m just estimating. Because I go by the\namount of barracks. There were more men\u2019s barracks than girls\u2019.",
        "A: Because when they were picking people to work, there was more jobs for men than\nwomen. There were very - like the munitions factory, I had , they had different\ndepartments, but they were doing, like, iron in the hot fire and the women couldn\u2019t do\nwork like that. So, they had departments like that where you had - you had to have the\nstrength for this kind of work. So, there was always more men than women.",
        "A: I would say that at least we traveled two nights because I remember a day and then a\nnight, and I remember another day and another night. So, it\u2019s possible that we came on\nthe third day, we came to. I was talking to Renia about it. She thinks we went there faster,\nbut those trains didn\u2019t go fast. The train didn\u2019t go on a regular route. They trains were\ngoing on side roads and they were very slow, very slow, and they stopped from time to\ntime for crossing, for different things, and I remember two nights when they closed the\ndoors and then when they opened the door slightly for us to get a little bit of breeze, and\nas you know, on the way to Auschwitz, a lot of people perished. Some were trampled by\nother people. As a matter of fact, my husband\u2019s brother and father died in the - because\nthere was so many people, 125 people, and they had to go to the bathroom and they had\nto do, you know, those things were not provided. I don\u2019t remember anymore going for\nwater except for this once, and also a lot of people jumped the trains and they couldn\u2019t\nhave jumped the trains if the train was going fast. One of them, some of them, like I\nremember, but I forgot the name of that man but I knew him well, but a lot of people\njumped and they were killed. They were killed because the guards - the canaries - were\nshooting at them, you know, like the train was going slow. So, I would say that two\nnights and two and a half days.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Just go.",
        "A: Horrible. The stench was unbelievable.",
        "A: Crying and screaming and that\u2019s why they jumped, because it didn\u2019t matter to them. They\njumped the train because it was better to be shot then to go wherever, I mean, in such\nconditions. We didn\u2019t where we were going, because I believed that we were going to\nanother camp to work, like, to another labor camp to work, but that was me. I wanted to\nbelieve it. But other people, I don\u2019t know whether they knew we were going to\nAuschwitz, but some people preferred to die than to go there.",
        "A: We heard - we heard shots and we heard moans and we heard screams. We heard it all,\nall the time, and I mean, you know, it was - that was a very traumatic time. Different\npeople reacted differently. I remember - I remember Krysia. My hair was shiny and I\nused to wear it like this with a - with a...whatever. Krysia used to say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry\nfor you, because if you die with such nice hair.\u201d",
        "A: Macabre jokes. But it was, you know, like we didn\u2019t know what to expect, where we are\ngoing. Like, later on we found out that we are in Auschwitz, but I mean, we didn\u2019t even\nknow how horrible Auschwitz was, because you heard things but you really didn\u2019t\nbelieve it.",
        "A: We heard it, but we never believed that it could be worse than Starachowice camp. Like,\nthe camp, consider going - don\u2019t forget they killed us slowly. First there was the ghetto,\nthen was a smaller ghetto, then there was the camp. So, I mean, we couldn\u2019t believe that\nanything could be any worse than we already went through. Like, you never believed that\nthey\u2019re killing people in Auschwitz. You heard about it, but you didn\u2019t believe it.",
        "A: I was. Because I - I knew that he wasn\u2019t the same strong man as he was before, but we\nwere also afraid of us. Like, I was afraid that Renia would never survive because - not\nbecause I was afraid that they would kill her or anything, but that she was not healthy\nenough to survive such hard times.",
        "A: She did, but she was still - she was always the most frightened, because I was very\ndaring. I wasn\u2019t afraid. I was daring, but - and Krysia, too - but, Renia was always afraid.\nShe was always shaking, always afraid.",
        "A: Not in the same way. I think that Chris was the most realistic person. She organized\nthings for us, whether it was food in Auschwitz or whatever, she was able to do those\nthings. I, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t afraid of the devil. Like, if they told me to go right at\nsomething, I wouldn\u2019t have gone. I wasn\u2019t afraid because - I don\u2019t know why, but I\nwasn\u2019t. But Renia was - she always was hiding in corners. She was always cold. She was\nalways sick. So, that was our worry, but we were very lucky that we kept together. We\nalways watched for one another, and I'l tell you that, at a certain time when we were\ngoing to Auschwitz, not - from Auschwitz to Ravensbriick, when we were walking the\ndeath march, if not my sisters - I lost my conscious. I didn\u2019t know where I was. I couldn\u2019t\nwalk, and I was the tallest. Both of my sisters, Renia and Chris almost carried on one\nside. It\u2019s not far anymore, let\u2019s - a few more steps, Hania, a few more steps. They saved\nmy life, the same way as, in other moments, I saved their life.",
        "A: Organized, most practical, she always found us food. She was very, very, very good at\nthat way. And she always shared not only with us, she shared it with others. And I was a\ndevil. I wasn\u2019t afraid of anything. I was just not afraid, and I\u2019Il tell you, since I was the\ntallest, there was always a risk that whenever there was a selection or they looked for\nsomebody to work for a job or whatever, they would always - always - even if I was in\nthe back. Like, Krysia says, \u201cDon\u2019t stay 1n the front, stay in the back. They\u2019Il take you to\ntake blood. They\u2019ll take you to do this.\u201d So, but no matter where I stood they - because I\nwas a tall sticking out - so, \u201cThis one.\u201d But, sometimes it was good and sometimes it\nwasn\u2019t so good.",
        "A: I took risks.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know if they were.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t turn out bad because I wasn\u2019t afraid somehow.",
        "A: You know I helped us to escape from this last, last...but this will be another story.",
        "A: No, we were in the last car. I think that my father was in the car before us, or two before\nus, because I don\u2019t remember whether all the women were one after the other or they\npicked a car full of women, then men and then women. I don\u2019t know, because we were in\nthe last car, and I know that my father was fairly close by. So, Krysia thinks that he was\nin the car right after us. I was under the impression - because we talked about - I was\nunder the impression that they kept women separately so, they must have been in the\nthird car, but he was close.",
        "A: When the doors were opened to go out?",
        "A: First of all, we had a very bad experience because the guards that took us before they\ntook us to change our dresses and everything, we went very close by a crematorium, or if\nthat wasn\u2019t a crematorium, we were told it was a crematorium. So, I remember having a\nbottle of whiskey that this Frenchman - I forgot to tell you that the Frenchman left in\nAuschwitz, he says, \u201cIf they take you to the crematorium...\u201d So, we had this bottle of\nwhiskey. I never drank in my life, but all the girls - I told the girls, so when they German\nsoldiers stopped us in front of the crematorium, or he called this crematorium, so we took\nthis bottle and every girl had a taste. Not a taste of it, but you know, like we were\nthinking that we\u2019re going to die now so let\u2019s just be merry. We never drank in our\nlifetimes, but the whole bottle went. Like, as far as 1t went from us, and then they took us\nto the place where they cut our hair, and after that he stayed with us there for a few\nminutes to scare us or to whatever - to whatever, and then they took us to the place where\nwe had to leave everything we had, to put on the uniform or whatever you call it, a dress\nwith stripes, and they cut our hair. This is another story how I suffered the most out of all\nof three of us. And, then we went to the barrack. So, Pll tell you maybe how they first\nbrought us in and told us to take all our clothes off and they put nothing else, we had no\nbrassiere, this I remember - because I was so - it felt so strange to just have the dress on -\nand they gave us the dress. The dress was too short on me, so there was a small girl that I\ndon\u2019t know who, we changed dresses to fit us. Because we were all very skinny, but\nnobody was as tall as I. They were mostly smaller people. So, there were just a few long\ndresses. I was glad that somebody exchanged with me the dress. Then, they cut our hair\nto here. They checked our hair for lice. They put this stuff in, disinfectant or whatever\nyou call it, in our hair and on our bodies before they gave us the dresses, and I remember,\nthey took away my shoes. So, they gave us such wooden shoes - wooden shoes - and this\nwas a case where the wooden shoes - we were already in dresses and men from another\ncamp were distributing the shoes, and the guy says, \u201cTake it, take it.\u201d To me like, in\nPolish we have - like in English you say \u201cyou\u201d it means everything, but do you\nunderstand French or German? So, they say \u201cvous\u201d or \u201ctu\u201d or in German they said - they\nsay, because here you say \u201cyou\u201d, in Polish also you never talk to a lady by calling her\n\u201cDou\u2019(ph), you caller her \u201cVu\u201d like, and the guy says, \u201cTake those, take those.\u201d Well I\njust said, \u201cHow dare you calling me \u2018dou\u2019?\u201d Okay, it was so stupid. And, then so anyway\nI put those dresses - I couldn\u2019t walk in them, and then they put us five people in a row to\nmarch to the barracks. So, we were five, and so - Krysia, Renia and I were three and there\nwas three others. They didn\u2019t want to part and we didn\u2019t want to part. So, this woman\ngoes, she says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the commotion? The couple there.\u201d You know, I just came to a\nnew camp. I didn\u2019t like the way guy says to me \u201cDou,\u201d and here she screams at me. I\nwasn\u2019t really used to it because you know nobody really mistreated me when I worked\nbefore, and she says, \u201cGo to the back.\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to the back.\u201d She says - I\nsay, \u201cThose are my two sisters.\u201d She didn\u2019t even want to hear. She took me by the hair,\ngrabbed me by the hair, to the German man there that was cutting the hair, and she says,\n\u201cMake a cross on her head.\u201d So, you know, she was mad that I talked back to her. So,\nfirst he made the cross, and then he felt sorry for me and he shaved my head, but I was\nthe only one with a really shaved head of hair. You know, like, I didn\u2019t have anything on\nmy head - just - I don\u2019t know whether I looked like a boy or whatever. Anyway, finally\nwe just didn\u2019t want to be parted and I didn\u2019t care what she says. She couldn\u2019t kill me, like\nI was daring. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going, they are my two sisters. I\u2019m going with them.\u201d So,\nshe got mad. She pushed us. Anyway, we\u2019re together. I didn\u2019t want to part from them,\nbecause if I went to the back or whatever, I mean, it wasn\u2019t the next row - we would have\nnever been together. When we came to the barrack...",
        "A: Right. Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I think so.",
        "A: Oh, but you know, when did I get it there? When did I get the tattoo? After we had the\nshower, after we had the shower, and we got the dress, we went there and we got the\ntattoo. Before we went to the barrack - so, I must have had already my hair - I must have\nhad my hair cut short already. I - I was already with shaven head. I was the only one.\nEverybody had had hair to here because, you know, when we went to - they wouldn\u2019t\nhave touched us. This is my logic now - they wouldn\u2019t have touched us before they\ndisinfected us. Don\u2019t forget when we were - when we went under the shower, we shed\nour clothes and we got whatever clothes to put on. We were already, like, we were\nalready clean. It was after the wash. They sprayed such a horrible thing on us. It smelled\nhorrible, and it was stinging us because it was against - I don\u2019t know against what - a\ndisinfectant. So, I\u2019m positive that they wouldn\u2019t have touched our hair if we didn\u2019t go\nthrough disinfection before. That\u2019s my logic now; I don\u2019t remember the sequence.",
        "A: Yeah, I remember that a German cut my hair.",
        "A: A German man - soldier.",
        "A: He must have been a barber. He must have - a German soldier shaved my head. I don\u2019t\nremember who cut my hair or - because that was a routine. Like, everybody was just\ngetting their hair cut, but this one was a punishment for being disobedient, for talking\nback to the kapo.",
        "A: I do.",
        "A: No, it was like - like with a needle, that\u2019s what it was. It didn\u2019t hurt, but as if you put a lot\nof needles all the time, and we have numbers.",
        "A: Yeah. I have 1736 or something and Krysia has the next number and Reina has the next\nnumber.",
        "A: Yeah and Renia has...",
        "A: Yeah, I remember that we had numbers one after another.",
        "A: All of them.",
        "A: You know that I don\u2019t remember, but we had a patch there. No, we didn\u2019t have - we had\nyellow patches. The Polish people had - a triangle.",
        "A: One triangle.",
        "A: Was it a bar above it? I don\u2019t remember, but that was a triangle. So, that was in\nAuschwitz.",
        "A: No, I wore it on my sleeve because in the last camp, we had red ones because we had\nregistered as Poles, but this is - in this camp, we had yellow, yellow triangles. I remember\nhaving the lower part here and like this. It wasn\u2019t a white armband, this was in the ghetto.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. Most likely, but I didn\u2019t have a needle, but maybe it was a glue that\nthey glued it on. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember, but we wore yellow triangles.",
        "A: I think that, when they gave us the tattoo, they wrote down the name and the number, and\nfrom there on we were numbers. There were no names.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t get a card, but when they registered us, because the Starachowice group\ncame separately, and the Starachowice groups came separately. All Starachowice groups\nhave this number, you know, like one after another, and I forgot what you asked me.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have a card.",
        "A: They just wrote our names. They wrote down our numbers, and from there on, we had no\nnames. Like, we called each other by the name, but if they called - if they called you for\nsome reason, they called you by the number.",
        "A: Now III tell you the story. I, myself - okay, we came in. They gave us a barrack, three\nrows of bunks, bigger bunks than we had, but I would say six - five to six people slept.\nWe had to sleep like sardines. One this way, one this way, one this way, because - and\nthey were boards, just boards, because in camp in Starachowice, we had straw\nunderneath. Here, you know, like it was a straw sack with straw inside. So, it wasn\u2019t so\nbad. This was on the bare thing and we - there wasn\u2019t enough room to sleep one way. We\nhad to have the heads one way... But now I\u2019m going back, because when we arrived,\nthere was a little window similar enough to the windows without bars, but similar to the\nwindow in the train that I told you, a small just to let some light in. So, I, you know, I\u2019m\ntall, so I stood there and I see - I see there\u2019s a man there, and I looked at - I looked, it was\nmyself, but I didn\u2019t know. So, I say, \u201cMan!\u201d I looked out this way. I don\u2019t see any man,\nbut then I looked in the mirror, and there\u2019s a man there. So, I started moving my head. I\nrealized that\u2019s me. I didn\u2019t recognize myself. I would never believe. I was very skinny at\nthe time and very tall, and my head looked like a pin drop, like with the hair, you know,\nmy head was very small by comparison. Like, I couldn\u2019t recognize myself, and it was\nfunny because one day I was walking the streets and, you know, the men was coming -\nwere coming to do the toilets in the ladies\u2019 - the ladies didn\u2019t clean - it wasn\u2019t a toilet -\nhow do you call it when there are only holes?",
        "A: The latrines. The men were coming to clean the latrine and one of our guys, a boy from\nGermany - I remember his name, Lothar - he was picked to clean the toilets. So, he came\nin and he saw me. He was so happy. He comes, he says, \u201cTell Hania that your father is\nalive.\u201d I looked at him and I was so vain, I didn\u2019t tell him for a minute that I was Hania,\nbecause I didn\u2019t want anybody to know that I looked like that. He didn\u2019t - I don\u2019t know -\nI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t ask him, but I came home and I said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad he didn\u2019t\nrecognize me.\u201d Like, people are stupid. I mean, I\u2019m talking about myself. So, then we\nwent into the barrack. The barrack was run by four people. There was the Lager Alteste,\nwhich was responsible for the barrack. There were two thousand people going in one\nbarrack, you can imagine how many people. So, there was the Lager Alteste. She was a\nCzechoslovakian girl. Her name was Yolichka (ph). Then there was a Shreiberin who had\na job like I had. She kept records who went to work, and she was doing all the office\nwork. Her name was Felicia Berlant (ph). She\u2019s still alive. She saved our lives. She was\nthe Shreiberin. Then there were two Steuben Alteste. The barrack was divided in four and\neach Steuben Alteste which was responsible for this part - for like two parts of the barrack\non this side, and two parts of the barrack on that side. She kept, she kept, she made us\nclean the places where you slept. She made us responsible for, responsible for\ncleanliness, that\u2019s all, and order in the places. When we arrived, this Yolichka (ph) spoke\nCzech to us, but we understood. This Fela Berlant (ph), she got the job because she could\nscream the most and she had a language similar to Vaschek (ph). So, when we arrived\nand we didn\u2019t stay straight she says, \u201cYou...\u201d - I have to translate 1t because - \u201cQuiet, you\nwhores from Starachowice.\u201d She didn\u2019t call us any other - not that she was bad. She\nsaved our lives and many other people. She was a good woman, but otherwise she\nwouldn\u2019t have had the job if she didn\u2019t speak like that. She called us names of all sorts.\nAnd when we arrived, and we got the job, we were working outside the camp, outside the\ncamp, and we were cutting bulrushes in wetland. So, we stood always in cold water,\nwetland, cutting, and those - we had those knives that the Germans gave us at the place of\nwork already, that we had to cut, but it was so woody, like it was so hard. It was the\nhardest job I ever had. My hands were bleeding because the bulrushes when they grow\nfor such a long time, they become woody, and to cut it with a knife it\u2019s very hard. He had\n- he had german shepherds, like he took us to work. We cut it. We were cutting those\nbushes, two german shepherds - like, I don\u2019t know how many of the guards were there\nthat took us, but two huge german shepherds and as a matter of fact, the first day he\ntaught me a lesson. Of course, I was picked because I was tall again. So, he wanted to\nshow us that if - because we were outside the camp and the reason why they were cutting\nthose bushes because they wanted to clean up the barbed wire walls in order, if somebody\nwanted to run away and hide there or if there was a partisan attack or some attack, so they\ncould hide in those bulrushes. So, we had to cut them. So, he wanted to show us what\nwould happen to everybody - to anybody that intends to run away. So, he called his dog\nand he told him to - he told him to start biting my dress, and he must have told him in\nGerman, because he didn\u2019t touch me. He just tear my dress to pieces, and of course, I\nfroze because I am afraid of dogs, like especially touch, you know, the mean dogs that\nbark so, and the teeth were so bad, and he stopped at him at a certain time and started\nagain. So, the dog didn\u2019t bite me, but he bit, like, my dress was in shreds. I got another\ndress from Fela when I went back. But, that was a time when I was really scared, very\nscared, because I thought the dog was going to kill me. So, I just stood there, and so we\nworked there for three months. After three months...",
        "A: Yeah, no, I - I didn\u2019t have any other shoes. I had to wear the wooden shoes.",
        "A: In the marshes - no, in the marshes we took off the shoes.",
        "A: And, as a matter of fact, we even washed our dresses as much because we didn\u2019t get them\nso often, maybe every two weeks or so. We didn\u2019t go to showers every day, you know,\nthe showers - I'll tell you a story about, a separate story, but when I came home Fela gave\nme right away another dress. So, that was okay.",
        "A: Not showers, we went every week they took us to such a place where they were - once a\nweek we went...\nEnd of Tape #10\nTape #11",
        "A: Yeah, we were going to - I don\u2019t - in Birkenau, in another section, where they had a place\nwhere most likely they were taking the inmates - I call them inmates - regularly, once a\nweek or once every ten days, whatever time, you know, and we were going to those\nthings to have showers. So, I don\u2019t know how often I did that, I don\u2019t remember, but I\nthink once a week or once every ten days. When we arrived there, we undressed, they\ntook our clothes, they put it through the same function, like they gave us - okay, what\nthey had to do to put this stuff to disinfect all the dresses. So, they gave us - they took\nanother bunch that they already disinfected from another group, and they gave it to us,\nand we had a new dress, but each time it was a new old dress. Each time, I had to fight to\nget the longest, but I was very lucky. The girls always cooperated with me because\notherwise they would have to have a dress like this. So, that was the procedure. So,\nwhenever we went there, German soldiers would come - like, we would be - I mean, this\nwasn\u2019t in the plan, but I think that was the character that they wanted to do it - they would\ncome to the room where we were, and they would take a hose with cold water, put it on\nthe highest tension, and they would just not only tease the girls, but they would come and\nthey would just try to spray you with this - with all the force in your private parts. If you\nscreamed or you danced, they did worse to you. So, we knew that we had to stand still.\nWe had to disregard it. We had to say nothing, just stand there and pretend that it doesn\u2019t\nhappen to you. So, that - so, we weren\u2019t looking forward to the showers so much because\nwe had to suffer, and nobody - I\u2019m sure that it wasn\u2019t like, it wasn\u2019t meant to be like that,\nbut they did it.",
        "A: Yeah, 20...20. My sister thinks it was 25, but I think it was 20.",
        "A: I never went back. I couldn\u2019t do it. Like, my sister...",
        "A: I didn\u2019t look. No, I didn\u2019t look. I\u2019m almost positive it\u2019s 20, because I trust my memory,\nbut my sister thinks it\u2019s 25. Krysia thinks it\u2019s 25.",
        "A: Because we - we differ on that, because I remember - because Miles went to - went to -\nwhen he got the barrack, he wanted our barrack, and I was under the impression that they\ngave him, our barrack. I\u2019m not sure, but he said that when they offered to give him a\nbarrack for the museum, and he said when he goes there, he\u2019s going to ask for it, because\nthey don\u2019t care which barrack. They had to dismantle it anyway to send it to - so, he says\nhe will try to get our barrack. Whether he did or not, I couldn\u2019t tell you.",
        "A: You know, that I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. I remember that we had to - I don\u2019t know whether it was the next day, but 1t was soon\nafter we came, we got this job.",
        "A: Right away.",
        "A: I believed it. I believed it.",
        "A: Yeah, because we - the crematorium, we felt it. The stench of the, like, 1t was very easy\nbecause we met other girls from different barracks, and the stench from the crematorium,\nyou know, the bones burning and the hair burning and the heat and the fire that was going\nout from there. So, we knew that people - I even knew - I remember, someone told me\nthat 3,000 people can go into one of those crematoriums after they are gassed, apparently,\nthat\u2019s what I was told. I was never inside, but I\u20191l repeat what I was told, that 3,000\npeople can be put at one time into the gas chamber, and apparently after they\u2019re gassed,\nthe floor opens and they go, and the fire starts burning. So, they don\u2019t handle it, they only\nhandle ashes. They don\u2019t handle the bodies. That\u2019s what I was told, and I asked - I\nremember, they told me 3,000 people at one time.",
        "A: Yeah, another woman prisoner from - maybe Fela told us or maybe Yolichka (ph), or\nmaybe one of those that were a little bit longer, the girls that worked there. They could\nhave told us, but I remember asking and that was the answer I got, and I could smell it\nmyself all day, every day.",
        "A: Yes. I mean, from the chimneys. I didn\u2019t see fire as fire, but they had such long chimneys\nand some flames were coming out, and they were making the air impossible, like it was\nimpossible to breath.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Pll tell you what. This Fela took care of us immediately. She liked - I think she liked\nKrysia the most. I don\u2019t care, but she was so good to us, whenever she had an extra piece\nof bread or something, if she had something, the three girls - she just - she just was, I\nmean, as bad as she was - maybe she wasn\u2019t bad. She had a huge, big mouth. She\nscreamed, because otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have had a job.",
        "A: Yeah, she was from Helm (ph). I know, because I just saw her. I\u2019m - we are friends\nbecause she really saved our lives, really saved our lives, and I'll tell you right away how.\nSo, anyway, when we were there for three months working so hard, she tried to always\ngive me a better dress, or you know, if she had something that was special, she would\nalways give it to us and really treat us a little better then she treated everybody else. And\nthen, one time, there was a Polish uprising in Warsaw, not Jewish, Polish uprising, and\nthey caught all the people - Polish girls to - that they caught, that they thought that took\npart in this uprising, maybe men, too, but they came to Auschwitz, and they were Polish\npeople, so they didn\u2019t go to crematorium and they didn\u2019t go to a barrack where they send\nthem to hard labor, and what they did - whatever they brought with them, the suitcases\nand everything, every piece of clothes had to be recorded, and when they - and they had\nred triangles - and when they finished their sentence, because they were not convicted for\nlife or taken to camp like that, but when they finished the verdict for two months, half a\nyear, a year, they were getting the clothes washed and ironed, and they went home. So, at\nthat time, Jews never worked in this department, only Polish people, but because of the\nfact that Polish people were coming and they didn\u2019t want any problems, they needed 20\ngirls to go there, to write down the, you know, to sort out the clothes, to write down the\nclothes, to hang up the clothes, to wash the laundry and stuff like that. So, they decided to\ntake 20 Jewish girls from our - from - and of course the Shreiberin got the order - the first\ntwo of us, she picked me and Krysia right away, and she had the 20 girls because we\nbegged her to take - to give Renia. She\u2019s like, \u201cI can\u2019t. This is office work. She looks -\nshe\u2019s too young. They want - they will never take her.\u201d So, we begged her and begged\nher. So, she went to Yolichka (ph) who was the Lager Alteste - the barrack Alteste, and\nshe asked her. She said, \u201cWell, all I can do is to ask the German.\u201d You know, the German\nguy that\u2019s going to pick them up if he agrees, but she says, \u201cI can\u2019t take all of them,\nbecause they need 20 people.\u201d So, anyway we were so nervous, I remember, the German\ncame in. Fela was there standing, and Yolichka (ph) went to the German soldier who was\ntransporting us to the new job, and she said to him, \u201cThere\u2019s three sisters, the youngest is\nthe best, but she looks a little bit small, but she isn\u2019t that young. She only looks young\nand she\u2019s the best of them all. She can organize...\u201d I don\u2019t know what happened to the\nGerman. He said yes for Reina. She brought her in. She was the 21\u201c, that never happened\nbefore. I don\u2019t know whether it was pure luck or whether it was Fela who did that for us,\nor whether it was Yolichka (ph) that did it for us, or whether the German just felt sorry\nfor whatever reason. We were transported to a new life. First of all, when we came there,\nthis department wasn\u2019t for Jews. So, everyone - although we slept, I don\u2019t know, ten in\none room, but we had - we had cots for separate, like, it was also three \u201cfloors\u201d I call it,\nbut they were single. They were single, and they had sheets and everything, like no\nappels, can you imagine? No - I didn\u2019t tell you a story about appels before. No appels of\nany kind because there was only 20 of us, and some of the Polish girls, they left a few\nPolish girls to teach us how to do the work. Some of them, we found out after the war,\nthey were Jewish but they were on Polish papers - some of them. With one, Krysia is in\ncontact with one Polish girl she\u2019s in contact with lived - that worked there. That was the\nbest job we could get. The Polish girls were coming. They gave us the stuff. In their\npresence, we wrote down everything they had. We put it in a sack. The sack was hanging\nthere with their number. And, when they were going out, we had to wash and iron their\nstuff, but we - we weren\u2019t there long enough to wash and iron, but we were taught to do\nthat. So, it was the best job. There was 21 girls that had - I mean, we weren\u2019t there too\nlong because we went there maybe in November and in January we were transported\nsomewhere else, but I didn\u2019t believe it\u2019s Auschwitz. It was the best job and I said now\nthat we were so lucky, because can you imagine, there was so many of us, and we were\nlucky, the three of us, that we got this job in Auschwitz. I mean, it was the best possible\nbecause it wasn\u2019t meant for Jews. It just happened that they needed - they didn\u2019t want\nPolish girls doing it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No...",
        "A: Not with us. We had to stand appel every morning, four o\u2019clock, five o\u2019clock. It was dark\nwhen we out for appe/ in Auschwitz, in Birkenau. But in here, we didn\u2019t have to do it\nbecause, when they brought - like, we had to work at any time they brought the - when\nthey arrived. When they arrived, we had to take their stuff away. They went to sauna,\nbecause there were the saunas were. As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, I reminded\nmyself now, that from camp, people were coming and you know what we were doing for\nthem, like when they were coming for - to the saunas? We took, like for drinking water\nwe had such - it wasn\u2019t a pail, it was such a thing with a spout - so, we would steal from\nthe Polish - from the Polish bags or suitcases or whatever a pair of underwear, a brassiere,\nbecause, you know, whatever we could put. We went for water, nobody asked us\nanything. We didn\u2019t have any German people supervising us. It was an easy job. So, we\nwent there for water, and then whatever we had in the pitcher - it was a big pitcher what\nwe were getting drinking water from. So, we would go there and distribute it to the\nStarachowice girls, and whoever wanted anything. So, we would - whatever we could\nsteal from the Polish girls we gave it to them.",
        "A: In Birkenau. It was called - I know in Polish what it was called.",
        "A: Rozowy effekt. Pink effekt because they were where the Jews where when they took all\nthe clothes was it was called Kanada, and it was Red effekt, but they - we didn\u2019t work in\nthis department. This was for specifically, not for gentile, but Polish people, you know,\nthis one, from the - maybe it was another department there - but after the uprising in\nWarsaw by the Polish people, very many were arrested. So, that was - it was called\nRozowy effekt, which means Pink effekt, whatever it was. The other was called Red effekt,\nand it was called Kanada. I don\u2019t know why.",
        "A: The sauna was there because, I remember, at first I didn\u2019t remember where we were\ngoing, but I remembered that those people were coming. I remember \u2019s sister, she\nwanted a powder box. I said, \u201cWhere would I find a powder box?\u201d",
        "A: Well, she wanted such a box to put powder in, with powder. But, you know, it was\nstrange but I mean, when you are in camp and you think that they could get anything,\nmaybe just to look at it. But that was the best job we had, because we didn\u2019t have to stand\nappel. We had enough food because there was only 20 of us. The Polish girls that were\nthere were getting parcels from home, and I remember they had onions, and the parents\nwere sending them stuff, food that was called like very nutritious, because we didn\u2019t get\nany apples or pears or anything. So, when the parents would send, and the Polish girls\nwere allowed to get parcels from home, and this girl Ioasha (ph) who 1s still alive and\nKrysia with her in contact all the time, she found her when they went to Warsaw. When\nshe got a parcel, she always shared it with us. So, we weren\u2019t - in addition to the bread\nand the soup that we were getting, in this camp - we weren\u2019t there too long, in this\nbarrack - but we were there all I say from the end of November until January the 18\", a\ncouple of months, because we arrived in Auschwitz in July, and so we were there July,\nAugust, September, October, November - five months. I said three months - five months\nin Auschwitz where we did the bulrushes, and then the two and a half months in this\nplace or two months.",
        "A: Yes, it did, because we didn\u2019t see any Germans, like, there was only the supervisor and\nthe supervisor was the Polish girl who was really Jewish, but there she was nobody. She\nhad a Polish name. She, as a matter of fact, she wrote a book about Auschwitz and she\ntold - in the book she says her name was Landau, but there was Jevulska (ph). She had a\nPolish name. She was from - because there was just a few Polish girls that were\nsupervisors because before that there were other girls, but as I said, after the Warsaw\nuprising, they wanted Jews there.",
        "A: She worked. She worked very - she was so efficient, believe me. Renia did the same job\nas we did, because once she got there, she was treated - nobody bothered with her. She\nworked very well. As a matter of fact, she was a very good worker. She was one of the\nbest.",
        "A: She was always a physical weakling. She was never very strong. Ever since she was a\nchild, she always was susceptible to different sicknesses.",
        "A: We were told that, on the 18\" of J anuary, we are going west, because whatever it was, we\nknew that the Russians were very close. As a matter of fact, we were told that the\nRussians were 70 kilometers from Auschwitz, and they were sending the people west to\nBergen-Belsen and to all sorts of camps, but first we had to go through Ravensbrick. So,\nthat was the death march because the trains - 1t was, the weather was very bad. The trains\ndidn\u2019t go fast enough. It was very cold on the 18\" of March. On the 18\" of March, we\nleft Auschwitz.",
        "A: Sorry, 18\" of January. I don\u2019t know why I said March. On the 18\" of January, I said, it\nwas snowing and blowing, on the 18\" of January we went to Ravensbriick. I\u2019m sorry. We\nwent to Ravensbruck, and the train was going slow, and part of it we were walking, and\nmy shoes were all frozen. I couldn\u2019t put them on. I had to put them in the car in the train.\nI put - to wear my shoes to just be able to slip them on because they, you know, when I\ntook them off to - for the night, I couldn\u2019t open them. And, then we...",
        "A: Later, we got other shoes. I\u2019Il tell you, when we came to the - to the place where we\nworked with - the last place, we could pick up any shoes there and put my shoes.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s true.",
        "A: That\u2019s possible, too, because I remember that if not my sisters - I couldn\u2019t walk. I was\ndragging my feet and I saw pictures that didn\u2019t exist. I saw horses and people, maybe I\nhad a bad - a bad vision there, but I couldn\u2019t have had, because I started so long I was\nworking, always was working like this. So, I saw things that didn\u2019t exist. And, if my\nsisters wouldn\u2019t have kept me, I don\u2019t think I would have survived. Maybe Renia had\n_____, or maybe I woke up a little and we carried Renia. That was the - then you saw so\nmany dead people because the Germans were pushing us to go west with their dogs, and\nwhoever couldn\u2019t go, they would just shooting, like they couldn\u2019t - and, you saw those\npeople. One person was sitting under a tree - was sitting there. He was dead, and you\nknow, what the worst part was that the people that were walking were taking the shoes\nand the - when they saw a dead person, quickly they would get the jacket or whatever\nthey could grab. Nobody worried about it - what shoes or whatever they could get quickly\nso the Germans wouldn\u2019t send the dogs after them, and they walked - we just disregarded\nall the - the dead people. But to me, the man that was sitting under the tree, he looked so\nreal and so alive and he was dead. Maybe, he just sat down to die. Then, we came to\nRavensbrick, I don\u2019t know, three days later, two days later. I don\u2019t know exactly what\ndate it was, and there was no room for us in the barracks, and it was freezing and it was\nsnowing, so we had to stay outside - sleep outside. So, we slept in the snow together, like\nwe just warmed each other from the bodies, you know, with our bodies, we just warmed\neach other, and slept in the snow. Then, in the morning, we didn\u2019t get anything to eat. So,\nwe took this dirty snow - most of the times, we took the snow from trees or something -\nand we drank it and ate it. For three days, we had no meat - because they didn\u2019t have any\nroom. From every side the people were sent to Ravensbriick. They didn\u2019t have - they\ndidn\u2019t even register us. They didn\u2019t even write our names. So, after three days, they send\nus to a camp called Retzow, which was...",
        "A: No, that was...",
        "A: I think it was in Retzow. I'll tell you in a minute how it was, but I have to remind myself\nwhether it was in Ravens - no, it was - we were there three days, I don\u2019t remember. I\nthought that they didn\u2019t register us, only in Retzow. But I will tell you this story. Now, I\nget confused. I would have to ask them. When we stood in line to be registered, I think it\nwas in Retzow, but I could be wrong, maybe they did register us and that was in\nRavensbriick. We decided, like I told my sisters that if the Germans - the Russians were\n70 kilometers from Auschwitz, and sound away (ph) fire in Auschwitz, like before we\nwere moved, we were taken on the death march there to Ravensbriick, we saw fire. And\nsomebody told us that they are burning all the records. You know, and I believed it was\ntrue, because the Russians were so close, they didn\u2019t want to have the records. So, we\nsaid - I said to my sisters, \u201c\u201cWe can save our lives by pretending we are Polish.\u201d So, Chris\nhad a boyfriend; his name was Kleinburg. Kleinburg is a small mountain, you know,\nthat\u2019s what it means in German, like, if you translate it. So, she translated it into Polish:\nmala gorska. I said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s too long. Who 1s going to...? Let\u2019s eliminate the \u2018mala\u2019 and\nwe'll have the \u2018gorsky\u2019, \u2018gorska\u2019.\u201d So, we had to remember, what was the mother\u2019s\nname. So, my mother\u2019s name was Pola Blum - Tannenblum, but they were called Blum.\nSo, I said, in Polish, a blum 1s a flower, it\u2019s like fiatek, so Fiatekosky, because if it was\nfiatek, you couldn\u2019t say fiatek. What was your father\u2019s name? So, we said \u201cGorsky\u201d\nbecause our name was Gorsky, and the first name, his name was Isaac, so we said \u201cAnje\u201d\nbecause Anje was such a typical peasant Polish name. So, we gave this name to them.\nThen if they asked us any other questions, we have to remember that we are Polish; we\nare never Jewish. And of course, when we registered, we got the red, the red triangles.\nThat means political prisoners, so, you know. And immediately, when we arrived, I met\nsome people that I knew, and they didn\u2019t want to talk to me because they had the yellow -\nwe call it winkle (ph) - yellow triangle and we had the red one, and they didn\u2019t want to\ncause any problems for us that are Jewish and we are Polish, so they didn\u2019t talk to us, but\nlater we told them not to worry about it. When we arrived in Retzow - this is very, not a\nvery interesting, but that\u2019s again a personal story.\nEnd of Tape #11\nTape #12",
        "A: So, we arrived in Retzow, I think we registered there, and then we lined up for work. So,\nthe man in charge - I don\u2019t know his name, but I know his title. It\u2019s a mouthful:\nHaupstunshaufithrer (ph), and he had - there was a barrack, the German barrack where\nthey worked, and it was this Haupstunshauftihrer (ph) and then they were kapos, women,\nand then they were guards in the camp. What we did there was when we arrived there, he\nlined us up for work. He needed about, I would say, 12 people I think or so to clean the\nGerman barracks. Some people were going out to work. I don\u2019t know what they did\nbecause we were either too short and I wasn\u2019t working outside. So, first of all, the cook\ncame in and he picked Krysia. That was the biggest, you know, as if she won the lottery\nbecause - because if she is going to work in the kitchens, we would have what to eat\nbecause we just come from a place where we didn\u2019t eat for three days, and from\nAuschwitz where the food was so scarce that we were fainting most of the times. So,\nKrysia got the job in the kitchen. Then, they started picking people to clean the barracks.\nThe Germans - those were the best jobs, don\u2019t misunderstand me, the best jobs. So,\nanyway, he picked me first, and he started picking people and Renia got also in this\ngroup. So, then he showed where we are going to live and so on, and then he showed - he\ntold us where we are going to work. So, he picked me to work in his office. So, I figured,\nwhat am I going to do here in the office. I - I thought I\u2019m going to be a secretary or\nsomething. So, he comes in and he tells me - he asks me, \u201cKannst du putzen?\u201d \u201cDo you\nknow how to clean?\u201d I think myself, \u201cOf course I know - that\u2019s the best job I could get to\nclean those barracks.\u201d So, I said, like, but then I see, there is his desk with all the papers\nand the radio is playing. I think if I\u2019m going to play smart, I won\u2019t get this job, because,\nyou know, I have to be dumb to know how to clean the floors. So, I decided that I\u2019m not\ngoing to tell him that I know German. I don\u2019t know why, but at that moment, my mind\nstarted working, and I figured to clean the floors, you don\u2019t need to be intelligent, just be\nas dumb as you can. So, he says, \u201cCan you...\u201d Pll speak English. \u201cCan you speak\nGerman?\u201d So, I said [so-so gesture with hand]. And he said to me, \u201cAnd how about -\nwhat do you speak?\u201d So, I said, \u201cPolish.\u201d Polish he couldn\u2019t speak. So, he says to me,\n\u2018So what can you do?\u201d So, I said, \u201cPutzen.\u201d I mean, he told me already that I\u2019m going to\nclean. So, that\u2019s what - I didn\u2019t know. I never did the - I never cleaned a floor in the\nhouse, in my house, never touched it. So, then he says to me, \u201cWhen you clean, I don\u2019t\nwant you to touch anything on my - on my desk because this 1s all private. I don\u2019t want -\nif you want to - from time to time, Ill clean it, and you will be able to clean. All I want is\nto clean around, to clean the floor, but don\u2019t touch it, and don\u2019t touch my radio.\u201d So...",
        "A: In German.",
        "A: I pretend that - the way he shows me around, I pretend that I only understand a little bit.\nSo, then he sees that I\u2019m - I always - since I walked 1n, I decided that Ill play dumb. So,\nthen he says, he looks at me, he tells me, he shows me how to do this, how to do this,\nokay. Then, he says not to touch those - I mean, he was showing me because he knew\nthat I could only speak a little - then he says, \u201cCan you read?\u201d So, I look at him. I pretend\nthat I don\u2019t understand and I says [shakes head]. \u201cAnd write?\u201d So, I says, again a listened.\nI pretend, so he shows me. I said [shakes head]. So, he said - I remember - Krysia will tell\neverybody my \u201cSo gross ker faxen so dum\u201d. Do you understand this? She\u2019s \u201cSo gross ker\nfaxen\u201d means \u201cShe grew so tall and she\u2019s so dumb.\u201d You know, like that\u2019s what he said. I\nwanted to laugh, but I really, believe me I was telling myself that I was the most clever\ngirl. I got the best job. I got the cleaning. So, I was reading all his - since I didn\u2019t know\nGerman well enough. So, he didn\u2019t clean the desk. He was leaving the papers. I read all\nthe papers because, if I was very careful, I could just pretend that I\u2019m cleaning the table\nand read the papers. I listened to the German broadcast, because the radio was on. I\ncouldn\u2019t understand, so he was - he got himself the best cleaner. We weren\u2019t there too\nlong, but during that time...",
        "A: That\u2019s what it is - I read all the orders. I knew that the war is being lost. I knew - I read\nall those - the letters that he gathered. That\u2019s how we ran away. Renia was cleaning\nanother room. I would go back to Krysia - how she fed us. She was marvelous, but I\u2019ll go\nback to this portion. I\u2019Il just talk now about this situation here. So, I read everything and\nthen, the Russians were already so close that he got orders that on such and such a date to\nlet everybody go except the guards, because they weren\u2019t sending the Jews anymore to\nwork, because they had to go out of the camp. So, that - we had the - like, we were Poles,\nbut we took off our triangles because then the people that work outside had white crosses\nacross the back with the paint. Like, whatever - if you worked outside, you had the white\ncross painted like this right across the back. So, Krysia and I, we came to a conclusion\nthat she works in the kitchen, she gets some flour and water, and she\u2019|l be able to make\nthe crosses, new crosses, on our clothes, because we - we had clothes there. We were also\ndistributed some clothes for us because it was a small camp. It wasn\u2019t a big camp. We\nwere all girls. And this, we decided that we are going to run away, but we had to have a\nstrategy. We had a Jewish girl from Lublin. She was blonde and had blue eyes, and she\nspoke perfect German. She was one of us working in the barracks because there were\neither ten or twelve of us working the barracks. I don\u2019t remember. Since she could speak\nso well German, we decided that she\u2019s going to steal the kapo\u2019s - you know, kapos were\nwearing a black cape, a black cape what covered whatever - they didn\u2019t wear uniforms,\njust a black cape with a hood. So, she stole this hood from her, and then Krysia - we\ndecided that what we can do to take the crosses off, all we had to do is this, is to just\ncrumbled the - like we had to wear the crosses inside, but in order to get outside, to run\naway from camp - I knew exactly because my boss didn\u2019t come to work that day. I don\u2019t\nknow whether he came later or so, because it was ten days before the end of the war - ten\nor twelve days before the end of the war. So, in the morning, we got up this Helena was\nher name - she put on the cape, we made sure that there was no sign of the cross, and she\n- we came to the gate. She told the post that she registers with him ten people going to\nwork outside, whatever - she knew what to say, where outside, and he says - he showed\nus to go. We went to the road, and all - from there on, we didn\u2019t have to worry because\nall the Germans were running towards west. They were afraid. The Russians were very\nclose, so the Germans were leaving their homes and everything marching, running away\nfrom the Russians. They were afraid. So, we were in the group. Nobody noticed us.\nNobody bothered us, but we didn\u2019t have what to eat and we didn\u2019t know what to do. But,\nwe tun away. We\u2019re out of the camp. As a matter of fact, one girl from Radom that I\nsuggested that she goes with us, she didn\u2019t want to go because she had - somebody gave\nher spreads - some sardines, a box of sardines. She had it with someone. She didn\u2019t want\nto leave it, or she didn\u2019t - she didn\u2019t want to give it to her, and she didn\u2019t want - because\nshe wanted to eat it, she didn\u2019t want to run away. So, they went to another camp from\nthere, you know, after - the Russians were - they must have gotten orders to go more\nwest, but we were already free. So, we - that was it. Those were the camps. Now, Krysia -\nshe worked in the kitchen so, she stuck, you know, she cooked and she - she was sending\nto us - she was working on the second floor and so, we - we used to go under - stand\nunder the kitchen and have our metal thing with the handle. She would push down a\nstring. We would put the string on the handle. She roped it, and she would take - because\nthere was meat, like horse meat, but we didn\u2019t get it; the Germans - the Germans got it.\nWe only got the soup. So, she would take a tongue or whatever, you know, she had there\na big piece - a big piece of meat she would send it back. We would take it and divide\namong all the girls. So, everybody had something, not only something to eat, but we were\nnot used to such - so rich food. It was tremendous. One day she tells me this story. She\nworked there. She stole a pound of butter. It was, you know, one of those pounds in foil,\nand she says she didn\u2019t know what to do with it because, I mean, the Germans was - her\nboss, the German cook, was watching her. So, she put it in her pants so that she could\ntake the butter to take to us, and when she started working and cleaning up, the butter\nstarted dripping, and she got so scared she almost died. She - but anyway, she managed\nsomehow to bring the butter - the butter to feed us. So, we really in Retzow we didn\u2019t\nhave a bad day, because she was supplying all the food. She was stealing it, but she was\nsupplying all the food and nobody - all the girls that knew, they noticed that I went out to\nget whatever, they were already waiting. I mean everybody was hungry. So, that was also\nlucky. We were lucky there. But, this is all about Retzow. There\u2019s very - we don\u2019t have\nmuch to say about it because we weren\u2019t there too long.",
        "A: Right away. Right away. We walked with the Germans. We went that way, but we\ndecided to...",
        "A: We did. We did, but we were far away from home. We didn\u2019t know where we were\ngoing. We decided to - we decided to stop going west because we were going - by going\nwest we\u2019re getting too far away from home, and we - and we - we heard already Russians\nspeaking. So, we decided to get off the road, and just managed to go back - to walk back,\nbut we were afraid because this way where we were going west, nobody could - nobody\nwas suspecting us of running away from camp. We\u2019re running away to the west where all\nthe Germans, you know, with all their possible treasures that they had. They had horse\nand wagons and stuff like that, and they were all going west running away from the\nRussians, but then at one point, we decided, all ten of us, we had one Russian girl, not\nJewish, with us, too. Most of the girls were Jewish. Helena was also Jewish, but she\ndidn\u2019t look it. She spoke perfect German. She could get away with being German just in\ncase if something would happen, and we got off the road and we started going through\nthis forest. We started going back home. Back home! We were far away from home, but\nback to the east.",
        "A: That would be great. Thank you.",
        "A: I thank you very much. I really thank you for your consideration and for being so delicate\nwith me, because I was always afraid of this - not afraid for, I was always - I felt that my\nbody, I mean, I\u2019m not healthy enough to take - to think about Holocaust for so many, you\nknow, hours at times because \u2019til now I was not successful in not suffering afterwards,\nbut really it was so nice of you. I feel good, and I\u2019m glad I give you this interview.",
