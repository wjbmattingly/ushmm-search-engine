        "A: My name is Leon Merrick. I was born in Zgierz, Poland. Spelled Z-g-i-e-r-z. It\u2019s near Lodz,\nabout four miles from Lodz. I was born January 8, 1926. I had my mother and father who were\nliving in the same city as Zgierz. I had a younger brother, his name was Motl. He was three\nyounger. I was attending school in Zgierz when the war broke out September 1, 1939. I think I\nwas 13 years old.",
        "Q: Can I ask -- let me stop you for just a second and ask you a little bit about your early life; before\nthe war? And about -- can you tell me some things about the town? Was it a large town?",
        "A: Okay. Zgierz was a town, excuse me a minute you\u2019re going to edit it later, right? Is that what it\nis?",
        "Q: No, we won\u2019t edit it. It'll be just like this.",
        "A: All right. The town was, Zgierz, I think it was about, 129,000 people, was about 5,000 Jews.\nWas mostly textile, the people were engaged in textile.",
        "Q: Was that area of Poland a big textile area?",
        "A: Yes, because Lodz was the biggest textile area in Poland. Zgierz was only about eleven\nkilometers away. This is roughly about five, six miles.",
        "Q: When did you start going to school?",
        "A: I think I started school in 1932.",
        "Q: So you would have been, how old? Seven or eight years old?",
        "A: I think seven years old. This is when primary school started.",
        "Q: Was it a public or a private school?",
        "A: It was a public school.",
        "Q: Did you also go to like a Hebrew school or a Jewish school?",
        "A: Yes, I was going to a Jewish school in the afternoons because the public school was up to, let\u2019s\nsay about one, two o\u2019clock. After this about once a week, or twice a week we had to go to\nHebrew and learn about Hebrew. We also had one hour of religious school in the public school.",
        "Q: Oh, so you had one hour of religious training in the public school?",
        "A: In public school, right.",
        "Q: What exactly, do you remember the things that you studied in the Jewish school??",
        "A: Basic religion, you know, it was a basic course, about the holiday and things like that.",
        "Q: Was it very far from the public school or---?",
        "A: No, it was in the same class.",
        "Q: Oh, it was in the same class?",
        "A: It was in the same school. We just had I think, all Jewish pupils, boys and girls. But we had a\nsprinkling of gentiles, they excused themselves. So the same thing, it was a Catholic class. The\nCatholics had one hour of public school too. So they excused the Jewish kids.",
        "Q: Do you remember any instances of anti-Semitism when you were growing up?",
        "A: Well, like I just mentioned, most of the teachers were Jewish. A few of them were Poles. The\nhead of the school, he was a Pole. As a matter of fact, he had the same last name like I have and\nhe was a Pole. I just remember one Catholic boy was going to our school, to our class because\nhe was persecuted in the old gentile school because his father was a communist and things like\nthis. So he couldn\u2019t attend school over there, he came to our school.",
        "Q: Do you remember like any instances of kids getting beat up because they were Jewish?",
        "A: Sure, all the time. As a matter of fact, it happened to me too. On my street, there were not many\nJews living so when I came home from school or from any other place, I saw a couple of\nroughnecks in the street, I know they going to be after me, I was waiting for a grown up person\nwho was going to pass by my house or maybe to the same apartment building so I can go with\nhim. I would be protected, more or less.",
        "Q: This happened often or---?",
        "A: Yes, quite often.",
        "Q: Do you remember which street you lived on, the name of the street when you were young?",
        "A: Yes. It\u2019s a long name, I could spell it. The name of the street is named after a city nearby\nbecause it led like--Rockville Pike to Rockville. The name of the city was Konstatynowska, K-\nO-n-s-t-a-t-y-n-o-w-s-k-a, no. 15. I t was a wooden frame house. There were four families\nliving in the same house. We were living like on the courtyard. The European houses have\ncourtyards., I mean apartment buildings have courtyards.",
        "Q: Tell me, what did your father do for a living?",
        "A: My father worked, he was---he worked in a factory. Like I mentioned, there was a textile\ncenter. He was--sometimes he was going on a truck. They had a truck and they also had horses\nand carts. They were going to the nearby city of Lodz and they were picking out raw materials\nfrom the factories that came out from the machines. He worked 1n a finishing factory. They\nbrought it back to the factory and they dyed the material and they took out all this floss and they\nprepared it for the stores -- to be ready to go to the stores and to work. Here you go in, you buy\na ready-made suit. But in Europe ,especially 50 years ago, you went to a store first and you\nbought the material. Then you had to look for a tailor. So when they finished the material, the\nmaterial went to the stores. The people went in and said I need material for a suit. Man rolled\nit open, says, how much do you need? He brought the measurements to the tailor. The tailor\ntold him how much he\u2019s going to need. He took the scissors, he cut it off, he took it to the tailor\nand he made the suit.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what your father did, getting the finishing of the textiles?",
        "A: Yes. He bought the material. He didn\u2019t finish it by himself. He just collected all the materials\nfrom the nearby city.",
        "Q: Did he have a buyer or something?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t a buyer because he wasn\u2019t buying it. He was collecting it for the factory like you\nbuy a salesman. He brings in the material to be finished up.",
        "Q: Your mother, she was a housewife?",
        "A: My mother was a housewife. In the younger years, she worked but like we were getting older,\nwe were growing up, she took additional work. She was working with wool in a factory too,\nspinning wool for the material. It was a textile center, everybody was working 1n the factory.",
        "Q: Were there any -- like Jewish or any youth organizations?",
        "A: Yes, many.",
        "Q: Were you involved in any of them?",
        "A: Yeah, I was still young. At that age, I really didn\u2019t know exactly what organizations means. I\nwas 13 years old when the war broke out but I belonged to a couple of organizations, just to get\ntogether to meet people.",
        "Q: What did you do in these organizations?",
        "A: We sing Hebrew songs, talking about Palestine at that time. Everybody was dreaming of going\nto Palestine one day because Jews were always at the mercy of the Poles. They always felt like\nsecond -class citizens. In this country we refer like \u2018we\u2019. In Poland you refer \u2018they\u2019. You felt\nlike an outsider, like you were not part of the process and things like that. So it\u2019s different.\nThey had a quota, they had a quota in school, they had a quota in the military. A Jew couldn\u2019t\nbe a high official in the government. Maybe from the Jewish district, he was elected, a\nrepresentative, but that\u2019s about--he couldn\u2019t be a high official, appointed. He couldn\u2019t--they\ndidn\u2019t take any Jews.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you tell me a little bit about when the war broke out?",
        "A: Okay, I remember exactly when the war broke out, September 1, 1939. I remember it was a\nFriday. I think my mother went to the market. Friday was market day, especially with the\nJewish people. They went to buy the stuff for the Sabbath. There wasn\u2019t like a grocery store.\nYou went to open market and you came back in the morning. It was eight, nine o\u2019clock; the\nweather was crisp; everybody was talking about the war. I looked up the sky and I saw these\nplanes with the top that time because the war hysteria was going already a week or two weeks\nbefore mobilization, talk about the Germans and things like this. On Friday, nothing happened\nto our city. The planes flew over in the morning. They were just like birds up in the sky, the\nsun was shining. Saturday, the planes came back again and the Poles were shooting up. You\ncould see the tracer bullets, you don\u2019t know if you hit them or not. The planes flew right over,\nflew higher, nothing reached them. But Sunday, they flew very low. They came very low over\nthe city and you could even see the pilot inside, very, very low. The city was in a panic.\nEverybody was going towards Warsaw. The Poles appealed to the populations, to able- bodied\nmen, to go toward Warsaw. We\u2019re going make a defense line over there, a stand. My father left\ntoo. I remember we marched all night, 54 left Zgierz, we left for the city. We went to a nearby\nvillage. I don\u2019t remember how many miles, maybe ten miles, 15 was a village. Everybody was\njust like -- refugees. We took a few possessions, a little bit of bread. At night, we got very\nscared because the Poles opened all the prisons and they let out all the inmates. I don\u2019t know if\nthey were political inmates or criminal inmates but you see a lot of people, they look like\nhoodlums with shaved heads. That night, my father left. He went toward Warsaw.",
        "Q: So all of you left together to go to the next town?",
        "A: To the next village. We went there overnight. But the next morning, my father left -- he was\njust -- toward Warsaw -- I don\u2019t know. Because the Poles --. At that time, everything was\ndisorganized already. It didn\u2019t take long for the Poles to get disorganized already. It didn\u2019t take\nlong for the Poles to get disorganized. They didn\u2019t send you a summons, you have to report.\nThey just broadcast, by word of mouth that all able bodied men who had served in the Polish\narmy at one time or another had to report towards Warsaw. They named the city Lovitz or\nsomething, we\u2019re going to make there a defense. Me and my brother and my mother were left\nalone. We figured well, we cannot defend ourselves. We have no clothes, nothing; we just left\nin a hurry. We went back towards Zgierz, our city. On the way, we encountered the Polish\narmy coming back, disorganized, disheveled with horses with wagons, some on foot. I didn\u2019t\nsee any mechanized unit, none whatsoever. We came back to our home and the neighbors said\nthey were glad to see us back, even though they were Poles. They gave us milk and bread and\nthings like that. I wasn\u2019t there maybe one hour or two, I heard shooting. My neighbor who was\na man, he didn\u2019t run away because he owned a farm nearby. He said the Germans are coming.\nHe probably got wind of it before. We were into like a shelter. I don\u2019t know if it was a shelter\nor maybe an empty cellar, I don\u2019t know. We were there for a few hours, we heard shooting, then\nwe came out and the Germans were here. The next morning, we went outside and we saw\nstrange uniforms, not like the Polish army. We saw a lot of looting, knocking off the stores,\neverything was in disarray. We see whole columns of Germans going towards Warsaw. They\nwere passing our town because Warsaw was north of where we were living",
        "Q: Were there any --? Let\u2019s see, you said that this would have happened the first time you saw the\nGermans, like Tuesday or Wednesday?",
        "A: I don\u2019t have any perception of time but it was January the 8\", I mean September the 1\u00b0\u2018, the war\nbroke out. I think this was about January 6\". Now I\u2019m reading the stories where the Germans\ncame into Lodz and I see January 6. Being we were just about four kilometers four or five\naway from Lodz, this was about six days or so. It didn\u2019t take long to come up north.",
        "Q: Were there any -- when the Germans came did they --? You said, you talked about the looting,\nthe looting of the stores and things like that? Did they also loot houses?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t see any houses, mostly I see, I\u2019m saying about Germans looting\nhouses. The populations looting houses.",
        "Q: The Poles also?",
        "A: I have to correct myself. The Poles were looting houses.",
        "Q: So the Germans weren\u2019t doing it?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see any Germans looting houses. They were looting houses and stores, we\u2019re talking\nabout.",
        "Q: Did the Germans impose any restrictions on Jews?",
        "A: Well, okay, I\u2019m going to get to this right now. I\u2019m at this part.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, okay.",
        "A: So after a day or so, after occupation, my father came back. He didn\u2019t go to Warsaw, he didn\u2019t\ngo to Warsaw.",
        "Q: He never made it up there?",
        "A: He never made it up there. He decided to come back. He decided to come back so after a\ncouple of days he was home, he decided to go back to the factory where he was. He went back\nto the factory. The factory was not in operation. They put a German commissar in the factory\nbecause it was a Jewish enterprise, was owned by Jews but only Poles were working except my\nfather and my grandfather. They were the only two people working in the factory. He was\nthere maybe for a week or so.",
        "Q: They were allowed to work as they were before?",
        "A: No, well, the factory wasn\u2019t in production, don\u2019t forget. They were just sorting things out.\nNobody came to work. They were just straightening materials out and things like this. No\npayroll, nothing. He just wanted to hold on to it because there was nothing else to do. He went\nback to the factory. I don\u2019t think he even got paid for it. They had a German commissar and\nthe German commissar moved; he was a local German, he moved into the quarters where the\nformer people who worked in the office used to live. They kicked them out. After a week or\nso, they dismissed him because he was a Jew. He wasn\u2019t allowed to work. Then one day, I\ndon\u2019t have a perception of time, maybe it was three weeks or four weeks, according to the book\nthat I read now, it didn\u2019t take long, maybe mostly five, six weeks, they said all the Jews have to\nreport to the market square.",
        "Q: This is the same market where your mom used to shop?",
        "A: Yeah. So we all reported to the market square and we were all Jews. I remember we debating\nto take my younger brother with us or not. I don\u2019t think we took him, we left him with our\nneighbors, they were Poles. We went to the market square and maybe we stood there for three,\nfour hours. Anyway, somebody came out and made an announcement, talking about the\nGermans if I say somebody. They gave us three days to leave the city. A lot of people were\nliving up north towards Warsaw, a lot of people -- we left for Lodz to live, for L-o-d-z because\nmy mother had a sister that was there.",
        "Q: So it was just you and your mother and your father?",
        "A: And my brother.",
        "Q: Your brother was coming too?",
        "A: Yeah, we left him with the Poles when we went to the market square but then they let us go.\nThey gave us three days to leave the city. So we assembled everything and we left to Lodz. At\nthat time, we know already they\u2019re going to have a ghetto in Lodz. This was in September. It\nwasn\u2019t before. The Germans came in in September and maybe we left 1n October, November, I\ndon\u2019t remember. Wasn\u2019t even snow on the ground yet because we rented a horse and buggy. It\nwas only about 10, 11 kilometers away. We piled up our few possessions, we took our\nfurniture, we took it into our neighbors, to the gentiles because we figure if the war is going to\nbe over -- everybody was talking about England and France going to join the war, the war\u2019s not\ngoing to last long.",
        "Q: Is that the perception that most people had?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Maybe three, four weeks, five weeks the most. The British, the war\u2019s going to be\nover. We can go back and claim our furniture and our possessions. We took it in for\nsafekeeping. We knew there\u2019s going to be a ghetto. We moved in with my aunt, with a few\npossessions. We were there maybe a week or two weeks but my father was working with\nsomebody -- he was in the office. When I mentioned it that there were two Jews working in the\nfactory, I was talking about two Jews like working people. But in the office, there were a few\nmore Jewish people working over there. One of the Jews, he was really from Lodz, he worked\nat Zgierz and he was commuting because he came with the tramway every morning. We find\nout that he has a lot of-- he knew a lot of people, he\u2019s got a lot of pull. My father went to him\nand asked him if he can help us out; we need some quarters where to live. He sure did. We got\nthat room because apartments were very scarce. They put in the Jews from the city of Lodz\nitself, from all the environs. They put them in a small section and it was the worst section, the\nmost dilapidated section in the city. They assigned us a Jewish quarter. We had one room, just\none room. It served as a kitchen and everything, just one room for four people. Then -- that\nwas in -- yeah, also for the refugees who came from the environs, they opened public kitchens.\nThis was all in the fall of 1939. I even remember the next Passover which was the next spring\nlike April now, was still the public kitchens, we eat in the public kitchens because we were\nrefugees. Then they close the ghetto. May 1\u201c they close the Lodz ghetto.",
        "Q: In 1940\u201d?",
        "A: In 1940.",
        "Q: Let me ask you, can we go back a little bit? When you left for Lodz, I know that in the middle\nof September, the Soviets and the Germans split Poland. You were on the German side?",
        "A: I was on the German side.",
        "Q: Was there any -- did you know people who tried to run to the Russian side?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Did your parents ever think about trying to do that?",
        "A: My parents were thinking like that. My father had a younger brother. He was a shoemaker by\ntrade and he was much younger. He was unmarried and he went to the Russian side. We also\nheard tales that people came back from the Russian side. My wife, she was living on the\nRussian side. We heard that people have no place to live and they slept in synagogues and there\nwere hungers going around. A lot got caught by the Germans. A lot of people did come back\nbut I guess my parents didn\u2019t have the guts, we didn\u2019t have the nerve and we didn\u2019t have the\nmoney. You had to bribe a lot, 1t cost money for transportation to go even there too. We didn\u2019t\ngo but my uncle did go.",
        "Q: Because he was unattached?",
        "A: He was unattached, he was single. We never heard from him, we never heard from again. I\nnever know what happened, if he vanished, if he survived the war or not. Now, being as you\nbrought my memory back, my father had a younger brother. Also he had another brother, he\nwent towards Warsaw. When they said all able-bodied men had to come and he got killed near\nWarsaw. He did join a unit in the fighting and we never heard from him again. Somebody seen\nhim and he says he got killed. His widow was living in the ghetto.",
        "Q: What was his name, do you remember?",
        "A: I think Schomik, Schomolos, something like that.",
        "Q: Your father\u2019s younger brother?",
        "A: Yeah, but he was married.",
        "Q: Let me ask you, you talked about the ghetto and you said that it was closed in May 1, 1940?",
        "A: May I, 1940.",
        "Q: You said it was in a dilapidated area of the city. Can you tell me, describe it a little bit, how big\nit was? Was it surrounded by a wall?",
        "A: Okay. They closed the ghetto. My father got a job because we had to live. I mean nobody\ngave anything for nothing. Like I mentioned, this guy, he worked before, he helped us with the\napartment, he also became head of one of the hospitals. They had three hospitals -- first of all\nwhen they closed the ghetto, they had 160,000 Jews. That\u2019s a lot of people. The ghetto was\ncomposed of two sections. In other words, through the main street, the tramway was going.\nThe tramway was going through the ghetto and they had a bridge. The Jews had to cross the\nbridge.",
        "Q: Yes, I\u2019ve seen a picture of the ghetto.",
        "A: If I want to go from one side of the ghetto to the other side, I couldn\u2019t go directly, I couldn\u2019t\ncross the road. They also had a few gates where the horse and buggy traffic went through.\nPedestrians could go through too. The Germans guards there and they open the gate like five\nminutes or so. Let\u2019s say 25 people assembled, 50 people and there were no more traffic\ncoming to the main street because there was barbed wire on both sides; they let the people\nthrough. I\u2019m going to give you, I have the book and a picture. I\u2019m going to give you a clear\npicture of what this thing looked like. I had to go on the other side. My father got a job in the\nhospital.",
        "Q: Which was on the other side?",
        "A: It was on one side, it was on the main side. My aunt was living on the other side. Some of us\nwas commuting, I had friends. At that time in 1940, 1t wasn\u2019t so bad. They still got-- you still\ncouldn\u2019t go out. They were sentries posted shoot to kill; there was barbed wire around day and\nnight and nobody could get in. One section of the ghetto, the cemetery was adjoining it. There\nwas a lot of black market going on and you still could buy food but then times were getting bad.\nThen the Germans requested people for a settlement; it was getting crowded. They brought\nmore people in from the surrounding vicinities from smaller towns. They were liquidating the\nghetto and then they were coming into the Lodz ghetto. As soon as the ghetto got crowded,\nnow I\u2019m reading the books, I know how it was. At that time they were opening the camp in\nKaldum, Humhof, the extermination camp. They had to feed the camp, the factories.\nOstensibly, they were taking -- they were taking some people out for work too, on road crews,\nhealthy men. But they were also taking out people who were sick. They sent to different\ncamps.",
        "Q: You were talking about passing from one part of the ghetto to the other. Did you need a pass to\ndo that or just ---?",
        "A: No, no. They had a bridge, we didn\u2019t need a -- we just claimed a bridge. I didn\u2019t go outside the\nghetto, we just crossed the bridge. If I didn\u2019t want to cross to the bridge, I could wait near the\ngate. Like I mentioned, when no traffic, after 25, 30 people assembled and people assembled\nother side; there are two guards. The German guards now, they open the gates and you were let\nthrough, pedestrian traffic basically. But I think they only had about two or three bridges for\ncrossing, I\u2019m going to show you the picture later on. I gave a map of the ghetto too.",
        "Q: You do?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was it \u2014 can you tell me like approximately what size the ghetto was? Like maybe four or five\nsquare blocks or something like that?",
        "A: No, it was more that that, more than that.",
        "Q: More than that?",
        "A: It was -- 1f you want to stop this, I can go get the book, maybe they have a scale there. Could\nyou stop there for a minute, I'll be right back. Was in Lynoska N-l-y and Dolna, D-o-l-n-a.\nThis is the relationship, this is the city of Lodz. See here. This is how the ghetto was in\nrelationship to the city. Here was the Jewish cemetery, see it? Now, here is the tramway was\ngoing up. It says Zgierz, 1t was named. This is the Zgierz where I was born. Here was barbed\nwire, just a tramway which is coming through. Here 1s a picture -- I\u2019m going to show you a\npicture what the bridge looked like. Here it 1s, 1t\u2019s a wooden bridge. Here the tram is coming,\nwe went on the bridge to one side to the other.",
        "Q: That\u2019s just so that the Jews, according to the Germans, wouldn\u2019t associate with the Aryan\ngroups? Is that what it was?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, right, right. This was a wooden bridge. They had three bridges like that in\ndifferent sections. They had the tramway where we went by. When the tramway came through,\nthe windows were closed. They know with the doors and the windows were locked. I mean the\nGermans locked them in. It didn\u2019t take long to go through the ghetto, maybe in one or two\nminutes. It was very small, they just whizzed by. Now I\u2019m going to show you the Gypsy camp\ntoo. I have a book. I remember this. I remember this guy, a German. A Gypsy camp red,\nmaybe the no, it was very -- dying like fish and Rita says English were dying. Was\nvery few \u2014 Take a look, this is excrement they were carrying. Fifty years ago in Poland the\nworst section of town. They had no toilets or flushing water or things like that.",
        "Q: All Jews were made to wear the yellow star too",
        "A: Right, right. Here was the eldest of the Jews, this guy. Well, you read the books, the Jews were\n\u2014 160,000 Jews and some of them got and then they brought in some Jews from\nGermany, from Austria, from Luxembourg. That\u2019s what the guy looks like. He was visiting the\nWarsaw ghetto. I guess they went from one place to another. Here\u2019s what they do with the\nsettlements. Are you familiar with all this pictures, aren\u2019t you?",
        "Q: I\u2019ve seen some of them, yes. These are the gates of the ghetto here?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s the gate, that\u2019s the gate. Assembled here and then they let you through. In\nsome places, they had a bridge. When they had a bridge, there\u2019s no gate. There were not many.\nHere the sign says that Jews\u2019 living quarters, no entry, thing like that.",
        "Q: Was it relatively -- did people go out of the ghetto illegally sometimes?",
        "A: Yes, they did.",
        "Q: People trying to get food and things like that?",
        "A: Yeah, people got killed too there, shot too. Yeah, I remember, sure they got -- but not many.\nThe Lodz ghetto wasn\u2019t like the Warsaw ghetto. It was not smuggling going on. Warsaw was a\nbigger city and a lot of Jews, not a lot, some Jews were living on the Aryan side but not in the\nLodz ghetto because the population was so small. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to run. There\nwas nobody on the other side waiting for you, to receive you or to guide you or to take you\nsome place and hide you. You couldn\u2019t go no place.",
        "Q: I\u2019ve interviewed other people who said that they were more frightened of the Poles than they\nwere of the Germans because they said --.",
        "A: Yeah, the Poles because you have no chance.",
        "Q: They said that the Germans only knew from propaganda who was a Jew. Whereas the Poles\nhad lived with them and knew exactly who they were. So they were more frightened.",
        "A: Even the bread lines before they closed the ghetto. Like if you find out like a Polish baker\nbread, we went in line, the Poles spotted a Jew, they pointed out to the Germans and throw him\nout. They said yes, there\u2019ll going to one Jew less in the line, they\u2019re going to get an extra loaf\nof bread. This is why all the concentration camps -- I should correct myself -- the extermination\ncamps were in Polish and the Slavic soil like in the Ukraine, in Russia and Poland. Because the\nlocal population was hostile and they couldn\u2019t do it. They couldn\u2019t do this in France and\nBelgium or Holland because enough of the population would help us, or at least there would be\nan outcry about it and things like that",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see. They closed the ghetto in May of \u201940.",
        "A: Nineteen forty, right. May the 1\u00b0.",
        "Q: What was your father doing? You said he was working?",
        "A: He was working 1n the hospital.",
        "Q: He worked in the hospital?",
        "A: He worked in the hospital.",
        "Q: Did you work or were you not working?",
        "A: Yeah, I was working too.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: Well, I tell you, it\u2019s like that. Everybody had to work. I was young like I said when the war\nbroke out, I was thirteen. When I went into the ghetto, I was fourteen, maybe fourteen and a\nhalf. What can a young boy like me do? There was no schooling ,nothing. But I noticed that\nthey had a lot in the ghetto. Like I said, the ghetto was self- administered. They had more or\nless autonomy. From the beginning, the Germans didn\u2019t mix in, they just outside. They figured\nwhy should a German mix in if the Jews themselves can do the job for them? I seen a lot of\nboys. They were like mailmen. They were -- not mailmen -- like they were carrying mail from\none department to another.",
        "Q: Like couriers or something?",
        "A: Yeah, they were highly organized in the ghetto. They had the statistical offices and they had\nmarriage bureaus. They had archives, they had three, four hospitals, they had orphanages.\nNow, I\u2019m talking from the beginning, I\u2019m talking about 1940. I told my father if he can find out\nif I can get a job like this. He knew somebody and we wrote a letter like a petition. He gave it\nto somebody and then I got a response. I got a response for an interview. I came to the office\nand there was a young girl over there and she asked me if I have the strong feet. I says yes so I\ngot the job. The job was good. I don\u2019t remember if I got paid or not but I remember that I got\ntwo soups a day. At that time, you only worked for the food, you didn\u2019t work for pay. I might\nhave got some money too, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: So you were one of the se couriers?",
        "A: Yeah, I was one of the couriers. I was attached to the post office, the main office. From the\nbeginning, then I mentioned, from the beginning before the hostilities between Germany and\nRussia, I\u2019m talking 1940, a lot of Jews in the ghetto were still receiving packages from relatives\nfrom the Russian side. At that time, everything was nice and dandy. We had a post office, we\nhad packages, everything was functioning normally, like this. The Germans, at that time, in\n1940, beginning of \u201941, they didn\u2019t quite decide to exterminate the Jews yet. They put them in\nghettos, they concentrate them in centers but I think the Wannsee started a little bit later on, in\n1942. So that time we still received packages and mail and Jews came from Prague, from\nGermany. They had relatives; there were mixed marriages and mixed partners maybe who\ndidn\u2019t come to the ghetto and they sent packages. It was like a post office, everything was\nfunctioning normally, it wasn\u2019t quite bad. You still could get a lot of stuff on the black market,\nlike food and things like that.",
        "Q: Were people, at this point early on, were they apprehensive, were they scared that --?\nObviously the people who left the ghetto or were probably shot, they were frightened by that,\ndid people realize what it was pointing toward? That maybe they might be exterminated? You\nknow what I mean?",
        "A: Well, I tell you, I\u2019m going to give this now. I don\u2019t remember exactly when but it was quite\nearly, maybe 1942, we heard a rumor that the Lodz ghetto was sealed. Some newspapers were\ngetting through. You could hear some undergrounds, maybe German newspapers, some were\ngetting through. Because don\u2019t forget maybe they throwing through the gate, houses adjoining,\njust like the wall in Berlin. One side was west, one side was east. Somehow news filtered\nthrough. Don\u2019t ask me why, I was young, I was fourteen, fifteen years old but I heard early on,\nmaybe 1942, there\u2019s such a thing that the Germans said they\u2019re going in the shower and instead\nof water, gas comes in. We heard that but nobody believed but we heard it down.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you remember that was striking about the ghetto?",
        "A: From the beginning when somebody died, they had a regular hearse. They didn\u2019t have a motor\nhearse like here but they had horses but then the situation got bad. People were dying from\nhunger and there were too many of them; they just had flatbeds with horses. There were too\nmany, they just piled them up. Like I said, I was like a courier, I was in touch with the post\noffice and everything comes in the mail. Especially they have people, the people, you suffered\nmore than the local, the people who got settled into ghetto like from Germany, from Prague,\nfrom Vienna. The Jews from the west, they didn\u2019t come from a ghetto, they came straight from\ntheir homes. They took just a few belongings, they came to the ghetto, they put them into a\nhostile environment. They had nothing in common with the eastern Jews, with the locals and\nwas wintertime. There was no heating, no fuels, when you came to the houses, you knock on\nthe door, like you had something, a summons for them to report for a settlement or something,\nyou had to go they were all laying in the beds -- were hunger -- they were dying with hunger,\nvery bad. Then we heard about the Gypsies, they were building a Gypsy camp, I remember\nvery well.",
        "Q: About what time was that when the Gypsies came, do you remember?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the exact date but maybe it was in the book here. But I have no perception of\ntime, don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s been fifty years. But I remember exactly where the place was and they\ndidn\u2019t last long. I could see, in other words, they get . The ghetto wasn\u2019t getting\nmuch food from the Germans outside. But the Gypsies were getting the food from the ghetto.\nCan you imagine how the situation was? There was the Germans -- the German criminal police\nwas in the ghetto. They had a building in the ghetto. They dealt mostly with the Jews were\ninformed by other Jews where was hidden wealth and things like that. Sometimes it was true\nand sometimes it was untrue. They saw them then, they thought maybe -- valuables outside the\nghetto, they had to show them where it was, maybe in the ghetto. They killed them, they\ntortured them, they couldn\u2019t get anything out of them because the man didn\u2019t have it.",
        "Q: What was your mother and your younger brother doing?",
        "A: Well, my mother, like later on everybody had to work so she was working in a kitchen, a\ncommunal kitchen, peeling potatoes and things like this. My younger brother, he was three\nyears younger that I was so if I was fourteen, fifteen, he was only twelve and a half, thirteen. I\nthink he worked in a metal factory. I don\u2019t know exactly what he was doing but everybody had\nto be employed.",
        "Q: They were employed mostly like you said, it was easier to get food that way?",
        "A: Yes, because you get food on your job, that\u2019s it. Because the rations were not enough. Like I\nhad two soups a day and maybe he got a soup a day. Everybody got a meager ration, had a\nration card but everybody got a bowl of soup by the place of work.",
        "Q: You talked about ration cards. To what did the ration cards entitle you to?",
        "A: Very, very little.",
        "Q: A piece of bread or something?",
        "A: A piece of bread, maybe two kilograms of potatoes. That sometimes have to last you for a week\nand sometimes have to. Sometimes they have to last you for three, four weeks. You could see\nthat the food came in the main gate. They had like an enclave. They had Germans working,\nJews working, and all the food came into this enclave, they processed it\nthrough. They came in with horses and buggies with Polish drivers. Then the Jewish drivers\ntook over. They took it into the ghetto. They unload the material and they brought the wagon\nwith the horses back. While they were going from the enclave out to the distribution corners to\ntake it, they had, they were guarded with Jewish police. They just had armbands, they didn\u2019t\nhave any guns. They were standing on the planks or going behind the wagon if a potato fell off,\nthey picked it up and put it back in the wagon and things like that. Potatoes came in and flour\ncame in and beets came and flour came. Don\u2019t forget, after all they had 160,000 Jews. The\nJews baked their own bread but to work in the bakery was a privilege. You had to know\nsomebody, because you were allowed to eat in the baker, your bellyful, all you can eat. If you\nwork in the kitchen, you could eat all you want. It was a privilege to work in the kitchen or to\nwork in a bakery.",
        "Q: So people were better off?",
        "A: Were better off because you had your regular rations plus you ate on the job.",
        "Q: You said something earlier about the underground, getting information about these possible\nthings from the underground. Was there pretty extensive underground?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know underground but I know from the beginning, in 1940, I mean the ghetto was really\nclosed but people had connections. Maybe they came through tunnels or maybe they came\nthrough the wires underneath or maybe Jews, they took out Jews for work from the ghetto every\nday from the beginning. They were demolishing houses around the ghetto because the Germans\nwant to build a no-man\u2019s-land around the ghetto. This was near the Jewish quarter and they\nfigure maybe the Jews have a lot of valuables hidden there. They just knocking down whole\nblocks of houses. Maybe outside, maybe they came in contact with Poles or something like\nthat. Maybe some news filtered through. I remembered you went to a barbershop or\nsomething, the latest gossip was exchanged there. Somehow the news filtered through.",
        "Q: How long were you in the ghetto?",
        "A: I was in the ghetto since they closed it off. I left the ghetto in March 10, 1944.",
        "Q: You were there from 1940 or you were there from 1939?",
        "A: The ghetto wasn\u2019t a ghetto then. There was this section but the ghetto was closed in 1940. I\nleft the ghetto in 1944 and my parents were still there. From the beginning I didn\u2019t want to go\nbut they said the Germans need people to work for the settlements. I was hiding and then they\nthreatened they going to take the ration cards away from my parents --.",
        "Q: If you didn\u2019t go?",
        "A: If I didn\u2019t go so eventually I had to report. We had to report --.",
        "Q: Had there been deportations before?",
        "A: Oh, yes, constantly.",
        "Q: Regularly?",
        "A: Back in 1942, the Germans put a curfew for one week, nobody could go out or in. The\nGermans are, they didn\u2019t left it up to the Jews then. The Germans themselves, they went to --.\n(End of Side A, Tape 1)\nThey took them to a central place ,a center point. From there they came in to trucks and now\nwe know what happens. They took them to the train station, put them on trucks and the Kelna,\nthe extermination was only 35 kilometers away. They took them right n and the trucks came\nback right away with curfew. One day, like I said my father worked in the hospital; the\nGermans came, they surrounded the hospital, took all the patients out.",
        "Q: Okay so you said that your father worked in a hospital and they came and took some of the\npatients, or all of them?",
        "A: All of them, all of them. They surrounded the hospital. I t was early in the morning, maybe\nfour o\u2019clock in the morning, they took all the patients out. Then they emptied, on the same day,\nthey emptied all the hospitals, three hospitals. There was a hospital for the insane, they emptied\nthat. They emptied orphanages and took all the kids out. I forgot to mention as my memory\ncomes back, my mother worked in the building, she worked in the orphanage. After this, once\nthey emptied the orphanage, she had no -- then she start working in the kitchen, got a job in the\nkitchen, public kitchen.",
        "Q: So they took these people away?",
        "A: Yeah, but nobody knew exactly where they took them. Then where the hospital was, the\nGermans made like a factory, a tailor shop or something.",
        "Q: Did they take them away in trains? Is that how they deported them, they just marched them out\n--\u2019",
        "A: No, they came by with trucks. At that time \u2014 now reading the books, we know that that was the\nEinsatzgruppen, the mobile killing units. At that time, they calling the road commander, they\nwere on wheels on big trucks, the road commanders, they come out and they took them by\ntrucks. When I mentioned it, the Germans put a curfew for a week, they took in, from block to\nblock, they took in with the wagons. They took them to an assembly point and then the\nGermans came and took them with trucks or they marched to the train station. Also I want to\nmention that near the cemetery is a section called Marishna near the ghetto, there was a\nsidetrack, a railroad track. They took them all to the settlements, went to this station.",
        "Q: By the cemetery?",
        "A: By the cemetery, was a big station nearby. The trains were there and they took them on the\nflatcars. That\u2019s where I left, from that station too.",
        "Q: You said that these things happened often? That there were deportations all the time?",
        "A: Constantly, constantly. Because they were bringing in new people, they were taking out and\nbringing in new people. Otherwise the ghetto would be a quarter of a million people. This way\nthey always emptied it, always empty it. From the beginning, it was up to the local\nadministration who should go. Because the Germans really didn\u2019t care. They said we need\n7,000 people for the settlement, we need 900,000, 50 hundred people so if some people came\nfrom Germany,, from Austria and they were strangers; they were not even resettled yet, they\nwere just living in a building, they just took them. They just need people, they just needed\nnumbers.",
        "Q: So they weren\u2019t concerned .",
        "A: Weren\u2019t concerned, right.",
        "Q: Did you ever hear of anybody who escaped or got away from some of these transports and came\nback and told what was going on or --?",
        "A: Well, I tell you. I didn\u2019t know any person that did escape but like I mentioned before, we knew\nin 1942, early on, that the people -- they take out a few from the ghetto and they tell you like\nyou\u2019re going to a shower and they give you soap and a towel. Instead of water, gas comes out.\nSomebody must have escaped, don\u2019t forget I was very young then and your mind didn\u2019t believe.\nI was fourteen, fifteen years old but I don\u2019t know who said it, but the news filtered through.",
        "Q: When you were deported, you had to leave your family?",
        "A: My family was there.",
        "Q: It was just you that was deported?",
        "A: Okay. The Jews --.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry. I know what I was going to ask. When people were deported, when people were\ntaken out of the ghetto, were they told where they were going or were they just told that they\nwere going to be resettled in the east?",
        "A: They told them they would settle in the east. The ghetto, like I said, was quite a large area and\nthey had like a central prison, the Jews. The people had assembled there, like I said, but some\npeople, they really went for work outside the ghetto. Because they had to go to a commission;\nthey had German doctors and they really needed them to work. But if they took everybody,\nwhole families, you know they didn\u2019t take these people to work. They just said you have to be\nresettled in the east. Like I said, I was hiding; then one day after maybe a week\u2019s time or so, I\nhad to report. So I was there for three, four days in the central prison. I remember my father\ncame the last days towards the barbed wire. I remember the picture just like vividly. I\nremember what he looked like. In Europe he was wearing boots and I remember his face like --\n. So we march, the next morning we march to the train station, we marched, all young people,\nno adult with us. Youngsters, I was there maybe sixteen, seventeen already. They put us in an\nopen cart, put us in one of the good wagons, cattle cars and they closed up. We were riding for\ntwo, three hours. All of a sudden, they open the door. There was a truck waiting there and the\nGermans waiting there. I don\u2019t remember how many people, maybe 50 people from our wagon,\nwhatever it was. Maybe 50, maybe 60, I didn\u2019t count them; they took us to a labor camp. It\nwas in Kielce. It was in southern Poland. It\u2019s spelled K-1-e-l-c-e. I don\u2019t know if you heard of\nit before. They took us over there and we asked how -- I seen them loading up our clothes, our\nbaggage. We had on the truck and then -- they had already a labor camp. That camp still had\nJews already from the surrounding vicinities. The camp was adjoining a factory. The factory\nwas called Hasac. It was a Polish munitions factory before the war or maybe it was just a metal\nfactory, I don\u2019t know. The Germans converted this to a munitions factory. Over there, in\ncomparison to the ghetto, was good because I had plenty food, as much as I want. The only\nthis, you came in contact with the Poles. You work in the factory besides with the Poles. So we\nwent to the barracks after finish the work but they went to their homes. They promised us that\nthey going to give us the clothes, I seen them loading the truck. We ask them, where is the\nclothes, we never got the clothes. I only had what I had on me.",
        "Q: What you came in?",
        "A: What I came on. I don\u2019t know who; I was told later on that the people who run the camp, the\nJews, they bartered away our clothes. This is what I was told, I never seen them.",
        "Q: The clothes that you\u2019re talking about were clothes that you had brought with you and they made\nyou give up when you got there?",
        "A: Yeah, I didn\u2019t have -- that\u2019s right. I seen them loading the truck but when I got to the camp, I\nnever see anything. I had an extra sweater, maybe an extra pants, an extra pair shoes. We were\nall probably gone for labor work so everybody took a little bit clothes. They never gave it to us.\nThis was good clothes because we took nothing but the best. I could barter this if I had it. I\nremember I just had one sweater, some I give it away and the Pole, the next day, brought me a\nloaf of bread or something like that. But food was relatively good because the locals, they were\nlocals in the adjoining cities and they probably came with all the clothes. They were bartering\nall the time so they didn\u2019t eat in the commune kitchen. Was always a lot of food. Then at night,\nI could go to the Polish kitchen if they had food left over, they gave us if I worked the night\nshift. In comparison to the ghetto, as far as food was concerned, was gold. I was always\nworried about what happened to my parents, everything seemed unreal. I got up in the\nmorning, everything strange. I worked in the factory; I was making bullets. We put in steel and\nthe machines, if you\u2019re working steel with the machines, had to have oil, constant to the oil.\nLike I said, I don\u2019t have any clothes to exchange nothing so got all over me and I\ndeveloped all blisters. I had all blisters on my knee, on my feet. Because I had no apron, just\nplain clothes and I had nothing to change. Don\u2019t forget I mentioned that I had left in March,\n1944 but then the weather was getting colder. I went out in the morning to work. They\nmarched us from the assembling, we had to march to factory. We didn\u2019t have to march too far,\njust like from here to the light because the camp was attached to the factory. But a cold day, it\nhit my flesh and it was hurting because I had blisters. When I was in that labor camp in Kielce,\nI heard about the invasion, the Normandy invasion in June 6. I heard that. But that time, I\nreally didn\u2019t know where Normandy was; I just heard that the Americans and the British was\nthere, I don\u2019t have any perception of time; maybe the camp, maybe two, three months. It was\nthe summer and then one morning, this camp, we were guarded by the Ukrainians. A Ukrainian\nauxiliary this camp. You mentioned if somebody escaped from the ghetto and I told you I\ndidn\u2019t know of anybody. But from the camp, I did heard that they escaped, from the labor\ncamp. But they caught him and then they brought him back and then they shot him. It was a\ndifferent part of the country, they did escape and they brought him back. This was still in the\nsummertime, after the Normandy invasion. It was in June, maybe July or maybe August, one\nmorning they lined us all up and they say they have to evacuate because the Russian made the\noffensive. They were coming westward so they evacuated us and they put us in open flatcars.\nWe were riding maybe a day or two and then they let us out in an open field. They gave us\nfood; the Germans were debating where they should take us. They didn\u2019t know what to do with\nus -- all the people from the labor camp. Was not a big camp, maybe six, seven hundred people.\nAs I mentioned before, only about 50, 60 people. They had the whole wagons left over but they\ndropped them off in different camps. This camp only attached this car, maybe away to another\ncouple cities, attached like a camp. They didn\u2019t know where to take us, we said why\ncan\u2019t we go back -- we still in Poland -- we said why can\u2019t you take us back to the Lodz ghetto?\nThere\u2019s a lot of Jews over there. One of the guys told us, the Lodz ghetto is being evacuated,\ndismantled now. Right now, we in the field, 1t was still warm, must have been in August. Now\naccording to the books that I read, that was when the ghetto was being liquidated, in July and\nAugust. After a couple of days, we decided and they took us to a place, Shedbush. We still in\nPoland, I find it on the map, wasn\u2019t far away, maybe 25 miles away. Anyway it was all\nyoungsters and we were digging ditches, anti-tank ditches. The organization Todd was in\ncharge, T-o-double-d. It was named after a German, it was a labor battalion or something like\nthat. We came, in the morning, in the daytime we went to dig the ditches and at night we were\nsleeping in barns, in farmers\u2019 barns. But at night, we heard shooting. In the morning we got up\nand we ask the German what is all the shooting? We heard the partisans, they were attacking\nthe German units or something like this in the countryside. So after we dig the ditches, I don\u2019t\nknow, maybe for a week or so, they took us away to Chintzerhau . The Chintz 1S\na -- | think it\u2019s near Upper Silesia -- it\u2019s a very well known Polish city. The Polish Madonna --\nChintz is on the Polish-German border not far away in Upper Silesia. The same\nfactory with the same work that I did in Kielce that I did in Chintz . Over there, I met\nmy friend. I met my friend which I still keep up to now; he is in New York.",
        "Q: What\u2019s his name?",
        "A: His name is -- well he changed his name. His name is now Herbert Lewis. He\u2019s got a better\nrecollection than I have. He remembers more than I do. Somehow my memory fades but he\u2019s\ngot a very good recollection and I met him. I remember the day; he was wearing boots. Over\nthere maybe you worked about maybe for a month or two, was all , 1944, remember.\nWe went in the morning --. He wasn\u2019t in Kielce with Gara; he was in a different camp. He was\nin Scarzilsco. By then, when the Germans came, they evacuated everybody and every able-\nbodied men they put in --. He came in Chintz and I met him. We were working in\nthe same factory. I don\u2019t know if we worked there for a month or six weeks. Anyway, it was\nstill the same year; the Germans came one morning, rounded us up and marched us to the train\nstation. They put us on cattle cars and I could see that the local population, they were running.\nWe heard distant shooting. I don\u2019t know, rumors spread in our ranks that the Russians are\nentering the city on the other side but it wasn\u2019t true yet. I could see the Germans were loading\nthe big guns on the trains, the German army. Anyway they put us on cattle cars. We were gone\nfor three or four days and we wind up in Germany. We find out that they took us \u2014 we went to\nBuchenwald in the concentration camp. Over there they opened up, we came to Buchenwald\nand everybody was eating up whatever they had in the food packages with them. They were\ndiscarding the Polish money and the German Reich marks. After two, three hours, we went to\nsit in barracks. They had -- Buchenwald was a big camp, was about 60,000 inmates at that\ntime. It was established early in 1933. Right now, I know it was a political camp. In\nBuchenwald heather on the ground. But that time I didn\u2019t realize, I didn\u2019t realize that. Anyway\nwe registered and all the inmates did all the work. They ask us where we come from, your\nmother\u2019s name, your father\u2019s name and all this stuff. After registration, we went to a big hall.\nWe had to take all the clothes that we wear and before I left Poland, I mentioned that before I\nleft the ghetto, my mother told me that you have an aunt in Paris which I did have, her sister.\nShe says you have a cousin in Belgium and she gave me addressed envelopes and things like\nthat and says maybe you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going. Maybe you\u2019re going to need it one\nday. But when I went to Buchenwald and I had family pictures, my mother, my younger\nbrother, I had to put everything on the table. All the clothes, everything on the table and I only\nremember one German. A black uniformed German came in, we all had to 0 to commission.\nHe looked at my legs because like I said, from the dirty oil, I don\u2019t know what I blubbered up in\nGerman. He says, he just looked at me and was thinking, thinking. He just motioned at a line\nso I went over there. We had to go in first to a shower. I remember we just looking 1s water\ncoming in or gas coming out. Water was coming out and then we had to all to go in. They had\na big disinfection tube, was maybe like this room. Had to jump in, oh I had all scabs over here -\n-- was burning and burning. Before this, I forgot, after I took all the clothes off and everything,\nwe went to a different room. The inmates were all, the inmates had clippers. They clipping the\nhead, clipping hair, clipping hair, all over there. Then we were all clipped up. We had to jump\ninto this tub, this disinfect thing. Oh, it was burning something terrible. Then we jumped out.\nThis was January, was already January. knows, January 18, according to the record, I\ngot there, January 18. We went up from this tube, oh yeah, after we got up from the tube, I\nremember going up a flight of stairs. They gave me clothes. They gave me a pair boots, shoes,\nno socks. They gave me pants but no underwear. They gave me a jacket but no shirt. I didn\u2019t\nhave the striped jacket, just because, don\u2019t forget, it was January and it was already chaos in all\nthose camps. They had so many people come from Germany, I didn\u2019t even have a tattoo. I just\nhad an assigned number. They gave me all these clothes. Then we went out to the other end of\nthe barracks where we stand for two, three hours until we assigned a barrack. Here it\u2019s January,\nit\u2019s cold.",
        "Q: You\u2019re wet?",
        "A: You\u2019re wet, you\u2019re unshaved and all this stuff. Then they assigned us a barrack. In the\nbarracks, then I lost my friend. He got assigned a different barracks. You had to slide in and\nyou had to slide out. You couldn\u2019t go in. At night, if you had to go someplace, to the bathroom,\nyou were afraid to go if you leave your place. Because if you\u2019re placed in, nobody\u2019s going to\nlet you back in.",
        "Q: Oh, you mean, to slide back into the bunks?",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t slide in, whatever you had to do, you had to make it on the spot. There was only\nstraw there, there was no --. You had no blanket, they don\u2019t give you a blanket, we use straw.\nTo be exact, they were looking like shelves, like bins. Like you see the pictures, you slide in\nand slide out. I was in this barracks and then later on -- when I was in the barracks, I met my\nfriend. But first of all, they had kapos in the barracks. I didn\u2019t know what the word kapo\nmeans but I know people came to us and he says you people are newcomers? I says yes. I says\nwho is your leader. We called, one was a Jewish policemen in the labor camp was this. They\nwant to find out how we are treated .If we told him; we are treated by our own people, they kill\nhim on the spot. Because they say we want to do an example, in case they take your people out\nfor labor for a day or two to the city and somebody is going to inform on you, your own\npeople; when he comes back, he\u2019s going to have the same thing. He says we\u2019re\norganizing the thing. I remember one guy, he was the head of the camp. He came to us and\nsays, don\u2019t say anything bad. Because we always thought maybe we came from the ghetto from\nLodz, they didn\u2019t give us our clothes, we could have lived better. Buy different food, but I\ndon\u2019t know what happened to him. Maybe somebody else squealed on him, maybe not, I don\u2019t\nknow. I was in that camp and then I met my friend, it was nice. The first day, when I assigned\nmy rations, I put it in my pocket. I figure I\u2019m going to eat it later on. You get one day of\nrations, a piece of bread and a bowl of soup so I figure I\u2019m going to eat the bread at night. So at\nnight, I went to eat, the bread was gone. Somebody slipped it out and I didn\u2019t feel it. I figured\nout, don\u2019t ask me know but I don\u2019t know. I remember one thing, I sewed up my pockets. Don\u2019t\nask me where I got the needle and where I got the thread. Somebody must have had it. I\npunched a hole in the jacket through here and I was slitting out to here. While I was in this\nbarrack, they took out people for work, the kapos. They had people in the barracks, they had\npeople -- Germans, they had Russians who preceded us to Buchenwald. Some people who\ncame maybe in 1939, in 1940, in 1938, they were in charge of the barracks, they were in charge.\nThe kapos, they had to go to a special appellplatz, the main camp where they counted them. We\nhad to go to a different spot too. Sometimes, we stayed for two, three hours in the snow, don\u2019t\nforget it was January. The snowflakes they were falling; he counted us up, then dismissed.\nThen dismisses, you went into a cold barrack. If you had a piece of bread left over in the\nmorning, you ate it. If not, nothing. In daytime, in the morning, we heard a whistle blowing.\nThey took us for work, from the barracks, just to drag wood because you have to remember that\nBuchenwald was carved out from a forest. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar or not. It\u2019s ten miles\naway from Weimar. It\u2019s a lot of birch trees and forest. Maybe they need the wood, maybe they\ndidn\u2019t need it. They just make you work. They don\u2019t let you just stay around idle. They were\ntaking us out for work every day.",
        "Q: You were just cutting wood, 1s that what you were doing?",
        "A: No, I remember I was dragging wood. I don\u2019t remember where I was dragging it, maybe\nputting it in one pile, taking to the other pile, everybody had to work. Over there -- I was doing\nthis maybe for a month or for two months. Then all of a sudden, one day, they announce they --\n-. Then we heard, like I told you, the kapos had a separate room in the barracks. Have you ever\nbeen to service in the army?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. In the barracks itself, they had a couple rooms, in the barracks carved out for the kapos.\nThey weren\u2019t exactly mean, they were kapos, they were in charge of the barracks, know what I\nmean?",
        "Q: Were the kapos, were they Jewish, or were they --?",
        "A: No, well in this instance they happened to be --. I knew a couple of them were Russians, two,\nthree Russians. One of them was German. Maybe they were ex-prisoners of war. Or maybe\nthey were just taken to Germany for labor and somehow they wind up in a conservation camp.\nI didn\u2019t ask any specific. I know one was -- a couple were German. One was a green triangle,\nmeans he was a criminal prisoner. One had a red triangle, means he was a political. Outside the\nbarracks, they had detached, like a small cottage. They were only German, kapos. They were\nnot kapos but I don\u2019t know what they were doing. They were prisoners, they were dressed\nnicely, they had red triangles and they were in boots, they were nice. They didn\u2019t take --they\nhad connections in the camp but they were prisoners, you know what I mean?",
        "Q: So the prisoners were treated differently depending on what kind of prisoner you were? Like if\nyou were a political prisoner, you were treated better than say a Jewish person?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether they were treated better than --. But if somebody had to do manual labor,\nthey were in charge of the auto workmen. If somebody had to drag woods, he didn\u2019t have to\ndrag the woods.",
        "Q: So there was definitely a differentiation between --?",
        "A: Sure. We have the kapos differently But if he was a maybe he wasn\u2019t abused to other\nprisoners but you had to do it. But they had to go to the appells too. So all of a sudden, one\nday they announce they evacuated Buchenwald. I heard the kapos talking, they bombed, the\nAmericans are already in Erfut. Erfut spelled E-e-f-u-t. You ever heard of the word, Erftut?\nIt\u2019s not far from Weimar. Buchenwald was near Weimar, ten miles away. They would be here\nsoon so they took the Jews. They\u2019re taking the Jews.",
        "Q: Do you remember what time this was? It was in /45, do you remember the month?",
        "A: That must be in February because it was still cold. Was a very short span. I was only three\nmonths in Buchenwald so I can go back, was in February. So they say\u2019, they going to evacuate,\nthey going to take the Jews. All the Jews have to report. I knew if they take the Jews, I know\nwhat\u2019s going to happen.",
        "Q: They only took the Jews at this point?",
        "A: To report. They were all mixed in this camp, mixed Jews and non-Jews, and\nFrenchmen. They said all the Jews have to report, evacuated. So the way they did that, they\nsays, they emptied all the barracks in a big place, in a big square and they says everybody on\nthis side. Then they have this kapo, lined up, like I said, Russians, Germans, and you had to\napproach. If they recognize a Jew, you\u2019re on this side in there. I passed by, they knew me but\nthey let me through.",
        "Q: They let you on the political side?\nA They let me on the other side . I didn\u2019t go in the Jewish transport. I don\u2019t know. Maybe they\ndidn\u2019t recognize me, I didn\u2019t ask any questions. He just send me so I didn\u2019t go with the Jewish\ntransport. Then another day, they did the same thing. I hid underneath the barracks. Some\nkapos came in and they pull us out from underneath the benches. I remember somebody gave\nme a kick and my back was hurting maybe for a week or so. Then I met my friend. He was\nhiding too, he was in a different barracks. Finally they says, everybody has to go. So\neverybody has to go, alright. So we line all up and we went to the main camp to Buchenwald.\nThey kept us there in a big hall. Don\u2019t ask me what kind, I remember it was a big hall, they\nkept us overnight and the next day too. Towards dusk, they says, now we\u2019re going to go to the\ntrain station. They let us out from the big, looked like a factory type building. I would\nrecognize it now. Now you have to describe, they had the German SA, youngsters, one side.\nThey had big bat and we had to this and they were beating you.",
        "Q: Like a gauntlet or something?",
        "A: Like a gauntlet right. I want to say like a gangplank but I don\u2019t want to use the word, a\ngangplank is like aramp. You know like a gangplank. I don\u2019t remember if I received a blow, if\nI didn\u2019t receive the blow.",
        "Q: They just hit you?",
        "A: Yeah, they had three, four on this on this side; three or four on this side. Then the other side,\nthey lined us up; they lined us up.",
        "Q: They had like clubs, is that what you mean?",
        "A: Clubs, or bats or truncheons. Maybe they had plain stakes. Who remembers? You see all these\nthings lie down, they beating the things, you don\u2019t pay attention what it was. Who knows what\nit was, I don\u2019t remember. Anyway after you went through this gauntlet, they lined us up and it\nwas already dusk like I said and we marched to Weimar. The Germans marched us to Weimar. I\nremember they had big dogs on the sides, big German shepherds. They came to the train\nstation, I think it was really dark. They put us in open flatcars, was already dark, maybe ten,\neleven o\u2019clock at night. I don\u2019t have any perception of time. The trains start moving. So the\ntrains start moving; we moved overnight and then in the daytime, planes came and shot up,\nQ\u201d They shot up at the train\u201d.",
        "A: At the train. Somebody asked what is the name of this place? I heard them say Zeis. I don\u2019t\nknow, someplace in Germany, Zeis, Z-e-1-s. I think right now, I\u2019m not so sure but I heard Zeis\nwhere they make optical equipment over there. You heard of that thing?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It says we in Zeis or something like that. Maybe where -- then the Germans assembled another\nlocomotive after the planes left and we were riding again. Then the planes came and shot up\nagain. So they assembled us all in columns I don\u2019t know, maybe 5,000 people. Don\u2019t forget\nthey say they empty Buchenwald, not all of them. They marched us to Flossenburg. This is\nanother camp. I don\u2019t know how you spell Flossenburg, it\u2019s near Weiden. Right now I\u2019m\nreading all the books. I\u2019m interested because I lived this period; I know that right now from\nhistory was a criminal camp. One of the German, Admiral Kanaris, he was head of the German\nUpfeur, German intelligence. He got hung up over there. In the middle of the story or not.\nOver there, was even worse than Buchenwald because we were sleeping --. I was with my\nfriend there from New York and we sleeping that camp maybe for a week or so. Then they say\nthey evacuated Flossenburg. Thy marched us out from Flossenburg to the train. That was in the\nmorning, maybe eleven o\u2019clock. I think it was on a Sunday, I don\u2019t know why I remember\nSunday but I have stuck in my head, Sunday. I know the sun was shining high and the train\nstation was right outside of the camp and they loading us in open boxcars, listen to that. The\ntrains didn\u2019t even start moving yet. All of a sudden, I see planes from far away. Big planes in\nthe sky and the sun shines on them, I think that was the jet age coming out. In a second, they\nwere right over the train -- shot everything up. All of a sudden, I heard something hit my face.\nI asked my friend, do I have blood on my face? He just looked, he says no. But I looked up\nand I see that we were not moving yet. They had a big sign, crossing written down in German,\nmade out of wood. A crossing sign, you know, maybe one of the splinters, some bullet too, hit\nme in the face. But nothing was bleeding, it was nothing, something hit me. When the planes\nshot up the train, everybody jumped off the train so I jumped off the train too. The Germans\nwere running to the farmhouses, to the nearby houses. I run after them too. I heard them, run\ninto German, must have been a German house or something, I wasn\u2019t the only one, maybe there\nwere dozens of legs, we run with the guards.",
        "Q: Everybody was running?",
        "A: We were running. The guard says, I heard him, I understood this much German. He says, the\nAmericans must have a base nearby because the plane left already. They going to be coming\nback. But then after everything was over, the guards came back. We came back to the train too.\nBut not everybody went with the guards.",
        "Q: People ran away?",
        "A: No, some of them stayed with the -- on the wagons. They were going through the packages, the\nGermans\u2019 knapsacks.",
        "Q: Stealing the food and stuff?",
        "A: Just with them open. They took out the cigarettes, they took out the food. When the Germans\ncame and they saw what\u2019s going on, they lined everybody up. They searched everybody. They\nfound food on them and cigarettes and lined them up and killed them on the spot. After a while,\nthey assembled us all and the train start moving again, whoever was left. The ones who was\nkilled, I don\u2019t know if they buried them or left them on the side or took them back to camp. The\ncamp was maybe a few miles outside. We didn\u2019t even left ----- . We were riding\nagain, maybe for a day or two. Planes used to come, the Americans and British were already\nnearby. They didn\u2019t have far to go. They were already in France. They shooting at the planes.\nThe guard says, some of them just flew over and they didn\u2019t come down low so the guard says\nover there they\u2019re your friends. If they come over, you wave to them, so we waved, we had no\nchoice, we waved. Some just flew over, they didn\u2019t do anything. Sometimes they came down\nlow. When they came down low, the guards run out. Some of us were packed in the station.\nWhen the planes came over, I could see the tracer bullets. I could see them just like rains, hard\nrains you can see them. I jumped off the train. I hid underneath the wagon where the planks\nare.",
        "Q: Where the tracks are?",
        "A: Where the tracks are. I just lay there and I could see the guards, were all on the train. After\nthis, after 1t was all over, we went back. I remember it was British planes. Why do I know it\u2019s\nBritish? Because I could see the wheel, the mark with the red.",
        "Q: Like a bull\u2019s eye?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, like a bull\u2019s eye. They came very low. I could see the markings then. Then they\nshot up the locomotive. Then we left another day and the same thing happen. Here they come\nagain.",
        "Q: So they would come every day to shoot up?",
        "A: Every day, sometimes twice a day. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been in Bavaria or Germany;\nthey have thick tunnels over there, you know tunnels. As soon as they\nheard the air drone or something like this, the locomotive detached itself and it went for the\nnearest tunnel. After the ride was over, if the locomotive was intact, 1t wasn\u2019t shot up, they\ncould use it. It came back and they pull off again. But if the locomotive didn\u2019t have time, they\nhad to get something else. But anyway, they shot up a locomotive the last time and they\ncouldn\u2019t get anybody so a big fat German says, everybody line up. Whoever cannot -- we going\nto march from now on. Whoever cannot march doesn\u2019t have to worry, we going to provide\ntransportation. I know what transportation means. I was the first in line. Now I can see how\nlucky I am because, don\u2019t forget, I was in this labor camp, like I mentioned before the food was\nrelatively good. I could barter, the locals, so 1t was more food left for me. I was in the kitchen\nat night and it was food and the camp was only for about three months so I was in relative good\nhealth. I was in the first line over there. We marched all night, me and my friend from New\nYork. Then at night, we wind up near the roadside and we took a little bit leaves and they says\nyou\u2019re going to spend the night over there. The next night the same thing. But the third night,\nwas raining bad. I got soaked all through, all wet. Whoever fell out of line, if you read the\nstory about Bataan or Corregidor, the same thing. I was ready, my friend was ready, I was ready\nto go the roadside but my friend who lives in New York, he says, come on.",
        "Q: He wouldn\u2019t let you go?",
        "A: He pulled me, yeah. I was tripping over wires because they were shooting. The planes were\ncoming down, two, three times a day. All the wires were down, it was dark. I was ready to give\nup; he says, he grabs me he says you got to keep ---. So towards -- that was at night. We were\nmarching all night, all wet, you couldn\u2019t walk, soaked through. Towards morning, it was\nalready daybreak, we stopped on a farm and they put us in barns. They says you\u2019re going to\nrest here, the guards. All of a sudden, decide to take us all out for punishment because\nsomehow, somebody, they were messing up the barns. There were no toilets there. They were\nlining everybody up. They going to take us to a march or maybe, who knows. The Germans\nhad a tendency. If somebody did any infractions, they lined everybody up and they picked\npeople at random. They lined them up and they says I\u2019m going to pick every third man, or\nevery tenth man. They just pull them out and they just shot them just for no reason at all. So\nmaybe they tried to do the same thing this time. When they were getting ready, everybody lined\nup, we heard shooting. So the German says everybody back inside the barn. Then the shooting\nintensified. Like I mentioned, it\u2019s a barn. A barn has slits so some of the inmates looked --.\nBefore I mention that, for some reason an egg fell down, a chicken egg fell down and my friend\nwas nearby. We took the egg and we split it in half, a fresh egg. While we were sitting in the\nbarn, like I mentioned before, it was raining all night and the barn is warm near the hay and the\nstraw, our clothes is steaming. We heard the shooting and we looked out. Some of the inmates\nsays, the Russians are here. They saw the stars. At that time, we didn\u2019t know the American\ntanks have stars too. We know the Russians have stars. Then we notice in the front of the barn\nthe guards taking white handkerchiefs, or white rags or whatever it was white and put on the\nfront of their rifles. You know what I am talking about?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I was one of the last ones to get out of the barn. I got out of the barn just like you see in a\nmovie picture. Everything burns around you. You\u2019re a farmhouse; a farmhouse burns here; a\nbarn burns here. All the inmates in the thousands, all running wild. All uniforms, all kind of\nuniforms. Don\u2019t forget they evacuated the camp like Buchenwald in the thousands. The\nGermans had the transport too with them. They had the carts and the horses and some motor\ntransports. All of a sudden you see the inmates they robbing the wagons and all the stuff. I\nwent to a wagon too, seeing some German boots. I had no shoes, I put on a pair of boots. I had\nno size, just pulled them on. Like I mentioned before, don\u2019t forget, I said I sewed up the\npockets. I go over there and I see a big German woman. She has a big country bread all\naround. She cut slices and here the inmates stay and everybody gets a big slice of bread. Take\na big, line the lines, she gives me a slice of bread too. Then I go to the next house and I see raw\npotatoes outside. I take these raw potatoes and I start packing them inside. I\u2019m all weighed\ndown, heavy. I go the next farmhouse, somebody preceded me already. They all Russian\ninmates, Russian- speaking inmtes.",
        "Q: They ate all the food?",
        "A: They already killed the chicken. They already picking the feathers off. Somebody very quick,\nthey were right there. Maybe they got liberated 15, 20 minutes before, who knows. Then we\nsaw tanks rumbling by and they throwing down cigarettes. Then we go to a clearing and we\nsaw tanks parked and we go over to somebody. Somebody ask what language you speak. We\nsaid, well we from Poland. We find a Polish-American. He speaks in broken Polish. He goes\nto the truck and brings the care rations up. Now I know they care rations, the cheese and the\ncandy was there. Somebody gets us cigarettes and I start to smoke. I\u2019m all dizzy. So I go to\nthe next village. The village not far away, maybe three miles. Don\u2019t forget there are thousands\nof people in the villages. I see a German stays outside. I says food, essen. He says, yah, yah,\ncome inside. I thought I\u2019m going to be the only one. I think I went with somebody too.\nSomebody was besides me there. I go in and the place is full. They\u2019re already sleeping on the\nbed and under the table. Here\u2019s coffee. I says coffee and he says yah, coffee, coffee, eggs,\neggs, milk. Anyway I ate eggs and the next day my stomach was sick. I\u2019m sick and in the\nmeantime they catching -- don\u2019t forget next day after the war, they bringing Germans back to\nrecognize a guard here and some beaten to death, some all bloodied up. They picking German\nup from the house, inmates all over, in the thousands, Russians, ex-prisoners, they\u2019re stronger\nthan Iam. I\u2019m young, I\u2019m 16, they\u2019re stronger than Iam. I\u2019m young, I\u2019m 16, they\u2019re in 30\u2019s,\n35. They entered the war, they know all about it. That was the liberation day.",
        "Q: Do you remember what day you were liberated on?",
        "A: Yeah. It\u2019s going to be this week, this 23\" of April. I always thought the 24\" and I call my\nfriend in New York. He says the 23\u2122 of April. As a matter of fact, because the paper I just\nshow you from the tracing bureau, it doesn\u2019t say when I was liberated but it (End of Tape 1)",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: I went to Schwandorf and I heard the Jews were assembled, all the ex-prisoners over there.\nThey made a and the women ex-prisoners, they went nuts on the kitchen. I don\u2019t\nknow if I should say it on tape, that\u2019s the first time I saw a black person. All of a sudden, I see\nan American army transport pulls up; I saw the blacks of the transportation department. At that\ntime the army thing was still segregated then. A guy opens the tailgate and I take a look and I\nsee black hands. I just looked -- the first time . That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen one, I didn\u2019t see it,\nthat\u2019s it. Okay so I was in that home and I didn\u2019t have much clothes. Some of them, like I said,\nsome of the ex-inmates were smarter and wiser than I am, some of them went to German homes\nand who was an ex-Nazi. They says, listen, you were a Nazi or you were the buegermeister,\ngive me some clothes, give me that. So they came with clothes, with sweaters and jackets. I\nwas young, I was 17, 18, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do. I want to go back to Poland.\nDon\u2019t forget, this happened in April and I left home in March, the ghetto, about a year I think\nsince I left home. I still was homesick, I was thinking about Poland and my brother and my\nsister. At that time, don\u2019t forget the first week, we didn\u2019t know the extent, what happened with\nAuschwitz and all the sick, Kelman and all this concentration camp. I still wanted to go back to\nPoland. I was in this home. All of a sudden, American soldiers came, one or two, I don\u2019t\nremember. He was a Jewish American soldier. He says we are in tents here on the outskirts of\nthe city in Scheondorf. We are in camp, we need about three, four volunteers who wants to go\nto work. Like washing pots and pans in the kitchen. I says, I volunteer to go. I went and\nanother couple boys and maybe two, three boys. We had a ball, all the oranges we want to eat\nand had a couple of -- I had an Italian cook, an American cook, Italian. from Chicago,\na few Polish words and he made spaghetti and it was good. Oh the spaghetti, anything, I didn\u2019t\nmind to wash the pots and pans. All of a sudden, chewing gum and candy; they were living in\ntents on the outskirts of the city. In the evening, they brought us back to that house where we\nsleeping over there. The next morning, he said would you like to come back tomorrow, I says\nyes. The truck came like 8 o\u2019clock, 9 o\u2019clock, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: To pick you up?",
        "A: Picks us up, the three or four boys went out to camp. This lasted about for three weeks. Then,\nhe said well, we have to leave, we have assignments. We have to pull down the tent, we\u2019re\ngoing to Nuremberg. I remember it was a big tall guy, an American, don\u2019t ask me the name, I\nforget. I don\u2019t know if he was a sergeant or not and he says we\u2019re going to Nuremberg. He said\nbut we going to come back and get you boys. I didn\u2019t think anything of it. He\u2019s leaving, he\u2019s\nleaving. After maybe two, three weeks, this guy shows up. He shows up and he says you want\nto go to Nuremberg? I says sure. I had no relatives, nothing attached. I didn\u2019t have to pack\nbecause I had nothing, maybe I acquired an additional sweater or maybe an additional pair\npants, I don\u2019t remember. There\u2019s nothing to speak of, I just took it and he picked us up and\nwent to Nuremberg. In Nuremberg, there were tents too. I don\u2019t remember what the name of\nthe engineer or Battalion of Engineering or something like that. Then, the same thing, all the\nfood and all the --.",
        "Q: You were working for them? Doing odd jobs?",
        "A: Yeah, no, no money, nothing. Maybe whatever it is, they gave us clothing, they gave us shoes,\narmy fatigues, army boots, whatever you need \u2014 a shirt, underwear, green underwear. Then they\nsaid, all of a sudden, they had to leave too, after two, three months. By that time, I was working\nover there, I also find out that the size of this was Nuremsbek. There 1s a sizeable Jewish\ncommunity in Furt. Furt, it\u2019s Bavaria too. It\u2019s spelled F-u-r-t. We took the streetcar from\nNuremberg and you went to Furt. They had Jewish community there and they were all\nnewcomers and had a home too. Just like a house but I was not living in this house. I think we\nall had a tent to ourselves, was handy there. At that time came to go too. So they said they\u2019re\ngoing back to the United States but before they say, they pack for their vacation. They going to\nleave from Marseilles, France. So they had two choices. We can either leave you in Germany\nand find you another job with the American army or we can give you back to France. At that\ntime France was right after post-war in \u201945, they could bring across the border. You know in\n\u00b045, is everything chaos still. He says -- we figure, well if they going to dump us off in France,\nwe\u2019re on our own, don\u2019t know anybody. Here I find up, the community of Furt and things like\nthat. I felt already a little bond. So he says why don\u2019t you find us a job here? Next to the\nwhere they had the tents, was the American hospital. I have letters from the hospital. They\ngive letters of recommendation, 381*' Evacuation Hospital or something like this. We decide to\nwork over there and they give us quarters and they give us food. Like I said, we had all the\nclothes, we had a room. Inside, was no tents, already in the hospital, had separate rooms, three,\nfour boys. In the morning, we just went to work in the kitchen. We were not cooking; they had\narmy cooks. You know what we were in charge? We were lighting the stoves. You remember\nthe field army stoves, are you familiar with that?",
        "Q: Yeah, I\u2019ve seen those before, yeah.",
        "A: You pump gas and you clean them and you repair them. Over there, I don\u2019t know. I work for\nthe hospital for three, four years. I think later on and I got paid for that too --but it\u2019s so long\nago. I think later on they transfer because they had German civilians working too. We went in\nthe German economy. Then, like I said, my friend, the one I spend the war with, he found\nhimself a job too. He found himself a job in the adjoining city with the American army too. He\ntold me he heard -- heard a lot of the people who are liberated, they go to America. They have\nrelatives but I didn\u2019t have anybody so nothing to claim. Then he told me that if you go to\nMunich, Congress passed a law, he told me the American government -- I didn\u2019t know the\ndifference between Congress and no Congress that some displaced person they can register with\nthe Joint. He went first and he came back, he says yes, you can register. I went there too and I\nregistered and I had a very easy time because after the war I worked. I had recommendations\nfrom the army, had a good police record. Then I registered and I was -- oh yes, then I think that\nI went to be on my own. I still worked for the hospital, I worked for a while but I didn\u2019t want to\nlive over there. Because in the evening I want to be free. I want to be with my own people and\nI put an ad in the paper. I\u2019m looking for a room. Rooms are very hard to get in Germany after\nthe war. But I mentioned, I want to mention that a lot of German Jews came back, German\nJews after the war. They were liberated or some maybe were never in a camp; they were mixed\nmarriages and maybe the Germans didn\u2019t touch them. Anyway I went once to a service in\nNuremberg, Jewish service. There were a lot of German Jews there who came back from\nTheresienstadt and things like that. I find out that they had very high positions in the post-war\ngovernment in Germany right after the war. I want to live on my own. I talked to them and one\ntold me he works in this ministry, the other in the other ministry. So I put an ad in the paper, I\nwant to be on my own for a room. I got a response like in a post office box. I went to look at\nthe room and the room was right near the Palace of Justice, near the military tribunal, where\nthey tried the Nazis. As a matter of fact, the building was right across the street, I seen the\nSoviets on the balcony. They were living there too. The people who were attached to the\nJustice, to the Russian delegation. Anyway I looked at the room and the lady asked me what I\ndo. I told her I am working at the hospital. She says yeah? I says I\u2019m Jewish. She says oh,\nyeah. After the war, everybody had a Jewish relative. She says you know what, I registered\nthis room, she says, with the government because I don\u2019t want them to assign me a newcomer\nfrom -- an ethnic German from the displaced, from Schlis _ or something like this. If you\ncan get it, if somehow you can bring a certificate that you want the room. I made contact with\nthis German ministry. I tell him, listen I have a room but I need assignment. No problem, he\ngave me an assignment, I was living over there. Then my papers came through. They call me\nto the council. I had to give the birth certificate. I don\u2019t have a birth certificate, if you come\nfrom Europe, everything was taken away. That was relatively easy, you find people from your\nhometown. They know I\u2019m from Poland so I had this witnesses where I was born, where I\u2019m\nfrom and I assembled different papers. We get them translated into English. I went for the\ninterview. Finally I got to America.",
        "Q: When did you come to America?",
        "A: I came August 31, 1949. Before I came to America, I was in a camp, in a transit camp. N the\ntransit camp, they give you orientation, what to expect in America. They gave you a booklet,\nwhat you should expect. They gave you a booklet in your own language, whatever you read the\nbest. I took a book in Polish because I understood this language the best. They say, the booklet\nis from -- it say Washington, D.C. is the seat of the government and New York is a big city and\nthings like that. So I read all about it. I came on the ship . It took us eight days.\nI didn\u2019t get sick on the boat, a lot of people sick around me. The boat came to New York harbor\nlike in the evening. All of a sudden when you come from Europe, from post-war Europe and\nwe were outside in the harbor, we didn\u2019t go into New York harbor. We just stayed there\novernight but you could see the cars moving, they looked like, it\u2019s a sight when you come from\nEurope and you don\u2019t see all the streets and the lights and fire way over --. Everything is alive,\nyou see New York City. Especially when you see from far away. Maybe it was five miles\naway, out to the harbor. We stayed overnight on the boat. When the mist start lifting in the\nmorning, I don\u2019t know whether it was August, it got daylight maybe 5 o\u2019clock, maybe 5:30 , I\ndon\u2019t know, it was already mist. I went outside. We couldn\u2019t sleep already all night, passed the\nStatue of Liberty. I read of the Statue of Liberty in the book so I knew the Statue of Liberty.\nWe passed it and the boat anchored. Then immigration came on the board. We had papers and\neverything. I became legitimate. We didn\u2019t go to Ellis Island. They put a pin on my lapel. I\ncame through the Joint distribution. Somebody sponsored me but I don\u2019t know who did. It\ncame tShe group but somebody must have did it. They had different nationalities. They always\nhad to have Catholics, they came to Catholic organizations, they had Jewish, they came to a\nJewish organization. Maybe they had Quakers through a different organization. Anyway, these\ndifferent organization, my pin, they came towards me. I didn\u2019t know this people but they could\ntell.",
        "Q: They approached you?",
        "A: They approached me. They said, yeah. Well, I spoke a little bit English but they assign people\nlike to speak in --.",
        "Q: Translators, yes.",
        "A: Translators, they spoke like Yiddish, Americans who spoke Yiddish. They took us over there.\nMy luggage consisted of an old valise, lock-top and springs, they had no problem. He still had\nto go through customs. Now I know they\u2019re customs, they open up and they\u2019re looking. They\nassign you right there. You go on the other side and you get doughnuts and coffee. Doughnuts\nand coffee and then I saw a Yiddish-speaking woman comes to me. Remember that I had\nnothing to carry. I didn\u2019t need a porter. She says you come with me. I remember riding\nescalators. It must have been Penn Station or something, I don\u2019t know. I remember going to\ntaxi, another taxi, maybe it was. I remember riding escalators and taking with the gate. There\nwere a lot of people outside the gate0. She says, she gives me two tickets and she says, you\ngoing to Washington D.C. When the gate opens up, there will be a train there. When the people\ngo down, she didn\u2019t even wait until the gate opens up, when the people go down, you go down\nthe stairs and you get on the train with the other people and you get off in Washington D.C.",
        "Q: Was there any reason that you went to Washington? They just sent you there?",
        "A: Well, I tell you. Right now, I cannot think of any reason because I put in my papers that I\nworked in the American army in the kitchen. Maybe they figured there\u2019s a lot of hotels in\nWashington, D.C., maybe he can find a job in a -- I don\u2019t know. They sent me to Washington,\nD.C.. They just send me there, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to Washington, D.C. and they gave me\nthree dollars. She gave me three dollars, three American dollars and says, you buy lunch on the\ntrain. She says in Washington, D.C. you wear this pin and somebody is going to approach you.\nOkay, so the gate opens up and everybody goes down. The doors slide open and I go inside.\nEveryone sits down and I sit down too. Now I\u2019m ready \u2014 I says I got to go to Washington, D.C.\nThey said how about I miss it, but I read Philadelphia in the book. They told you about the\nLiberty Bell \u2014 they have all these things written down in the book. All of a sudden I spot\nAmerican Legionnaires and they had Washington, D.C. on Legionnaires\u2019 cups. So I thought to\nmyself when they get off, I\u2019m going to get off too. I had doughnuts and I had the coffee and I\nhad the three dollars in my pocket. I said I\u2019m not going to spend the three dollars to buy lunch\nbecause I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to get an American dollar next. I will not go in and have\nno . What I\u2019m going to do, I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t spend the lunch and didn\u2019t buy\nanything. I\u2019m getting off in Washington, D.C.. Everybody 1s getting off the train. At that time\nthe train wasn\u2019t yet the jet industry developed. The train was already a , 1f somebody\ntraveled by train especially in 1949, Union Station was crowded. Everybody getting off, I\u2019m\ngetting off. I\u2019m getting off waiting the main concourse, the main hall. I\u2019m just waiting there. I\nhave the valise. I have my best clothes from Germany after the war. I have a suit on and lapel.\nThe hall empties and nobody is approaching me. Nobody. I wait and wait. If you wait for\nsomebody and you wait for ten minutes, it sounds like an hour especially when you\u2019re in a\nStrange country.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know anybody there?",
        "A: Know anybody. I walk a little bit around. I remember I wrote the book and I wrote about the\nTravel Aid Society. I look in. What\u2019s it called, Travel Agent? No.",
        "Q: Travel ,Agency or --?",
        "A: No, not a travel bureau, usually military men go inside too like they help out.",
        "Q: I know what you\u2019re talking about.",
        "A: It\u2019s a travel-aid. They just do volunteer work for people who are stranded. It\u2019s not a regular\ntravel agency where you pay money. I says maybe I should go in here and tell them that I\u2019m\nlost. I go by and I look in and I see a sailor sitting there talking to somebody so I hesitated. I\nsays no I\u2019m going to wait another five minutes and the concourse is already empty. Then all of\na sudden I see a couple or women. They coming towards me. They must have spot me the way\nI\u2019m dressed. They coming towards me and I had to see the boat. They had a car, they all\nvolunteers. To me they probably wait. Maybe they couldn\u2019t find any volunteer, were late. We\nwalk out Union Station and the first thing you see is the Capitol. I says this is the White House?\nNo, they correct me, that is the Capitol. It never made any difference to me why is the Capitol\nso white. It all depends on which angle you look at the White House, at the portico, it looks\nlike Capitol too. Anyway we got in their car and they took me to 18\" Street, near the zoo over\nthere. It was a boarding house and they says you going to be here. They told me the next day,\nleave it to the Jewish Social Service Agency. They wrote down the address. The Jewish Social\nService Agency at that time was on Spring Road which is right at 14\" Street. There was no\nsuburbs then and being I was Columbia Road, right near the zoo which is Adams-Morgan now\nand Spring Street is not --. They gave me the address, I can take the bus. Over there, I was ---\nthe lady she had lot a -- the Jewish Social Service paid her money. She put newcomers up with\nfood. She gave me a room, she had a rooming house. She says you\u2019re going to be here until we\nfind out what we going to do with you. The next day I went to the Jewish Social Service\nAgency and I had an interview with a Mr. Pixner. I think he just retired from the Jewish Social\nService Agency. He asked me what I did and the war, where I\u2019m from, relatives, no relatives.\nHe gave me $20 in my pocket. So I had $3 plus $20; I had $23. With $23, they says here\u2019s $20\nand you will sightsee. They want me to go to the city, transportation because they put me up\nwith food so I didn\u2019t need any food. I went back to the house and this lady, she packed my\nlunch. She says, I\u2019m a stranger in the city. I was afraid to venture too far out. She says well\nyou can go to the zoo. The zoo was nearby. I could walk over there, Adams-Morgan. She gave\nme the lunch so she says it\u2019s a big zoo. Big zoo, I\u2019m afraid I might be lost in the zoo. So the\nfirst bench I approached I sat down and I ate my lunch up. I finished for the day. The next day\nI ventured out and I went to 14\" Street. That time 14\" Street was all white and you could walk.\nIt wasn\u2019t like after before the riots. I looked in different stores. I saw a cleaning store\nand I see somebody reading a Jewish newspaper, I recognized it. I says maybe should go\ninside and ask him if he can find me a job. But I hesitated, I didn\u2019t go in. The following day,\ndon\u2019t forget, I still had food, I went downtown. I think Lafayette Park or some place. I just sat\ndown and men were sitting there. I struck up a conversation with him. He asked me where I\u2019m\nfrom and everything. I told him where I come from. He says he\u2019s an ex-Navy man. He was in\nthe Seabees. He says he lives on 14\" Street with his wife. He lives in the Cavalier Apartments\non 14\" Street. I was still living far away like I told you, near the zoo which is all in walking\ndistance. He says why don\u2019t you come and I want my wife to meet you. Okay, so maybe the\nnext day, I went and met his wife. He says you know we have to find you a room where you\ncan stay. I told him I don\u2019t like where I stay. We could find you a job. I think he gave me\ndinner and he said would you like to -- so he says we find a job first. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to find a room. How you going to pay? He asked me what I did. I says I don\u2019t know. I\nworked for the American army, he kitchens. They going to find you a job in People\u2019s Drug\nStore. In the commissary at night. Are you familiar with Washington? They had counters with\nfood and all this stuff. He took me to the Personnel and they find a job. So I work at night. He\nsays well, we got to get youa room. I didn\u2019t like my job. I didn\u2019t like ay nights sleeping in the\ndaytime, work at night. I cannot meet nobody. I was working there maybe for a week or for\ntwo weeks. Then he says now we go into the People\u2019s Drug Stores, 14\" and Park Road was a\ndrug store and they have notices, who rents for rooms. Inside of a day, he saw a room for rent\nright around the corner where he lives. We went over there and we talked to the man. They\nwere refugees too. They were German Jewish refugees but they arrived there before the war.\nBut they were still refugees. He recognized my accent. Where you from, from Poland? I told\nhim. He says where do you work? I says I just got a job at People\u2019s overnight. I don\u2019t like this\njob and the work at night. He says you know what, he says. I got a cousin; he\u2019s got a\nrestaurant. Let me call up; if he needs somebody. He calls him up and this cousin live around\nthe neighborhood. He was living Arkansas Avenue, in walking distance too. He says I have a\nyoung man, he\u2019s from Poland, he works at night. Do you think you can use him? He says bring\nhim over. He says, you work the same evening. We walk over the same evening come over,\nhow you doing, like with wine. All right, a little bit of wine, Manischievez. He says I have a\nplace downtown near Thomas Circle. He says come over there. If you like it, you take the job.\nIf you don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s fine too. The next day I go over there. It\u2019s a daytime job. He says, so\nyou spend a day, what do you have to lose. You\u2019re off in the daytime, you work at night. I\nstayed there and I says I like it. He paid me a dollar an hour, 40- hour week. I took home $36\nbut I figured I have a room already. I paid $40 for my room, nice people, German people, nice\nand clean. I have aroom, I\u2019m single so I don\u2019t have to go out for food. I have a daytime job. I\nhave my friend, a newly acquired friend, Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown he was very nice. Once ina\nwhile Sally went over there and she ate and she says you learn English. How do you spoke,\ntransportation. Very nice people, interested in them. You ask about school.. I enrolled in\nAmericanization school. The Americanization school was then on 18\" and Columbia Road on\nCalifornia Street. I went to school and then I make all -- people from Poland and some from\nLodz and some from different. Some from boys, some came to an uncle, some came to an aunt,\nsome came just like me. That was in the evening. I had to be there seven o\u2019clock. I went there\nseven o\u2019clock. I learned about the poems Captain my Captain. You recite poems and sing.\nDon\u2019t forget we\u2019re all older people. Then I make friends. On the weekend I have where to go.\nI have already friends and I have a daytime job. I ask them what do you do for a living. One\nworked for an uncle, one worked in a tailor shop, one works here, one is giving a party. Then I\nmet my wife because I didn\u2019t. I met some guy, he says we\u2019re going to have a party this\nweekend. Could you come along. He took me along and my wife, she came to her uncle. They\nwere living off -- they had already a nice house. Uncle was in business. You know who lives in\nthe house? Fauntleroy.",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: The former delegate, well to do.. I had already friends and then after Americanization School, I\nenrolled in Central High School and take --. Right now, it\u2019s Cardoza, it\u2019s 13 and 15\" Streets. I\ntook a few courses over there at night. Then I had already dates with my wife and had parties\nand we picnic, the American way. We went to beaches and I still had my job. Then I had to\nregister for the draft and then I got married.",
        "Q: When did you get married?",
        "A: I got married January 6, 1952. I came in \u201949. I got married in 1952. Listen to that. I came\nback from my honeymoon, I had greetings from Uncle Sam to go to the army. I says I just\ncame from -- I don\u2019t want to sound like a . I want to go in the army but I just came\nfrom a camp and all of a sudden, I got to go away. I\u2019m acquiring a family now with a wife,\nwith relatives. I don\u2019t have anybody, now I got to go away. All right but I have to go. The\ninduction center I had to report on New York Avenue. I go down there and the first time I must\nhave been late. Because we were living northwest and I didn\u2019t know the bus connections. I\nwas late and the bus left me . The clerk over there, 1t was a legitimate excuse, I was\njust late. She says well you come back next week. She put it down on my paper. The next\nweek I was there a little bit earlier. I came back next week and we took us down to Alexandria.\nI think it\u2019s Cameron (?) Station. You\u2019re familiar with it? We went through the whole process\ntests and everything. Then we had to go for interview. I went for interview. The captain calls\nme in because I couldn\u2019t speak -- broken English and probably didn\u2019t make out too good in my\ntests. I didn\u2019t understand some questions. He find out that I was in Buchenwald. He says, I\nliberated Buchenwald. He says I\u2019m going to give you a postponement for one year until you are\na little more familiarized yourself with the country. We put you 4F now. In one year, they\ncalled me back. At that time, I was already more organized and they called me back. I had to\nreport to Ft. Meade. I was drafted, I was two years. I came in -- I went in as a private, I came\nout as a sergeant. I took my basic training with the 101\u2018 Airborne in Kentucky and then I got\nassigned to Ft. Bragg, North Carolina which was good for me because I was stationed there.",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t too far away?",
        "A: Wasn\u2019t too far away and I was in charge of the mess hall because I knew it already the same that\nyou cook in baking school. I came out top of the class. I have all the best recommendations. I\nshow you later on after the interview is finished. I let you read about it. I came up top of the\nclass. They gave me a set of knives and everything. Then I got discharged from the service. I\nwas looking for a job so I got a job from the Giant maybe for a year or two. Then I worked for\nmy wife\u2019s Uncle Ben here, a liquor store. Then I went back to the guy, the restaurant who gave\nme the first job. Over there, I met somebody who 1s a salesman. He says I know of a place but\nyou know the work, he tells me and I know who wants to sell it, so maybe you can take me as a\npartner. He says I\u2019m going to draw less than you do because I have a job. But I just going to be\n-- I\u2019m going to pull up the money just like you. But you live in the house and I figure that that\u2019s\na terrific idea for me. He knows the place so I went to look at the place. I bought the place and\nnow I\u2019m already 19 years over there. I\u2019m going on 20 years. It\u2019s a very nice place. It\u2019s the\nUnited States Secret Service is over there. I know everybody over there and I have a good\nbusiness. Now I\u2019m ready to retire and don\u2019t forget, I came to America with $3 I got in New\nYork. That\u2019s my story.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a very good story.",
        "A: Now I\u2019m going to go upstairs and I\u2019m going to show you the letters of my recommendation,\nokay?",
        "Q: Okay. Can I ask you a question before we stop?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: I know you said you left your family in the ghetto in Lodz. Did you ever find out what\nhappened to them?",
        "A: Well, I tell you. I didn\u2019t find out. I want to go back to Poland right after when I mentioned it\nbecause I was barely one year over. Then I got back to work for the American army and this\nlike this. Then the pogroms set in in Poland. In Kielce when I was there. I heard different\nstories that the people who came back from the camp, who came back to the hometowns, and\nthe Poles made sarcastic remark. So many of you still survive! I thought you all dead and\nthings like that. Then as things became known, when they liquidated the ghetto, the most of\nthem went to Kelna and then they went to Auschwitz. Then I considered, I looked at the\npicture, my father was already 40 years old. He was born in 1900. He was 44 years, it\u2019s not old\nbut the Germans done that and you don\u2019t have much food to eat, you look like an old man. My\nmother, one year younger. Then I had a younger brother. He was at that time, he was born in\n1929 so that makes him in 1945, 12, 13, so it\u2019s a very slim chance to survive. But I did, I was\nwriting letters to friends because I know I had some friends. As a matter of fact, right after the\nwar I came in contact with some people from France. They were in the French army but they\nwere touched in Nuremberg. Somehow I got to know them. They tried to help but I didn\u2019t get\nany response. I wrote to the French government, to different organizations and -- but then after\nright now with the Clarks affair and -- things like this, I obtained a letter from the\nClarks and I notice that my aunt was on the transport on the list. I have the list\nupstairs too so it\u2019s a very slim chance to survive. I didn\u2019t hear anything. Besides I registered in\nJerusalem and I registered in Germany. They have all my records from the date of inception. I\nfigured if a younger brother is looking for me, he could find me easily so I never knew. I\nwondered many times but --.",
        "Q: Did you ever think about going to Israel?",
        "A: I wanted to go to --. America was the last thing on my mind because I didn\u2019t think of going to\nAmerica in the first few couple of years after the war, only America had the strict quota. They\ntook in people who were sponsored by somebody who guaranteed the highest, highest, highest.\nBut then somehow, I think Truman, they passed a law, Congress passed a law, they got to admit\n200 or 250 thousand refugees. I wasn\u2019t the first one to believe in it so my friend, he 1s the first\none who entered Munch. But he brought me back to prove that he registered, he didn\u2019t have\nanybody. I went after that too. From that time, I knew I\u2019m going to have it easy because I\ndidn\u2019t engage in smuggling, black markets. I had a legitimate job and all the recommendations\nso I know if that\u2019s the date, I be coming here. That\u2019s my story.",
        "Q: Okay, I think we\u2019re done if you want to say anything else before --.",
        "A: I was just saying --. What I want to say, now things are differently. At that time in 1944, if\npeople could help one another but they didn\u2019t. A lot of people kept silent. I wouldn\u2019t condemn\nthe whole race or the whole nation but a lot of people could\u2019ve survived. The populations was\nvery hostile in Europe, in Eastern Europe especially. In Western Europe it was a different story\nbut in Eastern Europe, the Jews were always second-class citizens. Even right now, I\u2019m reading\nthe stories like after cleaning of the Warsaw ghetto, they brought the people from Auschwitz to\nclean the Warsaw ghetto. When the Poles made a revolt, they freed some of the inmates. The\nrevolt didn\u2019t last long but just for six weeks or so. They freed some of the inmates, they\ncleaning the Warsaw ghetto. They said we want to free Poland with our Jews. Some of them\ngot killed after the war so that what it is. That\u2019s man inhumanity to man. Right now if you see\nsomething wrong, you stand up and get to be counted. That\u2019s exactly what it means -- man\u2019s\ninhumanity to man. It\u2019s an old poem, I don\u2019t know if you read. It\u2019s not a poem, it was in the\npaper. A German priest writes. He says when Hitler came into power in 1933, he said, they\nstart persecuting the Jews. He says, I wasn\u2019t a Jew, I didn\u2019t spoke up. Then they take the\nhomosexuals put them in concentration camp -- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with it -- I\nwasn\u2019t a homosexual, I didn\u2019t speak up. Then they took the clergy, the Protestants, I wasn\u2019t a\nProtestant, I didn\u2019t spoke up. It came to the Catholic, I wasn\u2019t a Catholic, I didn\u2019t spoke up. It\ncame to me, there was nobody else to speak up for me. That\u2019s the way it is. That\u2019s what it is.",

        "A: Okay, thank you. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to sound.",

        "A: My name is Leon Merrick. I was born in Zgierz, Poland. Spelled Z-g-i-e-r-z. It\u2019s near Lodz,\nabout four miles from Lodz. I was born January 8, 1926. I had my mother and father who were\nliving in the same city as Zgierz. I had a younger brother, his name was Motl. He was three\nyounger. I was attending school in Zgierz when the war broke out September 1, 1939. I think I\nwas 13 years old.",
        "A: Okay. Zgierz was a town, excuse me a minute you\u2019re going to edit it later, right? Is that what it\nis?",
        "A: All right. The town was, Zgierz, I think it was about, 129,000 people, was about 5,000 Jews.\nWas mostly textile, the people were engaged in textile.",
        "A: Yes, because Lodz was the biggest textile area in Poland. Zgierz was only about eleven\nkilometers away. This is roughly about five, six miles.",
        "A: I think I started school in 1932.",
        "A: I think seven years old. This is when primary school started.",
        "A: It was a public school.",
        "A: Yes, I was going to a Jewish school in the afternoons because the public school was up to, let\u2019s\nsay about one, two o\u2019clock. After this about once a week, or twice a week we had to go to\nHebrew and learn about Hebrew. We also had one hour of religious school in the public school.",
        "A: In public school, right.",
        "A: Basic religion, you know, it was a basic course, about the holiday and things like that.",
        "A: No, it was in the same class.",
        "A: It was in the same school. We just had I think, all Jewish pupils, boys and girls. But we had a\nsprinkling of gentiles, they excused themselves. So the same thing, it was a Catholic class. The\nCatholics had one hour of public school too. So they excused the Jewish kids.",
        "A: Well, like I just mentioned, most of the teachers were Jewish. A few of them were Poles. The\nhead of the school, he was a Pole. As a matter of fact, he had the same last name like I have and\nhe was a Pole. I just remember one Catholic boy was going to our school, to our class because\nhe was persecuted in the old gentile school because his father was a communist and things like\nthis. So he couldn\u2019t attend school over there, he came to our school.",
        "A: Sure, all the time. As a matter of fact, it happened to me too. On my street, there were not many\nJews living so when I came home from school or from any other place, I saw a couple of\nroughnecks in the street, I know they going to be after me, I was waiting for a grown up person\nwho was going to pass by my house or maybe to the same apartment building so I can go with\nhim. I would be protected, more or less.",
        "A: Yes, quite often.",
        "A: Yes. It\u2019s a long name, I could spell it. The name of the street is named after a city nearby\nbecause it led like--Rockville Pike to Rockville. The name of the city was Konstatynowska, K-\nO-n-s-t-a-t-y-n-o-w-s-k-a, no. 15. I t was a wooden frame house. There were four families\nliving in the same house. We were living like on the courtyard. The European houses have\ncourtyards., I mean apartment buildings have courtyards.",
        "A: My father worked, he was---he worked in a factory. Like I mentioned, there was a textile\ncenter. He was--sometimes he was going on a truck. They had a truck and they also had horses\nand carts. They were going to the nearby city of Lodz and they were picking out raw materials\nfrom the factories that came out from the machines. He worked 1n a finishing factory. They\nbrought it back to the factory and they dyed the material and they took out all this floss and they\nprepared it for the stores -- to be ready to go to the stores and to work. Here you go in, you buy\na ready-made suit. But in Europe ,especially 50 years ago, you went to a store first and you\nbought the material. Then you had to look for a tailor. So when they finished the material, the\nmaterial went to the stores. The people went in and said I need material for a suit. Man rolled\nit open, says, how much do you need? He brought the measurements to the tailor. The tailor\ntold him how much he\u2019s going to need. He took the scissors, he cut it off, he took it to the tailor\nand he made the suit.",
        "A: Yes. He bought the material. He didn\u2019t finish it by himself. He just collected all the materials\nfrom the nearby city.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t a buyer because he wasn\u2019t buying it. He was collecting it for the factory like you\nbuy a salesman. He brings in the material to be finished up.",
        "A: My mother was a housewife. In the younger years, she worked but like we were getting older,\nwe were growing up, she took additional work. She was working with wool in a factory too,\nspinning wool for the material. It was a textile center, everybody was working 1n the factory.",
        "A: Yes, many.",
        "A: Yeah, I was still young. At that age, I really didn\u2019t know exactly what organizations means. I\nwas 13 years old when the war broke out but I belonged to a couple of organizations, just to get\ntogether to meet people.",
        "A: We sing Hebrew songs, talking about Palestine at that time. Everybody was dreaming of going\nto Palestine one day because Jews were always at the mercy of the Poles. They always felt like\nsecond -class citizens. In this country we refer like \u2018we\u2019. In Poland you refer \u2018they\u2019. You felt\nlike an outsider, like you were not part of the process and things like that. So it\u2019s different.\nThey had a quota, they had a quota in school, they had a quota in the military. A Jew couldn\u2019t\nbe a high official in the government. Maybe from the Jewish district, he was elected, a\nrepresentative, but that\u2019s about--he couldn\u2019t be a high official, appointed. He couldn\u2019t--they\ndidn\u2019t take any Jews.",
        "A: Okay, I remember exactly when the war broke out, September 1, 1939. I remember it was a\nFriday. I think my mother went to the market. Friday was market day, especially with the\nJewish people. They went to buy the stuff for the Sabbath. There wasn\u2019t like a grocery store.\nYou went to open market and you came back in the morning. It was eight, nine o\u2019clock; the\nweather was crisp; everybody was talking about the war. I looked up the sky and I saw these\nplanes with the top that time because the war hysteria was going already a week or two weeks\nbefore mobilization, talk about the Germans and things like this. On Friday, nothing happened\nto our city. The planes flew over in the morning. They were just like birds up in the sky, the\nsun was shining. Saturday, the planes came back again and the Poles were shooting up. You\ncould see the tracer bullets, you don\u2019t know if you hit them or not. The planes flew right over,\nflew higher, nothing reached them. But Sunday, they flew very low. They came very low over\nthe city and you could even see the pilot inside, very, very low. The city was in a panic.\nEverybody was going towards Warsaw. The Poles appealed to the populations, to able- bodied\nmen, to go toward Warsaw. We\u2019re going make a defense line over there, a stand. My father left\ntoo. I remember we marched all night, 54 left Zgierz, we left for the city. We went to a nearby\nvillage. I don\u2019t remember how many miles, maybe ten miles, 15 was a village. Everybody was\njust like -- refugees. We took a few possessions, a little bit of bread. At night, we got very\nscared because the Poles opened all the prisons and they let out all the inmates. I don\u2019t know if\nthey were political inmates or criminal inmates but you see a lot of people, they look like\nhoodlums with shaved heads. That night, my father left. He went toward Warsaw.",
        "A: To the next village. We went there overnight. But the next morning, my father left -- he was\njust -- toward Warsaw -- I don\u2019t know. Because the Poles --. At that time, everything was\ndisorganized already. It didn\u2019t take long for the Poles to get disorganized already. It didn\u2019t take\nlong for the Poles to get disorganized. They didn\u2019t send you a summons, you have to report.\nThey just broadcast, by word of mouth that all able bodied men who had served in the Polish\narmy at one time or another had to report towards Warsaw. They named the city Lovitz or\nsomething, we\u2019re going to make there a defense. Me and my brother and my mother were left\nalone. We figured well, we cannot defend ourselves. We have no clothes, nothing; we just left\nin a hurry. We went back towards Zgierz, our city. On the way, we encountered the Polish\narmy coming back, disorganized, disheveled with horses with wagons, some on foot. I didn\u2019t\nsee any mechanized unit, none whatsoever. We came back to our home and the neighbors said\nthey were glad to see us back, even though they were Poles. They gave us milk and bread and\nthings like that. I wasn\u2019t there maybe one hour or two, I heard shooting. My neighbor who was\na man, he didn\u2019t run away because he owned a farm nearby. He said the Germans are coming.\nHe probably got wind of it before. We were into like a shelter. I don\u2019t know if it was a shelter\nor maybe an empty cellar, I don\u2019t know. We were there for a few hours, we heard shooting, then\nwe came out and the Germans were here. The next morning, we went outside and we saw\nstrange uniforms, not like the Polish army. We saw a lot of looting, knocking off the stores,\neverything was in disarray. We see whole columns of Germans going towards Warsaw. They\nwere passing our town because Warsaw was north of where we were living",
        "A: I don\u2019t have any perception of time but it was January the 8\", I mean September the 1\u00b0\u2018, the war\nbroke out. I think this was about January 6\". Now I\u2019m reading the stories where the Germans\ncame into Lodz and I see January 6. Being we were just about four kilometers four or five\naway from Lodz, this was about six days or so. It didn\u2019t take long to come up north.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t see any houses, mostly I see, I\u2019m saying about Germans looting\nhouses. The populations looting houses.",
        "A: I have to correct myself. The Poles were looting houses.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see any Germans looting houses. They were looting houses and stores, we\u2019re talking\nabout.",
        "A: Well, okay, I\u2019m going to get to this right now. I\u2019m at this part.",
        "A: So after a day or so, after occupation, my father came back. He didn\u2019t go to Warsaw, he didn\u2019t\ngo to Warsaw.",
        "A: He never made it up there. He decided to come back. He decided to come back so after a\ncouple of days he was home, he decided to go back to the factory where he was. He went back\nto the factory. The factory was not in operation. They put a German commissar in the factory\nbecause it was a Jewish enterprise, was owned by Jews but only Poles were working except my\nfather and my grandfather. They were the only two people working in the factory. He was\nthere maybe for a week or so.",
        "A: No, well, the factory wasn\u2019t in production, don\u2019t forget. They were just sorting things out.\nNobody came to work. They were just straightening materials out and things like this. No\npayroll, nothing. He just wanted to hold on to it because there was nothing else to do. He went\nback to the factory. I don\u2019t think he even got paid for it. They had a German commissar and\nthe German commissar moved; he was a local German, he moved into the quarters where the\nformer people who worked in the office used to live. They kicked them out. After a week or\nso, they dismissed him because he was a Jew. He wasn\u2019t allowed to work. Then one day, I\ndon\u2019t have a perception of time, maybe it was three weeks or four weeks, according to the book\nthat I read now, it didn\u2019t take long, maybe mostly five, six weeks, they said all the Jews have to\nreport to the market square.",
        "A: Yeah. So we all reported to the market square and we were all Jews. I remember we debating\nto take my younger brother with us or not. I don\u2019t think we took him, we left him with our\nneighbors, they were Poles. We went to the market square and maybe we stood there for three,\nfour hours. Anyway, somebody came out and made an announcement, talking about the\nGermans if I say somebody. They gave us three days to leave the city. A lot of people were\nliving up north towards Warsaw, a lot of people -- we left for Lodz to live, for L-o-d-z because\nmy mother had a sister that was there.",
        "A: And my brother.",
        "A: Yeah, we left him with the Poles when we went to the market square but then they let us go.\nThey gave us three days to leave the city. So we assembled everything and we left to Lodz. At\nthat time, we know already they\u2019re going to have a ghetto in Lodz. This was in September. It\nwasn\u2019t before. The Germans came in in September and maybe we left 1n October, November, I\ndon\u2019t remember. Wasn\u2019t even snow on the ground yet because we rented a horse and buggy. It\nwas only about 10, 11 kilometers away. We piled up our few possessions, we took our\nfurniture, we took it into our neighbors, to the gentiles because we figure if the war is going to\nbe over -- everybody was talking about England and France going to join the war, the war\u2019s not\ngoing to last long.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Maybe three, four weeks, five weeks the most. The British, the war\u2019s going to be\nover. We can go back and claim our furniture and our possessions. We took it in for\nsafekeeping. We knew there\u2019s going to be a ghetto. We moved in with my aunt, with a few\npossessions. We were there maybe a week or two weeks but my father was working with\nsomebody -- he was in the office. When I mentioned it that there were two Jews working in the\nfactory, I was talking about two Jews like working people. But in the office, there were a few\nmore Jewish people working over there. One of the Jews, he was really from Lodz, he worked\nat Zgierz and he was commuting because he came with the tramway every morning. We find\nout that he has a lot of-- he knew a lot of people, he\u2019s got a lot of pull. My father went to him\nand asked him if he can help us out; we need some quarters where to live. He sure did. We got\nthat room because apartments were very scarce. They put in the Jews from the city of Lodz\nitself, from all the environs. They put them in a small section and it was the worst section, the\nmost dilapidated section in the city. They assigned us a Jewish quarter. We had one room, just\none room. It served as a kitchen and everything, just one room for four people. Then -- that\nwas in -- yeah, also for the refugees who came from the environs, they opened public kitchens.\nThis was all in the fall of 1939. I even remember the next Passover which was the next spring\nlike April now, was still the public kitchens, we eat in the public kitchens because we were\nrefugees. Then they close the ghetto. May 1\u201c they close the Lodz ghetto.",
        "A: In 1940.\nof September, the Soviets and the Germans split Poland. You were on the German side?",
        "A: I was on the German side.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: My parents were thinking like that. My father had a younger brother. He was a shoemaker by\ntrade and he was much younger. He was unmarried and he went to the Russian side. We also\nheard tales that people came back from the Russian side. My wife, she was living on the\nRussian side. We heard that people have no place to live and they slept in synagogues and there\nwere hungers going around. A lot got caught by the Germans. A lot of people did come back\nbut I guess my parents didn\u2019t have the guts, we didn\u2019t have the nerve and we didn\u2019t have the\nmoney. You had to bribe a lot, 1t cost money for transportation to go even there too. We didn\u2019t\ngo but my uncle did go.",
        "A: He was unattached, he was single. We never heard from him, we never heard from again. I\nnever know what happened, if he vanished, if he survived the war or not. Now, being as you\nbrought my memory back, my father had a younger brother. Also he had another brother, he\nwent towards Warsaw. When they said all able-bodied men had to come and he got killed near\nWarsaw. He did join a unit in the fighting and we never heard from him again. Somebody seen\nhim and he says he got killed. His widow was living in the ghetto.",
        "A: I think Schomik, Schomolos, something like that.",
        "A: Yeah, but he was married.",
        "A: May I, 1940.",
        "A: Okay. They closed the ghetto. My father got a job because we had to live. I mean nobody\ngave anything for nothing. Like I mentioned, this guy, he worked before, he helped us with the\napartment, he also became head of one of the hospitals. They had three hospitals -- first of all\nwhen they closed the ghetto, they had 160,000 Jews. That\u2019s a lot of people. The ghetto was\ncomposed of two sections. In other words, through the main street, the tramway was going.\nThe tramway was going through the ghetto and they had a bridge. The Jews had to cross the\nbridge.",
        "A: If I want to go from one side of the ghetto to the other side, I couldn\u2019t go directly, I couldn\u2019t\ncross the road. They also had a few gates where the horse and buggy traffic went through.\nPedestrians could go through too. The Germans guards there and they open the gate like five\nminutes or so. Let\u2019s say 25 people assembled, 50 people and there were no more traffic\ncoming to the main street because there was barbed wire on both sides; they let the people\nthrough. I\u2019m going to give you, I have the book and a picture. I\u2019m going to give you a clear\npicture of what this thing looked like. I had to go on the other side. My father got a job in the\nhospital.",
        "A: It was on one side, it was on the main side. My aunt was living on the other side. Some of us\nwas commuting, I had friends. At that time in 1940, 1t wasn\u2019t so bad. They still got-- you still\ncouldn\u2019t go out. They were sentries posted shoot to kill; there was barbed wire around day and\nnight and nobody could get in. One section of the ghetto, the cemetery was adjoining it. There\nwas a lot of black market going on and you still could buy food but then times were getting bad.\nThen the Germans requested people for a settlement; it was getting crowded. They brought\nmore people in from the surrounding vicinities from smaller towns. They were liquidating the\nghetto and then they were coming into the Lodz ghetto. As soon as the ghetto got crowded,\nnow I\u2019m reading the books, I know how it was. At that time they were opening the camp in\nKaldum, Humhof, the extermination camp. They had to feed the camp, the factories.\nOstensibly, they were taking -- they were taking some people out for work too, on road crews,\nhealthy men. But they were also taking out people who were sick. They sent to different\ncamps.",
        "A: No, no. They had a bridge, we didn\u2019t need a -- we just claimed a bridge. I didn\u2019t go outside the\nghetto, we just crossed the bridge. If I didn\u2019t want to cross to the bridge, I could wait near the\ngate. Like I mentioned, when no traffic, after 25, 30 people assembled and people assembled\nother side; there are two guards. The German guards now, they open the gates and you were let\nthrough, pedestrian traffic basically. But I think they only had about two or three bridges for\ncrossing, I\u2019m going to show you the picture later on. I gave a map of the ghetto too.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, it was more that that, more than that.",
        "A: It was -- 1f you want to stop this, I can go get the book, maybe they have a scale there. Could\nyou stop there for a minute, I'll be right back. Was in Lynoska N-l-y and Dolna, D-o-l-n-a.\nThis is the relationship, this is the city of Lodz. See here. This is how the ghetto was in\nrelationship to the city. Here was the Jewish cemetery, see it? Now, here is the tramway was\ngoing up. It says Zgierz, 1t was named. This is the Zgierz where I was born. Here was barbed\nwire, just a tramway which is coming through. Here 1s a picture -- I\u2019m going to show you a\npicture what the bridge looked like. Here it 1s, 1t\u2019s a wooden bridge. Here the tram is coming,\nwe went on the bridge to one side to the other.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, right, right. This was a wooden bridge. They had three bridges like that in\ndifferent sections. They had the tramway where we went by. When the tramway came through,\nthe windows were closed. They know with the doors and the windows were locked. I mean the\nGermans locked them in. It didn\u2019t take long to go through the ghetto, maybe in one or two\nminutes. It was very small, they just whizzed by. Now I\u2019m going to show you the Gypsy camp\ntoo. I have a book. I remember this. I remember this guy, a German. A Gypsy camp red,\nmaybe the no, it was very -- dying like fish and Rita says English were dying. Was\nvery few \u2014 Take a look, this is excrement they were carrying. Fifty years ago in Poland the\nworst section of town. They had no toilets or flushing water or things like that.",
        "A: Right, right. Here was the eldest of the Jews, this guy. Well, you read the books, the Jews were\n\u2014 160,000 Jews and some of them got and then they brought in some Jews from\nGermany, from Austria, from Luxembourg. That\u2019s what the guy looks like. He was visiting the\nWarsaw ghetto. I guess they went from one place to another. Here\u2019s what they do with the\nsettlements. Are you familiar with all this pictures, aren\u2019t you?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s the gate, that\u2019s the gate. Assembled here and then they let you through. In\nsome places, they had a bridge. When they had a bridge, there\u2019s no gate. There were not many.\nHere the sign says that Jews\u2019 living quarters, no entry, thing like that.",
        "A: Yes, they did.",
        "A: Yeah, people got killed too there, shot too. Yeah, I remember, sure they got -- but not many.\nThe Lodz ghetto wasn\u2019t like the Warsaw ghetto. It was not smuggling going on. Warsaw was a\nbigger city and a lot of Jews, not a lot, some Jews were living on the Aryan side but not in the\nLodz ghetto because the population was so small. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to run. There\nwas nobody on the other side waiting for you, to receive you or to guide you or to take you\nsome place and hide you. You couldn\u2019t go no place.",
        "A: Yeah, the Poles because you have no chance.",
        "A: Even the bread lines before they closed the ghetto. Like if you find out like a Polish baker\nbread, we went in line, the Poles spotted a Jew, they pointed out to the Germans and throw him\nout. They said yes, there\u2019ll going to one Jew less in the line, they\u2019re going to get an extra loaf\nof bread. This is why all the concentration camps -- I should correct myself -- the extermination\ncamps were in Polish and the Slavic soil like in the Ukraine, in Russia and Poland. Because the\nlocal population was hostile and they couldn\u2019t do it. They couldn\u2019t do this in France and\nBelgium or Holland because enough of the population would help us, or at least there would be\nan outcry about it and things like that",
        "A: Nineteen forty, right. May the 1\u00b0.",
        "A: He was working 1n the hospital.",
        "A: He worked in the hospital.",
        "A: Yeah, I was working too.",
        "A: Well, I tell you, it\u2019s like that. Everybody had to work. I was young like I said when the war\nbroke out, I was thirteen. When I went into the ghetto, I was fourteen, maybe fourteen and a\nhalf. What can a young boy like me do? There was no schooling ,nothing. But I noticed that\nthey had a lot in the ghetto. Like I said, the ghetto was self- administered. They had more or\nless autonomy. From the beginning, the Germans didn\u2019t mix in, they just outside. They figured\nwhy should a German mix in if the Jews themselves can do the job for them? I seen a lot of\nboys. They were like mailmen. They were -- not mailmen -- like they were carrying mail from\none department to another.",
        "A: Yeah, they were highly organized in the ghetto. They had the statistical offices and they had\nmarriage bureaus. They had archives, they had three, four hospitals, they had orphanages.\nNow, I\u2019m talking from the beginning, I\u2019m talking about 1940. I told my father if he can find out\nif I can get a job like this. He knew somebody and we wrote a letter like a petition. He gave it\nto somebody and then I got a response. I got a response for an interview. I came to the office\nand there was a young girl over there and she asked me if I have the strong feet. I says yes so I\ngot the job. The job was good. I don\u2019t remember if I got paid or not but I remember that I got\ntwo soups a day. At that time, you only worked for the food, you didn\u2019t work for pay. I might\nhave got some money too, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Yeah, I was one of the couriers. I was attached to the post office, the main office. From the\nbeginning, then I mentioned, from the beginning before the hostilities between Germany and\nRussia, I\u2019m talking 1940, a lot of Jews in the ghetto were still receiving packages from relatives\nfrom the Russian side. At that time, everything was nice and dandy. We had a post office, we\nhad packages, everything was functioning normally, like this. The Germans, at that time, in\n1940, beginning of \u201941, they didn\u2019t quite decide to exterminate the Jews yet. They put them in\nghettos, they concentrate them in centers but I think the Wannsee started a little bit later on, in\n1942. So that time we still received packages and mail and Jews came from Prague, from\nGermany. They had relatives; there were mixed marriages and mixed partners maybe who\ndidn\u2019t come to the ghetto and they sent packages. It was like a post office, everything was\nfunctioning normally, it wasn\u2019t quite bad. You still could get a lot of stuff on the black market,\nlike food and things like that.",
        "A: Well, I tell you, I\u2019m going to give this now. I don\u2019t remember exactly when but it was quite\nearly, maybe 1942, we heard a rumor that the Lodz ghetto was sealed. Some newspapers were\ngetting through. You could hear some undergrounds, maybe German newspapers, some were\ngetting through. Because don\u2019t forget maybe they throwing through the gate, houses adjoining,\njust like the wall in Berlin. One side was west, one side was east. Somehow news filtered\nthrough. Don\u2019t ask me why, I was young, I was fourteen, fifteen years old but I heard early on,\nmaybe 1942, there\u2019s such a thing that the Germans said they\u2019re going in the shower and instead\nof water, gas comes in. We heard that but nobody believed but we heard it down.",
        "A: From the beginning when somebody died, they had a regular hearse. They didn\u2019t have a motor\nhearse like here but they had horses but then the situation got bad. People were dying from\nhunger and there were too many of them; they just had flatbeds with horses. There were too\nmany, they just piled them up. Like I said, I was like a courier, I was in touch with the post\noffice and everything comes in the mail. Especially they have people, the people, you suffered\nmore than the local, the people who got settled into ghetto like from Germany, from Prague,\nfrom Vienna. The Jews from the west, they didn\u2019t come from a ghetto, they came straight from\ntheir homes. They took just a few belongings, they came to the ghetto, they put them into a\nhostile environment. They had nothing in common with the eastern Jews, with the locals and\nwas wintertime. There was no heating, no fuels, when you came to the houses, you knock on\nthe door, like you had something, a summons for them to report for a settlement or something,\nyou had to go they were all laying in the beds -- were hunger -- they were dying with hunger,\nvery bad. Then we heard about the Gypsies, they were building a Gypsy camp, I remember\nvery well.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the exact date but maybe it was in the book here. But I have no perception of\ntime, don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s been fifty years. But I remember exactly where the place was and they\ndidn\u2019t last long. I could see, in other words, they get . The ghetto wasn\u2019t getting\nmuch food from the Germans outside. But the Gypsies were getting the food from the ghetto.\nCan you imagine how the situation was? There was the Germans -- the German criminal police\nwas in the ghetto. They had a building in the ghetto. They dealt mostly with the Jews were\ninformed by other Jews where was hidden wealth and things like that. Sometimes it was true\nand sometimes it was untrue. They saw them then, they thought maybe -- valuables outside the\nghetto, they had to show them where it was, maybe in the ghetto. They killed them, they\ntortured them, they couldn\u2019t get anything out of them because the man didn\u2019t have it.",
        "A: Well, my mother, like later on everybody had to work so she was working in a kitchen, a\ncommunal kitchen, peeling potatoes and things like this. My younger brother, he was three\nyears younger that I was so if I was fourteen, fifteen, he was only twelve and a half, thirteen. I\nthink he worked in a metal factory. I don\u2019t know exactly what he was doing but everybody had\nto be employed.",
        "A: Yes, because you get food on your job, that\u2019s it. Because the rations were not enough. Like I\nhad two soups a day and maybe he got a soup a day. Everybody got a meager ration, had a\nration card but everybody got a bowl of soup by the place of work.",
        "A: Very, very little.",
        "A: A piece of bread, maybe two kilograms of potatoes. That sometimes have to last you for a week\nand sometimes have to. Sometimes they have to last you for three, four weeks. You could see\nthat the food came in the main gate. They had like an enclave. They had Germans working,\nJews working, and all the food came into this enclave, they processed it\nthrough. They came in with horses and buggies with Polish drivers. Then the Jewish drivers\ntook over. They took it into the ghetto. They unload the material and they brought the wagon\nwith the horses back. While they were going from the enclave out to the distribution corners to\ntake it, they had, they were guarded with Jewish police. They just had armbands, they didn\u2019t\nhave any guns. They were standing on the planks or going behind the wagon if a potato fell off,\nthey picked it up and put it back in the wagon and things like that. Potatoes came in and flour\ncame in and beets came and flour came. Don\u2019t forget, after all they had 160,000 Jews. The\nJews baked their own bread but to work in the bakery was a privilege. You had to know\nsomebody, because you were allowed to eat in the baker, your bellyful, all you can eat. If you\nwork in the kitchen, you could eat all you want. It was a privilege to work in the kitchen or to\nwork in a bakery.",
        "A: Were better off because you had your regular rations plus you ate on the job.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know underground but I know from the beginning, in 1940, I mean the ghetto was really\nclosed but people had connections. Maybe they came through tunnels or maybe they came\nthrough the wires underneath or maybe Jews, they took out Jews for work from the ghetto every\nday from the beginning. They were demolishing houses around the ghetto because the Germans\nwant to build a no-man\u2019s-land around the ghetto. This was near the Jewish quarter and they\nfigure maybe the Jews have a lot of valuables hidden there. They just knocking down whole\nblocks of houses. Maybe outside, maybe they came in contact with Poles or something like\nthat. Maybe some news filtered through. I remembered you went to a barbershop or\nsomething, the latest gossip was exchanged there. Somehow the news filtered through.",
        "A: I was in the ghetto since they closed it off. I left the ghetto in March 10, 1944.",
        "A: The ghetto wasn\u2019t a ghetto then. There was this section but the ghetto was closed in 1940. I\nleft the ghetto in 1944 and my parents were still there. From the beginning I didn\u2019t want to go\nbut they said the Germans need people to work for the settlements. I was hiding and then they\nthreatened they going to take the ration cards away from my parents --.",
        "A: If I didn\u2019t go so eventually I had to report. We had to report --.",
        "A: Oh, yes, constantly.",
        "A: Back in 1942, the Germans put a curfew for one week, nobody could go out or in. The\nGermans are, they didn\u2019t left it up to the Jews then. The Germans themselves, they went to --.\n(End of Side A, Tape 1)\nThey took them to a central place ,a center point. From there they came in to trucks and now\nwe know what happens. They took them to the train station, put them on trucks and the Kelna,\nthe extermination was only 35 kilometers away. They took them right n and the trucks came\nback right away with curfew. One day, like I said my father worked in the hospital; the\nGermans came, they surrounded the hospital, took all the patients out.",
        "A: All of them, all of them. They surrounded the hospital. I t was early in the morning, maybe\nfour o\u2019clock in the morning, they took all the patients out. Then they emptied, on the same day,\nthey emptied all the hospitals, three hospitals. There was a hospital for the insane, they emptied\nthat. They emptied orphanages and took all the kids out. I forgot to mention as my memory\ncomes back, my mother worked in the building, she worked in the orphanage. After this, once\nthey emptied the orphanage, she had no -- then she start working in the kitchen, got a job in the\nkitchen, public kitchen.",
        "A: Yeah, but nobody knew exactly where they took them. Then where the hospital was, the\nGermans made like a factory, a tailor shop or something.",
        "A: No, they came by with trucks. At that time \u2014 now reading the books, we know that that was the\nEinsatzgruppen, the mobile killing units. At that time, they calling the road commander, they\nwere on wheels on big trucks, the road commanders, they come out and they took them by\ntrucks. When I mentioned it, the Germans put a curfew for a week, they took in, from block to\nblock, they took in with the wagons. They took them to an assembly point and then the\nGermans came and took them with trucks or they marched to the train station. Also I want to\nmention that near the cemetery is a section called Marishna near the ghetto, there was a\nsidetrack, a railroad track. They took them all to the settlements, went to this station.",
        "A: By the cemetery, was a big station nearby. The trains were there and they took them on the\nflatcars. That\u2019s where I left, from that station too.",
        "A: Constantly, constantly. Because they were bringing in new people, they were taking out and\nbringing in new people. Otherwise the ghetto would be a quarter of a million people. This way\nthey always emptied it, always empty it. From the beginning, it was up to the local\nadministration who should go. Because the Germans really didn\u2019t care. They said we need\n7,000 people for the settlement, we need 900,000, 50 hundred people so if some people came\nfrom Germany,, from Austria and they were strangers; they were not even resettled yet, they\nwere just living in a building, they just took them. They just need people, they just needed\nnumbers.",
        "A: Weren\u2019t concerned, right.",
        "A: Well, I tell you. I didn\u2019t know any person that did escape but like I mentioned before, we knew\nin 1942, early on, that the people -- they take out a few from the ghetto and they tell you like\nyou\u2019re going to a shower and they give you soap and a towel. Instead of water, gas comes out.\nSomebody must have escaped, don\u2019t forget I was very young then and your mind didn\u2019t believe.\nI was fourteen, fifteen years old but I don\u2019t know who said it, but the news filtered through.",
        "A: My family was there.",
        "A: Okay. The Jews --.",
        "A: They told them they would settle in the east. The ghetto, like I said, was quite a large area and\nthey had like a central prison, the Jews. The people had assembled there, like I said, but some\npeople, they really went for work outside the ghetto. Because they had to go to a commission;\nthey had German doctors and they really needed them to work. But if they took everybody,\nwhole families, you know they didn\u2019t take these people to work. They just said you have to be\nresettled in the east. Like I said, I was hiding; then one day after maybe a week\u2019s time or so, I\nhad to report. So I was there for three, four days in the central prison. I remember my father\ncame the last days towards the barbed wire. I remember the picture just like vividly. I\nremember what he looked like. In Europe he was wearing boots and I remember his face like --\n. So we march, the next morning we march to the train station, we marched, all young people,\nno adult with us. Youngsters, I was there maybe sixteen, seventeen already. They put us in an\nopen cart, put us in one of the good wagons, cattle cars and they closed up. We were riding for\ntwo, three hours. All of a sudden, they open the door. There was a truck waiting there and the\nGermans waiting there. I don\u2019t remember how many people, maybe 50 people from our wagon,\nwhatever it was. Maybe 50, maybe 60, I didn\u2019t count them; they took us to a labor camp. It\nwas in Kielce. It was in southern Poland. It\u2019s spelled K-1-e-l-c-e. I don\u2019t know if you heard of\nit before. They took us over there and we asked how -- I seen them loading up our clothes, our\nbaggage. We had on the truck and then -- they had already a labor camp. That camp still had\nJews already from the surrounding vicinities. The camp was adjoining a factory. The factory\nwas called Hasac. It was a Polish munitions factory before the war or maybe it was just a metal\nfactory, I don\u2019t know. The Germans converted this to a munitions factory. Over there, in\ncomparison to the ghetto, was good because I had plenty food, as much as I want. The only\nthis, you came in contact with the Poles. You work in the factory besides with the Poles. So we\nwent to the barracks after finish the work but they went to their homes. They promised us that\nthey going to give us the clothes, I seen them loading the truck. We ask them, where is the\nclothes, we never got the clothes. I only had what I had on me.",
        "A: What I came on. I don\u2019t know who; I was told later on that the people who run the camp, the\nJews, they bartered away our clothes. This is what I was told, I never seen them.",
        "A: Yeah, I didn\u2019t have -- that\u2019s right. I seen them loading the truck but when I got to the camp, I\nnever see anything. I had an extra sweater, maybe an extra pants, an extra pair shoes. We were\nall probably gone for labor work so everybody took a little bit clothes. They never gave it to us.\nThis was good clothes because we took nothing but the best. I could barter this if I had it. I\nremember I just had one sweater, some I give it away and the Pole, the next day, brought me a\nloaf of bread or something like that. But food was relatively good because the locals, they were\nlocals in the adjoining cities and they probably came with all the clothes. They were bartering\nall the time so they didn\u2019t eat in the commune kitchen. Was always a lot of food. Then at night,\nI could go to the Polish kitchen if they had food left over, they gave us if I worked the night\nshift. In comparison to the ghetto, as far as food was concerned, was gold. I was always\nworried about what happened to my parents, everything seemed unreal. I got up in the\nmorning, everything strange. I worked in the factory; I was making bullets. We put in steel and\nthe machines, if you\u2019re working steel with the machines, had to have oil, constant to the oil.\nLike I said, I don\u2019t have any clothes to exchange nothing so got all over me and I\ndeveloped all blisters. I had all blisters on my knee, on my feet. Because I had no apron, just\nplain clothes and I had nothing to change. Don\u2019t forget I mentioned that I had left in March,\n1944 but then the weather was getting colder. I went out in the morning to work. They\nmarched us from the assembling, we had to march to factory. We didn\u2019t have to march too far,\njust like from here to the light because the camp was attached to the factory. But a cold day, it\nhit my flesh and it was hurting because I had blisters. When I was in that labor camp in Kielce,\nI heard about the invasion, the Normandy invasion in June 6. I heard that. But that time, I\nreally didn\u2019t know where Normandy was; I just heard that the Americans and the British was\nthere, I don\u2019t have any perception of time; maybe the camp, maybe two, three months. It was\nthe summer and then one morning, this camp, we were guarded by the Ukrainians. A Ukrainian\nauxiliary this camp. You mentioned if somebody escaped from the ghetto and I told you I\ndidn\u2019t know of anybody. But from the camp, I did heard that they escaped, from the labor\ncamp. But they caught him and then they brought him back and then they shot him. It was a\ndifferent part of the country, they did escape and they brought him back. This was still in the\nsummertime, after the Normandy invasion. It was in June, maybe July or maybe August, one\nmorning they lined us all up and they say they have to evacuate because the Russian made the\noffensive. They were coming westward so they evacuated us and they put us in open flatcars.\nWe were riding maybe a day or two and then they let us out in an open field. They gave us\nfood; the Germans were debating where they should take us. They didn\u2019t know what to do with\nus -- all the people from the labor camp. Was not a big camp, maybe six, seven hundred people.\nAs I mentioned before, only about 50, 60 people. They had the whole wagons left over but they\ndropped them off in different camps. This camp only attached this car, maybe away to another\ncouple cities, attached like a camp. They didn\u2019t know where to take us, we said why\ncan\u2019t we go back -- we still in Poland -- we said why can\u2019t you take us back to the Lodz ghetto?\nThere\u2019s a lot of Jews over there. One of the guys told us, the Lodz ghetto is being evacuated,\ndismantled now. Right now, we in the field, 1t was still warm, must have been in August. Now\naccording to the books that I read, that was when the ghetto was being liquidated, in July and\nAugust. After a couple of days, we decided and they took us to a place, Shedbush. We still in\nPoland, I find it on the map, wasn\u2019t far away, maybe 25 miles away. Anyway it was all\nyoungsters and we were digging ditches, anti-tank ditches. The organization Todd was in\ncharge, T-o-double-d. It was named after a German, it was a labor battalion or something like\nthat. We came, in the morning, in the daytime we went to dig the ditches and at night we were\nsleeping in barns, in farmers\u2019 barns. But at night, we heard shooting. In the morning we got up\nand we ask the German what is all the shooting? We heard the partisans, they were attacking\nthe German units or something like this in the countryside. So after we dig the ditches, I don\u2019t\nknow, maybe for a week or so, they took us away to Chintzerhau . The Chintz 1S\na -- | think it\u2019s near Upper Silesia -- it\u2019s a very well known Polish city. The Polish Madonna --\nChintz is on the Polish-German border not far away in Upper Silesia. The same\nfactory with the same work that I did in Kielce that I did in Chintz . Over there, I met\nmy friend. I met my friend which I still keep up to now; he is in New York.",
        "A: His name is -- well he changed his name. His name is now Herbert Lewis. He\u2019s got a better\nrecollection than I have. He remembers more than I do. Somehow my memory fades but he\u2019s\ngot a very good recollection and I met him. I remember the day; he was wearing boots. Over\nthere maybe you worked about maybe for a month or two, was all , 1944, remember.\nWe went in the morning --. He wasn\u2019t in Kielce with Gara; he was in a different camp. He was\nin Scarzilsco. By then, when the Germans came, they evacuated everybody and every able-\nbodied men they put in --. He came in Chintz and I met him. We were working in\nthe same factory. I don\u2019t know if we worked there for a month or six weeks. Anyway, it was\nstill the same year; the Germans came one morning, rounded us up and marched us to the train\nstation. They put us on cattle cars and I could see that the local population, they were running.\nWe heard distant shooting. I don\u2019t know, rumors spread in our ranks that the Russians are\nentering the city on the other side but it wasn\u2019t true yet. I could see the Germans were loading\nthe big guns on the trains, the German army. Anyway they put us on cattle cars. We were gone\nfor three or four days and we wind up in Germany. We find out that they took us \u2014 we went to\nBuchenwald in the concentration camp. Over there they opened up, we came to Buchenwald\nand everybody was eating up whatever they had in the food packages with them. They were\ndiscarding the Polish money and the German Reich marks. After two, three hours, we went to\nsit in barracks. They had -- Buchenwald was a big camp, was about 60,000 inmates at that\ntime. It was established early in 1933. Right now, I know it was a political camp. In\nBuchenwald heather on the ground. But that time I didn\u2019t realize, I didn\u2019t realize that. Anyway\nwe registered and all the inmates did all the work. They ask us where we come from, your\nmother\u2019s name, your father\u2019s name and all this stuff. After registration, we went to a big hall.\nWe had to take all the clothes that we wear and before I left Poland, I mentioned that before I\nleft the ghetto, my mother told me that you have an aunt in Paris which I did have, her sister.\nShe says you have a cousin in Belgium and she gave me addressed envelopes and things like\nthat and says maybe you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going. Maybe you\u2019re going to need it one\nday. But when I went to Buchenwald and I had family pictures, my mother, my younger\nbrother, I had to put everything on the table. All the clothes, everything on the table and I only\nremember one German. A black uniformed German came in, we all had to 0 to commission.\nHe looked at my legs because like I said, from the dirty oil, I don\u2019t know what I blubbered up in\nGerman. He says, he just looked at me and was thinking, thinking. He just motioned at a line\nso I went over there. We had to go in first to a shower. I remember we just looking 1s water\ncoming in or gas coming out. Water was coming out and then we had to all to go in. They had\na big disinfection tube, was maybe like this room. Had to jump in, oh I had all scabs over here -\n-- was burning and burning. Before this, I forgot, after I took all the clothes off and everything,\nwe went to a different room. The inmates were all, the inmates had clippers. They clipping the\nhead, clipping hair, clipping hair, all over there. Then we were all clipped up. We had to jump\ninto this tub, this disinfect thing. Oh, it was burning something terrible. Then we jumped out.\nThis was January, was already January. knows, January 18, according to the record, I\ngot there, January 18. We went up from this tube, oh yeah, after we got up from the tube, I\nremember going up a flight of stairs. They gave me clothes. They gave me a pair boots, shoes,\nno socks. They gave me pants but no underwear. They gave me a jacket but no shirt. I didn\u2019t\nhave the striped jacket, just because, don\u2019t forget, it was January and it was already chaos in all\nthose camps. They had so many people come from Germany, I didn\u2019t even have a tattoo. I just\nhad an assigned number. They gave me all these clothes. Then we went out to the other end of\nthe barracks where we stand for two, three hours until we assigned a barrack. Here it\u2019s January,\nit\u2019s cold.",
        "A: You\u2019re wet, you\u2019re unshaved and all this stuff. Then they assigned us a barrack. In the\nbarracks, then I lost my friend. He got assigned a different barracks. You had to slide in and\nyou had to slide out. You couldn\u2019t go in. At night, if you had to go someplace, to the bathroom,\nyou were afraid to go if you leave your place. Because if you\u2019re placed in, nobody\u2019s going to\nlet you back in.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t slide in, whatever you had to do, you had to make it on the spot. There was only\nstraw there, there was no --. You had no blanket, they don\u2019t give you a blanket, we use straw.\nTo be exact, they were looking like shelves, like bins. Like you see the pictures, you slide in\nand slide out. I was in this barracks and then later on -- when I was in the barracks, I met my\nfriend. But first of all, they had kapos in the barracks. I didn\u2019t know what the word kapo\nmeans but I know people came to us and he says you people are newcomers? I says yes. I says\nwho is your leader. We called, one was a Jewish policemen in the labor camp was this. They\nwant to find out how we are treated .If we told him; we are treated by our own people, they kill\nhim on the spot. Because they say we want to do an example, in case they take your people out\nfor labor for a day or two to the city and somebody is going to inform on you, your own\npeople; when he comes back, he\u2019s going to have the same thing. He says we\u2019re\norganizing the thing. I remember one guy, he was the head of the camp. He came to us and\nsays, don\u2019t say anything bad. Because we always thought maybe we came from the ghetto from\nLodz, they didn\u2019t give us our clothes, we could have lived better. Buy different food, but I\ndon\u2019t know what happened to him. Maybe somebody else squealed on him, maybe not, I don\u2019t\nknow. I was in that camp and then I met my friend, it was nice. The first day, when I assigned\nmy rations, I put it in my pocket. I figure I\u2019m going to eat it later on. You get one day of\nrations, a piece of bread and a bowl of soup so I figure I\u2019m going to eat the bread at night. So at\nnight, I went to eat, the bread was gone. Somebody slipped it out and I didn\u2019t feel it. I figured\nout, don\u2019t ask me know but I don\u2019t know. I remember one thing, I sewed up my pockets. Don\u2019t\nask me where I got the needle and where I got the thread. Somebody must have had it. I\npunched a hole in the jacket through here and I was slitting out to here. While I was in this\nbarrack, they took out people for work, the kapos. They had people in the barracks, they had\npeople -- Germans, they had Russians who preceded us to Buchenwald. Some people who\ncame maybe in 1939, in 1940, in 1938, they were in charge of the barracks, they were in charge.\nThe kapos, they had to go to a special appellplatz, the main camp where they counted them. We\nhad to go to a different spot too. Sometimes, we stayed for two, three hours in the snow, don\u2019t\nforget it was January. The snowflakes they were falling; he counted us up, then dismissed.\nThen dismisses, you went into a cold barrack. If you had a piece of bread left over in the\nmorning, you ate it. If not, nothing. In daytime, in the morning, we heard a whistle blowing.\nThey took us for work, from the barracks, just to drag wood because you have to remember that\nBuchenwald was carved out from a forest. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar or not. It\u2019s ten miles\naway from Weimar. It\u2019s a lot of birch trees and forest. Maybe they need the wood, maybe they\ndidn\u2019t need it. They just make you work. They don\u2019t let you just stay around idle. They were\ntaking us out for work every day.",
        "A: No, I remember I was dragging wood. I don\u2019t remember where I was dragging it, maybe\nputting it in one pile, taking to the other pile, everybody had to work. Over there -- I was doing\nthis maybe for a month or for two months. Then all of a sudden, one day, they announce they --\n-. Then we heard, like I told you, the kapos had a separate room in the barracks. Have you ever\nbeen to service in the army?",
        "A: No. In the barracks itself, they had a couple rooms, in the barracks carved out for the kapos.\nThey weren\u2019t exactly mean, they were kapos, they were in charge of the barracks, know what I\nmean?",
        "A: No, well in this instance they happened to be --. I knew a couple of them were Russians, two,\nthree Russians. One of them was German. Maybe they were ex-prisoners of war. Or maybe\nthey were just taken to Germany for labor and somehow they wind up in a conservation camp.\nI didn\u2019t ask any specific. I know one was -- a couple were German. One was a green triangle,\nmeans he was a criminal prisoner. One had a red triangle, means he was a political. Outside the\nbarracks, they had detached, like a small cottage. They were only German, kapos. They were\nnot kapos but I don\u2019t know what they were doing. They were prisoners, they were dressed\nnicely, they had red triangles and they were in boots, they were nice. They didn\u2019t take --they\nhad connections in the camp but they were prisoners, you know what I mean?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether they were treated better than --. But if somebody had to do manual labor,\nthey were in charge of the auto workmen. If somebody had to drag woods, he didn\u2019t have to\ndrag the woods.",
        "A: Sure. We have the kapos differently But if he was a maybe he wasn\u2019t abused to other\nprisoners but you had to do it. But they had to go to the appells too. So all of a sudden, one\nday they announce they evacuated Buchenwald. I heard the kapos talking, they bombed, the\nAmericans are already in Erfut. Erfut spelled E-e-f-u-t. You ever heard of the word, Erftut?\nIt\u2019s not far from Weimar. Buchenwald was near Weimar, ten miles away. They would be here\nsoon so they took the Jews. They\u2019re taking the Jews.",
        "A: That must be in February because it was still cold. Was a very short span. I was only three\nmonths in Buchenwald so I can go back, was in February. So they say\u2019, they going to evacuate,\nthey going to take the Jews. All the Jews have to report. I knew if they take the Jews, I know\nwhat\u2019s going to happen.",
        "A: To report. They were all mixed in this camp, mixed Jews and non-Jews, and\nFrenchmen. They said all the Jews have to report, evacuated. So the way they did that, they\nsays, they emptied all the barracks in a big place, in a big square and they says everybody on\nthis side. Then they have this kapo, lined up, like I said, Russians, Germans, and you had to\napproach. If they recognize a Jew, you\u2019re on this side in there. I passed by, they knew me but\nthey let me through.\nA They let me on the other side . I didn\u2019t go in the Jewish transport. I don\u2019t know. Maybe they\ndidn\u2019t recognize me, I didn\u2019t ask any questions. He just send me so I didn\u2019t go with the Jewish\ntransport. Then another day, they did the same thing. I hid underneath the barracks. Some\nkapos came in and they pull us out from underneath the benches. I remember somebody gave\nme a kick and my back was hurting maybe for a week or so. Then I met my friend. He was\nhiding too, he was in a different barracks. Finally they says, everybody has to go. So\neverybody has to go, alright. So we line all up and we went to the main camp to Buchenwald.\nThey kept us there in a big hall. Don\u2019t ask me what kind, I remember it was a big hall, they\nkept us overnight and the next day too. Towards dusk, they says, now we\u2019re going to go to the\ntrain station. They let us out from the big, looked like a factory type building. I would\nrecognize it now. Now you have to describe, they had the German SA, youngsters, one side.\nThey had big bat and we had to this and they were beating you.",
        "A: Like a gauntlet right. I want to say like a gangplank but I don\u2019t want to use the word, a\ngangplank is like aramp. You know like a gangplank. I don\u2019t remember if I received a blow, if\nI didn\u2019t receive the blow.",
        "A: Yeah, they had three, four on this on this side; three or four on this side. Then the other side,\nthey lined us up; they lined us up.",
        "A: Clubs, or bats or truncheons. Maybe they had plain stakes. Who remembers? You see all these\nthings lie down, they beating the things, you don\u2019t pay attention what it was. Who knows what\nit was, I don\u2019t remember. Anyway after you went through this gauntlet, they lined us up and it\nwas already dusk like I said and we marched to Weimar. The Germans marched us to Weimar. I\nremember they had big dogs on the sides, big German shepherds. They came to the train\nstation, I think it was really dark. They put us in open flatcars, was already dark, maybe ten,\neleven o\u2019clock at night. I don\u2019t have any perception of time. The trains start moving. So the\ntrains start moving; we moved overnight and then in the daytime, planes came and shot up,\nQ\u201d They shot up at the train\u201d.",
        "A: At the train. Somebody asked what is the name of this place? I heard them say Zeis. I don\u2019t\nknow, someplace in Germany, Zeis, Z-e-1-s. I think right now, I\u2019m not so sure but I heard Zeis\nwhere they make optical equipment over there. You heard of that thing?",
        "A: It says we in Zeis or something like that. Maybe where -- then the Germans assembled another\nlocomotive after the planes left and we were riding again. Then the planes came and shot up\nagain. So they assembled us all in columns I don\u2019t know, maybe 5,000 people. Don\u2019t forget\nthey say they empty Buchenwald, not all of them. They marched us to Flossenburg. This is\nanother camp. I don\u2019t know how you spell Flossenburg, it\u2019s near Weiden. Right now I\u2019m\nreading all the books. I\u2019m interested because I lived this period; I know that right now from\nhistory was a criminal camp. One of the German, Admiral Kanaris, he was head of the German\nUpfeur, German intelligence. He got hung up over there. In the middle of the story or not.\nOver there, was even worse than Buchenwald because we were sleeping --. I was with my\nfriend there from New York and we sleeping that camp maybe for a week or so. Then they say\nthey evacuated Flossenburg. Thy marched us out from Flossenburg to the train. That was in the\nmorning, maybe eleven o\u2019clock. I think it was on a Sunday, I don\u2019t know why I remember\nSunday but I have stuck in my head, Sunday. I know the sun was shining high and the train\nstation was right outside of the camp and they loading us in open boxcars, listen to that. The\ntrains didn\u2019t even start moving yet. All of a sudden, I see planes from far away. Big planes in\nthe sky and the sun shines on them, I think that was the jet age coming out. In a second, they\nwere right over the train -- shot everything up. All of a sudden, I heard something hit my face.\nI asked my friend, do I have blood on my face? He just looked, he says no. But I looked up\nand I see that we were not moving yet. They had a big sign, crossing written down in German,\nmade out of wood. A crossing sign, you know, maybe one of the splinters, some bullet too, hit\nme in the face. But nothing was bleeding, it was nothing, something hit me. When the planes\nshot up the train, everybody jumped off the train so I jumped off the train too. The Germans\nwere running to the farmhouses, to the nearby houses. I run after them too. I heard them, run\ninto German, must have been a German house or something, I wasn\u2019t the only one, maybe there\nwere dozens of legs, we run with the guards.",
        "A: We were running. The guard says, I heard him, I understood this much German. He says, the\nAmericans must have a base nearby because the plane left already. They going to be coming\nback. But then after everything was over, the guards came back. We came back to the train too.\nBut not everybody went with the guards.",
        "A: No, some of them stayed with the -- on the wagons. They were going through the packages, the\nGermans\u2019 knapsacks.",
        "A: Just with them open. They took out the cigarettes, they took out the food. When the Germans\ncame and they saw what\u2019s going on, they lined everybody up. They searched everybody. They\nfound food on them and cigarettes and lined them up and killed them on the spot. After a while,\nthey assembled us all and the train start moving again, whoever was left. The ones who was\nkilled, I don\u2019t know if they buried them or left them on the side or took them back to camp. The\ncamp was maybe a few miles outside. We didn\u2019t even left ----- . We were riding\nagain, maybe for a day or two. Planes used to come, the Americans and British were already\nnearby. They didn\u2019t have far to go. They were already in France. They shooting at the planes.\nThe guard says, some of them just flew over and they didn\u2019t come down low so the guard says\nover there they\u2019re your friends. If they come over, you wave to them, so we waved, we had no\nchoice, we waved. Some just flew over, they didn\u2019t do anything. Sometimes they came down\nlow. When they came down low, the guards run out. Some of us were packed in the station.\nWhen the planes came over, I could see the tracer bullets. I could see them just like rains, hard\nrains you can see them. I jumped off the train. I hid underneath the wagon where the planks\nare.",
        "A: Where the tracks are. I just lay there and I could see the guards, were all on the train. After\nthis, after 1t was all over, we went back. I remember it was British planes. Why do I know it\u2019s\nBritish? Because I could see the wheel, the mark with the red.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, like a bull\u2019s eye. They came very low. I could see the markings then. Then they\nshot up the locomotive. Then we left another day and the same thing happen. Here they come\nagain.",
        "A: Every day, sometimes twice a day. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been in Bavaria or Germany;\nthey have thick tunnels over there, you know tunnels. As soon as they\nheard the air drone or something like this, the locomotive detached itself and it went for the\nnearest tunnel. After the ride was over, if the locomotive was intact, 1t wasn\u2019t shot up, they\ncould use it. It came back and they pull off again. But if the locomotive didn\u2019t have time, they\nhad to get something else. But anyway, they shot up a locomotive the last time and they\ncouldn\u2019t get anybody so a big fat German says, everybody line up. Whoever cannot -- we going\nto march from now on. Whoever cannot march doesn\u2019t have to worry, we going to provide\ntransportation. I know what transportation means. I was the first in line. Now I can see how\nlucky I am because, don\u2019t forget, I was in this labor camp, like I mentioned before the food was\nrelatively good. I could barter, the locals, so 1t was more food left for me. I was in the kitchen\nat night and it was food and the camp was only for about three months so I was in relative good\nhealth. I was in the first line over there. We marched all night, me and my friend from New\nYork. Then at night, we wind up near the roadside and we took a little bit leaves and they says\nyou\u2019re going to spend the night over there. The next night the same thing. But the third night,\nwas raining bad. I got soaked all through, all wet. Whoever fell out of line, if you read the\nstory about Bataan or Corregidor, the same thing. I was ready, my friend was ready, I was ready\nto go the roadside but my friend who lives in New York, he says, come on.",
        "A: He pulled me, yeah. I was tripping over wires because they were shooting. The planes were\ncoming down, two, three times a day. All the wires were down, it was dark. I was ready to give\nup; he says, he grabs me he says you got to keep ---. So towards -- that was at night. We were\nmarching all night, all wet, you couldn\u2019t walk, soaked through. Towards morning, it was\nalready daybreak, we stopped on a farm and they put us in barns. They says you\u2019re going to\nrest here, the guards. All of a sudden, decide to take us all out for punishment because\nsomehow, somebody, they were messing up the barns. There were no toilets there. They were\nlining everybody up. They going to take us to a march or maybe, who knows. The Germans\nhad a tendency. If somebody did any infractions, they lined everybody up and they picked\npeople at random. They lined them up and they says I\u2019m going to pick every third man, or\nevery tenth man. They just pull them out and they just shot them just for no reason at all. So\nmaybe they tried to do the same thing this time. When they were getting ready, everybody lined\nup, we heard shooting. So the German says everybody back inside the barn. Then the shooting\nintensified. Like I mentioned, it\u2019s a barn. A barn has slits so some of the inmates looked --.\nBefore I mention that, for some reason an egg fell down, a chicken egg fell down and my friend\nwas nearby. We took the egg and we split it in half, a fresh egg. While we were sitting in the\nbarn, like I mentioned before, it was raining all night and the barn is warm near the hay and the\nstraw, our clothes is steaming. We heard the shooting and we looked out. Some of the inmates\nsays, the Russians are here. They saw the stars. At that time, we didn\u2019t know the American\ntanks have stars too. We know the Russians have stars. Then we notice in the front of the barn\nthe guards taking white handkerchiefs, or white rags or whatever it was white and put on the\nfront of their rifles. You know what I am talking about?",
        "A: I was one of the last ones to get out of the barn. I got out of the barn just like you see in a\nmovie picture. Everything burns around you. You\u2019re a farmhouse; a farmhouse burns here; a\nbarn burns here. All the inmates in the thousands, all running wild. All uniforms, all kind of\nuniforms. Don\u2019t forget they evacuated the camp like Buchenwald in the thousands. The\nGermans had the transport too with them. They had the carts and the horses and some motor\ntransports. All of a sudden you see the inmates they robbing the wagons and all the stuff. I\nwent to a wagon too, seeing some German boots. I had no shoes, I put on a pair of boots. I had\nno size, just pulled them on. Like I mentioned before, don\u2019t forget, I said I sewed up the\npockets. I go over there and I see a big German woman. She has a big country bread all\naround. She cut slices and here the inmates stay and everybody gets a big slice of bread. Take\na big, line the lines, she gives me a slice of bread too. Then I go to the next house and I see raw\npotatoes outside. I take these raw potatoes and I start packing them inside. I\u2019m all weighed\ndown, heavy. I go the next farmhouse, somebody preceded me already. They all Russian\ninmates, Russian- speaking inmtes.",
        "A: They already killed the chicken. They already picking the feathers off. Somebody very quick,\nthey were right there. Maybe they got liberated 15, 20 minutes before, who knows. Then we\nsaw tanks rumbling by and they throwing down cigarettes. Then we go to a clearing and we\nsaw tanks parked and we go over to somebody. Somebody ask what language you speak. We\nsaid, well we from Poland. We find a Polish-American. He speaks in broken Polish. He goes\nto the truck and brings the care rations up. Now I know they care rations, the cheese and the\ncandy was there. Somebody gets us cigarettes and I start to smoke. I\u2019m all dizzy. So I go to\nthe next village. The village not far away, maybe three miles. Don\u2019t forget there are thousands\nof people in the villages. I see a German stays outside. I says food, essen. He says, yah, yah,\ncome inside. I thought I\u2019m going to be the only one. I think I went with somebody too.\nSomebody was besides me there. I go in and the place is full. They\u2019re already sleeping on the\nbed and under the table. Here\u2019s coffee. I says coffee and he says yah, coffee, coffee, eggs,\neggs, milk. Anyway I ate eggs and the next day my stomach was sick. I\u2019m sick and in the\nmeantime they catching -- don\u2019t forget next day after the war, they bringing Germans back to\nrecognize a guard here and some beaten to death, some all bloodied up. They picking German\nup from the house, inmates all over, in the thousands, Russians, ex-prisoners, they\u2019re stronger\nthan Iam. I\u2019m young, I\u2019m 16, they\u2019re stronger than Iam. I\u2019m young, I\u2019m 16, they\u2019re in 30\u2019s,\n35. They entered the war, they know all about it. That was the liberation day.",
        "A: Yeah. It\u2019s going to be this week, this 23\" of April. I always thought the 24\" and I call my\nfriend in New York. He says the 23\u2122 of April. As a matter of fact, because the paper I just\nshow you from the tracing bureau, it doesn\u2019t say when I was liberated but it (End of Tape 1)",
        "A: I went to Schwandorf and I heard the Jews were assembled, all the ex-prisoners over there.\nThey made a and the women ex-prisoners, they went nuts on the kitchen. I don\u2019t\nknow if I should say it on tape, that\u2019s the first time I saw a black person. All of a sudden, I see\nan American army transport pulls up; I saw the blacks of the transportation department. At that\ntime the army thing was still segregated then. A guy opens the tailgate and I take a look and I\nsee black hands. I just looked -- the first time . That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen one, I didn\u2019t see it,\nthat\u2019s it. Okay so I was in that home and I didn\u2019t have much clothes. Some of them, like I said,\nsome of the ex-inmates were smarter and wiser than I am, some of them went to German homes\nand who was an ex-Nazi. They says, listen, you were a Nazi or you were the buegermeister,\ngive me some clothes, give me that. So they came with clothes, with sweaters and jackets. I\nwas young, I was 17, 18, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do. I want to go back to Poland.\nDon\u2019t forget, this happened in April and I left home in March, the ghetto, about a year I think\nsince I left home. I still was homesick, I was thinking about Poland and my brother and my\nsister. At that time, don\u2019t forget the first week, we didn\u2019t know the extent, what happened with\nAuschwitz and all the sick, Kelman and all this concentration camp. I still wanted to go back to\nPoland. I was in this home. All of a sudden, American soldiers came, one or two, I don\u2019t\nremember. He was a Jewish American soldier. He says we are in tents here on the outskirts of\nthe city in Scheondorf. We are in camp, we need about three, four volunteers who wants to go\nto work. Like washing pots and pans in the kitchen. I says, I volunteer to go. I went and\nanother couple boys and maybe two, three boys. We had a ball, all the oranges we want to eat\nand had a couple of -- I had an Italian cook, an American cook, Italian. from Chicago,\na few Polish words and he made spaghetti and it was good. Oh the spaghetti, anything, I didn\u2019t\nmind to wash the pots and pans. All of a sudden, chewing gum and candy; they were living in\ntents on the outskirts of the city. In the evening, they brought us back to that house where we\nsleeping over there. The next morning, he said would you like to come back tomorrow, I says\nyes. The truck came like 8 o\u2019clock, 9 o\u2019clock, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Picks us up, the three or four boys went out to camp. This lasted about for three weeks. Then,\nhe said well, we have to leave, we have assignments. We have to pull down the tent, we\u2019re\ngoing to Nuremberg. I remember it was a big tall guy, an American, don\u2019t ask me the name, I\nforget. I don\u2019t know if he was a sergeant or not and he says we\u2019re going to Nuremberg. He said\nbut we going to come back and get you boys. I didn\u2019t think anything of it. He\u2019s leaving, he\u2019s\nleaving. After maybe two, three weeks, this guy shows up. He shows up and he says you want\nto go to Nuremberg? I says sure. I had no relatives, nothing attached. I didn\u2019t have to pack\nbecause I had nothing, maybe I acquired an additional sweater or maybe an additional pair\npants, I don\u2019t remember. There\u2019s nothing to speak of, I just took it and he picked us up and\nwent to Nuremberg. In Nuremberg, there were tents too. I don\u2019t remember what the name of\nthe engineer or Battalion of Engineering or something like that. Then, the same thing, all the\nfood and all the --.",
        "A: Yeah, no, no money, nothing. Maybe whatever it is, they gave us clothing, they gave us shoes,\narmy fatigues, army boots, whatever you need \u2014 a shirt, underwear, green underwear. Then they\nsaid, all of a sudden, they had to leave too, after two, three months. By that time, I was working\nover there, I also find out that the size of this was Nuremsbek. There 1s a sizeable Jewish\ncommunity in Furt. Furt, it\u2019s Bavaria too. It\u2019s spelled F-u-r-t. We took the streetcar from\nNuremberg and you went to Furt. They had Jewish community there and they were all\nnewcomers and had a home too. Just like a house but I was not living in this house. I think we\nall had a tent to ourselves, was handy there. At that time came to go too. So they said they\u2019re\ngoing back to the United States but before they say, they pack for their vacation. They going to\nleave from Marseilles, France. So they had two choices. We can either leave you in Germany\nand find you another job with the American army or we can give you back to France. At that\ntime France was right after post-war in \u201945, they could bring across the border. You know in\n\u00b045, is everything chaos still. He says -- we figure, well if they going to dump us off in France,\nwe\u2019re on our own, don\u2019t know anybody. Here I find up, the community of Furt and things like\nthat. I felt already a little bond. So he says why don\u2019t you find us a job here? Next to the\nwhere they had the tents, was the American hospital. I have letters from the hospital. They\ngive letters of recommendation, 381*' Evacuation Hospital or something like this. We decide to\nwork over there and they give us quarters and they give us food. Like I said, we had all the\nclothes, we had a room. Inside, was no tents, already in the hospital, had separate rooms, three,\nfour boys. In the morning, we just went to work in the kitchen. We were not cooking; they had\narmy cooks. You know what we were in charge? We were lighting the stoves. You remember\nthe field army stoves, are you familiar with that?",
        "A: You pump gas and you clean them and you repair them. Over there, I don\u2019t know. I work for\nthe hospital for three, four years. I think later on and I got paid for that too --but it\u2019s so long\nago. I think later on they transfer because they had German civilians working too. We went in\nthe German economy. Then, like I said, my friend, the one I spend the war with, he found\nhimself a job too. He found himself a job in the adjoining city with the American army too. He\ntold me he heard -- heard a lot of the people who are liberated, they go to America. They have\nrelatives but I didn\u2019t have anybody so nothing to claim. Then he told me that if you go to\nMunich, Congress passed a law, he told me the American government -- I didn\u2019t know the\ndifference between Congress and no Congress that some displaced person they can register with\nthe Joint. He went first and he came back, he says yes, you can register. I went there too and I\nregistered and I had a very easy time because after the war I worked. I had recommendations\nfrom the army, had a good police record. Then I registered and I was -- oh yes, then I think that\nI went to be on my own. I still worked for the hospital, I worked for a while but I didn\u2019t want to\nlive over there. Because in the evening I want to be free. I want to be with my own people and\nI put an ad in the paper. I\u2019m looking for a room. Rooms are very hard to get in Germany after\nthe war. But I mentioned, I want to mention that a lot of German Jews came back, German\nJews after the war. They were liberated or some maybe were never in a camp; they were mixed\nmarriages and maybe the Germans didn\u2019t touch them. Anyway I went once to a service in\nNuremberg, Jewish service. There were a lot of German Jews there who came back from\nTheresienstadt and things like that. I find out that they had very high positions in the post-war\ngovernment in Germany right after the war. I want to live on my own. I talked to them and one\ntold me he works in this ministry, the other in the other ministry. So I put an ad in the paper, I\nwant to be on my own for a room. I got a response like in a post office box. I went to look at\nthe room and the room was right near the Palace of Justice, near the military tribunal, where\nthey tried the Nazis. As a matter of fact, the building was right across the street, I seen the\nSoviets on the balcony. They were living there too. The people who were attached to the\nJustice, to the Russian delegation. Anyway I looked at the room and the lady asked me what I\ndo. I told her I am working at the hospital. She says yeah? I says I\u2019m Jewish. She says oh,\nyeah. After the war, everybody had a Jewish relative. She says you know what, I registered\nthis room, she says, with the government because I don\u2019t want them to assign me a newcomer\nfrom -- an ethnic German from the displaced, from Schlis _ or something like this. If you\ncan get it, if somehow you can bring a certificate that you want the room. I made contact with\nthis German ministry. I tell him, listen I have a room but I need assignment. No problem, he\ngave me an assignment, I was living over there. Then my papers came through. They call me\nto the council. I had to give the birth certificate. I don\u2019t have a birth certificate, if you come\nfrom Europe, everything was taken away. That was relatively easy, you find people from your\nhometown. They know I\u2019m from Poland so I had this witnesses where I was born, where I\u2019m\nfrom and I assembled different papers. We get them translated into English. I went for the\ninterview. Finally I got to America.",
        "A: I came August 31, 1949. Before I came to America, I was in a camp, in a transit camp. N the\ntransit camp, they give you orientation, what to expect in America. They gave you a booklet,\nwhat you should expect. They gave you a booklet in your own language, whatever you read the\nbest. I took a book in Polish because I understood this language the best. They say, the booklet\nis from -- it say Washington, D.C. is the seat of the government and New York is a big city and\nthings like that. So I read all about it. I came on the ship . It took us eight days.\nI didn\u2019t get sick on the boat, a lot of people sick around me. The boat came to New York harbor\nlike in the evening. All of a sudden when you come from Europe, from post-war Europe and\nwe were outside in the harbor, we didn\u2019t go into New York harbor. We just stayed there\novernight but you could see the cars moving, they looked like, it\u2019s a sight when you come from\nEurope and you don\u2019t see all the streets and the lights and fire way over --. Everything is alive,\nyou see New York City. Especially when you see from far away. Maybe it was five miles\naway, out to the harbor. We stayed overnight on the boat. When the mist start lifting in the\nmorning, I don\u2019t know whether it was August, it got daylight maybe 5 o\u2019clock, maybe 5:30 , I\ndon\u2019t know, it was already mist. I went outside. We couldn\u2019t sleep already all night, passed the\nStatue of Liberty. I read of the Statue of Liberty in the book so I knew the Statue of Liberty.\nWe passed it and the boat anchored. Then immigration came on the board. We had papers and\neverything. I became legitimate. We didn\u2019t go to Ellis Island. They put a pin on my lapel. I\ncame through the Joint distribution. Somebody sponsored me but I don\u2019t know who did. It\ncame tShe group but somebody must have did it. They had different nationalities. They always\nhad to have Catholics, they came to Catholic organizations, they had Jewish, they came to a\nJewish organization. Maybe they had Quakers through a different organization. Anyway, these\ndifferent organization, my pin, they came towards me. I didn\u2019t know this people but they could\ntell.",
        "A: They approached me. They said, yeah. Well, I spoke a little bit English but they assign people\nlike to speak in --.",
        "A: Translators, they spoke like Yiddish, Americans who spoke Yiddish. They took us over there.\nMy luggage consisted of an old valise, lock-top and springs, they had no problem. He still had\nto go through customs. Now I know they\u2019re customs, they open up and they\u2019re looking. They\nassign you right there. You go on the other side and you get doughnuts and coffee. Doughnuts\nand coffee and then I saw a Yiddish-speaking woman comes to me. Remember that I had\nnothing to carry. I didn\u2019t need a porter. She says you come with me. I remember riding\nescalators. It must have been Penn Station or something, I don\u2019t know. I remember going to\ntaxi, another taxi, maybe it was. I remember riding escalators and taking with the gate. There\nwere a lot of people outside the gate0. She says, she gives me two tickets and she says, you\ngoing to Washington D.C. When the gate opens up, there will be a train there. When the people\ngo down, she didn\u2019t even wait until the gate opens up, when the people go down, you go down\nthe stairs and you get on the train with the other people and you get off in Washington D.C.",
        "A: Well, I tell you. Right now, I cannot think of any reason because I put in my papers that I\nworked in the American army in the kitchen. Maybe they figured there\u2019s a lot of hotels in\nWashington, D.C., maybe he can find a job in a -- I don\u2019t know. They sent me to Washington,\nD.C.. They just send me there, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to Washington, D.C. and they gave me\nthree dollars. She gave me three dollars, three American dollars and says, you buy lunch on the\ntrain. She says in Washington, D.C. you wear this pin and somebody is going to approach you.\nOkay, so the gate opens up and everybody goes down. The doors slide open and I go inside.\nEveryone sits down and I sit down too. Now I\u2019m ready \u2014 I says I got to go to Washington, D.C.\nThey said how about I miss it, but I read Philadelphia in the book. They told you about the\nLiberty Bell \u2014 they have all these things written down in the book. All of a sudden I spot\nAmerican Legionnaires and they had Washington, D.C. on Legionnaires\u2019 cups. So I thought to\nmyself when they get off, I\u2019m going to get off too. I had doughnuts and I had the coffee and I\nhad the three dollars in my pocket. I said I\u2019m not going to spend the three dollars to buy lunch\nbecause I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to get an American dollar next. I will not go in and have\nno . What I\u2019m going to do, I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t spend the lunch and didn\u2019t buy\nanything. I\u2019m getting off in Washington, D.C.. Everybody 1s getting off the train. At that time\nthe train wasn\u2019t yet the jet industry developed. The train was already a , 1f somebody\ntraveled by train especially in 1949, Union Station was crowded. Everybody getting off, I\u2019m\ngetting off. I\u2019m getting off waiting the main concourse, the main hall. I\u2019m just waiting there. I\nhave the valise. I have my best clothes from Germany after the war. I have a suit on and lapel.\nThe hall empties and nobody is approaching me. Nobody. I wait and wait. If you wait for\nsomebody and you wait for ten minutes, it sounds like an hour especially when you\u2019re in a\nStrange country.",
        "A: Know anybody. I walk a little bit around. I remember I wrote the book and I wrote about the\nTravel Aid Society. I look in. What\u2019s it called, Travel Agent? No.",
        "A: No, not a travel bureau, usually military men go inside too like they help out.",
        "A: It\u2019s a travel-aid. They just do volunteer work for people who are stranded. It\u2019s not a regular\ntravel agency where you pay money. I says maybe I should go in here and tell them that I\u2019m\nlost. I go by and I look in and I see a sailor sitting there talking to somebody so I hesitated. I\nsays no I\u2019m going to wait another five minutes and the concourse is already empty. Then all of\na sudden I see a couple or women. They coming towards me. They must have spot me the way\nI\u2019m dressed. They coming towards me and I had to see the boat. They had a car, they all\nvolunteers. To me they probably wait. Maybe they couldn\u2019t find any volunteer, were late. We\nwalk out Union Station and the first thing you see is the Capitol. I says this is the White House?\nNo, they correct me, that is the Capitol. It never made any difference to me why is the Capitol\nso white. It all depends on which angle you look at the White House, at the portico, it looks\nlike Capitol too. Anyway we got in their car and they took me to 18\" Street, near the zoo over\nthere. It was a boarding house and they says you going to be here. They told me the next day,\nleave it to the Jewish Social Service Agency. They wrote down the address. The Jewish Social\nService Agency at that time was on Spring Road which is right at 14\" Street. There was no\nsuburbs then and being I was Columbia Road, right near the zoo which is Adams-Morgan now\nand Spring Street is not --. They gave me the address, I can take the bus. Over there, I was ---\nthe lady she had lot a -- the Jewish Social Service paid her money. She put newcomers up with\nfood. She gave me a room, she had a rooming house. She says you\u2019re going to be here until we\nfind out what we going to do with you. The next day I went to the Jewish Social Service\nAgency and I had an interview with a Mr. Pixner. I think he just retired from the Jewish Social\nService Agency. He asked me what I did and the war, where I\u2019m from, relatives, no relatives.\nHe gave me $20 in my pocket. So I had $3 plus $20; I had $23. With $23, they says here\u2019s $20\nand you will sightsee. They want me to go to the city, transportation because they put me up\nwith food so I didn\u2019t need any food. I went back to the house and this lady, she packed my\nlunch. She says, I\u2019m a stranger in the city. I was afraid to venture too far out. She says well\nyou can go to the zoo. The zoo was nearby. I could walk over there, Adams-Morgan. She gave\nme the lunch so she says it\u2019s a big zoo. Big zoo, I\u2019m afraid I might be lost in the zoo. So the\nfirst bench I approached I sat down and I ate my lunch up. I finished for the day. The next day\nI ventured out and I went to 14\" Street. That time 14\" Street was all white and you could walk.\nIt wasn\u2019t like after before the riots. I looked in different stores. I saw a cleaning store\nand I see somebody reading a Jewish newspaper, I recognized it. I says maybe should go\ninside and ask him if he can find me a job. But I hesitated, I didn\u2019t go in. The following day,\ndon\u2019t forget, I still had food, I went downtown. I think Lafayette Park or some place. I just sat\ndown and men were sitting there. I struck up a conversation with him. He asked me where I\u2019m\nfrom and everything. I told him where I come from. He says he\u2019s an ex-Navy man. He was in\nthe Seabees. He says he lives on 14\" Street with his wife. He lives in the Cavalier Apartments\non 14\" Street. I was still living far away like I told you, near the zoo which is all in walking\ndistance. He says why don\u2019t you come and I want my wife to meet you. Okay, so maybe the\nnext day, I went and met his wife. He says you know we have to find you a room where you\ncan stay. I told him I don\u2019t like where I stay. We could find you a job. I think he gave me\ndinner and he said would you like to -- so he says we find a job first. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to find a room. How you going to pay? He asked me what I did. I says I don\u2019t know. I\nworked for the American army, he kitchens. They going to find you a job in People\u2019s Drug\nStore. In the commissary at night. Are you familiar with Washington? They had counters with\nfood and all this stuff. He took me to the Personnel and they find a job. So I work at night. He\nsays well, we got to get youa room. I didn\u2019t like my job. I didn\u2019t like ay nights sleeping in the\ndaytime, work at night. I cannot meet nobody. I was working there maybe for a week or for\ntwo weeks. Then he says now we go into the People\u2019s Drug Stores, 14\" and Park Road was a\ndrug store and they have notices, who rents for rooms. Inside of a day, he saw a room for rent\nright around the corner where he lives. We went over there and we talked to the man. They\nwere refugees too. They were German Jewish refugees but they arrived there before the war.\nBut they were still refugees. He recognized my accent. Where you from, from Poland? I told\nhim. He says where do you work? I says I just got a job at People\u2019s overnight. I don\u2019t like this\njob and the work at night. He says you know what, he says. I got a cousin; he\u2019s got a\nrestaurant. Let me call up; if he needs somebody. He calls him up and this cousin live around\nthe neighborhood. He was living Arkansas Avenue, in walking distance too. He says I have a\nyoung man, he\u2019s from Poland, he works at night. Do you think you can use him? He says bring\nhim over. He says, you work the same evening. We walk over the same evening come over,\nhow you doing, like with wine. All right, a little bit of wine, Manischievez. He says I have a\nplace downtown near Thomas Circle. He says come over there. If you like it, you take the job.\nIf you don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s fine too. The next day I go over there. It\u2019s a daytime job. He says, so\nyou spend a day, what do you have to lose. You\u2019re off in the daytime, you work at night. I\nstayed there and I says I like it. He paid me a dollar an hour, 40- hour week. I took home $36\nbut I figured I have a room already. I paid $40 for my room, nice people, German people, nice\nand clean. I have aroom, I\u2019m single so I don\u2019t have to go out for food. I have a daytime job. I\nhave my friend, a newly acquired friend, Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown he was very nice. Once ina\nwhile Sally went over there and she ate and she says you learn English. How do you spoke,\ntransportation. Very nice people, interested in them. You ask about school.. I enrolled in\nAmericanization school. The Americanization school was then on 18\" and Columbia Road on\nCalifornia Street. I went to school and then I make all -- people from Poland and some from\nLodz and some from different. Some from boys, some came to an uncle, some came to an aunt,\nsome came just like me. That was in the evening. I had to be there seven o\u2019clock. I went there\nseven o\u2019clock. I learned about the poems Captain my Captain. You recite poems and sing.\nDon\u2019t forget we\u2019re all older people. Then I make friends. On the weekend I have where to go.\nI have already friends and I have a daytime job. I ask them what do you do for a living. One\nworked for an uncle, one worked in a tailor shop, one works here, one is giving a party. Then I\nmet my wife because I didn\u2019t. I met some guy, he says we\u2019re going to have a party this\nweekend. Could you come along. He took me along and my wife, she came to her uncle. They\nwere living off -- they had already a nice house. Uncle was in business. You know who lives in\nthe house? Fauntleroy.",
        "A: The former delegate, well to do.. I had already friends and then after Americanization School, I\nenrolled in Central High School and take --. Right now, it\u2019s Cardoza, it\u2019s 13 and 15\" Streets. I\ntook a few courses over there at night. Then I had already dates with my wife and had parties\nand we picnic, the American way. We went to beaches and I still had my job. Then I had to\nregister for the draft and then I got married.",
        "A: I got married January 6, 1952. I came in \u201949. I got married in 1952. Listen to that. I came\nback from my honeymoon, I had greetings from Uncle Sam to go to the army. I says I just\ncame from -- I don\u2019t want to sound like a . I want to go in the army but I just came\nfrom a camp and all of a sudden, I got to go away. I\u2019m acquiring a family now with a wife,\nwith relatives. I don\u2019t have anybody, now I got to go away. All right but I have to go. The\ninduction center I had to report on New York Avenue. I go down there and the first time I must\nhave been late. Because we were living northwest and I didn\u2019t know the bus connections. I\nwas late and the bus left me . The clerk over there, 1t was a legitimate excuse, I was\njust late. She says well you come back next week. She put it down on my paper. The next\nweek I was there a little bit earlier. I came back next week and we took us down to Alexandria.\nI think it\u2019s Cameron (?) Station. You\u2019re familiar with it? We went through the whole process\ntests and everything. Then we had to go for interview. I went for interview. The captain calls\nme in because I couldn\u2019t speak -- broken English and probably didn\u2019t make out too good in my\ntests. I didn\u2019t understand some questions. He find out that I was in Buchenwald. He says, I\nliberated Buchenwald. He says I\u2019m going to give you a postponement for one year until you are\na little more familiarized yourself with the country. We put you 4F now. In one year, they\ncalled me back. At that time, I was already more organized and they called me back. I had to\nreport to Ft. Meade. I was drafted, I was two years. I came in -- I went in as a private, I came\nout as a sergeant. I took my basic training with the 101\u2018 Airborne in Kentucky and then I got\nassigned to Ft. Bragg, North Carolina which was good for me because I was stationed there.",
        "A: Wasn\u2019t too far away and I was in charge of the mess hall because I knew it already the same that\nyou cook in baking school. I came out top of the class. I have all the best recommendations. I\nshow you later on after the interview is finished. I let you read about it. I came up top of the\nclass. They gave me a set of knives and everything. Then I got discharged from the service. I\nwas looking for a job so I got a job from the Giant maybe for a year or two. Then I worked for\nmy wife\u2019s Uncle Ben here, a liquor store. Then I went back to the guy, the restaurant who gave\nme the first job. Over there, I met somebody who 1s a salesman. He says I know of a place but\nyou know the work, he tells me and I know who wants to sell it, so maybe you can take me as a\npartner. He says I\u2019m going to draw less than you do because I have a job. But I just going to be\n-- I\u2019m going to pull up the money just like you. But you live in the house and I figure that that\u2019s\na terrific idea for me. He knows the place so I went to look at the place. I bought the place and\nnow I\u2019m already 19 years over there. I\u2019m going on 20 years. It\u2019s a very nice place. It\u2019s the\nUnited States Secret Service is over there. I know everybody over there and I have a good\nbusiness. Now I\u2019m ready to retire and don\u2019t forget, I came to America with $3 I got in New\nYork. That\u2019s my story.",
        "A: Now I\u2019m going to go upstairs and I\u2019m going to show you the letters of my recommendation,\nokay?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well, I tell you. I didn\u2019t find out. I want to go back to Poland right after when I mentioned it\nbecause I was barely one year over. Then I got back to work for the American army and this\nlike this. Then the pogroms set in in Poland. In Kielce when I was there. I heard different\nstories that the people who came back from the camp, who came back to the hometowns, and\nthe Poles made sarcastic remark. So many of you still survive! I thought you all dead and\nthings like that. Then as things became known, when they liquidated the ghetto, the most of\nthem went to Kelna and then they went to Auschwitz. Then I considered, I looked at the\npicture, my father was already 40 years old. He was born in 1900. He was 44 years, it\u2019s not old\nbut the Germans done that and you don\u2019t have much food to eat, you look like an old man. My\nmother, one year younger. Then I had a younger brother. He was at that time, he was born in\n1929 so that makes him in 1945, 12, 13, so it\u2019s a very slim chance to survive. But I did, I was\nwriting letters to friends because I know I had some friends. As a matter of fact, right after the\nwar I came in contact with some people from France. They were in the French army but they\nwere touched in Nuremberg. Somehow I got to know them. They tried to help but I didn\u2019t get\nany response. I wrote to the French government, to different organizations and -- but then after\nright now with the Clarks affair and -- things like this, I obtained a letter from the\nClarks and I notice that my aunt was on the transport on the list. I have the list\nupstairs too so it\u2019s a very slim chance to survive. I didn\u2019t hear anything. Besides I registered in\nJerusalem and I registered in Germany. They have all my records from the date of inception. I\nfigured if a younger brother is looking for me, he could find me easily so I never knew. I\nwondered many times but --.",
        "A: I wanted to go to --. America was the last thing on my mind because I didn\u2019t think of going to\nAmerica in the first few couple of years after the war, only America had the strict quota. They\ntook in people who were sponsored by somebody who guaranteed the highest, highest, highest.\nBut then somehow, I think Truman, they passed a law, Congress passed a law, they got to admit\n200 or 250 thousand refugees. I wasn\u2019t the first one to believe in it so my friend, he 1s the first\none who entered Munch. But he brought me back to prove that he registered, he didn\u2019t have\nanybody. I went after that too. From that time, I knew I\u2019m going to have it easy because I\ndidn\u2019t engage in smuggling, black markets. I had a legitimate job and all the recommendations\nso I know if that\u2019s the date, I be coming here. That\u2019s my story.",
        "A: I was just saying --. What I want to say, now things are differently. At that time in 1944, if\npeople could help one another but they didn\u2019t. A lot of people kept silent. I wouldn\u2019t condemn\nthe whole race or the whole nation but a lot of people could\u2019ve survived. The populations was\nvery hostile in Europe, in Eastern Europe especially. In Western Europe it was a different story\nbut in Eastern Europe, the Jews were always second-class citizens. Even right now, I\u2019m reading\nthe stories like after cleaning of the Warsaw ghetto, they brought the people from Auschwitz to\nclean the Warsaw ghetto. When the Poles made a revolt, they freed some of the inmates. The\nrevolt didn\u2019t last long but just for six weeks or so. They freed some of the inmates, they\ncleaning the Warsaw ghetto. They said we want to free Poland with our Jews. Some of them\ngot killed after the war so that what it is. That\u2019s man inhumanity to man. Right now if you see\nsomething wrong, you stand up and get to be counted. That\u2019s exactly what it means -- man\u2019s\ninhumanity to man. It\u2019s an old poem, I don\u2019t know if you read. It\u2019s not a poem, it was in the\npaper. A German priest writes. He says when Hitler came into power in 1933, he said, they\nstart persecuting the Jews. He says, I wasn\u2019t a Jew, I didn\u2019t spoke up. Then they take the\nhomosexuals put them in concentration camp -- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with it -- I\nwasn\u2019t a homosexual, I didn\u2019t speak up. Then they took the clergy, the Protestants, I wasn\u2019t a\nProtestant, I didn\u2019t spoke up. It came to the Catholic, I wasn\u2019t a Catholic, I didn\u2019t spoke up. It\ncame to me, there was nobody else to speak up for me. That\u2019s the way it is. That\u2019s what it is.",
        "A: Okay, thank you. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to sound.",
        "A: Let me see. I\u2019m going to show you what I have upstairs.\n"
