        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Morris Kornberg, conducted by Margaret West, on\nSeptember the 27\", 1999, in Waldorf, Maryland. This is a follow up interview to a\n1990. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff\nand Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A.\nMr. Kornberg, I wonder if you\u2019d start by telling me your -- your name, your parent\u2019s\nnames, the details of your birth, and your siblings.",
        "Answer: Okay. My name -- oh, you are holding it?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: My name is Morris Kornberg. Actually, f -- at home they used to call me, because I\ncome from an Orthodox home, Moshe, Moshe Kornberg. And I was born in Poland, in\nChadbush. My father\u2019s name was Menachem Rafar Rafael. Menachem Rafael. My\nmother\u2019s name was Yentla. Her maiden name was Malkavietska. My -- the oldest in\nour family was my sister Sarah. She was married. Her husband\u2019s name was Moshe\nAlexander. They had three kids, the oldest was a girl, and she had two boys. Then was\nmy oldest brother, his name was Haim. He was managing -- my father was semi-\nretired, and he took over the business, and he managed the business until -- as long as I\nremember, until the war started, and I didn\u2019t see him any more. Next I have another\nbrother, his name was Ayah. He left Poland, he was in a kibbutz in Poland, he left\nPoland, he went to Israel to build Israel up. And this was probably in 1933. Then next I\nhave a sister, she was still single, and her name was Miriam, in Polish used to call it\nManya. She was at home, living with the family. Then I had another brother, his name\nwas Abraham, and he was still single, he was three years older than me, and I was the\nyoungest in our family.",
        "Q: So there were six of you altogether?",
        "A: Right, six brothers and sisters.",
        "Q: I\u2019m correcting that because much of the Holocaust material said seven.",
        "A: Any time that you have any question, I\u2019d be glad to answer it.",
        "Q: And both your parents were -- were Jewish, and brought you up in -- practicing a\nsort of Orthodox Jewish faith.",
        "A: Right, exactly, yes.",
        "Q: I was interested in the fact that you were educated privately --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- and I wonder if you\u2019d tell me more about -- more about that, and also the fact that\nafter the age of 14 or 15, you were given more freedom?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s correct. I -- I was raised in a strict Orthodox family, more or less my\nfather belonged to Hassidim. And -- but the only difference was, he was not a fanatic\neither. We had been home -- three brothers and sister, we always brought home Zionist\norganization\u2019s books. We had to do always -- parents, my father\u2019s j-job was to keep us\nbusy. So we could do anything. Our education, he never rejected it, or tell us he want\nus to read. And actually, what we used to bring home, always books, and all those\nbrothers and sisters, he practically read all books, although he was more a model\nOrthodox person.",
        "Q: And was it usual to give young men much more freedom when they reached the age\nof 14 or 15?",
        "A: More or less. I think this what it was. Til 14 - 15, actually, we had to go along\nalways, like the services, special on Shabbas, on holidays, we always went along with\nmy father, and it would be not nice for us not to go along, so we went along. But after\nwe had been 15 years old, we still went for education, Jewish religion, and higher\nlearnings. But my father had enough, was wise enough to see that the world is\nchanging, and you cannot stay always in -- how he would like it, so he gave us more --\nall brothers and sisters, freedom. After fif -- 15, we could d -- go our way.",
        "Q: I wonder if you\u2019d also tell me how you viewed your family\u2019s position. In the -- the\nvideotaped interview, your -- you cover your family history, but would you tell me\nwhether they should be regarded as urban or rural? As middle class, as a better off\nfamily?",
        "A: Oh, our family was a very great family, with lots of love. Kids for parents, and vice\nversa, parents for kids. Our economical status was fairly good, better than average.\nAnd the most of all, 1t cannot go higher with regards in us to our parents, and vice\nversa, the parents to us. I feel that love like this cannot be greater, and will never be\ngreater, at the times what I spent home, and close the circle with our family.",
        "Q: And I assume that it\u2019s that family background that enabled you to -- to cope with\nlife.",
        "A: This is a question actually, I cannot answer too good of it, because under the\ncircumstances, I practically gave up life the day when I was arrested. This was in\nJanuary, must been around July or August, and I was integrated for Gestapo, and\nbeaten unmerciful, but I was -- the most fear was, for me actually, beating, because\nthey used to beat me when I was interviewed by Gestapo, til I passed out. When I\npassed out, they didn\u2019t have running water, over there at the police station, they\ndragged me out to a well, where they poured water on my head, and I was revived, dra\n-- dragged back inside, and again beating, and beating. And this was my biggest fear of\nit was beating. And I begged the officer who interviewed me to shoot me on the spot.\nHe laughed, and he told me, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this. You don\u2019t nec -- you\ndon\u2019t have to expect tha -- that you will live. But we finish you off not when you want\nit, we finish you when we want it.\u201d This was the answer.",
        "Q: Did you ever know why they were questioning you, and what information they\nwanted to get from you?",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s a big story, I gonna try to -- just to tell you in more details. We had\nbusiness, all kind of bus -- my parents started actually, with a grocery store, good\nbusiness. But when my mo -- my oldest brother, Haim, when he was more or less in\nhis 20\u2019s, early 20\u2019s, and he slowly took over business by our parents, and he always\nlooked at a food store, little grocery store, we could make a living, he made a living,\nbut he couldn\u2019t make money all the -- actually for a better life. So he started it, he -- he\nwas a representative -- in our town, small town in Chadbush was four smaller\nfactories. They all produced the same product, more or less, like knives, forks. And the\nmostly of it, it was not expensive, it wasn\u2019t the most cheapest actually, tableware, what\nyou can have it. And this used to be shipped to Galeetsia, farther down near the\nRussian border where we had it. And my brother used to supply raw materials, and\napparently, I don\u2019t know exactly, but he made always so much percentage on the\nsupplies profit. And this got better and better every time, with more -- and the season\nmostly in those factories, smaller fat -- f -- smaller factories was about four or five\nmonths of the year, where business were real good, and about six, seven months were\nslack. And they had a rough time to meet payrolls for the workers what they kept on.\nAnd my buth -- my brother used to borrow money, actually to those factories, not for a\nfavor, but actually to make some money, too. So they paid so much percentage per\nmonth, or whatever, I was not familiar, I was too young to know about business. Then\nfinally he invested in one particular factory, it belongs to a Gentile in out town, his\nname was Rochinsky. And he had a little bit rough time to repay it, whatever he owed\nus, So he took -- he proposed my brother to be a partner in the factory. And this went\non til war time [indecipherable]. In 1939, when the Germans came in, my brother\nrealized it\u2019s another -- a different era already. We -- as being well and everything, but\nwe realized that we shouldn\u2019t show that we had any interest in the factory, because we\nknow it, that Jewish property was confiscated right from the beginning. Nobody went\ndown, because before the war, since 1937, my brother send me over to the factory to\nget the fa-familiar with the procedures, how to deal with the people who worked in the\nfactory, and how to deal with customers who buy -- bought our merchandise; to get\nfamiliar with it. But since -- when the Germans came in, this stopped, so my brother\nsaid, \u201cDon\u2019t mention any more, you stay home like anybody else.\u201d And take -- in 19 --\nthe end of \u201939, we had to go in to live in a ghetto. So we lived in the ghetto, and life\ngot terrible expensive because Jewish people never got any rations, because rations for\nGentiles -- they used to get the food cards every month, but didn\u2019t got. So the Black\nMarket was very high. If you want buy a loaf of bread, you have to buy -- you have to\npay 10 times the value, and so any other products. Well, life got to get very expensive\nuntil 1940. In 1940, they arrested the owner, Rochinsky was arrested for Gestapo,\nbecause he was more or less a intelligent person. They had been scared, the Germans\ndidn\u2019t trust the more intelligent people. And he was taken in the 40\u2019s, to Auschwitz.\nAfter two, three weeks -- we didn\u2019t know much about the Auschwitz in 1940, but after\ntwo, three weeks, came a telegram that he\u2019s not any more alive, and his clothing was\nsent back to his widow. And my brother said -- we have been three brothers at home,\nand the oldest brother, he had already like a green band, instead had the white arm\nband with the Star of David, he used to have a green band with the Star of David. The\ngreen band meant actually that you are privileged. A Jew was not allowed to dry -- to\nride the train, or go out after seven o\u2019clock from the ghetto, to be seen on a street.\nThey had still curfew for Jews. And everywhere, wherever, you couldn\u2019t move freely,\nbut if you had a green band, you could ride the train, you had been -- you could move\nfreely, you could go out after seven o\u2019clock actually. And this was a -- of course, the\nGerman government required if you would supply some metal products, even scaret of\nmetal. So many pounds, was -- I don\u2019t know exactly, they gave you a green band that\nyou are privileged Jew, and you could go more or less freely, wherever you wanted.\nHe saw it that my -- otherwise we have it -- used to be any Jew from 18 til 55 was a --\nforced to perform some labor for the city, otts -- clean cities, or whatever. I was\nassigned in a quarry, a stone quarry, actually, and was very -- pretty hard work, but it -\n- in the evening, after eight hours, or 10 hours, I don\u2019t know exactly either, how many\nhours we worked, we could go home and spend with our family at home. This went\non, but still my brother said that he going to see a very -- that I get a green band, too,\nthat I will not have to go to the slave labor every day, to the quarry. True, he had some\nconnections in a larger city with some Jewish, more or less, leaders from the Jewish\ncommunity, and they had connection, they had been able to bribe Gestapo, and SS.\nBribing, if you gave money or some products what they wanted it, you could get\nfavors from them, and they did it. When my brother arranged the same way, he had to\npay money for it, that I will be assigned, to start to be as -- to go every day to labor in\nthe city, that my assignment will be to put in labor in the factory, to work in the\nfactory, to perform labor, whatever it was [indecipherable]. At this time the factory\nwas idle, because Mrs. Rochinsky, she was -- she had three girls, and she was not able\nto manage a factory, she didn\u2019t know it. Besides this, when the German came in, they\nright away, they froze all salaries. Practically anyplace where s -- they had\n[indecipherable] employees, they couldn\u2019t pay any higher wages than -- than pre-war\nwages. And this was a problem, because whatever they have to buy, food for\nthemselves, even with rations, or you wanted to buy something better, was sayvay four\nor five times as much as pre-war, [indecipherable] nobody wanted the war. When I --\nwhen I had the permission to go down perform my job in the factory, my brother set\nme up, that I should get in contact with the employers who used to work before the\nwar, and tell them if they come to work, they will be able to earn three times, or four\ntimes as much as they earned b-before the war. And they should be -- come to work to\ndo their job, and we will pay them real good. I started to organize, and this -- people\nstarted to come back, until I opened the factory and started to produce. But, it was a\nproblem. You had to have books, because you never know when the German\ngovernment going to come to check your books. So e -- we have been forced to have\ndouble bookkeeping. One set of book was actually what we did pay them. Same way\nwe used to get -- we used write [indecipherable] what we sold to dealers, we sold\nmostly to Jewish merchants, and we gave them a bill, the price like before the war, and\nthey paid us the same way, two, three times this amount. But the point was we still had\nto keep double bookkeeping, until one of those days, and this was apparently in \u00b041,\none of the employee, he was not mad at me, he work over there a long time already,\nand he knows me, and he saw me before the warm I was in the factory involved. And\nhe got a -- with a disagreement with the owner in -- in the place, and he went to\nGestapo, and he told them that the factory actually belongs more to us than it belongs\nto her, it\u2019s a Jewish factory, and he told all kinds. For example, we used to have, when\nwe finished merchandise before, we shipped it out to those merchants who bought our\nmerchandise, we always had been afraid that someday the Gestapo will come, and they\nwill confiscate everything. And where we used to keep finished merchandise, not far\naway from the factory 1n a village, and it used to be hidden aboll where we could\nalways ship this merchandise, because we never know if -- when they will come to\nconfiscate the factory. And he told the Gestapo everything, what is going on, that the\nmerchandise 1s in a aboll in the next village. And finally, one day, like I said, must\nhave been July or August, a policeman came to our home, and he said that I should\ncome down to this jontamarie, where they had their headquarters. Normally, our town\nwas a small town, we didn\u2019t had, actually, Gestapo, SS in our town, only jontamarie\nwe had it. But once in -- every few weeks, two, three weeks, what I don\u2019t know\nexactly, they used to come in a larger town, SS, they -- if they had any complaints to\ntake care cases, this when they come in to take care the -- of those business. And iva\nthe policemens told me I am called to the jontamarie, to come down. And I remember,\nand I can remember it exactly like today. I looked at my mother, and I saw her face,\nand it didn\u2019t help me that I have to go down, but it help me the suffering in my mother,\nand so my father, too. I went down in a sleeveless shirt --",
        "Q: Let me go back and ask --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: -- ask you to describe your mother\u2019s expression. Because that would be something\nthat\u2019s always stayed with you.",
        "A: Expression of my mother was -- it\u2019s unforgettable, because like I just said, it\u2019s\nexactly -- I can see it with my eyes right now, how her expression was -- she felt\nscared. She didn\u2019t know it -- what it will happen to me. And I could read anything\nwhat she had in her mind, I saw it with my eyes. I saw my father -- I was sleeveless, I\ndidn\u2019t took even my jacket, and I told them, I ha -- I practically shivered, and I said,\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry about it, I will be back in a couple hours.\u201d But --",
        "Q: Also, have you thought about why they -- why they took you? Was it because you\nwere younger, and might speak more freely? Why they took you, and not your older\nbrother.",
        "A: Because I was in the factory.",
        "Q: And your older brother, Haim?",
        "A: My older brother, he was still traveling around, and he dealed with raw materials.\nYeah, but I was in the factory [indecipherable]",
        "Q: I see, so you did know more.",
        "A: -- actually. And so the -- everything -- whatever he mentioned it, he mentioned me\nas a -- you know, the double bookkeeping, and everything that I was involved. And so\nthis why they called me. And I went down, it was a pretty warm day, and I came down\nover there, and I was called in in a room, where I saw a very high officer. I couldn\u2019t\ntell his rank, I\u2019m not familiar, but he was a very high officer. And I looked, he had a\nstack of papers, maybe two, three inches high, and he start to ask me questions, if I am\nin the factory over there, if I help manage the factory. And right away I realized, when\nI saw this stack of papers, I realized what the questions are, that he knows more than I\nmyself know, because of I realized that it\u2019s no use to lie, and I start to tell anything\nfully -- fully to cooperate with them. But this was not a big deal, cooperation did not\nhelp to save me. He called in two strong guys from the Gestapo. Young guys, strong\nguys. And they had like a special chair, like to lay down on it, not to sit, but -- on my\nbelly to lay over there, that my back, everything is exposed. And they came in with --\nthe -- the SS and Gestapo, they used to carry, when they went on the street, made from\nleather -- I don\u2019t know even how they call this in English, I don\u2019t recall, exactly,\nwhatever. You know, for beating somebody, just on the street. They saw a Jewish kid,\nor whatever, they beat over the head with it, something like this. And they told me to\nlay down on my belly on this chair, whatever it was, it was built special for this\npurpose, actually. And in both sides, right and left, kept on pounding in my body,\nactually. And actually, it\u2019s impossible. I was young, and strong at this time, maybe, but\nbeating like this, I don\u2019t think any human can take it. And I used to pass out. When I\npassed out, they dragged me out to the well, they pumped water on my head. As soon I\ncame back, they dragged me back in, and again and again and again. And I always was\nmore on the floor anyway, especial with the beating, I couldn\u2019t stand straight any\nmore. They didn\u2019t give you a chair to seat, and so you had a choice, all to be on your\nall four on the floor, or actually -- you know, to stay, you couldn\u2019t stay. I was always\non the floor. I went -- he was sitting at the table, he had very polished, high boots on it,\nand I remember I practically was very -- pretty close to his boots. And I told him in\nGerman, \u201cPlease shoot me. Please finish me off.\u201d And he laughed, looked in my eyes,\nhe said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this, but we finish you off when we want it,\nnot when you want it.\u201d And this went on hours and hours. This was actually --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Morris Kornberg. This is tape number one, side B. I have a question about an\nearlier time, and that is that when the Germans invaded Poland, and you fled to the\nwoods for a few days --",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: What would be the reason why your home was spared, when much of the town was\nburned?",
        "A: This 1s a -- this is the same way, this -- you cannot ans -- for a question like this,\nthis just happened to be that the -- first was burned the synagogue, what this was once\nin the -- famous all over the world, not in Poland, but all over the world, was a famous\nfor art, and beauty, and anything what is possible, actually, to describe this synagogue.\nAnd the reason was actually the synagogue was near a river what it went through our\ntown, the Pilitsa. And it was a bridge, and the bridge actually was a wooden bridge. It\nwas not a heavy structure, a wooden bridge. And when the Germans invaded, I\nremember it was on a Friday, the first of September was on a Friday when they c --\nyeah, it was a Friday, and Saturday they have been already over there. And so the first\nthing what they did, they tried to secure the bridge, they -- they can come in and cross\nwherever they wanted with their armies. So they put the bridge on fire, after they went\nin, and this was near the synagogue, and because the structure was a wooden structure,\napparently -- I don\u2019t know, maybe they put bombs -- firebombs actually on it before --\nthis 1 -- I don\u2019t know either, because I actually, myself, and so the -- mostly of the\ntown, the whole town, run away in the woods. So we didn\u2019t know exactly, but we\nknow it right away the next day, that the synagogue was burned. Actually, it was\nnothing left over from the synagogue. This -- this all as I can recall, actually.",
        "Q: I should say on tape that we -- we -- I changed the subject abruptly, but I should let\nlisteners know that your detailed story of your arrest and beating by the SS officer, is\ntold on the March 1990 videotape --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- at the Holocaust museum.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: And I want to fill in some gaps from that earlier interview.",
        "A: Okay, go ahead, whatever you ask, I will -- 1f I can answer [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yes. One of the questions was when you were living in the ghetto, was that in\nChadbush?",
        "A: Chadbush, the main place, actually, was Chadbush it was the name, but Chadbush\nwas the -- a divided. On one side of the river -- of the Pilitsa, where the bridge was,\nwas the one side was Chadbush, when you crossed the bridge, they called it Vidamma.\nActually, it was the same town, but it still, this was Chadbush, and this was Vidamma.\nIn the ghetto, when they had to leave everything, the houses, and anything, and go, the\nghetto was actually made in Vidamma. The reason was because it was already a little\nbit out of the town, and it was easier to petition it off with wires, or whatever, to make\nit that you cannot just walk out of the ghetto as a free person. And this was the easiest\nthing, cause of the German decided that Vidamma wi -- will be the ghetto, and this\nactually where all Jews, including my family, lived. In Vidamma, in the ghetto.",
        "Q: I want to fill in another -- another gap, or clarify something, and this is moving\nahead to when you were in -- I think it\u2019s pronounced Javishavitz.",
        "A: Yavishavitz. This is actually -- I was four weeks -- probably it\u2019s mentioned the\nsame way, my first tape. I went -- after the beating, they took me down, back to the\nfactory, and I didn\u2019t know it even at this time, that the widow from the owner, actually,\nshe was a -- she was not Jewish, a Gentile, and she was arrested too, for the same\ncrime like me, that we had double bookkeeping, that we had hidden finished\nmerchandise, whatever. So she was arrested, and I never knowed it -- that -- til he --\nuntil four weeks later. But I -- I was -- first they put me in a jail in Chadbush. And\nChadbush was not a official -- a big jail, was a very small -- in fact, they used to call it\n-- | don\u2019t know the name, accosa. A big jail is like jeminale, you know, but this was a\nsmall -- it was just for drunks, or whatever. Not too much, you know, criminals. And\nthey hold me overnight. When I came to this jail, -- oh the first -- this was the first\ntime in my life I came in a jail, but we used to hear stories, if you have been a\nnewcomer in a jail, they made jokes with you, all kind, a lot of time even beating, or\nwhatever. This was the fun -- this how -- it used to be a custom, and -- when you was a\nnewcomer in a jail. When I came in over -- to this jail, actually, they probably realized\nI couldn\u2019t walk straight, and mine back, everything, was black practically. But for\nsome reason, they didn\u2019t perform all those jokes, what they used to do it for a\nnewcomer. And they felt more or less like sorry for me, you know, that I was all\nbeaten up, so they let me alone. Little bit later on, came in the one who was like a\npoliceman, he was in charge of this small jail. And he knowed my parents, or he\nknowed me, too. So he came over to me, he wa -- they was P-Poles, not a -- not\nGermans, but a Pole, and he came over, and he asked me if I want write home\nsomething to m -- to my parents about me. At first I hardly could even take a pencil,\nmy hand to write any words, but I -- I said it\u2019s necessary to write home. And I wrote\nhome in the same way I think on the ID cards what they distributed in the Holocaust\nmuseum, what I took part those -- they have this saying in sayvay things like this you\ncannot forget. I wrote home, and I said in my few words what I was writing, I told\nthem please -- twice I said please, please forget about me, I be all right. Go on with\nyour life, noble. Just forget about me. This was in Chadbush still. This was my last\nword to my parents and family. The next morning they took me -- they brought me --\nit\u2019s just 40 kilometers from Chadbush, and the name is Koinsket. This is a larger town,\nand they had over there a -- a large -- a k -- prison -- a prison for the -- for -- mostly for\npeople who don\u2019t obey the law, whatever, but it was much, much larger. I was brought\nin over there, first they took me to Gestapo in Koinsket, and I was real -- really\nconcerned. I-I didn\u2019t care, I was afraid just for more beating, that I couldn\u2019t take it any\nmore. So I -- every minute I was over there, I just kept on looking when they start --\ngoing to start to beat me again, but they never did. They brought me over to the jail.\nWhen I came into the jail, I was released, that -- at least I wasn\u2019t beaten any more, I\ncame in over there. And the same thing, I know the procedure again, that those all in\njail gonna make -- have fun, whatever. And they saw me coming in, and the same way\nthey felt sorry for me, and they know it that I\u2019m not a criminal, and they realize that --\nwhy I am over there, because it was involved for politics too, because the bookkeeper\nfrom our factory used to always to give me a -- handle over some mimeographs that\nused to come from the underground, from the -- England, to tell you how the front\ngoes on over there. And so he told them that I -- I have knowledge about the\nunderground, too, was a -- this was part why I was arrested, actually. And they kept on\ncoming, talking this over, how I behaved, and -- and I did whatever they told me. We\nhave been in a cell, probably was over there the same way, between 30 and 40 people,\nand everybody has a -- like in a corner, in a straw sack he had over there where you\nrested overnight to sleep, actually. In the same way it was no modern facilities in this\njail. We used to have a large can, real huge, and everybody -- what a human has to do\nit, or -- they did everything the whole night, in this large kettle -- can, whatever. And\nin the morning it was always they changed it. Two people, they used to carry out, and\ntake care, and then was to sc-scrub the floors, to keep it clean, everything. I recall after\na f-few days that -- certain the third day, the fourth day, it was -- I was 1n the line to\ncarry this out, and scrub the floors, and so far. And I went over to do it, I didn\u2019t look\nthat somebody should do for me any favors, I went over like any other prisoner. And\nthen one Pole came, and pushed me away, and he said he will do this for me. I -- I\ndidn\u2019t want to fight it, I let him do it. And the same way, after a few days, maybe after\na week, the one who was in charge, like the warden in jail, he was not German, he was\nPolish, too. So he called me in his office, he came to me, I went down from that cell in\nhis office. And he told me, \u201cDon\u2019t be upset, you probably -- your brothers are working\nfor you that you going to be released. You will probably be -- be released 1f not this\nweek, is next week, a third week. But they work for you, to release you.\u201d It meant that\nthey going to bribe the Gestapo for it. And he says, \u201cI know -- they are in contact with\nme, and I will see that you get food. You don\u2019t have to eat that food from the jail.\nSomebody will bring in every day, food for you. And so you going to have private\nfood, not from jail. But,\u201d he said, \u201cjust -- this 1s a secret.\u201d This is a very dangerous\nthing, I should never tell nobody what happened, what had happened. He will see that I\nwill be supplied with food. And I noticed that actually that it changed a little bit, you\nknow. I felt more comfortable, and so were all those other in the cell, the other person\nthas this -- they didn\u2019t know it, where I was exactly, but -- this was a secret when I\ncalled into the office, to this warden. But they saw something goes on, so I didn\u2019t say a\nword, but they felt that I am better treated like anybody else, more or less. And so they\ntried, actually, always, what I had to do, they jumped in, pushed me away, and they\nused to do it for me. And we got along fairly well. This was -- actually, in jail over\nthere, in Koinsket, I was four weeks. I remember one day they brought in two Jewish\npeople, because I was the only Jew on the -- in this cell. But they brought in a couple\nJewish people, I know them. They have been in Vidamoff, in the ghetto, they lived in\nthe ghetto. They used to be butcher -- butchers, and they got caught by the German\nauthority that they butchered a cow, or whatever. They took them, they put them --\nthey brought them over to the jail. And I can recall normally they have not been so\nreligious people, a butcher, whatever, but one had along with him a prayer book, and\nthe whole night he didn\u2019t do nothing else, except he kept on praying from the prayer\nbook. Prays -- was it -- to me it was not strange, 1t was familiar, everything. And I ask\nmyself, he\u2019s not such hot religious person, why does he pray so much? What is\nhappen, early in the morning, maybe five o\u2019clock, still was dark, they called off their\nname, they took them out, and we heard a few shots. The others in the cell told me,\n\u201cYou know, they got shot. They killed them.\u201d Over there, outside the jail. I didn\u2019t\nknow now -- think I didn\u2019t know it, if they are dead, if it\u2019s true what they told me, but I\nknow it -- it\u2019s fa -- was not just calling off a name. We heard shots.",
        "Q: Do you know why they were killed?",
        "A: Yeah, because the same way, it was not allowed to butcher anything, especial on\nthe kashrut you know, by a rabbi, and everything, this was their things, you -- this was\nnot allowed. In fact, it was those -- the ghetto was so crowded, if a Christian, a Pole,\nstart to bring in food to sell on -- for -- for profit, on the black market, whatever, and\nhe got caught by gendarmarie, whatever, they put them in jail, too. R -- they didn\u2019t\ndare to -- even to bring in food, even to make money, they been scared for their own\nlife.",
        "Q: You said something that inter -- interested me earlier, which was that the Gestapo\nmay have felt you had knowledge of the underground.",
        "A: Yeah, they did.",
        "Q: Tell me more about that.",
        "A: The bookkeeper in the factory, he was probably -- oh, probably eight or 10 years\nolder than me, because he was married, and had I think, two, three kids already. And\nhe used to like, you know, to drink a little bit. He was -- he was a brilliant man, a\nbrilliant mind, very brilliant. His name was Levandoski, and he for some reason, he\nliked me.",
        "Q: Was he a Gentile, or a Jew?",
        "A: A Gentile, yeah, a Gentile. He liked me, and they didn\u2019t know it at home, he used\nto take me along to restaurants, where he used to buy -- h-he -- he da -- was not so well\noff, you know, but he used to buy me that I drink with him together, and I used to do\nit, actually, because he wasn\u2019t much older than me, and young people -- young boys\nlike me, I was at this time 20 -- 19 years old, so it was for me a privilege. I used to\ncome home, my parents used to think that I am sick, because they served dinner, and I\ndidn\u2019t eat it, I was not hungry, because I ate with him in the restaurant. And the ta --\nsame way that he had touch with the underground, actually. He used to take me home,\neven home, what is not allowed heah to foreign language -- foreign countries, and he\nused to, on short wave he get always, he got BBC, and plus he used to get once a\nmonth, a mimeograph, a little thing, they told you on the front what is going on. And\nhe always shared with me, he really kept me -- I don\u2019t know why, but like I would be\nhis closest buddy. And he actually was arrested, too, before me. They send him to\nAuschwitz, the same way, after a week, two, he came a telegram, he\u2019s not alive any\nmore. We didn\u2019t know really what Auschwitz means, what Auschwitz 1s, but we\nalways was thinking, okilly, as soon you go over, a week later comes a telegram you\ndead, so it\u2019s -- must be more than what anybody knows about Auschwitz.",
        "Q: So, in fact, you wouldn\u2019t really know for sure who told the SS about -- about you?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, I know it.",
        "Q: It was the disgruntled employee?",
        "A: It was a -- an employee, I knowed him very well. His name was Novokowski. He\nknowed me well, we got along real good. I don\u2019t know -- he didn\u2019t meant actually to\nhurt me, so much. He was trying to hurt the widow in the factory, because he was mad\nat her.",
        "Q: Yes, but the -- the widow, in fact, sounds as if she always was very honorable in\nher dealings with you.",
        "A: Oh yeah, she respect us, she respect our family. She knows how much money we\nhave in -- it\u2019s involved -- what we have over there in the factory. Plus, she felt at this\ntime, you have been a woman, a lady, something, you have not got involved in\nbusiness. You was involved to raise th -- your family, the three girls, nobody\u2019s home.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And so she was happy to see that I take over the duties.",
        "Q: Yes, I wondered if that good relationship was unusual? I know that there was much\nanti-Semitism in Catholic Poland, but perhaps because they were somewhat part of the\nintelligentsia, she and her husband?",
        "A: Normally, actually, what it is, sure the anti-Semitism was a real great big, big, and\nevery day got bigger actually, the anti-Semitism. This actually why br -- mine brother\nleft in \u00b033, he saw it -- what is coming, more or less. And he say he doesn\u2019t want to\nstay in Poland, doesn\u2019t want no part, so he just -- and he was a patriot to build Israel,\nthis was the reason. We thought he is not normal, he goes away from the -- from the\ngood home, and he used to say he\u2019s ashamed that we are making money easy, you\nknow, he believe more you have to work for your money, not just from business. So\nfar -- he was very, very much patriotic, but the -- with me, actually, I didn\u2019t know it, I\nwas over there four weeks in jail, and then suddenly, about -- after four weeks, I\nremember, yeah, somebody called my name. And I recognize right away this was the\nwidow from the factory, Mrs. Rochinski, and she in Polish calls me, you know, and --\nand so if she\u2019s -- and she -- I responded, \u201cYeah, I am here, in this cell.\u201d I don\u2019t know if\n-- where she know it, or apparently she know it. And so she told me that she is\nreleased, she --after four weeks -- she was four weeks 1n jail, and she said she -- they\nreleased her, she goes home. She told me that I shouldn\u2019t worry, I will go home. They\nhad already the release for me, but they need a signature from a higher officer, and\nthey have to go to another town for this high office signature. \u201cSo you probably will be\nreleased tomorrow,\u201d she told me. And they all -- the other inmates in the cell where\nwas -- I was with them, they all heard it, and everybody was happy for me, I going to\ngo home tomorrow. And they gave me addresses to go to their families, and their\nwives, tell them how they are, what they this. It was a -- like a holiday already, the day\nwhen she called us. But the next morning, early in the morning, this what the\nprocedure [indecipherable] in the morning, they called off my name, they called off\nother inmates name, but I -- something didn\u2019t sound to me right, because they kept on\ncalling too many names. Because they used to do every few weeks, every month or\ntwo -- but I don\u2019t know the same way, exactly how often they did it. They emptied the\njails for new inmates. In other word, they took those jails, and they send them to\nconcentration camps, like Auschwitz or whatever, and -- but when they took us, they\ntied our -- our hand to the back, and -- just with a piece string, like, actually, nothing,\nand they put us on trucks, and they drove, I don\u2019t know how many kilometer -- I never\nknow even til today where I was. I think -- I assume it was Kelsa, because from\nKoinsket, biz -- Kelsa was not so far, and took about a couple hours in a truck. And\nthen they brought us to a market over there on the -- we have been told -- we saw all\naround SS, with machine guns, rifle gu -- whatever, circled around us, and they kept\non bringing to another jail, so I don\u2019t know [indecipherable] else, until they get it, a\nlarge quantity of people the same way and it -- it must have been several thousand,\nactually. Took quite a number of hours, until when we all have been, and you have --\nlay on the floor, on your knees, you could not raise your head, if you raised your head,\nyour -- they told us, then you will be shot. You know, your -- right away they watched\nwith rifles around over there, or machine gun. Well, we all laid on the -- on the f -- on\nthe ground over there on this market, until actually they had the amount of people, or\nwhate -- what they expected to have it on the jails, and they put us on cat -- those cattle\nwagons, in the same ways. We used to see the one who guarded some of them have\nbeen Wehrmarkt, and so we have been more friendlier, because you couldn\u2019t just talk\nto one from the SS, he finished you on -- off on the spot. But we saw [indecipherable]\nthey ask him where they take us, where we going to go, where we going. \u201cOh,\u201d they\nused to say, \u201coh, you go probably where you going to have to | -- be over there, do\nsome work, labor.\u201d [indecipherable] all, and we didn\u2019t know it until we arrived around\nmidnight, probably, over there, and the first thing I saw it when they brought in, they\nopened the gate, and it said, the gate said abait bakt fry. And I didn\u2019t know that this\nwas a g -- in Auschwitz a gate, didn\u2019t know it. But as soon we -- we got off in\nrestraints, although it was guarded off -- they have a bi -- large ramp -- ramp, and both\nsides have been guarded by SS. And they had sticks, irons, all kind things, and when\nthey chase you out, and everything was schnell, schnell, fast, fast. And so you got --\nwherever you move, wherever you go, it didn\u2019t make any different. They hit you over\nyour head, or your back. It depends how lucky you have been, and we had to keep on\nmoving. And this what we did, and then we saw people, like kapos in uniforms, striped\nuniforms. We didn\u2019t know it -- they start to talk, and they said, \u201cHere\u2019s Auschwitz,\u201d\nyou know? And some of them have been only over there from those kapos what they --\nthey want to kill you practically on the spot. Any move, whatever it was, it didn\u2019t\nmake any different. It was only, you know, to make you so miserable, that you will\ngive up li -- living. The truth 1s, I gave up right away the first day when I was arrested.\nI figured this is the end. And I could see it right away, wherever I was, that it\u2019s\nnowhere in the world -- you know, the dreaming that I will go home, see my parents,\nsee my family, or be free. A lot of -- the first thing when I gave up, I figured what\u2019s\nthe use to fight? You cannot fight this, and why suffer? So you -- no use to suffer\neither.",
        "Q: Well, what went wrong, do you suppose, in the plan that your brothers were\nworking toward? It seems you came so close to being freed?",
        "A: Yeah, this is -- I don\u2019t know. In fact, Jewish people have not been allowed to visit a\njail if they have somebody -- like some other -- if you have been Gentile, you have\nbeen allowed, I don\u2019t know, every two weeks, or every -- to see some relatives or\nfriend, but for Jewish people was not allowed. One time, the warden from the jail\narranged that my older brother from me I was the youngest, but next to me, his name\nwas Abraham, that he come to see me, he can speak with me. So I wait, he called me\nout to come to his office, took me out from the cell. There I was in his office, and he\ntold me, look, this a --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Morris Kornberg. This\nis tape number two, side A.",
        "A: And he said he does it, but it\u2019s not legal, 1t\u2019s not allowed for a Jewish person to\nhave any visits [indecipherable], but he says, \u201cYour brother gonna come to this\nwindow,\u201d and he hold me over there by the window, and he said, \u201cYou talk to your\nbrother.\u201d And I went in the window, I saw my brother, and he said, \u201cMoshe.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cAvrum.\u201d We called each other\u2019s name. And then the warden, he watched it\npretty careful, and he saw through the window that a s -- ess -- SS car coming closer,\nand he didn\u2019t know where they come, but right away he said, \u201cBack -- quick, back to\nthe cell.\u201d I went back to the cell, and I never saw nobody any more.",
        "Q: Too great a risk for the warden.",
        "A: Yeah, and the next day, this when they called off and they brought us to Auschwitz.\nAnd --",
        "Q: I had wanted to ask, after you were -- you had been moved to Auschwitz, would\nyour family have been able to trace where you were?",
        "A: Probably not. No way, I mean you -- this was so secretly arranged, that nobody\ncould trace nobody. No, this was not -- never -- impossible. This I know it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And your information about your family after that, were you able to find\nout anything?",
        "A: I never heard it, and I never met -- I never saw nobody, not s -- ever. Nothing. In\nthe same way, even when I was in the Auschwitz, and I saw this is the end of the w-\nworld, and everything, but I never could forget not that I\u2019m suffering -- this was out of\nthe question, I just felt for their suffering, sorry you know, but it didn\u2019t help me much.",
        "Q: So, despite much questioning, I -- I know that you\u2019ve checked whether any Jews\nhad survived in Chadbush, and there were --",
        "A: None.",
        "Q: -- there were none left.",
        "A: None. Zero.",
        "Q: So, of your family of six, only your brother in Israel --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- 1s known to have survived?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Do you have any other -- any other information at all about members of your\nfamily?",
        "A: I checked when they had one time -- the Red Cross arranged one time a reunion\nwith other who have been with me in Auschwitz. And so I had left all names, and all\nwhatever the questions what they gave me to fill out, and for awhile they send me a\nletter that they have everything, they keep on checking. Then, maybe six months later,\nor a year later, they send me another letter, they did their best, but they can never could\nplace it -- any -- any of the names that I requested.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. In the years since then, have you ever gone back to that area, or ever felt a\nwish to?",
        "A: You mean my birth home?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. This was in 1945. Finally, I was -- the last dead march -- I -- I made more than\none dead march, that was made in the end of December, between Christmas and New\nYear. The first dead march was from Auschwitz over Yaveeshavitz to Buchenwald.\nThen, from Buchenwald I\u2019d say where I was 1n a subcamp from Buchenwald, the\nname was Traylitz, this is near Leipzig. And around early April, or the end of March\nthey say the -- the allied forces start to get closer. Well, the first thing, they put us for a\nrecreation, too, they kept on. They kept us in two weeks what 1s -- you know, I don\u2019t\nwant go into details, because y -- it -- I will never be able to even finish, even if you\nstay a whole week. It was -- I did survive the dead march. They kept us on trains, we\nused to go in the woods for a day. I just found out later that they used to, every day,\nfrom one place to the other place was maybe 10 - 15 kilometers, th-the -- they have\nbeen -- our train was on a one track line. We didn\u2019t go nowhere, we just went from one\nplace, and the next day we went back to the other place. And we thought -- we didn\u2019t\nrealize that this is the same place, we didn\u2019t go nowhere. And I have been, for two\nweeks -- not me only, but all of us who survive what actually -- in a few thousand they\nstarted off when they evacuate us, until to the end, maybe was 50 - 60 left. In\nthousands, the all other been on the -- on the roads and the ditches, their bodies was\nlaying because they have been shot, they have been exhausted from walking,\nwhatever, and automatically, if you couldn\u2019t walk, automatically the guard shot you.\nDoesn\u2019t make any difference. But I survived over there. So the last thing, I arrived in\nTheresienstadt. And this was -- the same way, you know, I -- I -- must be early of\nApril. And at this time, when I arrived in Theresienstadt actually, I was probably 99\npercent point nine dead, actually. I have very little signs that I\u2019m alive, actually. And\nin fact, it was in -- a coincidence that -- even that I reached Theresienstadt, because in\nLitenritz, one night, when they -- those all who -- who still have been alive, they\nbrought us first the night before -- we have been in I think the camp called Litenritz,\nand this was terrible condi -- conditions. And being two weeks without food, without\nwater, even the little food what we used to get, but without this [indecipherable] it\ndidn\u2019t -- we have not been far away in 100 percent to be dead. And what had happened\nin this Litenritz actually, that they said in the morning they going to serve us coffee, a\nhot, liquid something, whatever. And over there the barracks didn\u2019t had even floors,\nand laying in mud, you didn\u2019t had no bunkbeds, nothing. If you laid down for the night\nto rest, or to sleep, how you call it, you laid in the mud. But nothing to -- less, and\nnothing more but in the mud. And this was a terrible things, without everything, but a\nhuman, if you have anything, any instinct being a human, you know that this doesn\u2019t\ngo farther. I didn\u2019t slept even the whole night, but probably I would have been fall\nasleep, and waited actually that I\u2019m going to get -- I know it would be a little bit dark,\nmud, whatever they called it, they called it coffee, but we get it. And we used to carry\nalways a can, a rusted can if they found it, if somebody going to give us something,\nthat we have a can to take the food. And early in the morning, they called you, coffee.\nAnd I was trying to be from the first, because I know it if I don\u2019t go to the first, I will\nnever reach any more what they gave you. I was among the first, and they gave me the\namount what -- in my rusted coffee, and I just pour it in -- in my body, whatever they\ngave it to me. I -- I don\u2019t know til today what it was. I just poured it in. And took a few\nhours, and they told us that the guards will come, they will take us to the next camp.\nWe heard about Theresienstadt, we know that Theresienstadt is not actually a\nconcentration camp, it\u2019s a model camp. We -- we had not been afraid, we cannot go --\nwe cannot lose now, see, it cannot be worse than it is. And we have been happy that\nfinally -- that we will -- we will reach Theresienstadt, but not always what you think is\nhappening. For some reason, after this, I got diarrhea, and this was outside, actually, I\ndidn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think they even had toilets in this camp, wherever. And I -- I was\ndehydrated, I could tell, I mean, I didn\u2019t had it before because I was two weeks\nwithout food, without water. I was fairly dehydrated and I couldn\u2019t get up. My friends,\nwhat we -- I know them from Auschwitz still, they came by and they said good news,\n[indecipherable] you know, we going to come to Theresienstadt in the next hour or\ntwo. And I told the one that I know them very well, w-was intimate friendship in\nAuschwitz, in Yaveeshavitz. His name was Yankey. And I told him, \u201cYankila, it\u2019s too\nlate for me.\u201d And he said, \u201cIn the all suffering what you know what you had in\nAuschwitz, in the coal mine, and everything,\u201d he said -- he said, \u201cdon\u2019t make me leave\nyou here.\u201d And they actually risked their lives, two of them, and they practically\ncarried me in to Theresienstadt. But still I never had any hope that I will be able to\nwalk, or for freedom. I realized it\u2019s too late even to have any hope. [indecipherable]\nshow it, actually, when we came to Theresienstadt we look like animals, we act like\nanimals. Those who still could walk were -- whatever they start to give us some\nrations, some of them who have been stronger, they used to see that -- used to pass by\nwagons that went to the kitchen for the supplies, and they used to highjack those\nwagons and steal everything out, bread, or potatoes, or whatever they have over there.\nAnd those people from Theresienstadt, those inmates, they have been scared of us like\nwild animals, and it\u2019s not just [indecipherable], we have been. We look like animals\n[indecipherable] but after they too start to get help more or less, that some ladies,\nnurses came in, and they start to clean us up, because I still had the same clothing, the\nsame shirt, or whatever, when I left Auschwitz, this was the end of -- of December.\nAnd I never had another -- never changed nothing, and this was already practically the\nend of April, where they took everything what we took off they burned it on the spot,\nand they gave us some clothing, more or less. And they bathed us, and shaved us. I\nmean, they cleaned us up, they disinfect us, more or less. And then we heard it already,\nthat bring in in Switzerland, in Schwietz, they used to send food o-over to\nTheresienstadt. Not only food, [indecipherable] the best food, you know, white bread,\nand cheeses, and -- and ham, sausage, oh, the best from the best practically. But people\n-- people kept on dying like flies, actually. When they start to eat, this was the end of\nit. | actually, the beginning, I -- I felt that I ate, and I could take food, and I got -- felt\nthat every day I\u2019d get stronger and feel better. And for some reason too, I don\u2019t know\nwhy, they picked me over there in Theresienstadt to be in charge of the food supply.\nTo give out, to see how many rations to prepare were there -- for the people who have\nbeen over there. There a certain amount of barracks, you know. One barrack was also -\n- they called it a hospital, but the truth 1s 1t was like a dump. It was a matter, you know,\nthey put you in, you couldn\u2019t walk any more, they put you in in the bed. They know it,\nnot in a matter of a day, but in an hour, you will be dead, so they throw you out, and\nthey put in another body in the bed. And so went on -- actually 99 percent all died,\nactually. Was no doctors, no nurses, and -- and I could feel that I get better and\neverything, but suddenly, I don\u2019t know what went bad, or what went wrong, or maybe\nbecause I was in close contact, I used -- I had to go in in this barrack every day and\ncount people who have been still alive. And the -- to know, you know, we need for this\nhospi -- the hospital, they called it a hospital. We need 50 rations, 60 rations. I used to,\nyou know, the dead have been on the g -- floor already, on the ground, I don\u2019t know\neven if it was a floor over there. On the ground, and the living -- so I count the living\nso there\u2019s how many rations to prepare. And I don\u2019t know, in a matter of in a week or\ntwo, I just caught something like a th -- a disease, but I -- I cannot explain it, I don\u2019t\nknow, and I will not know even, what had happened. For some reason, if it\u2019s good\nfood, whatever it was over there, and I could have as much as I desire and everything.\nIt was in a certain day, was like my mole was sealed off everything. I couldn\u2019t take it, I\ncouldn\u2019t look it. I used to go ahead, and take a nice roll, white roll, and put down all\nkind cheeses and sausage, whatever. And I told them -- this was -- not far away was a\npark over there, I says I going to sit on the bench in the park, and I will get an appetite,\neventually, I believe. Nothing helped. So I start to go right away, backwards, and it\ndoesn\u2019t take long. Whatever I gained, I lost much, much quicker than it took me to\ngain. And I couldn\u2019t walk any more either. And [indecipherable] say well, you have --\nsaid you -- you go to the hospital. I know it, what it is, but it was not -- it didn\u2019t matter\nto me, it was no difference. I realized whatever it is, it\u2019s too late for me. I went to the\nhospital, as I mentioned. It was no nurse, it was no doctor, I mean nothing. I just laid,\nthe same way, waiting, until they dump me out right there on the floor with the dead.\nWhy and what [indecipherable] behind my understanding, and how to tell, how to\nexplain, I did got over it. I did survive.",
        "Q: When you were close to death before, and your two friends saved you --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- your friends from Auschwitz. Was there anybody who could assist you at this\ntime in the hospital, and keep you going [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, I never saw them any more. I mean, they came. I -- later I heard about it, that\nthey -- they lived in Munich, around, they -- they did a lot of business like -- like now,\nwhatever, they\u2019ve been fairly wealthy. They made money already, but I never did. I --\nI don\u2019t know. To be honest, I was too naive, or too spoiled. I didn\u2019t -- if you have been\nfrom a family, a needy family, and been poor, actually, you had ambitious to go try to\nmake some money, to have a nicer life. But us, I know it, it went from generation to\ngeneration, the kids get older, the parents are tired, and you know, you take over. And\nI didn\u2019t realize, you know, that you have to work, even, for a living. I -- I thought it --\nit comes automatically, like this -- and special when I saw what had happened to our\nfamily, and to our wealth, and to our money, I practically hated money, and I didn\u2019t\nwant to have no part of it. I was not smart enough. And later, when I came to the\nUnited States, I regretted it, I saw it, I made a mistake.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll get to that, but when you -- when you were close to death in Theresienstadt,\nthere were -- really, you just recovered on your own.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You became able to eat. There was no friend to help you, or to keep you going?",
        "A: There\u2019s nothing what you could help it. Over there was like I mentioned it, it was\nstrictly a matter of waiting until actually you disappeared, you know, you -- you died.",
        "Q: Or, as in your case, you slowly gain strength.",
        "A: In my case, I don\u2019t know how you -- I don\u2019t know why, I just didn\u2019t drop dead.",
        "Q: What kept you going, do you think? You must have thought a lot about this during\nall --",
        "A: To be honest -- to be honest, and I ha -- I was asked qu-questions, the same\nquestions which you ask me right now. As far as I can recall, I try a lot of the time to\nrecall things from home, the normal things, until I was arrested, until I -- I came to\nAuschwitz, and I could never figure out, and I don\u2019t think I did ever actually fight for\nmy life. And actually what I had experienced, after I was liberated, I suffered more\nwhen I was liberated, and -- and I -- I am alive, than being actually in Auschwitz, and\nworking in the coal mine. Because over there you didn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t think about\nnothing else.",
        "Q: What did that feel like? You\u2019ve mentioned that before, that feeling, the realization\nthat you\u2019d survived, and that you\u2019d lost everyone else. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s guilt,\nor coming to terms with it?",
        "A: Very, very bad. Very bad. I have always questioned why me. I have brothers, an\nother one have been much nicer in anything, you know, with feelings, or poor people,\nwhatever, and I, to be honest with you, I was not as smart as my brothers, you know,\nwith feelings. And this bothered me, questioned me, why did I survive?",
        "Q: Did you come to terms with that in any way, sort of feeling, well it -- I\u2019m -- \u2019m\nhere, and can tell the story, or --",
        "A: No, no. No, in fact, when I worked, I worked here in the same company since I\ncame here to the States, and I worked 38 years, and -- and -- in the office is\nmanagement, was a lot of Jews, but in the factory where I worked actually, was very\nfew Jews, and later when I -- in the beginning I couldn\u2019t speak English, but actually it\nwas maybe a favor for me. But later used to come people who know it a little bit about\nthe Holocaust, and the concentration camps, they used to ask me if I was mistreated, or\nif I didn\u2019t had enough food. And I always told them no, and the reason was simple. It\u2019s\nin mine character, this actually how I was raised. I hate to see that somebody has\nsympathy for me. I rather see somebody will help me, and have physical feelings, than\nsomebody will tell me he has sympathy for me because I suffered. This I cannot take.\nPains I can take it, but not this sympathy, no.",
        "Q: Now, you spoke of Mr. Wolfe, who was the -- the boss, I think, of the company.",
        "A: Yeah, he was the boss, yeah, mist --",
        "Q: Is he still alive?",
        "A: He 1s alive. I know, more or less like friends. He treat me like in the family. On all\noccasions, Jewish holidays, if he makes anything for his family, we always on the list.\nIn his home, or in a hotel, or whatever. In fact, when I got sick, he didn\u2019t hear it from\nme -- I used to come visit the factory every few weeks. He didn\u2019t heard from me, he\ncalled home, he mentioned it right away, I know it\u2019s not right. And finally I told him\nthe story. Buti -- it cannot be a nicer person than Mr. Wolfe is.",
        "Q: We -- we should perhaps move forward to that -- to that time when --",
        "A: That\u2019s all right.",
        "Q: -- would be 50 years ago, almost -- almost to the day.",
        "A: Yeah, it -- that\u2019s right, in October, I think the 26\" of October, 1949, I arrived in\nGermany, on a military boat. The boat\u2019s name was SS General Howe. It took us 16\ndays from Bremen to touch the soil of the United States. And I remember when I was\nin Germany, | -- I worked -- I always -- I did -- I mentioned it. When I got in touch\nthat I found my brother, he 1s in Israel, and he kept on writing me letter, don\u2019t do\nfoolish things, don\u2019t play the black market. Don\u2019t do nothing, cause it\u2019s not legal, he\nwarned me. He says, \u201cYou come here, you going to have everything. You don\u2019t have\nto worry now, think about nothing. You come here.\u201d And finally, I was prepared,\nactually. I bought things -- necessary things, because in Germany I worked for the ira -\n- UNRRA. I always made fairly good money.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the United Nations relief agency.",
        "A: Right, right. I made money, and I didn\u2019t made money, you know, just to have extra\nmoney. I made real nice, and I bought up -- if I go to Israel, to be established there,\nhave things necessary, electrical things, or whatever. And I had, I think, three cases,\nthree large cases already nailed up to go along, and I was, the last year actually, in \u201948\n-- before I was in a sanatorium, in Dagaloff, this is the outskirts of Stuttgart, a very\nbeautiful place, but later they liquidated this camp, and the Stuttgart was a camp in the\nReinspookstrasser, which is famous. I have a book they actually gave it to me, you\nknow, the whole thing, the activities, what it was, in sh -- Reinspookstrasser. And\nthere have been respectable people, and because the other [indecipherable] was\nliquidated, so they called me, and they ask me if I want to take over food supply, and\nto be in charge like a chef, they call it a boss, over there on the Reinspookstrasser. I -- I\ndidn\u2019t know, you know, to deal in black market, but I know it that I have to ha -- get a\njob. So I accepted it, and I was very respected by them, and they tried to do anything,\nwhatever possible, to satisfy me. I was [indecipherable] alone. Finally it happened one\nSunday. I was not working, but I came -- I used to live -- I lived still in Dagaloff, and I\ncame down to the Reinspookstrasser, but this was the DP camp in Stuttgart, and I\nnotice what I didn\u2019t like. I noticed that they -- they have over there, in every DP camp,\nthey have their own police. It was Jewish policemen, what been -- like you had a job,\nwhatever it was necessary to keep everything in order. And they --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",

        "A: They used to take boys from 18 years, even mine age. I was at this time 26 year, 25\n-- 26 years old, and they used to |-like round them up, get them, they put them in a\nroom like a -- in a jail more or less, took them away, and the next day trucks from the\nJewish brigade come, and they took you to Bremen, whatever, to send them to Israel.\nAnd this I didn\u2019t like it.",
        "Q: Oh, they were involuntary?",
        "A: Involuntary, exactly. Involuntarily.",
        "Q: And I -- didn\u2019t know this went on, so --",
        "A: And when I saw this, it reminded me too much of it.",
        "Q: They were in fact giving them a good life, and these were displaced persons, but\nwhy --",
        "A: No [indecipherable]",
        "Q: But why did they do it?",
        "A: -- they have been told. From the -- you know, from the Israeli government, whoever\nwas, you know, that this is the only way to get the young people away from the black\nmarket, you know, just to bring them to Israel, they needed soldiers, I -- I don\u2019t know\nwhy. But when this -- I saw it then on the spot, I said, \u201cForce, that\u2019s -- it\u2019s out of the\nquestion.\u201d And then I tried to think -- I almost was ready to leave to go to Israel, and\nthen I came -- you know, when you think about this, come to you other things. And I\nknow it that my brother is not a ha -- a wealthy person, he worked for the government,\nhe had a good job, a high position, everything, but far from saying, you know, he\u2019s\nable, yes, like he wrote in the letters, you don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be taken care of,\neverything. And in -- they had already at this time, they had a boy maybe four or five\nyears old. He was born in \u00b040, actually he was six year -- no, older than this, seven,\neight years, right? Yeah, he was born in \u201940. And -- and they keep on th -- my thinking\n-- yeah, I said, \u201cIf I will come over there, you hadn\u2019t bought even a bed already, where\nI gonna sleep?\u201d He said he gonna take away from his wife, and his kid, you know, and\ntry to give it to me. And I said no, this will not work. I\u2019m not the type.",
        "Q: Did you at the same time long to be with him, since you\u2019d lost all your family?",
        "A: In one way, yes, in the other way I was afraid he gonna think that he owns his life\nfor me. I got scared, I said there\u2019s no way in the world, it will not work. And then I\nfigured another thing. If I come to Israel, and Israel was a lot like my brother from my\nhome town, what that lived over there, so they knowed me, and they knowed the\nfamily. And I figured, you know, I was not -- I didn\u2019t had no trades. I was not educated\npractically, nothing. And I said whatever I going to do, you know, you should be --\nand especially you come from a small town like me, that this job is suitable for you,\nthis is your -- if in a too good home, to take a job, you know, like cleaning, I don\u2019t\nknow streets, or other thing. I said, the best thing is maybe to go to the United States,\nnobody knows me, I don\u2019t have no relatives, and I don\u2019t [indecipherable] this to be\nover there.",
        "Q: But that was scary, too.",
        "A: And how. This was more scary, and what more was thinking -- I thought to myself,\nwhat will I do over there? I cannot speak a word of English. I don\u2019t have no trade.\nYeah, what? Again go for charities -- you know, Jewish organizations to support? I\nsaid, I\u2019m not the type for it. I -- how can I do it? But I had a friend, he left in \u201946\nalready. He wa -- I was with him in Buchenwald down in Traylitz, actually, and he\nsurvived. He --",
        "Q: And what was his name?",
        "A: Bernard Fedderman. I was with him in Traylitz all the time. In fact, later even in\nTheresienstadt, when survived, and then he came to Stuttgart also, and Dagaloff, and\nthen we used to live together. He -- he wrote me -- he was constantly in contact with\nme. We w -- we have been actually -- we had a room, both of us together. So he\nalready had a kid, a first kid was born. You -- he -- he left, she was pregnant. He had\nhad already a kid. And he was a bookbinder here, because his parents had a\nbookbinder shop in Leipzig.",
        "Q: He -- when di -- when did he marry in Europe?",
        "A: Oh, he married in Stuttgart, actually, I was his witness, actually. His best -- we have\nbeen the closest friend, actually. You know, we both survived the impossible. He\nmarried in \u201945. I remember a chaplain in the army and everything. And just\n[indecipherable] called the name [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did he -- did he marry a survivor?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, he married a survivor. In fact, he ask me -- he 1s a very naive person,\nhonest, naive -- I -- to compare, was a crook. Things that he did a little bit here and\nthere, I was -- he send me, you know, he wouldn\u2019t do it, the things. He was something\n[indecipherable]. And so he -- he ask me what I think, if he should marry her. When I\nokayed, this when he married her. He had a ver -- very naive person. Very nice,\ndecent, person. Really, it\u2019s hard to find a person like him.",
        "Q: Now, in that time, immediately after liberation, and during the time people spent in\ndisplaced person\u2019s ca-camps, many marriages took place.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: It was very natural. But you were unusual in -- perhaps because you were shy, in\nwaiting a while? Or you just had not met the right person?",
        "A: It\u2019s a -- okay, I had -- this I answer for you -- can answer in -- really nice, and I\nanswer for you with honesty what it was. I come from a good home, and to be honest,\na lot of maybe special survivors who survived will not like it. But I didn\u2019t do nothing, I\ndidn\u2019t made money in Germany, and if any girl from a better home, you know, was\nplenty boys who had a lot of money and everything. They bought them clothing,\njewelry. They took practically the -- the best of the crop, you know? Just to tell you in\nplain words. I was falling behind, and because I was raised, and how it was, and I\ndidn\u2019t want the -- to go a little bit too deep in, you know, where -- where normally -- in\nnormal circumstances, I would never be associate, so I hold myself back. This is the\nreason, you know, I was not married, actually. I didn\u2019t look. If a Jewish girl what I\nactually -- she came from a better home a little bit, you know, like me, I didn\u2019t look for\nnothing more. She had the better offers than me, you know, financially speaking.",
        "Q: Do you think, too, that you wanted to begin to rebuild your life before you settled\ndown, was that part of 1t?",
        "A: I -- to be honest, I didn\u2019t know it, what to do, what not to do, where to go, where I\nwill not go.",
        "Q: It was just what happened.",
        "A: Yeah. One thing, actually, I was scared about America, wh-what will I do. But my\nfriend Bernard Fedderman, he kept -- I mean we -- we lived together for over a -- he\nleft in \u00b046, in beginning. We lived together, actually, for a whole year, so we know\neach other very well, and he know that I\u2019m not a lazy type, you know, I\u2019m willing to\ndo anything. And I will learn anything, although he kept on writing me, you don\u2019t have\nto be afraid for the United States. If you have [indecipherable], if you come here, if\nyou want to work, you can always find work. So he in -- is the one who encouraged\nme to come, and I think this actually why I did come, actually, his [indecipherable]\nencouragement, yeah.",
        "Q: And did he help you when you were here? Was he in this area?",
        "A: I came -- I was sponsper -- sponsored from the HIAS in Baltimore, and actually\nwhen I came to the States, right away somebody, you know, from the HIAS, they\nwaited for us with the boat when we landed, then they took us on trains, and they\nshipped us -- and the train embarked us in Baltimore. I had been 1n Baltimore, and it\nwas, for me, you know, special where I was -- I was living in Dagaloff, the outskirts of\nStuttgart. And, you know, I was used to nice, clean, life. And to me it felt -- Baltimore\n-- filthy, very bad. And I -- come to my mind I did make the biggest mistake.",

        "A: Right -- I mean -- no, the HIAS, actually [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Oh. Explain what that is.",
        "A: The HIAS is a Jewish relief organization. They took care of Jewish immigrants, no,\nand this had nothing to do with naturalization, only Jewish immigrant, if you didn\u2019t\nhad nobody to sponsor you, and so they sponsored, and they took the responsibility.\nAnd they have been real, unusually nice, you know, when we got off in the trains, they\nwaited for us, and right away they took us to hotel, you know. Not the best, hi -- but\nstill a hotel, and -- and they came every day, they ask you what you need, what you\ndon\u2019t need. And they offered me, you know, you need clothing? And I told them no, I\ndon\u2019t need clothing, I have two suitcases, big suitcases. I have clothing, I had tailor\nmade suits in Germany, over there. He said, \u201cShoes?\u201d And then he told me, \u201cOver\nhere, you know, there\u2019s a li -- clothing is a little bit different. Why don\u2019t you -- you\nknow, we give you money, go buy yourself.\u201d I says, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t need to buy, and I\ndon\u2019t take.\u201d They offered me s-schooling, I can go -- they know that I don\u2019t speak\nEnglish, and so they said, \u201cHow about we gonna give you -- not in the hotel, we gonna\nrent you a room in a house, you live over there in the house. We will pay all expensive\n-- all what you need, food and everything, we will pay. You go to school and learn\nEnglish.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go to school. I -- I\u2019m not educated, and I will not\n-- I will not -- not looking to get educated in the United States.\u201d [indecipherable] what\nyou wanted. I says, \u201cI want a job.\u201d Well, they took me to several places here and there,\nand it didn\u2019t worked out. And a lot of places even the owner was Jewish, he said all his\nemployees are non-Jews, and they don\u2019t think it will work out. And so di-didn\u2019t get.\nThey kept on -- said oh you be pensh -- patient, we take care of everything, you just\nstay over there. And I disliked everything. Baltimore, and the du -- whatever they\nasked me, I refused to take it.",
        "Q: How long did --",
        "A: I never took it, and I\u2019m proud of it.",
        "Q: And how long did this period go on?",
        "A: This went on actually, like for two weeks. And then my friend, Fedderman, he was\nalready established, they had one kid, a boy, and all this. And he lived already in a\nhouse. He made fairly good money already, you know, for me, I thought, you know, I-\nI'd be a king if the -- if I be able to make as money -- much money as him. And no --\nhe came over to Baltimore, and he realized that I am miserable, and he said, \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you come with me to Washington?\u201d And he says, \u201cWe have a extra room.\u201d They\nhad a three bedroom house. He says, \u201cYou can live over there in the house with us,\nyou eat with us, and every,\u201d -- he say, \u201cuntil you get a job, and you have some\nmoney.\u201d He say, \u201cYou can pay me later, whatever you feel to pay me for -- for this,\u201d\nto live over there.

        "Q: And where was that?",
        "A: In Washington.",
        "Q: I was just wondering what part of the city, and --",
        "A: Oh, he used to live -- the first house where he had, that he lived was on Shepherd\nStreet, northwest. Was not far from Georgia Avenue, Shepherd. Sh -- I think Shepherd,\nand let\u2019s see, 12 - 13, maybe Seventh Street was Georgia Avenue. Around nine -- ninth\ns -- Ninth Street, north Shepherd, nine northwest.",
        "Q: A sort of tree lined streets, Washington neighborhood.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, and I thought he\u2019s a king, you know. I would never expect, you know,\nthat he has such nice life, you know, he married, and he has a kid, and he has a house,\nand he has a job. In the beginning, actually, he told me if I wanted, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t\nhave to do nothing cause I tell you.\u201d But if I wanted, he can tell -- take me where he\nwas by this bookbinder. And he will ask him ahead of time if he can bring in, you\nknow, somebody, a helper, or -- I didn\u2019t know nothing about bo-bookbinding. And so\nhe took me along where he worked, and the owner was Gentile. And he was a elderly\nperson, probably in the upper 70\u2019s. But he was very, unusually nice, and friendly, and\nhe showed me things to help around over there, all kind jobs, and --",
        "Q: You were a nice looking young man in a very good suit.",
        "A: This -- this I don\u2019t know. This I couldn\u2019t tell. But he was very, very pleased.\nWhatever he told me, I -- I tried to do it the best what a human can do, tried to please\nhim. And he recognized this, and so he right away, he had the respect, you know, that\nI\u2019m not just coming in. What had happened was over there a big [indecipherable]\nactually he paid me well, like paid me actually in 1949, about a dollar an hour, what\nthis was a -- a lot, actually, it was good money. But it got slow. I couldn\u2019t speak\nEnglish, and I was over there a day, and so he told me to clean up the supply where\nthey kept, and this probably was never cleaned. So I really did a job what nobody\nwould do, you know. [indecipherable] or not, I don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t make any\ndifference, but nobody would do it, something like this. I took everything out, and\ndusted, and I ate -- my dust choked me, but I did it. And when he came, it was clean.\nHis face was smiling, he looked at me. Tha -- si -- comple -- he didn\u2019t recognize even,\nbut it was, I cleaned it out so. And it was on -- very slow other days. I told my friend, I\nsaid, \u201cBernard, tell Mr. Gruver that I don\u2019t want that he pays me if I don\u2019t do no\nwork.\u201d If I don\u2019t work, I don\u2019t want it that he pays me money I didn\u2019t deserve. Well,\nhe went over, and told him, and he came back, and he laughed and -- and he said, \u201cOh,\ndon\u2019t worry,\u201d you know, \u201cyou'll be slow another day, it will be here plenty work for\nyou, come and work.\u201d I was over there maybe a whole week longer, and it didn\u2019t come\nin too much work, and I was still doing nothing practically, here and there something.\nSo I told him I don\u2019t want him that he pays me if I didn\u2019t work for it. And I left. And\nthen I went to the Jewish social organization, actually they used to be not far away\nfrom Shepherd Street, even over there. I forgot the street, but it was pretty close. And I\ntold them I want a -- a job. So they called up the American Wholesale where Mr.\nWolfe is. He was -- at this time, his brother-in-law -- he married to the family from the\nowners. His name was Krepshaw, David Krepshaw. And he called up them if they\nhave an opening, and they told him yes. They told me how to get there, and whatever.\nSo I went over there, they used to be located on Rhode Island Avenue, Fourth Street.\nAnd I went over there, and they had somebody, an American who is Polish descent, so\nhe -- he translated here, because I didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t speak a word of English. So right\naway, the -- the same way, whatever I did, I tried to do my best because somebody\nwould tell me to move a house, and it wouldn\u2019t be hard for me, I would probably move\nit. I did my best, and they had recognition. They saw it was right. They start right away\nto advance me. They told me that I will be a foreman, a working foreman, and they\nwill learn me cutting. Course, it\u2019s a mattress company, you know, Serta, and they will\nlearn me to be a cutter. It sound to me all right.",
        "Q: Cutting metal?",
        "A: No, mattress fabrics.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: For mattresses, covers.",
        "Q: Oh, yes.",
        "A: I was, and they assigned me the sewing room, what most of them have been women\nactually, worked over there. Well, they learned me do the cutting, and they told me all\nthe -- they start me off with 75 cents an hour. You know, he told me that s -- 75 he\ndoes only because I\u2019m in a concentration camp, you know, a refugee. Because he pays\n-- he start off the people normally, with 50 cents an hour. So he gave me 75, and -- and\nfrom time to time he told me -- he came over there, they liked 1t, what I did, whatever.\nAnd he gave me like full charge, he says, \u201cYou can work overtime in the evening. You\nwant stay, stay as long as you want. I\u2019m going to have one and a half, you know. And\nif you want come in Saturday to clean up the place, so you come in Saturday, and\nclean up the place.\u201d And I really cleaned, really, not like these other people. And I\nmade myself [indecipherable] even at 75 cents, by p-putting in extra hours. Every day\nan hour, and Saturday five, six hours. It was alright, but I never figured anyway that I\nwill stay in a factory. It was a little bit out of my line, I would never use, you know, a\nbrain thing, and I have to work for somebody. But what can you do? I -- I couldn\u2019t do\nnothing better, either, so I kept on staying here, but they kept on raising always a little\nbit here, a little bit there, this holiday. And [indecipherable] I figured I start from the\nbeginning, start again from the bottom, I don\u2019t know, so I -- I tried to stay with them.\nAnd I stayed with them until actually -- took a little while, and they made me a\nsupervisor over there, the -- the sewing room was under my charge completely. And\nthey let me do anything that I wanted to do, you know, and well, this made me feel\nbetter, too.",
        "Q: So you were in -- supervising a number of other people as time went by?",
        "A: Yeah, about 25 people, yeah. Men and women.",
        "Q: A fairly responsible job.",
        "A: It\u2019s not easy. But I know it, you know, if you have to do it, it doesn\u2019t make any\ndifferent.",
        "Q: And 1s that where you s -- you spent your w -- your career, with that same\ncompany?",
        "A: Yeah, I retired after 38 years, 38 years I was with the company, never worked for\nnobody else, except a couple weeks 1n the bookbinding shop where my friend\nFedderman worked.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: It\u2019s quite a story, really. They were -- they were lucky to have you, and I\u2019m sure\nyou --",
        "A: Yeah, they have been very pleased, especially Mr. Wolfe was at this time, like a\nmanager in the division, they had other divisions, too. They used to have appliances\ndistributors.",
        "Q: And with the group -- the area you were with, that was called American Mattress?",
        "A: Wholesaler.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, American Wholesale Company.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, American Wholesaler, because they have several divisions in -- well,\nthe management was pretty smart, very, very smart, because if one division didn\u2019t do\nbusiness, then the other division covered. And this was very well organized.",
        "Q: And your -- your comfort in English just developed over time?",
        "A: L used to go to the Americanization school, nights, over there, and in the beginning\nI thought I will never learn. But you know, I always used public transportation, like I\nused to go with streetcar to work, and back, and always people tried [indecipherable]\nsay it, and I used to tell them I cannot speak much English, what it all, it\u2019s true, oh and\nthey made me compliments, oh you speak so good, so nice. I -- I know this was a\ncompliment, this was not the truth. But eventually, 1t took a few months, then\nsuddenly, you know, what more I tried to talk English, the more I realized I -- it\ncomes. You have just to be patient.",
        "Q: And you moved out of your -- your room in Bernard Fedderman\u2019s home in time?",
        "A: Yeah, they bought another home, and it was a little bit smaller. So I moved out, I\ndid appreciate, you know, I stayed with him this time, and meanwhile, I got involved,\nyou know, I had my wife, she\u2019s actually from Stuttgart. And she was like a girlfriend,\nbut we always have been in contact with each other, we all glad to see each other.",
        "Q: You met at a -- at a -- at a bus stop. Is that right, in 19 --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- w-would that have been in 1940 -- \u201946?",
        "A: Six, yeah, in 1946 I met her. You know, I was lonesome. Nothing even -- you\nknow, I had a job what I was pleased, I was the chef in the supplies, and everything,\nbut I still was alone, you know. I di -- didn\u2019t had no relatives. I didn\u2019t have nobody,\njust some boys, you know from the concentration camp, we used to be friends, this\nwas all. And when I met her, actually, she was a -- more than just a g -- really good\nlooking girl.",
        "Q: Actually, tell me -- tell me that -- your wife\u2019s full name, and more about her family\nbackground.",
        "A: Her full name is Herta, and her birth name is Nagel, N-a-g-e-l. And -- I mean, I\ndidn\u2019t know it actually, until went a little bit longer. We had a date here, and there, and\nthen she invited me to her home, and right away her mother was paralyze -- par-\nparalyzed, she had a stroke. But, win -- wonderful people, real nice. Her father was\nvery much involve anti-Nazi. He was picked up, e-even was jailed, he almost went to\nDachau, the same way, for talking, you know. If you talk there too much --",
        "Q: And were they a -- were they a Jewish family?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Oh. I had assumed they were. So this is interesting.",
        "A: No, no, no, isn\u2019t a Jew, but very decent people. And I come over there, I felt a little\nbit, you know, what I was missing. A home, more or less. And in fact, she used to take\ncare like even my shirts, underwear, whatever, she took it home, and washed it, and\nthey pressed it, and brought it back. They got the touch.",
        "Q: Tell me what they felt like, because you would be so desperately alone, I would\nthink.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I was very desperately alone, no doubt about it. And when I was here, in\nthe beginning I came -- I used to go to the Jewish community center, and I used to\nmeet the Jewish girls, too. And I went out with them here and there. Was one time I\nremember I went out with a Jewish girl -- no -- yeah, it was in the Jewish community\ncenter. And we talked, and talked, and you know, it\u2019s almost was time to leave the\ncenter, and she asked -- she ask me, \u201cWhere\u2019s you car?\u201d And this right away gave me\na pretty bad feeling, an impression. I was happy I had to pay a token, not\n[indecipherable] a car. And I didn\u2019t felt right, actually. And li --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Morris Kornberg. This is tape number three, side A. Continue to tell me the story\nof your meeting your wife, and your marriage.",
        "A: Oh, well actually, I kept on -- have more feelings from time to time. When I left\nGermany, actually, I figured I don\u2019t want to take responsibility to be married over\nthere, bring here somebody, you know, because I didn\u2019t know to -- how -- even being\nalone, how I will be able to get along. But later, I felt that I\u2019m missing, actually, I\nmissed her very much, to a great extent. And the beginning actually, they said in the\nAmericanization school, they used to help me, the principal over there, he ask me, you\nknow it, and I told him I have over there a girlfriend, she\u2019s in Germany. So he used to\nwrite to the consul about it, and especially Cy Wolfe actually, he wrote letters to the\nconsul too. And she ha -- was registered already, you know, she had a uncle here in\nLong Island that she wanted to co -- times were bad in -- in Germany, wa -- so she\nwanted to come here, so finally with the help and Cy Wolfe, well, she had a chance.\nShe came two years later. When she came here, she had -- right away she got a job,\nand she made more mon -- better than me. She worked in the House office building.",
        "Q: You -- that was -- she would in fact herself be -- being so brave to make that trip, to\nstart a new life.",
        "A: Oh, sure. You know, she had a -- her father was a older -- I mean, elderly person.\nYou know [indecipherable] stayed because they have to take care of their parents. Her\nmother was paralyzed, and everything.",
        "Q: Did she have brothers or sisters? Did she have brothers or sisters?",
        "A: Yeah, she had one sister, and she was 18 years older than her, you know, she had a\n-- one sister. But in the beginning they didn\u2019t like it that she leaves, but eventually --\nyou know, her mother knowed me, and everything, and she thought with somebody\nelse that she wouldn\u2019t know it, she wouldn\u2019t let her go. But because she knowed me,\nso she agreed, you know, that she can go.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did either you, or your wife\u2019s family have any reservations because you\nwere -- she was Gentile, and you were Jewish?",
        "A: I wrote this to mine brother, and -- about it, and he answered me, he said in -- you\nknow, we are from a strict Orthodox family, he wrote me this letter, as much suffering\nI had to go through, I can do whatever I feel, he feels, you know, that it will be\njustified [indecipherable]. And then when she came here, actually, I got in touch --\nwhat do they call them? The -- the Hebrew congregat -- you know, the Reform\nsynagogue, actually. And I met over there sh -- he was assistant rabbi, Rabbi Schiff, I\ndon\u2019t know if he\u2019s still alive. He was teaching in the -- I think Harvard School, too, as\na professor, you know, a nice person, he was from Germany. And I met him, and\nRabbi Gerstenfeld too, you know, he was the main rabbi. And Rabbi Schiff married us,\nactually, in there.",
        "Q: 1951.",
        "A: \u00b052, I think.",
        "Q: Oh, 52.",
        "A: Yeah, \u201952 [inaudible]. She came in \u201951.",
        "Q: And you\u2019d corresponded during that time?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, constantly, you know. We write [indecipherable] she right away,\nsecond week she came, she went, took a job, actually.",
        "Q: And did she speak any English when she came?",
        "A: No, but she did all this -- a -- a lot of -- she did typing, and typing actually, this for\nher -- she was trained in Germany. In Germany, actually, if you are trained, you know\nwhat you are doing, too.",
        "Q: They are really good training.",
        "A: It\u2019s not here. And [indecipherable] respected her work, actually, he liked it very\nmuch. And she had a chance, because she typed the whole day, which she learned\n[indecipherable] coming home, you know, watch TV. Yeah, she didn\u2019t go to the\nAmer-Americanization school, I did.",
        "Q: Yeah, and by then, you we -- you were speaking English --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: -- the language --",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t speak good English today, but I still am speaking.",
        "Q: Tell me more about the things that you and your wife shared in common.",
        "A: Oh, in the beginning was pretty hard life. I mean, we didn\u2019t had nothing, but we\ndidn\u2019t felt, you know, that it will not be hard. We both shared. She was working, and I\nwas working, and tried to save. And the reason for saving was not so much that I liked\nto save to get -- to put a lot of things was I wanted, and fe -- and have feelings that I\ncannot afford to satisfy this, but I know it can come a time when are -- you are not able\nany more to do work, whatever it is, and you fall -- want to fall a burden or nothing.\nBut this was mine strongest point for the -- that it is necessary to save. When the time\ncomes that I cannot afford, that my health does not allow me, that I still have to look\nfor my savings to support me. And we actually, this way, thanks God with savings, we\ngot adjusted to a nice life, not to waste, or not what -- what it was necessary. So we did\nsome saving. And I\u2019m proud to say, actually, that since I was involved with the\nHolocaust museum, and I was -- I felt that the museum is a great institution for -- not\nonly for survivors, but for human -- humanity, for everyone. And I never dreamed that\nI will -- we will be able to afford to contribute, but thanks God we did contribute\nhundred thousand dollars to the Holocaust museum. This, at least, makes me proud of\nmyself.",
        "Q: That\u2019s -- I didn\u2019t know that, and that\u2019s really quite wonderful that you --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- that you -- that you could. Cause I can think of -- [indecipherable] I -- I really\nthink that is -- think the museum performs this wonderful role --",
        "A: I think so, too.",
        "Q: -- of making sure 1t won\u2019t happen again.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s the best institution, actually. It\u2019s a safeguard for the next generations.",
        "Q: Yes. Now, both you and your wife, although you had different faiths that you\u2019ve\ngrown up in, probably --",
        "A: Yes, she has -- she actually accepted the Jewish faith, actually.",
        "Q: Yeah -- no, I meant that your -- your childhood would have been spent in different\nfaiths, but you would -- you would ha -- after your marriage, you\u2019ve shared the same\nfaith, and also a -- probably both of you had known some degree of hardship. Even\nyour wife had experienced the war. So probably your values were similar.",
        "A: She was very cooperative, actually. She had feelings, you know, to follow myself,\nso we never had any complications. Even we have not been the same faith, in the\nbeginning, but she accepted to follow me.",
        "Q: Yeah. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m asking these questions, too, knowing that a great many of the\nsurvivors with experiences something like yours, perhaps for shorter periods, tended to\nmarry survivors. And that\u2019s really why I\u2019m probing with these questions.",
        "A: Right. Yeah, this is true, but like I mentioned, actually, I had bad experience when I\nhad a friend to me what -- she was devoted to me, and this -- and I miss her very much,\nso this makes a strong friendship, and this why actually I was waiting until she had a\nchance to come over here, and to share a life together, that we do share, because we\nhave been married in \u201952. It\u2019s actually 47 years actually are married.",
        "Q: Yeah. Now did you -- you don\u2019t have children, is that right?",
        "A: Unfortunately, my wife was one time pregnant, but we didn\u2019t have the experience,\nyou know, how to be careful, whatever, in the pregnancy. She had a miscarriage, and it\nupset us both, but in the other hand, it didn\u2019t change our life, either, actually. I always\nfigured, if something doesn\u2019t go our way, we have to accept it, because we never look\n-- she was trying to get medical help, and everything, but it didn\u2019t succeed, and so\nfinally we gave it up, to take it as it comes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I ask that only because I -- I understand some survivors have, because of\ntheir suffering, not wanted to have children, and you don\u2019t seem to be one of those\npeople who --",
        "A: No, it was not our intention. We wanted, actually, very bad. In the beginning, the\nfirst years, we couldn\u2019t afford to have it. We didn\u2019t feel, well 1f we gonna bring in a\nlife, and we have hardship to survive, but we always figured, when the time get better,\nwe save a little bit more, then we start it. And then we started, and it was too late, or\nwhatever it is, 1t just did not materialize.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Tell me about reli -- what your religion means to you, and do you go to\nsynagogue regularly?",
        "A: About religion, as I mentioned before, I was raised Orthodox, and I always felt in\nmy heart that the Jewish religion is the only practically religion, that you can believe in\nit, it has a ground to -- to believe in it. I -- b-but I respect any religion. I respect any\nperson who can hold up his custom, his religion, I respect very much. I am right -- no |\nam not a particular -- I wouldn\u2019t call myself I\u2019m a religious person, but I am very\ntraditional. In the past I remember the nice holidays, [indecipherable] and other things,\nin a clean, nice life. And I still try, you know, to resume those things. And to be honest\n[indecipherable] I was asked by kids in the school, and I lecture to them about the\nHolocaust, and they ask me if I believe in God. To answer this, it\u2019s very hard. In one\nway, it\u2019s pretty hard to believe, if --",
        "Q: I interrupted. You were telling me about the children asking do you believe in God.",
        "A: Yes. To answer you straight, what -- what the Jewish people -- nation, suffered, it\u2019s\nactually hard to believe in God, but I take mine whole strength in to believe, and I\u2019m\nnot so highly educated to be able to say that -- to believe, or not to believe, though I\nacc -- I accept that the easiest thing actually to believe, and continue believing.",
        "Q: And you followed all the traditions? They\u2019re part of your -- of your marriage and\nyour life?",
        "A: More or less. To tell the truth, more or less I follow it, and I enjoy it, but we don\u2019t\nrun constantly to the synagogue, but on the high holidays, we always attend the\nServices.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What about friendships in your life? You spoke of different ones during\nthe years when you were in camps. Have th -- have your friendships been enormously\nimportant?",
        "A: Oh sure, it\u2019s important, actually, when -- I cannot lie, because I don\u2019t have nobody\nleft. And so friendship is actually the most what we still have left over. I continue to be\nin friendly terms with old friends [indecipherable] around here. I feel I\u2019m blessed that\nwe have friends.",
        "Q: In the early years --",
        "A: Excuse me.",
        "Q: Yeah, in -- in the -- in your first years in this country, were you -- was your social\ngroup very much a group of survivors?",
        "A: More or less, yes, but we have a -- a lot of friends, you know, they\u2019re not been\nsurvivors, and a lot of Gentile families, what are very nice people, and decent people,\nand we enjoy very much to spend time with them together.",
        "Q: I was -- in -- in thinking about how you, I think, managed to -- to endure those\nyears of suffering, of extreme brutality and so on, and yet to come out of it and be able\nto be a sort of loving, warm person, I\u2019m guessing -- I -- I\u2019d like you to -- to tell me\nwhether you\u2019ve thought about how you were able to do that? Was it the -- the\nupbringing you had? The friendships? I -- I mean, there must be things that you\nthought of.",
        "A: As far as I know -- it\u2019s a very good question, but for me it\u2019s actually easy to answer\nit. They are up there, I think, my whole family, all brothers and sisters, how we have\nbeen raised by our parents. My parents, especially my father was very strict in\nbehaving, but I\u2019m really thankful for his -- that he raised us in a strict way, that I can\nhave the -- to understand, and to know the difference between good and bad. And we\nhave been raised -- and I think all my brothers know in our family, have been more or\nless actually, raised the right way, and to respect where we supposed to respect. And I\nfeel that I was blessed with a family like this.",
        "Q: I asked that question, too, knowing that many -- many survivors have found it\ndifficult to adjust to -- to life because of how much they suffered. Others too, have had\nfull and rounded s -- remarkably successful lives, but do you think that you often\nsuffer because of your earlier suffering? I was thinking about, does it show up in great\nanxiety, about your wife, for instance? If she\u2019s late coming home, do you feel, do you\nthink, more concerned than somebody else might be? Are you more anxious?",
        "A: It\u2019s no doubt any survivor, I don\u2019t care who it is, who had to go through so much\nhumiliation, and suffering, and taking away the dignity from being a human being, if\nwe want it, or we don\u2019t want it, something is missing in us, and -- and I mean not in\nmyself, but in any survivor. And this can never be fulfilled, even if you are successful\nin business, and family life, and everything, always will come to haunt you about your\npast, about your suffering. But in other hand, I accept it, the philosophy, if I want it, I\ndon\u2019t want it, I have to go on with my life, either way. If I think too much about my\npast, and those all good things what I lost, is the only way to bury myself alive, not to\nknow. But the -- so long I keep on continuing with my life, I have to be strong enough\nto take life and accept life as it comes.",
        "Q: Do you find that in the -- decades ago, in the early years, that you had to\ndeliberately block out those thoughts, and -- and look to your future in order to cope? I\nask that question because I know that you\u2019ve given interviews like this in latter years,\nbut not -- not earlier.",
        "A: The same thing, actually. As much that I remember those old horror stories, and\nthey can never be told, but not a human being, I -- but my past from the suffering, but I\nhave always thinking, not of a great deal about future success, but accept life how it\ncomes. And I think this holds me going the way how I do.",
        "Q: I wonder if when you and your wife were first together, would you tell her at great\nlength of -- of what had happened during those earlier years?",
        "A: Yeah, with my wife, I always discussed, and I always used to tell her. And she was\ntrying to protect me, like for example when it used to come the worst horror stories,\nand documentary on TV, she was trying, and not succeeded that I shouldn\u2019t watch it.\nBut for some reason, I tried never to miss nothing. And to be honest, when people --\nstrange people, or friends even, who were not -- had those horrible experience from\nbeing in a concentration camp, I watched them constantly, and -- and most of the time,\nI don\u2019t know why, this is actually, it\u2019s a sickness, I hardly was moved by it. I felt I\u2019m\nmore like a piece metal, a stone. But now in -- nothing ca -- can move me, actually to\nthose old, horrible memories from the past.",
        "Q: Do you think that\u2019s because that\u2019s how you coped then, by -- by -- by becoming\nnumb?",
        "A: I accepted that I cannot choose my life -- things what is coming to what is not\ncoming. I lost everything, the best and the dearest. I lost everything. And then I\nactually made up my mind, and realized that this is only a way not to complain, and\nnot to think too much about it, but you cannot forget, but to keep on going, as long as\npossible with my life I had, and take it as 1t comes.",
        "Q: Have you, in your -- your 50 years now in America, are there been -- are there\nparticular causes, and interests that you\u2019ve had? You\u2019ve told me how you supported\nthe Holocaust museum, that would be more recently, but are there other political or\nsocial things that are dear to your heart?",
        "A: No, I never was a political person, and I realize, you know, even if you want get\ninvolved, you cannot change. You have to accept how it comes, and I didn\u2019t have no\nproblem, actually, in accepting, and behaving myself, actually, to be a good citizen,\nand to obey all rules, whatever a citizen should obey. I -- I cannot give you much more\nabout this, than those things. I try to be the right way. See a lot of things -- 1n every\ncountry, and the United States is not an exception, it\u2019s good things, and bad things, but\nyou still have to obey, as a good citizen, the law of in the land.",
        "Q: When you came here, did you experience any discrimination?",
        "A: Sure, I felt discrimination. I remember in 1953, when we had been married -- or in\n\u00b052, and at this time went out to get an apartment. We lived in a furnished room, we\nlived in [indecipherable] an apartment, so finally we decided that we -- we going to get\nan apartment, buy our own furniture, establish our own. And the first experience was\nwe looked at an apartment, and we liked it over there, and when I made an\nappointment with the lady, the owner, and I came in, and she asked me questions, so\nshe realized that I am Jewish, and I\u2019m not an American, cause I couldn\u2019t speak good\nEnglish yet, and actually she refused to rent it me. But this didn\u2019t discourage me, and I\nwas not mad. I felt this 1s her apartment, she -- and she has hundred percent, full right,\nto choose to whom she rented, yes or no, I never -- I -- I didn\u2019t feel I was discriminated\nbecause she didn\u2019t want to rent me the apartment.",
        "Q: But of course, that\u2019s one thing that would have changed today.",
        "A: I da -- I don\u2019t think it will change. You cannot force nobody to love you, to like\nyou, or to do whatever. Some people have their own way, and I feel they have their\nright to do their own judgment, and even without in-interference from a government or\nforce you to rent to the person even if you don\u2019t like it. I feel this what a free country\nshould be. If you are the owner of it, you have any right to choose who want to rent\nyour apartment, and not be told by the law -- you know, but the government, he has to\n-- you have to rent them. If he doesn\u2019t want it, there\u2019s plenty other apartments.",
        "Q: Were there a lot of other instances of -- that were of that kind?",
        "A: No more or less -- I never had any. In fact, I used to socialize with Gentile people\nin America, and they didn\u2019t have to go through a Holocaust, and most of the time I\nbehaved with good manners, and this how -- I behaved how I was raised to behave to\nbe among people. And I got always the biggest respect. The other people who hardly\nknow me, and they always respect me, and they wanted to socialize with me.",
        "Q: Now, wha -- I wonder if your wife ran into any dis -- problems of discrimination?\nWas there anti German sentiment in those years after the war, or would that have been\nnegligible?",
        "A: Yeah, it was anti sentiment, and -- during the war, and you cannot blame them, I\nthink it\u2019s a good things, actually. Because whatever the world did anything, had\nfeelings about German brutality, that it was more than justified. And I actually\ncouldn\u2019t see that Germany, whatever they did it, I don\u2019t say everybody, but wa -- the\nmajority -- and they didn\u2019t know it, and they claim they didn\u2019t know it, but they did\nknow it and everything, should deserve to have it [indecipherable] the nicest life.\n[indecipherable] Europe actually, was in Germany. But normally things like this, it\nwill happen if you want it, or you don\u2019t want it, but if you don\u2019t make an issue of it, it\njust goes away. It comes, and it goes away in no time.",
        "Q: Do you think that this society had improved in it\u2019s sort of acceptance of different\nfaiths?\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B\n[Side B blank]\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Morris Kornberg. This is tape number four, side A. My question was, do you\nthink there is less anti-Semitism in 1999?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know exactly, you know, how to answer this question, but my mind is if\nsomebody want to be anti-Semitic, then I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think actually, if you have\nrules, regulations from the government, you -- you -- about discrimination, but if you -\n- somebody doesn\u2019t want to get friendly with you, it\u2019s no use -- if you try to force it, it\njust backfires on you. And then you really -- you can increase anti-Semitism. I was\nalways in my vi -- my thinking, 1f somebody doesn\u2019t like me, I going to have nothing\nagainst this person, he doesn\u2019t have to like me, and I will find somebody else who will\nlike me.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s not something you can --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- im-1m-impose.",
        "A: No, not -- not -- nothing, I mean, I don\u2019t like to be imposed, or to -- 1f somebody to\nyou 1s imposing, you know, to like you, or whatever -- I don\u2019t go for it, no. I think if it\ndoesn\u2019t come freely from you inside, it will never get the person the knowledge I -- to\n-- to change. They only change if you show your respect, that somebody doesn\u2019t want\nyou, just leave him go, that\u2019s all. Not particular fighting.",
        "Q: Earlier in the interview, when you were talking about those years of the Holocaust,\nyou mentioned getting news through the BBC, and I --",
        "A: This was in Poland [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Well, this was still in Poland, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: My question was -- I -- I wanted to ask you more about that. Did you continue ever,\nto get BBC news in those years when you were in the camps? I assume there would be\nno way then.",
        "A: No, no, it was impossible. No, this was impossible, and in fact, even I worked in\nthe coal mine, we have been with Poles, Gentiles, together always, but it was not\nallowed, apparently, and never had a chance even to hear news, or even to look in a\npiece -- a newspaper piece, or even what it was months or years old. No, we never\nknowed much. We know it only -- in the camp we used to have feelings, if they treated\nus bad, beatings, or really torturing, well, we felt this a good things, that they have\nlosses on the front. This -- this was our policy, you know, to know what is going on.\nWhen they have been nice to us, we felt they have too many successes on the front.\nWe like rather to suffer, and to be humiliated by the guards, and beaten by the guards,\nkicked by the guards; then we had hope that maybe a change can be soon. But we\nnever expect to be free people, or be in -- humans any more, anyway, but this gave us\nsome hope that eventually, sometimes, that maybe will be a survivor. You never figure\nthat I will be the survivor.",
        "Q: Was there any basis, though, for your accepting that when you were suffering,\nthings must be going badly?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I mean, this was the truth, actually. Yeah we -- you -- you get used, and\nyou realize, you know, when they treat you bad, that they have losses on the front. The\nfront didn\u2019t go bad, and we never made any mistakes, and this was true. Sooner or\nlater some of the conversation with guards, actually, what has not been too nasty, and\nthen we realized they had big losses, and we realized why th-they treated the inmates\nso bad. [indecipherable] discuss the policy, this was the newspaper, how we have been\ntreated.",
        "Q: Yeah. Then 1-in 1945, would you be getting news then of what was happening, and\nthat liberation may be close?",
        "A: In 1945, [indecipherable] liberated, 1f anybody who could walk, or move around,\nwhatever, the only thing what we as -- as survivors in camps, we only thought about,\nyou know, how to get food. And another that you -- you are able, if you feel hungry,\nthat you can slice a slice of bread, and eat as much as you wanted. Otherwise the\nwhole world didn\u2019t exist yet, and our -- we still have been numb like you mentioned it,\nnumbness. We have been numb, we didn\u2019t come to realization that we survived, and\nwe are humans, and we had to go on as a human being. No, we never had anything\nelse to think, only about hunger was about all.",
        "Q: And when you had no food, you\u2019d mentioned having fantasies about it, tell me\nwhat that was like.",
        "A: It -- it\u2019s not a pleasant things. We used to get a ration of bread, where we used to\ndiscuss with each other, what -- how is the best thing to digest the ration? To eat up,\nand make you feel that you satisfied your hunger, or take a bite now, and save it, and\ntake a bite later? This -- we always have discussion what is the best. But a lot of times\nwe realized if you don\u2019t eat it up, you never know somebody will steal from your\npocket, or when you go to bed you have been hiding, somebody steal away, so you\ndidn\u2019t -- never satisfied, y -- and you don\u2019t -- cannot expect to get a ra -- other things,\nactually, wherein normally, 99 percent -- I was among those 99 percent, when we got a\nration, we had a chance, we ate what we got, and we didn\u2019t had no worries to save it,\nto keep it in a safe place, or whatever.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And you\u2019d -- you\u2019d have fantasies, is that right, about -- you\u2019d be -- sort\nof dream of wonderful foods when you were close to starvation?",
        "A: Not about fancy food, never had any fantasies, we just had fantasies how to satisfy\nthe hunger. Not suffering.",
        "Q: Right. Now, I wonder to what extent you\u2019ve been left with a hatred of any waste in\nfood.",
        "A: Yes, still today. I cannot see waste of food whatsoever. I myself, where we live we\nhave extra acreage, and | have a -- a large garden, and I have the garden, thanks God,\nnot for income, whatever, I can afford buy seeds, or whatever labor it\u2019s involved. It\ncosts me money, and whenever I have to harvest, I just hated to see that anything goes\nto waste, at home, or in the garden, cause a lot of times, 1f nobody comes to pick up\nsome vegetables from the garden, I will go out of my way, and even travel hundred\nmiles around trip, to give some friends from the garden. This hurt me, to see food go to\nwaste hurt me very, very much, and this will never change.",
        "Q: And y-your land, perhaps, has that extra meaning for you, as a kind of security?",
        "A: Not only about security very much, the land means for me actually that since I\nretired -- I\u2019m already 10 years retired, that I don\u2019t sit on a chair, just keep on resting. I\nalways loved to work, and physical work even when it\u2019s hard for me to be more\nphysical, I still love it, and I do it, and I think this keeps me alive.",
        "Q: You know, there\u2019s a pattern too, of your surviving in prison, in slave labor camps,\nin Auschwitz, of you\u2019re always, perhaps being helped to survive by the fact that you\ncould work and work.",
        "A: Actually, some work even in the coal mine, their heaviest work. This is like being a\nhuman, actually. If you see you accomplish, even for your biggest enemy, it give you\nsatisfactory. If you could accomplish -- if you have been able to do it, where actually,\nif you work, the satisfactory is larger than the hard work.",
        "Q: And do you think that -- I wonder if you have health problems today because of the\n-- all that heavy labor, or has that -- or is that the reason that you\u2019re in such good\nhealth?",
        "A: This is a very hard to answer, but one thing actually. When I was liberated in\nTheresienstadt, this was probably the end of April, or beginning of May, in *45, and I\nwas so sick and ill actually, what I never expect to be alive, and I never saw a doctor,\nwhatever, to check me if I\u2019m healthy or I\u2019m sick, until I came to Prague,\nCzechoslovakia where they accepted me in a sanitortum. This was the first time a\ndoctor examined me and check whatever they -- the sanitorium over there, the\nmanagement, they strictly took in only DP\u2019s, Displaced Persons who had been in a\nconcentration camp. And they treated us -- royalty is maybe the proper word to say.\nAnd the first medical doctor, he examined me, and he examined me, he told me that I\nhave an enlarged heart. Even without knowing any medical terms, or whatever, I don\u2019t\nknow, I just happened to be that I asked this doctor, \u201cWill this stay with me forever?\u201d\nAnd he said in medical terms, it\u2019s hard to tell. Sometime, if you live a normal life, it\ngoes back to normality, it will disappear, and a lot of times it\u2019s will stay with you your\nwhole life. So far, thanks God, I felt if I worked physical, it helps me to stay alive,\nmore or less. So I continually -- my doctor told me that fairly I\u2019m in good shape, and\nwhatever you do, he told me not to change the formula, keep on doing the same thing.\nAnd well, I\u2019m doing it.",
        "Q: How would you get news today of world affairs and so on? Do you follow\nparticularly carefully, or are you not interested in papers, TV news, radio news?",
        "A: I\u2019m interested, and I follow it, but I know not me even, because popular people,\nwhat know the politics and everything, it\u2019s politics, to be honest, personally, I think\nit\u2019s a dirty trade. Nobody\u2019s honest. Very rarely you can find somebody who tells you\nthe truth, whatever. This how I feel. And in the other hand, as a little, ordinary person,\nyou cannot change those things, either, so you just let them go.",
        "Q: I -- I wondered, you know, wh-what -- what your attitude was, because you can\nargue the opposite viewpoint, and say that what happened in the 1930\u2019s was because --\nI think you can argue this -- was because the people who should have been involved in\npolitics were standing by and allowing the, you know, things to change, and --",
        "A: We showed you actually, that the -- not people, but countries, and I hate to criticize\nthe United States, United States did a great deal for me, whatever, and -- and I -- I feel\nthat I try my best to be a good citizen, actually, but on the other hand, you read about\nthe past, and you call it a world of civilization. In the whole world -- I don\u2019t want to\nmention name, but this is including the United States, where I\u2019m a citizen, and I try to\nbe a honest, good citizen, that the whole world could stand by and see those horror,\nbrutalities -- I don\u2019t have the proper word to mention about it, and I don\u2019t think the\ndictionary has even the proper words. And I don\u2019t think you can express the proper\nwords to -- to express about those past, and doing nothing, this actually, you lose the\nbelief in any civilization. There\u2019s a part of me, it\u2019s hard for me to believe that a\ncivilized world exists.",
        "Q: Do you find it -- do you find it hard in relationships with people to trust them? Do\nyou think you\u2019re -- you\u2019re different? I\u2019ve known no suffering, and that trust -- trusting\nother human beings might be easier for me, or whether, in fact, you\u2019re just the same?",
        "A: To me, actually, you know, trusting or not trusting, it\u2019s har -- very hard to trust\npeople in general, but you feel more trusted when you come along to a Holocaust\nsurvivors, what they had the same experience as me, and then I realize they\nunderstand. But a average person, if you\u2019re Jewish or Gentile, 1t doesn\u2019t make any\ndifferent to me. But I realize right now, after 50 years, being more or less a normal\nperson, that it\u2019s hard to believe that it was so much suffering for those people who\nhave been in concentration camps. And -- and even somebody would say, you know, it\nnever existed, it\u2019s just a hoax. A lot of times I -- I feel I\u2019m not mad about it, but I feel\nas a normal person, with normal thinking, you have to believe it\u2019s a hoax, it\u2019s not true.",
        "Q: Because it\u2019s unbelievable?",
        "A: Th -- th -- exactly.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s unbelievable, I mean, this is the proper word. A lot of times I will in po -- in ger\n-- in English, and hard to express me the proper words, but like you said, it\u2019s\nunbelievable, in the same way, with as much as you talk, or videos you interview, but\nthe true story will never come out. And I hope that we never come to a point where the\ntrue stories of new sufferings comes.",
        "Q: Because it goes on and on. You know, I wonder if you\u2019d talk a little about the\nlength of time that you were imprisoned, or in a camp. The term survivors used for\npeople who were briefly in hiding, it\u2019s a term that covers many different cases, and I\nthink you\u2019re unusual in the period of time that you were held, or -- or suffered. Would\nyou talk a little bit about that?",
        "A: I can talk as much as possible for me. I mean, those things you don\u2019t forget\nactually. I was actually, when I came to Auschwitz at this time, being Jewish was 100\npercent impossible to s -- to live a day or two. Gentiles who come to Auschwitz in \u201941,\na maximum, I would say, you know, you could live a day or two, and because the\nhorrors were so great, was impossible. But in my case, actually, in fact this is actually\nwhy I survived; I was in Auschwitz only -- direct in Auschwitz, I was only one day.\nThe second day the Germans needed real bad -- around Auschwitz 1s a lot of coal\nmines, and they needed real bad people to go to the mines, but they didn\u2019t trust Poles,\nwho came to -- to Auschwitz actually, because you have to work with Poles, civilian\nPoles in the mine, they smuggle you out, or whatever, so they never took Poles to the\nmine. The only who they took to the mines was Jewish, or Germans -- not Jew --\nGermans we -- we were -- who have been the same way, have been prisoners in the\ncamps. And the second day, actually, the same eight people who wa -- we have been\nstepped out being Jewish, we have been called again to be on the appelleplatz. And we\ncame back, and a doctor came in Auschwitz, and we have been in Auschwitz, a doctor\ncame and told us to take off our clothing, and everything, and examined us, our health,\nour -- and then he said, \u201cYou going to be sent to Yavishavitz,\u201d and Yavishavitz was a\ncoal mine camp. And this was a brand new camp, and at this time when we went to\nYavishavitz, we couldn\u2019t believe it that we are in Auschwitz. Even Yavishavitz was a\nsubcamp of Auschwitz. But it was no kapos, we have not been mistreated too bad. And\nthe director from the coal mine came, and he spoke to us, and he says he\u2019s only\ninterested in one thing, this 1s to be good workers in the mine. And he promised us if\nwe will behave, we will do good work in the mine, he will look into it that we are not\nmistreated, and we will be getting proper food. We\u2019ll be able -- I was night shift, and\nhe said, we -- you'll be able to sleep during the day. And in the beginning, was\nactually true everything, it was not so terrible, I mean, you could survive. The only\nthing was the hard work in the mine, but I used to talk to the one that was in charge in\nthe mine, he was a Pole, and I used to ask him how long can you live in the mine? He\nsaid, \u201cOh, people work here 20 and 25 years.\u201d And he told me you can survive you\nworking in the mines. And he showed me how to hold the shovel proper, what is\nactually -- make it much easier to work on it. And it was good until actually, til \u00b042,\nwhen they start with Jewish transport. And then when they start with Jewish transport,\nthey had so many people -- Jewish people, actually, and the most highly intelligent\npeople fen Germany, French, Poland, Belgium, Italy. They come, they\u2019ve been\nprofessional doctors, professors, very high tech people, and they send them in the\nmine, they last a day or two, this was all. And they looked only a way how to dispose\npeople. They didn\u2019t look any more for workers, because they had too many of them. In\nthe camp when I came to Yavishavitz was maybe 300 people. When the Jewish\ntransport come, the -- in the same camp, in the same barracks, they had 3000. And\nactually every week, used to come a truck in the crematoriums in Auschwitz, and\npicked up those who broke down. It didn\u2019t took too long, actually for people, highly\nintelligent people to break down. I don\u2019t know even it took a week, took days. They all\ngot to the point of not being able any more to work, and -- and the rule of the camp,\nespecially in Auschwitz was, if you are not able to work, you don\u2019t have a right to live,\nand so you -- they automatically -- you know it, if you cannot work, you go to the\ncrematoriums.",
        "Q: You know, I read that -- and this I think was in some museum materials, that those\nwho had been in the ghettos, and had experienced longer periods of hardship, seemed\nto --",
        "A: Survive longer.",
        "Q: -- survive longer. I mean, wha -- wha -- you found that to be true?",
        "A: Exactly. It\u2019s exactly this, the full truth. Number one, you know, I was in the 20\u2019s,\nand I was fairly healthy, and even at home, you know, I\u2019m raised in a home, even we\nhad the -- and enough money and everything, you know, being this 20 year old boy, to\nenjoy life, maybe I been raised really restricted, that the same way is nothing, just run\naround, you have to do to get the feeling and understanding if you are a human being,\nalive, you have to perform something. It doesn\u2019t mean anything but physical work. If\nyou read books, was okay with my parents, but doing nothing was not all right. So I\nwas used, actually, to let -- not coal mine labor, but I still was used to keep myself\nbusy --",
        "Q: Pulling your weight.",
        "A: -- and to do work. And later, when actually I came to Yavishavitz and worked in\nthe coal mine, and somebody explained me how to manage to have it easier, this\nhelped me a great deal, and this actually -- this made me survive. Later on actually,\nyou know, when Jewish transport came, everything finished, but they used to get the\nrations for 300 people, it\u2019s 3000. It was just too bad, you know, those rations have\nbeen distributed among 3000 people. And it started getting rougher and rougher and\nrougher. They didn\u2019t even looked any more for labors, for good labors, they just\nlooked how to dispose those people who -- without a bullet, without the crematorium.\nThis how it went on all the time.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Wasn\u2019t Auschwitz itself quite new when you were there?",
        "A: Yeah, exactly. Brand new, practically. The ausch -- when I came in \u201941, was only\nexisted -- I don\u2019t think a year old even, less than a year old, practically, yeah.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about that, when you see the -- the map of Auschwitz, and\nthe -- the many, many subcamps? This sort of mankind making this giant killing\nmachine, you -- 1 -- 1 -- 1 -- course, you said it before, it\u2019s unbelievable, but --",
        "A: I be honest, I mean from the beginning we didn\u2019t know it, actually, what had\nhappened. Later we heard stories a little bit from here, and from there, and then we\nrealized what 1s going on. And automatically we know it, you know, like our parents\ndidn\u2019t had a chance, you know. We know it, they have been destroyed in the\ncrematorium before we even -- if you have been young age, you know, between 18\nand 30, you had a chance maybe, they put you in for working, that you will work. But\nthings actually, to thinking about the Germans, they have been so organized,\neverything. People who read the past about concentration camps, they think it\u2019s just\ncame by accident. It didn\u2019t come by accident. I realized now even, you know, before\nwhen I was there, I didn\u2019t think about it, but now I can recall, and I realize that\neverything was so planned. As soon as you come to Auschwitz, they took away your\nidentity, you didn\u2019t had a name any more. You been like a dog, you got a tag, a\nnumber, and you wear uniform, and they don\u2019t call you anything no more, and they --\nthey call you -- they call you by the number. I remember even myself, when I got the\nnumber --",
        "Q: That\u2019s the number on your arm?",
        "A: Yeah -- no, I didn\u2019t -- was not tattooed when I came to Auschwitz, I was a political\nprisoner, so my clothing went in a bag like any other person. I was photographed I\ndon\u2019t know how many times, several time, you know, turn your head and bumps here\nand there. And -- and another thing, whoever was documented -- they called us, you\nknow, like we come from a prison, and we came, they have document, you know, like\nthe transport had a list. You know, some kept the list, and some throw it away the list,\nbecause know it -- they know it --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Morris Kornberg. This is tape number four, side B. You were documented?",
        "A: Yeah, and being a document, I don\u2019t know why -- why they have been afraid, those\nSS or Gestapo. Normally, as a rule in every camp like a -- I mean, I can tell only where\nI was in Yavishavitz, that had they called it a ravia, it was like first aid. You know, I\nmean, sickness didn\u2019t exist, I never heard in a camp that somebody got sick. Not\n[indecipherable] you never heard of it. Oh, you dropped dead, so -- a -- a normal thing,\nactually, that\u2019s all. But sick, this didn\u2019t exist. I never was sick. Neither other thou --\nother thousands that is, but if you went in for some help, in this ravia, there are\ndoctors, you know, they all have been prisoners, also haftlinger, and okay, they kept\nyou til one night. If yo -- the other day, you have not been able to go out -- go to y -- to\nthe coal mine, or other commanders what they have working commanders, if you have\nnot been able to go, th-then, 1t was no more time left, so the next day come a truck\nfrom the crematorium and picked you up, and -- and this was the end, or so you -- this\nmore or less, everybody was afraid to go in the [indecipherable] been sick.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s why one person might help someone else to -- to get back from the mine\nand hand in their lamp. Anything to keep going.",

I remember one time, he\nwas from -- from Bendine, Paul Oberslazin, more or less, a Jewish middle aged, he\nwas much older than me. He must have been in the late 40\u2019s. And every second week,\nI think, there used to come from Auschwitz a doctor -- and you have been told to take\noff your clothes, and -- and he examined you, he looked at your body, how your -- how\nyour are with your health or whatever. Not examined, but he just looked at the body.\nAnd normally what they looked is on the --",

At this time, because I was over there, one from\nthe oldest prisoners, inmates, and you know, you\u2019re always have been already prefare -\n- pre -- you know, prepared, actually -- more privileged than a regular person, you\nknow, they know it. I was over there in \u00b041, you know, so everybody looked me. And\none time I had a chance o -- the one who took the -- put down the numbers, the same\nway, you have been forced to put down the number on the list, whatever they have to\nknow it. I know him, I was with him together.

He\nsmuggled himself in -- they counted always, they saw it, they know how many people\nthey have to send to the mine, how many. If it was too many, they -- they didn\u2019t let out\nnobody, they waited until they got straight. I don\u2019t know how he did it, but he did it, he\nsmuggled himself, and he went in the coal mine. You know what those beasts did?\nWhen the wagon came, he picked up those all from the list, and they saw he was\nmissing, and apparently wherever they realize, you know, they had a plus, and they\nknowed exactly in which mine he is, whatever. They took the wagon -- the truck, and\nthey went in the mine, they brought him up to the -- in the mine, and took him to the\ncrematorium. This how a -- and you know what else, how accurate they have been,\nhow planned everything was? This 1s unbelievable. As little they fed us, but -- but it\nbelonged, you know, for every prisoner, a ration of bread, if you got a hundred grams,\n200 grams, whatever, this -- they have been responsible, this belongs to you. They\nhave those people on the truck, and they gave everyone a ration, what it belonged. He\nstill was alive, and so he was entitled to the ration. They gave him the ration. This\nhow, you know, [indecipherable] comes to me how well everything was organized.\nAnd whatever it came, it didn\u2019t come just happening, you know? Everything was\nplanned.",
        "Q: It\u2019s really the sort of -- I think this is much written about, but the -- the nature of\nevil, it\u2019s like --",
        "A: It\u2019s a little bit more than evil.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s a little bit more. And they -- the first step in the Nazis was actually when you\ncame to a camp, they dehumanize you. They took away whatever you could.

And then they con -- control you, they don\u2019t have to afraid that somebody will\nrun away, or somebody will stand up, you know, and say I\u2019m getting killed anyway, I\nkill a -- a -- a guard, or whatever. It didn\u2019t make any different. They know that the next\nhour he will get killed, so what\u2019s the different? But they took everything away what a\nhuman being have inside in him.

        "Q: Yeah, so that you\u2019re broken, really.",
        "A: Exactly, broken is the proper word. Yeah, they broke down you completely.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Physical because you have to work hard, and they don\u2019t give you enough food. This\nthey broke right away, this was easy. Mentally was a little bit harder, but if they keep\non breaking little bit and little bit, then mentally you lose everything, too.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You know, I wonder other everyday things that give you sort of traumas.\nI\u2019m thinking of coffee, and the fact that that would be the only way you could wash at\nsa -- at -- at some stage.

Even if I can\u2019t afford, I just -- I feel suffering a little bit\nrelease in -- in myself, you know, that I\u2019m survived. Even if I go to a doctor, you\nknow, doctors trying to give you -- I never want to take medicine, everything, and\nwhenever it comes to anesthetic, I tell the doctor, don\u2019t worry, pains I can take, you\ndon\u2019t have to worry. They have me all on record, Morris refused to take medication, or\nsomething to relieve pains. Yeah, they have me on the record [indecipherable] and this\nhow actually I -- I feel actually, if I suffer, it feels me a little bit release from the\npressure what I lost.

        "A: It\u2019s no -- no way -- I can speak for myself what I think this is for anybody who\nsurvived. It\u2019s no way in the world that you can bury it. If you want it, or you don\u2019t\nwant it, it will surface. If it doesn\u2019t surface hundred percent, it surface 50 percent, 60\npercent. But just to ignore it, no way.",

And we, all kids, all of our\nbrothers and sister, we had sense enough respect our family, and try to give back our\nlove the same what their love was to us. This 1s a way -- you cannot forget those\nthings. And this what [indecipherable] you know, what makes life so miserable, why I\ndon\u2019t want to enjoy life, even I can afford.

        "A: Yeah.

        "A: Yeah, this is mostly, actually, people. People who didn\u2019t had [indecipherable]\nnothing, you know, had been poor and everything. And they looked out, and they\nsucceeded. It was a chance, this was the only chance after the war to succeed. If you\nmissed, you missed the boat.",
        "Q: Yeah. You know, you spoke earlier in -- in -- in telling a story, y -- but you\nmentioned the can that you carried, that I think all -- all of you would have on you, so\nthat if there were any food --",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: -- you could get it. And I just felt that was especially meaningful to me, and I\nwonder if you\u2019d -- d -- do you remember the years that you had that, and what it\nlooked like, and -- and when you no longer carried it with you?",
        "A: What, the can?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, this was in the camp all the time. I mean, in Auschwitz, we was more\norganized actually. You know, they looked at you that you are -- kept yourself clean.\nThey killed you if you didn\u2019t kept yourself clean. But later, in the later camps,\nactually, in Buchenwald, where you have been in [indecipherable] was so filthy and\ndirty, I never had a -- another shirt when I left Auschwitz til actually I was liberated,\nyou know. And I mentioned actually in the tape to -- we didn\u2019t have no water, you\ncouldn\u2019t wash yourself actually. The same way it was just organized to make your life\nso miserable actually, that you will give up life, and this what did happen, this was\ntrue.",
        "Q: Did you ever, after the Holocaust, have any counseling? I think most -- a-any sort\nof psychotherapy, or anything?",
        "A: No.",

        "A: I tried to go back.",
        "Q: Yes, you tried to go back.",
        "A: It was 30 kilometers from my hometown, and I came by train over there, and I\nfigured, because I had brothers -- I was the youngest, but I still had brothers that had\nbeen pretty young, and my oldest sister had three kids already. The oldest girl was at\nthis time -- before \u201939, she was probably 11 years old. In \u201945 she was 17. And I figured\nmaybe because we had been respected by Gentile people, too, you know, maybe\nthey\u2019re -- somebody hid them, or wherever. I had hope that I find somebody. I --\nparents we didn\u2019t dream, we know what had happened, so we -- we gave up\nautomatically, but -- but the brothers and sisters, we always had any hope. And as soon\nI was able to walk in Theresienstadt, I took a train, and traveled to the home, to the\nnearest hometown -- like I mentioned, we didn\u2019t have the railroad station. The closest\nrailroad station was Rodonsko. And I got off in Rodonsk, and I ask those people, any\nJew survivors? They -- they didn\u2019t s -- know it exactly, whoever I ask, I don\u2019t\nremember, even. So they told me the only way is you have to go out on the road and\nsee where -- if the road leads n -- to Chadbush, be there, and just ask to take you along.\nIt was no -- at this time was not too many cars, a car was a novelty, very hardly saw it.\nWe saw buses, maybe, to take passengers, but the most -- the other way was by horse\nand buggy. And I went on the road, and stood over there, and suddenly see somebody\nwith the horse and buggy comes, and I looked, and his face looked familiar to me. So\nfinally, what closer he got, the more I could see who it was, and I called him by his\nname. Bentkofsky was his name. I said, \u201cBentkofsky.\u201d And he looked, and looked, and\nhe stopped the horse [indecipherable] and looked at me. And he says, in Polish, \u201cT1\nZheerz?\u201d It means, you are alive? You know? And I realize how he greet me. And\nthen, you know, then he ask me if I know that those eight people who survived not the\ncamp, who survived, they have been hidden somewhere, whatever, that they all have\nbeen killed. They lived all Jewish home, and they all have been killed. I didn\u2019t know\nnothing, this was the first time. He told me about it.",
        "Q: And he told you the names?",
        "A: He told me the name, and I knowed every one of them, whoever they told me. And\nI got really hysterical. I start to cry, and -- and I told him in Polish, I spoke in Polish.\nAnd I said, \u201cYou know why I went through Auschwitz. I didn\u2019t go as a Jew.\u201d He know\nit probably, because he wa -- he worked 1n the factory, you know, like I told you, he\nused to carry finished merchandise to be shipped. He took it to the railroad\n[indecipherable] he was -- he knows me, and the family. He knows everything about it.\nI said, \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t go to Auschwitz as a Jew.\u201d",
        "Q: But as a Pole.",
        "A: As a Pole, yeah, political reasons. Probably he know it about the factory with the\ndouble bookkeeping, cause that was in. And I was so moved, I couldn\u2019t take it any\nmore. I think I spit on him. I didn\u2019t know what to do, what not to do, but I think it this\nwas I did. And then came out a woman, was near a building also, and she came out\nand I -- she must have been -- told me that she was Jewish -- she is Jewish too. And\nshe ask me what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s happened. She saw me, I was crying. I told her the\nstory. She said, \u201cPlease, one thing. You cannot go back to Chadbush. Go to Lodz,\nWarsaw, larger town. Over there goes some Jewish people, you meet survivors, not\nsurvivors. Go over there more or less you safe. But the Chadbush,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\ndon\u2019t go to Chadbush, no way in the world.\u201d And she told me about the same thing.",
        "Q: Yeah. Why? Because she feared if this could happen once --",
        "A: Because [indecipherable] for my life.",
        "Q: Yeah, in -- that\u2019s what I meant, if this horror could happen once --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- it could be repeated.",
        "A: Exactly. And she figured, you know, I thought actually I come over there, and\nmaybe I stay in Poland. I didn\u2019t had nobody in any country, relatives or not, where\nshould I go? I was born over there, we had houses over there.",
        "Q: Had hopes that your brothers were alive kept you going?",
        "A: Yes, I did. I did.",
        "Q: So which -- so you know, on -- at that moment, it was as if y -- this was like a final\nblow, I assume.",
        "A: Sure, it was the final blow, and the woman took me into her house, and she told me\nI should stay overnight over there, and say the next day, go wherever you wanted, but\nyou have to go to a large city. A small town is not safe for you to go. She begged me, I\nremember, I don\u2019t know if she gave me food. Well, a poor woman, too, actually, I\nremember. But I slept over there, and the minute I saw daylight, I just walked off, out\nthe door, I didn\u2019t thank for nothing, I didn\u2019t say goodbye, or not goodbye. I just\nwalked out. And I went straight to the railroad station, and I didn\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t\nknow where to go or what to do. But finally I said I'd try to go back maybe, to\nTheresienstadt, or whatever, see other friends, and where they go, I will go. I -- I\ndidn\u2019t know what to do. And I took the train, I went back to Czechoslovakia, and came\nto Prague, actually.",
        "Q: Why Prague? Was -- or was this really just 1t could have been anywhere?",
        "A: Anywhere, yeah, exactly, I mean Prague meant the same like I don\u2019t know, like\nBrazil, or you name it. I didn\u2019t know it. I was -- never was in Prague, and I never\ntraveled too much in Poland, and so I didn\u2019t know it -- the different between one\ncountry and the other country.",
        "Q: Except that you mentioned having a dislike of the thought of going to Russia, or --\nor -- or being in the care of Russians --",
        "A: Well this -- this I left. I -- I was raised -- we have not been -- our -- our whole\nfamily, actually, because being business people, we never have any sentiment or\nlikeness for Russians.",
        "Q: What was that based on?",
        "A: That Communism was as bad as Nazism, that\u2019s all. Over there you are told what to\nwear, what to eat, and what this. You know, the Nazis, you know, it was another --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- it was no different between each other, they\u2019re just a different color 1s about all\n[indecipherable]. This was actually bef -- when I came back to -- to Prague, and I\ndidn\u2019t know nobody in Prague. It happened to be on the railroad station the same way,\nby accident, I see a familiar face. He was with me -- he c -- he was from Belgium,\nfrom Antwerp. And he came from the first transport, came actually from Belgium,\nHolland. And he came in \u201942, maybe spring \u201942, or this I don\u2019t know either, exactly,\nbut he was from the earliest Jewish transport, he came with the Jewish transport. And\nwe used to be in the same barrack. And I remember, and I said -- I said, \u201cJulius?\u201d And\nhe says, \u201cYeah, Kornberg.\u201d Well, we recognize each other, and so we talked about tt.\nHe was in Buchenwald, too, but during the march, when they took us away from over\nthere, he had a chance, one from the guard told a reichsdeutsch, a German, you know,\nthat he should go, organize, take away a couple horses, and -- and over there, you\nknow, they needed horses. So he took him along, so they just took off, they\ndisappeared. So he saved himself a lot of things in his life probably, because 80, no\nmore, 90 percent, or even 95 percent didn\u2019t made it, you know, after those marches\nand this -- everything. [indecipherable] ask me where you going. I told him\n[indecipherable] I says, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cWhat you going to do?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And\nhe ask me, \u201cDid you go back home?\u201d I told him I tried it, and they tell me I shouldn\u2019t\ngo in this town. Well, he looked -- and he was a very nice guy -- and he\u2019s still, you\nknow, because we meet together, the Red Cross gets us together. Julius Bear is his\nname. He\u2019s originally from Hamburg, but when the Germans kicked out those\n[indecipherable] 1n Germany, they send him to a border, you know, and so he ended\nup, his parents and him, they went to Antwerp in -- in Belgium. And so he said that\nthey go back to Belgium, to Antwerp, and he had a whole group was Jewish boys, too.\nHe said, \u201cCome along.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy not? I don\u2019t know where else to go.\u201d I went in,\nbut you had to go in to the council first, to pass, you know. Well, he told me, you\nknow, where Antwerp lays, near Antwerp, where this town -- I don\u2019t recall even the\ntown, but he told me. He said the council probably will ask you a few questions. And\nif he ask you, you know what is next to Antwerp, and that city. Okay. So I waited over\nthere until I was called in, I called in to the council. He ask completely things, you\nknow, that I didn\u2019t know, weren\u2019t familiar so he right away -- he was very polite, he\nsmiled at me, and he kindly touched my back, he says, \u201cYou\u2019re not from Belgium.\u201d\nAnd he says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I cannot let you go. You\u2019re not from Belgium.\u201d I came back\nout, and I told him, \u201cThe council don\u2019t let me go through, he recognize that I am not\nfrom Belgium.\u201d Well, he told me that they stayed, they came a night before, and they\nstayed where in Prague, in a sanitorium. Mostly in the sanitorium, he said there\u2019s\npeople from concentration camps over there. And he said it\u2019s a very good place, they\ntake good care of you, and I should go over there to the sanitortum. You know, he\ngave me the address, how to go, whatever, I didn\u2019t know nothing. Well, he went to\nAntwerp, an-and I went over there to the sanitorium. Yeah, he warned me not to tell\nthat I am from Poland, they have skirmishes, the Czechs and Poles. He said, \u201cIf you\nsay you\u2019re from Poland, they will not take you in.\u201d Well, said all right, we didn\u2019t had\nno ID\u2019s anyway, nobody knows, you could tell anything. Well, I came over there, and\nthey ask me where I am, I told them I\u2019m from Germany. Which city? I told them\nHanover. I didn\u2019t know even where Hanover 1s, I didn\u2019t know it. Okay, so they\ndocument me over -- over there, I had no other identification that I am from in\nHanover. And the first thing is this was the first time I saw a doctor. It was a beautiful,\nclean place, good food and everything. They gave me a number on the second floor, a\nroom to stay over, everything unusually clean. But even for somebody from a\nconcentration camp, but in general, you know, was a nice place. A nice section, too, it\nwas almost outside Prague. In the morning, around 10 o\u2019clock, a doctor came, and\nexamined me. I was not used -- I never was examined before.",
        "Q: Except to see if you were capable of labor.",
        "A: Yeah, oh. And examined me, and I -- I think I mentioned already, and then he told\nme I have a enlarged heart, and he called the nurse, and he told her --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that I should not go up on the second floor, they should give me a room\ndownstairs, that I --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Morris Kornberg. This is tape number five, side A.",
        "A: I was over there, and they actually saved my life, because I was still in very bad\nshape when I came to the sanitorium. But they fed us so good, and the friendship from\nthe Czechs was so great. Used to come for entertainment in the evenings, didn\u2019t do\nnothing except ate, and sit around. They used to send them young girls in school, kids,\nbeautiful kids, beautiful girls, and they came in, they talked to us, and I -- I know how\nI looked, you know, shaved and everything, and terrible, shaved and everything. They\nused to tell how beautiful I am, I mean I know the truth, and I knowed why they do it,\nmake me feel good.",
        "Q: Human again.",
        "A: Yeah, they made -- tried to do, they tried to do anything, you know, to make you\ncomfortable, and they did. And til today I ca -- will never forget that they actually --\nthe Czechs in the sanitortum saved my life. So I stayed over there about four weeks.\nBut later, you see, go out in the streets, and you saw those Russian soldiers, and -- you\nknow, I -- like I mentioned, I was raised and I had none -- much sympathy for\nRussians. And I saw how they\u2019re dressed, you know, on one foot he had a shoe, on one\nfoot a boot. You know, terrible. And I start to dislike, you know, being over there in\nPrague. And one time I met a couple boys, they came from Germany, actually. They\ndid business, you know, they bought up clothing in Germany, they were -- sold it in\nCzech -- or vice-a versa, I don\u2019t know. They made money, that\u2019s all. And --",
        "Q: So there was an awful lot of that going on.",

        "Q: [indecipherable] keeping.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. And probably fulfilling a useful role.",
        "A: They have been smart enough to realize that they don\u2019t had nobody any more who\nwill look at them. They did the right thing. A la -- they know what they have to do on\ntheir own to make money, and they did made it. They ask me -- we met each other,\nand they ask me from where I am, which camp I was. And I told them everything\nabout it, and that I couldn\u2019t go back home to my hometown. And they said -- I told\nthem, I don\u2019t like -- that everything 1s good, clean, food, everything, but I feel of --\nfairly all right, but the only thing is I don\u2019t like to see Russians next to me\n[indecipherable]. Told me why don\u2019t you go to the American zone, the English zone.\nThey take care of you, they do this, it\u2019s much better, you ge -- if you want, we can try\nto do business, you know. Th -- you have more freedom. I listened to him, and in\nPrague were used to be office where the -- they did the deportation to where you came,\nyou know. They organized, and they had buses, you know. And certain days, even\nthey went this direction, this direction. And I came over there to this office, and I say I\nwant to go home. They ask me where, and sh -- I told them Hanover. \u201cOh,\u201d she said,\n\u201cHanover is bad. We very rare have a bus go to Hanover. A lot of times you could\nhave to wait for it two, three weeks.\u201d Then was a German in the office, I don\u2019t know\nwhat he did, and he says, \u201cOh, you know what? I drive tomorrow to Stuttgart.\u201d And he\nsays, \u201cIf you wanted, I can take you to Stuttgart, and Stuttgart you going to be closer to\nHanover than in Prague.\u201d He says he just meet me here and here.",
        "Q: What was that journey like? What was that journey like with the German?",
        "A: Didn\u2019t bothered me, you know, I felt that he\u2019s a very polite, decent person. He\noffered me a -- you know, a ride, he takes me along.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: He know that I don\u2019t have money, and I cannot pay.",
        "Q: I just wondered if there was close -- if you talked, and -- and whether --",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure.",
        "Q: -- whether he found out you weren\u2019t really from Hanover, or --",
        "A: Oh no, no, just my -- no, he didn\u2019t, and he just want to do a favor for me, and I\nfigured -- you know, I appreciated the favor. No, we didn\u2019t think about nothing else,\nexcept -- and true enough, he told me in the morning, meet me here and there, and he\ntook me with his car. Took a long time, you know, and I think in the evening even,\nthey still had curfew at this time, you was not allowed to travel for private, excepts,\nyou know, military. Finally, in the morning, when -- whatever, he arrived in Stuttgart,\nand -- and he said this is as far as he go. I -- he let me off. First thing the -- I don\u2019t\nknow who told me, this I don\u2019t remember even, that I should go over -- where he let\nme off was not far away was a school. The name of the school is Yakob Shula. Yakob\nSchool. And he said, \u201cGo over there, over there most people come home from\nconcentration camps, they stay over there until they know where to go, or what.\u201d So I\nwent in, this was -- must be a Friday I arrived in Stuttgart, yeah. And I went over there,\nwas a big room, a school, real huge. It was maybe 20 beds, or whatever. They gave\nyou a bed, you know, to sleep in, and they gave you always a slip, across the street was\na restaurant where they gave you a slip for breakfast, or dinner, supper, whatever. Oh,\nthis 1s all right, I mean, I didn\u2019t feel nothing wrong in -- you know, about this. I mean,\nit was great. I went over there overnight, and in the morning, I didn\u2019t know Stuttgart,\nbut I went down in the center of the Stuttgart, and looked around. And then I notice a\ncouple boys, and they looked at me, and I looked at them. You know, this was not hard\nto recognize. Finally we get closer a little bit, I went their way, and they came my way,\nand finally they ask me in Hebrew, Amahoud? Means if you are Jewish, you know. I\ntold them yeah, I am Jewish. And they said they\u2019re Jewish, too. They ask me the story\nwhere I was, I told them, you know, in Auschwitz I worked in a coal mine, and I just\ncome from Prague where I was in a sanitorium, and I -- somebody brought me to\nStuttgart. Well, they told me, oh -- he says -- yeah, this what they told me first, they\nask me where I stay. I told them the Yakob Shula. They say, \u201cOh, Jewish people don\u2019t\nstay in the Yakob Shula.\u201d This is maybe for Germans, other nationality, not Jewish\npeople.",
        "Q: This is where you should go, they told you.",
        "A: And I said, \u201cVery well, where do I go? I mean, I don\u2019t have nobody.\u201d Oh see, they\ntold me go to Dagaloff. Dagaloff is the outskirt of Stuttgart. This 1s 90 -- 90 percent\nvillas, and the most beautiful area ever see, you know, landscaping, beautiful. It\u2019s on\nhigher ground, Stuttgart is in. They call it castle in the lower part. And they said, \u201cYou\ngo over there, it\u2019s a sanitorium.\u201d And over there where Jewish people go, you know,\ncome from the concentration camp. And I come over there, actually, a beautiful villa,\nsanitorium, re -- the grounds, everything, gardens and all kinds. Was a sanitort1um\nbefore the owner -- it was his name, Katt sanitorium. He was a Nazi apparently.\nEisenhower, all the -- the biza -- the troops who were occupied to kick him out from\nthe sanitorium, and let all [indecipherable] camps -- in concentration camp live in the\nsanitorium. I -- I didn\u2019t had -- the eyes kept on looking, and looking, wherever, how\nbeautiful and everything. And same way, they had to -- the German government was\nforced to supply the best foods. The occupation -- the soldiers used to tell them they\ndon\u2019t care from where they get it, but they want for -- for those who camp in camps,\nthe best, nothing less than the best. And this what they had to do. Anyway, I came over\nthere, and then I met Fedderman, he was with me in -- in Buchenwald, in Traylitz. And\nwe have been together where I met him, and so we -- we shared the room together.",
        "Q: You mentioned when you were talking earlier, about your family member who\nwent back to Stadbush.",
        "A: Chadbush.",
        "Q: Chadbush, your hometown. This is much more recently, but I wonder if you\u2019d\nbriefly tell me, on tape, about that visit.",
        "A: Oh, this was my niece. She\u2019s a professor, a doctor professor, she teaches in\nRowland University in -- in Florida, Orlando, near Orlando. They live in -- in Winter\nPark, Florida. And she just made up -- then this was the plan. She\u2019s -- normally she\ngoes all over the world from the university, always with conferences, nofa. So she\ndecided, and her husband, she wants to go into the hometown where I was born, this is\na -- a daughter of my brother from Israel, she\u2019s a Israeli, too. And she ask me if I want\nto go along, I -- I told her I don\u2019t think I f-feeled for it, to do it. She said she still wants\nto see it. They went along in July. They visited the hometown, and she was very nice\ngreeted. She had a letter to the mayor of Chadbush from the mayor from Winter Park.\nSh-She had it translated, actually. And he really was a -- he looks a very pleasant\nperson, a nice person, the mayor from the town, from Chadbush. He is more or less a\nyounger generation, too. He\u2019s -- he\u2019s maybe in the 40\u2019s, something like this, and he\nwas very, very nice to her, and everything. And she -- she\u2019s very excited about it, and\nthey made a video. She send me a copy, the last night we watched it, actually. I was\nnot excited about it, you know. She ask me before if I want to go along, and I told her,\nI don\u2019t think so. When I saw the video, or even before I saw the video, and she told me\nover the phone, I realized it would tear me apart to step in, you know, where I lost\neverything, to step in those stones. I don\u2019t know, you know, a lot of times, I\u2019m not\nhuman, I\u2019m like a piece steel, or a stone, you know, I don\u2019t have no feelings for\nnothing. On the other hand, you know, if -- I\u2019m very easy to get emotional, too. I think\nit\u2019s a sickness, or it came in the suffer -- I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not normal, you know. I can\nget emotionally depressed.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I try my best, I know that I have to help myself. I don\u2019t believe in any doctor, or\nany consultation will help something like this. The only way how I know, is to help\nmyself, and just don\u2019t give in, just be strong enough to fight it, to make you forget,\neven if you don\u2019t -- cannot forget, and you will not forget, but talk yourself in that you\ndid forgot, you have to keep on going on living.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You know, I read -- I -- I think it was just yesterday I was reading\ndifferent Holocaust materials, and I read that some people, survivors, have asked,\nstrange though it may seem, to be buried at Birkenau. And I wonder if you\u2019 ve heard of\nthat, and whether -- 1 -- 1-1t\u2019s really -- you spoke earlier of your -- one of the hardest\nthings was coming to terms with having survived.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: But what is the -- what 1 -- what 1 -- have you thought about your own plans for\nwhere you\u2019d want to be buried, and -- my guess would be it\u2019s a --",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t know, everybody can has it\u2019s opinion.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: And what -- I will not agree or disagree. I think this is private matter, you know, to\ndo how you feel. But personally, I don\u2019t think, you know, it\u2019s a great idea, something\nlike this. It\u2019s too much Jewish blood in Birkenau, what it will never get over it,\nactually. Still boiling, you know, because so many people --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- innocent people, kids, men, women, who have been so brutally killed, murdered.",
        "Q: You know -- is there -- thank you.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome.",
        "Q: I just -- if there\u2019s anything else that, in this hours of taping that I\u2019ve left out that\u2019s\nimportant --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what, I -- I -- this I cannot tell you. This I don\u2019t know.",

        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Morris Kornberg, conducted by Margaret West, on\nSeptember the 27\", 1999, in Waldorf, Maryland. This is a follow up interview to a\n1990. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff\nand Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A.\nMr. Kornberg, I wonder if you\u2019d start by telling me your -- your name, your parent\u2019s\nnames, the details of your birth, and your siblings.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: So there were six of you altogether?",
        "Q: I\u2019m correcting that because much of the Holocaust material said seven.",
        "Q: And both your parents were -- were Jewish, and brought you up in -- practicing a\nsort of Orthodox Jewish faith.",
        "Q: I was interested in the fact that you were educated privately --",
        "Q: -- and I wonder if you\u2019d tell me more about -- more about that, and also the fact that\nafter the age of 14 or 15, you were given more freedom?",
        "Q: And was it usual to give young men much more freedom when they reached the age\nof 14 or 15?",
        "Q: I wonder if you\u2019d also tell me how you viewed your family\u2019s position. In the -- the\nvideotaped interview, your -- you cover your family history, but would you tell me\nwhether they should be regarded as urban or rural? As middle class, as a better off\nfamily?",
        "Q: And I assume that it\u2019s that family background that enabled you to -- to cope with\nlife.",
        "Q: Did you ever know why they were questioning you, and what information they\nwanted to get from you?",
        "Q: Let me go back and ask --",
        "Q: -- ask you to describe your mother\u2019s expression. Because that would be something\nthat\u2019s always stayed with you.",
        "Q: Also, have you thought about why they -- why they took you? Was it because you\nwere younger, and might speak more freely? Why they took you, and not your older\nbrother.",
        "Q: And your older brother, Haim?",
        "Q: I see, so you did know more.",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Morris Kornberg. This is tape number one, side B. I have a question about an\nearlier time, and that is that when the Germans invaded Poland, and you fled to the\nwoods for a few days --",
        "Q: What would be the reason why your home was spared, when much of the town was\nburned?",
        "Q: I should say on tape that we -- we -- I changed the subject abruptly, but I should let\nlisteners know that your detailed story of your arrest and beating by the SS officer, is\ntold on the March 1990 videotape --",
        "Q: -- at the Holocaust museum.",
        "Q: And I want to fill in some gaps from that earlier interview.",
        "Q: Yes. One of the questions was when you were living in the ghetto, was that in\nChadbush?",
        "Q: I want to fill in another -- another gap, or clarify something, and this is moving\nahead to when you were in -- I think it\u2019s pronounced Javishavitz.",
        "Q: Do you know why they were killed?",
        "Q: You said something that inter -- interested me earlier, which was that the Gestapo\nmay have felt you had knowledge of the underground.",
        "Q: Tell me more about that.",
        "Q: Was he a Gentile, or a Jew?",
        "Q: So, in fact, you wouldn\u2019t really know for sure who told the SS about -- about you?",
        "Q: It was the disgruntled employee?",
        "Q: Yes, but the -- the widow, in fact, sounds as if she always was very honorable in\nher dealings with you.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Yes, I wondered if that good relationship was unusual? I know that there was much\nanti-Semitism in Catholic Poland, but perhaps because they were somewhat part of the\nintelligentsia, she and her husband?",
        "Q: Well, what went wrong, do you suppose, in the plan that your brothers were\nworking toward? It seems you came so close to being freed?",
        "Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Morris Kornberg. This\nis tape number two, side A.",
        "Q: Too great a risk for the warden.",
        "Q: I had wanted to ask, after you were -- you had been moved to Auschwitz, would\nyour family have been able to trace where you were?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And your information about your family after that, were you able to find\nout anything?",
        "Q: So, despite much questioning, I -- I know that you\u2019ve checked whether any Jews\nhad survived in Chadbush, and there were --",
        "Q: -- there were none left.",
        "Q: So, of your family of six, only your brother in Israel --",
        "Q: -- 1s known to have survived?",
        "Q: Do you have any other -- any other information at all about members of your\nfamily?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. In the years since then, have you ever gone back to that area, or ever felt a\nwish to?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: When you were close to death before, and your two friends saved you --",
        "Q: -- your friends from Auschwitz. Was there anybody who could assist you at this\ntime in the hospital, and keep you going [indecipherable]",
        "Q: We\u2019ll get to that, but when you -- when you were close to death in Theresienstadt,\nthere were -- really, you just recovered on your own.",
        "Q: You became able to eat. There was no friend to help you, or to keep you going?",
        "Q: Or, as in your case, you slowly gain strength.",
        "Q: What kept you going, do you think? You must have thought a lot about this during\nall --",
        "Q: What did that feel like? You\u2019ve mentioned that before, that feeling, the realization\nthat you\u2019d survived, and that you\u2019d lost everyone else. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s guilt,\nor coming to terms with it?",
        "Q: Did you come to terms with that in any way, sort of feeling, well it -- I\u2019m -- \u2019m\nhere, and can tell the story, or --",
        "Q: Now, you spoke of Mr. Wolfe, who was the -- the boss, I think, of the company.",
        "Q: Is he still alive?",
        "Q: We -- we should perhaps move forward to that -- to that time when --",
        "Q: -- would be 50 years ago, almost -- almost to the day.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the United Nations relief agency.",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Morris Kornberg. This is tape number two, side B.",
        "Q: Oh, they were involuntary?",
        "Q: And I -- didn\u2019t know this went on, so --",
        "Q: They were in fact giving them a good life, and these were displaced persons, but\nwhy --",
        "Q: But why did they do it?",
        "Q: Did you at the same time long to be with him, since you\u2019d lost all your family?",
        "Q: But that was scary, too.",
        "Q: And what was his name?",
        "Q: He -- when di -- when did he marry in Europe?",
        "Q: Did he -- did he marry a survivor?",
        "Q: Now, in that time, immediately after liberation, and during the time people spent in\ndisplaced person\u2019s ca-camps, many marriages took place.",
        "Q: It was very natural. But you were unusual in -- perhaps because you were shy, in\nwaiting a while? Or you just had not met the right person?",
        "Q: Do you think, too, that you wanted to begin to rebuild your life before you settled\ndown, was that part of 1t?",
        "Q: It was just what happened.",
        "Q: And did he help you when you were here? Was he in this area?",
        "Q: And this -- in Baltimore you were in the care of the --",
        "Q: -- immigration and naturalization service.",
        "Q: Oh. Explain what that is.",
        "Q: How long did --",
        "Q: And how long did this period go on?",
        "Q: And where was that?",
        "Q: I was just wondering what part of the city, and --",
        "Q: A sort of tree lined streets, Washington neighborhood.",
        "Q: You were a nice looking young man in a very good suit.",
        "Q: Cutting metal?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: So you were in -- supervising a number of other people as time went by?",
        "Q: A fairly responsible job.",
        "Q: And 1s that where you s -- you spent your w -- your career, with that same\ncompany?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: It\u2019s quite a story, really. They were -- they were lucky to have you, and I\u2019m sure\nyou --",
        "Q: And with the group -- the area you were with, that was called American Mattress?",
        "Q: Oh, I see, American Wholesale Company.",
        "Q: And your -- your comfort in English just developed over time?",
        "Q: And you moved out of your -- your room in Bernard Fedderman\u2019s home in time?",
        "Q: You met at a -- at a -- at a bus stop. Is that right, in 19 --",
        "Q: -- w-would that have been in 1940 -- \u201946?",
        "Q: Actually, tell me -- tell me that -- your wife\u2019s full name, and more about her family\nbackground.",
        "Q: And were they a -- were they a Jewish family?",
        "Q: Oh. I had assumed they were. So this is interesting.",
        "Q: Tell me what they felt like, because you would be so desperately alone, I would\nthink.",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Morris Kornberg. This is tape number three, side A. Continue to tell me the story\nof your meeting your wife, and your marriage.",
        "Q: You -- that was -- she would in fact herself be -- being so brave to make that trip, to\nstart a new life.",
        "Q: Did she have brothers or sisters? Did she have brothers or sisters?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did either you, or your wife\u2019s family have any reservations because you\nwere -- she was Gentile, and you were Jewish?",
        "Q: 1951.",
        "Q: Oh, 52.",
        "Q: And you\u2019d corresponded during that time?",
        "Q: And did she speak any English when she came?",
        "Q: They are really good training.",
        "Q: Yeah, and by then, you we -- you were speaking English --",
        "Q: -- the language --",
        "Q: Tell me more about the things that you and your wife shared in common.",
        "Q: That\u2019s -- I didn\u2019t know that, and that\u2019s really quite wonderful that you --",
        "Q: -- that you -- that you could. Cause I can think of -- [indecipherable] I -- I really\nthink that is -- think the museum performs this wonderful role --",
        "Q: -- of making sure 1t won\u2019t happen again.",
        "Q: Yes. Now, both you and your wife, although you had different faiths that you\u2019ve\ngrown up in, probably --",
        "Q: Yeah -- no, I meant that your -- your childhood would have been spent in different\nfaiths, but you would -- you would ha -- after your marriage, you\u2019ve shared the same\nfaith, and also a -- probably both of you had known some degree of hardship. Even\nyour wife had experienced the war. So probably your values were similar.",
        "Q: Yeah. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m asking these questions, too, knowing that a great many of the\nsurvivors with experiences something like yours, perhaps for shorter periods, tended to\nmarry survivors. And that\u2019s really why I\u2019m probing with these questions.",
        "Q: Yeah. Now did you -- you don\u2019t have children, is that right?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I ask that only because I -- I understand some survivors have, because of\ntheir suffering, not wanted to have children, and you don\u2019t seem to be one of those\npeople who --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Tell me about reli -- what your religion means to you, and do you go to\nsynagogue regularly?",
        "Q: I interrupted. You were telling me about the children asking do you believe in God.",
        "Q: And you followed all the traditions? They\u2019re part of your -- of your marriage and\nyour life?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What about friendships in your life? You spoke of different ones during\nthe years when you were in camps. Have th -- have your friendships been enormously\nimportant?",
        "Q: In the early years --",
        "Q: Yeah, in -- in the -- in your first years in this country, were you -- was your social\ngroup very much a group of survivors?",
        "Q: I was -- in -- in thinking about how you, I think, managed to -- to endure those\nyears of suffering, of extreme brutality and so on, and yet to come out of it and be able\nto be a sort of loving, warm person, I\u2019m guessing -- I -- I\u2019d like you to -- to tell me\nwhether you\u2019ve thought about how you were able to do that? Was it the -- the\nupbringing you had? The friendships? I -- I mean, there must be things that you\nthought of.",
        "Q: I asked that question, too, knowing that many -- many survivors have found it\ndifficult to adjust to -- to life because of how much they suffered. Others too, have had\nfull and rounded s -- remarkably successful lives, but do you think that you often\nsuffer because of your earlier suffering? I was thinking about, does it show up in great\nanxiety, about your wife, for instance? If she\u2019s late coming home, do you feel, do you\nthink, more concerned than somebody else might be? Are you more anxious?",

You\u2019ve told me how you supported\nthe Holocaust museum, that would be more recently, but are there other political or\nsocial things that are dear to your heart?",

        "Q: Was there any basis, though, for your accepting that when you were suffering,\nthings must be going badly?",

        "Answer: Okay. My name -- oh, you are holding it?",
        "A: My name is Morris Kornberg. Actually, f -- at home they used to call me, because I\ncome from an Orthodox home, Moshe, Moshe Kornberg. And I was born in Poland, in\nChadbush. My father\u2019s name was Menachem Rafar Rafael. Menachem Rafael. My\nmother\u2019s name was Yentla. Her maiden name was Malkavietska. My -- the oldest in\nour family was my sister Sarah. She was married. Her husband\u2019s name was Moshe\nAlexander. They had three kids, the oldest was a girl, and she had two boys. Then was\nmy oldest brother, his name was Haim. He was managing -- my father was semi-\nretired, and he took over the business, and he managed the business until -- as long as I\nremember, until the war started, and I didn\u2019t see him any more. Next I have another\nbrother, his name was Ayah. He left Poland, he was in a kibbutz in Poland, he left\nPoland, he went to Israel to build Israel up. And this was probably in 1933. Then next I\nhave a sister, she was still single, and her name was Miriam, in Polish used to call it\nManya. She was at home, living with the family. Then I had another brother, his name\nwas Abraham, and he was still single, he was three years older than me, and I was the\nyoungest in our family.",
        "A: Right, six brothers and sisters.",
        "A: Any time that you have any question, I\u2019d be glad to answer it.",
        "A: Right, exactly, yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s correct. I -- I was raised in a strict Orthodox family, more or less my\nfather belonged to Hassidim. And -- but the only difference was, he was not a fanatic\neither. We had been home -- three brothers and sister, we always brought home Zionist\norganization\u2019s books. We had to do always -- parents, my father\u2019s j-job was to keep us\nbusy. So we could do anything. Our education, he never rejected it, or tell us he want\nus to read. And actually, what we used to bring home, always books, and all those\nbrothers and sisters, he practically read all books, although he was more a model\nOrthodox person.",
        "A: More or less. I think this what it was. Til 14 - 15, actually, we had to go along\nalways, like the services, special on Shabbas, on holidays, we always went along with\nmy father, and it would be not nice for us not to go along, so we went along. But after\nwe had been 15 years old, we still went for education, Jewish religion, and higher\nlearnings. But my father had enough, was wise enough to see that the world is\nchanging, and you cannot stay always in -- how he would like it, so he gave us more --\nall brothers and sisters, freedom. After fif -- 15, we could d -- go our way.",
        "A: Oh, our family was a very great family, with lots of love. Kids for parents, and vice\nversa, parents for kids. Our economical status was fairly good, better than average.\nAnd the most of all, 1t cannot go higher with regards in us to our parents, and vice\nversa, the parents to us. I feel that love like this cannot be greater, and will never be\ngreater, at the times what I spent home, and close the circle with our family.",
        "A: This is a question actually, I cannot answer too good of it, because under the\ncircumstances, I practically gave up life the day when I was arrested. This was in\nJanuary, must been around July or August, and I was integrated for Gestapo, and\nbeaten unmerciful, but I was -- the most fear was, for me actually, beating, because\nthey used to beat me when I was interviewed by Gestapo, til I passed out. When I\npassed out, they didn\u2019t have running water, over there at the police station, they\ndragged me out to a well, where they poured water on my head, and I was revived, dra\n-- dragged back inside, and again beating, and beating. And this was my biggest fear of\nit was beating. And I begged the officer who interviewed me to shoot me on the spot.\nHe laughed, and he told me, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this. You don\u2019t nec -- you\ndon\u2019t have to expect tha -- that you will live. But we finish you off not when you want\nit, we finish you when we want it.\u201d This was the answer.",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s a big story, I gonna try to -- just to tell you in more details. We had\nbusiness, all kind of bus -- my parents started actually, with a grocery store, good\nbusiness. But when my mo -- my oldest brother, Haim, when he was more or less in\nhis 20\u2019s, early 20\u2019s, and he slowly took over business by our parents, and he always\nlooked at a food store, little grocery store, we could make a living, he made a living,\nbut he couldn\u2019t make money all the -- actually for a better life. So he started it, he -- he\nwas a representative -- in our town, small town in Chadbush was four smaller\nfactories. They all produced the same product, more or less, like knives, forks. And the\nmostly of it, it was not expensive, it wasn\u2019t the most cheapest actually, tableware, what\nyou can have it. And this used to be shipped to Galeetsia, farther down near the\nRussian border where we had it. And my brother used to supply raw materials, and\napparently, I don\u2019t know exactly, but he made always so much percentage on the\nsupplies profit. And this got better and better every time, with more -- and the season\nmostly in those factories, smaller fat -- f -- smaller factories was about four or five\nmonths of the year, where business were real good, and about six, seven months were\nslack. And they had a rough time to meet payrolls for the workers what they kept on.\nAnd my buth -- my brother used to borrow money, actually to those factories, not for a\nfavor, but actually to make some money, too. So they paid so much percentage per\nmonth, or whatever, I was not familiar, I was too young to know about business. Then\nfinally he invested in one particular factory, it belongs to a Gentile in out town, his\nname was Rochinsky. And he had a little bit rough time to repay it, whatever he owed\nus, So he took -- he proposed my brother to be a partner in the factory. And this went\non til war time [indecipherable]. In 1939, when the Germans came in, my brother\nrealized it\u2019s another -- a different era already. We -- as being well and everything, but\nwe realized that we shouldn\u2019t show that we had any interest in the factory, because we\nknow it, that Jewish property was confiscated right from the beginning. Nobody went\ndown, because before the war, since 1937, my brother send me over to the factory to\nget the fa-familiar with the procedures, how to deal with the people who worked in the\nfactory, and how to deal with customers who buy -- bought our merchandise; to get\nfamiliar with it. But since -- when the Germans came in, this stopped, so my brother\nsaid, \u201cDon\u2019t mention any more, you stay home like anybody else.\u201d And take -- in 19 --\nthe end of \u201939, we had to go in to live in a ghetto. So we lived in the ghetto, and life\ngot terrible expensive because Jewish people never got any rations, because rations for\nGentiles -- they used to get the food cards every month, but didn\u2019t got. So the Black\nMarket was very high. If you want buy a loaf of bread, you have to buy -- you have to\npay 10 times the value, and so any other products. Well, life got to get very expensive\nuntil 1940. In 1940, they arrested the owner, Rochinsky was arrested for Gestapo,\nbecause he was more or less a intelligent person. They had been scared, the Germans\ndidn\u2019t trust the more intelligent people. And he was taken in the 40\u2019s, to Auschwitz.\nAfter two, three weeks -- we didn\u2019t know much about the Auschwitz in 1940, but after\ntwo, three weeks, came a telegram that he\u2019s not any more alive, and his clothing was\nsent back to his widow. And my brother said -- we have been three brothers at home,\nand the oldest brother, he had already like a green band, instead had the white arm\nband with the Star of David, he used to have a green band with the Star of David. The\ngreen band meant actually that you are privileged. A Jew was not allowed to dry -- to\nride the train, or go out after seven o\u2019clock from the ghetto, to be seen on a street.\nThey had still curfew for Jews. And everywhere, wherever, you couldn\u2019t move freely,\nbut if you had a green band, you could ride the train, you had been -- you could move\nfreely, you could go out after seven o\u2019clock actually. And this was a -- of course, the\nGerman government required if you would supply some metal products, even scaret of\nmetal. So many pounds, was -- I don\u2019t know exactly, they gave you a green band that\nyou are privileged Jew, and you could go more or less freely, wherever you wanted.\nHe saw it that my -- otherwise we have it -- used to be any Jew from 18 til 55 was a --\nforced to perform some labor for the city, otts -- clean cities, or whatever. I was\nassigned in a quarry, a stone quarry, actually, and was very -- pretty hard work, but it -\n- in the evening, after eight hours, or 10 hours, I don\u2019t know exactly either, how many\nhours we worked, we could go home and spend with our family at home. This went\non, but still my brother said that he going to see a very -- that I get a green band, too,\nthat I will not have to go to the slave labor every day, to the quarry. True, he had some\nconnections in a larger city with some Jewish, more or less, leaders from the Jewish\ncommunity, and they had connection, they had been able to bribe Gestapo, and SS.\nBribing, if you gave money or some products what they wanted it, you could get\nfavors from them, and they did it. When my brother arranged the same way, he had to\npay money for it, that I will be assigned, to start to be as -- to go every day to labor in\nthe city, that my assignment will be to put in labor in the factory, to work in the\nfactory, to perform labor, whatever it was [indecipherable]. At this time the factory\nwas idle, because Mrs. Rochinsky, she was -- she had three girls, and she was not able\nto manage a factory, she didn\u2019t know it. Besides this, when the German came in, they\nright away, they froze all salaries. Practically anyplace where s -- they had\n[indecipherable] employees, they couldn\u2019t pay any higher wages than -- than pre-war\nwages. And this was a problem, because whatever they have to buy, food for\nthemselves, even with rations, or you wanted to buy something better, was sayvay four\nor five times as much as pre-war, [indecipherable] nobody wanted the war. When I --\nwhen I had the permission to go down perform my job in the factory, my brother set\nme up, that I should get in contact with the employers who used to work before the\nwar, and tell them if they come to work, they will be able to earn three times, or four\ntimes as much as they earned b-before the war. And they should be -- come to work to\ndo their job, and we will pay them real good. I started to organize, and this -- people\nstarted to come back, until I opened the factory and started to produce. But, it was a\nproblem. You had to have books, because you never know when the German\ngovernment going to come to check your books. So e -- we have been forced to have\ndouble bookkeeping. One set of book was actually what we did pay them. Same way\nwe used to get -- we used write [indecipherable] what we sold to dealers, we sold\nmostly to Jewish merchants, and we gave them a bill, the price like before the war, and\nthey paid us the same way, two, three times this amount. But the point was we still had\nto keep double bookkeeping, until one of those days, and this was apparently in \u00b041,\none of the employee, he was not mad at me, he work over there a long time already,\nand he knows me, and he saw me before the warm I was in the factory involved. And\nhe got a -- with a disagreement with the owner in -- in the place, and he went to\nGestapo, and he told them that the factory actually belongs more to us than it belongs\nto her, it\u2019s a Jewish factory, and he told all kinds. For example, we used to have, when\nwe finished merchandise before, we shipped it out to those merchants who bought our\nmerchandise, we always had been afraid that someday the Gestapo will come, and they\nwill confiscate everything. And where we used to keep finished merchandise, not far\naway from the factory 1n a village, and it used to be hidden aboll where we could\nalways ship this merchandise, because we never know if -- when they will come to\nconfiscate the factory. And he told the Gestapo everything, what is going on, that the\nmerchandise 1s in a aboll in the next village. And finally, one day, like I said, must\nhave been July or August, a policeman came to our home, and he said that I should\ncome down to this jontamarie, where they had their headquarters. Normally, our town\nwas a small town, we didn\u2019t had, actually, Gestapo, SS in our town, only jontamarie\nwe had it. But once in -- every few weeks, two, three weeks, what I don\u2019t know\nexactly, they used to come in a larger town, SS, they -- if they had any complaints to\ntake care cases, this when they come in to take care the -- of those business. And iva\nthe policemens told me I am called to the jontamarie, to come down. And I remember,\nand I can remember it exactly like today. I looked at my mother, and I saw her face,\nand it didn\u2019t help me that I have to go down, but it help me the suffering in my mother,\nand so my father, too. I went down in a sleeveless shirt --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Expression of my mother was -- it\u2019s unforgettable, because like I just said, it\u2019s\nexactly -- I can see it with my eyes right now, how her expression was -- she felt\nscared. She didn\u2019t know it -- what it will happen to me. And I could read anything\nwhat she had in her mind, I saw it with my eyes. I saw my father -- I was sleeveless, I\ndidn\u2019t took even my jacket, and I told them, I ha -- I practically shivered, and I said,\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry about it, I will be back in a couple hours.\u201d But --",

        "A: -- actually. And so the -- everything -- whatever he mentioned it, he mentioned me\nas a -- you know, the double bookkeeping, and everything that I was involved. And so\nthis why they called me. And I went down, it was a pretty warm day, and I came down\nover there, and I was called in in a room, where I saw a very high officer. I couldn\u2019t\ntell his rank, I\u2019m not familiar, but he was a very high officer. And I looked, he had a\nstack of papers, maybe two, three inches high, and he start to ask me questions, if I am\nin the factory over there, if I help manage the factory. And right away I realized, when\nI saw this stack of papers, I realized what the questions are, that he knows more than I\nmyself know, because of I realized that it\u2019s no use to lie, and I start to tell anything\nfully -- fully to cooperate with them. But this was not a big deal, cooperation did not\nhelp to save me. He called in two strong guys from the Gestapo. Young guys, strong\nguys. And they had like a special chair, like to lay down on it, not to sit, but -- on my\nbelly to lay over there, that my back, everything is exposed. And they came in with --\nthe -- the SS and Gestapo, they used to carry, when they went on the street, made from\nleather -- I don\u2019t know even how they call this in English, I don\u2019t recall, exactly,\nwhatever. You know, for beating somebody, just on the street. They saw a Jewish kid,\nor whatever, they beat over the head with it, something like this. And they told me to\nlay down on my belly on this chair, whatever it was, it was built special for this\npurpose, actually. And in both sides, right and left, kept on pounding in my body,\nactually. And actually, it\u2019s impossible. I was young, and strong at this time, maybe, but\nbeating like this, I don\u2019t think any human can take it. And I used to pass out. When I\npassed out, they dragged me out to the well, they pumped water on my head. As soon I\ncame back, they dragged me back in, and again and again and again. And I always was\nmore on the floor anyway, especial with the beating, I couldn\u2019t stand straight any\nmore. They didn\u2019t give you a chair to seat, and so you had a choice, all to be on your\nall four on the floor, or actually -- you know, to stay, you couldn\u2019t stay. I was always\non the floor. I went -- he was sitting at the table, he had very polished, high boots on it,\nand I remember I practically was very -- pretty close to his boots. And I told him in\nGerman, \u201cPlease shoot me. Please finish me off.\u201d And he laughed, looked in my eyes,\nhe said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this, but we finish you off when we want it,\nnot when you want it.\u201d And this went on hours and hours. This was actually --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: This 1s a -- this is the same way, this -- you cannot ans -- for a question like this,\nthis just happened to be that the -- first was burned the synagogue, what this was once\nin the -- famous all over the world, not in Poland, but all over the world, was a famous\nfor art, and beauty, and anything what is possible, actually, to describe this synagogue.\nAnd the reason was actually the synagogue was near a river what it went through our\ntown, the Pilitsa. And it was a bridge, and the bridge actually was a wooden bridge. It\nwas not a heavy structure, a wooden bridge. And when the Germans invaded, I\nremember it was on a Friday, the first of September was on a Friday when they c --\nyeah, it was a Friday, and Saturday they have been already over there. And so the first\nthing what they did, they tried to secure the bridge, they -- they can come in and cross\nwherever they wanted with their armies. So they put the bridge on fire, after they went\nin, and this was near the synagogue, and because the structure was a wooden structure,\napparently -- I don\u2019t know, maybe they put bombs -- firebombs actually on it before --\nthis 1 -- I don\u2019t know either, because I actually, myself, and so the -- mostly of the\ntown, the whole town, run away in the woods. So we didn\u2019t know exactly, but we\nknow it right away the next day, that the synagogue was burned. Actually, it was\nnothing left over from the synagogue. This -- this all as I can recall, actually.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: Okay, go ahead, whatever you ask, I will -- 1f I can answer [indecipherable]",
        "A: Chadbush, the main place, actually, was Chadbush it was the name, but Chadbush\nwas the -- a divided. On one side of the river -- of the Pilitsa, where the bridge was,\nwas the one side was Chadbush, when you crossed the bridge, they called it Vidamma.\nActually, it was the same town, but it still, this was Chadbush, and this was Vidamma.\nIn the ghetto, when they had to leave everything, the houses, and anything, and go, the\nghetto was actually made in Vidamma. The reason was because it was already a little\nbit out of the town, and it was easier to petition it off with wires, or whatever, to make\nit that you cannot just walk out of the ghetto as a free person. And this was the easiest\nthing, cause of the German decided that Vidamma wi -- will be the ghetto, and this\nactually where all Jews, including my family, lived. In Vidamma, in the ghetto.",
        "A: Yavishavitz. This is actually -- I was four weeks -- probably it\u2019s mentioned the\nsame way, my first tape. I went -- after the beating, they took me down, back to the\nfactory, and I didn\u2019t know it even at this time, that the widow from the owner, actually,\nshe was a -- she was not Jewish, a Gentile, and she was arrested too, for the same\ncrime like me, that we had double bookkeeping, that we had hidden finished\nmerchandise, whatever. So she was arrested, and I never knowed it -- that -- til he --\nuntil four weeks later. But I -- I was -- first they put me in a jail in Chadbush. And\nChadbush was not a official -- a big jail, was a very small -- in fact, they used to call it\n-- | don\u2019t know the name, accosa. A big jail is like jeminale, you know, but this was a\nsmall -- it was just for drunks, or whatever. Not too much, you know, criminals. And\nthey hold me overnight. When I came to this jail, -- oh the first -- this was the first\ntime in my life I came in a jail, but we used to hear stories, if you have been a\nnewcomer in a jail, they made jokes with you, all kind, a lot of time even beating, or\nwhatever. This was the fun -- this how -- it used to be a custom, and -- when you was a\nnewcomer in a jail. When I came in over -- to this jail, actually, they probably realized\nI couldn\u2019t walk straight, and mine back, everything, was black practically. But for\nsome reason, they didn\u2019t perform all those jokes, what they used to do it for a\nnewcomer. And they felt more or less like sorry for me, you know, that I was all\nbeaten up, so they let me alone. Little bit later on, came in the one who was like a\npoliceman, he was in charge of this small jail. And he knowed my parents, or he\nknowed me, too. So he came over to me, he wa -- they was P-Poles, not a -- not\nGermans, but a Pole, and he came over, and he asked me if I want write home\nsomething to m -- to my parents about me. At first I hardly could even take a pencil,\nmy hand to write any words, but I -- I said it\u2019s necessary to write home. And I wrote\nhome in the same way I think on the ID cards what they distributed in the Holocaust\nmuseum, what I took part those -- they have this saying in sayvay things like this you\ncannot forget. I wrote home, and I said in my few words what I was writing, I told\nthem please -- twice I said please, please forget about me, I be all right. Go on with\nyour life, noble. Just forget about me. This was in Chadbush still. This was my last\nword to my parents and family. The next morning they took me -- they brought me --\nit\u2019s just 40 kilometers from Chadbush, and the name is Koinsket. This is a larger town,\nand they had over there a -- a large -- a k -- prison -- a prison for the -- for -- mostly for\npeople who don\u2019t obey the law, whatever, but it was much, much larger. I was brought\nin over there, first they took me to Gestapo in Koinsket, and I was real -- really\nconcerned. I-I didn\u2019t care, I was afraid just for more beating, that I couldn\u2019t take it any\nmore. So I -- every minute I was over there, I just kept on looking when they start --\ngoing to start to beat me again, but they never did. They brought me over to the jail.\nWhen I came into the jail, I was released, that -- at least I wasn\u2019t beaten any more, I\ncame in over there. And the same thing, I know the procedure again, that those all in\njail gonna make -- have fun, whatever. And they saw me coming in, and the same way\nthey felt sorry for me, and they know it that I\u2019m not a criminal, and they realize that --\nwhy I am over there, because it was involved for politics too, because the bookkeeper\nfrom our factory used to always to give me a -- handle over some mimeographs that\nused to come from the underground, from the -- England, to tell you how the front\ngoes on over there. And so he told them that I -- I have knowledge about the\nunderground, too, was a -- this was part why I was arrested, actually. And they kept on\ncoming, talking this over, how I behaved, and -- and I did whatever they told me. We\nhave been in a cell, probably was over there the same way, between 30 and 40 people,\nand everybody has a -- like in a corner, in a straw sack he had over there where you\nrested overnight to sleep, actually. In the same way it was no modern facilities in this\njail. We used to have a large can, real huge, and everybody -- what a human has to do\nit, or -- they did everything the whole night, in this large kettle -- can, whatever. And\nin the morning it was always they changed it. Two people, they used to carry out, and\ntake care, and then was to sc-scrub the floors, to keep it clean, everything. I recall after\na f-few days that -- certain the third day, the fourth day, it was -- I was 1n the line to\ncarry this out, and scrub the floors, and so far. And I went over to do it, I didn\u2019t look\nthat somebody should do for me any favors, I went over like any other prisoner. And\nthen one Pole came, and pushed me away, and he said he will do this for me. I -- I\ndidn\u2019t want to fight it, I let him do it. And the same way, after a few days, maybe after\na week, the one who was in charge, like the warden in jail, he was not German, he was\nPolish, too. So he called me in his office, he came to me, I went down from that cell in\nhis office. And he told me, \u201cDon\u2019t be upset, you probably -- your brothers are working\nfor you that you going to be released. You will probably be -- be released 1f not this\nweek, is next week, a third week. But they work for you, to release you.\u201d It meant that\nthey going to bribe the Gestapo for it. And he says, \u201cI know -- they are in contact with\nme, and I will see that you get food. You don\u2019t have to eat that food from the jail.\nSomebody will bring in every day, food for you. And so you going to have private\nfood, not from jail. But,\u201d he said, \u201cjust -- this 1s a secret.\u201d This is a very dangerous\nthing, I should never tell nobody what happened, what had happened. He will see that I\nwill be supplied with food. And I noticed that actually that it changed a little bit, you\nknow. I felt more comfortable, and so were all those other in the cell, the other person\nthas this -- they didn\u2019t know it, where I was exactly, but -- this was a secret when I\ncalled into the office, to this warden. But they saw something goes on, so I didn\u2019t say a\nword, but they felt that I am better treated like anybody else, more or less. And so they\ntried, actually, always, what I had to do, they jumped in, pushed me away, and they\nused to do it for me. And we got along fairly well. This was -- actually, in jail over\nthere, in Koinsket, I was four weeks. I remember one day they brought in two Jewish\npeople, because I was the only Jew on the -- in this cell. But they brought in a couple\nJewish people, I know them. They have been in Vidamoff, in the ghetto, they lived in\nthe ghetto. They used to be butcher -- butchers, and they got caught by the German\nauthority that they butchered a cow, or whatever. They took them, they put them --\nthey brought them over to the jail. And I can recall normally they have not been so\nreligious people, a butcher, whatever, but one had along with him a prayer book, and\nthe whole night he didn\u2019t do nothing else, except he kept on praying from the prayer\nbook. Prays -- was it -- to me it was not strange, 1t was familiar, everything. And I ask\nmyself, he\u2019s not such hot religious person, why does he pray so much? What is\nhappen, early in the morning, maybe five o\u2019clock, still was dark, they called off their\nname, they took them out, and we heard a few shots. The others in the cell told me,\n\u201cYou know, they got shot. They killed them.\u201d Over there, outside the jail. I didn\u2019t\nknow now -- think I didn\u2019t know it, if they are dead, if it\u2019s true what they told me, but I\nknow it -- it\u2019s fa -- was not just calling off a name. We heard shots.",
        "A: Yeah, because the same way, it was not allowed to butcher anything, especial on\nthe kashrut you know, by a rabbi, and everything, this was their things, you -- this was\nnot allowed. In fact, it was those -- the ghetto was so crowded, if a Christian, a Pole,\nstart to bring in food to sell on -- for -- for profit, on the black market, whatever, and\nhe got caught by gendarmarie, whatever, they put them in jail, too. R -- they didn\u2019t\ndare to -- even to bring in food, even to make money, they been scared for their own\nlife.",
        "A: Yeah, they did.",
        "A: The bookkeeper in the factory, he was probably -- oh, probably eight or 10 years\nolder than me, because he was married, and had I think, two, three kids already. And\nhe used to like, you know, to drink a little bit. He was -- he was a brilliant man, a\nbrilliant mind, very brilliant. His name was Levandoski, and he for some reason, he\nliked me.",
        "A: A Gentile, yeah, a Gentile. He liked me, and they didn\u2019t know it at home, he used\nto take me along to restaurants, where he used to buy -- h-he -- he da -- was not so well\noff, you know, but he used to buy me that I drink with him together, and I used to do\nit, actually, because he wasn\u2019t much older than me, and young people -- young boys\nlike me, I was at this time 20 -- 19 years old, so it was for me a privilege. I used to\ncome home, my parents used to think that I am sick, because they served dinner, and I\ndidn\u2019t eat it, I was not hungry, because I ate with him in the restaurant. And the ta --\nsame way that he had touch with the underground, actually. He used to take me home,\neven home, what is not allowed heah to foreign language -- foreign countries, and he\nused to, on short wave he get always, he got BBC, and plus he used to get once a\nmonth, a mimeograph, a little thing, they told you on the front what is going on. And\nhe always shared with me, he really kept me -- I don\u2019t know why, but like I would be\nhis closest buddy. And he actually was arrested, too, before me. They send him to\nAuschwitz, the same way, after a week, two, he came a telegram, he\u2019s not alive any\nmore. We didn\u2019t know really what Auschwitz means, what Auschwitz 1s, but we\nalways was thinking, okilly, as soon you go over, a week later comes a telegram you\ndead, so it\u2019s -- must be more than what anybody knows about Auschwitz.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, I know it.",
        "A: It was a -- an employee, I knowed him very well. His name was Novokowski. He\nknowed me well, we got along real good. I don\u2019t know -- he didn\u2019t meant actually to\nhurt me, so much. He was trying to hurt the widow in the factory, because he was mad\nat her.",
        "A: Oh yeah, she respect us, she respect our family. She knows how much money we\nhave in -- it\u2019s involved -- what we have over there in the factory. Plus, she felt at this\ntime, you have been a woman, a lady, something, you have not got involved in\nbusiness. You was involved to raise th -- your family, the three girls, nobody\u2019s home.",
        "A: And so she was happy to see that I take over the duties.",
        "A: Normally, actually, what it is, sure the anti-Semitism was a real great big, big, and\nevery day got bigger actually, the anti-Semitism. This actually why br -- mine brother\nleft in \u00b033, he saw it -- what is coming, more or less. And he say he doesn\u2019t want to\nstay in Poland, doesn\u2019t want no part, so he just -- and he was a patriot to build Israel,\nthis was the reason. We thought he is not normal, he goes away from the -- from the\ngood home, and he used to say he\u2019s ashamed that we are making money easy, you\nknow, he believe more you have to work for your money, not just from business. So\nfar -- he was very, very much patriotic, but the -- with me, actually, I didn\u2019t know it, I\nwas over there four weeks in jail, and then suddenly, about -- after four weeks, I\nremember, yeah, somebody called my name. And I recognize right away this was the\nwidow from the factory, Mrs. Rochinski, and she in Polish calls me, you know, and --\nand so if she\u2019s -- and she -- I responded, \u201cYeah, I am here, in this cell.\u201d I don\u2019t know if\n-- where she know it, or apparently she know it. And so she told me that she is\nreleased, she --after four weeks -- she was four weeks 1n jail, and she said she -- they\nreleased her, she goes home. She told me that I shouldn\u2019t worry, I will go home. They\nhad already the release for me, but they need a signature from a higher officer, and\nthey have to go to another town for this high office signature. \u201cSo you probably will be\nreleased tomorrow,\u201d she told me. And they all -- the other inmates in the cell where\nwas -- I was with them, they all heard it, and everybody was happy for me, I going to\ngo home tomorrow. And they gave me addresses to go to their families, and their\nwives, tell them how they are, what they this. It was a -- like a holiday already, the day\nwhen she called us. But the next morning, early in the morning, this what the\nprocedure [indecipherable] in the morning, they called off my name, they called off\nother inmates name, but I -- something didn\u2019t sound to me right, because they kept on\ncalling too many names. Because they used to do every few weeks, every month or\ntwo -- but I don\u2019t know the same way, exactly how often they did it. They emptied the\njails for new inmates. In other word, they took those jails, and they send them to\nconcentration camps, like Auschwitz or whatever, and -- but when they took us, they\ntied our -- our hand to the back, and -- just with a piece string, like, actually, nothing,\nand they put us on trucks, and they drove, I don\u2019t know how many kilometer -- I never\nknow even til today where I was. I think -- I assume it was Kelsa, because from\nKoinsket, biz -- Kelsa was not so far, and took about a couple hours in a truck. And\nthen they brought us to a market over there on the -- we have been told -- we saw all\naround SS, with machine guns, rifle gu -- whatever, circled around us, and they kept\non bringing to another jail, so I don\u2019t know [indecipherable] else, until they get it, a\nlarge quantity of people the same way and it -- it must have been several thousand,\nactually. Took quite a number of hours, until when we all have been, and you have --\nlay on the floor, on your knees, you could not raise your head, if you raised your head,\nyour -- they told us, then you will be shot. You know, your -- right away they watched\nwith rifles around over there, or machine gun. Well, we all laid on the -- on the f -- on\nthe ground over there on this market, until actually they had the amount of people, or\nwhate -- what they expected to have it on the jails, and they put us on cat -- those cattle\nwagons, in the same ways. We used to see the one who guarded some of them have\nbeen Wehrmarkt, and so we have been more friendlier, because you couldn\u2019t just talk\nto one from the SS, he finished you on -- off on the spot. But we saw [indecipherable]\nthey ask him where they take us, where we going to go, where we going. \u201cOh,\u201d they\nused to say, \u201coh, you go probably where you going to have to | -- be over there, do\nsome work, labor.\u201d [indecipherable] all, and we didn\u2019t know it until we arrived around\nmidnight, probably, over there, and the first thing I saw it when they brought in, they\nopened the gate, and it said, the gate said abait bakt fry. And I didn\u2019t know that this\nwas a g -- in Auschwitz a gate, didn\u2019t know it. But as soon we -- we got off in\nrestraints, although it was guarded off -- they have a bi -- large ramp -- ramp, and both\nsides have been guarded by SS. And they had sticks, irons, all kind things, and when\nthey chase you out, and everything was schnell, schnell, fast, fast. And so you got --\nwherever you move, wherever you go, it didn\u2019t make any different. They hit you over\nyour head, or your back. It depends how lucky you have been, and we had to keep on\nmoving. And this what we did, and then we saw people, like kapos in uniforms, striped\nuniforms. We didn\u2019t know it -- they start to talk, and they said, \u201cHere\u2019s Auschwitz,\u201d\nyou know? And some of them have been only over there from those kapos what they --\nthey want to kill you practically on the spot. Any move, whatever it was, it didn\u2019t\nmake any different. It was only, you know, to make you so miserable, that you will\ngive up li -- living. The truth 1s, I gave up right away the first day when I was arrested.\nI figured this is the end. And I could see it right away, wherever I was, that it\u2019s\nnowhere in the world -- you know, the dreaming that I will go home, see my parents,\nsee my family, or be free. A lot of -- the first thing when I gave up, I figured what\u2019s\nthe use to fight? You cannot fight this, and why suffer? So you -- no use to suffer\neither.",
        "A: Yeah, this is -- I don\u2019t know. In fact, Jewish people have not been allowed to visit a\njail if they have somebody -- like some other -- if you have been Gentile, you have\nbeen allowed, I don\u2019t know, every two weeks, or every -- to see some relatives or\nfriend, but for Jewish people was not allowed. One time, the warden from the jail\narranged that my older brother from me I was the youngest, but next to me, his name\nwas Abraham, that he come to see me, he can speak with me. So I wait, he called me\nout to come to his office, took me out from the cell. There I was in his office, and he\ntold me, look, this a --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: And he said he does it, but it\u2019s not legal, 1t\u2019s not allowed for a Jewish person to\nhave any visits [indecipherable], but he says, \u201cYour brother gonna come to this\nwindow,\u201d and he hold me over there by the window, and he said, \u201cYou talk to your\nbrother.\u201d And I went in the window, I saw my brother, and he said, \u201cMoshe.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cAvrum.\u201d We called each other\u2019s name. And then the warden, he watched it\npretty careful, and he saw through the window that a s -- ess -- SS car coming closer,\nand he didn\u2019t know where they come, but right away he said, \u201cBack -- quick, back to\nthe cell.\u201d I went back to the cell, and I never saw nobody any more.",
        "A: Yeah, and the next day, this when they called off and they brought us to Auschwitz.\nAnd --",
        "A: Probably not. No way, I mean you -- this was so secretly arranged, that nobody\ncould trace nobody. No, this was not -- never -- impossible. This I know it.",
        "A: I never heard it, and I never met -- I never saw nobody, not s -- ever. Nothing. In\nthe same way, even when I was in the Auschwitz, and I saw this is the end of the w-\nworld, and everything, but I never could forget not that I\u2019m suffering -- this was out of\nthe question, I just felt for their suffering, sorry you know, but it didn\u2019t help me much.",
        "A: None.",
        "A: None. Zero.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I checked when they had one time -- the Red Cross arranged one time a reunion\nwith other who have been with me in Auschwitz. And so I had left all names, and all\nwhatever the questions what they gave me to fill out, and for awhile they send me a\nletter that they have everything, they keep on checking. Then, maybe six months later,\nor a year later, they send me another letter, they did their best, but they can never could\nplace it -- any -- any of the names that I requested.",
        "A: You mean my birth home?",
        "A: Yes. This was in 1945. Finally, I was -- the last dead march -- I -- I made more than\none dead march, that was made in the end of December, between Christmas and New\nYear. The first dead march was from Auschwitz over Yaveeshavitz to Buchenwald.\nThen, from Buchenwald I\u2019d say where I was 1n a subcamp from Buchenwald, the\nname was Traylitz, this is near Leipzig. And around early April, or the end of March\nthey say the -- the allied forces start to get closer. Well, the first thing, they put us for a\nrecreation, too, they kept on. They kept us in two weeks what 1s -- you know, I don\u2019t\nwant go into details, because y -- it -- I will never be able to even finish, even if you\nstay a whole week. It was -- I did survive the dead march. They kept us on trains, we\nused to go in the woods for a day. I just found out later that they used to, every day,\nfrom one place to the other place was maybe 10 - 15 kilometers, th-the -- they have\nbeen -- our train was on a one track line. We didn\u2019t go nowhere, we just went from one\nplace, and the next day we went back to the other place. And we thought -- we didn\u2019t\nrealize that this is the same place, we didn\u2019t go nowhere. And I have been, for two\nweeks -- not me only, but all of us who survive what actually -- in a few thousand they\nstarted off when they evacuate us, until to the end, maybe was 50 - 60 left. In\nthousands, the all other been on the -- on the roads and the ditches, their bodies was\nlaying because they have been shot, they have been exhausted from walking,\nwhatever, and automatically, if you couldn\u2019t walk, automatically the guard shot you.\nDoesn\u2019t make any difference. But I survived over there. So the last thing, I arrived in\nTheresienstadt. And this was -- the same way, you know, I -- I -- must be early of\nApril. And at this time, when I arrived in Theresienstadt actually, I was probably 99\npercent point nine dead, actually. I have very little signs that I\u2019m alive, actually. And\nin fact, it was in -- a coincidence that -- even that I reached Theresienstadt, because in\nLitenritz, one night, when they -- those all who -- who still have been alive, they\nbrought us first the night before -- we have been in I think the camp called Litenritz,\nand this was terrible condi -- conditions. And being two weeks without food, without\nwater, even the little food what we used to get, but without this [indecipherable] it\ndidn\u2019t -- we have not been far away in 100 percent to be dead. And what had happened\nin this Litenritz actually, that they said in the morning they going to serve us coffee, a\nhot, liquid something, whatever. And over there the barracks didn\u2019t had even floors,\nand laying in mud, you didn\u2019t had no bunkbeds, nothing. If you laid down for the night\nto rest, or to sleep, how you call it, you laid in the mud. But nothing to -- less, and\nnothing more but in the mud. And this was a terrible things, without everything, but a\nhuman, if you have anything, any instinct being a human, you know that this doesn\u2019t\ngo farther. I didn\u2019t slept even the whole night, but probably I would have been fall\nasleep, and waited actually that I\u2019m going to get -- I know it would be a little bit dark,\nmud, whatever they called it, they called it coffee, but we get it. And we used to carry\nalways a can, a rusted can if they found it, if somebody going to give us something,\nthat we have a can to take the food. And early in the morning, they called you, coffee.\nAnd I was trying to be from the first, because I know it if I don\u2019t go to the first, I will\nnever reach any more what they gave you. I was among the first, and they gave me the\namount what -- in my rusted coffee, and I just pour it in -- in my body, whatever they\ngave it to me. I -- I don\u2019t know til today what it was. I just poured it in. And took a few\nhours, and they told us that the guards will come, they will take us to the next camp.\nWe heard about Theresienstadt, we know that Theresienstadt is not actually a\nconcentration camp, it\u2019s a model camp. We -- we had not been afraid, we cannot go --\nwe cannot lose now, see, it cannot be worse than it is. And we have been happy that\nfinally -- that we will -- we will reach Theresienstadt, but not always what you think is\nhappening. For some reason, after this, I got diarrhea, and this was outside, actually, I\ndidn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think they even had toilets in this camp, wherever. And I -- I was\ndehydrated, I could tell, I mean, I didn\u2019t had it before because I was two weeks\nwithout food, without water. I was fairly dehydrated and I couldn\u2019t get up. My friends,\nwhat we -- I know them from Auschwitz still, they came by and they said good news,\n[indecipherable] you know, we going to come to Theresienstadt in the next hour or\ntwo. And I told the one that I know them very well, w-was intimate friendship in\nAuschwitz, in Yaveeshavitz. His name was Yankey. And I told him, \u201cYankila, it\u2019s too\nlate for me.\u201d And he said, \u201cIn the all suffering what you know what you had in\nAuschwitz, in the coal mine, and everything,\u201d he said -- he said, \u201cdon\u2019t make me leave\nyou here.\u201d And they actually risked their lives, two of them, and they practically\ncarried me in to Theresienstadt. But still I never had any hope that I will be able to\nwalk, or for freedom. I realized it\u2019s too late even to have any hope. [indecipherable]\nshow it, actually, when we came to Theresienstadt we look like animals, we act like\nanimals. Those who still could walk were -- whatever they start to give us some\nrations, some of them who have been stronger, they used to see that -- used to pass by\nwagons that went to the kitchen for the supplies, and they used to highjack those\nwagons and steal everything out, bread, or potatoes, or whatever they have over there.\nAnd those people from Theresienstadt, those inmates, they have been scared of us like\nwild animals, and it\u2019s not just [indecipherable], we have been. We look like animals\n[indecipherable] but after they too start to get help more or less, that some ladies,\nnurses came in, and they start to clean us up, because I still had the same clothing, the\nsame shirt, or whatever, when I left Auschwitz, this was the end of -- of December.\nAnd I never had another -- never changed nothing, and this was already practically the\nend of April, where they took everything what we took off they burned it on the spot,\nand they gave us some clothing, more or less. And they bathed us, and shaved us. I\nmean, they cleaned us up, they disinfect us, more or less. And then we heard it already,\nthat bring in in Switzerland, in Schwietz, they used to send food o-over to\nTheresienstadt. Not only food, [indecipherable] the best food, you know, white bread,\nand cheeses, and -- and ham, sausage, oh, the best from the best practically. But people\n-- people kept on dying like flies, actually. When they start to eat, this was the end of\nit. | actually, the beginning, I -- I felt that I ate, and I could take food, and I got -- felt\nthat every day I\u2019d get stronger and feel better. And for some reason too, I don\u2019t know\nwhy, they picked me over there in Theresienstadt to be in charge of the food supply.\nTo give out, to see how many rations to prepare were there -- for the people who have\nbeen over there. There a certain amount of barracks, you know. One barrack was also -\n- they called it a hospital, but the truth 1s 1t was like a dump. It was a matter, you know,\nthey put you in, you couldn\u2019t walk any more, they put you in in the bed. They know it,\nnot in a matter of a day, but in an hour, you will be dead, so they throw you out, and\nthey put in another body in the bed. And so went on -- actually 99 percent all died,\nactually. Was no doctors, no nurses, and -- and I could feel that I get better and\neverything, but suddenly, I don\u2019t know what went bad, or what went wrong, or maybe\nbecause I was in close contact, I used -- I had to go in in this barrack every day and\ncount people who have been still alive. And the -- to know, you know, we need for this\nhospi -- the hospital, they called it a hospital. We need 50 rations, 60 rations. I used to,\nyou know, the dead have been on the g -- floor already, on the ground, I don\u2019t know\neven if it was a floor over there. On the ground, and the living -- so I count the living\nso there\u2019s how many rations to prepare. And I don\u2019t know, in a matter of in a week or\ntwo, I just caught something like a th -- a disease, but I -- I cannot explain it, I don\u2019t\nknow, and I will not know even, what had happened. For some reason, if it\u2019s good\nfood, whatever it was over there, and I could have as much as I desire and everything.\nIt was in a certain day, was like my mole was sealed off everything. I couldn\u2019t take it, I\ncouldn\u2019t look it. I used to go ahead, and take a nice roll, white roll, and put down all\nkind cheeses and sausage, whatever. And I told them -- this was -- not far away was a\npark over there, I says I going to sit on the bench in the park, and I will get an appetite,\neventually, I believe. Nothing helped. So I start to go right away, backwards, and it\ndoesn\u2019t take long. Whatever I gained, I lost much, much quicker than it took me to\ngain. And I couldn\u2019t walk any more either. And [indecipherable] say well, you have --\nsaid you -- you go to the hospital. I know it, what it is, but it was not -- it didn\u2019t matter\nto me, it was no difference. I realized whatever it is, it\u2019s too late for me. I went to the\nhospital, as I mentioned. It was no nurse, it was no doctor, I mean nothing. I just laid,\nthe same way, waiting, until they dump me out right there on the floor with the dead.\nWhy and what [indecipherable] behind my understanding, and how to tell, how to\nexplain, I did got over it. I did survive.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, I never saw them any more. I mean, they came. I -- later I heard about it, that\nthey -- they lived in Munich, around, they -- they did a lot of business like -- like now,\nwhatever, they\u2019ve been fairly wealthy. They made money already, but I never did. I --\nI don\u2019t know. To be honest, I was too naive, or too spoiled. I didn\u2019t -- if you have been\nfrom a family, a needy family, and been poor, actually, you had ambitious to go try to\nmake some money, to have a nicer life. But us, I know it, it went from generation to\ngeneration, the kids get older, the parents are tired, and you know, you take over. And\nI didn\u2019t realize, you know, that you have to work, even, for a living. I -- I thought it --\nit comes automatically, like this -- and special when I saw what had happened to our\nfamily, and to our wealth, and to our money, I practically hated money, and I didn\u2019t\nwant to have no part of it. I was not smart enough. And later, when I came to the\nUnited States, I regretted it, I saw it, I made a mistake.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: There\u2019s nothing what you could help it. Over there was like I mentioned it, it was\nstrictly a matter of waiting until actually you disappeared, you know, you -- you died.",
        "A: In my case, I don\u2019t know how you -- I don\u2019t know why, I just didn\u2019t drop dead.",
        "A: To be honest -- to be honest, and I ha -- I was asked qu-questions, the same\nquestions which you ask me right now. As far as I can recall, I try a lot of the time to\nrecall things from home, the normal things, until I was arrested, until I -- I came to\nAuschwitz, and I could never figure out, and I don\u2019t think I did ever actually fight for\nmy life. And actually what I had experienced, after I was liberated, I suffered more\nwhen I was liberated, and -- and I -- I am alive, than being actually in Auschwitz, and\nworking in the coal mine. Because over there you didn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t think about\nnothing else.",
        "A: Very, very bad. Very bad. I have always questioned why me. I have brothers, an\nother one have been much nicer in anything, you know, with feelings, or poor people,\nwhatever, and I, to be honest with you, I was not as smart as my brothers, you know,\nwith feelings. And this bothered me, questioned me, why did I survive?",
        "A: No, no. No, in fact, when I worked, I worked here in the same company since I\ncame here to the States, and I worked 38 years, and -- and -- in the office is\nmanagement, was a lot of Jews, but in the factory where I worked actually, was very\nfew Jews, and later when I -- in the beginning I couldn\u2019t speak English, but actually it\nwas maybe a favor for me. But later used to come people who know it a little bit about\nthe Holocaust, and the concentration camps, they used to ask me if I was mistreated, or\nif I didn\u2019t had enough food. And I always told them no, and the reason was simple. It\u2019s\nin mine character, this actually how I was raised. I hate to see that somebody has\nsympathy for me. I rather see somebody will help me, and have physical feelings, than\nsomebody will tell me he has sympathy for me because I suffered. This I cannot take.\nPains I can take it, but not this sympathy, no.",
        "A: Yeah, he was the boss, yeah, mist --",
        "A: He 1s alive. I know, more or less like friends. He treat me like in the family. On all\noccasions, Jewish holidays, if he makes anything for his family, we always on the list.\nIn his home, or in a hotel, or whatever. In fact, when I got sick, he didn\u2019t hear it from\nme -- I used to come visit the factory every few weeks. He didn\u2019t heard from me, he\ncalled home, he mentioned it right away, I know it\u2019s not right. And finally I told him\nthe story. Buti -- it cannot be a nicer person than Mr. Wolfe is.",
        "A: That\u2019s all right.",
        "A: Yeah, it -- that\u2019s right, in October, I think the 26\" of October, 1949, I arrived in\nGermany, on a military boat. The boat\u2019s name was SS General Howe. It took us 16\ndays from Bremen to touch the soil of the United States. And I remember when I was\nin Germany, | -- I worked -- I always -- I did -- I mentioned it. When I got in touch\nthat I found my brother, he 1s in Israel, and he kept on writing me letter, don\u2019t do\nfoolish things, don\u2019t play the black market. Don\u2019t do nothing, cause it\u2019s not legal, he\nwarned me. He says, \u201cYou come here, you going to have everything. You don\u2019t have\nto worry now, think about nothing. You come here.\u201d And finally, I was prepared,\nactually. I bought things -- necessary things, because in Germany I worked for the ira -\n- UNRRA. I always made fairly good money.",
        "A: Right, right. I made money, and I didn\u2019t made money, you know, just to have extra\nmoney. I made real nice, and I bought up -- if I go to Israel, to be established there,\nhave things necessary, electrical things, or whatever. And I had, I think, three cases,\nthree large cases already nailed up to go along, and I was, the last year actually, in \u201948\n-- before I was in a sanatorium, in Dagaloff, this is the outskirts of Stuttgart, a very\nbeautiful place, but later they liquidated this camp, and the Stuttgart was a camp in the\nReinspookstrasser, which is famous. I have a book they actually gave it to me, you\nknow, the whole thing, the activities, what it was, in sh -- Reinspookstrasser. And\nthere have been respectable people, and because the other [indecipherable] was\nliquidated, so they called me, and they ask me if I want to take over food supply, and\nto be in charge like a chef, they call it a boss, over there on the Reinspookstrasser. I -- I\ndidn\u2019t know, you know, to deal in black market, but I know it that I have to ha -- get a\njob. So I accepted it, and I was very respected by them, and they tried to do anything,\nwhatever possible, to satisfy me. I was [indecipherable] alone. Finally it happened one\nSunday. I was not working, but I came -- I used to live -- I lived still in Dagaloff, and I\ncame down to the Reinspookstrasser, but this was the DP camp in Stuttgart, and I\nnotice what I didn\u2019t like. I noticed that they -- they have over there, in every DP camp,\nthey have their own police. It was Jewish policemen, what been -- like you had a job,\nwhatever it was necessary to keep everything in order. And they --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: They used to take boys from 18 years, even mine age. I was at this time 26 year, 25\n-- 26 years old, and they used to |-like round them up, get them, they put them in a\nroom like a -- in a jail more or less, took them away, and the next day trucks from the\nJewish brigade come, and they took you to Bremen, whatever, to send them to Israel.\nAnd this I didn\u2019t like it.",
        "A: Involuntary, exactly. Involuntarily.",
        "A: And when I saw this, it reminded me too much of it.",
        "A: No [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- they have been told. From the -- you know, from the Israeli government, whoever\nwas, you know, that this is the only way to get the young people away from the black\nmarket, you know, just to bring them to Israel, they needed soldiers, I -- I don\u2019t know\nwhy. But when this -- I saw it then on the spot, I said, \u201cForce, that\u2019s -- it\u2019s out of the\nquestion.\u201d And then I tried to think -- I almost was ready to leave to go to Israel, and\nthen I came -- you know, when you think about this, come to you other things. And I\nknow it that my brother is not a ha -- a wealthy person, he worked for the government,\nhe had a good job, a high position, everything, but far from saying, you know, he\u2019s\nable, yes, like he wrote in the letters, you don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be taken care of,\neverything. And in -- they had already at this time, they had a boy maybe four or five\nyears old. He was born in \u00b040, actually he was six year -- no, older than this, seven,\neight years, right? Yeah, he was born in \u201940. And -- and they keep on th -- my thinking\n-- yeah, I said, \u201cIf I will come over there, you hadn\u2019t bought even a bed already, where\nI gonna sleep?\u201d He said he gonna take away from his wife, and his kid, you know, and\ntry to give it to me. And I said no, this will not work. I\u2019m not the type.",
        "A: In one way, yes, in the other way I was afraid he gonna think that he owns his life\nfor me. I got scared, I said there\u2019s no way in the world, it will not work. And then I\nfigured another thing. If I come to Israel, and Israel was a lot like my brother from my\nhome town, what that lived over there, so they knowed me, and they knowed the\nfamily. And I figured, you know, I was not -- I didn\u2019t had no trades. I was not educated\npractically, nothing. And I said whatever I going to do, you know, you should be --\nand especially you come from a small town like me, that this job is suitable for you,\nthis is your -- if in a too good home, to take a job, you know, like cleaning, I don\u2019t\nknow streets, or other thing. I said, the best thing is maybe to go to the United States,\nnobody knows me, I don\u2019t have no relatives, and I don\u2019t [indecipherable] this to be\nover there.",
        "A: And how. This was more scary, and what more was thinking -- I thought to myself,\nwhat will I do over there? I cannot speak a word of English. I don\u2019t have no trade.\nYeah, what? Again go for charities -- you know, Jewish organizations to support? I\nsaid, I\u2019m not the type for it. I -- how can I do it? But I had a friend, he left in \u201946\nalready.

I come from a good home, and to be honest,\na lot of maybe special survivors who survived will not like it. But I didn\u2019t do nothing, I\ndidn\u2019t made money in Germany, and if any girl from a better home, you know, was\nplenty boys who had a lot of money and everything. They bought them clothing,\njewelry. They took practically the -- the best of the crop, you know? Just to tell you in\nplain words. I was falling behind, and because I was raised, and how it was, and I\ndidn\u2019t want the -- to go a little bit too deep in, you know, where -- where normally -- in\nnormal circumstances, I would never be associate, so I hold myself back.

        "A: Oh, he used to live -- the first house where he had, that he lived was on Shepherd\nStreet, northwest. Was not far from Georgia Avenue, Shepherd. Sh -- I think Shepherd,\nand let\u2019s see, 12 - 13, maybe Seventh Street was Georgia Avenue. Around nine -- ninth\ns -- Ninth Street, north Shepherd, nine northwest.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, and I thought he\u2019s a king, you know. I would never expect, you know,\nthat he has such nice life, you know, he married, and he has a kid, and he has a house,\nand he has a job. In the beginning, actually, he told me if I wanted, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t\nhave to do nothing cause I tell you.\u201d But if I wanted, he can tell -- take me where he\nwas by this bookbinder. And he will ask him ahead of time if he can bring in, you\nknow, somebody, a helper, or -- I didn\u2019t know nothing about bo-bookbinding. And so\nhe took me along where he worked, and the owner was Gentile. And he was a elderly\nperson, probably in the upper 70\u2019s. But he was very, unusually nice, and friendly, and\nhe showed me things to help around over there, all kind jobs, and --",
        "A: This -- this I don\u2019t know. This I couldn\u2019t tell. But he was very, very pleased.\nWhatever he told me, I -- I tried to do it the best what a human can do, tried to please\nhim. And he recognized this, and so he right away, he had the respect, you know, that\nI\u2019m not just coming in. What had happened was over there a big [indecipherable]\nactually he paid me well, like paid me actually in 1949, about a dollar an hour, what\nthis was a -- a lot, actually, it was good money. But it got slow. I couldn\u2019t speak\nEnglish, and I was over there a day, and so he told me to clean up the supply where\nthey kept, and this probably was never cleaned. So I really did a job what nobody\nwould do, you know. [indecipherable] or not, I don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t make any\ndifference, but nobody would do it, something like this. I took everything out, and\ndusted, and I ate -- my dust choked me, but I did it. And when he came, it was clean.\nHis face was smiling, he looked at me. Tha -- si -- comple -- he didn\u2019t recognize even,\nbut it was, I cleaned it out so. And it was on -- very slow other days. I told my friend, I\nsaid, \u201cBernard, tell Mr. Gruver that I don\u2019t want that he pays me if I don\u2019t do no\nwork.\u201d If I don\u2019t work, I don\u2019t want it that he pays me money I didn\u2019t deserve. Well,\nhe went over, and told him, and he came back, and he laughed and -- and he said, \u201cOh,\ndon\u2019t worry,\u201d you know, \u201cyou'll be slow another day, it will be here plenty work for\nyou, come and work.\u201d I was over there maybe a whole week longer, and it didn\u2019t come\nin too much work, and I was still doing nothing practically, here and there something.\nSo I told him I don\u2019t want him that he pays me if I didn\u2019t work for it. And I left. And\nthen I went to the Jewish social organization, actually they used to be not far away\nfrom Shepherd Street, even over there. I forgot the street, but it was pretty close. And I\ntold them I want a -- a job. So they called up the American Wholesale where Mr.\nWolfe is. He was -- at this time, his brother-in-law -- he married to the family from the\nowners. His name was Krepshaw, David Krepshaw. And he called up them if they\nhave an opening, and they told him yes. They told me how to get there, and whatever.\nSo I went over there, they used to be located on Rhode Island Avenue, Fourth Street.\nAnd I went over there, and they had somebody, an American who is Polish descent, so\nhe -- he translated here, because I didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t speak a word of English. So right\naway, the -- the same way, whatever I did, I tried to do my best because somebody\nwould tell me to move a house, and it wouldn\u2019t be hard for me, I would probably move\nit. I did my best, and they had recognition. They saw it was right. They start right away\nto advance me. They told me that I will be a foreman, a working foreman, and they\nwill learn me cutting. Course, it\u2019s a mattress company, you know, Serta, and they will\nlearn me to be a cutter. It sound to me all right.",
        "A: No, mattress fabrics.",
        "A: For mattresses, covers.",
        "A: I was, and they assigned me the sewing room, what most of them have been women\nactually, worked over there. Well, they learned me do the cutting, and they told me all\nthe -- they start me off with 75 cents an hour. You know, he told me that s -- 75 he\ndoes only because I\u2019m in a concentration camp, you know, a refugee. Because he pays\n-- he start off the people normally, with 50 cents an hour. So he gave me 75, and -- and\nfrom time to time he told me -- he came over there, they liked 1t, what I did, whatever.\nAnd he gave me like full charge, he says, \u201cYou can work overtime in the evening. You\nwant stay, stay as long as you want. I\u2019m going to have one and a half, you know. And\nif you want come in Saturday to clean up the place, so you come in Saturday, and\nclean up the place.\u201d And I really cleaned, really, not like these other people. And I\nmade myself [indecipherable] even at 75 cents, by p-putting in extra hours. Every day\nan hour, and Saturday five, six hours. It was alright, but I never figured anyway that I\nwill stay in a factory. It was a little bit out of my line, I would never use, you know, a\nbrain thing, and I have to work for somebody. But what can you do? I -- I couldn\u2019t do\nnothing better, either, so I kept on staying here, but they kept on raising always a little\nbit here, a little bit there, this holiday. And [indecipherable] I figured I start from the\nbeginning, start again from the bottom, I don\u2019t know, so I -- I tried to stay with them.\nAnd I stayed with them until actually -- took a little while, and they made me a\nsupervisor over there, the -- the sewing room was under my charge completely. And\nthey let me do anything that I wanted to do, you know, and well, this made me feel\nbetter, too.",
        "A: Yeah, about 25 people, yeah. Men and women.",
        "A: It\u2019s not easy. But I know it, you know, if you have to do it, it doesn\u2019t make any\ndifferent.",
        "A: Yeah, I retired after 38 years, 38 years I was with the company, never worked for\nnobody else, except a couple weeks 1n the bookbinding shop where my friend\nFedderman worked.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Yeah, they have been very pleased, especially Mr. Wolfe was at this time, like a\nmanager in the division, they had other divisions, too. They used to have appliances\ndistributors.",
        "A: Wholesaler.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, American Wholesaler, because they have several divisions in -- well,\nthe management was pretty smart, very, very smart, because if one division didn\u2019t do\nbusiness, then the other division covered. And this was very well organized.",
        "A: L used to go to the Americanization school, nights, over there, and in the beginning\nI thought I will never learn. But you know, I always used public transportation, like I\nused to go with streetcar to work, and back, and always people tried [indecipherable]\nsay it, and I used to tell them I cannot speak much English, what it all, it\u2019s true, oh and\nthey made me compliments, oh you speak so good, so nice. I -- I know this was a\ncompliment, this was not the truth. But eventually, 1t took a few months, then\nsuddenly, you know, what more I tried to talk English, the more I realized I -- it\ncomes. You have just to be patient.",
        "A: Yeah, they bought another home, and it was a little bit smaller. So I moved out, I\ndid appreciate, you know, I stayed with him this time, and meanwhile, I got involved,\nyou know, I had my wife, she\u2019s actually from Stuttgart. And she was like a girlfriend,\nbut we always have been in contact with each other, we all glad to see each other.",

Nothing even -- you\nknow, I had a job what I was pleased, I was the chef in the supplies, and everything,\nbut I still was alone, you know. I di -- didn\u2019t had no relatives. I didn\u2019t have nobody,\njust some boys, you know from the concentration camp, we used to be friends, this\nwas all. And when I met her, actually, she was a -- more than just a g -- really good\nlooking girl.",

We had a date here, and there, and\nthen she invited me to her home, and right away her mother was paralyze -- par-\nparalyzed, she had a stroke. But, win -- wonderful people, real nice. Her father was\nvery much involve anti-Nazi. He was picked up, e-even was jailed, he almost went to\nDachau, the same way, for talking, you know. If you talk there too much --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no, no, isn\u2019t a Jew, but very decent people. And I come over there, I felt a little\nbit, you know, what I was missing. A home, more or less. And in fact, she used to take\ncare like even my shirts, underwear, whatever, she took it home, and washed it, and\nthey pressed it, and brought it back. They got the touch.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I was very desperately alone, no doubt about it. And when I was here, in\nthe beginning I came -- I used to go to the Jewish community center, and I used to\nmeet the Jewish girls, too. And I went out with them here and there. Was one time I\nremember I went out with a Jewish girl -- no -- yeah, it was in the Jewish community\ncenter. And we talked, and talked, and you know, it\u2019s almost was time to leave the\ncenter, and she asked -- she ask me, \u201cWhere\u2019s you car?\u201d And this right away gave me\na pretty bad feeling, an impression. I was happy I had to pay a token, not\n[indecipherable] a car. And I didn\u2019t felt right, actually. And li --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Oh, well actually, I kept on -- have more feelings from time to time. When I left\nGermany, actually, I figured I don\u2019t want to take responsibility to be married over\nthere, bring here somebody, you know, because I didn\u2019t know to -- how -- even being\nalone, how I will be able to get along. But later, I felt that I\u2019m missing, actually, I\nmissed her very much, to a great extent. And the beginning actually, they said in the\nAmericanization school, they used to help me, the principal over there, he ask me, you\nknow it, and I told him I have over there a girlfriend, she\u2019s in Germany. So he used to\nwrite to the consul about it, and especially Cy Wolfe actually, he wrote letters to the\nconsul too. And she ha -- was registered already, you know, she had a uncle here in\nLong Island that she wanted to co -- times were bad in -- in Germany, wa -- so she\nwanted to come here, so finally with the help and Cy Wolfe, well, she had a chance.\nShe came two years later. When she came here, she had -- right away she got a job,\nand she made more mon -- better than me. She worked in the House office building.",
        "A: Oh, sure. You know, she had a -- her father was a older -- I mean, elderly person.\nYou know [indecipherable] stayed because they have to take care of their parents. Her\nmother was paralyzed, and everything.",
        "A: Yeah, she had one sister, and she was 18 years older than her, you know, she had a\n-- one sister. But in the beginning they didn\u2019t like it that she leaves, but eventually --\nyou know, her mother knowed me, and everything, and she thought with somebody\nelse that she wouldn\u2019t know it, she wouldn\u2019t let her go. But because she knowed me,\nso she agreed, you know, that she can go.",
        "A: I wrote this to mine brother, and -- about it, and he answered me, he said in -- you\nknow, we are from a strict Orthodox family, he wrote me this letter, as much suffering\nI had to go through, I can do whatever I feel, he feels, you know, that it will be\njustified [indecipherable]. And then when she came here, actually, I got in touch --\nwhat do they call them? The -- the Hebrew congregat -- you know, the Reform\nsynagogue, actually. And I met over there sh -- he was assistant rabbi, Rabbi Schiff, I\ndon\u2019t know if he\u2019s still alive. He was teaching in the -- I think Harvard School, too, as\na professor, you know, a nice person, he was from Germany. And I met him, and\nRabbi Gerstenfeld too, you know, he was the main rabbi. And Rabbi Schiff married us,\nactually, in there.",

        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, constantly, you know. We write [indecipherable] she right away,\nsecond week she came, she went, took a job, actually.",
        "A: No, but she did all this -- a -- a lot of -- she did typing, and typing actually, this for\nher -- she was trained in Germany. In Germany, actually, if you are trained, you know\nwhat you are doing, too.",
        "A: It\u2019s not here. And [indecipherable] respected her work, actually, he liked it very\nmuch. And she had a chance, because she typed the whole day, which she learned\n[indecipherable] coming home, you know, watch TV. Yeah, she didn\u2019t go to the\nAmer-Americanization school, I did.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t speak good English today, but I still am speaking.",
        "A: Oh, in the beginning was pretty hard life. I mean, we didn\u2019t had nothing, but we\ndidn\u2019t felt, you know, that it will not be hard. We both shared. She was working, and I\nwas working, and tried to save. And the reason for saving was not so much that I liked\nto save to get -- to put a lot of things was I wanted, and fe -- and have feelings that I\ncannot afford to satisfy this, but I know it can come a time when are -- you are not able\nany more to do work, whatever it is, and you fall -- want to fall a burden or nothing.\nBut this was mine strongest point for the -- that it is necessary to save. When the time\ncomes that I cannot afford, that my health does not allow me, that I still have to look\nfor my savings to support me. And we actually, this way, thanks God with savings, we\ngot adjusted to a nice life, not to waste, or not what -- what it was necessary. So we did\nsome saving. And I\u2019m proud to say, actually, that since I was involved with the\nHolocaust museum, and I was -- I felt that the museum is a great institution for -- not\nonly for survivors, but for human -- humanity, for everyone. And I never dreamed that\nI will -- we will be able to afford to contribute, but thanks God we did contribute\nhundred thousand dollars to the Holocaust museum. This, at least, makes me proud of\nmyself.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I think so, too.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s the best institution, actually. It\u2019s a safeguard for the next generations.",
        "A: Yes, she has -- she actually accepted the Jewish faith, actually.",
        "A: She was very cooperative, actually. She had feelings, you know, to follow myself,\nso we never had any complications. Even we have not been the same faith, in the\nbeginning, but she accepted to follow me.",
        "A: Right. Yeah, this is true, but like I mentioned, actually, I had bad experience when I\nhad a friend to me what -- she was devoted to me, and this -- and I miss her very much,\nso this makes a strong friendship, and this why actually I was waiting until she had a\nchance to come over here, and to share a life together, that we do share, because we\nhave been married in \u201952. It\u2019s actually 47 years actually are married.",
        "A: Unfortunately, my wife was one time pregnant, but we didn\u2019t have the experience,\nyou know, how to be careful, whatever, in the pregnancy. She had a miscarriage, and it\nupset us both, but in the other hand, it didn\u2019t change our life, either, actually. I always\nfigured, if something doesn\u2019t go our way, we have to accept it, because we never look\n-- she was trying to get medical help, and everything, but it didn\u2019t succeed, and so\nfinally we gave it up, to take it as it comes.",
        "A: No, it was not our intention. We wanted, actually, very bad. In the beginning, the\nfirst years, we couldn\u2019t afford to have it. We didn\u2019t feel, well 1f we gonna bring in a\nlife, and we have hardship to survive, but we always figured, when the time get better,\nwe save a little bit more, then we start it. And then we started, and it was too late, or\nwhatever it is, 1t just did not materialize.",
        "A: About religion, as I mentioned before, I was raised Orthodox, and I always felt in\nmy heart that the Jewish religion is the only practically religion, that you can believe in\nit, it has a ground to -- to believe in it. I -- b-but I respect any religion. I respect any\nperson who can hold up his custom, his religion, I respect very much. I am right -- no |\nam not a particular -- I wouldn\u2019t call myself I\u2019m a religious person, but I am very\ntraditional. In the past I remember the nice holidays, [indecipherable] and other things,\nin a clean, nice life. And I still try, you know, to resume those things. And to be honest\n[indecipherable] I was asked by kids in the school, and I lecture to them about the\nHolocaust, and they ask me if I believe in God. To answer this, it\u2019s very hard. In one\nway, it\u2019s pretty hard to believe, if --",
        "A: Yes. To answer you straight, what -- what the Jewish people -- nation, suffered, it\u2019s\nactually hard to believe in God, but I take mine whole strength in to believe, and I\u2019m\nnot so highly educated to be able to say that -- to believe, or not to believe, though I\nacc -- I accept that the easiest thing actually to believe, and continue believing.",
        "A: More or less. To tell the truth, more or less I follow it, and I enjoy it, but we don\u2019t\nrun constantly to the synagogue, but on the high holidays, we always attend the\nServices.",
        "A: Oh sure, it\u2019s important, actually, when -- I cannot lie, because I don\u2019t have nobody\nleft. And so friendship is actually the most what we still have left over. I continue to be\nin friendly terms with old friends [indecipherable] around here. I feel I\u2019m blessed that\nwe have friends.",
        "A: Excuse me.",
        "A: More or less, yes, but we have a -- a lot of friends, you know, they\u2019re not been\nsurvivors, and a lot of Gentile families, what are very nice people, and decent people,\nand we enjoy very much to spend time with them together.",
        "A: As far as I know -- it\u2019s a very good question, but for me it\u2019s actually easy to answer\nit. They are up there, I think, my whole family, all brothers and sisters, how we have\nbeen raised by our parents. My parents, especially my father was very strict in\nbehaving, but I\u2019m really thankful for his -- that he raised us in a strict way, that I can\nhave the -- to understand, and to know the difference between good and bad. And we\nhave been raised -- and I think all my brothers know in our family, have been more or\nless actually, raised the right way, and to respect where we supposed to respect. And I\nfeel that I was blessed with a family like this.",
        "A: It\u2019s no doubt any survivor, I don\u2019t care who it is, who had to go through so much\nhumiliation, and suffering, and taking away the dignity from being a human being, if\nwe want it, or we don\u2019t want it, something is missing in us, and -- and I mean not in\nmyself, but in any survivor. And this can never be fulfilled, even if you are successful\nin business, and family life, and everything, always will come to haunt you about your\npast, about your suffering. But in other hand, I accept it, the philosophy, if I want it, I\ndon\u2019t want it, I have to go on with my life, either way. If I think too much about my\npast, and those all good things what I lost, is the only way to bury myself alive, not to\nknow. But the -- so long I keep on continuing with my life, I have to be strong enough\nto take life and accept life as it comes.\nask that question because I know that you\u2019ve given interviews like this in latter years,\nbut not -- not earlier.",
        "A: The same thing, actually. As much that I remember those old horror stories, and\nthey can never be told, but not a human being, I -- but my past from the suffering, but I\nhave always thinking, not of a great deal about future success, but accept life how it\ncomes. And I think this holds me going the way how I do.",
        "A: Yeah, with my wife, I always discussed, and I always used to tell her. And she was\ntrying to protect me, like for example when it used to come the worst horror stories,\nand documentary on TV, she was trying, and not succeeded that I shouldn\u2019t watch it.\nBut for some reason, I tried never to miss nothing. And to be honest, when people --\nstrange people, or friends even, who were not -- had those horrible experience from\nbeing in a concentration camp, I watched them constantly, and -- and most of the time,\nI don\u2019t know why, this is actually, it\u2019s a sickness, I hardly was moved by it. I felt I\u2019m\nmore like a piece metal, a stone. But now in -- nothing ca -- can move me, actually to\nthose old, horrible memories from the past.",
        "A: I accepted that I cannot choose my life -- things what is coming to what is not\ncoming. I lost everything, the best and the dearest. I lost everything. And then I\nactually made up my mind, and realized that this is only a way not to complain, and\nnot to think too much about it, but you cannot forget, but to keep on going, as long as\npossible with my life I had, and take it as 1t comes.",
        "A: No, I never was a political person, and I realize, you know, even if you want get\ninvolved, you cannot change. You have to accept how it comes, and I didn\u2019t have no\nproblem, actually, in accepting, and behaving myself, actually, to be a good citizen,\nand to obey all rules, whatever a citizen should obey. I -- I cannot give you much more\nabout this, than those things. I try to be the right way. See a lot of things -- 1n every\ncountry, and the United States is not an exception, it\u2019s good things, and bad things, but\nyou still have to obey, as a good citizen, the law of in the land.",
        "A: Sure, I felt discrimination. I remember in 1953, when we had been married -- or in\n\u00b052, and at this time went out to get an apartment. We lived in a furnished room, we\nlived in [indecipherable] an apartment, so finally we decided that we -- we going to get\nan apartment, buy our own furniture, establish our own. And the first experience was\nwe looked at an apartment, and we liked it over there, and when I made an\nappointment with the lady, the owner, and I came in, and she asked me questions, so\nshe realized that I am Jewish, and I\u2019m not an American, cause I couldn\u2019t speak good\nEnglish yet, and actually she refused to rent it me. But this didn\u2019t discourage me, and I\nwas not mad. I felt this 1s her apartment, she -- and she has hundred percent, full right,\nto choose to whom she rented, yes or no, I never -- I -- I didn\u2019t feel I was discriminated\nbecause she didn\u2019t want to rent me the apartment.",
        "A: I da -- I don\u2019t think it will change. You cannot force nobody to love you, to like\nyou, or to do whatever. Some people have their own way, and I feel they have their\nright to do their own judgment, and even without in-interference from a government or\nforce you to rent to the person even if you don\u2019t like it. I feel this what a free country\nshould be. If you are the owner of it, you have any right to choose who want to rent\nyour apartment, and not be told by the law -- you know, but the government, he has to\n-- you have to rent them. If he doesn\u2019t want it, there\u2019s plenty other apartments.",
        "A: No more or less -- I never had any. In fact, I used to socialize with Gentile people\nin America, and they didn\u2019t have to go through a Holocaust, and most of the time I\nbehaved with good manners, and this how -- I behaved how I was raised to behave to\nbe among people. And I got always the biggest respect. The other people who hardly\nknow me, and they always respect me, and they wanted to socialize with me.",
        "A: Yeah, it was anti sentiment, and -- during the war, and you cannot blame them, I\nthink it\u2019s a good things, actually. Because whatever the world did anything, had\nfeelings about German brutality, that it was more than justified. And I actually\ncouldn\u2019t see that Germany, whatever they did it, I don\u2019t say everybody, but wa -- the\nmajority -- and they didn\u2019t know it, and they claim they didn\u2019t know it, but they did\nknow it and everything, should deserve to have it [indecipherable] the nicest life.\n[indecipherable] Europe actually, was in Germany. But normally things like this, it\nwill happen if you want it, or you don\u2019t want it, but if you don\u2019t make an issue of it, it\njust goes away.

And then you really -- you can increase anti-Semitism. I was\nalways in my vi -- my thinking, 1f somebody doesn\u2019t like me, I going to have nothing\nagainst this person, he doesn\u2019t have to like me, and I will find somebody else who will\nlike me.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, not -- not -- nothing, I mean, I don\u2019t like to be imposed, or to -- 1f somebody to\nyou 1s imposing, you know, to like you, or whatever -- I don\u2019t go for it, no. I think if it\ndoesn\u2019t come freely from you inside, it will never get the person the knowledge I -- to\n-- to change. They only change if you show your respect, that somebody doesn\u2019t want\nyou, just leave him go, that\u2019s all. Not particular fighting.",
        "A: This was in Poland [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no, it was impossible. No, this was impossible, and in fact, even I worked in\nthe coal mine, we have been with Poles, Gentiles, together always, but it was not\nallowed, apparently, and never had a chance even to hear news, or even to look in a\npiece -- a newspaper piece, or even what it was months or years old. No, we never\nknowed much. We know it only -- in the camp we used to have feelings, if they treated\nus bad, beatings, or really torturing, well, we felt this a good things, that they have\nlosses on the front. This -- this was our policy, you know, to know what is going on.\nWhen they have been nice to us, we felt they have too many successes on the front.\nWe like rather to suffer, and to be humiliated by the guards, and beaten by the guards,\nkicked by the guards; then we had hope that maybe a change can be soon. But we\nnever expect to be free people, or be in -- humans any more, anyway, but this gave us\nsome hope that eventually, sometimes, that maybe will be a survivor. You never figure\nthat I will be the survivor.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I mean, this was the truth, actually. Yeah we -- you -- you get used, and\nyou realize, you know, when they treat you bad, that they have losses on the front. The\nfront didn\u2019t go bad, and we never made any mistakes, and this was true. Sooner or\nlater some of the conversation with guards, actually, what has not been too nasty, and\nthen we realized they had big losses, and we realized why th-they treated the inmates\nso bad. [indecipherable] discuss the policy, this was the newspaper, how we have been\ntreated.",
        "A: In 1945, [indecipherable] liberated, 1f anybody who could walk, or move around,\nwhatever, the only thing what we as -- as survivors in camps, we only thought about,\nyou know, how to get food. And another that you -- you are able, if you feel hungry,\nthat you can slice a slice of bread, and eat as much as you wanted. Otherwise the\nwhole world didn\u2019t exist yet, and our -- we still have been numb like you mentioned it,\nnumbness. We have been numb, we didn\u2019t come to realization that we survived, and\nwe are humans, and we had to go on as a human being. No, we never had anything\nelse to think, only about hunger was about all.",
        "A: It -- it\u2019s not a pleasant things. We used to get a ration of bread, where we used to\ndiscuss with each other, what -- how is the best thing to digest the ration? To eat up,\nand make you feel that you satisfied your hunger, or take a bite now, and save it, and\ntake a bite later? This -- we always have discussion what is the best. But a lot of times\nwe realized if you don\u2019t eat it up, you never know somebody will steal from your\npocket, or when you go to bed you have been hiding, somebody steal away, so you\ndidn\u2019t -- never satisfied, y -- and you don\u2019t -- cannot expect to get a ra -- other things,\nactually, wherein normally, 99 percent -- I was among those 99 percent, when we got a\nration, we had a chance, we ate what we got, and we didn\u2019t had no worries to save it,\nto keep it in a safe place, or whatever.",
        "A: Not about fancy food, never had any fantasies, we just had fantasies how to satisfy\nthe hunger. Not suffering.",
        "A: Yes, still today. I cannot see waste of food whatsoever. I myself, where we live we\nhave extra acreage, and | have a -- a large garden, and I have the garden, thanks God,\nnot for income, whatever, I can afford buy seeds, or whatever labor it\u2019s involved. It\ncosts me money, and whenever I have to harvest, I just hated to see that anything goes\nto waste, at home, or in the garden, cause a lot of times, 1f nobody comes to pick up\nsome vegetables from the garden, I will go out of my way, and even travel hundred\nmiles around trip, to give some friends from the garden. This hurt me, to see food go to\nwaste hurt me very, very much, and this will never change.",
        "A: Not only about security very much, the land means for me actually that since I\nretired -- I\u2019m already 10 years retired, that I don\u2019t sit on a chair, just keep on resting. I\nalways loved to work, and physical work even when it\u2019s hard for me to be more\nphysical, I still love it, and I do it, and I think this keeps me alive.",
        "A: Actually, some work even in the coal mine, their heaviest work. This is like being a\nhuman, actually. If you see you accomplish, even for your biggest enemy, it give you\nsatisfactory. If you could accomplish -- if you have been able to do it, where actually,\nif you work, the satisfactory is larger than the hard work.",
        "A: This is a very hard to answer, but one thing actually. When I was liberated in\nTheresienstadt, this was probably the end of April, or beginning of May, in *45, and I\nwas so sick and ill actually, what I never expect to be alive, and I never saw a doctor,\nwhatever, to check me if I\u2019m healthy or I\u2019m sick, until I came to Prague,\nCzechoslovakia where they accepted me in a sanitortum. This was the first time a\ndoctor examined me and check whatever they -- the sanitorium over there, the\nmanagement, they strictly took in only DP\u2019s, Displaced Persons who had been in a\nconcentration camp. And they treated us -- royalty is maybe the proper word to say.\nAnd the first medical doctor, he examined me, and he examined me, he told me that I\nhave an enlarged heart. Even without knowing any medical terms, or whatever, I don\u2019t\nknow, I just happened to be that I asked this doctor, \u201cWill this stay with me forever?\u201d\nAnd he said in medical terms, it\u2019s hard to tell. Sometime, if you live a normal life, it\ngoes back to normality, it will disappear, and a lot of times it\u2019s will stay with you your\nwhole life. So far, thanks God, I felt if I worked physical, it helps me to stay alive,\nmore or less. So I continually -- my doctor told me that fairly I\u2019m in good shape, and\nwhatever you do, he told me not to change the formula, keep on doing the same thing.\nAnd well, I\u2019m doing it.",
        "A: I\u2019m interested, and I follow it, but I know not me even, because popular people,\nwhat know the politics and everything, it\u2019s politics, to be honest, personally, I think\nit\u2019s a dirty trade. Nobody\u2019s honest. Very rarely you can find somebody who tells you\nthe truth, whatever. This how I feel. And in the other hand, as a little, ordinary person,\nyou cannot change those things, either, so you just let them go.",
        "A: We showed you actually, that the -- not people, but countries, and I hate to criticize\nthe United States, United States did a great deal for me, whatever, and -- and I -- I feel\nthat I try my best to be a good citizen, actually, but on the other hand, you read about\nthe past, and you call it a world of civilization. In the whole world -- I don\u2019t want to\nmention name, but this is including the United States, where I\u2019m a citizen, and I try to\nbe a honest, good citizen, that the whole world could stand by and see those horror,\nbrutalities -- I don\u2019t have the proper word to mention about it, and I don\u2019t think the\ndictionary has even the proper words. And I don\u2019t think you can express the proper\nwords to -- to express about those past, and doing nothing, this actually, you lose the\nbelief in any civilization. There\u2019s a part of me, it\u2019s hard for me to believe that a\ncivilized world exists.",
        "A: To me, actually, you know, trusting or not trusting, it\u2019s har -- very hard to trust\npeople in general, but you feel more trusted when you come along to a Holocaust\nsurvivors, what they had the same experience as me, and then I realize they\nunderstand. But a average person, if you\u2019re Jewish or Gentile, 1t doesn\u2019t make any\ndifferent to me. But I realize right now, after 50 years, being more or less a normal\nperson, that it\u2019s hard to believe that it was so much suffering for those people who\nhave been in concentration camps. And -- and even somebody would say, you know, it\nnever existed, it\u2019s just a hoax. A lot of times I -- I feel I\u2019m not mad about it, but I feel\nas a normal person, with normal thinking, you have to believe it\u2019s a hoax, it\u2019s not true.",
        "A: Th -- th -- exactly.",
        "A: It\u2019s unbelievable, I mean, this is the proper word. A lot of times I will in po -- in ger\n-- in English, and hard to express me the proper words, but like you said, it\u2019s\nunbelievable, in the same way, with as much as you talk, or videos you interview, but\nthe true story will never come out. And I hope that we never come to a point where the\ntrue stories of new sufferings comes.",
        "A: I can talk as much as possible for me. I mean, those things you don\u2019t forget\nactually. I was actually, when I came to Auschwitz at this time, being Jewish was 100\npercent impossible to s -- to live a day or two. Gentiles who come to Auschwitz in \u201941,\na maximum, I would say, you know, you could live a day or two, and because the\nhorrors were so great, was impossible. But in my case, actually, in fact this is actually\nwhy I survived; I was in Auschwitz only -- direct in Auschwitz, I was only one day.\nThe second day the Germans needed real bad -- around Auschwitz 1s a lot of coal\nmines, and they needed real bad people to go to the mines, but they didn\u2019t trust Poles,\nwho came to -- to Auschwitz actually, because you have to work with Poles, civilian\nPoles in the mine, they smuggle you out, or whatever, so they never took Poles to the\nmine. The only who they took to the mines was Jewish, or Germans -- not Jew --\nGermans we -- we were -- who have been the same way, have been prisoners in the\ncamps. And the second day, actually, the same eight people who wa -- we have been\nstepped out being Jewish, we have been called again to be on the appelleplatz. And we\ncame back, and a doctor came in Auschwitz, and we have been in Auschwitz, a doctor\ncame and told us to take off our clothing, and everything, and examined us, our health,\nour -- and then he said, \u201cYou going to be sent to Yavishavitz,\u201d and Yavishavitz was a\ncoal mine camp. And this was a brand new camp, and at this time when we went to\nYavishavitz, we couldn\u2019t believe it that we are in Auschwitz. Even Yavishavitz was a\nsubcamp of Auschwitz. But it was no kapos, we have not been mistreated too bad. And\nthe director from the coal mine came, and he spoke to us, and he says he\u2019s only\ninterested in one thing, this 1s to be good workers in the mine. And he promised us if\nwe will behave, we will do good work in the mine, he will look into it that we are not\nmistreated, and we will be getting proper food. We\u2019ll be able -- I was night shift, and\nhe said, we -- you'll be able to sleep during the day. And in the beginning, was\nactually true everything, it was not so terrible, I mean, you could survive. The only\nthing was the hard work in the mine, but I used to talk to the one that was in charge in\nthe mine, he was a Pole, and I used to ask him how long can you live in the mine? He\nsaid, \u201cOh, people work here 20 and 25 years.\u201d And he told me you can survive you\nworking in the mines. And he showed me how to hold the shovel proper, what is\nactually -- make it much easier to work on it. And it was good until actually, til \u00b042,\nwhen they start with Jewish transport. And then when they start with Jewish transport,\nthey had so many people -- Jewish people, actually, and the most highly intelligent\npeople fen Germany, French, Poland, Belgium, Italy. They come, they\u2019ve been\nprofessional doctors, professors, very high tech people, and they send them in the\nmine, they last a day or two, this was all. And they looked only a way how to dispose\npeople. They didn\u2019t look any more for workers, because they had too many of them. In\nthe camp when I came to Yavishavitz was maybe 300 people. When the Jewish\ntransport come, the -- in the same camp, in the same barracks, they had 3000. And\nactually every week, used to come a truck in the crematoriums in Auschwitz, and\npicked up those who broke down. It didn\u2019t took too long, actually for people, highly\nintelligent people to break down. I don\u2019t know even it took a week, took days. They all\ngot to the point of not being able any more to work, and -- and the rule of the camp,\nespecially in Auschwitz was, if you are not able to work, you don\u2019t have a right to live,\nand so you -- they automatically -- you know it, if you cannot work, you go to the\ncrematoriums.",
        "A: Survive longer.",
        "A: Exactly. It\u2019s exactly this, the full truth. Number one, you know, I was in the 20\u2019s,\nand I was fairly healthy, and even at home, you know, I\u2019m raised in a home, even we\nhad the -- and enough money and everything, you know, being this 20 year old boy, to\nenjoy life, maybe I been raised really restricted, that the same way is nothing, just run\naround, you have to do to get the feeling and understanding if you are a human being,\nalive, you have to perform something. It doesn\u2019t mean anything but physical work. If\nyou read books, was okay with my parents, but doing nothing was not all right. So I\nwas used, actually, to let -- not coal mine labor, but I still was used to keep myself\nbusy --",
        "A: -- and to do work. And later, when actually I came to Yavishavitz and worked in\nthe coal mine, and somebody explained me how to manage to have it easier, this\nhelped me a great deal, and this actually -- this made me survive. Later on actually,\nyou know, when Jewish transport came, everything finished, but they used to get the\nrations for 300 people, it\u2019s 3000. It was just too bad, you know, those rations have\nbeen distributed among 3000 people. And it started getting rougher and rougher and\nrougher. They didn\u2019t even looked any more for labors, for good labors, they just\nlooked how to dispose those people who -- without a bullet, without the crematorium.\nThis how it went on all the time.",
        "A: Yeah, exactly. Brand new, practically. The ausch -- when I came in \u201941, was only\nexisted -- I don\u2019t think a year old even, less than a year old, practically, yeah.",
        "A: I be honest, I mean from the beginning we didn\u2019t know it, actually, what had\nhappened. Later we heard stories a little bit from here, and from there, and then we\nrealized what 1s going on. And automatically we know it, you know, like our parents\ndidn\u2019t had a chance, you know. We know it, they have been destroyed in the\ncrematorium before we even -- if you have been young age, you know, between 18\nand 30, you had a chance maybe, they put you in for working, that you will work. But\nthings actually, to thinking about the Germans, they have been so organized,\neverything. People who read the past about concentration camps, they think it\u2019s just\ncame by accident. It didn\u2019t come by accident. I realized now even, you know, before\nwhen I was there, I didn\u2019t think about it, but now I can recall, and I realize that\neverything was so planned. As soon as you come to Auschwitz, they took away your\nidentity, you didn\u2019t had a name any more. You been like a dog, you got a tag, a\nnumber, and you wear uniform, and they don\u2019t call you anything no more, and they --\nthey call you -- they call you by the number. I remember even myself, when I got the\nnumber --",
        "A: Yeah -- no, I didn\u2019t -- was not tattooed when I came to Auschwitz, I was a political\nprisoner, so my clothing went in a bag like any other person. I was photographed I\ndon\u2019t know how many times, several time, you know, turn your head and bumps here\nand there. And -- and another thing, whoever was documented -- they called us, you\nknow, like we come from a prison, and we came, they have document, you know, like\nthe transport had a list. You know, some kept the list, and some throw it away the list,\nbecause know it -- they know it --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: Yeah, and being a document, I don\u2019t know why -- why they have been afraid, those\nSS or Gestapo. Normally, as a rule in every camp like a -- I mean, I can tell only where\nI was in Yavishavitz, that had they called it a ravia, it was like first aid. You know, I\nmean, sickness didn\u2019t exist, I never heard in a camp that somebody got sick. Not\n[indecipherable] you never heard of it. Oh, you dropped dead, so -- a -- a normal thing,\nactually, that\u2019s all. But sick, this didn\u2019t exist. I never was sick. Neither other thou --\nother thousands that is, but if you went in for some help, in this ravia, there are\ndoctors, you know, they all have been prisoners, also haftlinger, and okay, they kept\nyou til one night. If yo -- the other day, you have not been able to go out -- go to y -- to\nthe coal mine, or other commanders what they have working commanders, if you have\nnot been able to go, th-then, 1t was no more time left, so the next day come a truck\nfrom the crematorium and picked you up, and -- and this was the end, or so you -- this\nmore or less, everybody was afraid to go in the [indecipherable] been sick.",
        "A: Oh, this is a -- with the last strength, whatever you had. I remember one time, he\nwas from -- from Bendine, Paul Oberslazin, more or less, a Jewish middle aged, he\nwas much older than me. He must have been in the late 40\u2019s. And every second week,\nI think, there used to come from Auschwitz a doctor -- and you have been told to take\noff your clothes, and -- and he examined you, he looked at your body, how your -- how\nyour are with your health or whatever. Not examined, but he just looked at the body.\nAnd normally what they looked is on the --",
        "A: -- bottom, like, yeah. And if it was in, you know, you\u2019re not been out --",
        "A: The bottom got in.",
        "A: Well, they called it a musselman.",
        "A: And they said --",
        "A: Musselman, yeah. This meant that you\u2019re not capable to work.",
        "A: M-Malnourished, or whatever, you\u2019re not capable to work, and they put you -- took\nyour number off, and they put you on the list, and the next day the wagon come from\nthe crematorium, and they have to go. At this time, because I was over there, one from\nthe oldest prisoners, inmates, and you know, you\u2019re always have been already prefare -\n- pre -- you know, prepared, actually -- more privileged than a regular person, you\nknow, they know it. I was over there in \u00b041, you know, so everybody looked me. And\none time I had a chance o -- the one who took the -- put down the numbers, the same\nway, you have been forced to put down the number on the list, whatever they have to\nknow it. I know him, I was with him together. So he came over to me, he knowed me\nby name, he called me with -- by name, he says, \u201cPlease help me.\u201d And he was on the\nlist to -- I don\u2019t remember even his name. He says, \u201cI\u2019m a rich man, you know. I have\na lot of wealth, and everything. I\u2019d do anything in the world if you can save my life.\u201d I\ntold him, \u201cHow can I save your life?\u201d He says, \u201cSee that they take me off in the list.\u201d\nAnd nobody dared to do things like this, you know. Anyway --",
        "A: He couldn\u2019t -- he saw I cannot help him, so he tried -- for some reason he smuggled\nhimself in to the day commander, you know, who march to the coal mine. He\nsmuggled himself in -- they counted always, they saw it, they know how many people\nthey have to send to the mine, how many. If it was too many, they -- they didn\u2019t let out\nnobody, they waited until they got straight. I don\u2019t know how he did it, but he did it, he\nsmuggled himself, and he went in the coal mine. You know what those beasts did?\nWhen the wagon came, he picked up those all from the list, and they saw he was\nmissing, and apparently wherever they realize, you know, they had a plus, and they\nknowed exactly in which mine he is, whatever. They took the wagon -- the truck, and\nthey went in the mine, they brought him up to the -- in the mine, and took him to the\ncrematorium. This how a -- and you know what else, how accurate they have been,\nhow planned everything was? This 1s unbelievable. As little they fed us, but -- but it\nbelonged, you know, for every prisoner, a ration of bread, if you got a hundred grams,\n200 grams, whatever, this -- they have been responsible, this belongs to you. They\nhave those people on the truck, and they gave everyone a ration, what it belonged. He\nstill was alive, and so he was entitled to the ration. They gave him the ration. This\nhow, you know, [indecipherable] comes to me how well everything was organized.\nAnd whatever it came, it didn\u2019t come just happening, you know? Everything was\nplanned.",
        "A: It\u2019s a little bit more than evil.",
        "A: It\u2019s a little bit more. And they -- the first step in the Nazis was actually when you\ncame to a camp, they dehumanize you. They took away whatever you could. The\nphysical, and then they went mentally, and they realized the only way, you know, they\nwill not give you enough food, and so your brain cannot think nothing else except\nfood. And then they con -- control you, they don\u2019t have to afraid that somebody will\nrun away, or somebody will stand up, you know, and say I\u2019m getting killed anyway, I\nkill a -- a -- a guard, or whatever. It didn\u2019t make any different. They know that the next\nhour he will get killed, so what\u2019s the different? But they took everything away what a\nhuman being have inside in him. And then they know it, we will follow all this, and\neverything what they ask. They don\u2019t have to watch you, even. And this was\neverything planned, you know.",
        "A: Exactly, broken is the proper word. Yeah, they broke down you completely.",
        "A: Physical because you have to work hard, and they don\u2019t give you enough food. This\nthey broke right away, this was easy. Mentally was a little bit harder, but if they keep\non breaking little bit and little bit, then mentally you lose everything, too.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: [indecipherable] in general, actually, even if I can\u2019t afford, I just like being too\nmuch comfortable, a luxury. Even if I can\u2019t afford, I just -- I feel suffering a little bit\nrelease in -- in myself, you know, that I\u2019m survived. Even if I go to a doctor, you\nknow, doctors trying to give you -- I never want to take medicine, everything, and\nwhenever it comes to anesthetic, I tell the doctor, don\u2019t worry, pains I can take, you\ndon\u2019t have to worry. They have me all on record, Morris refused to take medication, or\nsomething to relieve pains. Yeah, they have me on the record [indecipherable] and this\nhow actually I -- I feel actually, if I suffer, it feels me a little bit release from the\npressure what I lost.

If you want it, or you don\u2019t\nwant it, it will surface. If it doesn\u2019t surface hundred percent, it surface 50 percent, 60\npercent. But just to ignore it, no way.",
        "A: Probably, yes it is.",
        "A: All my family, and feeling the love, that I was loved. And we, all kids, all of our\nbrothers and sister, we had sense enough respect our family, and try to give back our\nlove the same what their love was to us.

I just don\u2019t feel proper.",
        "A: Yeah. I -- I never believed, and I never expected to material things, actually, until I\ncome to the United States, and then I realized if you have money, you treat it better, y -\n- and anyway -- and I saw I missed the boat.

        "A: Yeah, this is mostly, actually, people. People who didn\u2019t had [indecipherable]\nnothing, you know, had been poor and everything. And they looked out, and they\nsucceeded. It was a chance, this was the only chance after the war to succeed. If you\nmissed, you missed the boat.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: What, the can?",
        "A: Oh, this was in the camp all the time. I mean, in Auschwitz, we was more\norganized actually.

But later, in the later camps,\nactually, in Buchenwald, where you have been in [indecipherable] was so filthy and\ndirty, I never had a -- another shirt when I left Auschwitz til actually I was liberated,\nyou know. And I mentioned actually in the tape to -- we didn\u2019t have no water, you\ncouldn\u2019t wash yourself actually. The same way it was just organized to make your life\nso miserable actually, that you will give up life, and this what did happen, this was\ntrue.",

        "A: No, never [indecipherable]",
        "A: Never had anything. I know it one thing, that counseling will not help, you have to\nhave the strength to help yourself. I never believed it -- too much in the counseling.",
        "A: I tried to go back.",
        "A: It was 30 kilometers from my hometown, and I came by train over there, and I\nfigured, because I had brothers -- I was the youngest, but I still had brothers that had\nbeen pretty young, and my oldest sister had three kids already. The oldest girl was at\nthis time -- before \u201939, she was probably 11 years old. In \u201945 she was 17. And I figured\nmaybe because we had been respected by Gentile people, too, you know, maybe\nthey\u2019re -- somebody hid them, or wherever. I had hope that I find somebody. I --\nparents we didn\u2019t dream, we know what had happened, so we -- we gave up\nautomatically, but -- but the brothers and sisters, we always had any hope. And as soon\nI was able to walk in Theresienstadt, I took a train, and traveled to the home, to the\nnearest hometown -- like I mentioned, we didn\u2019t have the railroad station. The closest\nrailroad station was Rodonsko. And I got off in Rodonsk, and I ask those people, any\nJew survivors? They -- they didn\u2019t s -- know it exactly, whoever I ask, I don\u2019t\nremember, even. So they told me the only way is you have to go out on the road and\nsee where -- if the road leads n -- to Chadbush, be there, and just ask to take you along.\nIt was no -- at this time was not too many cars, a car was a novelty, very hardly saw it.\nWe saw buses, maybe, to take passengers, but the most -- the other way was by horse\nand buggy. And I went on the road, and stood over there, and suddenly see somebody\nwith the horse and buggy comes, and I looked, and his face looked familiar to me. So\nfinally, what closer he got, the more I could see who it was, and I called him by his\nname. Bentkofsky was his name. I said, \u201cBentkofsky.\u201d And he looked, and looked, and\nhe stopped the horse [indecipherable] and looked at me. And he says, in Polish, \u201cT1\nZheerz?\u201d It means, you are alive? You know? And I realize how he greet me. And\nthen, you know, then he ask me if I know that those eight people who survived not the\ncamp, who survived, they have been hidden somewhere, whatever, that they all have\nbeen killed. They lived all Jewish home, and they all have been killed. I didn\u2019t know\nnothing, this was the first time. He told me about it.",
        "A: He told me the name, and I knowed every one of them, whoever they told me. And\nI got really hysterical. I start to cry, and -- and I told him in Polish, I spoke in Polish.\nAnd I said, \u201cYou know why I went through Auschwitz. I didn\u2019t go as a Jew.\u201d He know\nit probably, because he wa -- he worked 1n the factory, you know, like I told you, he\nused to carry finished merchandise to be shipped. He took it to the railroad\n[indecipherable] he was -- he knows me, and the family. He knows everything about it.\nI said, \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t go to Auschwitz as a Jew.\u201d",
        "A: As a Pole, yeah, political reasons. Probably he know it about the factory with the\ndouble bookkeeping, cause that was in. And I was so moved, I couldn\u2019t take it any\nmore. I think I spit on him. I didn\u2019t know what to do, what not to do, but I think it this\nwas I did. And then came out a woman, was near a building also, and she came out\nand I -- she must have been -- told me that she was Jewish -- she is Jewish too. And\nshe ask me what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s happened. She saw me, I was crying. I told her the\nstory. She said, \u201cPlease, one thing. You cannot go back to Chadbush. Go to Lodz,\nWarsaw, larger town. Over there goes some Jewish people, you meet survivors, not\nsurvivors. Go over there more or less you safe. But the Chadbush,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\ndon\u2019t go to Chadbush, no way in the world.\u201d And she told me about the same thing.",
        "A: Because [indecipherable] for my life.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Exactly. And she figured, you know, I thought actually I come over there, and\nmaybe I stay in Poland. I didn\u2019t had nobody in any country, relatives or not, where\nshould I go? I was born over there, we had houses over there.",
        "A: Yes, I did. I did.",
        "A: Sure, it was the final blow, and the woman took me into her house, and she told me\nI should stay overnight over there, and say the next day, go wherever you wanted, but\nyou have to go to a large city. A small town is not safe for you to go. She begged me, I\nremember, I don\u2019t know if she gave me food. Well, a poor woman, too, actually, I\nremember. But I slept over there, and the minute I saw daylight, I just walked off, out\nthe door, I didn\u2019t thank for nothing, I didn\u2019t say goodbye, or not goodbye. I just\nwalked out. And I went straight to the railroad station, and I didn\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t\nknow where to go or what to do. But finally I said I'd try to go back maybe, to\nTheresienstadt, or whatever, see other friends, and where they go, I will go. I -- I\ndidn\u2019t know what to do. And I took the train, I went back to Czechoslovakia, and came\nto Prague, actually.",
        "A: Anywhere, yeah, exactly, I mean Prague meant the same like I don\u2019t know, like\nBrazil, or you name it. I didn\u2019t know it. I was -- never was in Prague, and I never\ntraveled too much in Poland, and so I didn\u2019t know it -- the different between one\ncountry and the other country.",
        "A: Well this -- this I left. I -- I was raised -- we have not been -- our -- our whole\nfamily, actually, because being business people, we never have any sentiment or\nlikeness for Russians.",
        "A: That Communism was as bad as Nazism, that\u2019s all. Over there you are told what to\nwear, what to eat, and what this. You know, the Nazis, you know, it was another --",
        "A: -- it was no different between each other, they\u2019re just a different color 1s about all\n[indecipherable]. This was actually bef -- when I came back to -- to Prague, and I\ndidn\u2019t know nobody in Prague. It happened to be on the railroad station the same way,\nby accident, I see a familiar face. He was with me -- he c -- he was from Belgium,\nfrom Antwerp. And he came from the first transport, came actually from Belgium,\nHolland. And he came in \u201942, maybe spring \u201942, or this I don\u2019t know either, exactly,\nbut he was from the earliest Jewish transport, he came with the Jewish transport. And\nwe used to be in the same barrack. And I remember, and I said -- I said, \u201cJulius?\u201d And\nhe says, \u201cYeah, Kornberg.\u201d Well, we recognize each other, and so we talked about tt.\nHe was in Buchenwald, too, but during the march, when they took us away from over\nthere, he had a chance, one from the guard told a reichsdeutsch, a German, you know,\nthat he should go, organize, take away a couple horses, and -- and over there, you\nknow, they needed horses. So he took him along, so they just took off, they\ndisappeared. So he saved himself a lot of things in his life probably, because 80, no\nmore, 90 percent, or even 95 percent didn\u2019t made it, you know, after those marches\nand this -- everything. [indecipherable] ask me where you going. I told him\n[indecipherable] I says, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cWhat you going to do?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And\nhe ask me, \u201cDid you go back home?\u201d I told him I tried it, and they tell me I shouldn\u2019t\ngo in this town. Well, he looked -- and he was a very nice guy -- and he\u2019s still, you\nknow, because we meet together, the Red Cross gets us together. Julius Bear is his\nname. He\u2019s originally from Hamburg, but when the Germans kicked out those\n[indecipherable] 1n Germany, they send him to a border, you know, and so he ended\nup, his parents and him, they went to Antwerp in -- in Belgium. And so he said that\nthey go back to Belgium, to Antwerp, and he had a whole group was Jewish boys, too.\nHe said, \u201cCome along.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy not? I don\u2019t know where else to go.\u201d I went in,\nbut you had to go in to the council first, to pass, you know. Well, he told me, you\nknow, where Antwerp lays, near Antwerp, where this town -- I don\u2019t recall even the\ntown, but he told me. He said the council probably will ask you a few questions. And\nif he ask you, you know what is next to Antwerp, and that city. Okay. So I waited over\nthere until I was called in, I called in to the council. He ask completely things, you\nknow, that I didn\u2019t know, weren\u2019t familiar so he right away -- he was very polite, he\nsmiled at me, and he kindly touched my back, he says, \u201cYou\u2019re not from Belgium.\u201d\nAnd he says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I cannot let you go. You\u2019re not from Belgium.\u201d I came back\nout, and I told him, \u201cThe council don\u2019t let me go through, he recognize that I am not\nfrom Belgium.\u201d Well, he told me that they stayed, they came a night before, and they\nstayed where in Prague, in a sanitorium. Mostly in the sanitorium, he said there\u2019s\npeople from concentration camps over there. And he said it\u2019s a very good place, they\ntake good care of you, and I should go over there to the sanitortum. You know, he\ngave me the address, how to go, whatever, I didn\u2019t know nothing. Well, he went to\nAntwerp, an-and I went over there to the sanitorium. Yeah, he warned me not to tell\nthat I am from Poland, they have skirmishes, the Czechs and Poles. He said, \u201cIf you\nsay you\u2019re from Poland, they will not take you in.\u201d Well, said all right, we didn\u2019t had\nno ID\u2019s anyway, nobody knows, you could tell anything. Well, I came over there, and\nthey ask me where I am, I told them I\u2019m from Germany. Which city? I told them\nHanover. I didn\u2019t know even where Hanover 1s, I didn\u2019t know it. Okay, so they\ndocument me over -- over there, I had no other identification that I am from in\nHanover. And the first thing is this was the first time I saw a doctor. It was a beautiful,\nclean place, good food and everything. They gave me a number on the second floor, a\nroom to stay over, everything unusually clean. But even for somebody from a\nconcentration camp, but in general, you know, was a nice place. A nice section, too, it\nwas almost outside Prague. In the morning, around 10 o\u2019clock, a doctor came, and\nexamined me. I was not used -- I never was examined before.",
        "A: Yeah, oh. And examined me, and I -- I think I mentioned already, and then he told\nme I have a enlarged heart, and he called the nurse, and he told her --",
        "A: -- that I should not go up on the second floor, they should give me a room\ndownstairs, that I --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "A: I was over there, and they actually saved my life, because I was still in very bad\nshape when I came to the sanitorium. But they fed us so good, and the friendship from\nthe Czechs was so great. Used to come for entertainment in the evenings, didn\u2019t do\nnothing except ate, and sit around. They used to send them young girls in school, kids,\nbeautiful kids, beautiful girls, and they came in, they talked to us, and I -- I know how\nI looked, you know, shaved and everything, and terrible, shaved and everything. They\nused to tell how beautiful I am, I mean I know the truth, and I knowed why they do it,\nmake me feel good.",
        "A: Yeah, they made -- tried to do, they tried to do anything, you know, to make you\ncomfortable, and they did. And til today I ca -- will never forget that they actually --\nthe Czechs in the sanitortum saved my life. So I stayed over there about four weeks.\nBut later, you see, go out in the streets, and you saw those Russian soldiers, and -- you\nknow, I -- like I mentioned, I was raised and I had none -- much sympathy for\nRussians. And I saw how they\u2019re dressed, you know, on one foot he had a shoe, on one\nfoot a boot. You know, terrible. And I start to dislike, you know, being over there in\nPrague. And one time I met a couple boys, they came from Germany, actually. They\ndid business, you know, they bought up clothing in Germany, they were -- sold it in\nCzech -- or vice-a versa, I don\u2019t know. They made money, that\u2019s all. And --",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: They have been smart enough to realize that they don\u2019t had nobody any more who\nwill look at them. They did the right thing. A la -- they know what they have to do on\ntheir own to make money, and they did made it. They ask me -- we met each other,\nand they ask me from where I am, which camp I was. And I told them everything\nabout it, and that I couldn\u2019t go back home to my hometown. And they said -- I told\nthem, I don\u2019t like -- that everything 1s good, clean, food, everything, but I feel of --\nfairly all right, but the only thing is I don\u2019t like to see Russians next to me\n[indecipherable]. Told me why don\u2019t you go to the American zone, the English zone.\nThey take care of you, they do this, it\u2019s much better, you ge -- if you want, we can try\nto do business, you know. Th -- you have more freedom. I listened to him, and in\nPrague were used to be office where the -- they did the deportation to where you came,\nyou know. They organized, and they had buses, you know. And certain days, even\nthey went this direction, this direction. And I came over there to this office, and I say I\nwant to go home. They ask me where, and sh -- I told them Hanover. \u201cOh,\u201d she said,\n\u201cHanover is bad. We very rare have a bus go to Hanover. A lot of times you could\nhave to wait for it two, three weeks.\u201d Then was a German in the office, I don\u2019t know\nwhat he did, and he says, \u201cOh, you know what? I drive tomorrow to Stuttgart.\u201d And he\nsays, \u201cIf you wanted, I can take you to Stuttgart, and Stuttgart you going to be closer to\nHanover than in Prague.\u201d He says he just meet me here and here.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t bothered me, you know, I felt that he\u2019s a very polite, decent person. He\noffered me a -- you know, a ride, he takes me along.",
        "A: He know that I don\u2019t have money, and I cannot pay.",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure.",
        "A: Oh no, no, just my -- no, he didn\u2019t, and he just want to do a favor for me, and I\nfigured -- you know, I appreciated the favor. No, we didn\u2019t think about nothing else,\nexcept -- and true enough, he told me in the morning, meet me here and there, and he\ntook me with his car. Took a long time, you know, and I think in the evening even,\nthey still had curfew at this time, you was not allowed to travel for private, excepts,\nyou know, military. Finally, in the morning, when -- whatever, he arrived in Stuttgart,\nand -- and he said this is as far as he go. I -- he let me off. First thing the -- I don\u2019t\nknow who told me, this I don\u2019t remember even, that I should go over -- where he let\nme off was not far away was a school. The name of the school is Yakob Shula. Yakob\nSchool. And he said, \u201cGo over there, over there most people come home from\nconcentration camps, they stay over there until they know where to go, or what.\u201d So I\nwent in, this was -- must be a Friday I arrived in Stuttgart, yeah. And I went over there,\nwas a big room, a school, real huge. It was maybe 20 beds, or whatever. They gave\nyou a bed, you know, to sleep in, and they gave you always a slip, across the street was\na restaurant where they gave you a slip for breakfast, or dinner, supper, whatever. Oh,\nthis 1s all right, I mean, I didn\u2019t feel nothing wrong in -- you know, about this. I mean,\nit was great. I went over there overnight, and in the morning, I didn\u2019t know Stuttgart,\nbut I went down in the center of the Stuttgart, and looked around. And then I notice a\ncouple boys, and they looked at me, and I looked at them. You know, this was not hard\nto recognize. Finally we get closer a little bit, I went their way, and they came my way,\nand finally they ask me in Hebrew, Amahoud? Means if you are Jewish, you know. I\ntold them yeah, I am Jewish. And they said they\u2019re Jewish, too. They ask me the story\nwhere I was, I told them, you know, in Auschwitz I worked in a coal mine, and I just\ncome from Prague where I was in a sanitorium, and I -- somebody brought me to\nStuttgart. Well, they told me, oh -- he says -- yeah, this what they told me first, they\nask me where I stay. I told them the Yakob Shula. They say, \u201cOh, Jewish people don\u2019t\nstay in the Yakob Shula.\u201d This is maybe for Germans, other nationality, not Jewish\npeople.",
        "A: And I said, \u201cVery well, where do I go? I mean, I don\u2019t have nobody.\u201d Oh see, they\ntold me go to Dagaloff. Dagaloff is the outskirt of Stuttgart. This 1s 90 -- 90 percent\nvillas, and the most beautiful area ever see, you know, landscaping, beautiful. It\u2019s on\nhigher ground, Stuttgart is in. They call it castle in the lower part. And they said, \u201cYou\ngo over there, it\u2019s a sanitorium.\u201d And over there where Jewish people go, you know,\ncome from the concentration camp. And I come over there, actually, a beautiful villa,\nsanitorium, re -- the grounds, everything, gardens and all kinds. Was a sanitort1um\nbefore the owner -- it was his name, Katt sanitorium. He was a Nazi apparently.\nEisenhower, all the -- the biza -- the troops who were occupied to kick him out from\nthe sanitorium, and let all [indecipherable] camps -- in concentration camp live in the\nsanitorium. I -- I didn\u2019t had -- the eyes kept on looking, and looking, wherever, how\nbeautiful and everything. And same way, they had to -- the German government was\nforced to supply the best foods. The occupation -- the soldiers used to tell them they\ndon\u2019t care from where they get it, but they want for -- for those who camp in camps,\nthe best, nothing less than the best. And this what they had to do. Anyway, I came over\nthere, and then I met Fedderman, he was with me in -- in Buchenwald, in Traylitz. And\nwe have been together where I met him, and so we -- we shared the room together.",
        "A: Chadbush.",
        "A: Oh, this was my niece. She\u2019s a professor, a doctor professor, she teaches in\nRowland University in -- in Florida, Orlando, near Orlando. They live in -- in Winter\nPark, Florida. And she just made up -- then this was the plan. She\u2019s -- normally she\ngoes all over the world from the university, always with conferences, nofa. So she\ndecided, and her husband, she wants to go into the hometown where I was born, this is\na -- a daughter of my brother from Israel, she\u2019s a Israeli, too. And she ask me if I want\nto go along, I -- I told her I don\u2019t think I f-feeled for it, to do it. She said she still wants\nto see it. They went along in July. They visited the hometown, and she was very nice\ngreeted. She had a letter to the mayor of Chadbush from the mayor from Winter Park.\nSh-She had it translated, actually. And he really was a -- he looks a very pleasant\nperson, a nice person, the mayor from the town, from Chadbush. He is more or less a\nyounger generation, too. He\u2019s -- he\u2019s maybe in the 40\u2019s, something like this, and he\nwas very, very nice to her, and everything. And she -- she\u2019s very excited about it, and\nthey made a video. She send me a copy, the last night we watched it, actually. I was\nnot excited about it, you know. She ask me before if I want to go along, and I told her,\nI don\u2019t think so. When I saw the video, or even before I saw the video, and she told me\nover the phone, I realized it would tear me apart to step in, you know, where I lost\neverything, to step in those stones. I don\u2019t know, you know, a lot of times, I\u2019m not\nhuman, I\u2019m like a piece steel, or a stone, you know, I don\u2019t have no feelings for\nnothing. On the other hand, you know, if -- I\u2019m very easy to get emotional, too. I think\nit\u2019s a sickness, or it came in the suffer -- I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not normal, you know. I can\nget emotionally depressed.",
        "A: I try my best, I know that I have to help myself. I don\u2019t believe in any doctor, or\nany consultation will help something like this. The only way how I know, is to help\nmyself, and just don\u2019t give in, just be strong enough to fight it, to make you forget,\neven if you don\u2019t -- cannot forget, and you will not forget, but talk yourself in that you\ndid forgot, you have to keep on going on living.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t know, everybody can has it\u2019s opinion.",

But personally, I don\u2019t think, you know, it\u2019s a great idea, something\nlike this. It\u2019s too much Jewish blood in Birkenau, what it will never get over it,\nactually.
