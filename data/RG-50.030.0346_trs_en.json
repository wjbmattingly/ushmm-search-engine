        "Q: Will you begin by telling me your name, date of birth, where you were born, and your\nname at that time?",
        "A: It is Estelle Klipp right now. But I was born Estella Gippsa Weingarten (ph). And I was\nborn in Lodz on Savatzka (ph) number 40 -- and in the year 1922, January 10th.",
        "Q: Try to look at me. You're looking down.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: I'll turn the lights off, its a little irritating. Tell me a little bit about your family life before\nthe war.",
        "A: It was beautiful. It was a vary large family. My parents, sisters, and brothers -- I mean,\nmy mother had about seven siblings. And my father, the same. And for instance, on\nPurim we're gathering all of us in the house of my grandma. And it was.....",
        "Q: Stop tape. We have to do this again. Tell me a little bit about your family life before the\nwar.",
        "A: Now, as an example, for instance, on Purim we were all gathering at my grandma's\nhouse. It was grandma Weingarten. And it was extremely festive, you know. On Purim,\nyou bring schlackamonies. So there were just beautiful cakes, and what they call torte,\nand there was fruit. And everybody gathered there, all my cousins, and all my aunts and\nuncles. And usually, it lasted -- there was one cousin who played the violin. And that\nwas Itzic (ph) Weingarten. And then we -- it was very nice for us children because we\nhad to stay up longer. And then when we came to our house, the manager of the house\ncame out, and we have to ring the bell, and he opened the gate. And for us children, it\nwas a big happening coming so late. And he -- and it was Purim. But it must have been\ncold because he was coming out with a fur coat. And it was a good life. We were to our\ngrandma's we surely went by druzka, which was a horse -- horse-drawn carriage. And\nthere was always a lot of fun too. We met the cousins. There were my aunts. And in the\nsummer, in the beginning, we used to go to a spa, like Rainitza (ph), or Rapka (ph). And\nlater on, we built a house in Portumbina (ph). And it was one -- there were, like, four\napartments. And one was ours, and the other one we use to rent out. In fact, I have a\npicture in front of it. It was beautiful there too. And we were spending the vacations\nthere. So life was pretty normal and very much based on family. I was going to school.\nIt was called gymnasium imienia Hochsztajnowei. And it was a lovely school. It was so\nbeautiful there. In our auditorium, the floor was like a mirror. And when we came to\nschool, we had to change shoes. And we often had concerts in school. We had the grand\npiano. And there was often -- Chopin was often being played. When I hear Chopin now,\nI remember it. And my brother was going also to a school. And in the afternoon, he had\nto go to a parochial school to learn more Hebrew and so on. And we used to play. I\nremember we played train, I and him, in the house when our housekeeper put the chairs\nin the middle so that she could clean them. And there were holidays. There were\nbeautiful occasions. There were summer outings. There were picnics. And all of a\nsudden, like a lightening from the sky actually, everything changed. And, of course, we\nhad no idea that anything like that could actually happen. And so there were actually\nclouds in the sky. There was bunchen where the people from Germany were coming.\nBut somehow, when you live a normal life, you just don't think and don't believe of such\na possibility. My father did -- after the Germans entered Lodz, he predicted certain -- I\nmean, even before, he predicted certain things. And I asked him, \"If that's what you\nbelieve, why aren't we leaving?\". First, there was no place to leave. And then you have\nreally to have guts and you have really -- to be able to leave. But there was no place to\nleave. Nobody wanted us.",
        "Q: Let me stop you a minute. Was your family fairly religious? You had mentioned Purim.",
        "A: Yes. We actually celebrated all the holidays. And my father was rather religious. He\nwas -- at the same time, he spoke French and he spoke German. He was a wizard in\nmathematics. And, of course, we had a business. The business was on Ostrowska 10 and\npolizei station. And it was Golontaria Emenya Weingartenya (ph). And everybody in\nLodz knew that place. And today, I sometimes meet people here even in Los Angeles\nwho said, \"Of course, we were going there.\" We had a very good name. Everybody was\nsafe because in Lodz, at that time, you didn't have prices on any articles. But they knew\nyou could send a check to that store and they would be treated fairly.",
        "Q: What kind of store was it?",
        "A: If somebody is familiar with the Silk Shop, which used to be in Los Angeles, it was very\nsimilar. There were wools, and lace, and buttons, and gloves, and hats, and -- I mean, all\nkinds of things. And it was in existence for a very long time, until the Germans took the\nkeys away. And so my father's family was more religious than my mother's family. But\nwe celebrated all the holidays. And our Passover was just fantastic. It was so beautiful\nand -- it was so beautiful, I remember that we -- I used fall asleep finally, because it\nlasted so long. But all the -- it was just beautiful.",
        "Q: Did you --",
        "A: You asked me about the school, sorry if I interrupt?",
        "Q: Well, yeah. I was wondering if you had any Christian friends or if you really lived in a\nJewish community.",
        "A: It's very interesting. We lived in a Jewish community. The manager of the apartment\nhouse was not Jewish. And in our summer house, the keeper of the grounds was not\nJewish. And some of the housekeepers at my grandma's house were not Jewish. But, in\ngenerally, we were actually -- we thought that everybody was Jewish. Yes.",
        "Q: Large Jewish community?",
        "A: It was a very large Jewish community. Lodz was -- I understand there were 250,000\nJews or more. It was a textile in the street there and it was called the Polish Mattress\nStash. And so when some of this -- of the big industrialists in textile were going to our\nschool. It was Vininsky (ph), Korn (ph), and others.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism or you just weren't around it?",
        "A: Oh, we felt it. Somehow we did feel it. We knew that it exist. We felt it much more\nbefore -- after Hitler came into power and after the death of Marshall Pilsudski. That\nreally felt 1t and I remember one program. We went to the summer house all the father, I\nand Lolick (ph) and when we came back my mom was petrified, terrified standing at the\nwindow because she had a feeling which I will always remember because she knew there\nis a program and -- but we were able to somehow safely reach our house. And there was\nsome times such a underlying fear of certain things which I as a child could sense and it\nhad much to do with anti-Semitism. That .... did that answer your question?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, and it, your question actually right now is how it was before the war? See, that\nschool I was going to was a private school and I started the school from the first grade\nand then I was maybe fortunate because I gained one year to graduate and they -- I had\nmy papers graduation papers. I thought they were very important. Dave, my husband,\nsaw them and when we went to Auschwitz I thought it would be helpful. I put it in my\nstocking. But of course, it wasn't helpful. I could get a copy, I think, if I would write to\nWarsaw, but it's not -- not really important right now. So it was -- it was actually a good\nlife. It was a Jewish life. We also had very high morals and ethics. And I remember that\nwhen the Germans came and we had to wear the yellow star I was, nothing to it as I was\nconcerned, but I had a friend, Genya Finkelstein (ph), who was from a little bit more\nassimilated home and she didn't want to go out I said, \"Genya, they're doing it to us.\nThey are the perpetrators. Let them be ashamed. Why should we be ashamed to wear the\nstar?\" And it had something to do with the upbringing I received in my house and we\nknew much about charity. My father used to always to say \"It's not enough to give. It's\nimportant how you give.\" I know when there were some relatives not close relatives who\nneeded help. There was always help ready for them and every Friday night my father\nwas bringing from the House Of Prayers a guest which is called the orrach, and he was\nsitting with us at the table and when we finished the meal he was given a bag of food to\ntake with him and nobody asked him any questions. It was a charitable atmosphere in\nour family. For instance, my grandmother one time somebody stole silver spoons and her\ndaughter says, \"Don't let htm in anymore.\" She says, \"Look, if he wouldn't have needed\nthe spoons, he wouldn't have taken them.\" So considering the high ethics and high\nmorals it was inconceivable for us to think that such atrocities which followed later on\nare possible that we had to prepare ourselves, but there was no way to prepare ourselves\nanyhow.",
        "Q: One more question about before the war. Were you involved in any political or Zionist\norganizations?",
        "A: I knew of their existence. I knew of their existence. However, in -- in retrospect I know\nthat it was -- actually the right thing to do. Because if you have an idea, no matter how\nimpossible it seems at the certain time what should actually follow it? Because the first\nthere is an idea always and there are deeds following it. But because of the background\nand because of the school I was not involved in it. I remember a certain time somebody\nwanted to -- to -- me to join, but I didn't.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the day when the Germans came in to Lodz?",
        "A: Yeah, it was a very, very frightening thing. They put up some --",
        "Q: What was the, I'm sorry. What was the date, do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: It was in 1939 and it must have been already in September. And some gallows were put\non in Lodz and some Jewish men were hung and they were very much interested that as\nmany as possible people would see it. When they entered Lodz they somehow wanted to\nharass and abuse the Jewish men, so there were, let's say, a knock in our house and they\nwanted my father. People who were taken to so called work were not taken actually to\nactual work. Some people were, for instance, bringing furniture up the set floor and the\nothers were suppose to take it down and so on. It was just shear harassment. Shear\ntorment. Shear like they wanted to demoralize us and what was happening was my father\nwas still going to the store and I was afraid that he'll be picked up and harassed, so I was\ngoing with him and he called me his angel. I had long brown hair and somehow I was\nvery often able to talk the German out of letting him go. I remember that one time we --\nthey brought us into a court yard and they left. And -- but it was a very frightening time\nbecause it was a very unsure time because -- and what was so tragic about it the Germans\nactually could not recognize who is a Jew and who is not, but there were Polish children\nstanding on the street and pointing out to the Germans who is Jewish and considering that\nthey were just having been occupied by the Germans and why did they do it? You know,\nvery often I'm thinking about it. Where does all this, I mean, it's -- it's based on -- on the\nteaching unfortunately of the church which I hope is being changed. But in Poland it will\ntake a very, very long time until it would be changed. I heard somebody saying that he\ngot this feeling of a stygmatism with the milk of his mother. Because -- and as I\nunderstand, that the church, the -- anyhow the Catholic Church since Pope the 23rd, is\nrealizing that the roots, a lot of the roots of this tragedy actually started with the people of\nthe church. Because it can teach hatred and there have been changes in their liturgy and\ntheir changes are -- are going on. I'm sure there are many, many Christians of very good\nheart and I'm glad that there is from the Vatican some directions now to change the\nliturgy.",
        "Q: Okay. We were talking about how the Polish people would -- would turn you in. What\nelse was happening on the streets at this time?",
        "A: It was especially -- for instance, 1t was so dangerous that my parents decided to send\nLolick, my brother, to a smaller city where his closest friends were living. In the hope\nthat he would be spared, but he came back after awhile because things were just as bad\nthere. There was also much more difficult to get fuel. Much more difficult to get food,\nSO we were living in one room in order to save fuel. We could sometimes -- of course we\ncouldn't get the amount of food which we needed, but we still could get some food. It\nwas dangerous to get out of the house. It was dangerous to be in the house because they\nwere just coming in and pulling you out.",
        "Q: Were there any bombings?",
        "A: The bombings were in the short period before the Germans came in. In fact, we went to a\ncellar. We -- you know, there were cellars where people were keeping the food to keep it\ncold and we were hiding there because there were some raids. That was in the period, the\nshort period, before the German army actually entered Lodz.",
        "Q: So how long did -- how long did this last? The Germans were in the -- the Germans\ncame in, they were around all the time harassing people?",
        "A: Yes, they were harassing people and one day when I brought my father to the store some\nGermans approached him and told him they wanted the keys to the store. We just had to\nhand it over. Now, we probably were expecting it and were bringing certain materials\nfrom the store and hiding it under the hardwood floors and we hid there also some\nTorahs. Maybe I'll mention it later, but when we were in the ghetto the manager, we\nassume, or we actually know that the manager of that apartment house informed the\nGerman about it and my brother was taken to the Kripo and from the Kripo he had to go\nto our apartment house and to -- to show them where everything is and they removed\neverything. And it was -- you know, it was a very -- it was a very dangerous, dangerous\ntime because there were shootings. There were shootings at that time and this -- this\nconstant harassment, you don't know whether a person would go out on the street or even\nfrom his house and he would come back alive because the torture was quite perverse.",
        "Q: So, did you stay in most of the time?",
        "A: We must have stayed in, but they were also coming into the house. I remember one time\nwhen they came and we hid my father in the bathroom, but it didn't help. We had to\nshow them where he is and they pulled him out. And he wasn't -- he was very spiritual\nand he was very learned, but he wasn't a strong man, a very strong man physically. But\nhe actually survived at Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Did the Germans promelgate a bunch of decrees? Were there new laws, things you had\nto do?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Yes.",
        "Q: Like what?",
        "A: First they liquidated all our stores. We couldn't own any stores. I'm sure there was a\ncatch for us. The amount of food we could get was limited. Of course, I couldn't -- the\nschools were closed. Our schools were closed. We had -- we had -- actually, the minute\nthey came in we were prisoners. We were prisoners and as an example of it they were\nputting up gallows and, you know, hanging people. And, our dignity was taken away -- I\nmean, it my -- the way I feel it, my dignity was never taken away. Not even in\nAuschwitz. I never felt inferior to them. It could be with the teaching of -- the teaching\natmosphere of my house I felt that the ones who do the wrong they should be ashamed of\nmy -- of themselves and when I heard somebody say that he felt inferior during this time\nit struck me actually because I -- I never felt inferior. Never.",
        "Q: Did all these changes happen right away?",
        "A: Right away. Right away, but the taking out of the -- I mean, the -- asking for the keys of\nthe store because I remember I was still taking my father to the store for a short time and\nbefore he had to hand over the keys.",
        "Q: You must have been fairly terrified.",
        "A: We were fairly terrified. It was, they were a very terrified times. Very terrified time.",
        "Q: Did your family have any plans or you were just going to....",
        "A: There was no way. There was absolutely no way. You live a normal life and something\nwhich is beyond your many imagination happens you cannot prepare for it. There was no\nway to prepare there were some very very rich people who were somehow able to -- to\nreach a different country. However, even the people of Germany who would have left\nGermany couldn't. There was no place to go. Even -- even a ship was -- a ship was sent\naware form the shores of the United States. The white paper was issued and there was no\nentrance to Palestine. Otherwise, some people could have maybe reached Palestine. No\nother country would have opened the door, so, I mean, we were just boxed in.\nCompletely boxed in. And, so some people did leave to Russia, for Russia. And a friend\nof my -- the closest friend of my brother left for Russia and survived, and he asked, he\ncame to our house and asked my father's permission that Lolick should go too. And I do\nunderstand my father on -- on -- in a way because he said we all should stay together.\nNobody could have predicted what would happen and he said no. And Lolick was an\nextremely -- first he was absolutely gorgeous. He was so handsome that when he was\nhelping out sometimes in the store people would say \"Go to that store just to take a look\nat that guy because he's so handsome.\" Then he was extremely talented. As a child he\nwas curious how the grandfather's clock is working. So he took it apart and when he\ncouldn't put it together he used a string, but the clock was working. I mean, by losing\nhim, of course I lost a brother, but the world lost something too. And when we\nconsidered all these people who were burned, gassed, tortured, murdered, the world lost\nsomething too because they were scientists and they were future doctors and they were\nfuture physicists and they were just people who learned from childhood, charity. And\nthat you are not living only for yourself, but you're living only for others.",
        "Q: At what point did the ghetto come about?",
        "A: Um --",
        "Q: What did you find -- I mean, how did that happen?",
        "A: Yes. There were announcements that we better go to the ghetto or else they'd be shooting\nus.",
        "Q: When was this do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: That was in 19 -- 1940. It was maybe six months after the Germans entered Warsaw. I\nguess when we went to the ghetto it must have been somehow the beginning of April and\nthey -- so we just had to go because otherwise, we would have been killed. And\nfortunately there was a neighbor of our's who was very helpful because she said she had\nsome kind of a wagon and why don't we go with her? So we packed some belongings.\nNot much of furniture and we went. It was very very traumatic. I was a pretty pampered\nchild. I wasn't a child anymore, I was 17. But I was pretty pampered and I couldn't take it\nso I kept fainting and there was no, there were only lavoratory -- there was no, you know,\naccomadations for bathrooms or anything like that. And I remember we stayed there and\nthen Ciotka [aunt] Hannah (ph) came and Uncle Moshe (ph) came and we all were\nsleeping on the floor and then some how somebody told us about the room of the\nFresetska (ph) eight. I think 1t was the same neighbor and that was one room. We lived\nin this room and that was my father, my mother, my brother, myself and later on during\none deportation there was also Ottos. Ottos --",
        "Q: You know, I'm -- What had you decided to take with you?",
        "A: The time was very limited.",
        "Q: When you went to the ghetto?",
        "A: Yes, and the amount of things we could take on this wagon was also very limited and, of\ncourse, we didn't have anybody ecspecially to help us, but anyhow I remember when\nthe -- I remember that we had a bed. And I remember that we had one piece of furniture\nwhich must have come from our kitchen. We had also a table and we had chairs and the\nroom wasn't very large and what -- when ever I think about that place on Fresetska eight,\nwho wasn't -- which wasn't very big and was the kitchen and everything was in this one\nroom, I have to give an enormous credit to my wonderful mother because it was\nextremely clean. Always, extremely clean. We're cooking there and sometimes I think\nabout it, how was she able to keep this place such meticulously clean. And later on after\none deportation Ottos, our cousin, was adopted by us. I think it had to be done so that\nthey have his name in the register so, that's why he was really adopted. And he came to\nus with a skin disease and my mother bathed him and cured him and my father got\ninfected and she bathed my father, and she cured him. And my mother was absolutely a\nvery remarkable women. She was very beautiful. She found a job for herself, by herself.\nShe was doing some -- some working with a sewing machine. She cooked where ever\nthere was some food to cook. She keeped everything clean and I know that at a certain\ntime she was going to sick people and she was washing them. She was washing their\nbodies. And thats why the tragedy of -- when ever the tragedy was touching my mother\nshe never complained, but it was very very painful to me and -- if I think about the time\nwe were taken to the Kripo. Kripo was the Kriminal Polizei. They were actually having\na building within the ghetto and since we were considered well to do in the ghetto, I\nmean, before -- they assumed that we had some valuables which they wanted to have.\nNow first 1t was only my father who was being taken to the Kripo. We were just petrified\nof the thoughts that they were going to take him and whether he would come back. Many\npeople didn't come back from the Kripo. The Jewish authorities were notified to take the\ncorpse away from Kripo. My father never disclosed anything and the strength his -- his\nspiritual and strength to be able to take the -- because they were actually whipping and\nhurting him and he came back and he didn't disclose anything. One time, they took my\nmother and I remember exactly. I was standing there when they took her and fortunately\nthey came later on for me because I was very much afraid about her not that that I could\ndo any help. I remember I walked into the Kripo, the cellars, in the cellars, there were\nthe torture chair -- there were the cells, where we were kept and in the back were the\ntorture chambers. So when you were sitting in the cellar you could hear cries and\nscreams. And -- but when I walked in there and this head of the Kripo, I think his name\nwas Stutar (ph), was standing there and I laughed. I was laughing in his face and he says\n\"Das Lachen wird dir hier vergehen,\" which means \"The laughter will stop here. Your\nlaughter will stop here.\" And I was also taken to the -- to the chambers and I was also\ntortured, but not to a degree that, you know, that I had to be hospitalized or something\nlike that. And finally, I don't know how it happened that they were -- released us. It --\nthe whole time we were in the ghetto, there was always an enormous fear that we would\ngo to the Kripo. And I remember when my father was in Kripo, when I was very\nconcerned that he is not coming back, and he is not coming back. I went to his brother's\nhouse. The brother was already deported. But his two sons -- one son was there. And\nthe son was very religious. He was the one who was playing the violin so beautiful. And\nhe was a real genius. And he says he was very religious. He said to me, \"Look. It's\nFriday night, and we didn't light the candles yet. So until we light the candles, he might\nstill come back.\" I just remember what he was saying. Even in the ghetto, we tried to\nremember when it's Friday. And on certain holidays, we made some -- mother prepared\nsomething from the grass, or from the leaves, or something which was appropriate for\nthat particular holiday. Now, you want to ask me something?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, no. Now, the problems in the ghetto were hunger, lack of fuel. But the worse of the\nworse was, the constant, deportations. And you could never be sure that, what is not\nbeing deported. And -- but there was one deportation, in particular, which was done by\nthe Germans. The other deportations -- when they hit somebody, of course, it was very\ntragic. So we really did not know for sure what was happening to us, and nobody thought\nthat we were going to places that they would gas us in some wagons. In the beginning,\nthey are telling us, they are taking people to work. And there was a small number of\npeople who were deported from the ghetto for the purpose of working in Germany, or in\nthe territories. In fact, one of my cousin, who was pretty husky, came back one time\nfrom a working camp. But they took him -- after a very short time, they took him again.\nI don't know whether to a working camp. Very likely, yes. But it was torturous work.\nSo we did not know. We actually had no inkling that a deportation means being taken to\ndeath, or gassed, or murdered. And this Germans were master of deceit. Before they --\nthe deportation to Auschwitz, there were loudspeakers. And I don't know who, in\nparticular, it was. But 1t was people. And they were assuring us that we should take\neverything we possibly can with us, because we are going to a better working camp. And\nI remember that my brother was working very hard to pack everything possible. They\nsay, \"Take pots and take pans, because you are going to a better place\" -- and I was sick\nalready at that time. So I was just watching them. But they were packing. Now, the\ndeportation -- going back to the deportation. There were always deportations. There was\na list made, which in view of what happened -- this was, I think, '42, September -- the\nalternative -- the other alternative was very -- was terrible. They just -- I am -- they just\ncame into the ghetto with trucks and with wagons, they ordered a gehsperren, which\nmeans, you know, a curfew -- they ordered a curfew and they said that they would take\nall elderly people, they would take children, and take -- we are -- if anybody would hide\nin the apartment, they would be shot. What I did -- I knew -- my mother was actually in\nher 40s. But she already had gray hair. And I was very much afraid for her, that they\nwould take her. I don't know how I did it. But I took her to the part of the ghetto which\nthey already were searching and taking people away, and I hid her there. But I had to run\nback because there had to be a certain amount of people present in the courtyard for them\nto do the selection. And then I went back and brought her home. Now, that was a\nterrifying time, because they were shooting anybody who, let's say, approached a wagon,\nor run to a place that they didn't want to, or whatever. They were all shooting. They\nwere just shooting. They were taking some people who were younger. They did not\nreally select only the older, the elderly, ones. It was one of the most traumatic, terrifying\ndeportation. So there's no excuse for anything. However, maybe because none of my\nfamily was deported -- so I'll tell you in a few minutes about my brother. In comparison\nwith the alternative, the alternative would have been -- I'm talking about the list -- the\nalternative would have been that they would enter the ghetto and just shoot whomever\nthey wanted and drag whomever, which was of course much more frightening to begin\nwith. And we didn't know and no one knew that we are going, just like we didn't know\nabout Auschwitz, which I am very surprised that the Poles or somebody from the outside\nwould not somehow give us, because they knew. They knew where Auschwitz was, and\nthey knew what was going on in Auschwitz. Anyhow, one time, my brother was about to\nbe deported. What happened -- my mother was at her sister's, and I was home, and that\nSonderkommando came, and they looked for him that he was supposed to be deported.\nAnd he hid. But we had to, we had to, he had to come out of the hiding, and they took\nhim. And I had only one solution. See, he was very sick in the ghetto. He was sick with\ntyphus. And he was -- that was a very terrible experience, because he was very sick and\nhis eyes were not completely closed, only partial. And finally, 1t was so hard on me to\nlook at it that I was sleeping at a neighbor's and, in the morning, I was going to the\nwindow -- we had the shutters closed -- and looking through the shutters whether he 1s\nstill there. And my mother, did everything possible -- we got some food for him -- she\nwashed him, she bathed him. And a neighbor told us of a doctor who was a heart\nspecialist, Doctor Yorkiche (ph).\nAnd Doctor Yorkiche found that his myocardium, which is a sac around the heart, is infected.\nAnd everybody suspected its typhus also. But if it would be -- if they would have taken\nhim to the hospital -- of contagious diseases -- you would have never come out. Nobody\ncame out of there. And -- but -- so he was finally taken to the hospital, a regular hospital.\nAnd fortunately, this was not at the time. Because later on, the German took all the\npatients from all the hospitals, including the children's hospital, and deported them. But\nthat was earlier. He reported that he was going to work. But I knew Doctor Yorkiche.\nAnd Doctor Yorkiche was supposed to be in the commission to select who is going and\nwho is not -- no, I mean, -- so I ran to her, and I said, \"Do you remember how sick he\nwas? Do whatever you can do, and she must not have done it because they didn't take\nhim.\" So we were together -- and maybe I should inject it now. When you\nphilosophically think about life, it's true. They didn't survive. I'm the only one who\nsurvived. But everyday -- I mean, the life is not forever anyhow. So that we were\ntogether and that we were together until Auschwitz has its great value. And when we\ntalk about going to Auschwitz, I will mention to you that we had a day extra. But I think\nI should do it later. My father was also sick. But he also recovered. And he had a work,\nwhich was much too much for his physical strength. So -- but I was able to find him\nsome other work. I felt always some responsibility for everybody. When my brother was\nsick, I prayed that if somebody has to go, let it be me, but not him. And I always tried to\nget something. I was able to get some soup, I was able to pick up some leaves, I was able\nto go to the resort of -- I mean, the place where there were vegetables -- and get the\npotato, or get something. But finally, you know, there was a lot of starvation. And I,\nactually, was never used to -- wasn't a big eater. But I was the one who had swollen --\nwho had edema. And later on -- that was already '43. '43 -- I may be jumping around --\nbut in '43, many people had tuberculosis, many people had pleurisy, the worst diseases,\nwhich were the result of starvation, because there was very little food. It was an\naccumulated process. The body was being starved and being starved and being starved.\nIn the beginning, you saw people in the ghetto who were much slimmer than they used to\nbe. You could see it in their clothes. You could see, when you look at them, they had\nfunny color of skin. But later on, there were people working with a lot of edema. It was\nfrom malnutrition. And there were many people dying of tuberculosis. Most of the\npathological diseases somehow disappeared, like my father who used to have diabetes.\nHe didn't have it. My mother used to have a kidney stone. She didn't have the kidney\nstone. It was mostly the effect of malnutrition.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about the food situation. How did you get food?",
        "A: There were portioned. And they were -- see, depending what the German appropriated --\nfor the ghetto population. It was known in the administration of the ghetto. They were\nalso very good at knowing where people lived, where people worked, how many people\ndied, how many people -- most of the time, they even knew how many people are\ndeported. Only the time when the Germans deported people, probably, they were not\nable to have the real good statistics. So they were able to fix the rations for -- based on\nhow much food it was. Now, there were sometimes starvation rations. Now, people who\nhad worked were entitled to a soup. The soup was actually some vegetables and it wasn't\nmuch. But it was something. And we all were working. So we all had the soup. And\nthe rations of food were sometimes very, very small. But it was, I was able sometimes to\nget an additional soup, or something additional. We somehow -- I mean, I was actually\nthe smallest eater before the war. I had -- I had signs of starvations already. And so -- I\nsometimes think about it. How that everybody -- there was very little food. But it wasn't\nlike -- you know, sometimes you stand in line, and you say, \"No, we ran out of food.\" It\ndidn't happen. Everybody -- that's a little minimal, that very little was substandard. I\nmean, and it was not sufficient, 1t was a starvation diet. But everybody got it. And here,\nmaybe -- maybe we should give thought to the way the administration of the ghetto has\nbeen formed and of their functioning, that they were able to provide everybody with what\nlittle it was. But everybody got it. It was never a situation that somebody was\ncompletely left out. And also, most of the time in the ghetto, maybe not at the very end, I\ndon't recall any time where there was ever corpses on the street, or where there was -- we\nhad to -- it had to be clean, because the Germans would not -- would have closed us up\nand finished the ghetto off. And also, there were in the beginning, and now later on too,\nbut people were after -- they were afraid to go the hospital, because they were afraid they\nwould be deported the way -- it was a big tragedy. Human life, as I see it, was very\nimportant to everybody in the ghetto. Because I recall that we -- there was a little bit of\nland at Fresetska eight. And it has been divided so that we can -- not at the very\nbeginning, but later on -- it was divided so that we could grow some tomatoes, or onions,\nor what have you. And I, we had also a piece of land. Now, I don't recall that anybody\nstole anybody's vegetables, and really don't recall it. And I am very impressed -- I am\nvery impressed with it. And as far as the neighbors, where my brother would sleep, they\nwere very helpful. They disappeared. They must have been deported. The neighbor\nwho came with us, who helped us with that wagon -- they were deported. And they had a\nlittle child. In '43, you didn't see any children. There were no children in the ghetto. In\nthe very beginning, the administration in the ghetto tried to have schools. One time, there\nwas even a graduation. And to keep up, you know, the intellectual part of life so that we\ncan survive intellectually. Now, about the German Jews who came in, I remember them.\nThey were so different. They were, like, normal people. Go ahead.",
        "Q: Well, before you tell me about them, when did they come in and how did that happen?",
        "A: Must have been -- wait for just a second. They might have come in in 1941. 1942 was\nthat big, big deportation. And they were deported before. So it must have been, like,\n1941, or something like that. They came from the lawyers, Germans, Germans who have\nthe iron crosses, I mean, some Mischlings, which means they were married to Jews, some\nwhose ancestry was discovered that they were Jewish, some who were actually Jewish.\nBut when they came in, they were normal people. We were not normal people anymore,\nnot in our -- not in our looks, or not in our way of life. Maybe, some intellectually,\nactually were. And they also -- some of them brought farce (ph) with them, or different\nclothes. But it was tragic, because it was a very short time they were so miserable. They\nwere so miserable. But there were also many lawyers. And some of the lawyers were,\nhad positions later on as prosecutors and judges in the courts. There were courts in the\nghetto, and there were judges in the ghetto, and there was a priest in the ghetto. And so --\nand then most of them, the majority of them -- there were some rumors that about 20,000\ncame in. But many of them, afterwards, were deported. And there were many musicians.\nAnd at the end of the ghetto, all the instruments, musical instruments, had been\nrequisitioned -- requisitioned. I will just repeat that. And that's it.",
        "Q: When the German transports came into the ghetto, did they mix with the -- with the rest\nof you, or did they keep to themselves?",
        "A: It probably varied. For instance, it varied. There was one big industrialist Hirsch (ph).\nAnd I know that my husband let him come to his office where he was and --",
        "Q: Your present husband?",
        "A: My present.",
        "Q: Not your husband in the ghetto?",
        "A: I don't know. That's my first husband. And I was not married --",
        "Q: No, I know that. But when you say, \"my husband\" you're talking about fifty years ago?",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. My present husband, right. And he\nwas -- he was -- it was a Mr. Hirsch. And he -- he was -- he kept exempt so that he could\nget us to -- so there was something. Of course, I'm sure they -- when they looked at us,\nnot properly dressed that there was malnutrition and we probably looked like heck. So of\ncourse, I'm sure they felt superior. So unfortunately, after a not very long time, they\ndidn't look very much different than we did. But many talented people were -- were\nincorporated in the administration of the ghetto. And the, the musicians were -- there\nwere, sometimes, concerts. So they were active there. And the lawyers were -- were --\nsome of them were active as judges.",
        "Q: In order to bring in all these new people, did it just get more crowded, or had the ghetto\nbeen cleared of a lot of --",
        "A: At this time, it had been cleared somewhat, but not completely, because there were\npeople coming from other places, from ghettos which had been closed, like Pabanitzya\n(ph), Suskavolya (ph), and others. It was a problem. And that what -- in retrospect or\nmaybe even then, this very well organized administration of the ghetto, with all its flaws\nand so on, was able to -- to somehow incorporate them, maybe first not in apartments.\nBut they were incorporated, and they were -- given food -- they were also buying food\nwith their fares and with the fixed wage they brought. But each time there was an influx,\nsomehow -- somehow, the administration of the ghetto was doing something about\nincorporation. But later on, there was so many deportations that the ghetto shrunk. I\nmean, you could see when you walked that the ghetto's shrinking. I don't know\nwhether -- what, maybe, not even one third of the population was there when we were\nready to go to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Was there -- you've mentioned a number of things like concerts, schools, all this. So\nthere was --",
        "A: In the very beginning. It was in the very beginning. Because then, when the older kids\nand everybody has to work -- and I understand children who were very young had also to\nwork, so that there was -- the schools were only in the very beginning. Later on, we\ncould not have any schools. They went to middling schools and if -- 1f a person wouldn't\nwork, they could be deported. They had to work. And they took, in this awful\ndeportation in 1942 -- children were taken away. And before we went to Auschwitz.\nThere were no children in the ghetto. I heard of a -- of a which, Dave my present\nhusband witnessed and mother. See, the Germans were masters of deceit. So they were\ntelling stories, like, they were going to take the children and they should be make to look\npretty, by whichever means is possible, and that they would be going to better places.\nAnd then, this mother had to put the child on a wagon and, right away, she'd become\ninsane.\nTape #2",
        "Q: You were talking about the ghetto and you had mentioned concerts. Was there some\nattempt at a normal life there?",
        "A: A person who has been in the ghetto has to answer that there was no normal. It was\nabsolutely not a normal life. We were living in a constant fear. And when we talk about\nconcerts, very, very few people actually attended. We knew that they were -- in the very\nbeginning, more people could attend. But it really is only like a token that something like\nthat existed in the ghetto. But I'm sure that many people didn't even know about the\nexsistence of the concert, because very few people were able to reveal themselves to\nthem.",
        "Q: Was there a synagogue?",
        "A: Absolutely not. In fact, there were -- in the beginning, there were some Rabbis. But later\non, they had to -- they cut their beards off, and they were not able to function. In fact,\nsee, they were -- there was a marriage, marriage ceremony. At the very end, the only\nperson who can conduct the ceremony was Rumchovsky (ph) -- the Rabbis had no rights\nto do anything of this kind. Services -- there was no services. They wouldn't allow that.\nSee, the ghetto was also changing, it wasn't always the same. If we talk about schools,\nthey were only at the very, very beginning. Later on, the German wouldn't allow it, they\nwould allow only work, and they demanded work of children who were very young. I\nthink anything above 10 -- they had to work. So schools were absolutely out of question.\nThe life was really, absolutely not normal. So, let's say, our family -- we were extremely\nfortunate. One -- one reason for our good fortune was a cellar. In the other room, there\nwas a cellar. The cellar was very close to the back wall where our bed was standing.\nAnd very frequently, when we knew there was a deportation, we went down to the cellar.\nIt was very crowded. My brother -- there were two boards to cover that cellar. He\ncovered it, and he put the bed over it. We would close the shutters. So there were quite a\nfew times that we escaped deportation this way. That's why we were able to stay so long\nbefore we went to Auschwitz. In the same way -- it was no normals, because it was\nterror, it was fear, there were -- I don't -- I didn't have any social life. The life was work,\nand you came home, and there was also -- we were not able to use electricity very long.\nSo it was darkness. And you know, in such a situation as it was in ghetto, you just want\nto survive, you are happy that you lived that day, and that your mother lived that day, that\nyour brother is living the day, that your father is living the day. That was -- that was all\nwe wanted. And nobody even had -- had -- we, you know -- you have -- you accept it\nthat you don't live, actually, for today. You accept it that you just -- or you live for today,\nthat you accept that a day passed by without any deportation, without any shooting,\nwithout any -- any decrees. And it was in the time of the -- it was a time in the ghetto, at\nthe very end, that they were cutting off parts of the ghetto, so people have to go, have to\nleave their apartments and go to others. We were fortunate, quote in quote, that we\nstayed, you know, in this, one apartment, from the beginning, you know, to the end. And\nwhen it was very cold -- there were times that it was very cold. But I think that they even\ncleaned the streets during the winter, maybe not for us, maybe for the Germans, so that\nthey -- nothing should happen to the Germans. And it was lie that we -- they were\nalways some rumors. And it was -- it wasn't really what you call a life. It was a sub --\nsubliving, subliving. And see, we -- we had something -- that the war is going well for\nthe Allies. And you know, we were hoping. We were hoping. And that this hope kept\nus alive. But we were not even visiting family. First, many of them have already been\ndeported. And in fact, my grandfather, my mother's father, and his daughter went to\nWarsaw. It was a time that, for one reason or another -- I don't know how it was\narranged -- but it wasn't -- it wouldn't have -- it wouldn't matter. Because when I told you\nabout this Purim celebration, at this very crowded beautiful table, there is, there are only\ntwo people, me and my cousin, Renya (ph), who lives also in Los Angeles, who survived.\nAll of everybody there, all my -- Ciotka Dopcha (ph), Ciotka Hannah, Ciotka Sulcha\n(ph), Ciotka Peza (ph), and their husbands, and their children -- everybody was\nmurdered. On my mother's side, I had family in Tomachav (ph). And I was able, while\nwe were still in Lodz, to somehow go there, because I didn't look very typically like a\nJew. And we took some money, brought it to Tomachav in the hope that 1t would be\neasier to live there. So she had two small children. It was Paula Rosenblum and they\nperished, they perished. From my mother's side, I had a picture of the Ciotka Rucha (ph),\nwho perished in Warsaw, Ciotka Paula, who perished in Tomachav. And there was, in\nfact, a brother of my mother who lived in Amsterdam. And sure enough, he was taken to\nAuschwitz and murdered, with his wife -- and with his two small children. Now, we\nwere sure that he would be surviving. But he didn't survive even in Holland. They -- so,\nyou know, when you live in a place where there is death all around you when people are\nbeing deported, when you don't know what will be tomorrow, when everyday they can\ncome and take you to Kripo and murder you there, when you are starving, when you are\ncold, when, when, when there is disease, because there was typhus quite a few times in\nthe ghetto, you don't really think that there is something like a social life, you don't think\nthat there is something which would entertain you, or -- we never went to anybody's\nhouse. And the neighbors somehow were disappearing too. They were disappearing.\nAnd so --",
        "Q: Do you remember what you talked about when you were at home with your family?",
        "A: I was thinking about it. I was thinking about whether we talked. But we must have\ntalked, because my mother was -- one time, had a dream. I do not believe in, you know --\nI'm not superstitious at all. But she had a dream that she went someplace, and that she\nmet her brother, who was in Holland. I mean, he went to Auschwitz and she went to\nAuschwitz. I mean -- I mean, why she had this dream and how this dream came upon I\nreally don't know. And what did we talk about? Now, when --",
        "Q: Maybe we should stop a minute. Is that music still here?",
        "A: So the life was just -- 1t was to survive, to see that your family survived. And I feel that\nconsidering that we had, you know, this little -- little places where we could grow\nvegetables -- and I do not recall anybody stealing. And I remember kindness from the\nneighbor and, actually, kindness from the people I worked with. So I don't think that I --\n[ -- that it 1s a picture -- a rosy picture is el (sic). (pause) The way I saw it -- and I do not\nthink that it's something in my imagination -- but anyhow, from my experience -- and I\ndid not have any special standing in the ghetto, or any special influence -- but I, myself,\nexperienced a pretty high moral fiber. And the ... that's what I experienced.",
        "Q: Let me ask you; what kind of work did you do in the ghetto?",
        "A: It was actually desk work. There were -- we had to issue what was legitimaceje\nobiadove, which means -- there was a little booklet based on it. You got a stamp that you\ngot the soup. It was actually a part of the administration of the ghetto, which I was\nworking in. And it was a job like a bookkeeper's job. And we were issuing -- it was\ncalled legitimaceje obiadove, which means -- such a little booklet, where it was stamped\nwhether -- when somebody got his or her soup. And in order to be entitled to the soup,\nthey had to have this booklet. So that was my work in the ghetto. Before, I was working\nin the produce department doing similar work. And then I was transferred to that\ndepartment.",
        "Q: Is this where you met your future husband?",
        "A: Actually, he was the head of the office management in that department. He was very\nstrict. He was the first to come -- and he was standing there -- and if somebody dared to\ncome late -- he was just peering at that person, didn't say a word -- I don't think anybody\ncame late anymore -- and was very much respected for -- for his, I would say, noble --\nmaybe yes, noble behavior and so on -- integrity -- for his integrity.",
        "Q: Now, working in the food department, I would think, in a situation like the ghetto -- this\nis a pretty good job?",
        "A: It did not entitle me to any additional food, maybe sometimes a soup. But otherwise, I\ncould not get anything. In fact, I had diarrhea, and I needed some rice, and I approached\nmy future husband, and he refused because he had his reasons. I am not blaming him.\nBut it is very telling that I approached him, and he said, \"No,\" he can not give it to me.\nHe had such -- such strong conviction of what he can and what he cannot do -- he\nwouldn't give it to me. He wouldn't take it for himself either.",
        "Q: So you had no opportunity to --",
        "A: I had sometimes --",
        "Q: -- cheat a little?",
        "A: I had sometimes an additional soup, which I brought and gave to my parents. But\notherwise, I sometimes -- it was a time that I could -- when there were more potatoes in\nthe ghetto, I could get a few more potatoes. Then we were actually -- the worst -- we\nfound out that there was something growing -- I don't know exactly what it was -- it\nlooked like spinach or something similar -- and we were gathering it, and we were\ncooking that. So that was, of course -- every little bit was helpful.",
        "Q: Did people come to you and try to get favors?",
        "A: I was -- I wasn't the one who they knew. So they couldn't come to me for favors, because\nI am not -- I don't have the means to give anybody favors.",
        "Q: Were you aware of much corruption and bribery going on in the ghetto?",
        "A: I don't know whether I am an optimist, or I have a rosy outlook. I knew that somebody\nwho was working, let's say in the bakery, had more, could get some more bread. But --\nand somebody who worked in the police department could have some favors. Somebody\nwho worked in the Sonderkommando and had -- or helped -- was stationed in the\nKriminal Polizei, in the Kripo, for sure was able to get some favors, some more nutrition,\nand so on. If you needed medication, you had to go to the people who were connected to\nthe Polizei, who were either policemen, or something. They were able to\nbring some, which I -- when my brother was so very sick, you know, I got some\nmedication from them.",
        "Q: How?",
        "A: I knew somebody who knows somebody. And so, one time, I got some medication. And\nthat was in the very beginning. In the very beginning, we had -- it was easier to get\nmedication. At the end, it was nearly impossible. And maybe, I felt that it is a matter of\nfact that people who were associated with these places would have a little bit more\nnutrition. But nobody lived in a beautiful apartment. I don't think anybody -- maybe\nvery few -- had a bathroom. They were mostly latrines.",
        "Q: There weren't -- you went outside?",
        "A: Yes, we went outside. Most of the people were living in one room. See, it was a part of\ntown which was a part of town where very poor people used to live. So you know, there\nwere not -- I, you know -- so corruption. By the nature -- let's say there was a\nSonderkommando, who was very much in touch with the Germans -- I mean, not in touch\nbecause they were informers or something -- they were because they were supposed to be\nperforming certain duties. It was obvious that they had probably a little bit more food.\nBut all -- as I understood it, all was about food. They couldn't have much better living\nconditions, because they were not available -- maybe some people did have running\nwater and some people did not have running water. Many people did not have running\nwater.",
        "Q: Now, you worked in the food administration. Was this....",
        "A: A part of the food administration. But it --",
        "Q: You worked on these coupon books for --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- for people --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- but your department also worked on distribution to food sitters?",
        "A: No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: We had -- we never saw food. We never saw food. It was just a bookkeeping department.\nI never -- no food went through -- we were a part of the so-called Aprovisation\nDepartment. But we were the part, an administrating part, only of this -- of this coupons,\ncoupon books, and we never saw food. It never came to my office.",
        "Q: Did everybody get coupons? Did everybody get the same amount?",
        "A: Everybody who was working was getting a soup.",
        "Q: And people who were not working how did they get that?",
        "A: There was -- see, what was happening -- there was a certain amount of food which we're\ngetting besides the soup. And the food, which they were getting besides the soup, they\nwere getting. And if they were working, they were also getting the soup.",
        "Q: How did they get this, were there soup kitchens? I mean, how did the poor people --\npeople who were not working, how did they get food?",
        "A: In the Distribution Centers. They were -- everybody was entitled to a certain amount of\nfood.",
        "Q: They didn't -- they had coupons?",
        "A: It was called -- wait a minute. They were called -- they were cards. They were cards for\nfood. In fact, as I recall one instance after this deportation from -- when the Germans\nwere -- came to the ghetto and took the people out -- some people who were not\nexpecting to -- expected to be taken -- because they just were not so exact to what they\nwere saying they were going to do -- some people took some of the bread, or whatever,\ncards with them, and it was a hardship for the others.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a different question; do you think that women were treated differently in\nthe ghetto?",
        "A: No, no. It happened what -- it happens even now. The women were living longer. I\nthink that, physiologically, the women are equipped with -- because we are the\nchild-bearing species -- that we have certain -- this -- what is chemistry, or there is the\nglands, or something -- that we can survive easier than the men, because there were more\nwomen afterwards in the ghettos than there were men. But treatment -- I don't think that\nwe were treated differently. In fact, you know, in Europe, women were treated better, in\na way. I mean, it depends from what point of view you are looking of course, because\nthe man was the man of the house and the woman, you know, hair drop -- it was\ndifferent. So there were many women who were in professions. There were women\ndoctors. There were women chemists. I had a relative who was a chemist, a relative who\nwas -- had a kindergarten. And there were many doctors. And actually, I wanted to\nstudy biochemistry. That was my chosen profession which, of course, never happened.",
        "Q: More than -- did you think that there were women who were able to use their appeal, to\nget favors in the ghetto?",
        "A: Not that I was aware of -- not that I was aware of. If somebody, of course, worked close\nto the administration, there is a likelihood. For instance, I know, when people got\nmarried, they could have asked Rumchovsky to give them -- to give them something.\nBut I don't think so. I do not think so. I might have not come across it. But I don't think\nSO.",
        "Q: So how long were you in the ghetto?",
        "A: Until the very, very end, until nearly the last day, because I -- I don't have a tattoo.\nBecause when we came, the last transports -- they were so crowded that they didn't tattoo\nus. So it must have been very late in August already when we came. And we had\nextra -- an extra day for ourselves. What happened was that we were on the way which\nwe didn't know is Auschwitz. And we --",
        "Q: Well, how did -- but how did you even get rounded up; how did all of this happen?",
        "A: Okay. They were coming -- in the beginning, they thought we would go full of tyranny\n[terror]. But people didn't go full of tyranny [terror]. So the Germans started rounding\npeople up. They also came to our apartment. But we had the cellar, and we closed the\nshutters, and we went down there, we heard them. They were banging with their rifles in\nmany places. But it was that we could pull the bed there -- and it was not usually -- I\ndon't know whether they expected it -- but they banged it on the floor -- they did -- but\nthey didn't bang where we were. So we did it -- we did 1t whenever, which was probably\nvery, very often -- you know, it was -- we were in the cellar. And in fact, what\nhappened -- I have the picture of my cousin -- and his whole family was deported, and he\ncame to us. And unfortunately, I, my father, my brother, and Aros (ph) -- Aros must have\nbeen, maybe, seven years, or something like it -- and we don't have room for Fishek\n(ph) -- so -- but there was a shed. So we said, \"Fishek, we'll hide you there,\" and we hid\nFishek there. We got up in the morning, we looked in the shed, he was gone. So the\nGerman took him out from there. They were looking everywhere. They were looking\neverywhere. They were just -- just going through everywhere and herding people to go,\nherding people to go.",
        "Q: And this is in August, 1944?",
        "A: That was in August, 1944. And I -- this was -- like, I wish maybe -- I was thinking about\nhiding there. But we didn't have any food, and we didn't know what will happen. If we\nwould have known where we were going, we would have probably stayed in that ca....,\ncellar, maybe suffocated. But we would stay there. Now, with the transport --",
        "Q: What happened, how did you get there?",
        "A: Yes. So this extra day -- I have to tell you about it. So we were on the way to this\ngathering place -- and August was just a beautiful month -- and we saw very close where\nwe were supposed to be gathered. We saw, like, a little house or something. Anyhow,\nthere was a guard, a German guard, in front of it. But it wasn't a Gestapo. So we said,\n\"Can we stay there for a day?\". He said, \"Okay. But no more.\" So we took -- we took\nresidence for a day in that room. And I was so spoiled that, even in the ghetto, I had to\nhave my spoon. And we were there, and -- you know, in retrospect, you sometimes think\nonly, \"Did we survive? We didn't survive, right? We didn't survive. So what good was\neverything?\". But no. Maybe it's philosophical. And since life is not forever, this one\nday was also important, because this was the last day that we were a family and that we\nwere together. Aros was with us too. And that's why I think sometimes about this day.\nAnd I don't want to say, \"What good was it that they didn't survive?\". But they had to\nstay. And then we went. It was the most strange thing. I met my cousin and her mother\non the ground where we were waiting to be taken away to Auschwitz. And we stayed\ntogether, I and my cousin, until we were liberated, which was very lucky for both of us.\nShe claims that my spirit helped her to survive, because I was just -- when we were\nworking in Sasel, one time, we passed by windows which were lit, and there was some\nkind of a holiday, and she mentions to me, \"Look, we will never live like that.\" I said,\n\"What do you mean, Renya? Why not? Of course, we'll live like that.\" And she always\nrepeats it. And I think that it was the defiance, the defiance. I just wanted to defy the\nGermans, because I went to Auschwitz with pleurisy, which is water of the lungs. I had a\nbladder infection. I was very sick before we went to Auschwitz. And when I was lying\ndown naked on the ground in Auschwitz --",
        "Q: Oh, you probably --",
        "A: That's okay.",
        "Q: -- made your point for now?",
        "A: Yes, I made my point. I made my point. And that's not so much --",
        "Q: I just want to backtrack a minute because --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- | want you to tell me a little bit about how things were organized in the ghetto.",
        "A: Okay. Since I wasn't -- I was in a very, very small -- my job was administrative. But I\nhad nothing to do with food, I had nothing to do with distribution of food, or anything of\nthis kind. So I wasn't so close to the administration. But as a person who lived in the\nghetto from the very beginning to the very end, my assessment is that so it was hunger, so\nthere was deportation, so there were tragedies -- but there was -- somehow, we knew\nwhat is happening. There were hospitals. Nobody came back from a hospital with\ncontagious diseases. That's another story. But there were hospitals. There were\nhospitals also where children could go. There were hospitals where people -- if some --\nif there was a birth that they could go. There was certain civil safety. I mean, we were\nnot afraid that somebody would come into our house and rob us. There were very -- of\ncourse, some of the criminals were included in the early deportations. That's true. There\nwere prisons. There was a court. There were judges. There was a prosecutor. They had\nnames of everybody. They knew where everybody was living. There was a Department\nof Statistics. There was a Department of Distribution of Food. And within this\ndepartment was the Department of Produce. It was a department where they distributed\nflowers. There was a Department of Bakeries. Now, there was milk and coffee. I mean,\nthey knew exactly about how many people we had. I think that could have changed after\none of the deportations. But they knew. They knew about who has an apartment, or\nwhether there is an empty apartment. They knew who had died. So it was in this tragic\nconditions there was something that -- we, for instance, knew that there would be a\ndeportation. We, for instance -- besides, there were many rumors which, sometimes,\nwere not true. Very often, Rumchovsky had speeches and prepared us for certain things,\ncertain changes, or what have you. They were an instrument -- in the beginning, Rabbis\nwere performing ceremonies, if somebody, you know, got married. There were\ncircumcisions performed. Later on, when they -- when the Germans didn't allow it,\nRumchovsky was the one who married people. So for a very short time, there was even\nsomething, like -- on the marichian (ph) was something like a reserve for people who\nworked very hard. And one time, my brother had the privilege, and I took him there.\nAnd that was in the beginning. The ghetto became more and more less run by the Jewish\nadministration, and the Germans had more of a part. But this was at the time when Jews\nhad more to say about administration.",
        "Q: Was this -- do you think that this was positive that Rumchovsky and the Jewish Consul\nhad so much control over your lives?",
        "A: Considering the alternative, because if they would not be an order, if there wouldn't be\norder, if there would be dead people lying all over, if there would be a lot of crime, I\nbelieve the German wouldn't go for it, they would just close the ghetto.",
        "Q: So you thought he was a pretty good man?",
        "A: I -- besides that I saw him, I never met the man. But I'm, what I'm thinking -- in this\nabnormal condition, with enormous pressure of the German from the outside, with the\npopulation probably being very often not very happy with whats going on, to have this\nkind of an administration -- so that since we're taken care of, no matter -- no matter what,\nI think that people who survive the ghetto, if not for this kind of an administration, would\nnot survive it until August the 25, 1944, because the ghetto would have been closed. And\nif this workshops, would not be administered, administrated the way they are, they were\nthey were, the ghetto would have been closed also much sooner.",
        "Q: What workshops are you talking about?",
        "A: The workshops for the Germans, the workshops -- like, there was a leather workshop, and\nthere was -- there were all kinds of workshops which -- for which, you know, they were\npaid, and they could use the money to buy the food, and so on and so on, and -- I mean,\nthe administration -- the administration, not individuals -- everything, the administration.\nNow, you know, when you think today what's going on in certain countries, that, under\nthis awful circumstances, they had an administration who had everything in check, they\nhad powers -- of course, they had -- if they wouldn't have the powers, there would be\nwars there. Because if somebody wouldn't get enough food or something, no matter\nwhose fault, people would rebel. But there were no rebellions. Anyhow --",
        "Q: Did you get paid for your work?",
        "A: Not -- no. Whether I got -- okay. But --",
        "Q: All right. Why don't we pick up again where you were at the train --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- to get deported to -- you didn't know where --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- or anything --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- and you met your cousin --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and you got on the train.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Why don't you tell me about that journey?",
        "A: Yes. I told you about my mother. And I had enormous -- all -- I mean, respect and all.",
        "Q: Wait. You told me about your mother?",
        "A: Yes. I told you that she was beautiful and --",
        "Q: Oh, you have.",
        "A: -- that she kept everything so clean --",
        "Q: Right. Okay.",
        "A: -- and she would -- took care of me when I was sick. I took care of my brother. And she\nnever complained. And we went into this cattle wagon with all these packages, which\nthey deceitfully told us to pack, and she was sitting on the floor. I can sit on the floor. It\ndoesn't matter. But my mother sitting on this floor and being so unhappy -- it just broke\nmy heart. And aI said, she never complained. And it was so embarrassing. It was -- I\nmean -- and there was a little window in that cattle wagon, and people were trying to look\nwhether we are going. And, as I said before, the day was absolutely gorgeous, absolutely\ngorgeous. And here, she was, poor -- my poor mother was sitting on the floor and -- I'm\nnot sure -- it must have been the air there -- and I don't know what happened to the\nexcrements -- I think there was some kind of an opening or something. Anyhow, then\nthey slid the door open from the wagon, and we came out.",
        "Q: How long had you been riding?",
        "A: I do not recall exactly. I was just from Lodz to Auschwitz. From far away, it looked like\na place for the insane, because there was some wire around it and there were people\nrunning back and forth, back and forth, with shaven heads. And here, we had to come\nout, leave everything in the wagon. And then they told us to go to the left, to go to the\nright. And there was one Oberscharffuhrer at the head, closer to the camp. And he said\nto my mother to go to the left, and I went to the right. And not knowing, really, the depth\nof that tragedy, I still felt that it means that I'll go to work and she won't. So I run up to\nthe Oberscharffuhrer, and I said, \" Meine Mutter kann arbeiten viel besser wie ich,\"\nwhich was true, that she can work much better than I can. So he said, \" Du willst, sie\nschon sehen im abend, \" that I would see her in the evening. There were very deceitful,\nvery -- I mean, that this deceit was the smallest deceit -- I mean, because the one which\nthey did to get us out of the ghetto was a much greater deceit. Now, I was with my\ncousin and her mother, Tess (ph). She had lighter hair. My mother was already, partially\ngray. And we went in, and there was a second selection. We were supposed to\ncompletely disrobe, which we did of course -- we didn't have any other choice -- and that\nwe will go to the showers and -- there was something round -- and I was close to my\ncousin and her mother -- and all of a sudden, they took her mother out. It was a second\nselection. Of course, when she was undressed, they realized she is not in her 20s or 30s.\nIn fact, only one mother went with us, a Mrs. Kohn (ph). And what she went through in\nthe camps -- she was lashed and whipped so many times. But that's another story. Then\nwe, from there, there was -- they shaved our hair -- and I had long brown hair -- and my\ncousin, Renya, said, \"You know, I couldn't recognize you\" -- so I was calling, \" Tusa,\ntusa \" -- and so I came out and she saw me -- and they shaved our heads -- and we were\nnaked -- and we were supposed to lie down someplace on the ground to sleep overnight,\nwhich we did. Everything seemed completely insane. And miraculously, I awoke, I\ndidn't have my bladder infection. Then we were given some shoes, and I was given some\nshoes which had my foot, and we were given some clothes. And then I remember\nAuschwitz, I remember we were standing, one time, in line and I had some container\nwith some -- what was supposed to be soup -- and it was all, like, in a maze, what was\nhappening, what has happened, I mean. And what I see someplace, a sign, \" Arbeit\nMacht Frei.\" That was the sign in Auschwitz. And fortunately, we were there only a few\ndays. And everything seems like a very, very bad dream. And they were telling us that\ngoing out of Auschwitz to a working camp is a rather fortunate occurrence.",
        "Q: Who was telling you that?",
        "A: It must have been some other person -- people who were already -- have been there in\nAuschwitz longer. Some of them were incarcerated people.",
        "Q: Now, you were over in Birkenau?",
        "A: Yes, that was Birkenau.",
        "Q: So you talked to some of the people who were --",
        "A: Who were there before.",
        "Q: What else did you observe while you were there in those few days?",
        "A: The first impression was that it was some gathering of insane people. They just didn't\nlook normal. They absolutely didn't look normal. Their movement didn't -- wasn't\nnormal. That was my first impression when I went out of the wagon, and I looked to my\nleft, to my left and -- because we went out of the wagon, and then we were standing\nfacing this Oberscharffuhrer here. So then I was on the left side -- I mean, I was on the --\nmy mother was on the left, and I was on the right. So -- and then, as I said, it was like\na -- like a bad, bad dream, the whole thing -- it was so unbelievable, the movement of the\npeople, everything there. When I think about Auschwitz, I just remember, like,\nfragments because it was such an enormous shock. It was an enormous shock for, for\nme. And they took my mother away, and my father, and my -- and Aros and Lolick were\nalso taken away. I didn't know where they will be going. And I didn't realize what\nactually happened to my mother for a long time. Because, from there, we went to another\ncamp. My leg started swelling up. And we went to a camp in Hamburg. There, we were\nsupposed to be laying railroad tracks. And there were German woman, women who were\nour -- I don't know -- they were called Kapo. And in the morning, very early in the\nmorning, we have to stand in line. And there was a German SS, and he was pointing out\nwho's going and who's staying. In the beginning, I went. And in this camp, there was a\ndoctor. In most camps, there was a doctor. They wanted to have us, on one hand,\nprobably, fit, and on the other hand if not, eliminated. So this -- this doctor -- I ask her\nwhether I still have water on the lung. And she said, \"Yes, you have.\" And I had a cut\non my leg. So she put a very large bandage on my leg. And it so happened that, after I\nhad the bandage, in the morning, she, for a short time, pointed out for me to stay. Now,\nyou were asking whether I realized what happened. So what actually -- when I started\ngoing to work, it was very hard. It was very hard, to me, to climb on the wagon because\nmy legs were so swollen. But since it was very early, there were stars in the heaven, and\nI prayed. So I prayed for my parents, and for Lolick, and for myself. But -- so at this\ntime, I had no inkling what, actually, is happening to them, absolutely no inkling. And\nthen we were in Hamburg for quite a while.",
        "Q: What was the name of this camp?",
        "A: I remember only that it was Hamburg. I do not know any name of this particular one.",
        "Q: This was not Sasel?",
        "A: No, this wasn't Sasel. From this camp --",
        "Q: How long were you there for?",
        "A: It wasn't a very long time. But 1t was more than a month. From there, we were\ntransported to Sasel. And I, as much as it was, the conditions were not good -- this camp\nwas situated in a very woody area. And I am very sensitive to good air. And also, when\nwe came there, there were always accommodations that the doctor -- there was a doctor.\nSo when people came from work, they could come there. It was called the ambulance.\nActually, it's like an infirmary. And I approached this doctor and I asked her whether I\ncould work for her. And she says -- so she had chosen me to work for her. That also\nallowed me to recuperate somewhat. I had to work, I had to wash the floors, which no\nbig deal. It was a big deal for me then because, you know. But anyhow -- and when\npeople were coming, I was greeting them, I was taking reports, and I got -- they were\nsaying that I am very polite and friendly to everybody and -- now, this doctor wanted me\nto sleep with her -- she was afraid to sleep by herself -- which I did.",
        "Q: Was she a Jewish woman?",
        "A: Yes. She was from Czechoslovakia. She committed suicide after the war. And so that\nwas going on for a while. But then, for one reason or another, I guess she wanted me to\nsleep with her and somebody else wanted me to sleep in the barracks. But anyhow,\nsomebody else got my position. So I was going to work. When we were coming from\nwork, we had to stay at attention. And if there were any complaints about anybody\nduring the work of any kind, the person was whipped, and we had all to stand and watch\nit. And in the middle of this courtyard was something -- I don't remember -- some\nwooden contraption or something where the people were whipped. Now, one time, I was\nalso punished. And it was -- they claimed -- which I do not know whether it's true or\nnot -- but that I brought some meat. We were working someplace. Over there, we were\ndigging foundations. And at one time, we were carrying heavy stones, one giving it to\nanother in a line. And one time, we were called to a slaughter house. And they -- he\nclaimed that I took some meat into the camp. And I had a big speech. I spoke German.\nAnd I was just sentenced to clean the latrines, which -- I don't know whether -- I think I\nremember it right. I never felt -- I felt always defiant. I never felt -- even when I had to\nclean the latrines, I didn't feel inferior. This mother, Mrs.Kohn, has been unfortunatly,\nshe has been lashed and whipped so many times. So over there, one time, I was milking\nacow. We were working someplace and we saw cows there. So I was milking a cow.\nBut unfortunately, another girl was doing something similar -- I don't know whether it\nwas a cow or it was a bull -- and hit her. And it was tragic. There was not enough food\nand the coats -- the coat was a big problem. And one time, we walked -- worked --\nwalked to work, and we had wooden shoes. And the ice was building up on the shoes\nand building up on the shoes, and we stopped and wanted to get the ice off our wooden\nshoes. They wouldn't let us. And it seemed like it will never end. And I remember that,\nlater on, we used to say, \"If this walk ended, anything difficult will end.\" And --",
        "Q: I am going to have to stop you because you are alluding to a lot of things --",
        "A: Which you would --",
        "Q: -- that I want to ask you questions about.",
        "A: Good. Good. I am coming back.",
        "Q: First of all, this camp Sasel--",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- was it women and men?",
        "A: All the camps which I was in Hamburg, in Sasel, only women.",
        "Q: Was it large? Were there a lot of women?",
        "A: No. Sasel was not very huge. I couldn't tell you the numbers. But it wasn't huge. I\nmean, it was -- in comparison with Auschwitz, it was really small.",
        "Q: How many people were in your barracks?",
        "A: That is a very difficult question for me to answer. We were sleeping in the beds, like,\none, I on the top, and Renya on the bottom, or vice versa, I believe. And how many\npeople in the barracks? Wait a minute.",
        "Q: 20, 50?",
        "A: Wait a minute. 25.",
        "Q: When this woman doctor wanted you to stay with her, she just wanted companionship, or\nshe wanted --",
        "A: Just companionship, just plain companionship. She was scared too. She was, you know.\nShe was working as a doctor. But she was, you know. She was a prisoner. No, no. She\nwanted just -- because she was, scared. She probably lost her family and she was scared.",
        "Q: You don't remember, maybe, people sleeping together --",
        "A: No!",
        "Q: -- having sex --",
        "A: No!",
        "Q: -- or relationships?",
        "A: No, no, no, no! I tell you it's impossible. There was no drive for that. There was -- I\nmean, we were so devoid of energy, of desires. I mean, it was all -- what was important\nwas not to be so awfully cold -- the cold was very hurtful -- maybe not to be so very\nhungry, not to be whipped or hurt -- but nothing of this kind. She was just a nice human\nbeing and she was just scared. And at night, I'll tell you, my cousin was also scared, you\nknow. I mean, people were scared.",
        "Q: Where were most of the prisoners there from? Were most of them from Poland?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I think so. I think so. There was one girl who, who was whom, -- maybe who\nwas there from Germany -- but probably, she was in the ghetto. And that's how she got\nto the camp.",
        "Q: And the guards, or the Kapos; where were they from?",
        "A: There were Germans.",
        "Q: They were all German?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did -- well, getting back to strictly women-oriented issues, did you have your period\nthroughout?",
        "A: Fortunately, not. They said that they gave us something in Auschwitz, or something. But\nwe didn't have it. We thought that we'd never regain it. But we did regain it because we\nhave children. But, no, we didn't have it. And we were told that they were giving us\nsomething so that we shouldn't have the period.",
        "Q: That must have been somewhat alarming?",
        "A: Not really, because who would like to be bothered with that.",
        "Q: Did you have enough food there?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: Was it any -- was it better or worse than the ghetto?",
        "A: The ghetto fluctuated, you know? Sometimes, it was more. Sometimes, it was less. And\nat the end, there was only starvation. We didn't have enough food. For instance, when I\nsaw the cow, I milked her, you know. And when we went to the slaughterhouse, maybe\nI, you know -- I took some meat. We were getting some bread. We were getting some\nsoup. That's what I -- what I recall. And I recall that the hunger was bad. But the cold\nwas miserable.",
        "Q: One more question, and then we'll have to change tapes. You said you were laying\nfoundations?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What were they for?",
        "A: We didn't see the finished products. But there were some German civilians also who\nwere overseers. So there must have been something contracted by the SS, for some\ncompanies, I assume. Because there were some civilian overseers at that place.",
        "Q: Do you think they worked for the factory or housing, or you just don't know?",
        "A: I really don't know. But I don't think about the size of it. It's likely that it was not for\nfactories.",
        "Q: Were you aware -- well, when you were outside of the camp working --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- did you have any contact with the German people?",
        "A: We never have contact. But in Hamburg, one time, they were -- they were looking at us.\nBut we looked like criminals, because we had this shaven hair, shaven heads, and we had\nthese outfits, you know, special outfits, and we looked like prisoners.\nTape #3",
        "Q: At this time -- I guess it was the Fall of 1944 -- were you aware of Allied bombings in the\narea, or anything like that?",
        "A: Well, we were in Hamburg. Yes, yes. And we were not that happy about it. We didn't\ncare what would happen to us. And they were running to the shelters. And we really --\nwe really -- in Hamburg, any time we heard the raid, we were just very happy, because it\nwas a sign, you know, that something is being done about the Germans, of course, and\nthat the countries would be saved, from this tyrant. So we were happy about it.",
        "Q: It gave you hope?",
        "A: Maybe, maybe, yes.",
        "Q: You just said something -- that there was a real turning point, in your mental outlook\nfrom Auschwitz --",
        "A: Definitely, definitely. When you have your family, you first, you feel more like a human\nbeing. See, Auschwitz was very dehumanizing. You were not a person. You just were\nnot a person. And you felt it, that you are not a person. And since Auschwitz, they did\nsomething to us. So as I said, on one hand, I didn't feel inferior -- but I had it also say\nthat -- you see, there was a lot of where I was -- I knew that I could do something in the\nghetto. So when my brother was sick, I tried to bring him ice because ice was -- had to\nbe put on his heart. And I remember the person I was getting the ice from. He,\nafterwards, saw me. He was afraid to ask me what happened to my brother, because I\nwas so crushed. I could help a little bit. I could do something. I was still -- I was still a\nperson who had certain, certain -- I wouldn't say powers -- but I could help my father, I\ncould help my brother, I could encourage them, I could do something for them, I could be\nwith them. Now, when they took everybody away and -- I mean, we were not really -- in\na way, we were not really human beings. In a way, you know, you didn't -- certain\nfeelings were taken away, you know? And besides that, the type of, of, -- I couldn't call\nit life -- that wasn't life -- that wasn't life -- and we, but we probably -- I in particular,\nprobably believed that we will survive. I also believed that my brother will survive. I\nalso believed that Aros will survive. And, but Bergen-Belsen --",
        "Q: All right. You have to tell me how you got to Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A: All right. Now --",
        "Q: How long were you in Sasel?",
        "A: Very close to the end of the war, because I wasn't in Bergen-Belsen too long.",
        "Q: How did you -- how did you leave Sasel; what happened?",
        "A: They took us on trains. They were not cattle trains. And we were still standing in the\nstation, and I decided that Iam going to jump out of the window, which I did. And I\nasked my cousin, \"Come with me,\" because I knew there is some camp of some\nprisoners, Italians, and I think that maybe I can walk over there, or do something. This\nGerman girls overseers came up to me, picked me up, put me back on the train, and I was\nexpecting, the whole time, that I'll be punished or something. Nothing happened. Now,\nwe came to another hell, because Bergen-Belsen was like a dug up cemetery. There were\npiles, piles, over piles, of skeletons, one skeleton over the other skeleton, piles, a hill.\nWe were put into something that looked like a warehouse, lying on the floor. One time a\nday -- or I don't know whether every day -- they opened the doors, they whirled up\nsomething which was some watery soup. Now, people were very sick there. There was a\nlot of diphtheria. And I remember the latrines. And somehow, I probably had the urge to\nsurvive. So I don't know where I got -- I got some metal containers, one for me and one\nfor Renya. And when I heard the squeak of the opening door, I ran to the door, and I put\nthis container into this kettle. So I got some soup -- and I think I got for both of us --\nbecause they were not staying there very long, so not everybody got anything, you know?\nSo it was important to run there and to get the little bit of watery soup in the beginning.\nOtherwise, you didn't get anything. And there, you realized subconciously and\nconciously, that I will never see my mother, never see my dad. And just -- just lying --\nwe were just lying on this floor there day and night. Probably, when we had to go to the\nlatrine, we went out. We must have gone out, because we were able to see this -- this\npiles, piles, and piles, of skeletons, just skeletons, unburied. And they were throwing\nmore and more piling up more. And, that was Bergen-Belsen.\nAnd I remember when we were liberated, we were liberated by the British. There was no joy in\nmy heart. I understand they told us -- somebody told us not to run out too early, one girl\ndid, and she got shot. There was no joy what I was doing, I got some place, some paper\nand a pen, and I was writing. I write -- and I never thought that I should keep this\nwriting. I'm sure I wrote in Polish. And I wrote and wrote. And, then -- that was\nliberation. Fortunately -- unfortunately, they meant very well. Some people were taken\nto, like, a hospital or something. They meant well. But they wanted to share with us the\nfood, and they gave some chocolate and other things to people, who were starving for a\nlong, long time. And their stomachs couldn't take it. So they got diarrhea, and some of\nthem didn't make it. And then we must have been taken out of there. And we were still\nin Bergen-Belsen. But, of course, in completely different quarters, and with food and so\non, supplied by the British.",
        "Q: Do you remember when this was?",
        "A: Right now, I couldn't even think. It was 1945. And I think it was April, 1945. I just\ncouldn't think of dates.",
        "Q: So you were -- maybe only there a few weeks, or --",
        "A: I think I was there only a few weeks. I think I was there only a few weeks. That's what I\nthink.",
        "Q: When the British came in, were you inside this barn?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Then how did you know you were liberated?",
        "A: Probably, the screams, and they probably walked in, and we probably saw the uniforms.\nBut I know as much as later on, at that point, there was no happiness. Because after\nBergen-Belsen, I -- I knew, that my parents didn't survive. And there was absolutely you\nknow, maybe, seeing all these corpses, and I mean, you couldn't be happy about anything.\nI wasn't happy. However, once we were transferred to some human quarters, and I\nwanted to look for my brother. He was in Buchenwald. But he didn't survive. And I do\nnot know why. And I was sure that Aros would survive, because he was such a tough\nyoung, young boy. I don't know what happened to him. I have no idea. There's no way\nto find out anything right. I talked to people who knew my brother in Buchenwald. And\nthat's why I didn't stay long in Bergen-Belsen -- I mean, not -- this camp in prison -- but\nliberated Bergen-Belsen. But I went to Hamburg. I got some clothes there. I don't know\nhow I did it. And then I went to Hanover, because it was where I was asking\neverybody -- I was inquiring whether anybody saw Lolick, and whether they know, and\nmaybe he registered someplace or something. But, he did not survive. He did not\nsurvive. And so everybody, everybody from this enormous family was tortured, starved,\ngassed. And there is a story.",
        "Q: When you went -- you went to try to find some family, find your brother?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: It so happens that I met my present husband, Dave Klipp. And he was already -- at that\ntime, he was thinking positively. There were people who didn't have a -- who did not\nbelong anyplace. So he and some others contacted -- not the Nazis, of course, at that\ntime -- but the German authorities to form this KZ Ausschuss, so that we get some\nhousing, get some nutrition. Because there were cards at that time. There were\nnutritional cards. So I -- at that time, I actually stay stayed in Hanover, and I just didn't\nfeel like going to Poland, which I very much regret. And so from there, we started living\nwhat I would say is a much more normal life. I was together with Renya and there were\nsome other people who survived. And so there was already a social exchange. We\nalready cared that, how we get dressed, and how we look, and we got -- we got through\nthis KZ Ausschuss.\nWe got an apartment with some German person. I mean, it was her apartment. And her husband\ndidn't come yet from the war. So we were -- we were designated this quarters for us to\nlive in.",
        "Q: And she was there also?",
        "A: She was there also.",
        "Q: Wasn't that strange, living with a German after the war?",
        "A: She knew that she just has to let us live there, you know. She realized, you know. It\nwasn't really -- it was -- you see, there were not enough housing to give us -- later on, we\ndid get a house for ourself. But at this time, it was the best solution. Because, at least,\nwe lived in a normal apartment with a kitchen, and with a bathroom, and so on. At that\ntime, she realizes they are the, that that's the only way it will be for a while. When, her\nhusband came from the, back. He was rebeling. He was rebeling a lot. And then, of\ncourse, we got another place to live.",
        "Q: So this organization there gave you food coupons and --",
        "A: Yes. Because the Germans were also getting coupons. At that time, it was rationed.\nAnd we got an apartment, and we got -- we got food -- and we got some clothing, and we\nstarted what you would call the beginning of a normal life. Some people, you know --\nthat -- that's what was happening.",
        "Q: Was it difficult to resurrect yourself in a way?",
        "A: I have to admit that it -- I remember some extreme elation. Not in Bergen-Belsen. Not\nwhen I was -- but when I started -- when I left Bergen-Belsen to go to Hamburg -- I don't\nknow whether it started there or much later -- but I was so elated that I am alive. I just --\nmy cousin, Renya, was just, like, envious. I mean, she was happy about that. But she\nwas envious that -- I mean, I felt that Iam alive. And it was -- it was a elation for me\nto -- it -- I went through this grieving period for a while. And I was -- we were always\ngrieving, we were always talking about it, and so on. But this -- this absolute\ntransformation for being not even a human being -- and all of a sudden, being free --\nwhen I realized it, I was -- there was a period -- it didn't last forever -- but it was a period\nof great elation.",
        "Q: How long did you stay there with your cousin?",
        "A: Where?",
        "Q: In Hamburg.",
        "A: No, it was in Hanover.",
        "Q: Hanover. Sorry.",
        "A: We actually stayed there for a long time. We also were in Frankfurt for a while. And\nyes, the reason we stayed so long in Germany was we wanted to leave Germany as soon\nas possible. There were too many memories and you never knew to whom you're talking.\nBecause if they told you that they always were buying into your stores -- or something\nlike that -- then you know: \"Watch out.\" Then we didn't want to -- but anyhow, Dave\nhad a sister in the United States, in New York. So actually, they were doing something to\nsend us status. However, I had no pleurisy in the ghetto and also in the camps. And so I\ndidn't have the pleurisy when I was liberated just miraculously. On an x-rays, there were\nshadows. And the United States, very rightfully, didn't want to let people in with\ntuberculosis. They would have let somebody in with pleurisy, because it's not\ncontagious. So I had a very hard time, to, until they declared me. It took a long time\nbecause -- we came here in 1950, liberated in 1945 -- until I got a clearing that I can go.\nAnd that's why it took so long for us to come here to the United States.",
        "Q: So you and David got together pretty soon in Hanover?",
        "A: Yes. Well, we got married in 1946, March 16th. And you know, the lady in whose\nhouse we lived, who we met afterwards -- she just couldn't believe it, that we got\nmarried. You see, there is a big age difference between David and me. But it really --\nhe's -- I mean, he's a young man. So he now believes that he's -- am I on tape still?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Oh!",
        "Q: You know, one thing that's confusing to me -- I've never heard this before about both you\nand your husband -- 1s -- I didn't realize, that you were sort of operating with German\nauthorities, as opposed to with British -- the British military Government or the American\nmilitary Government.",
        "A: All right. Now, we got the British Government -- and that was a UNRR, UNRR -- they\nwere also helping. Now, I don't know whether KZ Ausschussz was later. Formed later. I\nwould have to check with Dave exactly where it was -- where it was formed. Because in\nthe very beginning -- I have a picture with La Guardia. And yes, in the very beginning.\nThis happened later. That's what -- what we are telling you about the KZ Ausschuss. It\ndidn't happen immediately after the end of the war. It didn't happen immediately.\nBecause at this time, we were being sent supplies from the United States to the UNRR,\nand La Guardia came, and, since I was involved in with the distribution center of the\nfood -- but this was food given directly to people -- and La Guardia came -- and there's a\npicture of him with me -- he was so shocked when we were telling him what was actually\nhappening. So in the very beginning, there were not so -- the people started coming, you\nknow -- more and more people started coming. And then when -- that's how, that's how I\nremember it -- because in the beginning, we weren't old. That was -- the beginning, we\nwere on Auerstrasse (ph), and food was coming, yes, to the UNRR.",
        "Q: And you got involved in food distribution?",
        "A: Yes. I was working together with others and we were -- yes.",
        "Q: When you were in these camps and you were with your cousin, do you remember what\nyou talked about?",
        "A: We wanted to keep our sanity. So when we were digging this foundations in Sasel, we\nwere doing some algebraic in the sand. We were doing square roots, when we had a little\nbit of time. And um.... See, we were going to the same school. She's a little -- she was a\nlittle -- in a little bit older class than I. So this, we remembered. That we had a little bit\nfree time, and we were were doing the algebretical roots. So you know to keep the\nsanity.",
        "Q: Did you think about religion at all; did you pray?",
        "A: I never stopped praying -- I think that I never stopped praying. I do not pray -- I mean, I\nchange the way I pray. Very frequently, and I pray with my own words. But I don't\nthink -- I might not have prayed in Bergen-Belsen. I might not have prayed. But I\nprayed in Hamburg, because I remember it. And, I don't know whether it 1s, has\nsomething to do with my upbringing, or whether it has something to do with my\nspirituality. And I think that we have certain powers. Maybe powers is too strong a\nword. But we were -- in the worst of times even, we have some abilities. Not in\nAuschwitz maybe. Not in Bergen-Belsen. But we have some abilities. We have -- and I\nthink they are, maybe -- you could say they are God-given. And so I keep praying. I\nkeep praying. I keep -- actually, my way of praying is, if this 1s important, a way of\nthanking God for what I want to have.",
        "Q: Let me ask you one more question. And if there's anything you want to add. Have you\nthought about what sort of long-term impact these experiences have had on you, and, and\nhave influenced the way you are today?",
        "A: It is absolutely miraculous. I went, in the very beginning, after in Germany, through\nsome times which I was very -- I may be depressed, nervous, and so on. It's likely that,\nhaving been blessed with two sons and two daughter-in-laws and four grandchildren, and\nhaving worked also on my physical and emotional health through things like yoga and\nothers, I am, actually right now, in a very good, very good place emotionally. Because I\ncould talk about it and I could -- when my husband was testifying at UCLA [University\nCalifornia-Los Angeles], there's no way I was able to testify. It still -- when I think about\nit, even about testifying, especially about the ghetto, I was having butterflies in my\nstomach. However -- and I cannot watch any -- anything on television about the\nHolocaust. And when I watched the first time when there was a Holocaust story, I was\nsick for quite a long time because I have a visual memory. And when I hear something,\nit doesn't affect me so much. But when I saw it, I cannot see it. I cannot see. And I try --\nsince I don't do any good to anybody and I have my responsibilities -- so I try not to look.",
        "Q: Can you think of how -- could you talk about it after the war?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It took you a while?",
        "A: Yes, we couldn't talk about it. In the beginning, we just could not talk about it. And I\ncouldn't talk about it for quite a long time. And, my son was always -- when I started\ntalking quite recently, he was, was, like -- in a way, he was pleased that I talk about it.\nHe'd be very surprised that I was able to testify, with pretty much of a composure,\nbecause I -- Dave was talking -- my husband -- I couldn't -- I was always, want to protect\neverybody from everything. Now, I have a little number which I was wearing in the\ncamps. And my granddaughter wants it, she said, \"Don't give it to anybody,\" she wants\nit -- so probably -- I will show it to you -- probably when she will ever eventually give to\nthe Holocaust Museum.",
        "Q: Can you think of any other way that these experiences have affected the way you've lived\nfor the last 50 years?",
        "A: What really affected me is my upbringing. I was brought up to respect elderly people --\nand I don't forget that I am one of them right now -- I was taught to be honest. I was\ntaught that you're supposed to be charitable. We never were taught to hate. And I think\nit's not so much the experience. But the way I was brought up, there are certain things I\njust would not do. I wouldn't do it. Because this period of time -- of course, it is a big --\nit's not a void -- a hurt -- my main concern 1s actually whether when my -- especially, my\nmother -- my father, of course, too -- when they went into this gas chambers, whether --\nhopefully, they didn't suffer too much -- that is my very, very important concern. And I\ndo not want to investigate too much. Because I don't off -- on the one hand, in the\nbeginning, I was hoping it was instantaneous. But I understand it was not instantaneous.",
        "Q: What are we looking at, Estelle?",
        "A: This is a photograph taken in a spa which we spent the summer in. And there is my dear\nmother, Hannah Ryba Weingarten (ph), my dear father, Yakaf Weingarten (ph). And\nthere is my dear, handsome brother, Herschlipe Weingarten (ph), we called him Lolick.\nAnd that's me next to my mother. I was about five years old. And let me remember them\nthe way -- the way -- the way they were here, and not think that they were gassed in\nAuschwitz.",
        "Q: What are we looking at?",
        "A: Oh. This picture was taken in Portumbina, where we had a summer home. And I am\npicking up the balls and my brother, who is at the right, is playing with -- and his name is\nLolick Weingarten -- he is playing with Fishek,\nmy cousin. I mentioned his name because, before going to Auschwitz, after his family was\ndeported, he came to us and we tried to hide him. And there was no room in our cellar\nfor him. And there were already five people. And we hid him in a shack. But\nunfortunately, the SS found him and took him to Auschwitz a few days before we went to\nAuschwitz.",
        "Q: What year do you think this picture was taken?",
        "A: I must have been here, maybe, 10.",
        "Q: So the early 1930s?",
        "A: Yes, it would be in the early 1930s. (pause) On this photograph, on the left, standing, is\nFelka (ph), my cousin, Felka Weingarten. And on the right is Ritcha (ph), Ritcha\nWeingarten. And I am in front of Felka, and my brother, Lolick Weingarten, is in front\nof Ritcha. Unfortunately, Felka perished in the Holocaust and Ritcha, her husband, and\nher baby, perished in the Holocaust also. Rest their memory. (pause) This is my aunt,\nPaula Rosenblum, a sister of my mother's. She perished in the Holocaust together with\nher husband and three small children. (pause) This is my aunt Rucha Bondrypa (ph), who\nplayed her piano beautifully, and she perished in Warsaw during the Holocaust.\n"

        "A: It is Estelle Klipp right now. But I was born Estella Gippsa Weingarten (ph). And I was\nborn in Lodz on Savatzka (ph) number 40 -- and in the year 1922, January 10th.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: It was beautiful. It was a vary large family. My parents, sisters, and brothers -- I mean,\nmy mother had about seven siblings. And my father, the same. And for instance, on\nPurim we're gathering all of us in the house of my grandma. And it was.....",
        "A: Now, as an example, for instance, on Purim we were all gathering at my grandma's\nhouse. It was grandma Weingarten. And it was extremely festive, you know. On Purim,\nyou bring schlackamonies. So there were just beautiful cakes, and what they call torte,\nand there was fruit. And everybody gathered there, all my cousins, and all my aunts and\nuncles. And usually, it lasted -- there was one cousin who played the violin. And that\nwas Itzic (ph) Weingarten. And then we -- it was very nice for us children because we\nhad to stay up longer. And then when we came to our house, the manager of the house\ncame out, and we have to ring the bell, and he opened the gate. And for us children, it\nwas a big happening coming so late. And he -- and it was Purim. But it must have been\ncold because he was coming out with a fur coat. And it was a good life. We were to our\ngrandma's we surely went by druzka, which was a horse -- horse-drawn carriage. And\nthere was always a lot of fun too. We met the cousins. There were my aunts. And in the\nsummer, in the beginning, we used to go to a spa, like Rainitza (ph), or Rapka (ph). And\nlater on, we built a house in Portumbina (ph). And it was one -- there were, like, four\napartments. And one was ours, and the other one we use to rent out. In fact, I have a\npicture in front of it. It was beautiful there too. And we were spending the vacations\nthere. So life was pretty normal and very much based on family. I was going to school.\nIt was called gymnasium imienia Hochsztajnowei. And it was a lovely school. It was so\nbeautiful there. In our auditorium, the floor was like a mirror. And when we came to\nschool, we had to change shoes. And we often had concerts in school. We had the grand\npiano. And there was often -- Chopin was often being played. When I hear Chopin now,\nI remember it. And my brother was going also to a school. And in the afternoon, he had\nto go to a parochial school to learn more Hebrew and so on. And we used to play. I\nremember we played train, I and him, in the house when our housekeeper put the chairs\nin the middle so that she could clean them. And there were holidays. There were\nbeautiful occasions. There were summer outings. There were picnics. And all of a\nsudden, like a lightening from the sky actually, everything changed. And, of course, we\nhad no idea that anything like that could actually happen. And so there were actually\nclouds in the sky. There was bunchen where the people from Germany were coming.\nBut somehow, when you live a normal life, you just don't think and don't believe of such\na possibility. My father did -- after the Germans entered Lodz, he predicted certain -- I\nmean, even before, he predicted certain things. And I asked him, \"If that's what you\nbelieve, why aren't we leaving?\". First, there was no place to leave. And then you have\nreally to have guts and you have really -- to be able to leave. But there was no place to\nleave. Nobody wanted us.",
        "A: Yes. We actually celebrated all the holidays. And my father was rather religious. He\nwas -- at the same time, he spoke French and he spoke German. He was a wizard in\nmathematics. And, of course, we had a business. The business was on Ostrowska 10 and\npolizei station. And it was Golontaria Emenya Weingartenya (ph). And everybody in\nLodz knew that place. And today, I sometimes meet people here even in Los Angeles\nwho said, \"Of course, we were going there.\" We had a very good name. Everybody was\nsafe because in Lodz, at that time, you didn't have prices on any articles. But they knew\nyou could send a check to that store and they would be treated fairly.",
        "A: If somebody is familiar with the Silk Shop, which used to be in Los Angeles, it was very\nsimilar. There were wools, and lace, and buttons, and gloves, and hats, and -- I mean, all\nkinds of things. And it was in existence for a very long time, until the Germans took the\nkeys away. And so my father's family was more religious than my mother's family. But\nwe celebrated all the holidays. And our Passover was just fantastic. It was so beautiful\nand -- it was so beautiful, I remember that we -- I used fall asleep finally, because it\nlasted so long. But all the -- it was just beautiful.",
        "A: You asked me about the school, sorry if I interrupt?",
        "A: It's very interesting. We lived in a Jewish community. The manager of the apartment\nhouse was not Jewish. And in our summer house, the keeper of the grounds was not\nJewish. And some of the housekeepers at my grandma's house were not Jewish. But, in\ngenerally, we were actually -- we thought that everybody was Jewish. Yes.",
        "A: It was a very large Jewish community. Lodz was -- I understand there were 250,000\nJews or more. It was a textile in the street there and it was called the Polish Mattress\nStash. And so when some of this -- of the big industrialists in textile were going to our\nschool. It was Vininsky (ph), Korn (ph), and others.",
        "A: Oh, we felt it. Somehow we did feel it. We knew that it exist. We felt it much more\nbefore -- after Hitler came into power and after the death of Marshall Pilsudski. That\nreally felt 1t and I remember one program. We went to the summer house all the father, I\nand Lolick (ph) and when we came back my mom was petrified, terrified standing at the\nwindow because she had a feeling which I will always remember because she knew there\nis a program and -- but we were able to somehow safely reach our house. And there was\nsome times such a underlying fear of certain things which I as a child could sense and it\nhad much to do with anti-Semitism. That .... did that answer your question?",
        "A: Yes, and it, your question actually right now is how it was before the war? See, that\nschool I was going to was a private school and I started the school from the first grade\nand then I was maybe fortunate because I gained one year to graduate and they -- I had\nmy papers graduation papers. I thought they were very important. Dave, my husband,\nsaw them and when we went to Auschwitz I thought it would be helpful. I put it in my\nstocking. But of course, it wasn't helpful. I could get a copy, I think, if I would write to\nWarsaw, but it's not -- not really important right now. So it was -- it was actually a good\nlife. It was a Jewish life. We also had very high morals and ethics. And I remember that\nwhen the Germans came and we had to wear the yellow star I was, nothing to it as I was\nconcerned, but I had a friend, Genya Finkelstein (ph), who was from a little bit more\nassimilated home and she didn't want to go out I said, \"Genya, they're doing it to us.\nThey are the perpetrators. Let them be ashamed. Why should we be ashamed to wear the\nstar?\" And it had something to do with the upbringing I received in my house and we\nknew much about charity. My father used to always to say \"It's not enough to give. It's\nimportant how you give.\" I know when there were some relatives not close relatives who\nneeded help. There was always help ready for them and every Friday night my father\nwas bringing from the House Of Prayers a guest which is called the orrach, and he was\nsitting with us at the table and when we finished the meal he was given a bag of food to\ntake with him and nobody asked him any questions. It was a charitable atmosphere in\nour family. For instance, my grandmother one time somebody stole silver spoons and her\ndaughter says, \"Don't let htm in anymore.\" She says, \"Look, if he wouldn't have needed\nthe spoons, he wouldn't have taken them.\" So considering the high ethics and high\nmorals it was inconceivable for us to think that such atrocities which followed later on\nare possible that we had to prepare ourselves, but there was no way to prepare ourselves\nanyhow.",
        "A: I knew of their existence. I knew of their existence. However, in -- in retrospect I know\nthat it was -- actually the right thing to do. Because if you have an idea, no matter how\nimpossible it seems at the certain time what should actually follow it? Because the first\nthere is an idea always and there are deeds following it. But because of the background\nand because of the school I was not involved in it. I remember a certain time somebody\nwanted to -- to -- me to join, but I didn't.",
        "A: Yeah, it was a very, very frightening thing. They put up some --",
        "A: It was in 1939 and it must have been already in September. And some gallows were put\non in Lodz and some Jewish men were hung and they were very much interested that as\nmany as possible people would see it. When they entered Lodz they somehow wanted to\nharass and abuse the Jewish men, so there were, let's say, a knock in our house and they\nwanted my father. People who were taken to so called work were not taken actually to\nactual work. Some people were, for instance, bringing furniture up the set floor and the\nothers were suppose to take it down and so on. It was just shear harassment. Shear\ntorment. Shear like they wanted to demoralize us and what was happening was my father\nwas still going to the store and I was afraid that he'll be picked up and harassed, so I was\ngoing with him and he called me his angel. I had long brown hair and somehow I was\nvery often able to talk the German out of letting him go. I remember that one time we --\nthey brought us into a court yard and they left. And -- but it was a very frightening time\nbecause it was a very unsure time because -- and what was so tragic about it the Germans\nactually could not recognize who is a Jew and who is not, but there were Polish children\nstanding on the street and pointing out to the Germans who is Jewish and considering that\nthey were just having been occupied by the Germans and why did they do it? You know,\nvery often I'm thinking about it. Where does all this, I mean, it's -- it's based on -- on the\nteaching unfortunately of the church which I hope is being changed. But in Poland it will\ntake a very, very long time until it would be changed. I heard somebody saying that he\ngot this feeling of a stygmatism with the milk of his mother. Because -- and as I\nunderstand, that the church, the -- anyhow the Catholic Church since Pope the 23rd, is\nrealizing that the roots, a lot of the roots of this tragedy actually started with the people of\nthe church. Because it can teach hatred and there have been changes in their liturgy and\ntheir changes are -- are going on. I'm sure there are many, many Christians of very good\nheart and I'm glad that there is from the Vatican some directions now to change the\nliturgy.\nelse was happening on the streets at this time?",
        "A: It was especially -- for instance, 1t was so dangerous that my parents decided to send\nLolick, my brother, to a smaller city where his closest friends were living. In the hope\nthat he would be spared, but he came back after awhile because things were just as bad\nthere. There was also much more difficult to get fuel. Much more difficult to get food,\nSO we were living in one room in order to save fuel. We could sometimes -- of course we\ncouldn't get the amount of food which we needed, but we still could get some food. It\nwas dangerous to get out of the house. It was dangerous to be in the house because they\nwere just coming in and pulling you out.",
        "A: The bombings were in the short period before the Germans came in. In fact, we went to a\ncellar. We -- you know, there were cellars where people were keeping the food to keep it\ncold and we were hiding there because there were some raids. That was in the period, the\nshort period, before the German army actually entered Lodz.",
        "A: Yes, they were harassing people and one day when I brought my father to the store some\nGermans approached him and told him they wanted the keys to the store. We just had to\nhand it over. Now, we probably were expecting it and were bringing certain materials\nfrom the store and hiding it under the hardwood floors and we hid there also some\nTorahs. Maybe I'll mention it later, but when we were in the ghetto the manager, we\nassume, or we actually know that the manager of that apartment house informed the\nGerman about it and my brother was taken to the Kripo and from the Kripo he had to go\nto our apartment house and to -- to show them where everything is and they removed\neverything. And it was -- you know, it was a very -- it was a very dangerous, dangerous\ntime because there were shootings. There were shootings at that time and this -- this\nconstant harassment, you don't know whether a person would go out on the street or even\nfrom his house and he would come back alive because the torture was quite perverse.",
        "A: We must have stayed in, but they were also coming into the house. I remember one time\nwhen they came and we hid my father in the bathroom, but it didn't help. We had to\nshow them where he is and they pulled him out. And he wasn't -- he was very spiritual\nand he was very learned, but he wasn't a strong man, a very strong man physically. But\nhe actually survived at Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Yes.",
        "A: First they liquidated all our stores. We couldn't own any stores. I'm sure there was a\ncatch for us. The amount of food we could get was limited. Of course, I couldn't -- the\nschools were closed. Our schools were closed. We had -- we had -- actually, the minute\nthey came in we were prisoners. We were prisoners and as an example of it they were\nputting up gallows and, you know, hanging people. And, our dignity was taken away -- I\nmean, it my -- the way I feel it, my dignity was never taken away. Not even in\nAuschwitz. I never felt inferior to them. It could be with the teaching of -- the teaching\natmosphere of my house I felt that the ones who do the wrong they should be ashamed of\nmy -- of themselves and when I heard somebody say that he felt inferior during this time\nit struck me actually because I -- I never felt inferior. Never.",
        "A: Right away. Right away, but the taking out of the -- I mean, the -- asking for the keys of\nthe store because I remember I was still taking my father to the store for a short time and\nbefore he had to hand over the keys.",
        "A: We were fairly terrified. It was, they were a very terrified times. Very terrified time.",
        "A: There was no way. There was absolutely no way. You live a normal life and something\nwhich is beyond your many imagination happens you cannot prepare for it. There was no\nway to prepare there were some very very rich people who were somehow able to -- to\nreach a different country. However, even the people of Germany who would have left\nGermany couldn't. There was no place to go. Even -- even a ship was -- a ship was sent\naware form the shores of the United States. The white paper was issued and there was no\nentrance to Palestine. Otherwise, some people could have maybe reached Palestine. No\nother country would have opened the door, so, I mean, we were just boxed in.\nCompletely boxed in. And, so some people did leave to Russia, for Russia. And a friend\nof my -- the closest friend of my brother left for Russia and survived, and he asked, he\ncame to our house and asked my father's permission that Lolick should go too. And I do\nunderstand my father on -- on -- in a way because he said we all should stay together.\nNobody could have predicted what would happen and he said no. And Lolick was an\nextremely -- first he was absolutely gorgeous. He was so handsome that when he was\nhelping out sometimes in the store people would say \"Go to that store just to take a look\nat that guy because he's so handsome.\" Then he was extremely talented. As a child he\nwas curious how the grandfather's clock is working. So he took it apart and when he\ncouldn't put it together he used a string, but the clock was working. I mean, by losing\nhim, of course I lost a brother, but the world lost something too. And when we\nconsidered all these people who were burned, gassed, tortured, murdered, the world lost\nsomething too because they were scientists and they were future doctors and they were\nfuture physicists and they were just people who learned from childhood, charity. And\nthat you are not living only for yourself, but you're living only for others.",
        "A: Um --",
        "A: Yes. There were announcements that we better go to the ghetto or else they'd be shooting\nus.",
        "A: That was in 19 -- 1940. It was maybe six months after the Germans entered Warsaw. I\nguess when we went to the ghetto it must have been somehow the beginning of April and\nthey -- so we just had to go because otherwise, we would have been killed. And\nfortunately there was a neighbor of our's who was very helpful because she said she had\nsome kind of a wagon and why don't we go with her? So we packed some belongings.\nNot much of furniture and we went. It was very very traumatic. I was a pretty pampered\nchild. I wasn't a child anymore, I was 17. But I was pretty pampered and I couldn't take it\nso I kept fainting and there was no, there were only lavoratory -- there was no, you know,\naccomadations for bathrooms or anything like that. And I remember we stayed there and\nthen Ciotka [aunt] Hannah (ph) came and Uncle Moshe (ph) came and we all were\nsleeping on the floor and then some how somebody told us about the room of the\nFresetska (ph) eight. I think 1t was the same neighbor and that was one room. We lived\nin this room and that was my father, my mother, my brother, myself and later on during\none deportation there was also Ottos. Ottos --",
        "A: The time was very limited.",
        "A: Yes, and the amount of things we could take on this wagon was also very limited and, of\ncourse, we didn't have anybody ecspecially to help us, but anyhow I remember when\nthe -- I remember that we had a bed. And I remember that we had one piece of furniture\nwhich must have come from our kitchen. We had also a table and we had chairs and the\nroom wasn't very large and what -- when ever I think about that place on Fresetska eight,\nwho wasn't -- which wasn't very big and was the kitchen and everything was in this one\nroom, I have to give an enormous credit to my wonderful mother because it was\nextremely clean. Always, extremely clean. We're cooking there and sometimes I think\nabout it, how was she able to keep this place such meticulously clean. And later on after\none deportation Ottos, our cousin, was adopted by us. I think it had to be done so that\nthey have his name in the register so, that's why he was really adopted. And he came to\nus with a skin disease and my mother bathed him and cured him and my father got\ninfected and she bathed my father, and she cured him. And my mother was absolutely a\nvery remarkable women. She was very beautiful. She found a job for herself, by herself.\nShe was doing some -- some working with a sewing machine. She cooked where ever\nthere was some food to cook. She keeped everything clean and I know that at a certain\ntime she was going to sick people and she was washing them. She was washing their\nbodies. And thats why the tragedy of -- when ever the tragedy was touching my mother\nshe never complained, but it was very very painful to me and -- if I think about the time\nwe were taken to the Kripo. Kripo was the Kriminal Polizei. They were actually having\na building within the ghetto and since we were considered well to do in the ghetto, I\nmean, before -- they assumed that we had some valuables which they wanted to have.\nNow first 1t was only my father who was being taken to the Kripo. We were just petrified\nof the thoughts that they were going to take him and whether he would come back. Many\npeople didn't come back from the Kripo. The Jewish authorities were notified to take the\ncorpse away from Kripo. My father never disclosed anything and the strength his -- his\nspiritual and strength to be able to take the -- because they were actually whipping and\nhurting him and he came back and he didn't disclose anything. One time, they took my\nmother and I remember exactly. I was standing there when they took her and fortunately\nthey came later on for me because I was very much afraid about her not that that I could\ndo any help. I remember I walked into the Kripo, the cellars, in the cellars, there were\nthe torture chair -- there were the cells, where we were kept and in the back were the\ntorture chambers. So when you were sitting in the cellar you could hear cries and\nscreams. And -- but when I walked in there and this head of the Kripo, I think his name\nwas Stutar (ph), was standing there and I laughed. I was laughing in his face and he says\n\"Das Lachen wird dir hier vergehen,\" which means \"The laughter will stop here. Your\nlaughter will stop here.\" And I was also taken to the -- to the chambers and I was also\ntortured, but not to a degree that, you know, that I had to be hospitalized or something\nlike that. And finally, I don't know how it happened that they were -- released us. It --\nthe whole time we were in the ghetto, there was always an enormous fear that we would\ngo to the Kripo. And I remember when my father was in Kripo, when I was very\nconcerned that he is not coming back, and he is not coming back. I went to his brother's\nhouse. The brother was already deported. But his two sons -- one son was there. And\nthe son was very religious. He was the one who was playing the violin so beautiful. And\nhe was a real genius. And he says he was very religious. He said to me, \"Look. It's\nFriday night, and we didn't light the candles yet. So until we light the candles, he might\nstill come back.\" I just remember what he was saying. Even in the ghetto, we tried to\nremember when it's Friday. And on certain holidays, we made some -- mother prepared\nsomething from the grass, or from the leaves, or something which was appropriate for\nthat particular holiday. Now, you want to ask me something?",
        "A: No, no. Now, the problems in the ghetto were hunger, lack of fuel. But the worse of the\nworse was, the constant, deportations. And you could never be sure that, what is not\nbeing deported. And -- but there was one deportation, in particular, which was done by\nthe Germans. The other deportations -- when they hit somebody, of course, it was very\ntragic. So we really did not know for sure what was happening to us, and nobody thought\nthat we were going to places that they would gas us in some wagons. In the beginning,\nthey are telling us, they are taking people to work. And there was a small number of\npeople who were deported from the ghetto for the purpose of working in Germany, or in\nthe territories. In fact, one of my cousin, who was pretty husky, came back one time\nfrom a working camp. But they took him -- after a very short time, they took him again.\nI don't know whether to a working camp. Very likely, yes. But it was torturous work.\nSo we did not know. We actually had no inkling that a deportation means being taken to\ndeath, or gassed, or murdered. And this Germans were master of deceit. Before they --\nthe deportation to Auschwitz, there were loudspeakers. And I don't know who, in\nparticular, it was. But 1t was people. And they were assuring us that we should take\neverything we possibly can with us, because we are going to a better working camp. And\nI remember that my brother was working very hard to pack everything possible. They\nsay, \"Take pots and take pans, because you are going to a better place\" -- and I was sick\nalready at that time. So I was just watching them. But they were packing. Now, the\ndeportation -- going back to the deportation. There were always deportations. There was\na list made, which in view of what happened -- this was, I think, '42, September -- the\nalternative -- the other alternative was very -- was terrible. They just -- I am -- they just\ncame into the ghetto with trucks and with wagons, they ordered a gehsperren, which\nmeans, you know, a curfew -- they ordered a curfew and they said that they would take\nall elderly people, they would take children, and take -- we are -- if anybody would hide\nin the apartment, they would be shot. What I did -- I knew -- my mother was actually in\nher 40s. But she already had gray hair. And I was very much afraid for her, that they\nwould take her. I don't know how I did it. But I took her to the part of the ghetto which\nthey already were searching and taking people away, and I hid her there. But I had to run\nback because there had to be a certain amount of people present in the courtyard for them\nto do the selection. And then I went back and brought her home. Now, that was a\nterrifying time, because they were shooting anybody who, let's say, approached a wagon,\nor run to a place that they didn't want to, or whatever. They were all shooting. They\nwere just shooting. They were taking some people who were younger. They did not\nreally select only the older, the elderly, ones. It was one of the most traumatic, terrifying\ndeportation. So there's no excuse for anything. However, maybe because none of my\nfamily was deported -- so I'll tell you in a few minutes about my brother. In comparison\nwith the alternative, the alternative would have been -- I'm talking about the list -- the\nalternative would have been that they would enter the ghetto and just shoot whomever\nthey wanted and drag whomever, which was of course much more frightening to begin\nwith. And we didn't know and no one knew that we are going, just like we didn't know\nabout Auschwitz, which I am very surprised that the Poles or somebody from the outside\nwould not somehow give us, because they knew. They knew where Auschwitz was, and\nthey knew what was going on in Auschwitz. Anyhow, one time, my brother was about to\nbe deported. What happened -- my mother was at her sister's, and I was home, and that\nSonderkommando came, and they looked for him that he was supposed to be deported.\nAnd he hid. But we had to, we had to, he had to come out of the hiding, and they took\nhim. And I had only one solution. See, he was very sick in the ghetto. He was sick with\ntyphus. And he was -- that was a very terrible experience, because he was very sick and\nhis eyes were not completely closed, only partial. And finally, 1t was so hard on me to\nlook at it that I was sleeping at a neighbor's and, in the morning, I was going to the\nwindow -- we had the shutters closed -- and looking through the shutters whether he 1s\nstill there. And my mother, did everything possible -- we got some food for him -- she\nwashed him, she bathed him. And a neighbor told us of a doctor who was a heart\nspecialist, Doctor Yorkiche (ph).\nAnd Doctor Yorkiche found that his myocardium, which is a sac around the heart, is infected.\nAnd everybody suspected its typhus also. But if it would be -- if they would have taken\nhim to the hospital -- of contagious diseases -- you would have never come out. Nobody\ncame out of there. And -- but -- so he was finally taken to the hospital, a regular hospital.\nAnd fortunately, this was not at the time. Because later on, the German took all the\npatients from all the hospitals, including the children's hospital, and deported them. But\nthat was earlier. He reported that he was going to work. But I knew Doctor Yorkiche.\nAnd Doctor Yorkiche was supposed to be in the commission to select who is going and\nwho is not -- no, I mean, -- so I ran to her, and I said, \"Do you remember how sick he\nwas? Do whatever you can do, and she must not have done it because they didn't take\nhim.\" So we were together -- and maybe I should inject it now. When you\nphilosophically think about life, it's true. They didn't survive. I'm the only one who\nsurvived. But everyday -- I mean, the life is not forever anyhow. So that we were\ntogether and that we were together until Auschwitz has its great value. And when we\ntalk about going to Auschwitz, I will mention to you that we had a day extra. But I think\nI should do it later. My father was also sick. But he also recovered. And he had a work,\nwhich was much too much for his physical strength. So -- but I was able to find him\nsome other work. I felt always some responsibility for everybody. When my brother was\nsick, I prayed that if somebody has to go, let it be me, but not him. And I always tried to\nget something. I was able to get some soup, I was able to pick up some leaves, I was able\nto go to the resort of -- I mean, the place where there were vegetables -- and get the\npotato, or get something. But finally, you know, there was a lot of starvation. And I,\nactually, was never used to -- wasn't a big eater. But I was the one who had swollen --\nwho had edema. And later on -- that was already '43. '43 -- I may be jumping around --\nbut in '43, many people had tuberculosis, many people had pleurisy, the worst diseases,\nwhich were the result of starvation, because there was very little food. It was an\naccumulated process. The body was being starved and being starved and being starved.\nIn the beginning, you saw people in the ghetto who were much slimmer than they used to\nbe. You could see it in their clothes. You could see, when you look at them, they had\nfunny color of skin. But later on, there were people working with a lot of edema. It was\nfrom malnutrition. And there were many people dying of tuberculosis. Most of the\npathological diseases somehow disappeared, like my father who used to have diabetes.\nHe didn't have it. My mother used to have a kidney stone. She didn't have the kidney\nstone. It was mostly the effect of malnutrition.",
        "A: There were portioned. And they were -- see, depending what the German appropriated --\nfor the ghetto population. It was known in the administration of the ghetto. They were\nalso very good at knowing where people lived, where people worked, how many people\ndied, how many people -- most of the time, they even knew how many people are\ndeported. Only the time when the Germans deported people, probably, they were not\nable to have the real good statistics. So they were able to fix the rations for -- based on\nhow much food it was. Now, there were sometimes starvation rations. Now, people who\nhad worked were entitled to a soup. The soup was actually some vegetables and it wasn't\nmuch. But it was something. And we all were working. So we all had the soup. And\nthe rations of food were sometimes very, very small. But it was, I was able sometimes to\nget an additional soup, or something additional. We somehow -- I mean, I was actually\nthe smallest eater before the war. I had -- I had signs of starvations already. And so -- I\nsometimes think about it. How that everybody -- there was very little food. But it wasn't\nlike -- you know, sometimes you stand in line, and you say, \"No, we ran out of food.\" It\ndidn't happen. Everybody -- that's a little minimal, that very little was substandard. I\nmean, and it was not sufficient, 1t was a starvation diet. But everybody got it. And here,\nmaybe -- maybe we should give thought to the way the administration of the ghetto has\nbeen formed and of their functioning, that they were able to provide everybody with what\nlittle it was. But everybody got it. It was never a situation that somebody was\ncompletely left out. And also, most of the time in the ghetto, maybe not at the very end, I\ndon't recall any time where there was ever corpses on the street, or where there was -- we\nhad to -- it had to be clean, because the Germans would not -- would have closed us up\nand finished the ghetto off. And also, there were in the beginning, and now later on too,\nbut people were after -- they were afraid to go the hospital, because they were afraid they\nwould be deported the way -- it was a big tragedy. Human life, as I see it, was very\nimportant to everybody in the ghetto. Because I recall that we -- there was a little bit of\nland at Fresetska eight. And it has been divided so that we can -- not at the very\nbeginning, but later on -- it was divided so that we could grow some tomatoes, or onions,\nor what have you. And I, we had also a piece of land. Now, I don't recall that anybody\nstole anybody's vegetables, and really don't recall it. And I am very impressed -- I am\nvery impressed with it. And as far as the neighbors, where my brother would sleep, they\nwere very helpful. They disappeared. They must have been deported. The neighbor\nwho came with us, who helped us with that wagon -- they were deported. And they had a\nlittle child. In '43, you didn't see any children. There were no children in the ghetto. In\nthe very beginning, the administration in the ghetto tried to have schools. One time, there\nwas even a graduation. And to keep up, you know, the intellectual part of life so that we\ncan survive intellectually. Now, about the German Jews who came in, I remember them.\nThey were so different. They were, like, normal people. Go ahead.",
        "A: Must have been -- wait for just a second. They might have come in in 1941. 1942 was\nthat big, big deportation. And they were deported before. So it must have been, like,\n1941, or something like that. They came from the lawyers, Germans, Germans who have\nthe iron crosses, I mean, some Mischlings, which means they were married to Jews, some\nwhose ancestry was discovered that they were Jewish, some who were actually Jewish.\nBut when they came in, they were normal people. We were not normal people anymore,\nnot in our -- not in our looks, or not in our way of life. Maybe, some intellectually,\nactually were. And they also -- some of them brought farce (ph) with them, or different\nclothes. But it was tragic, because it was a very short time they were so miserable. They\nwere so miserable. But there were also many lawyers. And some of the lawyers were,\nhad positions later on as prosecutors and judges in the courts. There were courts in the\nghetto, and there were judges in the ghetto, and there was a priest in the ghetto. And so --\nand then most of them, the majority of them -- there were some rumors that about 20,000\ncame in. But many of them, afterwards, were deported. And there were many musicians.\nAnd at the end of the ghetto, all the instruments, musical instruments, had been\nrequisitioned -- requisitioned. I will just repeat that. And that's it.",
        "A: It probably varied. For instance, it varied. There was one big industrialist Hirsch (ph).\nAnd I know that my husband let him come to his office where he was and --",
        "A: My present.",
        "A: I don't know. That's my first husband. And I was not married --",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. My present husband, right. And he\nwas -- he was -- it was a Mr. Hirsch. And he -- he was -- he kept exempt so that he could\nget us to -- so there was something. Of course, I'm sure they -- when they looked at us,\nnot properly dressed that there was malnutrition and we probably looked like heck. So of\ncourse, I'm sure they felt superior. So unfortunately, after a not very long time, they\ndidn't look very much different than we did. But many talented people were -- were\nincorporated in the administration of the ghetto. And the, the musicians were -- there\nwere, sometimes, concerts. So they were active there. And the lawyers were -- were --\nsome of them were active as judges.",
        "A: At this time, it had been cleared somewhat, but not completely, because there were\npeople coming from other places, from ghettos which had been closed, like Pabanitzya\n(ph), Suskavolya (ph), and others. It was a problem. And that what -- in retrospect or\nmaybe even then, this very well organized administration of the ghetto, with all its flaws\nand so on, was able to -- to somehow incorporate them, maybe first not in apartments.\nBut they were incorporated, and they were -- given food -- they were also buying food\nwith their fares and with the fixed wage they brought. But each time there was an influx,\nsomehow -- somehow, the administration of the ghetto was doing something about\nincorporation. But later on, there was so many deportations that the ghetto shrunk. I\nmean, you could see when you walked that the ghetto's shrinking. I don't know\nwhether -- what, maybe, not even one third of the population was there when we were\nready to go to Auschwitz.",
        "A: In the very beginning. It was in the very beginning. Because then, when the older kids\nand everybody has to work -- and I understand children who were very young had also to\nwork, so that there was -- the schools were only in the very beginning. Later on, we\ncould not have any schools. They went to middling schools and if -- 1f a person wouldn't\nwork, they could be deported. They had to work. And they took, in this awful\ndeportation in 1942 -- children were taken away. And before we went to Auschwitz.\nThere were no children in the ghetto. I heard of a -- of a which, Dave my present\nhusband witnessed and mother. See, the Germans were masters of deceit. So they were\ntelling stories, like, they were going to take the children and they should be make to look\npretty, by whichever means is possible, and that they would be going to better places.\nAnd then, this mother had to put the child on a wagon and, right away, she'd become\ninsane.\nTape #2",
        "A: A person who has been in the ghetto has to answer that there was no normal. It was\nabsolutely not a normal life. We were living in a constant fear. And when we talk about\nconcerts, very, very few people actually attended. We knew that they were -- in the very\nbeginning, more people could attend. But it really is only like a token that something like\nthat existed in the ghetto. But I'm sure that many people didn't even know about the\nexsistence of the concert, because very few people were able to reveal themselves to\nthem.",
        "A: Absolutely not. In fact, there were -- in the beginning, there were some Rabbis. But later\non, they had to -- they cut their beards off, and they were not able to function. In fact,\nsee, they were -- there was a marriage, marriage ceremony. At the very end, the only\nperson who can conduct the ceremony was Rumchovsky (ph) -- the Rabbis had no rights\nto do anything of this kind. Services -- there was no services. They wouldn't allow that.\nSee, the ghetto was also changing, it wasn't always the same. If we talk about schools,\nthey were only at the very, very beginning. Later on, the German wouldn't allow it, they\nwould allow only work, and they demanded work of children who were very young. I\nthink anything above 10 -- they had to work. So schools were absolutely out of question.\nThe life was really, absolutely not normal. So, let's say, our family -- we were extremely\nfortunate. One -- one reason for our good fortune was a cellar. In the other room, there\nwas a cellar. The cellar was very close to the back wall where our bed was standing.\nAnd very frequently, when we knew there was a deportation, we went down to the cellar.\nIt was very crowded. My brother -- there were two boards to cover that cellar. He\ncovered it, and he put the bed over it. We would close the shutters. So there were quite a\nfew times that we escaped deportation this way. That's why we were able to stay so long\nbefore we went to Auschwitz. In the same way -- it was no normals, because it was\nterror, it was fear, there were -- I don't -- I didn't have any social life. The life was work,\nand you came home, and there was also -- we were not able to use electricity very long.\nSo it was darkness. And you know, in such a situation as it was in ghetto, you just want\nto survive, you are happy that you lived that day, and that your mother lived that day, that\nyour brother is living the day, that your father is living the day. That was -- that was all\nwe wanted. And nobody even had -- had -- we, you know -- you have -- you accept it\nthat you don't live, actually, for today. You accept it that you just -- or you live for today,\nthat you accept that a day passed by without any deportation, without any shooting,\nwithout any -- any decrees. And it was in the time of the -- it was a time in the ghetto, at\nthe very end, that they were cutting off parts of the ghetto, so people have to go, have to\nleave their apartments and go to others. We were fortunate, quote in quote, that we\nstayed, you know, in this, one apartment, from the beginning, you know, to the end. And\nwhen it was very cold -- there were times that it was very cold. But I think that they even\ncleaned the streets during the winter, maybe not for us, maybe for the Germans, so that\nthey -- nothing should happen to the Germans. And it was lie that we -- they were\nalways some rumors. And it was -- it wasn't really what you call a life. It was a sub --\nsubliving, subliving. And see, we -- we had something -- that the war is going well for\nthe Allies. And you know, we were hoping. We were hoping. And that this hope kept\nus alive. But we were not even visiting family. First, many of them have already been\ndeported. And in fact, my grandfather, my mother's father, and his daughter went to\nWarsaw. It was a time that, for one reason or another -- I don't know how it was\narranged -- but it wasn't -- it wouldn't have -- it wouldn't matter. Because when I told you\nabout this Purim celebration, at this very crowded beautiful table, there is, there are only\ntwo people, me and my cousin, Renya (ph), who lives also in Los Angeles, who survived.\nAll of everybody there, all my -- Ciotka Dopcha (ph), Ciotka Hannah, Ciotka Sulcha\n(ph), Ciotka Peza (ph), and their husbands, and their children -- everybody was\nmurdered. On my mother's side, I had family in Tomachav (ph). And I was able, while\nwe were still in Lodz, to somehow go there, because I didn't look very typically like a\nJew. And we took some money, brought it to Tomachav in the hope that 1t would be\neasier to live there. So she had two small children. It was Paula Rosenblum and they\nperished, they perished. From my mother's side, I had a picture of the Ciotka Rucha (ph),\nwho perished in Warsaw, Ciotka Paula, who perished in Tomachav. And there was, in\nfact, a brother of my mother who lived in Amsterdam. And sure enough, he was taken to\nAuschwitz and murdered, with his wife -- and with his two small children. Now, we\nwere sure that he would be surviving. But he didn't survive even in Holland. They -- so,\nyou know, when you live in a place where there is death all around you when people are\nbeing deported, when you don't know what will be tomorrow, when everyday they can\ncome and take you to Kripo and murder you there, when you are starving, when you are\ncold, when, when, when there is disease, because there was typhus quite a few times in\nthe ghetto, you don't really think that there is something like a social life, you don't think\nthat there is something which would entertain you, or -- we never went to anybody's\nhouse. And the neighbors somehow were disappearing too. They were disappearing.\nAnd so --",
        "A: I was thinking about it. I was thinking about whether we talked. But we must have\ntalked, because my mother was -- one time, had a dream. I do not believe in, you know --\nI'm not superstitious at all. But she had a dream that she went someplace, and that she\nmet her brother, who was in Holland. I mean, he went to Auschwitz and she went to\nAuschwitz. I mean -- I mean, why she had this dream and how this dream came upon I\nreally don't know. And what did we talk about? Now, when --",
        "A: So the life was just -- 1t was to survive, to see that your family survived. And I feel that\nconsidering that we had, you know, this little -- little places where we could grow\nvegetables -- and I do not recall anybody stealing. And I remember kindness from the\nneighbor and, actually, kindness from the people I worked with. So I don't think that I --\n[ -- that it 1s a picture -- a rosy picture is el (sic). (pause) The way I saw it -- and I do not\nthink that it's something in my imagination -- but anyhow, from my experience -- and I\ndid not have any special standing in the ghetto, or any special influence -- but I, myself,\nexperienced a pretty high moral fiber. And the ... that's what I experienced.",
        "A: It was actually desk work. There were -- we had to issue what was legitimaceje\nobiadove, which means -- there was a little booklet based on it. You got a stamp that you\ngot the soup. It was actually a part of the administration of the ghetto, which I was\nworking in. And it was a job like a bookkeeper's job. And we were issuing -- it was\ncalled legitimaceje obiadove, which means -- such a little booklet, where it was stamped\nwhether -- when somebody got his or her soup. And in order to be entitled to the soup,\nthey had to have this booklet. So that was my work in the ghetto. Before, I was working\nin the produce department doing similar work. And then I was transferred to that\ndepartment.",
        "A: Actually, he was the head of the office management in that department. He was very\nstrict. He was the first to come -- and he was standing there -- and if somebody dared to\ncome late -- he was just peering at that person, didn't say a word -- I don't think anybody\ncame late anymore -- and was very much respected for -- for his, I would say, noble --\nmaybe yes, noble behavior and so on -- integrity -- for his integrity.",
        "A: It did not entitle me to any additional food, maybe sometimes a soup. But otherwise, I\ncould not get anything. In fact, I had diarrhea, and I needed some rice, and I approached\nmy future husband, and he refused because he had his reasons. I am not blaming him.\nBut it is very telling that I approached him, and he said, \"No,\" he can not give it to me.\nHe had such -- such strong conviction of what he can and what he cannot do -- he\nwouldn't give it to me. He wouldn't take it for himself either.",
        "A: I had sometimes --",
        "A: I had sometimes an additional soup, which I brought and gave to my parents. But\notherwise, I sometimes -- it was a time that I could -- when there were more potatoes in\nthe ghetto, I could get a few more potatoes. Then we were actually -- the worst -- we\nfound out that there was something growing -- I don't know exactly what it was -- it\nlooked like spinach or something similar -- and we were gathering it, and we were\ncooking that. So that was, of course -- every little bit was helpful.",
        "A: I was -- I wasn't the one who they knew. So they couldn't come to me for favors, because\nI am not -- I don't have the means to give anybody favors.",
        "A: I don't know whether I am an optimist, or I have a rosy outlook. I knew that somebody\nwho was working, let's say in the bakery, had more, could get some more bread. But --\nand somebody who worked in the police department could have some favors. Somebody\nwho worked in the Sonderkommando and had -- or helped -- was stationed in the\nKriminal Polizei, in the Kripo, for sure was able to get some favors, some more nutrition,\nand so on. If you needed medication, you had to go to the people who were connected to\nthe Polizei, who were either policemen, or something. They were able to\nbring some, which I -- when my brother was so very sick, you know, I got some\nmedication from them.",
        "A: I knew somebody who knows somebody. And so, one time, I got some medication. And\nthat was in the very beginning. In the very beginning, we had -- it was easier to get\nmedication. At the end, it was nearly impossible. And maybe, I felt that it is a matter of\nfact that people who were associated with these places would have a little bit more\nnutrition. But nobody lived in a beautiful apartment. I don't think anybody -- maybe\nvery few -- had a bathroom. They were mostly latrines.",
        "A: Yes, we went outside. Most of the people were living in one room. See, it was a part of\ntown which was a part of town where very poor people used to live. So you know, there\nwere not -- I, you know -- so corruption. By the nature -- let's say there was a\nSonderkommando, who was very much in touch with the Germans -- I mean, not in touch\nbecause they were informers or something -- they were because they were supposed to be\nperforming certain duties. It was obvious that they had probably a little bit more food.\nBut all -- as I understood it, all was about food. They couldn't have much better living\nconditions, because they were not available -- maybe some people did have running\nwater and some people did not have running water. Many people did not have running\nwater.",
        "A: A part of the food administration. But it --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "A: We had -- we never saw food. We never saw food. It was just a bookkeeping department.\nI never -- no food went through -- we were a part of the so-called Aprovisation\nDepartment. But we were the part, an administrating part, only of this -- of this coupons,\ncoupon books, and we never saw food. It never came to my office.",
        "A: Everybody who was working was getting a soup.",
        "A: There was -- see, what was happening -- there was a certain amount of food which we're\ngetting besides the soup. And the food, which they were getting besides the soup, they\nwere getting. And if they were working, they were also getting the soup.",
        "A: In the Distribution Centers. They were -- everybody was entitled to a certain amount of\nfood.",
        "A: It was called -- wait a minute. They were called -- they were cards. They were cards for\nfood. In fact, as I recall one instance after this deportation from -- when the Germans\nwere -- came to the ghetto and took the people out -- some people who were not\nexpecting to -- expected to be taken -- because they just were not so exact to what they\nwere saying they were going to do -- some people took some of the bread, or whatever,\ncards with them, and it was a hardship for the others.",
        "A: No, no. It happened what -- it happens even now. The women were living longer. I\nthink that, physiologically, the women are equipped with -- because we are the\nchild-bearing species -- that we have certain -- this -- what is chemistry, or there is the\nglands, or something -- that we can survive easier than the men, because there were more\nwomen afterwards in the ghettos than there were men. But treatment -- I don't think that\nwe were treated differently. In fact, you know, in Europe, women were treated better, in\na way. I mean, it depends from what point of view you are looking of course, because\nthe man was the man of the house and the woman, you know, hair drop -- it was\ndifferent. So there were many women who were in professions. There were women\ndoctors. There were women chemists. I had a relative who was a chemist, a relative who\nwas -- had a kindergarten. And there were many doctors. And actually, I wanted to\nstudy biochemistry. That was my chosen profession which, of course, never happened.",
        "A: Not that I was aware of -- not that I was aware of. If somebody, of course, worked close\nto the administration, there is a likelihood. For instance, I know, when people got\nmarried, they could have asked Rumchovsky to give them -- to give them something.\nBut I don't think so. I do not think so. I might have not come across it. But I don't think\nSO.",
        "A: Until the very, very end, until nearly the last day, because I -- I don't have a tattoo.\nBecause when we came, the last transports -- they were so crowded that they didn't tattoo\nus. So it must have been very late in August already when we came. And we had\nextra -- an extra day for ourselves. What happened was that we were on the way which\nwe didn't know is Auschwitz. And we --",
        "A: Okay. They were coming -- in the beginning, they thought we would go full of tyranny\n[terror]. But people didn't go full of tyranny [terror]. So the Germans started rounding\npeople up. They also came to our apartment. But we had the cellar, and we closed the\nshutters, and we went down there, we heard them. They were banging with their rifles in\nmany places. But it was that we could pull the bed there -- and it was not usually -- I\ndon't know whether they expected it -- but they banged it on the floor -- they did -- but\nthey didn't bang where we were. So we did it -- we did 1t whenever, which was probably\nvery, very often -- you know, it was -- we were in the cellar. And in fact, what\nhappened -- I have the picture of my cousin -- and his whole family was deported, and he\ncame to us. And unfortunately, I, my father, my brother, and Aros (ph) -- Aros must have\nbeen, maybe, seven years, or something like it -- and we don't have room for Fishek\n(ph) -- so -- but there was a shed. So we said, \"Fishek, we'll hide you there,\" and we hid\nFishek there. We got up in the morning, we looked in the shed, he was gone. So the\nGerman took him out from there. They were looking everywhere. They were looking\neverywhere. They were just -- just going through everywhere and herding people to go,\nherding people to go.",
        "A: That was in August, 1944. And I -- this was -- like, I wish maybe -- I was thinking about\nhiding there. But we didn't have any food, and we didn't know what will happen. If we\nwould have known where we were going, we would have probably stayed in that ca....,\ncellar, maybe suffocated. But we would stay there. Now, with the transport --",
        "A: Yes. So this extra day -- I have to tell you about it. So we were on the way to this\ngathering place -- and August was just a beautiful month -- and we saw very close where\nwe were supposed to be gathered. We saw, like, a little house or something. Anyhow,\nthere was a guard, a German guard, in front of it. But it wasn't a Gestapo. So we said,\n\"Can we stay there for a day?\". He said, \"Okay. But no more.\" So we took -- we took\nresidence for a day in that room. And I was so spoiled that, even in the ghetto, I had to\nhave my spoon. And we were there, and -- you know, in retrospect, you sometimes think\nonly, \"Did we survive? We didn't survive, right? We didn't survive. So what good was\neverything?\". But no. Maybe it's philosophical. And since life is not forever, this one\nday was also important, because this was the last day that we were a family and that we\nwere together. Aros was with us too. And that's why I think sometimes about this day.\nAnd I don't want to say, \"What good was it that they didn't survive?\". But they had to\nstay. And then we went. It was the most strange thing. I met my cousin and her mother\non the ground where we were waiting to be taken away to Auschwitz. And we stayed\ntogether, I and my cousin, until we were liberated, which was very lucky for both of us.\nShe claims that my spirit helped her to survive, because I was just -- when we were\nworking in Sasel, one time, we passed by windows which were lit, and there was some\nkind of a holiday, and she mentions to me, \"Look, we will never live like that.\" I said,\n\"What do you mean, Renya? Why not? Of course, we'll live like that.\" And she always\nrepeats it. And I think that it was the defiance, the defiance. I just wanted to defy the\nGermans, because I went to Auschwitz with pleurisy, which is water of the lungs. I had a\nbladder infection. I was very sick before we went to Auschwitz. And when I was lying\ndown naked on the ground in Auschwitz --",
        "A: That's okay.",
        "A: Yes, I made my point. I made my point. And that's not so much --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Okay. Since I wasn't -- I was in a very, very small -- my job was administrative. But I\nhad nothing to do with food, I had nothing to do with distribution of food, or anything of\nthis kind. So I wasn't so close to the administration. But as a person who lived in the\nghetto from the very beginning to the very end, my assessment is that so it was hunger, so\nthere was deportation, so there were tragedies -- but there was -- somehow, we knew\nwhat is happening. There were hospitals. Nobody came back from a hospital with\ncontagious diseases. That's another story. But there were hospitals. There were\nhospitals also where children could go. There were hospitals where people -- if some --\nif there was a birth that they could go. There was certain civil safety. I mean, we were\nnot afraid that somebody would come into our house and rob us. There were very -- of\ncourse, some of the criminals were included in the early deportations. That's true. There\nwere prisons. There was a court. There were judges. There was a prosecutor. They had\nnames of everybody. They knew where everybody was living. There was a Department\nof Statistics. There was a Department of Distribution of Food. And within this\ndepartment was the Department of Produce. It was a department where they distributed\nflowers. There was a Department of Bakeries. Now, there was milk and coffee. I mean,\nthey knew exactly about how many people we had. I think that could have changed after\none of the deportations. But they knew. They knew about who has an apartment, or\nwhether there is an empty apartment. They knew who had died. So it was in this tragic\nconditions there was something that -- we, for instance, knew that there would be a\ndeportation. We, for instance -- besides, there were many rumors which, sometimes,\nwere not true. Very often, Rumchovsky had speeches and prepared us for certain things,\ncertain changes, or what have you. They were an instrument -- in the beginning, Rabbis\nwere performing ceremonies, if somebody, you know, got married. There were\ncircumcisions performed. Later on, when they -- when the Germans didn't allow it,\nRumchovsky was the one who married people. So for a very short time, there was even\nsomething, like -- on the marichian (ph) was something like a reserve for people who\nworked very hard. And one time, my brother had the privilege, and I took him there.\nAnd that was in the beginning. The ghetto became more and more less run by the Jewish\nadministration, and the Germans had more of a part. But this was at the time when Jews\nhad more to say about administration.",
        "A: Considering the alternative, because if they would not be an order, if there wouldn't be\norder, if there would be dead people lying all over, if there would be a lot of crime, I\nbelieve the German wouldn't go for it, they would just close the ghetto.",
        "A: I -- besides that I saw him, I never met the man. But I'm, what I'm thinking -- in this\nabnormal condition, with enormous pressure of the German from the outside, with the\npopulation probably being very often not very happy with whats going on, to have this\nkind of an administration -- so that since we're taken care of, no matter -- no matter what,\nI think that people who survive the ghetto, if not for this kind of an administration, would\nnot survive it until August the 25, 1944, because the ghetto would have been closed. And\nif this workshops, would not be administered, administrated the way they are, they were\nthey were, the ghetto would have been closed also much sooner.",
        "A: The workshops for the Germans, the workshops -- like, there was a leather workshop, and\nthere was -- there were all kinds of workshops which -- for which, you know, they were\npaid, and they could use the money to buy the food, and so on and so on, and -- I mean,\nthe administration -- the administration, not individuals -- everything, the administration.\nNow, you know, when you think today what's going on in certain countries, that, under\nthis awful circumstances, they had an administration who had everything in check, they\nhad powers -- of course, they had -- if they wouldn't have the powers, there would be\nwars there. Because if somebody wouldn't get enough food or something, no matter\nwhose fault, people would rebel. But there were no rebellions. Anyhow --",
        "A: Not -- no. Whether I got -- okay. But --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes. I told you about my mother. And I had enormous -- all -- I mean, respect and all.",
        "A: Yes. I told you that she was beautiful and --",
        "A: -- that she kept everything so clean --",
        "A: -- and she would -- took care of me when I was sick. I took care of my brother. And she\nnever complained. And we went into this cattle wagon with all these packages, which\nthey deceitfully told us to pack, and she was sitting on the floor. I can sit on the floor. It\ndoesn't matter. But my mother sitting on this floor and being so unhappy -- it just broke\nmy heart. And aI said, she never complained. And it was so embarrassing. It was -- I\nmean -- and there was a little window in that cattle wagon, and people were trying to look\nwhether we are going. And, as I said before, the day was absolutely gorgeous, absolutely\ngorgeous. And here, she was, poor -- my poor mother was sitting on the floor and -- I'm\nnot sure -- it must have been the air there -- and I don't know what happened to the\nexcrements -- I think there was some kind of an opening or something. Anyhow, then\nthey slid the door open from the wagon, and we came out.",
        "A: I do not recall exactly. I was just from Lodz to Auschwitz. From far away, it looked like\na place for the insane, because there was some wire around it and there were people\nrunning back and forth, back and forth, with shaven heads. And here, we had to come\nout, leave everything in the wagon. And then they told us to go to the left, to go to the\nright. And there was one Oberscharffuhrer at the head, closer to the camp. And he said\nto my mother to go to the left, and I went to the right. And not knowing, really, the depth\nof that tragedy, I still felt that it means that I'll go to work and she won't. So I run up to\nthe Oberscharffuhrer, and I said, \" Meine Mutter kann arbeiten viel besser wie ich,\"\nwhich was true, that she can work much better than I can. So he said, \" Du willst, sie\nschon sehen im abend, \" that I would see her in the evening. There were very deceitful,\nvery -- I mean, that this deceit was the smallest deceit -- I mean, because the one which\nthey did to get us out of the ghetto was a much greater deceit. Now, I was with my\ncousin and her mother, Tess (ph). She had lighter hair. My mother was already, partially\ngray. And we went in, and there was a second selection. We were supposed to\ncompletely disrobe, which we did of course -- we didn't have any other choice -- and that\nwe will go to the showers and -- there was something round -- and I was close to my\ncousin and her mother -- and all of a sudden, they took her mother out. It was a second\nselection. Of course, when she was undressed, they realized she is not in her 20s or 30s.\nIn fact, only one mother went with us, a Mrs. Kohn (ph). And what she went through in\nthe camps -- she was lashed and whipped so many times. But that's another story. Then\nwe, from there, there was -- they shaved our hair -- and I had long brown hair -- and my\ncousin, Renya, said, \"You know, I couldn't recognize you\" -- so I was calling, \" Tusa,\ntusa \" -- and so I came out and she saw me -- and they shaved our heads -- and we were\nnaked -- and we were supposed to lie down someplace on the ground to sleep overnight,\nwhich we did. Everything seemed completely insane. And miraculously, I awoke, I\ndidn't have my bladder infection. Then we were given some shoes, and I was given some\nshoes which had my foot, and we were given some clothes. And then I remember\nAuschwitz, I remember we were standing, one time, in line and I had some container\nwith some -- what was supposed to be soup -- and it was all, like, in a maze, what was\nhappening, what has happened, I mean. And what I see someplace, a sign, \" Arbeit\nMacht Frei.\" That was the sign in Auschwitz. And fortunately, we were there only a few\ndays. And everything seems like a very, very bad dream. And they were telling us that\ngoing out of Auschwitz to a working camp is a rather fortunate occurrence.",
        "A: It must have been some other person -- people who were already -- have been there in\nAuschwitz longer. Some of them were incarcerated people.",
        "A: Yes, that was Birkenau.",
        "A: Who were there before.",
        "A: The first impression was that it was some gathering of insane people. They just didn't\nlook normal. They absolutely didn't look normal. Their movement didn't -- wasn't\nnormal. That was my first impression when I went out of the wagon, and I looked to my\nleft, to my left and -- because we went out of the wagon, and then we were standing\nfacing this Oberscharffuhrer here. So then I was on the left side -- I mean, I was on the --\nmy mother was on the left, and I was on the right. So -- and then, as I said, it was like\na -- like a bad, bad dream, the whole thing -- it was so unbelievable, the movement of the\npeople, everything there. When I think about Auschwitz, I just remember, like,\nfragments because it was such an enormous shock. It was an enormous shock for, for\nme. And they took my mother away, and my father, and my -- and Aros and Lolick were\nalso taken away. I didn't know where they will be going. And I didn't realize what\nactually happened to my mother for a long time. Because, from there, we went to another\ncamp. My leg started swelling up. And we went to a camp in Hamburg. There, we were\nsupposed to be laying railroad tracks. And there were German woman, women who were\nour -- I don't know -- they were called Kapo. And in the morning, very early in the\nmorning, we have to stand in line. And there was a German SS, and he was pointing out\nwho's going and who's staying. In the beginning, I went. And in this camp, there was a\ndoctor. In most camps, there was a doctor. They wanted to have us, on one hand,\nprobably, fit, and on the other hand if not, eliminated. So this -- this doctor -- I ask her\nwhether I still have water on the lung. And she said, \"Yes, you have.\" And I had a cut\non my leg. So she put a very large bandage on my leg. And it so happened that, after I\nhad the bandage, in the morning, she, for a short time, pointed out for me to stay. Now,\nyou were asking whether I realized what happened. So what actually -- when I started\ngoing to work, it was very hard. It was very hard, to me, to climb on the wagon because\nmy legs were so swollen. But since it was very early, there were stars in the heaven, and\nI prayed. So I prayed for my parents, and for Lolick, and for myself. But -- so at this\ntime, I had no inkling what, actually, is happening to them, absolutely no inkling. And\nthen we were in Hamburg for quite a while.",
        "A: I remember only that it was Hamburg. I do not know any name of this particular one.",
        "A: No, this wasn't Sasel. From this camp --",
        "A: It wasn't a very long time. But 1t was more than a month. From there, we were\ntransported to Sasel. And I, as much as it was, the conditions were not good -- this camp\nwas situated in a very woody area. And I am very sensitive to good air. And also, when\nwe came there, there were always accommodations that the doctor -- there was a doctor.\nSo when people came from work, they could come there. It was called the ambulance.\nActually, it's like an infirmary. And I approached this doctor and I asked her whether I\ncould work for her. And she says -- so she had chosen me to work for her. That also\nallowed me to recuperate somewhat. I had to work, I had to wash the floors, which no\nbig deal. It was a big deal for me then because, you know. But anyhow -- and when\npeople were coming, I was greeting them, I was taking reports, and I got -- they were\nsaying that I am very polite and friendly to everybody and -- now, this doctor wanted me\nto sleep with her -- she was afraid to sleep by herself -- which I did.",
        "A: Yes. She was from Czechoslovakia. She committed suicide after the war. And so that\nwas going on for a while. But then, for one reason or another, I guess she wanted me to\nsleep with her and somebody else wanted me to sleep in the barracks. But anyhow,\nsomebody else got my position. So I was going to work. When we were coming from\nwork, we had to stay at attention. And if there were any complaints about anybody\nduring the work of any kind, the person was whipped, and we had all to stand and watch\nit. And in the middle of this courtyard was something -- I don't remember -- some\nwooden contraption or something where the people were whipped. Now, one time, I was\nalso punished. And it was -- they claimed -- which I do not know whether it's true or\nnot -- but that I brought some meat. We were working someplace. Over there, we were\ndigging foundations. And at one time, we were carrying heavy stones, one giving it to\nanother in a line. And one time, we were called to a slaughter house. And they -- he\nclaimed that I took some meat into the camp. And I had a big speech. I spoke German.\nAnd I was just sentenced to clean the latrines, which -- I don't know whether -- I think I\nremember it right. I never felt -- I felt always defiant. I never felt -- even when I had to\nclean the latrines, I didn't feel inferior. This mother, Mrs.Kohn, has been unfortunatly,\nshe has been lashed and whipped so many times. So over there, one time, I was milking\nacow. We were working someplace and we saw cows there. So I was milking a cow.\nBut unfortunately, another girl was doing something similar -- I don't know whether it\nwas a cow or it was a bull -- and hit her. And it was tragic. There was not enough food\nand the coats -- the coat was a big problem. And one time, we walked -- worked --\nwalked to work, and we had wooden shoes. And the ice was building up on the shoes\nand building up on the shoes, and we stopped and wanted to get the ice off our wooden\nshoes. They wouldn't let us. And it seemed like it will never end. And I remember that,\nlater on, we used to say, \"If this walk ended, anything difficult will end.\" And --",
        "A: Which you would --",
        "A: Good. Good. I am coming back.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: All the camps which I was in Hamburg, in Sasel, only women.",
        "A: No. Sasel was not very huge. I couldn't tell you the numbers. But it wasn't huge. I\nmean, it was -- in comparison with Auschwitz, it was really small.",
        "A: That is a very difficult question for me to answer. We were sleeping in the beds, like,\none, I on the top, and Renya on the bottom, or vice versa, I believe. And how many\npeople in the barracks? Wait a minute.",
        "A: Wait a minute. 25.\nshe wanted --",
        "A: Just companionship, just plain companionship. She was scared too. She was, you know.\nShe was working as a doctor. But she was, you know. She was a prisoner. No, no. She\nwanted just -- because she was, scared. She probably lost her family and she was scared.",
        "A: No!",
        "A: No!",
        "A: No, no, no, no! I tell you it's impossible. There was no drive for that. There was -- I\nmean, we were so devoid of energy, of desires. I mean, it was all -- what was important\nwas not to be so awfully cold -- the cold was very hurtful -- maybe not to be so very\nhungry, not to be whipped or hurt -- but nothing of this kind. She was just a nice human\nbeing and she was just scared. And at night, I'll tell you, my cousin was also scared, you\nknow. I mean, people were scared.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I think so. I think so. There was one girl who, who was whom, -- maybe who\nwas there from Germany -- but probably, she was in the ghetto. And that's how she got\nto the camp.",
        "A: There were Germans.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Fortunately, not. They said that they gave us something in Auschwitz, or something. But\nwe didn't have it. We thought that we'd never regain it. But we did regain it because we\nhave children. But, no, we didn't have it. And we were told that they were giving us\nsomething so that we shouldn't have the period.",
        "A: Not really, because who would like to be bothered with that.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: The ghetto fluctuated, you know? Sometimes, it was more. Sometimes, it was less. And\nat the end, there was only starvation. We didn't have enough food. For instance, when I\nsaw the cow, I milked her, you know. And when we went to the slaughterhouse, maybe\nI, you know -- I took some meat. We were getting some bread. We were getting some\nsoup. That's what I -- what I recall. And I recall that the hunger was bad. But the cold\nwas miserable.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We didn't see the finished products. But there were some German civilians also who\nwere overseers. So there must have been something contracted by the SS, for some\ncompanies, I assume. Because there were some civilian overseers at that place.",
        "A: I really don't know. But I don't think about the size of it. It's likely that it was not for\nfactories.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We never have contact. But in Hamburg, one time, they were -- they were looking at us.\nBut we looked like criminals, because we had this shaven hair, shaven heads, and we had\nthese outfits, you know, special outfits, and we looked like prisoners.\nTape #3",
        "A: Well, we were in Hamburg. Yes, yes. And we were not that happy about it. We didn't\ncare what would happen to us. And they were running to the shelters. And we really --\nwe really -- in Hamburg, any time we heard the raid, we were just very happy, because it\nwas a sign, you know, that something is being done about the Germans, of course, and\nthat the countries would be saved, from this tyrant. So we were happy about it.",
        "A: Maybe, maybe, yes.",
        "A: Definitely, definitely. When you have your family, you first, you feel more like a human\nbeing. See, Auschwitz was very dehumanizing. You were not a person. You just were\nnot a person. And you felt it, that you are not a person. And since Auschwitz, they did\nsomething to us. So as I said, on one hand, I didn't feel inferior -- but I had it also say\nthat -- you see, there was a lot of where I was -- I knew that I could do something in the\nghetto. So when my brother was sick, I tried to bring him ice because ice was -- had to\nbe put on his heart. And I remember the person I was getting the ice from. He,\nafterwards, saw me. He was afraid to ask me what happened to my brother, because I\nwas so crushed. I could help a little bit. I could do something. I was still -- I was still a\nperson who had certain, certain -- I wouldn't say powers -- but I could help my father, I\ncould help my brother, I could encourage them, I could do something for them, I could be\nwith them. Now, when they took everybody away and -- I mean, we were not really -- in\na way, we were not really human beings. In a way, you know, you didn't -- certain\nfeelings were taken away, you know? And besides that, the type of, of, -- I couldn't call\nit life -- that wasn't life -- that wasn't life -- and we, but we probably -- I in particular,\nprobably believed that we will survive. I also believed that my brother will survive. I\nalso believed that Aros will survive. And, but Bergen-Belsen --",
        "A: All right. Now --",
        "A: Very close to the end of the war, because I wasn't in Bergen-Belsen too long.",
        "A: They took us on trains. They were not cattle trains. And we were still standing in the\nstation, and I decided that Iam going to jump out of the window, which I did. And I\nasked my cousin, \"Come with me,\" because I knew there is some camp of some\nprisoners, Italians, and I think that maybe I can walk over there, or do something. This\nGerman girls overseers came up to me, picked me up, put me back on the train, and I was\nexpecting, the whole time, that I'll be punished or something. Nothing happened. Now,\nwe came to another hell, because Bergen-Belsen was like a dug up cemetery. There were\npiles, piles, over piles, of skeletons, one skeleton over the other skeleton, piles, a hill.\nWe were put into something that looked like a warehouse, lying on the floor. One time a\nday -- or I don't know whether every day -- they opened the doors, they whirled up\nsomething which was some watery soup. Now, people were very sick there. There was a\nlot of diphtheria. And I remember the latrines. And somehow, I probably had the urge to\nsurvive. So I don't know where I got -- I got some metal containers, one for me and one\nfor Renya. And when I heard the squeak of the opening door, I ran to the door, and I put\nthis container into this kettle. So I got some soup -- and I think I got for both of us --\nbecause they were not staying there very long, so not everybody got anything, you know?\nSo it was important to run there and to get the little bit of watery soup in the beginning.\nOtherwise, you didn't get anything. And there, you realized subconciously and\nconciously, that I will never see my mother, never see my dad. And just -- just lying --\nwe were just lying on this floor there day and night. Probably, when we had to go to the\nlatrine, we went out. We must have gone out, because we were able to see this -- this\npiles, piles, and piles, of skeletons, just skeletons, unburied. And they were throwing\nmore and more piling up more. And, that was Bergen-Belsen.\nAnd I remember when we were liberated, we were liberated by the British. There was no joy in\nmy heart. I understand they told us -- somebody told us not to run out too early, one girl\ndid, and she got shot. There was no joy what I was doing, I got some place, some paper\nand a pen, and I was writing. I write -- and I never thought that I should keep this\nwriting. I'm sure I wrote in Polish. And I wrote and wrote. And, then -- that was\nliberation. Fortunately -- unfortunately, they meant very well. Some people were taken\nto, like, a hospital or something. They meant well. But they wanted to share with us the\nfood, and they gave some chocolate and other things to people, who were starving for a\nlong, long time. And their stomachs couldn't take it. So they got diarrhea, and some of\nthem didn't make it. And then we must have been taken out of there. And we were still\nin Bergen-Belsen. But, of course, in completely different quarters, and with food and so\non, supplied by the British.",
        "A: Right now, I couldn't even think. It was 1945. And I think it was April, 1945. I just\ncouldn't think of dates.",
        "A: I think I was there only a few weeks. I think I was there only a few weeks. That's what I\nthink.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Probably, the screams, and they probably walked in, and we probably saw the uniforms.\nBut I know as much as later on, at that point, there was no happiness. Because after\nBergen-Belsen, I -- I knew, that my parents didn't survive. And there was absolutely you\nknow, maybe, seeing all these corpses, and I mean, you couldn't be happy about anything.\nI wasn't happy. However, once we were transferred to some human quarters, and I\nwanted to look for my brother. He was in Buchenwald. But he didn't survive. And I do\nnot know why. And I was sure that Aros would survive, because he was such a tough\nyoung, young boy. I don't know what happened to him. I have no idea. There's no way\nto find out anything right. I talked to people who knew my brother in Buchenwald. And\nthat's why I didn't stay long in Bergen-Belsen -- I mean, not -- this camp in prison -- but\nliberated Bergen-Belsen. But I went to Hamburg. I got some clothes there. I don't know\nhow I did it. And then I went to Hanover, because it was where I was asking\neverybody -- I was inquiring whether anybody saw Lolick, and whether they know, and\nmaybe he registered someplace or something. But, he did not survive. He did not\nsurvive. And so everybody, everybody from this enormous family was tortured, starved,\ngassed. And there is a story.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It so happens that I met my present husband, Dave Klipp. And he was already -- at that\ntime, he was thinking positively. There were people who didn't have a -- who did not\nbelong anyplace. So he and some others contacted -- not the Nazis, of course, at that\ntime -- but the German authorities to form this KZ Ausschuss, so that we get some\nhousing, get some nutrition. Because there were cards at that time. There were\nnutritional cards. So I -- at that time, I actually stay stayed in Hanover, and I just didn't\nfeel like going to Poland, which I very much regret. And so from there, we started living\nwhat I would say is a much more normal life. I was together with Renya and there were\nsome other people who survived. And so there was already a social exchange. We\nalready cared that, how we get dressed, and how we look, and we got -- we got through\nthis KZ Ausschuss.\nWe got an apartment with some German person. I mean, it was her apartment. And her husband\ndidn't come yet from the war. So we were -- we were designated this quarters for us to\nlive in.",
        "A: She was there also.",
        "A: She knew that she just has to let us live there, you know. She realized, you know. It\nwasn't really -- it was -- you see, there were not enough housing to give us -- later on, we\ndid get a house for ourself. But at this time, it was the best solution. Because, at least,\nwe lived in a normal apartment with a kitchen, and with a bathroom, and so on. At that\ntime, she realizes they are the, that that's the only way it will be for a while. When, her\nhusband came from the, back. He was rebeling. He was rebeling a lot. And then, of\ncourse, we got another place to live.",
        "A: Yes. Because the Germans were also getting coupons. At that time, it was rationed.\nAnd we got an apartment, and we got -- we got food -- and we got some clothing, and we\nstarted what you would call the beginning of a normal life. Some people, you know --\nthat -- that's what was happening.",
        "A: I have to admit that it -- I remember some extreme elation. Not in Bergen-Belsen. Not\nwhen I was -- but when I started -- when I left Bergen-Belsen to go to Hamburg -- I don't\nknow whether it started there or much later -- but I was so elated that I am alive. I just --\nmy cousin, Renya, was just, like, envious. I mean, she was happy about that. But she\nwas envious that -- I mean, I felt that Iam alive. And it was -- it was a elation for me\nto -- it -- I went through this grieving period for a while. And I was -- we were always\ngrieving, we were always talking about it, and so on. But this -- this absolute\ntransformation for being not even a human being -- and all of a sudden, being free --\nwhen I realized it, I was -- there was a period -- it didn't last forever -- but it was a period\nof great elation.",
        "A: Where?",
        "A: No, it was in Hanover.",
        "A: We actually stayed there for a long time. We also were in Frankfurt for a while. And\nyes, the reason we stayed so long in Germany was we wanted to leave Germany as soon\nas possible. There were too many memories and you never knew to whom you're talking.\nBecause if they told you that they always were buying into your stores -- or something\nlike that -- then you know: \"Watch out.\" Then we didn't want to -- but anyhow, Dave\nhad a sister in the United States, in New York. So actually, they were doing something to\nsend us status. However, I had no pleurisy in the ghetto and also in the camps. And so I\ndidn't have the pleurisy when I was liberated just miraculously. On an x-rays, there were\nshadows. And the United States, very rightfully, didn't want to let people in with\ntuberculosis. They would have let somebody in with pleurisy, because it's not\ncontagious. So I had a very hard time, to, until they declared me. It took a long time\nbecause -- we came here in 1950, liberated in 1945 -- until I got a clearing that I can go.\nAnd that's why it took so long for us to come here to the United States.",
        "A: Yes. Well, we got married in 1946, March 16th. And you know, the lady in whose\nhouse we lived, who we met afterwards -- she just couldn't believe it, that we got\nmarried. You see, there is a big age difference between David and me. But it really --\nhe's -- I mean, he's a young man. So he now believes that he's -- am I on tape still?",
        "A: Oh!",
        "A: All right. Now, we got the British Government -- and that was a UNRR, UNRR -- they\nwere also helping. Now, I don't know whether KZ Ausschussz was later. Formed later. I\nwould have to check with Dave exactly where it was -- where it was formed. Because in\nthe very beginning -- I have a picture with La Guardia. And yes, in the very beginning.\nThis happened later. That's what -- what we are telling you about the KZ Ausschuss. It\ndidn't happen immediately after the end of the war. It didn't happen immediately.\nBecause at this time, we were being sent supplies from the United States to the UNRR,\nand La Guardia came, and, since I was involved in with the distribution center of the\nfood -- but this was food given directly to people -- and La Guardia came -- and there's a\npicture of him with me -- he was so shocked when we were telling him what was actually\nhappening. So in the very beginning, there were not so -- the people started coming, you\nknow -- more and more people started coming. And then when -- that's how, that's how I\nremember it -- because in the beginning, we weren't old. That was -- the beginning, we\nwere on Auerstrasse (ph), and food was coming, yes, to the UNRR.",
        "A: Yes. I was working together with others and we were -- yes.",
        "A: We wanted to keep our sanity. So when we were digging this foundations in Sasel, we\nwere doing some algebraic in the sand. We were doing square roots, when we had a little\nbit of time. And um.... See, we were going to the same school. She's a little -- she was a\nlittle -- in a little bit older class than I. So this, we remembered. That we had a little bit\nfree time, and we were were doing the algebretical roots. So you know to keep the\nsanity.",
        "A: I never stopped praying -- I think that I never stopped praying. I do not pray -- I mean, I\nchange the way I pray. Very frequently, and I pray with my own words. But I don't\nthink -- I might not have prayed in Bergen-Belsen. I might not have prayed. But I\nprayed in Hamburg, because I remember it. And, I don't know whether it 1s, has\nsomething to do with my upbringing, or whether it has something to do with my\nspirituality. And I think that we have certain powers. Maybe powers is too strong a\nword. But we were -- in the worst of times even, we have some abilities. Not in\nAuschwitz maybe. Not in Bergen-Belsen. But we have some abilities. We have -- and I\nthink they are, maybe -- you could say they are God-given. And so I keep praying. I\nkeep praying. I keep -- actually, my way of praying is, if this 1s important, a way of\nthanking God for what I want to have.",
        "A: It is absolutely miraculous. I went, in the very beginning, after in Germany, through\nsome times which I was very -- I may be depressed, nervous, and so on. It's likely that,\nhaving been blessed with two sons and two daughter-in-laws and four grandchildren, and\nhaving worked also on my physical and emotional health through things like yoga and\nothers, I am, actually right now, in a very good, very good place emotionally. Because I\ncould talk about it and I could -- when my husband was testifying at UCLA [University\nCalifornia-Los Angeles], there's no way I was able to testify. It still -- when I think about\nit, even about testifying, especially about the ghetto, I was having butterflies in my\nstomach. However -- and I cannot watch any -- anything on television about the\nHolocaust. And when I watched the first time when there was a Holocaust story, I was\nsick for quite a long time because I have a visual memory. And when I hear something,\nit doesn't affect me so much. But when I saw it, I cannot see it. I cannot see. And I try --\nsince I don't do any good to anybody and I have my responsibilities -- so I try not to look.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes, we couldn't talk about it. In the beginning, we just could not talk about it. And I\ncouldn't talk about it for quite a long time. And, my son was always -- when I started\ntalking quite recently, he was, was, like -- in a way, he was pleased that I talk about it.\nHe'd be very surprised that I was able to testify, with pretty much of a composure,\nbecause I -- Dave was talking -- my husband -- I couldn't -- I was always, want to protect\neverybody from everything. Now, I have a little number which I was wearing in the\ncamps. And my granddaughter wants it, she said, \"Don't give it to anybody,\" she wants\nit -- so probably -- I will show it to you -- probably when she will ever eventually give to\nthe Holocaust Museum.",
        "A: What really affected me is my upbringing. I was brought up to respect elderly people --\nand I don't forget that I am one of them right now -- I was taught to be honest. I was\ntaught that you're supposed to be charitable. We never were taught to hate. And I think\nit's not so much the experience. But the way I was brought up, there are certain things I\njust would not do. I wouldn't do it. Because this period of time -- of course, it is a big --\nit's not a void -- a hurt -- my main concern 1s actually whether when my -- especially, my\nmother -- my father, of course, too -- when they went into this gas chambers, whether --\nhopefully, they didn't suffer too much -- that is my very, very important concern. And I\ndo not want to investigate too much. Because I don't off -- on the one hand, in the\nbeginning, I was hoping it was instantaneous. But I understand it was not instantaneous.",
        "A: This is a photograph taken in a spa which we spent the summer in. And there is my dear\nmother, Hannah Ryba Weingarten (ph), my dear father, Yakaf Weingarten (ph). And\nthere is my dear, handsome brother, Herschlipe Weingarten (ph), we called him Lolick.\nAnd that's me next to my mother. I was about five years old. And let me remember them\nthe way -- the way -- the way they were here, and not think that they were gassed in\nAuschwitz.",
        "A: Oh. This picture was taken in Portumbina, where we had a summer home. And I am\npicking up the balls and my brother, who is at the right, is playing with -- and his name is\nLolick Weingarten -- he is playing with Fishek,\nmy cousin. I mentioned his name because, before going to Auschwitz, after his family was\ndeported, he came to us and we tried to hide him. And there was no room in our cellar\nfor him. And there were already five people. And we hid him in a shack. But\nunfortunately, the SS found him and took him to Auschwitz a few days before we went to\nAuschwitz.",
        "A: I must have been here, maybe, 10.",
        "A: Yes, it would be in the early 1930s. (pause) On this photograph, on the left, standing, is\nFelka (ph), my cousin, Felka Weingarten. And on the right is Ritcha (ph), Ritcha\nWeingarten. And I am in front of Felka, and my brother, Lolick Weingarten, is in front\nof Ritcha. Unfortunately, Felka perished in the Holocaust and Ritcha, her husband, and\nher baby, perished in the Holocaust also. Rest their memory. (pause) This is my aunt,\nPaula Rosenblum, a sister of my mother's. She perished in the Holocaust together with\nher husband and three small children. (pause) This is my aunt Rucha Bondrypa (ph), who\nplayed her piano beautifully, and she perished in Warsaw during the Holocaust.\n"
