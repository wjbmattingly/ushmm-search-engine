        "A: We had no time really much, to play.",
        "Q: Tell me why.",

Because when \u2014 as little children already, we had to make money, yeah.\nWe - in there, in the forest, in the summer, we had to go pick blueberries, and we\ngot \u2014 my sister got this one, we got \u2014 and then my other sister, and then we broughtMay 18, 2015\nthem home, and do \u2014 God forbid we come home earlier [indecipherable] we head\non home. My mother was strict with us. So \u2014 and then, my poor mother, because\nnobody bought from us, she sold them so we made money. We worked for the\nfarmers, picking up potatoes when it came in September, October. We \u2014 we \u2014 we\nwere \u2014 we \u2014 we did a lot of things, and later on, I \u2014 I remember \u2014 that is already\nmuch later, when I \u2014 I remember when my \u2014 my \u2014 from my father\u2019s mother came to\nSchreiersgriin, before she left for Africa \u2014 she \u2014 she went for Africa, the rest, with\nthe \u2014 with the sister and the brother, and she took a lot of people out of, and she\ncried when she couldn\u2019t get us no more passage out of Germany. We \u2014 she \u2014 she\nforgave her son, and so we \u2014 we \u2014 we were left behind.

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And we \u2014 we did all that. And I remember that\u2019s ahead of time when my \u2014 my\nsister was 14, and she could go out to work, sh-she couldn\u2019t. Why didn\u2019t she could?\nBecause, when she would go out to work, they would have right \u2014 right away to\ntake her to work camp. See, at that time, we didn\u2019t know there is such a thing as\nconcentration camp. I didn\u2019t know when they took me fath \u2014 they said work camp.\nAnd there were no fathers home from the \u2014 from the German people, nobo \u2014 no\nfather was home. When they took my father, they said he goes to a work camp.",
        "Q: So, did other fathers go to work camps, too?",
        "A: No, they went in the army. They\u2019re soldiers. That is the \u2014 when did I notice,\nreally, the difference?",

        "A: Yeah.May 18, 2015",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And all that stuff. Then we really began the difference. We were not allowed to\ngo to a movie, we were not to have a radio. We \u2014 we were not allowed to have\nnothing. Then we only said \u2014 but really didn\u2019t \u2014 and I tell you the truth, I didn\u2019t\nknow til the end of the war there was such a thing as concentration camp. Even I \u2014\nwhen they took my father to Theresienstadt, 1942\u201d Forty-two, yeah, when my\nsister was born, he was already no more home. Forty-two somewhere, it\u2019s in the\npapers, we have it. My mother, my sister and I, we went to Plauen. He had to report\nto the Gestapo. In between, he did forced labor, when he came home from\nBuchenwald. It\u2019s all in the be \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s \u2014 that is getting ahead of us a little bit. I\u2019m still in the early, early\nyears, where your father is working as \u2014 at any kind of job that he could get.",
        "A: Any work he could get.",

        "A: My mother didn\u2019t go, but \u2014",
        "Q: But he would go, and he would wait outside until \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s what my brother says. I don\u2019t remember that, really.",
        "Q: Okay.May 18, 2015",
        "A: I didn\u2019t \u2014 but you \u2014 he must have been downstairs, in the business, you know\n[indecipherable]",

Why didn\u2019t she could?\nBecause, when she would go out to work, they would have right \u2014 right away to\ntake her to work camp. See, at that time, we didn\u2019t know there is such a thing as\nconcentration camp. I didn\u2019t know when they took me fath \u2014 they said work camp.\nAnd there were no fathers home from the \u2014 from the German people, nobo \u2014 no\nfather was home.

Then we only said \u2014 but really didn\u2019t \u2014 and I tell you the truth, I didn\u2019t\nknow til the end of the war there was such a thing as concentration camp. Even I \u2014\nwhen they took my father to Theresienstadt, 1942\u201d Forty-two, yeah, when my\nsister was born, he was already no more home. Forty-two somewhere, it\u2019s in the\npapers, we have it. My mother, my sister and I, we went to Plauen. He had to report\nto the Gestapo. In between, he did forced labor, when he came home from\nBuchenwald. It\u2019s all in the be \u2014",
