        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nMr. Ralph Hockley on January 12, 2016, in Carrollton, Texas. Thank you very\nmuch Mr. Hockley, for agreeing to speak with us today. We\u2019re going to conduct a\nlong interview, trying to capture as many of your experiences as we can, in different\nplaces, and a \u2014 in different times. And we\u2019|I start at the very beginning. We\u2019ll ask the\nmost basic questions, and from there we develop our story. So the very first question\nI have for you, can you tell me your date of birth?",
        "Answer: October 17, 1925.",
        "Q: And what was your name at birth?",
        "A: Rudolf with an F, Martin Hockenheimer.",
        "Q: Hockenheimer. And where were you born?",
        "A: In Karlsruhe, Germany.",
        "Q: Can you tell me ge \u2014 a little bit, just geographically, approximately where is\nKarlsruhe in Germany? What are other major places near it?",
        "A: It\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s southwest Germany, it\u2019s a cr \u2014 just across the river from France. It\u2019s\nwhere the line separates Germany and France, and then the border turns west \u2014 the\nGerman border turns west. It\u2019s 45 minutes north of Strasbourg, France, and it\u2019s due\nwest of Stuttgart, and due south of Heidelberg and Mannheim.",
        "Q: Okay. So could you call it a border town, a border city?January 12, 2016",
        "A: You could, but it was more involved in the traffic of boats on the Rhine river.",
        "Q: Ah, okay, okay.",
        "A: It\u2019s actually called \u2014 it used to be, I suspect it still is, Karlsruhe am Rhine.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014it\u2019s right \u2014 it has a big harbor for [indecipherable] shipping.",
        "Q: Okay. And how is it that you happen to be born in Karlsruhe?",
        "A: My -",
        "Q: I\u2014 were your fam \u2014 the \u2014",
        "A: My parents \u2014 my parents \u2014 my mother was from Munich.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And my father was originally from Hockenheim \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 which 1s \u2014 was a cigar town. And then, that is close to Mannheim, so he grew\nup in Mannheim.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And for professional reasons, he came to Karlsruhe and joined his brother-in-\nlaw in a business in [speaks German]",
        "Q: Okay, what is that?",
        "A: That is they \u2014 they sold machines for butchers. They sold everything the butchers\nneeded, including sausage casings, because in those days, all sausages were still\nJanuary 12, 2016\nmade with casings. And so that was a big business, and the \u2014 his \u2014 his store was right\nacross the street from the slaughterhouse.",
        "Q: So your father\u2019s store \u2014 your \u2014 your father\u2019s store was across the street from \u2014\nthat\u2019s pretty convenient.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You know. Okay, I mean, when I asked that question, yes, it was sort of a\nbackwards question to ask, is your family from Karlsruhe. And \u2014",
        "A: The answer is no.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The answer is, my mother\u2019s family is from Munich, but that\u2019s got a lot of ifs to\nit, too. My father\u2019s family is definitely from Baden, from the Hockenheim,\nMannheim, Heidelberg area. Ma \u2014 the reason I say with my mother is, because the\n\u2014 her mother was from Mannheim, and she married a gentleman who came from a\nplace called Buttenhausen.",
        "Q: Buttenhausen\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Never heard of it.",
        "A: Nobody else has either. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s kind of between Stuttgart and Nuremberg.",
        "Q: Okay.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: There\u2019s a whole big area in there, but that \u2014 that\u2019s where her father came from.\nAnd the thing that\u2019s very confusing, if you look at the \u2014 the family tree, or anything\nelse, is that my grandmother, whose maiden name \u2014 well, my mother\u2019s maiden name\nwas Lowenthal(ph) \u2014 Lowenthal.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, Lowenthal.",
        "A: And her mother \u2014 her father was Hermann(ph) Lowenthal, and her mother was\nalso a Lowenthal, but they were not related. And so that gets very confusing \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 when you look at the \u2014 at the family trees, because you don\u2019t know which ler \u2014\nLowenthal you\u2019 re talking about. But they had nothing in common.",
        "Q: Did you do that? Did you research your family tree, at some point?",
        "A: Yeah. Yes.",
        "Q: And ki \u2014 how fa \u2014 ka \u2014 what can you tell us about that, what you discovered?\nHow far back did your family go in \u2014 in Germany? How \u2014 how far back could you\ndiscover?",
        "A: Well, my father\u2019s family, the Hockenheimers, I\u2019ve been working on all week, to\nmake it into some form that I can give you a copy. My father\u2019s family I traced back\nto about 1789, and my mother\u2019s family, I would say the 1850s.",
        "Q: Okay. So that\u2019s how far back you were able to find, and they were all still in these\nareas for several generations.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, what happened, the one thing that you notice when you do that, is that in\nthe 19 \u2014I\u2019m sorry, in the 1890s, the Jewish people moved from the villages into the\ncities. So that was a big change there. They all were born in small towns, but they all\nwound up in big cities. And that had to do with the government attitude, and so on.\nThey \u2014 there are a lot of little things you find out, you \u2014 for example, until the 1850\n\u2014 60s, children had Jewish first names. Starting about \u201970 \u2014 1870, they all had very\nGerman names.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: My father\u2019s brothers were Albert, Louie. The youngest one was Fritz, heaven\nforbid, and my father was Julius \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 and they all had the German names. The German Jews, it\u2019s a big thing that\ncomes out of this, wanted to be Germans. A lot of them were very religious, some of\nthem weren\u2019t, but they all wanted to be accepted, which was a \u2014 the key to this\nwhole thing.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They wanted \u2014 they finally wanted to be accepted.",
        "Q: And so, were you able to find \u2014 if you \u2014 there was Fritz and Ira and Julius, what\nabout their father, what was his name? Did you remember?\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Well, yes. My father\u2019s father\u2019s name \u2014 he was born in 1844 1-in Hockenheim, his\nname was Maier, m-a-i-e-r. There are two versions. It could be m-e-y-e-r, but he-he\nwas m-a-i-e-r, and his father was Isaac, with two As.",
        "Q: Well, you know that\u2019s very \u2014 that\u2019s interesting, because in eastern Europe, in\nPoland, you would still find people of your father\u2019s generation with Jewish names,\nrather than let\u2019s say, with a Polish version, or in Hungary, a Hungarian version.\nThey would still be those old names, which sol \u2014 which kind of suggests the\nassimilation hadn\u2019t happened.",
        "A: Yeah, it wi \u2014 yeah, the \u2014 unfortunately, I have to say that the German Jews felt\nvery uppity about east European Jews, and the \u2014 and I don\u2019t \u2014 the older I get, the less\nI understand it, because I find out in looking at the family tree, that, for example \u2014\nwell, that f \u2014 the one thing that complicates everything is that because of all the wars\nover there, the \u2014 they \u2014 the people changed citizenship any time. I mean, they didn\u2019t\nknow who was running what part of the [indecipherable]. On my \u2014 on my wife\u2019s \u2014\nmy late wife\u2019s family, her name was Frankel, and her paternal family, ther \u2014 her\nfather was born in a place called Drohobych, in \u2014 in \u2014",
        "Q: Oh yes, in Poland, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Well, depends when you\u2019re talking about it.",
        "Q: That\u2019s true, that\u2019s true.January 12, 2016",
        "A: When he was born, it was Poland. In, I think from 1871, after the Franco-\nPrussian war, it became part of the \u2014 of the Austrian-Hungarian empire. Because not\nher father, but her uncles all served in the Austrian army in World War I. And then,\nafter World War I, it became \u2014 let\u2019s see, after World War I, I guess it was Polish, and\nafter World War II, I think now it\u2019s Ukrainian. So, I can show you a document that I\nhave, and they \u2014 the \u2014 the brothers of \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm, of your late wife.",
        "A: Of her father.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The fa \u2014 his generation, born 1885, he \u2014 her father was.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: His brothers, who were \u2014 their oldest one was born in \u2014 in \u201973, 1873, they all\nserved in the Austro-Hungarian army. I have pictures of them in Austrian-Hungarian\nuniform. And one of them, her father, I believe, when he came to Germany, he \u2014\nthey \u2014 they all had a business together in Hamburg, in Germany, and they ha \u2014\nFrankel is a pretty German name. And so he\u2019s \u2014 his \u2014 his fr \u2014 his first name when he\nwas born was Moses, and he changed it, in Germany, he changed it to Moritz(ph).\nSo in Germany, he was called Moritz(ph). And in 19 na \u2014 1920 \u2014 and I don\u2019t quite\nunderstand it, but I\u2019d have to study a lot of history to figure it out, but in 1920 he \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016\nhe wanted to go from Hamburg to Solingen, which is in what we now call North\nRhine-Westphalia \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 on a business trip. And he had to go to the Chamber of Commerce, for the\nChamber of Commerce to support \u2014 to support the request. And so, they supported\nthe request. And \u2014 but on the \u2014 on the application, or on this paper, there\u2019s a\nstatement, says, what\u2019s your nationality? And \u2014 1920, and \u2014 and he answered Polish.\nAnd \u2014 and printed on the form it said, and what was it before 1919? Because World\nWar I stopped in \u201918, what was \u2014 an \u2014 an-and then before \u2014 so, a year before, his\nnationality was Austro-Hungarian. So, you know, just trying to figure out what you\nwere, wasn\u2019t exactly easy in those days.",
        "Q: Could be confusing.",
        "A: It could be very confusing.",
        "Q: Very confusing.",
        "A: But they all \u2014 they \u2014 they then, you know, they all had then German first names,\nfrom about that period on.",
        "Q: Now, did you discover these things about your family through your own research,\nor were your parents storytellers, who told you about their lives, their childhoods,\nwhat \u2014 what \u2014 who their parents were, who their grandparents were? How did you\ndiscover what you ha \u2014 what you now know?January 12, 2016",
        "A: Well, I guess there are two answers to that, as a child. I lived in Germany until I\nwas eight years old, and as children we \u2014 we went to see the grandparents on my\nmother\u2019s side. My father \u2014 my father was the youngest of 10.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And his parents were long dead.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I never knew my pater \u2014 my \u2014 my father\u2019s parents, but he had all kinds of an \u2014\nbrothers and sisters, so we went to visit the aunts and the uncles, and so on. And I\nhappened to be very interested in fa \u2014 I always knew everybody. To this day, I can\ntell you what somebody looked like. But about their childhood, about my father\u2019s\nchildhood, I know absolutely nothing. I have a sister, Diane, who is a year older than\nI am, and she is a PhD from Berkeley, and very into social work, and I \u2014\noccasionally I consult with her, to find out whether she remembers. There are things\nthat she remembers differently than I do. But I know a lot more about the family\nthan \u2014 than she does. That was not part of her sphere of interest. On \u2014 so on my\nfather\u2019s side of the family, I knew \u2014 I knew unc \u2014 aunts and uncles as a child, just up\nto the time I was eight or nine. As a\u2014 on my mother\u2019s side of the family, I knew the\nfamily, cause as children, we spent every summer in Bavaria with my grandparents,\nand particularly with my mother\u2019s sisters kids, who were the same age we were.",
        "Q: Your \u2014 you said your father came from a family of 10?\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah \u2014",
        "Q: What about \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but you know \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it was, if you go and look at the family tree, his father was one of who\nknows how many, and \u2014 and they all had 10 \u2014 eight to 10 kids, so that trying to\nfigure this thing out like this, it\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: You can get a clan in no time. So, stories about your father\u2019s childhood, about his\ngrowing up, are kind of a blank, even though you did know your aunts and uncles,\nhis brothers and sisters. What about from your mother\u2019s side? How many siblings\ndid she have?",
        "A: She was one of four.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: She was the second oldest.",
        "Q: And were they all girls or boys \u2014 or were there some boys?",
        "A: Three girls, one boy.",
        "Q: Okay. And let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s go through names. What was your mother\u2019s name\u2019?",
        "A: Lilly(ph).",
        "Q: Lilly(ph). Lilly(ph) Lowenthal. And her \u2014 her sisters?",
        "A: Her oldest sister was Elsa(ph).\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Elsa(ph), okay.",
        "A: Her brother, who was next, was Walter.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And her small sister was Margaret.",
        "Q: All right. And your grandparents on her side?",
        "A: They\u2019re Hermann(ph), and Yula(ph).",
        "Q: And Yula(ph), all right.",
        "A: So they had \u2014 and my grandfather was born in 1857, so in \u2014 in 1857, his name\nwas already Hermann(ph).",
        "Q: Okay, so that\u2019s kind of like where the start \u2014 the start of this transition?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I never knew \u2014 I mean, I never knew that, that it would have been in this ye \u2014 in\nthese years that there would be this assimilation, this a \u2014 this attempt at assimilation.\nAnd, until Hitler, who knew that it wouldn\u2019t be successful, you know?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Because there was assimilation.",
        "A: It would have been successful. It was successful.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Was your mother\u2019s family \u2014 how did \u2014 how did your grandfather\nsupport your \u2014 his family, on your mother\u2019s side?",
        "A: Well, let me say that both of my families were fairly well-to-do.",
        "Q: Okay. That was one of my questions.",
        "A: Whatever that means.",
        "Q: Well, it means different things.",
        "A: My \u2014 my maternal grandfather, Hermann(ph) Lowenthal, in those days they had\nthe habit of marrying younger women, right?",
        "Q: That habit hasn\u2019t changed, you know.",
        "A: My \u2014 my grandfather was born in 1857, my grandmother was born in 1876, so\nshe was basically 20 years younger than he was. So, when we, as children, got to see\nhim, that was a big deal. We \u2014 he was an \u2014 already an old man. In those days, you\nknow, if you figure it out, he was 57; in 1900, he was 43; and in 1930, he was 73.\nWhen we knew him, he was at least 70 years old. My grandmother wasn\u2019t, but he\nwas. He had a \u2014 with his brothers, he had a ladies haberdashery store, a big one, in\nMunich, right one block from the bahnhof. And as kids, we were permitted to go\nthere, there was a building with two stories. The hats were made upstairs, not in\nChina. And \u2014 and we \u2014 we could watch them make the hats, and the thing that\nfascinated us is they had a \u2014 they had a dumbwaiter, or whatever you call the tubes.",
        "Q: Yeah.January 12, 2016",
        "A: They had a tube, so all of the \u2014 the \u2014 the accounting department was upstairs.",
        "Q: Oh, so that \u2014",
        "A: So somebody bought a hat, they pa \u2014 they gave the money, they got a bill, and\ngave the money to the salesperson, and it was put in the tube, and they took care of it\nupstairs.",
        "Q: How cool.",
        "A: And we th \u2014 we thought that was \u2014 as kids, we thought that was great. Those are\nthe little things I remember, but \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 our relationship with my grandparents was distant.",
        "Q: And why would that be?",
        "A: Very warm.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because chi \u2014 in those days, children \u2014 children \u2014 as one of my cousins famously\nsaid once, les enfants ne parle pas a table. He was French.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Children are seen, but not heard. Which is totally against everything that we\nbelieve in, because we f-figure that kids learn from talking with their parents, not the\nopposite. But in those days \u2014 now, what I have to add is that my grandparents had a\nmaid, the cook, everything goes with it. And the maid, Lena, was in charge of the\nJanuary 12, 2016\nkids when they came to visit, and my \u2014 my \u2014 my aunt and uncle \u2014 Elsa(ph), the older\nsister, lived around the corner. My \u2014 my grandparents had a big apartment. If you\u2019ve\never been to Munich, it\u2019s one block from the \u2014 from the Oktoberfest, from the\nTheresienwiese.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: That\u2019s where they lived. And my grandfather\u2019s brother lived in the building next\ndoor. And my aunt and uncle, now they lived in apartment houses, very nice\napartment houses where a floor was big. My aunt and uncle, Elsa(ph), and her\nhusband Karl(ph) Heiman(ph), they lived around the corner, they had a big villa.\nAnd so, as kids, we spent a lot of time over there, because their kids were the same\nage as we were, approximately. But when we got to Munich, to \u2014 with my\ngrandparents, Lena was in charge of us. Lena took us places, and \u2014 and then, you\nknow, my \u2014 my grandmother, I don\u2019t know what she did, but she worked in the store\nwith my grandfather. And they came home, you know, they come home for lunch,\nand they have a big lunch, the main meal, and then they take a nap. And then, I still\nhave that problem, when I eat, I always have to go to sleep. So don\u2019t feed me too\nsoon. They \u2014 we were permitted to stay up until my grandparents came home, about\n7:30, eight. We could spend 10 minutes with my grandparents, and then pff, off to\nbed we went. So \u2014",
        "Q: Formal.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: It was very formal.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was very formal. So \u2014",
        "Q: But is \u2014 they also sound like very nice memories.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Nobody was nasty.",
        "Q: Yeah. Oh, you know, from a childhood, you know, you \u2014 you\u2019re painting a\npicture for us, you know, of the bahnhof, of th \u2014 of the \u2014 of the, you know,\nhaberdashery store, of the \u2014 the tubes, and so on. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s exactly the kind of, I\nguess, evoca \u2014 you know, I want to have it evoked.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What did it look like, what did it feel like?",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, from a sociological point of view, what this means is,\nbecause they had a maid and a cook, that meant that the parents had time for other\nthings.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Nowadays, parents spend 24 hours a day catering to everybody, especially the\nmother.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, you know, it\u2019s a totally different world.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Well, when you look at houses here that were built for well-to-do people in the\nlate 19\"\", early 20\" centuries, there are often two staircases; one for the family, and\none for the servants, you know. And to maintain such houses in those days \u2014",
        "A: It took \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 you couldn\u2019t \u2014 you needed servants. And now \u2014",

        "Q: So it was coal oven. It was a co \u2014",
        "A: Coal oven, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: It was a coal oven, yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and then upstairs were the bedrooms, and then there was another floor\nabove, that had its own access to this little apartment, presumably for the maid, but\nour maids all came in. We had mainly one maid, she did everything. She raised my\nsister and me, and her name was Sophie, and she cooked. And the thing that I\nlearned, you know \u2014 you don\u2019t know yet \u2014 but I spent 25 years in Germany as an\nintelligence officer for the U.S. government. And because of my position, I had vil \u2014\nvillas, and they \u2014 in Berlin, and in \u2014 in Munich, I had similar houses. And the one\nJanuary 12, 2016\nthing that absolutely floored me, was that the kitchens were all abysmal. The\nkitchens were \u2014 I mean, they were small. All of them, every single one. In Berlin, in\nMunich, the \u2014 the \u2014 the kitchens and \u2014 and the one I \u2014 I \u2014 I grew up in, as a child,\nthey were all a postage stamp. And the only theory I have developed is that, you\nknow, this was for the angestellte, you know, it was for the \u2014",
        "Q: For the employees.",
        "A: \u2014 employees that didn\u2019t need much space, which is contrary to everything I\nbelieve in, but \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 the \u2014 my \u2014 my wife and I, my late wife and I, in Berlin, and \u2014 and in Munich,\nthe first thing we did when we moved into these houses is to change the kitchen. But\nyou couldn\u2019t enlarge it, there was no space, but you could change stove, and a few\nother things, you know, because it just wasn\u2019t functional according to our concept. I\nhad the good luck that the houses I lived in in Germany in my career were owned\nby the German government, and all I had to do is pick up the telephone, call the\nAmerican engineers, military engineers, and say hey, I need this and this, and it\ncame.",
        "Q: Let me tell you, that sounds like a dream renovation plan, you know.",

        "A: \u2014 what we\u2019re talking about, but when we took over Germany, if anything you \u2014\nyou wanted to know, I mean, it\u2019s there somewhere. You just have to find it. Because\neverything \u2014 records are kept, and they\u2019re written.",

        "A: Yes. The \u2014 on Redtenbacherstrasse, about two or three houses down, there was\na family, and his name was Peitken(ph), and they had two boys, and the older one\nwas my sister\u2019s age, and the younger one was my age. That mean \u2014 meant that the\nolder one was in the same grade as my sister, and I was \u2014 and the younger ones was\nin my class. And they were friends of ours. The younger one, Gurz(ph), was in my\ngrade. The minute the Hitler movement started, he became turned, and he wouldn\u2019tJanuary 12, 2016\nwant to play with me any more, and he called me a dirty Jew, and a few other things.\nThe older one always \u2014",
        "Q: Did he even know what he was saying?",
        "A: No, of course not. The older one never did that. He always remained friendly. But\nthere were, in my class of, I\u2019m guessing 25 kids, there were four Jewish boys. I was\none of four, and my sister was about the same. At the beginning, we had no problem\nat all, but once Hitler came to power, it became immediately \u2014 anybody who tells\nyou that actions against the Jews in Germany started with Kristallnacht is \u2014\ndoesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. It started right from the \u2014 the first,\nimmediately, in *33.",
        "Q: And you felt \u2014 and you felt 1t in school?",
        "A: Oh yeah, they started \u2014 every morning they had to raise the swastika flag, and\nthey had to sing the \u2014 the \u2014 the Nazi national anthem, the Horst-Wessel-Lied, you\nknow. De file \u2014 I can sing it for you, you know.",
        "Q: I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s bittersweet, but what do you remember? T-Tell me, what do\nyou remember from \u2014",
        "A: Well, I can \u2014I get \u2014 I know the words for the Horst-Wessel-Lied because we had\nto sing it every morning. And then, you know, the first year, I don\u2019t remember who\nmy teacher was the first year. It may have been the same one, but I don\u2019t remember\nthat. The second year, I had a guy by the name of Meininger(ph), who turned out to\nJanuary 12, 2016\nbe the head of the Nazi party in the area. And so, he took every opportunity to make\nsnide remarks about the \u2014 the Jewish kids. And \u2014",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s very cruel, you\u2019re children \u2014",
        "A: Oh, he was \u2014 and you know, my sister always laughs about it, but she always\nlucked out. Her \u2014 her teacher was the nicest guy in the world, always. And I always\ngot these \u2014 these \u2014 you know, this \u2014 this was a tough age. I mean, you know, I was\nwhat, seven years old, eight years old, seven years old. And if you did anything\nwrong, you know \u2014 he had a stick, and you had to stick your hand out, and he went \u2014\nyou know, and it burned. And you know, he wasn\u2019t careful with Jewish kids, I mean,\nthere\u2019s all these little, more than innuendoes. It was picked on, you know, and there\nwith watch \u2014 they would watch us. We had to salute, or something, when the flag\nwas raised every morning, and they would watch us. And if \u2014 if the Meininger(ph)\nfelt like \u2014 like it, he said well, you didn\u2019t stand at attention when we were playing\nthe Horst-Wessel-Lied. Stuff like that. All this little stuff, you know.",
        "Q: But again, in my mind, I\u2019m thinking of a grown person, a grown \u2014 an adult, and\nyou\u2019re not even grown children, you\u2019re little kids, you know\u2019?",
        "A: I\u2019m just a little kid, yeah.",
        "Q: You\u2019re little kids, six or seven years old.",
        "A: Seven years old.",
        "Q: Seven years old, and he\u2019s picking on little kids.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah. Well, but he was a Nazi, you know, they don\u2019t know the difference.",
        "Q: And, was your family religious?",
        "A: Jein.",
        "Q: I love that German expression jein.",
        "A: Jein means yeah, yes, and nein. So if it\u2019s so-so, you know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My mother was \u2014 tended to be. She grew up in Munich, in the Jewish youth\nmovement, she was a leader in a Jewish youth movement in Munich.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My dad couldn\u2019t \u2014 get away farther from religion than he possibly could. The\nonly time he ever went in a synagogue 1s when he married my mother, and that was\nthe first and the last time.",
        "Q: Was there a reason why for him? Did he ever explain it?",
        "A: I think the answer to your question is no. Unfortunately, my sister and I have\noften bemoaned the fact that we never found out anything about Dad, about th \u2014\nwell, he died young, too, so the years when you would have done that, maybe, but\nwe could have found out something when he was young. We only know tidbits about\nhim. He \u2014 our impression is that there was this \u2014 there were a lot of Jews in\nGermany that wanted so badly to be German, that they \u2014 being Jewish was \u2014",
        "Q: Something you wanted to get away from.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, or at least you ignored it. Now, he married my mother, and \u2014 in a Jewish\nwedding, that \u2014 but it was \u2014 it was an arranged wedding, so that \u2014",
        "Q: So he still \u2014 I mean, he still \u2014 if it was an arranged wedding, that means he agreed\nin an old traditional way, to find a wife and a bride, not in a new modern way, but in\na way that \u2014",
        "A: Well, my mother \u2014 you know, I\u2019ve read some of this stuff with \u2014 earlier heirs. My\nmother belonged to a generation that was not subserv \u2014 where the wim \u2014 as a\nwoman, she was not subservient to men, which was a new thing.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And she had her own \u2014 she was well educated, better than her siblings. My father\nwas educated better than his siblings, and I think that was the common denominator.\nThey both went to the university \u2014 Mother went to hohertesteschule(ph). I don\u2019t\nknow how to translate that.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t ee \u2014 I don\u2019t understand.",
        "A: It\u2019s a\u20141t\u2019s a\u2014 well, it\u2019s above \u2014 it\u2019s above high school.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It\u2019s not university, but it\u2019s for \u2014 for girls from families that had the money to send\nthem to another school, they \u2014 they \u2014 they did. And she was \u2014 she was very well\neducated. But my father served for four years in the German army, in World War I.\nGot the Iron Cross, and the whole deal.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Was he a patriot?",
        "A: Yes. And that\u2019s something that has not writ \u2014 been written about \u2014 enough, about\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the pre-war, pre-Hitler Germany, but th-there were a lot of them who\nwere patriots. He was very proud to have served in the German army. And that\u2019s one\nof the reasons why so \u2014 and then Hitler came, in \u201933, and immediately, Jews were\nscum. And my father, who was a man of great integrity, he \u2014 he couldn\u2019t accept that.\nAnd that\u2019s why he left. He left in \u2014 he started leaving in 34, it took two years to do\nthe whole move.",
        "Q: And there are two \u2014 there \u2014 we\u2019ll come to that in a moment, but there\u2019s an\nimpression that I get from your telling, that \u2014 and tell me whether or not this is an\naccurate impression \u2014 one, it must have been extremely painful. If you had \u2014 if you\nsi\u2014 identified yourself with a nation and a people, and all of a sudden you\u2019re thrown\nout of that, it\u2019s a real \u2014 it\u2019s a personal rejection. Then \u2014",
        "A: Yes, especially if you just finished serving four years, risking your life \u2014",
        "Q: Life.",
        "A: \u2014 for the country that\u2019s doing it to you.",
        "Q: Yeah. So that \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m sus \u2014 that\u2019s the impression I would get, if you \u2014 if\nyou believed in it, if you put your heart and soul into it, and put your life on the line,\nthis is \u2014 this is personal. Number two, there\u2019s a great deal of foresight in that. Very\nfew people left in 1933, ?34, \u201935 \u2014 you know, most were saying, it \u2014 1t\u2019Il blow over.January 12, 2016",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You know? He\u2019s not someone to take seriously. All the intelligent people don\u2019t\ntake him seriously, you know, and so on and so forth. Was \u2014 was that part of your\npar \u2014 your father\u2019s decision making, too? Was he calculating, in that way?",
        "A: Well, I think \u2014 I think \u2014 I can\u2019t prove it \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 but I think that the reason we went to France is because of that. That all of his\nrelatives, on both sides of the family, said [speaks other language] you know, all\nthis will go away. Hitler won\u2019t last, the others didn\u2019t. And so they didn\u2019t leave. And\nso my father, I guess argued with himself that if he went t-to France, when it\u2019s all\nover, he can come back.",
        "Q: Yeah, it\u2019s not so far.",
        "A: Yeah. So he didn\u2019t \u2014 th-the consideration of going to the United States, at that\nparticular time, if it came up for discussion, I never heard it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So I don\u2019t think it did. So we went to France. Whereas, on his side of the family,\neverybody stayed. They were \u2014 well, I\u2019ll tell you a little bit about his family, but \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 the \u2014 on my mother\u2019s side, the \u2014 the leader, kind of, in Mother\u2019s side of the\nfamily was her sister al \u2014 Elsa\u2019s husband, Karl(ph) Heiman(ph), who was veryJanuary 12, 2016\nwealthy, had a big textile business, and he knew everybody in government, and\nelsewhere. And, you know, they kind of pooh-poohed the fact that dad wanted to\nleave Germany.",
        "Q: And did Dad want to leave Germany because he was so hurt, or because he said\nmm-mm, nothing good out of this.",
        "A: It\u2019s hard to answer. It\u2019s probably both. I \u2014 he was hurt. He had quote unquote,\nloyal customers for years, butchers mainly, who one day when he, or his\nrepresentative walked in to see him, said we don\u2019t do business with dirty Jews.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And so, you know, you only need to hear that a few times before you \u2014 before\nyou say hey, do I have to put up with this?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: So it was \u2014 but the fact that he had been in the military for four years during the\nwar, definitely played into it, because his \u2014 his brothers \u2014 well, one of them was in\nthe military, I don\u2019t know much about that, but an-and his \u2014 on my mother\u2019s side of\nthe family, nobody was ever close to that. And you know, there\u2019s lots been written,\nIve read a lot. I have a book written by a German, at the request of the German\nMinister of Defense, that\u2019s in my f \u2014 later life, and \u2014 which explains what being a\nJew in\u2014 in Germany was like in 1914, when the Kaiser said \u2014 when the Kaiser said\nto the Germans, you must all come fight with me for the \u2014 so on. The Jews \u2014 th-theJanuary 12, 2016\ngrand rabbi in Berlin, and I got his words, I got his sermon, had a \u2014 had a service in\nwhich he said, we Jews must \u2014 we must answer the call of the Kaiser. The grand\nrabbi of Berlin. So that was the frame of mind.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that was the frame of mind of many German Jews.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s tur \u2014 let\u2019s turn a little bit to a different area, but we\u2019ll come back to this.\nTell me a bit about your parents\u2019 personalities; your mother\u2019s personality, your\nfather\u2019s personality. What kind of people were they?",
        "A: Well, my mother had a never-ending social conscience. She \u2014 all of her life she\nwas always doing things for other people. She started as a student in Munich. She\nwas the head of the Jewish youth, and I \u2014 I have some letters in my documents,\nwhere the \u2014 the \u2014 the council of Jewish \u2014 the Jewish congregation sent her a letter\nthanking her for having led the effort during the elections, and without her, it never\nwould have happened. She was like this all her life, as I will explain to you later.\nWithout that kind of consciousness, I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here. But my dad was very\nintelligent. He was mainly, in the years that I knew him, he was mainly consumed in\nmaking a living, which became ever more difficult in Germany, because of what I\nsaid. And then when he went to France, nothing really worked.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come to that.",
        "A: Yeah.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come to that. But, as far as \u2014 who did you go to when you wanted to tell\nsomething about what was going on in your day, in your life?",
        "A: Mother.",
        "Q: Yeah? Okay. Same with your sister?",
        "A: Yeah. My father favored my sister over me, but my sister, we have a strain in the\nfamily, of petite woman, my sister had that strain. My father had a sister who was\npetite, and my \u2014 my grandmother, whom I never knew, my father\u2019s mother, was very\npetite. I think that\u2019s where the line is.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Then my Aunt Josephine was like that. My sister is four foot 10, maybe.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 and so she always was pale, and my father always protected her, so that \u2014\nyou know, and I was just the boy.",
        "Q: That\u2019s just not fair.",
        "A: It\u2019s all right, it didn\u2019t bother me. You know, I did my own thing, but it just \u2014 so\nmy father was more \u2014 I don\u2019t think she talked that much more with him than I did.\nYou know, in those days, fathers would say to you, are you doing your homework,\nas he went whizzing through the room. And it was just that kind of a world.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Mother was concerned with all of the things we did.January 12, 2016",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That was her job.",
        "Q: Do you remember how they broke it to you that, we\u2019re leaving Karlsruhe? You\nknow, was it an adventure, we\u2019re going someplace, or was it, we got to get out of\nhere? Do you remember them telling you about it?",
        "A: No. I\u2014 what led up to it, what I said before, let\u2019s start 1t from the beginning. We\nwitnessed a number of things happening \u2014",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: \u2014 around us.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The one \u2014 for example, they arrested Jews from the beginning. I mean, in 1933,\nthe people who were judges, and university professors, and in charge of the opera, at\nany position, who were Jewish, were out of a job. And they arrested people. There\nwas a family that we were friendly with, he \u2014 he was the Minister of Justice of \u2014 of\nwhatever it was then, Baden? It was in Baden-Wiurttemberg then. But \u2014 and he\nwas a socialist, and so he ha \u2014 and he was Jewish. So he had three strikes against\nhim, and he got arrested in the first bunch, and what they did, they put them on open\ntrucks, and they drove them through the city of Karlsruhe, so that people could spit\nat them.",
        "Q: This was the Nazis?\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Nazi \u2014 you know \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, they were the Brownshirts. The SS, we didn\u2019t see, but the Brownshirts,\nthere was Brownshirts all over the place. And they were just, you know, and they\nhad signs, Juden raus, whatever. Whatever one through the ages I\u2019ve seen, they had\nit. And \u2014 and \u2014 and the people on these trucks went to a concentration camp that\nyou\u2019ve never heard of before, and I can\u2019t remember. But \u2014",
        "Q: Was it local?",
        "A: Local, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. So it started from the beginning.",
        "Q: Did you ever have these pleasant visits at your home?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Not that I remember, because it didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think they started before \u00b035.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Maybe even later. But they did arrest people they didn\u2019t like. Hitler didn\u2019t \u2014\nHitler didn\u2019t like, I don\u2019t know in what order, trade unionists, socialists, Jews,\nFreemasons, har \u2014 I hardly believe anybody knew what a Freemason was, but you\nknow, it sounded good.January 12, 2016",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t like them.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t like them. And so, if you were on any of these lists, or if you were on\ntwo lists, heaven forbid, you know. Then Catholics. He had a big war going on with\nthe Catholic church in certain places, certain times.",
        "Q: Interesting. I think he was born Catholic, wasn\u2019t he?",
        "A: I have no idea. It was a mistake that he was born.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 I mean, when you think about the psychology of it, the \u2014 Hitler\nwas a little guy with dark hair, a brown mustache, and he said that to be a good\nGerman, you had to be blonde and blue eyed. Now where \u2014 how does he fit into this\nthing, you know? So that people fell for this, that is unbelievable, but \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: There are some things that don\u2019t have logical explanations.",
        "A: They don\u2019t have logic, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember leaving Karlsruhe?",
        "A: Not really. PIl tell you why. I said before that we left in \u201934, \u201935, and that\u2019s a true\nstatement. We left, step by step, it wasn\u2019t that we left.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: The kids, that means my sister and I, were first sent to Munich.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: With the grandparents.",
        "A: With \u2014 actually with my aunt and uncle, but \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 same thing. Around the corner.",
        "Q: The ones who didn\u2019t want to leave?",
        "A: The ones who didn\u2019t want to leave. And well, in those days you didn\u2019t talk that\nmuch about it, but that \u2014 you know, we were just sent to Munich, or taken to\nMunich, I guess, my mother took us. And we stayed with my aunt and uncle and\ntheir three kids, I would say, for three or four months. And \u2014 and that was in 734.\nMaybe the fall of \u201934 \u2014 I \u2014 the fall of \u201934. After school \u2014 there was no school. The\nnew school year was starting, but it was at the end of \u201934. And then, after that, we\nwere shipped from there \u2014 shipped to \u2014 to Mannheim, to stay with my father\u2019s\noldest brother, and his wife. We stayed with them for three or four months. And then\nwe were sent to Switzerland. My father had a sister in the Zurich area, and her\nhusband was a teacher out in the country. And we were sent there for three or four\nmonths. And we stayed with them on a farm.",
        "Q: It sounds like \u201cHeidi.\u201d",
        "A: It sounds like \u201cHeidi.\u201d We were on a farm, and I\u2014 I was \u2014 I didn\u2019t go to school\nthat whole year, and I was \u2014 I would go out every morning with the farmer, who\nowned the farm, a \u2014 out in the fields, and where they put hay together, and I was\nJanuary 12, 2016\npermitted to feed the cows, and stuff like that, you know. It was a new world for me.\nAnd so the whole thing, that \u2014 that Munich, Mannheim, Switzerland, that was\nabout a year.",
        "Q: What were they doing, your parents?",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were setting up \u2014 they were taking care of the formalities\nrequired to move to France. I can\u2019t tell you where they lived at the time, whether\nthey \u2014 probably partially in Germany, and partially in \u2014 in F-France, but they\nweren\u2019t anywhere where we were. They came every once in a while to see us, of\ncourse.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But so it \u2014 it\u2019s in September of \u201935, that we left Switzerland, and moved to\nMarseilles.",
        "Q: So, I have a few questions. Do you know if your father was able to sell his\nbusiness, or did he have to leave it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I assume he sold it, but I \u2014 they \u2014 they didn\u2019t take things away from you yet, at\nthat time.",
        "Q: And when \u2014 when you moved to Marseilles, that is, did you take anything of\nyour own personal belongings with you? Was there furniture, was this \u2014January 12, 2016",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You \u2014 so your household, did it come with you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And why Marseilles?",
        "A: My father had a good friend who was a businessman in Marseilles. I think that\u2019s\nthe reason.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He helped him get established.",
        "Q: Okay. So he didn\u2019t know what \u2014 many other people in France, and this person \u2014\nI\u2019m making that assumption.",
        "A: Yeah, he \u2014 he \u2014 this person was an \u2014 originally from Austria. His name was\nCharles Pollack(ph). And he had a \u2014 he was an importer/exporter in Marseilles, and\nhe was a friend of his, and so he \u2014 he was \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m sure the reason why they were\nvery closely connected when we first got there.",
        "Q: Okay. So tell me, what was Marseilles like? When you get there, you\u2019re eight\nyears old, nine years old, something like that? What was the world \u2014 what was the\nimpression? What was your first impression?",
        "A: Well, they tried to teach us a little French in Mannheim, so that we wouldn\u2019t be\ntotally lost. And the one sentence I can remember is the, La boeuf - der Ochs, la\nvache - die kuh, ferm\u00e9 la porte \u2014 mach tir it zu.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Tell me, what does that mean?",
        "A: The ox \u2014 no, la boeuf is \u2014 is the ox, in French.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: La boeuf \u2014 the ox, in German.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: La vache is a cow, die kuh \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Ferme la porte - close the door, mach tir it zu.",
        "Q: That sounds like a rhyme.",
        "A: Yeah, it 1s.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. But we didn\u2019t know much French, but so they decided they \u2014 the powers\nthat be \u2014 that means my father and mother, decided to send us to private school.\nNow, you have to remember, in those days \u2014 I don\u2019t know how it is today, but in\nthose days, boys and girls never went to school together. Boys\u2019 schools and girls\u2019\nschools.",
        "Q: But were these religious schools? Were these \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. They were simply private schools.January 12, 2016",
        "A: Just \u2014 I was sent to a thing called [speaks French], it was a private school, not\ntoo far from where we lived. My sister went to a thing called [speaks French] which\nwas in a different direction, but about the same distance. And we were there to learn\nFrench. And I was there, I would say, two semesters, to learn French, and then both\nof us transferred to the lyc\u00e9e. I went to the boys\u2019 lyc\u00e9e, when I was 10, I guess. I\nwent to the boys\u2019 lyc\u00e9e, and she went to the girls\u2019 lyc\u00e9e. Mine was called\nSanshal(ph), but it was not religious, it was public. And hers was Lyc\u00e9e Toma(ph)\nsame thing, public.",
        "Q: Well, how \u2014 how did it compare to school in Germany? What were the\nsimilarities, what were the differences?",
        "A: I think I have to think about that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I \u2014 I\u2019ve given that a thought. It \u2014 anything French is different from\nanything German.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: France is more fluid. Germany is [makes sound effect] especially under Hitler.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In my book I\u2019ve written that when I came back to Germany a-as a\u2014 asa\nlieutenant in 1953, and I was on a train from Bremerhaven to Frankfurt, and I\nlooked out the window and I said \u2014 it all reminded me of everybody living in a box.\nJanuary 12, 2016\nNothing is like that, it\u2019s all \u2014 it still 1s today, in my opinion. Not the same way, but\nthe Germans have a certain way of being, and the French have a certain way of\nbeing.",
        "Q: Okay, so maybe I should put the question this way; what was school like for you\nin Marseilles?",
        "A: I had no problem.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I did well in \u2014 in [speaks French], you know, I can show you the report cards.\nAnd then went to lyc\u00e9e, and I \u2014 the classes weren\u2019t that big. I would say about 20. I\ncan count that for you, but it was about 20, maybe a little more. And I started in what\n\u2014 you know, in France, the \u2014 it goes the other way. The neuvi\u00e9me, the ninth grade 1s\n\u2014 is \u2014 or dixi\u00e9me, 10\" grade is for little kids, and it goes down to one, which is for\n17, 18 years old.",
        "Q: Boy, would that confuse me.",
        "A: Yeah, well, it\u2019s just the other way around.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So I started in neuvi\u00e9me \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 1n the \u2014 1n the ninth grade, and by \u2014 by the time I was in the eighth grade, in\nhuiti\u00e9me, you know, you \u2014 you had to take exams, and everything, in main subjects,\nJanuary 12, 2016\nand in huiti\u00e9me, there were subject French, Latin, mathematics, geography, history.\nAnd in huiti\u00e9me, which means I was in \u2014 in France two years, I got the first place in\nFrench. And did that cal \u2014 cause an upset in the school.",
        "Q: Well, yes.",
        "A: I mean, the \u2014 the teacher \u2014 the teacher, who was very French, a lady teacher, she\nstood in front of the class, and she practically screamed at them. Said, a little\nGerman kid comes in here, and he has the first place in French? And, well, I had to\nwork harder, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: For me it was always had to start from scratch, and I had to really put work into\nthis. The others, they just sat there and enjoyed themselves.",
        "Q: So this is interesting, she called you the little German kid?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was that how everybody saw you there, as you\u2019re the German kid? Is that how\npeople saw you and your family in Marseilles?",
        "A: Well, yeah, I guess so, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You know, there are other stories that I didn\u2019t \u2014 all my ki \u2014 my friends were, you\nknow, French kids. We were \u2014 we were all buddies. I mean, I\u2019ve \u2014 I met them until I\nwas over seven years old. The \u2014 the \u2014 we \u2014 lyc\u00e9e was kind of a protected society,January 12, 2016\nvery well organized, and you knew what you could do, and what you couldn\u2019t do,\nand you learned, and you had good teachers or bad teachers, like everywhere else.\nWe had mostly good teachers. And so, you know, I liked lyc\u00e9e very much. So did\nmy sister. My sister was the top student in her lyc\u00e9e.",
        "Q: My question was more to your \u2014 you\u2019ve moved from Germany to France, and\nare you immigrants, are you refugees? And how did the people in Marseilles look at\nyou, identify you? How \u2014 you know, how do you fit in as a family, as \u2014",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we were \u2014 rented an apartment, which we kept the entire time, in a\nmiddle class neighborhood.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: There were certain things that were primitive. Like we lived on the top floor of\nfive stories, and no elevators or anything like this. The bathroom had a tub, but no\nhot water. And it was \u2014",
        "Q: Was it a step down from Karlsruhe in modern conveniences?",
        "A: Yeah, it was falling off the mountain. It was a step down, but as kids you don\u2019t\nrealize it. Our parents saw to it that we had everything we needed. We never went\nhungry. We went to school, we had a regulated life, and we had friends.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And even though for adults we were called German refugees, I guess, I don\u2019t\nthink any of them, or most of them didn\u2019t understand that \u2014 why we had come there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016\nSo, you know, when the war started, the \u2014 the \u2014 we had to impress people that we\nknew with the fact that we were much more at danger than they were. Because to\nthem, they were just Frenchmen. We were Germans who had left Germany because\nof Hitler.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And so it \u2014 that was totally different thing, but \u2014",
        "Q: Were there many others like you, at that time, in ni \u2014 in the mid-30s, in\nMarseilles?",
        "A: There were some. We had some neighbors two houses down that were in the\nsame situation. Not too many.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 there were two \u2014 there were two aspects. One is, were there any\nother Jewish people \u2014",
        "Q: Yes, that\u2019s one \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 French Jews.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And the other is, what about the German refugees? Now, the German refugees,\nthere were a number of them. Some of them were doctors, for example. Our doctor\nwas always somebody who was a German Jew. And even there, you have to split\nhairs, because a lot of them came from the Saarland. The Saarland was FrenchJanuary 12, 2016\nfrom World War I, until 1935 or six, when they had a plebiscite, and they opted to\ngo with Germany. And so the Jewish people in Saarland, when this happened,\nmoved into France because they\u2019d been living in France, and that was the natural\nthing. A lot of people from Saarland, who lived in France afterwards, after the\nSaar opted to go back to Germany.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, our doctor was one of those, and there were a number of people like that, but\nnot many. Now, the Jewish people, I suspected if my parents had been religious, they\ncould have become more active, but that was not my father\u2019s cup of tea. And my\nmother was always conciliatory. And she did take my sister and me to the services at\nthe Jewish synagogue, the main one \u2014 there were several \u2014 but the main one, for the\nhigh holidays.",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t regular, it was just sort of \u2014",
        "A: Just \u2014 just \u2014",
        "Q: Just for the high holidays.",
        "A: \u2014 Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 but otherwise we didn\u2019t. And the French Jews did not \u2014 any generalization\nis \u2014 is bad, but generally speaking, the French Jews were not particularly interested\nJanuary 12, 2016\nin German Jews. They were not nasty or anything, but they \u2014 they didn\u2019t understand\nthat we were all in the same boat, as it turned out to be later.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But so, there was one family that was very nice. Well-known family that invited\nus, and stuff like that, but generally speaking, there was no effort on part of the \u2014 the\n\u2014 the French Jews in Marseilles for an outreach towards the Jews from other\ncountries that had showed up.",
        "Q: It was \u2014 it was too early for that consciousness. Is that what \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, what about your friends then, did you \u2014 so I take it most of your\nfriends were not Jewish in Marseilles?",
        "A: All of my friends were not Jewish.",
        "Q: All of your friends were not Jewish. Well, did you ever \u2014 if you went to the\nsynagogue on high holidays, did you ever go with them to \u2014",
        "A: Catholic mass?",
        "Q: Yeah, did you?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: I know more abou-bout French Catholicism than I know about French\n[indecipherable]. I grew up, you know, in a world that was all \u2014 that\u2019s why some of\nJanuary 12, 2016\nthe things that happen in this country, I don\u2019t understand, because I grew up ina\nCatholic country.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: There \u2014 there was no \u2014 no challenge to the Catholic church. And the Catholic\nchurch in France is very subdued, but they\u2019re there.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And you know, you \u2014 if you were Catholic, as my best friend was, anything we\ndid, like we became Boy Scouts.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Anything that we did \u2014 if we left at seven o\u2019clock on Sunday morning to go\ncamping, or go out somewhere on the coast, or something, he\u2019d get up at four and go\nto mass. And \u2014 and \u2014 and at seven o\u2019clock, he was where he was supposed to be.\nNobody ever talked about the fact that he\u2019d gone to mass. If I hadn\u2019t known him so\nwell, I\u2014I wouldn\u2019t have known it. But, you know, that religion was a private part of\nyour life. And France to this day, you know, is very secular. I mean, very secular.\nThat \u2014 the \u2014 Dallas \u2014 you don\u2019t know this, but Dallas has a school called the Dallas\nInternational School, which the word international you can question, because it\u2019s\ntotally French. I mean, from the top guy down it\u2019s French, and they speak French,\nand the kids all know French, learn French, and so on. But it says on the \u2014 on a big\nsign, that this is a \u00e9cole laique, a lay school.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Ah, secular school.",
        "A: Secular school. Don\u2019t misunderstand, this is not a French Catholic school. This is\na secular school.",
        "Q: And why 1s this such a articulated distinction?",
        "A: It\u2019s the French constitution. Separation of church and state is in the French\nconstitution.",
        "Q: And it permeated down, and actually means something \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 at \u2014 at an everyday level.",
        "A: Now the French \u2014 French Catholics \u2014 like everything else in life, there are many\nexceptions, but the French Catholics are not super-religious. But they do get married\nin the church, and they \u2014 they go to the fu-funerals in the church, and the \u2014 there\u2019s\ncertain things that happen.",
        "Q: So how did it come about that you went to mass?",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I never felt I was anything special, you know, I like to know how other people\nlive. If he\u2019s my best friend, I want to know what makes him tick, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah. That\u2019s true.January 12, 2016",
        "A: And it \u2014 it was never a problem. You know, I didn\u2019t go every Sunday or anything\nlike that, but \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 if there was a special occasion.",
        "Q: But it means you had exposure.",
        "A: Had exposure.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was not a strange thing.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The father of one of my best friends passed away, and they had the funeral in the\nchurch. And in the Catholic ceremony, in France, I don\u2019t know how it is here, the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the coffin is covered by a cloth, and it\u2019s in the middle \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 everybody is around it. And then, at a certain point in the ceremony, everybody\ngets the \u2014 what is a scepter, what is a li-little thing that the priest bless things with,\nyou know, one of these things. It\u2019s got a name.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t remember.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: But, you know, and the priest will hand that to the person next to him, family\nfirst, and everybody stands around the coffin and, you know, you make the sign of\nthe cross. Well, you know, I was 10 years old. When that thing got to me, what do I\ndo now, you know? I was trying real hard to look at everybody else and wha \u2014\nwhat\u2019s going on here, you know\u2019?",
        "Q: How do you \u2014 yeah, how do you do this?",
        "A: But, you learn that way, you know?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And was Boy Scouts fun? Did you like Boy Scouts?",
        "A: Yeah. You know, Boy Scouts were Eclaireurs Unionistes de France. Now, you\nhad the main boy scouts in France are Catholic, ec \u2014 Scouts de France, Scouts of\nFrance, Catholic.",

        "A: Eclaireurs Unionistes de France were the Protestants scouts.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No, they were organized by some religious order.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But they didn\u2019t ask you when you joined, what you were. And so the reason my\nfriend George, who lived next door, and I belonged to the \u2014 and he was a very\nJanuary 12, 2016\nstrong Catholic \u2014 why we belonged to the Eclaireurs Unionistes de France is\nbecause it was one block from our house. It was convenient.",

        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And there were also the Eclaireurs Israeli de France.",
        "Q: Oh, was there?",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t choose to join them. They were on the other side of town anyway,\nthey were \u2014 would have been so complicated, that \u2014 you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But, so I belonged to the \u2014 to the Protestant scouts. I \u2014 whatever, you know.",
        "Q: Okay. How \u2014 how were things going for your father, in supporting the family?\nWhat was he doing, what was he trying to do?",
        "A: In France?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He tried to be an em \u2014 importer-exporter, as he was, in a way, before. He \u2014 he \u2014\nspecializing on sausage casings, that he knew everything about, and \u2014 and spices.\nAnd so he, again, dealt with butchers.",
        "Q: Okay.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: But \u2014 and he did that. He must have made some money, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t\nhave eaten, or paid the rent. But the \u2014 the main problem was political, or\nadministrative, in a sense that the French police, the security \u2014 Siret\u00e9, that dealt\nwith foreigners, was totally unpredictable. You never knew. My parents had a\nresidence permit, I believe by the year. Every year they had to renew it. And so, I\u2019m\nguessing, in \u201937 or eight, probably closer to seven, but maybe somewhere at the end\nof seven, beginning of eight, he went on a business trip to the f \u2014 Swiss border, to\nBasel. And he was in Basel visiting clients, and then he said \u2014 he had a client over\non the other side.",
        "Q: Beani \u2014 meaning where?",
        "A: In Switzerland.",
        "Q: In Switzerland.",
        "A: But you know, Basel is right on the border.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And it\u2019s parch \u2014 partially the suburbs. I mean, in France, in \u2014 the main city is.\nThe downtown is in Switzerland. And \u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me for a second, can we cut? I hear music. [break] Okay, so your father\u2019s\nin Basel, visiting a client, and \u2014",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 the way it went is, he went to the border \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.January 12, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 where the \u2014 they had \u2014 if you ever tried to get into Switzerland, you know\nthat\u2019s a major job. They \u2014 he went to the border station at the French side, and asked\nthem whether he could go to Switzerland, to Basel, just to visit a client. And the\nguy in the \u2014 in the French custom house, or custom, or maybe immigration police,\nwhatever the p \u2014 the guy was, said, well you gotta go over there, and ask. So he went\nto the Swiss guy, on \u2014 you know, hundred feet, maybe. And he said, this is who I\nam, and I\u2019d like to visit a client. And so they accused him of having crossed the\nborder illegally.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And so they didn\u2019t do much, except they made note of it. And then he went back\nto \u2014 and he did go over, but he went back to Marseilles, and from then on, in his\npolice record, it said in Marseilles that he crossed the border illegally. And that was\nadded to the following historic fact.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That my mother and my dad were in Marseilles, I believe around the 20\" of\nOctober, 1934, to lay things out.",
        "Q: So this is before you even moved there.",
        "A: And they \u2014 they were downtown. The king of Yugoslavia, Alexander the first,\ncame on a State visit, and he went in a motorcade down the \u2014 the Canebiere, which\nis the main street in Marseilles. And they were standing in front of \u2014 front of theJanuary 12, 2016\nstock exchange, and within, I don\u2019t know, a hundred feet of them, King Alexander\nwas shot by a Croatian terrorist, and the French foreign minister, Barthou, was\nwounded seriously. And because they were so worried about Alexander, they forgot\nabout Barthou, and he bled to death. And so Alexander was \u2014 King Alexander was\nkilled, and so was Barthou. And all of the foreigners who were in Marseilles on\nthat day, got put in a register. And when this thing \u2014 when the Swiss border came up,\nthere now were two facts against him. He was in Marseilles when the king of\nYugoslavia was assassinated, which he obviously had absolutely nothing to do with,\nbut he was there.",
        "Q: Yeah, okay.",
        "A: And then he crossed the border into Switzerland illegally. And that haunted him\nfrom \u2014 from then on.",
        "Q: Bureaucracy, you know, sort of \u2014",
        "A: And you know, in the French police, you had \u2014 you had good guys and bad guys,\nlike everywhere else, and so this was \u2014 so that was in \u00b034. In \u201937 \u2014 eight, he had that\nSwiss thing, and the \u2014 the next time they went to extend their \u2014 their \u2014 their \u2014 it may\n\u2014I don\u2019t know whether it was the next time, or the time afterwards, when they went\nto extend their annual \u2014",
        "Q: Residence vi \u2014January 12, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 residence visa, they arrested them, both my parents, for being in France\nillegally. And \u2014",
        "Q: But that\u2019s not true, because they had all the permit \u2014 okay, it doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "A: Well, truth \u2014 truth di \u2014 truth is unimportant when somebody wants to do\nsomething who has police power.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And so they kept my father, and they let my mother go because she had two\nchildren. I was about 12, 13, and my sister was 13, 14.",
        "Q: So this would have been \u201937 \u2014 \u201938?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was definitely before the war. And th-the strange thing about it \u2014 there are\nmany strange things about it, but one of them was that that particular afternoon, my\nsister and I had been invited to the home of one of her teachers for her son\u2019s birthday\nparty. And my sister was invited, and they let come along, because my parents had to\ngo to the police. And you know, and all the kids left, and my sister and I were there,\nand Mother didn\u2019t show up. And then ultimately she did show up. And she walked in\nthe door, and she said, they have arrested my husband. And it so happens that this\nteacher\u2019s husband was a high police official, and \u2014 which helped, because obviously\nthey knew who we were, they knew us and they were friendly. But nevertheless, my\nJanuary 12, 2016\nmother was out on temporary whatever, my dad was in jail. In jail, where they put\nhim in a cell with a \u2014 with a guy who killed a captain in the es \u2014 a guy who killed a\ncaptain in the French harbor. And they put my father in with him, because he was\nfrom Switzerland, they boy spoke German.",
        "Q: Well, there\u2019s something in common, you know.",
        "A: You know, I mean a \u2014 it \u2014 the circumstances of \u2014 of some of these things 1s just\nunbelievable. So my dad was in jail, which I think did more to attack his health than\nanything else, because he was a \u2014 again, a man of great integrity. Now he\u2019s sitting in\na French jail. French jails are not known to be exactly nice places.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And so after about a month \u2014 and I have no idea whether it was \u2014 it was quite a\nwhile. I don\u2019t know, it was four week, six weeks, whatever it was, they \u2014 they\nbrought him up for trial, and he was acquitted. So he came home. But he was very\nmuch taken by this. But my mother wasn\u2019t tried, hadn\u2019t been tried, because she was\na separate case, I guess. And so a little while later they \u2014 they tried her. And they\nfound her guilty. And so, really \u2014",
        "Q: And so what happened to her?",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 they expelled her from France. And so you say, what do you do?\nWell, her sister, the sister from Munich, the wealthy people from Munich \u2014",
        "Q: Right, right.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 they were \u2014 this was \u2014 this was just \u2014 it was after Kristallnacht \u2014 after Crystal\nNight in \u00b039.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So they \u2014 they \u2014 she said, well I \u2014 if I\u2019m expelled from France, I can go see my\nsister in Paris, and she \u2014 she went to Paris, and then she came back, and then we\nchanged attorneys, and she appealed her expulsion. And she had a \u2014 now, a good\nattorney, and she was acquitted by the Court of Appeals. But you can imagine, you\ngo through this exercise, how \u2014 how \u2014 what that does take \u2014 takes out of you.",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: So anyway \u2014",
        "Q: You\u2019re insecure to begin with, yeah.",
        "A: And this is, you know \u2014 and then of course on the political scene now, in \u201938, th-\nthe Germans, the Nazis invaded Austria, and took over Austria, and in the spring of\n\u00b039, they invaded Czechoslovakia, and took over Czechoslovakia, and everybody\nfigured, you know, it\u2019s going to go on.",
        "Q: I have a question at this point. You mention that your \u2014 your aunt was in Paris.\nAnd my question was, during these years that you are in France, in Marseilles,\nwhat\u2019s going on with the rest of the family that you\u2019ve left behind? Have they\ndecided now that they\u2019re going to leave, or try to leave? Do they stay? What\nhappens?January 12, 2016",
        "A: There are members who left. But the key members, like Ed \u2014 Elsie(ph), and her\nhusband, Karl(ph) Heiman(ph) in Munich, he was \u2014 in Kristallnacht, he was\narrested and thrown into Dachau concentration camp. And his reaction was, if th \u2014 if\n\u2014 if this system can arrest Karl(ph) Heiman(ph), it\u2019s time to get out of here. And for\n\u2014 overnight, they just dropped everything and went to Switzerland. And from\nSwitzerland they came to France, to England, then the United States.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014",
        "Q: So that\u2019s your mother\u2019s older sister, and her husband.",
        "A: Yes. He \u2014 he \u2014 char \u2014 Charles, in the United States, Charles Heiman(ph)\nestablished a textile company in Cincinnati, Ohio, and I believe that his company\ntoday is the largest textile company privately owned in the United States, pertaining\nto servicing hospitals and hotels.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: You can go to any Marriot, and if you look at the label on your towels, it says\nStandard Textile Company, Cincinnati, Ohio. That\u2019s Uncle Charlie\u2019s company.\nHe\u2019s long dead, but my cousin Paul, who is my age, is retired, and his son is running\nthe company now, but that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s how.",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s how.January 12, 2016",
        "Q: That\u2019s how.",
        "A: On my father\u2019s side, my mother\u2019s brother did leave \u2014 I don\u2019t know when, but he\nleft in the late 30s, and came to the United States to go to Seattle. And it \u2014 and her\nyoungest sister, she was married to a surgeon, and they left about that time.",
        "Q: So the siblings all left.",
        "A: They \u2014 they left, yeah. And her mother \u2014 her mother went to Holland, probably\nin \u00b039 \u2014 \u00b039, yeah. And so there was nobody left in Munich.",
        "Q: Grandpa had died?",
        "A: Oh yeah, he died. He died in \u00b035, I believe.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. But that\u2019s my mother\u2019s side. On my father\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me, before we go to father \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So your grandmother is in Holland, what happens to her?",
        "A: She \u2014 she got out. You know, it all had to do with who in the United States, if\nUnited States was your goal, who in the United States would vouch for you. Of\ncourse, my grandmother never really worked. She worked in the store, but she was\nnever employed. And so \u2014 and she was older, so she wasn\u2019t going to get a job, but\nyou know, Uncle Charlie and Aunt Elsa(ph) brought her over. But she got out\nwithin \u2014 less than four weeks before the Germans invaded.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so \u2014 and so, she was in Holland for a while. Her two sisters were in\nHolland.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 for a while. They \u2014 they \u2014 they left Holland, they went to South America,\nultimately. But she came to Cincinnati to be with my aunt and uncle there. So, of\nthe immediate family, there was nobody left. There were some brothers or cousins,\nbut I don\u2019t know anything about them.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Tha-That was on my grandfather\u2019s side of the family, that he was in business\nwith. I don\u2019t know what happened to the business, whether it was sold, or \u2014 I have\nno idea. And on my father\u2019s side of the family, they didn\u2019t leave. I haven\u2019t talked\nabout them. My great-grandfather, in the mid-1800s, established a company in\nHockenheim, which was a tobacco \u2014 particularly cigars, cigar manufacturer. Must\nhave been a big deal, from everything \u2014 if you go to Hockenheim today, they\u2019|I tell\nyou about the cigar industry they used to have. But he established the thing, it was\ncalled \u2014 his name was Isaac Hockenheimer, and he established this company called\nIsaac Hockenheimer and sons. Isaac Hockenheimer und sohne. And you know\nhow primogenitor works, the oldest, his oldest, my grandfather\u2019s oldest son, Albert\n\u2014 these are the people that we stayed with for three months in Mannheim. He \u2014 he\nJanuary 12, 2016\nbecame a next generation director of the cigar company, and then one of his cousins.\nThe two of them were the heads of that, of the cigar industry in Hockenheim. They\n\u2014 they \u2014 but Albert and his wife, Alfreida(ph) did not leave. Then there was\nAlfreida\u2019s sister, who was married to a younger brother of my uncle, my father. His\nname was Louie, he was a bank president. See, they all had gotten into their own\nfields, he was a bank president. They didn\u2019t leave. The \u2014 there were quite a few of\nthem. And I say this for a purpose. Because, after France fell, in June of 1940, the \u2014\nsome guy who wanted to \u2014 guy by the name of Wagner(ph), who was in charge of\nthe \u2014 for the Nazi party in Stuttgart wanted to make Hitler believe that he was a\ngenius. He invented the situation. You may read it differently in history books, but\nhe \u2014 he told Hitler, we got to get rid of \u2014 they say we got to get rid of the Jews. And\nso they organized a deal where all the Jews of Baden \u2014 I don\u2019t know about\nWirttemberg \u2014 I mean, he wasn\u2019t in Wiirttemberg then, but Baden and Pfalz,\nwhich is Palatinate were ordered to be shipped out. They were put on trains and\nshipped not east, but to France, to the Gurs concentration camp, in the Pyrenees, in\nFrance. And so my dad \u2014 we haven\u2019t talked about that, but \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, we'll \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 my dad, who wound up at Gurs in the fall of 1940, after he was there,\ntrainloads of \u2014 of \u2014 of Jews from just about all the Jews who were still in Baden and\n\u2014 and Palatinate, were put on these trains and shipped down to Gurs, and he \u2014 so heJanuary 12, 2016\nmet his brother and sister-in-law, and the other sister-in-law, and the niece, and old\naunts, 84 years old, and the whole family wound up in this concentration camp in\nGurs which \u2014 where the conditions were not \u2014 they lived in barracks, and it was not\nvery good. We\u2019|l talk about Gurs later.",
        "Q: Yeah, we will.",
        "A: But that\u2019s what happened to them. Now \u2014",
        "Q: So does that mean all 10 siblings of your father \u2014",
        "A: No, not 10, they \u2014 you know, they, through the years they got spread out. Let\u2019s\nsee, the oldest one was Albert, so he \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 came to Gurs with his wife. The next one was Karl(ph); he had gone to the\nUnited States before World War I.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He lived in \u2014 in Hollywood, and wife and one daughter. And after that was\nLouie, the bank president. He died in \u201938 of a heart attack, but had this wife and\ndaughter who wound up in Gurs.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s number three that \u2014 then there were three sisters. Bella \u2014 Bella lived in\nStrasbourg, France. So she was \u2014 so, other circumstances. The strange thing in this\nfamily is that all three sisters married young, and were widowed young. Health si \u2014January 12, 2016\nhealth services weren\u2019t as good then as they are now, I guess. The second one, I\ndon\u2019t know when she left, Josephine. She was married \u2014 the first husband died, she\nwas married to a other gentleman by the name of Odenheimer(ph), who lived in\nBaden-Baden, and then she came to the United States. So she made it out before\nFrance fell. And then the young \u2014 younger one, the sister was Amalia(ph), and\nshe\u2019s the one who married the gentleman in Switzerland, that we went to stay with.\nSo she was in Switzerland, so she was safe. In those days, th-the girls, the sisters,\nhad absolutely nothing to say about what they did. It was the Albert \u2014 Albert in s \u2014\nin lieu of parents that didn\u2019t live, and probably Louie the bank president, because he\nhad prestige, decided what the sisters would do, who they would marry, or not\nmarry, and it was all organized. It\u2019s a different society. The \u2014 so that was\nAmalia(ph), and then my dad was next. So that\u2019s where they were. I saw \u2014 just a\nlittle side story \u2014 I saw Amalia(ph), I used to, when I was stationed in Germany, I\nwent to visit her, after her husband \u2014 second husband died, and then she wound up in\na Jewish old age home in the town of Baden, which is near Zurich. And, you know,\nshe had this nice room, and so on. Nice place. It\u2019s a Jewish old age home. And I \u2014\nevery time I went there, scared me to death, because she had a bed that was about\nthis high. She was \u2014",

        "A: Yeah.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Oh yeah.",
        "A: And I used to watch her get \u2014 get out of bed. I would sit there, and walk around\nand it scared me to death that she was going to fall, break her hip or something. And\nI said to her \u2014 and we called her Mala(ph) \u2014 Aunt Mala(ph), I\u2019d like to put a carpet\nin here. And she said, darf man das? She said, is that permitted? You know, in the\nworld I come from, anything is permitted as long as you \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 do it the proper way. And I said, yeah, das darf man. I said, I'll go see the\ndirector.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: And just the mentality, the director, I went to the director, he was very nice. And\nI said I\u2014 I\u2019m scared to death my aunt\u2019s going to fall, she\u2019s going to break her hip.\nAnd the \u2014 and the \u2014 I\u2019d like to have a carpet installed, wall to wall carpet. And he\nlooked at me \u2014 you never know what people are gonna do \u2014 and he looked at me,\nand he said, but 1-1f or when your aunt dies, the carpet must remain here. And I sa \u2014\nand I s \u2014 and I said to myself, you know, okay, I said, of course, Ill be happy to\nleave it here. I mean, I\u2019m going to come from Germany, and take out the carpet? A\nwall to wall carpet? I mean \u2014 but that\u2019s the \u2014 the mentality. Darf man das. And\neverything in her life, from the fact that the brothers decided everything for the girls,\nin lieu of the parents, is always, is 1t permitted, you know? And that it\u2019s just a \u2014 you\nhave to understand that, you know, why people did the things that they \u2014 they did,\nand th \u2014 and the people always ask the question, why didn\u2019t the Jews revolt against\nHitler? And you know, it\u2019s because that was the authority, and you did what the\nauthority told you.",
        "Q: Well, let me turn that around in a pro \u2014 more provocative way. If that is the \u2014 if\nthat\u2019s the mentality, then can one blame the German people so much that they\nfollowed Hitler, because darf man das. It\u2019s what\u2019s \u2014 you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s sort of\nlike \u2014 do you understand what I\u2019m trying to say?",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2014I\u2014Iam sure. Well, I don\u2019t know whether it has to do with blame,\nbecause people \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the thing to me is that people should have had a\nJanuary 12, 2016\nconscience. And your conscience, that mean they \u2014 they raise you, saying what\u2019s\nright and what\u2019s wrong.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And when you get to a certain point, and certain things are done. Now, Hitler \u2014\nHitler, one of the big things he used was the Versailles Treaty, and that \u2014 that\nGermany is only doing so badly because everything was taken away from us, and\nhe \u2014 he provoked nationalism, more nationalism, nationalism. We are the poor \u2014 y-\nyou know. I mean, think about this, he said the \u2014 that, you know, we \u2014 we need more\nlebensraum, we need more living space for the country. Well, but \u2014 but after the\nwar, the Bundesrepublik Deutschland, without East Germany, became the most\npowerful economic thing in the world, with the space that they had. So, you know,\nthat \u2014 this stuff is all just to suit his \u2014 his purposes. He wanted \u2014",
        "Q: Well, he was stoking resentment.",
        "A: Yeah, exactly.",
        "Q: He was stoking resentment \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right. He wanted to get the people to \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and tell\nthem that we\u2019re the thousand year Reich, and we\u2019re going to dominate history. And\nso that\u2019s he \u2014 he \u2014 that\u2019s how he sold the thing.",
        "Q: Okay.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: I mean, there were good people in Germany. They\u2019re good \u2014 you know, it\u2019s just\nlike we talk about France. Some \u2014 some of the police guys were bad, some of the\nneighbors were questionable, but there were an awful lot of good people. I mean, I\ncould tell you the story that, when we lived in Marseilles, the \u2014 the guy that owned\nour apartment, I don\u2019t know how many months he didn\u2019t get paid rent. He never said\n\u2014 never said a word. He knew who we were, and that \u2014 what the circumstances were.\nAnd I suspect we'll get to how we got out of France later.",
        "Q: Oh, a-absolutely.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: Pll tell you a story about one of our neighbors which is moving to the end, I\nmean, it\u2019s just \u2014 so, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 there are good people everywhere.",
        "Q: I know. It is \u2014 simply is \u2014 isn\u2019t it a\u2014I guess the \u2014 one of the things that one\nshould never do is ask a leading question. And here I am, and I\u2019m going to ask a\nleading question, and that \u2014 and it\u2019s just to go on this theme a little more. Isn\u2019t it\nmore \u2014 isn\u2019t it easier to sell this bill of goods that you described, to a populous that is\nraised not just to know what is right from wrong, but to ask for permission at every\nstep of the way, of may I do this, may I not do this? And who are the authorities?\nVersus a population that believes in \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9, and \u2014 and libert\u00e9? You\nknow, a population that is also guaranteed, as in the United States, a constitution of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016\nfreedom of expression, and freedom after expression, you know? Freedom of\nSpeech, in other words. I \u2014 it\u2019s just \u2014",
        "A: So your question is, is it easier to do it the way the Germans did it?",
        "Q: No. Is it easier to do it to a population which has a value in it that you have to ask\npermission for everything that you do in your life? In other words, that you accept\nauthority easier, than in countries where authority is \u2014 it\u2019s okay to question it.",
        "A: Well, the Germans \u2014 I\u2019m trying to figure out how to answer that. The Germans\nare by custom \u2014 not probably so much today, but were then, a people who only\noperated by authority. I \u2014 I like to say in 1945, when I was in Paris, and this is the\ndifference between I \u2014 you know, the French have poli \u2014 political cabarets, and you\ncan hear stuff that you don\u2019t hear anywhere else. But my saying then was, the\ndifference between a Frenchman and a German is that a German is on a Metro in\nParis, and he has trouble coughing. He needs to cough and to expectorate, and the\nsign says, in the subway, d\u00e9fense de cracher. Spitting prohibited. And so the\nGerman will stand there and go \u2014 and practically strangle. The Frenchman will come\nalong, and he says \u2014 and he looks at the sign that says, d\u00e9fense de cracher, spitting\nprohibited, and he\u2019! spit at the sign.",
        "Q: [laughter] You answered my question.",
        "A: So, you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 people are different. The French, even the French are\ndifferent from themselves.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Of course, of course.",
        "A: Like Americans are different from themselves. The northern French are very\ncold, the southern French are very, ah, laissez aller, let \u2014 you know, manana.",
        "Q: Live and let live, huh?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s an interesting example. Can we cut for just a second? [break] So you \u2014\nyou\u2019ve kind of described to me that many of your father\u2019s relatives who were still in\nGermany, got to Gurs \u2014 were transported to Gurs \u2014 deported to Gurs. Can you tell\nme what their fates were? Did all of them make it out of Gurs, or did some of them\nnot?",
        "A: Both. No, that can\u2019t be both. Some of them made, and some didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And some died there. My father\u2019s oldest brother, Albert, and his wife\nAlfreida(ph) \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 made it out. Their son lived in Los Angeles, and he was able \u2014 I don\u2019t know the\ndetails, but he was able to get them out, after we were gone. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t\nknow the details. His \u2014 as I told you, Albert\u2019s wife Alfreida(ph) sister was married\nto his brother Louie. They were two sisters married to two brothers. Louie had died\nin 38, in\u2014 1n Germany.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Heart attack, I think you said.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s what the records say. I had heard that he \u2014 the Gestapo came to arrest\nhim, and he had a heart attack. So, whether it was this way, or that way, but he was a\nvery formal man, what I knew of him. He would not open a door without having\ngloves on. Kid gloves, you know, suede gloves.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Door handles had germs on them. He died in \u00b038, and his widow, Clara, and her\ndaughter Annie(ph), who\u2019s my first cousin, were shipped to Gurs, together with a\ngroup. Then there were a couple of old aunts, couple of whom died in Gurs. The\nconditions in Gurs were not like in Auschwitz or \u2014 or Dachau, but they \u2014 they were\nnot good. You were, quite basically, exposed to the elements, living in these \u2014 in \u2014 in\n\u2014 in barracks. She was still there. She was there throughout \u201942.",
        "Q: Annie(ph), or \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014",
        "A: Both the mother and daughter, Clara and Annie(ph) were there. There\u2019s quite an\nexchange, some of which I owe to this gentleman here, of correspondence that he got\nfrom the Quakers, and we\u2019ll get to that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But where the \u2014 where she, in \u201942, was asking for money, because she had no\nmoney, and \u2014 and so on. So, I believe \u2014 I\u2019ve got the date, I believe it was August of\n42, that we got a postcard from her, Clara. We\u2019re being loaded on a train, we do\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016\nnot know where to. And that\u2019s the last we ever heard of her. Both she and \u2014 and\nAnnie(ph) got gassed in Auschwitz, and \u2014 [sound of plane] Unfortunately, we\u2019re on\nthe pattern for Love Field.",
        "Q: Okay. So they were shipped to Auschwitz.",
        "A: So they \u2014 they were shipped to au-aus-aus \u2014 Auschwitz. I have in the documents,\nwhich I have for Ron, one of my cousins sent a letter in \u201945, sent a letter to Gurs,\nwhen it was \u2014 there was still an administration there, and asked what happened to\nthem, and I have the letter from them that says what train they were shipped off on.\nDidn\u2019t say to Auschwitz, but \u2014",
        "Q: And just for the camera, for clarification, you\u2019re talking about correspondence\nthat you got from my colleague, Ron Coleman, at the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum, to augment what you already knew\u2019?",
        "A: No, that correspondence I got from the family archives.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That particular one. But the \u2014 th-they have \u2014 th-they have the layout \u2014 you have\nthe layout at the Holocaust Museum, which even gives the dates, and so on.",
        "Q: Right. So that \u2014 those relatives didn\u2019t make it.",
        "A: They did \u2014 they didn\u2019t make it. Then some died there. There was an Aunt\nSophie(ph) that was in her 80s when she \u2014 she\u2019s buried there. Caroline and I went\nto Gurs about 10 years ago, and there\u2019s not much left of it, but the cemetery is there.January 12, 2016\nThe people five miles from there, they don\u2019t know what Gurs was, which is always\npathetic. But there is a monument there with a train car, to remember. And the\ncemetery is there. Which is a point of interest. The city of Karlsruhe sends students\nto Gurs every summer, to take care of the cemetery, which should be noted as a\nstatement of \u2014",
        "Q: Not forgetting.",
        "A: \u2014 solidarity, or whatever.",
        "Q: Or not forgetting.",
        "A: Or not forgetting.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. They didn\u2019t have to do it, but they\u2019re doing it. Karlsruhe is very, very pro\nremembering the past, and all the bad things that were done. They\u2019re very nice.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s turn back now to your family, and your immediate family in Marseilles,\nand your father is released, and your mother is tried and found guilty, and then gets\nanother lawyer, and is acquitted. This must have taken a psychological toll on\neverybody.",
        "A: Yes. The kids \u2014 also on the kids, but kids tend to be engaged in the daily activities\nand so on. It obviously was very hard, but as they say in German, if we\u2019re adults, es\nbleibt in ihren knochen. It remains in their bones.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: The kids, if something had happened, it\u2019s not quite the same.",
        "Q: More resilient, in some ways.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, and they don\u2019t have any responsibility, you know, whereas the adults\nhave responsibility for everybody.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He \u2014 he was released, Mother was \u2014 so that was, obviously in \u2014 in \u201938 sometimes,\nI can\u2019t tell you when.",
        "Q: What happened after that? How did life progress?",
        "A: Okay, so parallel to all this, the \u2014 the Germans, Nazis, occupied \u2014 took over\nAustria. Then in the beginning of \u201939, Czechoslovakia. And on the first of\nSeptember, \u201939 \u2014 I\u2019m laughing for a purpose, but they invaded Poland. After they\nhad had non-aggression pacts with the Soviets, and whatever. On the third of\nSeptember, France and England declared war on Germany, and that was the\nbeginning of World War II. Immediately when the war started, my dad, as now an\nenemy alien, was arrest \u2014 arrested. Interned, is maybe a better word. Sent to les\nMilles, which was a camp near Marseilles, in Aix-en-Provence, which is near\nMarseilles. And they collected all the people they didn\u2019t know where they fit in, and\nwhat did \u2014 who had a background from \u2014 at \u2014 now, at this point, this was a French\naction, nothing to do with the Germans.",
        "Q: So he\u2019s a German, and Germans are now our enemies, and so therefore.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so this cu \u2014 camp in Les Milles \u2014 you know how to spell it, I\u2019m sure.",
        "Q: M-i-I-l-e?",
        "A: No, M-i-I-l-e-s.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Les in front of it, l-e-s. It was a brick factory that they converted into a \u2014 I guess\nthey ran out of what to do \u2014 they didn\u2019t have any more bricks to make, so they used\nit for this, and they made it internment camp. And this was the craziest assembly of\npeople that you ever heard in your life, because there were a lot of people who had\nleft Germany, prominent people who had left Germany, who lived in France, and\nthey\u2019re the ones who wound up in Les Milles. That included Mare Chagall; that\nincluded Lion Feuchtwanger, the famous author; that included Nobel prize\nphysicist Meyerhof, and I could go on.",
        "Q: Enemy aliens, in other words.",
        "A: They were enemy aliens.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So they \u2014 they had this very strange \u2014 I read yesterday somewhere, that one of\nthem was a famous surgeon from Vienna, he came with his two \u2014 he had two\nattendants, two \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Assistants?",
        "A: \u2014 people that did things for him, you know? Household \u2014 he brought them along,\nyou know? They weren\u2019t Jewish or anything, they were just \u2014 were his \u2014 his\nemployees. So they \u2014 they had them all there, and they didn\u2019t know what to do with\nthem. It was not super-dangerous, there were all kinds of outside contacts, but it was\n\u2014 but there was a fence around, and \u2014 and the conditions were not very good.\nHygiene, food, stuff like that. And my dad \u2014 that was in \u2014 in September, after the\nwar started. By December of \u2014 of \u201939, he got out of there. He had friends in\nMarseilles, which was nearby, that vouched for him, that he was a good guy, and so\nthey let him out. Some others never got out, but they let him out. And so, he was\nhome in Marseilles with us, until May of 40.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: In May of \u201940, the Germans, as you know, invaded Holland, Belgium,\nLuxembourg, came into northern France and in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 1n two weeks, reached\nParis, and took Paris. And the French army was nowhere to be seen. I don\u2019t know\nwhether that\u2019s true, but that\u2019s what it seemed like, because nobody stopped them.\nCharles de Gaulle would have said, well, the Germans had tanks, and we didn\u2019t.\nAnd that was true. And so they just kept going. So then the question came for us \u2014 I\nmean, the people from Paris, and so on, north, extreme south on the highways of\nFrance, and we were in Marseilles, and so then the authorities in Marseilles\nJanuary 12, 2016\ndecided hey, what\u2019s going to happen. And so they \u2014 as one of the first things they\ndid, is they took these people like my dad, and they put them back in Les Milles. So\nsome were, probably at the end of May, I don\u2019t have the exact date, my dad was\nback in Les Milles, where they had left \u2014 you know, ha \u2014 they had let them go.",
        "Q: But there\u2019s something \u2014 there\u2019s something that\u2019s really surreal about this, because\nthe point of being in Les Milles is if you were an enemy, and that means if you\u2019re a\nGerman who would support Germany, and the people that you mentioned, were not\nthose types of people.",
        "A: Yeah, but the French couldn\u2019t tell the difference, and there were people in Les\nMilles who were not Jewish, quite a few.",
        "Q: And were there some who actually were?",
        "A: There were oc \u2014 an occasional Nazi in there, too.",
        "Q: Yeah, that\u2019s one wa \u2014",
        "A: Not by design, but by happenstance, because there were some Nazis who were\nliving in France, just like everybody else.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so they picked up everybody that was German, Austrian, Czech, and they \u2014\nif they didn\u2019t know \u2014 you know. By this time, there were thousands of refugees in\nMarseilles, because everybody from up north came down. There were hotels that \u2014\nthe French police had police raids every day in downtown Marseilles, to find people\nJanuary 12, 2016\nwho were here illegally. And so there \u2014 the stories are endless. But they were back in\nLes Milles, and the Germans ca \u2014 were coming south. And so, there wasn\u2019t much\ntime between the 20\" of May, you know, and so \u2014 so, about \u2014 and there, it\u2019s a little\nvague, the date is not quite sure. Let\u2019s \u2014 the book on Les Milles says about the 20\"\nof May, I \u2014 of June \u2014 I don\u2019t believe it, it\u2019s \u2014 had to be a few days earlier, it just\ndoesn\u2019t fit \u2014 they took \u2014 not everybody, but they took all the volunteers in Les\nMilles who felt threatened by the Nazis, and is \u2014 and the \u2014 the comman \u2014\ncommandant of Les Milles, who had some good sides to him. He was a reserve\nofficer, that the army wasn\u2019t his thing, and he was running this camp, and he also\nhad a\u2014a conscience, and so he decided to use his personal influence, and he \u2014 he\ncalled up somebody he knew, and he \u2014 I just read that in a book, I didn\u2019t know how\nthat worked. He called him up, and says, I w \u2014 I need a train. And so they produced a\ntrain for him, and said, anybody who wants \u2014 who \u2014 who feels threatened, we\u2019ll take\nyou away so the Germans can\u2019t get at you. So they loaded all these guys \u2014",
        "Q: The Nobel prize winners, the \u2014",
        "A: Everybody. Lion Feuchtwanger, and Hans(ph) Klay(ph), the famous artist, and\nI mean, there were dozens of them. They loaded them on this train, unless they\nrefused. Didn\u2019t have to go on the train. But the train was the purpose of escaping the\nGermans. And they \u2014 they put them on this train, and they headed west, towards the\nPyrenees, and basically towards the Atlantic. Bordeaux, Bayonne \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Was your father on this train?",
        "A: My father was on this train, and I don\u2019t know, you know, he \u2014 you could visualize\nthat he could have said to himself, oh, but my family is in Marseilles, why do I want\nto be on this train? Because they said it \u2014 they said they were going to take him to\nNorth Africa, where they would be safe. I don\u2019t know when they said that, but they\nsaid that somewhere along the line. And so the train took off, and the captain \u2014 I\nmean, the commandant of the ca \u2014 of Les Milles, kept track of the train, to be sure \u2014\nyeah, then he called \u2014 they he called \u2014 like, this is new information for me, but he\ncalled a cousin of his, who owned the boat \u2014 the ship, in Bayonne, on the Atlantic\ncoast, and he said hey, I need you. I \u2014 you gotta be in Bayonne, | have got a\nthousand \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the number exactly was \u2014 of \u2014 of refugees here, I got\nto get to North Africa. Well, how much are you gonna pay me? Well, 500 francs, or\nwhatever it was, a head. Okay. So, they put him on a train, and the train took off.\nAnd he kept track of it, because the guy in Bayonne said, my ship will only be here\nuntil such and such a date. They gotta get here. So he kept working over the railroad\nofficial, so the train would keep moving, while the Germans were coming south.\nAnd so my guess is, on the 19\", I\u2014 you know, I\u2019m a little vague on that, but on the\n19\" of June, we got phone call. We \u2014 my mother got a phone call from the Fr-French\npolice, and they said, oh you gotta evacuate. Be \u2014 be at the train station at six o\u2019clock\nin the morning.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: So this is separate, your father\u2019s on one train, and you get this for another. Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 and be at \u2014 at Gare Saint Charles, Saint Charles train station at six\no\u2019clock in the morning, we\u2019re gon \u2014 we\u2019re going to take you away, take you out of\ndanger. So, okay, so we pack our bags, and you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re ever going to\ncome back, so we took clothing and food, cause you don\u2019t know whether there is any\nfood. Well, then it happened that that night \u2014 and you can \u2014 we could figure out what\nthe date was, because that night in southern France was the heaviest thunderstorm I\nhave ever lived through anywhere. I mean, you thought the world was coming to an\nend. And we thought at the time it was caused by the artillery, that the artillery fire\nin northern France had caused so much disruption of the \u2014 of the atmosphere, that it\nscrewed up the weather. And anyway, it poured, and thundered, and lightning, I\nmean \u2014 and there was no means of transportation. You couldn\u2019t get a c-cab or\nanything. Nothing moved.",
        "Q: So you have this mandatory order that you have to be at this \u2014",
        "A: At the train station.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so, we first \u2014 first we headed out, carrying suitcases, on foot. My house,\nwithout suitcases, was probably 45 minutes to an hour, by foot, to the train station.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: And so we walked a little bit in this thunderstorm. We decided that wa \u2014 we \u2014 we\nhad to let the storm go by, there was no way we could keep going.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so we went back home. And then I went next door to my friend George(ph)\nGarrute(ph), the Catholic kid who went to mass at five o\u2019clock in the morning, that\nI told you about. He was a couple of years older than I was. And I said, George(ph),\nI need you. He says, sure. I said, you gotta help me carry suitcases. Okay. So my\nmother and my sister went ahead, be sure to make \u2014 to be there on time when this\nwas supposed to happen, and \u2014 and George and I carried the suitcases. And we had\nto stop every 20 feet, because we \u2014",
        "Q: Weren\u2019t you soaking wet?",
        "A: Well, that \u2014 the storm wasn\u2019t that bad any more. That was the first installment.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: By this time it wasn\u2019t pouring any more.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so we \u2014 we \u2014 somewhere we decided that we had too many suitcases, we\ntook a couple back to the house, and went with the rest of them. And we carried\nthem to the train station. It took us more than an hour to get to the train station.\nCouple hours, I\u2019m sure. We finally got \u2014 at dawn, we got to the front of the train\nstation, and then we were told, oh, you got to go to the back of the train station. We\nJanuary 12, 2016\nhad a pretty big train station. So, there was a cab there. So I took the cab, and I said,\nokay, my mother has money, Ill \u2014 we\u2019ll pay for the cab when we get there. And so\nwe put everything in the cab, and we went around to the back. When we got there,\nmy mother was hysterical, because I hadn\u2019t shown up, and she didn\u2019t want to leave\nwith me \u2014 without me. And so she finally saw me, and she \u2014 she just \u2014 I can tell you\nthat the train left about 15 minutes after I got to the back of the \u2014 of the train station.\nAnd wi \u2014 it was one of these \u2014 many miracles I\u2019ve experienced in my life, this one of\nthem. And so the train left. And the train went \u2014 there were all women and children,\nthere were no men on this. And this, you \u2014 you know, I have to say, you were a man\nif you were over 18. Well, I wasn\u2019t, I was 14. So I was a child. And we \u2014 the train\nwent, and there was a \u2014 it was a passenger train, with compartments. We were in a\ncompartment, the three of us, with two ladies that we knew well, a mother and \u2014\nmother and daughter, who was about my mother\u2019s age.",
        "Q: Were these also German Jews?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. Whose \u2014 the younger one, her name \u2014 they were, Mrs. Jacob(ph) \u2014 the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the mother, the old mother, she was probably in her 70s, her name was\nDevries(ph), d-e-v-r-i-e-s. The elder frau Devries(ph). Because her son\u2019s name was\nDevries, and Millie Jacobs(ph) maiden name was Devries, and so we had the old\nJanuary 12, 2016\nMrs. Devries, and Mrs. Jacob(ph), and my mother and my sister and I in this\ncompartment. And \u2014 and we went and stopped, and went and stopped, and this \u2014 you\nknow, you \u2014 the Germans were coming south. Nothing worked. I mean, it was a\nmiracle \u2014",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t know where \u2014 did you know where you were going? Was there\nany idea \u2014",
        "A: No, the only thing we knew, we were going west.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And the \u2014 we went to \u2014 wound up in Toulouse, and then after Toulouse,\nwhatever the next \u2014 Niemes. And \u2014 and \u2014 and then we wound up, and we \u2014 we\nstopped in Lourdes. And Lourdes is well-known internationally, because of the\nCatholic shrine there. And so we are parked in \u2014 on the tracks. And by this time, it\u2019s\napproximately the 20 \u2014 either the 21\u00b0, or 22\u2122 of June. And we\u2019re sitting there for a\nwhile. We had gendarmes on board who were supposedly watching us, or taking\ncare of us, or whatever they \u2014",
        "Q: Could you leave the train at all? Could you go on the platform, as you were \u2014",
        "A: In principle not, but if I\u2019d gone on the platform, nobody would have said\nanything.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But we had no \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Okay. No reason.",
        "A: \u2014 reason, because you didn\u2019t know whether the train was going to leave in the\nnext minute.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know anything. Neither did the gendarmes. And so we were there \u2014 I\nknow we were there four or five hours. And \u2014 and there was a \u2014 let\u2019s see, we were\non this track here, and there\u2019s a track here, and the platform between us. And the \u2014\nthere\u2019s a train parked here, that\u2019s a freight train. And Pll \u2014 I\u2019ll swear to my dying\nday, it was a freight train, it was not a passenger train. And after a few hours, there\u2019s\na woman on our train, who looked at the freight train, and saw her husband. And this\ntrain, the pas \u2014 freight train, is what in history has gos \u2014 gone down as the phantom\ntrain. Th-There are books written about the phantom train, I got a movie, and a \u2014 and\na \u2014 books about it, what the phantom train was all about. And that was the phantom\ntrain. And after this woman discovered her husband, we all looked out, and got out,\nand my dad was on that train.",
        "Q: So that was the train that was from Gurs \u2014 no, from Milles \u2014",
        "A: From Les Milles.",
        "Q: \u2014 from Milles, from Les Milles.",
        "A: That was the train from Les Milles.",

        "A: And the funny thing is, Carol and I watched th-the movie about it a week ago. I\nhave a friend in California, just sent it to us. I didn\u2019t know there was a movie about\nit. And we just looked at it, and they\u2019 ve got a passenger train here. And it was not a\npassenger train. And I charged Ron with, somebody\u2019s gotta know why they \u2014 they\nsay \u2014 you know, I thought that when it got to its end that they \u2014 the people got off,\nand then the ship wasn\u2019t there, and then they put them on a different train. But I have\nno \u2014 nothing in writ \u2014 written record I have found that \u2014 that says that.",
        "Q: So did your father see you?",
        "A: Yeah, we \u2014 we \u2014",
        "Q: Did you see \u2014 did you \u2014 did he get off of his phantom train, or not?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you met on the platform?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you join each other then?",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 well \u2014",
        "Q: I mean, could he leave \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we talked to each other. We talked to each other for a few hours.",
        "Q: So was he \u2014 did he \u2014",
        "A: Not only him, but everybody else who had their wives and kids on the \u2014 on this\ntrain.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: So, did you then join each other afterwards, or did you each go back to your\nseparate trains?",
        "A: They made us go back on our separate train, and they \u2014 and they said e \u2014 well,\nwhat you have to understand is about this time, 22\" of June, 19 \u2014",
        "Q: Forty.",
        "A: \u2014 40, the word came out that France had signed an armistice, and the war was\nover.",
        "Q: For them.",
        "A: That the war between Germany and France was over. Now, what that meant,\nnobody could tell, at that point. And so, they \u2014 they \u2014 I doubt that they had orders,\nthe guys in charge of these trains. It just what you do when you have to make a\ndecision. So the gendarmes made us go back on our train, and they \u2014 the \u2014 the\nguards, th-the soldiers on the other train made them get back on their train, a-and\nsaid, and I quote, \u201cWell, don\u2019t worry. The war is over. You'll \u2014 your husbands will\nsoon be home.\u201d And they \u2014 and so that train left, and we left. We went back to\nMarseilles. We went back home. So we were only gone a week, I \u2014 give or take, I\ndon\u2019t know exactly, but so \u2014 and so, we went home. And this train didn\u2019t go home.\nThey went to \u2014 they stopped them in \u2014 in Nimes, which is a city on the way, and\nthey unloaded them, and they established a camp called Saint Nicolas, Saint\nNicolas, and they put them in there. Well, that was a very poorly prepared camp, andJanuary 12, 2016\nso he was in Saint Nicolas, this was June, end of June. He was, I think, in Saint\nNicolas July and August. And then somewhere in there, I would say August, maybe\nthe first of September, they decided to move the people from Saint Nicolas to Gurs.",
        "Q: Oh, is that how he ended up in Gurs?",
        "A: That\u2019s how he ended up in Gurs. Now to the history of Gurs is that Gurs was\nestablished in 1936, to bring in the refugees from the Spanish civil war. And so the \u2014\nthere probably were still some refugees of the Spanish civil war in Gurs when the\nGermans arrived. And \u2014 and my father and his cohorts \u2014",
        "Q: The other enemy aliens, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, the enemy aliens.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And so, that\u2019s how he wound up at Gurs.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 and then, that was in sep \u2014 let\u2019s say September, and on the \u2014 I believe it\nwas the second \u2014 22\u2122 of October that the Gauleiter of \u2014 of Wiirttemberg and\nBaden and whatever, decided to send all the Jews from Germany down there.

I mean, how were able to make money, how\nwere you able to make a li \u2014 how were they able to make a living?",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s not a question that my sister and I can answer. We don\u2019t know,\nbecause we were children, and we were protected. I know that my parents sold\nfurniture and items from their \u2014 the household at auctions, when they ran out of\nmoney. That much I know. Where the money came from to feed us, I have no idea. I\nknow we didn\u2019t get any money from relatives anywhere else. As a matter of fact, if\nanything, we gave money to people, members of the family who were in\nconcentration camps. You know, my dad did an occasional business deal. My\nmother, when the war started, knitted genouill\u00e9re.",
        "Q: What\u2019s that?",
        "A: That\u2019s a thing that \u2014 knitted woolen things that soldiers wear on the \u2014 on \u2014 genou\nis the knee \u2014 wear on their legs to keep them warm in the front lines. She worked for\nthe war effort. But you don\u2019t make any money at that, you know. Somehow, to her\ngreat credit, she \u2014 somehow she scraped by. We \u2014 we don\u2019t know how. We \u2014 there\u2019s\nno way we can figure it out. We know that our landlord didn\u2019t push us if we couldn\u2019t\npay the rent. But we ate, and \u2014 and then this period when my dad was there, before \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016\nbetween Les Milles and Les Milles, you know, he came home one day and said, oh,\nyou know, there was \u2014 there was no food in France. I mean, forget about us, there\nwas no food. The only thing they sold in the \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the grocery store were\nrutabagas. If you present me with a rutabaga, Ill kick you out of the house.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve \u2014 you\u2019ve had your fill?",
        "A: That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s all there was.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And the \u2014 so that \u2014 I don\u2019t know how we \u2014 how we lived. On the other hand, my\nfriends, my French friends, never quit being my French friends. And my sister\u2019s\nFrench friends, she was \u2014 she has French friends from her school that she \u2014 that she\ncalls on the telephone once a month to this day.",
        "Q: To this day, wow.",
        "A: And they\u2019re all \u2014 my sister is now 91, going on 92, and they\u2019ve always been our\nfriends. We grew up with them. They \u2014 they never said to us, you are a dirty\nGerman, or something. They were our friends. And I\u2019Il tell you that in a minute, how\n\u2014 to what \u2014 how that works. But anyway, he was in Gurs, and we were here. Now,\nSeptember 19 \u2014 this is important, because without this, I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here. In\nSeptember of 1940, school started. And you know, so I go to school, and she goes to\nschool. That\u2019s the plan. And so I got to school, and they called me into the deputy\ndirector of the school, with my mother, and they said, oh, you can\u2019t come back. And\nJanuary 12, 2016\nmy mother said \u2014 you know, I was probably afraid of the guy \u2014 my mother said, why\nnot? Well, we \u2014 you\u2019re German. Your son is a German, and Germany has beaten\nFrance, has defeated France, and the other kids, who will know that you are\nGerman, will \u2014 will \u2014 will \u2014 will beat you up.",
        "Q: He just didn\u2019t want you there?",
        "A: Maybe he believed it, I don\u2019t know. And I said, I know, I said to him, nobody is\ngoing to beat me up. All my classmates are my friends. That \u2014 just the way it was.\nWe been together for four or five years, and you know, I knew every one of them.\nThey\u2019re all dead now, but I \u2014 if I walked down the street, they would embrace me.\nAnd \u2014 but he wouldn\u2019t relent. Okay. So now, my sister\u2019s going to school, and that\u2019s\nwhy I say \u2014",
        "Q: And she doesn\u2019t have the problem?",
        "A: Oh no, there were \u2014 my sister never has any problems. It\u2019s always me, because\nI\u2019m a boy. Girls get treated \u2014 Caroline doesn\u2019t believe it, but I can guarantee you\nthat boys got treated differently from girls. And so Mother takes the position, well,\nhe\u2019s 14 years old, Dad is in a camp, 14 year olds tend to get in trouble. Now, my\nmother didn\u2019t know my very well, because that was not something I knew how to\ndo. That wasn\u2019t part of my scenario. But anyway, so she \u2014 Mother had an\nunbelievable social conscience, and did \u2014 you know, what this woman did is way\nbeyond anything you can ever think of. And so she \u2014 she decided, first of all, she \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016\nwe now knew that Dad was in \u2014 in \u2014 in the camp \u2014 yeah, he was probably already at\nGurs. It was September.",
        "Q: Is \u2014 is \u2014 geographically, is Gurs far from Marseilles?",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Yeah. Now, it\u2019s \u2014",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay. So, correspondence only. Letters only.",
        "A: Correspondence only. And so, but Mother tried to see how to get him out. You\nalways \u2014 there was always a possibility you could get somebody out. You could get\nhim out, if you could get him a visa to the United States. And so she was doing the\ntour of the relief agencies, of which everything had come to Marseilles. Marseilles\nwas the center, the fulcrum of \u2014 of everything now, because all the refugees all \u2014\neverything had come down to this place. And so all of the relief agencies, the \u2014 the\nQuakers, the \u2014 the OSE, Office de Secours Enfants, the \u2014 the \u2014 they took care ofJanuary 12, 2016\nkids, and the American Mennonite committee, the Unitarian committee, they were \u2014\nand then some non-American outfits, but they were all in Marseilles.",

They worked with the Germans, they\nloved the Germans. So anyway \u2014 so Mother went, and took me along, to go to the\nrelief agencies, to see how \u2014 what to do about Dad. And we had an application. I\ndon\u2019t know when it went in, but we had an application for visas in the unite \u2014 to the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016\nUnited States, and you have to supply affidavits from relatives, that you don\u2019t\nbecome a burden to the U.S. government, etcetera, etcetera.",
        "Q: So at some point, the conversation had changed. You mentioned earlier than\nwhen your parents moved to Marseilles, it was with the idea that that\u2019s not so far,\nwe could go back at some point.",
        "A: Yeah, well \u2014",
        "Q: And at some point, that changed.",
        "A: Yeah, because the Germans went to war.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The minute the Germans declared war on \u2014 on \u2014 on the rest of Europe, to take\nover the world, that was pass\u00e9, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 that wasn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t exist any more. The first place we went to, were the\nAmerican Quakers, the Americans\u2019 Friends\u2019 Service Committee. They had an office\non Boulevard d\u2019Ath\u00e9nes, 29. The train station, Gare Saint Charles that I told you\nabout, was sitting on top of the hill, and it \u2014 you could come straight down from\nthere. The \u2014 some steps, and then there was Boulevard d\u2019Ath\u00e9nes, Boulevard of\nAthens. And number 20 \u2014 on the \u2014 on the right hand side there was first the Hotel\nSplendide, and then this building 29, where the Quakers took over the floor. And so\nJanuary 12, 2016\nwe went to 29 Boulevard d\u2019Ath\u00e9nes, on the second floor, and there was a\nreceptionist, and \u2014",
        "Q: Did you speak English?",
        "A: Well, ah, you caught me. I \u2014 the last two years in school, in lyc\u00e9e, I had taken\nEnglish, and I had the first marks in English, both years. And well, it was easier for\nme, because I knew German, and you know, once you go languages, you \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But, so I knew some English. I know \u2014 knew more English than kids who go to\nAmerican high school and take two years of anything. My English was better than\nthat. It wasn\u2019t good, far from it. So we got there, and th \u2014 rang the doorbell, and this\nlady, whose name I have to look up, because I knew it so well, opened the door, and\nshe was the receptionist sitting in the lobby there. And we told her what we wanted,\nand we got to speak to a representative, and tell him the story, etcetera, etcetera, and\nwe went away. Mother observed that this was a total f\u2014 fallacy, this whole thing.\nThat here you have have only the clients, only spoke no French, they all spoke\nGerman \u2014 most of them. Some of them spoke some eastern European languages, but\nmostly German.",
        "Q: German.",
        "A: And the receptionist doesn\u2019t speak anything except French.",
        "Q: Was she American?\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: No, no, she was French.",
        "Q: She was French.",
        "A: Was a local hire.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so Mother thought this over, not very long, and sh \u2014 we went back, and\nMother offered my services as an interpreter. Volunteer.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I had nothing to do. She wanted to \u2014 the whole purpose was to get me to do\nsomething, because \u2014",
        "Q: To keep you off the streets.",
        "A: Keep me off the streets, exactly.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they accepted me.",
        "Q: As a volunteer because you spoke languages?",
        "A: Yeah. I could speak German. Anybody that walked in the door, that came for\nhelp, I could ask them in German, what do you want? And I spoke French, I could\ntell the lady there, that\u2019s what they want. And I spoke some English, so I could\ninterrelate with the Quakers, who were very nice people.January 12, 2016",
        "Q: All right, let\u2019s pause here just for a second, to get a sense of the lay of the land.\nCan you describe the building for me, what it looked like? You said it was on the\nsecond floor.",
        "A: Yeah, was a big, old, well-built \u2014",
        "Q: Stone?",
        "A: \u2014 stone apartment house, basically.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But they had offices. Maybe \u2014 I don\u2019t know how long they had offices, they \u2014\nmaybe they had always offices down below, but it was really an apartment house.\nAnd the reason I mention that it was next door to the the Hotel Splendide is because\nthe Germans made the Hotel Splendide the headquarters of the armistice\ncommission. So every day, when I went to work for the Quakers, I had to go by\nthese damn cars, with swastika flags on. And which di \u2014 scary enough. And also\nbecause \u2014 and this is way off from what we\u2019re talking about, but there\u2019s a guy by the\nname of Varian Fry that you might be familiar with. Varian Fry came into \u2014 into\nMarseilles, and made his headquarters in the Splendide.",
        "Q: As well?",
        "A: As well. Varian Fry was sent over by Eleanor Roosevelt to rescue a few\nhundred people like the ones I described to you before. Nobel prize winners, famous\nJanuary 12, 2016\ninternational painters, artists, engineers, poets, writers, musicians. And that was\nVarian Fry\u2019s task.",
        "Q: And the surgeon with his two assistants?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know where he fit in.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Maybe the surgeon would have made it, but not the assistants.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: See, he had nobody to polish his shoes any more. But Varian Fry was there for a\nwhile, but then he \u2014 he \u2014 he was advised to get out of there because the Nazis would\nfigure out who he is, and that \u2014 that would not be good.",
        "Q: Did you meet him at the time? Did you know who he was?",
        "A: I\u2019ve met Varian Fry, but you know, I was a 15 year old boy, ve met him\nbecause he came to our office, which was the headquarters of the Quakers, for the\nwhole Europe. And the \u2014",
        "Q: For all of Europe?",
        "A: Yeah, they \u2014 well, they got kicked out of Paris, they got kicked out of Spain,\nMarseilles was the only place left.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I could ri \u2014 I could tell you about the Quakers for days. They \u2014 the kind of\npeople they were, the \u2014 unbelievable people.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: I would like to hear about it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But first, let\u2019s talk about Varian Fry.",
        "A: So, we \u2014",
        "Q: He came to your offices?",
        "A: Well, he just came to visit.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I, you know, I knew he was Varian Fry. I did not know what his mission\nwas. I knew that he worked with us, but I didn\u2019t know that he was charged by the\nU.S. government, of rescuing famous people. And then he took an office somewhere\nin [indecipherable]. The rest is about Varian Fry\u2019s history. But \u2014 but that\u2019s \u2014 you\nhave to understand how this layout worked. The Splendide, with the Germans here,\nand we were in the building next door, 29 Boulevard d\u2019 Ath\u00e9nes. So, anyway \u2014 so I\nworked there initially, as the interpreter. And then they got to know me, and I got to\nknow them, and \u2014 but you have to keep in mind, I was 14 years old. I keep telling\nmy grandkids, who are 25, don\u2019t know how to get their finger out of their ear, what\nyou can do at 14, if you have to, you know. It\u2019s \u2014 was not my choosing.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was fate. And so \u2014 so at first, I did some of that all the time, but then there was\na gentleman by the name of Andel(ph) Burns Chalmers, he was a minister,\nJanuary 12, 2016\nProtestant minister from the United States, very soft spoken, twice as tall as I was.\nAnd he decided that I was going to work for him. And so \u2014",
        "Q: And he worked in that office, too?",
        "A: Yeah, he was there. Like, he \u2014 he was the guy responsible for answering\nrefugees\u2019 questions, problems. And that included \u2014 that included refugees in\nconcentration camps. So all the correspondence from the concentration camps came\nto Mr. Chalmers \u2014 Dr. Chalmers. And \u2014 so gradually, besides going with Mrs.\nKirschner, Mrs. Kirschner was the wife of the president. The president was\nHoward Kirschner.",
        "Q: And he \u2014 of the Quaker organization.",
        "A: Yes. He is \u2014 he was the big guy, and he had a deputy, whose name was Herbert\nLagler, who was a young American. Kirschner was a very religious man, who had\nmade a lot of money, and he decided he had to give back. And so he took over\nhelping refugees in France \u2014 Spain and France. And his wife was in charge of all\nthe children\u2019s colonies. They established children\u2019s colonies, there were a lot of kids\naround whose parents had disappeared, and the Quakers took them all in, and \u2014 and\nset up schools. My stomach is working again, I\u2019m sure you hear.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I\u2019m sorry if they\u2019re recording.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.\n100January 12, 2016",
        "A: And he then decided to use me. And he and I sat down and we developed a\nquestionnaire, which the Germans call a fragebogen. And we developed a\nquestionnaire of all the questions he had to have answered, in order to be able to\nanswer the letters he got from the concentration camps, internment camps, whatever.\nAnd I got a letter, which I have. I was charged with going to the American consulate.",
        "Q: Before we get there \u2014 before we get to the American consulate, I want to find out\na little bit more about the office. You know, you mentioned a number of people; the\nlocal French hire Dr. Chalmers, I think, yes, the Kirschners. How large was the\noffice in general? How many employees did it have, approximately?",
        "A: Oh, at least 25. I have a picture of it in \u2014 you have the picture tho \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 there was \u2014 there was Howard Kirschner and his wife, and she\nwas not in the chain of command, but she had a function.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: And Herbert Lagler, who was a deputy. And then there were about four or five\npeople who were principles, who had different assignments. Chalmers, there was a\ngentleman by the name of Stevenson(ph), that only worked with refugees, and how\nto help refugees. And I am convinced that there were a couple people in the office\nwho worked for the underground. There was a guy with a wig, wi-with a cape \u2014",
        "Q: No.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n101January 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, that came in all the time. He had a red wig, and with this cape. His name\nwas Jean-Julien Chapenoire(ph). He was French, and I am sure he was part of the\nunderground. I just never figured that he could be anything else. He didn\u2019t ha \u2014 he \u2014\nhe didn\u2019t have a office in the office, but he was there, a lot of the time. Then they\nhad subsidiaries near the camps, at Toulouse and a couple place. But, I have a\npicture I\u2019Il show you, after we get off the air here, of a meeting of the Quakers that \u2014\nwhere they took a picture of everybody. And there were secretaries, of course.\nEverybody had a secretary, an assistant, to do all the paperwork, because most of\nwhat they did was paperwork.",
        "Q: And were most of the \u2014 aside from the secretary who \u2014 the receptionist, were\nmost everybody American?",
        "A: Most were American, but there were some British, there were some \u2014 a Swede or\ntwo. There \u2014 there were some pretty famous names in there. There \u2014 there were\npeople from western Europe who were in that sphere of social activity, support,\nwhatever.",
        "Q: Were they all Quaker?",
        "A: I doubt it.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me \u2014 you mentioned earlier that you found them remarkable. What\nwas \u2014 what were \u2014 what were some of the things that struck you that way, about the\nQuakers?January 12, 2016",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 they were all very kind people.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They had a \u2014 they had a \u2014 I\u2019m not convinced that they were all Quakers. The \u2014\nsome of them were Unitarians, Mennonites, and so on. And \u2014 but they had a meeting\nevery Sunday morning \u2014 a Quaker meeting every Sunday morning. I\u2019m not sure that\nHoward Kirschner was a Quaker, but he was a religious person, very religious.\nThey had a meeting every Sunday morning in the \u2014 in the conference room, where \u2014\nthat I was privileged to attend. Where I didn\u2019t understand half of what was going on,\nbut because that was \u2014 we were now at a higher intellectual level. And they did \u2014 the\nmeeting room were about twice as big as this, and \u2014 and it consisted of chairs a-\nalong the wall. No table. All the way on the outside. And people would come in and\nsit down, and nobody would say anything, until somebody would speak up, and\npresent some thoughts about some issue. Very highly philosophical, or \u2014 or what\nthey saw that week, or whatever. And then they\u2019d sit down \u2014 not sit down, they\nnever got up \u2014 and they would stop, and then be a silence, and then somebody else\nwould pick up, and so that \u2014",
        "Q: Did they talk \u2014 would they respond to the first statement, or would they then say\ntheir own?",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t remember all the details, but they \u2014 they \u2014 it was not \u2014 it was not\ncoordinated any way, it was all on the spur of the moment, the spirit of it. And it\nJanuary 12, 2016\nwas, you know, because it was a high level English, I \u2014 some of that I didn\u2019t\nunderstand. That was not my level. My level was somewhere here. But it was very\ninspiring, it was very beautiful.",
        "Q: I\u2014I-\u2014Td like to understand \u2014 make sure that I understand it better.\nQ2: Now might be a good time to pause for lunch.",
        "Q: I\u2014I\u2014I know, but I want to finish this one question, is \u2014 if it\u2019s possible. Okay.\nWhen somebody would say something, and they finished, would then there be a\ndiscussion from others, that would revolve around that topic, or \u2014 or not?",
        "A: I can\u2019t answer that any more.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t think so, but it may have been. It may be the next one who spoke took\noff from where the first one left off.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But it wa \u2014 it was not a discussion across the room.",
        "Q: That\u2019s one of the question \u2014",
        "A: It was just a presentation of thoughts, which may have been, or may not have\nbeen related to what the first person said.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. Let\u2019s pause here, and we\u2019ll come back. Thank you.",
        "A: Thank you.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Thank you very \u2014 [break] Okay, before the break, we were talking about your\nwork, the work that you were starting to \u2014 to do with the Quaker organization in\nMarseilles, and how you ended up working with Dr. Chalmers. And tell me now\nhow that developed, and what \u2014 how it took you from their offices to the offices of\nthe U.S. consulate in Marseilles. Describe that to me.",
        "A: Yeah, the \u2014 a-as Dr. Chalmers and I got to know each other better, and he was\noverwhelmed, because the number of people in these camps that wrote to him, was\nvery, very large. And so he got a great number of \u2014 of letters every day, with people\npleading for assistance to save their life by getting an American visa, if they could.\nThe \u2014 he felt that I knew enough about things, and \u2014 so that he appointed me to be\nhis leg-man, his messenger, if you wish \u2014 it was more than a messenger, a messenger\nis an understatement \u2014 to the American consulate, to answer the question, which\nbasically amounted to, what\u2019s the status of my papers, and pos-possibility to get a\nvisa to the United States, from every one of these people that wrote. So he and I\ndevised a questionnaire so I could quickly go through files and \u2014 and fill out the\nblanks, and so he could answer the letters.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they gave me \u2014 they gave me a letter, which I \u2014 to present\nto the guard at the American consulate. After a few times, the guard knew me, so I\ndidn\u2019t need the letter, but initially saying that I was the representative of the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n105January 12, 2016\nQuakers, and I could have access to the consulate. And so I started going to the\nconsulate, I would say twice a week, to do this. Number one, it wasn \u2014 it wasn\u2019t easy\nto get into the consulate, for normal human beings. There was a line of people\naround the block to get into the American consulate, to see a representative of the\nconsulate, to find out the status of their papers, if they were able to do this. What I\nwas handling is the people who weren\u2019t able to come to the consulate.",
        "Q: Can you describe the consulate building physically, like you did the Quaker\nbuilding, next to Hotel Splendide? What did \u2014 where was it, and so \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s one block from the police prefecture, which \u2014 in the middle\nof town, which is a mammoth building. And there\u2019s a square, I don\u2019t remember the\nname of the square. I can tell you that today, the \u2014 which is not your question, but\ntoday the consulate\u2019s moved up about 10 buildings, and has a square, and the address\nof the square is Place Varian Fry, which I think is an interesting little thing that\nnobody\u2019ll tell you, unless you go there and you see it. But they were on a middle of a\nblock, with mammoth oak door, it was an old office building. Or it could have been\na private home, with a fairly large number of rooms 1n it, then you went in from the\nstreet, up some steps, and then you were inside the consulate.",
        "Q: So there was no \u2014 it wasn\u2019t such that it was a building that had a yard around it,\nand then a wall, or a gate, and you were \u2014",
        "A: No.\n106\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: No, it was actually a building \u2014",
        "A: At that time \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 it was part of a \u2014 because it came out of peace time, it was still the same thing it\nhad been before, in peacetime, where people just went to a consulate, like you go to\nany office building. Well, there was a sm \u2014 relatively small building, but it was\nattached on both sides, to other buildings.",
        "Q: And did the U.S. consulate have the entire building to itself, or only certain\nfloors?",
        "A: To this \u2014 to this building, yes.",
        "Q: The whole building?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And about how li\u2014 how many stories did it have?",
        "A: I believe not more than two.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: It was not a\u2014 it was more a spread out building, and deep building, than it was a\nhigh building.",
        "Q: Did you have a sense of how many \u2014 how large a place it was, how many people\nworked there, at the time?\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t \u2014I can\u2019t tell you that. I \u2014 because I only related with certain people. I\nrelated to the people in the consulate division. A consulate has other functions. Like\nthe con \u2014 I never saw the consul general, not that I would \u2014 I wanted to. He was not a\nvery nice guy, I\u2019m told. But I only dealt with the consular staff, the people that\nhanded \u2014 handled the people applying for visa, or it could have been Americans who\ncame in, to have a stamp put in their passport. But that was the one section of the \u2014\nthe consulate, overall, that I dealt with.",
        "Q: Okay. Again, to \u2014 for \u2014 for me to be able to get a picture of this, there are people\nwho are standing outside with a line winding around a square, or you know, they\u2019re\nwaiting for a long time. And \u2014 and if they\u2019re coming on their own to see \u2014 to find out\nthe status of their application. When you go in, do you go to the same window that\nthey would go, except that yours is streamlined, that is you are able to not have to\nwait in line? Or, is it that you don\u2019t have to stand by a window, you\u2019re actually\nadmitted to a place beyond a counter, that normal people wouldn\u2019t be able to get to?",
        "A: The latter. I\u2014 once I got past the guard, I was on my own.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: I went in the building to the section where the consular department was, and they\nhad this mammoth file room. You could call it a conference room. It had a big, big,\nlong oaken table in the middle, and the rest of the room were file cabinets, all the\nway again \u2014 against the wall, all the way around \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: So around the \u2014 around the perimeter.",
        "A: \u2014 around the table. And so, I went in there, I didn\u2019t ask anybody for anything, I\njust went in, and I put my briefcase and my files on the table. And the files were\norganized alphabetically. So I started at A, and worked my way around. And you\nknow, I had my \u2014 my request letters also in alphabetical order, so I could work my\nway in some kind of orderly fashion, to look up the files of the people whose\nrequests I had.",
        "Q: Was there anybody else from the consular office in the room at the time?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: It was me in charge.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 when you think about it, especially nowadays, you know, I worked in\nembassies and consulates later in life, it \u2014 it was totally inconceivable. It was that I \u2014\nand you know, as I say, I was a 15 year old boy \u2014 that I was \u2014 I had this access. Once\nI was inside, I was free to in \u2014 within the consular section, not the whole consulate \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014I don\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t get involved there. But I just went in there and did my job.",
        "Q: But nevertheless though, I mean, these are important files \u2014",
        "A: Of course.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: \u2014 you know, and very vital to the people who are requesting.",
        "A: Life and death.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, and every time I went in there, I also looked under\nHockenheimer.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you that.",
        "A: And see oh, has anything come in from the last time, you know, from our\nrelatives.",
        "Q: Now, when your family put together your request, who did you approach to be\nyour sponsors in the United States?",
        "A: Oh, in the United States? Well, there were two. There was my mother\u2019s sister,\nElsa(ph) and Charlie Heiman(ph), who had only been in the United States since\n1939, I believe, so they weren\u2019t that well established in 1940 \u2014 \u201941. But he was a\nbusinessman, and so he gave us what was required, probably still is, an affidavit.\nAnd then my mother\u2019s brother Walter, Walter Lowen(ph), he changed his name\nfrom Lowenthal to Lowen(ph), he lived in Seattle, and he gave us another\nstatement. What they wanted is a statement saying we would not become wards of\nthe state. That\u2019s really what it amounted to. And so we had these, and the \u2014 the \u2014 the\n\u2014 the consulate ha \u2014 the consul, in charge of consul affairs had to \u2014 had to decide\nwhether it was enough, or not, semicolon; the policy in Washington was not to give\nJanuary 12, 2016\nany visas. Cordell Hull was Secretary of State, and he had a sidekick who was\nworse, and their policy was not to give visas to refugees. Jewish refugees, I can\u2019t tell\nyou exactly, but that was the policy. The \u2014 the consul general in Marseilles, whose\nname just came to my mind, was Fullerton. Mr. Fullerton was abiding by these\ninstructions, and on his staff he had vice-consul Hiram Bingham, and who had a\nsidekick whose name was Miles Standish. If you want to be American, you can\u2019t\nget more American than Hiram Bingham and Miles Standish. And they were on\ntheir own. They, on their own, decided. They met the refugees. Miles Standish and\nBingham went to Saint Nicolas camp, and \u2014 and got the Lion Feuchtwanger out\nwhile he was washing himself at the creek, a-and they \u2014 they \u2014 they had a taxi\nstanding nearby. They \u2014 they quickly changed him into a woman, and had him sit in\nthe back of the seat. And when the police stopped the taxi, they said, who is that in\nthe back? Oh, that\u2019s my mother-in-law from Georgia, and the taxi waved them on.\nHe was an American consul, so they thought he had some authority. And that\u2019s how\nthey got him out of there, but you could have access to \u2014 to Saint Nicolas, in\nNiemes. But anyway, it \u2014 Hiram Bingham worked with Varian Fry, they met\nsecretly in places, to exchange information on getting the people that Eleanor\nRoosevelt wanted out. How to figure out how to get them passport, and get them on\na boat, or another boat, over the mountains, into Spain, or whatever. There were \u2014\n111January 12, 2016",
        "Q: So, I mean \u2014 I mean \u2014 of course, Eleanor Roosevelt was not part of the \u2014\nformally a part of the U.S. government. However, as the wife of the president, she\u2019s\nclearly has interests that are in contradiction to Mr. Hull, you know \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 at the State department.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So it sounds \u2014",
        "A: But she was a power.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Eleanor Roosevelt was a power unto herself, and nobody would have challenged\n\u2014 Cordell lul \u2014 Hull would not have challenged Eleanor Roosevelt. So this is the\nkind of stuff that you \u2014 you know, put a blind eye on it. But \u2014 but what Hiram\nBingham did, you know, was spectacular, because he issued 2,500 visas to people\nwithout permission from \u2014 from Washing \u2014",
        "Q: Now, wasn\u2019t that risking getting into a lot of hot water?",
        "A: Oh yeah, he did. He got into a lot of hot water. He \u2014 we left in May of \u201941, in\nJune of \u201941, they \u2014 they canned him. They pulled him out. Some people knew about\nhim, and complained to Vichy. We had an American ambassador in Vichy, Admiral\nLeahy, and somebody got at him. He was no particular wonderful person, and they \u2014\nthey put pressure on him, and they \u2014 they pulled him out and send him first toJanuary 12, 2016\nLisbon for a few months, and then to south Montevideo. And then, I don\u2019t remem \u2014\nI don\u2019t know what they did exactly, but they \u2014 he retired, or quit the foreign service\nbecause they made life so miserable for him, and never got another job.",
        "Q: Within the government, or \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So he did pay a stiff price.",
        "A: Yeah, he \u2014 he was \u2014 as a result, he was kicked out of the government. But he sa \u2014\nhad saved 2,500 people. He was a very tall man, he had 11 children. He \u2014 he\nfollowed his conscience.",
        "Q: Did you have interaction with him?",
        "A: Yes. One time, I \u2014 maybe more, but I remember one time, the \u2014 in \u2014 in March,\napproximately, of \u201941, Mr. Chalmers \u2014 Dr. Chalmers said to me one day, I have \u2014\nhad you \u2014 as you know, I live with Hiram Bingham \u2014 which I didn\u2019t know \u2014 and we\nspoke last night, and he said next time you are at the consulate, drop in to see him.\nAnd as you can well imagine, I went to the consulate the next day. I didn\u2019t let any\ngrass grow under my feet. And there I had to, you know, ask \u2014 there was a Miss\nHouligan(ph), who was kind of the administrative person there, she was a nice\nperson. And I told her that Hiram Bingham wanted to see me, and so she took me\nin to see him. And he said to me, you know, th-the Quakers highly recommend you\nand your family. I \u2014 I know your dad is at Gurs, and we\u2019re ready to issue you visas.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016\nBut if you issue a visa, it\u2019s only good for 90 days, and \u2014 but your dad is at Gurs, so\nwe first have to get your dad out of Gurs before I advise that you get a vise,\notherwise, it might run out before you get to the United States, and you have to start\nfrom scratch. And so he \u2014 he \u2014 he said, I\u2019m giving you a letter, addressed to the\ncommandant at \u2014 at Gurs, whoever\u2019s in charge, and saying \u2014 on American si \u2014\nconsulate stationery, saying that we\u2019re prepared to issue your family a visa, and the\nchances are 50-50 that they\u2019ll let him go. And so \u2014 and then, you come back. And so\nwe \u2014 we \u2014 he gave me the letter, we sent it to Dad, they let him out.",
        "Q: But I want to stop right here. I can\u2019t imagine what you must have felt like when\nyou heard those words. I mean, out of so many years of uncertainty.",
        "A: You have to remember, I was 15 years old. At 15, you don\u2019t go into all the\npossible angles. All that mattered to me is that the American consulate was going to\ngive us a visa to get out. That \u2014 th-that, you know. And you can imagine how my\nmother felt. And so, you know, and that came \u2014",
        "Q: How did she \u2014 how did she react when you told her?",
        "A: Well, she was \u2014 well, you \u2014 honestly, you didn\u2019t believe any of it until after it\nhappened. That \u2014 you know, I'll give you an example in a second. The \u2014 the \u2014 so we\nget \u2014 Dad came back, so we had to get out, okay? So the debate became, how do you\nget out? You could \u2014 you had two options; you could go through Spain. There was a\nguy by the name of Francisco Franco there, who could have caused you a hardJanuary 12, 2016\ntime, you didn\u2019t know. Or, you could take a ship from Marseilles to the West\nIndies. Now, there weren\u2019t that many ships, but th-they \u2014 there were some. And so\nwe decided okay, so we worked, from the point of view, when was our ship going?\nAnd so, there was a ship on the sixth of May, the Winnipeg, and there was a ship on\nthe 10\" of May, the Wyoming. And so, you had to get ship\u2019s passage, which wasn\u2019t\na given. You needed an exit visa from France, and you needed a transit visa for the\nFrench West Indies, and you needed ship\u2019s passage. And so we started working on\nthat. The Quakers, the \u2014 Herbert Lagler, the number two guy at the Quakers, called\nthe president of the French line, and said, we have four members of our staff \u2014 note\nthe \u2014 the wording \u2014 who are ready to go to the States, we need four bunks, passages,\nwhatever. And the president \u2014 they didn\u2019t start at the bottom, they went to the\npresident of the French line. And the president of the French line said, we \u2014 we have\nno more cabins. And Herbert Lagler said, well, our staff members will take any\naccommodation. Which meant the hold of the ship, because these ships were not\npassenger ships, they had ca \u2014 they were freighters with some cabins. And so they\nhad turned the \u2014 the hold into receptacles for human beings. And say \u2014 our quo \u2014 our\nmembers will \u2014 will take whatever you got. So, okay. So \u2014 I\u2019m stepping si-sideway\nhere.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: And we \u2014 they sent me as a messenger from the Quakers, to the French line,\ncalled the Messageries Maritimes, to pick up the tickets and give him a check. And\n\u2014and I got the tickets, and he said, who are you? I\u2019m the messenger of the Quakers,\nokay? So I had my four tickets, which turned out to \u2014 well, I\u2019ll get to that. And then\nwe had to get the papers from the French police prefecture, for exit visa and the\ntransit visa. And this is where the story always gets me, is that we knew that on the\nsecond floor of the house, the apartment house we lived in, there was a lady, middle-\naged lady, who lived with her aunt and uncle, they were Corsicans. They were called\nGiglielmi(ph) Morachini(ph). And we knew her \u2014 them \u2014 we didn\u2019t know her aunt\nand uncle at all, but \u2014 and I can\u2019t tell you whether her name was Giglielmi(ph), or\nMorachini(ph). But, be that as it may. And \u2014 but we knew she worked for the\nFrench police prefecture. So my mother and I went, rang her doorbell. And all we\nknew about her was from saying, bonjour Madame, as we went higher up than she\nlived, as she came out the door. And we said, Madame, we understand that you work\nat the police prefecture, and this is our situation. We have visa for the United States,\nwe're leaving, we need a French exit visa, and transit visa, and can you help us with\nthat? She said yes. And she said, I will bring you the papers tomorrow, to fill out. So,\nshe \u2014 next day we saw her, and she \u2014 she gave us some questionnaires to fill out, and\nwe filled them out. Rang her doorbell, and said, here are the papers. Okay, I will let\nyou know when I get the answer. Few days later she contacted us, and she said, the\n116January 12, 2016\npapers are ready, and \u2014 but you have to go pick them up yourself, because you have\nto get a stamp, and they \u2014 they put \u2014 paste the stamp on there, like a postage stamp,\nbut it\u2019s a fee, or whatever. So I went there, and I picked up the papers, and again\nthey asked me who I was, and I said, I\u2019m the messenger. And I gave them the money\nthey wanted, and you know, they don\u2019t ask 15 year old kids much. You \u2014 you\u2019 ve \u2014 if\nI had been 25, it would have been different, but I wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Sometimes that\u2019s lucky.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, that\u2019s what \u2014 my whole life has been like that. And I-I\u2014I-I ga\u2014-\nso I wound up with the \u2014 with the French exit visas, and with the transit visa for the\n\u2014 for the Martinique. And \u2014 and you have to ask yourself the question, is why did\nshe do that?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: She was a nice lady, she knew us for years, she knew whe \u2014 we were nice people,\ngood neighbors. She didn\u2019t know any \u2014 a thing about us, otherwise. And she spoke\nfrom her conscience. And every time I tell this story, I have a hard time telling it,\nbecause it was such a unexpected thing, that came out of \u2014 you know. It\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s a\nhuman \u2014 it was a human gesture that \u2014 that just transcends anything you can say\nabout anything. And so we had all that, and then we \u2014 we had a \u2014 we had to get rid\nof all our furniture. And so we did that, I don\u2019t remember how, my parents did that.\nAnd my mother \u2014 my dad said, before we got the tickets, my dad said, Winnipeg on\nJanuary 12, 2016\nthe sixth of May, Wyoming on the 10\" of May. We ought to take the Wyoming, it\u2019]]\ngive us four more days to get everything taken care of. And that\u2019s the one time in my\nlife that I heard my mother said, over my dead body. I don\u2019t know how you say that\nin German, but she said, over my dead body, we\u2019re leaving on the sixth of May. And\nso, on the sixth of May \u2014 now, we did take some things along. My sister and I don\u2019t\nknow how there\u2019s \u2014 if you go around the corner here, there\u2019s a mammoth oil painting\nof the Bavarian Alps in there. That came out with us. We have no idea how they did\nthat, absolutely no idea.",
        "Q: Maybe they rolled it up.",
        "A: They\u2019re free \u2014 their \u2014 no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was like this.",
        "Q: In a frame?",
        "A: There were three di \u2014 there are three more paintings. There\u2019s a naked lady down\nthe hall, she was part of it, and my sister has two oil paintings, and \u2014 and then a\nbunch of books, that was it. Kultur.",
        "Q: Kultur.",
        "A: Germans believe in culture, and that \u2014 furniture be damned, you know.",
        "Q: You can always get furniture.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: You can always get furniture, but paintings and \u2014 and so \u2014 anyway, so Winnipeg\nit was, and the Quakers picked us up in the staff car, American Friend Service\nCommittee on it. They took us to the pier, to the \u2014 to the gangplank, and there was\nthe German with the swastika. You know, it \u2014 it always just to keep you from\nwhatever.",
        "Q: Just from being too sure.",
        "A: And he checked everybody that got up there. They were looking for people that\nwere on their list. Wi\u2014 thank God, we were not important enough, so we were not\non their list, so we got up there. But they did arrest a \u2014 a few people there. The wife\nof a former member of Parliament, and a few people like that. And so then,\nWinnipeg took off, sixth of May. We went from Marseilles to Oran in Algeria, did\nnot dock. Then we turned west, to Gibraltar, we went through Gibraltar to\nCasablanca. We stopped in Casablanca. We were able to touch the soil, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve\ntouched the soil of Africa. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you see Humphrey Bogart?",
        "A: No, he wasn\u2019t there. Even Sam the piano player wasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: And we \u2014 it was my sister\u2019s birthday, the 14\" of May, 1940. And my dad had\nconnections in \u2014 in Casa, and because it was her birthday, he got a message to them,\nand the guy came on a motorcycle, to bring her some strawberries. She was\nJanuary 12, 2016\nsupposed to get whipped cream, but he said it was too hot, and the whipped cream\nwould be sour. So I\u2019ve been giving my sister strawberries and whipped cream ever\nsince then, every year. But, so then we left \u2014",
        "Q: How lovely.",
        "A: \u2014 we left Casa, and went down along North Africa, down to Dakar, but did not\ntouch. Dakar is right on the equator. And we went across the equator to the West\nIndies. Now, the day before we got to Martinique \u2014 actually, a night and a half\nbefore we got to Martinique, it was so damn hot in the ship \u2014 there are lots of things\nabout the ship that I\u2019ll spare you, but it was so hot, there was no way I could stay\ndown \u2014 down in the \u2014 in the hold. I mean, you \u2014 you just \u2014 you suffocated. And I \u2014\nabout midnight I went up on deck, and I \u2014 just to get some air, just to breathe. And I\nbecame aware of several things. One of them was that it was pitch black. The sea\nwas totally calm, there was no wave going on. But then I dis-discovered, or decided\nthat the ship wasn\u2019t really moving. I said oh, what\u2019s going on here? And I went and I\nlooked and talked to some people, and we were just sitting there. And then all of a\nsudden, from all sides, we were lit up in \u2014 1n lights, as the focal point, and some \u2014\nsome rope ladders were thrown up on the ship, and a bunch of characters came up,\nand we couldn\u2019t tell who they were. They had no uniform on, they wore blue jeans,\nor whatever, and they all had weapons. And they spoke a language which I didn\u2019t\n120January 12, 2016\nunderstand, which you know, I \u2014I was pretty good at languages, but I didn\u2019t know\nwhat they were talking. And so they took us over, they cap \u2014",
        "Q: But what did they look like?",
        "A: \u2014 they captured us. And \u2014",
        "Q: Pirates?",
        "A: No. They \u2014 they were \u2014 they were \u2014 they were Dutch, of the wild Dutch army in\nexile, the \u2014 the free Dutch, who had gone to England, and they captured us on\nbehalf of the \u2014 on behalf of the British, and they took us to the French \u2014 to the\nBritish to trade that, at the British West Indies.",
        "Q: Well, so what flag was the Winnipeg flying under?",
        "A: Well, that \u2014 that \u2014 that is very cogent question, because we didn\u2019t know who they\nwere, but in the morning when we got daylight, I looked at the flag, and the flag\nwasn\u2019t tricolor any more, it was orange, which represented the House of Orange-\nNassau of the Netherlands. And so they took us in, they took us to Port of Spain,\nTrinidad, and they had captured us. Of course, we had some French soldiers aboard,\ngoing to Martinique as replacements, or whatever. And then the \u2014 the \u2014 the radio\noperator barricaded himself in the thing, and he called in the French for whatever,\nand the \u2014 one ef \u2014 one airplane came, and somebody \u2014 they didn\u2019t do anything, they\njust took us to Trinidad.\n121January 12, 2016",
        "Q: But what a footnote. I mean, everything that we know about World War II is that\nthe French, and the British were allies. And here \u2014",
        "A: Not after Vichy, this was Vichy.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay. These were Vichy \u2014",
        "A: This was a Vichy ship.",
        "Q: A Vichy ship.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t say that. A Vichy ship, it was flying under the Vichy flag,\ngoing to Martinique, which was under the con \u2014 control of Vichy. Now, the reason\nI understand they did it \u2014 [phone ringing, break]",
        "Q: So, Vichy.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Vichy and Martinique.",
        "A: Yeah. And they \u2014 they took us to Trinidad, which was British, and the reason\nthey did it, I\u2019m told, is that the Germans, Rommel in North Africa had \u2014 had given\nthe Nazis the rights to use airports in Syria. Haven\u2019t you heard of Syria before? And\nas a countermeasure, the \u2014 the British decided a \u2014 hey, you think we can\u2019t do\nanything? So the British decided to \u2014 okay, as punishment, they decided to sh \u2014\ndecided to seize a Vichy French ship. The \u2014 we happened to be on board. The reason\nthis is so important about the \u2014 the \u2014 the Winnipeg and the Wyoming, is because\nwhen the Winnipeg was captured, the Wyoming, four days behind us, was off theJanuary 12, 2016\ncoast of Africa, coming across the equator. And when \u2014 and when this happened,\nwhen the Winnipeg was captured, the Wyoming was turned around, back to Africa,\nso he wouldn\u2019t be captured, and the people who were in the Wyoming spent the rest\nof the war in \u2014 in \u2014 in Senegal, some of them working on the Trans-Sahara rail\nline.",
        "Q: Your mother was so right.",
        "A: Not one more day.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Every day \u2014 when you get in a situation like this, don\u2019t delay anything, because\nyou never know what\u2019s changing tomorrow.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And so that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s why the Winnipeg, Wyoming story is important, because\nthe alternative would have been, we wa \u2014 would have wound up in Africa.",
        "Q: Now, Winnipeg and Wyoming are not French names.",
        "A: No, but ships can have \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014any name. The Winnipeg was sunk during World War IJ, in \u2014 in the Atlantic,\nwhen it was working for the allies.",
        "Q: Was it?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, you can look up that kind of stuff \u2014\n123\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 on the web nowadays.",
        "Q: Okay. So what happened to you when you were in Trinidad? How did things\ndevelop?",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 the people of Trinidad had \u2014 were told that the British had captured\nthe German warship, which we were not. And so half of Trinidad was out on the\npier, trying to see what these Germans looked like, and of course, it was women and\nchildren. And the British were very nice. They put us in a camp, but the camp was\nnicely organized. They fed us, and whatever. And to the extent that they even\nproduced buses to take us on a tour of Port of Spain.",
        "Q: Really.",
        "A: So it \u2014 it was no hardship post. And so what we \u2014 but what we needed to do, you\nsee, because our trip was arranged for us to take a ship out of Martinique to New\nYork, it was all paid for. And we weren\u2019t in Martinique, so we couldn\u2019t take a ship\nfrom Martinique to New York. So we had to start from scratch on that, but we were\nsafe.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And so my mother contacted her sister, Elsie(ph) and Charlie Heiman(ph) in\nCincinnati, and they \u2014 they booked passages for us from Trinidad to \u2014 to New\nYork on the luxury liner called the SS Uruguay, which came from South America,\n124\nJanuary 12, 2016\nto New York. And after being on that \u2014 on the Winnipeg, in the hold, being a guest\nlike a first class passenger on the Uruguay, was another world. It \u2014 1t was, you\nknow, we \u2014 dining \u2014 air conditioned dining room, waiters with gloves, silver trays. I\nmean, how \u2014 how can \u2014 you know, you have to ask yourself, where the hell did that\ncome from, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was a little difficult, because there was a tropical storm \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 that hit us. When my mother and my sister went on the \u2014 on the Uruguay\nwithout a problem, then my dad and I were behind, getting the luggage, and\naccompanying the luggage. And when we went from \u2014 from Port of Spain, that \u2014\nthe Uruguay was too big to come into the harbor. It had to sit outside. And \u2014",
        "Q: So you had to go by boat?",
        "A: And \u2014 or a little boat, one puff-pu-pu-pu \u2014 little one-horsepower motor. And there\nwere about, I don\u2019t know, 20 people on this thing. It was a little cabin with a \u2014 with\nthe guy in charge, the pilot. And we didn\u2019t all fit in. There was a young doctor, by\nthe name of Dr. Hirschberg(ph) \u2014 I just saw his name yesterday, somewhere. He\nand I were outside, and our job was, when the cyclone hit us, to \u2014 you know, these\nlittle boats have tires on the side, so that when they hit something else \u2014",
        "Q: Right.\n125\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 they don\u2019t fall apart.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so every time a wave came, he would throw the tire on \u2014 on the deck, and\nHirschberg(ph) or I would throw the tire back out in the water, you know. So when\nwe got to the \u2014 to the Uruguay, they had a platform at the bottom, with a gangplank,\nand this thing would come to the gangplank, and they \u2014 they said jump. I says, I\u2019m\nnot gonna jump. I was soaking wet, I had water in my shoes. I was soaked, you\nknow? Every wave had gone over my head. Said, I\u2019m not jumping, because if I slip,\nthe thing\u20191l come back and I\u20191l fall between, it\u2019Il crush me. I said, I\u2014 I\u2019m not\njumping. My mother was up there looking down. She recognized me. And the\ncaptain was standing next to her, and she started screaming, and the captain said,\nwhat\u2019s going on. She said, that\u2019s my son, that\u2019s my son. And he sent down some\nsailors on the platform, and one of them jumped on our little boat, and the other one\nheld the rope, and the one held me until I was on the \u2014",
        "Q: Other side.",
        "A: \u2014 on the other side, and I went up \u2014 I wa \u2014 I was seasick for a while because \u2014\nfrom that \u2014 from the little boat, you know?",
        "Q: Oh yeah.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: The Uruguay was sitting there like it was a mountain in the water, wasn\u2019t\nmoving. But that was the last part of trip. We had to \u2014 you know, we had to get a\ntouch of everything. So then we came to New York, and \u2014",
        "Q: But from that \u2014 from that point of \u2014 of \u2014 of risk, of getting from the small boat\ninto there, you go into air conditioned spaces, with white gloves and silverware, and\nfirst class, and all of that.",
        "A: Yep.",
        "Q: My God, what an adventure.",
        "A: I\u2014 you know, it was \u2014 it\u2019s beyond \u2014 we didn\u2019t have the proper clothes, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In\u20141n that dining room, you\u2019re supposed to dress up with a tie, and so on. I\ndidn\u2019t have anything like that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So \u2014 but there 1s \u2014 it went fine, I just \u2014 I got over my seasickness by go \u2014 jumping\nin a swimming pool.",
        "Q: They had a swimming pool?",
        "A: Oh, they had several swimming pool. This was first class.",
        "Q: And just a question, that painting must have been spent \u2014 sent other ways. I can\u2019t\nimagine you bringing a painting on a boat, a little boat, going up to the Uruguay.",
        "A: Same way.\n127January 12, 2016",
        "Q: Same way?",
        "A: Yeah, it was on \u2014 oh, mean to the Uruguay\u201d",
        "Q: Yeah. How could you get a big \u2014",
        "A: You know, nobody\u2019s ever asked me that question. It must have gone with us. I \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know how else, I pa \u2014 I don\u2019t know the answer.",
        "Q: I mean, but how would you go from a small boat to the \u2014 anyway, it\u2019s just a\ndetail.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What was it like when you got to New York? What did you see?",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 I\u2014I- we decided to \u2014 we stayed with relatives, I don\u2019t remember\nexactly whom, but \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m talking about the harbor. Did you see Lady Liberty?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I \u2014 in \u2014 in my book it says that twice in my life I ha \u2014 have\nhad this experience. The first one when \u2014 when we passed the Statue of Liberty, the\nfeeling that this brings out in you. And just to have arrived somewhere where they\nwon\u2019t kill you. And the second time that happened to me is on the other side of the\ncountry, when I ca \u2014 as a lieutenant, I came back from 14 months in Korea, and we\nwent under the Golden Gate bridge, and I almost went apart, because, you know, I\nfeel the same way about the Golden Gate bridge as I feel about the Statue of Liberty.\nIt\u2019s just a\u2014 you know, this feeling of, whew, I made it again, you know, kind of \u2014\n128January 12, 2016",
        "Q: Home. Safety.",
        "A: Yeah, it \u2014 it \u2014 you know, it was \u2014 it \u2014 it just \u2014 1t\u2019s \u2014 you can\u2019t even describe it,\nyou know, it\u2019s such a weight, just a \u2014 a weight off of you that you \u2014 I said gee, I\u2019ve\nbeen given another life, is what it amounts to. So \u2014",
        "Q: Well, I think this is a point where it\u2019s the right point to take a break. Thank you.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: Okay. [break] So, you come into New York harbor, and you\u2019re met by family,\nrelatives there. Tell me how \u2014 what happened then. Where did you folks go, where\ndid you settle?",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 basically, my family settled in New York. However, the same aunt\nand uncle in Cincinnati I\u2019ve talked about, Elsa(ph) and Charlie Heiman(ph),\ninvited me to come stay with them for a while, until my parents got settled. And so, I\nmoved to \u2014 to Cincinnati. My mother and sister went with me, and dropped me off\nwer \u2014 and stayed a little bit. My grandmother was there. They all lived in the same\nlittle court. And I spent 15 months, approximately, in Cincinnati. I graduated high\nschool, at 16, in Cincinnati. Decided I\u2019d learned everything I would ever learn. The\nonly thing they made me take is a course in civics. I had to be in a \u2014 good American,\nso I \u2014I took that, and American history, two courses. Then I graduated high school,\nand then I \u2014 I started at the University of Cincinnati. I \u2014 I worked during the day, I\nhad to \u2014 you know, that was part of the \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: What were you doing?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: What were you doing?",
        "A: Oh, I was working as a si \u2014 first I was working as an errand boy for an optical\ncompany on a bicycle. And I went over from Cincinnati to Covington and\nNewport, Kentucky every day. And then I decided that was too cold in winter, or\nsomething, and I got a job as a stock clerk in a \u2014 in a textile company. When I got\nbored of that, I got a job as a stock boy in a toy company. Those were the three jobs I\nhad, and I went to school at night, while I was there. And then, in October of \u201942, a\nre \u2014 the connection there was that my \u2014 my aunt and uncle had a son who was \u2014 who\nwas nine months younger than I am, and so he and I were buddies, and he taught me\nall about America. He\u2019d been there all of two years. A-And the \u2014 and he and I are\ngreat friends to this day. Then I went to New York, and my uncle was always sure I\nneeded a job to earn money. You know, that\u2019s the way he operated. He was no big\nintellectual, he was \u2014 and kind of frowned upon by that part of the family, because\nall we wanted to do, my sister and I, was go to college. And that wasn\u2019t necessary, in\norder to make money. So \u2014 but in New York I worked first for a textile company,\nthat he probably got me the job. And then \u2014 and then I decided I could do better\nthings. I went to school at night. I went to city college in New York at night, and\nplayed soccer on the weekends, in the French sporting club, and became quickly \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016\nwell, from the beginning, even in Cincinnati, I was totally \u2014 you have to understand,\nthat having had the experience that I had with the Quakers, I was not a normal kid. I\nhad the war \u2014 the war weighed very heavily on my \u2014 on my personality, and I\ncouldn\u2019t see where all these people were \u2014 people were sitting around and having a\ngood time, when there were people dying in \u2014 in Europe and nobody was helping\nthem. And so I was getti \u2014 got involved in \u2014 in \u2014 even in Cincinnati I joined the\nAlliance Frangaise, and tried to get people interested in what\u2019s going on in Europe,\nand we can\u2019t just \u2014",
        "Q: What is the Alliance Francaise?",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a cultural \u2014 it\u2019s a cultural \u2014",
        "Q: French?",
        "A: But French. And they had speakers. And since there were a lot of Frenchmen in\nexile at that point, they had speakers relating to the \u2014 to the war. The \u2014 Ron sent me\na bunch of \u2014 of documents from the Quakers, which \u2014 which \u2014 that \u2014 which included\nletters that I wrote from Cincinnati to the Quakers, asking them for certain actions,\nand do that, and do this, and do that. And \u2014 you know, normally no organization\nwould pay attention to what a 15 year old has to say, but I \u2014 I just was \u2014 I couldn\u2019t\nget that out of my system. So when I got to New York, besides everything else, I\nquickly got involved politically in the \u2014 with the f \u2014 free French youth, the \u2014 the de\nGaulle\u2019s youth. That was a great de Gaulle\u2019s \u2014 anything to fight the Nazis.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Did you see \u2014",
        "A: If I could have strangled Hitler myself tomorrow morning, I would have done it.",
        "Q: Did you see yourself at that point, as no more German, but now French? Or did\nyou know \u2014 did you have time to have questions of who am I, what \u2014 what is my\nidentity?",
        "A: I was French.",
        "Q: You were French, okay.",
        "A: I did the \u2014 I became the secretary general of the free French youth in the United\nStates, at 17.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 and I was very involved in \u2014 in raising money for the free French forces,\nstuff like that. I \u2014 until \u2014 until I went into the army, which was basically right after\nmy 18\" birthday.",
        "Q: Did you sign up, were you drafted? How did that occur?",
        "A: It worked like this, that I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t volunteer before I was 18, because\nI was not a citizen. That\u2019s the way I remember it. But on my 18\" birthday, I went to\nthe draft board and say hey, here I am. And they took only six weeks to \u2014",
        "Q: Call you up?",
        "A: \u2014 call me up. I had wanted, in \u2014 the year before \u2014 you know, this stuff tortured\nme. I mean, I wasn\u2019t necessarily always a happy camper, because I was tortured byJanuary 12, 2016\nwhat was going on, and here I was free, and now the other people were dying over\nthere. So that really was \u2014 it really worked on me. I wanted to join the free French\nforces, and my dad said, if you do, you never have to come back to my house. And\nof course, you have to understand, he had been \u2014 what he had gone through, between\nthe jail and the \u2014 and Les Milles and Gurs, there were part of his \u2014 part of his brain\ndidn\u2019t like the French, because they hadn\u2019t been nice to him.",
        "Q: They hadn\u2019t been.",
        "A: They hadn\u2019t been.",
        "Q: They hadn\u2019t.",
        "A: And so I understand that, but s \u2014 but I \u2014 I joined the army, basically right after I\nwas 18, and went to basic training, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and then they send\nme to \u2014I was a radio operator \u2014 they send me to radio school in Oklahoma for four\nmonths, because I was so good at that, they were going to use me. And then they\nsend me back to \u2014 then they assign me to an artillery outfit back in Fort Bragg,\nNorth Carolina. And that\u2019s when I decided enough was enough, this was stupid, the\narmy didn\u2019t know what it was doing, and I \u2014 I was fluent in French and German, I\nwasn\u2019t doing anybody any good in the South Pacific as \u2014 as a radio operator in a\nheavy artillery outfit. And so on \u2014 I \u2014 after Oklahoma they gave me a leave, on the\nway to North Carolina. And as only, you know, you have to be determined, but\nwhat could they do to me? I was a private, they couldn\u2019t demote me. So I \u2014 when I \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016\nI went to Washington, | got off the train, I went to the Pentagon, and I asked to\nspeak to somebody in intelligence, and I \u2014I got to si \u2014 it was the day after a holiday\n\u2014I got to see a lieutenant colonel who was very, very nice, and I told him my story,\ntold him what I just told you, and I said, you know, this is absolutely a waste in time.\nHe said, well \u2014 he went somewhere, then he came back, said well, you know, the \u2014\nthe boss isn\u2019t here today, he has the day off. But don\u2019t worry about it, Pll take care\nof it. And you just go to North Carolina, and just don\u2019t say anything to anybody,\njust do what you\u2019re told to do, and you\u2019ll hear from us. And boy did \u2014 he was as\ngood as his word.",
        "Q: How long did it take?",
        "A: Oh, four, six weeks at the most. I was on duty at night \u2014 duty, on guard duty at\nnight, and the first sergeant ne \u2014 had never paid any attention to me, came to my post\nin the middle of nowhere somewhere. And he said, Ho-Hockley, I \u2014 you gotta come\nwith me, I got a little place for you. I said, oh? I acted very innocent. And he said \u2014\nthen he said, well, we got classified orders from Washington that you have to leave\nright away. And of course, I knew what it was all about, but I didn\u2019t admit it. And so\nthen they shipped me to Camp Ritchie, Maryland. That\u2019s how I got to Camp\nRitchie, Maryland.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s pause for a few minute \u2014",
        "A: As aresult of \u2014\n134January 12, 2016",
        "Q: Of that visit.",
        "A: \u2014 that. I ha \u2014 one thing I want to interject is that they had a policy then \u2014 when I\nfinished basic training, which was in May of \u201944, as I finished basic training, I\nbecame an American citizen. There was a policy there that they wouldn\u2019t send you \u2014\nthey couldn\u2019t send you overseas, like Germany especially, if you weren\u2019t an\nAmerican citizen, because if the Germans caught you, they could string you up, you\nknow. Which, I wish they had that policy now, because they don\u2019t do it. They \u2014 they\nhave guys get who killed fighting for the United States that are not citizens, which\nis totally unacceptable in my book.",
        "Q: So when did you go from Hockenheimer to Hockley\u201d",
        "A: When I became a citizen.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: And that was before the su \u2014 the super \u2014 Superior court, Cumberland county,\nNorth Carolina. And there was an application that I wanted to change my name.\nBecause my nickname had always been Rudy, r-u-d-i or y, depending where I was \u2014\nI initially, and Y in France. They \u2014 which they pronounce, Ru-dee(ph). And I\ndecided, you know, I might as well change my name from Rudolf. Martin was the\nmiddle name, Martin Hockley. I mean hock \u2014 Rudolf Martin Hockenheimer to \u2014\nmy application was to Rudy Martin Hockley. And the judge looked down over his\nglasses at me and said, we can\u2019t have that. Rudy is a nickname. Take something\n135\nJanuary 12, 2016\nelse. And just like that, out of \u2014 you know, like there was something up there, you\nknow, I went like this, and I said okay, call me Ralph. This how major steps are\ntaken in life. But so I\u2014 in May of \u2014 of \u201944, I became an American citizen.",
        "Q: Ah, with as \u2014 and now known as Ralph.",
        "A: Martin Hockley.",
        "Q: Ralph mart \u2014 Martin Hockley. Okay, di \u2014 how do friends call you now, Ralph,\nRudy\u201d",
        "A: Depends. Until I married this woman, I was Ralph.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My first wife called me Ralph.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But Caroline doesn\u2019t like Ralph, and women have the tendency of not liking\nwhat other women \u2014 what for-former wives wanted. And so she decided I wasn\u2019t a\nRalph to her, and she calls me Rudy.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I can\u2019t pronounce either, so it doesn\u2019t make any difference.",
        "Q: Okay, so you\u2019re a citizen. May 1944, you\u2019re a citizen. You get these classified\norders, and you end up in Camp Ritchie. Tell us, what is Camp Ritchie?\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Camp Ritchie, Maryland was established, I believe in 1942, when they found\nthat the army in \u2014 in Europe \u2014 of course, we hadn\u2019t landed yet, but we were in\nNorth Africa, that they \u2014 that they needed linguists very bad. Do you mind if I \u2014 I \u2014\nI can lean my leg down here.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I\u2014 and so, they developed this forum, cal-called the intelligence training center,\nCamp Ritchie, Maryland, which is 65 miles north of Washington, and 65 miles\nwest of Baltimore.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: In the mountains up there. And they \u2014 they taught \u2014 well, languages you knew,\nbut they had all kinds of odd characters there, from PhDs to privates like me.\nAnybody who knew any languages, they \u2014 they got there, and they trained them in\nsuch things as prisoner of war interrogation, just military intelligence analysis, order\nof battle. Order of battle is try to get complete records of the organization of the\nenemy military, so that if you knew that the second Panzer division was coming at\nyou, you knew that the commanding general had to be so and so, and you n \u2014 you\nbuilt up records to know the weaknesses and the strengths of the commanders, and\nthings like that. And then the big one, prisoner of war interrogation was a very big\none. They they \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have training in all of those different topics?\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Not in all. Well, there\u2019s some ge-generalized yes, but specifically I was \u2014 well,\nthey first started me in French. They decided, you know, that came first. Germany\nwas afterwards. So they trained me in French MII, French Military Intelligence\nInterrogation. And then they \u2014 they shifted me to \u2014 when we didn\u2019t need people in\nFrance any more, they shifted me to \u2014 to German. And they \u2014 and then they \u2014 they\nput me through \u2014 yeah, first they \u2014 when the French was over, they put me in the\naerial photo interpretation, which didn\u2019t make any sense, because that\u2019s not what I\nwas there for. And so then they \u2014 they made me work in the officers\u2019 mess for \u2014 after\nI graduated the basic course, which is general in nature, they \u2014 they had me work in\nthe officers\u2019 mess for a few months. I\u2019m very good at pots and pans. And I \u2014 and\nthen they suddenly \u2014 somebody pushed a button and they say oh, but he knows\nGerman. [indecipherable] So they gave me a two week blitz course, we called it, in\n\u2014 in German interrogation stuff.",
        "Q: Was that different than French?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But just \u2014",
        "Q: It was in German.",
        "A: It was in German. And they \u2014 you know, they had \u2014 they had \u2014 on the post they\nhad \u2014 I forget what they were called, but they had an enemy force that they had, that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n138January 12, 2016\nwore German uniforms for the \u2014 us to recognize the uniforms, and the ranks and\nthings like that. The aggressor, it was called. And so they had some exercises where\nwe had to do certain things, they \u2014 they also send us out at night for a whole week,\nthrough Maryland and Pennsylvania pig farms, where if you went over the fence at\nnight, you stepped on a pig, and then it ran away squealing. And \u2014 and they \u2014 they\ngave us \u2014 they gave us a map, which was not in English, and they made us find our\nway back, which was interesting. But, so there was general kind of training of what\nyou might encounter in a combat situation. Then in \u2014 they \u2014 I\u2019ve \u2014 I stayed there\nforever, and March of \u201945, which was two months before the end of the war, they\nfinally shipped us overseas, and \u2014",
        "Q: Before we go there, a question at two different periods of time. Before you joined\nthe army, you said you were \u2014 you were very engaged, and wanted to know what\nwas going on, you \u2014 you know, your \u2014 your mind was over with the people who\nwere in Europe, who were under threat, and who were suffering. And so, were \u2014\nwas there news of what was happening to the Jews? Was there re \u2014 were there\nreports of what was going on?",
        "A: Well, we knew what was going on, but the question of at what point we knew\nabout death camps \u2014",
        "Q: And deportations to them, yeah.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 well, we knew about deportation, but not necessarily that when they got there \u2014\nI mean, there were Frenchmen, when the \u2014 in \u201942, when the Germans took over all of\nFrance, a lot of Frenchmen were shipped to \u2014 not Jew \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 just Frenchmen \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 were shipped to Germany for \u2014 to \u2014 labor forces.",
        "Q: Forced labor.",
        "A: Forced labor.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they were put in the factories, and all kinds of places to carry out the \u2014 just\nabout anything. So that was known, and there \u2014 there also was an element in France\nthat cooperated with \u2014 with the \u2014 the Nazis, that they had some kind of function, the\n[indecipherable] in France, they were not very nice people. But I cannot tell you of\n\u2014I cannot tell you when exactly we learned about death camps. We knew all about\nconcentration camps, and how bad they were, and all that, but the angle of when it\nbecame really known that they were gassing people, I\u2014 I\u2014I can\u2019t tell you from my\npersonal knowledge. There \u2014 there were \u2014",
        "Q: I mean like when you knew. I guess it\u2019s when you knew.\n140January 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, well, we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t \u2014 well, we knew \u2014 we knew in \u201942, for\nexample, at the latter part of 42, that my Aunt Clara(ph) and Annie(ph), my cousin,\nwere deported from Gurs to \u2014",
        "Q: Somewhere.",
        "A: \u2014 somewhere.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But, the detail of where to, and what it was like there, that they were being killed,\nthat, at that point, was not known.",
        "Q: In your training in Camp Ritchie, was any kind of \u2014 you know, was any kind of\nnews, from what was going on in Germany, part of the training? News that you\nwouldn\u2019t read in the \u201cNew York Times.\u201d",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because the training was all from military. What do you do to defeat the German\nmilitary.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That was the focus.",
        "Q: Okay. So let\u2019s go back. Remind me again, when did you go over? When were\nyou shipped over?",
        "A: In March of \u201945.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: Forty-five. All right, so two months le \u2014 are left of di \u2014 for the war. Where were\nyou first sent?",
        "A: Well, the ship \u2014 the ship docked in Scotland, and they put \u2014 we were \u2014 went on\nthe Ile de France, which was the largest ship floating around, which outraced any\nsubmarine, so that we went without escort. And we never saw the ship until we got\noff it. It was so big, they made us go in the side of the hold in New York, and you\nnever saw where you are in this thing. You couldn\u2019t see the front or the back of it.\nBut once we got off in \u2014 in Scotland \u2014 come back \u2014 then you could see the whole\nship, and then they se \u2014 put us on the train, and they took us to Southampton, all the\nway down to the bottom. And then they took us over to France. And in France they\nfirst send us to some replacement depot for a short time. And then \u2014I was \u2014 I and my\ngroup of people, there were a few of us, were sent to a villa outside of Paris, in Le\nV\u00e9sinet, which was, for Europe, the \u2014 the intelligence assignment center. And I was\n\u2014 I was picked up from there by a colonel who was part of the staff of the Bremen\nport command. They were planning to open the port of Bremerhaven for allied\ntroops, when the war was over. And so that\u2019s where that started. I was in Paris \u2014 I\nmean, you know, that\u2019s not \u2014 that wasn\u2019t my plan, but I was in Paris on \u2014 on eight\nMay, *45 \u2014",
        "Q: No kidding.\n142\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 when the war ended, and you know \u2014 when the punishment for being in Paris\non eight of May \u00b045, and you were in American uniform, and you walked down the\nChamps Elys\u00e9e, I got caught in a \u2014 it\u2019s just funny \u2014 I got caught in a circle of\nFrench women, with a lieutenant colonel of the air force, who was 23 years old, and\nthe two of us could only escape after we kissed them all. I mean, what duty \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, what a punishment.",
        "A: \u2014 what duty. But then immediately thereafter, I guide \u2014 I guided a bunch to go up\nto \u2014 to Bremen, because I spoke French and German.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And that was the purpose of that exercise.",
        "Q: So was this the \u2014 when you went there, that\u2019s the first time you\u2019re back on\nGerman soil, for a decade.",
        "A: About \u2014 about 10 th \u2014 yeah, about \u2014 about a decade. Probably 11 years. I\u2014I got\nthere about the 10\" of May, \u201945.",
        "Q: So, do you recall any kind of feelings that were running through you at that time,\nor were there \u2014 was it, I got a job, I\u2019m gonna go do this job, and \u2014",
        "A: Interesting question. I had feelings. I hated all Germans at the point \u2014 at that\npoint. Germany was basically on its knees. It was 65 percent destroyed in most\nplaces, not in all places, but we drove up to Bremen, all the way through Germany,\nwest \u2014 West Germany. And every city we came to was as flat as a pancake. In order\nJanuary 12, 2016\nto get a truck to get through Kassel, Germany, you had to have a bulldozer in front\nof you to push the rubble aside, so that the truck could go through. And Bremen wa\n\u2014 we went to, was 65 percent destroyed. And the Germans that were there, they\nkicked them out of the houses, so they could house us. And I don\u2019t know where they\nwent. Some \u2014 sometimes they stayed in the basement. But the \u2014 I \u2014 my motto was to\nkeep my distance. They had a fraternization \u2014 non-fraternization order that you\ncouldn\u2019t associate socially with G.I.s, which didn\u2019t last very long. The order lasted,\nbut the factual part of it didn\u2019t last very long. And \u2014 but I personally, you know,\nthere are a few things that happened that \u2014 or some \u2014 I was pretty well known,\nbecause every German that worked for us had to go ba \u2014 past me to get a security\nclearance, and se-security pass. So everybody who worked for the Americans, knew\nme. And so they established a \u2014 we established for the G.I.s, you had to do\nsomething, in their spare time, whatever that was, they established a club called the\nShangri-La, and \u2014 which was \u2014 and you were permitted to take girls there, because\nthey had music, you could dance.",
        "Q: But you can\u2019t fraternize with them.",
        "A: Yeah. And I \u2014I was approached there by \u2014 it wasn\u2019t immediately, but a few\nmonths later by one young lady that knew me, and she came over to my table, and\nshe said \u2014 I don\u2019t know what she called me, Mr. Hockley, or Corporal Hockley \u2014 IJanuary 12, 2016\nwas a corporal by then. The \u2014 I noticed that you never sit with anybody else except\nG.I.s, and you don\u2019t dance, and so on.",
        "Q: In other words, you don\u2019t fraternize.",
        "A: And I said, look, I don\u2019t want to discuss it. I\u2014 I \u2014 my family \u2014 you know, there\nwas the whole story, my family was treated very badly by the Germans, and I don\u2019t \u2014\nI don\u2019t have to associate socially. And so she broke out in tears. Then her boyfriend\ncame over and \u2014 and chewed me out for making his girlfriend cry. But th \u2014 you\nknow, every German you met in 1945 had a cousin in the United States.",
        "Q: Is that so?",
        "A: The \u2014 that was the way of getting \u2014 there are a lot of people that fraternized, all\nthe way up the line. Not just the privates, and so on, the officers, too. It was a policy\ncondemned to failure. But for me, it was fine. I didn\u2019t go there to become friends\nwith anybody. I was very fair in everything I did. I didn\u2019t mistreat anybody, I just\ndid my job, and that was it. But I didn\u2019t want to \u2014 there\u2019s no way that I could socially\nbe active with Germans, if I didn\u2019t know who they were. And that \u2014",
        "Q: What was your job? Besa \u2014 you said you had to \u2014",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 they had to clear \u2014 you were the first point of security?",
        "A: Well, the first thing is the colonel \u2014 the colonel that picked me up was the fellow\nin charge of intelligence for the Bremen port command. So he was the G2\nJanuary 12, 2016\nintelligence officer, and I was on his staff. And the intelligence office had to issue\nsecurity passes, as much as you could check anybody. We had a big headquarters\nthat was in the middle of town. The air force didn\u2019t bomb it, so we\u2019d have a nice\nplace to stay. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true, by the way, and \u2014 because everything else was flat,\nexcept this wonderful building \u2014 it became our headquarters. And so everybody that\nworked in that headquarters, because we needed German \u2014 we couldn\u2019t do\neverything ourselves, we needed clerical staff, and so on. We, in our office, we had\nno German clerks, because it was security. But everybody else did. And so our office\nwas \u2014 had the job of \u2014 of getting them the passes. Since I was the only person in the\noffice who spoke German, it\u2019s \u2014 I was the contact guy. And they also \u2014 they send me\nup to Bremerhaven for a couple weeks to \u2014 to handle the security office at the \u2014 at\nthe port up there. And I did that for, I would say until October, give or take. And\nthen, I had, at Ritchie, I had the \u2014 Ritchie was a weird place. When you finished\nyour course \u2014 I was in the 24\" class, if that\u2019s of any interest \u2014 that up to the 24\"\nclass, when you graduated from Ritchie, you \u2014 they either prom \u2014 they promoted\nyou to corporal, sergeant, or second lieutenant. And they promoted me to nothing.\nStarting with the 24\" class, no more promotions. So, what they \u2014 they took some\npeople, and \u2014 who wanted to be officers, and they sent them \u2014 they send them to\nFort Benning, Georgia, on \u2014 to take the quick course, the 90 day wonder \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow if you ever heard that expression \u2014 the \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: I have something similar, but I don\u2019t remember it \u2014 the \u2014 what it was called. It\u2019s\nsomething \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, 90 day wonder. They \u2014 they \u2014 they take these guys, they send them to Fort\nBenning, make them infantry officers in 90 days, which usually it took six months,\nor whatever. And so you could go from Ritchie to Benning to become a 90 day\nwonder, and then come back as a second lieutenant, they had that, too. With the 24\"\nclass, because of the \u2014 how far the war had progressed, they didn\u2019t do that any more.\nSo I went in the war as a private. But then, once I was over there, they \u2014 they \u2014 well,\nthey promoted me to corporal, and I \u2014 I had also applied at Ritchie to join the\ncounter-intelligence corps, because that\u2019s what I wanted. I wanted to catch Nazis.\nThat\u2019s what they were doing. But they told me I was too young, so I didn\u2019t get into\nthe CIC, you had to be older. But then, once I was in Bremen, and I applied again to\nget into the counter-intelligence corps, and they accepted me. So, in the last six\nmonths I was over there, I became a special agent of the counter-intelligence corps,\nno insignia of rank, just two U.S.s, so that you could go to see some colonel, and\nchew him about what somebody in his outfit was doing, and without him knowing\nwhat your rank was, even though if you were 20 years old, they knew that you\nweren\u2019t a general. So, I sa \u2014I\u2014I did that. And it\u2019s actually as a result of that, that I \u2014\nultimately when I was in Syracuse University, I got a commission military\nintelligence, because the gentleman that \u2014 before I left, when my time wa \u2014 came to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n147January 12, 2016\ngo home, I was interviewed by a colonel from intelligence headquarters in the\nStates, asked me if I wouldn\u2019t stay as a warrant officer, or as an officer. And I said\nno, I\u2014I \u2014I\u2019d like to, but I\u2014 I \u2014I want to go to college, I got to finish college, that\u2019s\nmy first thing. But when I was at Syracuse in \u00b048, I got a letter from the same\ncolonel, he didn\u2019t know the c \u2014 the con \u2014 the connection, but he said, we\u2019re\ninterested, if you would like to become a second lieutenant, military intelligence\nreserve, and he gave me the conditions. And you had to have been a staff sergeant,\nwhen I was a sergeant, which is one rank below the staff sergeant. So I wrote him\nback and I say, well, colonel, I appreciate, but I\u2019m only a sergeant, I\u2019m not a staff\nsergeant, so I don\u2019t qualify. But, if you are interested in knowing whether you think\nthat I am qualified, if you\u2019re the same Colonel Stevens that came to Bremen,\nGermany and interviewed me in \u201946, and asked me to accept a commission, then\nyou must know that I am qualified, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have interviewed me.\nAnd he send me the same paper back, handwritten on there, I\u2019m the same guy, you\u2019ll\nhear from me. And about three or four weeks later, I got a handwritten note from\nhim, and says, apply under army regulation so and so, so and so. I did, and within six\nmonths I was a second lieutenant, military intelligence reserve.",
        "Q: I see. I see, so that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the progression of \u2014 of your career, and \u2014 and \u2014 and\ngoing up in rank.",
        "A: Yeah.January 12, 2016",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back still to Bremerhaven. Did you take part in any denazification\nprocesses?",
        "A: Oh yeah. It was lots of fun.",
        "Q: Tell me, what was involved with that?",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 they had \u2014 they had the allies put out a \u2014 an order at the end of the\nwar, they \u2014 they had \u2014 first of all, they had an automatic arrest category, that meant if\na German, a Nazi was more than something in the Nazi movement, it required that if\nyou found him, that you arrest him.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 and then they had a category of the next ones down were \u2014 they couldn\u2019t\nget certain jobs. And then you do \u2014 there were the ones that you exonerated, and so\nthe CIC had the job of denazification. They had to \u2014 they got all the records of\npeople who applied for \u2014 for something, or that came across our \u2014 for one thing,\nacross our path, and they had to have them fill out the famous fragebogen, which\nevery German had to fill out, in which he said, you know, where he had been, when,\nwhere he went to school, did he join the Nazi party, didn\u2019t he join the Nazi party,\nand etcetera.",
        "Q: And did most of them ever, never join the Nazi party [indecipherable]\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Well, most of them joined the Nazi party, but they were unimportant. They were\nnot functionaries, they were just members, because they had to maintain their job, or\nsomething. There\u2019s some truth to that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: A\u2014a-\u20141if you wanted to be a teacher, probably, you had to be a member of the\nparty. Now, that da \u2014 didn\u2019t mean how \u2014 how active you were or not, you just \u2014 it\nwas just a ticket that you had to punch. There are people who never did it, and\nsurvived, but it just depended how much they \u2014 they trusted the system, or they\nneeded to eat. So they were not all \u2014 if they joined the Nazi party, they \u2014 we\ndetermined they weren\u2019t all bad people. We \u2014 we found all kinds of people, you\nknow, it \u2014 it \u2014 you never quite knew what was going to hit you next. There are two\nthings I might mention, wi \u2014 part of that period. I \u2014 they \u2014 my office was right next\nto the jail there, we had a jail, American jail. And \u2014 which a friend of mine was the\ncommandant. And so I \u2014 I went to that jail all the time, to interrogate people. And\nsomebody brought to my attention that there was a guy \u2014 denunciation was the order\nof the day. I devised my own questionnaire, and then I made people fill out that were\nbrought into my office. And I made them fill that out before I would talk to them.\nAnd the first question was, what\u2019s your name, date of birth, and profession. And who\n\u2014 who do you want to talk to me about? And if the guy was a butcher, and he wanted\n150January 12, 2016\nto talk to me about a butcher, I knew that he was trying to get the competition out of\nthe way.",
        "Q: That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s very clever, you know, because didn\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s an ugly thing \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 denunciation. It \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, it \u2014 it was a big deal. Because people had nothing, so they \u2014 they used\ndenunciation in order to get themselves in a better position. So \u2014 but there was this\none guy, I found out \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I was given a tip, there was a guy who was\nthere, and he was \u2014 had the rank of so and so, which made him part of your\nautomatic arrest category. And so \u2014 but then \u2014 then I \u2014 yeah, so I \u2014 he had just been\nreleased from our prison. So I figured out that they didn\u2019t know who he was, so they\nreleased him. So, I decided to arrest him. But being a nice guy, I decided that he\u2019d\nbeen in jail for, I don\u2019t know how long, and he was spending the night with his\ngirlfriend, so I decided, well, let him have one night, and a \u2014 they had a curfew, from\nsi\u2014 10 in the \u2014 10 in the evening til six in the morning. So I\u2014 we didn\u2019t do the\narresting ourselves, we charged the German police with that. So I gave orders to\nhave him arrested at 5:30. And \u2014 and they brought him to the prison, and then they\nbrought him over to my office. And in the meantime I found out \u2014 I didn\u2019t find out at\nfirst, but I found out that he had \u2014 we had had him, and we released him. And I say,\nJanuary 12, 2016\nwell, there\u2019s something wrong here. So I\u2014 I said to myself, how do I address this?\nWe released him yesterday, and \u2014",
        "Q: We\u2019re re-arresting him now.",
        "A: \u2014 we\u2019re re-arresting him. And so, when he came in my office, I mean, I never\nforgot this, because up to this point, nobody had ever said to me that they had been a\nNazi of any consequence. And this guy, when he walked in, he sat down in my\noffice. The first question I ask him \u2014 don\u2019t ask me why, I \u2014 you know, you do things\nin life, you don\u2019t know why you do them. You think you know why you do them. I\nsaid to him, until when were you a Nazi? I did this because of the information I had\nin front of me. And his answer was, oh, I\u2019m still a Nazi. And I have to tell you, I\nalmost fell off my chair, because nobody had ever said they were a Nazi, you know\u2019?\nAnd so I said, oh, I said to myself, well that\u2019s interesting, I gotta \u2014 this one I want to\nhear. And he was there, I had him in there about two, three hours. I just wanted to \u2014 I\nwanted to figure this out, what \u2014 what\u2019s the deal? And he told me, you know, I can\nspare you the details, but he told me that \u2014 that hit] \u2014 what Hitler wanted for\nGermany was important because the Germans needed a leader, they needed a\nfuehrer to lead them, etcetera, but he made mistakes, like he should never have\ntouched the Jews, and a few other things like that, and \u2014 but, in principle he still be-\nbelieved in the philosophical principle of the fuehrer, the leader running the country,\nthe people don\u2019t know, otherwise, what to do.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "Q: They need a strong hand.",
        "A: And so, I finally, you know, I remanded him to prison, because it said on paper\nthat I had to, but \u2014",
        "Q: Did you learn anything from him?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I th \u2014 I learned a lot from him. That there\u2019s one person in Germany that\nwas honest. There were others who were. And then, I mentioned before that the \u2014 the\nthing, the other thing that I found fascinating is that we \u2014 we were involved in \u2014 you\nknow, there were all kinds of stories about there are still Nazis around, and we have\nto watch them, you can\u2019t \u2014 you know, if you drive down the street in a Jeep, they\u2019re\nliable to shoot at you, or kill you, or put up a wire. The \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether you\neven noticed, but the Jeeps all had a \u2014 a metal rod in the front of the \u2014 of the hood,\nand if you were driving down the street, 1f somebody put a wire across the street, the\n\u2014 this thing would cut the wire, so it wouldn\u2019t kill you. Otherwise, because you\ncouldn\u2019t put the roof down, the darn thing would decapitate you. And so they \u2014 they",
        "Q: Were there such instances?",
        "A: If there were, they were so far, that \u2014 you know.",
        "Q: But this was anticipation. In case.",

They \u2014 they\n\u2014 there \u2014 so there was the story that the Hitler youth \u2014 and this was, I think, inquiry,\ninvestigation, that the Hitler youth still had a hard core of Hitler youth, who were\nwaiting for the moment to \u2014 and you talked about werewolves. Well, we \u2014 we got a\ntip that there was a \u2014 in \u2014 in our area, there was a farmhouse which was headquarters\nfor these guys.",
        "Q: So they \u2014 known that they were called the werewolves, or something?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what the legend called them.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: And [Il tell you a few words about that, in a \u2014 afterwards, we\u2019ll \u2014 so we went out\nthere, and we \u2014 because the Germans kept such good records, you know, we went to\nthe \u2014 to this farmhouse to arrest some of these guys. Well, there was only one guy\nthere. And so we went through the farmhouse, but we found all the records of the\nHitler youth for the whole northern Germany, and we, of course, took them with us.\nAnd we left the guy alone, we figured he \u2014 with the \u2014 we had gotten enough out of\nthis deal. And ba \u2014 the bottom line was, there was no resistance to speak of. These\nwere guys who were dreamers, and they had been set up, you know, before Hitler\ncollapsed, they say well, when \u2014 if we give up, we will fight to the end, you know,\nbut there was nobody to fight to the end. We totally dis \u2014 if there was anything\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n154January 12, 2016\nstrong, we disarmed them, and that was the end of that. I\u2019m saying this because it\u2019s\nvery interesting today, because Secretary Rice \u2014 what\u2019s her first name? Condoleezza\nRice made a famous speech, Iraq connection, that the \u2014 that the terrorists in Iraq\nwere just like the werewolves in Germany. And I had that thrown at me at a couple\nof conferences I attended, or gave, and \u2014 and you know, I never make anybody feel\nbad in public, but I went to color \u2014 to Camp Carson, Colorado, and some si \u2014\ncommand sergeant major just back from Iraq made this speech, and yes, there \u2014\nthere are the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the terrorists in Iraq is like the werewolves in Germany,\nand when it was over, I took him aside and said, look, Command Sergeant Major,\nthere were no werewolves in Germany. I can tell you, I was there, and I was\ninvolved in this. And there was a co \u2014 marine colonel at a meeting in Houston, came\nup with the werewolves, the \u2014 the guys in Iraq being like the werewolves, and I\nsaid, it\u2019s just \u2014 let me stand up here and tell you, it\u2019s a damn lie. There were no\nwerewolves in Germany. | have the only book that was ever written about the\nwerewolves. There was one guy, who killed the mayor of Aachen, Germany, in \u2014\nbefore the war was over, and he was called a werewolf. And after that, there were no\nwerewolves. So it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a legend, that this existed. So, I\u2019m still alive to tell that\nthe history is being misused.",
        "Q: But a fascinating footnote, because it would be something that, you know, is a\nlogical question. The war is just lost, this had been such a powerful enemy, a\nJanuary 12, 2016\nthorough enemy, and a ruthless enemy. And \u2014 and one could expect resistance. It\nwouldn\u2019t be out of the realms of, you know, possibility.",
        "A: Germany was so destroyed. They were \u2014 the people had nothing to eat, the\nsurvival was the only thing that they had going for them. And the women were made\nto clean up all the \u2014",

        "Q: You have \u2014 you know, you \u2014 I\u2019m going to step aside a little bit here. I mean, you\nhave a history and experience that is so unique, with German Jews, who escaped,\nleft, fled. You know, whatever verb we would choose, who left Germany, and then\ncame back. There are some, but very few, who came back to have such thorough\nknowledge of the country in their postwar years. Yours starts now, right after World\nWar II, but then later goes on to have a \u2014 a career in \u2014 in intelligence with the\nAmericans, for several decades. What did \u2014 what did you learn in those decades? I\nmean, there has to be a process, through which a \u2014 a human being goes, when they \u2014\nand \u2014 or they see someone they love, like their father, who suffered so much from\nthe hands of a system, that was adopted by a country. Was there a time in this\nprocess where your feelings and your thoughts about Germany changed?January 12, 2016",
        "A: Well, my initial reaction \u2014 initial initial, in Bremen, was exemplified by the\nfollowing; I walked down the street in Bremen one day, and there was a man\nbeating his kid. And I was in American uniform. And I walked up to him and said,\nstop it. We\u2019re bringing democracy to you, in a democracy you don\u2019t beat your kid on\nthe street. That was my immediate reaction. How do you get to the Germans? How\ndo you get them away from this business of \u2014 of punishment, of \u2014 of beating, of\nharshness, and so on? So, all I could do at that moment was that. Gradually, the\nyoung generation, you \u2014 you know, there \u2014 you had to wait for a while. Germany\nwas rebuilt amazingly fast, thanks to the Marshall Plan, and many other things. And\nthe Germans are, undoubtedly, very astute, and \u2014 what\u2019s the word I\u2019m trying to think\nof \u2014 people. They \u2014 they work very hard, to this day. There are always exceptions,\nbut generally speaking. They\u2019re well organized, they \u2014 they keep their nose to the\nerindstone, and \u2014 and they were lucky with the initial governments they got, you \u2014\nyou know, when you get a Konrad Adenauer, who was no pansy, who \u2014 who \u2014\nwho ran Germany pretty harshly, but that built everything up, and then he was\nfollowed by Erhard to fix the economy, and then of course, you had Willy Brandt,\nwho was a socialist, and brought a lot of social things to Germany. They \u2014 they had\nsome very good leaders. I can\u2019t think of one chancellor of Germany that was really\nbad. They had a couple of presidents, but presidents don\u2019t matter. They\u2019re \u2014 they\nwere figureheads, like the queen of England. It\u2019s the chancellors who run the show.\nJanuary 12, 2016\nSo, gradually the young generations there, they went through all kinds of stuff. The\nuniversities tended to be very liberal, to use a kind word. And so a lot of the students\ngot pretty left-wingish. But gradually, this stuff was drummed into them, what it is\nlike to be in democracy, and what \u2014 what happened is they \u2014 they \u2014 because there\u2019s\nbeen such a tremendous change in the way the world operates, that all they want \u2014\nthe young people want to do is go \u2014 come to America, or France, or \u2014 you know,\nthey been \u2014 they were locked up in Germany, they couldn\u2019t get out of Germany,\nunder Hitler. And so it \u2014 suddenly, there was some freedom of travel, and they saw\nthat there were other societies, that weren\u2019t as bad as they were made out to be. And\nthe people went to Brittany on vacation, instead of staying in Germany, saw that it\nwas nice in Brittany, or wherever they went. Half of Germany\u2019s been to \u2014 to the\nCanary Islands, and to Spain, because \u2014 because they love the sun, primarily, but\nthat\u2019s another \u2014 another world down there. So they \u2014 they \u2014 they passed a\nconstitution, which is very democracy oriented, and they have a Supreme Court that\nis enforcing it. And it\u2019s not always to our liking, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. I \u2014I\nalways try to take people for who \u2014 the individual qualities, and what they were like,\nand their \u2014 I said, I met a lot of nice people. There are a lot of nice people in\nGermany. There are certain things that \u2014 at \u2014 at my farewell party, by the German \u2014\nby the BND, the German CIA.",

        "A: The \u2014I was asked the question, would you consider retiring in Germany? And \u2014\nand you know, I didn\u2019t want to be impolite, so I thought about it for 10 seconds, and\nI said, no, I \u2014 no, I would not retire in Germany. I said, I will visit Germany and\nFrance, which are my main two countries of interest, as frequently as possible, but I\nw\u2014I\u2014lTmacitizen of the United States, and as a citizen of United States, I only\nfeel free, totally free, in the United States. For example, in Germany, if you\u2019re a\nforeigner, you have to have \u2014 you have to go to the Einwohnermeldeamt, which is\na registry office, you had to \u2014 well, you have to let them know where you are. In the\nu\u2014in\u2014in Germany and France, you may not be able to get employment, because\nthey are protecting the young people from the old people, and they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 as\na matter of fact, they kick you out of work when you\u2019re 50 or something, so that you\nhave \u2014 they have jobs for the young people. So, in the United States, there\u2019s only\none thing that can keep you \u2014 that they can go after you for. It\u2019s that \u2014 you can have\nfive jobs at the same time, as long as you pay your income tax, you\u2019re always \u2014\nyou\u2019re home free. That\u2019s the only thing they\u2019ll ever get after you. No police\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016\nauthority is going to go after you for anything else, except that. And \u2014 and I \u2014 for me\nto live, I need that freedom. And so they were satisfied, I hope.",

        "A: Yeah, you \u2014 you know. There are good people everywhere. I know some good\npeople everywhere. I know some bad people everywhere too, but \u2014",
        "Q: But from that I extrapolate that \u2014 that despite your deep knowledge, there was\nstill something always there \u2014 no, this is not my place any more. This is \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it ever was, but \u2014 because as a kid, as a small kid, you don\u2019t know\nwhere \u2014 you know.",
        "Q: Yeah. Could it \u2014 hang on a second. Now, how \u2014 I want to turn the question\naround a little bit. Have you met other German Jews who left Germany, and never\nwent back, because they wouldn\u2019t go back. It\u2019s a choice. And, have you shared with\nthem what you think, or what you learned when you were there in the post-war\nyears? Or, let me put it this way, what would you tell such people, about the\nGermany you came to know?",
        "A: Well, one of the things I came ta \u2014 would tell them is that, of course, my situation\nwas different, because \u2014 because I was there as a United States government\nrepresentative. I did not live in Germany as an American living in Germany, I lived\nin Germany as a government representative of the United States. And so, all of my\nrelations were based on that. If a policeman would stop me on the street, there\u2019s\nJanuary 12, 2016\nnothing he could do to me, because I had a semi-diplomatic passport. They have a\nstatus between the private passport, and the diplomatic passport, and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s called\na official passport? Do you remember what it\u2019s called? Official passport. And I had\none of those. And you know, therefore I never f\u2014 I was never dependent on the\nGerman economy. I used it, but I was never dependent on it.",

But I was never \u2014 I was never in the\nposition that a person would have been who was not with the government, who was\na German Jew, and went back a-as a private person, and reintegrated in a German\nsystem. I was not dependent on the German health system, the German anything. So,\nyou know, to answer you \u2014 the first part of your question, I know a lot of people who\nnever went back. I also know some people who went back and liked it, but they were\nthere only as visitors, and some people who said they wouldn\u2019t \u2014 [phone ringing]",
        "Q: Let\u2019s cut. [break] Okay, who \u2014",
        "A: The \u2014 the \u2014 lot of people that said they would never go back. My Uncle Charlie\nHeiman(ph), he did go back, because he had lots of friends there, and he liked to go\nin Munich to have a sausage and a \u2014 and a beer, and you know, so he went back, but\njust as a tourist, and to see old p \u2014 go to the cemetery. Lot of people have gone back\nto take care of the cemeteries, of their parents, or family, whatever. I \u2014 oh, on \u2014 I \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n161January 12, 2016\nyou might want to check this out. I have a cousin \u2014 I had a cousin, who died within\nthe last few months. Her name is Ruth Hockley. Ruth Hockley was married to my\ncousin Frank, who was one of my first cousins, and Ruth Hockley is the only\nperson that I\u2019ve ever known, who spent the entire war in ger \u2014 in Berlin, and\nsurvived. And she\u2019s been interviewed by the \u2014 her son told me that she\u2019s been\ninterviewed by you. And \u2014 and she must have a \u2014 it might be an interesting story,\nbecause there are very few people who survived. Her mother\u2019s name was\nHeynemann, h-e-y-n-e-m-a \u2014 double n. That\u2019s her maiden name. And so \u2014 but she\nnever went back. I mean, having spent the entire war in Berlin, that was enough for\nanybody.

And I \u2014 I asked her son recently,\nafter she passed away, I said, the \u2014 is there a story, what\u2019s the story, you know, how\ndid she survive? And she was interviewed by the Holocaust Museum, and he doesn\u2019t\nknow the answer, but you apparently have the answer somewhere. It would be nice\nto \u2014 to know that story.

        "Q: And I was going at it from the point of view that in that position, you had such an\nopportunity to learn more than the average person would, about this country, from a\nvery wide perspective. So \u2014",
        "A: I went \u2014 I went occasionally \u2014 I went occasionally to a German synagogue.",

We first went \u2014 we were from\nAlameda cal \u2014 from Alameda county, from Oakland, California, and we went to\nOakland and say, can we arrange for him to be Bar Mitzvah? And my wife was\nreasonably religious. Not overly religious, but ch \u2014 and they gave her such a hard\ntime \u2014 oh, you have to do this, you have to do that, and you know, I finally said,\nyeah, I guess you guys don\u2019t want us in Oakland, California. They couldn\u2019t be\nbothered, in the synagogue where she and I got married. And so I said well, we\u2019ll do\nit in Bonn, it'll be a great favor to them. Because there\u2019s hardly anybody in\nGermany who is Bar Mitzvah any more. As a matter of fact, in the year that he was\nBar Mitzvah, there were only two; him, and the son of the Israeli ambassador, and\nthat was it. And so it was a big deal. And this lady was there. We were neighbors, we\nlived in the same apartment house at the embassy, and they had just moved in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016\nrecently, and we invited her to \u2014 to come to this, since she was a neighbor.

        "A: \u2014 all of Germany, and was, for a long time, only West Germany. They\u2019ve made\na tremendous effort to \u2014 to \u2014 generally speaking, to atone, if you wish, for what they\ndid to millions of people. Jews, but not only Jews.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: A lot of others. And there are really not enough people left. You\u2019re going through\nthis cycle right now where Mrs. Merkel is letting in a million refugees, which my\nanalysis would tell me that it\u2019s a mistake. But she \u2014 she \u2014 it 1s bigger than what she\npredicted. She did it in the spirit of \u2014 of making up for Germany\u2019s name in the past.\nOf course, she was born in East Germany, and she didn\u2019t come to Germany until\nafter the wall came down, and it became one Germany. She\u2019s probably very good at\nher job, but in this case, I would, as a former intelligence official, I would say that\ntaking in a million Muslims, or foreigners \u2014 doesn\u2019t have to be Muslims \u2014 at one\ntime, is something which a democracy can\u2019t handle. It\u2019s just sheer numbers. You\nhave to be able \u2014 you \u2014 if you charge your \u2014 your security officials,\ncounterintelligence officials, with keeping the country safe, you can\u2019t expect them to\nhandle a hundred thousand people at once. You know, it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s an\noverwhelming task. If you do it slowly, that\u2019s a different thing.

You\nprobably remember them, you were there. The Baader-Meinhof Gang was very\ndangerous, and when people talk about terrorists in the Middle East, for example, I\nalways \u2014 my answer always is, look, Germany is a very well organized country,\nfrom the point of view of police, and security services. My guess is \u2014 I didn\u2019t count\nthem individually, but my guess is, because I was involved in it, that there were\nabout 30 members in the Baader-Meinhof Gang. They were absolute nuts. You \u2014 I\nread their manifesto, I didn\u2019t understand a word of it. I mean, they were so way out,\nyou know, it didn\u2019t make any sense. They killed people. They killed bankers, they\ntried to kill the commander of the American forces in Europe with a mortar shell,\nwhen he went to work in the morning. They, for the sake of \u2014 were they Nihilists? I\ndon\u2019t know. They were \u2014 they were crackpots. But it took the German intelligence\nservices approximately 10 years to catch \u2014 catch them one by one. Ten years for 30\nguys. If you assume that in the Middle East, you have one-tenth of one percent of\nbad guys \u2014 Iraq was 27 million, that\u2019s 27,000.

Before we get to\nthe actual donation materials, I did want to ask Mr. Hockley to talk a little bit about\nthis photograph. This is a \u2014 a printout of a blown-up photograph. There\u2019s actually a\nthird photograph that goes here, and I didn\u2019t have that. But I wanted to give him the\nopportunity to talk about anybody in the photograph, this is from the Quaker staff in\nFrance, in 1940, correct? I just wanted to give him the chance to talk about people.\nAll the names are identified in his book, so we don\u2019t have to identify everyone, but\nthere are a couple of people that I know that you had mentioned to me, in passing,\nand I wanted to make sure that were \u2014 were recorded.

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He was a man on a mission. He was afraid of nobody. He went to see Marshal\nP\u00e9tain several times, to plead for the children of \u2014 under his tutelage, 1f you wish.\nHe didn\u2019t take no for an answer, he was not afraid of authority. He was an American,\nhe was a wealthy American, and \u2014 though he lived very Spartan life. To s \u2014\nunderline that, he never drank coffee, he didn\u2019t drink tea, he didn\u2019t drink anything\nlike Coke. My mother occasionally would come in in the afternoon and \u2014 and make\nhot water for him, with sugar. He would have, in the afternoon, a cup or two of hot\nwat \u2014 hot water with sugar, and he would have a piece of toast with it, that my\nmother prepared for him. And he got to be 98, I think, and for years I didn\u2019t drink\nany coffee, because if Howard Kirschner got to be 98 by that kind of a diet \u2014 they\ndid not eat rich food, of any kind, he and his wife. He was a \u2014 as I said, the best way\n171January 12, 2016\nto say it is, he was a man with a mission, and he had he had a large staff all over\nEurope. He had to keep track of many operations, and from what I could see as a\nkid, he did it with great flair and ability, and \u2014 and dedication, would be the word. I\nsaw him a number of times, years later, when he was not \u2014 I \u2014 I believe he may have\nhad a falling out with the Quakers.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: On -\u2014 on authority, or something. Whether this had anything to do with it, I don\u2019t\nknow, but he \u2014 when I saw him in later years, he was a \u2014 working for religious,\nphilosophical organizations, and \u2014 but he was always doing good things for other\npeople.",

And in this picture here \u2014 in this picture, which 1s in the\nbook, this is him.

You know, there was not \u2014 I told you, there was nothing to eat, and the\n175\nJanuary 12, 2016\nQuakers didn\u2019t pay me, but they had food that they gave out. And every once in a\nwhile they \u2014 they would give me a piece of Swiss cheese about this big, to take\nhome, or a big container of honey. Stuff that had some good, strong nutrients in\nthem, and \u2014 which was worth a \u2014 more than anything you could buy in the store,\nwhich didn\u2019t have in the first place, but Blickenstaff was nice. These la \u2014 I knew\nthem all, but I \u2014 this is Miss Leaven(ph). She was a very effective lady. This is Mrs.\nBurnell(ph). She is the wife of \u2014 of him.

        "A: I mean, they \u2014 they \u2014 they did stuff. Everything they did was legal, but they\nobviously, some of them \u2014 and you never knew who, but some of them, in order to\ndo what they had to do, they had to make side agreements with \u2014 just like \u2014 like\nVarian Fry. You know, he \u2014 he\u2019d go down and negotiate a deal with the guy who\nowned the boat, in order to get somebody from point A to point B, you had to take\ncertain steps \u2014 and I\u2019m sure there were a few people in there that the word legal was\n\u2014 I mean, what did it mean in occupied France, or in \u2014 in Vichy, France, if you had\nto reach a certain goal, you had to do what it took to get to the goal, which didn\u2019t\nmake it not illegal, but on a margin, you know. It\u2019s like Hiram Bingham meeting\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n176January 12, 2016\nwith Varian Fry in the mountains, to discuss how to get Feuchtwanger, or \u2014 or\nChagall or somebody out of \u2014 out of France, you know, that was these side deals.",

        "Q: Of course, of course.",
        "Q: Live and let live, huh?",
        "Q: It\u2019s an interesting example. Can we cut for just a second? [break] So you \u2014\nyou\u2019ve kind of described to me that many of your father\u2019s relatives who were still in\nGermany, got to Gurs \u2014 were transported to Gurs \u2014 deported to Gurs. Can you tell\nme what their fates were? Did all of them make it out of Gurs, or did some of them\nnot?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Heart attack, I think you said.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "Q: Before we get there \u2014 before we get to the American consulate, I want to find out\na little bit more about the office. You know, you mentioned a number of people; the\nlocal French hire Dr. Chalmers, I think, yes, the Kirschners. How large was the\noffice in general? How many employees did it have, approximately?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: And were most of the \u2014 aside from the secretary who \u2014 the receptionist, were\nmost everybody American?",
        "Q: Were they all Quaker?",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me \u2014 you mentioned earlier that you found them remarkable. What\nwas \u2014 what were \u2014 what were some of the things that struck you that way, about the\nQuakers?January 12, 2016",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Did they talk \u2014 would they respond to the first statement, or would they then say\ntheir own?",
        "Q: I\u2014I-\u2014Td like to understand \u2014 make sure that I understand it better.\nQ2: Now might be a good time to pause for lunch.",
        "Q: I\u2014I\u2014I know, but I want to finish this one question, is \u2014 if it\u2019s possible. Okay.\nWhen somebody would say something, and they finished, would then there be a\ndiscussion from others, that would revolve around that topic, or \u2014 or not?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: That\u2019s one of the question \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, okay. Let\u2019s pause here, and we\u2019ll come back. Thank you.",
        "Q: Thank you very \u2014 [break] Okay, before the break, we were talking about your\nwork, the work that you were starting to \u2014 to do with the Quaker organization in\nMarseilles, and how you ended up working with Dr. Chalmers. And tell me now\nhow that developed, and what \u2014 how it took you from their offices to the offices of\nthe U.S. consulate in Marseilles. Describe that to me.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Can you describe the consulate building physically, like you did the Quaker\nbuilding, next to Hotel Splendide? What did \u2014 where was it, and so \u2014",
        "Q: So there was no \u2014 it wasn\u2019t such that it was a building that had a yard around it,\nand then a wall, or a gate, and you were \u2014",
        "Q: No, it was actually a building \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And did the U.S. consulate have the entire building to itself, or only certain\nfloors?",
        "Q: The whole building?",
        "Q: And about how li\u2014 how many stories did it have?",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "Q: Did you have a sense of how many \u2014 how large a place it was, how many people\nworked there, at the time?",
        "Q: Okay. Again, to \u2014 for \u2014 for me to be able to get a picture of this, there are people\nwho are standing outside with a line winding around a square, or you know, they\u2019re\nwaiting for a long time. And \u2014 and if they\u2019re coming on their own to see \u2014 to find out\nthe status of their application. When you go in, do you go to the same window that\nthey would go, except that yours is streamlined, that is you are able to not have to\nwait in line? Or, is it that you don\u2019t have to stand by a window, you\u2019re actually\nadmitted to a place beyond a counter, that normal people wouldn\u2019t be able to get to?",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "Q: So around the \u2014 around the perimeter.",
        "Q: Was there anybody else from the consular office in the room at the time?",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: But nevertheless though, I mean, these are important files \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 you know, and very vital to the people who are requesting.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you that.",
        "Q: Now, when your family put together your request, who did you approach to be\nyour sponsors in the United States?",
        "Q: So, I mean \u2014 I mean \u2014 of course, Eleanor Roosevelt was not part of the \u2014\nformally a part of the U.S. government. However, as the wife of the president, she\u2019s\nclearly has interests that are in contradiction to Mr. Hull, you know \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 at the State department.",
        "Q: So it sounds \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Now, wasn\u2019t that risking getting into a lot of hot water?",
        "Q: Within the government, or \u2014",
        "Q: So he did pay a stiff price.",
        "Q: Did you have interaction with him?",
        "Q: But I want to stop right here. I can\u2019t imagine what you must have felt like when\nyou heard those words. I mean, out of so many years of uncertainty.",
        "Q: How did she \u2014 how did she react when you told her?",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "Q: Sometimes that\u2019s lucky.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Maybe they rolled it up.",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: In a frame?",

        "Q: How lovely.",
        "Q: But what did they look like?",
        "Q: Pirates?",
        "Q: Well, so what flag was the Winnipeg flying under?",
        "Q: But what a footnote. I mean, everything that we know about World War II is that\nthe French, and the British were allies. And here \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay. These were Vichy \u2014",
        "Q: A Vichy ship.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Was it?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. So what happened to you when you were in Trinidad? How did things\ndevelop?",
        "Q: Really.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Other side.",
        "Q: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: But from that \u2014 from that point of \u2014 of \u2014 of risk, of getting from the small boat\ninto there, you go into air conditioned spaces, with white gloves and silverware, and\nfirst class, and all of that.",
        "Q: My God, what an adventure.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: They had a swimming pool?",
        "Q: And just a question, that painting must have been spent \u2014 sent other ways. I can\u2019t\nimagine you bringing a painting on a boat, a little boat, going up to the Uruguay.",
        "Q: Same way?",
        "Q: Yeah. How could you get a big \u2014",
        "Q: I mean, but how would you go from a small boat to the \u2014 anyway, it\u2019s just a\ndetail.",
        "Q: What was it like when you got to New York? What did you see?",
        "Q: I\u2019m talking about the harbor. Did you see Lady Liberty?",
        "Q: Home. Safety.",
        "Q: Well, I think this is a point where it\u2019s the right point to take a break. Thank you.",
        "Q: Okay. [break] So, you come into New York harbor, and you\u2019re met by family,\nrelatives there. Tell me how \u2014 what happened then. Where did you folks go, where\ndid you settle?",

        "Q: Did you see \u2014",
        "Q: Did you see yourself at that point, as no more German, but now French? Or did\nyou know \u2014 did you have time to have questions of who am I, what \u2014 what is my\nidentity?",
        "Q: You were French, okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Did you sign up, were you drafted? How did that occur?",

Before you joined\nthe army, you said you were \u2014 you were very engaged, and wanted to know what\nwas going on, you \u2014 you know, your \u2014 your mind was over with the people who\nwere in Europe, who were under threat, and who were suffering.

        "Q: In your training in Camp Ritchie, was any kind of \u2014 you know, was any kind of\nnews, from what was going on in Germany, part of the training? News that you\nwouldn\u2019t read in the \u201cNew York Times.\u201d",
        "Q: Okay.",

I mean, you\nhave a history and experience that is so unique, with German Jews, who escaped,\nleft, fled. You know, whatever verb we would choose, who left Germany, and then\ncame back. There are some, but very few, who came back to have such thorough\nknowledge of the country in their postwar years. Yours starts now, right after World\nWar II, but then later goes on to have a \u2014 a career in \u2014 in intelligence with the\nAmericans, for several decades. What did \u2014 what did you learn in those decades? I\nmean, there has to be a process, through which a \u2014 a human being goes, when they \u2014\nand \u2014 or they see someone they love, like their father, who suffered so much from\nthe hands of a system, that was adopted by a country. Was there a time in this\nprocess where your feelings and your thoughts about Germany changed?January 12, 2016",

        "Q: Yeah. Could it \u2014 hang on a second. Now, how \u2014 I want to turn the question\naround a little bit. Have you met other German Jews who left Germany, and never\nwent back, because they wouldn\u2019t go back. It\u2019s a choice. And, have you shared with\nthem what you think, or what you learned when you were there in the post-war\nyears? Or, let me put it this way, what would you tell such people, about the\nGermany you came to know?",
        "Q: There\u2019s a difference there.",

Something\nthat you would want, you know, your interview to contain, for others to also find that\n\u2014 find out about?",

Before we get to\nthe actual donation materials, I did want to ask Mr. Hockley to talk a little bit about\nthis photograph. This is a \u2014 a printout of a blown-up photograph. There\u2019s actually a\nthird photograph that goes here, and I didn\u2019t have that. But I wanted to give him the\nopportunity to talk about anybody in the photograph, this is from the Quaker staff in\nFrance, in 1940, correct? I just wanted to give him the chance to talk about people.\nAll the names are identified in his book, so we don\u2019t have to identify everyone, but\nthere are a couple of people that I know that you had mentioned to me, in passing,\nand I wanted to make sure that were \u2014 were recorded.

So that was a big change there. They all were born in small towns, but they all\nwound up in big cities. And that had to do with the government attitude, and so on.\nThey \u2014 there are a lot of little things you find out, you \u2014 for example, until the 1850\n\u2014 60s, children had Jewish first names.

And one of them, her father, I believe, when he came to Germany, he \u2014\nthey \u2014 they all had a business together in Hamburg, in Germany, and they ha \u2014\nFrankel is a pretty German name. And so he\u2019s \u2014 his \u2014 his fr \u2014 his first name when he\nwas born was Moses, and he changed it, in Germany, he changed it to Moritz(ph).\nSo in Germany, he was called Moritz(ph). And in 19 na \u2014 1920 \u2014 and I don\u2019t quite\nunderstand it, but I\u2019d have to study a lot of history to figure it out, but in 1920 he \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016\nhe wanted to go from Hamburg to Solingen, which is in what we now call North\nRhine-Westphalia \u2014",

And \u2014 1920, and \u2014 and he answered Polish.\nAnd \u2014 and printed on the form it said, and what was it before 1919? Because World\nWar I stopped in \u201918, what was \u2014 an \u2014 an-and then before \u2014 so, a year before, his\nnationality was Austro-Hungarian.

And I\nhappened to be very interested in fa \u2014 I always knew everybody. To this day, I can\ntell you what somebody looked like. But about their childhood, about my father\u2019s\nchildhood, I know absolutely nothing. I have a sister, Diane, who is a year older than\nI am, and she is a PhD from Berkeley, and very into social work, and I \u2014\noccasionally I consult with her, to find out whether she remembers. There are things\nthat she remembers differently than I do. But I know a lot more about the family\nthan \u2014 than she does. That was not part of her sphere of interest. On \u2014 so on my\nfather\u2019s side of the family, I knew \u2014 I knew unc \u2014 aunts and uncles as a child, just up\nto the time I was eight or nine. As a\u2014 on my mother\u2019s side of the family, I knew the\nfamily, cause as children, we spent every summer in Bavaria with my grandparents,\nand particularly with my mother\u2019s sisters kids, who were the same age we were.\nJanuary 12, 2016",

        "A: My \u2014 my grandfather was born in 1857, my grandmother was born in 1876, so\nshe was basically 20 years younger than he was. So, when we, as children, got to see\nhim, that was a big deal. We \u2014 he was an \u2014 already an old man. In those days, you\nknow, if you figure it out, he was 57; in 1900, he was 43; and in 1930, he was 73.\nWhen we knew him, he was at least 70 years old. My grandmother wasn\u2019t, but he\nwas. He had a \u2014 with his brothers, he had a ladies haberdashery store, a big one, in\nMunich, right one block from the bahnhof. And as kids, we were permitted to go\nthere, there was a building with two stories. The hats were made upstairs, not in\nChina. And \u2014 and we \u2014 we could watch them make the hats, and the thing that\nfascinated us is they had a \u2014 they had a dumbwaiter, or whatever you call the tubes.",
        "A: They had a tube, so all of the \u2014 the \u2014 the accounting department was upstairs.",
        "A: So somebody bought a hat, they pa \u2014 they gave the money, they got a bill, and\ngave the money to the salesperson, and it was put in the tube, and they took care of it\nupstairs.",

        "A: Children are seen, but not heard. Which is totally against everything that we\nbelieve in, because we f-figure that kids learn from talking with their parents, not the\nopposite. But in those days \u2014 now, what I have to add is that my grandparents had a\nmaid, the cook, everything goes with it. And the maid, Lena, was in charge of the\nJanuary 12, 2016\nkids when they came to visit, and my \u2014 my \u2014 my aunt and uncle \u2014 Elsa(ph), the older\nsister, lived around the corner. My \u2014 my grandparents had a big apartment. If you\u2019ve\never been to Munich, it\u2019s one block from the \u2014 from the Oktoberfest, from the\nTheresienwiese.",
        "A: That\u2019s where they lived. And my grandfather\u2019s brother lived in the building next\ndoor. And my aunt and uncle, now they lived in apartment houses, very nice\napartment houses where a floor was big. My aunt and uncle, Elsa(ph), and her\nhusband Karl(ph) Heiman(ph), they lived around the corner, they had a big villa.\nAnd so, as kids, we spent a lot of time over there, because their kids were the same\nage as we were, approximately. But when we got to Munich, to \u2014 with my\ngrandparents, Lena was in charge of us. Lena took us places, and \u2014 and then, you\nknow, my \u2014 my grandmother, I don\u2019t know what she did, but she worked in the store\nwith my grandfather. And they came home, you know, they come home for lunch,\nand they have a big lunch, the main meal, and then they take a nap. And then, I still\nhave that problem, when I eat, I always have to go to sleep. So don\u2019t feed me too\nsoon. They \u2014 we were permitted to stay up until my grandparents came home, about\n7:30, eight. We could spend 10 minutes with my grandparents, and then pff, off to\nbed we went.

        "A: Well, the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, from a sociological point of view, what this means is,\nbecause they had a maid and a cook, that meant that the parents had time for other\nthings.",

        "A: Coal oven, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and then upstairs were the bedrooms, and then there was another floor\nabove, that had its own access to this little apartment, presumably for the maid, but\nour maids all came in. We had mainly one maid, she did everything. She raised my\nsister and me, and her name was Sophie, and she cooked. And the thing that I\nlearned, you know \u2014 you don\u2019t know yet \u2014 but I spent 25 years in Germany as an\nintelligence officer for the U.S. government. And because of my position, I had vil \u2014\nvillas, and they \u2014 in Berlin, and in \u2014 in Munich, I had similar houses. And the one\nJanuary 12, 2016\nthing that absolutely floored me, was that the kitchens were all abysmal. The\nkitchens were \u2014 I mean, they were small. All of them, every single one. In Berlin, in\nMunich, the \u2014 the \u2014 the kitchens and \u2014 and the one I \u2014 I \u2014 I grew up in, as a child,\nthey were all a postage stamp.

But\nyou couldn\u2019t enlarge it, there was no space, but you could change stove, and a few\nother things, you know, because it just wasn\u2019t functional according to our concept. I\nhad the good luck that the houses I lived in in Germany in my career were owned\nby the German government, and all I had to do is pick up the telephone, call the\nAmerican engineers, military engineers, and say hey, I need this and this, and it\ncame.",

The \u2014 on Redtenbacherstrasse, about two or three houses down, there was\na family, and his name was Peitken(ph), and they had two boys, and the older one\nwas my sister\u2019s age, and the younger one was my age. That mean \u2014 meant that the\nolder one was in the same grade as my sister, and I was \u2014 and the younger ones was\nin my class. And they were friends of ours. The younger one, Gurz(ph), was in my\ngrade. The minute the Hitler movement started, he became turned, and he wouldn\u2019tJanuary 12, 2016\nwant to play with me any more, and he called me a dirty Jew, and a few other things.\nThe older one always \u2014",
        "A: No, of course not. The older one never did that. He always remained friendly. But\nthere were, in my class of, I\u2019m guessing 25 kids, there were four Jewish boys. I was\none of four, and my sister was about the same. At the beginning, we had no problem\nat all, but once Hitler came to power, it became immediately \u2014 anybody who tells\nyou that actions against the Jews in Germany started with Kristallnacht is \u2014\ndoesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. It started right from the \u2014 the first,\nimmediately, in *33.",
        "A: Oh yeah, they started \u2014 every morning they had to raise the swastika flag, and\nthey had to sing the \u2014 the \u2014 the Nazi national anthem, the Horst-Wessel-Lied, you\nknow. De file \u2014 I can sing it for you, you know.",
        "A: Well, I can \u2014I get \u2014 I know the words for the Horst-Wessel-Lied because we had\nto sing it every morning. And then, you know, the first year, I don\u2019t remember who\nmy teacher was the first year. It may have been the same one, but I don\u2019t remember\nthat. The second year, I had a guy by the name of Meininger(ph), who turned out to\nJanuary 12, 2016\nbe the head of the Nazi party in the area. And so, he took every opportunity to make\nsnide remarks about the \u2014 the Jewish kids. And \u2014",
        "A: Oh, he was \u2014 and you know, my sister always laughs about it, but she always\nlucked out. Her \u2014 her teacher was the nicest guy in the world, always. And I always\ngot these \u2014 these \u2014 you know, this \u2014 this was a tough age. I mean, you know, I was\nwhat, seven years old, eight years old, seven years old. And if you did anything\nwrong, you know \u2014 he had a stick, and you had to stick your hand out, and he went \u2014\nyou know, and it burned. And you know, he wasn\u2019t careful with Jewish kids, I mean,\nthere\u2019s all these little, more than innuendoes. It was picked on, you know, and there\nwith watch \u2014 they would watch us. We had to salute, or something, when the flag\nwas raised every morning, and they would watch us. And if \u2014 if the Meininger(ph)\nfelt like \u2014 like it, he said well, you didn\u2019t stand at attention when we were playing\nthe Horst-Wessel-Lied. Stuff like that. All this little stuff, you know.",

        "A: My mother was \u2014 tended to be. She grew up in Munich, in the Jewish youth\nmovement, she was a leader in a Jewish youth movement in Munich.",
        "A: My dad couldn\u2019t \u2014 get away farther from religion than he possibly could. The\nonly time he ever went in a synagogue 1s when he married my mother, and that was\nthe first and the last time.",
        "A: I think the answer to your question is no. Unfortunately, my sister and I have\noften bemoaned the fact that we never found out anything about Dad, about th \u2014\nwell, he died young, too, so the years when you would have done that, maybe, but\nwe could have found out something when he was young. We only know tidbits about\nhim. He \u2014 our impression is that there was this \u2014 there were a lot of Jews in\nGermany that wanted so badly to be German, that they \u2014 being Jewish was \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, or at least you ignored it. Now, he married my mother, and \u2014 in a Jewish\nwedding, that \u2014 but it was \u2014 it was an arranged wedding, so that \u2014",
        "A: Well, my mother \u2014 you know, I\u2019ve read some of this stuff with \u2014 earlier heirs. My\nmother belonged to a generation that was not subserv \u2014 where the wim \u2014 as a\nwoman, she was not subservient to men, which was a new thing.",
        "A: And she had her own \u2014 she was well educated, better than her siblings. My father\nwas educated better than his siblings, and I think that was the common denominator.\nThey both went to the university \u2014 Mother went to hohertesteschule(ph). I don\u2019t\nknow how to translate that.",
        "A: It\u2019s a\u20141t\u2019s a\u2014 well, it\u2019s above \u2014 it\u2019s above high school.",
        "A: It\u2019s not university, but it\u2019s for \u2014 for girls from families that had the money to send\nthem to another school, they \u2014 they \u2014 they did. And she was \u2014 she was very well\neducated. But my father served for four years in the German army, in World War I.\nGot the Iron Cross, and the whole deal.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Yes. And that\u2019s something that has not writ \u2014 been written about \u2014 enough, about\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the pre-war, pre-Hitler Germany, but th-there were a lot of them who\nwere patriots. He was very proud to have served in the German army. And that\u2019s one\nof the reasons why so \u2014 and then Hitler came, in \u201933, and immediately, Jews were\nscum. And my father, who was a man of great integrity, he \u2014 he couldn\u2019t accept that.\nAnd that\u2019s why he left. He left in \u2014 he started leaving in 34, it took two years to do\nthe whole move.",
        "A: Yes, especially if you just finished serving four years, risking your life \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for the country that\u2019s doing it to you.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: \u2014 but I think that the reason we went to France is because of that. That all of his\nrelatives, on both sides of the family, said [speaks other language] you know, all\nthis will go away. Hitler won\u2019t last, the others didn\u2019t. And so they didn\u2019t leave. And\nso my father, I guess argued with himself that if he went t-to France, when it\u2019s all\nover, he can come back.",
        "A: Yeah. So he didn\u2019t \u2014 th-the consideration of going to the United States, at that\nparticular time, if it came up for discussion, I never heard it.",
        "A: So I don\u2019t think it did. So we went to France. Whereas, on his side of the family,\neverybody stayed. They were \u2014 well, I\u2019ll tell you a little bit about his family, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the \u2014 on my mother\u2019s side, the \u2014 the leader, kind of, in Mother\u2019s side of the\nfamily was her sister al \u2014 Elsa\u2019s husband, Karl(ph) Heiman(ph), who was veryJanuary 12, 2016\nwealthy, had a big textile business, and he knew everybody in government, and\nelsewhere. And, you know, they kind of pooh-poohed the fact that dad wanted to\nleave Germany.",
        "A: It\u2019s hard to answer. It\u2019s probably both. I \u2014 he was hurt. He had quote unquote,\nloyal customers for years, butchers mainly, who one day when he, or his\nrepresentative walked in to see him, said we don\u2019t do business with dirty Jews.",
        "A: And so, you know, you only need to hear that a few times before you \u2014 before\nyou say hey, do I have to put up with this?",
        "A: So it was \u2014 but the fact that he had been in the military for four years during the\nwar, definitely played into it, because his \u2014 his brothers \u2014 well, one of them was in\nthe military, I don\u2019t know much about that, but an-and his \u2014 on my mother\u2019s side of\nthe family, nobody was ever close to that. And you know, there\u2019s lots been written,\nIve read a lot. I have a book written by a German, at the request of the German\nMinister of Defense, that\u2019s in my f \u2014 later life, and \u2014 which explains what being a\nJew in\u2014 in Germany was like in 1914, when the Kaiser said \u2014 when the Kaiser said\nto the Germans, you must all come fight with me for the \u2014 so on. The Jews \u2014 th-theJanuary 12, 2016\ngrand rabbi in Berlin, and I got his words, I got his sermon, had a \u2014 had a service in\nwhich he said, we Jews must \u2014 we must answer the call of the Kaiser. The grand\nrabbi of Berlin. So that was the frame of mind.",
        "A: And that was the frame of mind of many German Jews.",
        "A: Well, my mother had a never-ending social conscience. She \u2014 all of her life she\nwas always doing things for other people. She started as a student in Munich. She\nwas the head of the Jewish youth, and I \u2014 I have some letters in my documents,\nwhere the \u2014 the \u2014 the council of Jewish \u2014 the Jewish congregation sent her a letter\nthanking her for having led the effort during the elections, and without her, it never\nwould have happened. She was like this all her life, as I will explain to you later.\nWithout that kind of consciousness, I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here. But my dad was very\nintelligent. He was mainly, in the years that I knew him, he was mainly consumed in\nmaking a living, which became ever more difficult in Germany, because of what I\nsaid. And then when he went to France, nothing really worked.",
        "A: Yeah.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Mother.",
        "A: Yeah. My father favored my sister over me, but my sister, we have a strain in the\nfamily, of petite woman, my sister had that strain. My father had a sister who was\npetite, and my \u2014 my grandmother, whom I never knew, my father\u2019s mother, was very\npetite. I think that\u2019s where the line is.",
        "A: Then my Aunt Josephine was like that. My sister is four foot 10, maybe.",
        "A: And \u2014 and so she always was pale, and my father always protected her, so that \u2014\nyou know, and I was just the boy.",
        "A: It\u2019s all right, it didn\u2019t bother me. You know, I did my own thing, but it just \u2014 so\nmy father was more \u2014 I don\u2019t think she talked that much more with him than I did.\nYou know, in those days, fathers would say to you, are you doing your homework,\nas he went whizzing through the room. And it was just that kind of a world.",
        "A: Mother was concerned with all of the things we did.January 12, 2016",
        "A: That was her job.",
        "A: No. I\u2014 what led up to it, what I said before, let\u2019s start 1t from the beginning. We\nwitnessed a number of things happening \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 around us.",
        "A: The one \u2014 for example, they arrested Jews from the beginning. I mean, in 1933,\nthe people who were judges, and university professors, and in charge of the opera, at\nany position, who were Jewish, were out of a job. And they arrested people. There\nwas a family that we were friendly with, he \u2014 he was the Minister of Justice of \u2014 of\nwhatever it was then, Baden? It was in Baden-Wiurttemberg then. But \u2014 and he\nwas a socialist, and so he ha \u2014 and he was Jewish. So he had three strikes against\nhim, and he got arrested in the first bunch, and what they did, they put them on open\ntrucks, and they drove them through the city of Karlsruhe, so that people could spit\nat them.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, they were the Brownshirts. The SS, we didn\u2019t see, but the Brownshirts,\nthere was Brownshirts all over the place. And they were just, you know, and they\nhad signs, Juden raus, whatever. Whatever one through the ages I\u2019ve seen, they had\nit. And \u2014 and \u2014 and the people on these trucks went to a concentration camp that\nyou\u2019ve never heard of before, and I can\u2019t remember. But \u2014",
        "A: Local, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. So it started from the beginning.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Not that I remember, because it didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think they started before \u00b035.",
        "A: Maybe even later. But they did arrest people they didn\u2019t like. Hitler didn\u2019t \u2014\nHitler didn\u2019t like, I don\u2019t know in what order, trade unionists, socialists, Jews,\nFreemasons, har \u2014 I hardly believe anybody knew what a Freemason was, but you\nknow, it sounded good.January 12, 2016",
        "A: He didn\u2019t like them. And so, if you were on any of these lists, or if you were on\ntwo lists, heaven forbid, you know. Then Catholics. He had a big war going on with\nthe Catholic church in certain places, certain times.",
        "A: I have no idea. It was a mistake that he was born.",
        "A: The \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 I mean, when you think about the psychology of it, the \u2014 Hitler\nwas a little guy with dark hair, a brown mustache, and he said that to be a good\nGerman, you had to be blonde and blue eyed. Now where \u2014 how does he fit into this\nthing, you know? So that people fell for this, that is unbelievable, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: They don\u2019t have logic, yeah.",
        "A: Not really. PIl tell you why. I said before that we left in \u201934, \u201935, and that\u2019s a true\nstatement. We left, step by step, it wasn\u2019t that we left.",
        "A: The kids, that means my sister and I, were first sent to Munich.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: With \u2014 actually with my aunt and uncle, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 same thing. Around the corner.",
        "A: The ones who didn\u2019t want to leave. And well, in those days you didn\u2019t talk that\nmuch about it, but that \u2014 you know, we were just sent to Munich, or taken to\nMunich, I guess, my mother took us. And we stayed with my aunt and uncle and\ntheir three kids, I would say, for three or four months. And \u2014 and that was in 734.\nMaybe the fall of \u201934 \u2014 I \u2014 the fall of \u201934. After school \u2014 there was no school. The\nnew school year was starting, but it was at the end of \u201934. And then, after that, we\nwere shipped from there \u2014 shipped to \u2014 to Mannheim, to stay with my father\u2019s\noldest brother, and his wife. We stayed with them for three or four months. And then\nwe were sent to Switzerland. My father had a sister in the Zurich area, and her\nhusband was a teacher out in the country. And we were sent there for three or four\nmonths. And we stayed with them on a farm.",
        "A: It sounds like \u201cHeidi.\u201d We were on a farm, and I\u2014 I was \u2014 I didn\u2019t go to school\nthat whole year, and I was \u2014 I would go out every morning with the farmer, who\nowned the farm, a \u2014 out in the fields, and where they put hay together, and I was\nJanuary 12, 2016\npermitted to feed the cows, and stuff like that, you know. It was a new world for me.\nAnd so the whole thing, that \u2014 that Munich, Mannheim, Switzerland, that was\nabout a year.",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were setting up \u2014 they were taking care of the formalities\nrequired to move to France. I can\u2019t tell you where they lived at the time, whether\nthey \u2014 probably partially in Germany, and partially in \u2014 in F-France, but they\nweren\u2019t anywhere where we were. They came every once in a while to see us, of\ncourse.",
        "A: But so it \u2014 it\u2019s in September of \u201935, that we left Switzerland, and moved to\nMarseilles.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I assume he sold it, but I \u2014 they \u2014 they didn\u2019t take things away from you yet, at\nthat time.",

        "A: Well, they tried to teach us a little French in Mannheim, so that we wouldn\u2019t be\ntotally lost. And the one sentence I can remember is the, La boeuf - der Ochs, la\nvache - die kuh, ferm\u00e9 la porte \u2014 mach tir it zu.\nJanuary 12, 2016",

But we didn\u2019t know much French, but so they decided they \u2014 the powers\nthat be \u2014 that means my father and mother, decided to send us to private school.\nNow, you have to remember, in those days \u2014 I don\u2019t know how it is today, but in\nthose days, boys and girls never went to school together.

        "A: No.",
        "A: Just \u2014 I was sent to a thing called [speaks French], it was a private school, not\ntoo far from where we lived. My sister went to a thing called [speaks French] which\nwas in a different direction, but about the same distance. And we were there to learn\nFrench. And I was there, I would say, two semesters, to learn French, and then both\nof us transferred to the lyc\u00e9e. I went to the boys\u2019 lyc\u00e9e, when I was 10, I guess. I\nwent to the boys\u2019 lyc\u00e9e, and she went to the girls\u2019 lyc\u00e9e. Mine was called\nSanshal(ph), but it was not religious, it was public.

        "A: I had no problem.",
        "A: I did well in \u2014 in [speaks French], you know, I can show you the report cards.\nAnd then went to lyc\u00e9e, and I \u2014 the classes weren\u2019t that big. I would say about 20. I\ncan count that for you, but it was about 20, maybe a little more. And I started in what\n\u2014 you know, in France, the \u2014 it goes the other way. The neuvi\u00e9me, the ninth grade 1s\n\u2014 is \u2014 or dixi\u00e9me, 10\" grade is for little kids, and it goes down to one, which is for\n17, 18 years old.",

        "A: \u2014 1n the \u2014 1n the ninth grade, and by \u2014 by the time I was in the eighth grade, in\nhuiti\u00e9me, you know, you \u2014 you had to take exams, and everything, in main subjects,\nJanuary 12, 2016\nand in huiti\u00e9me, there were subject French, Latin, mathematics, geography, history.\nAnd in huiti\u00e9me, which means I was in \u2014 in France two years, I got the first place in\nFrench. And did that cal \u2014 cause an upset in the school.",
        "A: I mean, the \u2014 the teacher \u2014 the teacher, who was very French, a lady teacher, she\nstood in front of the class, and she practically screamed at them. Said, a little\nGerman kid comes in here, and he has the first place in French? And, well, I had to\nwork harder, you know?",
        "A: For me it was always had to start from scratch, and I had to really put work into\nthis. The others, they just sat there and enjoyed themselves.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, yeah, I guess so, yeah.",
        "A: You know, there are other stories that I didn\u2019t \u2014 all my ki \u2014 my friends were, you\nknow, French kids. We were \u2014 we were all buddies. I mean, I\u2019ve \u2014 I met them until I\nwas over seven years old. The \u2014 the \u2014 we \u2014 lyc\u00e9e was kind of a protected society,January 12, 2016\nvery well organized, and you knew what you could do, and what you couldn\u2019t do,\nand you learned, and you had good teachers or bad teachers, like everywhere else.\nWe had mostly good teachers. And so, you know, I liked lyc\u00e9e very much. So did\nmy sister. My sister was the top student in her lyc\u00e9e.",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we were \u2014 rented an apartment, which we kept the entire time, in a\nmiddle class neighborhood.",
        "A: There were certain things that were primitive. Like we lived on the top floor of\nfive stories, and no elevators or anything like this. The bathroom had a tub, but no\nhot water. And it was \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, it was falling off the mountain. It was a step down, but as kids you don\u2019t\nrealize it. Our parents saw to it that we had everything we needed. We never went\nhungry. We went to school, we had a regulated life, and we had friends.",
        "A: And even though for adults we were called German refugees, I guess, I don\u2019t\nthink any of them, or most of them didn\u2019t understand that \u2014 why we had come there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016\nSo, you know, when the war started, the \u2014 the \u2014 we had to impress people that we\nknew with the fact that we were much more at danger than they were. Because to\nthem, they were just Frenchmen. We were Germans who had left Germany because\nof Hitler.",
        "A: And so it \u2014 that was totally different thing, but \u2014",
        "A: There were some. We had some neighbors two houses down that were in the\nsame situation. Not too many.",
        "A: The \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 there were two \u2014 there were two aspects. One is, were there any\nother Jewish people \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 French Jews.",
        "A: And the other is, what about the German refugees? Now, the German refugees,\nthere were a number of them. Some of them were doctors, for example. Our doctor\nwas always somebody who was a German Jew. And even there, you have to split\nhairs, because a lot of them came from the Saarland. The Saarland was FrenchJanuary 12, 2016\nfrom World War I, until 1935 or six, when they had a plebiscite, and they opted to\ngo with Germany. And so the Jewish people in Saarland, when this happened,\nmoved into France because they\u2019d been living in France, and that was the natural\nthing. A lot of people from Saarland, who lived in France afterwards, after the\nSaar opted to go back to Germany.",
        "A: So, our doctor was one of those, and there were a number of people like that, but\nnot many. Now, the Jewish people, I suspected if my parents had been religious, they\ncould have become more active, but that was not my father\u2019s cup of tea. And my\nmother was always conciliatory. And she did take my sister and me to the services at\nthe Jewish synagogue, the main one \u2014 there were several \u2014 but the main one, for the\nhigh holidays.",
        "A: Just \u2014 just \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur.",
        "A: And \u2014 but otherwise we didn\u2019t. And the French Jews did not \u2014 any generalization\nis \u2014 is bad, but generally speaking, the French Jews were not particularly interested\nJanuary 12, 2016\nin German Jews. They were not nasty or anything, but they \u2014 they didn\u2019t understand\nthat we were all in the same boat, as it turned out to be later.",
        "A: But so, there was one family that was very nice. Well-known family that invited\nus, and stuff like that, but generally speaking, there was no effort on part of the \u2014 the\n\u2014 the French Jews in Marseilles for an outreach towards the Jews from other\ncountries that had showed up.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: All of my friends were not Jewish.",
        "A: Catholic mass?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: I know more abou-bout French Catholicism than I know about French\n[indecipherable]. I grew up, you know, in a world that was all \u2014 that\u2019s why some of\nJanuary 12, 2016\nthe things that happen in this country, I don\u2019t understand, because I grew up ina\nCatholic country.",
        "A: There \u2014 there was no \u2014 no challenge to the Catholic church. And the Catholic\nchurch in France is very subdued, but they\u2019re there.",
        "A: And you know, you \u2014 if you were Catholic, as my best friend was, anything we\ndid, like we became Boy Scouts.",
        "A: Anything that we did \u2014 if we left at seven o\u2019clock on Sunday morning to go\ncamping, or go out somewhere on the coast, or something, he\u2019d get up at four and go\nto mass. And \u2014 and \u2014 and at seven o\u2019clock, he was where he was supposed to be.\nNobody ever talked about the fact that he\u2019d gone to mass. If I hadn\u2019t known him so\nwell, I\u2014I wouldn\u2019t have known it. But, you know, that religion was a private part of\nyour life. And France to this day, you know, is very secular. I mean, very secular.\nThat \u2014 the \u2014 Dallas \u2014 you don\u2019t know this, but Dallas has a school called the Dallas\nInternational School, which the word international you can question, because it\u2019s\ntotally French. I mean, from the top guy down it\u2019s French, and they speak French,\nand the kids all know French, learn French, and so on. But it says on the \u2014 on a big\nsign, that this is a \u00e9cole laique, a lay school.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Secular school. Don\u2019t misunderstand, this is not a French Catholic school. This is\na secular school.",
        "A: It\u2019s the French constitution. Separation of church and state is in the French\nconstitution.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Now the French \u2014 French Catholics \u2014 like everything else in life, there are many\nexceptions, but the French Catholics are not super-religious. But they do get married\nin the church, and they \u2014 they go to the fu-funerals in the church, and the \u2014 there\u2019s\ncertain things that happen.",
        "A: Oh, because my friends were \u2014 were \u2014 were Catholic, and they took me along.\nWas interesting to find out what other people do.",
        "A: I never felt I was anything special, you know, I like to know how other people\nlive. If he\u2019s my best friend, I want to know what makes him tick, you know.",
        "A: And it \u2014 it was never a problem. You know, I didn\u2019t go every Sunday or anything\nlike that, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 if there was a special occasion.",
        "A: Had exposure.",
        "A: It was not a strange thing.",
        "A: I can tell you \u2014 this is a story you\u2019ve never heard, but \u2014",
        "A: The father of one of my best friends passed away, and they had the funeral in the\nchurch. And in the Catholic ceremony, in France, I don\u2019t know how it is here, the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the coffin is covered by a cloth, and it\u2019s in the middle \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 everybody is around it. And then, at a certain point in the ceremony, everybody\ngets the \u2014 what is a scepter, what is a li-little thing that the priest bless things with,\nyou know, one of these things. It\u2019s got a name.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: But, you know, and the priest will hand that to the person next to him, family\nfirst, and everybody stands around the coffin and, you know, you make the sign of\nthe cross. Well, you know, I was 10 years old. When that thing got to me, what do I\ndo now, you know? I was trying real hard to look at everybody else and wha \u2014\nwhat\u2019s going on here, you know\u2019?",
        "A: But, you learn that way, you know?",
        "A: Yeah. You know, Boy Scouts were Eclaireurs Unionistes de France. Now, you\nhad the main boy scouts in France are Catholic, ec \u2014 Scouts de France, Scouts of\nFrance, Catholic.",
        "A: Eclaireurs Unionistes de France were the Protestants scouts.",
        "A: They were organized by secular \u2014",
        "A: No, they were organized by some religious order.",
        "A: But they didn\u2019t ask you when you joined, what you were. And so the reason my\nfriend George, who lived next door, and I belonged to the \u2014 and he was a very\nJanuary 12, 2016\nstrong Catholic \u2014 why we belonged to the Eclaireurs Unionistes de France is\nbecause it was one block from our house. It was convenient.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: And there were also the Eclaireurs Israeli de France.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t choose to join them. They were on the other side of town anyway,\nthey were \u2014 would have been so complicated, that \u2014 you know.",
        "A: But, so I belonged to the \u2014 to the Protestant scouts. I \u2014 whatever, you know.",
        "A: In France?",
        "A: He tried to be an em \u2014 importer-exporter, as he was, in a way, before. He \u2014 he \u2014\nspecializing on sausage casings, that he knew everything about, and \u2014 and spices.\nAnd so he, again, dealt with butchers.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: But \u2014 and he did that. He must have made some money, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t\nhave eaten, or paid the rent. But the \u2014 the main problem was political, or\nadministrative, in a sense that the French police, the security \u2014 Siret\u00e9, that dealt\nwith foreigners, was totally unpredictable. You never knew. My parents had a\nresidence permit, I believe by the year. Every year they had to renew it. And so, I\u2019m\nguessing, in \u201937 or eight, probably closer to seven, but maybe somewhere at the end\nof seven, beginning of eight, he went on a business trip to the f \u2014 Swiss border, to\nBasel. And he was in Basel visiting clients, and then he said \u2014 he had a client over\non the other side.",
        "A: In Switzerland.",
        "A: But you know, Basel is right on the border.",
        "A: And it\u2019s parch \u2014 partially the suburbs. I mean, in France, in \u2014 the main city is.\nThe downtown is in Switzerland. And \u2014",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 the way it went is, he went to the border \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 where the \u2014 they had \u2014 if you ever tried to get into Switzerland, you know\nthat\u2019s a major job. They \u2014 he went to the border station at the French side, and asked\nthem whether he could go to Switzerland, to Basel, just to visit a client. And the\nguy in the \u2014 in the French custom house, or custom, or maybe immigration police,\nwhatever the p \u2014 the guy was, said, well you gotta go over there, and ask. So he went\nto the Swiss guy, on \u2014 you know, hundred feet, maybe. And he said, this is who I\nam, and I\u2019d like to visit a client. And so they accused him of having crossed the\nborder illegally.",
        "A: And so they didn\u2019t do much, except they made note of it. And then he went back\nto \u2014 and he did go over, but he went back to Marseilles, and from then on, in his\npolice record, it said in Marseilles that he crossed the border illegally. And that was\nadded to the following historic fact.",
        "A: That my mother and my dad were in Marseilles, I believe around the 20\" of\nOctober, 1934, to lay things out.",
        "A: And they \u2014 they were downtown. The king of Yugoslavia, Alexander the first,\ncame on a State visit, and he went in a motorcade down the \u2014 the Canebiere, which\nis the main street in Marseilles. And they were standing in front of \u2014 front of theJanuary 12, 2016\nstock exchange, and within, I don\u2019t know, a hundred feet of them, King Alexander\nwas shot by a Croatian terrorist, and the French foreign minister, Barthou, was\nwounded seriously. And because they were so worried about Alexander, they forgot\nabout Barthou, and he bled to death. And so Alexander was \u2014 King Alexander was\nkilled, and so was Barthou. And all of the foreigners who were in Marseilles on\nthat day, got put in a register. And when this thing \u2014 when the Swiss border came up,\nthere now were two facts against him. He was in Marseilles when the king of\nYugoslavia was assassinated, which he obviously had absolutely nothing to do with,\nbut he was there.",
        "A: And then he crossed the border into Switzerland illegally. And that haunted him\nfrom \u2014 from then on.",
        "A: And you know, in the French police, you had \u2014 you had good guys and bad guys,\nlike everywhere else, and so this was \u2014 so that was in \u00b034. In \u201937 \u2014 eight, he had that\nSwiss thing, and the \u2014 the next time they went to extend their \u2014 their \u2014 their \u2014 it may\n\u2014I don\u2019t know whether it was the next time, or the time afterwards, when they went\nto extend their annual \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 residence visa, they arrested them, both my parents, for being in France\nillegally. And \u2014",
        "A: Well, truth \u2014 truth di \u2014 truth is unimportant when somebody wants to do\nsomething who has police power.",
        "A: And so they kept my father, and they let my mother go because she had two\nchildren. I was about 12, 13, and my sister was 13, 14.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It was definitely before the war. And th-the strange thing about it \u2014 there are\nmany strange things about it, but one of them was that that particular afternoon, my\nsister and I had been invited to the home of one of her teachers for her son\u2019s birthday\nparty. And my sister was invited, and they let come along, because my parents had to\ngo to the police. And you know, and all the kids left, and my sister and I were there,\nand Mother didn\u2019t show up. And then ultimately she did show up. And she walked in\nthe door, and she said, they have arrested my husband. And it so happens that this\nteacher\u2019s husband was a high police official, and \u2014 which helped, because obviously\nthey knew who we were, they knew us and they were friendly. But nevertheless, my\nJanuary 12, 2016\nmother was out on temporary whatever, my dad was in jail. In jail, where they put\nhim in a cell with a \u2014 with a guy who killed a captain in the es \u2014 a guy who killed a\ncaptain in the French harbor. And they put my father in with him, because he was\nfrom Switzerland, they boy spoke German.",
        "A: You know, I mean a \u2014 it \u2014 the circumstances of \u2014 of some of these things 1s just\nunbelievable. So my dad was in jail, which I think did more to attack his health than\nanything else, because he was a \u2014 again, a man of great integrity. Now he\u2019s sitting in\na French jail. French jails are not known to be exactly nice places.",
        "A: And so after about a month \u2014 and I have no idea whether it was \u2014 it was quite a\nwhile. I don\u2019t know, it was four week, six weeks, whatever it was, they \u2014 they\nbrought him up for trial, and he was acquitted. So he came home. But he was very\nmuch taken by this. But my mother wasn\u2019t tried, hadn\u2019t been tried, because she was\na separate case, I guess. And so a little while later they \u2014 they tried her. And they\nfound her guilty. And so, really \u2014",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 they expelled her from France. And so you say, what do you do?\nWell, her sister, the sister from Munich, the wealthy people from Munich \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 they were \u2014 this was \u2014 this was just \u2014 it was after Kristallnacht \u2014 after Crystal\nNight in \u00b039.",
        "A: So they \u2014 they \u2014 she said, well I \u2014 if I\u2019m expelled from France, I can go see my\nsister in Paris, and she \u2014 she went to Paris, and then she came back, and then we\nchanged attorneys, and she appealed her expulsion. And she had a \u2014 now, a good\nattorney, and she was acquitted by the Court of Appeals. But you can imagine, you\ngo through this exercise, how \u2014 how \u2014 what that does take \u2014 takes out of you.",
        "A: So anyway \u2014",
        "A: And this is, you know \u2014 and then of course on the political scene now, in \u201938, th-\nthe Germans, the Nazis invaded Austria, and took over Austria, and in the spring of\n\u00b039, they invaded Czechoslovakia, and took over Czechoslovakia, and everybody\nfigured, you know, it\u2019s going to go on.",
        "A: There are members who left. But the key members, like Ed \u2014 Elsie(ph), and her\nhusband, Karl(ph) Heiman(ph) in Munich, he was \u2014 in Kristallnacht, he was\narrested and thrown into Dachau concentration camp. And his reaction was, if th \u2014 if\n\u2014 if this system can arrest Karl(ph) Heiman(ph), it\u2019s time to get out of here. And for\n\u2014 overnight, they just dropped everything and went to Switzerland. And from\nSwitzerland they came to France, to England, then the United States.",
        "A: And \u2014",
        "A: Yes. He \u2014 he \u2014 char \u2014 Charles, in the United States, Charles Heiman(ph)\nestablished a textile company in Cincinnati, Ohio, and I believe that his company\ntoday is the largest textile company privately owned in the United States, pertaining\nto servicing hospitals and hotels.",
        "A: You can go to any Marriot, and if you look at the label on your towels, it says\nStandard Textile Company, Cincinnati, Ohio. That\u2019s Uncle Charlie\u2019s company.\nHe\u2019s long dead, but my cousin Paul, who is my age, is retired, and his son is running\nthe company now, but that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s how.January 12, 2016",
        "A: On my father\u2019s side, my mother\u2019s brother did leave \u2014 I don\u2019t know when, but he\nleft in the late 30s, and came to the United States to go to Seattle. And it \u2014 and her\nyoungest sister, she was married to a surgeon, and they left about that time.",
        "A: They \u2014 they left, yeah. And her mother \u2014 her mother went to Holland, probably\nin \u00b039 \u2014 \u00b039, yeah. And so there was nobody left in Munich.",
        "A: Oh yeah, he died. He died in \u00b035, I believe.",
        "A: Yeah. But that\u2019s my mother\u2019s side. On my father\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: She \u2014 she got out. You know, it all had to do with who in the United States, if\nUnited States was your goal, who in the United States would vouch for you. Of\ncourse, my grandmother never really worked. She worked in the store, but she was\nnever employed. And so \u2014 and she was older, so she wasn\u2019t going to get a job, but\nyou know, Uncle Charlie and Aunt Elsa(ph) brought her over. But she got out\nwithin \u2014 less than four weeks before the Germans invaded.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: And so \u2014 and so, she was in Holland for a while. Her two sisters were in\nHolland.",
        "A: And \u2014 for a while. They \u2014 they \u2014 they left Holland, they went to South America,\nultimately. But she came to Cincinnati to be with my aunt and uncle there. So, of\nthe immediate family, there was nobody left. There were some brothers or cousins,\nbut I don\u2019t know anything about them.",
        "A: Tha-That was on my grandfather\u2019s side of the family, that he was in business\nwith. I don\u2019t know what happened to the business, whether it was sold, or \u2014 I have\nno idea. And on my father\u2019s side of the family, they didn\u2019t leave. I haven\u2019t talked\nabout them. My great-grandfather, in the mid-1800s, established a company in\nHockenheim, which was a tobacco \u2014 particularly cigars, cigar manufacturer. Must\nhave been a big deal, from everything \u2014 if you go to Hockenheim today, they\u2019|I tell\nyou about the cigar industry they used to have. But he established the thing, it was\ncalled \u2014 his name was Isaac Hockenheimer, and he established this company called\nIsaac Hockenheimer and sons. Isaac Hockenheimer und sohne. And you know\nhow primogenitor works, the oldest, his oldest, my grandfather\u2019s oldest son, Albert\n\u2014 these are the people that we stayed with for three months in Mannheim. He \u2014 he\nJanuary 12, 2016\nbecame a next generation director of the cigar company, and then one of his cousins.\nThe two of them were the heads of that, of the cigar industry in Hockenheim. They\n\u2014 they \u2014 but Albert and his wife, Alfreida(ph) did not leave. Then there was\nAlfreida\u2019s sister, who was married to a younger brother of my uncle, my father. His\nname was Louie, he was a bank president. See, they all had gotten into their own\nfields, he was a bank president. They didn\u2019t leave. The \u2014 there were quite a few of\nthem. And I say this for a purpose. Because, after France fell, in June of 1940, the \u2014\nsome guy who wanted to \u2014 guy by the name of Wagner(ph), who was in charge of\nthe \u2014 for the Nazi party in Stuttgart wanted to make Hitler believe that he was a\ngenius. He invented the situation. You may read it differently in history books, but\nhe \u2014 he told Hitler, we got to get rid of \u2014 they say we got to get rid of the Jews. And\nso they organized a deal where all the Jews of Baden \u2014 I don\u2019t know about\nWirttemberg \u2014 I mean, he wasn\u2019t in Wiirttemberg then, but Baden and Pfalz,\nwhich is Palatinate were ordered to be shipped out. They were put on trains and\nshipped not east, but to France, to the Gurs concentration camp, in the Pyrenees, in\nFrance. And so my dad \u2014 we haven\u2019t talked about that, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 my dad, who wound up at Gurs in the fall of 1940, after he was there,\ntrainloads of \u2014 of \u2014 of Jews from just about all the Jews who were still in Baden and\n\u2014 and Palatinate, were put on these trains and shipped down to Gurs, and he \u2014 so heJanuary 12, 2016\nmet his brother and sister-in-law, and the other sister-in-law, and the niece, and old\naunts, 84 years old, and the whole family wound up in this concentration camp in\nGurs which \u2014 where the conditions were not \u2014 they lived in barracks, and it was not\nvery good. We\u2019|l talk about Gurs later.",
        "A: But that\u2019s what happened to them. Now \u2014",
        "A: No, not 10, they \u2014 you know, they, through the years they got spread out. Let\u2019s\nsee, the oldest one was Albert, so he \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 came to Gurs with his wife. The next one was Karl(ph); he had gone to the\nUnited States before World War I.",
        "A: He lived in \u2014 in Hollywood, and wife and one daughter. And after that was\nLouie, the bank president. He died in \u201938 of a heart attack, but had this wife and\ndaughter who wound up in Gurs.",
        "A: That\u2019s number three that \u2014 then there were three sisters. Bella \u2014 Bella lived in\nStrasbourg, France. So she was \u2014 so, other circumstances. The strange thing in this\nfamily is that all three sisters married young, and were widowed young. Health si \u2014January 12, 2016\nhealth services weren\u2019t as good then as they are now, I guess. The second one, I\ndon\u2019t know when she left, Josephine. She was married \u2014 the first husband died, she\nwas married to a other gentleman by the name of Odenheimer(ph), who lived in\nBaden-Baden, and then she came to the United States. So she made it out before\nFrance fell. And then the young \u2014 younger one, the sister was Amalia(ph), and\nshe\u2019s the one who married the gentleman in Switzerland, that we went to stay with.\nSo she was in Switzerland, so she was safe. In those days, th-the girls, the sisters,\nhad absolutely nothing to say about what they did. It was the Albert \u2014 Albert in s \u2014\nin lieu of parents that didn\u2019t live, and probably Louie the bank president, because he\nhad prestige, decided what the sisters would do, who they would marry, or not\nmarry, and it was all organized. It\u2019s a different society. The \u2014 so that was\nAmalia(ph), and then my dad was next. So that\u2019s where they were. I saw \u2014 just a\nlittle side story \u2014 I saw Amalia(ph), I used to, when I was stationed in Germany, I\nwent to visit her, after her husband \u2014 second husband died, and then she wound up in\na Jewish old age home in the town of Baden, which is near Zurich. And, you know,\nshe had this nice room, and so on. Nice place. It\u2019s a Jewish old age home. And I \u2014\nevery time I went there, scared me to death, because she had a bed that was about\nthis high. She was \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: And \u2014 and th \u2014 she \u2014 you know how the Germans and the Swiss always polish the\nfloor. They have parkettboden. What do you call that in English?",
        "A: Parquet?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: And there \u2014 that \u2014 the maid would always come in wax, you know, and it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: And I used to watch her get \u2014 get out of bed. I would sit there, and walk around\nand it scared me to death that she was going to fall, break her hip or something. And\nI said to her \u2014 and we called her Mala(ph) \u2014 Aunt Mala(ph), I\u2019d like to put a carpet\nin here. And she said, darf man das? She said, is that permitted? You know, in the\nworld I come from, anything is permitted as long as you \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 do it the proper way. And I said, yeah, das darf man. I said, I'll go see the\ndirector.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: And just the mentality, the director, I went to the director, he was very nice. And\nI said I\u2014 I\u2019m scared to death my aunt\u2019s going to fall, she\u2019s going to break her hip.\nAnd the \u2014 and the \u2014 I\u2019d like to have a carpet installed, wall to wall carpet. And he\nlooked at me \u2014 you never know what people are gonna do \u2014 and he looked at me,\nand he said, but 1-1f or when your aunt dies, the carpet must remain here. And I sa \u2014\nand I s \u2014 and I said to myself, you know, okay, I said, of course, Ill be happy to\nleave it here. I mean, I\u2019m going to come from Germany, and take out the carpet? A\nwall to wall carpet? I mean \u2014 but that\u2019s the \u2014 the mentality. Darf man das. And\neverything in her life, from the fact that the brothers decided everything for the girls,\nin lieu of the parents, is always, is 1t permitted, you know? And that it\u2019s just a \u2014 you\nhave to understand that, you know, why people did the things that they \u2014 they did,\nand th \u2014 and the people always ask the question, why didn\u2019t the Jews revolt against\nHitler? And you know, it\u2019s because that was the authority, and you did what the\nauthority told you.",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2014I\u2014Iam sure. Well, I don\u2019t know whether it has to do with blame,\nbecause people \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the thing to me is that people should have had a\nJanuary 12, 2016\nconscience. And your conscience, that mean they \u2014 they raise you, saying what\u2019s\nright and what\u2019s wrong.",
        "A: And when you get to a certain point, and certain things are done. Now, Hitler \u2014\nHitler, one of the big things he used was the Versailles Treaty, and that \u2014 that\nGermany is only doing so badly because everything was taken away from us, and\nhe \u2014 he provoked nationalism, more nationalism, nationalism. We are the poor \u2014 y-\nyou know. I mean, think about this, he said the \u2014 that, you know, we \u2014 we need more\nlebensraum, we need more living space for the country. Well, but \u2014 but after the\nwar, the Bundesrepublik Deutschland, without East Germany, became the most\npowerful economic thing in the world, with the space that they had. So, you know,\nthat \u2014 this stuff is all just to suit his \u2014 his purposes. He wanted \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, exactly.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. He wanted to get the people to \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and tell\nthem that we\u2019re the thousand year Reich, and we\u2019re going to dominate history. And\nso that\u2019s he \u2014 he \u2014 that\u2019s how he sold the thing.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: I mean, there were good people in Germany. They\u2019re good \u2014 you know, it\u2019s just\nlike we talk about France. Some \u2014 some of the police guys were bad, some of the\nneighbors were questionable, but there were an awful lot of good people. I mean, I\ncould tell you the story that, when we lived in Marseilles, the \u2014 the guy that owned\nour apartment, I don\u2019t know how many months he didn\u2019t get paid rent. He never said\n\u2014 never said a word. He knew who we were, and that \u2014 what the circumstances were.\nAnd I suspect we'll get to how we got out of France later.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Pll tell you a story about one of our neighbors which is moving to the end, I\nmean, it\u2019s just \u2014 so, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 there are good people everywhere.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016\nfreedom of expression, and freedom after expression, you know? Freedom of\nSpeech, in other words. I \u2014 it\u2019s just \u2014",
        "A: So your question is, is it easier to do it the way the Germans did it?",
        "A: Well, the Germans \u2014 I\u2019m trying to figure out how to answer that. The Germans\nare by custom \u2014 not probably so much today, but were then, a people who only\noperated by authority. I \u2014 I like to say in 1945, when I was in Paris, and this is the\ndifference between I \u2014 you know, the French have poli \u2014 political cabarets, and you\ncan hear stuff that you don\u2019t hear anywhere else. But my saying then was, the\ndifference between a Frenchman and a German is that a German is on a Metro in\nParis, and he has trouble coughing. He needs to cough and to expectorate, and the\nsign says, in the subway, d\u00e9fense de cracher. Spitting prohibited. And so the\nGerman will stand there and go \u2014 and practically strangle. The Frenchman will come\nalong, and he says \u2014 and he looks at the sign that says, d\u00e9fense de cracher, spitting\nprohibited, and he\u2019! spit at the sign.",
        "A: So, you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 people are different. The French, even the French are\ndifferent from themselves.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Like Americans are different from themselves. The northern French are very\ncold, the southern French are very, ah, laissez aller, let \u2014 you know, manana.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Both. No, that can\u2019t be both. Some of them made, and some didn\u2019t.",
        "A: And some died there. My father\u2019s oldest brother, Albert, and his wife\nAlfreida(ph) \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 made it out. Their son lived in Los Angeles, and he was able \u2014 I don\u2019t know the\ndetails, but he was able to get them out, after we were gone. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t\nknow the details. His \u2014 as I told you, Albert\u2019s wife Alfreida(ph) sister was married\nto his brother Louie. They were two sisters married to two brothers. Louie had died\nin 38, in\u2014 1n Germany.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s what the records say. I had heard that he \u2014 the Gestapo came to arrest\nhim, and he had a heart attack. So, whether it was this way, or that way, but he was a\nvery formal man, what I knew of him. He would not open a door without having\ngloves on. Kid gloves, you know, suede gloves.",
        "A: Door handles had germs on them. He died in \u00b038, and his widow, Clara, and her\ndaughter Annie(ph), who\u2019s my first cousin, were shipped to Gurs, together with a\ngroup. Then there were a couple of old aunts, couple of whom died in Gurs. The\nconditions in Gurs were not like in Auschwitz or \u2014 or Dachau, but they \u2014 they were\nnot good. You were, quite basically, exposed to the elements, living in these \u2014 in \u2014 in\n\u2014 in barracks. She was still there. She was there throughout \u201942.",
        "A: Both the mother and daughter, Clara and Annie(ph) were there. There\u2019s quite an\nexchange, some of which I owe to this gentleman here, of correspondence that he got\nfrom the Quakers, and we\u2019ll get to that.",
        "A: But where the \u2014 where she, in \u201942, was asking for money, because she had no\nmoney, and \u2014 and so on. So, I believe \u2014 I\u2019ve got the date, I believe it was August of\n42, that we got a postcard from her, Clara. We\u2019re being loaded on a train, we do\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016\nnot know where to. And that\u2019s the last we ever heard of her. Both she and \u2014 and\nAnnie(ph) got gassed in Auschwitz, and \u2014 [sound of plane] Unfortunately, we\u2019re on\nthe pattern for Love Field.",
        "A: So they \u2014 they were shipped to au-aus-aus \u2014 Auschwitz. I have in the documents,\nwhich I have for Ron, one of my cousins sent a letter in \u201945, sent a letter to Gurs,\nwhen it was \u2014 there was still an administration there, and asked what happened to\nthem, and I have the letter from them that says what train they were shipped off on.\nDidn\u2019t say to Auschwitz, but \u2014",
        "A: No, that correspondence I got from the family archives.",
        "A: That particular one. But the \u2014 th-they have \u2014 th-they have the layout \u2014 you have\nthe layout at the Holocaust Museum, which even gives the dates, and so on.",
        "A: They did \u2014 they didn\u2019t make it. Then some died there. There was an Aunt\nSophie(ph) that was in her 80s when she \u2014 she\u2019s buried there. Caroline and I went\nto Gurs about 10 years ago, and there\u2019s not much left of it, but the cemetery is there.January 12, 2016\nThe people five miles from there, they don\u2019t know what Gurs was, which is always\npathetic. But there is a monument there with a train car, to remember. And the\ncemetery is there. Which is a point of interest. The city of Karlsruhe sends students\nto Gurs every summer, to take care of the cemetery, which should be noted as a\nstatement of \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 solidarity, or whatever.",
        "A: Or not forgetting.",
        "A: Yeah. They didn\u2019t have to do it, but they\u2019re doing it. Karlsruhe is very, very pro\nremembering the past, and all the bad things that were done. They\u2019re very nice.",
        "A: Yes. The kids \u2014 also on the kids, but kids tend to be engaged in the daily activities\nand so on. It obviously was very hard, but as they say in German, if we\u2019re adults, es\nbleibt in ihren knochen. It remains in their bones.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: The kids, if something had happened, it\u2019s not quite the same.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, and they don\u2019t have any responsibility, you know, whereas the adults\nhave responsibility for everybody.",
        "A: He \u2014 he was released, Mother was \u2014 so that was, obviously in \u2014 in \u201938 sometimes,\nI can\u2019t tell you when.",
        "A: Okay, so parallel to all this, the \u2014 the Germans, Nazis, occupied \u2014 took over\nAustria. Then in the beginning of \u201939, Czechoslovakia. And on the first of\nSeptember, \u201939 \u2014 I\u2019m laughing for a purpose, but they invaded Poland. After they\nhad had non-aggression pacts with the Soviets, and whatever. On the third of\nSeptember, France and England declared war on Germany, and that was the\nbeginning of World War II. Immediately when the war started, my dad, as now an\nenemy alien, was arrest \u2014 arrested. Interned, is maybe a better word. Sent to les\nMilles, which was a camp near Marseilles, in Aix-en-Provence, which is near\nMarseilles. And they collected all the people they didn\u2019t know where they fit in, and\nwhat did \u2014 who had a background from \u2014 at \u2014 now, at this point, this was a French\naction, nothing to do with the Germans.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: And so this cu \u2014 camp in Les Milles \u2014 you know how to spell it, I\u2019m sure.",
        "A: No, M-i-I-l-e-s.",
        "A: Les in front of it, l-e-s. It was a brick factory that they converted into a \u2014 I guess\nthey ran out of what to do \u2014 they didn\u2019t have any more bricks to make, so they used\nit for this, and they made it internment camp. And this was the craziest assembly of\npeople that you ever heard in your life, because there were a lot of people who had\nleft Germany, prominent people who had left Germany, who lived in France, and\nthey\u2019re the ones who wound up in Les Milles. That included Mare Chagall; that\nincluded Lion Feuchtwanger, the famous author; that included Nobel prize\nphysicist Meyerhof, and I could go on.",
        "A: They were enemy aliens.",
        "A: So they \u2014 they had this very strange \u2014 I read yesterday somewhere, that one of\nthem was a famous surgeon from Vienna, he came with his two \u2014 he had two\nattendants, two \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 people that did things for him, you know? Household \u2014 he brought them along,\nyou know? They weren\u2019t Jewish or anything, they were just \u2014 were his \u2014 his\nemployees. So they \u2014 they had them all there, and they didn\u2019t know what to do with\nthem. It was not super-dangerous, there were all kinds of outside contacts, but it was\n\u2014 but there was a fence around, and \u2014 and the conditions were not very good.\nHygiene, food, stuff like that. And my dad \u2014 that was in \u2014 in September, after the\nwar started. By December of \u2014 of \u201939, he got out of there. He had friends in\nMarseilles, which was nearby, that vouched for him, that he was a good guy, and so\nthey let him out. Some others never got out, but they let him out. And so, he was\nhome in Marseilles with us, until May of 40.",
        "A: In May of \u201940, the Germans, as you know, invaded Holland, Belgium,\nLuxembourg, came into northern France and in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 1n two weeks, reached\nParis, and took Paris. And the French army was nowhere to be seen. I don\u2019t know\nwhether that\u2019s true, but that\u2019s what it seemed like, because nobody stopped them.\nCharles de Gaulle would have said, well, the Germans had tanks, and we didn\u2019t.\nAnd that was true. And so they just kept going. So then the question came for us \u2014 I\nmean, the people from Paris, and so on, north, extreme south on the highways of\nFrance, and we were in Marseilles, and so then the authorities in Marseilles\nJanuary 12, 2016\ndecided hey, what\u2019s going to happen. And so they \u2014 as one of the first things they\ndid, is they took these people like my dad, and they put them back in Les Milles. So\nsome were, probably at the end of May, I don\u2019t have the exact date, my dad was\nback in Les Milles, where they had left \u2014 you know, ha \u2014 they had let them go.",
        "A: Yeah, but the French couldn\u2019t tell the difference, and there were people in Les\nMilles who were not Jewish, quite a few.",
        "A: There were oc \u2014 an occasional Nazi in there, too.",
        "A: Not by design, but by happenstance, because there were some Nazis who were\nliving in France, just like everybody else.",
        "A: And so they picked up everybody that was German, Austrian, Czech, and they \u2014\nif they didn\u2019t know \u2014 you know. By this time, there were thousands of refugees in\nMarseilles, because everybody from up north came down. There were hotels that \u2014\nthe French police had police raids every day in downtown Marseilles, to find people\nJanuary 12, 2016\nwho were here illegally. And so there \u2014 the stories are endless. But they were back in\nLes Milles, and the Germans ca \u2014 were coming south. And so, there wasn\u2019t much\ntime between the 20\" of May, you know, and so \u2014 so, about \u2014 and there, it\u2019s a little\nvague, the date is not quite sure. Let\u2019s \u2014 the book on Les Milles says about the 20\"\nof May, I \u2014 of June \u2014 I don\u2019t believe it, it\u2019s \u2014 had to be a few days earlier, it just\ndoesn\u2019t fit \u2014 they took \u2014 not everybody, but they took all the volunteers in Les\nMilles who felt threatened by the Nazis, and is \u2014 and the \u2014 the comman \u2014\ncommandant of Les Milles, who had some good sides to him. He was a reserve\nofficer, that the army wasn\u2019t his thing, and he was running this camp, and he also\nhad a\u2014a conscience, and so he decided to use his personal influence, and he \u2014 he\ncalled up somebody he knew, and he \u2014 I just read that in a book, I didn\u2019t know how\nthat worked. He called him up, and says, I w \u2014 I need a train. And so they produced a\ntrain for him, and said, anybody who wants \u2014 who \u2014 who feels threatened, we\u2019ll take\nyou away so the Germans can\u2019t get at you. So they loaded all these guys \u2014",
        "A: Everybody. Lion Feuchtwanger, and Hans(ph) Klay(ph), the famous artist, and\nI mean, there were dozens of them. They loaded them on this train, unless they\nrefused. Didn\u2019t have to go on the train. But the train was the purpose of escaping the\nGermans. And they \u2014 they put them on this train, and they headed west, towards the\nPyrenees, and basically towards the Atlantic. Bordeaux, Bayonne \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: My father was on this train, and I don\u2019t know, you know, he \u2014 you could visualize\nthat he could have said to himself, oh, but my family is in Marseilles, why do I want\nto be on this train? Because they said it \u2014 they said they were going to take him to\nNorth Africa, where they would be safe. I don\u2019t know when they said that, but they\nsaid that somewhere along the line. And so the train took off, and the captain \u2014 I\nmean, the commandant of the ca \u2014 of Les Milles, kept track of the train, to be sure \u2014\nyeah, then he called \u2014 they he called \u2014 like, this is new information for me, but he\ncalled a cousin of his, who owned the boat \u2014 the ship, in Bayonne, on the Atlantic\ncoast, and he said hey, I need you. I \u2014 you gotta be in Bayonne, | have got a\nthousand \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the number exactly was \u2014 of \u2014 of refugees here, I got\nto get to North Africa. Well, how much are you gonna pay me? Well, 500 francs, or\nwhatever it was, a head. Okay. So, they put him on a train, and the train took off.\nAnd he kept track of it, because the guy in Bayonne said, my ship will only be here\nuntil such and such a date. They gotta get here. So he kept working over the railroad\nofficial, so the train would keep moving, while the Germans were coming south.\nAnd so my guess is, on the 19\", I\u2014 you know, I\u2019m a little vague on that, but on the\n19\" of June, we got phone call. We \u2014 my mother got a phone call from the Fr-French\npolice, and they said, oh you gotta evacuate. Be \u2014 be at the train station at six o\u2019clock\nin the morning.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: And \u2014 and be at \u2014 at Gare Saint Charles, Saint Charles train station at six\no\u2019clock in the morning, we\u2019re gon \u2014 we\u2019re going to take you away, take you out of\ndanger. So, okay, so we pack our bags, and you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re ever going to\ncome back, so we took clothing and food, cause you don\u2019t know whether there is any\nfood. Well, then it happened that that night \u2014 and you can \u2014 we could figure out what\nthe date was, because that night in southern France was the heaviest thunderstorm I\nhave ever lived through anywhere. I mean, you thought the world was coming to an\nend. And we thought at the time it was caused by the artillery, that the artillery fire\nin northern France had caused so much disruption of the \u2014 of the atmosphere, that it\nscrewed up the weather. And anyway, it poured, and thundered, and lightning, I\nmean \u2014 and there was no means of transportation. You couldn\u2019t get a c-cab or\nanything. Nothing moved.",
        "A: At the train station.",
        "A: And so, we first \u2014 first we headed out, carrying suitcases, on foot. My house,\nwithout suitcases, was probably 45 minutes to an hour, by foot, to the train station.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: And so we walked a little bit in this thunderstorm. We decided that wa \u2014 we \u2014 we\nhad to let the storm go by, there was no way we could keep going.",
        "A: And so we went back home. And then I went next door to my friend George(ph)\nGarrute(ph), the Catholic kid who went to mass at five o\u2019clock in the morning, that\nI told you about. He was a couple of years older than I was. And I said, George(ph),\nI need you. He says, sure. I said, you gotta help me carry suitcases. Okay. So my\nmother and my sister went ahead, be sure to make \u2014 to be there on time when this\nwas supposed to happen, and \u2014 and George and I carried the suitcases. And we had\nto stop every 20 feet, because we \u2014",
        "A: Well, that \u2014 the storm wasn\u2019t that bad any more. That was the first installment.",
        "A: By this time it wasn\u2019t pouring any more.",
        "A: And so we \u2014 we \u2014 somewhere we decided that we had too many suitcases, we\ntook a couple back to the house, and went with the rest of them. And we carried\nthem to the train station. It took us more than an hour to get to the train station.\nCouple hours, I\u2019m sure. We finally got \u2014 at dawn, we got to the front of the train\nstation, and then we were told, oh, you got to go to the back of the train station. We\nJanuary 12, 2016\nhad a pretty big train station. So, there was a cab there. So I took the cab, and I said,\nokay, my mother has money, Ill \u2014 we\u2019ll pay for the cab when we get there. And so\nwe put everything in the cab, and we went around to the back. When we got there,\nmy mother was hysterical, because I hadn\u2019t shown up, and she didn\u2019t want to leave\nwith me \u2014 without me. And so she finally saw me, and she \u2014 she just \u2014 I can tell you\nthat the train left about 15 minutes after I got to the back of the \u2014 of the train station.\nAnd wi \u2014 it was one of these \u2014 many miracles I\u2019ve experienced in my life, this one of\nthem. And so the train left. And the train went \u2014 there were all women and children,\nthere were no men on this. And this, you \u2014 you know, I have to say, you were a man\nif you were over 18. Well, I wasn\u2019t, I was 14. So I was a child. And we \u2014 the train\nwent, and there was a \u2014 it was a passenger train, with compartments. We were in a\ncompartment, the three of us, with two ladies that we knew well, a mother and \u2014\nmother and daughter, who was about my mother\u2019s age.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Whose \u2014 the younger one, her name \u2014 they were, Mrs. Jacob(ph) \u2014 the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the mother, the old mother, she was probably in her 70s, her name was\nDevries(ph), d-e-v-r-i-e-s. The elder frau Devries(ph). Because her son\u2019s name was\nDevries, and Millie Jacobs(ph) maiden name was Devries, and so we had the old\nJanuary 12, 2016\nMrs. Devries, and Mrs. Jacob(ph), and my mother and my sister and I in this\ncompartment. And \u2014 and we went and stopped, and went and stopped, and this \u2014 you\nknow, you \u2014 the Germans were coming south. Nothing worked. I mean, it was a\nmiracle \u2014",
        "A: No, the only thing we knew, we were going west.",
        "A: And the \u2014 we went to \u2014 wound up in Toulouse, and then after Toulouse,\nwhatever the next \u2014 Niemes. And \u2014 and \u2014 and then we wound up, and we \u2014 we\nstopped in Lourdes. And Lourdes is well-known internationally, because of the\nCatholic shrine there. And so we are parked in \u2014 on the tracks. And by this time, it\u2019s\napproximately the 20 \u2014 either the 21\u00b0, or 22\u2122 of June. And we\u2019re sitting there for a\nwhile. We had gendarmes on board who were supposedly watching us, or taking\ncare of us, or whatever they \u2014",
        "A: In principle not, but if I\u2019d gone on the platform, nobody would have said\nanything.",
        "A: But we had no \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 reason, because you didn\u2019t know whether the train was going to leave in the\nnext minute.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know anything. Neither did the gendarmes. And so we were there \u2014 I\nknow we were there four or five hours. And \u2014 and there was a \u2014 let\u2019s see, we were\non this track here, and there\u2019s a track here, and the platform between us. And the \u2014\nthere\u2019s a train parked here, that\u2019s a freight train. And Pll \u2014 I\u2019ll swear to my dying\nday, it was a freight train, it was not a passenger train. And after a few hours, there\u2019s\na woman on our train, who looked at the freight train, and saw her husband. And this\ntrain, the pas \u2014 freight train, is what in history has gos \u2014 gone down as the phantom\ntrain. Th-There are books written about the phantom train, I got a movie, and a \u2014 and\na \u2014 books about it, what the phantom train was all about. And that was the phantom\ntrain. And after this woman discovered her husband, we all looked out, and got out,\nand my dad was on that train.",
        "A: From Les Milles.",
        "A: That was the train from Les Milles.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: And the funny thing is, Carol and I watched th-the movie about it a week ago. I\nhave a friend in California, just sent it to us. I didn\u2019t know there was a movie about\nit. And we just looked at it, and they\u2019 ve got a passenger train here. And it was not a\npassenger train. And I charged Ron with, somebody\u2019s gotta know why they \u2014 they\nsay \u2014 you know, I thought that when it got to its end that they \u2014 the people got off,\nand then the ship wasn\u2019t there, and then they put them on a different train. But I have\nno \u2014 nothing in writ \u2014 written record I have found that \u2014 that says that.",
        "A: Yeah, we \u2014 we \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 well \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we talked to each other. We talked to each other for a few hours.",
        "A: Not only him, but everybody else who had their wives and kids on the \u2014 on this\ntrain.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: They made us go back on our separate train, and they \u2014 and they said e \u2014 well,\nwhat you have to understand is about this time, 22\" of June, 19 \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 40, the word came out that France had signed an armistice, and the war was\nover.",
        "A: That the war between Germany and France was over. Now, what that meant,\nnobody could tell, at that point. And so, they \u2014 they \u2014 I doubt that they had orders,\nthe guys in charge of these trains. It just what you do when you have to make a\ndecision. So the gendarmes made us go back on our train, and they \u2014 the \u2014 the\nguards, th-the soldiers on the other train made them get back on their train, a-and\nsaid, and I quote, \u201cWell, don\u2019t worry. The war is over. You'll \u2014 your husbands will\nsoon be home.\u201d And they \u2014 and so that train left, and we left. We went back to\nMarseilles. We went back home. So we were only gone a week, I \u2014 give or take, I\ndon\u2019t know exactly, but so \u2014 and so, we went home. And this train didn\u2019t go home.\nThey went to \u2014 they stopped them in \u2014 in Nimes, which is a city on the way, and\nthey unloaded them, and they established a camp called Saint Nicolas, Saint\nNicolas, and they put them in there. Well, that was a very poorly prepared camp, andJanuary 12, 2016\nso he was in Saint Nicolas, this was June, end of June. He was, I think, in Saint\nNicolas July and August. And then somewhere in there, I would say August, maybe\nthe first of September, they decided to move the people from Saint Nicolas to Gurs.",
        "A: That\u2019s how he ended up in Gurs. Now to the history of Gurs is that Gurs was\nestablished in 1936, to bring in the refugees from the Spanish civil war. And so the \u2014\nthere probably were still some refugees of the Spanish civil war in Gurs when the\nGermans arrived. And \u2014 and my father and his cohorts \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, the enemy aliens.",
        "A: And so, that\u2019s how he wound up at Gurs.",
        "A: And \u2014 and then, that was in sep \u2014 let\u2019s say September, and on the \u2014 I believe it\nwas the second \u2014 22\u2122 of October that the Gauleiter of \u2014 of Wiirttemberg and\nBaden and whatever, decided to send all the Jews from Germany down there. And\nso that was the end of October that the people from Germany got there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016\nextended. Even after several years being in Marseilles, still being considered enemy\naliens, of being picked up, let go, picked up, let go, on a train, not on a train, but \u2014\nout of home, back to home. How did you have, I mean, not only the nerves that are \u2014\nare involved here, how did you eat? I mean, how were able to make money, how\nwere you able to make a li \u2014 how were they able to make a living?",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s not a question that my sister and I can answer. We don\u2019t know,\nbecause we were children, and we were protected. I know that my parents sold\nfurniture and items from their \u2014 the household at auctions, when they ran out of\nmoney. That much I know. Where the money came from to feed us, I have no idea. I\nknow we didn\u2019t get any money from relatives anywhere else. As a matter of fact, if\nanything, we gave money to people, members of the family who were in\nconcentration camps. You know, my dad did an occasional business deal. My\nmother, when the war started, knitted genouill\u00e9re.",
        "A: That\u2019s a thing that \u2014 knitted woolen things that soldiers wear on the \u2014 on \u2014 genou\nis the knee \u2014 wear on their legs to keep them warm in the front lines. She worked for\nthe war effort. But you don\u2019t make any money at that, you know. Somehow, to her\ngreat credit, she \u2014 somehow she scraped by. We \u2014 we don\u2019t know how. We \u2014 there\u2019s\nno way we can figure it out. We know that our landlord didn\u2019t push us if we couldn\u2019t\npay the rent. But we ate, and \u2014 and then this period when my dad was there, before \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016\nbetween Les Milles and Les Milles, you know, he came home one day and said, oh,\nyou know, there was \u2014 there was no food in France. I mean, forget about us, there\nwas no food. The only thing they sold in the \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the grocery store were\nrutabagas. If you present me with a rutabaga, Ill kick you out of the house.",
        "A: That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s all there was.",
        "A: And the \u2014 so that \u2014 I don\u2019t know how we \u2014 how we lived. On the other hand, my\nfriends, my French friends, never quit being my French friends. And my sister\u2019s\nFrench friends, she was \u2014 she has French friends from her school that she \u2014 that she\ncalls on the telephone once a month to this day.",
        "A: And they\u2019re all \u2014 my sister is now 91, going on 92, and they\u2019ve always been our\nfriends. We grew up with them. They \u2014 they never said to us, you are a dirty\nGerman, or something. They were our friends. And I\u2019Il tell you that in a minute, how\n\u2014 to what \u2014 how that works. But anyway, he was in Gurs, and we were here. Now,\nSeptember 19 \u2014 this is important, because without this, I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here. In\nSeptember of 1940, school started. And you know, so I go to school, and she goes to\nschool. That\u2019s the plan. And so I got to school, and they called me into the deputy\ndirector of the school, with my mother, and they said, oh, you can\u2019t come back. And\nJanuary 12, 2016\nmy mother said \u2014 you know, I was probably afraid of the guy \u2014 my mother said, why\nnot? Well, we \u2014 you\u2019re German. Your son is a German, and Germany has beaten\nFrance, has defeated France, and the other kids, who will know that you are\nGerman, will \u2014 will \u2014 will \u2014 will beat you up.",
        "A: Maybe he believed it, I don\u2019t know. And I said, I know, I said to him, nobody is\ngoing to beat me up. All my classmates are my friends. That \u2014 just the way it was.\nWe been together for four or five years, and you know, I knew every one of them.\nThey\u2019re all dead now, but I \u2014 if I walked down the street, they would embrace me.\nAnd \u2014 but he wouldn\u2019t relent. Okay. So now, my sister\u2019s going to school, and that\u2019s\nwhy I say \u2014",
        "A: Oh no, there were \u2014 my sister never has any problems. It\u2019s always me, because\nI\u2019m a boy. Girls get treated \u2014 Caroline doesn\u2019t believe it, but I can guarantee you\nthat boys got treated differently from girls. And so Mother takes the position, well,\nhe\u2019s 14 years old, Dad is in a camp, 14 year olds tend to get in trouble. Now, my\nmother didn\u2019t know my very well, because that was not something I knew how to\ndo. That wasn\u2019t part of my scenario. But anyway, so she \u2014 Mother had an\nunbelievable social conscience, and did \u2014 you know, what this woman did is way\nbeyond anything you can ever think of. And so she \u2014 she decided, first of all, she \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016\nwe now knew that Dad was in \u2014 in \u2014 in the camp \u2014 yeah, he was probably already at\nGurs. It was September.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s at the foot of \u2014 foot of the Pyrenees, near the Atlantic.",
        "A: Do we have a map of that, Caroline, if we can show where it is?",
        "A: Yeah. Now, it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Correspondence only. And so, but Mother tried to see how to get him out. You\nalways \u2014 there was always a possibility you could get somebody out. You could get\nhim out, if you could get him a visa to the United States. And so she was doing the\ntour of the relief agencies, of which everything had come to Marseilles. Marseilles\nwas the center, the fulcrum of \u2014 of everything now, because all the refugees all \u2014\neverything had come down to this place. And so all of the relief agencies, the \u2014 the\nQuakers, the \u2014 the OSE, Office de Secours Enfants, the \u2014 the \u2014 they took care ofJanuary 12, 2016\nkids, and the American Mennonite committee, the Unitarian committee, they were \u2014\nand then some non-American outfits, but they were all in Marseilles.",

        "A: Three.",
        "A: Yeah, July, August, September, three months. Was September.",
        "A: Definitely September.",
        "A: And yeah, they \u2014 they were there.",
        "A: For whatever good they did. And there were some people on that \u2014 in the cabinet\nof P\u00e9tain that were foo, right wing fanatics. They worked with the Germans, they\nloved the Germans. So anyway \u2014 so Mother went, and took me along, to go to the\nrelief agencies, to see how \u2014 what to do about Dad. And we had an application. I\ndon\u2019t know when it went in, but we had an application for visas in the unite \u2014 to the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016\nUnited States, and you have to supply affidavits from relatives, that you don\u2019t\nbecome a burden to the U.S. government, etcetera, etcetera.",
        "A: Yeah, well \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, because the Germans went to war.",
        "A: The minute the Germans declared war on \u2014 on \u2014 on the rest of Europe, to take\nover the world, that was pass\u00e9, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that wasn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t exist any more. The first place we went to, were the\nAmerican Quakers, the Americans\u2019 Friends\u2019 Service Committee. They had an office\non Boulevard d\u2019Ath\u00e9nes, 29. The train station, Gare Saint Charles that I told you\nabout, was sitting on top of the hill, and it \u2014 you could come straight down from\nthere. The \u2014 some steps, and then there was Boulevard d\u2019Ath\u00e9nes, Boulevard of\nAthens. And number 20 \u2014 on the \u2014 on the right hand side there was first the Hotel\nSplendide, and then this building 29, where the Quakers took over the floor. And so\nJanuary 12, 2016\nwe went to 29 Boulevard d\u2019Ath\u00e9nes, on the second floor, and there was a\nreceptionist, and \u2014",
        "A: Well, ah, you caught me. I \u2014 the last two years in school, in lyc\u00e9e, I had taken\nEnglish, and I had the first marks in English, both years. And well, it was easier for\nme, because I knew German, and you know, once you go languages, you \u2014",
        "A: But, so I knew some English. I know \u2014 knew more English than kids who go to\nAmerican high school and take two years of anything. My English was better than\nthat. It wasn\u2019t good, far from it. So we got there, and th \u2014 rang the doorbell, and this\nlady, whose name I have to look up, because I knew it so well, opened the door, and\nshe was the receptionist sitting in the lobby there. And we told her what we wanted,\nand we got to speak to a representative, and tell him the story, etcetera, etcetera, and\nwe went away. Mother observed that this was a total f\u2014 fallacy, this whole thing.\nThat here you have have only the clients, only spoke no French, they all spoke\nGerman \u2014 most of them. Some of them spoke some eastern European languages, but\nmostly German.",
        "A: And the receptionist doesn\u2019t speak anything except French.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: No, no, she was French.",
        "A: Was a local hire.",
        "A: And so Mother thought this over, not very long, and sh \u2014 we went back, and\nMother offered my services as an interpreter. Volunteer.",
        "A: I had nothing to do. She wanted to \u2014 the whole purpose was to get me to do\nsomething, because \u2014",
        "A: Keep me off the streets, exactly.",
        "A: And they accepted me.",
        "A: Yeah. I could speak German. Anybody that walked in the door, that came for\nhelp, I could ask them in German, what do you want? And I spoke French, I could\ntell the lady there, that\u2019s what they want. And I spoke some English, so I could\ninterrelate with the Quakers, who were very nice people.January 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, was a big, old, well-built \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 stone apartment house, basically.",
        "A: But they had offices. Maybe \u2014 I don\u2019t know how long they had offices, they \u2014\nmaybe they had always offices down below, but it was really an apartment house.\nAnd the reason I mention that it was next door to the the Hotel Splendide is because\nthe Germans made the Hotel Splendide the headquarters of the armistice\ncommission. So every day, when I went to work for the Quakers, I had to go by\nthese damn cars, with swastika flags on. And which di \u2014 scary enough. And also\nbecause \u2014 and this is way off from what we\u2019re talking about, but there\u2019s a guy by the\nname of Varian Fry that you might be familiar with. Varian Fry came into \u2014 into\nMarseilles, and made his headquarters in the Splendide.",
        "A: As well. Varian Fry was sent over by Eleanor Roosevelt to rescue a few\nhundred people like the ones I described to you before. Nobel prize winners, famous\nJanuary 12, 2016\ninternational painters, artists, engineers, poets, writers, musicians. And that was\nVarian Fry\u2019s task.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know where he fit in.",
        "A: Maybe the surgeon would have made it, but not the assistants.",
        "A: See, he had nobody to polish his shoes any more. But Varian Fry was there for a\nwhile, but then he \u2014 he \u2014 he was advised to get out of there because the Nazis would\nfigure out who he is, and that \u2014 that would not be good.",
        "A: I\u2019ve met Varian Fry, but you know, I was a 15 year old boy, ve met him\nbecause he came to our office, which was the headquarters of the Quakers, for the\nwhole Europe. And the \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, they \u2014 well, they got kicked out of Paris, they got kicked out of Spain,\nMarseilles was the only place left.",
        "A: And I could ri \u2014 I could tell you about the Quakers for days. They \u2014 the kind of\npeople they were, the \u2014 unbelievable people.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: So, we \u2014",
        "A: Well, he just came to visit.",
        "A: And I, you know, I knew he was Varian Fry. I did not know what his mission\nwas. I knew that he worked with us, but I didn\u2019t know that he was charged by the\nU.S. government, of rescuing famous people. And then he took an office somewhere\nin [indecipherable]. The rest is about Varian Fry\u2019s history. But \u2014 but that\u2019s \u2014 you\nhave to understand how this layout worked. The Splendide, with the Germans here,\nand we were in the building next door, 29 Boulevard d\u2019 Ath\u00e9nes. So, anyway \u2014 so I\nworked there initially, as the interpreter. And then they got to know me, and I got to\nknow them, and \u2014 but you have to keep in mind, I was 14 years old. I keep telling\nmy grandkids, who are 25, don\u2019t know how to get their finger out of their ear, what\nyou can do at 14, if you have to, you know. It\u2019s \u2014 was not my choosing.",
        "A: It was fate. And so \u2014 so at first, I did some of that all the time, but then there was\na gentleman by the name of Andel(ph) Burns Chalmers, he was a minister,\nJanuary 12, 2016\nProtestant minister from the United States, very soft spoken, twice as tall as I was.\nAnd he decided that I was going to work for him. And so \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, he was there. Like, he \u2014 he was the guy responsible for answering\nrefugees\u2019 questions, problems. And that included \u2014 that included refugees in\nconcentration camps. So all the correspondence from the concentration camps came\nto Mr. Chalmers \u2014 Dr. Chalmers. And \u2014 so gradually, besides going with Mrs.\nKirschner, Mrs. Kirschner was the wife of the president. The president was\nHoward Kirschner.",
        "A: Yes. He is \u2014 he was the big guy, and he had a deputy, whose name was Herbert\nLagler, who was a young American. Kirschner was a very religious man, who had\nmade a lot of money, and he decided he had to give back. And so he took over\nhelping refugees in France \u2014 Spain and France. And his wife was in charge of all\nthe children\u2019s colonies. They established children\u2019s colonies, there were a lot of kids\naround whose parents had disappeared, and the Quakers took them all in, and \u2014 and\nset up schools. My stomach is working again, I\u2019m sure you hear.",
        "A: And I\u2019m sorry if they\u2019re recording.\n100January 12, 2016",
        "A: And he then decided to use me. And he and I sat down and we developed a\nquestionnaire, which the Germans call a fragebogen. And we developed a\nquestionnaire of all the questions he had to have answered, in order to be able to\nanswer the letters he got from the concentration camps, internment camps, whatever.\nAnd I got a letter, which I have. I was charged with going to the American consulate.",
        "A: Oh, at least 25. I have a picture of it in \u2014 you have the picture tho \u2014",
        "A: The \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 there was \u2014 there was Howard Kirschner and his wife, and she\nwas not in the chain of command, but she had a function.",
        "A: And Herbert Lagler, who was a deputy. And then there were about four or five\npeople who were principles, who had different assignments. Chalmers, there was a\ngentleman by the name of Stevenson(ph), that only worked with refugees, and how\nto help refugees. And I am convinced that there were a couple people in the office\nwho worked for the underground. There was a guy with a wig, wi-with a cape \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n101January 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, that came in all the time. He had a red wig, and with this cape. His name\nwas Jean-Julien Chapenoire(ph). He was French, and I am sure he was part of the\nunderground. I just never figured that he could be anything else. He didn\u2019t ha \u2014 he \u2014\nhe didn\u2019t have a office in the office, but he was there, a lot of the time. Then they\nhad subsidiaries near the camps, at Toulouse and a couple place. But, I have a\npicture I\u2019Il show you, after we get off the air here, of a meeting of the Quakers that \u2014\nwhere they took a picture of everybody. And there were secretaries, of course.\nEverybody had a secretary, an assistant, to do all the paperwork, because most of\nwhat they did was paperwork.",
        "A: Most were American, but there were some British, there were some \u2014 a Swede or\ntwo. There \u2014 there were some pretty famous names in there. There \u2014 there were\npeople from western Europe who were in that sphere of social activity, support,\nwhatever.",
        "A: I doubt it.",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 they were all very kind people.",
        "A: They had a \u2014 they had a \u2014 I\u2019m not convinced that they were all Quakers. The \u2014\nsome of them were Unitarians, Mennonites, and so on. And \u2014 but they had a meeting\nevery Sunday morning \u2014 a Quaker meeting every Sunday morning. I\u2019m not sure that\nHoward Kirschner was a Quaker, but he was a religious person, very religious.\nThey had a meeting every Sunday morning in the \u2014 in the conference room, where \u2014\nthat I was privileged to attend. Where I didn\u2019t understand half of what was going on,\nbut because that was \u2014 we were now at a higher intellectual level. And they did \u2014 the\nmeeting room were about twice as big as this, and \u2014 and it consisted of chairs a-\nalong the wall. No table. All the way on the outside. And people would come in and\nsit down, and nobody would say anything, until somebody would speak up, and\npresent some thoughts about some issue. Very highly philosophical, or \u2014 or what\nthey saw that week, or whatever. And then they\u2019d sit down \u2014 not sit down, they\nnever got up \u2014 and they would stop, and then be a silence, and then somebody else\nwould pick up, and so that \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t remember all the details, but they \u2014 they \u2014 it was not \u2014 it was not\ncoordinated any way, it was all on the spur of the moment, the spirit of it. And it\nJanuary 12, 2016\nwas, you know, because it was a high level English, I \u2014 some of that I didn\u2019t\nunderstand. That was not my level. My level was somewhere here. But it was very\ninspiring, it was very beautiful.",
        "A: I can\u2019t answer that any more.",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t think so, but it may have been. It may be the next one who spoke took\noff from where the first one left off.",
        "A: But it wa \u2014 it was not a discussion across the room.",
        "A: It was just a presentation of thoughts, which may have been, or may not have\nbeen related to what the first person said.",
        "A: Thank you.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, the \u2014 a-as Dr. Chalmers and I got to know each other better, and he was\noverwhelmed, because the number of people in these camps that wrote to him, was\nvery, very large. And so he got a great number of \u2014 of letters every day, with people\npleading for assistance to save their life by getting an American visa, if they could.\nThe \u2014 he felt that I knew enough about things, and \u2014 so that he appointed me to be\nhis leg-man, his messenger, if you wish \u2014 it was more than a messenger, a messenger\nis an understatement \u2014 to the American consulate, to answer the question, which\nbasically amounted to, what\u2019s the status of my papers, and pos-possibility to get a\nvisa to the United States, from every one of these people that wrote. So he and I\ndevised a questionnaire so I could quickly go through files and \u2014 and fill out the\nblanks, and so he could answer the letters.",
        "A: So they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they gave me \u2014 they gave me a letter, which I \u2014 to present\nto the guard at the American consulate. After a few times, the guard knew me, so I\ndidn\u2019t need the letter, but initially saying that I was the representative of the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n105January 12, 2016\nQuakers, and I could have access to the consulate. And so I started going to the\nconsulate, I would say twice a week, to do this. Number one, it wasn \u2014 it wasn\u2019t easy\nto get into the consulate, for normal human beings. There was a line of people\naround the block to get into the American consulate, to see a representative of the\nconsulate, to find out the status of their papers, if they were able to do this. What I\nwas handling is the people who weren\u2019t able to come to the consulate.",
        "A: It\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s one block from the police prefecture, which \u2014 in the middle\nof town, which is a mammoth building. And there\u2019s a square, I don\u2019t remember the\nname of the square. I can tell you that today, the \u2014 which is not your question, but\ntoday the consulate\u2019s moved up about 10 buildings, and has a square, and the address\nof the square is Place Varian Fry, which I think is an interesting little thing that\nnobody\u2019ll tell you, unless you go there and you see it. But they were on a middle of a\nblock, with mammoth oak door, it was an old office building. Or it could have been\na private home, with a fairly large number of rooms 1n it, then you went in from the\nstreet, up some steps, and then you were inside the consulate.",
        "A: No.\n106\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: At that time \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was part of a \u2014 because it came out of peace time, it was still the same thing it\nhad been before, in peacetime, where people just went to a consulate, like you go to\nany office building. Well, there was a sm \u2014 relatively small building, but it was\nattached on both sides, to other buildings.",
        "A: To this \u2014 to this building, yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I believe not more than two.",
        "A: It was not a\u2014 it was more a spread out building, and deep building, than it was a\nhigh building.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t \u2014I can\u2019t tell you that. I \u2014 because I only related with certain people. I\nrelated to the people in the consulate division. A consulate has other functions. Like\nthe con \u2014 I never saw the consul general, not that I would \u2014 I wanted to. He was not a\nvery nice guy, I\u2019m told. But I only dealt with the consular staff, the people that\nhanded \u2014 handled the people applying for visa, or it could have been Americans who\ncame in, to have a stamp put in their passport. But that was the one section of the \u2014\nthe consulate, overall, that I dealt with.",
        "A: The latter. I\u2014 once I got past the guard, I was on my own.",
        "A: I went in the building to the section where the consular department was, and they\nhad this mammoth file room. You could call it a conference room. It had a big, big,\nlong oaken table in the middle, and the rest of the room were file cabinets, all the\nway again \u2014 against the wall, all the way around \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 around the table. And so, I went in there, I didn\u2019t ask anybody for anything, I\njust went in, and I put my briefcase and my files on the table. And the files were\norganized alphabetically. So I started at A, and worked my way around. And you\nknow, I had my \u2014 my request letters also in alphabetical order, so I could work my\nway in some kind of orderly fashion, to look up the files of the people whose\nrequests I had.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It was me in charge.",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 when you think about it, especially nowadays, you know, I worked in\nembassies and consulates later in life, it \u2014 it was totally inconceivable. It was that I \u2014\nand you know, as I say, I was a 15 year old boy \u2014 that I was \u2014 I had this access. Once\nI was inside, I was free to in \u2014 within the consular section, not the whole consulate \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I don\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t get involved there. But I just went in there and did my job.",
        "A: Of course.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Life and death.",
        "A: And the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, and every time I went in there, I also looked under\nHockenheimer.",
        "A: And see oh, has anything come in from the last time, you know, from our\nrelatives.",
        "A: Oh, in the United States? Well, there were two. There was my mother\u2019s sister,\nElsa(ph) and Charlie Heiman(ph), who had only been in the United States since\n1939, I believe, so they weren\u2019t that well established in 1940 \u2014 \u201941. But he was a\nbusinessman, and so he gave us what was required, probably still is, an affidavit.\nAnd then my mother\u2019s brother Walter, Walter Lowen(ph), he changed his name\nfrom Lowenthal to Lowen(ph), he lived in Seattle, and he gave us another\nstatement. What they wanted is a statement saying we would not become wards of\nthe state. That\u2019s really what it amounted to. And so we had these, and the \u2014 the \u2014 the\n\u2014 the consulate ha \u2014 the consul, in charge of consul affairs had to \u2014 had to decide\nwhether it was enough, or not, semicolon; the policy in Washington was not to give\nJanuary 12, 2016\nany visas. Cordell Hull was Secretary of State, and he had a sidekick who was\nworse, and their policy was not to give visas to refugees. Jewish refugees, I can\u2019t tell\nyou exactly, but that was the policy. The \u2014 the consul general in Marseilles, whose\nname just came to my mind, was Fullerton. Mr. Fullerton was abiding by these\ninstructions, and on his staff he had vice-consul Hiram Bingham, and who had a\nsidekick whose name was Miles Standish. If you want to be American, you can\u2019t\nget more American than Hiram Bingham and Miles Standish. And they were on\ntheir own. They, on their own, decided. They met the refugees. Miles Standish and\nBingham went to Saint Nicolas camp, and \u2014 and got the Lion Feuchtwanger out\nwhile he was washing himself at the creek, a-and they \u2014 they \u2014 they had a taxi\nstanding nearby. They \u2014 they quickly changed him into a woman, and had him sit in\nthe back of the seat. And when the police stopped the taxi, they said, who is that in\nthe back? Oh, that\u2019s my mother-in-law from Georgia, and the taxi waved them on.\nHe was an American consul, so they thought he had some authority. And that\u2019s how\nthey got him out of there, but you could have access to \u2014 to Saint Nicolas, in\nNiemes. But anyway, it \u2014 Hiram Bingham worked with Varian Fry, they met\nsecretly in places, to exchange information on getting the people that Eleanor\nRoosevelt wanted out. How to figure out how to get them passport, and get them on\na boat, or another boat, over the mountains, into Spain, or whatever. There were \u2014\n111January 12, 2016",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: But she was a power.",
        "A: Eleanor Roosevelt was a power unto herself, and nobody would have challenged\n\u2014 Cordell lul \u2014 Hull would not have challenged Eleanor Roosevelt. So this is the\nkind of stuff that you \u2014 you know, put a blind eye on it. But \u2014 but what Hiram\nBingham did, you know, was spectacular, because he issued 2,500 visas to people\nwithout permission from \u2014 from Washing \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, he did. He got into a lot of hot water. He \u2014 we left in May of \u201941, in\nJune of \u201941, they \u2014 they canned him. They pulled him out. Some people knew about\nhim, and complained to Vichy. We had an American ambassador in Vichy, Admiral\nLeahy, and somebody got at him. He was no particular wonderful person, and they \u2014\nthey put pressure on him, and they \u2014 they pulled him out and send him first toJanuary 12, 2016\nLisbon for a few months, and then to south Montevideo. And then, I don\u2019t remem \u2014\nI don\u2019t know what they did exactly, but they \u2014 he retired, or quit the foreign service\nbecause they made life so miserable for him, and never got another job.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, he \u2014 he was \u2014 as a result, he was kicked out of the government. But he sa \u2014\nhad saved 2,500 people. He was a very tall man, he had 11 children. He \u2014 he\nfollowed his conscience.",
        "A: Yes. One time, I \u2014 maybe more, but I remember one time, the \u2014 in \u2014 in March,\napproximately, of \u201941, Mr. Chalmers \u2014 Dr. Chalmers said to me one day, I have \u2014\nhad you \u2014 as you know, I live with Hiram Bingham \u2014 which I didn\u2019t know \u2014 and we\nspoke last night, and he said next time you are at the consulate, drop in to see him.\nAnd as you can well imagine, I went to the consulate the next day. I didn\u2019t let any\ngrass grow under my feet. And there I had to, you know, ask \u2014 there was a Miss\nHouligan(ph), who was kind of the administrative person there, she was a nice\nperson. And I told her that Hiram Bingham wanted to see me, and so she took me\nin to see him. And he said to me, you know, th-the Quakers highly recommend you\nand your family. I \u2014 I know your dad is at Gurs, and we\u2019re ready to issue you visas.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016\nBut if you issue a visa, it\u2019s only good for 90 days, and \u2014 but your dad is at Gurs, so\nwe first have to get your dad out of Gurs before I advise that you get a vise,\notherwise, it might run out before you get to the United States, and you have to start\nfrom scratch. And so he \u2014 he \u2014 he said, I\u2019m giving you a letter, addressed to the\ncommandant at \u2014 at Gurs, whoever\u2019s in charge, and saying \u2014 on American si \u2014\nconsulate stationery, saying that we\u2019re prepared to issue your family a visa, and the\nchances are 50-50 that they\u2019ll let him go. And so \u2014 and then, you come back. And so\nwe \u2014 we \u2014 he gave me the letter, we sent it to Dad, they let him out.",
        "A: You have to remember, I was 15 years old. At 15, you don\u2019t go into all the\npossible angles. All that mattered to me is that the American consulate was going to\ngive us a visa to get out. That \u2014 th-that, you know. And you can imagine how my\nmother felt. And so, you know, and that came \u2014",
        "A: Well, she was \u2014 well, you \u2014 honestly, you didn\u2019t believe any of it until after it\nhappened. That \u2014 you know, I'll give you an example in a second. The \u2014 the \u2014 so we\nget \u2014 Dad came back, so we had to get out, okay? So the debate became, how do you\nget out? You could \u2014 you had two options; you could go through Spain. There was a\nguy by the name of Francisco Franco there, who could have caused you a hardJanuary 12, 2016\ntime, you didn\u2019t know. Or, you could take a ship from Marseilles to the West\nIndies. Now, there weren\u2019t that many ships, but th-they \u2014 there were some. And so\nwe decided okay, so we worked, from the point of view, when was our ship going?\nAnd so, there was a ship on the sixth of May, the Winnipeg, and there was a ship on\nthe 10\" of May, the Wyoming. And so, you had to get ship\u2019s passage, which wasn\u2019t\na given. You needed an exit visa from France, and you needed a transit visa for the\nFrench West Indies, and you needed ship\u2019s passage. And so we started working on\nthat. The Quakers, the \u2014 Herbert Lagler, the number two guy at the Quakers, called\nthe president of the French line, and said, we have four members of our staff \u2014 note\nthe \u2014 the wording \u2014 who are ready to go to the States, we need four bunks, passages,\nwhatever. And the president \u2014 they didn\u2019t start at the bottom, they went to the\npresident of the French line. And the president of the French line said, we \u2014 we have\nno more cabins. And Herbert Lagler said, well, our staff members will take any\naccommodation. Which meant the hold of the ship, because these ships were not\npassenger ships, they had ca \u2014 they were freighters with some cabins. And so they\nhad turned the \u2014 the hold into receptacles for human beings. And say \u2014 our quo \u2014 our\nmembers will \u2014 will take whatever you got. So, okay. So \u2014 I\u2019m stepping si-sideway\nhere.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: And we \u2014 they sent me as a messenger from the Quakers, to the French line,\ncalled the Messageries Maritimes, to pick up the tickets and give him a check. And\n\u2014and I got the tickets, and he said, who are you? I\u2019m the messenger of the Quakers,\nokay? So I had my four tickets, which turned out to \u2014 well, I\u2019ll get to that. And then\nwe had to get the papers from the French police prefecture, for exit visa and the\ntransit visa. And this is where the story always gets me, is that we knew that on the\nsecond floor of the house, the apartment house we lived in, there was a lady, middle-\naged lady, who lived with her aunt and uncle, they were Corsicans. They were called\nGiglielmi(ph) Morachini(ph). And we knew her \u2014 them \u2014 we didn\u2019t know her aunt\nand uncle at all, but \u2014 and I can\u2019t tell you whether her name was Giglielmi(ph), or\nMorachini(ph). But, be that as it may. And \u2014 but we knew she worked for the\nFrench police prefecture. So my mother and I went, rang her doorbell. And all we\nknew about her was from saying, bonjour Madame, as we went higher up than she\nlived, as she came out the door. And we said, Madame, we understand that you work\nat the police prefecture, and this is our situation. We have visa for the United States,\nwe're leaving, we need a French exit visa, and transit visa, and can you help us with\nthat? She said yes. And she said, I will bring you the papers tomorrow, to fill out. So,\nshe \u2014 next day we saw her, and she \u2014 she gave us some questionnaires to fill out, and\nwe filled them out. Rang her doorbell, and said, here are the papers. Okay, I will let\nyou know when I get the answer. Few days later she contacted us, and she said, the\n116January 12, 2016\npapers are ready, and \u2014 but you have to go pick them up yourself, because you have\nto get a stamp, and they \u2014 they put \u2014 paste the stamp on there, like a postage stamp,\nbut it\u2019s a fee, or whatever. So I went there, and I picked up the papers, and again\nthey asked me who I was, and I said, I\u2019m the messenger. And I gave them the money\nthey wanted, and you know, they don\u2019t ask 15 year old kids much. You \u2014 you\u2019 ve \u2014 if\nI had been 25, it would have been different, but I wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, that\u2019s what \u2014 my whole life has been like that. And I-I\u2014I-I ga\u2014-\nso I wound up with the \u2014 with the French exit visas, and with the transit visa for the\n\u2014 for the Martinique. And \u2014 and you have to ask yourself the question, is why did\nshe do that?",
        "A: She was a nice lady, she knew us for years, she knew whe \u2014 we were nice people,\ngood neighbors. She didn\u2019t know any \u2014 a thing about us, otherwise. And she spoke\nfrom her conscience. And every time I tell this story, I have a hard time telling it,\nbecause it was such a unexpected thing, that came out of \u2014 you know. It\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s a\nhuman \u2014 it was a human gesture that \u2014 that just transcends anything you can say\nabout anything. And so we had all that, and then we \u2014 we had a \u2014 we had to get rid\nof all our furniture. And so we did that, I don\u2019t remember how, my parents did that.\nAnd my mother \u2014 my dad said, before we got the tickets, my dad said, Winnipeg on\nJanuary 12, 2016\nthe sixth of May, Wyoming on the 10\" of May. We ought to take the Wyoming, it\u2019]]\ngive us four more days to get everything taken care of. And that\u2019s the one time in my\nlife that I heard my mother said, over my dead body. I don\u2019t know how you say that\nin German, but she said, over my dead body, we\u2019re leaving on the sixth of May. And\nso, on the sixth of May \u2014 now, we did take some things along. My sister and I don\u2019t\nknow how there\u2019s \u2014 if you go around the corner here, there\u2019s a mammoth oil painting\nof the Bavarian Alps in there. That came out with us. We have no idea how they did\nthat, absolutely no idea.",
        "A: They\u2019re free \u2014 their \u2014 no.",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was like this.",
        "A: There were three di \u2014 there are three more paintings. There\u2019s a naked lady down\nthe hall, she was part of it, and my sister has two oil paintings, and \u2014 and then a\nbunch of books, that was it. Kultur.",
        "A: Germans believe in culture, and that \u2014 furniture be damned, you know.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: You can always get furniture, but paintings and \u2014 and so \u2014 anyway, so Winnipeg\nit was, and the Quakers picked us up in the staff car, American Friend Service\nCommittee on it. They took us to the pier, to the \u2014 to the gangplank, and there was\nthe German with the swastika. You know, it \u2014 it always just to keep you from\nwhatever.",
        "A: And he checked everybody that got up there. They were looking for people that\nwere on their list. Wi\u2014 thank God, we were not important enough, so we were not\non their list, so we got up there. But they did arrest a \u2014 a few people there. The wife\nof a former member of Parliament, and a few people like that. And so then,\nWinnipeg took off, sixth of May. We went from Marseilles to Oran in Algeria, did\nnot dock. Then we turned west, to Gibraltar, we went through Gibraltar to\nCasablanca. We stopped in Casablanca. We were able to touch the soil, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve\ntouched the soil of Africa. And \u2014",
        "A: No, he wasn\u2019t there. Even Sam the piano player wasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: And we \u2014 it was my sister\u2019s birthday, the 14\" of May, 1940. And my dad had\nconnections in \u2014 in Casa, and because it was her birthday, he got a message to them,\nand the guy came on a motorcycle, to bring her some strawberries. She was\nJanuary 12, 2016\nsupposed to get whipped cream, but he said it was too hot, and the whipped cream\nwould be sour. So I\u2019ve been giving my sister strawberries and whipped cream ever\nsince then, every year. But, so then we left \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we left Casa, and went down along North Africa, down to Dakar, but did not\ntouch. Dakar is right on the equator. And we went across the equator to the West\nIndies. Now, the day before we got to Martinique \u2014 actually, a night and a half\nbefore we got to Martinique, it was so damn hot in the ship \u2014 there are lots of things\nabout the ship that I\u2019ll spare you, but it was so hot, there was no way I could stay\ndown \u2014 down in the \u2014 in the hold. I mean, you \u2014 you just \u2014 you suffocated. And I \u2014\nabout midnight I went up on deck, and I \u2014 just to get some air, just to breathe. And I\nbecame aware of several things. One of them was that it was pitch black. The sea\nwas totally calm, there was no wave going on. But then I dis-discovered, or decided\nthat the ship wasn\u2019t really moving. I said oh, what\u2019s going on here? And I went and I\nlooked and talked to some people, and we were just sitting there. And then all of a\nsudden, from all sides, we were lit up in \u2014 1n lights, as the focal point, and some \u2014\nsome rope ladders were thrown up on the ship, and a bunch of characters came up,\nand we couldn\u2019t tell who they were. They had no uniform on, they wore blue jeans,\nor whatever, and they all had weapons. And they spoke a language which I didn\u2019t\n120January 12, 2016\nunderstand, which you know, I \u2014I was pretty good at languages, but I didn\u2019t know\nwhat they were talking. And so they took us over, they cap \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they captured us. And \u2014",
        "A: No. They \u2014 they were \u2014 they were \u2014 they were Dutch, of the wild Dutch army in\nexile, the \u2014 the free Dutch, who had gone to England, and they captured us on\nbehalf of the \u2014 on behalf of the British, and they took us to the French \u2014 to the\nBritish to trade that, at the British West Indies.",
        "A: Well, that \u2014 that \u2014 that is very cogent question, because we didn\u2019t know who they\nwere, but in the morning when we got daylight, I looked at the flag, and the flag\nwasn\u2019t tricolor any more, it was orange, which represented the House of Orange-\nNassau of the Netherlands. And so they took us in, they took us to Port of Spain,\nTrinidad, and they had captured us. Of course, we had some French soldiers aboard,\ngoing to Martinique as replacements, or whatever. And then the \u2014 the \u2014 the radio\noperator barricaded himself in the thing, and he called in the French for whatever,\nand the \u2014 one ef \u2014 one airplane came, and somebody \u2014 they didn\u2019t do anything, they\njust took us to Trinidad.\n121January 12, 2016",
        "A: Not after Vichy, this was Vichy.",
        "A: This was a Vichy ship.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t say that. A Vichy ship, it was flying under the Vichy flag,\ngoing to Martinique, which was under the con \u2014 control of Vichy. Now, the reason\nI understand they did it \u2014 [phone ringing, break]",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And they \u2014 they took us to Trinidad, which was British, and the reason\nthey did it, I\u2019m told, is that the Germans, Rommel in North Africa had \u2014 had given\nthe Nazis the rights to use airports in Syria. Haven\u2019t you heard of Syria before? And\nas a countermeasure, the \u2014 the British decided a \u2014 hey, you think we can\u2019t do\nanything? So the British decided to \u2014 okay, as punishment, they decided to sh \u2014\ndecided to seize a Vichy French ship. The \u2014 we happened to be on board. The reason\nthis is so important about the \u2014 the \u2014 the Winnipeg and the Wyoming, is because\nwhen the Winnipeg was captured, the Wyoming, four days behind us, was off theJanuary 12, 2016\ncoast of Africa, coming across the equator. And when \u2014 and when this happened,\nwhen the Winnipeg was captured, the Wyoming was turned around, back to Africa,\nso he wouldn\u2019t be captured, and the people who were in the Wyoming spent the rest\nof the war in \u2014 in \u2014 in Senegal, some of them working on the Trans-Sahara rail\nline.",
        "A: Not one more day.",
        "A: Every day \u2014 when you get in a situation like this, don\u2019t delay anything, because\nyou never know what\u2019s changing tomorrow.",
        "A: And so that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s why the Winnipeg, Wyoming story is important, because\nthe alternative would have been, we wa \u2014 would have wound up in Africa.",
        "A: No, but ships can have \u2014",
        "A: \u2014any name. The Winnipeg was sunk during World War IJ, in \u2014 in the Atlantic,\nwhen it was working for the allies.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, you can look up that kind of stuff \u2014\n123\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 on the web nowadays.",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 the people of Trinidad had \u2014 were told that the British had captured\nthe German warship, which we were not. And so half of Trinidad was out on the\npier, trying to see what these Germans looked like, and of course, it was women and\nchildren. And the British were very nice. They put us in a camp, but the camp was\nnicely organized. They fed us, and whatever. And to the extent that they even\nproduced buses to take us on a tour of Port of Spain.",
        "A: So it \u2014 it was no hardship post. And so what we \u2014 but what we needed to do, you\nsee, because our trip was arranged for us to take a ship out of Martinique to New\nYork, it was all paid for. And we weren\u2019t in Martinique, so we couldn\u2019t take a ship\nfrom Martinique to New York. So we had to start from scratch on that, but we were\nsafe.",
        "A: And so my mother contacted her sister, Elsie(ph) and Charlie Heiman(ph) in\nCincinnati, and they \u2014 they booked passages for us from Trinidad to \u2014 to New\nYork on the luxury liner called the SS Uruguay, which came from South America,\n124\nJanuary 12, 2016\nto New York. And after being on that \u2014 on the Winnipeg, in the hold, being a guest\nlike a first class passenger on the Uruguay, was another world. It \u2014 1t was, you\nknow, we \u2014 dining \u2014 air conditioned dining room, waiters with gloves, silver trays. I\nmean, how \u2014 how can \u2014 you know, you have to ask yourself, where the hell did that\ncome from, you know?",
        "A: It was a little difficult, because there was a tropical storm \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that hit us. When my mother and my sister went on the \u2014 on the Uruguay\nwithout a problem, then my dad and I were behind, getting the luggage, and\naccompanying the luggage. And when we went from \u2014 from Port of Spain, that \u2014\nthe Uruguay was too big to come into the harbor. It had to sit outside. And \u2014",
        "A: And \u2014 or a little boat, one puff-pu-pu-pu \u2014 little one-horsepower motor. And there\nwere about, I don\u2019t know, 20 people on this thing. It was a little cabin with a \u2014 with\nthe guy in charge, the pilot. And we didn\u2019t all fit in. There was a young doctor, by\nthe name of Dr. Hirschberg(ph) \u2014 I just saw his name yesterday, somewhere. He\nand I were outside, and our job was, when the cyclone hit us, to \u2014 you know, these\nlittle boats have tires on the side, so that when they hit something else \u2014\n125\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 they don\u2019t fall apart.",
        "A: And so every time a wave came, he would throw the tire on \u2014 on the deck, and\nHirschberg(ph) or I would throw the tire back out in the water, you know. So when\nwe got to the \u2014 to the Uruguay, they had a platform at the bottom, with a gangplank,\nand this thing would come to the gangplank, and they \u2014 they said jump. I says, I\u2019m\nnot gonna jump. I was soaking wet, I had water in my shoes. I was soaked, you\nknow? Every wave had gone over my head. Said, I\u2019m not jumping, because if I slip,\nthe thing\u20191l come back and I\u20191l fall between, it\u2019Il crush me. I said, I\u2014 I\u2019m not\njumping. My mother was up there looking down. She recognized me. And the\ncaptain was standing next to her, and she started screaming, and the captain said,\nwhat\u2019s going on. She said, that\u2019s my son, that\u2019s my son. And he sent down some\nsailors on the platform, and one of them jumped on our little boat, and the other one\nheld the rope, and the one held me until I was on the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 on the other side, and I went up \u2014 I wa \u2014 I was seasick for a while because \u2014\nfrom that \u2014 from the little boat, you know?\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: The Uruguay was sitting there like it was a mountain in the water, wasn\u2019t\nmoving. But that was the last part of trip. We had to \u2014 you know, we had to get a\ntouch of everything. So then we came to New York, and \u2014",
        "A: Yep.",
        "A: I\u2014 you know, it was \u2014 it\u2019s beyond \u2014 we didn\u2019t have the proper clothes, you know.",
        "A: In\u20141n that dining room, you\u2019re supposed to dress up with a tie, and so on. I\ndidn\u2019t have anything like that.",
        "A: So \u2014 but there 1s \u2014 it went fine, I just \u2014 I got over my seasickness by go \u2014 jumping\nin a swimming pool.",
        "A: Oh, they had several swimming pool. This was first class.",
        "A: Same way.\n127January 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, it was on \u2014 oh, mean to the Uruguay\u201d",
        "A: You know, nobody\u2019s ever asked me that question. It must have gone with us. I \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know how else, I pa \u2014 I don\u2019t know the answer.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 I\u2014I- we decided to \u2014 we stayed with relatives, I don\u2019t remember\nexactly whom, but \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I \u2014 in \u2014 in my book it says that twice in my life I ha \u2014 have\nhad this experience. The first one when \u2014 when we passed the Statue of Liberty, the\nfeeling that this brings out in you. And just to have arrived somewhere where they\nwon\u2019t kill you. And the second time that happened to me is on the other side of the\ncountry, when I ca \u2014 as a lieutenant, I came back from 14 months in Korea, and we\nwent under the Golden Gate bridge, and I almost went apart, because, you know, I\nfeel the same way about the Golden Gate bridge as I feel about the Statue of Liberty.\nIt\u2019s just a\u2014 you know, this feeling of, whew, I made it again, you know, kind of \u2014\n128January 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, it \u2014 it \u2014 you know, it was \u2014 it \u2014 it just \u2014 1t\u2019s \u2014 you can\u2019t even describe it,\nyou know, it\u2019s such a weight, just a \u2014 a weight off of you that you \u2014 I said gee, I\u2019ve\nbeen given another life, is what it amounts to. So \u2014",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 basically, my family settled in New York. However, the same aunt\nand uncle in Cincinnati I\u2019ve talked about, Elsa(ph) and Charlie Heiman(ph),\ninvited me to come stay with them for a while, until my parents got settled. And so, I\nmoved to \u2014 to Cincinnati. My mother and sister went with me, and dropped me off\nwer \u2014 and stayed a little bit. My grandmother was there. They all lived in the same\nlittle court. And I spent 15 months, approximately, in Cincinnati. I graduated high\nschool, at 16, in Cincinnati. Decided I\u2019d learned everything I would ever learn. The\nonly thing they made me take is a course in civics. I had to be in a \u2014 good American,\nso I \u2014I took that, and American history, two courses. Then I graduated high school,\nand then I \u2014 I started at the University of Cincinnati. I \u2014 I worked during the day, I\nhad to \u2014 you know, that was part of the \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Oh, I was working as a si \u2014 first I was working as an errand boy for an optical\ncompany on a bicycle. And I went over from Cincinnati to Covington and\nNewport, Kentucky every day. And then I decided that was too cold in winter, or\nsomething, and I got a job as a stock clerk in a \u2014 in a textile company. When I got\nbored of that, I got a job as a stock boy in a toy company. Those were the three jobs I\nhad, and I went to school at night, while I was there. And then, in October of \u201942, a\nre \u2014 the connection there was that my \u2014 my aunt and uncle had a son who was \u2014 who\nwas nine months younger than I am, and so he and I were buddies, and he taught me\nall about America. He\u2019d been there all of two years. A-And the \u2014 and he and I are\ngreat friends to this day. Then I went to New York, and my uncle was always sure I\nneeded a job to earn money. You know, that\u2019s the way he operated. He was no big\nintellectual, he was \u2014 and kind of frowned upon by that part of the family, because\nall we wanted to do, my sister and I, was go to college. And that wasn\u2019t necessary, in\norder to make money. So \u2014 but in New York I worked first for a textile company,\nthat he probably got me the job. And then \u2014 and then I decided I could do better\nthings. I went to school at night. I went to city college in New York at night, and\nplayed soccer on the weekends, in the French sporting club, and became quickly \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016\nwell, from the beginning, even in Cincinnati, I was totally \u2014 you have to understand,\nthat having had the experience that I had with the Quakers, I was not a normal kid. I\nhad the war \u2014 the war weighed very heavily on my \u2014 on my personality, and I\ncouldn\u2019t see where all these people were \u2014 people were sitting around and having a\ngood time, when there were people dying in \u2014 in Europe and nobody was helping\nthem. And so I was getti \u2014 got involved in \u2014 in \u2014 even in Cincinnati I joined the\nAlliance Frangaise, and tried to get people interested in what\u2019s going on in Europe,\nand we can\u2019t just \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a cultural \u2014 it\u2019s a cultural \u2014",
        "A: But French. And they had speakers. And since there were a lot of Frenchmen in\nexile at that point, they had speakers relating to the \u2014 to the war. The \u2014 Ron sent me\na bunch of \u2014 of documents from the Quakers, which \u2014 which \u2014 that \u2014 which included\nletters that I wrote from Cincinnati to the Quakers, asking them for certain actions,\nand do that, and do this, and do that. And \u2014 you know, normally no organization\nwould pay attention to what a 15 year old has to say, but I \u2014 I just was \u2014 I couldn\u2019t\nget that out of my system. So when I got to New York, besides everything else, I\nquickly got involved politically in the \u2014 with the f \u2014 free French youth, the \u2014 the de\nGaulle\u2019s youth. That was a great de Gaulle\u2019s \u2014 anything to fight the Nazis.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 12, 2016",

        "A: And \u2014 and I was very involved in \u2014 in raising money for the free French forces,\nstuff like that. I \u2014 until \u2014 until I went into the army, which was basically right after\nmy 18\" birthday.",
        "A: It worked like this, that I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t volunteer before I was 18, because\nI was not a citizen. That\u2019s the way I remember it. But on my 18\" birthday, I went to\nthe draft board and say hey, here I am. And they took only six weeks to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 call me up. I had wanted, in \u2014 the year before \u2014 you know, this stuff tortured\nme. I mean, I wasn\u2019t necessarily always a happy camper, because I was tortured byJanuary 12, 2016\nwhat was going on, and here I was free, and now the other people were dying over\nthere. So that really was \u2014 it really worked on me. I wanted to join the free French\nforces, and my dad said, if you do, you never have to come back to my house. And\nof course, you have to understand, he had been \u2014 what he had gone through, between\nthe jail and the \u2014 and Les Milles and Gurs, there were part of his \u2014 part of his brain\ndidn\u2019t like the French, because they hadn\u2019t been nice to him.",
        "A: They hadn\u2019t been.",
        "A: And so I understand that, but s \u2014 but I \u2014 I joined the army, basically right after I\nwas 18, and went to basic training, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and then they send\nme to \u2014I was a radio operator \u2014 they send me to radio school in Oklahoma for four\nmonths, because I was so good at that, they were going to use me. And then they\nsend me back to \u2014 then they assign me to an artillery outfit back in Fort Bragg,\nNorth Carolina. And that\u2019s when I decided enough was enough, this was stupid, the\narmy didn\u2019t know what it was doing, and I \u2014 I was fluent in French and German, I\nwasn\u2019t doing anybody any good in the South Pacific as \u2014 as a radio operator in a\nheavy artillery outfit. And so on \u2014 I \u2014 after Oklahoma they gave me a leave, on the\nway to North Carolina. And as only, you know, you have to be determined, but\nwhat could they do to me? I was a private, they couldn\u2019t demote me. So I \u2014 when I \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016\nI went to Washington, | got off the train, I went to the Pentagon, and I asked to\nspeak to somebody in intelligence, and I \u2014I got to si \u2014 it was the day after a holiday\n\u2014I got to see a lieutenant colonel who was very, very nice, and I told him my story,\ntold him what I just told you, and I said, you know, this is absolutely a waste in time.\nHe said, well \u2014 he went somewhere, then he came back, said well, you know, the \u2014\nthe boss isn\u2019t here today, he has the day off.

And you just go to North Carolina, and just don\u2019t say anything to anybody,\njust do what you\u2019re told to do, and you\u2019ll hear from us. And boy did \u2014 he was as\ngood as his word.",

And he said, Ho-Hockley, I \u2014 you gotta come\nwith me, I got a little place for you. I said, oh? I acted very innocent. And he said \u2014\nthen he said, well, we got classified orders from Washington that you have to leave\nright away. And of course, I knew what it was all about, but I didn\u2019t admit it.

There was a policy there that they wouldn\u2019t send you \u2014\nthey couldn\u2019t send you overseas, like Germany especially, if you weren\u2019t an\nAmerican citizen, because if the Germans caught you, they could string you up, you\nknow.

And they \u2014 they taught \u2014 well, languages you knew,\nbut they had all kinds of odd characters there, from PhDs to privates like me.\nAnybody who knew any languages, they \u2014 they got there, and they trained them in\nsuch things as prisoner of war interrogation, just military intelligence analysis, order\nof battle. Order of battle is try to get complete records of the organization of the\nenemy military, so that if you knew that the second Panzer division was coming at\nyou, you knew that the commanding general had to be so and so, and you n \u2014 you\nbuilt up records to know the weaknesses and the strengths of the commanders, and\nthings like that.

Germany\nwas afterwards. So they trained me in French MII, French Military Intelligence\nInterrogation. And then they \u2014 they shifted me to \u2014 when we didn\u2019t need people in\nFrance any more, they shifted me to \u2014 to German. And they \u2014 and then they \u2014 they\nput me through \u2014 yeah, first they \u2014 when the French was over, they put me in the\naerial photo interpretation, which didn\u2019t make any sense, because that\u2019s not what I\nwas there for. And so then they \u2014 they made me work in the officers\u2019 mess for \u2014 after\nI graduated the basic course, which is general in nature, they \u2014 they had me work in\nthe officers\u2019 mess for a few months.

And \u2014 and they \u2014 they\ngave us \u2014 they gave us a map, which was not in English, and they made us find our\nway back, which was interesting.

And we never saw the ship until we got\noff it. It was so big, they made us go in the side of the hold in New York, and you\nnever saw where you are in this thing.

And then they took us over to France. And in France they\nfirst send us to some replacement depot for a short time. And then \u2014I was \u2014 I and my\ngroup of people, there were a few of us, were sent to a villa outside of Paris, in Le\nV\u00e9sinet, which was, for Europe, the \u2014 the intelligence assignment center. And I was\n\u2014 I was picked up from there by a colonel who was part of the staff of the Bremen\nport command. They were planning to open the port of Bremerhaven for allied\ntroops, when the war was over. And so that\u2019s where that started. I was in Paris \u2014 I\nmean, you know, that\u2019s not \u2014 that wasn\u2019t my plan, but I was in Paris on \u2014 on eight\nMay, *45 \u2014",

        "A: About \u2014 about 10 th \u2014 yeah, about \u2014 about a decade. Probably 11 years. I\u2014I got\nthere about the 10\" of May, \u201945.",
        "A: Interesting question. I had feelings. I hated all Germans at the point \u2014 at that\npoint. Germany was basically on its knees. It was 65 percent destroyed in most\nplaces, not in all places, but we drove up to Bremen, all the way through Germany,\nwest \u2014 West Germany. And every city we came to was as flat as a pancake. In order\nJanuary 12, 2016\nto get a truck to get through Kassel, Germany, you had to have a bulldozer in front\nof you to push the rubble aside, so that the truck could go through. And Bremen wa\n\u2014 we went to, was 65 percent destroyed. And the Germans that were there, they\nkicked them out of the houses, so they could house us. And I don\u2019t know where they\nwent. Some \u2014 sometimes they stayed in the basement. But the \u2014 I \u2014 my motto was to\nkeep my distance. They had a fraternization \u2014 non-fraternization order that you\ncouldn\u2019t associate socially with G.I.s, which didn\u2019t last very long. The order lasted,\nbut the factual part of it didn\u2019t last very long. And \u2014 but I personally, you know,\nthere are a few things that happened that \u2014 or some \u2014 I was pretty well known,\nbecause every German that worked for us had to go ba \u2014 past me to get a security\nclearance, and se-security pass. So everybody who worked for the Americans, knew\nme. And so they established a \u2014 we established for the G.I.s, you had to do\nsomething, in their spare time, whatever that was, they established a club called the\nShangri-La, and \u2014 which was \u2014 and you were permitted to take girls there, because\nthey had music, you could dance.",
        "A: Yeah. And I \u2014I was approached there by \u2014 it wasn\u2019t immediately, but a few\nmonths later by one young lady that knew me, and she came over to my table, and\nshe said \u2014 I don\u2019t know what she called me, Mr. Hockley, or Corporal Hockley \u2014 IJanuary 12, 2016\nwas a corporal by then. The \u2014 I noticed that you never sit with anybody else except\nG.I.s, and you don\u2019t dance, and so on.",
        "A: And I said, look, I don\u2019t want to discuss it. I\u2014 I \u2014 my family \u2014 you know, there\nwas the whole story, my family was treated very badly by the Germans, and I don\u2019t \u2014\nI don\u2019t have to associate socially. And so she broke out in tears. Then her boyfriend\ncame over and \u2014 and chewed me out for making his girlfriend cry. But th \u2014 you\nknow, every German you met in 1945 had a cousin in the United States.",
        "A: The \u2014 that was the way of getting \u2014 there are a lot of people that fraternized, all\nthe way up the line. Not just the privates, and so on, the officers, too. It was a policy\ncondemned to failure. But for me, it was fine. I didn\u2019t go there to become friends\nwith anybody. I was very fair in everything I did. I didn\u2019t mistreat anybody, I just\ndid my job, and that was it. But I didn\u2019t want to \u2014 there\u2019s no way that I could socially\nbe active with Germans, if I didn\u2019t know who they were. And that \u2014",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: Well, the first thing is the colonel \u2014 the colonel that picked me up was the fellow\nin charge of intelligence for the Bremen port command. So he was the G2\nJanuary 12, 2016\nintelligence officer, and I was on his staff. And the intelligence office had to issue\nsecurity passes, as much as you could check anybody. We had a big headquarters\nthat was in the middle of town. The air force didn\u2019t bomb it, so we\u2019d have a nice\nplace to stay. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true, by the way, and \u2014 because everything else was flat,\nexcept this wonderful building \u2014 it became our headquarters. And so everybody that\nworked in that headquarters, because we needed German \u2014 we couldn\u2019t do\neverything ourselves, we needed clerical staff, and so on. We, in our office, we had\nno German clerks, because it was security. But everybody else did. And so our office\nwas \u2014 had the job of \u2014 of getting them the passes. Since I was the only person in the\noffice who spoke German, it\u2019s \u2014 I was the contact guy. And they also \u2014 they send me\nup to Bremerhaven for a couple weeks to \u2014 to handle the security office at the \u2014 at\nthe port up there. And I did that for, I would say until October, give or take. And\nthen, I had, at Ritchie, I had the \u2014 Ritchie was a weird place. When you finished\nyour course \u2014 I was in the 24\" class, if that\u2019s of any interest \u2014 that up to the 24\"\nclass, when you graduated from Ritchie, you \u2014 they either prom \u2014 they promoted\nyou to corporal, sergeant, or second lieutenant. And they promoted me to nothing.\nStarting with the 24\" class, no more promotions. So, what they \u2014 they took some\npeople, and \u2014 who wanted to be officers, and they sent them \u2014 they send them to\nFort Benning, Georgia, on \u2014 to take the quick course, the 90 day wonder \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow if you ever heard that expression \u2014 the \u2014\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, 90 day wonder. They \u2014 they \u2014 they take these guys, they send them to Fort\nBenning, make them infantry officers in 90 days, which usually it took six months,\nor whatever. And so you could go from Ritchie to Benning to become a 90 day\nwonder, and then come back as a second lieutenant, they had that, too. With the 24\"\nclass, because of the \u2014 how far the war had progressed, they didn\u2019t do that any more.\nSo I went in the war as a private. But then, once I was over there, they \u2014 they \u2014 well,\nthey promoted me to corporal, and I \u2014 I had also applied at Ritchie to join the\ncounter-intelligence corps, because that\u2019s what I wanted. I wanted to catch Nazis.\nThat\u2019s what they were doing. But they told me I was too young, so I didn\u2019t get into\nthe CIC, you had to be older. But then, once I was in Bremen, and I applied again to\nget into the counter-intelligence corps, and they accepted me. So, in the last six\nmonths I was over there, I became a special agent of the counter-intelligence corps,\nno insignia of rank, just two U.S.s, so that you could go to see some colonel, and\nchew him about what somebody in his outfit was doing, and without him knowing\nwhat your rank was, even though if you were 20 years old, they knew that you\nweren\u2019t a general. So, I sa \u2014I\u2014I did that. And it\u2019s actually as a result of that, that I \u2014\nultimately when I was in Syracuse University, I got a commission military\nintelligence, because the gentleman that \u2014 before I left, when my time wa \u2014 came to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n147January 12, 2016\ngo home, I was interviewed by a colonel from intelligence headquarters in the\nStates, asked me if I wouldn\u2019t stay as a warrant officer, or as an officer. And I said\nno, I\u2014I \u2014I\u2019d like to, but I\u2014 I \u2014I want to go to college, I got to finish college, that\u2019s\nmy first thing. But when I was at Syracuse in \u00b048, I got a letter from the same\ncolonel, he didn\u2019t know the c \u2014 the con \u2014 the connection, but he said, we\u2019re\ninterested, if you would like to become a second lieutenant, military intelligence\nreserve, and he gave me the conditions. And you had to have been a staff sergeant,\nwhen I was a sergeant, which is one rank below the staff sergeant. So I wrote him\nback and I say, well, colonel, I appreciate, but I\u2019m only a sergeant, I\u2019m not a staff\nsergeant, so I don\u2019t qualify. But, if you are interested in knowing whether you think\nthat I am qualified, if you\u2019re the same Colonel Stevens that came to Bremen,\nGermany and interviewed me in \u201946, and asked me to accept a commission, then\nyou must know that I am qualified, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have interviewed me.\nAnd he send me the same paper back, handwritten on there, I\u2019m the same guy, you\u2019ll\nhear from me. And about three or four weeks later, I got a handwritten note from\nhim, and says, apply under army regulation so and so, so and so. I did, and within six\nmonths I was a second lieutenant, military intelligence reserve.",
        "A: Yeah.January 12, 2016",
        "A: Oh yeah. It was lots of fun.",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 they had \u2014 they had the allies put out a \u2014 an order at the end of the\nwar, they \u2014 they had \u2014 first of all, they had an automatic arrest category, that meant if\na German, a Nazi was more than something in the Nazi movement, it required that if\nyou found him, that you arrest him.",
        "A: And \u2014 and then they had a category of the next ones down were \u2014 they couldn\u2019t\nget certain jobs. And then you do \u2014 there were the ones that you exonerated, and so\nthe CIC had the job of denazification. They had to \u2014 they got all the records of\npeople who applied for \u2014 for something, or that came across our \u2014 for one thing,\nacross our path, and they had to have them fill out the famous fragebogen, which\nevery German had to fill out, in which he said, you know, where he had been, when,\nwhere he went to school, did he join the Nazi party, didn\u2019t he join the Nazi party,\nand etcetera.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: Well, most of them joined the Nazi party, but they were unimportant. They were\nnot functionaries, they were just members, because they had to maintain their job, or\nsomething. There\u2019s some truth to that.",
        "A: A\u2014a-\u20141if you wanted to be a teacher, probably, you had to be a member of the\nparty. Now, that da \u2014 didn\u2019t mean how \u2014 how active you were or not, you just \u2014 it\nwas just a ticket that you had to punch. There are people who never did it, and\nsurvived, but it just depended how much they \u2014 they trusted the system, or they\nneeded to eat. So they were not all \u2014 if they joined the Nazi party, they \u2014 we\ndetermined they weren\u2019t all bad people. We \u2014 we found all kinds of people, you\nknow, it \u2014 it \u2014 you never quite knew what was going to hit you next. There are two\nthings I might mention, wi \u2014 part of that period. I \u2014 they \u2014 my office was right next\nto the jail there, we had a jail, American jail. And \u2014 which a friend of mine was the\ncommandant. And so I \u2014 I went to that jail all the time, to interrogate people. And\nsomebody brought to my attention that there was a guy \u2014 denunciation was the order\nof the day. I devised my own questionnaire, and then I made people fill out that were\nbrought into my office. And I made them fill that out before I would talk to them.\nAnd the first question was, what\u2019s your name, date of birth, and profession. And who\n\u2014 who do you want to talk to me about? And if the guy was a butcher, and he wanted\n150January 12, 2016\nto talk to me about a butcher, I knew that he was trying to get the competition out of\nthe way.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, it \u2014 it was a big deal. Because people had nothing, so they \u2014 they used\ndenunciation in order to get themselves in a better position. So \u2014 but there was this\none guy, I found out \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I was given a tip, there was a guy who was\nthere, and he was \u2014 had the rank of so and so, which made him part of your\nautomatic arrest category. And so \u2014 but then \u2014 then I \u2014 yeah, so I \u2014 he had just been\nreleased from our prison. So I figured out that they didn\u2019t know who he was, so they\nreleased him. So, I decided to arrest him. But being a nice guy, I decided that he\u2019d\nbeen in jail for, I don\u2019t know how long, and he was spending the night with his\ngirlfriend, so I decided, well, let him have one night, and a \u2014 they had a curfew, from\nsi\u2014 10 in the \u2014 10 in the evening til six in the morning. So I\u2014 we didn\u2019t do the\narresting ourselves, we charged the German police with that. So I gave orders to\nhave him arrested at 5:30. And \u2014 and they brought him to the prison, and then they\nbrought him over to my office. And in the meantime I found out \u2014 I didn\u2019t find out at\nfirst, but I found out that he had \u2014 we had had him, and we released him. And I say,\nJanuary 12, 2016\nwell, there\u2019s something wrong here. So I\u2014 I said to myself, how do I address this?\nWe released him yesterday, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we\u2019re re-arresting him. And so, when he came in my office, I mean, I never\nforgot this, because up to this point, nobody had ever said to me that they had been a\nNazi of any consequence. And this guy, when he walked in, he sat down in my\noffice. The first question I ask him \u2014 don\u2019t ask me why, I \u2014 you know, you do things\nin life, you don\u2019t know why you do them. You think you know why you do them. I\nsaid to him, until when were you a Nazi? I did this because of the information I had\nin front of me. And his answer was, oh, I\u2019m still a Nazi. And I have to tell you, I\nalmost fell off my chair, because nobody had ever said they were a Nazi, you know\u2019?\nAnd so I said, oh, I said to myself, well that\u2019s interesting, I gotta \u2014 this one I want to\nhear. And he was there, I had him in there about two, three hours. I just wanted to \u2014 I\nwanted to figure this out, what \u2014 what\u2019s the deal? And he told me, you know, I can\nspare you the details, but he told me that \u2014 that hit] \u2014 what Hitler wanted for\nGermany was important because the Germans needed a leader, they needed a\nfuehrer to lead them, etcetera, but he made mistakes, like he should never have\ntouched the Jews, and a few other things like that, and \u2014 but, in principle he still be-\nbelieved in the philosophical principle of the fuehrer, the leader running the country,\nthe people don\u2019t know, otherwise, what to do.\nJanuary 12, 2016",
        "A: And so, I finally, you know, I remanded him to prison, because it said on paper\nthat I had to, but \u2014",

And there was a co \u2014 marine colonel at a meeting in Houston, came\nup with the werewolves, the \u2014 the guys in Iraq being like the werewolves, and I\nsaid, it\u2019s just \u2014 let me stand up here and tell you, it\u2019s a damn lie.

        "A: Well, my initial reaction \u2014 initial initial, in Bremen, was exemplified by the\nfollowing; I walked down the street in Bremen one day, and there was a man\nbeating his kid. And I was in American uniform. And I walked up to him and said,\nstop it. We\u2019re bringing democracy to you, in a democracy you don\u2019t beat your kid on\nthe street. That was my immediate reaction. How do you get to the Germans? How\ndo you get them away from this business of \u2014 of punishment, of \u2014 of beating, of\nharshness, and so on? So, all I could do at that moment was that. Gradually, the\nyoung generation, you \u2014 you know, there \u2014 you had to wait for a while. Germany\nwas rebuilt amazingly fast, thanks to the Marshall Plan, and many other things. And\nthe Germans are, undoubtedly, very astute, and \u2014 what\u2019s the word I\u2019m trying to think\nof \u2014 people. They \u2014 they work very hard, to this day. There are always exceptions,\nbut generally speaking. They\u2019re well organized, they \u2014 they keep their nose to the\nerindstone, and \u2014 and they were lucky with the initial governments they got, you \u2014\nyou know, when you get a Konrad Adenauer, who was no pansy, who \u2014 who \u2014\nwho ran Germany pretty harshly, but that built everything up, and then he was\nfollowed by Erhard to fix the economy, and then of course, you had Willy Brandt,\nwho was a socialist, and brought a lot of social things to Germany. They \u2014 they had\nsome very good leaders. I can\u2019t think of one chancellor of Germany that was really\nbad. They had a couple of presidents, but presidents don\u2019t matter. They\u2019re \u2014 they\nwere figureheads, like the queen of England. It\u2019s the chancellors who run the show.\nJanuary 12, 2016\nSo, gradually the young generations there, they went through all kinds of stuff. The\nuniversities tended to be very liberal, to use a kind word. And so a lot of the students\ngot pretty left-wingish. But gradually, this stuff was drummed into them, what it is\nlike to be in democracy, and what \u2014 what happened is they \u2014 they \u2014 because there\u2019s\nbeen such a tremendous change in the way the world operates, that all they want \u2014\nthe young people want to do is go \u2014 come to America, or France, or \u2014 you know,\nthey been \u2014 they were locked up in Germany, they couldn\u2019t get out of Germany,\nunder Hitler. And so it \u2014 suddenly, there was some freedom of travel, and they saw\nthat there were other societies, that weren\u2019t as bad as they were made out to be. And\nthe people went to Brittany on vacation, instead of staying in Germany, saw that it\nwas nice in Brittany, or wherever they went. Half of Germany\u2019s been to \u2014 to the\nCanary Islands, and to Spain, because \u2014 because they love the sun, primarily, but\nthat\u2019s another \u2014 another world down there. So they \u2014 they \u2014 they passed a\nconstitution, which is very democracy oriented, and they have a Supreme Court that\nis enforcing it. And it\u2019s not always to our liking, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. I \u2014I\nalways try to take people for who \u2014 the individual qualities, and what they were like,\nand their \u2014 I said, I met a lot of nice people.
