I heard my parents talking but always in their bedroom with the doors clo -- with the door\nclosed, so we didn\u2019t know what -- what\u2019s going on there. I mean, their discussions. My mother\nloved very much my father, that I know. And my father was very polite, never -- you know,\nnever raised his voice. And but they had discussions but each one political or something else, I\ndon\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know.

        "A: I was sure that I am Jewish, because I attended a Yiddish school, and I was sure that to be a\nJew it doesn\u2019t mean to be a religious Jew.

I didn\u2019t look -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s maybe strange to say that here, but the\nEuropean Jews have a special look, and I was blonde, and you can see not dark eyes. I looked -- I\ndidn\u2019t look like a Jewish girl. And my -- my brother -- my brother was black hair, black eyes,\nand -- and th -- because our school didn\u2019t work on Saturday, so we were -- 1t was open on\nSundays. So we usually went on Sundays with our bags, school bags, to school. And that was a\nreason to fight. So I don\u2019t know, nobody f-fought me, but my brother. And it was a time when he\nhad in his pocket, a castet, I don\u2019t know how it is in English, it\u2019s like an iron thing what you put\nyour fingers there.",
        "Q: Brass knuckles.",
        "A: Yeah. And that what you can fight back. And -- and it was a time when he didn\u2019t walk from\nschool to -- to home. Usually we walked it, 1t was not so far, but we didn't have a car of course, it\nwas very seldom they were having a car, it was a big luxury. So, he went by bus from school\nhome, and he -- he didn\u2019t get off on the right stop, but a stop after that, and went home from\nanother side because a group of guys were waiting for him on the corner of our street, and the\nother streets.

        "A: Yeah, yeah. Yeah it was not a big mixture of nationalities there, it was a very big percentage\nJews, and -- and that -- probably 25 percent of the population of Wilna are Jewish. So then it was\na little bit of White Russian, and a little bit Lithuanian. And mostly they are Poles.",
        "Q: Did you and Joseph ever talk about that, about how to protect yourselves in these situations?",
        "A: No. I mean, I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember. There were other things what I remember. I\nremember walking through the streets near university and looking at the [indecipherable] house,\non -- on the windows, how the students, the Jewish students were standing on the lectures, not\nsitting. Yeah. It was a protest because some of the Polish students decided that Polish students\nhave to sit separately on the one side, and it was left the other side of the whole auditorium was\nleft for the Jews -- Jewish students. So the Jewish student decided no, they will not sit separately,\nthey will stand. So they stand, all lectures they were standing behind the benches there, that they\n[indecipherable]. Then they had an -- a church, and it was to go through the church, it was like a\n-- a gate, yeah? And so Jewish people are walking through, if it\u2019s winter they were wearing the\nhats. So -- and the Catholics had to remove their hats. So, if you don\u2019t remove their -- your hats,\nyou are beaten and remove the hat from -- such things. But I had friends, Polish also. I played\nwith them in the streets and the -- if I heard something like bad, like they are cursing me or\nsomething, so I used to stand, I remember, in our -- the gate of our garden with stones and waited\nfor them. And they knew it [indecipherable]. Pll not let them walk through without throwing the\nstones to them. So they were a little bit afraid of me. But they were little also. I didn\u2019t have to do\nthis big guys, of course. Little like me, 10 - 11 -12 years old, you know.",

        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: I remember her always smiling [indecipherable] nice looking girl. And my brother was more\ninvolved in it than I, yeah. Yeah. I think that the love started from there. They were 16 probably\nor so. And I was 11, so that I -- he was 16, and she --",

        "A: I don\u2019t think we spoke a lot before the war. I don\u2019t think so. When I finished my six year\nschool, it was a -- the first -- how it\u2019s called in English, oh my God, elementary school. When I\nfinished the elementary school, I went to the same gymnasium where Rachel was, and my\nbrother. So there I saw them more often together. Otherwise I -- I was not very close to her\nbefore the war.",
        "Q: Did your parents know each other?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",

        "Q: Can you talk a bit about that, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The war started with Poland. Yeah, it\u2019s true. It was in September \u201939 when\nthe war started. And we felt it immediately. Immediately it was a shortage of food. In the stores\nline -- people were lined up to buy food. I remember that I don\u2019t know how, in the kitchen I saw\na whole sack of sugar, salt and something else, kasha or something else, I don\u2019t know. And --",
        "Q: What did that mean to see that?",
        "A: It -- 1t meant that it can be a [indecipherable] and they are ready to eat. And then I had a\nfriend, a boyfriend. His parents had a bakery, and we run to the bakery with him. And I saw a big\nline, people waiting for the bread, and we went to ano -- for -- from another side inside the\nbakery. And he used to take a big loaf of br -- of bread, yeah, and give me -- ha -- hot bread, and\nit smelled so good, and used to bring it home. And the lady who lived with us, who helped my\nmother, her name was Julia. She used to say, \u201cOh, my God, if Luda wants to eat, she has an\nappetite, it means it will be a hunger.\u201d I was never hungry when I was child. It was not -- my\nmother was crazy about me. Never hungry. I didn\u2019t want to eat, I -- I -- I don\u2019t remember feeling\nsomething that I want something. It will some --",

        "A: Yeah, of course --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- because I didn\u2019t eat enough. That\u2019s -- that -- that was that, yeah. I was very pale and very\nthin, and my mother was unhappy with it. But then the war started, and it was a shot at your foot,\nso I started to eat.",
        "Q: Do you remember your brother or your parents talking about the changes?",
        "A: I remember my mother. My mother was very -- can\u2019t say upset, because it\u2019s more than upset.\nShe was very unhappy with it. And fer -- we had books at home, books of -- books which\ndescribed the situation in Germany after Hitler come -- came to power. It was called, I remem --\nI remember it, the book was la -- lying on -- on the table in our room in -- in-in my bedroom. So\nit was called Brunatnec Shenga in Polish. Brunatnec, it means brown, because fascists had\nbrown, you know, shirts. And it was horrible. There -- there are pictures there about the\nconcentration camps already in Germany. At first. political concentration camp. Communist\nparty in Germany was very popular, and a lot of Germans were communists, so the first victims\nwere the communists of course, you know. And my mother -- my mother knew the Germans\nvery well. I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t think she was born in -- in -- in Germany. I th -- her mother\nwas born in Germany, so -- and they used to go to Germany every -- every summer, probably.\nAnd my mother knew the character of the Germans, so she told my father, I remember, we have\nto leave Wilna. We have to out of it. Go out of Europe. I hate it. He didn\u2019t want. He didn\u2019t want.\nShe wanted to emigrate, to the States, to Canada, to Australia, but not to stay in Europe. That\u2019s it.\nThat was it, yeah. That why I remember it. And -- but we waited the Germans to come to -- to\nWilna in 1939 already, because Polish army couldn\u2019t stand -- couldn\u2019t protect Poland, was too\nweak. Poles are very good soldiers actually, but they didn\u2019t have the tanks, they didn\u2019t have the\nequipment the -- the Germans had, so -- but the Russian came before. They occupied Wilna, they\noccupied all the -- the best, Belaru --White Russia, Belarusia, White Russia and Ukraine. So we\nfound ourselves in -- occupied by Russians. What was better than by Germans, of course. It was\nprobably two, three months m -- the Russians were in Wilna, the hosts of Wilna, ba -- but then\nthey gave it to Lithuania. The day the Lithuanians wanted to take over Wilna was a fight between\nthe Poles and -- the Polish -- the remnants of the Polish army and the Lithuanian army. But the\nfight was very, very short. And suddenly they decided that it has to be a pogrom. They have to --\nto kill Jews. We don\u2019t know why. Couldn\u2019t understand why. What has it to do with -- with pola -\n- with Poland and Lithuania? They were always tense. There were no diplomatic relationships\nbetween pola -- Poland and Lithuania before, even. So the day the Lithuanian occupied -- no,\ntook over Wilna, so it was a pogrom. I was at home, my mother didn\u2019t allow me to go to school,\nbut my son -- my brother was 1-in school, and she was so nervous about it. And -- and then it was\nthe whole day, broken glasses, and so on and so on. But then I think that a delegation of Jewish\npeople went to the Russians, who gave the city to Lithuanian. But they had a place where they\njust -- they were -- that their armia was standing there, together with their tanks and everything.\nSo the Jews went there and asked them for helping us. And they decided -- the Russians decided\nto go with the tanks through the streets. And that was enough. They didn\u2019t do anything, they\ndidn't kill anybody, they didn\u2019t -- the Russians I mean. They went through the streets with their\ntanks, and it was quiet, quiet. It\u2019s a -- quiet down everybody. Then my brother came back from\nschool, late in the evening. He -- he told us that they barricaded the windows and the doors with\n[indecipherable] the tables they had in the classes. And they were waiting. Nothing special. Was\nno killed people, no, nothing. Only the -- the windows were broken. That is -- that what I\nremember, the beginning of -- of the war. And then they were almost a year -- yeah, then the\nLithuanian were -- they started learning Lithuanian -- the Lithuanian language at school, and --\nanother language. We had a lot of languages in school. Had Yiddish, Polish, Hebrew, German\nand then Lithuanian, instead of --",
        "Q: How did the atmosphere changed when the Lithuanians were in charge?",
        "A: You know, that was for change that stores were -- special stores were open, Lithuanian stores,\nLithuanian companies came over. Interesting that the Polish president, the portrait of the Polish\npresident was gone from the wall in our classroom, and the Lithuanian sign is -- their official\nsign is a -- a horse, and -- don\u2019t remember [indecipherable] there. A horseman, who has a horse\nwith a sword, I think, something like that.",
        "Q: A man on a horse?",
        "A: Yeah, a man on a horse, yeah. Oh, and that was on the wall. So I remember such a thing, that\nwe decided to open the windows, that was in winter, we decided to open the windows in the\nclassroom, and it was before the language of -- oh, oh -- the lesson of the Lithuanian language,\nthe teacher came in, said, \u201cIt\u2019s so cold, why didn\u2019t you open the li -- why did you open the li --\nthe windows?\u201d So we said, \u201cThe horse is stinking.\u201d Suddenly, we became Polish patriots. We --\nwe played with the Polish children in the street, and we used to -- to throw on the sidewalks a -- a\n-- the Lithuanian money, with the sign of their horse, and to beat it. And to -- and to say, go to\nKovno, go back to Kovno, go back to Kovno. Kovno was their capital. They made Wilna the\ncapital after that. Capital of Lithuania. Well, that was -- we became one block with the Poles\nagainst the Lithuanian. Why? I don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t ask me, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: What were your parents saying to Joseph about continuing to go to school, or were there any\nsafeguards being made? You know, if this happens, don\u2019t come home, or was there any talk like\nthat? Sort of beginning to prepare to -- for -- for trouble?",
        "A: For --",
        "Q: In any way?",
        "A: At what time you\u2019re asking it?",
        "Q: A-At this time, when the Lithuanians -- after the day long pogrom with the Lithuanians and\nwhen your brother had to be barricaded inside the school.",
        "A: After that was quiet and -- it was quiet until the -- the World War II came to us. It was quiet,\nyeah. Then, after -- how long was a -- a reign of the Lithuanian was a half a year, or a year? A\nyear, almost a year. Then the Russians decided to occupy the whole Lithuania. They gave them\nWilna, but they occupied the whole, you know. And then it was Russia already. In 1940 was\nRussia, until -- and in ninete -- 1941 when the World War started, yeah.",
        "Q: Was there a time when you noticed the Russians took control back and you had to learn\nRussian in school again during this period?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t care about it because I spoke Russian and it was my language [indecipherable]. So,\nbut the year when the Russians were there, this year, was not a bad year for Jewish people. A lot\nof Jewish school, Yiddish schools were open, yes, but I -- I -- I have to say that the Hebrew\nschools were closed, I don\u2019t know why. They were against the Hebrew, everything what was\nHebrew was not good. And of course, religious people suffered. But Yiddish secular schools\nwere -- a lot of Jewish secular schools were open, and we had a lot -- much more students in our\ngymnasium than before.",
        "Q: Oh, the students would come from the closed schools and go to yours?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Not only that, but ther -- th -- 1t was a part of very poor people, who couldn\u2019t\nafford to pay for school. That\u2019s why their children were at home, I don\u2019t know, looking for a job,\nlooking for something. I don\u2019t know what they were doing, but they couldn\u2019t attend schools. And\nthen, when the Russians came, the schools were for free. And not only that, but every child had\nto be at school. Had to be at school. So they came, and they were -- we have so many students.\nThat was -- for the poor people was much better.",
        "Q: And -- and the stores, were they similar, for instance, your friend\u2019s bakery, was that a Jewish\nbakery?",
        "A: Yeah, it was a Jewish bakery.",
        "Q: Did it remain open, was -- wi -- were the -- was the Jewish family still in charge of it?",
        "A: No. No, everything -- in [indecipherable] were not in charge of our house. Everything was\ngone to the government. The government took over everything. Yeah, that\u2019s -- yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: But you were still in your house?",
        "A: Yes. [indecipherable] we are still in our house, yeah. Some were -- wanted us to go out of the\nhouse and to take over the house, it was a problem there. But we stayed in the house, and my\nfather had the same position, but the technical -- Yiddish technical -- Jewish technical school was\na part of the pole -- Polish technical school. It means they were like one school, but one was total\n-- that stu -- Polish students were taught in Polish and the e -- Jews in -- in Yiddish. But my\nfather was this -- had the -- had the same position still, this year.",
        "Q: And do you remember seeing Rachel during this period, was Rachel seeing Joseph, your\nbrother?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, because we are at school. I was already the first grade of gymnasium. But the\nschool was -- was renamed, it was already not a gymnasium, but a high -- but a high school, and\nI was not in the first grade of the gymnasium, but I was in the fifth grade of that 10 years school -\n- high school. It was a 10 years high school. But --",
        "Q: Did your parents -- as things shifted, did your parents ever discuss again, leaving? Did your\nmother push that issue?",
        "A: I think that yeah. But 1 -- I don\u2019t think that it could be done already, it was too late. It was too\nlate, because I don\u2019t think the Russians would allow us to go out. Poland didn\u2019t exist already.\nPart of the -- of Poland was Germany, and part Russia, that\u2019s it. So, but she talked about it, yeah.\nShe talked about it. But she didn\u2019t know how to do it over there, they said she was -- it\u2019s a --\nproblem of immigration was closed for us, it\u2019s [indecipherable]. But a friend of mine, who was\nthe same class, and his mother was a teacher of our school, their -- his father immigrated to the\nStates. He went to Europe for a conference in 1939, but before the war started, before September.\nHe went there with [indecipherable] oldest son. He was in Belgium, I think. And when the war\nstarted, he took a ship and he went to ton -- to the States, America. Then he send the papers to\n[indecipherable] his w-wife and the other son to come, and they received the visa. And they were\nthe -- the only people who -- who\u2019d leave Russia because they had already the visa, then\nLithuanian were there. So they were allowed to go. And he\u2019s still in the States, my friend.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: At that point was there ever any thought that the ru -- that the Germans might come into\nVilnius?",
        "A: Of course, yes. We were sure that it will -- the war stop, it will not remain like that. It was like\neverything was -- fe-felt temporary. That today is like that, tomorrow can be changed everything,\nyeah. It was not stable. Anything was not.",
        "Q: It sounds anything but stable.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And then we -- it was -- we finished school, I had -- we planned to go to -- leave\nfor vacation, and the bombs started to fall on Wilna, and my mother told my father immediately,\nwe have to run for Russia. And he didn\u2019t want because he had a sister there. A sister who was\nolder than he was and she was like a mother for him. The mother was sick then, he was the\nyoungest boy -- y-youngest child in his family and she was taking care of him. So he didn\u2019t -- he\ndidn\u2019t want to leave without her. So he used to go to her -- to her apartment, to ask her to leave\nwith them, and she didn\u2019t want. Her husband was in the States already. He visited his brother in\n1938, and the -- the war started and he couldn\u2019t come back. So he was in the States. So she was\nalone with one daughter, and she told [indecipherable] we are not communists, and we are not\nmen, who will touch us? People were so naive. Oh, that\u2019s all the communist propaganda what\nyou know, that is not true. Hitler is -- we know ge -- we know Germans. Germans were here in\nthe first World War, and they were not so bad, we can survive with it, and so he didn't want to\nleave his [indecipherable] until the second day of the war. My mother packed his -- her bag.\nThey gave me a bag, a small bag, he gave -- she gave my brother a small bag and she told my\nfather goodbye. We are running, and you want to stay with your sister, stay. So he went with us.\nBut it was too late. It was too late. We went to the station, we found [indecipherable] train and\nwe went -- the train started to go, but then it were -- it was bombed. It -- it was a horrible story\nwith the train. [indecipherable] with the train was put on hold in the middle of the f -- the forest.\nStop it.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: So, talking about a train that it stopped in -- in the middle of the forest, and I didn\u2019t mention\nthat the train was full, people who were running from the Germans. A lot of them were soldiers\nand officers from the Red army, Soviet army, with families. And the others were Jews, and\n[indecipherable] communists who wanted to run from the fascists. But the civilian were mostly\nJews, and a small group of Lithuanian, yeah. So -- and the train was s-stopped before the old\nborder of Soviet Union because we were still on the occupied pass of the -- the Lithuanian\nterritory and the White Russia territory who belonged to Poland and was occupied by the\nGermans as I told before, after the -- the -- after the war start with Poland. And so the train\nstopped before the old Soviet border, and they -- the -- it was the -- the army who was -- the\nSoviet army that -- not that -- it was the encoverdere army. It was not KGB, but it was a part of\nit, like. They told everybody has to leave the train, but that the women has to leave on the right\nside of the train, and the military man with the families -- with their families on the left side.\nThen they closed all the windows and the doors from the right side where we were standing.\nThey opened the doors for the left side, they let in the military men together with their families,\nand that\u2019s it. And they went. The train started to roll -- to go, and we started to cry and to ask and\nto shout and to -- don\u2019t leave us, and the train left. Then I looked around, the forest was full with\nluggage. Nobody to-took the luggage, they throw out and the people didn\u2019t know what to do,\nthey started to walk to the border. And I remember my father coming to the border, showed his\npassport and told him that he was a -- a member already of a union, and that wa -- there are my\ndocuments. No, no, you are spies. Everything na -- we were -- we didn\u2019t have the passports of\nthe Soviet Union. We were not citizens of the Soviet Union, we were the citizens of the country\nLithuania, who was occupied by the Soviets, but they didn\u2019t change the passports yet, the\ncitizenships yet. They couldn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t let us in. Then we -- we made kilometers and\nkilometers during the day. We walked -- it was such a hot summer like -- like this summer, 1941\nsummer was very hot. And I remember my mother and -- complained that she cannot walk so\nlong in that. And then at night we came to a place and we found a house open and empty already,\nno people. So we -- my father decided we have to rest there. We came in together with another\nfamily, and in the middle of the night came a peasant, a Polish peasant, or a White Russian\npeasant, I don\u2019t know, and said you have to run, because there are German parachutists already\nhere. So you have to run. So the other family took the -- the bag, they -- one bag of -- of -- the\nlight bags because the big bags were left behind. So, and they run. And my father, like a\nmathematician, he told, look, if it\u2019s true that there are Germans all over here, so it\u2019s\n[indecipherable] to run. If it\u2019s not true, so we will start in the morning, we have to rest. And that\nwas too late already. When -- 1n a war, every minute counts. The other family found a -- a bus\nand they were safe. And they survived the war. I met them after the war, that was -- yeah. And\nwe were caught by the Germans. And that\u2019s it, and we decided to go back.",
        "Q: How -- how were you caught by the Germans?",
        "A: In the morning we went farther and we entered a small village. We found there a Jewish\nfamily who let us come in and have a little bit water, a tea, I don\u2019t remember even if it was food.\nNo, I don\u2019t remember, it was a horrible time. And -- and suddenly the Germans come -- came in\nwith -- on tanks and motorcycles and they occupied the village, and at once started the pogrom.\nPogrom. The neighbors came and took over everything from the -- from the people who -- who\nallowed us to stay, and our things also, our belongings that -- our belongings were three small\nbags, like. And that\u2019s it, and it was finished. Then the Germans took my brother to dig some\nholes, I don\u2019t know, they took him. And they told my mother that they will -- he will come back\nin two hours or something. We waited for two hours and he didn\u2019t come back so my mother went\nto them. It\u2019s interesting that the roles of my father and my mother changed immediately when the\nwar started. She started to be the head of the family, not my father. She was -- before the war, he\nwas the head of the family, he was the person who brought that money to -- to the family, yeah,\nsupported the family, and she was a quiet lady, who loved books, to read a lot, and during the\nnight even. And that [indecipherable]. The roles chan -- changed. She started to be energetic,\nstarted -- concentrated and her German. Her German was her mo -- her mother tongue, of course.\nAnd she went to the Germans and they gave her the -- my -- back the brother -- the hale -- son.\nShe came back together with him, and she told, we have to go back home. Here we are strangers\nfrom -- nobody knows us and -- and -- and he -- and it was a long walk home. I don\u2019t remember\nwho told us don\u2019t go through the forest because you will be ar -- killed by the people, or the\npeasants there. You will be robbed, you will be killed and so on. So they decided to go along the\nhighways. So the German army was approaching, going deep to Russia, and we were going back\nto Lithuania to Wilna. Perhaps it\u2019s interesting, 1t was a false -- f-first front of the Germans. They\nwere soldiers, 1t was Wehrmacht. They didn\u2019t do any harm to us. First of all, they didn\u2019t know\nwho we are. They know that we are people who are -- run from them, but they didn't know we\nwere Jews or non-Jews, or -- and sometimes they threw us cigarettes, what my father was -- he --\nhe couldn\u2019t bear not to smoke, he was a smoker, and he -- it was like better than bread for him.\nYeah. And sometimes we went through a village, so they ask for water, so there were people\nwho didn\u2019t allow us in to take water. To come over and to take water. No food, no water.",
        "Q: How long were you there for?",
        "A: I think it was there two weeks, probably. I remember only one old lady, a peasant, asked us to\ncome in, and she gave us bread and milk. But it was unusual for us. Very unusual. She told, \u201cMy\nson is on the front fighting with the Germans, I don\u2019t know where he is, so maybe another family\nwill give him some bread.\u201d Then we came home. Of course, Wilna was occupied already for 10\ndays, or -- or -- I don\u2019t remember the day we came back, don\u2019t remember. And the lady th -- was\n-- who lived with us --",
        "Q: Julia?",
        "A: Julia was home, and she welcomed us, yeah. She was happy and pride [indecipherable]. Yeah.\nIt\u2019s a lot to -- to tell. The first was my brother, what my brother did, he wrote a letter to Rachel.\nAnd the only person who walked through the st -- streets was me. So he gave me the letter.\nRachel accused me that I probably read the letter, but I don\u2019t remember if I read it or not. I don\u2019t\nthink so.",
        "Q: Why were you the only one that walked through the street?",
        "A: The men didn\u2019t dare to walk the street, because it was very dangerous, they would be caught.\nMy mother didn\u2019t want it, so it just left me. I was 13 years old, and I went and pe -- we were in\nanother district, absolutely far from Rachel. I had to go through all the city, and the -- the most\ndangerous, I thought, dangerous place was a bridge, to cross a bridge because soldiers were\nalready standing there and guarding the bridge, the Germans soldiers of course, and I -- I\nremember coming over, saying mm-hm, [indecipherable] ask you for documents or not. I\ndecided to jump on one foot, like playing.",
        "Q: Skipping.",
        "A: I was thir -- yeah -- I was 13 years old, why not? I jumped -- I jumped through the bridge.\nAnd they looked at me and smiled. Then I run. Run again to her house. Now I have to bring back\n-- a letter back from her to my brother.",
        "Q: What was their reaction when you got to the house?",
        "A: Don\u2019t remember. I was so overwhelmed with the danger to cross city, that I don\u2019t re -- I think\nshe was happy and unhappy at the same time. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: How was the city different? You described the bridge, but as you walked through it, what --\nh-how could you feel the presence of the Germans?",
        "A: Well, they were all over the streets, the soldiers and their ve-vehicles, their cars and tanks,\nand -- o-over the street, so it was not difficult to -- to see it. And then I think my mother -- yeah,\nmy mother told me to go to her cousin, to visit her cousin. And -- and I -- I almost\n[indecipherable] caught in their apartment already mixing something up, maybe it was then the\nSoviets were in Wilna. I don\u2019t remember who was -- the police was there, and searching their\napartment. And I was afraid that they will not allow me to go back. And I don\u2019t remember it was\nthe germa -- Germans or the Russians. Don\u2019t remember exactly, because they were rich people.\nWe were not rich, we were middle class [indecipherable] middle class, and you know, but they\nwere rich people, so I don\u2019t remember who searched the apartment, but tha-that was the moment\nI was scared that I will not be able to go back home.",
        "Q: So your mother let you out?",
        "A: Yeah, all the time. All the time, I don\u2019t know, all the time. It was -- we had a Polish lady we\nwere very friendly with. She was a p-poor lady, she was a relative of the German lady who lived\nwith us. It means, this German lady was married to her brother. The brother was a -- a Russian\nofficer in Russia, and was killed in ninet -- in -- in the first World War. So she was alone and she\ncame back to our family. And we loved the lady his Veronica, what I gave the name to the Yad\nVashem, her name. And I am talking about it. It\u2019s interesting. I am. So she told me after the war\nwhy my mother was so sure that I will survive. Nobody di -- what -- happens to me. It was -- she\nhad a dream when she gave birth to me. After she gave -- gave birth, she was tired, of course,\nand she fell asleep. And she had a dream that the angel came to her and told her that when your\ndaughter will be 13 years old, it will be a war in which your whole family will be killed, perish,\nall but not your daughter. She will survive it. So she was sure that -- and you know, she was so --\nshe was thinking about the -- the dream all the time, but I didn\u2019t know it, a-as I told you, I -- I\nknew it after the war, I learned it from Veronica. That why she insisted she wanted to emigrate\nso much, and that why she was so nervous. And Veronica told me even that she wanted to\ncommit suicide in 1939, but she persuaded her not to leave the children. And she committed\nsuicide.",
        "Q: Your mother?",
        "A: Yeah, in 1943, when the Germans took her. She told me the Germans will not take me alive.\nThey can take me only a dead body, and that what she did.",
        "Q: So wh-what is day to day life like at this point? I-It sounds like people are staying inside.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Have the Germans instituted rules, are you wearing a star at this point?",
        "A: No, no, it was not like tha -- bef -- before we went to ghetto it was no stars, but 1t was very\ndangerous to walk the street, especially the men. Even the Poles didn\u2019t walk a lot, it was only the\nmilitary men and Lithuanian.",
        "Q: What did you do all day?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember. Probably we read. It\u2019s a good question, you know. It was like\na -- a prison, but at home. Of course my, the -- the Julia used to go out and to buy some food. It\nwas a shortage o-on food already. I don\u2019t remember her -- doing something, you know, what my\nbrother did. And of course we had neighbors. We rented one apartment. It was one house with a\nlot of rooms, but after my grandparents came home, back to Wilna, after the revolution started in\nRussia. So when they -- they died, this -- in -- in Wilna, so my mother rented a part of the house.\nIt was a Polish family there, and my mother was helping them a lot. When the Lithuanian came,\nthey fired all the Poles from the [indecipherable] positions. And he was working for the railroad,\nso he was fired also because he didn\u2019t know Lithuanian, the language, so they fired him. So they\ncouldn\u2019t pay for rent, and they couldn\u2019t -- and they didn\u2019t have money and my mother told them\nthey can stay as long as they want, she will not ask them for rent. Ah, so, but when the war\nstarted with the Germans so, and suddenly somebody told that the Germans are going from hou -\n- home to home looking for Jewish men. So she asks them to hide my father and my brother and\nthey refused. Yeah, but -- but we -- we were not sure why they refused, maybe they were afraid\nof theirsel -- themself being o-of the Germans also, yeah. But the Germans didn\u2019t come to our\nhouse, and it was see, then on September, first of September then, they told all the Jewish people\nto go to get -- to the ghetto. And they already know the Germans, but the Lithuanian police went\nfrom home to home for -- ho -- one Jewish house, another Jewish house, to take the Jewish\npeople out of the houses.",
        "Q: Before we get to that, I just want to clarify that -- so then was the bombing of Vilnius by the\nGermans, was that in August of the same year?",
        "A: It was a -- an -- the -- it was June.",
        "Q: Oh, it was June.",
        "A: June, yeah. The war started the 22\"! of June, 1941. June, I think, not July yet, June.",
        "Q: And so then that was -- you tried to run and you came back, that took about two weeks --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then so from about mid June until --",
        "A: No, July, for about --",
        "Q: Okay, July.",
        "A: -- mid July until the first of September, this --",
        "Q: You were just sort of in this prison state.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. Did you have any idea that something might be happening in the last days of August?\nDo -- could you tell that maybe you were going to be -- some sort of form of action was going to\nbe taken? Did you seek preparations in the ghetto, or --",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t know, because it happened, I think, overnight.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They decided which part of the streets we -- will belong to the ghetto. It was a Jewish district,\nso not a lot of non-Jews lived there, so they asked the non-Jews to -- to find another -- other\napartments and the Jews they took to th -- to the prison, and then to Ponary and they killed them.\nAnd so they emptied a whole district, so they could take the -- from the other districts of the city\nand bring it to -- to the streets who -- which belonged to th -- to the ghetto already. But maybe\nrumors ki -- were going, of course around that it will be a ghetto organized, because people knew\nthat they organized the ghetto in other cities probably. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t remember. I know\nonly that we knew that some would -- prominent Jews were arrested and killed. Some Jewish\nmen were taken from apartments and from the streets. We knew that the -- the Lithuanian were\nhelping them, and the Lithuanian police, they organized Lithuanian police, and the fascist\n[indecipherable] of Lithuania of course was [indecipherable]. And th-the Poles were -- behaved\nvery quietly, they were afraid for themself. And you have to remember that the Germans were\nenemies of the Polish people, because they conquered their country, they were destroying their\ncountry, and they killed a lot of Poles over. So it was like -- a little bit it\u2019s your enemies and our\nenemies are the same, so it was like that. Had to say, oh, like a moral support from the side of the\nPoles. Not all of them, was a part of them were very happy to see it, and participated in it,\nparticipated in it, but a lot of them were -- hated the Germans and --",
        "Q: Was your mother making any sort of prep -- preparations, perhaps gathering up jewelry,\nmaybe packing a bag that would definitely go if you had to go anywhere? What wa --",
        "A: I think so, yeah, because perba -- probably rumors were already around the city that the ghetto\nwill be organized, and when they started to see how they are throwing out the people, the Jewish\npeople from the houses, so my mother started to pack. But it\u2019s interesting we were in the last\none, because Germans didn\u2019t know that our house is Jewish. We didn\u2019t look like -- the look was\nlike -- I don\u2019t know, something. And th -- and y -- every house had a -- such a -- a -- how to call\nit? A sign, which -- the names of all the tenants. So our name, last name, is a German name,\nShreyber. A lot of Germans have Shreyber. It -- in German, this is a writer. And my father\u2019s\nname in Polish was not Matthias, but 1t was Mateush, and my mother names -- my mother\u2019s\nname is Valentina. And my was -- and my brother\u2019s is Jusef in Polish, yeah. And my, Sulamita,\nthe only -- the only Hebrew name, but it\u2019s such an -- it was not a popular name, so they didn\u2019t\nknow what name 1s it. And then the go -- went to the tenants, the Polish, Latinsky, Latinska and\nso on. So they -- we saw them coming in to our yard and reading the sign and [indecipherable].\nSo I\u2019m coming in again, somebody else, reading, and [indecipherable]. So we were very nervous,\nwhat -- we didn\u2019t know what to do. And -- but somebody told them, yeah, yeah, go, there are\nJews there. So I remember they knocked at the door, Lithuanian policemen, and my mother\nopened the door, and they saw my mother and said, oh, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s a mistake. So she told no,\nit\u2019s not a mistake, we are Jews. So he came in, and he asked for the pas -- passports, for the\ndocuments, and he started to write name. Then he looked out -- around -- my father looked -- I\nwill show you the picture. It was an -- a -- a look of a Russian intelligent [indecipherable] you\nknow -- you have to know the Russian intelligent, how they -- they looked, like Chekhov, like,\nyou know. He looked my -- my mother was absolute not Jewish look, and me. So he told, look,\nyou can\u2019t change the nationality in the documents. You don\u2019t have the names, the Jewish names,\nyou don\u2019t have the last name Jewish -- a Jewish one. What are you thinking how -- and it was\nsuch a shock for us. And I remember my father looking at my mother, and -- and she told no, we\nwill go where -- wer -- where our people go, together with them. And we went. Because, you\nknow, even if she allow him, okay, okay, maybe you can help pass -- to change, because it was\nnot so easy to change in passport the name, you change to -- and there\u2019s a nationality, to change\nlike you cannot recognize it, it\u2019s changed, you know? It\u2019s very difficult, we didn\u2019t know who can\nread, and then the neighbors would say, look why didn\u2019t you take them, what 1s it with you?\nThey are Jews. So we decided to go with [indecipherable] we went, we took some -- yeah, we\ntook some belongings with me -- with us.",
        "Q: After that decision was made, did your father and mother discuss it, or disagree about it?",
        "A: No, absolutely not. We took our belongings and the only thing my mother told Julia, Julia,\nthis big bedroom where the children were, and the small room and the bathroom will belong to\nyou. I don\u2019t know if they leave you the other rooms, yeah? And she wrote on the door her name,\nJulia -- her maiden name was German, I don\u2019t remember. And she wrote al -- under that,\nvolkesdeutsche. The Germans who were not in Germany, [indecipherable] but they were all in\nPoland, in Lithuania -- they lived in Poland or Lithuania, they named them not Germans, but\nvolkesdeutsche. It\u2019s deutsche is German, but volkes, it\u2019s --",
        "Q: People.",
        "A: -- people, people -- German people, yeah. And she brought to the room as much belonging as\nshe could, then she saw that it\u2019s too much, somebody can say what -- what is it. So she brought\nto the neighbors a part of the belongings.",
        "Q: The neighbors that wouldn\u2019t help your father?",
        "A: No -- yeah. She di -- y-you know, they couldn\u2019t recognize already that they are not friendly to\nus, because to hide a Jew was very -- very, very dangerous. So how can you accuse a person who\ndi -- doesn\u2019t want to risk their own life? You cannot make such a big a -- you know, a-a-\naccusation immediately. So she didn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t understand it, she ment -- she said, oh yeah,\nshe was afraid, but yeah, and that\u2019s it, then we went to ghetto -- to the ghetto, and started a new\nlife.",
        "Q: You went with that Lithuanian policeman? Right then?",
        "A: No, no, no, no. We were -- I don\u2019t know where he was. The other policemen were guarding\nthe -- the Jewish people, and --",
        "Q: But did you go that night after you had that discussion with the Lithuanian police --",

        "Q: How much -- how many things did you actually take? What did you take, do you remember?",

        "Q: Does that mean that you were able to get the jewelry back?",
        "A: It means that she was selling the jewelry and bringing us food to -- to the ghetto, otherwise --\nshe was selling.",
        "Q: What was Veronica\u2019s last name?",

And he escaped when\neverybody was taken to Ponary, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember how. He was living there and he\ngave us aroom.

I don\u2019t know even if I find it in a dictionary such a word there, like a -- like a piece of\n-- of wood, yeah. Yeah. It was put -- they put it on the side during the day and they -- we put it in\nbun -- in bunches during the night and he slept up --",

        "A: I remember only when my brother brought her.",

        "A: Probably a little bit.",
        "Q: What -- what were the conditions like in terms of bathing and going to the bathroom?",
        "A: It was one bathroom. We had one, two, three, four rooms, full with -- with people, and one\nbathroom in the corridor, and -- and -- and the washroom was separately, yeah, not hot water, but\ncold water. My mother had a shower every day, cold water, in summer and in winter. She was\nused to it. I was afraid to do it.",
        "Q: Did you have a family meeting, or di -- do you remember talking to your parents late at night\nab-about what was going on?",
        "A: I didn't talk to my parents. I don\u2019t know, I -- I don\u2019t remember. I-I probably more listened\nthan I talked. And nobody would listen to me. I was a child, a teenager, yeah. It was sad, and\nthen people started to disappear, to disappear. And rumors went around that people are taking to\nthe -- to prison and then from the prison to Ponary and killed. And then became the big action in\nYom Kippur, the Jewish holiday, [indecipherable] everybody. They took from the apartment,\nthat\u2019s what I remember. Rachel remembers something a little bit different, but I remember it that\nour family was taken from our room, and everybody had to go to the gate, to main -- to the main\nga -- gate of ghetto, because other gates were -- other streets were closed, yeah. They build like\nwalls, and that it was a main gate and another gate was for the head of the -- of the ghetto,\nspecial gate, a small gate, but he had the keys, and he could open and walk out, but he couldn\u2019t.\nSo everybody was gathered in front of the main gate. So the Lithuanian police went through the\napartments and together with the Jewish police, and asked everybody to go out to the ghetto, to\npeople in the front of the -- of the gate, and then they went to search every apartment if\nsomebody was left there. And then I started to scream. What are we waiting? Are we waiting so\nquietly to be shot? And I screamed and talked to my parents and talked, and a man was standing\nbehind and told my father, \u201cQuiet down your daughter, otherwise I will quiet her down. What\nshe\u2019s talking about? Nobody will kill us, they are checking our documents.\u201d That was the -- they\nalways lied to -- to quiet the people down so the -- we are checking your papers, so you have to\nline up and we will check your papers. I didn\u2019t believe it. So my father told me I will give you a -\n- my watch as a good [indecipherable] watch -- Pll give you the watch, and give it to the\nLithuanian, and -- because they -- they was taking some money, and -- give it to the Lithuanian,\nhe will let you go. Professor, what are you talking about? I will give to one Lithuanian, he will\nlet me go, the other one will cu -- catch me, there is four. And I ha [indecipherable] was how\ncould you stand her quietly and your -- go to -- to the grave? What are you -- so my mother\ncouldn\u2019t listen to it any more, and she went to the German who was the leader of the whole\nentertainment, yeah? Yeah. We will call like that, the death dance. And she started to talk to him\nin German, of course. He was shocked. He told her -- he asked her, \u201cWhat? Where are you from?\nYour German is so perfect.\u201d I\u2019m from Berlin. I am also from ber -- from Berlin. Where is your\nfamily. [indecipherable] here. So, get out of here. And he came over with my mother and he told\n-- told [indecipherable] this is my daughter, my [indecipherable] and he -- he told us to stand on\nthe side, yeah. So we stand here, and he was standing, father, and then a Lithuanian came over\nand started to slap us back to there. So he told no, don\u2019t touch them. So people saw that we are\nstanding there, so people started to run behind us, so our family was growing and we were\nstanding in the front and behind us some other people, some other people. And then they opened\nthe gate and all the people went -- left. We was -- we were already in the ghetto, standing in the\nghetto and waiting for the -- for [indecipherable] yeah. And then he told, the action is finished,\ngoodbye, and he left, and he went back. And then the -- so the Jewish police knew it, where other\npeople are -- are going. They told, oh, you save your life, you save your life. And then we heard\nthat everybody was taken to the prison, to Lukeeshki, and from the pris -- prison to Ponary and\neverybody was killed. It was thousands and thousands of people. I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t\nremember the number, but it was a lot. Maybe eight thousand, maybe 10 thousand. And then\nsome run away, people wounded from the, you know, graves, came to ghetto, smelling with dead\npeople already. Well, we knew already. And I told my mother, that\u2019s it, I am not more going\ntogether with you and waiting until they will shot me. [indecipherable] shoot me, they will kill\nme. [indecipherable] to run. Every time it was a rumor, every time that we heard that it will be an\naction, it will be something in ghetto. So every time I heard it in the morning, I was putting my\nstar of -- the David star, yeah in -- on the front only, I didn\u2019t have it on -- on my back, and it was\nnot, you know, I -- it was with a needle --",
        "Q: A pin.",
        "A: -- with a pin, yeah. And I went together with these people who went to work, who left the\nghetto to work, people were working for the Germans, doing some job.",
        "Q: You -- you told your mother that --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- from now on you were going to run away --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- when you heard rumors.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What did your mother say?",
        "A: Okay. She was happy that -- so -- and then it was a problem. Her -- we were working -- the\nJewish people who worked the brig -- with the brigades, yeah, they were walking through the\nstreets, but not on the sidewalks, but in -- on the road. So it was one risk to take out the -- my\nstar, yellow star, to go to the sidewalk and to disappear. Not to take it. And I run though the --\nthrough the town, to the city, to Veronica. And I stayed with her a couple of months.",
        "Q: What did she say when you came to the door?",
        "A: She was happy. But she was very poor, and she had only one room. And they -- her neighbors\nliked to -- to talk to her, to come in and to have a chat, you know, they saw me. I couldn\u2019t hide\nmyself, was one room. So she told everybody, oh my relative from -- from a village came to live.\nOkay. They knew, but they pretend that they don\u2019t know. And we used to walk with her. I used\nto go with her to a priest. Once we went and she -- she gave him an -- a golden ruble what my --\nmy mother had when that hor -- the times of [indecipherable] there were golden rubles\n[indecipherable] like that. So she gave it to him and he gave us some bread, and a piece of\nmargarine, I think. And as everybo --",
        "Q: A priest, this was a priest?",
        "A: Yeah. And he took the money and he gave us bread, and some margarine, and he came back,\nand tomorrow, for tomorrow she went -- I -- I don\u2019t know, maybe I went together with her, and I\n-- and we gave it to my brother who worked also outside the ghetto, and he used to bring it in the\nghetto.",
        "Q: So you and Veronica went and found your brother, and gave him some food?",
        "A: Oh, she knew where he worked --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- yeah, it\u2019s not the first time she went to him to give him food.",
        "Q: So your brother was able to also tell your parents that you were with her?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, that I am alive and I am with her, yeah.",
        "Q: What did you look like? You had long braids?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Long blonde braids?",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Pll show you. I have here a picture.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: She saved us -- she and Julia saved us their old pictures.",
        "Q: So -- so you could look -- you didn't -- as you\u2019ve said many times actually in this interview,\nyou didn\u2019t necessarily -- you couldn\u2019t look like what people assumed Jews looked like.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You could pass for a little German girl, or a Polish girl?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, a Polish girl, yeah.",
        "Q: A Polish girl.",
        "A: Because I -- my Polish was fluently, and --",
        "Q: So when you were staying with Veronica, what were the fears? Were they mostly of the\nneighbors, or at that point would you be afraid that Germans might come searching house to\nhouse?",
        "A: The Lithuanian.",
        "Q: The Lithuanians?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That was -- and the -- the neighbors were friendly, except one, and this one started to talk that\nVeronica is hiding a Jew. And then another neighbor came to us and told her, Veronica, you have\nto do something, because she told, that the rumors are going like that, that you are hiding a\nJewish girl. So her mother, she had a -- she has a mo -- had a mother, a old mother, yeah, she\nwas also not very young, but so sh -- her mother started to cry, let me die in my bed, I don\u2019t want\nto be hanged by Germans -- by Lithuanian. If they would find me, they would kill both of them.\nWas no question about it. She cried [indecipherable] because didn\u2019t know what to do. So I\ndecided to go back. And I remember our way back, she took me, and we went back. Was in the\nevening. She cried the whole w-way back. She told me if I can -- if I risk with my own life, it\u2019s\nokay, but I don\u2019t want to risk with my mother\u2019s life. And I -- I understood it. That\u2019s it, it\u2019s too\ndan -- dangerous. When I came back my mother was very unhappy that it was all the actions\nwith the [indecipherable] the yellow, with the pink and [indecipherable] were over\n[indecipherable]. And it was a small period of time that it was qu -- almost quiet, yeah. Some\npeople were killed because they took some bread to get, or some people were killed because they\nwere caught stealing something and so on, but not such a action how thousands of people were\nkilled.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about how you began to work when you were in the ghetto? You\nwere, after all -- at that point how old were you?",
        "A: Ah, 15 -- or 15 I was already in fo -- 1943, so -- and I started to work in 1942 probably, when\nI was 14. But you know, because I was in and out of the ghetto, I didn\u2019t have like a -- a real\nserious wor -- job. But I don\u2019t know who took me to Polish bricks. I -- they have to be polished, I\ndon\u2019t know. So it was such a machine. It was red, not -- they were not very st -- very straight so I\nhad to polish them. My mother was very upset about it because it were a dust which goes -- went\nto my lungs, and she was always afraid -- afraid of my lungs, because my aunt, her sister -- my\nmother\u2019s sister, died of tuberculosis.",
        "Q: You were working with bricks?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. Making the bricks?",
        "A: No, polishing them.",
        "Q: Polishing the bricks?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: For what?",
        "A: Ihave no idea for what.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: There were a lot of jobs what I didn't ha -- I -- I didn\u2019t know why I -- where I have to do it,\nbut I don\u2019t remember who took me, who asked me to do it, but I went to work for one time. And\nthen the evening I belonged to -- to a -- a youth club. You know, we tried to make the life more\nor less normal, you know? As normal as could be. As close to normal as it could be. So we had a\nclub, and we had poets and writers, who taught us literature, Jewish literature, and we were\nperforming there, and I won even a -- a prize for a poem what I was reciting, yeah. Yeah -- re --",
        "Q: A poem?",
        "A: Yeah, a poem.",
        "Q: What was the poem about?",
        "A: It was a poem of -- an -- an old Yiddish p-poet, Ihoyash, that was his name. He is a famous\nYiddish poet -- Jewish poet, actually, not Yiddish. But he wrote in Yiddish. That -- and we were\n-- it was like a close family, and the -- in the club, so I was so involved in performing something,\nand -- so it was -- but it was a very short time, a short time what I told you, I don\u2019t know, three,\nfour months that we were -- we had the life without the big, big action, without the killing\nthousands of people. People were dying of starvation, of course, and -- and illnesses. People\nwere taken for that, or for another so-called crime. If you see as -- you are very hungry and you\nsteal a piece of bread, you were shot, you know. But like the actions, which were before, like the\nactions with the yellow shines, with the pink shines, what -- thousands of people were killed. So\nit was a short period, I think the end of \u201942, or the beginning of the \u00b043, that it was -- I don\u2019t\nremember the date exactly, but 1t was more or less quiet. And we had even a school for students -\n- everything was illegal, of course. The school was like we used to come and the teachers taught\nus history, and literature, and mathematics. And I remember my father as a mathematic. He used\nto -- he wanted to teach me mathematics, so he explained to me something, and I didn't listen\neven to him. He asked me to repeat and I told him, I don\u2019t know. So he thought, you are not\nlistening to me. So I told him, do you want me to -- to die a educated person? I don\u2019t care. Well,\nhe stopped. Then the teacher of French language, yeah, I had a private less -- private lessons of\nFrench before the war. So she was a neighbor of ours in the ghetto, so my mother used to ask me,\ngo to Eda Danielovna, go to her, she is so lonely, she already lost her husband and her daughter,\nshe is alone, go and talk to her French. Well, I thought, what ha -- why -- what do you want from\nme? I can be killed without French. And I remember that only once I came to her and we talked,\nand now I don\u2019t know French. Now I kne -- I have to know French, but I don\u2019t know now. That -\n- my mother was clever that she wanted me to -- to, you know, not to forget the language, the\nFrench language, and --",
        "Q: How did your parents react when you spoke like that?",
        "A: Nothing. They kept quiet. What could they tell? They never told me, you will survive,\nbecause they didn\u2019t know. Maybe my mother had, but I told you the dream, so she was hopeful --\nshe hopes that I will survive, but the life was -- it was so difficult to survive that -- I know that\nmy father closed the book and never came to me again. So, and the lessons at school were very --\nyou know, it was very upsetting because every day we used to see, oh another teacher is gone,\nyeah. Oh, he died. Oh, this one was caught carrying a piece of bread and was taken to the prison.\nOh, this -- you know, every day, so it was so -- you know, upsetting that then we closed the\nschool at all. Let\u2019s see, they forgot to tell you about a m -- the last days of the -- the last days of\nthe peace before the 90 -- the ra -- the war started in 1941 -- in 1941. So it was days very -- very\n-- not quiet days, because the KGB were already -- start already to work very energetic in\nLithuania. Before they were -- they kept a little bit quiet, they let us leave normally, yeah. Then,\nprobably they felt already that it will be a war between Russia and Germany, so they started to\ntake people out to Siberia, that -- the people who they thought were enemies of Soviet Union.\nWho were the enemies of the sov -- of Soviet Union? Of course, some parties, alexa -- Zionist\nparties, Zionist parties and BUND, and -- and rich people. So but Wilna was a poor city at all,\nand they didn\u2019t -- in Wilna didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t have rich people, very rich people, I mean. So,\nbut in -- the Bolsheviks thought that everybody who has a small store was selling some\nnewspapers and some pencils and some salt and sugar, everything in one room, is rich. So they\nused to take the people out of their homes and to take them to the railway station and to take\nthem to Siberia. Also peasants, Lithuanian peasants who had more than one cow, or one -- was\nalready like a kulak in -- in Russia. A rich peasant who is exploiting others, you know, so -- and\nmy mother was dreaming to run away from Wilna. So she was standing on the street in front of\nour house, and asking them when they -- you know, they are -- the kb -- KGB was -- had the list\nof names and was taking one -- from one house a family, from another one. Come to us, please,\nwe will -- we are rich, we are ri -- do you see, we have a house -- the house didn\u2019t belong already\nto us, but she told like that -- and a house, and na na na, and then come right in. We had normal\nfurniture, fi -- nice furniture. We -- we are rich, take us, take us to Siberia. And people thought\nthat she is crazy, what is it? I remember somebody asked me, is your mother crazy? And I, no.\nSo why she is asking them to take you to Siberia? Because it\u2019s better than to take over the ger --\nthe Germans will take over us, yeah. And she was right. Mostly. Of course, not everybody\nsurvived in Siberia also, of course not. I s -- it was a very hard time, it was a very hard time to\nRussia at all, and it was a hard time to people in Siberia. But mostly they survived, and they\ncame back.",
        "Q: Your mother tried awfully hard to -- to get out.",
        "A: She tried very hard to -- to get out of the country, yeah, of Lithuania and the city of --\ncouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s it. Yeah, that\u2019s what I missed these days. Then the war started, so you know\nalready that we are on our way too late, and we were caught, and we came back, and we came to\nthe ghetto, yeah.",
        "Q: In -- in the ghetto, can you describe the -- the interactions that you did have with the\nGermans? Where would you interact with them once you were in the ghetto? Was it just coming\nin and going out, or --",
        "A: No, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s -- as I told you, when it was Yom Kippur, the Jewish holiday, when they took\nall the people, that what I survived, this action. The others actions I was not there in ghetto.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I knew only that then it was a yel -- the action of the yellow -- yellow -- documents of the\nyellow shine [indecipherable]. So I was with Veronica, and we knew that something is going on\nin ghetto. And now of course I was very upset, and I didn't know what happened with my family.\nSo she told me, come, we will go th -- to this -- to the -- in the direction of the ghetto, maybe we\nwill learn something. And we went and we met a Jewish family, walking like that in the streets.\nSo we stopped them and started to talk to them, what\u2019s going on? So they told me -- they told us\nthat it was the action of yellow documents, of yellow shines, and we have the -- the yellow\nshines, so we were allowed to go and to go to our job where he was working. He was working\nfor Germans, I don\u2019t know which organization, so he took his family and he went there. So I\ndidn\u2019t know if my father had it, and I was so upset and we went farther, and we stayed -- I don\u2019t\nknow which street we -- we were stopped by a crowd with -- the crowd was looking how they --\nthe Jews were going through the road to Ponary. And I was looking together, and I thought, my\nGod, why is there -- why is they are walking so quietly? Why is they not doing something, you\nknow? And I looked if my father or my mother -- my family is there. Couldn\u2019t see it. But\nsuddenly I saw a woman carried a small child, and shud -- suddenly the Lithuanian were not so\nclose, the soldiers who took them, she throw the child to the crowd, and somebody took the child\nand disappeared immediately. Understand? She throw to the crowd, to the Aryan crowd who\nwere standing, and probably a -- a -- a woman took the child and run away. But of course she\nwas afraid that somebody will stop her for taking, but nobody stopped her. She run away, she --\nimmediately she was gone. So the woman saved her child. It was horrible. I don\u2019t remem -- then,\nwe went with her to that place where my son was working because my father was working in the\nghetto. And my --",
        "Q: Or your brother?",
        "A: My father, and my brother worked out of the ghetto, so we -- we went to he -- to see him.",
        "Q: To see who?",
        "A: My -- my brother.",
        "Q: Okay, uh-huh.",
        "A: And he -- I -- we -- we met him and he told that yeah, the family is okay.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: The family is okay. So, the family -- my father took Rachel as a daughter inste -- you know,\ninstead of me, because I was not there. And my brother took my cousin, my -- my father\u2019s\nsister\u2019s daughter, as a wife.",
        "Q: Dina?",
        "A: D-Dina, yes. Dina Abramovich, yeah, who wer -- who is 90 now and works for the\n[indecipherable] yeah. You know, because it was who had the yellow document, could take with\n-- with them, a wife, and two children less than 16 years. So Rachel was already approaching 20,\nbut she looked so young. Everybody looked so thin, that you couldn\u2019t understand she is 20 or 16\nor fi -- 16 or 15, you know? So it was okay, and he took her, my cousin, she was much older than\nhe, but it went smooth, that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: But when you came back --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- then were y -- wh-whose paper were you on? If Rachel was on your father\u2019s paper?",
        "A: Nobody checked the paper then. They checked the papers when the actions were, you know,\nbut nobody checked the papers. Look, people are dying and running away and kill -- people were\nkilled every minute. So who knows -- who knew? Where is my daughter and where is my\nbrother? Where is my father? Nobody checked it. And my father organized in the ghetto a small\nschool for -- like a technical school. And some use -- some young boys were attending the\nschool, and making some, you know -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know even what they produced. But I\nknow one thing, that the -- the underground was working already in ghetto and my -- my brother\nwas among them, who was stealing weapons from the Germans and was bringing to the ghetto.\nAnd I know that the young people who are working in the school, the technical school were\nrepairing guns, making something like grenades, like to -- to -- you know --",
        "Q: Grenades?",
        "A: Grenades, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Handmade grenades?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. We used to, you know, the bulb -- to take a bulb --",
        "Q: A light bulb?",
        "A: -- from -- yeah, a lamp, yeah. To take everything from inside, to put a liquid, which 1s --\nwhich can be inflamed immediately when you throw it, the glass will, of course, break, and it\nwill, like a bomb, you know, it will burst. So that was our grenades in ghetto, yeah.",
        "Q: Your -- so they were making these in your father\u2019s technical school?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, they were [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So your father\u2019s technical school wasn\u2019t just a school?",
        "A: He -- I -- I don\u2019t know, he pretended it was a school, you know, it was very -- everything was\nvery [indecipherable]. There they made fels -- like they made keys to -- to the gate. Like, the gate\nwas closed, locked always, yeah. Only when people were going out to work or coming in from\nwork. So they made keys to -- to ca -- to be able to walk out at night, to the partisan, to the\nwoods, you know? And it was not from the gate, from the main gate, but 1t was another gate, a\nsmall one, what I told you for the -- the leader of the ghetto, who would walk out. He had a\npersonal gate, a personal key, and he could walk out with a key -- through the small gate. His\nname was Genz.",
        "Q: Jacob Genz?",
        "A: Jacob Genz.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He had a -- a Lithuanian wife, and a daughter who wa -- out of ghetto, of course. And he was\nallowed to come to them to visit them sometimes, you know. So he had his key, and so then the\npartisans used it, and probably Genz knew about it, I think. So it was very, very difficult to hide,\nand he knew about the -- that the party -- the underground party existed, yeah, and the\n[indecipherable] was named.",
        "Q: Were you part of that underground?",
        "A: Yeah, you know, I was a part of it, but I was small -- no, y -- I was too young, and we were\nonly like some, you know, listen to some news from Russia, what\u2019s going on in the front, how\nthe Germans are already retreating, and to encourage people that soon, soon, soon, that will be\nthe end of the war, and th -- you know, so we were listening to the news, writing down and then\ngiving it to read for people, and so this was not exactly a big job, and --",
        "Q: But you did that?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we did. And -- and we, of course, I hope that they will take me to the partisans,\ncause I -- [ -- I didn\u2019t look like a Jewish girl and I could go to the fr -- from the forest to the city\nand back. I had such -- we had to have a connection, so somebody had to come to the city and go\nback to -- to the forest, so -- but they decided that I am too young, and they left me behind, me\nand Rachel, also.",
        "Q: Who -- who left you behind?",
        "A: The organizers of the -- of the -- of the underground organization.",
        "Q: Was your brother involved?",
        "A: My brother was involved in the -- of course, yes, he used to steal and bring weapons. But he\nwas caught before -- before the liquidation of the ghetto. He was caught in the action of men, and\nit was -- they were -- before they liquidated the ghetto, they were catching only men, so he was\ncaught and transferred to the -- the concentration camp in Estonia, in Klooga.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about that, that day that he was caught?",
        "A: It was a day when the organization mobilized all the members, and decided to -- to fight the\nGermans, decided to resist, it\u2019s enough, you have to resist. And we were mobilized on one street\nin a -- in a big, big yard of the -- of the house where the partisans probably had the weapons, I\ndon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know exactly because we -- we were not -- I was not told where and what\nthey have. One group of the underground fighters were sent to another house, and they had to\nstart to fight the Germans, who were entering -- the Germans and the Lithuanians who were\nentering the -- the ghetto. And another group of only boys and my -- they include my brother\nwere sent to another street, and -- but they went without weapons and they were told that the\nweapons were being delivered. And they were not delivered and the Germans surrounded them\nand they took them, all of them, the whole group. And the -- the people who were in fron -- in\nthe front house, saw it was foolish, they were told that it will be a parole when they start to shout\n-- to shoot the Germans, so it was a parole fire. But fire is in German also. You know what fire?\nFire is a fire, you know? It -- so it\u2019s -- and the Germans walked through the streets and somebody\nasked for a cigarette probably, give me the fire or something. They had fire, they started to\n[indecipherable]. And they did -- and the Germans, they -- around to the -- the base, to the f -- to\nthe house, that the people from the house couldn\u2019t see them, yeah. And they put a bomb there\nand they run away and the whole house was exploded and all the people were -- were -- died, of\ncourse. Were killed.",
        "Q: So ri -- the people in the resistance in the ghetto were waiting for an order to shoot, and they\ngot -- they got a mixed up order and they shot accidentally?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And then the Germans bombed the building?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Where were you during all of this?",
        "A: And I was in another -- well, in the sam -- the same street, but oh, maybe three or four houses\nfrom there, yeah.",
        "Q: So -- so you saw this?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see it, but I heard it, of course. And then -- then the organization, the head of the\norganization decided there is no reason to fight. We have to leave ge -- the ghetto to go -- you\nhave to rent to -- to go to the partisans and to fight the -- the Germans from the woods. But was it\na right decision? But the decision has to be done much earlier. And to take much more people to\nthe partisans because we were so afraid that the Germans can learn about the organization, that it\nwas very, very -- it was a conspiracy, very, very underground, and nobody knew it except the\nmembers of the organization. But we could involve more -- more young people. And the other\ntha -- thing is, they took only -- to the woods they took only people who had a pistol, or a -- a\ngun, or something like that. Who had no weapons they didn\u2019t want it. So we didn't -- I had --\ndidn\u2019t have it, and -- and Rachel didn\u2019t have it, so we were la -- left behind, and that what 1s it.",
        "Q: So how did you find out where Joseph was taken to?",
        "A: Joseph was so capable that he send us a -- a small letter that the man who -- the machinist of\nthe train, the man who was -- how you say? You know, somebody has to sit there, and to --",
        "Q: The conductor?",
        "A: Conductor, yeah, but it\u2019s not like a conduc -- okay, the conductor was a young Polish guy,\nand my brother wrote a note that I am taking to a concentration camp to Estonia, and please save\nRachel. He was so thinking about her, that that was his -- yeah. And the guy, I don\u2019t know how, I\ndon\u2019t remember how, he brought a letter to the ghetto -- oh he, or somebody else brought it, but\nwe -- we had it, and we knew that they were there. And my father told me that you cannot run\naway without Rachel, because my son asked me to save Rachel. Okay. So, when it was the\nliquidation of the ghetto, on the 23\u2122 of September, 1943, so we were -- the ghetto was\nsurrounded already by Lithuanian police, and -- and I think even with po -- no, the -- I think\nmostly Ukrainian police, because the Lithuanian police, the Lithuanian SS actually knew already\nthat the Russians are coming, and they run to the forest with another group of partisans, what\nthey claim now that they were the patriots. Okay, maybe, but I don\u2019t know which patriot they\nwere, but -- so they run to the forest to fight the Russians, of course, because they wanted to help\nthe Germans, but the Germans wanted to mobilize them to go to the army and to fight the\nRussian [indecipherable]. They didn\u2019t want it, so they didn\u2019t obey the Germans, but they wanted\nto fight Russians, so they run to the forests. And of course they were afraid that if some Jews\nwere alive, so they were going to tell that -- what -- what was going on there. So I think that the -\n- the liquidation of the g-ghetto in Wilna was by a Ukrainian SS division, made by Ukrainians,\nbecause I remember standing with Rachel in line already, hearing them talking Russian. Russian,\nor Ukrainian, it\u2019s very similar, you know, you can recognize, you can understand. And we --\nwhen we understood that we cannot go out together with the organization, underground\norganization, cannot leave the ghetto, we started to look for a exit, how to run. We met some\nother girls. We were sitting a couple of hours 1n a -- you know, the places where the -- the water\nis running from the toilets.",
        "Q: The sewer?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Tunnel, or sewer?",
        "A: In such a -- yeah. So we s-sat there until 1t was dark, then we went out, and --",
        "Q: You were hiding?",
        "A: Yeah, hiding, but for several hours, we didn\u2019t want to hide it for -- forever, we couldn\u2019t. It\nwas like sitting like that, and it was not -- not only comfortable, but was impossible to sit long\nthere. And -- and it was in ghetto, at -- you know, and we wanted to go out. So we walked out,\nthe ghetto was -- looked terrible. There are no people already in the ghetto. It was dark already,\nwith the -- the windows were open, the doors were open, the belongings were in the streets, you\nknow. The pillows were torn apart, all the feathers. Like, I see the -- the picture like today, you\nknow, like it was yesterday. And n-near us was a library, a big library, a [indecipherable] library.\nSo the books were out in the streets, torn and -- you know. And we looked for people, you know,\nso we met three o-other girls, so we were five of us. And we decided to go to climb the stairs\nupstairs in a building. And I know -- I don\u2019t know how we knew that the building has a hole in\nthe roof, and we can go out to -- onto the roof, and from the roof we can jump to another\nbuilding which doesn\u2019t belong already to the ghetto. So 1t was dark, and we couldn\u2019t see well,\nbut we saw the hole in the roof, and one of the girls climbed the ladder, and she was the first who\nlooked out, and she was caught. So, a soldier was [indecipherable] there and watching. She was\ncaught, and she shouted so loudly that we ran back. I remember not finding the way out of there.\nYou know, the building, 1t was dark, where are the stairs, where are -- where is [indecipherable]\nrun back. And then -- then we s -- we saw no way out. And we went to the building of the\nJudenrat, I mean like the government of the ghetto [indecipherable]. And we found this Jewish\npolice and the government [indecipherable] and some people were there. And we -- we came to\nthem. So the next day, we were taken together with the poli -- Jewish police and everybody.\nTaken to the same place where the old people were taken already [indecipherable] and old, old\ncemetery, what Rachel told you, called Rosa, and -- and then I wa -- I met my mother. She --\nwhen she saw me she was surprised, and so upset, and I couldn\u2019t describe you the -- you know, I\ncan\u2019t describe you the -- her face. She was so sure that Ill run away. She was so sure that I will\nsurvive, you know? And that was her only hope. And then they started to let out the people one\nby one, and to select them, one to the right, one to the left, one to the right, one to the left. And\nwe saw that to the left, they are pushing the old people and children, and handicaps. It -- it means\nthey are sending them to death, that we know already. To the right, only young people. And I\nremember that when I -- I think Rachel wer -- we walked out the first and she was sent to the\nright. I was the next and my mother was behind me. And he ask me -- like I was 15 years old,\nmaybe I w-was tall, and he thought maybe I am older, but he ask me, \u201cAre you alone?\u201d I told no,\nno. So he -- he want to push me to the left, and I told, \u201cYes, I am alone.\u201d And he pushed me to\nthe right. And my mother, he didn\u2019t push her, she went immediately to the left. And I stopped\nher, cried, \u201cMa, Ma.\u201d She -- she didn't look at me. That was the last time I saw her. She told us\nthat she went together with -- with my father. They walked out of the ghetto together, but they\nseparated the men from the women, so she didn\u2019t know where my father is. And Rachel\u2019s sister\ndecided go together as a child and with the family, both sisters. They were young, they went\ntogether. And I didn't go with my mother. It was hard fo -- to me, but you know. It was a time\nwhen I ask myself why I didn\u2019t go with my mother, and then I was protecting myself and saying,\noh but my mother was -- would be even more unhappy if she saw me together with her, dying.\nAnd it was only good for the Germans. More Jews are dying, it\u2019s better for them, so why I\nshouldn\u2019t do it? Okay, maybe I\u2019m right, maybe not, but I did it. Th-The moment I didn't think\nabout it, I protected my life. So they gathered all the people from the left side, and they send to\nMajdanek immediately to the gas chambers. They were not even in the concentration camp, not\none day. From the train they took them to the gas chambers immediately. And one person from\nthe whole -- I don\u2019t know how many thousand people were there, because so many thousands\nwere already killed, but I don\u2019t know how many. But one person was run away. And she -- she\nwas a -- a Wi -- a Wife of a engineer who worked with my father. When I came back, she came\nback to Wilna after the work -- after the war, and she learned that I am in hospital right after the\nwar. So she came to me to hospital -- to the hospital, and she told me that your mother was not\nkilled, your mother committed suicide. So I told her I know, because my mother told me, I have\nthe pills, they will not kill me. So she committed suicide in the car already -- in the train, on the\ntrain. She committed suicide and my husband, who was not a husband yet, but the hu -- the\nhusband\u2019s mother -- my husband\u2019s -- 1n the future he was my --",
        "Q: Your future husband.",
        "A: Yeah, my future husband\u2019s mother and his aunt. The aunt was -- worked for a pharmacy and\nshe gave them the pills. Three of them together committed suicide. So that was -- that how I\nlearned how my m -- mother died. And we were taken to a train, and when we went to the train, I\nasked Rachel to run. Come, come. I told her, as soon as we are out of the country, and Ill not\nknow another language, I\u2019Il not run away. I know the language here, I can communicate with the\npeople, I can run. She was not used to run. It was a -- it was a -- really not so easy to decide it.\nShe told me, we will maybe meet my -- my brother in the concentration camp, she couldn\u2019t. And\none --",
        "Q: Joseph?",
        "A: Yeah, Joseph. And one of our girls told wi -- and wa -- that one woman Hiah Shapiro\n[indecipherable] she is now in Israel, she told us, girls, \u2019m running. And she immediately took\nfrom -- from our row to the sidewalk, to a house. I didn\u2019t know that it was the house where she\nlived, and she disappeared, and she survived. She found a way to the woods. It was not so easy\neverything, it was not, but she was in the partisans, and then she -- she run to the\n[indecipherable] Europe. In 1945 she went to -- through Poland, through Hungary, through Italy,\non -- il -- illegal to Palestine.",
        "Q: So you wanted to run?",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t, because I couldn\u2019t run by myself. I had to run with Rachel. That was my father\u2019s\nlast words to me. Don\u2019t run without Rachel. Then many years passed and I thought, how could\nhe tell a child of 15 years such a thing, such a warning? It was a matter of life and death, and\nthat\u2019s it. And we were taken -- we were taken to the train station, to the train and when -- and\nwent to Latvia, to Kaiserwald, then from Kaiserwald to Stutthof. Not to Stutthof, to Strassenhof.\nThere we stayed for the -- more or less a year, and we were working for the [indecipherable |\nmanufacturer. A factory, produced materials for -- for the soldiers, such -- like stuff, I don\u2019t\nknow what they -- what -- they were sewing them, I don\u2019t know from the stuff here -- it\u2019s a web -\n- web machine, yes, web machine, yes? That\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s in English, no? A machine who is --",

        "Q: Can you describe the train ride from Vilnius, I guess you went to Kaiserwald first?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: That was your deportation?",
        "A: Yep.",
        "Q: Can you describe that train ride?",
        "A: First of all, we were, of course, in the wagons, the cars were like for cattles, yeah. We were\nsitting on the floor, close to each other, how many people in one, I don\u2019t know even. Hundred,\n200, I don\u2019t know. Locked the doors, no windows, a small like window, like under the roof. And\nthey were -- you know, we didn't know the direction. We didn\u2019t know where they take -- where\nthey took us. And in a half an hour or an hour was a ride, yeah, suddenly the train stopped. We\nwere sure that it\u2019s Ponary. So they brought us to the place where they shoot the Jews, yeah? So\nwe were waiting and waiting when the door will be opened. I don\u2019t know if they stopped there,\nor in another place. If they stopped it deliberately to make us, you know, so -- it\u2019s like to --\nmorally to -- to f -- to destroy us morally.",
        "Q: To weaken you, really.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh, we were weak -- already weakened. Already. But -- and then the train went on and\nwe suddenly stop -- stopped -- I don\u2019t know how long we went. The whole day, I think, until the\nnext night. I think we went -- we were on the train the whole day, and until in the middle of the\nnight, opened the doors, and we -- we saw big lamps like a -- like that, how it\u2019s called --",

        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: And the lights were centered onto the door -- on the doors of the cars, so we were blind\nabsolutely. We were in the dark the whole time, and suddenly so much light, yeah. And the dogs\nbarking, and we couldn\u2019t see even where we are, and who are around us. There were SS men,\nthese big dogs, you know, how they used to do it. And they were shouting at us, raus, raus,\nfaster, faster, faster. Go, go. And then we were putting in a -- in a row everybody and letting into\na concentration camp. We saw there the gates and we understood that it\u2019s a concentration camp.\nThat\u2019s how we came to the concentration camp. And then for tomorrow, we went out in the\nmorning, we went out to a appelle. I mean --",
        "Q: Roll call.",
        "A: Yeah, we had to -- to show up, everybody has to show up in a -- in -- to stand in a row straight\nlike soldiers, you know?

If they find it, is, you know, there\nis one sentence, death, death, death, yeah? So people gave what they had. And they were taking\nsuch a -- like a -- like a ba -- big bag, and everybody was putting something 1n there, gold rings,\nor something what was left. I think Rachel had something from my mother. My mother took with\nher what was left from the jewelry Veronica didn\u2019t sell, something, a brooch, I think, she took\nwith her, and she gave to Rachel something, and Rachel threw it in the toilet. So they were not\nso, you know, excited [indecipherable] the Germans, they took the toilet out, you know, it was\nnot a toilet where you wash the -- with the -- with the water, yeah, the toilet, you flush it.

        "A: Yeah. And so they took it and they checked it. They fished from there some what do you\nsend, rings or something, and we were laughing at that. It\u2019s a good job for a German soldier.\nThat was it. Then --",
        "Q: Rachel threw it on purpose into the toilet?",
        "A: Yes, of course, of course, yes, yeah. She didn\u2019t tell it, about it? It\u2019s interesting. Well, maybe\nshe doesn\u2019t remember it, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "Q: W-Wasn\u2019t that a dangerous thing to do?",
        "A: No. Who can -- who can know, who can point her out that she did it?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And there were like mountains of sand, so people put it in the sand.",
        "Q: Their jewelry?",
        "A: Their jewelry. So they took it from the sand. They knew everything. But there are -- there\nwere brave people who took it from other people to save it, and saved it, and nobody searched\nus. They were so sure that we are so afraid that we will not hide it. So -- but I remember that a\nacquaintance of mine, when we came already to another concentration camp she had it. She\nthought I took it. That\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "Q: What did she have?",
        "A: She had some jewelry.",
        "Q: Oh, some jewelry.",
        "A: Some jewelry, she took it in from other people.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She asked. The people gave it to her.",
        "Q: At that point, how did you feel? Did you feel brave?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t know. I -- I didn't think to do it, I -- I didn\u2019t -- it was not in my mind to do\nsomething -- some -- such brave things. I son -- I think my bravery I left in Wilna. I was not\nbrave any more. I think so, but maybe. And then we were taken to -- to Strassenhof. It was a\nconcentration camp, but it was more a labor camp, I think, because everybody was working. So it\nwas not so bad. Comparing with ghetto, it was bad. Comparing to the other concentration camp,\nit was not so bad, you know? Bad things are like th -- bad things have stages. Can be bad, be bad,\nit can be more bad, and even more bad. So there was the stages, so we were there, and at once we\nworked for a -- we -- they were building some -- something, a building, a factory, so we worked\nthere. I don\u2019t remember even what we did. Did we dig something, we -- we -- did we take -- use -\n- used to take breaks and bra -- bricks, and --",
        "Q: Bricks.",
        "A: -- and bring it to them? Or we -- I don\u2019t remember exactly what job we did. We helped the\nLatvian people to build it. We were -- we were doing the dirty job for -- you know, the heavy\njob, the dirty job for the builders. And one man who was working there, started to talk to me in\nRussian -- because we didn\u2019t know Latvian, it was a strange country for us. It was in not -- it was\nsimilar to Lithuanian, but we didn't know Lithuanian even very well. We didn\u2019t know. So he\nstarted to talk Russian and we talked to him also, you know. He asked for -- where we are\ncoming from and so on. And he -- one day he brought even food, I think. And one day he told\nme, I'll -- Pll bring you clothes, and you will run away. We were already in the cl -- given the\nclothes of the concentration camp, like stripes, you know? St-Striped clothes, yeah.",
        "Q: Uniforms.",
        "A: Uniforms. You can say uniforms, can -- maybe it is uniforms. I -- I think a uniform is a\nuniform, it isn\u2019t -- something isn\u2019t, but here -- okay. But prisoner uniforms, okay, we\u2019ll say like\nthat. And he told me [Il bring you one and I\u2019Il show you how to run away, and I will bring you\nto the partisans. And I came and I don\u2019t know if I told Rachel or I told her later, and I thought\nwhat to do, what to do? Can I trust him, or he will take me immediately to Gestapo, because\nthere were such things. But I -- I -- I think now that I could trust him, because there were things\nthat -- in Lithuania some people were asking for money, and then they were -- you -- o-or they\nwill hide you or take you to a good place.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: Yeah, so -- so we were in Strassenhof, we were for a year, more or less.",
        "Q: Can I get you to finish that story, what made you dis -- what did you decide about the offer\nfrom the man?",
        "A: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "Q: The -- the Latvian man.",
        "A: Yeah, so I -- I was afraid to believe him, and then I was afraid another thing. The thing is that\nif you run away, they will find it out very easily because they counted us every day in the\nmorning, and every day in the evening. They knew exactly the number of the prisoners. So they\nwill shot their closest. It means Rachel would be shor -- shot, that for sure. And sh -- not she --\nnot only she. So I thought no, I cannot do it. That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t remember telling her. I-I think in --\nin -- I didn\u2019t tell her in concentration camp for -- about it. It was out of my mind. And then we\nwere taken to a f -- to the [indecipherable] manufacturer -- to a factory, and we worked there\ntogether with the Latvian people. The Latvian woman taught us how to manage the machines,\nand she almost left it for us. We were already doing it. We\u2019re happy that we can do such a job,\nbut it was of course, difficult for us, because everybody would -- had to take care of 10 machines\nor something like that. But then we learned from her, we looked how she was stealing the\nmaterial, yeah, and we learned from her. She was not afraid of us.",
        "Q: The Latvian woman?",
        "A: The Latvian woman, so she was stealing, so Rachel told, we can do the same and we can sell\nit, and we can -- I mean sell to get bread for it. And that we were r-risking the life for sure. So\none of us, me, and other times she, was cutting the roll. You have to be very careful how you cut\nthe roll, not to leave the sign. But I think that the people who ah -- were checking --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- checked the -- the [indecipherable] material, you know, the rolls. You are bringing to a\nplace where it was checked, measured probably, knew about that, that the Latvian are doing it.\nAnd they were afraid to tell it, because they probably didn't want to -- to threaten the Latvian\npeople who were working with us. They didn\u2019t think that the Jewish women can dare to do it. I\nbelieve it.",
        "Q: If you cut it, where would you put it?",
        "A: I put it like that, behind, and then Rachel run to the toilet, and she was look --",
        "Q: Wrapped in a towel?",
        "A: -- wrapping it around her waist. We were very thin, that you cannot find it [indecipherable]\nyou didn't look fat after [indecipherable]. Of course it was not a lot, maybe a couple of meters.",
        "Q: But then who would you sell it to?",
        "A: We work -- you know, because we were in touch with Latvian, some of the prisoners were\nfrom Riga, and they spoke Latvian. So they had a connection with the inner -- ou-out -- the world\noutside the concentration camp. See, they used to take it -- in the concentration camp, they used\nto take it to bring it to the Latvian, and the Latvian gave them a bread, and they used to take\nsome bread for themselves, some bread to us. So that makes us more happier. I mean, we were\nhungry, very hungry, because the food was very -- this was very little food there. Rations were\nvery small. A small piece of bread and a little bit margarine and some soup, like waterish --\nwatery soup, like water with some beans in it or something like. So we were very hungry, so this\nwas a support, a big support.",
        "Q: Rachel talked about you wanting to eat your bread all up in the morning.",
        "A: Ah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Every time we received the bread, I told give it my -- give my bread to\nme. She told no, [Pll not give it to you. Give it to me, I\u2019m hungry, give it to me, I want to eat it.\nNo, you will not eat it. Pl give you a piece and that\u2019s it, that\u2019s your breakfast. I am hungry. You\nwill get the other one in the evening. And that save us the life. I don\u2019t know how she knew it, or\nmaybe she learned it from somebody, maybe the instinct, you know, told her to -- to -- not to eat\nit immediately the whole bread and then to be out of food the whole day, what was very bad, of\ncourse.",
        "Q: In the concentration camp, or when you worked, were there ever -- did you ever have an\nexperience where a German seemed sympathetic or helpful?",
        "A: No, it was a -- you know, we were punished for si -- for some things, you -- we used to come\nto the concentration camps so they used to -- we used to stand in lines, they used to count us and\nthen we were punished for something. Somebody did something wrong and we were standing for\nhours, very exhausted, and very tired. And so another time, they thought, oh we had to jump on\none foot around the building, around there. But we were young, and I remember jumping and\nlaughing, you know? We were pushing each other on, and I jumped over to a SS, he was like in a\n-- ina--aSS coat, having a gun. He was like guarding us, yeah. And he was crying. When I saw\nhim crying, I don\u2019t know how I dared, I asked him, what are you crying? So he told, I am not a\nGerman. I am a Romanian. And they -- the Germans lied to me. They told me, would you wa --\nwould you like to go to the front? He was mobilized, yeah, he -- would you -- take into the army,\nI mean. It\u2019s -- how it\u2019s c-called, not mobilized, draft, yeah, 1t was a draft. So he told, won\u2019t you --\nwon\u2019t you -- won\u2019t -- would you like to go to the fr-front line, to the eastern front? No. So you\nwill be an SS. He didn't know what is SS. Okay, I'll be an SS. He was not ver-very young in my\neyes, probably he was 35, so then I was 15, so it was old already for me, you know. So he told\nme -- and I have a daughter like you at home. And I looked at you and I -- and I cannot bear it.\nHe cried. And then I -- in a short time I didn\u2019t see him at all. I don\u2019t know, maybe he left the SS\nand went to the front, I don\u2019t know. I never saw him again. That was one, you know, one person\nwho -- who couldn\u2019t bear the -- who -- looking how we were punished and how we were beaten\nor -- then a group of girls run away, and from the same place where the Russian Latvian guy was\nworking. So they shot every 10\". They were counting when the -- when girls are standing on the\nappelle, they were counting one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, out and th --\nevery 10 -- 10\" people -- person was shot. So we knew we -- we are risking very much. And I\nremember that one lady told, we have to watch each other not to let run away some other --\nsomebody. So I told her, are you crazy? Let run away everybody who can. We will be shot at,\nnot -- not earlier, so it\u2019s later. But let everybody run. If I could, I would ru -- run, but -- but I --\nthat was I refused this time, and I didn\u2019t have another time.",
        "Q: So you -- you -- what did you think was going to happen to you?",
        "A: You know, we heard already that the army, the Soviet army is coming. We -- we didn\u2019t\nbelieve that they will let us alive.",
        "Q: The Germans.",
        "A: The Germans. We thought they will kill everybody and that\u2019s it. It will be the final solution.\nWe didn\u2019t hear about the final solution there, but we he -- knew exactly what they want to do\nwith us, yeah. That\u2019s it. Maybe I -- I remember that s -- the Soviet army started to bomb Riga.\nAnd the Germans came running to the concentration camp, they\u2019re hiding themself. Oh, we were\nso happy to -- to look at them, how afraid they were of their lives, yeah. I remember opening the\nwindow, telling them come, come to us. We are not -- we are not afraid to die of your bomb, but\ntogether with the Germans. Here we all were making signs to them for -- through the window\nand praying, come, come the bomb to -- to throughout yeah -- to throughout the concentration\ncamp [indecipherable] building. Didn\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t know where they bombed, but they didn\u2019t\nbomb the concentration camp. Yeah.",
        "Q: So when -- can you describe when you leave the work camp? I want to keep going\nchronologically --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- you worked for a year --",
        "A: For a year, then --",
        "Q: -- then what happened?",
        "A: Then what happened. They shaved our heads, gave something else to wear, I think, other\nuniform, and --",
        "Q: Your heads weren\u2019t shaved the first year?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Rachel cut me the hair in the first -- in -- in Kaiserwald, but then I had my hair until I was --\nour concentration camp was evacuated already. So it means they were evacuated, we knew that\nthe Soviet army is coming. So they took us to the -- to a -- to the s-sea, and they -- we were going\naways -- be -- they took us to a -- a ship, and went to -- by the sea, we went to -- to Stutthof.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: This is another concentration camp, which was not a labor camp any more, it was only\nconcentration camp. And the death rate was very big, of course, very high. And crazy things,\ncrazy things there. Even in -- being in Strassenhof, they made a list of everybody who is younger\nthan 16 and older than 30. And they took all the people older than 30 years and younger than 16.\nSo because of Rachel, I was in -- not 1n the list, because she asked me to write myself older, not\nto be a child. So I write myself not, so then I was probably 16, so I was two years older, so I was\n18, so they didn\u2019t take me. So then I went to Stutthof, it was -- it was horrible, it was -- we went -\n- we were placed in a block, meaning a -- such a shtuba, a house, a wooden house where\ncriminals were in -- the bosses of the -- of -- of the houses, like a Russian criminal was a -- a\nwoman was -- she was the boss of our house, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. H-How did you know she was a criminal?",
        "A: You can see by her language. The curses, by the way of her behavior, I don\u2019t know, or maybe\nshe was a prostitute maybe, not a criminal, and like that. And one time they told us to load big\nstones on wagons to push them down -- down the hill, then to push them up the hill, to unload\nthem, then to load them again, push down the hill. It\u2019s not so easy to push them hen -- down on\nthe hill there, have to go very slowly, so you have to hold. They were loaded by -- with this --\nwith brick stones, and to push it up the hill also, like that, the -- a whole day, yeah. All that to\nmake you happy. Then, of course, the beatings, and the st -- the illnesses, the starving was, you\nknow, it was over -- we were overwhelmed with dirt, with lice, with -- it was awful. Then one\nday somebody told that they are taking some young people to work for the farmers. So we went\nwith Rachel. There was -- we stayed there probably two or three months. We worked very hard,\nbut at least we were more or less free. We could wash ourself, we washed our clothes, we were\nmore or less clean, you know, and the food was like, you know, the maid of the ba -- of the f-\nfarmer gave us a key of the basement where the potatoes were, and so we had it. But in three\nmonths they took us back -- they took us back, so they took us to a shower. And you never knew,\nif you are taken to a shower, it will be water from there, from the ceiling, or it will be death, who\n-- they\u2019Il kill you. Because they used to do it from the same things, you know, the -- where the\nshowers are, they used to -- to send the gas to the area you are closed, yeah.",
        "Q: How did you know that though?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but we knew.",
        "Q: Just knew.",
        "A: Yeah. We knew -- we saw the crematorium. The crematorium had smoke 24 hours a day, it\nnever stopped smoking, the smoke was black and smell it [indecipherable] the smell was\nhorrible. So we knew that they are burning people there. We knew it.",
        "Q: Wh-Where was this?",
        "A: In Stutthof.",
        "Q: Stutthof.",
        "A: Yeah, it was not in Strassenhof, it was in Stutthof, yeah. And every time, every appelle is\nselecting people to the crematorium.",
        "Q: Could you tell how they were selecting?",
        "A: Oh, they were going like -- you are standing five people in a row, and you -- the SS men used\nto go and look at you. And I don\u2019t know, I -- I learned one thing, don\u2019t show in your eyes that\nyou are afraid, because if you are afraid, oh, they look at you. Don\u2019t show that you hate the --\nhate them so much that you will kill them, otherwise, he will take you. Look at -- look -- don\u2019t\nlook at them at all. Look through them, you know?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Like he would be a glass, and you look through them to -- to some point, I don\u2019t know, and\nlook very indifferently. It\u2019s not very [indecipherable]. Oh, you won\u2019t -- you don\u2019t take me, you\u2019ll\ntake me, maybe it\u2019s even better than -- such a life is better death [indecipherable] no. We are\nnever selected, with Rachel.",
        "Q: How did you manage to always stay -- it sounds like you were always physically with her,\nthat you didn\u2019t get separated too much.",
        "A: No, not too much at all. I don\u2019t know how we managed. I don\u2019t know how.",
        "Q: What -- what was it like when you were separated for some reason?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember being separated?",
        "A: No. Not in the concentration camps, never. We were afraid of it.",
        "Q: So if one of you was asked to do something, would the other one say, I\u2019ll go with you?",
        "A: No. Ju -- were not asked individual -- individually to do something. It\u2019s a group.\n[indecipherable] 10 people [indecipherable] we went together.",
        "Q: What would you talk about at night together?",
        "A: At night we used to talk how good it was at home. How tasty was the food what I hated and\ndidn\u2019t eat. And I always thought, where is the kasha Mama gave me, and where is the milk I\ndidn\u2019t want to drink? And that\u2019s all, and some such things, and then where are our parents, our\nsisters, and brothers? Are they in a concentration camp like we? Can they survive? And so on.\nYeah, and then we are -- we were [indecipherable] to a -- to a house after being in -- working for\nthe farmers, we are [indecipherable] a house, which was -- there were only sick people. Were no\nbeds, it was -- it were no beds before also, but it were be -- wooden beds, you know, in like --",
        "Q: Bunks?",
        "A: How?",
        "Q: Bunks?",
        "A: Bunks, yeah?",
        "Q: Wooden beds --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- on top of each other, mm-hm.",
        "A: So -- and here no bed -- no, no beds at all. Everybody was sitting on the floor, and because we\nwere so crowded, so many people were, so we were sitting in a row, like my legs were a little bit\nspread in me, another person in me, like five. And we were sleeping like that, everybody was\nleaning towards the other. And that was the worst. People were dying like -- like, you know,\nflies. I remember I woke up, I was lying -- I was leaning -- leaning a li -- leaning up a -- a -- a\nwoman who was dead already. So, I mean, my head was on the dead corpse already, corpse. And\nevery morning used to come several men who were taking the corpses out of us, of our room,\nyeah. And once I heard that the kapo who was coming and directing the people what to do, from\nwhich line to take the corpses, spoke Polish. So I ask him, look, how is this Red army? Is she\ncoming? How far are they? Because we listen -- we heard already the bombs, the -- you know,\nthe -- the bullets falling, you know. So he told me, what are you doing here? A language is a\nsuch powerful -- powerful thing, you know? It\u2019s such a connection between people who are not\nconnected and maybe not even like each other. But he her -- he didn\u2019t hear Polish very much,\nand suddenly he heard Polish. So he ask me if [indecipherable] I mean miss. Oh, what I didn\u2019t\nhear wa -- for -- you know, for years. What are you doing here? I told him, you don\u2019t know what\nI\u2019m doing here? [indecipherable] do you know that you will die here? Nobody will be alive here.\nGo out of here. How -- how can we go out of here? So he told me, and he said, today will come a\nGerman and take some people to work with the kitchen, with potatoes, to wash it, to prepare\nfood, I don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t be afraid, he underline me, it\u2019s not to the crematorium. Go for -- and --\nand stand up -- stand there in a line and wait until they will take you. And then it was -- one\nGerman or two came, and we went with Rachel and they took us. Took us together again. Went\nto another house where we are having to do these potatoes, you know. Bad, frozen potatoes,\npreparing it for a dinner for the -- for the prisoners. And sleeping already in a room which had\nthe wooden beds, yeah. And then we heard that they are evacuate -- ready to evacuate the whole\nconcentration camp. Who can go, who can work? The others? They will -- they will take -- they\nwill make a fire and everything will be burned, and that what they did. And we were evacuated.\nWe went on that -- we went o-on the Death March, with this --",
        "Q: Did -- did you choose to go?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t remember if we choose --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- see, I -- I think they didn\u2019t ask us. They didn\u2019t ask us anything, they told us to go, so we\nwent. It was a horrible, of course, we were -- first of all, it was cold, it was the end of February,\nthe beginning of March, it was cold. It was snowing, it was freezing. We were -- we were 1n such\nuniforms, as they gave us such, you know, things to cover us, is a -- like sheets, you know, some\nto cover us. And the lice were all over us, I remember th -- th -- I [indecipherable] everything\nwas -- iS -- 1s moving. They gave us a -- a piece of bread and go. And on the way we saw the\nhorses, together with German families, they were running from the Russians already, so they\nload on the horses everybo -- everything -- on the carts actually, and th-they were running, and\nsometimes Polish people were -- which were taken from Poland to work for the Germans were\nshouting to us, ma -- to encourage us. So --",
        "Q: Like what would they say?",
        "A: Let -- s-stay alive, stay alive, the Russians are coming. Stay alive, stay alive, the Russians are\ncoming. It\u2019s not far, it\u2019s not far, but you -- you can hear. You can see the red sky from the fire of\nthe front, you know, and the Germans were running. And then they took us to a -- one small\ncamp. We were -- I don\u2019t know, we were there for a week or so. And then they took us from the\nsmall camp to -- again, was a march, yeah, and then they marched in -- we -- we came to a barn,\nyeah. They opened the door and they told us to go. We didn\u2019t know that people are there, and we\nstarted to walk over the people. The screaming was so [indecipherable] we couldn\u2019t -- we -- we\ncouldn\u2019t understand what\u2019s -- and the other rows are pushing us, yeah, and we cannot walk\nbecause we are walking on the bodies of other people, heads, there were legs. But that was the\nlast place. They close the door and we didn\u2019t hear from the Germans any more. The -- they -- we\nwere -- it was night, in the morning we wanted to go out, and we looked, you know, through the\ndoor, and we looked for a -- for a s -- piece of light where -- where -- where we can see what\u2019s\ngoing on there. And we started to knock on the door. And some women were shouting, don\u2019t\nknock, they will shoot us. And we knocked. We knocked, we knocked, nobody was there, so we\nstarted to push the door. And we pushed it open, no Germans. And we saw the road, and over\nthere, the army, the -- the Soviet army is standing. So a group of young girls, and including me\nand Rachel, we run to the soldiers, yeah? We wanted to embrace them. They saw us, they started\nto run away. Because we -- then they told us that we looked so horrible, that they were afraid.\nWhat -- what are they, shadas of pe -- of some corpses, or some dead people, or -- who 1s\nrunning? And we are -- were dirty, of course. And th-then they told us that we -- they were not\nallowed to come over to us because we carried typhus and other illnesses. So 1t would be an\nepidemic, you know, they were afraid of the army. They wanted to protect them. So they run,\nand we run after them. And we came to a village, a German village. And I was sick, I was alr --\nalready absolutely sick. I felt that I -- I -- I was coughing, and I had the high fever. I felt it, I\ndidn\u2019t have a -- a thermometer to -- to measure the fever. And we came over to a German village,\nwe open the one house we wanted to enter. So a family was sitting around the table and telling\nus, raus. So we wacked out -- we walked out. We walked out and I saw a Russian officer going\nthrough, and -- and I knew Russian, so I told him, look, you liberated us, but we don\u2019t have\nwhere to stay. What -- what do you mean where you don\u2019t have where to stay? I told, they are\nnot alone. Oh yeah? He took this, his pistol, opened the door, opened the pistol and told, if you\ndon\u2019t go away from this house, you will be killed. So they left and we occupied the house. I lied\ndown near a stove, which was [indecipherable] was hot. I was so cold, shivering. And Rachel\nwas very active. She took all my clothes off, and put in the stove, yet it was bong, bong, like the\nlice and everything what -- and everybody did it, yes, some other girls came in. Then they took\nwater, they boiled the water and we washed ourself. Then we took some clothes there that was in\nthe house because we couldn\u2019t stay naked, of course, and we couldn\u2019t use the old uniforms\n[indecipherable]. Then came -- we were already cleaner, a little bit, it came to feeding myself. I\nremember Rachel brought a -- a piece of bread. Fresh bread, smelled a -- a -- she gave it to me.\nSo I gave one bite and I told, look at, I am full already, I cannot eat any more. And she told, you\nknow, I don\u2019t know why, but I am full also. So we stopped eating, and other people started to eat\na lot. Then they were dying, you know, why it was something in the stomach and the emergency\nhad no time, the military emergency, to take them to the hospital, they were dying. And we\nsurvived only because we couldn\u2019t eat. We twe -- we -- we didn\u2019t know, we were so young that\nwe didn\u2019t know that you -- when you were starved al-almost to death so many -- for so many\nyears, you can\u2019t eat a lot. You have to start from the beginning, a little bit, a little bit. Then, to\nmake the story short, because it\u2019s so -- so very shor -- big story, we are -- stayed there for a\nmonth, and we are allowed by the Soviet government [indecipherable] the military government\nto -- to go home. So we went to a train, and we went to ho -- Poland. Trains were not passenger\ntrains, trains -- also the soldiers were there, and it was a mixture, a mixture. And seems that the\nwhole population is moving. One 1s going to Germany, the other is going from Germany, and\neverybody is moving. We met Polish people from Wilna who told me that my house is already\nbombed, that I don\u2019t have a house, and it was true. That I learned in Poland on the train. The mid\n-- in the middle of the -- the woods, the train would stop, and the -- the train -- and -- and the\npeople -- some people came from the woods and robbed. Everybody took the b-belongings from\neverybody, because what the other people did, even from Lithuania, from Poland, went together\nwith the Soviet army to Germany, took belongings of -- the German belongings, you know,\njewelry -- what -- what they left behind. And li -- and they brought it back to their country and\nsold it all for theirself, I don\u2019t know. There were already such people, businessmen, yeah, or\nbusinesswomen. So the others knew it, and they -- they were taking the belongings of these\npeople. And we laughed with Rachel because we didn\u2019t have anything, so nobody took from us\nanything. That\u2019s it, and then we came closer to our border already, Lithuanian border, and we\nchanged the trains, of course, and some Soviet officers told us, come girls to us, sit down there to\ntheir [indecipherable] yeah. And the train went to Lithuania, yeah. So she started to ask us from\nwa -- from where we are coming now, and what -- and they saw how they look. So we told them\nthe truth, what it was and -- so one told us, look, you know that on the border of Lithuania and\nPoland, you will be stopped. And because you don\u2019t have papers, no identification papers, no\nnothing, no passports, no in -- identification papers. So we will be taken in a -- in a camp. I told,\nwhat? I am not going in any camp any more, any camp, if 1t was German, or Russians, I don\u2019t\ncare. So he -- so I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m going to die in Wilna. I was sure that I am dying. I was -- felt like\ndying, yeah. So, but I will die in Wilna where I was born. I don\u2019t want to die in Germany of\ncourse, I don\u2019t want to die in Poland. So they told, you know what? We will hide you. And there\nwere some machines inside, what probably the Soviets were taking from the Germans already,\nlike -- like to make x-rays. I saw the [indecipherable] like from some medicine machines or\nsomething like that, I don\u2019t know. I saw it for x-rays. And they hide us over there. And then the -\n- the train stopped, and the people came over, also military people with lamps, lights everything\nlooked around, asked them for papers, the officers gave them the papers. They ask, is there\nanybody else here? No, nobody is here. Oh, okay. So the door was closed, and the train came to\nKovno to Kaunas, not to Wilna. Oh, so that we are free. Good, we are almost home. Kovno from\nWilna is hundred kilometer only. So we walked out, and we were arrested immediately because\nwe -- oh, to look at us, you can see what we -- where we came from. And they asked us for\ndocuments and we don\u2019t have it. So give us a passport, give us something, we don\u2019t have. So we\nstarted to tell them that we were taken fro -- b-by the Germans. Uh-huh, come to KGB. And then\nthey started, we will arrest you, you\u2019re spies, you\u2019re -- everybody was spies, and you\u2019re\nprostitutes, you -- you run to the -- together with the -- with the ger -- German army. Look at us,\nI thought [indecipherable] you will look at us, saw how we look, the hair shaved, and -- but what\nwas -- I don\u2019t know what they would do this as, if not a Jewish guy who was in Kovno already\nsaw how the soldiers took us like that, you know, took us to the -- to the KGB. So they run there,\nwe didn\u2019t know it, and they -- with money. So they gave her money for -- to the officer who took\nus, yeah, to [indecipherable] us, yeah. And he let us go.",

But it was -- it\nwas hundred kilometers. Now, you can make in a -- in an hour or less, but it was no way to go\nthere, only by train.

        "A: I remember my mother. My mother was very -- can\u2019t say upset, because it\u2019s more than upset.\nShe was very unhappy with it. And fer -- we had books at home, books of -- books which\ndescribed the situation in Germany after Hitler come -- came to power. It was called, I remem --\nI remember it, the book was la -- lying on -- on the table in our room in -- in-in my bedroom. So\nit was called Brunatnec Shenga in Polish. Brunatnec, it means brown, because fascists had\nbrown, you know, shirts. And it was horrible. There -- there are pictures there about the\nconcentration camps already in Germany. At first. political concentration camp. Communist\nparty in Germany was very popular, and a lot of Germans were communists, so the first victims\nwere the communists of course, you know. And my mother -- my mother knew the Germans\nvery well. I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t think she was born in -- in -- in Germany. I th -- her mother\nwas born in Germany, so -- and they used to go to Germany every -- every summer, probably.\nAnd my mother knew the character of the Germans, so she told my father, I remember, we have\nto leave Wilna. We have to out of it. Go out of Europe. I hate it. He didn\u2019t want. He didn\u2019t want.\nShe wanted to emigrate, to the States, to Canada, to Australia, but not to stay in Europe. That\u2019s it.\nThat was it, yeah. That why I remember it. And -- but we waited the Germans to come to -- to\nWilna in 1939 already, because Polish army couldn\u2019t stand -- couldn\u2019t protect Poland, was too\nweak. Poles are very good soldiers actually, but they didn\u2019t have the tanks, they didn\u2019t have the\nequipment the -- the Germans had, so -- but the Russian came before. They occupied Wilna, they\noccupied all the -- the best, Belaru --White Russia, Belarusia, White Russia and Ukraine. So we\nfound ourselves in -- occupied by Russians. What was better than by Germans, of course. It was\nprobably two, three months m -- the Russians were in Wilna, the hosts of Wilna, ba -- but then\nthey gave it to Lithuania. The day the Lithuanians wanted to take over Wilna was a fight between\nthe Poles and -- the Polish -- the remnants of the Polish army and the Lithuanian army. But the\nfight was very, very short. And suddenly they decided that it has to be a pogrom. They have to --\nto kill Jews. We don\u2019t know why. Couldn\u2019t understand why. What has it to do with -- with pola -\n- with Poland and Lithuania? They were always tense. There were no diplomatic relationships\nbetween pola -- Poland and Lithuania before, even. So the day the Lithuanian occupied -- no,\ntook over Wilna, so it was a pogrom. I was at home, my mother didn\u2019t allow me to go to school,\nbut my son -- my brother was 1-in school, and she was so nervous about it. And -- and then it was\nthe whole day, broken glasses, and so on and so on. But then I think that a delegation of Jewish\npeople went to the Russians, who gave the city to Lithuanian. But they had a place where they\njust -- they were -- that their armia was standing there, together with their tanks and everything.\nSo the Jews went there and asked them for helping us. And they decided -- the Russians decided\nto go with the tanks through the streets. And that was enough. They didn\u2019t do anything, they\ndidn't kill anybody, they didn\u2019t -- the Russians I mean. They went through the streets with their\ntanks, and it was quiet, quiet. It\u2019s a -- quiet down everybody. Then my brother came back from\nschool, late in the evening. He -- he told us that they barricaded the windows and the doors with\n[indecipherable] the tables they had in the classes. And they were waiting. Nothing special. Was\nno killed people, no, nothing. Only the -- the windows were broken. That is -- that what I\nremember, the beginning of -- of the war. And then they were almost a year -- yeah, then the\nLithuanian were -- they started learning Lithuanian -- the Lithuanian language at school, and --\nanother language. We had a lot of languages in school. Had Yiddish, Polish, Hebrew, German\nand then Lithuanian, instead of --",
        "A: You know, that was for change that stores were -- special stores were open, Lithuanian stores,\nLithuanian companies came over. Interesting that the Polish president, the portrait of the Polish\npresident was gone from the wall in our classroom, and the Lithuanian sign is -- their official\nsign is a -- a horse, and -- don\u2019t remember [indecipherable] there. A horseman, who has a horse\nwith a sword, I think, something like that.",
        "A: Yeah, a man on a horse, yeah. Oh, and that was on the wall. So I remember such a thing, that\nwe decided to open the windows, that was in winter, we decided to open the windows in the\nclassroom, and it was before the language of -- oh, oh -- the lesson of the Lithuanian language,\nthe teacher came in, said, \u201cIt\u2019s so cold, why didn\u2019t you open the li -- why did you open the li --\nthe windows?\u201d So we said, \u201cThe horse is stinking.\u201d Suddenly, we became Polish patriots. We --\nwe played with the Polish children in the street, and we used to -- to throw on the sidewalks a -- a\n-- the Lithuanian money, with the sign of their horse, and to beat it. And to -- and to say, go to\nKovno, go back to Kovno, go back to Kovno. Kovno was their capital. They made Wilna the\ncapital after that. Capital of Lithuania. Well, that was -- we became one block with the Poles\nagainst the Lithuanian. Why? I don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t ask me, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: For --",
        "A: At what time you\u2019re asking it?",
        "A: After that was quiet and -- it was quiet until the -- the World War II came to us. It was quiet,\nyeah. Then, after -- how long was a -- a reign of the Lithuanian was a half a year, or a year? A\nyear, almost a year. Then the Russians decided to occupy the whole Lithuania. They gave them\nWilna, but they occupied the whole, you know. And then it was Russia already. In 1940 was\nRussia, until -- and in ninete -- 1941 when the World War started, yeah.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t care about it because I spoke Russian and it was my language [indecipherable]. So,\nbut the year when the Russians were there, this year, was not a bad year for Jewish people. A lot\nof Jewish school, Yiddish schools were open, yes, but I -- I -- I have to say that the Hebrew\nschools were closed, I don\u2019t know why. They were against the Hebrew, everything what was\nHebrew was not good. And of course, religious people suffered. But Yiddish secular schools\nwere -- a lot of Jewish secular schools were open, and we had a lot -- much more students in our\ngymnasium than before.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Not only that, but ther -- th -- 1t was a part of very poor people, who couldn\u2019t\nafford to pay for school. That\u2019s why their children were at home, I don\u2019t know, looking for a job,\nlooking for something. I don\u2019t know what they were doing, but they couldn\u2019t attend schools. And\nthen, when the Russians came, the schools were for free. And not only that, but every child had\nto be at school. Had to be at school. So they came, and they were -- we have so many students.\nThat was -- for the poor people was much better.",
        "A: Yeah, it was a Jewish bakery.",
        "A: No. No, everything -- in [indecipherable] were not in charge of our house. Everything was\ngone to the government. The government took over everything. Yeah, that\u2019s -- yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. [indecipherable] we are still in our house, yeah. Some were -- wanted us to go out of the\nhouse and to take over the house, it was a problem there. But we stayed in the house, and my\nfather had the same position, but the technical -- Yiddish technical -- Jewish technical school was\na part of the pole -- Polish technical school. It means they were like one school, but one was total\n-- that stu -- Polish students were taught in Polish and the e -- Jews in -- in Yiddish. But my\nfather was this -- had the -- had the same position still, this year.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, because we are at school. I was already the first grade of gymnasium. But the\nschool was -- was renamed, it was already not a gymnasium, but a high -- but a high school, and\nI was not in the first grade of the gymnasium, but I was in the fifth grade of that 10 years school -\n- high school. It was a 10 years high school. But --",
        "A: I think that yeah. But 1 -- I don\u2019t think that it could be done already, it was too late. It was too\nlate, because I don\u2019t think the Russians would allow us to go out. Poland didn\u2019t exist already.\nPart of the -- of Poland was Germany, and part Russia, that\u2019s it. So, but she talked about it, yeah.\nShe talked about it. But she didn\u2019t know how to do it over there, they said she was -- it\u2019s a --\nproblem of immigration was closed for us, it\u2019s [indecipherable]. But a friend of mine, who was\nthe same class, and his mother was a teacher of our school, their -- his father immigrated to the\nStates. He went to Europe for a conference in 1939, but before the war started, before September.\nHe went there with [indecipherable] oldest son. He was in Belgium, I think. And when the war\nstarted, he took a ship and he went to ton -- to the States, America. Then he send the papers to\n[indecipherable] his w-wife and the other son to come, and they received the visa. And they were\nthe -- the only people who -- who\u2019d leave Russia because they had already the visa, then\nLithuanian were there. So they were allowed to go. And he\u2019s still in the States, my friend.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Of course, yes. We were sure that it will -- the war stop, it will not remain like that. It was like\neverything was -- fe-felt temporary. That today is like that, tomorrow can be changed everything,\nyeah. It was not stable. Anything was not.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And then we -- it was -- we finished school, I had -- we planned to go to -- leave\nfor vacation, and the bombs started to fall on Wilna, and my mother told my father immediately,\nwe have to run for Russia. And he didn\u2019t want because he had a sister there. A sister who was\nolder than he was and she was like a mother for him. The mother was sick then, he was the\nyoungest boy -- y-youngest child in his family and she was taking care of him. So he didn\u2019t -- he\ndidn\u2019t want to leave without her. So he used to go to her -- to her apartment, to ask her to leave\nwith them, and she didn\u2019t want. Her husband was in the States already. He visited his brother in\n1938, and the -- the war started and he couldn\u2019t come back. So he was in the States. So she was\nalone with one daughter, and she told [indecipherable] we are not communists, and we are not\nmen, who will touch us? People were so naive. Oh, that\u2019s all the communist propaganda what\nyou know, that is not true. Hitler is -- we know ge -- we know Germans. Germans were here in\nthe first World War, and they were not so bad, we can survive with it, and so he didn't want to\nleave his [indecipherable] until the second day of the war. My mother packed his -- her bag.\nThey gave me a bag, a small bag, he gave -- she gave my brother a small bag and she told my\nfather goodbye. We are running, and you want to stay with your sister, stay. So he went with us.\nBut it was too late. It was too late. We went to the station, we found [indecipherable] train and\nwe went -- the train started to go, but then it were -- it was bombed. It -- it was a horrible story\nwith the train. [indecipherable] with the train was put on hold in the middle of the f -- the forest.\nStop it.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: So, talking about a train that it stopped in -- in the middle of the forest, and I didn\u2019t mention\nthat the train was full, people who were running from the Germans. A lot of them were soldiers\nand officers from the Red army, Soviet army, with families. And the others were Jews, and\n[indecipherable] communists who wanted to run from the fascists. But the civilian were mostly\nJews, and a small group of Lithuanian, yeah. So -- and the train was s-stopped before the old\nborder of Soviet Union because we were still on the occupied pass of the -- the Lithuanian\nterritory and the White Russia territory who belonged to Poland and was occupied by the\nGermans as I told before, after the -- the -- after the war start with Poland. And so the train\nstopped before the old Soviet border, and they -- the -- it was the -- the army who was -- the\nSoviet army that -- not that -- it was the encoverdere army. It was not KGB, but it was a part of\nit, like. They told everybody has to leave the train, but that the women has to leave on the right\nside of the train, and the military man with the families -- with their families on the left side.\nThen they closed all the windows and the doors from the right side where we were standing.\nThey opened the doors for the left side, they let in the military men together with their families,\nand that\u2019s it. And they went. The train started to roll -- to go, and we started to cry and to ask and\nto shout and to -- don\u2019t leave us, and the train left. Then I looked around, the forest was full with\nluggage. Nobody to-took the luggage, they throw out and the people didn\u2019t know what to do,\nthey started to walk to the border. And I remember my father coming to the border, showed his\npassport and told him that he was a -- a member already of a union, and that wa -- there are my\ndocuments. No, no, you are spies. Everything na -- we were -- we didn\u2019t have the passports of\nthe Soviet Union. We were not citizens of the Soviet Union, we were the citizens of the country\nLithuania, who was occupied by the Soviets, but they didn\u2019t change the passports yet, the\ncitizenships yet. They couldn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t let us in. Then we -- we made kilometers and\nkilometers during the day. We walked -- it was such a hot summer like -- like this summer, 1941\nsummer was very hot. And I remember my mother and -- complained that she cannot walk so\nlong in that. And then at night we came to a place and we found a house open and empty already,\nno people. So we -- my father decided we have to rest there. We came in together with another\nfamily, and in the middle of the night came a peasant, a Polish peasant, or a White Russian\npeasant, I don\u2019t know, and said you have to run, because there are German parachutists already\nhere. So you have to run. So the other family took the -- the bag, they -- one bag of -- of -- the\nlight bags because the big bags were left behind. So, and they run. And my father, like a\nmathematician, he told, look, if it\u2019s true that there are Germans all over here, so it\u2019s\n[indecipherable] to run. If it\u2019s not true, so we will start in the morning, we have to rest. And that\nwas too late already. When -- 1n a war, every minute counts. The other family found a -- a bus\nand they were safe. And they survived the war. I met them after the war, that was -- yeah. And\nwe were caught by the Germans. And that\u2019s it, and we decided to go back.",
        "A: In the morning we went farther and we entered a small village. We found there a Jewish\nfamily who let us come in and have a little bit water, a tea, I don\u2019t remember even if it was food.\nNo, I don\u2019t remember, it was a horrible time. And -- and suddenly the Germans come -- came in\nwith -- on tanks and motorcycles and they occupied the village, and at once started the pogrom.\nPogrom. The neighbors came and took over everything from the -- from the people who -- who\nallowed us to stay, and our things also, our belongings that -- our belongings were three small\nbags, like. And that\u2019s it, and it was finished. Then the Germans took my brother to dig some\nholes, I don\u2019t know, they took him. And they told my mother that they will -- he will come back\nin two hours or something. We waited for two hours and he didn\u2019t come back so my mother went\nto them. It\u2019s interesting that the roles of my father and my mother changed immediately when the\nwar started. She started to be the head of the family, not my father. She was -- before the war, he\nwas the head of the family, he was the person who brought that money to -- to the family, yeah,\nsupported the family, and she was a quiet lady, who loved books, to read a lot, and during the\nnight even. And that [indecipherable]. The roles chan -- changed. She started to be energetic,\nstarted -- concentrated and her German. Her German was her mo -- her mother tongue, of course.\nAnd she went to the Germans and they gave her the -- my -- back the brother -- the hale -- son.\nShe came back together with him, and she told, we have to go back home. Here we are strangers\nfrom -- nobody knows us and -- and -- and he -- and it was a long walk home. I don\u2019t remember\nwho told us don\u2019t go through the forest because you will be ar -- killed by the people, or the\npeasants there. You will be robbed, you will be killed and so on. So they decided to go along the\nhighways. So the German army was approaching, going deep to Russia, and we were going back\nto Lithuania to Wilna. Perhaps it\u2019s interesting, 1t was a false -- f-first front of the Germans. They\nwere soldiers, 1t was Wehrmacht. They didn\u2019t do any harm to us. First of all, they didn\u2019t know\nwho we are. They know that we are people who are -- run from them, but they didn't know we\nwere Jews or non-Jews, or -- and sometimes they threw us cigarettes, what my father was -- he --\nhe couldn\u2019t bear not to smoke, he was a smoker, and he -- it was like better than bread for him.\nYeah. And sometimes we went through a village, so they ask for water, so there were people\nwho didn\u2019t allow us in to take water. To come over and to take water. No food, no water.",
        "A: I think it was there two weeks, probably. I remember only one old lady, a peasant, asked us to\ncome in, and she gave us bread and milk. But it was unusual for us. Very unusual. She told, \u201cMy\nson is on the front fighting with the Germans, I don\u2019t know where he is, so maybe another family\nwill give him some bread.\u201d Then we came home. Of course, Wilna was occupied already for 10\ndays, or -- or -- I don\u2019t remember the day we came back, don\u2019t remember. And the lady th -- was\n-- who lived with us --",
        "A: Julia was home, and she welcomed us, yeah. She was happy and pride [indecipherable]. Yeah.\nIt\u2019s a lot to -- to tell. The first was my brother, what my brother did, he wrote a letter to Rachel.\nAnd the only person who walked through the st -- streets was me. So he gave me the letter.\nRachel accused me that I probably read the letter, but I don\u2019t remember if I read it or not. I don\u2019t\nthink so.",
        "A: The men didn\u2019t dare to walk the street, because it was very dangerous, they would be caught.\nMy mother didn\u2019t want it, so it just left me. I was 13 years old, and I went and pe -- we were in\nanother district, absolutely far from Rachel. I had to go through all the city, and the -- the most\ndangerous, I thought, dangerous place was a bridge, to cross a bridge because soldiers were\nalready standing there and guarding the bridge, the Germans soldiers of course, and I -- I\nremember coming over, saying mm-hm, [indecipherable] ask you for documents or not. I\ndecided to jump on one foot, like playing.",
        "A: I was thir -- yeah -- I was 13 years old, why not? I jumped -- I jumped through the bridge.\nAnd they looked at me and smiled. Then I run. Run again to her house. Now I have to bring back\n-- a letter back from her to my brother.",
        "A: Don\u2019t remember. I was so overwhelmed with the danger to cross city, that I don\u2019t re -- I think\nshe was happy and unhappy at the same time. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, they were all over the streets, the soldiers and their ve-vehicles, their cars and tanks,\nand -- o-over the street, so it was not difficult to -- to see it. And then I think my mother -- yeah,\nmy mother told me to go to her cousin, to visit her cousin. And -- and I -- I almost\n[indecipherable] caught in their apartment already mixing something up, maybe it was then the\nSoviets were in Wilna. I don\u2019t remember who was -- the police was there, and searching their\napartment. And I was afraid that they will not allow me to go back. And I don\u2019t remember it was\nthe germa -- Germans or the Russians. Don\u2019t remember exactly, because they were rich people.\nWe were not rich, we were middle class [indecipherable] middle class, and you know, but they\nwere rich people, so I don\u2019t remember who searched the apartment, but tha-that was the moment\nI was scared that I will not be able to go back home.",
        "A: Yeah, all the time. All the time, I don\u2019t know, all the time. It was -- we had a Polish lady we\nwere very friendly with. She was a p-poor lady, she was a relative of the German lady who lived\nwith us. It means, this German lady was married to her brother. The brother was a -- a Russian\nofficer in Russia, and was killed in ninet -- in -- in the first World War. So she was alone and she\ncame back to our family. And we loved the lady his Veronica, what I gave the name to the Yad\nVashem, her name. And I am talking about it. It\u2019s interesting. I am. So she told me after the war\nwhy my mother was so sure that I will survive. Nobody di -- what -- happens to me. It was -- she\nhad a dream when she gave birth to me. After she gave -- gave birth, she was tired, of course,\nand she fell asleep. And she had a dream that the angel came to her and told her that when your\ndaughter will be 13 years old, it will be a war in which your whole family will be killed, perish,\nall but not your daughter. She will survive it. So she was sure that -- and you know, she was so --\nshe was thinking about the -- the dream all the time, but I didn\u2019t know it, a-as I told you, I -- I\nknew it after the war, I learned it from Veronica. That why she insisted she wanted to emigrate\nso much, and that why she was so nervous. And Veronica told me even that she wanted to\ncommit suicide in 1939, but she persuaded her not to leave the children. And she committed\nsuicide.",
        "A: Yeah, in 1943, when the Germans took her. She told me the Germans will not take me alive.\nThey can take me only a dead body, and that what she did.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, it was not like tha -- bef -- before we went to ghetto it was no stars, but 1t was very\ndangerous to walk the street, especially the men. Even the Poles didn\u2019t walk a lot, it was only the\nmilitary men and Lithuanian.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember. Probably we read. It\u2019s a good question, you know. It was like\na -- a prison, but at home. Of course my, the -- the Julia used to go out and to buy some food. It\nwas a shortage o-on food already. I don\u2019t remember her -- doing something, you know, what my\nbrother did. And of course we had neighbors. We rented one apartment. It was one house with a\nlot of rooms, but after my grandparents came home, back to Wilna, after the revolution started in\nRussia. So when they -- they died, this -- in -- in Wilna, so my mother rented a part of the house.\nIt was a Polish family there, and my mother was helping them a lot. When the Lithuanian came,\nthey fired all the Poles from the [indecipherable] positions. And he was working for the railroad,\nso he was fired also because he didn\u2019t know Lithuanian, the language, so they fired him. So they\ncouldn\u2019t pay for rent, and they couldn\u2019t -- and they didn\u2019t have money and my mother told them\nthey can stay as long as they want, she will not ask them for rent. Ah, so, but when the war\nstarted with the Germans so, and suddenly somebody told that the Germans are going from hou -\n- home to home looking for Jewish men. So she asks them to hide my father and my brother and\nthey refused. Yeah, but -- but we -- we were not sure why they refused, maybe they were afraid\nof theirsel -- themself being o-of the Germans also, yeah. But the Germans didn\u2019t come to our\nhouse, and it was see, then on September, first of September then, they told all the Jewish people\nto go to get -- to the ghetto. And they already know the Germans, but the Lithuanian police went\nfrom home to home for -- ho -- one Jewish house, another Jewish house, to take the Jewish\npeople out of the houses.",
        "A: It was a -- an -- the -- it was June.",
        "A: June, yeah. The war started the 22\"! of June, 1941. June, I think, not July yet, June.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, July, for about --",
        "A: -- mid July until the first of September, this --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t know, because it happened, I think, overnight.",
        "A: They decided which part of the streets we -- will belong to the ghetto. It was a Jewish district,\nso not a lot of non-Jews lived there, so they asked the non-Jews to -- to find another -- other\napartments and the Jews they took to th -- to the prison, and then to Ponary and they killed them.\nAnd so they emptied a whole district, so they could take the -- from the other districts of the city\nand bring it to -- to the streets who -- which belonged to th -- to the ghetto already. But maybe\nrumors ki -- were going, of course around that it will be a ghetto organized, because people knew\nthat they organized the ghetto in other cities probably. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t remember. I know\nonly that we knew that some would -- prominent Jews were arrested and killed. Some Jewish\nmen were taken from apartments and from the streets. We knew that the -- the Lithuanian were\nhelping them, and the Lithuanian police, they organized Lithuanian police, and the fascist\n[indecipherable] of Lithuania of course was [indecipherable]. And th-the Poles were -- behaved\nvery quietly, they were afraid for themself. And you have to remember that the Germans were\nenemies of the Polish people, because they conquered their country, they were destroying their\ncountry, and they killed a lot of Poles over. So it was like -- a little bit it\u2019s your enemies and our\nenemies are the same, so it was like that. Had to say, oh, like a moral support from the side of the\nPoles. Not all of them, was a part of them were very happy to see it, and participated in it,\nparticipated in it, but a lot of them were -- hated the Germans and --",
        "A: I think so, yeah, because perba -- probably rumors were already around the city that the ghetto\nwill be organized, and when they started to see how they are throwing out the people, the Jewish\npeople from the houses, so my mother started to pack. But it\u2019s interesting we were in the last\none, because Germans didn\u2019t know that our house is Jewish. We didn\u2019t look like -- the look was\nlike -- I don\u2019t know, something. And th -- and y -- every house had a -- such a -- a -- how to call\nit? A sign, which -- the names of all the tenants. So our name, last name, is a German name,\nShreyber. A lot of Germans have Shreyber. It -- in German, this is a writer. And my father\u2019s\nname in Polish was not Matthias, but 1t was Mateush, and my mother names -- my mother\u2019s\nname is Valentina. And my was -- and my brother\u2019s is Jusef in Polish, yeah. And my, Sulamita,\nthe only -- the only Hebrew name, but it\u2019s such an -- it was not a popular name, so they didn\u2019t\nknow what name 1s it. And then the go -- went to the tenants, the Polish, Latinsky, Latinska and\nso on. So they -- we saw them coming in to our yard and reading the sign and [indecipherable].\nSo I\u2019m coming in again, somebody else, reading, and [indecipherable]. So we were very nervous,\nwhat -- we didn\u2019t know what to do. And -- but somebody told them, yeah, yeah, go, there are\nJews there. So I remember they knocked at the door, Lithuanian policemen, and my mother\nopened the door, and they saw my mother and said, oh, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s a mistake. So she told no,\nit\u2019s not a mistake, we are Jews. So he came in, and he asked for the pas -- passports, for the\ndocuments, and he started to write name. Then he looked out -- around -- my father looked -- I\nwill show you the picture. It was an -- a -- a look of a Russian intelligent [indecipherable] you\nknow -- you have to know the Russian intelligent, how they -- they looked, like Chekhov, like,\nyou know. He looked my -- my mother was absolute not Jewish look, and me. So he told, look,\nyou can\u2019t change the nationality in the documents. You don\u2019t have the names, the Jewish names,\nyou don\u2019t have the last name Jewish -- a Jewish one. What are you thinking how -- and it was\nsuch a shock for us. And I remember my father looking at my mother, and -- and she told no, we\nwill go where -- wer -- where our people go, together with them. And we went. Because, you\nknow, even if she allow him, okay, okay, maybe you can help pass -- to change, because it was\nnot so easy to change in passport the name, you change to -- and there\u2019s a nationality, to change\nlike you cannot recognize it, it\u2019s changed, you know? It\u2019s very difficult, we didn\u2019t know who can\nread, and then the neighbors would say, look why didn\u2019t you take them, what 1s it with you?\nThey are Jews. So we decided to go with [indecipherable] we went, we took some -- yeah, we\ntook some belongings with me -- with us.",
        "A: No, absolutely not. We took our belongings and the only thing my mother told Julia, Julia,\nthis big bedroom where the children were, and the small room and the bathroom will belong to\nyou. I don\u2019t know if they leave you the other rooms, yeah? And she wrote on the door her name,\nJulia -- her maiden name was German, I don\u2019t remember. And she wrote al -- under that,\nvolkesdeutsche. The Germans who were not in Germany, [indecipherable] but they were all in\nPoland, in Lithuania -- they lived in Poland or Lithuania, they named them not Germans, but\nvolkesdeutsche. It\u2019s deutsche is German, but volkes, it\u2019s --",
        "A: -- people, people -- German people, yeah. And she brought to the room as much belonging as\nshe could, then she saw that it\u2019s too much, somebody can say what -- what is it. So she brought\nto the neighbors a part of the belongings.",
        "A: No -- yeah. She di -- y-you know, they couldn\u2019t recognize already that they are not friendly to\nus, because to hide a Jew was very -- very, very dangerous. So how can you accuse a person who\ndi -- doesn\u2019t want to risk their own life? You cannot make such a big a -- you know, a-a-\naccusation immediately. So she didn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t understand it, she ment -- she said, oh yeah,\nshe was afraid, but yeah, and that\u2019s it, then we went to ghetto -- to the ghetto, and started a new\nlife.",

        "A: Yeah, the papers we took always, yeah. The papers we took, yeah. And I don\u2019t know when\nwas it, but probably a day or two before, Veronica came to our house, and my mother gave her\nthe jewelry. She didn\u2019t take the jewelry there.",

And he escaped when\neverybody was taken to Ponary, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember how. He was living there and he\ngave us aroom.

My aunt -- my father\u2019s sister and her daughter had a -- along the\nwindow, such a wooden -- a -- a piece of wood, and she put a -- put something to -- to make it\nsofter, sometime, and she slept there with her daughter. Another small bed, I think, was along\nanother wall, and the engineer, the other engineer\u2019s daughter with her husband slept. And I and\nRachel, he slept also in one -- it\u2019s -- was not a bed, but it just was a -- I -- I have to have a\ndictionary.

It was put -- they put it on the side during the day and they -- we put it in\nbun -- in bunches during the night and he slept up --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s called [indecipherable]",

        "A: It was one bathroom. We had one, two, three, four rooms, full with -- with people, and one\nbathroom in the corridor, and -- and -- and the washroom was separately, yeah, not hot water, but\ncold water. My mother had a shower every day, cold water, in summer and in winter. She was\nused to it. I was afraid to do it.",
        "A: I didn't talk to my parents. I don\u2019t know, I -- I don\u2019t remember. I-I probably more listened\nthan I talked. And nobody would listen to me. I was a child, a teenager, yeah. It was sad, and\nthen people started to disappear, to disappear. And rumors went around that people are taking to\nthe -- to prison and then from the prison to Ponary and killed. And then became the big action in\nYom Kippur, the Jewish holiday, [indecipherable] everybody. They took from the apartment,\nthat\u2019s what I remember. Rachel remembers something a little bit different, but I remember it that\nour family was taken from our room, and everybody had to go to the gate, to main -- to the main\nga -- gate of ghetto, because other gates were -- other streets were closed, yeah. They build like\nwalls, and that it was a main gate and another gate was for the head of the -- of the ghetto,\nspecial gate, a small gate, but he had the keys, and he could open and walk out, but he couldn\u2019t.\nSo everybody was gathered in front of the main gate. So the Lithuanian police went through the\napartments and together with the Jewish police, and asked everybody to go out to the ghetto, to\npeople in the front of the -- of the gate, and then they went to search every apartment if\nsomebody was left there. And then I started to scream. What are we waiting? Are we waiting so\nquietly to be shot? And I screamed and talked to my parents and talked, and a man was standing\nbehind and told my father, \u201cQuiet down your daughter, otherwise I will quiet her down. What\nshe\u2019s talking about? Nobody will kill us, they are checking our documents.\u201d That was the -- they\nalways lied to -- to quiet the people down so the -- we are checking your papers, so you have to\nline up and we will check your papers. I didn\u2019t believe it. So my father told me I will give you a -\n- my watch as a good [indecipherable] watch -- Pll give you the watch, and give it to the\nLithuanian, and -- because they -- they was taking some money, and -- give it to the Lithuanian,\nhe will let you go. Professor, what are you talking about? I will give to one Lithuanian, he will\nlet me go, the other one will cu -- catch me, there is four. And I ha [indecipherable] was how\ncould you stand her quietly and your -- go to -- to the grave? What are you -- so my mother\ncouldn\u2019t listen to it any more, and she went to the German who was the leader of the whole\nentertainment, yeah? Yeah. We will call like that, the death dance. And she started to talk to him\nin German, of course. He was shocked. He told her -- he asked her, \u201cWhat? Where are you from?\nYour German is so perfect.\u201d I\u2019m from Berlin. I am also from ber -- from Berlin. Where is your\nfamily. [indecipherable] here. So, get out of here. And he came over with my mother and he told\n-- told [indecipherable] this is my daughter, my [indecipherable] and he -- he told us to stand on\nthe side, yeah. So we stand here, and he was standing, father, and then a Lithuanian came over\nand started to slap us back to there. So he told no, don\u2019t touch them. So people saw that we are\nstanding there, so people started to run behind us, so our family was growing and we were\nstanding in the front and behind us some other people, some other people. And then they opened\nthe gate and all the people went -- left. We was -- we were already in the ghetto, standing in the\nghetto and waiting for the -- for [indecipherable] yeah. And then he told, the action is finished,\ngoodbye, and he left, and he went back. And then the -- so the Jewish police knew it, where other\npeople are -- are going. They told, oh, you save your life, you save your life. And then we heard\nthat everybody was taken to the prison, to Lukeeshki, and from the pris -- prison to Ponary and\neverybody was killed. It was thousands and thousands of people. I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t\nremember the number, but it was a lot. Maybe eight thousand, maybe 10 thousand. And then\nsome run away, people wounded from the, you know, graves, came to ghetto, smelling with dead\npeople already. Well, we knew already. And I told my mother, that\u2019s it, I am not more going\ntogether with you and waiting until they will shot me. [indecipherable] shoot me, they will kill\nme. [indecipherable] to run. Every time it was a rumor, every time that we heard that it will be an\naction, it will be something in ghetto. So every time I heard it in the morning, I was putting my\nstar of -- the David star, yeah in -- on the front only, I didn\u2019t have it on -- on my back, and it was\nnot, you know, I -- it was with a needle --",
        "A: -- with a pin, yeah. And I went together with these people who went to work, who left the\nghetto to work, people were working for the Germans, doing some job.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay. She was happy that -- so -- and then it was a problem. Her -- we were working -- the\nJewish people who worked the brig -- with the brigades, yeah, they were walking through the\nstreets, but not on the sidewalks, but in -- on the road. So it was one risk to take out the -- my\nstar, yellow star, to go to the sidewalk and to disappear. Not to take it. And I run though the --\nthrough the town, to the city, to Veronica. And I stayed with her a couple of months.",
        "A: She was happy. But she was very poor, and she had only one room. And they -- her neighbors\nliked to -- to talk to her, to come in and to have a chat, you know, they saw me. I couldn\u2019t hide\nmyself, was one room. So she told everybody, oh my relative from -- from a village came to live.\nOkay. They knew, but they pretend that they don\u2019t know. And we used to walk with her. I used\nto go with her to a priest. Once we went and she -- she gave him an -- a golden ruble what my --\nmy mother had when that hor -- the times of [indecipherable] there were golden rubles\n[indecipherable] like that. So she gave it to him and he gave us some bread, and a piece of\nmargarine, I think. And as everybo --",
        "A: Yeah. And he took the money and he gave us bread, and some margarine, and he came back,\nand tomorrow, for tomorrow she went -- I -- I don\u2019t know, maybe I went together with her, and I\n-- and we gave it to my brother who worked also outside the ghetto, and he used to bring it in the\nghetto.",
        "A: Oh, she knew where he worked --",
        "A: -- yeah, it\u2019s not the first time she went to him to give him food.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That was -- and the -- the neighbors were friendly, except one, and this one started to talk that\nVeronica is hiding a Jew. And then another neighbor came to us and told her, Veronica, you have\nto do something, because she told, that the rumors are going like that, that you are hiding a\nJewish girl. So her mother, she had a -- she has a mo -- had a mother, a old mother, yeah, she\nwas also not very young, but so sh -- her mother started to cry, let me die in my bed, I don\u2019t want\nto be hanged by Germans -- by Lithuanian. If they would find me, they would kill both of them.\nWas no question about it. She cried [indecipherable] because didn\u2019t know what to do. So I\ndecided to go back. And I remember our way back, she took me, and we went back. Was in the\nevening. She cried the whole w-way back. She told me if I can -- if I risk with my own life, it\u2019s\nokay, but I don\u2019t want to risk with my mother\u2019s life. And I -- I understood it. That\u2019s it, it\u2019s too\ndan -- dangerous. When I came back my mother was very unhappy that it was all the actions\nwith the [indecipherable] the yellow, with the pink and [indecipherable] were over\n[indecipherable]. And it was a small period of time that it was qu -- almost quiet, yeah. Some\npeople were killed because they took some bread to get, or some people were killed because they\nwere caught stealing something and so on, but not such a action how thousands of people were\nkilled.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Ah, 15 -- or 15 I was already in fo -- 1943, so -- and I started to work in 1942 probably, when\nI was 14. But you know, because I was in and out of the ghetto, I didn\u2019t have like a -- a real\nserious wor -- job. But I don\u2019t know who took me to Polish bricks. I -- they have to be polished, I\ndon\u2019t know. So it was such a machine. It was red, not -- they were not very st -- very straight so I\nhad to polish them. My mother was very upset about it because it were a dust which goes -- went\nto my lungs, and she was always afraid -- afraid of my lungs, because my aunt, her sister -- my\nmother\u2019s sister, died of tuberculosis.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, polishing them.",
        "A: Yeah.",

And\nthen the evening I belonged to -- to a -- a youth club. You know, we tried to make the life more\nor less normal, you know? As normal as could be. As close to normal as it could be. So we had a\nclub, and we had poets and writers, who taught us literature, Jewish literature, and we were\nperforming there, and I won even a -- a prize for a poem what I was reciting, yeah. Yeah -- re --",
        "A: Yeah, a poem.",
        "A: It was a poem of -- an -- an old Yiddish p-poet, Ihoyash, that was his name. He is a famous\nYiddish poet -- Jewish poet, actually, not Yiddish. But he wrote in Yiddish. That -- and we were\n-- it was like a close family, and the -- in the club, so I was so involved in performing something,\nand -- so it was -- but it was a very short time, a short time what I told you, I don\u2019t know, three,\nfour months that we were -- we had the life without the big, big action, without the killing\nthousands of people. People were dying of starvation, of course, and -- and illnesses. People\nwere taken for that, or for another so-called crime. If you see as -- you are very hungry and you\nsteal a piece of bread, you were shot, you know. But like the actions, which were before, like the\nactions with the yellow shines, with the pink shines, what -- thousands of people were killed. So\nit was a short period, I think the end of \u201942, or the beginning of the \u00b043, that it was -- I don\u2019t\nremember the date exactly, but 1t was more or less quiet. And we had even a school for students -\n- everything was illegal, of course. The school was like we used to come and the teachers taught\nus history, and literature, and mathematics. And I remember my father as a mathematic. He used\nto -- he wanted to teach me mathematics, so he explained to me something, and I didn't listen\neven to him. He asked me to repeat and I told him, I don\u2019t know. So he thought, you are not\nlistening to me. So I told him, do you want me to -- to die a educated person? I don\u2019t care. Well,\nhe stopped. Then the teacher of French language, yeah, I had a private less -- private lessons of\nFrench before the war. So she was a neighbor of ours in the ghetto, so my mother used to ask me,\ngo to Eda Danielovna, go to her, she is so lonely, she already lost her husband and her daughter,\nshe is alone, go and talk to her French. Well, I thought, what ha -- why -- what do you want from\nme? I can be killed without French. And I remember that only once I came to her and we talked,\nand now I don\u2019t know French. Now I kne -- I have to know French, but I don\u2019t know now. That -\n- my mother was clever that she wanted me to -- to, you know, not to forget the language, the\nFrench language, and --",
        "A: Nothing. They kept quiet. What could they tell? They never told me, you will survive,\nbecause they didn\u2019t know. Maybe my mother had, but I told you the dream, so she was hopeful --\nshe hopes that I will survive, but the life was -- it was so difficult to survive that -- I know that\nmy father closed the book and never came to me again. So, and the lessons at school were very --\nyou know, it was very upsetting because every day we used to see, oh another teacher is gone,\nyeah. Oh, he died. Oh, this one was caught carrying a piece of bread and was taken to the prison.\nOh, this -- you know, every day, so it was so -- you know, upsetting that then we closed the\nschool at all. Let\u2019s see, they forgot to tell you about a m -- the last days of the -- the last days of\nthe peace before the 90 -- the ra -- the war started in 1941 -- in 1941. So it was days very -- very\n-- not quiet days, because the KGB were already -- start already to work very energetic in\nLithuania. Before they were -- they kept a little bit quiet, they let us leave normally, yeah. Then,\nprobably they felt already that it will be a war between Russia and Germany, so they started to\ntake people out to Siberia, that -- the people who they thought were enemies of Soviet Union.\nWho were the enemies of the sov -- of Soviet Union? Of course, some parties, alexa -- Zionist\nparties, Zionist parties and BUND, and -- and rich people. So but Wilna was a poor city at all,\nand they didn\u2019t -- in Wilna didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t have rich people, very rich people, I mean. So,\nbut in -- the Bolsheviks thought that everybody who has a small store was selling some\nnewspapers and some pencils and some salt and sugar, everything in one room, is rich. So they\nused to take the people out of their homes and to take them to the railway station and to take\nthem to Siberia. Also peasants, Lithuanian peasants who had more than one cow, or one -- was\nalready like a kulak in -- in Russia. A rich peasant who is exploiting others, you know, so -- and\nmy mother was dreaming to run away from Wilna. So she was standing on the street in front of\nour house, and asking them when they -- you know, they are -- the kb -- KGB was -- had the list\nof names and was taking one -- from one house a family, from another one. Come to us, please,\nwe will -- we are rich, we are ri -- do you see, we have a house -- the house didn\u2019t belong already\nto us, but she told like that -- and a house, and na na na, and then come right in. We had normal\nfurniture, fi -- nice furniture. We -- we are rich, take us, take us to Siberia. And people thought\nthat she is crazy, what is it? I remember somebody asked me, is your mother crazy? And I, no.\nSo why she is asking them to take you to Siberia? Because it\u2019s better than to take over the ger --\nthe Germans will take over us, yeah. And she was right. Mostly. Of course, not everybody\nsurvived in Siberia also, of course not. I s -- it was a very hard time, it was a very hard time to\nRussia at all, and it was a hard time to people in Siberia. But mostly they survived, and they\ncame back.",
        "A: She tried very hard to -- to get out of the country, yeah, of Lithuania and the city of --\ncouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s it. Yeah, that\u2019s what I missed these days. Then the war started, so you know\nalready that we are on our way too late, and we were caught, and we came back, and we came to\nthe ghetto, yeah.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s -- as I told you, when it was Yom Kippur, the Jewish holiday, when they took\nall the people, that what I survived, this action. The others actions I was not there in ghetto.",
        "A: I knew only that then it was a yel -- the action of the yellow -- yellow -- documents of the\nyellow shine [indecipherable]. So I was with Veronica, and we knew that something is going on\nin ghetto. And now of course I was very upset, and I didn't know what happened with my family.\nSo she told me, come, we will go th -- to this -- to the -- in the direction of the ghetto, maybe we\nwill learn something. And we went and we met a Jewish family, walking like that in the streets.\nSo we stopped them and started to talk to them, what\u2019s going on? So they told me -- they told us\nthat it was the action of yellow documents, of yellow shines, and we have the -- the yellow\nshines, so we were allowed to go and to go to our job where he was working. He was working\nfor Germans, I don\u2019t know which organization, so he took his family and he went there. So I\ndidn\u2019t know if my father had it, and I was so upset and we went farther, and we stayed -- I don\u2019t\nknow which street we -- we were stopped by a crowd with -- the crowd was looking how they --\nthe Jews were going through the road to Ponary. And I was looking together, and I thought, my\nGod, why is there -- why is they are walking so quietly? Why is they not doing something, you\nknow? And I looked if my father or my mother -- my family is there. Couldn\u2019t see it. But\nsuddenly I saw a woman carried a small child, and shud -- suddenly the Lithuanian were not so\nclose, the soldiers who took them, she throw the child to the crowd, and somebody took the child\nand disappeared immediately. Understand? She throw to the crowd, to the Aryan crowd who\nwere standing, and probably a -- a -- a woman took the child and run away. But of course she\nwas afraid that somebody will stop her for taking, but nobody stopped her. She run away, she --\nimmediately she was gone. So the woman saved her child. It was horrible. I don\u2019t remem -- then,\nwe went with her to that place where my son was working because my father was working in the\nghetto. And my --",
        "A: My father, and my brother worked out of the ghetto, so we -- we went to he -- to see him.",
        "A: My -- my brother.",
        "A: And he -- I -- we -- we met him and he told that yeah, the family is okay.",
        "A: The family is okay. So, the family -- my father took Rachel as a daughter inste -- you know,\ninstead of me, because I was not there. And my brother took my cousin, my -- my father\u2019s\nsister\u2019s daughter, as a wife.",
        "A: D-Dina, yes. Dina Abramovich, yeah, who wer -- who is 90 now and works for the\n[indecipherable] yeah. You know, because it was who had the yellow document, could take with\n-- with them, a wife, and two children less than 16 years. So Rachel was already approaching 20,\nbut she looked so young. Everybody looked so thin, that you couldn\u2019t understand she is 20 or 16\nor fi -- 16 or 15, you know? So it was okay, and he took her, my cousin, she was much older than\nhe, but it went smooth, that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Nobody checked the paper then. They checked the papers when the actions were, you know,\nbut nobody checked the papers. Look, people are dying and running away and kill -- people were\nkilled every minute. So who knows -- who knew? Where is my daughter and where is my\nbrother? Where is my father? Nobody checked it. And my father organized in the ghetto a small\nschool for -- like a technical school. And some use -- some young boys were attending the\nschool, and making some, you know -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know even what they produced. But I\nknow one thing, that the -- the underground was working already in ghetto and my -- my brother\nwas among them, who was stealing weapons from the Germans and was bringing to the ghetto.\nAnd I know that the young people who are working in the school, the technical school were\nrepairing guns, making something like grenades, like to -- to -- you know --",

Like, the gate\nwas closed, locked always, yeah. Only when people were going out to work or coming in from\nwork. So they made keys to -- to ca -- to be able to walk out at night, to the partisan, to the\nwoods, you know? And it was not from the gate, from the main gate, but 1t was another gate, a\nsmall one, what I told you for the -- the leader of the ghetto, who would walk out. He had a\npersonal gate, a personal key, and he could walk out with a key -- through the small gate. His\nname was Genz.",

So he had his key, and so then the\npartisans used it, and probably Genz knew about it, I think. So it was very, very difficult to hide,\nand he knew about the -- that the party -- the underground party existed, yeah, and the\n[indecipherable] was named.",
        "A: Yeah, you know, I was a part of it, but I was small -- no, y -- I was too young, and we were\nonly like some, you know, listen to some news from Russia, what\u2019s going on in the front, how\nthe Germans are already retreating, and to encourage people that soon, soon, soon, that will be\nthe end of the war, and th -- you know, so we were listening to the news, writing down and then\ngiving it to read for people, and so this was not exactly a big job, and --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we did. And -- and we, of course, I hope that they will take me to the partisans,\ncause I -- [ -- I didn\u2019t look like a Jewish girl and I could go to the fr -- from the forest to the city\nand back. I had such -- we had to have a connection, so somebody had to come to the city and go\nback to -- to the forest, so -- but they decided that I am too young, and they left me behind, me\nand Rachel, also.",
        "A: The organizers of the -- of the -- of the underground organization.",
        "A: My brother was involved in the -- of course, yes, he used to steal and bring weapons. But he\nwas caught before -- before the liquidation of the ghetto. He was caught in the action of men, and\nit was -- they were -- before they liquidated the ghetto, they were catching only men, so he was\ncaught and transferred to the -- the concentration camp in Estonia, in Klooga.",
        "A: It was a day when the organization mobilized all the members, and decided to -- to fight the\nGermans, decided to resist, it\u2019s enough, you have to resist. And we were mobilized on one street\nin a -- in a big, big yard of the -- of the house where the partisans probably had the weapons, I\ndon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know exactly because we -- we were not -- I was not told where and what\nthey have. One group of the underground fighters were sent to another house, and they had to\nstart to fight the Germans, who were entering -- the Germans and the Lithuanians who were\nentering the -- the ghetto. And another group of only boys and my -- they include my brother\nwere sent to another street, and -- but they went without weapons and they were told that the\nweapons were being delivered. And they were not delivered and the Germans surrounded them\nand they took them, all of them, the whole group. And the -- the people who were in fron -- in\nthe front house, saw it was foolish, they were told that it will be a parole when they start to shout\n-- to shoot the Germans, so it was a parole fire. But fire is in German also. You know what fire?\nFire is a fire, you know? It -- so it\u2019s -- and the Germans walked through the streets and somebody\nasked for a cigarette probably, give me the fire or something. They had fire, they started to\n[indecipherable]. And they did -- and the Germans, they -- around to the -- the base, to the f -- to\nthe house, that the people from the house couldn\u2019t see them, yeah. And they put a bomb there\nand they run away and the whole house was exploded and all the people were -- were -- died, of\ncourse. Were killed.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And I was in another -- well, in the sam -- the same street, but oh, maybe three or four houses\nfrom there, yeah.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see it, but I heard it, of course. And then -- then the organization, the head of the\norganization decided there is no reason to fight. We have to leave ge -- the ghetto to go -- you\nhave to rent to -- to go to the partisans and to fight the -- the Germans from the woods. But was it\na right decision? But the decision has to be done much earlier. And to take much more people to\nthe partisans because we were so afraid that the Germans can learn about the organization, that it\nwas very, very -- it was a conspiracy, very, very underground, and nobody knew it except the\nmembers of the organization. But we could involve more -- more young people. And the other\ntha -- thing is, they took only -- to the woods they took only people who had a pistol, or a -- a\ngun, or something like that. Who had no weapons they didn\u2019t want it. So we didn't -- I had --\ndidn\u2019t have it, and -- and Rachel didn\u2019t have it, so we were la -- left behind, and that what 1s it.",
        "A: Joseph was so capable that he send us a -- a small letter that the man who -- the machinist of\nthe train, the man who was -- how you say? You know, somebody has to sit there, and to --",
        "A: Conductor, yeah, but it\u2019s not like a conduc -- okay, the conductor was a young Polish guy,\nand my brother wrote a note that I am taking to a concentration camp to Estonia, and please save\nRachel. He was so thinking about her, that that was his -- yeah. And the guy, I don\u2019t know how, I\ndon\u2019t remember how, he brought a letter to the ghetto -- oh he, or somebody else brought it, but\nwe -- we had it, and we knew that they were there. And my father told me that you cannot run\naway without Rachel, because my son asked me to save Rachel. Okay. So, when it was the\nliquidation of the ghetto, on the 23\u2122 of September, 1943, so we were -- the ghetto was\nsurrounded already by Lithuanian police, and -- and I think even with po -- no, the -- I think\nmostly Ukrainian police, because the Lithuanian police, the Lithuanian SS actually knew already\nthat the Russians are coming, and they run to the forest with another group of partisans, what\nthey claim now that they were the patriots. Okay, maybe, but I don\u2019t know which patriot they\nwere, but -- so they run to the forest to fight the Russians, of course, because they wanted to help\nthe Germans, but the Germans wanted to mobilize them to go to the army and to fight the\nRussian [indecipherable]. They didn\u2019t want it, so they didn\u2019t obey the Germans, but they wanted\nto fight Russians, so they run to the forests. And of course they were afraid that if some Jews\nwere alive, so they were going to tell that -- what -- what was going on there. So I think that the -\n- the liquidation of the g-ghetto in Wilna was by a Ukrainian SS division, made by Ukrainians,\nbecause I remember standing with Rachel in line already, hearing them talking Russian. Russian,\nor Ukrainian, it\u2019s very similar, you know, you can recognize, you can understand. And we --\nwhen we understood that we cannot go out together with the organization, underground\norganization, cannot leave the ghetto, we started to look for a exit, how to run. We met some\nother girls. We were sitting a couple of hours 1n a -- you know, the places where the -- the water\nis running from the toilets.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: In such a -- yeah. So we s-sat there until 1t was dark, then we went out, and --",
        "A: Yeah, hiding, but for several hours, we didn\u2019t want to hide it for -- forever, we couldn\u2019t. It\nwas like sitting like that, and it was not -- not only comfortable, but was impossible to sit long\nthere. And -- and it was in ghetto, at -- you know, and we wanted to go out. So we walked out,\nthe ghetto was -- looked terrible. There are no people already in the ghetto. It was dark already,\nwith the -- the windows were open, the doors were open, the belongings were in the streets, you\nknow. The pillows were torn apart, all the feathers. Like, I see the -- the picture like today, you\nknow, like it was yesterday. And n-near us was a library, a big library, a [indecipherable] library.\nSo the books were out in the streets, torn and -- you know. And we looked for people, you know,\nso we met three o-other girls, so we were five of us. And we decided to go to climb the stairs\nupstairs in a building. And I know -- I don\u2019t know how we knew that the building has a hole in\nthe roof, and we can go out to -- onto the roof, and from the roof we can jump to another\nbuilding which doesn\u2019t belong already to the ghetto. So 1t was dark, and we couldn\u2019t see well,\nbut we saw the hole in the roof, and one of the girls climbed the ladder, and she was the first who\nlooked out, and she was caught. So, a soldier was [indecipherable] there and watching. She was\ncaught, and she shouted so loudly that we ran back. I remember not finding the way out of there.\nYou know, the building, 1t was dark, where are the stairs, where are -- where is [indecipherable]\nrun back. And then -- then we s -- we saw no way out. And we went to the building of the\nJudenrat, I mean like the government of the ghetto [indecipherable]. And we found this Jewish\npolice and the government [indecipherable] and some people were there. And we -- we came to\nthem. So the next day, we were taken together with the poli -- Jewish police and everybody.\nTaken to the same place where the old people were taken already [indecipherable] and old, old\ncemetery, what Rachel told you, called Rosa, and -- and then I wa -- I met my mother. She --\nwhen she saw me she was surprised, and so upset, and I couldn\u2019t describe you the -- you know, I\ncan\u2019t describe you the -- her face. She was so sure that Ill run away. She was so sure that I will\nsurvive, you know? And that was her only hope. And then they started to let out the people one\nby one, and to select them, one to the right, one to the left, one to the right, one to the left. And\nwe saw that to the left, they are pushing the old people and children, and handicaps. It -- it means\nthey are sending them to death, that we know already. To the right, only young people. And I\nremember that when I -- I think Rachel wer -- we walked out the first and she was sent to the\nright. I was the next and my mother was behind me. And he ask me -- like I was 15 years old,\nmaybe I w-was tall, and he thought maybe I am older, but he ask me, \u201cAre you alone?\u201d I told no,\nno. So he -- he want to push me to the left, and I told, \u201cYes, I am alone.\u201d And he pushed me to\nthe right. And my mother, he didn\u2019t push her, she went immediately to the left. And I stopped\nher, cried, \u201cMa, Ma.\u201d She -- she didn't look at me. That was the last time I saw her. She told us\nthat she went together with -- with my father. They walked out of the ghetto together, but they\nseparated the men from the women, so she didn\u2019t know where my father is. And Rachel\u2019s sister\ndecided go together as a child and with the family, both sisters. They were young, they went\ntogether. And I didn't go with my mother. It was hard fo -- to me, but you know. It was a time\nwhen I ask myself why I didn\u2019t go with my mother, and then I was protecting myself and saying,\noh but my mother was -- would be even more unhappy if she saw me together with her, dying.\nAnd it was only good for the Germans. More Jews are dying, it\u2019s better for them, so why I\nshouldn\u2019t do it? Okay, maybe I\u2019m right, maybe not, but I did it. Th-The moment I didn't think\nabout it, I protected my life. So they gathered all the people from the left side, and they send to\nMajdanek immediately to the gas chambers. They were not even in the concentration camp, not\none day. From the train they took them to the gas chambers immediately. And one person from\nthe whole -- I don\u2019t know how many thousand people were there, because so many thousands\nwere already killed, but I don\u2019t know how many. But one person was run away. And she -- she\nwas a -- a Wi -- a Wife of a engineer who worked with my father. When I came back, she came\nback to Wilna after the work -- after the war, and she learned that I am in hospital right after the\nwar. So she came to me to hospital -- to the hospital, and she told me that your mother was not\nkilled, your mother committed suicide. So I told her I know, because my mother told me, I have\nthe pills, they will not kill me. So she committed suicide in the car already -- in the train, on the\ntrain. She committed suicide and my husband, who was not a husband yet, but the hu -- the\nhusband\u2019s mother -- my husband\u2019s -- 1n the future he was my --",
        "A: Yeah, my future husband\u2019s mother and his aunt. The aunt was -- worked for a pharmacy and\nshe gave them the pills. Three of them together committed suicide. So that was -- that how I\nlearned how my m -- mother died. And we were taken to a train, and when we went to the train, I\nasked Rachel to run. Come, come. I told her, as soon as we are out of the country, and Ill not\nknow another language, I\u2019Il not run away. I know the language here, I can communicate with the\npeople, I can run. She was not used to run. It was a -- it was a -- really not so easy to decide it.\nShe told me, we will maybe meet my -- my brother in the concentration camp, she couldn\u2019t. And\none --",
        "A: Yeah, Joseph. And one of our girls told wi -- and wa -- that one woman Hiah Shapiro\n[indecipherable] she is now in Israel, she told us, girls, \u2019m running. And she immediately took\nfrom -- from our row to the sidewalk, to a house. I didn\u2019t know that it was the house where she\nlived, and she disappeared, and she survived. She found a way to the woods. It was not so easy\neverything, it was not, but she was in the partisans, and then she -- she run to the\n[indecipherable] Europe. In 1945 she went to -- through Poland, through Hungary, through Italy,\non -- il -- illegal to Palestine.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t, because I couldn\u2019t run by myself. I had to run with Rachel. That was my father\u2019s\nlast words to me. Don\u2019t run without Rachel. Then many years passed and I thought, how could\nhe tell a child of 15 years such a thing, such a warning? It was a matter of life and death, and\nthat\u2019s it. And we were taken -- we were taken to the train station, to the train and when -- and\nwent to Latvia, to Kaiserwald, then from Kaiserwald to Stutthof. Not to Stutthof, to Strassenhof.\nThere we stayed for the -- more or less a year, and we were working for the [indecipherable |\nmanufacturer. A factory, produced materials for -- for the soldiers, such -- like stuff, I don\u2019t\nknow what they -- what -- they were sewing them, I don\u2019t know from the stuff here -- it\u2019s a web -\n- web machine, yes, web machine, yes? That\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s in English, no? A machine who is --",
        "A: We -- how?",
        "A: Weedy?",
        "A: Weave, yeah.",
        "A: That is, yeah.",
        "A: Web is in German.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yep.",
        "A: First of all, we were, of course, in the wagons, the cars were like for cattles, yeah. We were\nsitting on the floor, close to each other, how many people in one, I don\u2019t know even. Hundred,\n200, I don\u2019t know. Locked the doors, no windows, a small like window, like under the roof. And\nthey were -- you know, we didn't know the direction. We didn\u2019t know where they take -- where\nthey took us. And in a half an hour or an hour was a ride, yeah, suddenly the train stopped. We\nwere sure that it\u2019s Ponary. So they brought us to the place where they shoot the Jews, yeah? So\nwe were waiting and waiting when the door will be opened. I don\u2019t know if they stopped there,\nor in another place. If they stopped it deliberately to make us, you know, so -- it\u2019s like to --\nmorally to -- to f -- to destroy us morally.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh, we were weak -- already weakened. Already. But -- and then the train went on and\nwe suddenly stop -- stopped -- I don\u2019t know how long we went. The whole day, I think, until the\nnext night. I think we went -- we were on the train the whole day, and until in the middle of the\nnight, opened the doors, and we -- we saw big lamps like a -- like that, how it\u2019s called --",
        "A: -- reflector more.",
        "A: Lights, yeah, but has a name. Forgot now. You know, it -- big, big lamp pointing the light in\none direction and you see everything.",
        "A: Oh, it has another -- like -- like you -- somebody is performing on a stage. There are lights\nwho are lighting them -- the stage, yeah? What is it called, the lights? Okay, you understand what\nI mean, yeah?",
        "A: And the lights were centered onto the door -- on the doors of the cars, so we were blind\nabsolutely. We were in the dark the whole time, and suddenly so much light, yeah. And the dogs\nbarking, and we couldn\u2019t see even where we are, and who are around us. There were SS men,\nthese big dogs, you know, how they used to do it. And they were shouting at us, raus, raus,\nfaster, faster, faster. Go, go. And then we were putting in a -- in a row everybody and letting into\na concentration camp. We saw there the gates and we understood that it\u2019s a concentration camp.\nThat\u2019s how we came to the concentration camp. And then for tomorrow, we went out in the\nmorning, we went out to a appelle. I mean --",
        "A: Yeah, we had to -- to show up, everybody has to show up in a -- in -- to stand in a row straight\nlike soldiers, you know? And we were told to -- to give every jewelry we have, or money, or\nwatches, everything what\u2019s valuable to give them immediately. If they find it, is, you know, there\nis one sentence, death, death, death, yeah? So people gave what they had. And they were taking\nsuch a -- like a -- like a ba -- big bag, and everybody was putting something 1n there, gold rings,\nor something what was left. I think Rachel had something from my mother. My mother took with\nher what was left from the jewelry Veronica didn\u2019t sell, something, a brooch, I think, she took\nwith her, and she gave to Rachel something, and Rachel threw it in the toilet. So they were not\nso, you know, excited [indecipherable] the Germans, they took the toilet out, you know, it was\nnot a toilet where you wash the -- with the -- with the water, yeah, the toilet, you flush it. No, it\nwas a toilet like a -- a [indecipherable] where you are --",
        "A: Yeah. And so they took it and they checked it. They fished from there some what do you\nsend, rings or something, and we were laughing at that. It\u2019s a good job for a German soldier.\nThat was it. Then --",
        "A: Yes, of course, of course, yes, yeah. She didn\u2019t tell it, about it? It\u2019s interesting. Well, maybe\nshe doesn\u2019t remember it, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "A: No. Who can -- who can know, who can point her out that she did it?",
        "A: And there were like mountains of sand, so people put it in the sand.",
        "A: Their jewelry. So they took it from the sand. They knew everything. But there are -- there\nwere brave people who took it from other people to save it, and saved it, and nobody searched\nus. They were so sure that we are so afraid that we will not hide it. So -- but I remember that a\nacquaintance of mine, when we came already to another concentration camp she had it. She\nthought I took it. That\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "A: She had some jewelry.",
        "A: Some jewelry, she took it in from other people.",
        "A: She asked. The people gave it to her.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t know. I -- I didn't think to do it, I -- I didn\u2019t -- it was not in my mind to do\nsomething -- some -- such brave things. I son -- I think my bravery I left in Wilna. I was not\nbrave any more. I think so, but maybe. And then we were taken to -- to Strassenhof. It was a\nconcentration camp, but it was more a labor camp, I think, because everybody was working. So it\nwas not so bad. Comparing with ghetto, it was bad. Comparing to the other concentration camp,\nit was not so bad, you know? Bad things are like th -- bad things have stages. Can be bad, be bad,\nit can be more bad, and even more bad. So there was the stages, so we were there, and at once we\nworked for a -- we -- they were building some -- something, a building, a factory, so we worked\nthere. I don\u2019t remember even what we did. Did we dig something, we -- we -- did we take -- use -\n- used to take breaks and bra -- bricks, and --",
        "A: -- and bring it to them? Or we -- I don\u2019t remember exactly what job we did. We helped the\nLatvian people to build it. We were -- we were doing the dirty job for -- you know, the heavy\njob, the dirty job for the builders. And one man who was working there, started to talk to me in\nRussian -- because we didn\u2019t know Latvian, it was a strange country for us. It was in not -- it was\nsimilar to Lithuanian, but we didn't know Lithuanian even very well. We didn\u2019t know. So he\nstarted to talk Russian and we talked to him also, you know. He asked for -- where we are\ncoming from and so on. And he -- one day he brought even food, I think. And one day he told\nme, I'll -- Pll bring you clothes, and you will run away. We were already in the cl -- given the\nclothes of the concentration camp, like stripes, you know? St-Striped clothes, yeah.",
        "A: Uniforms. You can say uniforms, can -- maybe it is uniforms. I -- I think a uniform is a\nuniform, it isn\u2019t -- something isn\u2019t, but here -- okay. But prisoner uniforms, okay, we\u2019ll say like\nthat. And he told me [Il bring you one and I\u2019Il show you how to run away, and I will bring you\nto the partisans. And I came and I don\u2019t know if I told Rachel or I told her later, and I thought\nwhat to do, what to do? Can I trust him, or he will take me immediately to Gestapo, because\nthere were such things. But I -- I -- I think now that I could trust him, because there were things\nthat -- in Lithuania some people were asking for money, and then they were -- you -- o-or they\nwill hide you or take you to a good place.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: Yeah, so -- so we were in Strassenhof, we were for a year, more or less.",
        "A: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, so I -- I was afraid to believe him, and then I was afraid another thing. The thing is that\nif you run away, they will find it out very easily because they counted us every day in the\nmorning, and every day in the evening. They knew exactly the number of the prisoners. So they\nwill shot their closest. It means Rachel would be shor -- shot, that for sure. And sh -- not she --\nnot only she. So I thought no, I cannot do it. That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t remember telling her. I-I think in --\nin -- I didn\u2019t tell her in concentration camp for -- about it. It was out of my mind. And then we\nwere taken to a f -- to the [indecipherable] manufacturer -- to a factory, and we worked there\ntogether with the Latvian people. The Latvian woman taught us how to manage the machines,\nand she almost left it for us. We were already doing it. We\u2019re happy that we can do such a job,\nbut it was of course, difficult for us, because everybody would -- had to take care of 10 machines\nor something like that. But then we learned from her, we looked how she was stealing the\nmaterial, yeah, and we learned from her. She was not afraid of us.",
        "A: The Latvian woman, so she was stealing, so Rachel told, we can do the same and we can sell\nit, and we can -- I mean sell to get bread for it. And that we were r-risking the life for sure. So\none of us, me, and other times she, was cutting the roll. You have to be very careful how you cut\nthe roll, not to leave the sign. But I think that the people who ah -- were checking --",
        "A: -- checked the -- the [indecipherable] material, you know, the rolls. You are bringing to a\nplace where it was checked, measured probably, knew about that, that the Latvian are doing it.\nAnd they were afraid to tell it, because they probably didn't want to -- to threaten the Latvian\npeople who were working with us. They didn\u2019t think that the Jewish women can dare to do it. I\nbelieve it.",
        "A: I put it like that, behind, and then Rachel run to the toilet, and she was look --",
        "A: -- wrapping it around her waist. We were very thin, that you cannot find it [indecipherable]\nyou didn't look fat after [indecipherable]. Of course it was not a lot, maybe a couple of meters.",
        "A: We work -- you know, because we were in touch with Latvian, some of the prisoners were\nfrom Riga, and they spoke Latvian. So they had a connection with the inner -- ou-out -- the world\noutside the concentration camp. See, they used to take it -- in the concentration camp, they used\nto take it to bring it to the Latvian, and the Latvian gave them a bread, and they used to take\nsome bread for themselves, some bread to us. So that makes us more happier. I mean, we were\nhungry, very hungry, because the food was very -- this was very little food there. Rations were\nvery small. A small piece of bread and a little bit margarine and some soup, like waterish --\nwatery soup, like water with some beans in it or something like. So we were very hungry, so this\nwas a support, a big support.",
        "A: Ah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Every time we received the bread, I told give it my -- give my bread to\nme. She told no, [Pll not give it to you. Give it to me, I\u2019m hungry, give it to me, I want to eat it.\nNo, you will not eat it. Pl give you a piece and that\u2019s it, that\u2019s your breakfast. I am hungry. You\nwill get the other one in the evening. And that save us the life. I don\u2019t know how she knew it, or\nmaybe she learned it from somebody, maybe the instinct, you know, told her to -- to -- not to eat\nit immediately the whole bread and then to be out of food the whole day, what was very bad, of\ncourse.",
        "A: No, it was a -- you know, we were punished for si -- for some things, you -- we used to come\nto the concentration camps so they used to -- we used to stand in lines, they used to count us and\nthen we were punished for something. Somebody did something wrong and we were standing for\nhours, very exhausted, and very tired. And so another time, they thought, oh we had to jump on\none foot around the building, around there. But we were young, and I remember jumping and\nlaughing, you know? We were pushing each other on, and I jumped over to a SS, he was like in a\n-- ina--aSS coat, having a gun. He was like guarding us, yeah. And he was crying. When I saw\nhim crying, I don\u2019t know how I dared, I asked him, what are you crying? So he told, I am not a\nGerman. I am a Romanian. And they -- the Germans lied to me. They told me, would you wa --\nwould you like to go to the front? He was mobilized, yeah, he -- would you -- take into the army,\nI mean. It\u2019s -- how it\u2019s c-called, not mobilized, draft, yeah, 1t was a draft. So he told, won\u2019t you --\nwon\u2019t you -- won\u2019t -- would you like to go to the fr-front line, to the eastern front? No. So you\nwill be an SS. He didn't know what is SS. Okay, I'll be an SS. He was not ver-very young in my\neyes, probably he was 35, so then I was 15, so it was old already for me, you know. So he told\nme -- and I have a daughter like you at home. And I looked at you and I -- and I cannot bear it.\nHe cried. And then I -- in a short time I didn\u2019t see him at all. I don\u2019t know, maybe he left the SS\nand went to the front, I don\u2019t know. I never saw him again. That was one, you know, one person\nwho -- who couldn\u2019t bear the -- who -- looking how we were punished and how we were beaten\nor -- then a group of girls run away, and from the same place where the Russian Latvian guy was\nworking. So they shot every 10\". They were counting when the -- when girls are standing on the\nappelle, they were counting one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, out and th --\nevery 10 -- 10\" people -- person was shot. So we knew we -- we are risking very much. And I\nremember that one lady told, we have to watch each other not to let run away some other --\nsomebody. So I told her, are you crazy? Let run away everybody who can. We will be shot at,\nnot -- not earlier, so it\u2019s later. But let everybody run. If I could, I would ru -- run, but -- but I --\nthat was I refused this time, and I didn\u2019t have another time.",
        "A: You know, we heard already that the army, the Soviet army is coming. We -- we didn\u2019t\nbelieve that they will let us alive.",
        "A: The Germans. We thought they will kill everybody and that\u2019s it. It will be the final solution.\nWe didn\u2019t hear about the final solution there, but we he -- knew exactly what they want to do\nwith us, yeah. That\u2019s it. Maybe I -- I remember that s -- the Soviet army started to bomb Riga.\nAnd the Germans came running to the concentration camp, they\u2019re hiding themself. Oh, we were\nso happy to -- to look at them, how afraid they were of their lives, yeah. I remember opening the\nwindow, telling them come, come to us. We are not -- we are not afraid to die of your bomb, but\ntogether with the Germans. Here we all were making signs to them for -- through the window\nand praying, come, come the bomb to -- to throughout yeah -- to throughout the concentration\ncamp [indecipherable] building. Didn\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t know where they bombed, but they didn\u2019t\nbomb the concentration camp. Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: For a year, then --",
        "A: Then what happened. They shaved our heads, gave something else to wear, I think, other\nuniform, and --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Rachel cut me the hair in the first -- in -- in Kaiserwald, but then I had my hair until I was --\nour concentration camp was evacuated already. So it means they were evacuated, we knew that\nthe Soviet army is coming. So they took us to the -- to a -- to the s-sea, and they -- we were going\naways -- be -- they took us to a -- a ship, and went to -- by the sea, we went to -- to Stutthof.",
        "A: This is another concentration camp, which was not a labor camp any more, it was only\nconcentration camp. And the death rate was very big, of course, very high. And crazy things,\ncrazy things there. Even in -- being in Strassenhof, they made a list of everybody who is younger\nthan 16 and older than 30. And they took all the people older than 30 years and younger than 16.\nSo because of Rachel, I was in -- not 1n the list, because she asked me to write myself older, not\nto be a child. So I write myself not, so then I was probably 16, so I was two years older, so I was\n18, so they didn\u2019t take me. So then I went to Stutthof, it was -- it was horrible, it was -- we went -\n- we were placed in a block, meaning a -- such a shtuba, a house, a wooden house where\ncriminals were in -- the bosses of the -- of -- of the houses, like a Russian criminal was a -- a\nwoman was -- she was the boss of our house, yeah.",
        "A: You can see by her language. The curses, by the way of her behavior, I don\u2019t know, or maybe\nshe was a prostitute maybe, not a criminal, and like that. And one time they told us to load big\nstones on wagons to push them down -- down the hill, then to push them up the hill, to unload\nthem, then to load them again, push down the hill. It\u2019s not so easy to push them hen -- down on\nthe hill there, have to go very slowly, so you have to hold. They were loaded by -- with this --\nwith brick stones, and to push it up the hill also, like that, the -- a whole day, yeah. All that to\nmake you happy. Then, of course, the beatings, and the st -- the illnesses, the starving was, you\nknow, it was over -- we were overwhelmed with dirt, with lice, with -- it was awful. Then one\nday somebody told that they are taking some young people to work for the farmers. So we went\nwith Rachel. There was -- we stayed there probably two or three months. We worked very hard,\nbut at least we were more or less free. We could wash ourself, we washed our clothes, we were\nmore or less clean, you know, and the food was like, you know, the maid of the ba -- of the f-\nfarmer gave us a key of the basement where the potatoes were, and so we had it. But in three\nmonths they took us back -- they took us back, so they took us to a shower. And you never knew,\nif you are taken to a shower, it will be water from there, from the ceiling, or it will be death, who\n-- they\u2019Il kill you. Because they used to do it from the same things, you know, the -- where the\nshowers are, they used to -- to send the gas to the area you are closed, yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but we knew.",
        "A: Yeah. We knew -- we saw the crematorium. The crematorium had smoke 24 hours a day, it\nnever stopped smoking, the smoke was black and smell it [indecipherable] the smell was\nhorrible. So we knew that they are burning people there. We knew it.",
        "A: In Stutthof.",
        "A: Yeah, it was not in Strassenhof, it was in Stutthof, yeah. And every time, every appelle is\nselecting people to the crematorium.",
        "A: Oh, they were going like -- you are standing five people in a row, and you -- the SS men used\nto go and look at you. And I don\u2019t know, I -- I learned one thing, don\u2019t show in your eyes that\nyou are afraid, because if you are afraid, oh, they look at you. Don\u2019t show that you hate the --\nhate them so much that you will kill them, otherwise, he will take you. Look at -- look -- don\u2019t\nlook at them at all. Look through them, you know?",
        "A: Like he would be a glass, and you look through them to -- to some point, I don\u2019t know, and\nlook very indifferently. It\u2019s not very [indecipherable]. Oh, you won\u2019t -- you don\u2019t take me, you\u2019ll\ntake me, maybe it\u2019s even better than -- such a life is better death [indecipherable] no. We are\nnever selected, with Rachel.",
        "A: No, not too much at all. I don\u2019t know how we managed. I don\u2019t know how.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No. Not in the concentration camps, never. We were afraid of it.",
        "A: No. Ju -- were not asked individual -- individually to do something. It\u2019s a group.\n[indecipherable] 10 people [indecipherable] we went together.",
        "A: At night we used to talk how good it was at home. How tasty was the food what I hated and\ndidn\u2019t eat. And I always thought, where is the kasha Mama gave me, and where is the milk I\ndidn\u2019t want to drink? And that\u2019s all, and some such things, and then where are our parents, our\nsisters, and brothers? Are they in a concentration camp like we? Can they survive? And so on.\nYeah, and then we are -- we were [indecipherable] to a -- to a house after being in -- working for\nthe farmers, we are [indecipherable] a house, which was -- there were only sick people. Were no\nbeds, it was -- it were no beds before also, but it were be -- wooden beds, you know, in like --",
        "A: How?",
        "A: Bunks, yeah?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: So -- and here no bed -- no, no beds at all. Everybody was sitting on the floor, and because we\nwere so crowded, so many people were, so we were sitting in a row, like my legs were a little bit\nspread in me, another person in me, like five. And we were sleeping like that, everybody was\nleaning towards the other. And that was the worst. People were dying like -- like, you know,\nflies. I remember I woke up, I was lying -- I was leaning -- leaning a li -- leaning up a -- a -- a\nwoman who was dead already. So, I mean, my head was on the dead corpse already, corpse. And\nevery morning used to come several men who were taking the corpses out of us, of our room,\nyeah. And once I heard that the kapo who was coming and directing the people what to do, from\nwhich line to take the corpses, spoke Polish. So I ask him, look, how is this Red army? Is she\ncoming? How far are they? Because we listen -- we heard already the bombs, the -- you know,\nthe -- the bullets falling, you know. So he told me, what are you doing here? A language is a\nsuch powerful -- powerful thing, you know? It\u2019s such a connection between people who are not\nconnected and maybe not even like each other. But he her -- he didn\u2019t hear Polish very much,\nand suddenly he heard Polish. So he ask me if [indecipherable] I mean miss. Oh, what I didn\u2019t\nhear wa -- for -- you know, for years. What are you doing here? I told him, you don\u2019t know what\nI\u2019m doing here? [indecipherable] do you know that you will die here? Nobody will be alive here.\nGo out of here. How -- how can we go out of here? So he told me, and he said, today will come a\nGerman and take some people to work with the kitchen, with potatoes, to wash it, to prepare\nfood, I don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t be afraid, he underline me, it\u2019s not to the crematorium. Go for -- and --\nand stand up -- stand there in a line and wait until they will take you. And then it was -- one\nGerman or two came, and we went with Rachel and they took us. Took us together again. Went\nto another house where we are having to do these potatoes, you know. Bad, frozen potatoes,\npreparing it for a dinner for the -- for the prisoners. And sleeping already in a room which had\nthe wooden beds, yeah. And then we heard that they are evacuate -- ready to evacuate the whole\nconcentration camp. Who can go, who can work? The others? They will -- they will take -- they\nwill make a fire and everything will be burned, and that what they did. And we were evacuated.\nWe went on that -- we went o-on the Death March, with this --",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t remember if we choose --",
        "A: -- see, I -- I think they didn\u2019t ask us. They didn\u2019t ask us anything, they told us to go, so we\nwent. It was a horrible, of course, we were -- first of all, it was cold, it was the end of February,\nthe beginning of March, it was cold. It was snowing, it was freezing. We were -- we were 1n such\nuniforms, as they gave us such, you know, things to cover us, is a -- like sheets, you know, some\nto cover us. And the lice were all over us, I remember th -- th -- I [indecipherable] everything\nwas -- iS -- 1s moving. They gave us a -- a piece of bread and go. And on the way we saw the\nhorses, together with German families, they were running from the Russians already, so they\nload on the horses everybo -- everything -- on the carts actually, and th-they were running, and\nsometimes Polish people were -- which were taken from Poland to work for the Germans were\nshouting to us, ma -- to encourage us. So --",
        "A: Let -- s-stay alive, stay alive, the Russians are coming. Stay alive, stay alive, the Russians are\ncoming. It\u2019s not far, it\u2019s not far, but you -- you can hear. You can see the red sky from the fire of\nthe front, you know, and the Germans were running. And then they took us to a -- one small\ncamp. We were -- I don\u2019t know, we were there for a week or so. And then they took us from the\nsmall camp to -- again, was a march, yeah, and then they marched in -- we -- we came to a barn,\nyeah. They opened the door and they told us to go. We didn\u2019t know that people are there, and we\nstarted to walk over the people. The screaming was so [indecipherable] we couldn\u2019t -- we -- we\ncouldn\u2019t understand what\u2019s -- and the other rows are pushing us, yeah, and we cannot walk\nbecause we are walking on the bodies of other people, heads, there were legs. But that was the\nlast place. They close the door and we didn\u2019t hear from the Germans any more. The -- they -- we\nwere -- it was night, in the morning we wanted to go out, and we looked, you know, through the\ndoor, and we looked for a -- for a s -- piece of light where -- where -- where we can see what\u2019s\ngoing on there. And we started to knock on the door. And some women were shouting, don\u2019t\nknock, they will shoot us. And we knocked. We knocked, we knocked, nobody was there, so we\nstarted to push the door. And we pushed it open, no Germans. And we saw the road, and over\nthere, the army, the -- the Soviet army is standing. So a group of young girls, and including me\nand Rachel, we run to the soldiers, yeah? We wanted to embrace them. They saw us, they started\nto run away. Because we -- then they told us that we looked so horrible, that they were afraid.\nWhat -- what are they, shadas of pe -- of some corpses, or some dead people, or -- who 1s\nrunning? And we are -- were dirty, of course. And th-then they told us that we -- they were not\nallowed to come over to us because we carried typhus and other illnesses. So 1t would be an\nepidemic, you know, they were afraid of the army. They wanted to protect them. So they run,\nand we run after them. And we came to a village, a German village. And I was sick, I was alr --\nalready absolutely sick. I felt that I -- I -- I was coughing, and I had the high fever. I felt it, I\ndidn\u2019t have a -- a thermometer to -- to measure the fever. And we came over to a German village,\nwe open the one house we wanted to enter. So a family was sitting around the table and telling\nus, raus. So we wacked out -- we walked out. We walked out and I saw a Russian officer going\nthrough, and -- and I knew Russian, so I told him, look, you liberated us, but we don\u2019t have\nwhere to stay. What -- what do you mean where you don\u2019t have where to stay? I told, they are\nnot alone. Oh yeah? He took this, his pistol, opened the door, opened the pistol and told, if you\ndon\u2019t go away from this house, you will be killed. So they left and we occupied the house. I lied\ndown near a stove, which was [indecipherable] was hot. I was so cold, shivering. And Rachel\nwas very active. She took all my clothes off, and put in the stove, yet it was bong, bong, like the\nlice and everything what -- and everybody did it, yes, some other girls came in. Then they took\nwater, they boiled the water and we washed ourself. Then we took some clothes there that was in\nthe house because we couldn\u2019t stay naked, of course, and we couldn\u2019t use the old uniforms\n[indecipherable]. Then came -- we were already cleaner, a little bit, it came to feeding myself. I\nremember Rachel brought a -- a piece of bread. Fresh bread, smelled a -- a -- she gave it to me.\nSo I gave one bite and I told, look at, I am full already, I cannot eat any more. And she told, you\nknow, I don\u2019t know why, but I am full also. So we stopped eating, and other people started to eat\na lot. Then they were dying, you know, why it was something in the stomach and the emergency\nhad no time, the military emergency, to take them to the hospital, they were dying. And we\nsurvived only because we couldn\u2019t eat. We twe -- we -- we didn\u2019t know, we were so young that\nwe didn\u2019t know that you -- when you were starved al-almost to death so many -- for so many\nyears, you can\u2019t eat a lot. You have to start from the beginning, a little bit, a little bit. Then, to\nmake the story short, because it\u2019s so -- so very shor -- big story, we are -- stayed there for a\nmonth, and we are allowed by the Soviet government [indecipherable] the military government\nto -- to go home. So we went to a train, and we went to ho -- Poland. Trains were not passenger\ntrains, trains -- also the soldiers were there, and it was a mixture, a mixture. And seems that the\nwhole population is moving. One 1s going to Germany, the other is going from Germany, and\neverybody is moving. We met Polish people from Wilna who told me that my house is already\nbombed, that I don\u2019t have a house, and it was true. That I learned in Poland on the train. The mid\n-- in the middle of the -- the woods, the train would stop, and the -- the train -- and -- and the\npeople -- some people came from the woods and robbed. Everybody took the b-belongings from\neverybody, because what the other people did, even from Lithuania, from Poland, went together\nwith the Soviet army to Germany, took belongings of -- the German belongings, you know,\njewelry -- what -- what they left behind. And li -- and they brought it back to their country and\nsold it all for theirself, I don\u2019t know. There were already such people, businessmen, yeah, or\nbusinesswomen. So the others knew it, and they -- they were taking the belongings of these\npeople. And we laughed with Rachel because we didn\u2019t have anything, so nobody took from us\nanything. That\u2019s it, and then we came closer to our border already, Lithuanian border, and we\nchanged the trains, of course, and some Soviet officers told us, come girls to us, sit down there to\ntheir [indecipherable] yeah. And the train went to Lithuania, yeah. So she started to ask us from\nwa -- from where we are coming now, and what -- and they saw how they look. So we told them\nthe truth, what it was and -- so one told us, look, you know that on the border of Lithuania and\nPoland, you will be stopped. And because you don\u2019t have papers, no identification papers, no\nnothing, no passports, no in -- identification papers. So we will be taken in a -- in a camp. I told,\nwhat? I am not going in any camp any more, any camp, if 1t was German, or Russians, I don\u2019t\ncare. So he -- so I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m going to die in Wilna. I was sure that I am dying. I was -- felt like\ndying, yeah. So, but I will die in Wilna where I was born. I don\u2019t want to die in Germany of\ncourse, I don\u2019t want to die in Poland. So they told, you know what? We will hide you. And there\nwere some machines inside, what probably the Soviets were taking from the Germans already,\nlike -- like to make x-rays. I saw the [indecipherable] like from some medicine machines or\nsomething like that, I don\u2019t know. I saw it for x-rays. And they hide us over there. And then the -\n- the train stopped, and the people came over, also military people with lamps, lights everything\nlooked around, asked them for papers, the officers gave them the papers. They ask, is there\nanybody else here? No, nobody is here. Oh, okay. So the door was closed, and the train came to\nKovno to Kaunas, not to Wilna. Oh, so that we are free. Good, we are almost home. Kovno from\nWilna is hundred kilometer only. So we walked out, and we were arrested immediately because\nwe -- oh, to look at us, you can see what we -- where we came from. And they asked us for\ndocuments and we don\u2019t have it. So give us a passport, give us something, we don\u2019t have. So we\nstarted to tell them that we were taken fro -- b-by the Germans. Uh-huh, come to KGB. And then\nthey started, we will arrest you, you\u2019re spies, you\u2019re -- everybody was spies, and you\u2019re\nprostitutes, you -- you run to the -- together with the -- with the ger -- German army. Look at us,\nI thought [indecipherable] you will look at us, saw how we look, the hair shaved, and -- but what\nwas -- I don\u2019t know what they would do this as, if not a Jewish guy who was in Kovno already\nsaw how the soldiers took us like that, you know, took us to the -- to the KGB. So they run there,\nwe didn\u2019t know it, and they -- with money. So they gave her money for -- to the officer who took\nus, yeah, to [indecipherable] us, yeah. And he let us go.",
        "A: No.",

And then the man was waiting outside, to-took us to the -- the -- his house, and\nstarted to ask about his family, he didn\u2019t know where his family is, and [indecipherable]. And --\nand he gave us, of course, a shower, and -- and we stayed there two days probably. He was\nlooking for a way how to come from Kovno, how to go from Kovno to Wilna. But it was -- it\nwas hundred kilometers. Now, you can make in a -- in an hour or less, but it was no way to go\nthere, only by train. But train you have to have a ticket, and to buy a ticket you have to have a\npassport. So he found a man, the con --",

And -- and he brought us over to Wilna. And then --\nokay, I was brought to the hospital immediately because I was with tuberculosis, staying at the\nhospital almost two years, in and out.
