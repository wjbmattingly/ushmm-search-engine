        "Q: Ray, can you, uh, tell me your, your full name please?",
        "A: I'm Raymond Stephen Buch, B-U-C-H. It's German.",
        "Q: And where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in New York City, in Manhattan, in the Harlem Hospital.",
        "Q: In what year?",
        "A: In the year 1920, in September 18th.",
        "Q: Um, where did you grow up? Tell me a bit about your family and about your parents.",
        "A: Well, my folks were from, uh, the Ukraine. Uh, my mother came from the Polish side of the\nBug River and and my father was on the Russian side and, uh, they were childhood friends\nand they immigrated to the United States at different times and met in New York and my\nfather was in World War I and, uh, in the infantry which, uh, I was quite proud of as you'll\nfind out later. And, uh, he bought a farm in New Jersey and we shortly moved to New\nJersey, that is the father and mother, and, uh, when my mother was pregnant with me she\nwent to a lying-in hospital which happened to be in New York City because the railroad train\nwent right through our farm, stopped at the house and picked her up and delivered her to\nPennsylvania Station and she took a cab to the hospital.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: There was no such facilities in New Jersey at the time.",
        "Q: Okay. Um, tell me then a little bit...you grew up in New Jersey?",
        "A: Yes. Yeah. Then we went back to the city for a couple of years and I got to be a, uh, street\nbum and, uh, kids learned how to smoke cigarettes and rammed around and got into gang\nfights and the usual. And, uh, at, uh, age ten we moved back to the farm because of the\nDepression and we were on a farm until I was inducted into the Army. I became a carpenter\nbefore I went in the Army, and that's why I was in the engineer... in the engineers. We had,\nuh, uh, I had the background for it, having built factories and movie theaters and different\nstructures, houses, barns and so on in New Jersey before I went in the Army. And in the\nArmy I picked up on that and learned a lot of new things. Learned how to blow up the things\nthat I had built, and which was a terrible thing in my mind--when we had to destroy\nbuildings and bridges and even trees which we blew down occasionally to, uh, to make the\nwar effort a little more, uh, well, not useful but to learn what we had to do in service, in\ncombat. And it stood us in good stead stead because the things we learned were, uh,\nimportant to the Army and nobody else.",
        "Q: Right. Uh, tell me about when you uh, what were the circumstances in which you were taken\noverseas?",
        "A: Well, we went, we [were] inducted in the Army, in the Armed Forces, in 1942, uh, late in\n'42, in November, and we maneuvered in Louisiana and Texas for approximately a year, uh,\na little over a year, and, uh, we, uh, then went to Texas and the plains of dry, plains of Texas\nnear Abilene, at Camp Barkley and then we went to the desert to get desert training at\nPatton's desert training center, which is now a national monument. And in those days it was\nbleak, dreary, miles of endless wastes, and typical of North Africa where we thought we\nmight go. However that war ended before we got there. So we trained in the States until\nSeptember of 1944. And then we shipped from California to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey; and\nfrom there to England, because the 12th Armored Division had taken our equipment. We\nwere landed in England instead of directly in on the continent. Then from England we got\ntrans-shipped to the continent. And we landed at Cherbourg, and we started to track east\ntowards the, uh, fighting front. And about the time we got there--December 16th, 1944--is\nwhen the Battle of the Bulge started. So we were thrown into the Battle of the Bulge, and\nthat was our first baptismal of fire. And, uh, first couple of days we lost hundreds and\nhundreds of men, wounded and killed. Approximately 300 killed and a couple of thousand\nwounded. And, uh, from there we went to the Siegfried Line after crossing the Rhine River,\nand we traveled across Europe, uh, like vagabonds, thirty miles at a time. We'd stop and wait\nfor the rest of the infantry to catch up. We were in an armored division which would go\nthirty miles in a day easily whereas an infantry division were lucky to go three or four miles\nin a day. So we were always ahead of our, uh, support units. We had infantry in our own\nunits, which defended the people who were, uh, in spear-heading as we called it. And, uh, we\ntravelled across Europe, uh, for, uh, weeks at a time and towards the end of the war was just\na continual pack, pick-up, pack-up, dig-in, pack-up and go, go, go.",
        "Q: Was the fighting very heavy at that point?",
        "A: Uh, well, we had a lot of pockets of resistance. The German people, the Volksturm and the\nSS would drive the local farmers into shooting at us. If they didn't shoot at us, they would\nshoot the farmer. And they made feeble attempts at trying to shoot us naturally and the SS,\nuh, troops kept moving back in towards the interior of Germany, and, uh, the, well, you\nknow, this went on a couple of months. I'm trying to talk here in a few minutes and describe,\nuh, uh, a couple of months of activity--it's very difficult. The, uh, thing that I remember was\nwe started to see our men being killed and because of our men being killed, a couple here\nand a couple there, we would kill whole squads of Germans the way they mowed down the,\nuh, prisoners and, uh, their opponents. And sometimes the hillsides would be covered with\nbodies of the Americans, or a hillside would be covered with the bodies of the Germans, and\nthen later on when they were trying to march the political prisoners that were in,\nconcentration camp inmates or, uh, slaves on farms, they would, uh, march them ahead of\nthem trying to get them out of our way so we wouldn't see what we they had done to these\npeople apparently. And uh....",
        "Q: Did you see any of this?",
        "A: Yes. These bodies were lying along the roadsides where they'd fallen in exhaustion or they\nwere shot because they weren't going fast enough and, uh, it was a terrible thing but, uh, it\nwas practically a common occurrence in the last days of the war. From April 15th to the end\nof the war we saw this in many places and, uh, uh, the, uh....",
        "Q: Was that your first contact with concentration camp victims?",
        "A: Was, was in April, about the 15th of April, yeah, we started to see the where they had been\nmarched ahead of us because, uh, in because of the nature of the spear-heading, the 11th\nArmored was a part of Patton's 3rd Army which you see here on my cap, this is the 11th\nArmored Division, and I was in the 56th Engineers, and that's this little insignia right here\nwhich is our uniform insignia. And the 11th Armored patch was ordinarily worn on your\nshoulder and, uh, there there were several armored divisions. We were one of them. The 4th\nArmored was a sister division, and we were leap-frogging ahead, uh, in spurts as it were until\nand then we'd rest for a day or two until the infantry caught up to, to, uh, contain the lands\nthat we had just over-run. And that's when we would see these prisoners who had been\nwalking ahead of us for a couple of days. We'd catch up to them and we'd see the ones who\nhad been, uh, uh, had died along the roadsides. And by the hundreds in some cases, and then\njust here and there and then they tried to bury some and they were, made half-hearted\nattempts because they took too much time to bury them. They were trying to hide the, the\nones that had died and then there were so many of them they just left them after a while.",
        "Q: All right, tell me if you would where you were as you were about to approach Mauthausen?\nHow did you get there?",
        "A: Well, uh, we were in a combat command. And Combat Command A is the one I was in\nordinarily. Uh, we were down in...in Linz. We were, we forked out. A combat command, one\nwould go to the left, one would go to the rnght and sometimes a third combat command\ncalled \"CCR,\" or \"Reserve,\" would take a central point. And there would be three prongs of\nus armored, uh, divisions spanning out and covering as much territory as we could; and\ntaking it in and and opposing and and mowing down the opposition with our heavy guns, our\n75, uh, millimeter guns and three-inch guns on, uh, tank destroyers. And, uh, we kept going\nand going and until we got to Linz. That was CCA, but CCB went, uh, to the north of us...",
        "Q: Excuse me. Translate. What is CCB...?",
        "A: Combat Command B. There are three combat commands in an armored division - Combat\nCommand A, which is, uh, composed of select troops depending on a situation from the\nmain body of the division which of 11,000 men, and, uh, CCB would be another group of\nmen, engineers and tank destroyers, uh, or artillery depending on what we thought we\nneeded, medical men and of course supplies always brought up the rear, following the trains-\n-they called it division train. And then CCR was a reserve command of troops ready to go to\nthe aid of CCB or CCA whichever was needed. In most cases they were always in the back.\nBut when needed, they would be shifted to the front, or to relieve the pressure of one group\nthat was in the front. For instance, CCA was stuck in the, uh, certain section of Siegfred line\nfor a couple of days and couldn't get through and had some casualties, so they took them\nback and CCR replaced them. That's the, that's the, there's three parts--they call it a triangular\ndivision, and those are the three parts.",
        "Q: So you were moving toward Mauthausen ....",
        "A: Right, and CCB, uh, were the ones that found the camp. They, uh, the doctor--that's, uh,\nDoormeyer (ph), I believe it was, he had gotten a Red Cross, uh, official and they came\ndown the road and with a Red Cross flag flying on their, uh, Volkswagen, and, uh, our men\nspotted it and the one fellow, uh, Sergeant Albert, uh, J. Kosiek,\u2019 uh, was able to speak\nPolish and so did the doctor that was in this, uh, uh, vehic..uh, Volkswagen. And, uh, he said,\n\"We have a camp. They're ready to surrender. We want you to come and take the...the\nGermans prisoner.\u201d And they came down to meet us; so they took us right to the camp. And,\nuh, the fellows were greeted with cheers and the SS troops had already evacuated because\nthey knew what was going to happen to them, and they only left the ordinary German\nsoldiers there who were guards. And these, uh, German soldiers, uh, had of course thrown all\ntheir weapons in and now the people had them. And they were ready to shoot all the soldiers,\nbut, uh, we kept them from doing that and, uh, but they did hang some of the worst, uh,\nguards, some of the ones that had treated them the worst--the, they took care of them before\nwe got there actually. They were hanging on the fences, uh, butchered and, uh, desecrated;\nit's no worse than what they had done except here you saw an able-bodied man now hanging\non an electric fence and, uh, cut apart and they they were paying back a little bit you know of\nwhat they had gotten.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's back up a minute. You are about, you are approaching the camp. You have your\nyour doctor in front of you?",
        "A: Yeah, this doctor went, went, uh, took us right up to the camp and right to the main gate and,\nuh....",
        "Q: Describe that. Describe entering the camp. Tell me exactly what you saw.",
        "A: Well, uh, let let me put this, uh, let me get you straight on this. I had gone with CCA to Linz\nOfficially, Staff Sargeant Albert J. Kosiek. Platoon leader of First Platoon, Troop D, 41st\nCavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, Mechanized.\nand we had, uh, taken over two tons of dynamite off the Adolph Hitler Bridge, my squad and\nI, because we don't want nobody else there because if, if there was booby trap we\noverlooked, it would have blown the whole bridge and ourselves to bits. Meantime this was\ngoing on at the camp. I'm telling you what Albert Kosiack told us, when we went back in\n1975 and he had, we had, uh, we went over by plane and we went, we were together for a\nweek or so, and we talked this thing over and, uh, I feel as if I were there. And, uh, well the\npeople just hugged them fellows; they just, they--it was indescribable. They were so happy.\nThey were screaming and they were trying to touch them and, uh, fellows and, uh, he said\nhe'll never forget it and of course the doctor who was, uh, who could speak Polish was, was,\nthe doctor told, uh, Kosiack told the doctor to have the people who now had the German\nmachine guns and everything to please stack them up and, uh, we'll take care of them. So\nthey set fire to them. So that the people wouldn't have the guns because they would be going\ndown in the countryside shooting everybody, so to keep them from doing that, they stacked\nall the guns and then they set fire to them. But the, by the time we got near, the people knew\nthe war was over because airplanes and radios, they had, somebody had a radio--they had\none radio in the camp--and they knew the war was almost over. It wasn't over until the 8th.\nWe got there on May 5th, three days before the war was over.",
        "Q: When did you physically get to the camp?",
        "A: I got into the camp about May 10th, when they called for the engineers to come with\nbulldozers. I was in the engineers as I explained before, and my friend Al Salzman (ph) from\nMassachusetts was a bulldozer operator so, uh, I was helping him and, uh, taking movies and\nblack and white pictures, slides. I had all the film I needed because, you may think this 1s\nfunny, but I had a lot of girlfriends and these girls were sending me film from the United\nStates, and I had all the movies that I took pictures everyday of combat. When I wasn't being\nshot at I was shooting with movie film and with, uh, black and white. And I have hundreds\nand hundreds of feet of movie film which unfortunately didn't all get home. It was x-rayed. It\nwas, uh, lost. It was stolen. It was buried. One, one, in one timea__\u2014_\u2014s went night through\nmy knapsack full of Battle of the Bulge pictures. The 35 millimeters, most of mine was gone.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's let's get back, we're back from the film.",
        "A: Yeah, right. Well, I'm just trying to tell you why I got the film in the camp. I had all film and\nI'm sorry I don't have all of the film that I did take. But anyway ....",
        "Q: I want to see, for the purpose of this tape, I need to ask you if you would to describe the\nscene at Mauthausen when you, Ray Buch, first went through those camps.",
        "A: Okay. We came up through the town and, uh, it's on a steep hillside, on the top of a mountain\nand a quarry is, uh, next to 1t which is below them and part of the mountain which the camp\nsets on, if they keep on quarrying there the camp will fall down into the quarry. Uh, as we\napproached it looked like a hugh prison which we have back in the States. And that's exactly\nwhat it was. However, inside the prison walls and in back of them were, uh, compounds\nconsisting of barracks, which held a couple of hundred people and these were in the main\npart of the camp, on the top part and here we saw double electrified fences. Uh, uh, people\nwere by this time sunning themselves, and a lot of people were nude because they had no\nclothes: they had been worn off or torn off by those who were stronger and, uh, people were\nwalking around nude because they didn't have enough clothes at the time. Uh, we had, uh, as\nI said there were other visitors coming. In fact I think the Russians came one of the days and\nthey of course they started then to bring troops in from the Russian front, from the American\nside, (cough) excuse me, and from the German civilians nearby we started to get those\npeople to come up by the truckload and we told them to dress in their Sunday best, and then\nwe made them dig graves, and, uh, we wanted them to see what was going on and then we\nhad them carry the bodies, load the bodies in the wagons. We took wagonload after\nwagonload of bodies out to the grave site, which was the soccer field or the sport, uh, they\ncall it the Sportplatz. And, uh, we made the Germans handle, load them up in the wagons\nfrom inside the camp, take them down to the the, uh, graveyard, the grave site, and unload\nthem, put them down in the graves, side by side, by the hundreds--would be a hundred and\nfifty people or so in a row--and side, practically on top of each other. They were such, they\nwere all skin and bones and it was--I have pictures of them and movies which you'll see\nlater, but the, uh, uh, bodies were so emaciated that that you you couldn't possibly\nunderstand how those people were alive and walking around. And, uh, some of those\nwalking around looked better than the dead, of course, a little better than the dead and some\nof them looked worse, and they're still alive depending on their resistance or whatever--I\ndon't know. But it was incredible that they were still walking in many cases. The walking\ndead we called them at that time.",
        "Q: What was the reaction of the German civilians to having to bury the dead? What did they . .\n9",
        "A: They, they all they just shook their heads. They were crying. They said, No, nein, nein--we\ndidn't know--we knew they were a camp,\" but they didn't realize what was happening to all\nthe people because they had, uh, a quarry with a railroad--they ran, uh, stone out you know\non the train down below. On a lower level there was a railroad track to take the train, uh, the\nquarry stone out to different building projects throughout Austria. Went to the main railroad,\ndown along the Danube. And, uh, they didn't realize that the there would be carloads of, uh,\nuh, clothing going out from all these people, would be going out by the carloads to be\nreprocessed into new blankets and German Army uniforms or whatever, uh, from the people\nwho had died. And they didn't incinerate any of the clothing the clothing because, uh, it was\nbad enough burning up the bodies that they burned, and, uh, the German people were were,\nknew there was a camp. They knew people was going to it but I don't thing they knew how\nbad it was. It's a similar situation in the United States--now we have newspaper reporters that\nget in and we tear our jails apart. We know what's going on because we're an open free\npublic, but under a dictatorship, I believe that most of those people did not know and they\nacted as if they didn't know. And they cried. Of course we did too. I can cry right now\nthinking about how terrible it was and, uh, I had an empathy for them because, uh, I was of\nGerman descent. My parents spoke German and, uh, but however they didn't teach it to me\nbecause it was taboo in World War I and I knew my English and only knew a few words,\nmostly cuss words in German. When my father would get mad, he would say,\n. Uh, that, that's my imperfect German but that's what about the extent of my\nGerman. However I picked it up over there and I was able to interview a couple of the girls. I\npicked on girls because they were pretty as, as you, as I said before; I don't know why but the\nthese girls always did me favors and this one girl said that she had been marched ahead of\nthe German troops from Silesia and coll... and the story confirms what I had said earlier\nabout marching them from the ea..western front towards the center of Germany and from the\neastern front towards the center of Germany, and they had marched all these thousands of\npeople in, uh, to Mauthausen from various camps around the east and west and this one girl\nwas, uh, been marched for about a week she said ahead of the Germans. She says better to\nwith the Germans than the Russians, because they were raping the girls and the women and\nit was pathetic. We had a line of demarcation, the Steyr River; the Russians on one side and\nthe Americans on the other. And it was bedlam over there - screaming and killing and\nshooting and tearing the place apart. They [the Russians] would send the toilets back home\nand the sink...the running water, they, forgetting that they needed running water. And they\nwere just a bunch of wild animals, the Russian soldiers.",
        "Q: Let's come back to Mauthausen.",
        "A: Yeah. Right.",
        "Q: Okay. You are in Mauthausen. You have started to bury the dead. Uh, were you involved at\nall in helping to get the camp organized? What, what was done?",
        "A: Well, the camp, the doctors started coming in and they had already had, uh, uh, experience\nApril 15th, uh, out in, uh, Dachau. It was one of the biggest ones we overran, which was\naround April 15th. So by the 5th of May when we got there, and a couple of days later when\nthe engineers got there to, to start digging trenches to bury the dead, uh, they were pretty\nmuch, uh, they pretty well knew what they had to do to help these people, so we rushed in\nsupplies and, uh, emergency supplies from, uh, the Army medical, uh, supplies and surplus,\nuh, Army uniforms and, uh, the, uh, various factories and warehouses around that the\nGermans had or the Austrians had were utilized to supply foo. We raided those in other\nwords, and we, the civilian population had, was, had to go without. In fact that winter, the\nfollowing winter, they a lot of them almost starved. Uh, but we were trying to to feed these\npeople. And, uh, our division set up the, uh...and Colonel Seibel was in command, and he\nwas 1n command of CCB at the time as I mentioned earlier. And he directed the, uh, uh ...the\nproceedings, that is, uh, the cleaning up of the camp and the burning of this and burning of\nthat. Some of the clothes and things that we, were burned up and old, uh, latrines--uh, they\nwere filthy. Uh, we tried to get rid of some of the things that were contagious that would\nspread germs and so on. So the people themselves were still dying because they were beyond\nhelp. We got there too late and they died daily, uh, by the hundreds the first few days and\nthen they tapered off and there was a few, maybe a dozen a day, uh, thirty days later. But, uh,\nwe were there for about thirty days, our division, and then the 26th Infantry Division took\nover. In fact, some of those came in early so they could see how we were doing it. Our men\nstood guard to keep the, uh, people under control because some of the, the Russian prisoners\nwere very aggressive anduh....",
        "Q: What does that mean?",
        "A: Well, they they wanted to shoot every German that came in the place because they had been,\nuh, put in, incarcerated 1n this camp and they were skin and bones and they, they were ready\nto tear them apart with their bare hands, so we had to have our men walking around with\nguns to keep everything, keep the keep these people from uh killing each other or killing\ntheir former, uh, masters so called.",
        "Q: What was your role in the camp?",
        "A: Well, I was, uh, an engineer and and as I said our, my project was to, uh, help bury the dead\nbecause my buddy, Al Salzman, was on a bulldozer and I helped him grease it and maintain\nit and, uh, had opportunity to see quite a lot of the camp. Well, and so did he, and its amazing\nhow, uh, you can forget details. There was so many things going on and if somebody\nprompts you or if you see a picture, they'll bring back a whole story just about a picture. Uh,\na picture can tell a thousand words. Well, I took a lot of movies and maybe they'll be put on\ntape later and that'll explain some of what I'm talking about. But, uh... .",
        "Q: What other parts . . . you've, you've described the burial of the dead very well and I thank\nyou.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh, what other parts of the camp did you see?",
        "A: Oh I, we went through the, uh, barracks, the different barracks to see how the people were.\nAnd....",
        "Q: What was the condition of the barracks?",
        "A: All right. The barracks were, this was, in the few days that we were there, the first few days\nthat we were there, there were still some dead in the bunks, and we were getting the German\npeople to take them out, and they threw them out like (ph) out in the yards, and they\nwere piled up there. Then from there they took and put them into wagons and took them\ndown to the graveyard. And now in the barracks where the, uh, people, where there were six\nhundred in a barracks, there were two and three people in each bunk. They were so skinny\nfrom malnutrition that, uh, two people could sleep side by side very easily and they, there\nwere so few bunks they had to take turns sleeping. And, uh, uh, I took pictures, movies\ninside the barracks and, uh, I'll never forget these people were so weak that the ones who\nhad, were stronger, would strip the clothes off of the weak ones who couldn't fight back and\nput those clothes on themselves because they were better for instance than their own. None\nof these people were issued clothes. They had uniforms and when the uniforms wore out at\nthis late stage of the war, why they were nude. And there were so many women just lying\nnude in their bunks they and I I felt bad about taking movies of them so I got some of them\nwaving but I didn't make it a point to ... and anyhow I didn't get all those movies home\nanyhow. But I do have some in the barracks. This will explain what I am talking about. It\nwas unbelievable. The barracks, uh, in the barracks the bunks were four to six high and had\nto climb up like monkeys and some of them were too weak to get to their bunks, so they\nsleep on the bottom one and the ones that were stronger would sleep on top. And, uh, that's\nwhere I interviewed the young lady from, uh, Sil... Upper Silesia, and you'd wonder when\nyou see her, uh, why she looked so, uh, well-nourished. It's only because she had of her own\nvia...volition, of her own free will, marched with those prisoners ahead of the Russians to get\naway from the Russians. And, uh, 1t was an anachronism in the middle of all this starving,\nstarv...and starved people and these human skeletons to see someone looking as well as she\ndid. But there were quite a few others that had just been marched in a few days before and\nhadn't had a chance to starve. The way, I hate to even, it, it, it's so silly when you think back\non it, how these people just starved to death. They would give them rations of one piece of\nbread, a crumb of bread for a day, and a lot of times the bread was moldy and we started\nfeeding them with soup and, uh, bread which we made from the flour we got downtown. We\ngot the bakeries going and a little later on we got carpenters in, from the German soldiers,\ncarpenters and plumbers and to get everything back in order because a lot of things were\ndestroyed in the, by the people in fighting and then they destroyed it themselves because\nthey were so sick of the camp--they were trying to knock down wire and everything. It was,\nuh, double electrified fences to keep them in the compounds and, uh, the bodies were just\nthrown outside the barracks into pile, into piles in the streets there. There's no place else to\nbur...there's no place to bury them in the camp, the upper part, until we started digging these\ntrenches. And, uh, let's see....",
        "Q: What else did you see in camp?",
        "A: Well, as I said, the people were lining up, uh, uh, to, uh, go to these, uh, soup mill... or\nkitchens or soup pots and what always struck me so odd, the people would be walking\nwithout shirts or without pants on, and they didn't think anything of it; they were so used to\nseeing humans nude most of the time. They stripped them everyday and hosed them down.\nThis is stories that they told us later. But I actually saw and have movies of people walking\naround without clothes on and think nothing of it. The men in particular. Uh, the women\nweren't that, uh, uh, aggressive. In other words they, they were more polite. They tried to\nhide themselves. And the women that were nude in their bunks would put their hands over\ntheir breasts and it was pathetic. Very sad. I'm, I'm glad that it, that it has never been that bad\nsince, uh, that is that we we haven't publicized these things, but what we do know and we\nhope that it never happens again and, uh, if these pictures will help prove a point, I'm sure\nthey won't happen again.",
        "Q: Did you see the quarry?",
        "A: Oh yes. It was, as I said, 1t was down, uh, uh, below the camp itself. The camp was on the\nhighest point of the hill. The quarry was, was starting to go into the side of the mountain\ntowards the; ultimately they, as I said earlier, the camp would have fallen in if they quarried\nthat far. But the the staircase, they, they quarried the staircase right out of the stone of the\nmountain and, uh, there were big blocks of stone. It was a typical quarry. They were making\nbuilding blocks for the bridges and the highways and also for stone buildings that they, uh,\nwere putting up here and there. Uh, most of the stones were going for, uh, highways and for\nreinforcing underground bunkers and things like that and the people had to carry stones up\nthe stairs, to the main camp because they built a hugh dividing wall between the quarters of\nthe SS troopers and the, uh, kitchen and the infirmary or the hospital. They built a stone wall\nbetween those and the, uh, barracks where they had the experimental prisoners, where they\nthey inoculated them with all kinds of, uh, germs or they froze them in vats of water and, uh,\nexperimented generally.",
        "Q: Describe if you would what the experimental compound looked like.",
        "A: Well, uh, if you've ever been in an Army camp in the United States, you'll see rows and rows\nof barracks. Well, these were a little closer together. Uh, 1t reminded me of chicken coops on\na big chicken ranch, and, uh, there was about seven rows of them and about ten buildings in\neach row. And there was about two hundred people 1n each one of those barracks. They were\nsmaller than the ones down at the lower side of the camp where, where the quarry prisoners,\nuh, were quartered, and, uh, I don't know uh....",
        "Q: What was the condition, what were conditions like inside these barracks?",
        "A: Uh, well they were less crowded because, uh, they still had the bunks but they had about\nthree high and they still had about two people in 1n each one, but they weren't, they weren't\nas elaborate, hugh; the buildings weren't as big as the ones in the lower camp, the lower\nsection of the camp. Uh, they were smaller and only about two hundred people in each,\nwhich is almost what we had in our own Army barracks 1n the States. We had about a\nhundred and fifty--well not a hundred and...uh, the bigger ones did but we had about\nseventy-five men and where we had seventy-five men, they had two hundred. That's how\nmuch more crowded the bunks were on top of each other whereas we only had bunks on the\nfloor.",
        "Q: What were the condition, the physical condition of these prisoners?",
        "A: Well, it was very much the same as these the ones that we saw ear... earlier who were when\nwe first came in--the ones who were the strongest naturally had the guns and everything.\nAnd but these people that we saw were very weak. They were all starved and all trying to eat\na little soup. Uh, we had already started soup kitchens, the first, first day we got there\npractically. Because the Army, we have so many cooks-- every one, every company has a\ncook--so we didn't eat. We forfeited our food and told our mess sergeants to take it to the\ncamp, which they did for the first couple of days until we got steady stream of supplies\ncoming in.",
        "Q: Did you go in to the experimental labs?",
        "A: No, I, I, they didn't have them set up. They, uh, these experiments were going on before we\ngot there. This is what these people were telling us. I didn't see any of, of these inno...\ninoculations or bathing in ice water or whatever. It's just, uh, what the people were telling us\nand what the records show now that from all kinds of witnesses and from the German\nrecords and so on. It collor...you know; it confirms the stories that we heard then. Couldn't--\nthey were unbelievable. In fact most of the guys were in a daze--so when they got, they\ncouldn't, they they didn't want to comprehend what they had seen. They wanted to forget it.\nIf you ask any of the fellows about what they saw at this camp, they--1t was terrible. It stunk\nand the smell was awful. As I said, I was brought up on a farm from age 10, and farm smells\ndidn't bother me, uh, even the vilest, and they were vile--you know, these dead people. Some\nof them had been dead for a couple of days or more and then they had dysentery and their\nrectums were all sore and the, the skin was eaten away. These were people that are still alive\nlet alone the dead ones, and they smelled. But I--the, the decaying flesh I was used to\nbecause on a farm we had all sorts of dead animals and it was much the same. To me, I\nwasn't, uh, it didn't bother me. But most of the fellows remember the smell because they\nwere city boys. They had not, uh, been exposed to this type of thing. So and as I said, uh,\nhave thought it since then, we were 1n order and we were used to 1t because we had seen\nthese bodies along the road for a few days before we got to the camp and, uh, we had seen\nthese stripped uniforms and these these human skeletons that, uh, were dead as we went by\nthem, as we went, as we were spear-heading.",
        "Q: Was there anything else about Mauthausen that strikes you in particular?",
        "A: Well, the the security they had: they had the, they built another stone wall between the\ndouble electrified fence which was the original partition between the, the German officers'\nquarters; they had a double electrified fence with this trench in between with barbed wire on\nthe ground over the trench and, uh, the the security that they had to provide for themselves to\nkeep these people from climbing over the wall to get at them. And, uh, they had machine gun\nnests at every corner of the walls overlooking the compound, and, uh, the other thing I\ncouldn't get over was how the people were all out in the sun trying to sun themselves\nbecause they were confined in the barracks a lot of them and they weren't even out working\nanymore. They were just kept in the barracks and they'd feed them with a few crusts of bread\nand it was a real mess. Everything was smelly. There were no latrine facilities and, uh, they\nwere doing it out in the streets in you know their bowel movements and so on--such as they\nhad, which wasn't very much. And I was a medic and I was amazed at having been in,\nhaving taught first aid before I went in the Army and being a medic at times in the Army on\nmaneuvers, I was a medical aide, corpsman we called them. Uh, I was quite stricken, uh,\nstricken I should say by the fact that the genitals, or genitalia of the men and the women\nwere the last things to apparently go because they looked normal. The women's breasts had\nshrunk quite a bit, but their nipples and, uh, and looked normal. And the men's penises and\ntesticles were about normal. And the rest of them were absolutely bones and, uh, with skin\nstretched over them. And that's the one thing that I'll never forget is, 1s the condition of, of\nthe things that are needed to reproduce life. They're the last things to go, as far as I could see.\nIn other words, Mother Nature was trying to save the reproductive organs. It was the one\nthing that struck me out of looking at all these thousands of dead whenever we buried them.\nAnd as I said, we had these, uh, they couldn't dig the graves fast enough so we got our\nbulldozers to dig the trenches, push the dirt out and then was a, uh, was a token for the\nGermans to get shovels and start to shovel the dirt back into the trenches. Well we'd have\nbeen there for another two weeks burying them if we had to do everything by hand. We did\ndig a few trenches by hand, but we then used the bulldozers because there were so many.\nThey had them stacked up by the hundreds waiting to be buried. They couldn't dig the graves\nfast enough by hand, so that's why we got the German, uh, civilians in there to, uh, handle\nthem. They put them down in the graves and laid them side by side and then they would\nthrow a few shovels of dirt in and I'll never forget as the bulldozer, as Al pushed the, uh,\nstone and sand back into the trenches, you would hear a stone crunching the ribs and the\nbones of the poor bodies down below. It was, because this was backfill for the soccer field\nwas made out of backfill and from the quarry and there were a lot of hard stones\nmixed in and when they pushed the stones in they further crushed the poor things that were\nlaid to rest in that, uh, area. After the war they said that they moved the bodies to the upper\ncamp--see this was down at the lower level, the sports field. Then there was another lower\nlevel down around on the quarry level and, uh, there's now a third graveyard up on the top\nwhere the, uh, the old barracks used to be for the experimental prisoners in the upper part of\nthe camp. The stone wall is gone now that was 1n between, the electrified fences are long\ngone and shortly after we got most of the people into medical tents away from the camp\neven. We moved them out into field hospitals; we burned the buildings down because they\nwere that smelly and filthy from all the you know unclean--there's no place, no la...no\nfacilities for latrines. They had these ditches 1n the streets, and when the rains came, it\nwould wash everything down the hillside. So all that's gone now and it's, it's a graveyard.\nThey said they moved the bodies from that sports field or soccer field but when I went back\nin 1975 the trees had grown over it already in 35 years. I went there 35 years later and, uh,\nthe, it was so changed. It was a big museum now. Where we had seen all these barracks there\nwere only; they left three of, uh, in the first row, I think there were three, no four left which\nwere now made a museum. They showed, they had those on exhibit. But the huge barracks\ndown below--they had six hundred to eight hundred people in them were all gone, used up\nfor other purposes. But we did burn most of the barracks 1n the upper part. We left a few in\nthe front which apparently were the cleanest. And, uh, we went back in 1975 and the\nAustrian civilians had a dinner for us. They provided us with, uh, a chauffeur and a\nlimousine and they, uh, it was unbelievable how they treated us. We were like heroes. And\nthe people, when we went back were hugging us again and trying to touch us and they were\ngrabbing souvenirs and we were giving out little buttons like I have here from my various\noutfits. These are unit insignia. Here's the 41st Cavalry which happens to be the unit that was\nthe first ones in the gate. And this Michael Green who was in the 41st Cavalry is going back\nto Europe this, uh, in 1990 for the 40th Anniversary, 45th Anniversary and, uh, he's bringing\nsome of these along to give to the people for souvenirs. But, uh, we were back again in 1980\nand we're trying to go back every five years, and we meet the people that we released, and\nwe meet their children, and now we're bringing our children and it's a great thing that the\nsurvivors of Mauthausen, and there were around 12,000 alive when we got there. And I\nguess maybe un another couple of hundred died and so there were 11,000 actual people alive\nwhen we got there, but the ones coming back are the families of the victims who died in\nMauthausen. They come back by the thousands. But we were back in 1975 there were\naround 12,000 people there and you wouldn't know how they got there because every road\nwas full of these big, uh, tourists bus that hold fifty people--they were lined up like, uh, cars\naround a football stadium in the States. Incredible where they come from Spain and\nHungary, Hungaria--all the countries of Europe and, uh, we were, as I said, when they found\nout we were the liberators they couldn't do enough for us. They practically tore the, they\nwanted our hats; they wanted, they were going to tear the clothes off us. We were real\ncelebrities. So I felt good about that and I'm; I just felt so sad about all those that were killed,\nover a hundred twenty thousand were killed in that camp. Or more. They're not sure. It's\nbetween a hundred twenty, hundred fifty thousand that they know of.",
        "Q: Is there anything else about Mauthausen that you remember in particular?",
        "A: Well, nothing except that it was made so the people couldn't get out, and as I said it looked\nlike a prison when we first observed it, and 1t was more like a prison when you got in it, uh,\nbecause they don't have the double electrified fences. Our prisons have fences, but not\nelectrified, and, uh, the, uh, condition of the people--the human skeletons walking around\nwas another thing that impressed me. As I said the, uh, that anybody could be alive and that\nthin when they looked like bones, their legs, their arms, their feet looked swollen in many\ncases. That was the only thing that looked anywheres near normal was from their ankles\ndown to their insteps. Uh, the rest of the bodies were, uh, skin drawn over their faces as if it\nwere shrunk in the heat or whatever--just unbelievable. And I don't know what else to\nsay...the smells as I said were terrible, but I wasn't too fazed by that for some reason, and I\nthink it was because of my upbringing on a farm.",
        "Q: Okay. Thank you. You had mentioned that some of your men were in Dachau. Were you in\nDachau as well?",
        "A: Uh, no, only after the war. Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell us if you would please, you were in Mauthausen for thirty days roughly?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Where did you go from...no, before we do that, what--by the time you left at the end of thirty\ndays--what shape was the camp in?",
        "A: Oh, as I said, we started to burn some of the buildings and, uh, the, uh, we backfilled the\ntrenches and the latrines and most of the people were gone. The ones who could walk started\nwalking home within a couple of days. And, uh, the ones who were very sick we moved out\ninto field hospitals and, uh, some of those that stayed were trying to help us get the records to\nfind out and to check on how many people were killed and to keep track of everything and\nwe had some of the people working there because they didn't want to go home. A lot of them\nwere Russians and they didn't want to go back to to Russia, so, uh, we tried to keep them, uh,\nworking in the camp and they, because the they said if we go back to Russia it will be the\nend of us. And it was we found out later. They were sent to the salt mines, to Siberia in other\nwords, and, uh, that was something that I didn't think of until just now, but, uh, they were\nglad to be left behind. They didn't want to go back to Russia and we, they, uh, incidentally\nfrom after we let the, as I say, uh, should say, we took the demolitions off the bridge in Linz.\nOur group, our engineers were then sent out into, uh, north of CCB and the camp, and\nthousands, hundreds of thousands of German soldiers and White Russians tried to surrender\nto us. And we accepted their surrender, and, uh, in place, but they wanted to come into\nGermany you know, on our side of the line because they didn't want to be anywheres near\nthe Russians and unfortunately our politicians had said this is the line of demarcation and all\nthose Russians on that side, I mean Germans, will have to go back to the Russians and so a\ncouple of hundred thousand soldiers that surrendered to us were returned to the Germans\n[Russians] and shipped to Siberia. But that was, that was the 6th of May. In fact it was the\nafternoon of the 5th, the 6th and the 7th, and on about the 8th I got to the camp, and I was\nthere on and off for a couple of days, but the main part was when we got the the ditches or\ntrenches dug for the graves. That was my main job there.",
        "Q: Where did you go when you left Mauthausen?",
        "A: Oh, we were sent into various little cities in Austria, uh, to maintain order and, uh, make sure\nthere was no looting by the, uh, prisoners who had gotten away from the camp. They were\nall over. They were going to march home, but they wanted clothes. They were either stealing\nit from the Germans or taking it from the Germans, and they were fighting going on and we\nhad to maintain order. It was a real madhouse. And, uh, we were sent to Schwanenstadt. And\nthen from there we were, as engineers, we were sent out to maintain roads and rebuild\nbridges and, uh, electrical plants and, uh, to guard the prisoners in Ebensee, which was a\ncamp--a concentration camp--and it was now full of SS prisoners. And these haughty\nbastards, as we called them, were very independent; and, uh, they...they wouldn't...they didn't\nwant to do anything. They thought they were still lords of the universe, being SS and being\nused to that, uh, having control, uh, full control over civilians and full control over the\nGerman Army. They were the masters of Hitler, they were, uh, Hitler's, uh, supermen. And,\nuh, we now had them crawling because we didn't feed them. They were digging up worms\nand eating worms. They dug up all the grass. It was in May and June that we started putting\nthem in, in late May. And they were digging up the grass. They were eating worms. I mean\nit. And, uh, they were waiting, praying for rain and we had a few days of rain and the worms\nwould come near the top and they would dig them out. And so we started giving them\ncrackers and things, give them a couple of crackers from our K-ration boxes. And we'd get a\nwristwatch which was worth maybe seven or eight dollars, and then we sold them to the\nRussians for over a hundred. And some of the Russians later on were paying five hundred to\na thousand dollars for a Mickey Mouse watch, in particular. And we were getting these\nwatches from the SS men and then selling them to the Russians for souvenirs, because we all\nhad watches. We could get them anytime in the PX for about ten bucks. And here we were\ngetting a hundred dollars to five hundred dollars. And some of the fellows that were able to\ngo to Berlin and trade with the Russians got over a thousand dollars for a wristwatch that we\ngot for a cigarette. The cigarettes were worth money to them. They were like gold. And\nevery soldier had a pack of cigarettes, a carton of cigarettes, a week issued. Whether you\nused them or not, you were entitled to a carton. So a lot of the guys learned how to smoke;\nand I hate to say this, but many of them are dead now because of the lousy habit. And their\nwives always complained, \"Oh, yeah, he's been smoking like this ever since he got out of the\nArmy, and dying of emphysema and lung cancer.\"",
        "Q: Let's go back to Ebensee.",
        "A: Okay. There we had double electrified fences for them. We left them in place. And, uh, we\nhad guard towers and machine guns, and that's what we took turns guarding. And I hated\nthat. I was only there a couple days.",
        "Q: Can you describe the camp? In addition to the fences, what what did you see?",
        "A: Well, the, the main barracks were 1n back of it and, uh, I yust stayed, we had guard towers in\na wire enclosure which we had put up in front. It was something new. We had built that.\nAnd I...I'd seen Mauthausen, so I didn't go to look at the quarters there because I figured\nthey're all the same. And we were too busy taunting the SS men.",
        "Q: How did you taunt them?",
        "A: Well, by offering them cigarettes and then crushing them in front of them and then stamping\non them.",
        "Q: What, uh.... Did you make the SS do, uh, certain chores? How did you...?",
        "A: Well, there was so many of them. And there was really nothing much for them to do. We\nmade them build the fences, yeah, their own \"corrals\" you might call it. Yeah. But we didn't\ntrust them to to do what the ordinary soldiers were doing back in camp, in Mauthausen.\nThere, they were restoring the facilities and cleaning up and they were doing the buggy-\nlugging (ph) when they burnt the camp. And they were burning up anything stuff that was\nNazi that they didn't like--I got a Nazi flag. I said, as I was watching it burn. I said, \"Oh, I'll\ngrab that and see if it's...\u201d And it bur...I guess it's full of holes. I...I don't know. I've never\nunrolled it since I picked it out of the burning pile. And I got it in the car. I was going to\nshow it to you, if you were interested. But that's the only souvenir that I got from the camp.",
        "Q: The SS, uh, I assume eventually you got, uh, soup kitchen up and you fed them finally?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, as I said, I was only there a couple of days because I hated guard\nduty and, uh, it was just standing there watching these guys do nothing. They'd play cards\nand dig for worms and they didn't have much to do. There was not much of an area to dig for\nworms. In a couple of days the worms were gone. Unbelievable. So they were and they were\nwithout shirts, they were, uh, their uniforms were, uh, either torn off of them or whatever by\nsomebody but a lot of them didn't have any shirts. They had pants and, uh, as I said we\ntaunted them the way they did, uh, the civilians. They would shoot the civilians if they didn't\nfire at us earlier in the war and, uh, many times the people said the SS made them do it,\nwhich was true enough.",
        "Q: Did you see any trace of the real prisoners of Ebensee, the former prisoners of Ebensee?",
        "A: No. Uh, the camp was, I had been working at Mauthausen and most of those prisoners now\nthe same as in our camp had, uh--well, those who were well were walking home. They\nweren't going to wait for convoys. And the sick ones were already in camps, uh, hospital\ntents with the 26th Infantry Division. See, the 26th Infantry Division later took over\nMauthausen. And, in fact, I think they got the credit for taking Mauthausen. Because by the\ntime the newspapers finally got there, they claimed--the 26th Infantry Division claimed--they\nhad liberated the camp. They did, in a way; but not the way the 11th Armored did.",
        "Q: Okay. We are almost finished with the tape. Is there anything else that you want to add,\nanything else that you saw that relates to the Holocaust?",
        "A: I'd like to bring out a point which I don't see, uh, discussed very often. And that 1s the fact\nthat I personally knew thirteen men that were killed in action, and some right along side of\nme. And, uh, three hundred were killed in the Battle of the Bulge in the first few days of\ncombat. And then ultimately we lost eight hundred men killed, and four thousand wounded\nor injured; and, uh, these were all expended in the effort to save Europe from Hitler's Nazi\nterrorism. And, uh, I'd like to bring that out, that we made a lot of sacrifices and those\nfellows that did it did it for the freedom not only of the United States but of Europe. And it's\na point that is only brought home when you go over and you walk over their graves, which I\ndid. And you think of the 45 years, it was 40 years when I walked on the grave of my best\nfriend, accidentally. I backed up to take a picture of Patton, his monument, which is at the\nhead of the uh \u2014\u2014 Cemetery. And I backed up to get the big cross in and I put my hand\ndown on a tombstone, and as I walked around it I looked and it was August uh Heddenbock\n(ph), my buddy from back home. And I just bawled. And I am sorry. I'm just overwhelmed.\nBut that is what I'm thinking about--how lucky we are, all of us, to be here, to see the tapes,\nto have a free world, and even with the events happening today to see it coming to pass that\nour efforts have not been in vain. And that is the one thing that I would like to emphasize is\nthat we lost a lot of good buddies.",
        "Q: I cannot think of a more fitting way to end this interview, and I thank you very much.",
        "A: Well, I thank you for the opportunity to express these thoughts and, and hope then as I say\nthat it will never happen again. Thank you, Doctor, for interviewing me. I appreciate it.\n"

        "A: I was born in New York City, in Manhattan, in the Harlem Hospital.",
        "A: In the year 1920, in September 18th.",
        "A: Well, my folks were from, uh, the Ukraine. Uh, my mother came from the Polish side of the\nBug River and and my father was on the Russian side and, uh, they were childhood friends\nand they immigrated to the United States at different times and met in New York and my\nfather was in World War I and, uh, in the infantry which, uh, I was quite proud of as you'll\nfind out later. And, uh, he bought a farm in New Jersey and we shortly moved to New\nJersey, that is the father and mother, and, uh, when my mother was pregnant with me she\nwent to a lying-in hospital which happened to be in New York City because the railroad train\nwent right through our farm, stopped at the house and picked her up and delivered her to\nPennsylvania Station and she took a cab to the hospital.",
        "A: There was no such facilities in New Jersey at the time.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah. Then we went back to the city for a couple of years and I got to be a, uh, street\nbum and, uh, kids learned how to smoke cigarettes and rammed around and got into gang\nfights and the usual. And, uh, at, uh, age ten we moved back to the farm because of the\nDepression and we were on a farm until I was inducted into the Army. I became a carpenter\nbefore I went in the Army, and that's why I was in the engineer... in the engineers. We had,\nuh, uh, I had the background for it, having built factories and movie theaters and different\nstructures, houses, barns and so on in New Jersey before I went in the Army. And in the\nArmy I picked up on that and learned a lot of new things. Learned how to blow up the things\nthat I had built, and which was a terrible thing in my mind--when we had to destroy\nbuildings and bridges and even trees which we blew down occasionally to, uh, to make the\nwar effort a little more, uh, well, not useful but to learn what we had to do in service, in\ncombat. And it stood us in good stead stead because the things we learned were, uh,\nimportant to the Army and nobody else.",
        "A: Well, we went, we [were] inducted in the Army, in the Armed Forces, in 1942, uh, late in\n'42, in November, and we maneuvered in Louisiana and Texas for approximately a year, uh,\na little over a year, and, uh, we, uh, then went to Texas and the plains of dry, plains of Texas\nnear Abilene, at Camp Barkley and then we went to the desert to get desert training at\nPatton's desert training center, which is now a national monument. And in those days it was\nbleak, dreary, miles of endless wastes, and typical of North Africa where we thought we\nmight go. However that war ended before we got there. So we trained in the States until\nSeptember of 1944. And then we shipped from California to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey; and\nfrom there to England, because the 12th Armored Division had taken our equipment. We\nwere landed in England instead of directly in on the continent. Then from England we got\ntrans-shipped to the continent. And we landed at Cherbourg, and we started to track east\ntowards the, uh, fighting front. And about the time we got there--December 16th, 1944--is\nwhen the Battle of the Bulge started. So we were thrown into the Battle of the Bulge, and\nthat was our first baptismal of fire. And, uh, first couple of days we lost hundreds and\nhundreds of men, wounded and killed. Approximately 300 killed and a couple of thousand\nwounded. And, uh, from there we went to the Siegfried Line after crossing the Rhine River,\nand we traveled across Europe, uh, like vagabonds, thirty miles at a time. We'd stop and wait\nfor the rest of the infantry to catch up. We were in an armored division which would go\nthirty miles in a day easily whereas an infantry division were lucky to go three or four miles\nin a day. So we were always ahead of our, uh, support units. We had infantry in our own\nunits, which defended the people who were, uh, in spear-heading as we called it. And, uh, we\ntravelled across Europe, uh, for, uh, weeks at a time and towards the end of the war was just\na continual pack, pick-up, pack-up, dig-in, pack-up and go, go, go.",
        "A: Uh, well, we had a lot of pockets of resistance. The German people, the Volksturm and the\nSS would drive the local farmers into shooting at us. If they didn't shoot at us, they would\nshoot the farmer. And they made feeble attempts at trying to shoot us naturally and the SS,\nuh, troops kept moving back in towards the interior of Germany, and, uh, the, well, you\nknow, this went on a couple of months. I'm trying to talk here in a few minutes and describe,\nuh, uh, a couple of months of activity--it's very difficult. The, uh, thing that I remember was\nwe started to see our men being killed and because of our men being killed, a couple here\nand a couple there, we would kill whole squads of Germans the way they mowed down the,\nuh, prisoners and, uh, their opponents. And sometimes the hillsides would be covered with\nbodies of the Americans, or a hillside would be covered with the bodies of the Germans, and\nthen later on when they were trying to march the political prisoners that were in,\nconcentration camp inmates or, uh, slaves on farms, they would, uh, march them ahead of\nthem trying to get them out of our way so we wouldn't see what we they had done to these\npeople apparently. And uh....",
        "A: Yes. These bodies were lying along the roadsides where they'd fallen in exhaustion or they\nwere shot because they weren't going fast enough and, uh, it was a terrible thing but, uh, it\nwas practically a common occurrence in the last days of the war. From April 15th to the end\nof the war we saw this in many places and, uh, uh, the, uh....",
        "A: Was, was in April, about the 15th of April, yeah, we started to see the where they had been\nmarched ahead of us because, uh, in because of the nature of the spear-heading, the 11th\nArmored was a part of Patton's 3rd Army which you see here on my cap, this is the 11th\nArmored Division, and I was in the 56th Engineers, and that's this little insignia right here\nwhich is our uniform insignia. And the 11th Armored patch was ordinarily worn on your\nshoulder and, uh, there there were several armored divisions. We were one of them. The 4th\nArmored was a sister division, and we were leap-frogging ahead, uh, in spurts as it were until\nand then we'd rest for a day or two until the infantry caught up to, to, uh, contain the lands\nthat we had just over-run. And that's when we would see these prisoners who had been\nwalking ahead of us for a couple of days. We'd catch up to them and we'd see the ones who\nhad been, uh, uh, had died along the roadsides. And by the hundreds in some cases, and then\njust here and there and then they tried to bury some and they were, made half-hearted\nattempts because they took too much time to bury them. They were trying to hide the, the\nones that had died and then there were so many of them they just left them after a while.",
        "A: Well, uh, we were in a combat command. And Combat Command A is the one I was in\nordinarily. Uh, we were down in...in Linz. We were, we forked out. A combat command, one\nwould go to the left, one would go to the rnght and sometimes a third combat command\ncalled \"CCR,\" or \"Reserve,\" would take a central point. And there would be three prongs of\nus armored, uh, divisions spanning out and covering as much territory as we could; and\ntaking it in and and opposing and and mowing down the opposition with our heavy guns, our\n75, uh, millimeter guns and three-inch guns on, uh, tank destroyers. And, uh, we kept going\nand going and until we got to Linz. That was CCA, but CCB went, uh, to the north of us...",
        "A: Combat Command B. There are three combat commands in an armored division - Combat\nCommand A, which is, uh, composed of select troops depending on a situation from the\nmain body of the division which of 11,000 men, and, uh, CCB would be another group of\nmen, engineers and tank destroyers, uh, or artillery depending on what we thought we\nneeded, medical men and of course supplies always brought up the rear, following the trains-\n-they called it division train. And then CCR was a reserve command of troops ready to go to\nthe aid of CCB or CCA whichever was needed. In most cases they were always in the back.\nBut when needed, they would be shifted to the front, or to relieve the pressure of one group\nthat was in the front. For instance, CCA was stuck in the, uh, certain section of Siegfred line\nfor a couple of days and couldn't get through and had some casualties, so they took them\nback and CCR replaced them. That's the, that's the, there's three parts--they call it a triangular\ndivision, and those are the three parts.",
        "A: Right, and CCB, uh, were the ones that found the camp. They, uh, the doctor--that's, uh,\nDoormeyer (ph), I believe it was, he had gotten a Red Cross, uh, official and they came\ndown the road and with a Red Cross flag flying on their, uh, Volkswagen, and, uh, our men\nspotted it and the one fellow, uh, Sergeant Albert, uh, J. Kosiek,\u2019 uh, was able to speak\nPolish and so did the doctor that was in this, uh, uh, vehic..uh, Volkswagen. And, uh, he said,\n\"We have a camp. They're ready to surrender. We want you to come and take the...the\nGermans prisoner.\u201d And they came down to meet us; so they took us right to the camp. And,\nuh, the fellows were greeted with cheers and the SS troops had already evacuated because\nthey knew what was going to happen to them, and they only left the ordinary German\nsoldiers there who were guards. And these, uh, German soldiers, uh, had of course thrown all\ntheir weapons in and now the people had them. And they were ready to shoot all the soldiers,\nbut, uh, we kept them from doing that and, uh, but they did hang some of the worst, uh,\nguards, some of the ones that had treated them the worst--the, they took care of them before\nwe got there actually. They were hanging on the fences, uh, butchered and, uh, desecrated;\nit's no worse than what they had done except here you saw an able-bodied man now hanging\non an electric fence and, uh, cut apart and they they were paying back a little bit you know of\nwhat they had gotten.",
        "A: Yeah, this doctor went, went, uh, took us right up to the camp and right to the main gate and,\nuh....",
        "A: Well, uh, let let me put this, uh, let me get you straight on this. I had gone with CCA to Linz\nOfficially, Staff Sargeant Albert J. Kosiek. Platoon leader of First Platoon, Troop D, 41st\nCavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, Mechanized.\nand we had, uh, taken over two tons of dynamite off the Adolph Hitler Bridge, my squad and\nI, because we don't want nobody else there because if, if there was booby trap we\noverlooked, it would have blown the whole bridge and ourselves to bits. Meantime this was\ngoing on at the camp. I'm telling you what Albert Kosiack told us, when we went back in\n1975 and he had, we had, uh, we went over by plane and we went, we were together for a\nweek or so, and we talked this thing over and, uh, I feel as if I were there. And, uh, well the\npeople just hugged them fellows; they just, they--it was indescribable. They were so happy.\nThey were screaming and they were trying to touch them and, uh, fellows and, uh, he said\nhe'll never forget it and of course the doctor who was, uh, who could speak Polish was, was,\nthe doctor told, uh, Kosiack told the doctor to have the people who now had the German\nmachine guns and everything to please stack them up and, uh, we'll take care of them. So\nthey set fire to them. So that the people wouldn't have the guns because they would be going\ndown in the countryside shooting everybody, so to keep them from doing that, they stacked\nall the guns and then they set fire to them. But the, by the time we got near, the people knew\nthe war was over because airplanes and radios, they had, somebody had a radio--they had\none radio in the camp--and they knew the war was almost over. It wasn't over until the 8th.\nWe got there on May 5th, three days before the war was over.",
        "A: I got into the camp about May 10th, when they called for the engineers to come with\nbulldozers. I was in the engineers as I explained before, and my friend Al Salzman (ph) from\nMassachusetts was a bulldozer operator so, uh, I was helping him and, uh, taking movies and\nblack and white pictures, slides. I had all the film I needed because, you may think this 1s\nfunny, but I had a lot of girlfriends and these girls were sending me film from the United\nStates, and I had all the movies that I took pictures everyday of combat. When I wasn't being\nshot at I was shooting with movie film and with, uh, black and white. And I have hundreds\nand hundreds of feet of movie film which unfortunately didn't all get home. It was x-rayed. It\nwas, uh, lost. It was stolen. It was buried. One, one, in one timea__\u2014_\u2014s went night through\nmy knapsack full of Battle of the Bulge pictures. The 35 millimeters, most of mine was gone.",
        "A: Yeah, right. Well, I'm just trying to tell you why I got the film in the camp. I had all film and\nI'm sorry I don't have all of the film that I did take. But anyway ....",
        "A: Okay. We came up through the town and, uh, it's on a steep hillside, on the top of a mountain\nand a quarry is, uh, next to 1t which is below them and part of the mountain which the camp\nsets on, if they keep on quarrying there the camp will fall down into the quarry. Uh, as we\napproached it looked like a hugh prison which we have back in the States. And that's exactly\nwhat it was. However, inside the prison walls and in back of them were, uh, compounds\nconsisting of barracks, which held a couple of hundred people and these were in the main\npart of the camp, on the top part and here we saw double electrified fences. Uh, uh, people\nwere by this time sunning themselves, and a lot of people were nude because they had no\nclothes: they had been worn off or torn off by those who were stronger and, uh, people were\nwalking around nude because they didn't have enough clothes at the time. Uh, we had, uh, as\nI said there were other visitors coming. In fact I think the Russians came one of the days and\nthey of course they started then to bring troops in from the Russian front, from the American\nside, (cough) excuse me, and from the German civilians nearby we started to get those\npeople to come up by the truckload and we told them to dress in their Sunday best, and then\nwe made them dig graves, and, uh, we wanted them to see what was going on and then we\nhad them carry the bodies, load the bodies in the wagons. We took wagonload after\nwagonload of bodies out to the grave site, which was the soccer field or the sport, uh, they\ncall it the Sportplatz. And, uh, we made the Germans handle, load them up in the wagons\nfrom inside the camp, take them down to the the, uh, graveyard, the grave site, and unload\nthem, put them down in the graves, side by side, by the hundreds--would be a hundred and\nfifty people or so in a row--and side, practically on top of each other. They were such, they\nwere all skin and bones and it was--I have pictures of them and movies which you'll see\nlater, but the, uh, uh, bodies were so emaciated that that you you couldn't possibly\nunderstand how those people were alive and walking around. And, uh, some of those\nwalking around looked better than the dead, of course, a little better than the dead and some\nof them looked worse, and they're still alive depending on their resistance or whatever--I\ndon't know. But it was incredible that they were still walking in many cases. The walking\ndead we called them at that time.\n9",
        "A: They, they all they just shook their heads. They were crying. They said, No, nein, nein--we\ndidn't know--we knew they were a camp,\" but they didn't realize what was happening to all\nthe people because they had, uh, a quarry with a railroad--they ran, uh, stone out you know\non the train down below. On a lower level there was a railroad track to take the train, uh, the\nquarry stone out to different building projects throughout Austria. Went to the main railroad,\ndown along the Danube. And, uh, they didn't realize that the there would be carloads of, uh,\nuh, clothing going out from all these people, would be going out by the carloads to be\nreprocessed into new blankets and German Army uniforms or whatever, uh, from the people\nwho had died. And they didn't incinerate any of the clothing the clothing because, uh, it was\nbad enough burning up the bodies that they burned, and, uh, the German people were were,\nknew there was a camp. They knew people was going to it but I don't thing they knew how\nbad it was. It's a similar situation in the United States--now we have newspaper reporters that\nget in and we tear our jails apart. We know what's going on because we're an open free\npublic, but under a dictatorship, I believe that most of those people did not know and they\nacted as if they didn't know. And they cried. Of course we did too. I can cry right now\nthinking about how terrible it was and, uh, I had an empathy for them because, uh, I was of\nGerman descent. My parents spoke German and, uh, but however they didn't teach it to me\nbecause it was taboo in World War I and I knew my English and only knew a few words,\nmostly cuss words in German. When my father would get mad, he would say,\n. Uh, that, that's my imperfect German but that's what about the extent of my\nGerman. However I picked it up over there and I was able to interview a couple of the girls. I\npicked on girls because they were pretty as, as you, as I said before; I don't know why but the\nthese girls always did me favors and this one girl said that she had been marched ahead of\nthe German troops from Silesia and coll... and the story confirms what I had said earlier\nabout marching them from the ea..western front towards the center of Germany and from the\neastern front towards the center of Germany, and they had marched all these thousands of\npeople in, uh, to Mauthausen from various camps around the east and west and this one girl\nwas, uh, been marched for about a week she said ahead of the Germans. She says better to\nwith the Germans than the Russians, because they were raping the girls and the women and\nit was pathetic. We had a line of demarcation, the Steyr River; the Russians on one side and\nthe Americans on the other. And it was bedlam over there - screaming and killing and\nshooting and tearing the place apart. They [the Russians] would send the toilets back home\nand the sink...the running water, they, forgetting that they needed running water. And they\nwere just a bunch of wild animals, the Russian soldiers.",
        "A: Yeah. Right.",
        "A: Well, the camp, the doctors started coming in and they had already had, uh, uh, experience\nApril 15th, uh, out in, uh, Dachau. It was one of the biggest ones we overran, which was\naround April 15th. So by the 5th of May when we got there, and a couple of days later when\nthe engineers got there to, to start digging trenches to bury the dead, uh, they were pretty\nmuch, uh, they pretty well knew what they had to do to help these people, so we rushed in\nsupplies and, uh, emergency supplies from, uh, the Army medical, uh, supplies and surplus,\nuh, Army uniforms and, uh, the, uh, various factories and warehouses around that the\nGermans had or the Austrians had were utilized to supply foo. We raided those in other\nwords, and we, the civilian population had, was, had to go without. In fact that winter, the\nfollowing winter, they a lot of them almost starved. Uh, but we were trying to to feed these\npeople. And, uh, our division set up the, uh...and Colonel Seibel was in command, and he\nwas 1n command of CCB at the time as I mentioned earlier. And he directed the, uh, uh ...the\nproceedings, that is, uh, the cleaning up of the camp and the burning of this and burning of\nthat. Some of the clothes and things that we, were burned up and old, uh, latrines--uh, they\nwere filthy. Uh, we tried to get rid of some of the things that were contagious that would\nspread germs and so on. So the people themselves were still dying because they were beyond\nhelp. We got there too late and they died daily, uh, by the hundreds the first few days and\nthen they tapered off and there was a few, maybe a dozen a day, uh, thirty days later. But, uh,\nwe were there for about thirty days, our division, and then the 26th Infantry Division took\nover. In fact, some of those came in early so they could see how we were doing it. Our men\nstood guard to keep the, uh, people under control because some of the, the Russian prisoners\nwere very aggressive anduh....",
        "A: Well, they they wanted to shoot every German that came in the place because they had been,\nuh, put in, incarcerated 1n this camp and they were skin and bones and they, they were ready\nto tear them apart with their bare hands, so we had to have our men walking around with\nguns to keep everything, keep the keep these people from uh killing each other or killing\ntheir former, uh, masters so called.",
        "A: Well, I was, uh, an engineer and and as I said our, my project was to, uh, help bury the dead\nbecause my buddy, Al Salzman, was on a bulldozer and I helped him grease it and maintain\nit and, uh, had opportunity to see quite a lot of the camp. Well, and so did he, and its amazing\nhow, uh, you can forget details. There was so many things going on and if somebody\nprompts you or if you see a picture, they'll bring back a whole story just about a picture. Uh,\na picture can tell a thousand words. Well, I took a lot of movies and maybe they'll be put on\ntape later and that'll explain some of what I'm talking about. But, uh... .",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh I, we went through the, uh, barracks, the different barracks to see how the people were.\nAnd....",
        "A: All right. The barracks were, this was, in the few days that we were there, the first few days\nthat we were there, there were still some dead in the bunks, and we were getting the German\npeople to take them out, and they threw them out like (ph) out in the yards, and they\nwere piled up there. Then from there they took and put them into wagons and took them\ndown to the graveyard. And now in the barracks where the, uh, people, where there were six\nhundred in a barracks, there were two and three people in each bunk. They were so skinny\nfrom malnutrition that, uh, two people could sleep side by side very easily and they, there\nwere so few bunks they had to take turns sleeping. And, uh, uh, I took pictures, movies\ninside the barracks and, uh, I'll never forget these people were so weak that the ones who\nhad, were stronger, would strip the clothes off of the weak ones who couldn't fight back and\nput those clothes on themselves because they were better for instance than their own. None\nof these people were issued clothes. They had uniforms and when the uniforms wore out at\nthis late stage of the war, why they were nude. And there were so many women just lying\nnude in their bunks they and I I felt bad about taking movies of them so I got some of them\nwaving but I didn't make it a point to ... and anyhow I didn't get all those movies home\nanyhow. But I do have some in the barracks. This will explain what I am talking about. It\nwas unbelievable. The barracks, uh, in the barracks the bunks were four to six high and had\nto climb up like monkeys and some of them were too weak to get to their bunks, so they\nsleep on the bottom one and the ones that were stronger would sleep on top. And, uh, that's\nwhere I interviewed the young lady from, uh, Sil... Upper Silesia, and you'd wonder when\nyou see her, uh, why she looked so, uh, well-nourished. It's only because she had of her own\nvia...volition, of her own free will, marched with those prisoners ahead of the Russians to get\naway from the Russians. And, uh, 1t was an anachronism in the middle of all this starving,\nstarv...and starved people and these human skeletons to see someone looking as well as she\ndid. But there were quite a few others that had just been marched in a few days before and\nhadn't had a chance to starve. The way, I hate to even, it, it, it's so silly when you think back\non it, how these people just starved to death. They would give them rations of one piece of\nbread, a crumb of bread for a day, and a lot of times the bread was moldy and we started\nfeeding them with soup and, uh, bread which we made from the flour we got downtown. We\ngot the bakeries going and a little later on we got carpenters in, from the German soldiers,\ncarpenters and plumbers and to get everything back in order because a lot of things were\ndestroyed in the, by the people in fighting and then they destroyed it themselves because\nthey were so sick of the camp--they were trying to knock down wire and everything. It was,\nuh, double electrified fences to keep them in the compounds and, uh, the bodies were just\nthrown outside the barracks into pile, into piles in the streets there. There's no place else to\nbur...there's no place to bury them in the camp, the upper part, until we started digging these\ntrenches. And, uh, let's see....",
        "A: Well, as I said, the people were lining up, uh, uh, to, uh, go to these, uh, soup mill... or\nkitchens or soup pots and what always struck me so odd, the people would be walking\nwithout shirts or without pants on, and they didn't think anything of it; they were so used to\nseeing humans nude most of the time. They stripped them everyday and hosed them down.\nThis is stories that they told us later. But I actually saw and have movies of people walking\naround without clothes on and think nothing of it. The men in particular. Uh, the women\nweren't that, uh, uh, aggressive. In other words they, they were more polite. They tried to\nhide themselves. And the women that were nude in their bunks would put their hands over\ntheir breasts and it was pathetic. Very sad. I'm, I'm glad that it, that it has never been that bad\nsince, uh, that is that we we haven't publicized these things, but what we do know and we\nhope that it never happens again and, uh, if these pictures will help prove a point, I'm sure\nthey won't happen again.",
        "A: Oh yes. It was, as I said, 1t was down, uh, uh, below the camp itself. The camp was on the\nhighest point of the hill. The quarry was, was starting to go into the side of the mountain\ntowards the; ultimately they, as I said earlier, the camp would have fallen in if they quarried\nthat far. But the the staircase, they, they quarried the staircase right out of the stone of the\nmountain and, uh, there were big blocks of stone. It was a typical quarry. They were making\nbuilding blocks for the bridges and the highways and also for stone buildings that they, uh,\nwere putting up here and there. Uh, most of the stones were going for, uh, highways and for\nreinforcing underground bunkers and things like that and the people had to carry stones up\nthe stairs, to the main camp because they built a hugh dividing wall between the quarters of\nthe SS troopers and the, uh, kitchen and the infirmary or the hospital. They built a stone wall\nbetween those and the, uh, barracks where they had the experimental prisoners, where they\nthey inoculated them with all kinds of, uh, germs or they froze them in vats of water and, uh,\nexperimented generally.",
        "A: Well, uh, if you've ever been in an Army camp in the United States, you'll see rows and rows\nof barracks. Well, these were a little closer together. Uh, 1t reminded me of chicken coops on\na big chicken ranch, and, uh, there was about seven rows of them and about ten buildings in\neach row. And there was about two hundred people 1n each one of those barracks. They were\nsmaller than the ones down at the lower side of the camp where, where the quarry prisoners,\nuh, were quartered, and, uh, I don't know uh....",
        "A: Uh, well they were less crowded because, uh, they still had the bunks but they had about\nthree high and they still had about two people in 1n each one, but they weren't, they weren't\nas elaborate, hugh; the buildings weren't as big as the ones in the lower camp, the lower\nsection of the camp. Uh, they were smaller and only about two hundred people in each,\nwhich is almost what we had in our own Army barracks 1n the States. We had about a\nhundred and fifty--well not a hundred and...uh, the bigger ones did but we had about\nseventy-five men and where we had seventy-five men, they had two hundred. That's how\nmuch more crowded the bunks were on top of each other whereas we only had bunks on the\nfloor.",
        "A: Well, it was very much the same as these the ones that we saw ear... earlier who were when\nwe first came in--the ones who were the strongest naturally had the guns and everything.\nAnd but these people that we saw were very weak. They were all starved and all trying to eat\na little soup. Uh, we had already started soup kitchens, the first, first day we got there\npractically. Because the Army, we have so many cooks-- every one, every company has a\ncook--so we didn't eat. We forfeited our food and told our mess sergeants to take it to the\ncamp, which they did for the first couple of days until we got steady stream of supplies\ncoming in.",
        "A: No, I, I, they didn't have them set up. They, uh, these experiments were going on before we\ngot there. This is what these people were telling us. I didn't see any of, of these inno...\ninoculations or bathing in ice water or whatever. It's just, uh, what the people were telling us\nand what the records show now that from all kinds of witnesses and from the German\nrecords and so on. It collor...you know; it confirms the stories that we heard then. Couldn't--\nthey were unbelievable. In fact most of the guys were in a daze--so when they got, they\ncouldn't, they they didn't want to comprehend what they had seen. They wanted to forget it.\nIf you ask any of the fellows about what they saw at this camp, they--1t was terrible. It stunk\nand the smell was awful. As I said, I was brought up on a farm from age 10, and farm smells\ndidn't bother me, uh, even the vilest, and they were vile--you know, these dead people. Some\nof them had been dead for a couple of days or more and then they had dysentery and their\nrectums were all sore and the, the skin was eaten away. These were people that are still alive\nlet alone the dead ones, and they smelled. But I--the, the decaying flesh I was used to\nbecause on a farm we had all sorts of dead animals and it was much the same. To me, I\nwasn't, uh, it didn't bother me. But most of the fellows remember the smell because they\nwere city boys. They had not, uh, been exposed to this type of thing. So and as I said, uh,\nhave thought it since then, we were 1n order and we were used to 1t because we had seen\nthese bodies along the road for a few days before we got to the camp and, uh, we had seen\nthese stripped uniforms and these these human skeletons that, uh, were dead as we went by\nthem, as we went, as we were spear-heading.",
        "A: Well, the the security they had: they had the, they built another stone wall between the\ndouble electrified fence which was the original partition between the, the German officers'\nquarters; they had a double electrified fence with this trench in between with barbed wire on\nthe ground over the trench and, uh, the the security that they had to provide for themselves to\nkeep these people from climbing over the wall to get at them. And, uh, they had machine gun\nnests at every corner of the walls overlooking the compound, and, uh, the other thing I\ncouldn't get over was how the people were all out in the sun trying to sun themselves\nbecause they were confined in the barracks a lot of them and they weren't even out working\nanymore. They were just kept in the barracks and they'd feed them with a few crusts of bread\nand it was a real mess. Everything was smelly. There were no latrine facilities and, uh, they\nwere doing it out in the streets in you know their bowel movements and so on--such as they\nhad, which wasn't very much. And I was a medic and I was amazed at having been in,\nhaving taught first aid before I went in the Army and being a medic at times in the Army on\nmaneuvers, I was a medical aide, corpsman we called them. Uh, I was quite stricken, uh,\nstricken I should say by the fact that the genitals, or genitalia of the men and the women\nwere the last things to apparently go because they looked normal. The women's breasts had\nshrunk quite a bit, but their nipples and, uh, and looked normal. And the men's penises and\ntesticles were about normal. And the rest of them were absolutely bones and, uh, with skin\nstretched over them. And that's the one thing that I'll never forget is, 1s the condition of, of\nthe things that are needed to reproduce life. They're the last things to go, as far as I could see.\nIn other words, Mother Nature was trying to save the reproductive organs. It was the one\nthing that struck me out of looking at all these thousands of dead whenever we buried them.\nAnd as I said, we had these, uh, they couldn't dig the graves fast enough so we got our\nbulldozers to dig the trenches, push the dirt out and then was a, uh, was a token for the\nGermans to get shovels and start to shovel the dirt back into the trenches. Well we'd have\nbeen there for another two weeks burying them if we had to do everything by hand. We did\ndig a few trenches by hand, but we then used the bulldozers because there were so many.\nThey had them stacked up by the hundreds waiting to be buried. They couldn't dig the graves\nfast enough by hand, so that's why we got the German, uh, civilians in there to, uh, handle\nthem. They put them down in the graves and laid them side by side and then they would\nthrow a few shovels of dirt in and I'll never forget as the bulldozer, as Al pushed the, uh,\nstone and sand back into the trenches, you would hear a stone crunching the ribs and the\nbones of the poor bodies down below. It was, because this was backfill for the soccer field\nwas made out of backfill and from the quarry and there were a lot of hard stones\nmixed in and when they pushed the stones in they further crushed the poor things that were\nlaid to rest in that, uh, area. After the war they said that they moved the bodies to the upper\ncamp--see this was down at the lower level, the sports field. Then there was another lower\nlevel down around on the quarry level and, uh, there's now a third graveyard up on the top\nwhere the, uh, the old barracks used to be for the experimental prisoners in the upper part of\nthe camp. The stone wall is gone now that was 1n between, the electrified fences are long\ngone and shortly after we got most of the people into medical tents away from the camp\neven. We moved them out into field hospitals; we burned the buildings down because they\nwere that smelly and filthy from all the you know unclean--there's no place, no la...no\nfacilities for latrines. They had these ditches 1n the streets, and when the rains came, it\nwould wash everything down the hillside. So all that's gone now and it's, it's a graveyard.\nThey said they moved the bodies from that sports field or soccer field but when I went back\nin 1975 the trees had grown over it already in 35 years. I went there 35 years later and, uh,\nthe, it was so changed. It was a big museum now. Where we had seen all these barracks there\nwere only; they left three of, uh, in the first row, I think there were three, no four left which\nwere now made a museum. They showed, they had those on exhibit. But the huge barracks\ndown below--they had six hundred to eight hundred people in them were all gone, used up\nfor other purposes. But we did burn most of the barracks 1n the upper part. We left a few in\nthe front which apparently were the cleanest. And, uh, we went back in 1975 and the\nAustrian civilians had a dinner for us. They provided us with, uh, a chauffeur and a\nlimousine and they, uh, it was unbelievable how they treated us. We were like heroes. And\nthe people, when we went back were hugging us again and trying to touch us and they were\ngrabbing souvenirs and we were giving out little buttons like I have here from my various\noutfits. These are unit insignia. Here's the 41st Cavalry which happens to be the unit that was\nthe first ones in the gate. And this Michael Green who was in the 41st Cavalry is going back\nto Europe this, uh, in 1990 for the 40th Anniversary, 45th Anniversary and, uh, he's bringing\nsome of these along to give to the people for souvenirs. But, uh, we were back again in 1980\nand we're trying to go back every five years, and we meet the people that we released, and\nwe meet their children, and now we're bringing our children and it's a great thing that the\nsurvivors of Mauthausen, and there were around 12,000 alive when we got there. And I\nguess maybe un another couple of hundred died and so there were 11,000 actual people alive\nwhen we got there, but the ones coming back are the families of the victims who died in\nMauthausen. They come back by the thousands. But we were back in 1975 there were\naround 12,000 people there and you wouldn't know how they got there because every road\nwas full of these big, uh, tourists bus that hold fifty people--they were lined up like, uh, cars\naround a football stadium in the States. Incredible where they come from Spain and\nHungary, Hungaria--all the countries of Europe and, uh, we were, as I said, when they found\nout we were the liberators they couldn't do enough for us. They practically tore the, they\nwanted our hats; they wanted, they were going to tear the clothes off us. We were real\ncelebrities. So I felt good about that and I'm; I just felt so sad about all those that were killed,\nover a hundred twenty thousand were killed in that camp. Or more. They're not sure. It's\nbetween a hundred twenty, hundred fifty thousand that they know of.",
        "A: Well, nothing except that it was made so the people couldn't get out, and as I said it looked\nlike a prison when we first observed it, and 1t was more like a prison when you got in it, uh,\nbecause they don't have the double electrified fences. Our prisons have fences, but not\nelectrified, and, uh, the, uh, condition of the people--the human skeletons walking around\nwas another thing that impressed me. As I said the, uh, that anybody could be alive and that\nthin when they looked like bones, their legs, their arms, their feet looked swollen in many\ncases. That was the only thing that looked anywheres near normal was from their ankles\ndown to their insteps. Uh, the rest of the bodies were, uh, skin drawn over their faces as if it\nwere shrunk in the heat or whatever--just unbelievable. And I don't know what else to\nsay...the smells as I said were terrible, but I wasn't too fazed by that for some reason, and I\nthink it was because of my upbringing on a farm.",
        "A: Uh, no, only after the war. Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, as I said, we started to burn some of the buildings and, uh, the, uh, we backfilled the\ntrenches and the latrines and most of the people were gone. The ones who could walk started\nwalking home within a couple of days. And, uh, the ones who were very sick we moved out\ninto field hospitals and, uh, some of those that stayed were trying to help us get the records to\nfind out and to check on how many people were killed and to keep track of everything and\nwe had some of the people working there because they didn't want to go home. A lot of them\nwere Russians and they didn't want to go back to to Russia, so, uh, we tried to keep them, uh,\nworking in the camp and they, because the they said if we go back to Russia it will be the\nend of us. And it was we found out later. They were sent to the salt mines, to Siberia in other\nwords, and, uh, that was something that I didn't think of until just now, but, uh, they were\nglad to be left behind. They didn't want to go back to Russia and we, they, uh, incidentally\nfrom after we let the, as I say, uh, should say, we took the demolitions off the bridge in Linz.\nOur group, our engineers were then sent out into, uh, north of CCB and the camp, and\nthousands, hundreds of thousands of German soldiers and White Russians tried to surrender\nto us. And we accepted their surrender, and, uh, in place, but they wanted to come into\nGermany you know, on our side of the line because they didn't want to be anywheres near\nthe Russians and unfortunately our politicians had said this is the line of demarcation and all\nthose Russians on that side, I mean Germans, will have to go back to the Russians and so a\ncouple of hundred thousand soldiers that surrendered to us were returned to the Germans\n[Russians] and shipped to Siberia. But that was, that was the 6th of May. In fact it was the\nafternoon of the 5th, the 6th and the 7th, and on about the 8th I got to the camp, and I was\nthere on and off for a couple of days, but the main part was when we got the the ditches or\ntrenches dug for the graves. That was my main job there.",
        "A: Oh, we were sent into various little cities in Austria, uh, to maintain order and, uh, make sure\nthere was no looting by the, uh, prisoners who had gotten away from the camp. They were\nall over. They were going to march home, but they wanted clothes. They were either stealing\nit from the Germans or taking it from the Germans, and they were fighting going on and we\nhad to maintain order. It was a real madhouse. And, uh, we were sent to Schwanenstadt. And\nthen from there we were, as engineers, we were sent out to maintain roads and rebuild\nbridges and, uh, electrical plants and, uh, to guard the prisoners in Ebensee, which was a\ncamp--a concentration camp--and it was now full of SS prisoners. And these haughty\nbastards, as we called them, were very independent; and, uh, they...they wouldn't...they didn't\nwant to do anything. They thought they were still lords of the universe, being SS and being\nused to that, uh, having control, uh, full control over civilians and full control over the\nGerman Army. They were the masters of Hitler, they were, uh, Hitler's, uh, supermen. And,\nuh, we now had them crawling because we didn't feed them. They were digging up worms\nand eating worms. They dug up all the grass. It was in May and June that we started putting\nthem in, in late May. And they were digging up the grass. They were eating worms. I mean\nit. And, uh, they were waiting, praying for rain and we had a few days of rain and the worms\nwould come near the top and they would dig them out. And so we started giving them\ncrackers and things, give them a couple of crackers from our K-ration boxes. And we'd get a\nwristwatch which was worth maybe seven or eight dollars, and then we sold them to the\nRussians for over a hundred. And some of the Russians later on were paying five hundred to\na thousand dollars for a Mickey Mouse watch, in particular. And we were getting these\nwatches from the SS men and then selling them to the Russians for souvenirs, because we all\nhad watches. We could get them anytime in the PX for about ten bucks. And here we were\ngetting a hundred dollars to five hundred dollars. And some of the fellows that were able to\ngo to Berlin and trade with the Russians got over a thousand dollars for a wristwatch that we\ngot for a cigarette. The cigarettes were worth money to them. They were like gold. And\nevery soldier had a pack of cigarettes, a carton of cigarettes, a week issued. Whether you\nused them or not, you were entitled to a carton. So a lot of the guys learned how to smoke;\nand I hate to say this, but many of them are dead now because of the lousy habit. And their\nwives always complained, \"Oh, yeah, he's been smoking like this ever since he got out of the\nArmy, and dying of emphysema and lung cancer.\"",
        "A: Okay. There we had double electrified fences for them. We left them in place. And, uh, we\nhad guard towers and machine guns, and that's what we took turns guarding. And I hated\nthat. I was only there a couple days.",
        "A: Well, the, the main barracks were 1n back of it and, uh, I yust stayed, we had guard towers in\na wire enclosure which we had put up in front. It was something new. We had built that.\nAnd I...I'd seen Mauthausen, so I didn't go to look at the quarters there because I figured\nthey're all the same. And we were too busy taunting the SS men.",
        "A: Well, by offering them cigarettes and then crushing them in front of them and then stamping\non them.",
        "A: Well, there was so many of them. And there was really nothing much for them to do. We\nmade them build the fences, yeah, their own \"corrals\" you might call it. Yeah. But we didn't\ntrust them to to do what the ordinary soldiers were doing back in camp, in Mauthausen.\nThere, they were restoring the facilities and cleaning up and they were doing the buggy-\nlugging (ph) when they burnt the camp. And they were burning up anything stuff that was\nNazi that they didn't like--I got a Nazi flag. I said, as I was watching it burn. I said, \"Oh, I'll\ngrab that and see if it's...\u201d And it bur...I guess it's full of holes. I...I don't know. I've never\nunrolled it since I picked it out of the burning pile. And I got it in the car. I was going to\nshow it to you, if you were interested. But that's the only souvenir that I got from the camp.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, as I said, I was only there a couple of days because I hated guard\nduty and, uh, it was just standing there watching these guys do nothing. They'd play cards\nand dig for worms and they didn't have much to do. There was not much of an area to dig for\nworms. In a couple of days the worms were gone. Unbelievable. So they were and they were\nwithout shirts, they were, uh, their uniforms were, uh, either torn off of them or whatever by\nsomebody but a lot of them didn't have any shirts. They had pants and, uh, as I said we\ntaunted them the way they did, uh, the civilians. They would shoot the civilians if they didn't\nfire at us earlier in the war and, uh, many times the people said the SS made them do it,\nwhich was true enough.",
        "A: No. Uh, the camp was, I had been working at Mauthausen and most of those prisoners now\nthe same as in our camp had, uh--well, those who were well were walking home. They\nweren't going to wait for convoys. And the sick ones were already in camps, uh, hospital\ntents with the 26th Infantry Division. See, the 26th Infantry Division later took over\nMauthausen. And, in fact, I think they got the credit for taking Mauthausen. Because by the\ntime the newspapers finally got there, they claimed--the 26th Infantry Division claimed--they\nhad liberated the camp. They did, in a way; but not the way the 11th Armored did.",
        "A: I'd like to bring out a point which I don't see, uh, discussed very often. And that 1s the fact\nthat I personally knew thirteen men that were killed in action, and some right along side of\nme. And, uh, three hundred were killed in the Battle of the Bulge in the first few days of\ncombat. And then ultimately we lost eight hundred men killed, and four thousand wounded\nor injured; and, uh, these were all expended in the effort to save Europe from Hitler's Nazi\nterrorism. And, uh, I'd like to bring that out, that we made a lot of sacrifices and those\nfellows that did it did it for the freedom not only of the United States but of Europe. And it's\na point that is only brought home when you go over and you walk over their graves, which I\ndid. And you think of the 45 years, it was 40 years when I walked on the grave of my best\nfriend, accidentally. I backed up to take a picture of Patton, his monument, which is at the\nhead of the uh \u2014\u2014 Cemetery. And I backed up to get the big cross in and I put my hand\ndown on a tombstone, and as I walked around it I looked and it was August uh Heddenbock\n(ph), my buddy from back home. And I just bawled. And I am sorry. I'm just overwhelmed.\nBut that is what I'm thinking about--how lucky we are, all of us, to be here, to see the tapes,\nto have a free world, and even with the events happening today to see it coming to pass that\nour efforts have not been in vain. And that is the one thing that I would like to emphasize is\nthat we lost a lot of good buddies.",
        "A: Well, I thank you for the opportunity to express these thoughts and, and hope then as I say\nthat it will never happen again. Thank you, Doctor, for interviewing me. I appreciate it.\n"
