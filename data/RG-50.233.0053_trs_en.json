        "Hass, Irving\nRG-50.233*0053\nInterview on March 24, 1992\nTwo Audiocassettes\nDocument contains transcriber notes\nAbstract\nIrving Hass was born on May 18, 1925 in Ruscova, Romania, the oldest child of an observant\nfamily; he had five sisters and a younger brother who died of pneumonia at age nine or ten. His\nfather, who had served in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War 1, was a supervisor for\na lumber manufacturing company; he was away all week, coming home on Fridays. His mother\nraised the children and tended the family\u2019s garden. Irving attended a Romanian public school and\na cheder before the Hungarians came. Early in the war, his uncle in America sent food packages\nto the family. When the Hungarians took over, there was food rationing; there was no public\nschool for the Jews; many men were taken for labor; they had to wear a yellow star. The\nGermans came in with the Hungarians.\nSoon his family, along with the other Jewish families in Ruscova were marched to a ghetto in\nViseu [Note First transcription has this as Wishov. Second transcription notes this as Vitsyuv.\nHowever, Vitsyuv is in the Ukraine and is further from Ruscova than the distance Irving Hass\nindicates. There are many sources that mention Viseu de Sus as having a ghetto.] From there\nthey were loaded into cattle cars and taken to Auschwitz. His five sisters and parents were taken\nto the crematorium, and he was sent to the barracks. One day he jumped out of the barracks and\ngot into a line of people being transferred to Theresienstadt, where he was put to work building a\nhighway. He survived by placing paper under his striped uniform for warmth and stealing raw\npotatoes at night to ease his hunger. From Theresienstadt he was sent to another camp and then\nto Flossenbiirg. As the liberating forces approached, there was a forced march to a forest where\nthe Germans machine-gunned those still alive; Irving was shot and taken to a hospital by an\nAmerican.\nAfter the war he started looking for his family. Emily Post helped him get on the ship The Ernie\nPyle and he arrived in New York on June 20, 1947. After a short stay with HIAS, he was placed\nin the custody of his uncle. In New York, he was given treatment for a nervous stomach\ncondition. He was drafted into the US Army and succeeded in fighting the anti-Semitism of his\nSergeant by \u201cgoing to the top\u201d and informing the Colonel. Mr. Hass studied how to read\nblueprints and tells of his many promotions and transfers during his working years. Mr. Hass\nbelieves that remembering his father\u2019s teachings helped him through the Holocaust and in life.\nTranscript\nTape One, Side A\nHASS, IRVING Intrvw",

He used to work all week and used\nto come home on ... only on Fridays, Saturdays from his work. I went to Hebrew\nschool, which was called cheder, and I went to the regular school. And was a\nquiet town, and we were really happy, like you say, as a family. My father always\nsays ... said to me \u2014 education and to be believing what you heard and done; that\nwill carry you far, and I always believed in my father and mother. And at one day,\nin the early time, we were here in the war zone with Germany. And it was still\nHungarian at one time \u2014 occupied, Hungarian-occupied, our town. And later on\nthen the Romanians came back, and it was going back and forth; I cannot\nremember exactly. The town \u2014 we had two synagogues and about two or ... I\nwould say, 350 Jewish families. And we had our own house, and we lived close to\nthe police department. And then we used to see how time changes, because of this\nwar going on with the Nazis. My father read good German, and he was telling us\nwhat the Germans were doing. And we heard the word, \u201cEisenhower\u201d; and I\nheard about ... talking about Eisenhower and the command and so on.

The company paid all the\ncar expenses \u2014 gas, mileage.\nStay in York, Pennsylvania \u2014 we build a house. A house for $21,000, which sells\nfor $150,000 now; sold that time in \u201864. We ... they ... they moved three\ndivisions, AMF did; Thomas Division, the Engineering Division, and the Buffalo\nDivision. We moved on ... we moved on 550 families. You don\u2019t know what this\ntown became. So much business came in from this move. And I was there \u2014 \u2018til\nall of a sudden they transferred me to a different project. One the government\nphased out ... how you gonna be in [?] the LPG project; which is liquid petroleum\ntanks for rural area homes. You know, they\u2019re making this ... the gas ... enough\nfor gas. And then from York, they transferred me to Des Moines, Iowa. That\u2019s\nwhat I says I wind up in Des Moines. Then I was ... in Des Moines I was made\nassistant to the president, and the guy put me in to write procedures of everything\nunder the sun, you know. And that guy was a... he ... he developed the Head\nSki; and he became from Head Ski. AMF bought Head Ski, and he became vice-\npresident. And then he became ... and he says: Irving I went through your folder,\nI want you to work for me. And you talk about people. He says: J like you. You\ncall a spade a spade; and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. And my office was outside the\nexecutive office, but you could bust a wall and ... and close up the door, you wind\nup 1n the executive office. Bill Songs [sp, ph?], was his name, calls me in and\nsays, Irving, we\u2019re gonna bust a wall, and we\u2019re gonna share the secretary. He\nissues a memo to the vice-president of operation; two weeks go by \u2014 nobody\u2019s\ncarpenters, no come, no nothing. He calls me in, and he says: /rving, [Note there\nis a loud slap] that door is gonna be busted tonight, and I guarantee you. The\nguys didn\u2019t want ... want me because, you know, there\u2019s jealousy in the company\ngoes around.\nHe move me there next to him, and he assign me to the lawn and garden division\nwhich Sears makes mowers. We make them for a private label. You know the ...\nthe smallest would cut grass \u2014 you could see in my garage, I got all this private\nlabel. And I go through the logistics in Sears. And Sears ... they buy a mower \u2014\nsomething is breaking; they send to the factory to get a washer. The washer costs\n50 cents, and Sears sp ... spends $3 ... to ... the paperwork and $4 to ship; they\nlosing money. And I go into this job, and I say: Oh my gosh, look it \u2014 how many\n52",

        "orders are you getting from Sears? The guy says to me: Oh my God, we got 3,000\nthis month. And how much is the total? The 3,000 total about $12,000. I says: You\ncrazy. I go out to Chicago, and I speak to the buyer, and I says: Listen, I\u2019m gonna\nmake an analysis and see what\u2019s going on. In the meantime, I had a good fellow\nworking for me, and I says: Eph [sp, ph?] Jones ... Eph ... you\u2019re gonna come\nwith me to Chicago, and we\u2019re gonna take all the data down. I told Sears that you\nguys are losing money; they ... they pull their hair out. I prove it to them on\ncharts. So here we get away with shipping no more from the factory. Sears had to\nship it to a Philadelphia warehouse, and the warehouse is dealing with the ... with\nthe store. We were dealing with stores, you know, with ... with the customer; and\nI made a change on that.\nAnother change come in. The ... the boss got promoted; He takes overa... a\nbicycle division in Little Rock, Arkansas and a division in California. And comes\nin; he says: Irving, you\u2019re going to Arkansas. To Arkansas? Not me! And I tell\nyou, that\u2019s where I wind up with my life in there. In all the time in my life, when\nmy daughter used to see this, and I used to tell her: Go to the top, learn \u2014\nimportant things. And that\u2019s why I always with the supervisors \u2014 never. And I...\nI .... People know where you stay. We had in New York, a lieutenant general was\n... which is ... was the Chairman of the Board\u2019s buddy; he gave him a job. He\nwants to fish out who is a supervisor, who\u2019s not a supervisor. Fishing out, you\nknow \u2014 wants to know if he have the brains to be a supervisor. In one brain, he\ndid, he came in nine o\u2019clock with a package. He says to me: Your work are\nneeded immediately. Nine-thirty he cames with another package. J need this in 30\nminutes. Ten-thirty he cames in with another package; and here I got two\npackages I couldn\u2019t say. I look at one package, he says with credit \u2014 no. I look\nfor another package \u2014 1s it a question some manual data \u2014 no. The third package\nhas to do, if I furnish this information, we will furnish you an order, you know, of\nso and so. I took the order package first \u2014 he gave me the last \u2014 to do the job. I\nfinished it, he calls me in. He says: You seem, Hass, to me the general [\u2019]. I gave\nthis package, was to nine people. Everybody still working on package one. You\ngot package three, which one I needed. Why ... why did I get package three? |\nsays: It\u2019s more important because there ... there\u2019s gonna be an order from it.\nPackage ... the first is on credit, you know the guy\u2019s waited so long for credit; he\nwait another ten days, it\u2019s not gonna hurt. And that\u2019s why the guy wanted to fish\nout; if you have authority. Then I used to go to seminars. At seminars, the guy\nwas teaching the same thing. A-B-C he says, assert yourself management\nseminars. He says assert yourself everything, A-B-C.\nInterviewer: So this 1s the kind of thinking ...\n53",
