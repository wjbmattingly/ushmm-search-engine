        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you please tell me something about this 13 years old girl before the war, please.",
        "A: Well, I was very lucky to be born in a wonderful family, in a wealthy family. I had really a\nwonderful childhood, except maybe that my parents get divorced in \u201938, which was, of course, a\nvery big shock to me. My father left Lithuania, remarried later on, and I stayed with my mother\nin Kaunas. I -- I was probably a quite good pupil. My father sent me to a Yiddish school Shalom\nAleichem gymnasium, which was famous. They had very good teachers, and it was a left wing\nschool, I would say, which was shaped by Yiddishes -- by the Yiddishists and not by sci --\nZionists. And the people --",

        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Mis -- yeah, but my -- my parents were already out of the shtetl, they were European educated\npeople. My mother finished [indecipherable] schule in Berlin. My father got his education in\nHamburg, and th -- and so they were not religious, but were very tolerant. My grandparents -- I\nhad -- had only my grandparent -- parents from my mother\u2019s side, so they were quite m -- they\ncame out of Bapte my father was a milkman, like Tevya from Shalom Aleichem. Was really a\nwonderful, wonderful man. I think he influenced the whole family a lot, with his very open-\nminded and -- views and with his goodness.",
        "Q: Excuse me, I must ask you for --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Can you take off this -- because it makes sounds on the tape will you, and -- thank you. Sorry\nfor interrupting you.",
        "A: Yeah, okay. And -- and I was educated respecting them very much and very much respecting\ntheir belief, and I would go every Friday for kiddush, to -- to meet Saturday and I was attending\nthere all day, of course holidays and Rosh Hashanah and -- and especially Easter, where I played\na big role under the table, looking for [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You say their holidays.",
        "A: Not -- not holidays, but how is it in English, [indecipherable]. It is like -- no --",
        "Q: Yes, I understand.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But you say their.",
        "A: I was with my par -- when I -- with my grandparents always there.",
        "Q: Their holidays, their --",
        "A: Their Jewish holidays.",
        "Q: Their Jewish holidays. Back then you felt it\u2019s theirs and not yours?",
        "A: Because in our house we didn\u2019t celebrate it, we especially. So I felt it more tha -- as the -- a-as\nthe tradition of my grandparents, which was very nice and respected. But I had also in my\nchildhood a Christmas tree.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Because ma -- not because it was for relig -- religious purposes, that my parents was -- were\nsaying that you can take from other people the best they have, and they wouldn\u2019t like me to be\nenvious of other children who have this tree and get their different presents. So I had also a\nChristmas tree and our home was very international. We had very many guests, Lithuanians and\nRussians and -- from all over the world, friends who would come and visit us. So my parents\nspoke already -- except English probably, all European languages, French, German, Polish,\nRussian. So -- no, my -- my parents told me that you have always to speak the language that\neverybody understands, if you can. So I was multilingual from childhood. I was speaking from\nmy -- my native languages were two, Lithuanian, and Russian, I spoke from childhood. And then\nwhen I was five years old I had something with my lungs and I was sent to S-Switzerland, to\nArosa in a sanitorium, where I stayed for almost a year, and then I forgot all languages. I came\nback not speaking Lithuanian and not speaking Russian, but speaking only German. And I\nremember that I went with my parents to Moscow, my father had his family there and m-my\nuncle made me a present, such a sewing machine, a children\u2019s sewing machine. And it 1s in\nRussian shvaina mashina. So I was told that -- that -- then the joke was that I answered the\n[speaks Russian here], I don\u2019t want a big mach-machine, yeah. So this only proves that I really\ndidn\u2019t speak any more Russian, but of course the languages came back very fast. And when I\nwas sent to the Shalom Aleichem gymnasium, to the yeshida school, I didn\u2019t speak Yiddish, but I\nlearned it quite fast. And I -- but the -- the beginning was not so good because I didn\u2019t speak so\nwell Yiddish, so my classmates would call me the intelligentka. So --",
        "Q: This is also a question I wanted to ask you about.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: On one hand you described a very cosmopolitan house.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And on the other hand you are sent to a Yiddish --",

        "Q: -- school.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t you feel any contradiction?",
        "A: No, I didn't feel because I mentioned already that it was a left wing school, really a very good\nschool. I remember my -- my -- my teachers, most of the teachers with great respect. And my -- I\nmust say that, for instance, my Lithuanian, I am really literate in Lithuanian. I write in\nLithuanian well, and I learned -- I spoke from childhood, but I learned really the language and\nthe writing in this Jewish school. Bu -- and my -- my teacher was [indecipherable]. She perished\nin the Holocaust, and she came from a Lithuanian province and she was -- she finished the\nuniversity, Lithuanian language and literature, and she was really a wonderful teacher.",

        "Q: -- you said -- you use an expression that I would like --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- if you allow me, to check with you. You said about your teacher that she perished in the\nHolocaust. You -- you mean she was murdered in the Holocaust?",
        "A: Murdered, yeah, murdered. Sorry, my English is maybe not so [indecipherable]",
        "Q: No, no, no, because -- because -- it\u2019s not your English, because many people don\u2019t use the\nterm murder, and they, like --",
        "A: No, she was killed. She was killed in the Holocaust, yeah.",
        "Q: She was wo -- yes.",
        "A: And but she was -- in the school she was an exception, because she was a Zionist. But\nbecause she was a very good teacher, she was kept in the school. And my father had also\nillusions, left winged illusions. He was a rich man in Kaunas and he had his own house, he has\nhis own business. But he was -- he was dreaming about social justice, and as you know, in the\n30\u2019s, many European, not only Lithuanian intellectuals, had this illusion that the Soviet Union is\nmaybe the solution. And maybe they are giving equal rights to everybody. So he insisted that a --\nI go to this school. All my cousins went to Lithuanian school.",
        "Q: So your father was a leftist bourgeois?",
        "A: He was a salon communist, I would say. Not a communist, but a left wing salon. He was\nhelping people who were in trouble. He was paying, I think, money for Mopar -- for the -- this\nwas an organization who has collected money for the political prisoners in -- in those times. And\nin the main time he was -- he was quite a rich man, and he never came to the -- to live in the\nSoviet Union. So -- and th --",
        "Q: What -- what -- what were he doing --",
        "A: -- and his -- his -- his family -- you know, my father was sent to be educated in Hamburg,\nbecause my grandfather, who was a merchant of the second gildia -- I know that\u2019s a quite high\nlevel, he was quite [indecipherable] man. He was -- he had his business in Garganas, it\u2019s was --\nit\u2019s not far, now it\u2019s Byelorussia. And all his chil -- sons became revolutionaries, so he got sick\nof it, fed up with it and he decided, the youngest son, to send to -- to study in Germany, that he\nshouldn\u2019t become a revolutionary. But my -- they were really -- you -- you should very much\ndistinguish the revolutionaries of those times with the Stalin times, because they were -- they\nreally thought it was an utopias, you know, and an utopia, that\u2019s socialism, and communism will\nbring social justice, equality and so on. And it ended that one brother of my father was arrested\nin \u00b037 and killed by Stalin. A-And -- because he was a too honest man, he was a quite known\nperson. He was the director of [speaks Lithuanian here] this is fiction literature, it\u2019s a big, big\npublishing house. And he was also then later on the director of the medicine -- is that me-medical\npublishing house. Well, he was accused so, and he was killed. He was arrested in ?37. And my\nother uncle who was a professor, he never joined the party again after the Bolsheviks came to\npower because he saw what happened in the Crimea. He spend the time of the civil war in\nCrimea and he saw what the -- really the Bolsheviks are like, and he never joined the party. He\nhad his own story, which I don\u2019t know if we have time to tell you now, but very interesting, that\nhe never told me, really, the truth he knew.",
        "Q: About the Bolsheviks?",
        "A: When I came -- yeah, when I came, because everybody was afraid then. And only when he\nwas already quite -- qui -- after -- after Khrushchev\u2019s letter, this -- in -- on the -- in \u201956, when\nStalin was really -- it was opened up what he did, he told me that he knew it all, because he also\nknew -- he was a friend of Krupska, Lenin\u2019s wife, who was also persecuted by Stalin and the\nwhole -- all -- all -- this whole regime on -- and the -- the -- what -- what happened in \u201937, he had\nno illusions. But of course he -- but then he told me really true story.",
        "Q: After. Many years later.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So your father was sent to Germany --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- to study, and he came back to Lithuania.",
        "A: And then th-the -- the first World War started, because he was born in 1900. So when the first\nWorld War started, and you know that Lithuania was under the Tsarist regime, so he was a rush -\n-ar--acitizen of Russia. So he went back with lot -- with lot of adventures, and he was even\narrested by the Bolsheviks as a German spy. And just by miracle he -- his life was saved and he\ncame back to Kaunas and his father was already in Kaunas. He was the owner of [speaks\nLithuanian here], it was a lottery. And because he was the only one not in Russian, not in the\nSoviet Union, so he inherited his business, and it was the stu -- h-he was the owner of [speaks\nLithuanian here].

        "A: No, I felt that I am -- I am a Lithuanian Jew. This I felt, of course. I -- this -- I was -- I was,\nyou know, educated in our school, very patriotic, because we were studying history. I don\u2019t\nknow if you heard, there was such a -- a textbook shap -written by a Lithuanian historian,\nShapulka, who really mythologized the Lithuanian history. And his book had the -- probably the\ntask to unite a nation, because I don\u2019t know if you know Lithuanian history, but Lithuania was --\nthe history is quite painful, because you know that the Polish influence, the Russian influence,\nand -- and the Lithuanian speaker were mainly peasants. So it was very important to unite a\nnation and to give them a mythology that -- to be proud. And then it came to idealize the past,\nour -- our great --",

        "A: -- no way. And we were very much, you know, indoctrinated against the Sinai schools, the\nHebrew schools.

        "Q: To be honest, I didn\u2019t feel, no. I didn\u2019t feel. I-I had -- my school friends were Jewish, but I\nhad also -- we had a lot around. I hadn\u2019t -- I -- probably I didn't have very close friends of my\nage of Lithuanian ethnic origin. But I really didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t feel -- but what I really felt is a\nterrible fear because of war, because the adults were speaking all the time about war, about\nHitler, about what is happening. And I had even such a terrible dream, you know, I don\u2019t\nremember so many dreams, but this is one of the dreams I remember very well. I was a little girl\nand somehow I found myself in a camp where Hitler was. And I was taken to his -- to his tent\nand he was ca -- somehow very kind, he -- he told me that I should sit on his knees and say him\nPoppy. This is father. And I couldn\u2019t say it. And this was terrible for me and then I woke up.",

Then I remember very well, when the war with Poland started, how\nPolish refugees came to Vilnius -- to Kaunas and I know that my parents helped them.

But in \u201938 he took me, and I spent two months\nwith him and we were in Switzerland, in Belgium, in France and in Berlin. Mm -- and I got my\nwonderful bicycle, which was very famous in -- in Kaunas. Probably one of the first bicycles\nwith gears, you know.",
        "Q: \u00b038 in Berlin.",
        "A: 38 I was in Berlin, yeah.",
        "Q: How was it?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: How was it?",
        "A: This is what I wanted to tell you, that 1t was wonderful because I -- we were Lithuanian\ncitizens and we were not -- we w -- were not under the Hitler\u2019s law, and we got even -- but my\nfather told me when we -- we lived on kuf -- Kurftirstendamm and we got for breakfast, for\ninstance, a -- a little britchen, a -- a -- no, a piece of white bread with butter, with -- or margarine\nand marmalade and my father told me that the Germans don\u2019t receive it, and the Jews definitely\nnot, because it is very hard now and they are preparing a war. And then my pa -- father took me\nto the street Unter den Linden which was the main street on the Brandenburger Tor, and -- and\nth-there were -- there were normal benches. I think they were white, but I don\u2019t remember, but I\nremember the yellow benches. And my father told me that you are not obliged to sit on the\nyellow bench because you are not a German citizen. But you are Jewish and this is benches\nwhere Jews are sitting. They are excluded, they are discriminated, and I want you to get the\nfeeling how it is like to sit on such a bench. So we were sitting, I remember it very well. And can\nyou imagine that in 2004, when we joined European Union, I was speaking at the Brandenburger\nTor, to the crowds because when the enlargement of the European Union happened, I was\nspeaking in the name of representing my country, Lithuania, and -- and I -- I -- I finished my\nspeech with a personal remark, that you see how time changed? I\u2019m speaking from the place,\nbehind is the Reichstag, where I was doomed to die, to be killed, and now I am representing and\ntalking to you, representing the country. It also proves -- it\u2019s a si -- symbolic, for me very\nimportant proofs how times have changed. It was a -- a -- I must say it was a big moment in my\nlife, it was successful, my speech, so I was very happy. But, of course you feel -- the first time\nwhen I was in Berlin after the war I feel very stel -- felt very strange, staying at the Reichstag.",
        "Q: So you wa -- went for two months vacation to Europe --",

        "A: They came to our house, to my mother\u2019s house. I know even -- I can even show you now, I\nhave a little silver such plate which my mother bought from -- from a refugee, to help them also.\nAnd I know that my mother -- my mother was involved in -- in helping them. But I don\u2019t know\ndetails, but I know that they were around.",
        "Q: And did you hear what they were telling?",
        "A: Yes, yes of course. I was very curious. I was called in the family alticope, and -- and th-the --\nit means that I am a old cop -- a old head, because I was always interested and I was such like\nresponsible person. And so I was interested and I heard it, yes.",
        "Q: And what do you remember ma -- made impression on you of what they were telling?",
        "A: It made a terrible impression. It -- 1t raised my fear.",
        "Q: What were they telling?",
        "A: The people had to leave their homes, everything and -- and just became refugees and got\nstuck. And I didn\u2019t know, but later on I learned that they -- many -- very many of them got stuck\nin Lithuania and of course they were killed made -- mainly. And -- in the Holocaust, but some of\nthem were saved by Sugihara, and the hol -- the Dutch also, cons -- council -- c-con -- consul.\nAmbassador.",
        "Q: So, at the certain moment you feel that -- y-you are afraid be -- the adults are talking about the\nwar.",
        "A: Yeah. I was very afraid. It was really a nightmare, this -- it was like, you know, like hanging\nover -- over the heads.",
        "Q: You were talking with this -- ab-about it with your mother?",
        "A: Yes, of course.",
        "Q: What did she say about it?",
        "A: Well, she\u2019s -- she tried to -- to comfort me, but I don\u2019t remember exactly, you know. I\nremember many conversations with my mother, but I don\u2019t remember exactly what we were\nspeaking. But I know the only one thing, that my mother wanted to leave Kaunas. And she asked\nmy father to pay her the alimentay -- I don\u2019t know, the money he has to pay her after the divorce,\nin currency that she could leave the country. But it was maybe not only of -- out of fear, but also\nthose times very few people were divorced. And my mother was a quite -- my father was q -- my\nfamily was a quite known family. So I think she didn\u2019t feel very well, in this little town, you\nknow, where everybody was talking about the divorce and -- and she was somehow -- maybe she\nfelt humiliated. And she was in Sweden and a German refugee who got a affidavit to go to\nAmerica wanted to marry my mother and take her -- take her out. And because it was already\nvery tense, I can imagine what the adults were -- were already talking about this -- those times,\nmy mother decided that she is not coming back, but I should go to Stockholm. And a ticket, air\nticket was bought, and we had a very good friend, Monsieur Dumaniel who was a -- a -- mm -- a\ncons -- con -- consul -- a ambassador of France and Lithuania and then he was transferred to\nHelsinki, but he stayed friends with my mother. My mother was beloved by everybody, really.\nShe had lots -- many, many friends, was -- and I sh -- I had to go to Helsinki and then he would\ntake me to Stockholm and then we would go to America. And I was -- that was the first of\nSeptember, and my uncle brought me to the -- to the airport [indecipherable] in Kaunas and I was\nwaiting for the airplane to came. And I went through customs. I remember like today I had talc\npowder, how the customer took a knife and -- and cut this little box to see if I have in gold there\nor something else. And -- and I was waiting, but the airplane never came, because it\u2019s the first\nday of war, and the airplane was supposed to come from Warsaw. So -- so I got back and when --\nand then my mother came also back. And this was fatal.",
        "Q: And then the war started in Poland.",
        "A: No, the war -- the -- the -- yeah, it was the first of September \u00b039.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So, my mother wanted to leave, and probably she had also reason to leave because we all felt\nthat we are trapped. We -- my mother didn\u2019t -- my mother was much less left winged than my\nfather.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But -- but -- but didn\u2019t work out.",
        "Q: And you stayed in Kaunas.",
        "A: I stayed in Kaunas and my mother came back.",
        "Q: And then the Russians came?",
        "A: Then the Russians came. The Soviets.",
        "Q: Soviets.",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t -- I try not to use the word Germans or Russians. I think that any nation 1s\na nation [indecipherable] to be respected, but I say Nazis and Soviets, because not all the\nRussians were Soviets and not all the Germans were Nazis.",
        "Q: So the Soviets came?",
        "A: Yeah, the Soviets came. The Soviet Russians came. I know it is [indecipherable] -- it 1s stupid\nbecause nobody is following me, but -- but still I feel better when I do [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Personally I agree with you about the Soviets --",
        "A: Mm, yeah.",
        "Q: -- not about the Germans, but this is another --",
        "A: I agree with Germans. I have seen wonderful Germans, and if we have time, I can tell you as -\n- wonderful stories about wonderful Germans.",
        "Q: Yes, th-the problem is that when you say Nazis, you detach it from the origin, and th-this is\nthe problem, were they -- they were from Indonesia, the Nazis?",
        "A: No, they\u2019re German Nazis, you can say German Nazis --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- if you -- if you want to be very precise, yes.",
        "Q: Okay, yes. So, how did life change when the Soviets came?",
        "A: Oh, life changed a lot. First of all we were thrown out from our flat, and we had to share a flat\nwith another family. We had two rooms and the other family had one room. And we had to share\nthe kitchen, which was very unusual for us, of course. My mother didn\u2019t work and this was good,\nmaybe. She went to work. She was educated, she -- she was quite capable woman and she\nworked in the narcomat of trade. So she started to work. And -- and immediately rumors went\non, and th-th-this person 1s arrested, th-that person is arrested. Life changed. But still I was at\nschool. I believe that maybe this is for justice. That -- that still maybe I\u2019d -- I was not so m-\nmature in my political views as I-I was later, but -- but still I m -- I was not -- I personally -- it\naffected very much the life of the adults, but not so much maybe my own life, because I went to\nschool, I fought with the Zionists there, I don\u2019t know. And so, it [indecipherable] stupid, but it\nwas. I was never religious so I never experienced luck of -- of the possibility to -- to practice\nreligion. I also -- can you imagine that about the religious schools, the famous Lithuania, I got to\nknow only probably in the -- after our independence, when I was sent -- I wa -- I got a fellowship\nin Oxford, and I was in [indecipherable] and I learned really what Lithuania means for Jewish\nculture and religious culture and so on. Because we were very far aw-away from this yeshiva --\nyeshi botnikas and the [indecipherable] and all that. And the school was also not closed to\nreligion. So --",
        "Q: During the Soviet time, did you have any contacts with your father?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] And still there was the fear of the war, or the war was already here?",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t say that it -- the war was already here. The war started on the 22\" of June, \u201941.\nBut there was already a lot of things happening. Don\u2019t forget that in those times parents were\neven afraid to talk to children openly, because the children could say something at school and\nthen you will be arrested. So there was no such open communication with the parents on all\ntopics. And I wouldn\u2019t say that I heard a lot, but I know for instance, when deportations started,\nmy mother was very, very upset and she -- she was -- she was helping people, her -- Lithuanian\npeople who were also Jewish people, but also Lithuanians. She worked with, and -- as much as\nshe could -- as she knew. And she was very, very, very unhappy about what happened. And I\nremember also my mother, on the 15\" of June \u201940, when the tanks came in. And this -- I\nremember my mother sitting so, at the table. And she was very upset that some Jewish people\nwent out in the streets to greet the Soviet army, the Soviet tanks. And 1-it was even, I must say\nfor -- for historical truth, that my mother called them interveldnikas, who went out in the street,\nbecause it was not loyal, it was --",
        "Q: Interveld is a si --",
        "A: No, they\u2019re -- you know.",
        "Q: -- low.",
        "A: Yeah. The -- the people who are the lowest.",
        "Q: Low grade.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes, okay. Did you see them? Those Jews who went out and th -- you didn\u2019t --",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: -- you didn\u2019t go there.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t go there, no. But you see, this is a very complicated question, this Jewish and\nLithuanian reaction to those times, because it was quite clear after, that we are trapped between\ntwo super powers. And it is also absolutely obvious, and it couldn\u2019t be different, that for\nLithuanians, maybe still the ger -- e-e-especially after the deportation, that for the Lithuanians\nstill, the Germans are better, and for the Jews are still the Soviets better. And I learned now\nrecently, I was calling our institute of resistance on genocide, and I ask them how many people\nwere deported, and how many people came back from Siberia. So I was told that in \u201941, the last\ninformation is 17,000. After the war it was hundred -- about 130,000. So -- including the Jews,\nwho were also deported. So, as a whole, about 150,000. Now, from the people who were\ndeported in 1941, only about 20 percent came back, but from the people -- but these are so not\nvery precise figures. And fa -- from the people who were deported in -- after the war, until \u201951 or\n\u201950 -- I don\u2019t know how long, think un-until \u201951, or maybe *53, I don\u2019t remember now exactly,\nthe deportation -- 70 percent came back. From the Holocaust very few people came back, so it\nwas still even better in -- in the -- for -- for Jews it\u2019s a paradox, but in some way they were saved.\nAnd for instance our -- such a Jewish writer, Josade, he saved his parents from deportation and\nhe could -- he suffered his whole life. Actually, you made a film about him, he suffered his\nwhole life, that he really killed his parents because he saved them from the Soviet deportation.\nThey got killed in -- in the Holocaust. So it 1s -- yeah. But, also among the Lithuanian, I would\nsay, intellige -- intelligentsia, among the loudeninke, this was the m-m -- the Volksparte1, the --\nno, they were not socialists, but close to socialists. So they were thinking, what\u2019s better, the\nGermans or the Soviets? And they decided better the Soviets. Why? Because under Germany,\nunder the German governance, for instance, Prussia disappeared. No -- no -- no traces of Prussia\nany more. And under the Tsarist time, which was 200 years, we not only didn\u2019t disappear, but we\ndeveloped our, in Lithuania, the resistance movement. The -- the -- re-revival of the nation. So,\nthat e -- we will -- we will be able to resist the Russian -- the Russian -- the -- the Soviet, and\nbetter not to deal with the -- with the Germans. Then also, some people, they\u2019re fascinated, like\nfor instance, Paletskis, or -- or Vanslovar, or Kemontite or Gregorouskas, or other people, they\nwere fascinated by the official [indecipherable], and they thought that even if we join the Soviet\nUnion, we will still stay a Lithuanian republic, and we will have our national culture and rights.\nSo it was, you know -- but after the deportations, then of course, the -- the Wehrmacht, the\nGerman army was met by Lithuanians with flowers. So -- but that\u2019s also understandable, because\nit was like saving from the deportation to Siberia. Was a very complicated situation, and is very\ninteresting that in Poland -- you know the story with the [indecipherable] where Poles killed, not\n-- not -- not Nazis, but Poles killed. So it is also in the region where the Soviets were before,\nwhere the deportations took place, and so on, you see? Then there is also another such moment,\nwhich can\u2019t be forgotten. Of course in -- in -- in Lithuania, the Jews had cultural autonomy and --\nautonomy and so on, but it was not such an absolutely equal situation for everybody. Jews\ncouldn\u2019t take government positions, high up positions in the army. They served in the army, but\nnot on high -- or very few of them became officers and so on. And they didn\u2019t feel like equal\ncitizens of Lithuania, but the in -- the independence times was only 20 years, that\u2019s a very short\ntime. And when the Soviets came, so they declared that everybody\u2019s equal, and quite a few Jews\ngot into the administration, got into, you know, official positions. I -- I -- sorry -- and -- and it\nwas like an illusion that now we are equal. But this was absolutely illusion. And i -- and I must\nsay ma -- but I came now -- come now a little bit back, my uncle, the brother of my mother,\nJorge Stromas is -- was a very, very educated person, he got his education in France and he came\nback and he had an official position in the -- in -- in the Ministry of Finance, and was very, of\ncourse, helpful, but then he had to leave it, because he was Jewish. So, you see, he was still a -- a\nvery much -- he was a [indecipherable] because he lacked very much the language and so on. But\n-- but still, he was not completely equal, even such a person as he, who was a -- so, it was very\ncomplicated. I don\u2019t know if I expressed myself clearly now.",
        "Q: You did.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You did. Certainly you did. So, did you feel that the war is almost s-starting at a certa --\ncertain point?",
        "A: The -- th-the danger, the feeling of danger was present all the time, and of course everybody\nwas shocked with the Soviet German pact, with the Nazi pa -- you know -- not --",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And in -- in the Soviet Union people who would say something against Hitler were arrested,\nyou know. So it was a quite -- quite confusing situation. But of course, you know, people are\noptimistic and -- and still the war came unexpected, the bombing.",
        "Q: It came unexpected for you?",
        "A: F-For me, of course.",
        "Q: For you of -- how did it start?",
        "A: I was at home. My mother was operated in -- in the hospital Raudonas Kryzius, the Red\nCross, by Professor Kanauka. She had the very, very serious operation which -- which ended\nvery well, and she will be okay, but -- on the 16\" of June. So she was in hospital and I was at\nhome. It was not very far, we lived not very far away from the hospital. And suddenly I woke up\nand I hear some, you know, like thunder. I didn't understand what\u2019s happening. And then I don\u2019t\nremember who told me that it\u2019s the -- the war. I was -- I -- I don\u2019t remember who told me, but I\nknow that quite a long time we didn\u2019t -- no, hours, it\u2019s not days, but hours, and then I think\nMolotov made the speech that the war is started. And then I was -- I was go -- going to my\nmother --",

And I tried to make myself useful and to help, because there were\nimmediately wounded injured people coming in. And -- and I stayed with my mother there, I\nhelped a little bit the nurses there, too. And then on Monday it was already clear that -- that the\nSoviets are withdrawing, are leaving.

        "Q: From the hospital?",
        "A: From the hospital. But Professor Kanauka was so n-nice and he said that now she is a patient,\nso she belongs to me and you can\u2019t take her, because she can\u2019t even walk. But -- and she was\nkept in the hospital until Sunday. But, under the supervision of a BaltaraiStininkas. And of course\nI had to leave. And he told me only that I should bring clothes for my mother.",

        "A: This -- the BaltaraiStininkas, yeah.",
        "Q: There was a partisan who was left in the hospital?",
        "A: Yeah, with a gun. Yeah, was left at the hospital to watch my mother.",
        "Q: To watch your mother.",
        "A: Yeah. And then m -- I left, and I -- on Friday I came back and I brought her clothes and she\nwas already sitting at the window, and the BaltaraiStininkas was probably flirting with the nurses,\nI don\u2019t know, maybe, but he wasn\u2019t there, so I could get in. And this was my last time I saw my\nmother, and she was 35 years old. And we had the last talk, and I remember that my mother gave\nme some, like, three commandments. And I can -- until now I can\u2019t believe what kind of\npersonality she was that she could speak about such things in such circumstances. Of course, she\nhad the hope that it is a mistake and --- and that everything will be okay. But she told me that --\ntry always to live according to your possibilities. Don\u2019t ask for more. Be s -- be independent and\nself-sufficient. And she also meant that if I need now money I can sell something of her jewelry\nor something of our belongings that I shouldn\u2019t go and ask grandparents, or aunts or uncles or\nsomebody else for help. Then the second commandment was I should always live with truth,\nbecause a lie doesn\u2019t help. And the third, which is maybe the dearest to me and probably saved\nme in some way, I should never take revenge. So -- and she of course told me where to go and\nmaybe to look for help, that she should be released. So I left her, and of course I started to -- to\ntry to -- to liberate her.",
        "Q: Ho-How did you interpret the situation that your mother is giving you this kind of advice,\nthese commands, this --",
        "A: I am until now interpreting it. I think she was just a wonderful person and she believed in\nsome very important common values she wanted me to follow.",
        "Q: But at this moment --",
        "A: At this moment why she -- because this was very important for her.",
        "Q: But for you, you weren't surprised that suddenly she 1s giving you --",
        "A: No, I was not surprised, I was -- I had -- I was surprised later on, and then I was just listening\nand remembering, and I was 13 years old. It was such a situation, you can\u2019t imagine. I was -- I\nwas not reflecting then, I was only thinking what to do, how to save my mother. So -- and -- and\nI went to -- to such a person, Skuropskas is his name, he was working, he was a tow toninkas, he\nbelonged to the national party and my mother helped him to escape the -- to save him from\ndeportation, because in some way she -- she told him that he\u2019s in danger. And -- and when I\ncame, he was already the -- the minister and the -- he was sitting in the -- ond -- in the place\nwhere the [indecipherable] was sitting. And -- and he told me -- I's -- told him that my mother is\narrested, could he help? He knows her, he knows that she was not NK VD and she was nothing.\nShe was even not a party member, nothing. So he said there were hidden and there were open\ncommunists and NK VDist. So he didn\u2019t help at all. He had already high position, but it didn\u2019t\nlast for long. And then I went to Pulkininkas Bobelis who was a neighbor of ours. We lived\ntogether before we -- we -- m-my father built his own house of Laisves Aleja, at the beginning of\nLaisves Aleja. It was I think first, or number one, and -- house, and the house is still there. And\nhe was a very, very polite and very charming Colonel Bobelis, and he came to s -- play cards\nwith my mother and I was friendly with his daughter Laimuta, who was my age. The -- she had\ntwo brothers, Kazys Bobelis and they are -- ah, no, sh-she had two brothers, Jurgis\n[indecipherable] is why, the sons of Bobelis. But they were older and they were already very\nactive in this movement of liberation, and Bobelis became the commandant of Kaunas. And I\nmust say I had a very bad experience with him. I went to his house and he promised to help and\nasked me that -- he said -- told me that I have to bribe -- he has to bribe people so I should bring\nsome -- some -- some --",

        "A: I was running away and of course my grandparents didn\u2019t allowed me any more to go to him.\nBut I must also say that I learned from Sara Ganita that he helped her family, Bobelis, and I also\n-- he released my aunt, the wife of stro -- o-of Jorge Stromas, who got arrested. And when he got\nto know that she is there, he told to let her out. So -- but my experience with him was really not\nvery good. And -- and it\u2019s painful for me, of course. So I couldn\u2019t help my mother, and I was --\nshe was taken on Sunday to the pri -- to prison on Mizkavajoes, to the main prison.",
        "Q: How -- when did you know this? When did you learn about it?",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell you exactly when I learned it. I was looking for her, but I got to know that she is\nthere and that she is there with -- sitting with such communist -- Lithuanian communist Bud-\nBudinskinada, I think her -- her name was. And -- and I gave her -- I brought her something to\neat and I got her signature.",
        "Q: How did you bring her --",
        "A: And -- I was queuing in line, in -- and they were taking packages for -- for prisoners, so I -- I\nonce brought, and the second time when they came, it was I think, middle of July, I was told -- or\nmaybe even earlier, it was told -- I was told that she is not any more there. And then I couldn\u2019t\nfind her anywhere, and I think she was killed at the seventh [indecipherable] I think, or on the\nfourth -- I think on the seventh, but I don\u2019t know where. I can\u2019t go there even, this is too hard for\nme. But this I can\u2019t take, be -- my mother is -- she was such a -- a wonderful person. But you see,\nshe -- she was already divorced and the narcom -- the minister were -- were called -- he was\ncalled narcom in -- in the Soviet times, Gregorouskas Marionas, he fall in love with here and\nprobably therefore she was -- she was somehow suspicious, or they wanted -- I don\u2019t know why.\nI think this -- this Skuropskas denounced her, so I think. Because not everybody was arrested.\nPeople -- they would take women from the street and man especially -- not so many women,\nmore man. But -- but she ca -- she was arrested and I am absolutely sure that it was denounced.\nAnd I -- and she was, after such a hard operation and I was told by women prisoners who came\nout, and I met them in the ghetto, that my mother was very proud, and she would -- she was\nsinging. Sometimes they thought that maybe she lost her mind, but I don\u2019t know. But in the --\nshe was interrogated by the Gestapo or by the Lithuanian police, I don\u2019t know. I think by\nGestapo. And she spoke, of course, German very well. And th-they -- they told her that, oh we\ncan\u2019t believe you are Jewish. She -- but she answered that she is Jewish, and she was not asking,\nshe was proud and full of dignity, so that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all I know about my mother.",
        "Q: And you heard it from other prisoners, they --",
        "A: Yeah, from women prisoners, that she was very nice and behaved very proudly and -- and\nvery -- and full of -- with dignity. She didn\u2019t ask for mercy, or she was not, you know --",
        "Q: But this you learned later, in the ghetto?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: This point --",
        "A: She just disappeared, and my uncle, her brother, Jorge Stromas was also arrested on Monday\nevening. He -- just because he was too honest. He didn\u2019t leave -- he didn\u2019t escape. My mother\ncouldn\u2019t escape because she was ill, and my uncle couldn\u2019t escape because his son, Alexander\nStromas was in Palanga. And my mother was in hospital. We were a very close family, old\ngrandparents, my grandparents. So he stayed here. But he understood that -- he was the director\nof Parama. This is a bakery of bread. And he went on Monday evening to -- because the factory\nhas to work, to give the keys away, because he understood that he will not any more be the\ndirector, so -- and then they arrested him, and I saw him working in -- in the Russian embassy.\nThis was in the beginning of Laisves Aleja, guarded by a BaltaraiStininkas with some other\npeople. I -- I was very -- I was very energetic. My father, I must say, somehow prepared me for\nsuch a life because he educated me and -- to be very independent. So I went immediately to my\naunt, his wife, and my cousin Margaret, and I brought her down to -- to -- to this place, and I was\ntrying to convince my uncle to leave. It was on -- on Wednesday, to -- to escape, because the\nBaltaraistininkas was -- it was they were not so hardly guarded, yeah. The har -- it was -- he\ncould escape. And I told him come, you -- you should escape. And my uncles said no, I can\u2019t do\nit, because these BaltaraiStininkas, we were all count and if he comes back without one person,\nhe will be punished. And I don\u2019t believe that something will happen, you know. Everything will\nbe okay. And he didn\u2019t go, because -- because he didn\u2019t want, you know, to put in a bad position\nthis BaltaraiStininkas. And then he was killed in Lietukis in the garage. But this I got to know\nonly after the war. After -- after -- after the war was finished, yeah.",
        "Q: The Lietukis garage happened on the second day of the --",
        "A: No, it was on the 27\", on Friday. You know, there are now controversies, who can now\nremember exactly, but in my opinion, I saw him definitely on Wednesday, and I didn\u2019t see the\nLietukis massacre, but as I learned from -- from literature and so on and from memories, it was\non the 27\", on Friday.",
        "Q: And Wednesday was the 25\".",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, you lost your uncle.",
        "A: Yeah, I lost my uncle --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- and I lost my mother.",
        "Q: -- you didn\u2019t know how, but --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- he disappeared.",
        "A: They -- they disappeared.",
        "Q: They disappeared.",
        "A: We -- I -- I -- we were all waiting a long time for them to come back, but never happened.\nCouldn\u2019t believe.",
        "Q: Then you see --",
        "A: Was also a person -- you know, they were extremely -- my -- I wouldn\u2019t say that about my\nfather, he was a -- such a strong person, but my mother and her brother were extremely soft,\nliberal, good hearted people who wouldn\u2019t really -- they -- it is so -- it is terrible. Sorry.",
        "Q: And a-a-a -- you\u2019re left on your own, or what --",
        "A: No, I was then staying with my aunt, my mother\u2019s sister. The only who -- from the whole\nfamily who survived, and my grandparents lost all their children except this aunt, and with my\ngrandparents, I went with them to the ghetto.",
        "Q: But before you went to the ghetto there were still --",
        "A: I was alone, I was in my house.",
        "Q: -- two -- two weeks?",
        "A: Yeah, there were not, there was more than two weeks.",
        "Q: More than two weeks?",
        "A: Yeah. The war started on the 22\", the order to go to the ghetto was on the 15\" of July, and\nthe ghetto was closed on the 15\"\" of August. And I had another aunt of a uncle of my mother\u2019s\nbrother who perished before, well died before. Died. No, died from operation. And I was -- you\nknow, I was by myself 13 years old, but she had a little son, Lavinka, my -- my cousin, and I\ntook care of them, you know. I was -- I was -- I was going to -- to -- to get some food, because\nthe -- in the Jewish shops you couldn\u2019t buy anything, so I would take off my -- my star, yellow\nstar and I would try to go in this Lithuanian shops to buy something. So mostly I succeeded, but\ntwice I was thrown out from the -- and [indecipherable] you -- why are you staying here?",
        "Q: They knew you, or the --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: -- no.",
        "A: But I -- I looked like a Jewish girl --",
        "Q: You looked Jewish.",
        "A: -- yeah. But what saved me sometimes is my language, because it was ma -- be-because it\nwas, you know, like a stereotype that the Jews don\u2019t speak Lithuanian well. They can\u2019t speak\nLithuanian well, they have an accent, they are, you know, and so on. I had no accent at all. So,\nthey couldn\u2019t believe I could sometimes you know, like it -- it -- it made people doubtful. Maybe\nI am not Jewish because I speak so well Lithuanian.",
        "Q: And was it dangerous for you to walk in the streets in this period?",
        "A: Oh yes, very dangerous. Very dangerous. And it was maybe you know, the -- the most\nhumiliating thing because -- I don\u2019t remember now exactly which day it was, but we were not\nallowed to go on the sidewalks. So we had to walk like animals on -- on the -- on the street, not\non the pavement.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So -- and you couldn\u2019t go two together, you have to go one by one. So this was really -- it was\nso humiliating, it was so -- and terrible. And then you meet people you knew -- you knew them,\nyeah? And when they see you, they turn away their eyes from you. And I was -- it was -- it -- it\nwas so shocked, I couldn\u2019t understand what happened. And -- and only later already, much later,\nI understood that they were turning away their eyes and heads because they couldn\u2019t help, and\nmaybe they were very confused, I am -- I am -- I understand that --",
        "Q: And ashamed.",
        "A: -- there was no -- I -- I tried to understand this, but this was very painful. And I remember\nhow a partisan, a -- a BaltaraiStininkas on Laisves Aleja, I went there, I was with my star and he\ntook my hand and -- and said, do you know -- don\u2019t you know that the Jews have no rights to\nwear watches? And I had a Paul Bourret, which my father bought me in Switzerland when we\nwere in \u00b038, it was a very dear present to me. And he took it off. And good he didn't beat me up\nor didn\u2019t kill me, or -- but it was also very humiliating. I was very sensitive to such things. I\ncouldn\u2019t understand.",
        "Q: You knew him?",
        "A: No, no. But it was such -- you know, the atmosphere was really somehow terrible. My cousin\nMargaret, my -- the -- the daughter of Jorge Stromas, of my uncle, she later got to know that her\nclassmates were -- were discussing -- they knew that she has a radio, and then the radio was not\nSo -- so, they were discussing maybe let us go and take away from her the radio. And then they\nstill decided no, it wouldn\u2019t be nice, so they didn\u2019t go. But once one of the group stopped them.\nSo, you see, it was -- 1-it was a atmosphere of you had no rights at all. You were nothing,\nnothing. Everybody was an enemy. And when our former -- former servant, she was a cook in\nour house, she brought me something to eat -- so she was hiding, nobody should know, nobody\nshould see it, she was afraid. And so it was -- it was really -- it was a -- there were some people\nwho tried to help, too, but really very few, and everybody was very afraid to help Jews.",
        "Q: You understand such a phenomena suddenly -- not talking about the partisans and about the\nGerman Nazis, but the Lithuanian friends of --",
        "A: Can you -- did you live some -- sometimes -- did you have the experience of living in\ntotalitarian society? Probably not.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: So -- so, when you are living in a totalitarian society, you are afraid of your shadow.",
        "Q: No, Pm not talking --",
        "A: This is what -- how they -- they --",
        "Q: No, no, this was --",
        "A: -- keep, and they know that for instance, Lithuanians who tried to help Jews were killed, also.",
        "Q: This was not my question.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: \u2019'm asking you about another thing, about those Lithuanians who suddenly found out that it\u2019s\nokay to loot, it\u2019s permitted, and then they can do it, to take the radio, for instance.",
        "A: No, not everybody did it, you know, I would say the whole atmosphere was bad, but not\neverybody did it, no. Many people were ashamed to do it, it -- it is like, you know, when you say\nthat the Jews were meeting with joi -- the Red army. So, there were some Jews who did it, some\nwere terrified. But -- so the same 1s to say that Lithuanians, some yes, but not all. And then you\nsee the propaganda, the -- the Nazi propaganda, which was taken also over by the LAF-ists, the\nLithuanian LAF-ist Skirpa, who had a good intention to -- to have again an independent\nLithuania, he thought that maybe Hitler will give him back the independence, but it didn\u2019t\nhappen. It was a big disappointment, of course. But I know that you can\u2019t use any -- you have,\nyou know, this M-Machiavelli, that 1-1f you have a task you can pay any price, this is not\nvaluable in life, it is terrible. So -- and it was, the propaganda was, you see, you are of -- all Jews\nare communists. It stays very deep in your -- in your con -- in the Lithuanian conscience that --\nthat they sold you to the Soviet Union, they are your real enemies and therefore you have to kill\nthem like parasites. So you -- and I am absolutely sure that many Lithuanians really took revenge\nfor their deported -- and it could happen that for instance, when their family or somebody was\ndeported, some -- some of the people who came to deport was -- could be also a Jew. There were\nnot many of them, but still, 1t could happen. This is why th -- you should never generalize. So it\nwas like absolute belief that the Jews are your enemies, that the Jews are communists, the Jews\nsold your cu -- sold your country and there were maybe people who believed that they are killing\nthe enemies. And only later it came -- of course there were people among the killers who wanted\nto become richer, who wanted the -- there were different people. It\u2019s complicated, but 1-in the\nbeginning it was really that. And it\u2019s very interesting, one lawyer from Solvakia, he told me how,\nafter the beginning of the war, the Jews, I think it was in VilkaviSkis, they were collected and\nbrought into the kazaram, you know, where the -- the -- the -- the soldiers live. And everybody\nwas asked who he 1s and -- and they wanted to get from them, I don\u2019t know, the men -- men,\nmaybe men. And then one Jew was somehow -- wasn\u2019t obedient, and they shot him. And they\nwere so afraid that they did it. And they have hidden him in -- in somewhere, buried him in a\nsecret place, because they were afraid that tomorrow will come a [indecipherable] and will\naccuse them that they killed a person. But nothing happened, nobody came. So it was absolute\nfree. You could kill a Jew, you could kill him like a fly. Nothing would happen to you. So -- and\nthen it 1s e -- it -- it -- 1t -- it comes like a -- I don\u2019t know, it was a terrible atmosphere of hatred.\nYou can\u2019t -- it\u2019s described in literature, it 1s -- it doesn\u2019t last for very long, but it 1s there and they\nhave to pay a very high price for that.",
        "Q: And then there was the decree about moving to the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah. We had to exchange flats to find a place. The Lithuanians who lived in Vilijampole\nbecame our flats and we went there. Of course we all were very squeezed in, but not --",
        "Q: Was it -- was it a relief to go --",
        "A: To go to the ghetto?",
        "Q: -- to the ghetto?",
        "A: In some way, yes. Because -- because we felt really very unsecure and unprotected in the\ntown. But this was also, as you understand, it was a -- not a secure place.",
        "Q: And what did you take with you to the ghetto? What could you take with you?",
        "A: I remember that we got a -- a coach with a horse and I put some clothes in, and food, mainly.\nAnd some -- what you had what could be maybe sold later on, or something, but --",
        "Q: You were together with your aunts?",
        "A: No, I live -- I lived separately, but -- but we went to the ghetto. I went with the aunt, first of\nall, of my -- of my -- of my -- that uncle, past -- Tanta Ada with Lavinka. And I stayed with\nthem, because they were very helpless and I was already stronger. And then they were taken to\nthe ninth fort on the aktion --",
        "Q: This is --",
        "A: -- big aktion on the 28\" of October \u201941. But already before I went already to live with my\ngrandparents and with my Aunt Paula.",
        "Q: In the ghetto?",
        "A: Yeah, because it was a more secure family who had some men, and Auntie Ada, he was a\nlonely woman with a child, so she wasn\u2019t very secure. Nobody was secure, but still.",
        "Q: Now, can you describe the first weeks in the ghetto before the big aktion?",
        "A: The aktion started very soon, very fast. There were --",
        "Q: But see, there were a few weeks there.",
        "A: Y-Y-Yeah. No, you see, we were somehow trying to cope with new situation. It was\nimmediately a question of food, because there were -- the Germans came, the -- the Nazis came\ntoo, and took away our, you know, food we had. Also, it was an order to give away everything\ngold, silver and so on. So th -- I remember how the Germans were even searching, you know,\ngynecologically, the -- the Nazis who came to the -- to the ghetto. And they took away -- I had\nsuch a bracelet here, was also a very pre -- a very dear present from my father, this chains, for\nlu7ck. Took it away also. Everything. Very brutally.",
        "Q: This was the Germans, or the ger --",
        "A: Nazis, yeah, those were the Germans.",
        "Q: The Germans.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Not the Lithuanian, the partisans?",
        "A: No, the partisans were maybe also, but this were the Germans. They took away. And the lithu\n-- the Lithuanian partisans were looking after the ghetto, they were guarding the ghetto, and they\nwere really -- during the aktions they would take the people, they would guard the people who\nwere selected by the Nazis. And at the big aktion, I was staying with my grandfather and my\ngrandmother on the 28\" of October, and with the -- and th-there was al-also the whole family\nwas standing, and my aunt with her son and her husband and his brother, and they went already\nthrough, and I was behind them with two old people. I remember I was dressed in my mother\u2019s\nsuits and I put here to make a bigger breast, I put some socks into the bra. And also I -- I took\nsome shoes on higher heels to look a little bit more a -- as an adult. And then -- and my -- my\naunt and my cousin went through bet -- but the parents and a sister of my aunt\u2019s husband, they\nwere taken to the bad side, and the-they were killed at the ni -- in the ninth fort. And I was, of\ncourse, it was already -- we were staying the whole day on [indecipherable] in Vilijampole, we\nwere already of course, tired and -- and I know that about four o\u2019clock, it was already a little bit\ngetting dark, it was -- and not dark, but that was not the nicest day there was, it was not so nice.\nAnd when I was staying, I can feel now like I was holding my parents behind -- my grandparents\nbehind me and I was looking him in the eyes. And Rowka, who was making the selection, said\n[speaks foreign language] this girl has nice eyes, and -- beautiful eyes and told me to go to the\nright side, to the bad --",
        "Q: Together --",
        "A: -- to the good side.",
        "Q: Together with your --",
        "A: To-Together. He didn\u2019t see them maybe, because I think I hypnotized him. And then I was\ntaking away my grandparents. I don\u2019t know where I had so much, you know, I was so strong.\nAnd m -- I remember my grandmother saying [speaks foreign language], where are you carrying\nme? I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t run, and my grandfather was also not so fit. And -- and I -- I told her,\nBobinka, laif. I was shle -- I was carrying them until we got to the -- to the right side, so\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: From what you describe, I learn -- I understand that already then you knew what was the good\nside and what was the bad side.",
        "A: Yes. We knew because we saw that on the one side are the elderly people, the ill people, the\nchildren, the weak people. And here are the -- the -- we didn't know, but we guessed. And then\nsometimes policemen would come and take out somebody, you know, and send to the other side,\nSO we guessed that sa --",
        "Q: Policemen? You mean --",
        "A: Jewish police.",
        "Q: -- Jewish police.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: At that time the -- the Jewish police in the ghetto already had a stand, and --",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: What did you think about them at that time? About the Jewish police?",
        "A: I thought of them -- I -- I knew personally Kopelman, who was the head of the police, and he\nwas a very decent person. Not very strong, but very decent. And many policemens were\nwonderful people. And some of them were like -- like animals. So Armstam was terrible, you\nknow, and everybody hated him. But there were -- this was onl -- th-those were only individuals.\nBut as -- the police as a whole were somehow respected, in my view.",
        "Q: You know, w-w-we -- you -- you thou -- you were talking about the big aktion, but before the\nbig sh -- aktion, there was the a-aktion of the intelligentsia.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And did you see though, can you tell about it?",
        "A: Yes, I can tell. Everybody wanted to go, because they thought that there will be a better\nsolution.",
        "Q: What -- what was the announcement?",
        "A: The -- the announcement was that -- that he will work in archives, he will -- we need\nintellectual people, and we are asking for 500 men. So, of course I would now be suspicious why\nthey are asking only for men, but -- but th-then -- and they went and my cousin, who was then --\nhow old was he, he was 20 years old. So he wanted also to go, but they had already 500, he was\ntoo late. So it was a -- 1t was very tragic, because really very good people went.",
        "Q: And they disappeared.",
        "A: They disappeared.",
        "Q: Di-Did you hear any rumors about what happened to them?",
        "A: Mm, you see, it is a very strange thing. You hear rumors and you\u2019d want -- don\u2019t want to\nbelieve in it. You know, and you don\u2019t know. So when people say, how could they go to be\nkilled like -- like sheeps, so I would like to see how others would -- would behave in such\nposition. First of all you don\u2019t know that they are taking you, they say you -- they\u2019re taking for\nwork. And then you know that if you protest at this very moment, they will kill you immediately.\nAnd there you have still some hope that maybe, maybe you will be taken for work. And -- and\nthen, you know, you -- you probably know, I learned it also, for any moment you need a leader.\nYou can\u2019t expect that the crowd will do spontaneously something, you know. So -- it can\nspontaneously, but it\u2019s [indecipherable] and people were afraid. My aunt, for instance, she had a\nhiding place, the widow of my uncle, Jorge Stromas. And she was afraid to step out from the --\nfrom the cot -- from the group of people who was taking out of the ghetto.",
        "Q: At what point did she had the hi-hiding place? You mean Malina later?",
        "A: No, no, my -- my -- everybody understood that there is no future in the ghetto and that they\nare going to kill us all. And my aunt did everything and she pushed out her son, Alexander\nStromas, and he was taken by a Lithuanian family and was -- lived with them unt-until their\nliberation, wonderful people, absolutely, Metsunaviches family. And my -- his sister Margaret,\nshe got married. And her husband was a very active and very energetic man, and he organized a\nplace, a hiding place in a factory, and a Lithuanian friend, a worker of this factory\n[indecipherable], he brought them there, under an attic. And even the German leader of the\nfactory knew that they are there, but di-di-di -- didn\u2019t denounce them. And he -- nine months he\nwas feeding them, and risking his life and the life of his family, but they were saved. And M-\nMargaret\u2019s mother, Auntie Jaina had also to come to this place. She knew, but she hadn\u2019t the\ncourage to step out, and I know what it 1s. I stepped out, so I know what it is.",
        "Q: So this is later. We\u2019re talking about later --",
        "A: This is already in *43, yeah.",
        "Q: Yes. We are now at the end of \u00b041.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And we -- you described the selection at the big aktion in [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, that was terrible. You can\u2019t imagine how it was. It was the -- the -- the day after the\nselection when everybody came home, was such a crying, such a -- such a -- a f -- a terrible --\neverybody lost somebody. It was really terrible, terrible.",
        "Q: And did you know what happened to them?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: Did you know what happened to them?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know anything, but for instance, the next day and the day after, we heard\nshootings. So, I told you we believed and we didn\u2019t believe, but we know -- never saw them\nback. We saw them from -- they were taken on the 28\" to the little ghetto, and then the next day\nthey were taken to the Ninth Fort from the little ghetto.",
        "Q: And you saw them walking?",
        "A: Yeah, we s -- we saw them going, yeah.",
        "Q: And then you heard shots?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: For how long these shots were going on?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. It went on probably for some time,\nbut I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Did you hear anything about people who were taken to the Ninth Fort and managed to survive\nthere and come back to the ghetto?",
        "A: Yeah, this was Judel Baylis.",
        "Q: You know him?",
        "A: Yeah, I know him. I helped to publish his book. I --",
        "Q: But -- but then, I -- if you --",
        "A: Ah, then?",
        "Q: Then. Not later.",
        "A: No, I -- then I really didn\u2019t know, no. No. I he-heard only rumors --",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: -- about somebody coming back, telling terrible stories, and some people thought they are\nmad, you know. But I was still a young child and then I -- I went to -- to -- to -- I worked,\nbecause I need to have some food, so I went to the aerodrome, to the -- to work. It was very hard\nwork there.",
        "Q: You -- when you say you went there, could you initiate this --",
        "A: No, no, I just joined the -- the brigada of the ar -- aerodromestikas.",
        "Q: Yes, but how did you join them? You came in the morning and said, I\u2019m coming with you to\nwork?",
        "A: No, no, I registered probably, in the [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t remember now exactly how I\ndid it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But I went there and then I could expect a little bit bigger piece of bread, you know.",
        "Q: That was given by whom?",
        "A: It was given by -- by the -- we had some stores in the -- in the ghetto, so we would get there\nsome bread.",
        "Q: So you got some coupons to --",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t remember we had coupons or not coupons, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: But I know that my aunt, a cousin of my mother worked in such a shop and she couldn\u2019t give\nme more, but still she tried. You know, the burt -- bread was cut so give me a little bit bigger\npiece of bread. And then she worked in the -- in the kitchen of the werkstatten, where I worked\nlater on, so she gave me a little bit thicker soup, you know. But however, I went to -- with the\naerodromestikas, and this was the hardest brigade. We had to work nightshifts there. And it\nfinished with that I collapsed.",

        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t know how to call it in English.",
        "Q: But for -- what was the purpose of these pits?",

        "A: I think it was -- it is -- it had no purpose at all. It was just to sc -- to ca -- to -- to torture us. I\ndon\u2019t know if that\u2019s some -- but opposite were -- also, this was terrible. We were already better\noff than the -- than the Soviet prisoners of war. They were so hungry. Was terrible. So we would\nshare with them, but if somebody sees it, ger -- a Nazi guard, that you throw some piece of bread\nor a cigarette, they would kill you immediately.",
        "Q: Did you see people being shot for throwing a piece of bread or a cigarette?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember seeing it, but I know that it -- it would happen.",
        "Q: You knew that it was dangerous.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it was very dangerous.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t see it.",
        "A: No, but I was told.",
        "Q: How did you communicate with the Soviet prisoners?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t communicate, but some people, they were -- we were -- they were a little bit far\nbehind the fence, so we couldn\u2019t direct communicate with them, but somehow people managed.\nAnd of course we tried not to work too hard, but the guards would come and beat us up, and I got\nalso on my back some hits. But then it finished that I --",
        "Q: Who were the guards?",
        "A: The guards were -- as far as I remember these were -- were soldiers, is -- German soldiers,\nmainly. I don\u2019t remember it being Lithuanians. Maybe the Lithuanians were taking us to the\nairport there, but really, you see, the memory is not so -- 1s not so clear, and --",
        "Q: Well, this -- maybe it will help you to try and remember in what language they were talking.",
        "A: I think in German, but because I understood German --",
        "Q: You",
        "A: So if I wouldn\u2019t understand German, then I would maybe remember better. But because I --\nLithuanian and German I understood equally, so I maybe don\u2019t remember. I only remember how\na woman was picking up a piece of cigarette which this guard was throwing out -- throwing\naway, and she got terribly beaten up for that. This I saw. And some people managed even to\nleave the brigade, to get out to some Lithuanian houses and to bring some food, in exchange of\nsome things, but it was also, of course, very dangerous. So then I\u2019d -- I\u2019d worked there at li -- I\nthink about six weeks and then I collapsed, I was dystrophia, you know, I couldn\u2019t move any\nmore, I was absolutely -- and I got ill and I was lying in bed for six weeks.",
        "Q: You -- you collapsed during work?",
        "A: No, no, at home --",
        "Q: At home.",
        "A: -- I couldn\u2019t any more go, I was absolutely dystrophia. I was still 13 years old, so I needed\nsome food. I know how much teenagers are eating.",
        "Q: So you stayed at home for a few weeks.",
        "A: For six weeks I was -- I was ill and --",
        "Q: Anybody took care of you?",
        "A: Yeah, my -- of course, my family and then doctors would come.",
        "Q: Your family is whom you gra --",
        "A: My aunt and my grandparents. And my grandparents would -- I would find under my pillow a\nlittle piece of bread. So my grandmother or grandfather would take their portion and give it\nsecretly to me, because the husband of my aunt was very -- he wa -- he wanted everybody to\nhave equally and so -- but they -- they gave me some bit more, my grandparents. And he would\ncut everything in equal pieces. So it was -- and then I -- then I recovered, bit by bit and then I got\nanother job. I -- the werkstatten were organized, and I was working there in the [indecipherable]\nthis is [indecipherable] this is fo -- where we made toys. And then already we saw -- we made\nout toys from -- from different, you know, m -- no -- no -- for instance, suitcases, clothes which\nwere -- that was taken away from the killed people.",
        "Q: And you recognized this?",
        "A: Yeah, we could ice -- I remember some inscriptions. And of course I couldn\u2019t recognize the --\nthe -- the clothes, but it is clear that the clothes was not very good clothes, the good clothes was\nprobably taken by other people. And then we made -- I made dolls. We made dolls out of that.\nWe were cutting from the suitcases such round things to put like joints that we can move their\nhands, and -- and from the material we would -- we would sew clothes, nice for these dolls. And\nthe dolls were sent as presents to the families of the German soldiers, to Germany.",
        "Q: How did you know this?",
        "A: I -- we are told.",
        "Q: You were told so.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How many people was -- were working together with you in this werkstatz?",
        "A: [indecipherable] in the werkstatten were a lot of people.",
        "Q: In this -- in this werkstatten.",
        "A: In the -- in the [indecipherable] alone, there may be 15 - 20.",
        "Q: Which was a small one.",
        "A: Small, small, yeah.",
        "Q: And how did you learn to manufacture this --",
        "A: Ah, you learn everything immediately. Somebody knows better, and -- we had -- we had, you\nknow, I don\u2019t know how it is in -- in Russia, when you cut wood, then you have like -- like flour,\nhow it\u2019s called.",
        "Q: In -- I know what you mean, I --",
        "A: You know what I -- so we would put it inside these legs and -- and bodies so it -- it should\nhave a shape, and then we would put the clothes on, and make --",
        "Q: And you got this from another werkstatt, this flour?",
        "A: Yeah, from another werkstatt, because there was another werkstatt who made something out\nof -- of wood.",
        "Q: Of wood.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. So they had --",
        "Q: And this period, working in this werkstatt was a relief for you?",
        "A: In some way, yes. There were no reliefs in the ghetto, but still there were some -- the for -- the\nyear \u00b042 was a little bit better than \u201941, and there were not so many aktions, not so great aktions,\nand we managed even to organize an orchestra, and --",
        "Q: What do you mean we managed? You took part?",
        "A: Well, th-the -- the ghetto.",
        "Q: And you took -- you took part?",
        "A: That [indecipherable] me, no, but I identify myself with the ghetto",
        "Q: Yeah, I-I see. And you went to listen to this orchestra?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, these were moments of relief. We were singing, people were performing and --\nand then -- and this was really -- and I had a friend, Bobby Rosenberg -- brum who was playing\npiano and on [indecipherable] there were -- this was this concert hall, the piano was there and we\nwent sometimes and listened -- were listening how he plays. And he had also a hidden patophone\nand concerts. Huberman was playing Tchaikovsky\u2019s concert and Mendelssohn\u2019s they had, so we\nwere -- we went sometimes to listen to it. This was just, you know, really moments of relief. And\nthen I went to school also there. It was a illegal school, and -- because we were not allowed to\nhave schools, but still, 1t was organized and I went there and I learned there, for instance,\nSchiller\u2019s Ballade, which also, I must say, gave me a lot of moral strength, because as you know,\nSchiller in his Ballades is giving examples of people\u2019s high morality of -- of -- of behavior in\nvery critical circumstances, according to their principles, to their understanding of honor and so\non and -- like the [speaks foreign language here] and so on, so --",
        "Q: And this was for you something to identify with at this point?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. With -- I always identified with -- I wanted to be like -- you can\u2019t\nalways be, but I wanted really, it gave me some. It was also in -- coinciding with what I learned\nfrom home, from my mother.",
        "Q: May I ask you, you are, at this time a gi -- a girl of 14, and this is the time that girls start to\nthink about romantic [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, I had a romance in the ghetto as well. And we are still friends until now. It\u2019s Dr. Jack\nBrowns. Now he is Dr. Jack Browns, then he was Yasha. And when we were meeting each other\nand we were very happy to share many things, and I remember how after the Estonian aktion,\nwhen people were taken to Estonia and I was in the werkstatten and he worked also in the\n[indecipherable] but in -- in the biz -- he worked with -- with wood. He told me that I shouldn\u2019t\ngo alone home, that he is going to see if his parents are there. We went together and then he will\nsee me off. And I remember that we went together, it was a very good feeling and his parents\nwere at home, thank God, and then I was living in the other part of the ghetto and we had to pass\nthe Krikschu kaichu Street where the ghetto was very narrow and that was a little bit dangerous\nto walk there, so his parents were absolutely terrified that he 1s going to see me off, but still he\ndid it, and -- and I came back and I also found my family, but many people disappeared and after\nthe Estonian aktion, I left the ghetto pretty soon.",
        "Q: Why was it dangerous to go in this narrow part of the ghetto?",
        "A: Because there were the guards, and the guards can shoot you any time.",
        "Q: Were they shooting from [indecipherable]",
        "A: They -- oh, it can -- yeah, for instance, there was a very tragic story in the ghetto, which\nhappened to a half Jew, Argie Saviskas. He was a very beautiful man. He is a son of a very\nfamous Lithuanian writer and diplomat who happened to marry a Jewish woman, and he has two\nsons. One of her sons is still alive -- of their sons is still alive, Augustinas Saviskas, he is a very\nfamous painter. And his brother Argie Saviskas fall in love with a Jewish woman, terribly ugly\nwoman. She didn't look li -- she had the child, but he fall in love with her and he joined her in the\nghetto. And he was guarding the gardens in the ghetto, where we were growing some potatoes or\nsomething like that. And once he started to talk to a Lithuanian guard who was walking around,\nand they got in some controversy. And when this guard learned that he is Lithuanian -- because\nhe probably accused them that he is a guard or something, he shot him, this Argie Saviskas, he\njust shot him. So it\u2019s a very tragic story.",
        "Q: So it was frightening to --",
        "A: Yeah, it was frightening, yeah.",
        "Q: -- get closer to the guards?",
        "A: Yeah, and after an aktion, you know, you are so frightened, you don\u2019t know where the danger\ncomes from.",
        "Q: You said that 1942 was a bit better than 1941.",
        "A: This was a little bit more stable, less aktions.",
        "Q: But still, do you remember any aktions in 1942?",
        "A: There were different events. People were punished for smuggling in food, and people -- I -- I\ncan\u2019t tell you now this, I should check really the dates, I don\u2019t remember exactly when it was,\nbut there were -- for instance there was a Jewish fa -- a -- a Jewish man who had a Christian\nwife, she was Belgian. And they wanted to -- they -- they applied to go to the -- to Belgium,\nbecause she was Christian, and -- and they were not allowed and finally they were told that okay,\nand they were taken out from the ghetto and they were shot.",
        "Q: Did you see them taken out of the ghetto?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t see, but I know -- I knew them.",
        "Q: You knew --",
        "A: I knew them personally, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And how did you know they were shot?",
        "A: Because they never came back and then -- then it was the rumors were spreading around, so --",
        "Q: And have you seen any people who were punished for smuggling food? Any cases of\npunishments?",
        "A: You see -- that I saw th -- for instance how they go through the -- the -- through the fence,\nbelow the fence. I knew -- I knew even the places where they went, but -- and they were bribing\nthe guards often, but I didn\u2019t see it by myself, no.",
        "Q: You only heard about?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, but -- you know, I was not running around in the evening or at night.",
        "Q: So I -- I\u2019m trying to understand how it is to be a 14 years old girl in the ghetto. You have to\nwork?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You have a love affair?",
        "A: Yeah. No, a love affair, you know, it was all very platonic and very innocent. It was -- it was\nanother time, so it was not like today.",
        "Q: In the sense that he gave you some strength, I think.",
        "A: Yeah, we had very nice feelings, but we had no -- no sexual relations or something. This was\nnot the case in those times.",
        "Q: And what did you eat?",
        "A: What I eat -- I ate?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I ate the piece of bread.",
        "Q: That you were -- that was distributed.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I got the soup in the werkstatten for instance, which was very thin, but still my\naunt was giving me sometimes a little bit more so I -- I could find there some lentils or a little\npiece of -- of horsemeat.",
        "Q: How did you know it was horsemeat?",
        "A: Because my -- I know what was cooked, my -- my aunt told me.",
        "Q: She told you?",
        "A: Yeah. And I know already the -- the -- the taste of it. And it is very good to get a -- a piece of\nhorse -- horsemeat, not so bad. Yeah, so this was the main food, and yeah, we made sometimes\nfor -- when we had kipsventai -- what is Easter? Easter is -- what is it? It\u2019s not a holiday, but\nwhat 1s it?",
        "Q: It\u2019s a -- festive. No, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s --",

        "A: In Hebrew it doesn\u2019t help me. Unfortunately [indecipherable] I\u2019m very upset that I don\u2019t\nknow Hebrew. The -- so in \u201942 we were -- we -- for -- for some celebrations, okay, we made for\nma -- for instance, out of cabbage, we made gehakt herring, this 1s you know, such he-herring\nlike -- like when -- chopped herring. Or out of potatoes, even sometimes we ate the -- the skin of\nthe potatoes. Not always potatoes, so we made out of the skin -- we -- we I-let it through a\nmachine mixing -- mixer, and then we made -- we made kikolach, such -- such -- such --",
        "Q: Yes.",

        "Q: Cakes. Some cakes.",
        "A: Yeah, like [indecipherable] cake, yeah. And then we made in -- out of -- we had rye flour.\nThis was already -- we brought sometimes in from the city. We --",
        "Q: What do you mean, we brought from the city?",
        "A: No, when we -- for instance, my cousin went to work, so he was smuggling in, he was\nchanging it for some -- he was br-bringing out some clothes or something and then getting for\nthe --",
        "Q: Buying.",
        "A: Yeah, buying. So then we made such a porridge out of this -- with this rye flour and if we had\nsome spirgai, some -- some -- you know, pork fat.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Which was -- was -- was made, you know, with -- because we had not any more guze or -- or\nchicken fat, this was absolutely -- so -- and if you put a little bit in, so this was already a\nwonderful -- won-wonderful dish.",
        "Q: Usually, were you hungry?",
        "A: Yeah, this was one of the main feelings in the ghetto. This is fear, hunger. All the time\nhunger, you can\u2019t imagine, it\u2019s a terrible feeling, hungry all the time. And -- and then also I was\npersonally -- I really was suffering that I couldn\u2019t learn. I wanted to learn. So this was also that\ntime is passing. But fear and -- and hunger was terrible.",
        "Q: So you were --",
        "A: You didn\u2019t feel any more so humiliated because you were among the same people.",
        "Q: Everybody was hungry.",
        "A: Y-Yeah, but everybody -- no, there were people who were not so hungry. It was a difference\nin the ghetto. We were calling them the yallis, you know, the -- the -- the people who were in the\naltestenrat, the police. There were people who worked in the Gestapo brigada. So they were\nbetter off than we because they could smuggle in more, or -- or they had the better place to make\nexchange, or speculators who would smuggle in food. They were all so much better off than we.\nWe were a very ordinary family.",
        "Q: What was the Gestapo brigade?",
        "A: Gestapo brigada was a -- the brigade which worked in the Gestapo. Liptzer was a Gestapo, a\nJewish Gestapo man who was working for the Gestapo.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: And of course the -- the Ge-Gestapo was always interested if there was -- it shouldn\u2019t be\nresistance in the ghetto, it -- the partisans guns shouldn\u2019t be smuggled in and so on there.",
        "Q: So they were using these people who were working at the Gestapo?",
        "A: No, Liptzer was not. Not all ga -- people who worked in the Gestapo were collaborating with\nthe Gestapo.",
        "Q: But some of them.",

And then there was another one Serabrovich who\neven lived in town. He was a Jew, and he was also killed, and Liptzer, everybody was killed, but\nthe -- he also worked for -- somehow for the Gestapo. But you know, I was still a 14 years old,\n15 years old girl, 13 years old girl. So I saw it all, but not so -- maybe not -- I remember more\ntalking then. But I have seen a lot, I remember this terrible case when -- when the -- when the\nhospital in the little ghetto was burned down with people who were alive, with doctors, with\nnurses, with the patients.",

        "A: No, I didn\u2019t see, I was in the big ghetto.",

And this day they were a little bit late, and the little\nghetto was closed and they were -- didn\u2019t -- they were -- they were not let in there, so they saved\ntheir life, otherwise they were -- would be burned there as well.",

        "Q: Okay. Yes, please.",
        "A: I wondered, you asked me what were the dominant feeling. So one I forgot to tell you. Never,\nnever -- I wanted so much to live as I -- as -- and to survive as it was in the ghetto. The -- the --\nthe -- the desire to survive was very, very strong. And maybe the purpose for that, rationally, was\nto tell the world what happened to us, because it was absolutely unimaginable. Out of my\nchildhood, my peaceful childhood, with belief and enlightenment in goodness and humanity, and\nsuddenly I see all those terrible, violent, absolutely rational hatred and so on, and I thought that\nwe have to witness it to tell the world about that, that it should never happen again.",
        "Q: You thought about this in this wa --",
        "A: In the ghetto.",
        "Q: In the ghetto?",
        "A: Yeah. Very much. Very much.",
        "Q: That it should never happen again, in the ghetto?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I -- I thought that we have to witness it. We have to witness it, to tell the\nworld what happened to us, because it should never happen again, to anybody. And I somehow\nbelieved, after the -- after the end that it will c -- everything will come up and it will really -- we\nwill learn something, but now I have no illusions any more. I know that if not Jews, somebody\nelse. Yugoslavia killed me. Killed all my hopes, absolutely. And also I -- of course, the Soviets --",
        "Q: And Cambodia, Rwanda --",
        "A: Cambodia, Rwanda, yeah, but this was already later, after Yugoslavia. But I must say that it is\nterrible that -- 1t is human nature, and you can\u2019t change it, and -- and you will never change it.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- the optimistic --",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: In the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. So, what would be your question now?",
        "Q: At the certain point you started thinking about getting out of there.",
        "A: I really didn\u2019t think so much by myself about that, but very close friends of my parent\u2019s, the\nStrimychie family, Bogdonavichai Strimychie, they came to Kaunas in \u201942, because he was in\nBelgium, he was a -- studying there engineering. He was [indecipherable] with his wife Onutay.\nAnd -- and th-they knew that I am in the ghetto in Kaunas. They were looking for me, and they\nfound out that I am there. And then they have sent me a little note that there is no future for me\nin the ghetto and I should sing that -- to get out, and that they will arrange documents for me, and\nthen we will -- I will -- I will -- I should escape the ghetto. I even didn\u2019t want to do it, I don\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t want to leave my family and my friends and th -- I never thought about that. But still, it\nwas clear that everybody can\u2019t be saved, and we have to try to save ourselves one by one. And\nmy boyfriend talked me in that I have to go, and -- and my family. And so I got documents that I\n-- | became the daughter of -- I got the documents of the daughter of the director of the\nMarijampole gymnasia, Tregeis -- I was Tregita Irena Felisksor, the same name, his daughter had\nthe same name -- name as my name, I was Irena, given -- the name was given by my parents to\nme. And -- and h-he just gave this documents of his daughter to me, and it was such a green page\nof paper with -- with -- they forged in there a -- a photography picture. And we decided that I,\nafter the Estonian aktion, that I will leave the ghetto.",
        "Q: The Estonian --",
        "A: The Estonian aktion was, I think the third or fourth of November \u201943. But I have to check\n[indecipherable] at the date if -- 1f -- to be very precise. Or it was maybe on the seventh, I don\u2019t\nremember, but in the beginning of November. And then I had to leave the ghetto in the evening\nat six o\u2019clock with the brigade, which went to town to work. I should not put my -- not sew my\nsign, but put it just as a little needle so that I can easily take it off, and Onuta will wait for me on\nthe bridge, which uni -- connects Kaunas with Vilyjampole. But I couldn\u2019t leave at six o\u2019clock, it\nwas something. And of course the policeman there, they knew --",
        "Q: Did you -- did you say goodbye to your family?",
        "A: Yes, of course, everybody was sitting with me at the gate. Yasha, my friend was sitting with\nme, and my aunt was sitting with me, and -- and everybody, of course was very nervous. And\nthen, finally I was told that I should join the brigade and the policeman, who was counting the\npeople, didn\u2019t count me. A Jewish policeman who was --",
        "Q: He knew about it.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, he knew. And then we went -- this is -- here is the gate, yeah, and here is\nKrikS\u00e9iukaicio Street, and here is Jurbarko gatve and here is the bridge, yeah?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And here is already Kaunas. So -- so I went out with the brigade. Then I know definitely that\nLithuanians was guarding us. And s -- a friend -- somebody took off my sign from my back, I\ntook off it from here and then I had to step from the group of people in the colon -- colonna, to\nthe pavement, yeah, they were walk -- walking pavement, because we were walking on the\nstreet, the -- the whole brigade. And this step, to do this was the most terrible thing, I can tell\nyou. I can understand how hard it is, because they can shot -- shot -- shot you. But it was already\n-- I was lucky. And the main I had only one idea in my head, not to run. To go very slowly, not\nto show that I am nervous, and so I went out, I get -- got a -- gained the feeling that somebody is\n-- will shoot my back immediately. But still I managed to go slowly, then I turned. And I don\u2019t\nremember the brigade was walking faster or slower, probably slower. And then, on the bridge,\nnobody was meeting me, because it was already two hours later than it was expected. And then I\nwent to their house, I knew the address, but not so very precisely. So I didn\u2019t know the flats, so I\nrang the bell, and it was the bell of the house caretaker, yeah, you call it. And they were the most\ndangerous people because they were really all serving in the ge -- not all, but many of them in --\nfor Gestapo, and they would denounce. And I asked where are the Strimychie? He told me and I\nwent in, but I told them that -- that I was asking the -- this man. So they were absolutely terrified.\nThey had two children, little. But in the morning they had already prepared a ticket. They took\nme immediately to Vilnius, where -- which is a more multicultural city and nobody knew here\nmy parents or me. And then started my life in Vilnius. So --",
        "Q: Where in Vilnius?",
        "A: The -- th-the first place [indecipherable] took me was his sister\u2019s, she was a dentist and she\nlived in Shwerinas on Mitskabajo Street. She was a wonderful woman, but she was so afraid\nwhen I came, for three days she couldn\u2019t eat, she couldn\u2019t sleep, she was so afraid. So I can\u2019t kill\n-- can\u2019t kill a person, so I had -- they took care [indecipherable] took care all the time what\nhappened to me. So I went to live in the house of her brother, Onuta\u2019s brother, on the [speaks\nLithuanian here]. It was a house which belonged then to the university before and I lived in his\nflat with him like -- like a relative from -- from the -- from the countryside. And he was very\nkind, very good, but he was actually a little bit Bohemian, he was a surgeon and all the elite,\nartistic elite came, so I learned there Schema and Kuchinskas and Vukoshas and Yukonaviches,\nall the famous Lithuanian artists and -- and so on. And well, there was a girl from -- from the --\nfrom the countryside. But Pranas, he was very goodhearted and he thought I must look like\neverybody. So he gave me money and t-told me to curl my hair, you know, permanent\n[indecipherable] permanent, this is [indecipherable]. And I went, and then I became much more\nlike a Jew, looking, because -- so it was not a very good idea, but nothing thing to do. And once\nit happened, I lived there for more than two months and once I -- yeah, and I was a -- a friend,\nalso very famous Lithuanian woman, Marcella Kubilutai. She arranged for me a working place in\nthe orphan home on Subacho 16, it was then. And she told the director of this place that I am a\nhalf Jew, it should be a little bit easier for him, and -- and that I -- and he gave me work, I was\nworking like a -- like -- no, like a sanitarka, you know, I -- w-washing and -- and feeding the\nchildren and so on. And -- and once -- I will tell you later on about this orphan home, but Pranas,\nthere came his friends one evening and brought a book, Van Gogh reproductions. And I was -- I\nliked very much Van Gogh, and my mother liked very much Van Gogh, I knew him. And when I\nsaw this book, I forgot who I am, and I said oh, this is Van Gogh, so wonderful. And then they\nall looked what kind of girl from the countryside is it who knows who is Van Gogh, because then\nyou haven\u2019t had so many, you know, books of reproductions as we have now. So -- and it\nbecame a little bit dangerous to stay there because they were all very good people, but you know,\nsometimes when they got drunk, they got -- they were talking too much. And also, he was\nengaged to a woman from Siauliai, Janni, who of course didn\u2019t know that I lived there, and some\nrumors came that a young girl lives with him, so she got a little bit like jealous and wanted to\nfind out who is this girl, so I had to disappear from this house. And then I got to -- to a family of\na Lithuanian Colonel Meskauskas, who was arrested by the Soviets already, in \u00b041, to his widow\nand daughter, who lived on Gedimino Street. And Marcella Kubilutai also in this house, which\narranged my -- me to work there. But registered I was, in Pranas\u2019s house. So once, it was maybe\na week or two after I started to work there, the gabrininia, the nurse, the -- the main nurse, she\ncame, asked me, who are you, where are you from, who are your parents? She asked -- she\nstarted so very suspicious to interrogate me. And I answered all the questions as needed, and --\nbut I -- when I came home, I was very nervous.",
        "Q: You -- you had the -- you had a cover story prepared?",
        "A: No, I didn't tell her the truth. I said all the time from Marijampole, that I am the daughter of\nthe director of the school",
        "Q: This cover story --",
        "A: Yeah, no, not the truth, of course not. And -- but when I came home I told Marcella\nimmediately that -- that -- that I was asked by this nurse, and probably somebody denounced, or\nhas some suspicion. And she of ca -- course started to find out. And then it really was that some\nof the -- my colleagues there was su -- was suspicious that I am Jewish. I was still with my\ncurled hair. And -- and she went to director to ask who I am. And the director told her that everth\n-- everything is okay, everything is alright. And so it calmed down, the whole story. And after a\nweek of this event, suddenly some of my -- the sinit -- the nurses came in, saying that Gestapo\nsurrounded the -- the -- the orphan hou -- 0 -- home. And I wa-was absolutely sure that it\u2019s --\nthey come to take me. No -- a-and I really didn\u2019t know what to do, so I wa -- worked -- there\nwere two rooms, like that, and here in the middle was a little corridor, and here a toilet. So I went\nin the toilet, into the toilet. I put -- pulled down the water, and I was thinking what to do. To run\naway, it is little hope to escape. To -- to -- th -- and then I will -- if I escape, I prove that I am\nJewish, that I have to be afraid of something. And if I stay, maybe I will at least be able to defend\nPranas, because I was registered in his house that -- that -- and say that he didn\u2019t know who I am\nreally. So, because it was terrible for me to think that somebody will, because of me, you know,\nbe punished, or suffer. So I decided not to run away. And I went out from the toilet, I was calm\nand I f -- was feeding the children. And I hear already like, you know, the -- the shoes, the boots\ncoming in and the director, dor -- Dr. [indecipherable] with the -- with, I think, three Gestapo\npeople are coming in. And I saw only their boots, black, shining boots. And the -- but I thought\nthat Dr. Rudokas 1s a little bit, you know, like making me a little -- like with his eye, such. So\nthey were looking around the children, they were -- 1t was a denunciation that rudo -- that\nRuditis, Dr. Ruditis is hiding Jewish children, and this was true, actually. But he proved them\nthat they are Karaims, the -- the Karaims are also circumsi-sized and he didn\u2019t give the children\naway. They wanted to take the children for blood for the soldiers, so I was told. And --",
        "Q: Who told you this?",
        "A: Dr. Ruditis. And -- but he didn\u2019t give it -- later on he told me. And -- and then they left. I\nstayed. And this saved me, because it was proved that nobody came to take me, that I didn\u2019t run\naway, I am here. But I can tell you, it was quite an experience to -- to this day I will never forget.\nSo I worked there to the very end of the Nazi occupation. Then I lived in this house of --",
        "Q: Before -- before we finish the Nazi occupation, I would like to ask you one more question\nabout the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah, but I didn\u2019t finish you my story in Vilnius.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You know, fo -- and then don\u2019t forget --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- to ask me about the ghetto.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah. This is, you know, and then I was staying in this house of this Meskauskanya colon --\nwer -- the -- the widow of the Colonel Meskauskas, Maria Meskauskanya. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\nwas the best time I had, but okay. And one day Gestapo came in and was searching the flat. And\nI was -- my bed was in a sandylukas, how -- in a storage room, and was behind different stuff,\nwas a bed. But when you open the door you can\u2019t see, you see only different stuff. And the\nGestapo came in and they opened the door, but they didn't go farther, they saw it\u2019s a storage\nplace and they didn\u2019t find me. But the very moment they get -- got out, I had to get out from the\nother -- from the other door. So -- and I couldn\u2019t come back because it was really very\nthreatening. Somebody probably already denounced or something like that. So I went again to\nthe sister of [indecipherable]. And then in a day, or maybe even faster, they found for me a place,\nand so I got to the family of my second mother, really. This is Stephania Ledugania, you can see\nher beautiful face. He is a book we were pub -- we published recently about her. She was\nabsolutely outstanding personality, she had six children and -- and she took me as the seventh.\nAnd she was, I can\u2019t tell you what kind of person she was. And we became with her friends from\nthe first day, and I would like to remember several little things. When I came in there, I was\nbrought in by [indecipherable] Strimitis, she introduced me as a an orphan and now I will be the\nsister of her children. And she invited me for a evening meal. And of course she had also very\nlittle to eat, but a little bit more than in the ghetto, of course. And her husband was a Lithuanian\ngeneral, he was already arrested and killed by the Soviets. She didn't know that, but she learned\nlater, but he was arrested immediately, in \u00b041, when -- in \u201940, when the Soviets came. And -- and\nwhen she -- and she had such a -- agi-aginyeta. She was a housewife who was cooking, and we\nhad for this evening meal screelai. This is made out such things of -- of flour with a little bit fat\non it. And what I noticed that she has put in my -- into my plate a little bit more than she has\ngiven to her own children. So I was almost crying. I was really very hungry. I-In this orphan\nhome -- I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m a little bit jumping, but I am proud of it, I was feeding the -- the -- the\nchildren who were also more than one years old, and they would go -- get every day such a little\nplate with manakasha, how 1s it -- I d -- I don\u2019t remember how it\u2019s in English. It is such a wheat -\n- | forgot how it\u2019s in English, b-but a-a-a porridge out of little wheat --",
        "Q: Kasha.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: Kasha.",
        "A: Kasha, yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s also --",
        "A: Porridge.",
        "Q: -- porridge, kasha.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s kasha, yeah.",
        "Q: I -- okay, so it\u2019s --",
        "A: Manakasha. And -- cooked with milk. And this manakasha, oh, I -- I can\u2019t tell you how\nhungry wasn\u2019t I -- I wanted the manakasha to put in my mouth. And every spoon was a fight\nwith myself. I wanted to put it the mouth, but I had to put it in the mouth of the child. And the\nchildren, like devils were also very hungry. They wanted to eat, they never left a spoon for me to\neat. Sometimes soup was some leftovers, but the manakasha, never. And so I thought after the\nwar I will eat only manakasha with milk. It was my dream. But okay, I was very hungry, so you\ncan imagine what it meant to me that she has put a little bit more, and nobody -- nobody --\nnobody noticed, but I noticed. And then at 10 o\u2019clock in the evening, ev -- everybody went to\nbed, and she had this habit, she was going to -- to every child. We were -- three of her children\nwere -- three were out of the -- living in different places, they were already more adults, and\nthree were with -- with -- so we were four. And she went to everybody to give a kiss, and then\nshe came to me. I was in the bed, sleeping in a bed in a dark room without windows, where her\nson, who was taken to Germany for work was sleeping before. And she came and she kissed me\nand told me goodnight. And then I try -- then it really -- I broke out with such a almost hysterical\ncry. And this is what I wanted to tell you, how you can be indoctrinated by atmosphere of hatred.\nShe was shocked, why? She came to kiss me, why am I so crying terribly? And you know,\nnobody kissed me already, for such a long time. I was all the time in fear. Pranas was very good\nto me, but he didn\u2019t kiss me, you know, or -- or -- and this -- Maria Meskauskas [indecipherable]\nwas not such a very soft woman. And -- and suddenly she comes like a mother and kisses me. So\n-- and J -- I thought already that -- that -- I thought, how can you kiss a Jewish girl? A Jewish\nhuman being? It mu -- I thought that something has to be ugly in me. Something what puts off\npeople because everybody\u2019s hunting me, is hunting every Jew. So why? What is the matter?\nSomething must be wrong with us. So when I told her that, she also started to cry, and -- and we\nwere speaking until four o\u2019clock in the morning, and so -- so this night I really became her\ndaughter, and she my second mother. And we stayed so to th -- she died on my hands with --\nwith the whole -- whole st -- she has a whole story to tell. But even after the liberation, I stayed\nin her family because I had nobody. And then she was arrested and taken to Siberia, of course,\nwas already then, but then she still came back and we were always very close. And I think she\nloved me as well. She was a wonderful, wonderful person. She was a very religious Catholic, but\nnever fanatic. She was a very artistic nature. She loved poetry. She brought me, in those times,\nfor instance, rouge, you know, like blu --",
        "Q: Color.",
        "A: -- color, because I was very pale. So -- so that I should a little bit have some color. So, you\nknow, in those times it was absolutely immoral to -- to -- to do such a thing, in the psychology of\nthose times. You have to be very modest, and -- and very, innoc -- but she did it, and I remember\nthis little red box, I had it for a long time. And we were very close, really. Very close. And she\nplayed a big role in my life. She was never fanatic, she was never -- she was taking in everybody.\nAnd she was very demanding only maybe -- she was more demanding from her children than --\nyou know, such discipline then, but she was very demanding of -- to herself, but to other people\nshe was much more -- much softer. Yeah, you wanted to ask me about --",
        "Q: About the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But just to finish this, and you stayed there until -- until --",
        "A: Until she was arrested and even three months more. A-A-And she -- so it was a -- a whole\nstory when Vilnius was liberated already, they -- they -- it started to -- not liberated, but the new\noccupation, but still, I must say for me it was also liberation, because I was not any more afraid\nfor my life. And it was the liberation from Nazis, but we suffered quite -- and I myself suffered\nquite a lot from the Soviets as well. But -- but still the feeling was that now I can go out, I can --\ncan go to school and so on. So, when the bombing started it was dangerous because we lived in\nthe center, Traky -- on Traky Street. So she went out to the outskirts of Vilnius, to a friend,\nPonas Stabinis, and they wer -- he had a cellar and they would sit there in the cellar, the -- and I\nwa -- went with them. But then I decided that I have to save -- I -- to do -- have to do something\nfor her. I loved her like I can\u2019t tell you how. And so -- and we lived in -- in th -- in this big, big\nhouse and courtyard, we were probably the only Lithuanians there. So -- and all the Poles were\naround. And the Poles didn\u2019t like too much Lithuanians. And I knew very well that if we will\nleave at night during the bombing, the flat alone, it will be -- they will take everything away from\nthere. They will break in and loot the -- the -- the flat. So I wanted to -- to -- to save it. Crazy\nidea, but I wanted. So I went back for the night to Vilnius. I was -- I went to the cellar when it --\nwhen the bombs -- there was also a cellar. And I really saved everything. But it -- but one day, I\nthink it was Sunday, the fight started in the street. So I couldn\u2019t get any more daytime to them.\nSo I got stuck there for a whole week. And the m -- the har -- the street was three times, going\nfrom hands to hand, from germ -- from the German Wehrmacht to the Soviet army and -- and\nback. And there were many events there, which I have seen in the killings of -- of -- of 16 years\nold soldiers, who just without anything came down the street from Pilimond, were killed by a --\nby a German tank. Altogether 13 pen -- people, but one we -- we managed to save from there.\nBut however, it was terrible, and I heard the Poles talking, who is this la -- is she lithua -- 1s she\nLithuanian, or is he Jewish -- is she Jewish? And they were not -- and so I thought they want to\ngive me away to the Germans, or what. A-As a Lithuanian they don\u2019t like me either. They\nwanted to get the key from the flat, I didn\u2019t give it to them. But it was already too hard for me\nand on Thursday I felt that I can\u2019t take it any more and I packed two suitcases and wanted to go\non the other side of Neris, into -- in the outskirt of Vilnius where the family was. But when I had\nalready my -- my suitcases ready, the -- the fight started again, I couldn\u2019t leave. And only on\nSunday, when already the Soviet army liberated, then I -- I -- I -- I could get out and a quite\nfamous friend of [indecipherable], Conrad Eskadatskas, he was a -- a -- a com-composer and a --\na conductor and a -- a quite famous musician Lithuania. He came also to see if somebody\u2019s alive\nand then we went with him to the outskirts of Vilnius to see if they are alive. So this was a\nterrible walk through a city full of -- full of fire, full of dust, full of dead people. Terrible,\nterrible. But it was still already a little boat which took us from one side of the Neris to the other.\nAnd then we got to meet each other and -- and this was also a moment which I will never forget\nbecause she couldn\u2019t forgive her how she -- how she didn\u2019t stop me. It was -- it got quite hard to\nstop me. I was stubborn, so -- so that she was happy that we are alive and everybody in the\nfamily remembers this moment, she was happy that I came back. And then I stayed with her. I\nwent to school immediately and -- and then she was arrested in March \u201946, on the 14\" of March.\nAnd I stayed still to the end of the year that the children should finish school. And then we were\nalready spread to different homes, and -- but I was going to all the prisons and -- and bringing\nher food and taking care, and so --",
        "Q: She was imprisoned here, in Lithuania?",
        "A: Yeah, the Soviet times. The Soviet prisons.",
        "Q: And was she released?",
        "A: No, no, she was -- she was convict -- she was -- she got a sentence co -- aco -- you know,\nthey were called three people who -- who decide, the -- the Troika this was called, w-would\ndecide they -- their fate and their punishment. And so I got to know somehow that this trial will\nbe on [indecipherable] and when she was brought in I -- I was there with my two sisters from --\nfrom her family. And we got from her a little note and I got a present from her. She cut off her --\nthe end of her braid, yeah -- braid, yeah? It\u2019s long hair.",
        "Q: Hair, yes.",
        "A: Br-Br-Braid --",
        "Q: Ah, yes.",
        "A: -- how is it called, braid, o-or -- cassa. I have it, it\u2019s my [indecipherable] I have it until now\nand then she was -- a handmade serviette and a little note and -- and then the -- the -- the Russian\nsoldier who was looking after, he was quite kind, he was giving her my note and -- and giving\nback her present to me so we could communicate a little bit. And then after the sentence was\nalready announced, she was taken with [indecipherable], this is such a black car, which would\ntake the arrested people. And she was -- we saw how she was taken from the -- how she went\nfrom the building to the car.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: -- what was the sentence?",
        "A: The -- eight years at prison and then had no rights for five years to come back to Lithuania.\nSo -- no, sorry, she got 10 years. My friend Tadas got eight years. And -- and then, it was also a\nterrible moment, you know, when she was closed into this c-car, int -- into this black car, and --\nand you saw her, and she is stopped -- you are stopped to -- to communicate with her. And you\nfeel absolutely helpless. You see -- this brutal power you feel, you know, which is just violating\nyou. And I remember this was also a moment when I lost control and I was running behind this\ncar on the street just screaming, and -- but of course the car was faster than me, and couldn\u2019t do\nanything about that, but it was also a -- a moment when you felt the Soviet power, cruelty.",
        "Q: And -- and what happened to her?",
        "A: She was in prison. She was deported to -- to the sibe -- Siberia and she was there and she was\nreleased in -- in -- 1n fi -- I think after Stalin\u2019s death. She could join, but she cou -- was not\nallowed to come back. She joined there her two sons, who were also deported to Siberia, not in\nconcentration camps, but to work there. They were deported. And then in \u201956 she came back to\nLithuania.",
        "Q: And you met her?",
        "A: Yeah, of course. And she lived for 10 years and then she passed away. But she was very --\nshe was a wonderful person. She helped so many she -- people, she saved so many young girls,\nshe never complained. She never told about her suffering, she told only about how many\nwonderful people she met there, because the elite was in the concentration camps, in the gulag.\nSo she would maybe not have a chance to meet such wonderful people in ordinary life, so -- she\nwas -- she was very strong.",
        "Q: Can you say her name once again?",
        "A: Stephania ela -- Pellulitai Ledugania. She comes also from a wonderful family, her\ngrandfather was a caretaker of books. He was kig nashise. This was a -- he was bringing, you\nknow, education to Lithuania. Then the Tsar prohibited the Lithuanian alphabet and -- when it\nwas not allowed to read Lithuanian books. And her father als -- also participate. They were a\nvery, very nice family from -- from Rabalninkai, from the north of Lithuania. And her husband,\nthe general, he could also run away, together with our government in \u201940, but he said that he will\nstay with his soldiers. And of course he was immediately arrested and he was shot it seems, in\n41 or \u00b042. And he was very, also, full of dignity, he never gave in. He got seven shots 1n his\nhead. And she got to know it much later, already wi -- being in Siberia, people still live with the\nslight hope to -- to be -- to -- that their beloved are maybe still alive, you know. And yes, she told\nme also that she took me because she didn\u2019t know my parents, she didn\u2019t know anybody, I was\njust a Jewish girl, and she said that the Jewish population suffered so much here in Lithuania,\nand some Lithuanians were not so kind. So I, as a Lithuanian want to do my best. This was what\nshe said to me as well. And she before -- I learned later on that she would try to help Jews with\nfood in the ghetto. But when I came to Vilnius the ghetto was already liquidated. No sign any\nmore of the ghetto, only ruins. You wanted to ask me something about the ghetto.",
        "Q: During the period that you have been in the ghetto, was there any occasion that you had to\nhide? To hide.",
        "A: To hide?",

        "A: -- and -- but -- but still, I for instance -- people who knew my parents and my mother and\nknew that I am a -- a -- a orphan, they -- I -- I got a Jordanschein, which was a paper which like,\ngives you security that you work and -- and you -- you get -- you like, have some security, but it\ndidn\u2019t help. And m -- I got this place to work in the werkstatten after I collapsed at the airport,\nyou know. So this was done by -- by people from -- still from the altestenrat. People who knew\nmy parents. I somehow remember more good things than bad things, you know? This is in my\nnature, probably. Or it helps to survive, I don\u2019t know. I remember how my girlfriend and I, we\ndecided that we have to -- to celebrate the new year, \u201942. And I remember how one Jewish guy\ngave us -- he knew that we -- we want to do it, we had nothing, nothing to eat. So he gave us a\nlittle bagel, but very thin, wi-with a big hole. And we -- when it was 12 o\u2019clock, we were sitting\nand we were dreaming about post-war and so on. And we were talking -- her mother was also\narrested and didn\u2019t come back, never came back. And we shared this little bagel. So this man I\nremember, who gave us the bagel. This was a big thing, to give a bagel. It was like now giving\nyou, I don\u2019t know, thousand dollars.",
        "Q: Can we talk for awhile about Lithuania after the -- after the -- no, not after the war, but after\nindependence, how it 1s coping or not coping.",

        "Q: How Lithuania cope or does not cope with the part of Lithuania in -- in the Holocaust.",
        "A: You see, it is a very hard issue, and very unpleasant issue, and you have here to differentiate\nmany things. First of all you should know that in the Soviet times, nothing was really mentioned,\nand the Holocaust, if it was mentioned, was used mainly only for anti-Fascist propaganda. And\nyou couldn\u2019t even use the word Jew, it was only Soviet citizens and so on. You know that the\nSoviets destroyed finally the big synagogue in Vilna. They destroyed the famous cemetery. I\ndon\u2019t know if you have seen the -- the last pictures of that, it is really an -- and -- and they build\nhouses and -- and ste -- and -- and steps and so on out of this -- of these stones. So there was\nnothing, really, and th-the Jewish life didn\u2019t exist as such, almost. Only maybe for some\npropaganda. And -- and when we became independent and even before the independence, when\nthe Lithuanian revival started, cultural revival and -- and the -- and so on, then also started the\nJewish revival and my colleague, Professor Kudaba, here is his picture. An absolute outstanding\nperson. He was the organizer of the Lithuanian Cultural Society, and then, thanks to him all the\nminorities also organized their cultural societies and the Jewish Cultural Society was organized.\nAnd for the first time all the questions came up about the past and -- and about the future. So --\nso m -- th-th-this -- th-the situation was really m -- very complicated, complex, and you can\nunderstand that a nation who 1s, after being suppressed and occupied for so many years is\nregaining its independence and want to establish itself in the normal democratic world, it\u2019s not\nvery pleasant to talk about participation in the Holocaust. Also, I must say that it was not very --\nit was still, I must say the -- the stereotypes of the -- of the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s were still alive. That the\nJews are traitors, that Jews were communists and so on and so on. So I must say that anti-\nSemitism and the readiness to face the Holocaust was not a -- a simple question. But I must say\nthat on the official level, our government, and especially I would say Vytautas Landsbergis took\nall the really decent steps. First of all, the genocide was condemned. The -- one of the first -- it\nwas -- and it has no -- it -- the people who took part in -- in this genocide can\u2019t be -- can\u2019t be\n[speaks Lithuanian here] I don\u2019t know how to say. They -- they have ever to be, always to be\ncondemned, it doesn\u2019t depend how much time passed away past then. The -- one of the first\nthings the government did was to replace the stones in the -- on the steps of tower of Kaunas, to\ntake all these cemetery stones, gravestones away and put the o -- the other ones, not to go on\nthose [indecipherable] th-the 23\" of September, which was the day of the liquidation of the\nVilnius ghetto was announced as the day of genocide, and it was an order to -- to put out all the\nflags, Lithuanian national flags with -- with a black --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] ribbon.",
        "A: -- ribbon, yeah. The Jewish cultur -- the Jewish community was recreated and -- and\nsupported. They cemeteries were looked after and m -- I am very proud that my former student,\nVito Tostalakis was the first. He was a teacher then, he took his -- his pupils and they went to\nclean up a cemetery not far away from Vilnius. And killing places were also, bit by bit, together\nwith the Jewish community, they were cleaned and looked after. And of course, Jews got all the\nrights ar -- citizens and Lithuanians have absolutely equal rights. That --that\u2019s absolutely a matter\nof fact that I would say that maybe a little bit weaker was the question of conde -- of the trials,\nyou know, this Lileikis and so on, but I must still say that on the official level, everything was --\nwas quite okay. And m -- on the academic level, the breakthrough started pro-probably from 795,\nsomething, \u201996. And I look -- came up and there were, especially our young historians, of middle\nage historians were ready to face the truth and -- and more and more information came up about\nthe Holocaust. So I th -- and now we have really already a changed situation on the level of the\n[indecipherable] intellectuals and with -- and not only a civil society is now really a lot\nparticipating already in -- in facing this question. You know that Lithuanian in-intelligentsia\ncreated the house of memory, which is working 1n this direction and -- and they -- they\nannounced already four times a competition, who were the Jewish neighbors -- for schools.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Who were the Jewish neighbors of my grand and grand-grand parents. So the children are\ncoming out through all Lithuania, to the little cities and finding out who lived here. And so they\ngo back to history [indecipherable] and -- and learning from -- from this terrible history. And I\nmust say that we made now about 700 schools -- 700 teachers are working with the Holoto-caust\ntopics. Holocaust is told in the military s -- academy, and in military schools and the military\nacademy. A lot 1 -- we have a lot of educational centers who are dealing with that -- with that\nissue. And really hundred, hundred of schools and pupils. We have now, you know, that\nAdamkus created the commission to investigate crimes of Nazi times and gu -- Nazi crimes and\nthe gulag. And we have their commission which also published and found out a lot. I must say\nthat our genocide center, which was first of all like dealing only with the anti-Soviet movement\nis now more and more facing also the Holocaust situation. So I would say that on the academic\nlevel it is -- and such educational level, there is already a breakthrough and a dialog. A lot is\nreally done. I must also say that when Respublika, for instance, published the article of the chief\neditor of the newspaper, a terrible article, \u201cWho rules the world?\u201d And the answer was the Jews\nand the gays. You heard, probably, about this article. So what -- not everybody remembers, but\nyou should remember that the first protest was done by the Lithuanian NGOs, Lithuanian\norganizations and Lithuanian individuals. And during two days, this protest against Tomkus\u2019s\nwriting was signed by about a hundred organizations, about a hundred individual peoples and\nmuch more would sign it if it would -- we would keep -- not me, we -- I didn\u2019t, they didn\u2019t even\nallowed me to sign because I am Jewish. Only Lithuanians signed it, really. So that on --\norganizations, not only individual peoples. So it is really a breakthrough and sometimes you\nshould not forget that it takes time to -- to -- but -- but anti-Semitism is still there and still -- it --\nyou can\u2019t say that it\u2019s all over.",
        "Q: In all this positive picture that you just portrayed --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s so positive that it may seem a bit unbalanced. The educational activity, the academic\nactivity. Is it -- is it put 1n focus, th-the -- the fact that those who murdered the Jews in Lithuania\nmer -- were mainly Lithuanians, or just the Germans --",
        "A: You see, it -- no, no, no, they -- everybody -- it is hard to recognize, it\u2019s not so easy, but -- but\npeople more and more recognize that some Lithuanians really, they were the executors. Ma -- not\nalways, but mainly. But the initiators of that still were the Germans, the Nazis. And this is also\nclear. You -- this is also a mistake when you put everything only on the shoulders of the -- of\nLithuania. The -- the worst thing is that Lithuanian independence was declared. It lasted only for\nsix weeks, and the administration of -- of -- which had never real power, is temporary\ngovernment, didn\u2019t really know to do a lot about saving Jews. Let us put it openly. So this 1s\nreally when you can ta -- maybe speak about some responsibility. But otherwise they were\nauxiliaries. They helped. Lithuanians helped but I wouldn\u2019t say that -- that it was done without,\nabsolutely without Nazi encouraging. And as you know, in Yager\u2019s -- in Yager\u2019s report, it 1s said\nthat the -- the Nazis could never succeed so well if they couldn\u2019t find so helpful Lithuanian\nauxiliaries, yeah. The partisans who helped them. But -- but still they don\u2019t deny that they were -\n- and they had the full control -- this is what Yager says, from the second of July, they had full\ncontrol of all the executions.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: Do you --",
        "A: So they -- they -- it was -- you know, here I -- I must say that I know that I -- I don\u2019t -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t justify killings and so on, but I think that Jews are sometimes too much inclined to blame\nonly Lithuanians. Because they saw like Lithuanians blamed Jews that they made the\ndeportation. It\u2019s just a mytho -- mythology. Jews had no power to make it. This was done by\nMoscow, by the K -- by the NK VD, by the -- by -- by very few Jews and even there were some\nthat were mainly -- mainly executors. But if a Lithuanian saw a Jew coming, so okay, the Jew is\ndeported then, yeah?",
        "Q: But it\u2019s not by the same token because the Lithuanian did have guns and we know that about\n15,000 Lithuanians took part personally in killing and shooting the Jews. This we know.",
        "A: But they were organized. No, not 15,000, it\u2019s less now. Vu -- vu-vu -- but I don\u2019t want to\nargue about figures, but I want to say that Lithuanians -- Lithuanians were in a terrible situation.\nIn a terrible situation. Here deported, it was a shock to the whole nation. Influenced by a terrible\nNazi propaganda, which was also taken as a tool by Luff and by some Lithuanian officials, yeah.\nThen, I must say that the past, the -- the antagonistic past which existed between Christians and\nJews also had some role to play. So I -- but -- but the nation was really in a shocking -- in a\nterrible -- in a terrible state at this very moment. And it was really, in some way in the beginning\n[indecipherable] and then it came, of course it\u2019s dirty business. But -- but I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t blame\n-- I will never blame a nation because I know that people were absolutely shocked by what\nhappened [indecipherable]",
        "Q: But I\u2019m not talking about the nation.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: I\u2019m talking about few thousand of killers.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Many of them are still alive now in Lithuania.",
        "A: No, no, not many. Not many. How can you say many\u201d? There are not many alive, and -- and\nmaybe -- of course they were -- they\u2019re somewhere hidden. I wouldn\u2019t say that our procurator or\nour court is very much interesting to persecute them. But -- and this is maybe the weakest point,\nbut not only we have problems with our -- with our court and with our procurators, not only in\nthe Jewish commission, in others as well. So, I think, you know, really that --",
        "Q: How much we have?",
        "A: Finished?",
        "Q: He says that it\u2019s finished. I would like to thank you very much. Sorry the -- always we have\nmore to say and I-less time.",
        "A: Yeah, but we stopped at a very -- a very -- a very important point.",
        "Q: So I -- we should put another tape. [tape break] So we were talking about the question of how\nLithuania is coping with it --its past.",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t know how I succeeded, but I tried to explain you the -- how complicated the\nsituation was. And you see, being Jewish, and here is really -- this is very important, that -- and I\nsuffered myself, and Jewish people suffered so much from generalization, from accusing. If one\nJew is bad, all the Jews are so, and so on and so on. So I can\u2019t do it to anybody, you see. And I\nthink that we have to understand, of course in a different degree, but Lithuanians and the Jews\nare victims of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. Lithuanians are also victims, because their\ndeportation to Siberia, the -- the -- the terrible historical period after the second World War,\nwhen Lithuania was still fighting for 1ts independence, and of course it is a very controversial\nmoment. But -- but we have to take it also in account. You -- you can\u2019t see only your own\nsuffering, you see? And therefore, I am very happy I did not -- I didn't want to make you a -- a\npicture that now in Lithuania everything is solved. But a German historian, Joachim Tauber, a\nvery good friend of mine, he told me that in Germany it took 30 years from discussions on the\nacademic level to the conscious of the people to recognize what happened. So, it is also -- we\nhave to be a little bit patient. We can\u2019t -- we can\u2019t, you know, impose this terrible thing, I think it\nwas the biggest tragedy in Lithuanian history, the Holocaust. And I think that for me the\nGermans, th-the Nazis are even worse enemies than the Soviets, why? Because the -- the Soviets,\nwe were still -- Lithuania could -- could resist the Soviets. And -- and -- and they didn\u2019t take\naway the honor of the nation. And the Nazis in this -- in those times, they made out of some\nLithuanian, killers. So you lose your -- it\u2019s hard for me, it is very sensitive, everything, so in -- in\nEnglish it\u2019s very -- quite hard for me to explain it. But you understand, maybe, what I mean.",
        "Q: I understand what you mean and it\u2019s very difficult for me to hear such a sentence, the Nazis\nmade out of some Lithuanians killers.",
        "A: Yeah, they made the situation which --",
        "Q: Really, the kil -- th-the killers who were Lithuanians joined the Nazis, the German Nazis --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and took the opportunity to murder Jews and to loot their property. Why didn\u2019t they --\nweren\u2019t they brought to justice? Really, if Lithuania is so positive --",
        "A: No, no, many people were brought to justice. First of all, there were Soviet trials --",
        "Q: The Soviet trials --",
        "A: Yeah, there were Soviet trials, which you can\u2019t trust hundred percent.",
        "Q: But -- but I was asking only after the independence, because --",
        "A: I told you that 1 -- during the independence it 1s not -- it is the weakest point.",
        "Q: It\u2019s the weakest point.",
        "A: It\u2019s the weakest point, yeah. It is the weakest point. That\u2019s I must -- I -- I must -- I -- I have to\nadmit. But according to the law they have to be sentenced. And you know how it is very strange,\nbut sometimes it\u2019s probably now you can\u2019t prove there are not enough businesses, I don\u2019t know\nwhat, but of course I would -- I would -- as a Lithuanian I would take the trial those people and I\nwould recognize -- I think that you -- only when you recognize the whole truth, then you are\nliberated, see? But -- but you can\u2019t also impose all the time, on -- on another nation what -- this is\na -- a thing which has to grow out of the nation itself, not imposed by anybody.",
        "Q: If at -- if at all.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: If at all. If the nation is capable of --",
        "A: I think that every nation, and we have already enough people who are capable and are taking -\n- Brazauskas even went to Israel and apologized, and he was attacked here for that. But now\nmore and more people understand that maybe he was right. You see, it takes time, it -- I see, in\nthe 14 years already, a big breakthrough. I see also the positive things. And I think that if you\nwant to achieve something, you have to think in positive terms. You can\u2019t accuse all the time\npeople who have already nothing to do with that, you see?",
        "Q: Well --",
        "A: And I [indecipherable] for instance, I will -- for me, Holocaust will always be a thing which I\nwill never forget, and I think as a Jewish person I will memorize it. But I don\u2019t want to impose\non others to memorize it. That has to be -- in Israel is had to be memorized forever, but here it\ncan -- it is already a question of -- of the people -- of the local people. And I will tell you,\nrecently I was invited to Siauliai for a talk about tolerance. And I had a big audience, over a\nhundred people, different people, and you know that Siauliai is a city where Murza 1s located, he\nis the new Lithuanian neo-Nazi, Lithuanian fascist. And I got a question, I don\u2019t know if you\nheard about that, that -- that m -- during Christmas, next to the Christmas tree was standing a\nmenorah because last year Hanukah and Christmas was almost the same time. And Murza with\nhis guys came and sir -- oversi -- and -- and crashed this menorah, he was destroying it. So they\nasked me what I think about that. So I answered them like that. You see -- you understand that I\nhave two identities. I am Jewish and I am Lithuanian citizen. And as a Jew, I wouldn\u2019t even put\non the main square, the menorah. I would put the menorah in a place which was maybe a Jewish\nplace or a synagogue, and I would remember and -- and -- th-the day somehow very -- very\nmodest. But as a Lithuanian I would be very happy that the menorah stays next to the tree,\nbecause there are no any more Jews here. There are no any more people can light the candle.\nThere are no people who can be memorized by somebody because there are no Jews any more.\nSo as a Lithuanian, I would like to memorize -- I would happy to ca -- to light the candle for the -\n- my killed compatriots. So you -- can you imagine the -- the reaction was I got applause. And\npeople came then and said that -- thank you.",
        "Q: You know, this is a very nice thing to say, what you just described. I wonder if you could\nhave said such a thing as a Lithuanian, unless you were also a Jew.",
        "A: Lam. I am double. I am double.",

        "A: No, there are --",
        "Q: -- you have chosen --",
        "A: -- oh yes, I can give you names of Lithuanians who would say the same, and even more than I\nsaid, because I am still careful, and they would not be careful, they would be much more critical\nabout Lithuanians. I can name such people like Iapramus Markos, Iacunis Markos, Avido\nTostalaikias, Iakeenos Verjunas. Like Ludas Troska, like Guidos Alexandravichas. I can --",
        "Q: Of course, I --",

        "A: -- yeah. Vytautas Landsbergis told it.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure about --",
        "A: He said Vytaus Landsbergis [indecipherable] many years ago that the -- the Holocaust is not\nany more a Jewish problem, it\u2019s a Lithuanian problem. None of -- there are a lot, but not\neverybody wants to hear it. I will give you another example.",

        "Q: Anti-Lithuanian.",
        "A: Non -- non -- no -- non -- anti-Lithuanian and non-sensitive. And I really don\u2019t agree with\nthat. I will give you another example. Yo -- yud -- yudka -- Judel Bayli -- Baylis who was\nalready twice going through all Lithuanian scho -- many Lithuanian schools to talk about his\nstory, and meet with children. And he was always nicely very met, because he is really -- he\u2019s an\n-- he is a goodhearted person.",
        "Q: He\u2019s a charming person.",
        "A: Charming person, yeah. And once after his talk, a Lithuanian boy came and he said -- he\nasked him -- he was almost in tears, he said, Ponas Baylisi -- Mr. Baylis, my grandfather was sh -\n- was a Jew killer, what should I do? What should I do? Because he was shocked by all that,\nwhat he said. So he embraced him, he kissed him and he told him, you have already done. You\nun -- realize it, you understand it. You are not guilty, you can\u2019t be guilty. And the -- and they\nseparated as friends, you see? He didn\u2019t -- or I can give you another example of my experience. I\ntook in a Lithuanian girl to live, just -- she li -- she lived [indecipherable] I was asked by my\nfriends to take her in. And in Lithuania really aba -- almost everybody was told that the Jews are\nusing blood for matzos. And she lived with me and after half a year she told me that she was told\nshe shouldn\u2019t go to live with a Jewish woman, because she always will have some blood on her\nbody, Christian blood. And -- and th -- sh -- now I must admit, she said, that I was watching you\nall the time. I was watching through the keyhole when you were in the bathroom if you had\nblood or not. And now I know that you don\u2019t have it. So I also embraced her. I told her, my dear\nfriend, I\u2019m happy that you realize now that there are a lot of mythology. I don\u2019t accuse you\nbecause if 1t was told -- y-you were told by your grandmother or by your mother, or by your aunt\nabout that, why shouldn\u2019t you believe them? Why should you believe me? But now I am very\nhappy that -- so you -- you -- you didn\u2019t commit a crime. But now you know, and you can say to\nthe others that this is not true.",

        "A: There is no other way. You know, Sisyphus, he was pushing the stone up the hill, always\nknowing that the stone will fall down. But still he did it because he had no other way to live. So I\nhave also no other way to live. And if I can help one soul, one person to get rid of hatred and to\nget rid of suspicion and -- and understand another -- we -- we speak always all -- we have to\nunderstand the other, that we shouldn\u2019t be always treated as the other, but we ourselves are\ntreating very often the others as the others. I can tell you another story of a family, I can even\nmention the name, it\u2019s William Good, who was jumping out of the Paneru -- Paneru pit, he was\nshot, but he was alive and he escaped and then he survived, also helped by Christian people, but\nin the woods. And -- and his wife is also a Polish wil -- a -- a Jew from Vilna, a Polish orient --\nmore oriented than Lithuanian. And he was also from Vilna and they had a lot of prejudice\nagainst Lithuanians because for them -- I understand it also, because after the war I was even\nasked by people, how can you live in a -- in a country which is soaked with blood, with Jewish\nblood? So -- and they were so full of -- of -- of I don\u2019t know, fi -- some feelings, anti-Lithuanian\nfeelings. And then I told them that you can\u2019t generalize it. There are such wonderful Lithuanian\npeople. Such wonderful people. And I brought them into a family of wonderful Lithuanian\npeople and they came and they talked and they shared and they were, you know, even crying\ntogether. And when we went out, Parella, the wife of William Good told me, Irena, thank you\nvery much. You take from us away the burden of hatred. I think hatred is the most terrible thing.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I was very lucky to be born in a wonderful family, in a wealthy family. I had really a\nwonderful childhood, except maybe that my parents get divorced in \u201938, which was, of course, a\nvery big shock to me. My father left Lithuania, remarried later on, and I stayed with my mother\nin Kaunas. I -- I was probably a quite good pupil. My father sent me to a Yiddish school Shalom\nAleichem gymnasium, which was famous. They had very good teachers, and it was a left wing\nschool, I would say, which was shaped by Yiddishes -- by the Yiddishists and not by sci --\nZionists. And the people --",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Mis -- yeah, but my -- my parents were already out of the shtetl, they were European educated\npeople. My mother finished [indecipherable] schule in Berlin. My father got his education in\nHamburg, and th -- and so they were not religious, but were very tolerant. My grandparents -- I\nhad -- had only my grandparent -- parents from my mother\u2019s side, so they were quite m -- they\ncame out of Bapte my father was a milkman, like Tevya from Shalom Aleichem. Was really a\nwonderful, wonderful man. I think he influenced the whole family a lot, with his very open-\nminded and -- views and with his goodness.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, okay. And -- and I was educated respecting them very much and very much respecting\ntheir belief, and I would go every Friday for kiddush, to -- to meet Saturday and I was attending\nthere all day, of course holidays and Rosh Hashanah and -- and especially Easter, where I played\na big role under the table, looking for [indecipherable]",

        "A: Their Jewish holidays.",
        "A: Because in our house we didn\u2019t celebrate it, we especially. So I felt it more tha -- as the -- a-as\nthe tradition of my grandparents, which was very nice and respected. But I had also in my\nchildhood a Christmas tree.",
        "A: Because ma -- not because it was for relig -- religious purposes, that my parents was -- were\nsaying that you can take from other people the best they have, and they wouldn\u2019t like me to be\nenvious of other children who have this tree and get their different presents. So I had also a\nChristmas tree and our home was very international. We had very many guests, Lithuanians and\nRussians and -- from all over the world, friends who would come and visit us. So my parents\nspoke already -- except English probably, all European languages, French, German, Polish,\nRussian. So -- no, my -- my parents told me that you have always to speak the language that\neverybody understands, if you can. So I was multilingual from childhood. I was speaking from\nmy -- my native languages were two, Lithuanian, and Russian, I spoke from childhood. And then\nwhen I was five years old I had something with my lungs and I was sent to S-Switzerland, to\nArosa in a sanitorium, where I stayed for almost a year, and then I forgot all languages. I came\nback not speaking Lithuanian and not speaking Russian, but speaking only German. And I\nremember that I went with my parents to Moscow, my father had his family there and m-my\nuncle made me a present, such a sewing machine, a children\u2019s sewing machine. And it 1s in\nRussian shvaina mashina. So I was told that -- that -- then the joke was that I answered the\n[speaks Russian here], I don\u2019t want a big mach-machine, yeah. So this only proves that I really\ndidn\u2019t speak any more Russian, but of course the languages came back very fast. And when I\nwas sent to the Shalom Aleichem gymnasium, to the yeshida school, I didn\u2019t speak Yiddish, but I\nlearned it quite fast. And I -- but the -- the beginning was not so good because I didn\u2019t speak so\nwell Yiddish, so my classmates would call me the intelligentka. So --",

And my -- I\nmust say that, for instance, my Lithuanian, I am really literate in Lithuanian. I write in\nLithuanian well, and I learned -- I spoke from childhood, but I learned really the language and\nthe writing in this Jewish school. Bu -- and my -- my teacher was [indecipherable].

        "A: And but she was -- in the school she was an exception, because she was a Zionist. But\nbecause she was a very good teacher, she was kept in the school. And my father had also\nillusions, left winged illusions. He was a rich man in Kaunas and he had his own house, he has\nhis own business. But he was -- he was dreaming about social justice, and as you know, in the\n30\u2019s, many European, not only Lithuanian intellectuals, had this illusion that the Soviet Union is\nmaybe the solution. And maybe they are giving equal rights to everybody. So he insisted that a --\nI go to this school. All my cousins went to Lithuanian school.",
        "A: He was a salon communist, I would say. Not a communist, but a left wing salon. He was\nhelping people who were in trouble. He was paying, I think, money for Mopar -- for the -- this\nwas an organization who has collected money for the political prisoners in -- in those times.

And all his chil -- sons became revolutionaries, so he got sick\nof it, fed up with it and he decided, the youngest son, to send to -- to study in Germany, that he\nshouldn\u2019t become a revolutionary. But my -- they were really -- you -- you should very much\ndistinguish the revolutionaries of those times with the Stalin times, because they were -- they\nreally thought it was an utopias, you know, and an utopia, that\u2019s socialism, and communism will\nbring social justice, equality and so on. And it ended that one brother of my father was arrested\nin \u00b037 and killed by Stalin. A-And -- because he was a too honest man, he was a quite known\nperson. He was the director of [speaks Lithuanian here] this is fiction literature, it\u2019s a big, big\npublishing house. And he was also then later on the director of the medicine -- is that me-medical\npublishing house. Well, he was accused so, and he was killed. He was arrested in ?37. And my\nother uncle who was a professor, he never joined the party again after the Bolsheviks came to\npower because he saw what happened in the Crimea. He spend the time of the civil war in\nCrimea and he saw what the -- really the Bolsheviks are like, and he never joined the party. He\nhad his own story, which I don\u2019t know if we have time to tell you now, but very interesting, that\nhe never told me, really, the truth he knew.",
        "A: When I came -- yeah, when I came, because everybody was afraid then. And only when he\nwas already quite -- qui -- after -- after Khrushchev\u2019s letter, this -- in -- on the -- in \u201956, when\nStalin was really -- it was opened up what he did, he told me that he knew it all, because he also\nknew -- he was a friend of Krupska, Lenin\u2019s wife, who was also persecuted by Stalin and the\nwhole -- all -- all -- this whole regime on -- and the -- the -- what -- what happened in \u201937, he had\nno illusions.

So when the first\nWorld War started, and you know that Lithuania was under the Tsarist regime, so he was a rush -\n-ar--acitizen of Russia. So he went back with lot -- with lot of adventures, and he was even\narrested by the Bolsheviks as a German spy. And just by miracle he -- his life was saved and he\ncame back to Kaunas and his father was already in Kaunas. He was the owner of [speaks\nLithuanian here], it was a lottery.

I don\u2019t\nknow if you heard, there was such a -- a textbook shap -written by a Lithuanian historian,\nShapulka, who really mythologized the Lithuanian history.

But in \u201938 he took me, and I spent two months\nwith him and we were in Switzerland, in Belgium, in France and in Berlin. Mm -- and I got my\nwonderful bicycle, which was very famous in -- in Kaunas. Probably one of the first bicycles\nwith gears, you know.",
        "A: 38 I was in Berlin, yeah.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: This is what I wanted to tell you, that 1t was wonderful because I -- we were Lithuanian\ncitizens and we were not -- we w -- were not under the Hitler\u2019s law, and we got even -- but my\nfather told me when we -- we lived on kuf -- Kurftirstendamm and we got for breakfast, for\ninstance, a -- a little britchen, a -- a -- no, a piece of white bread with butter, with -- or margarine\nand marmalade and my father told me that the Germans don\u2019t receive it, and the Jews definitely\nnot, because it is very hard now and they are preparing a war. And then my pa -- father took me\nto the street Unter den Linden which was the main street on the Brandenburger Tor, and -- and\nth-there were -- there were normal benches. I think they were white, but I don\u2019t remember, but I\nremember the yellow benches. And my father told me that you are not obliged to sit on the\nyellow bench because you are not a German citizen. But you are Jewish and this is benches\nwhere Jews are sitting. They are excluded, they are discriminated, and I want you to get the\nfeeling how it is like to sit on such a bench. So we were sitting, I remember it very well. And can\nyou imagine that in 2004, when we joined European Union, I was speaking at the Brandenburger\nTor, to the crowds because when the enlargement of the European Union happened, I was\nspeaking in the name of representing my country, Lithuania, and -- and I -- I -- I finished my\nspeech with a personal remark, that you see how time changed? I\u2019m speaking from the place,\nbehind is the Reichstag, where I was doomed to die, to be killed, and now I am representing and\ntalking to you, representing the country. It also proves -- it\u2019s a si -- symbolic, for me very\nimportant proofs how times have changed. It was a -- a -- I must say it was a big moment in my\nlife, it was successful, my speech, so I was very happy. But, of course you feel -- the first time\nwhen I was in Berlin after the war I feel very stel -- felt very strange, staying at the Reichstag.",
        "A: Yeah.",

But I don\u2019t know\ndetails, but I know that they were around.",
        "A: Yes, yes of course. I was very curious. I was called in the family alticope, and -- and th-the --\nit means that I am a old cop -- a old head, because I was always interested and I was such like\nresponsible person. And so I was interested and I heard it, yes.",
        "A: It made a terrible impression. It -- 1t raised my fear.",
        "A: The people had to leave their homes, everything and -- and just became refugees and got\nstuck. And I didn\u2019t know, but later on I learned that they -- many -- very many of them got stuck\nin Lithuania and of course they were killed made -- mainly. And -- in the Holocaust, but some of\nthem were saved by Sugihara, and the hol -- the Dutch also, cons -- council -- c-con -- consul.\nAmbassador.",
        "A: Yeah. I was very afraid. It was really a nightmare, this -- it was like, you know, like hanging\nover -- over the heads.",
        "A: Yes, of course.",
        "A: Well, she\u2019s -- she tried to -- to comfort me, but I don\u2019t remember exactly, you know. I\nremember many conversations with my mother, but I don\u2019t remember exactly what we were\nspeaking. But I know the only one thing, that my mother wanted to leave Kaunas. And she asked\nmy father to pay her the alimentay -- I don\u2019t know, the money he has to pay her after the divorce,\nin currency that she could leave the country. But it was maybe not only of -- out of fear, but also\nthose times very few people were divorced. And my mother was a quite -- my father was q -- my\nfamily was a quite known family. So I think she didn\u2019t feel very well, in this little town, you\nknow, where everybody was talking about the divorce and -- and she was somehow -- maybe she\nfelt humiliated. And she was in Sweden and a German refugee who got a affidavit to go to\nAmerica wanted to marry my mother and take her -- take her out. And because it was already\nvery tense, I can imagine what the adults were -- were already talking about this -- those times,\nmy mother decided that she is not coming back, but I should go to Stockholm. And a ticket, air\nticket was bought, and we had a very good friend, Monsieur Dumaniel who was a -- a -- mm -- a\ncons -- con -- consul -- a ambassador of France and Lithuania and then he was transferred to\nHelsinki, but he stayed friends with my mother. My mother was beloved by everybody, really.\nShe had lots -- many, many friends, was -- and I sh -- I had to go to Helsinki and then he would\ntake me to Stockholm and then we would go to America. And I was -- that was the first of\nSeptember, and my uncle brought me to the -- to the airport [indecipherable] in Kaunas and I was\nwaiting for the airplane to came. And I went through customs. I remember like today I had talc\npowder, how the customer took a knife and -- and cut this little box to see if I have in gold there\nor something else. And -- and I was waiting, but the airplane never came, because it\u2019s the first\nday of war, and the airplane was supposed to come from Warsaw. So -- so I got back and when --\nand then my mother came also back. And this was fatal.",
        "A: No, the war -- the -- the -- yeah, it was the first of September \u00b039.",
        "A: So, my mother wanted to leave, and probably she had also reason to leave because we all felt\nthat we are trapped. We -- my mother didn\u2019t -- my mother was much less left winged than my\nfather.",
        "A: But -- but -- but didn\u2019t work out.",

        "A: Yeah, the Soviets came. The Soviet Russians came. I know it is [indecipherable] -- it 1s stupid\nbecause nobody is following me, but -- but still I feel better when I do [indecipherable]",
        "A: Mm, yeah.",

        "A: -- if you -- if you want to be very precise, yes.",
        "A: Oh, life changed a lot. First of all we were thrown out from our flat, and we had to share a flat\nwith another family. We had two rooms and the other family had one room. And we had to share\nthe kitchen, which was very unusual for us, of course. My mother didn\u2019t work and this was good,\nmaybe. She went to work. She was educated, she -- she was quite capable woman and she\nworked in the narcomat of trade. So she started to work. And -- and immediately rumors went\non, and th-th-this person 1s arrested, th-that person is arrested. Life changed. But still I was at\nschool. I believe that maybe this is for justice. That -- that still maybe I\u2019d -- I was not so m-\nmature in my political views as I-I was later, but -- but still I m -- I was not -- I personally -- it\naffected very much the life of the adults, but not so much maybe my own life, because I went to\nschool, I fought with the Zionists there, I don\u2019t know. And so, it [indecipherable] stupid, but it\nwas. I was never religious so I never experienced luck of -- of the possibility to -- to practice\nreligion. I also -- can you imagine that about the religious schools, the famous Lithuania, I got to\nknow only probably in the -- after our independence, when I was sent -- I wa -- I got a fellowship\nin Oxford, and I was in [indecipherable] and I learned really what Lithuania means for Jewish\nculture and religious culture and so on. Because we were very far aw-away from this yeshiva --\nyeshi botnikas and the [indecipherable] and all that. And the school was also not closed to\nreligion. So --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t say that it -- the war was already here. The war started on the 22\" of June, \u201941.\nBut there was already a lot of things happening. Don\u2019t forget that in those times parents were\neven afraid to talk to children openly, because the children could say something at school and\nthen you will be arrested. So there was no such open communication with the parents on all\ntopics. And I wouldn\u2019t say that I heard a lot, but I know for instance, when deportations started,\nmy mother was very, very upset and she -- she was -- she was helping people, her -- Lithuanian\npeople who were also Jewish people, but also Lithuanians. She worked with, and -- as much as\nshe could -- as she knew. And she was very, very, very unhappy about what happened. And I\nremember also my mother, on the 15\" of June \u201940, when the tanks came in. And this -- I\nremember my mother sitting so, at the table. And she was very upset that some Jewish people\nwent out in the streets to greet the Soviet army, the Soviet tanks. And 1-it was even, I must say\nfor -- for historical truth, that my mother called them interveldnikas, who went out in the street,\nbecause it was not loyal, it was --",
        "A: No, they\u2019re -- you know.",
        "A: Yeah. The -- the people who are the lowest.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t go there, no. But you see, this is a very complicated question, this Jewish and\nLithuanian reaction to those times, because it was quite clear after, that we are trapped between\ntwo super powers. And it is also absolutely obvious, and it couldn\u2019t be different, that for\nLithuanians, maybe still the ger -- e-e-especially after the deportation, that for the Lithuanians\nstill, the Germans are better, and for the Jews are still the Soviets better. And I learned now\nrecently, I was calling our institute of resistance on genocide, and I ask them how many people\nwere deported, and how many people came back from Siberia. So I was told that in \u201941, the last\ninformation is 17,000. After the war it was hundred -- about 130,000. So -- including the Jews,\nwho were also deported. So, as a whole, about 150,000. Now, from the people who were\ndeported in 1941, only about 20 percent came back, but from the people -- but these are so not\nvery precise figures. And fa -- from the people who were deported in -- after the war, until \u201951 or\n\u201950 -- I don\u2019t know how long, think un-until \u201951, or maybe *53, I don\u2019t remember now exactly,\nthe deportation -- 70 percent came back. From the Holocaust very few people came back, so it\nwas still even better in -- in the -- for -- for Jews it\u2019s a paradox, but in some way they were saved.\nAnd for instance our -- such a Jewish writer, Josade, he saved his parents from deportation and\nhe could -- he suffered his whole life. Actually, you made a film about him, he suffered his\nwhole life, that he really killed his parents because he saved them from the Soviet deportation.\nThey got killed in -- in the Holocaust. So it 1s -- yeah. But, also among the Lithuanian, I would\nsay, intellige -- intelligentsia, among the loudeninke, this was the m-m -- the Volksparte1, the --\nno, they were not socialists, but close to socialists. So they were thinking, what\u2019s better, the\nGermans or the Soviets? And they decided better the Soviets. Why? Because under Germany,\nunder the German governance, for instance, Prussia disappeared. No -- no -- no traces of Prussia\nany more. And under the Tsarist time, which was 200 years, we not only didn\u2019t disappear, but we\ndeveloped our, in Lithuania, the resistance movement. The -- the -- re-revival of the nation. So,\nthat e -- we will -- we will be able to resist the Russian -- the Russian -- the -- the Soviet, and\nbetter not to deal with the -- with the Germans. Then also, some people, they\u2019re fascinated, like\nfor instance, Paletskis, or -- or Vanslovar, or Kemontite or Gregorouskas, or other people, they\nwere fascinated by the official [indecipherable], and they thought that even if we join the Soviet\nUnion, we will still stay a Lithuanian republic, and we will have our national culture and rights.\nSo it was, you know -- but after the deportations, then of course, the -- the Wehrmacht, the\nGerman army was met by Lithuanians with flowers. So -- but that\u2019s also understandable, because\nit was like saving from the deportation to Siberia. Was a very complicated situation, and is very\ninteresting that in Poland -- you know the story with the [indecipherable] where Poles killed, not\n-- not -- not Nazis, but Poles killed. So it is also in the region where the Soviets were before,\nwhere the deportations took place, and so on, you see? Then there is also another such moment,\nwhich can\u2019t be forgotten. Of course in -- in -- in Lithuania, the Jews had cultural autonomy and --\nautonomy and so on, but it was not such an absolutely equal situation for everybody. Jews\ncouldn\u2019t take government positions, high up positions in the army. They served in the army, but\nnot on high -- or very few of them became officers and so on. And they didn\u2019t feel like equal\ncitizens of Lithuania, but the in -- the independence times was only 20 years, that\u2019s a very short\ntime. And when the Soviets came, so they declared that everybody\u2019s equal, and quite a few Jews\ngot into the administration, got into, you know, official positions. I -- I -- sorry -- and -- and it\nwas like an illusion that now we are equal. But this was absolutely illusion. And i -- and I must\nsay ma -- but I came now -- come now a little bit back, my uncle, the brother of my mother,\nJorge Stromas is -- was a very, very educated person, he got his education in France and he came\nback and he had an official position in the -- in -- in the Ministry of Finance, and was very, of\ncourse, helpful, but then he had to leave it, because he was Jewish. So, you see, he was still a -- a\nvery much -- he was a [indecipherable] because he lacked very much the language and so on. But\n-- but still, he was not completely equal, even such a person as he, who was a -- so, it was very\ncomplicated. I don\u2019t know if I expressed myself clearly now.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The -- th-the danger, the feeling of danger was present all the time, and of course everybody\nwas shocked with the Soviet German pact, with the Nazi pa -- you know -- not --",
        "A: -- oh, Ribbentrop-Molotov pact.",
        "A: And in -- in the Soviet Union people who would say something against Hitler were arrested,\nyou know. So it was a quite -- quite confusing situation. But of course, you know, people are\noptimistic and -- and still the war came unexpected, the bombing.",
        "A: F-For me, of course.",
        "A: I was at home. My mother was operated in -- in the hospital Raudonas Kryzius, the Red\nCross, by Professor Kanauka. She had the very, very serious operation which -- which ended\nvery well, and she will be okay, but -- on the 16\" of June. So she was in hospital and I was at\nhome. It was not very far, we lived not very far away from the hospital. And suddenly I woke up\nand I hear some, you know, like thunder. I didn't understand what\u2019s happening. And then I don\u2019t\nremember who told me that it\u2019s the -- the war. I was -- I -- I don\u2019t remember who told me, but I\nknow that quite a long time we didn\u2019t -- no, hours, it\u2019s not days, but hours, and then I think\nMolotov made the speech that the war is started. And then I was -- I was go -- going to my\nmother --",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Yes, yes, we had the radio. And I -- I went to my mother and I stayed in the hospital, because\nI was afraid to be alone. And I tried to make myself useful and to help, because there were\nimmediately wounded injured people coming in. And -- and I stayed with my mother there, I\nhelped a little bit the nurses there, too. And then on Monday it was already clear that -- that the\nSoviets are withdrawing, are leaving. And on Tuesday the bicyclists -- no, the mo-motociklistai,\nhow you say it, the --",
        "A: Mo -- yeah, moto -- came the -- the -- the Wehrmacht, they ca --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, they came already in, they were already in. And my mother was immediately\ntransferred to a different room. A much worse room than she had. And there were such -- on\nMonday, a young Lithuanian boy opposite the hospital was raising the Lithuanian flag, and the\ntanks were still going out at this next --",
        "A: The Soviet tanks. And when they saw that he\u2019s raising the flag, they wanted -- they shot at\nhim, but he was not killed, he was wounded. And then he was taking in as a hero into the\nhospital and everybody was taking care of him. And -- and then the -- the Soviet tanks wanted to\nshot into this hospital. This is -- you know, this is [speaks foreign language here] what -- what --\nwhere -- where it is -- and -- and m -- and they -- they turned, they -- the tank turned the --",
        "A: -- the gun against the windows, and I remember how the -- the Russian -- the Soviet soldiers,\nthey ra -- they [indecipherable] to hand up and they were crying brazi, brazi [indecipherable]\nbrothers, brother, don\u2019t shoot here, we -- we are here.",
        "A: The wound -- th-the -- the --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And then they -- they left, they didn\u2019t shot, so we stayed alive. But on Thursday,\nmy mother was arrested. A BaltaraiStininkas, a partisan, so called -- we called them\nBaltaraistininkai came to arrest my mother.",
        "A: From the hospital. But Professor Kanauka was so n-nice and he said that now she is a patient,\nso she belongs to me and you can\u2019t take her, because she can\u2019t even walk. But -- and she was\nkept in the hospital until Sunday. But, under the supervision of a BaltaraiStininkas. And of course\nI had to leave. And he told me only that I should bring clothes for my mother.",
        "A: This -- the BaltaraiStininkas, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, with a gun. Yeah, was left at the hospital to watch my mother.",
        "A: Yeah. And then m -- I left, and I -- on Friday I came back and I brought her clothes and she\nwas already sitting at the window, and the BaltaraiStininkas was probably flirting with the nurses,\nI don\u2019t know, maybe, but he wasn\u2019t there, so I could get in. And this was my last time I saw my\nmother, and she was 35 years old. And we had the last talk, and I remember that my mother gave\nme some, like, three commandments. And I can -- until now I can\u2019t believe what kind of\npersonality she was that she could speak about such things in such circumstances. Of course, she\nhad the hope that it is a mistake and --- and that everything will be okay. But she told me that --\ntry always to live according to your possibilities. Don\u2019t ask for more. Be s -- be independent and\nself-sufficient. And she also meant that if I need now money I can sell something of her jewelry\nor something of our belongings that I shouldn\u2019t go and ask grandparents, or aunts or uncles or\nsomebody else for help. Then the second commandment was I should always live with truth,\nbecause a lie doesn\u2019t help. And the third, which is maybe the dearest to me and probably saved\nme in some way, I should never take revenge. So -- and she of course told me where to go and\nmaybe to look for help, that she should be released. So I left her, and of course I started to -- to\ntry to -- to liberate her.",
        "A: I am until now interpreting it. I think she was just a wonderful person and she believed in\nsome very important common values she wanted me to follow.",
        "A: At this moment why she -- because this was very important for her.",
        "A: No, I was not surprised, I was -- I had -- I was surprised later on, and then I was just listening\nand remembering, and I was 13 years old. It was such a situation, you can\u2019t imagine. I was -- I\nwas not reflecting then, I was only thinking what to do, how to save my mother. So -- and -- and\nI went to -- to such a person, Skuropskas is his name, he was working, he was a tow toninkas, he\nbelonged to the national party and my mother helped him to escape the -- to save him from\ndeportation, because in some way she -- she told him that he\u2019s in danger. And -- and when I\ncame, he was already the -- the minister and the -- he was sitting in the -- ond -- in the place\nwhere the [indecipherable] was sitting. And -- and he told me -- I's -- told him that my mother is\narrested, could he help? He knows her, he knows that she was not NK VD and she was nothing.\nShe was even not a party member, nothing. So he said there were hidden and there were open\ncommunists and NK VDist. So he didn\u2019t help at all. He had already high position, but it didn\u2019t\nlast for long. And then I went to Pulkininkas Bobelis who was a neighbor of ours. We lived\ntogether before we -- we -- m-my father built his own house of Laisves Aleja, at the beginning of\nLaisves Aleja. It was I think first, or number one, and -- house, and the house is still there. And\nhe was a very, very polite and very charming Colonel Bobelis, and he came to s -- play cards\nwith my mother and I was friendly with his daughter Laimuta, who was my age. The -- she had\ntwo brothers, Kazys Bobelis and they are -- ah, no, sh-she had two brothers, Jurgis\n[indecipherable] is why, the sons of Bobelis. But they were older and they were already very\nactive in this movement of liberation, and Bobelis became the commandant of Kaunas. And I\nmust say I had a very bad experience with him. I went to his house and he promised to help and\nasked me that -- he said -- told me that I have to bribe -- he has to bribe people so I should bring\nsome -- some -- some --\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: I was running away and of course my grandparents didn\u2019t allowed me any more to go to him.\nBut I must also say that I learned from Sara Ganita that he helped her family, Bobelis, and I also\n-- he released my aunt, the wife of stro -- o-of Jorge Stromas, who got arrested. And when he got\nto know that she is there, he told to let her out. So -- but my experience with him was really not\nvery good. And -- and it\u2019s painful for me, of course. So I couldn\u2019t help my mother, and I was --\nshe was taken on Sunday to the pri -- to prison on Mizkavajoes, to the main prison.",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell you exactly when I learned it. I was looking for her, but I got to know that she is\nthere and that she is there with -- sitting with such communist -- Lithuanian communist Bud-\nBudinskinada, I think her -- her name was. And -- and I gave her -- I brought her something to\neat and I got her signature.",
        "A: And -- I was queuing in line, in -- and they were taking packages for -- for prisoners, so I -- I\nonce brought, and the second time when they came, it was I think, middle of July, I was told -- or\nmaybe even earlier, it was told -- I was told that she is not any more there. And then I couldn\u2019t\nfind her anywhere, and I think she was killed at the seventh [indecipherable] I think, or on the\nfourth -- I think on the seventh, but I don\u2019t know where. I can\u2019t go there even, this is too hard for\nme. But this I can\u2019t take, be -- my mother is -- she was such a -- a wonderful person. But you see,\nshe -- she was already divorced and the narcom -- the minister were -- were called -- he was\ncalled narcom in -- in the Soviet times, Gregorouskas Marionas, he fall in love with here and\nprobably therefore she was -- she was somehow suspicious, or they wanted -- I don\u2019t know why.\nI think this -- this Skuropskas denounced her, so I think. Because not everybody was arrested.\nPeople -- they would take women from the street and man especially -- not so many women,\nmore man. But -- but she ca -- she was arrested and I am absolutely sure that it was denounced.\nAnd I -- and she was, after such a hard operation and I was told by women prisoners who came\nout, and I met them in the ghetto, that my mother was very proud, and she would -- she was\nsinging. Sometimes they thought that maybe she lost her mind, but I don\u2019t know. But in the --\nshe was interrogated by the Gestapo or by the Lithuanian police, I don\u2019t know. I think by\nGestapo. And she spoke, of course, German very well. And th-they -- they told her that, oh we\ncan\u2019t believe you are Jewish. She -- but she answered that she is Jewish, and she was not asking,\nshe was proud and full of dignity, so that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all I know about my mother.",
        "A: Yeah, from women prisoners, that she was very nice and behaved very proudly and -- and\nvery -- and full of -- with dignity. She didn\u2019t ask for mercy, or she was not, you know --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: She just disappeared, and my uncle, her brother, Jorge Stromas was also arrested on Monday\nevening. He -- just because he was too honest. He didn\u2019t leave -- he didn\u2019t escape. My mother\ncouldn\u2019t escape because she was ill, and my uncle couldn\u2019t escape because his son, Alexander\nStromas was in Palanga. And my mother was in hospital. We were a very close family, old\ngrandparents, my grandparents. So he stayed here. But he understood that -- he was the director\nof Parama. This is a bakery of bread. And he went on Monday evening to -- because the factory\nhas to work, to give the keys away, because he understood that he will not any more be the\ndirector, so -- and then they arrested him, and I saw him working in -- in the Russian embassy.\nThis was in the beginning of Laisves Aleja, guarded by a BaltaraiStininkas with some other\npeople. I -- I was very -- I was very energetic. My father, I must say, somehow prepared me for\nsuch a life because he educated me and -- to be very independent. So I went immediately to my\naunt, his wife, and my cousin Margaret, and I brought her down to -- to -- to this place, and I was\ntrying to convince my uncle to leave. It was on -- on Wednesday, to -- to escape, because the\nBaltaraistininkas was -- it was they were not so hardly guarded, yeah. The har -- it was -- he\ncould escape. And I told him come, you -- you should escape. And my uncles said no, I can\u2019t do\nit, because these BaltaraiStininkas, we were all count and if he comes back without one person,\nhe will be punished. And I don\u2019t believe that something will happen, you know. Everything will\nbe okay. And he didn\u2019t go, because -- because he didn\u2019t want, you know, to put in a bad position\nthis BaltaraiStininkas. And then he was killed in Lietukis in the garage. But this I got to know\nonly after the war. After -- after -- after the war was finished, yeah.",
        "A: No, it was on the 27\", on Friday. You know, there are now controversies, who can now\nremember exactly, but in my opinion, I saw him definitely on Wednesday, and I didn\u2019t see the\nLietukis massacre, but as I learned from -- from literature and so on and from memories, it was\non the 27\", on Friday.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I lost my uncle --",
        "A: -- and I lost my mother.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They -- they disappeared.",

        "A: Was also a person -- you know, they were extremely -- my -- I wouldn\u2019t say that about my\nfather, he was a -- such a strong person, but my mother and her brother were extremely soft,\nliberal, good hearted people who wouldn\u2019t really -- they -- it is so -- it is terrible. Sorry.",
        "A: No, I was then staying with my aunt, my mother\u2019s sister. The only who -- from the whole\nfamily who survived, and my grandparents lost all their children except this aunt, and with my\ngrandparents, I went with them to the ghetto.",
        "A: I was alone, I was in my house.",
        "A: Yeah, there were not, there was more than two weeks.",
        "A: Yeah. The war started on the 22\", the order to go to the ghetto was on the 15\" of July, and\nthe ghetto was closed on the 15\"\" of August. And I had another aunt of a uncle of my mother\u2019s\nbrother who perished before, well died before. Died. No, died from operation. And I was -- you\nknow, I was by myself 13 years old, but she had a little son, Lavinka, my -- my cousin, and I\ntook care of them, you know. I was -- I was -- I was going to -- to -- to get some food, because\nthe -- in the Jewish shops you couldn\u2019t buy anything, so I would take off my -- my star, yellow\nstar and I would try to go in this Lithuanian shops to buy something. So mostly I succeeded, but\ntwice I was thrown out from the -- and [indecipherable] you -- why are you staying here?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: But I -- I looked like a Jewish girl --",
        "A: -- yeah. But what saved me sometimes is my language, because it was ma -- be-because it\nwas, you know, like a stereotype that the Jews don\u2019t speak Lithuanian well. They can\u2019t speak\nLithuanian well, they have an accent, they are, you know, and so on. I had no accent at all. So,\nthey couldn\u2019t believe I could sometimes you know, like it -- it -- it made people doubtful. Maybe\nI am not Jewish because I speak so well Lithuanian.",
        "A: Oh yes, very dangerous. Very dangerous. And it was maybe you know, the -- the most\nhumiliating thing because -- I don\u2019t remember now exactly which day it was, but we were not\nallowed to go on the sidewalks. So we had to walk like animals on -- on the -- on the street, not\non the pavement.",
        "A: So -- and you couldn\u2019t go two together, you have to go one by one. So this was really -- it was\nso humiliating, it was so -- and terrible. And then you meet people you knew -- you knew them,\nyeah? And when they see you, they turn away their eyes from you. And I was -- it was -- it -- it\nwas so shocked, I couldn\u2019t understand what happened. And -- and only later already, much later,\nI understood that they were turning away their eyes and heads because they couldn\u2019t help, and\nmaybe they were very confused, I am -- I am -- I understand that --",
        "A: -- there was no -- I -- I tried to understand this, but this was very painful. And I remember\nhow a partisan, a -- a BaltaraiStininkas on Laisves Aleja, I went there, I was with my star and he\ntook my hand and -- and said, do you know -- don\u2019t you know that the Jews have no rights to\nwear watches? And I had a Paul Bourret, which my father bought me in Switzerland when we\nwere in \u00b038, it was a very dear present to me. And he took it off. And good he didn't beat me up\nor didn\u2019t kill me, or -- but it was also very humiliating. I was very sensitive to such things. I\ncouldn\u2019t understand.",
        "A: No, no. But it was such -- you know, the atmosphere was really somehow terrible. My cousin\nMargaret, my -- the -- the daughter of Jorge Stromas, of my uncle, she later got to know that her\nclassmates were -- were discussing -- they knew that she has a radio, and then the radio was not\nSo -- so, they were discussing maybe let us go and take away from her the radio. And then they\nstill decided no, it wouldn\u2019t be nice, so they didn\u2019t go. But once one of the group stopped them.\nSo, you see, it was -- 1-it was a atmosphere of you had no rights at all. You were nothing,\nnothing. Everybody was an enemy. And when our former -- former servant, she was a cook in\nour house, she brought me something to eat -- so she was hiding, nobody should know, nobody\nshould see it, she was afraid. And so it was -- it was really -- it was a -- there were some people\nwho tried to help, too, but really very few, and everybody was very afraid to help Jews.",
        "A: Can you -- did you live some -- sometimes -- did you have the experience of living in\ntotalitarian society? Probably not.",
        "A: So -- so, when you are living in a totalitarian society, you are afraid of your shadow.",
        "A: This is what -- how they -- they --",
        "A: -- keep, and they know that for instance, Lithuanians who tried to help Jews were killed, also.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: No, not everybody did it, you know, I would say the whole atmosphere was bad, but not\neverybody did it, no. Many people were ashamed to do it, it -- it is like, you know, when you say\nthat the Jews were meeting with joi -- the Red army. So, there were some Jews who did it, some\nwere terrified. But -- so the same 1s to say that Lithuanians, some yes, but not all. And then you\nsee the propaganda, the -- the Nazi propaganda, which was taken also over by the LAF-ists, the\nLithuanian LAF-ist Skirpa, who had a good intention to -- to have again an independent\nLithuania, he thought that maybe Hitler will give him back the independence, but it didn\u2019t\nhappen. It was a big disappointment, of course. But I know that you can\u2019t use any -- you have,\nyou know, this M-Machiavelli, that 1-1f you have a task you can pay any price, this is not\nvaluable in life, it is terrible. So -- and it was, the propaganda was, you see, you are of -- all Jews\nare communists. It stays very deep in your -- in your con -- in the Lithuanian conscience that --\nthat they sold you to the Soviet Union, they are your real enemies and therefore you have to kill\nthem like parasites. So you -- and I am absolutely sure that many Lithuanians really took revenge\nfor their deported -- and it could happen that for instance, when their family or somebody was\ndeported, some -- some of the people who came to deport was -- could be also a Jew. There were\nnot many of them, but still, 1t could happen. This is why th -- you should never generalize. So it\nwas like absolute belief that the Jews are your enemies, that the Jews are communists, the Jews\nsold your cu -- sold your country and there were maybe people who believed that they are killing\nthe enemies. And only later it came -- of course there were people among the killers who wanted\nto become richer, who wanted the -- there were different people. It\u2019s complicated, but 1-in the\nbeginning it was really that. And it\u2019s very interesting, one lawyer from Solvakia, he told me how,\nafter the beginning of the war, the Jews, I think it was in VilkaviSkis, they were collected and\nbrought into the kazaram, you know, where the -- the -- the -- the soldiers live. And everybody\nwas asked who he 1s and -- and they wanted to get from them, I don\u2019t know, the men -- men,\nmaybe men. And then one Jew was somehow -- wasn\u2019t obedient, and they shot him. And they\nwere so afraid that they did it. And they have hidden him in -- in somewhere, buried him in a\nsecret place, because they were afraid that tomorrow will come a [indecipherable] and will\naccuse them that they killed a person. But nothing happened, nobody came. So it was absolute\nfree. You could kill a Jew, you could kill him like a fly. Nothing would happen to you. So -- and\nthen it 1s e -- it -- it -- 1t -- it comes like a -- I don\u2019t know, it was a terrible atmosphere of hatred.\nYou can\u2019t -- it\u2019s described in literature, it 1s -- it doesn\u2019t last for very long, but it 1s there and they\nhave to pay a very high price for that.",
        "A: Yeah. We had to exchange flats to find a place. The Lithuanians who lived in Vilijampole\nbecame our flats and we went there. Of course we all were very squeezed in, but not --",
        "A: To go to the ghetto?",
        "A: In some way, yes. Because -- because we felt really very unsecure and unprotected in the\ntown. But this was also, as you understand, it was a -- not a secure place.",
        "A: I remember that we got a -- a coach with a horse and I put some clothes in, and food, mainly.\nAnd some -- what you had what could be maybe sold later on, or something, but --",
        "A: No, I live -- I lived separately, but -- but we went to the ghetto. I went with the aunt, first of\nall, of my -- of my -- of my -- that uncle, past -- Tanta Ada with Lavinka. And I stayed with\nthem, because they were very helpless and I was already stronger. And then they were taken to\nthe ninth fort on the aktion --",
        "A: -- big aktion on the 28\" of October \u201941. But already before I went already to live with my\ngrandparents and with my Aunt Paula.",
        "A: Yeah, because it was a more secure family who had some men, and Auntie Ada, he was a\nlonely woman with a child, so she wasn\u2019t very secure. Nobody was secure, but still.",
        "A: The aktion started very soon, very fast. There were --",
        "A: Y-Y-Yeah. No, you see, we were somehow trying to cope with new situation. It was\nimmediately a question of food, because there were -- the Germans came, the -- the Nazis came\ntoo, and took away our, you know, food we had. Also, it was an order to give away everything\ngold, silver and so on. So th -- I remember how the Germans were even searching, you know,\ngynecologically, the -- the Nazis who came to the -- to the ghetto. And they took away -- I had\nsuch a bracelet here, was also a very pre -- a very dear present from my father, this chains, for\nlu7ck. Took it away also. Everything. Very brutally.",
        "A: Nazis, yeah, those were the Germans.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, the partisans were maybe also, but this were the Germans. They took away. And the lithu\n-- the Lithuanian partisans were looking after the ghetto, they were guarding the ghetto, and they\nwere really -- during the aktions they would take the people, they would guard the people who\nwere selected by the Nazis. And at the big aktion, I was staying with my grandfather and my\ngrandmother on the 28\" of October, and with the -- and th-there was al-also the whole family\nwas standing, and my aunt with her son and her husband and his brother, and they went already\nthrough, and I was behind them with two old people. I remember I was dressed in my mother\u2019s\nsuits and I put here to make a bigger breast, I put some socks into the bra. And also I -- I took\nsome shoes on higher heels to look a little bit more a -- as an adult. And then -- and my -- my\naunt and my cousin went through bet -- but the parents and a sister of my aunt\u2019s husband, they\nwere taken to the bad side, and the-they were killed at the ni -- in the ninth fort. And I was, of\ncourse, it was already -- we were staying the whole day on [indecipherable] in Vilijampole, we\nwere already of course, tired and -- and I know that about four o\u2019clock, it was already a little bit\ngetting dark, it was -- and not dark, but that was not the nicest day there was, it was not so nice.\nAnd when I was staying, I can feel now like I was holding my parents behind -- my grandparents\nbehind me and I was looking him in the eyes. And Rowka, who was making the selection, said\n[speaks foreign language] this girl has nice eyes, and -- beautiful eyes and told me to go to the\nright side, to the bad --",
        "A: -- to the good side.",
        "A: To-Together. He didn\u2019t see them maybe, because I think I hypnotized him. And then I was\ntaking away my grandparents. I don\u2019t know where I had so much, you know, I was so strong.\nAnd m -- I remember my grandmother saying [speaks foreign language], where are you carrying\nme? I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t run, and my grandfather was also not so fit. And -- and I -- I told her,\nBobinka, laif. I was shle -- I was carrying them until we got to the -- to the right side, so\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Yes. We knew because we saw that on the one side are the elderly people, the ill people, the\nchildren, the weak people. And here are the -- the -- we didn't know, but we guessed. And then\nsometimes policemen would come and take out somebody, you know, and send to the other side,\nSO we guessed that sa --",
        "A: Jewish police.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I thought of them -- I -- I knew personally Kopelman, who was the head of the police, and he\nwas a very decent person. Not very strong, but very decent. And many policemens were\nwonderful people. And some of them were like -- like animals. So Armstam was terrible, you\nknow, and everybody hated him. But there were -- this was onl -- th-those were only individuals.\nBut as -- the police as a whole were somehow respected, in my view.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yes, I can tell. Everybody wanted to go, because they thought that there will be a better\nsolution.",
        "A: The -- the announcement was that -- that he will work in archives, he will -- we need\nintellectual people, and we are asking for 500 men. So, of course I would now be suspicious why\nthey are asking only for men, but -- but th-then -- and they went and my cousin, who was then --\nhow old was he, he was 20 years old. So he wanted also to go, but they had already 500, he was\ntoo late. So it was a -- 1t was very tragic, because really very good people went.",
        "A: They disappeared.",
        "A: Mm, you see, it is a very strange thing. You hear rumors and you\u2019d want -- don\u2019t want to\nbelieve in it. You know, and you don\u2019t know. So when people say, how could they go to be\nkilled like -- like sheeps, so I would like to see how others would -- would behave in such\nposition. First of all you don\u2019t know that they are taking you, they say you -- they\u2019re taking for\nwork. And then you know that if you protest at this very moment, they will kill you immediately.\nAnd there you have still some hope that maybe, maybe you will be taken for work. And -- and\nthen, you know, you -- you probably know, I learned it also, for any moment you need a leader.\nYou can\u2019t expect that the crowd will do spontaneously something, you know. So -- it can\nspontaneously, but it\u2019s [indecipherable] and people were afraid. My aunt, for instance, she had a\nhiding place, the widow of my uncle, Jorge Stromas. And she was afraid to step out from the --\nfrom the cot -- from the group of people who was taking out of the ghetto.",
        "A: No, no, my -- my -- everybody understood that there is no future in the ghetto and that they\nare going to kill us all. And my aunt did everything and she pushed out her son, Alexander\nStromas, and he was taken by a Lithuanian family and was -- lived with them unt-until their\nliberation, wonderful people, absolutely, Metsunaviches family. And my -- his sister Margaret,\nshe got married. And her husband was a very active and very energetic man, and he organized a\nplace, a hiding place in a factory, and a Lithuanian friend, a worker of this factory\n[indecipherable], he brought them there, under an attic. And even the German leader of the\nfactory knew that they are there, but di-di-di -- didn\u2019t denounce them. And he -- nine months he\nwas feeding them, and risking his life and the life of his family, but they were saved. And M-\nMargaret\u2019s mother, Auntie Jaina had also to come to this place. She knew, but she hadn\u2019t the\ncourage to step out, and I know what it 1s. I stepped out, so I know what it is.",
        "A: This is already in *43, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, that was terrible. You can\u2019t imagine how it was. It was the -- the -- the day after the\nselection when everybody came home, was such a crying, such a -- such a -- a f -- a terrible --\neverybody lost somebody. It was really terrible, terrible.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know anything, but for instance, the next day and the day after, we heard\nshootings. So, I told you we believed and we didn\u2019t believe, but we know -- never saw them\nback. We saw them from -- they were taken on the 28\" to the little ghetto, and then the next day\nthey were taken to the Ninth Fort from the little ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah, we s -- we saw them going, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. It went on probably for some time,\nbut I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Yeah, this was Judel Baylis.",
        "A: Yeah, I know him. I helped to publish his book. I --",
        "A: Ah, then?",
        "A: No, I -- then I really didn\u2019t know, no. No. I he-heard only rumors --",
        "A: -- about somebody coming back, telling terrible stories, and some people thought they are\nmad, you know. But I was still a young child and then I -- I went to -- to -- to -- I worked,\nbecause I need to have some food, so I went to the aerodrome, to the -- to work. It was very hard\nwork there.",
        "A: No, no, I just joined the -- the brigada of the ar -- aerodromestikas.",
        "A: No, no, I registered probably, in the [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t remember now exactly how I\ndid it.",
        "A: But I went there and then I could expect a little bit bigger piece of bread, you know.",
        "A: It was given by -- by the -- we had some stores in the -- in the ghetto, so we would get there\nsome bread.",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t remember we had coupons or not coupons, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: But I know that my aunt, a cousin of my mother worked in such a shop and she couldn\u2019t give\nme more, but still she tried. You know, the burt -- bread was cut so give me a little bit bigger\npiece of bread. And then she worked in the -- in the kitchen of the werkstatten, where I worked\nlater on, so she gave me a little bit thicker soup, you know. But however, I went to -- with the\naerodromestikas, and this was the hardest brigade. We had to work nightshifts there. And it\nfinished with that I collapsed.",
        "A: We were -- no -- pits --",
        "A: Digging pits, yeah. Digging pits and with a kierka, with such a --",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t know how to call it in English.",
        "A: Like trenches to make, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I think it was -- it is -- it had no purpose at all. It was just to sc -- to ca -- to -- to torture us. I\ndon\u2019t know if that\u2019s some -- but opposite were -- also, this was terrible. We were already better\noff than the -- than the Soviet prisoners of war. They were so hungry. Was terrible. So we would\nshare with them, but if somebody sees it, ger -- a Nazi guard, that you throw some piece of bread\nor a cigarette, they would kill you immediately.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember seeing it, but I know that it -- it would happen.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it was very dangerous.",
        "A: No, but I was told.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t communicate, but some people, they were -- we were -- they were a little bit far\nbehind the fence, so we couldn\u2019t direct communicate with them, but somehow people managed.\nAnd of course we tried not to work too hard, but the guards would come and beat us up, and I got\nalso on my back some hits. But then it finished that I --",
        "A: The guards were -- as far as I remember these were -- were soldiers, is -- German soldiers,\nmainly. I don\u2019t remember it being Lithuanians. Maybe the Lithuanians were taking us to the\nairport there, but really, you see, the memory is not so -- 1s not so clear, and --",
        "A: I think in German, but because I understood German --",
        "A: So if I wouldn\u2019t understand German, then I would maybe remember better. But because I --\nLithuanian and German I understood equally, so I maybe don\u2019t remember. I only remember how\na woman was picking up a piece of cigarette which this guard was throwing out -- throwing\naway, and she got terribly beaten up for that. This I saw. And some people managed even to\nleave the brigade, to get out to some Lithuanian houses and to bring some food, in exchange of\nsome things, but it was also, of course, very dangerous. So then I\u2019d -- I\u2019d worked there at li -- I\nthink about six weeks and then I collapsed, I was dystrophia, you know, I couldn\u2019t move any\nmore, I was absolutely -- and I got ill and I was lying in bed for six weeks.",
        "A: No, no, at home --",
        "A: -- I couldn\u2019t any more go, I was absolutely dystrophia. I was still 13 years old, so I needed\nsome food. I know how much teenagers are eating.",
        "A: For six weeks I was -- I was ill and --",
        "A: Yeah, my -- of course, my family and then doctors would come.",
        "A: My aunt and my grandparents. And my grandparents would -- I would find under my pillow a\nlittle piece of bread. So my grandmother or grandfather would take their portion and give it\nsecretly to me, because the husband of my aunt was very -- he wa -- he wanted everybody to\nhave equally and so -- but they -- they gave me some bit more, my grandparents. And he would\ncut everything in equal pieces. So it was -- and then I -- then I recovered, bit by bit and then I got\nanother job. I -- the werkstatten were organized, and I was working there in the [indecipherable]\nthis is [indecipherable] this is fo -- where we made toys. And then already we saw -- we made\nout toys from -- from different, you know, m -- no -- no -- for instance, suitcases, clothes which\nwere -- that was taken away from the killed people.",
        "A: Yeah, we could ice -- I remember some inscriptions. And of course I couldn\u2019t recognize the --\nthe -- the clothes, but it is clear that the clothes was not very good clothes, the good clothes was\nprobably taken by other people. And then we made -- I made dolls. We made dolls out of that.\nWe were cutting from the suitcases such round things to put like joints that we can move their\nhands, and -- and from the material we would -- we would sew clothes, nice for these dolls. And\nthe dolls were sent as presents to the families of the German soldiers, to Germany.",
        "A: I -- we are told.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: [indecipherable] in the werkstatten were a lot of people.",
        "A: In the -- in the [indecipherable] alone, there may be 15 - 20.",
        "A: Small, small, yeah.",
        "A: Ah, you learn everything immediately. Somebody knows better, and -- we had -- we had, you\nknow, I don\u2019t know how it is in -- in Russia, when you cut wood, then you have like -- like flour,\nhow it\u2019s called.",
        "A: You know what I -- so we would put it inside these legs and -- and bodies so it -- it should\nhave a shape, and then we would put the clothes on, and make --",
        "A: Yeah, from another werkstatt, because there was another werkstatt who made something out\nof -- of wood.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. So they had --",
        "A: In some way, yes. There were no reliefs in the ghetto, but still there were some -- the for -- the\nyear \u00b042 was a little bit better than \u201941, and there were not so many aktions, not so great aktions,\nand we managed even to organize an orchestra, and --",
        "A: Well, th-the -- the ghetto.",
        "A: That [indecipherable] me, no, but I identify myself with the ghetto",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, these were moments of relief. We were singing, people were performing and --\nand then -- and this was really -- and I had a friend, Bobby Rosenberg -- brum who was playing\npiano and on [indecipherable] there were -- this was this concert hall, the piano was there and we\nwent sometimes and listened -- were listening how he plays. And he had also a hidden patophone\nand concerts. Huberman was playing Tchaikovsky\u2019s concert and Mendelssohn\u2019s they had, so we\nwere -- we went sometimes to listen to it. This was just, you know, really moments of relief. And\nthen I went to school also there. It was a illegal school, and -- because we were not allowed to\nhave schools, but still, 1t was organized and I went there and I learned there, for instance,\nSchiller\u2019s Ballade, which also, I must say, gave me a lot of moral strength, because as you know,\nSchiller in his Ballades is giving examples of people\u2019s high morality of -- of -- of behavior in\nvery critical circumstances, according to their principles, to their understanding of honor and so\non and -- like the [speaks foreign language here] and so on, so --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. With -- I always identified with -- I wanted to be like -- you can\u2019t\nalways be, but I wanted really, it gave me some. It was also in -- coinciding with what I learned\nfrom home, from my mother.",
        "A: Yeah, I had a romance in the ghetto as well. And we are still friends until now. It\u2019s Dr. Jack\nBrowns. Now he is Dr. Jack Browns, then he was Yasha. And when we were meeting each other\nand we were very happy to share many things, and I remember how after the Estonian aktion,\nwhen people were taken to Estonia and I was in the werkstatten and he worked also in the\n[indecipherable] but in -- in the biz -- he worked with -- with wood. He told me that I shouldn\u2019t\ngo alone home, that he is going to see if his parents are there. We went together and then he will\nsee me off. And I remember that we went together, it was a very good feeling and his parents\nwere at home, thank God, and then I was living in the other part of the ghetto and we had to pass\nthe Krikschu kaichu Street where the ghetto was very narrow and that was a little bit dangerous\nto walk there, so his parents were absolutely terrified that he 1s going to see me off, but still he\ndid it, and -- and I came back and I also found my family, but many people disappeared and after\nthe Estonian aktion, I left the ghetto pretty soon.",
        "A: Because there were the guards, and the guards can shoot you any time.",
        "A: They -- oh, it can -- yeah, for instance, there was a very tragic story in the ghetto, which\nhappened to a half Jew, Argie Saviskas. He was a very beautiful man. He is a son of a very\nfamous Lithuanian writer and diplomat who happened to marry a Jewish woman, and he has two\nsons. One of her sons is still alive -- of their sons is still alive, Augustinas Saviskas, he is a very\nfamous painter. And his brother Argie Saviskas fall in love with a Jewish woman, terribly ugly\nwoman. She didn't look li -- she had the child, but he fall in love with her and he joined her in the\nghetto. And he was guarding the gardens in the ghetto, where we were growing some potatoes or\nsomething like that. And once he started to talk to a Lithuanian guard who was walking around,\nand they got in some controversy. And when this guard learned that he is Lithuanian -- because\nhe probably accused them that he is a guard or something, he shot him, this Argie Saviskas, he\njust shot him. So it\u2019s a very tragic story.",
        "A: Yeah, it was frightening, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, and after an aktion, you know, you are so frightened, you don\u2019t know where the danger\ncomes from.",
        "A: This was a little bit more stable, less aktions.",
        "A: There were different events. People were punished for smuggling in food, and people -- I -- I\ncan\u2019t tell you now this, I should check really the dates, I don\u2019t remember exactly when it was,\nbut there were -- for instance there was a Jewish fa -- a -- a Jewish man who had a Christian\nwife, she was Belgian. And they wanted to -- they -- they applied to go to the -- to Belgium,\nbecause she was Christian, and -- and they were not allowed and finally they were told that okay,\nand they were taken out from the ghetto and they were shot.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t see, but I know -- I knew them.",
        "A: I knew them personally, yeah.",
        "A: Because they never came back and then -- then it was the rumors were spreading around, so --",
        "A: You see -- that I saw th -- for instance how they go through the -- the -- through the fence,\nbelow the fence. I knew -- I knew even the places where they went, but -- and they were bribing\nthe guards often, but I didn\u2019t see it by myself, no.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, but -- you know, I was not running around in the evening or at night.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. No, a love affair, you know, it was all very platonic and very innocent. It was -- it was\nanother time, so it was not like today.",
        "A: Yeah, we had very nice feelings, but we had no -- no sexual relations or something. This was\nnot the case in those times.",
        "A: What I eat -- I ate?",
        "A: I ate the piece of bread.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I got the soup in the werkstatten for instance, which was very thin, but still my\naunt was giving me sometimes a little bit more so I -- I could find there some lentils or a little\npiece of -- of horsemeat.",
        "A: Because my -- I know what was cooked, my -- my aunt told me.",
        "A: Yeah. And I know already the -- the -- the taste of it. And it is very good to get a -- a piece of\nhorse -- horsemeat, not so bad. Yeah, so this was the main food, and yeah, we made sometimes\nfor -- when we had kipsventai -- what is Easter? Easter is -- what is it? It\u2019s not a holiday, but\nwhat 1s it?",
        "A: It\u2019s [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s in English now, I -- I -- it -- it is out of my head.",
        "A: In Hebrew it doesn\u2019t help me. Unfortunately [indecipherable] I\u2019m very upset that I don\u2019t\nknow Hebrew. The -- so in \u201942 we were -- we -- for -- for some celebrations, okay, we made for\nma -- for instance, out of cabbage, we made gehakt herring, this 1s you know, such he-herring\nlike -- like when -- chopped herring. Or out of potatoes, even sometimes we ate the -- the skin of\nthe potatoes. Not always potatoes, so we made out of the skin -- we -- we I-let it through a\nmachine mixing -- mixer, and then we made -- we made kikolach, such -- such -- such --",
        "A: -- th -- like -- and then it -- it was li --",
        "A: Yeah, like [indecipherable] cake, yeah. And then we made in -- out of -- we had rye flour.\nThis was already -- we brought sometimes in from the city. We --",
        "A: No, when we -- for instance, my cousin went to work, so he was smuggling in, he was\nchanging it for some -- he was br-bringing out some clothes or something and then getting for\nthe --",
        "A: Yeah, buying. So then we made such a porridge out of this -- with this rye flour and if we had\nsome spirgai, some -- some -- you know, pork fat.",
        "A: Which was -- was -- was made, you know, with -- because we had not any more guze or -- or\nchicken fat, this was absolutely -- so -- and if you put a little bit in, so this was already a\nwonderful -- won-wonderful dish.",
        "A: Yeah, this was one of the main feelings in the ghetto. This is fear, hunger. All the time\nhunger, you can\u2019t imagine, it\u2019s a terrible feeling, hungry all the time. And -- and then also I was\npersonally -- I really was suffering that I couldn\u2019t learn. I wanted to learn. So this was also that\ntime is passing. But fear and -- and hunger was terrible.",
        "A: You didn\u2019t feel any more so humiliated because you were among the same people.",
        "A: Y-Yeah, but everybody -- no, there were people who were not so hungry. It was a difference\nin the ghetto. We were calling them the yallis, you know, the -- the -- the people who were in the\naltestenrat, the police. There were people who worked in the Gestapo brigada. So they were\nbetter off than we because they could smuggle in more, or -- or they had the better place to make\nexchange, or speculators who would smuggle in food. They were all so much better off than we.\nWe were a very ordinary family.",
        "A: Gestapo brigada was a -- the brigade which worked in the Gestapo. Liptzer was a Gestapo, a\nJewish Gestapo man who was working for the Gestapo.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, he was collaborating and he was also, I think, the head of the brigade, of the Gestapo\nbrigade, if I am not mistaken.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what they were building there, or they were -- they were doing some work there,\nI don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, in the -- inside Gestapo.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And of course the -- the Ge-Gestapo was always interested if there was -- it shouldn\u2019t be\nresistance in the ghetto, it -- the partisans guns shouldn\u2019t be smuggled in and so on there.",
        "A: No, Liptzer was not. Not all ga -- people who worked in the Gestapo were collaborating with\nthe Gestapo.",
        "A: No, no, but Liptzer was a yalla, you know, he was rich, and he -- he was working for -- he\nwas a Jew who worked for the Gestapo, yeah. And then there was another one Serabrovich who\neven lived in town. He was a Jew, and he was also killed, and Liptzer, everybody was killed, but\nthe -- he also worked for -- somehow for the Gestapo. But you know, I was still a 14 years old,\n15 years old girl, 13 years old girl. So I saw it all, but not so -- maybe not -- I remember more\ntalking then. But I have seen a lot, I remember this terrible case when -- when the -- when the\nhospital in the little ghetto was burned down with people who were alive, with doctors, with\nnurses, with the patients.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t see, I was in the big ghetto.\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: So -- but my friend Jack Browns -- my boyfriend, so-called, so he -- his father and he went to\nwork, because they worked in the hospital. And this day they were a little bit late, and the little\nghetto was closed and they were -- didn\u2019t -- they were -- they were not let in there, so they saved\ntheir life, otherwise they were -- would be burned there as well.",
        "A: Yeah, I heard about it.",
        "A: Of what?",
        "A: I know that there was execution, but my aunt didn\u2019t let me go to see it.",
        "A: Okay. [tape break]",
        "A: Yeah, my -- my -- this is -- I don\u2019t know if this is important to say now, but that I don\u2019t\nremember the faces of people who were [tape break]",
        "A: I wondered, you asked me what were the dominant feeling. So one I forgot to tell you. Never,\nnever -- I wanted so much to live as I -- as -- and to survive as it was in the ghetto. The -- the --\nthe -- the desire to survive was very, very strong. And maybe the purpose for that, rationally, was\nto tell the world what happened to us, because it was absolutely unimaginable. Out of my\nchildhood, my peaceful childhood, with belief and enlightenment in goodness and humanity, and\nsuddenly I see all those terrible, violent, absolutely rational hatred and so on, and I thought that\nwe have to witness it to tell the world about that, that it should never happen again.",
        "A: In the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah. Very much. Very much.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I -- I thought that we have to witness it. We have to witness it, to tell the\nworld what happened to us, because it should never happen again, to anybody. And I somehow\nbelieved, after the -- after the end that it will c -- everything will come up and it will really -- we\nwill learn something, but now I have no illusions any more. I know that if not Jews, somebody\nelse. Yugoslavia killed me. Killed all my hopes, absolutely. And also I -- of course, the Soviets --",
        "A: Cambodia, Rwanda, yeah, but this was already later, after Yugoslavia. But I must say that it is\nterrible that -- 1t is human nature, and you can\u2019t change it, and -- and you will never change it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. So, what would be your question now?",
        "A: I really didn\u2019t think so much by myself about that, but very close friends of my parent\u2019s, the\nStrimychie family, Bogdonavichai Strimychie, they came to Kaunas in \u201942, because he was in\nBelgium, he was a -- studying there engineering. He was [indecipherable] with his wife Onutay.\nAnd -- and th-they knew that I am in the ghetto in Kaunas. They were looking for me, and they\nfound out that I am there. And then they have sent me a little note that there is no future for me\nin the ghetto and I should sing that -- to get out, and that they will arrange documents for me, and\nthen we will -- I will -- I will -- I should escape the ghetto. I even didn\u2019t want to do it, I don\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t want to leave my family and my friends and th -- I never thought about that. But still, it\nwas clear that everybody can\u2019t be saved, and we have to try to save ourselves one by one. And\nmy boyfriend talked me in that I have to go, and -- and my family. And so I got documents that I\n-- | became the daughter of -- I got the documents of the daughter of the director of the\nMarijampole gymnasia, Tregeis -- I was Tregita Irena Felisksor, the same name, his daughter had\nthe same name -- name as my name, I was Irena, given -- the name was given by my parents to\nme. And -- and h-he just gave this documents of his daughter to me, and it was such a green page\nof paper with -- with -- they forged in there a -- a photography picture. And we decided that I,\nafter the Estonian aktion, that I will leave the ghetto.",
        "A: The Estonian aktion was, I think the third or fourth of November \u201943. But I have to check\n[indecipherable] at the date if -- 1f -- to be very precise. Or it was maybe on the seventh, I don\u2019t\nremember, but in the beginning of November. And then I had to leave the ghetto in the evening\nat six o\u2019clock with the brigade, which went to town to work. I should not put my -- not sew my\nsign, but put it just as a little needle so that I can easily take it off, and Onuta will wait for me on\nthe bridge, which uni -- connects Kaunas with Vilyjampole. But I couldn\u2019t leave at six o\u2019clock, it\nwas something. And of course the policeman there, they knew --",
        "A: Yes, of course, everybody was sitting with me at the gate. Yasha, my friend was sitting with\nme, and my aunt was sitting with me, and -- and everybody, of course was very nervous. And\nthen, finally I was told that I should join the brigade and the policeman, who was counting the\npeople, didn\u2019t count me. A Jewish policeman who was --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, he knew. And then we went -- this is -- here is the gate, yeah, and here is\nKrikS\u00e9iukaicio Street, and here is Jurbarko gatve and here is the bridge, yeah?",
        "A: And here is already Kaunas. So -- so I went out with the brigade. Then I know definitely that\nLithuanians was guarding us. And s -- a friend -- somebody took off my sign from my back, I\ntook off it from here and then I had to step from the group of people in the colon -- colonna, to\nthe pavement, yeah, they were walk -- walking pavement, because we were walking on the\nstreet, the -- the whole brigade. And this step, to do this was the most terrible thing, I can tell\nyou. I can understand how hard it is, because they can shot -- shot -- shot you. But it was already\n-- I was lucky. And the main I had only one idea in my head, not to run. To go very slowly, not\nto show that I am nervous, and so I went out, I get -- got a -- gained the feeling that somebody is\n-- will shoot my back immediately. But still I managed to go slowly, then I turned. And I don\u2019t\nremember the brigade was walking faster or slower, probably slower. And then, on the bridge,\nnobody was meeting me, because it was already two hours later than it was expected. And then I\nwent to their house, I knew the address, but not so very precisely. So I didn\u2019t know the flats, so I\nrang the bell, and it was the bell of the house caretaker, yeah, you call it. And they were the most\ndangerous people because they were really all serving in the ge -- not all, but many of them in --\nfor Gestapo, and they would denounce. And I asked where are the Strimychie? He told me and I\nwent in, but I told them that -- that I was asking the -- this man. So they were absolutely terrified.\nThey had two children, little. But in the morning they had already prepared a ticket. They took\nme immediately to Vilnius, where -- which is a more multicultural city and nobody knew here\nmy parents or me. And then started my life in Vilnius. So --",
        "A: The -- th-the first place [indecipherable] took me was his sister\u2019s, she was a dentist and she\nlived in Shwerinas on Mitskabajo Street. She was a wonderful woman, but she was so afraid\nwhen I came, for three days she couldn\u2019t eat, she couldn\u2019t sleep, she was so afraid. So I can\u2019t kill\n-- can\u2019t kill a person, so I had -- they took care [indecipherable] took care all the time what\nhappened to me. So I went to live in the house of her brother, Onuta\u2019s brother, on the [speaks\nLithuanian here]. It was a house which belonged then to the university before and I lived in his\nflat with him like -- like a relative from -- from the -- from the countryside. And he was very\nkind, very good, but he was actually a little bit Bohemian, he was a surgeon and all the elite,\nartistic elite came, so I learned there Schema and Kuchinskas and Vukoshas and Yukonaviches,\nall the famous Lithuanian artists and -- and so on. And well, there was a girl from -- from the --\nfrom the countryside. But Pranas, he was very goodhearted and he thought I must look like\neverybody. So he gave me money and t-told me to curl my hair, you know, permanent\n[indecipherable] permanent, this is [indecipherable]. And I went, and then I became much more\nlike a Jew, looking, because -- so it was not a very good idea, but nothing thing to do. And once\nit happened, I lived there for more than two months and once I -- yeah, and I was a -- a friend,\nalso very famous Lithuanian woman, Marcella Kubilutai. She arranged for me a working place in\nthe orphan home on Subacho 16, it was then. And she told the director of this place that I am a\nhalf Jew, it should be a little bit easier for him, and -- and that I -- and he gave me work, I was\nworking like a -- like -- no, like a sanitarka, you know, I -- w-washing and -- and feeding the\nchildren and so on. And -- and once -- I will tell you later on about this orphan home, but Pranas,\nthere came his friends one evening and brought a book, Van Gogh reproductions. And I was -- I\nliked very much Van Gogh, and my mother liked very much Van Gogh, I knew him. And when I\nsaw this book, I forgot who I am, and I said oh, this is Van Gogh, so wonderful. And then they\nall looked what kind of girl from the countryside is it who knows who is Van Gogh, because then\nyou haven\u2019t had so many, you know, books of reproductions as we have now. So -- and it\nbecame a little bit dangerous to stay there because they were all very good people, but you know,\nsometimes when they got drunk, they got -- they were talking too much. And also, he was\nengaged to a woman from Siauliai, Janni, who of course didn\u2019t know that I lived there, and some\nrumors came that a young girl lives with him, so she got a little bit like jealous and wanted to\nfind out who is this girl, so I had to disappear from this house. And then I got to -- to a family of\na Lithuanian Colonel Meskauskas, who was arrested by the Soviets already, in \u00b041, to his widow\nand daughter, who lived on Gedimino Street. And Marcella Kubilutai also in this house, which\narranged my -- me to work there. But registered I was, in Pranas\u2019s house. So once, it was maybe\na week or two after I started to work there, the gabrininia, the nurse, the -- the main nurse, she\ncame, asked me, who are you, where are you from, who are your parents? She asked -- she\nstarted so very suspicious to interrogate me. And I answered all the questions as needed, and --\nbut I -- when I came home, I was very nervous.",
        "A: No, I didn't tell her the truth. I said all the time from Marijampole, that I am the daughter of\nthe director of the school",
        "A: Yeah, no, not the truth, of course not. And -- but when I came home I told Marcella\nimmediately that -- that -- that I was asked by this nurse, and probably somebody denounced, or\nhas some suspicion. And she of ca -- course started to find out. And then it really was that some\nof the -- my colleagues there was su -- was suspicious that I am Jewish. I was still with my\ncurled hair. And -- and she went to director to ask who I am. And the director told her that everth\n-- everything is okay, everything is alright. And so it calmed down, the whole story. And after a\nweek of this event, suddenly some of my -- the sinit -- the nurses came in, saying that Gestapo\nsurrounded the -- the -- the orphan hou -- 0 -- home. And I wa-was absolutely sure that it\u2019s --\nthey come to take me. No -- a-and I really didn\u2019t know what to do, so I wa -- worked -- there\nwere two rooms, like that, and here in the middle was a little corridor, and here a toilet. So I went\nin the toilet, into the toilet. I put -- pulled down the water, and I was thinking what to do. To run\naway, it is little hope to escape. To -- to -- th -- and then I will -- if I escape, I prove that I am\nJewish, that I have to be afraid of something. And if I stay, maybe I will at least be able to defend\nPranas, because I was registered in his house that -- that -- and say that he didn\u2019t know who I am\nreally. So, because it was terrible for me to think that somebody will, because of me, you know,\nbe punished, or suffer. So I decided not to run away. And I went out from the toilet, I was calm\nand I f -- was feeding the children. And I hear already like, you know, the -- the shoes, the boots\ncoming in and the director, dor -- Dr. [indecipherable] with the -- with, I think, three Gestapo\npeople are coming in. And I saw only their boots, black, shining boots. And the -- but I thought\nthat Dr. Rudokas 1s a little bit, you know, like making me a little -- like with his eye, such. So\nthey were looking around the children, they were -- 1t was a denunciation that rudo -- that\nRuditis, Dr. Ruditis is hiding Jewish children, and this was true, actually. But he proved them\nthat they are Karaims, the -- the Karaims are also circumsi-sized and he didn\u2019t give the children\naway. They wanted to take the children for blood for the soldiers, so I was told. And --",
        "A: Dr. Ruditis. And -- but he didn\u2019t give it -- later on he told me. And -- and then they left. I\nstayed. And this saved me, because it was proved that nobody came to take me, that I didn\u2019t run\naway, I am here. But I can tell you, it was quite an experience to -- to this day I will never forget.\nSo I worked there to the very end of the Nazi occupation. Then I lived in this house of --",
        "A: Yeah, but I didn\u2019t finish you my story in Vilnius.",
        "A: You know, fo -- and then don\u2019t forget --",
        "A: -- to ask me about the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah. This is, you know, and then I was staying in this house of this Meskauskanya colon --\nwer -- the -- the widow of the Colonel Meskauskas, Maria Meskauskanya. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\nwas the best time I had, but okay. And one day Gestapo came in and was searching the flat. And\nI was -- my bed was in a sandylukas, how -- in a storage room, and was behind different stuff,\nwas a bed. But when you open the door you can\u2019t see, you see only different stuff. And the\nGestapo came in and they opened the door, but they didn't go farther, they saw it\u2019s a storage\nplace and they didn\u2019t find me. But the very moment they get -- got out, I had to get out from the\nother -- from the other door. So -- and I couldn\u2019t come back because it was really very\nthreatening. Somebody probably already denounced or something like that. So I went again to\nthe sister of [indecipherable]. And then in a day, or maybe even faster, they found for me a place,\nand so I got to the family of my second mother, really. This is Stephania Ledugania, you can see\nher beautiful face. He is a book we were pub -- we published recently about her. She was\nabsolutely outstanding personality, she had six children and -- and she took me as the seventh.\nAnd she was, I can\u2019t tell you what kind of person she was. And we became with her friends from\nthe first day, and I would like to remember several little things. When I came in there, I was\nbrought in by [indecipherable] Strimitis, she introduced me as a an orphan and now I will be the\nsister of her children. And she invited me for a evening meal. And of course she had also very\nlittle to eat, but a little bit more than in the ghetto, of course. And her husband was a Lithuanian\ngeneral, he was already arrested and killed by the Soviets. She didn't know that, but she learned\nlater, but he was arrested immediately, in \u00b041, when -- in \u201940, when the Soviets came. And -- and\nwhen she -- and she had such a -- agi-aginyeta. She was a housewife who was cooking, and we\nhad for this evening meal screelai. This is made out such things of -- of flour with a little bit fat\non it. And what I noticed that she has put in my -- into my plate a little bit more than she has\ngiven to her own children. So I was almost crying. I was really very hungry. I-In this orphan\nhome -- I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m a little bit jumping, but I am proud of it, I was feeding the -- the -- the\nchildren who were also more than one years old, and they would go -- get every day such a little\nplate with manakasha, how 1s it -- I d -- I don\u2019t remember how it\u2019s in English. It is such a wheat -\n- | forgot how it\u2019s in English, b-but a-a-a porridge out of little wheat --",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Kasha, yeah.",
        "A: Porridge.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s kasha, yeah.",
        "A: Manakasha. And -- cooked with milk. And this manakasha, oh, I -- I can\u2019t tell you how\nhungry wasn\u2019t I -- I wanted the manakasha to put in my mouth. And every spoon was a fight\nwith myself. I wanted to put it the mouth, but I had to put it in the mouth of the child. And the\nchildren, like devils were also very hungry. They wanted to eat, they never left a spoon for me to\neat. Sometimes soup was some leftovers, but the manakasha, never. And so I thought after the\nwar I will eat only manakasha with milk. It was my dream. But okay, I was very hungry, so you\ncan imagine what it meant to me that she has put a little bit more, and nobody -- nobody --\nnobody noticed, but I noticed. And then at 10 o\u2019clock in the evening, ev -- everybody went to\nbed, and she had this habit, she was going to -- to every child. We were -- three of her children\nwere -- three were out of the -- living in different places, they were already more adults, and\nthree were with -- with -- so we were four. And she went to everybody to give a kiss, and then\nshe came to me. I was in the bed, sleeping in a bed in a dark room without windows, where her\nson, who was taken to Germany for work was sleeping before. And she came and she kissed me\nand told me goodnight. And then I try -- then it really -- I broke out with such a almost hysterical\ncry. And this is what I wanted to tell you, how you can be indoctrinated by atmosphere of hatred.\nShe was shocked, why? She came to kiss me, why am I so crying terribly? And you know,\nnobody kissed me already, for such a long time. I was all the time in fear. Pranas was very good\nto me, but he didn\u2019t kiss me, you know, or -- or -- and this -- Maria Meskauskas [indecipherable]\nwas not such a very soft woman. And -- and suddenly she comes like a mother and kisses me. So\n-- and J -- I thought already that -- that -- I thought, how can you kiss a Jewish girl? A Jewish\nhuman being? It mu -- I thought that something has to be ugly in me. Something what puts off\npeople because everybody\u2019s hunting me, is hunting every Jew. So why? What is the matter?\nSomething must be wrong with us. So when I told her that, she also started to cry, and -- and we\nwere speaking until four o\u2019clock in the morning, and so -- so this night I really became her\ndaughter, and she my second mother. And we stayed so to th -- she died on my hands with --\nwith the whole -- whole st -- she has a whole story to tell. But even after the liberation, I stayed\nin her family because I had nobody. And then she was arrested and taken to Siberia, of course,\nwas already then, but then she still came back and we were always very close. And I think she\nloved me as well. She was a wonderful, wonderful person. She was a very religious Catholic, but\nnever fanatic. She was a very artistic nature. She loved poetry. She brought me, in those times,\nfor instance, rouge, you know, like blu --",
        "A: -- color, because I was very pale. So -- so that I should a little bit have some color. So, you\nknow, in those times it was absolutely immoral to -- to -- to do such a thing, in the psychology of\nthose times. You have to be very modest, and -- and very, innoc -- but she did it, and I remember\nthis little red box, I had it for a long time. And we were very close, really. Very close. And she\nplayed a big role in my life. She was never fanatic, she was never -- she was taking in everybody.\nAnd she was very demanding only maybe -- she was more demanding from her children than --\nyou know, such discipline then, but she was very demanding of -- to herself, but to other people\nshe was much more -- much softer. Yeah, you wanted to ask me about --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Until she was arrested and even three months more. A-A-And she -- so it was a -- a whole\nstory when Vilnius was liberated already, they -- they -- it started to -- not liberated, but the new\noccupation, but still, I must say for me it was also liberation, because I was not any more afraid\nfor my life. And it was the liberation from Nazis, but we suffered quite -- and I myself suffered\nquite a lot from the Soviets as well. But -- but still the feeling was that now I can go out, I can --\ncan go to school and so on. So, when the bombing started it was dangerous because we lived in\nthe center, Traky -- on Traky Street. So she went out to the outskirts of Vilnius, to a friend,\nPonas Stabinis, and they wer -- he had a cellar and they would sit there in the cellar, the -- and I\nwa -- went with them. But then I decided that I have to save -- I -- to do -- have to do something\nfor her. I loved her like I can\u2019t tell you how. And so -- and we lived in -- in th -- in this big, big\nhouse and courtyard, we were probably the only Lithuanians there. So -- and all the Poles were\naround. And the Poles didn\u2019t like too much Lithuanians. And I knew very well that if we will\nleave at night during the bombing, the flat alone, it will be -- they will take everything away from\nthere. They will break in and loot the -- the -- the flat. So I wanted to -- to -- to save it. Crazy\nidea, but I wanted. So I went back for the night to Vilnius. I was -- I went to the cellar when it --\nwhen the bombs -- there was also a cellar. And I really saved everything. But it -- but one day, I\nthink it was Sunday, the fight started in the street. So I couldn\u2019t get any more daytime to them.\nSo I got stuck there for a whole week. And the m -- the har -- the street was three times, going\nfrom hands to hand, from germ -- from the German Wehrmacht to the Soviet army and -- and\nback. And there were many events there, which I have seen in the killings of -- of -- of 16 years\nold soldiers, who just without anything came down the street from Pilimond, were killed by a --\nby a German tank. Altogether 13 pen -- people, but one we -- we managed to save from there.\nBut however, it was terrible, and I heard the Poles talking, who is this la -- is she lithua -- 1s she\nLithuanian, or is he Jewish -- is she Jewish? And they were not -- and so I thought they want to\ngive me away to the Germans, or what. A-As a Lithuanian they don\u2019t like me either. They\nwanted to get the key from the flat, I didn\u2019t give it to them. But it was already too hard for me\nand on Thursday I felt that I can\u2019t take it any more and I packed two suitcases and wanted to go\non the other side of Neris, into -- in the outskirt of Vilnius where the family was. But when I had\nalready my -- my suitcases ready, the -- the fight started again, I couldn\u2019t leave. And only on\nSunday, when already the Soviet army liberated, then I -- I -- I -- I could get out and a quite\nfamous friend of [indecipherable], Conrad Eskadatskas, he was a -- a -- a com-composer and a --\na conductor and a -- a quite famous musician Lithuania. He came also to see if somebody\u2019s alive\nand then we went with him to the outskirts of Vilnius to see if they are alive. So this was a\nterrible walk through a city full of -- full of fire, full of dust, full of dead people. Terrible,\nterrible. But it was still already a little boat which took us from one side of the Neris to the other.\nAnd then we got to meet each other and -- and this was also a moment which I will never forget\nbecause she couldn\u2019t forgive her how she -- how she didn\u2019t stop me. It was -- it got quite hard to\nstop me. I was stubborn, so -- so that she was happy that we are alive and everybody in the\nfamily remembers this moment, she was happy that I came back. And then I stayed with her. I\nwent to school immediately and -- and then she was arrested in March \u201946, on the 14\" of March.\nAnd I stayed still to the end of the year that the children should finish school. And then we were\nalready spread to different homes, and -- but I was going to all the prisons and -- and bringing\nher food and taking care, and so --",
        "A: Yeah, the Soviet times. The Soviet prisons.",
        "A: No, no, she was -- she was convict -- she was -- she got a sentence co -- aco -- you know,\nthey were called three people who -- who decide, the -- the Troika this was called, w-would\ndecide they -- their fate and their punishment. And so I got to know somehow that this trial will\nbe on [indecipherable] and when she was brought in I -- I was there with my two sisters from --\nfrom her family. And we got from her a little note and I got a present from her. She cut off her --\nthe end of her braid, yeah -- braid, yeah? It\u2019s long hair.",
        "A: Br-Br-Braid --",

I have it, it\u2019s my [indecipherable] I have it until now\nand then she was -- a handmade serviette and a little note and -- and then the -- the -- the Russian\nsoldier who was looking after, he was quite kind, he was giving her my note and -- and giving\nback her present to me so we could communicate a little bit. And then after the sentence was\nalready announced, she was taken with [indecipherable], this is such a black car, which would\ntake the arrested people. And she was -- we saw how she was taken from the -- how she went\nfrom the building to the car.",
        "A: And --",
        "A: The -- eight years at prison and then had no rights for five years to come back to Lithuania.\nSo -- no, sorry, she got 10 years. My friend Tadas got eight years. And -- and then, it was also a\nterrible moment, you know, when she was closed into this c-car, int -- into this black car, and --\nand you saw her, and she is stopped -- you are stopped to -- to communicate with her. And you\nfeel absolutely helpless. You see -- this brutal power you feel, you know, which is just violating\nyou. And I remember this was also a moment when I lost control and I was running behind this\ncar on the street just screaming, and -- but of course the car was faster than me, and couldn\u2019t do\nanything about that, but it was also a -- a moment when you felt the Soviet power, cruelty.",
        "A: She was in prison. She was deported to -- to the sibe -- Siberia and she was there and she was\nreleased in -- in -- 1n fi -- I think after Stalin\u2019s death. She could join, but she cou -- was not\nallowed to come back. She joined there her two sons, who were also deported to Siberia, not in\nconcentration camps, but to work there. They were deported. And then in \u201956 she came back to\nLithuania.",
        "A: Yeah, of course. And she lived for 10 years and then she passed away. But she was very --\nshe was a wonderful person. She helped so many she -- people, she saved so many young girls,\nshe never complained. She never told about her suffering, she told only about how many\nwonderful people she met there, because the elite was in the concentration camps, in the gulag.\nSo she would maybe not have a chance to meet such wonderful people in ordinary life, so -- she\nwas -- she was very strong.",
        "A: Stephania ela -- Pellulitai Ledugania. She comes also from a wonderful family, her\ngrandfather was a caretaker of books. He was kig nashise. This was a -- he was bringing, you\nknow, education to Lithuania. Then the Tsar prohibited the Lithuanian alphabet and -- when it\nwas not allowed to read Lithuanian books. And her father als -- also participate. They were a\nvery, very nice family from -- from Rabalninkai, from the north of Lithuania. And her husband,\nthe general, he could also run away, together with our government in \u201940, but he said that he will\nstay with his soldiers. And of course he was immediately arrested and he was shot it seems, in\n41 or \u00b042. And he was very, also, full of dignity, he never gave in. He got seven shots 1n his\nhead. And she got to know it much later, already wi -- being in Siberia, people still live with the\nslight hope to -- to be -- to -- that their beloved are maybe still alive, you know. And yes, she told\nme also that she took me because she didn\u2019t know my parents, she didn\u2019t know anybody, I was\njust a Jewish girl, and she said that the Jewish population suffered so much here in Lithuania,\nand some Lithuanians were not so kind. So I, as a Lithuanian want to do my best. This was what\nshe said to me as well. And she before -- I learned later on that she would try to help Jews with\nfood in the ghetto. But when I came to Vilnius the ghetto was already liquidated. No sign any\nmore of the ghetto, only ruins. You wanted to ask me something about the ghetto.",
        "A: To hide?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, because how could you hide? It was very -- no, I wa-was never --",
        "A: No, no, I was not connected with any malinas and we were a very such -- I was in a family\nwhere nobody would be able to build a malina or something. And we did not belong to the\nestablishment of the ghetto. Not to [indecipherable] at all. And for instance, my cousin who --\nWalter Mark Ginsberg, who survived in Dachau and he wrote a very nice book, \u201cAnd Kaunas\nWept,\u201d which is published by Bet Shalom in England. He\u2019s -- he lived in England after the war.\nSo he -- he -- th -- th -- we were -- he even has no big sympathy today, iyalas, he\u2019s in some way\naccusing, he doesn\u2019t trust the -- some people of the altestenrat and so on. Like for instance, you\nknow, this famous book which written by Gollup, but now he is not Gollup --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah, Torey. So he was also tyala.",
        "A: Yeah. So my -- my -- my cousin is quite critical. I am a little bit more tolerant. I -- I think\nthere were -- Elkas was a very honest person and we had not the worst altestenrat. I think so.",
        "A: I personal ha -- didn\u2019t have -- I was a child still, you see --",
        "A: -- and -- but -- but still, I for instance -- people who knew my parents and my mother and\nknew that I am a -- a -- a orphan, they -- I -- I got a Jordanschein, which was a paper which like,\ngives you security that you work and -- and you -- you get -- you like, have some security, but it\ndidn\u2019t help. And m -- I got this place to work in the werkstatten after I collapsed at the airport,\nyou know. So this was done by -- by people from -- still from the altestenrat. People who knew\nmy parents. I somehow remember more good things than bad things, you know? This is in my\nnature, probably. Or it helps to survive, I don\u2019t know. I remember how my girlfriend and I, we\ndecided that we have to -- to celebrate the new year, \u201942. And I remember how one Jewish guy\ngave us -- he knew that we -- we want to do it, we had nothing, nothing to eat. So he gave us a\nlittle bagel, but very thin, wi-with a big hole. And we -- when it was 12 o\u2019clock, we were sitting\nand we were dreaming about post-war and so on. And we were talking -- her mother was also\narrested and didn\u2019t come back, never came back. And we shared this little bagel. So this man I\nremember, who gave us the bagel. This was a big thing, to give a bagel. It was like now giving\nyou, I don\u2019t know, thousand dollars.",
        "A: Oh, this is about 1990.",
        "A: When we -- now, the last 14 years.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Please, I can --",
        "A: You see, it is a very hard issue, and very unpleasant issue, and you have here to differentiate\nmany things. First of all you should know that in the Soviet times, nothing was really mentioned,\nand the Holocaust, if it was mentioned, was used mainly only for anti-Fascist propaganda. And\nyou couldn\u2019t even use the word Jew, it was only Soviet citizens and so on. You know that the\nSoviets destroyed finally the big synagogue in Vilna. They destroyed the famous cemetery. I\ndon\u2019t know if you have seen the -- the last pictures of that, it is really an -- and -- and they build\nhouses and -- and ste -- and -- and steps and so on out of this -- of these stones. So there was\nnothing, really, and th-the Jewish life didn\u2019t exist as such, almost. Only maybe for some\npropaganda. And -- and when we became independent and even before the independence, when\nthe Lithuanian revival started, cultural revival and -- and the -- and so on, then also started the\nJewish revival and my colleague, Professor Kudaba, here is his picture. An absolute outstanding\nperson. He was the organizer of the Lithuanian Cultural Society, and then, thanks to him all the\nminorities also organized their cultural societies and the Jewish Cultural Society was organized.\nAnd for the first time all the questions came up about the past and -- and about the future. So --\nso m -- th-th-this -- th-the situation was really m -- very complicated, complex, and you can\nunderstand that a nation who 1s, after being suppressed and occupied for so many years is\nregaining its independence and want to establish itself in the normal democratic world, it\u2019s not\nvery pleasant to talk about participation in the Holocaust. Also, I must say that it was not very --\nit was still, I must say the -- the stereotypes of the -- of the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s were still alive. That the\nJews are traitors, that Jews were communists and so on and so on. So I must say that anti-\nSemitism and the readiness to face the Holocaust was not a -- a simple question. But I must say\nthat on the official level, our government, and especially I would say Vytautas Landsbergis took\nall the really decent steps. First of all, the genocide was condemned. The -- one of the first -- it\nwas -- and it has no -- it -- the people who took part in -- in this genocide can\u2019t be -- can\u2019t be\n[speaks Lithuanian here] I don\u2019t know how to say. They -- they have ever to be, always to be\ncondemned, it doesn\u2019t depend how much time passed away past then. The -- one of the first\nthings the government did was to replace the stones in the -- on the steps of tower of Kaunas, to\ntake all these cemetery stones, gravestones away and put the o -- the other ones, not to go on\nthose [indecipherable] th-the 23\" of September, which was the day of the liquidation of the\nVilnius ghetto was announced as the day of genocide, and it was an order to -- to put out all the\nflags, Lithuanian national flags with -- with a black --",
        "A: -- ribbon, yeah. The Jewish cultur -- the Jewish community was recreated and -- and\nsupported. They cemeteries were looked after and m -- I am very proud that my former student,\nVito Tostalakis was the first. He was a teacher then, he took his -- his pupils and they went to\nclean up a cemetery not far away from Vilnius. And killing places were also, bit by bit, together\nwith the Jewish community, they were cleaned and looked after. And of course, Jews got all the\nrights ar -- citizens and Lithuanians have absolutely equal rights. That --that\u2019s absolutely a matter\nof fact that I would say that maybe a little bit weaker was the question of conde -- of the trials,\nyou know, this Lileikis and so on, but I must still say that on the official level, everything was --\nwas quite okay. And m -- on the academic level, the breakthrough started pro-probably from 795,\nsomething, \u201996. And I look -- came up and there were, especially our young historians, of middle\nage historians were ready to face the truth and -- and more and more information came up about\nthe Holocaust. So I th -- and now we have really already a changed situation on the level of the\n[indecipherable] intellectuals and with -- and not only a civil society is now really a lot\nparticipating already in -- in facing this question. You know that Lithuanian in-intelligentsia\ncreated the house of memory, which is working 1n this direction and -- and they -- they\nannounced already four times a competition, who were the Jewish neighbors -- for schools.",
        "A: Who were the Jewish neighbors of my grand and grand-grand parents. So the children are\ncoming out through all Lithuania, to the little cities and finding out who lived here. And so they\ngo back to history [indecipherable] and -- and learning from -- from this terrible history. And I\nmust say that we made now about 700 schools -- 700 teachers are working with the Holoto-caust\ntopics. Holocaust is told in the military s -- academy, and in military schools and the military\nacademy. A lot 1 -- we have a lot of educational centers who are dealing with that -- with that\nissue. And really hundred, hundred of schools and pupils. We have now, you know, that\nAdamkus created the commission to investigate crimes of Nazi times and gu -- Nazi crimes and\nthe gulag. And we have their commission which also published and found out a lot. I must say\nthat our genocide center, which was first of all like dealing only with the anti-Soviet movement\nis now more and more facing also the Holocaust situation. So I would say that on the academic\nlevel it is -- and such educational level, there is already a breakthrough and a dialog. A lot is\nreally done. I must also say that when Respublika, for instance, published the article of the chief\neditor of the newspaper, a terrible article, \u201cWho rules the world?\u201d And the answer was the Jews\nand the gays. You heard, probably, about this article. So what -- not everybody remembers, but\nyou should remember that the first protest was done by the Lithuanian NGOs, Lithuanian\norganizations and Lithuanian individuals. And during two days, this protest against Tomkus\u2019s\nwriting was signed by about a hundred organizations, about a hundred individual peoples and\nmuch more would sign it if it would -- we would keep -- not me, we -- I didn\u2019t, they didn\u2019t even\nallowed me to sign because I am Jewish. Only Lithuanians signed it, really. So that on --\norganizations, not only individual peoples. So it is really a breakthrough and sometimes you\nshould not forget that it takes time to -- to -- but -- but anti-Semitism is still there and still -- it --\nyou can\u2019t say that it\u2019s all over.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: You see, it -- no, no, no, they -- everybody -- it is hard to recognize, it\u2019s not so easy, but -- but\npeople more and more recognize that some Lithuanians really, they were the executors. Ma -- not\nalways, but mainly. But the initiators of that still were the Germans, the Nazis. And this is also\nclear. You -- this is also a mistake when you put everything only on the shoulders of the -- of\nLithuania. The -- the worst thing is that Lithuanian independence was declared. It lasted only for\nsix weeks, and the administration of -- of -- which had never real power, is temporary\ngovernment, didn\u2019t really know to do a lot about saving Jews. Let us put it openly. So this 1s\nreally when you can ta -- maybe speak about some responsibility. But otherwise they were\nauxiliaries. They helped. Lithuanians helped but I wouldn\u2019t say that -- that it was done without,\nabsolutely without Nazi encouraging. And as you know, in Yager\u2019s -- in Yager\u2019s report, it 1s said\nthat the -- the Nazis could never succeed so well if they couldn\u2019t find so helpful Lithuanian\nauxiliaries, yeah. The partisans who helped them. But -- but still they don\u2019t deny that they were -\n- and they had the full control -- this is what Yager says, from the second of July, they had full\ncontrol of all the executions.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: So they -- they -- it was -- you know, here I -- I must say that I know that I -- I don\u2019t -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t justify killings and so on, but I think that Jews are sometimes too much inclined to blame\nonly Lithuanians. Because they saw like Lithuanians blamed Jews that they made the\ndeportation. It\u2019s just a mytho -- mythology. Jews had no power to make it. This was done by\nMoscow, by the K -- by the NK VD, by the -- by -- by very few Jews and even there were some\nthat were mainly -- mainly executors. But if a Lithuanian saw a Jew coming, so okay, the Jew is\ndeported then, yeah?",
        "A: But they were organized. No, not 15,000, it\u2019s less now. Vu -- vu-vu -- but I don\u2019t want to\nargue about figures, but I want to say that Lithuanians -- Lithuanians were in a terrible situation.\nIn a terrible situation. Here deported, it was a shock to the whole nation. Influenced by a terrible\nNazi propaganda, which was also taken as a tool by Luff and by some Lithuanian officials, yeah.\nThen, I must say that the past, the -- the antagonistic past which existed between Christians and\nJews also had some role to play. So I -- but -- but the nation was really in a shocking -- in a\nterrible -- in a terrible state at this very moment. And it was really, in some way in the beginning\n[indecipherable] and then it came, of course it\u2019s dirty business. But -- but I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t blame\n-- I will never blame a nation because I know that people were absolutely shocked by what\nhappened [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, not many. Not many. How can you say many\u201d? There are not many alive, and -- and\nmaybe -- of course they were -- they\u2019re somewhere hidden. I wouldn\u2019t say that our procurator or\nour court is very much interesting to persecute them. But -- and this is maybe the weakest point,\nbut not only we have problems with our -- with our court and with our procurators, not only in\nthe Jewish commission, in others as well. So, I think, you know, really that --",
        "A: Finished?",
        "A: Yeah, but we stopped at a very -- a very -- a very important point.",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t know how I succeeded, but I tried to explain you the -- how complicated the\nsituation was. And you see, being Jewish, and here is really -- this is very important, that -- and I\nsuffered myself, and Jewish people suffered so much from generalization, from accusing. If one\nJew is bad, all the Jews are so, and so on and so on. So I can\u2019t do it to anybody, you see. And I\nthink that we have to understand, of course in a different degree, but Lithuanians and the Jews\nare victims of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. Lithuanians are also victims, because their\ndeportation to Siberia, the -- the -- the terrible historical period after the second World War,\nwhen Lithuania was still fighting for 1ts independence, and of course it is a very controversial\nmoment. But -- but we have to take it also in account. You -- you can\u2019t see only your own\nsuffering, you see? And therefore, I am very happy I did not -- I didn't want to make you a -- a\npicture that now in Lithuania everything is solved. But a German historian, Joachim Tauber, a\nvery good friend of mine, he told me that in Germany it took 30 years from discussions on the\nacademic level to the conscious of the people to recognize what happened. So, it is also -- we\nhave to be a little bit patient. We can\u2019t -- we can\u2019t, you know, impose this terrible thing, I think it\nwas the biggest tragedy in Lithuanian history, the Holocaust. And I think that for me the\nGermans, th-the Nazis are even worse enemies than the Soviets, why? Because the -- the Soviets,\nwe were still -- Lithuania could -- could resist the Soviets. And -- and -- and they didn\u2019t take\naway the honor of the nation. And the Nazis in this -- in those times, they made out of some\nLithuanian, killers. So you lose your -- it\u2019s hard for me, it is very sensitive, everything, so in -- in\nEnglish it\u2019s very -- quite hard for me to explain it. But you understand, maybe, what I mean.",
        "A: Yeah, they made the situation which --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, many people were brought to justice. First of all, there were Soviet trials --",
        "A: Yeah, there were Soviet trials, which you can\u2019t trust hundred percent.",
        "A: I told you that 1 -- during the independence it 1s not -- it is the weakest point.",
        "A: It\u2019s the weakest point, yeah. It is the weakest point. That\u2019s I must -- I -- I must -- I -- I have to\nadmit. But according to the law they have to be sentenced. And you know how it is very strange,\nbut sometimes it\u2019s probably now you can\u2019t prove there are not enough businesses, I don\u2019t know\nwhat, but of course I would -- I would -- as a Lithuanian I would take the trial those people and I\nwould recognize -- I think that you -- only when you recognize the whole truth, then you are\nliberated, see? But -- but you can\u2019t also impose all the time, on -- on another nation what -- this is\na -- a thing which has to grow out of the nation itself, not imposed by anybody.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: I think that every nation, and we have already enough people who are capable and are taking -\n- Brazauskas even went to Israel and apologized, and he was attacked here for that. But now\nmore and more people understand that maybe he was right. You see, it takes time, it -- I see, in\nthe 14 years already, a big breakthrough. I see also the positive things. And I think that if you\nwant to achieve something, you have to think in positive terms. You can\u2019t accuse all the time\npeople who have already nothing to do with that, you see?",
        "A: And I [indecipherable] for instance, I will -- for me, Holocaust will always be a thing which I\nwill never forget, and I think as a Jewish person I will memorize it. But I don\u2019t want to impose\non others to memorize it. That has to be -- in Israel is had to be memorized forever, but here it\ncan -- it is already a question of -- of the people -- of the local people. And I will tell you,\nrecently I was invited to Siauliai for a talk about tolerance. And I had a big audience, over a\nhundred people, different people, and you know that Siauliai is a city where Murza 1s located, he\nis the new Lithuanian neo-Nazi, Lithuanian fascist. And I got a question, I don\u2019t know if you\nheard about that, that -- that m -- during Christmas, next to the Christmas tree was standing a\nmenorah because last year Hanukah and Christmas was almost the same time. And Murza with\nhis guys came and sir -- oversi -- and -- and crashed this menorah, he was destroying it. So they\nasked me what I think about that. So I answered them like that. You see -- you understand that I\nhave two identities. I am Jewish and I am Lithuanian citizen. And as a Jew, I wouldn\u2019t even put\non the main square, the menorah. I would put the menorah in a place which was maybe a Jewish\nplace or a synagogue, and I would remember and -- and -- th-the day somehow very -- very\nmodest. But as a Lithuanian I would be very happy that the menorah stays next to the tree,\nbecause there are no any more Jews here. There are no any more people can light the candle.\nThere are no people who can be memorized by somebody because there are no Jews any more.\nSo as a Lithuanian, I would like to memorize -- I would happy to ca -- to light the candle for the -\n- my killed compatriots. So you -- can you imagine the -- the reaction was I got applause. And\npeople came then and said that -- thank you.",
        "A: Lam. I am double. I am double.",
        "A: No, there are --",
        "A: -- oh yes, I can give you names of Lithuanians who would say the same, and even more than I\nsaid, because I am still careful, and they would not be careful, they would be much more critical\nabout Lithuanians. I can name such people like Iapramus Markos, Iacunis Markos, Avido\nTostalaikias, Iakeenos Verjunas. Like Ludas Troska, like Guidos Alexandravichas. I can --",
        "A: -- give you a lot of names of Lithuanian --",
        "A: -- yeah. Vytautas Landsbergis told it.",
        "A: He said Vytaus Landsbergis [indecipherable] many years ago that the -- the Holocaust is not\nany more a Jewish problem, it\u2019s a Lithuanian problem. None of -- there are a lot, but not\neverybody wants to hear it. I will give you another example.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: Inside Lithuania and -- doesn\u2019t want to hear it, and -- and I must say that the Jewish approach\nis sometimes also a little bit --",
        "A: Non -- non -- no -- non -- anti-Lithuanian and non-sensitive. And I really don\u2019t agree with\nthat. I will give you another example. Yo -- yud -- yudka -- Judel Bayli -- Baylis who was\nalready twice going through all Lithuanian scho -- many Lithuanian schools to talk about his\nstory, and meet with children. And he was always nicely very met, because he is really -- he\u2019s an\n-- he is a goodhearted person.",
        "A: Charming person, yeah. And once after his talk, a Lithuanian boy came and he said -- he\nasked him -- he was almost in tears, he said, Ponas Baylisi -- Mr. Baylis, my grandfather was sh -\n- was a Jew killer, what should I do? What should I do? Because he was shocked by all that,\nwhat he said. So he embraced him, he kissed him and he told him, you have already done. You\nun -- realize it, you understand it. You are not guilty, you can\u2019t be guilty. And the -- and they\nseparated as friends, you see? He didn\u2019t -- or I can give you another example of my experience. I\ntook in a Lithuanian girl to live, just -- she li -- she lived [indecipherable] I was asked by my\nfriends to take her in. And in Lithuania really aba -- almost everybody was told that the Jews are\nusing blood for matzos. And she lived with me and after half a year she told me that she was told\nshe shouldn\u2019t go to live with a Jewish woman, because she always will have some blood on her\nbody, Christian blood. And -- and th -- sh -- now I must admit, she said, that I was watching you\nall the time. I was watching through the keyhole when you were in the bathroom if you had\nblood or not. And now I know that you don\u2019t have it. So I also embraced her. I told her, my dear\nfriend, I\u2019m happy that you realize now that there are a lot of mythology. I don\u2019t accuse you\nbecause if 1t was told -- y-you were told by your grandmother or by your mother, or by your aunt\nabout that, why shouldn\u2019t you believe them? Why should you believe me? But now I am very\nhappy that -- so you -- you -- you didn\u2019t commit a crime. But now you know, and you can say to\nthe others that this is not true.",
        "A: You see, so we had no -- I was not hating her that she is -- she has a s -- prejudice.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I lost my whole family.",
        "A: There is no other way. You know, Sisyphus, he was pushing the stone up the hill, always\nknowing that the stone will fall down. But still he did it because he had no other way to live. So I\nhave also no other way to live. And if I can help one soul, one person to get rid of hatred and to\nget rid of suspicion and -- and understand another -- we -- we speak always all -- we have to\nunderstand the other, that we shouldn\u2019t be always treated as the other, but we ourselves are\ntreating very often the others as the others. I can tell you another story of a family, I can even\nmention the name, it\u2019s William Good, who was jumping out of the Paneru -- Paneru pit, he was\nshot, but he was alive and he escaped and then he survived, also helped by Christian people, but\nin the woods. And -- and his wife is also a Polish wil -- a -- a Jew from Vilna, a Polish orient --\nmore oriented than Lithuanian. And he was also from Vilna and they had a lot of prejudice\nagainst Lithuanians because for them -- I understand it also, because after the war I was even\nasked by people, how can you live in a -- in a country which is soaked with blood, with Jewish\nblood? So -- and they were so full of -- of -- of I don\u2019t know, fi -- some feelings, anti-Lithuanian\nfeelings. And then I told them that you can\u2019t generalize it. There are such wonderful Lithuanian\npeople. Such wonderful people. And I brought them into a family of wonderful Lithuanian\npeople and they came and they talked and they shared and they were, you know, even crying\ntogether. And when we went out, Parella, the wife of William Good told me, Irena, thank you\nvery much. You take from us away the burden of hatred. I think hatred is the most terrible thing.",
