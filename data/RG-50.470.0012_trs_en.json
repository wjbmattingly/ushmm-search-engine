I was given no instruction as to what I would do\nnor did anybody advise me. I just found myself with the\nmedical team in the camp. And the, I had to determine what\nI was to do, and that of course was a development which\nbegan with my coming and lasted with a period of\npractically, approximately five years.\nSWB: You told once about how difficult for you to actually\ngo up and enter the camp, can you tell me about that?\nRABBI ABE KLAUSNER: Well my first experience with uh _ the\nliberated was terribly devastating, by virtue of the fact\nthat I realized that they weren't liberated. The camps were\nopen so to speak, but the people weren't uh taken in hand\nand uh comforted and provided with necessities and told that\nnow you'll have a place to sleep, things to do and they'll",

They uh\noccupied more or less the same uh ambience that they uh\noccupied uh before the liberation, with the exception of\ncourse, they weren't going to be killed. And they were\ngoing to be fed. Dachau was an exception in the sense that\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/10/95 RABBI ABRAHAM KLAUSNER\nPage 2\nthey were also going to be taken care of medically. We had\nuh three medical units, the 116th, the 127th evac, and the\ntenth field hospital which was nearby at another camp called\nAllach. And for a short period of time, oh perhaps uh four\nto six weeks maybe a little longer, the hospital units uh\ndrawn from the military, remained in the area taking care of\nthe immediate problems of the uh sick and the dying.\nSWB: Tell me about first going through the gate and then\ngoing into a barrack for the first time.\nRABBI ABE KLAUSNER: Well I came uh into Dachau at night uh,\nand uh I saw nothing except the main square coming through",
        "the big gates. And of course uh I waited for the morning\nquite anxiously and when morning came uh I uh walked through\nthe barbed wire gates into the barracks area, and uh\nselected one of the barracks. I entered and there met\u2019 the\nfirst of the survivors. Uh it was a uh difficult experience\nfor me because I was not confident that uh I could serve a\npurpose. I had nothing to offer, I had nothing to give.\nPeople needed amenities, needed attention of various kinds,\nand I had nothing, but nevertheless there I was in Dachau\nand I felt I had to do something, and so I entered the\nbarracks and stood there, terribly disturbed. Here we were\nin a period of liberation and the people were still in\nbarracks, stretched out on shelves, there were three rows of\nshelves, nothing other than the shelves, there wasn't a-a-a-\npiece of linen of any kind, there wasn't a bar of soap,\nthere wasn't a chair, place to sit down, it was just a uh, a\nuh dirty uh-uh situation and uh here were the people uh\neither stretched out on the shelves or uh moving about\nlistlessly. Paid no attention to me as if I didn't exist.\nNo one came towards me to say welcome or uh what is it you\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/10/95 RABBI ABRAHAM KLAUSNER\nPage 3",
        "want. They just uh, I was just an apparition. Until one\nuh, one uh of the liberated, of the survivors walking around\ncame, Stared at me and finally looked up at me and uh, asked\nme a strange question. I remember it very distinctly. He\nasked me if I knew his uncle, gave me his name, in Toledo.\nAnd I was taken aback, that was the first conversation that\nI had with the, with the liberated. And I stood there lost,\nnot knowing what to do or what to say. I waS wearing a\nraincoat at the time and in my pocket I had =Ilittle\ncellophane packages of Bizouzot, they were these little uh\nuh symbols uh that the Jewish welfare board had made and\ndelivered to chaplains for distribution to soldiers and for\na moment I thought I would take out a few of these and hand\nthem out. But as I thought about it I thought that would be\nugly, it would be to-to-to to respond to a great tragedy\nwith a little icon of some sort didn't s-seem to be the\nproper thing to do. And then I was saved. I call it the\nepiphany. A voice came from one of the uh, one of the\nshelves, very thin voice, crying so to speak, and uh it said\nto me, I had a brother, we grew up together in our village\nbut my brother left and went to the United States and there\nbecame a Rabbi. And he continued to speak but at that\npoint, uh, when he said he became a Rabbi, I interrupted him\nand said I know your brother. He is here in Europe. And\nthen the voice began again to cry and say, don't be\ncompassionate for the sake of compassion, he assumed that I\nwas just going to be nice, uh, but it was uh, ae strange\nmoment. I said no uh, my voice over his uh, I'm gonna bring",
        "you your brother. And I left the barracks at that moment\nbecause I couldn't handle it beyond that. And uh, on _ the\noutside of the barrack, I now felt that there was a purpose\nin my coming, if nothing more, I was gonna bring him his\nbrother. Of course people ask me, when I tell the story,\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/10/95 RABBI ABRAHAM KLAUSNER\nPage 4\nhow did you come to this uh, this moment. Well I traveled\nwith 250 officers uh, in the United States to Scotland,\nEngland, across the channel, we were in box cars across\nFrance, in the back of the bulge in the Battle of the Bulge,\nand that voice, the lilt in that voice I had heard it\nbefore, and to me there was no question about it, and-and\nand I was so familiar with the rhythm, the lilt of the\nvoice, that I immediately assumed that the voice that I\nheard in the boxcar, n- in the travels, was it the brother.\nAnd uh it turned out I was correct, I uh, found the brother\nand I brought them together. This was my first, not only\nexperience, it was the thing that uh, that uh encouraged me\nto an odyssey that stretched over uh the four or five years\nworking with the displaced persons.",
        "SWB:\nRABBI ABE KLAUSNER: No uh, first of all uh, I saw it\u2019 only\nfrom the so-called area of Dachau. I didn't know what\u2019 was\nhappening beyond the gates of Dachau at the moment. Uh, I\nwas confident in those days that it wasn't really a serious\nproblem, the sick were being taken care of by the 116th\nevac. And uh I knew, I was confident that the next day or\ntwo or three days that all the great American institutions,\nespecially the Jewish institutions would be there. And _ uh\nthey would do what had to be done to-to-to give these people\nthe redemption that should have been offered them.\nSWB:\nRABBI ABE KLAUSNER: Well when uh the-the-the question that\nthis-this figure asked me about his uncle in Toledo bothered\nme. I just didn't dismiss it. And I began to think about\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/10/95 RABBI ABRAHAM KLAUSNER\nPage 5\nit and I realized that it wasn't really a-a question, it was\na prayer. Uh, the man wanted to be connected with life",
        "again, with a relative, so uh, that started me off on the\nproject which became Known as the Sheritaplaytom[?]. I-I\nimmediately walked out of one section of-of the camp where,\ninto another, and I got a hold of some of the um, _ the\nSurvivors that were walking around and I said, we got to\nstart listing the names of uh who has survived, and we-we\nestablished a formula, we would get the name, date and place\nof birth, and the fact that they are presently...\n[CAMERA RELOAD]\n[CR#2 ]\nSWB: Can you tell me about religious ceremonies for the\nSurvivors early on, do you remember any instances where\npeople prayed....\nRABBI ABE KLAUSNER: I uh, wasn't uh, aware of uh a\nreligious uh factor playing a role in the sense of ritual or\nthings of that sort uh. Uh there were little moments which\nwere of a religious nature uh that I was involved with but\nuh, it didn't seem to be something that had to _ be\nrepresented uh, assuming that it was felt. For example, I\nhad decided that we would have a, uh a kind of a\nThanksgiving service at one of the camps, uh, in Munich, at\nthe edge of Munich. And uh I had a case of uh prayer books,\nthe JWB, the Jewish Welfare Board prayer book that was\nprepared for soldiers, and I came and there was ae big\nassembly of survivors, and uh we passed out the prayer",
        "books, and when the service began, there wasn't a prayer\nbook in sight, it completely disappeared. I didn't\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/10/95 RABBI ABRAHAM KLAUSNER\nPage 6\nunderstand then at the moment what was happening but later\nof course it all became clear to me. The, there were\nmoemtns which were ritually connected, which spoke about\nreligious practice. I could tell you the story of uh, of\nsome women that I had found in the Alps. I was on my way to\nItaly because uh, we were going to establish a kind of a,\nescape route, of getting survivors over to Italy where they\nwould be able to take the illegal ships to Palestine. And\non my way, traveling with a doctor, always traveled with a\ndoctor, I hit upon a sign that indicated that in one of the\nvalleys of the Alps, there were some DP'S. So we made that\ntrip, it was a difficult trip, we finally came to the end of\nthe valley actually, and uh found a series of barracks, and\nentered one in which there were quite a number of Hungarian\nJewish women. And we were the first uh to connect with them\nin terms of the world Jewish community and these women. And\nit was my practice of course to carry lists of names in my\npocket, and I pulled out all the lists and I put em on _ the",
        "table and they all fell on the table, starting to scratch\nfor the names to see if they could connect with one of the\nnames. And while this was going on, a young girl, I don't\nknow, maybe 16 or 17, walked out of this area of this room\nand returned ina little while with a prayer book. I didn't\nknow it was a prayer book at the moment. And then she held\nit up from the distance and said see what I have. It's my\nprayer book. And then she added to that, I brought it from\nthe ghetto. Of course this, [laughs] this was a kind of\nexcitement because I knew the procedure by this time, that\nyou couldn't take anything into, in-into a concentration\ncamp. [coughs] People were stripped of any possessions they\nhad and there was no way of carrying a prayer book into a\ncamp and uh holding onto it, and I of course asked, how did\nyou do it, and she told me that when they gave her her first\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/10/95 RABBI ABRAHAM KLAUSNER\nPage 7\nallocation of bread, they gave her a heel of a loaf, and she\ncut or tore a slice but not completely, made a hinge of it.\nAnd then dug out the crumbs in the heel of a loaf of the\nbread, and put her little prayer book and carried the bread\nwith her and of course bread was something you weren't going",
        "to, you weren't going to steal one from the other, and_ so\nforth. Y- this was one of the religious elements in terms\nof uh, uh then of course in time uh, as people settled in\nthe camps, they took on their uh religious practices, and I\ndealt with them accordingly. The Klausenberg Rabbi, the\ngreat Hassidic leader whom I found in Dachau, we nourished\nhim back to health and then brought him to Feldafing, he had\nsome disciples, and so we have a whole history with him. I\nfound uh in one of the uh, buildings, in Munich, a large uh-\nuh Polish Hebrew library that the Nazis had uh had uh\nconfiscated. And every time I would pass the building, I'd\ngo in and take a few of the volumes and then on my way to\none of the camps I would drop them off so that the people\nwho were interested uh, would have uh, have the text of the\ntradition in front of them. Uh, religion didn't play a-a\ndominant role in the sense that we were doing things\nreligiously. Religion manifested itself in terms of the\nbehavior of the people as they related to the faith prior to\ntheir coming into the camp and uh, whatever the camp uh\nwould uh allow them.\nSWB: Tell me your impressions of the problems that existed\nin most of the DP camps very early on. Describe the\nconditions.\nRABBI ABE KLAUSNER: The camps, to begin with, were not\nJewish camps. They were collecting points. Other words,\nDachau was liberated and uh the people in Dachau were in",
        "Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/10/95 RABBI ABRAHAM KLAUSNER\nPage 8\nDachau. Now the Feldafing camp which was uh = south of\nDachau, came about because when the American forces came\nthrough the area, particularly the community of Tutzing,\nthey found this company of Survivors, that is of DP's, that\nthe Germans were moving from one place to the other to get\nthem away from the oncoming allied forces. But by the time\nuh the Americans got there the Germans have fled and _ the\npeople were there. And now it became the job of Army to do\nsomething with them, so they assigned an officer and said,\ndo something with them. And they ended up in what we call\nan SDAP school, this was a school uh that uh-uh that trained\nthe children of the elite, Nazis, for positions, for\npositions in-in-in in the party and in the government. And\nso these people were then pushed into this camp, same thing\nhappened in lkLandsberg, a series of camps called the\nKalfering camps. Uh, same thing happened in Mithenwald, and\nwe had wherever we went there were these collecting points,\nand each one was handled differently depended upon who was\nhandling it, there wasn't a general policy, there wasn't a\nprogram, there wasn't an, a department within the military\nto say we're going to take care of these people. There",
        "wasn't an institution, the UNRHA wasn't there, the American\nJoint Distribution Committee wasn't there, no one was there.\nAnd so it became a makeshift operation and depending upon\nthe officer in charge, you'd get either a better or a worse\nSituation. But the camp itself was really incapable because\nof, to handle the people and so you had a kind of a, tragic\nuh, uh I wouldn't call it poverty but absence of any uh\nsensible response to the people that had suddenly been\nliberated, and that became one of the first problems.\nSecondly, the fact that they were locked up, barbed wire,\nthey couldn't they had no freedom, couldn't get out one in\nthe morning and say I'm going to take a walk through the,\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/10/95 RABBI ABRAHAM KLAUSNER\nPage 9\nthrough- through the village, or the countryside. Uh, they\nhad no name, no name was allowed them. They didn't have an\nidentity card. They were just a mass of people which the\narmy was gonna herd from one place to the other, and that\nbecame the basic element with which we had to deal.\nSWB:",
        "RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: The uh logic of the situation was not\nsomething that that we debated or the people, the people uh-\nuh reflected on. The people, uh, faced the problems of\ntheir own connections, their own identity, and so that was\ntheir primary concern. Uh, what was happening to the\nperpetrators, the Germans and so forth, this really was not\nsomething that we were, just about to-to-to waste our energy\non.\nSWB:\n[CAMERA RELOAD]\n[CR#3]\nSWB: Tell me also about the problem that existed early on\nof mixed nationalities in the displaced persons camp, why\nwas that a problem.\nRABBI ABE KLAUSNER: The problem of the camps uh was in\nterms of the mixture that the animosities between the groups\npersisted even though they had in one form or another\ncommonly been oppressed by the Germans. Once the liberation\ntook place, old animosity surfaced, and some became quite\nintense. And uh we would be faced with the reality that\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.",
        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/10/95 RABBI ABRAHAM KLAUSNER\nPage 10\nfrom day to day people were actually killed, and uh, the\ndead rose in number and uh, it was obvious to me that uh,\nsomething had to be done. Secondly, in terms of the Jewish\nSurvivor, I felt that in order to restructure a living\npattern and to uh uh excite some kind of a ecultural\ndevelopment or a return to a- a previous rhythm of life, we\ncouldn't do it in amixture. There was no way of uh dealing\nwith one group and not dealing with another group. And uh I\nwasn't prepared to serve other than a response to the Jewish\nSurvivor. And so I decided that we're going to have to have\nsegregated or Jewish camps. And so I took the matter up\nwith some military figures and they were against it, but\neventually we devised a way in which they would not have to\ntake a position in favor of separate camps, and yet allow me\nto create Jewish camps.\nSWB: Did they simply not understand...\nRABBI ABE KLAUSNER: They were prompted by a, the general\nAmerican concept of uh of uh multiculturalism, in other\nwords, as one officer said to me, after all we're Americans,\nwe're we-we uh uh are proponents of democracy, of-of\ncontaining people within a common objective. And here\nyou're coming and saying to, to us after the war which we",
        "fought in terms of a democratic uh concept that you're going\nto go back on it and you're gonna separate the people. And\nI said theoretically, you're absolutely correct. But in\npractice, it just won't work at this time and in this place.\nAnd so uh, we were able to make a kind of a deal which I was\nable to create, the camps.\nSWB: Tell me about what length people would go to find\nSurviving members of their families.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/10/95 RABBI ABRAHAM KLAUSNER\nPage ll\nRABBI ABE KLAUSNER: The-the compulsion, or the drive was so\ngreat that people broke out of camps and walked, traveled,\nthere weren't any forms of transportation across\nCzechoslovakia, Poland, into Russia, looking for uh, for-for\nuh, fragments of families, and people came out of East\nEurope into Munich, and we set up a large tracing program.\nBesides the-the books that were published uh we had a center\nin Munich at the Deutschishe museum for, where people came\nfrom all over Europe and uh, uh came asking about\u2019 their\nfamily. Interesting thing was that we put a table out in",
        "the lobby, so to speak, people would come and tear the pages\nout of the book and we would have to feed the table with\nbooks and then we would nail the pages down so they would\nlast a little longer. But if a person came and found no\nname in the book, they would go over to the wall, it was a\nvery large wall, and they write a note on the wall saying\nfor example, I was here, addressing it to a parent or to a\nchild. I've been looking for you, and I will be here or\ngoing there so that there'd be some point at which they\nmight be able to connect. We were very much involved in\nlooking for children in uh Eastern Europe, people who had\nleft their children either with Christian friends or others.\nWanted to find those children and so we had to set up a\nprogram for the search of children, which was haphazard but\nin many cases it was very effective.\nSWB:\nRABBI ABK KLAUSNER: Well uh, as I came to know the-the-the\ncontours of the problem and realized that Dachau was\u2019 only\none little place, and that throughout Bavaria, there were\npockets of survivors and news came to me, military people\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.",

And so I got to know this\nperson, he turned out to be uh a person from Kobne, his name\nwas Shalatin at the time, Levy, he had been a- young\njournalist and he had worked uh in uh as a journalist, and\nuh, we then started to explore how we could uh publish a\nnewspaper.

So uh\nLevy uh offered if I would provide for his transportation,\ncause of a problem, he was a DP, he couldn't travel, he had\nno identity, couldn't get out.
