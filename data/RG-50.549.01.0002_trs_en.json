        "https://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 1995\nQ. This is the interview with Agnes Adachi. I wanted to go\nback during the war a little bit. You mentioned your family and\nyour father losing his business because of the wall street crash.\nWhat was your father's business when you were in Budapest?\nA. He was a textile manufacturer and he had a big textile store\nin Budapest, but that was in the 20s. Instead of coming here, he\npicked up and went all the way to Turkey, with Phillip's Radios\nand at that time the Turks thought the radio was a spy thing, and\nyou could only listen in the nights. In the day time you\ncouldn't use any radio and we were there six months. I was about\nseven.\nQ. You were in what city?\nA. Now, it is Istanbul. It was Constanilopal. It was a very\nexciting time and I will never forget it, even so I was very\nlittle.\nQ. When you came back to Budapest, what did your father do?\nA. Well, he went back again and he worked in textiles. Not on\nhis own, but it went. I can't even remember it. It was a very\ntough time, quite a tough time. But honestly we did not feel\nanti-semitism as other countries because my father himself he had\nso, so many Christian friends and we never heard \"Hey, you're a\nJew because your name is Mandle.\" Nothing, and I was growing up\nin a Protestant school and I was the only Jewish child for four\nyears, the first four years and the Hebrew and Judaism I learned",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "from my Protestant teacher. It was very interesting.\nQ. Was there any anti-semitism going on in the city directed at\nyour friends, anything you heard on the street?\nA. Not then, you see this was still before Hitler, in the 30s\nand I constantly traveled and my last trip -- or my first trip\nalone was to go to Berlin, the olympic games in 1936 and of\ncourse Hitler and Goebles and everybody was there. I was\nsupposed to go the year before because I had dear friends there\nwho thank God I saved, but it's a long story not for you maybe\nand I was supposed to go as my graduation present and I got\nscarlet fever so I couldn't go. So, they said then you come over\nfor the olympics and during the olympics Hitler did not do\nanything to the Jews. They even had still a Jewish tennis club,\nwhere my friends belongs. It was interesting, and I saw Jesse\nOwens, flying by, flying, not just running, you know, he won, and\nhe gave the dirtiest look up to Gerring, to show that me, the\nblack man, I'm going to win, and he sure did.",
        "So, that was my last time over there, but then I started to\ntravel and I was going to England, to Italy, I'm a Montessori\nteacher and I learned from Mother Montessori herself in 1937,\nbefore she died in Rome, so I was a whole year in Rome, which was\nabsolutely wonderful.",
        "Then I went to England and I lived there for a year. Then I\nwent back to Switzerland because I have a big family, and I also\nwanted to learn French. I was a house -- how do you call them\nhere, too? I was helping in the house with two children in the\nhouse, but they were wonderful with me. They became good friends",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Agnes Adachi 3\nOctober 14, 1995\nand I lived in Geneva until 1942 when very dear friends of our\nsaid, \"go home, nothing 1S going to happen in Hungary and you're\nthe only child and be home.\" I went home.\nQ. Were you hearing anything about what was going on in the\nrest of Europe even if it wasn't directed --?\nA. Well, I tell you, I was not a zionist and I\"m still not but\nthere waS a zionist congress in Geneva in 1939, in September and\nto relax most of the people were Polish and they were all out on\nthe bach and one day on the ninth of September, the radio was\nblaring that Hitler moved into Poland and I will never forget,\nthat was in my book too, you probably read it, it was horrifying\nto see the faces of these people and whether their family is\nstill alive by the time they go home, whether they can go home at\nall. I was standing there and I said oh my God if I could just\nhelp. I never thought the time will come that I was going to\nhelp. I couldn't believe it that this can happen. None of us\nbelieved it.",
        "When I came back to Hungary they still showed American films\nin 1942, and I was teaching English at that time. I spoke the\nKing's English, really without an accent. Everybody thought I\nwas a British lassie, and we were forbidden to talk English on\nthe street, but we could say that we were foreigners. I was\nteaching Congressmen Lantosh's wife. She was nine years old and\nshe looked like Shirley Temple and I was teaching her English.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Agnes Adachi 4\nOctober 14, 1995\nThen suddenly from Romania, from Czechoslovakia, from Poland\npeople escaped to Hungary and they told us all these stories. We\ndidn't believe either that it was possible.",
        "It's funny that you don't believe. Why don't you believe?\nWe should have and we could have all stood up for it, but we just\ncouldn't imagine. So, our house was really full constantly with\nRumanians or Czechoslovakians who somehow we knew from the old\ntimes. They came to our house, those who very few of them could\ngo on somewhere else, but most of them got stuck in Hungary.\nQ. What were they telling you that you couldn't believe? What\nwere some of the things that you couldn't believe?\nA. That they just walked in and took their house away. They\nkilled some of their families and that they had no rights\nanymore. There were no people anymore and they had to wear the\nyellow star, what they took off as they came to Hungary. But it\nwas unbelievable that anybody can come to your house and say get\nout. Something you worked all your life for. In America, too, I\nthink nobody ever believed that Hitler was doing things like\nthat.\nQ. Did you talk to your parents about it?\nA. Not really. No, we didn't. We didn't have the stars yet,\nbecause the Hungarian Nazis weren't yet there, and they came in\n\"43 and then my father was taken to a labor camp and we were\nfrantic but one of his Christian friends went and brought him",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Agnes Adachi 5\nOctober 14, 1995\nright back.\nQ. Tell me about that? What happened?\nA. We don't know. He just walked in and said \"You can't take\nthis man. He's helping everybody in Budapest and I am so and\nso,\" and they gave him Papa back, and he came home. But he never\nwent out on the street again. He was scared.\nQO. When was he taken?\nA. In '43, right when the Hungarian Nazis arrived. Their name\nwas the Arrowcross, but he stayed home and we still been in the\nsame house. We had the apartment where we lived and we knew\nevery neighbor. Life sort of went on, except that as I said we\nhad these foreign people living with us and then two Frenchmen\narrived, who only after the war we found out that they were\nFrench underground. Through some friends they found us and so\nthey stayed with us.\nQ. Let me go back and ask you just a little about your dad\nagain. Were you at home when he was taken away?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Tell me about what happened?\nA. Well, they just said you have to come to a labor camp. Papa\nlooked at us with tears in his eyes. We couldn't do anything.\nWhat can you do? Shoot the man? Then we would have been shot\nourselves. Immediately I picked up the phone and called his\nfriends and he brought him home almost the next day. It was",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Agnes Adachi 6\nOctober 14, 1995\nlucky. Oh, the Hungarians were even worse than the Germans.",
        "We didn't have too much money, because if you have, in\nHungary, you could pay the police, you could pay them off in many\nways. Raoul did that many times. He came with liguor and\nchampagne and money and just paid them off. That's how they\nhelped him.",
        "It was rotten. I worked, at that time I worked in the\nfamous Ritz Hotel where Hilton learned there how to run the\nhotel. I remember the morning, that was March 1944 already, when\na very excited neighbor came to us -- I think you read that in my\nbook, maybe I shouldn't repeat it. He said that he just heard by\nthe BBC, we were not allowed to listen to the BBC but of course\neverybody did, and I had a big short wave radio, so that's how we\nknew what was happening in the world because I listened to that\nradio. That Admiral 1S coming on the air and he's going to tell\nthe world that he's not with the Germans anymore, he's now with\nthe Allies.",
        "My father ran for the champagne and the glasses and I said,\nPapa don't believe what you hear. Oh, you're too young. You\ndon't know this. Okay, he pours it in, comes on the\nair and he went as far as saying and now we happily tell you that\nwe are now with the Allies. In that moment, a German",
        "comes on the air. His voice is cut off. I drop my\nchampagne glass and suddenly we hear airplanes, and I was sure it",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Agnes Adachi 7\nOctober 14, 1995\nwas the Americans and the British. I run out. I dropped my\ndrink, and I ran all the way -- it was a gorgeous sunny day, and\nI looked up and all these black things. I said here the\nAmericans and the British are coming, so I was running all the\nway to the hotel, and as I walk in the porter says, the manager\nwants to see you, who was a darling man. He was a Yugoslavian,\nguite an old gentleman. He spoke 12 languages, perfectly, no\naccents.",
        "I ran into him and he took me in his arms and he said in\nEnglish, \"Child, these are not the British and not the Americans.",
        "These are Germans. I want you to go home. I don't want you to\nbe taken from here.\" He wished me all the good luck and we\nkissed and I went.",
        "I made it home, and then we were waiting and we thought what\nthe people told is probably true and maybe tomorrow we have to be\nout of here. We got the star and we didn't go out very much,\nbecause it was frightening.",
        "Q. What was it that made it frightening? Were you hearing\nabout people --?",
        "A. What we heard from the other people. The Rumanians and all,\nso we knew that at any moment we will be picked up and taken too.\nBut somehow, I don't know why, I can't answer you that because",
        "it was a miracle that we were not taken.\nQ. If you couldn't get outside, how did you get food?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Agnes Adachi 8\nOctober 14, 1995\nA. Well, we still had a wonderful maid who was Christian and\nshe wouldn't leave us. She lived not there, but she went\nshopping. She did everything and she did come all the time. I\ndid dare to go out, you know, because I was always a little",
        "kid. I said nobody can tell me what to do, and I go.\nBut not as much then after I met Raoul, then I became much much\nstronger and I wish that the whole world would understand too\nthat the Jews too shouldn't have just gone up to the people but\nthey should have stood up and fighted, but they didn't.",
        "So, well, we waited and waited.",
        "Q. You met Raoul Wallenberg very soon after you arrived in\nBudapest, it seems?\nA. Yes, if you remember in my book, I was the guest of the\nSwedish government for three weeks so I knew Pat Unger. He was\nminister. I was guest up there and I felt very guilty because I\nleft my parents down in the apartment, but they promised they\nwould look after my parents and they will help them, so they keep\nan eye on them. After three weeks my friend, who took me up\nthere, who was also a Christian and he was in love with my cousin\nand he said, she has to go home. The parents had to be moved out\nof the house, so they took them out, because the Hungarians\nthought if every second house in Budapest 1S going to be a house\nwith a then the Americans won't bomb the city. How\nstupid.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Agnes Adachi 9\nOctober 14, 1995",
        "Just as many Jews died as Christians because they didn't see\nnumber one, the on the house, but my parents had to\nmove out but thank God my grandmother's house became a house with\na and they moved in there. There was no elevator in\nthe house or anything so there was my mother, my father, my aunt,\nmy cousin, the very best friend with her Christian boyfriend at\nthat time. What was funny he wouldn't move away either. There\nthey were. It wasn't comfortable. It wasn't good. Grandma\nwasn't, thank God, not alive anymore.",
        "So, Mr. Dan Olsen said she can't go, we are responsible for\nher, and Is aid I already feel guilty that I had these three\nweeks of heaven, but my parents can be killed because the\nHungarian Nazis came every day with the list of people and they\nwere reading. My name was still on, and Mike, the friend of my\ncousin said that if she's dead, maybe they'll kill the whole\nfamily because they can't find her.",
        "So, I went home with these diplomats because he wanted to\nsee which house I am in and he put down the number and he said\nevery time we were allowed one hour a day to go out to do our\nshopping and he said when you go out the telephone still works,\nplease call. And I called almost every day and after three weeks\nsuddenly they said come up at once, something happened, and there\nwas Raoul Wallenberg.",
        "Because I ha been there and lived there naturally I was his",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Agnes Adachi 10\nOctober 14, 1995\nfirst helper.\nQ. Let me ask you, too, when you would go out to go shopping\nwas there enough to eat, and if you were in the house all the\ntime, what did you do to keep busy?\nA. You know what we did, listen to beautiful recordings of\nGilli. That was, as you probably remember in the book, too, that\nthere was this wonderful song \"Mama\" that I still sing many\ntimes. I was crying, because after all I left my parents for\nthree weeks by themselves, which was very selfish I think, but I\nwas young and I wanted to live. I think it's sort of a natural\nthing.",
        "But now we were together and we always listened to this, and\nthen the short wave radio said that Gilli is dead. When I came\nto Rome I walked into a place because outside it said Gilli is\ngoing to play and I walked in and I said Gilli is dead. He said\nNo, no, he was not dead.",
        "QO. Who is Gilli?",
        "A. Gilli was one of the most famous opera singers of Italy.",
        "QO. So, you would listen to music?",
        "A. That's all, and reading and writing because I was always a\nwriter.",
        "Q. And your parents, what would they do?",
        "A. Nothing. Just sitting, nothing. What could they do?\nTalking to eachother, listening to the BBC. There was nothing we",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Agnes Adachi 11\nOctober 14, 1995\ncould do. Nobody could do anything, and that was the horrifying\nthing too. Trying to strengthen each other, that was about all\nwe could do.",
        "So, after I met Raoul and Raoul and Pat Unger looked at me\nand he said here is a piece of paper -- you read that too, I\nthink, so I shouldn't repeat this.",
        "Q. Let me ask you, sort of on a daily basis, what was your work\nlike? What did you do when you were working with Wallenberg?",
        "Not the specific things like the rescue in the river, but ona\nmore day to day basis?",
        "A. Well, it was sort of hostessing because there were thousands\nof people outside who came with their pictures so that we can put\nit on the passes. Did you see the passes because I have the real\nones here and my passport too. The real ones, not fakes.",
        "That's what I did. I talked to the people, and that too is\nprobably exactly what you want. One afternoon, you now, if you\never worked for a foreign diplomatic place, you know that three\no'clock in the afternoon they close, never mind the war or not,\nand at three o'clock there is this banging on this door outside.",
        "I opened it and there is a gentleman standing with four\npictures. He said, please just give us four more passes and I\nSaid sorry sir, but the minister is leaving. Oh, please, please,\nplease. I said, okay, I'll talk to him, give me the pictures. I\nwalked in and I said, \"Minister Dan Olsen,--\" they realized that",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Agnes Adachi 12\nOctober 14, 1995\nRaoul never, never signed not one. It was his idea, but it's\nonly Dan Olsen who signed them.",
        "I went in and he said I have a date at 3:30 and I said,\n\"Sir, four more people's lives\" He said okay okay and he signed\nthese papers. And I gave it back to these gentlemen and he\nthanked me very much and 50 years pass and who thinks of the war.",
        "I had a Hungarian doctor here. I had tonsillectomy and he was\nup at Riverside. He had a beautiful townhouse there and his\nliving room was his waiting room. One day I'm sitting there\nwaiting and reading a paper and down the steps comes an elderly\ngentleman and starts screaming. You saved my life, you saved my\nlife. I didn't think he talks to me and I looked around what is\nthis man talking. Suddenly he's down on his knees kissing my\nhands and right away I said politely I said uncle. In Hungarian\nI said what are you doing? He said don't you remember, four\npeople, I gave you the pictures, and this was the man and this\nwas his brother in law. It's a small world. It was very\nembarrassing also because everybody looked at me. That's what\nhappened and somehow he survived with those passes. But if I\ndon't talk to Dan Olsen, just these four more, all four of them\nsurvived.",
        "So, that was a nice feeling. Raoul only had one meeting\nlike that. I don't know if you heard about it because everybody\nsaid he was just taken, but that's not true. After a week he",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Agnes Adachi 13\nOctober 14, 1995",
        "came back and the only one who saw him was the Swedish Red Cross\nhead, who was a lovely gentleman. Raoul said look behind me,\nthere are two Russian officers on the motor bike and I'm invited\nto go back to , but I don't know if I'm going as a\nvisitor but I want to give you all the money that I have so that\nyou can help the people that we already helped. I keep $1,000\nand I tell you that because when they were finally allowed to go\nin there five years ago when Gorbachev allowed the sister and the\nbrother to come, they found this $1,000 and they gave it back.\nThey never took it from him.",
        "But in any case he said to Langlett, but I have to tell you",
        "a wonderful story. AS we come in the car I see a little old lady\nstill wearing a star and she was carrying a basket with bread and\nI stopped the car and I went out and I said you speak some German\nand she said yes. Almost all Hungarians did. He said I just\nwant to tell you I'm so terribly happy to see you alive. My name\nis Raoul Wallenberg, and the old lady pulls out the passes and\nsays, I know Mr. Wallenberg and thank you. So, at least he had\none whom he knew that he did save. And Herr Unger had the same\nthing happening. He was already a consul in Vienna in 1956 and\nthe only ones who escaped then through the Danube were Jews and\nthe big Nazis who were not caught before. So, he decided he will\ndo the same as Raoul. He goes down with lights and food and dry",
        "clothes and he goes down to the river side and suddenly a boat",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Agnes Adachi 14\nOctober 14, 1995\ncomes in and a lady comes off and she runs to him. She said Mr.\nUnger you saved me from the Nazis, now you're saving me from the\nSoviets. So, he also had -- because we don't remember these\npeople, but the remember us because we were so few. It was a\nwonderful feeling, but it's also an embarrassing feeling. I don't\nknow why, it's a funny feeling, but it's wonderful and I wish\nRaoul would know every one of these people.\nQO. That he saved Jews?\nA. They don't even call us. Years we advertised in every\nnewspaper that any one who was saved or worked with him, please\ncall. Nobody does.\nQ. Why do you think that is?\nA. People don't like to remember. But still I think they\nshould, I mean after all this man saved 100,000 human lives. Not\njust Jews, because especially Budapest was very much\nintermarriages. He never asked that if you're the Christian I\nwon't save you, and those people wanted to stay together so he\nsaved everybody. 100,000 human lives, most of them of course\nwere Jewish. I remember when we had our very first benefit\nconcert. Did you ever hear the name of Andros Shiv? Well,\nAndros is our best friend. He's also there. My little Andros.\nI called up a friend of mine, he's now dead, who was the head of\nthe Hungarian Jewish Congress. Three quarters of those people,\ndoctors and lawyers were all saved by Raoul and I said we have",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Agnes Adachi 15\nOctober 14, 1995\nthis concert and the tickets are $18. That's not much and he\nSays what is there of Israel in it? I said Tibor, nothing, this\n1s to save Raoul. We need money to get him out somehow. Not one\nbought a ticket. We were very disappointed. The only two\nHungarians who came was my mother's two Christian friends' sons\nwith their two Jewish girlfriends. Would you believe that?",
        "If I would have said the tickets were $150 and they said no,\nbut $18 and all lawyers, doctors, pharmacists, all saved by\nRaoul. I never get a penny for my committee from them, never. I\ndon't know why people are like. Are people forgetting so fast,\nor they don't want to think of it, but it's better that he's\nstill 50 years in the and nobody ever thought to\nhelp him. It was a horrifying thing. This was a 32 year old\nyoung man who absolutely had no business to do what he did. But\nhe had a heart, and his idea was the young people, like you, like\nme -- I was only in my 20s then, that we will make peace in the\nworld. But we don't.",
        "Q. How old were you when you were working with him and how long\ndid you work?",
        "A. I think 24 I must have been. I was born in '18 and that was\n1944. So what is that?",
        "Q. Twenty-six. How long were you working with him at the\nembassy?",
        "A. Five months. The whole thing was only six months, but after",

        "Agnes Adachi 16\nOctober 14, 1995\nthe Danube, I got pneumonia and I really never saw him and then\nall the bridges were down and I only spoke on the telephone.\nQ. Did it seem much longer? Did the five months seem that it\nwent on for a long time?\nA. No, because it went so terribly fast. Don't forget that we\nwere constantly moving. Raoul never slept in the same place for\ntwo nights, and constantly moving and moving the office and\nmoving everything and then go back to the embassy. So, the time\nwent very fast because we didn't have time to count days or\nwhatever. I think it went very fast, but of course not fast\nenough because thousands and thousands of people died.",
        "So mainly I was a hostess and you know this was an enormous\nwork because we had thousands and thousands of people coming.\nOne of us had to put the picture on and then we had to run it to\nthe person who gave it to us to sign and then it's coming back to\nour ambassador and everything was running around. I was what\nthey call it here the gopher. Actually, that's what I was but\nthey needed a gopher, go here and go there and do this and do\nthat. That was my job. But it was wonderful to see how we could\nSave people. Like you probably read that last little portion\nthere when we were at the mountain and because the\nradio said that all women between the ages of 15 and 25 have to\ngo to such and such a sports palace and then clean up Hungary.\nWe knew exactly that they're going to Aushwitz so Raoul turned to",

        "Go and get the pictures. We sat on the Buddha side that night\nand of course Dan Olsen was there and he signed every one of them\nand we had to deliver it by I believe 3:00 in the morning, and it\nwas curfew. No one was allowed out on the street. It was a\ngorgeous night, very snowy and icy, but the moon was out and I\nthought why are they not bombing Budapest. This is a gorgeous\nnight to do it. Raoul arrived around midnight and he asked how\nfar are we because we have to go and he also said he wants to\ntell us something. We have new neighbors in the other house, the\nvilla, and we all looked up and he said don't look up, it's just\na German headquarters. He always made a joke out of it, and we\ndidn't care. I was the first who was ready with 500, but there I\nhave to tell you, I don't think I wrote that in the book. He\nwalked in when I was hitting one of the boys there. I hit him so\nhard. He opened a big mouth right then and said I sold quite a\nfew of these passes and I started to hit him on the head. I\ncould have killed him.\nQ. So, you were hitting him and Raoul --?\nA. I told him because he sold the passes, and he said you\ndidn't and he said yes I did. He said outrageous but he said\nAgnes don't hit him. I was so angry.",

I said never mind, an\nangel sent you these papers. I hope you will live. When I got\nhome it 4:00 or 3:00 and I sat down on the bed and Danny told me\nwhat I had done and I said to myself, oh my God, I could have\nbeen killed but then I felt like Raoul is hitting me and I said\noh, of course not, the Germans and the Hungarians are cowards,\nthey wouldn't dare to be out on the street.",
        "I fell asleep and at 6:00 in the morning my two best\ngirlfriends arrived. They were kicked out because of the paper.\nQO. Kicked out of where?",
        "A. From that sports palace because they had the pass.",

So, I called up immediately Raoul, but Raoul was on\nthe way to the railway station on the Austrian border, but he\nsaid I'm going to send you two diplomats immediately. So, we went\neight hours looking for papa and we couldn't find him.",
        "The next morning they picked me up at six in the morning and\nfinally we come to another sports palace, quite out of Budapest\nand I see my Swedish diplomat go in and say Hail Hitler, what\nelse can they do and say something and they turn around and run.",
        "They said Father is home, do you have a phone. I said yes we do\nhave a phone. I called home and papa was home. Now, he told us\nthe story, and that just shows you how the Hungarians were so\nmuch worse.",
        "Papa went down and one of these Nazis kids came up, the\nHungarian, and he says, \"Hey you bloody Jew, do you have any\npapers?\" And papa pulled out the passes and said that's nothing.",
        "There it was hanging on the wall. Took him into the police\nstation. A couple of minutes after, a German Nazi walked in and\nmy father spoke to him in German and he says, look the Hungarian\ntook me. He kicked him out. The other Hungarian brought him in.",
        "It happened four times. Finally the Hungarian won and walked my\nfather and another, many many hundred -- it was raining and cold\nand he still had the pajama on, for about six hours they walked",

In the morning, Papa was standing there with the\nbread and the young man beside him and suddenly again a German\nofficer walks in and my father saw them telling a joke to each\nother so he figured they are in good mood maybe I can hit them.\nSo, he went up again and said in German, \"Look what the Hungarian\ndid to me.\" He says, out, and the young boy besides him also\npulled out the pass and he was kicked out, and Papa quickly gave\nthe bread to the old gentleman who stayed there.",
        "So, how and why it saved some, not everyone, because what\nthe Hungarian Nazis, not the German Nazis, of course it was on\nEishman's order, they came in. We had the same houses. We had\nabout 30 houses on the two sides of the Danube, and that too,\nRaoul didn't buy them. It was given by the aristocrats and by\nthe Jews because they thought it was in better hands with the\nSwedes, then they would have taken it away. We put these people\nwith the passes into these houses. It was not comfortable, but\nthey had a Raoul who came out every day with medication, with --\nhe had to be there to see that his people are all right.",

        "They both spoke good German and they started to scream on that\nGerman. He said how dare you are taking these people. We have\nto take them to General so and so and this normal German soldier\nhad no idea who the generals are. They faked the name, you know,\nand they said and besides that you have a fake identity and they\ntook away their real identification paper from the Germans and\nthey told these people turn around and march and then the one\nyoung man came up to one old gentleman and said we are the\nWellenberg kids, we're taking you home. And they brought them\nall home.",
        "Raoul went down to the Danube and many times brought people\nback home from there. So, it was a pure luck the ones who\nSurvived and the ones who didn't. It wasn't a security, it was\njust a better feeling because we also had a hospital, and we had\nan orphanage. In that hospital too, the doctors always said we\ndon't know how Raoul do it, but when we say we need aspirins,\nthen the next day we have aspirins. If we need blankets, the\nblankets were there. They were never in want of anything. He\nwas amazing, and yet we didn't have any American or British Red\nCross. We only had the Swedish and help we got from the\nPortuguese.",

That was the second time she was saved. She had\nscarlet fever so Raoul had to give her some force papers and put\nher in a Christian hospital and that's why she survived. The\nother one was a little boy who was separated from his mother and\nthought she was dead, but the last words the mother said always\nhide if you can. When these boys came in and shot, he went under\na chair. Of course they didn't look under the chair and the poor\nlittle kid came out all dazed and walks out on the street and the\nfirst person he meets is his mother who was saved by Raoul in one\nof the safe houses.\nQ. Were you there after that massacre in that orphanage?\nA. No.\nQ. But you heard about it?\nA. Oh, we all heard about it. I met Raoul then and he went\ndown on his feet and he cried. I never saw him crying but for\nhim, to kill children, innocent children, and there was no\nreason, it was just fun.",
        "Like the hospital, that story I don't think that is in my\nbook.

        "He would never make a mistake in names. Nothing, he was a\nmagnificent person, what comes once in a life time. So, he\nlearned all the Hungarian officer's name and where they run their\noffices around Budapest. That was very important for him. And\nhe knew exactly who was where. So, anyhow he arrives a little\nbit after 12:00 noon, unshaven and evidently hungry too, and he\nsees all the doctors and me and the patients with their hands up\nand three little punks, 14, 13 and twelve with a gun. Of course\nwe had the Swedish flag hanging outside on every one of these\nhouses. Raoul, and I never saw that before him doing, he hit\nthese three kids, and they dropped their guns and he kicked them\nand he said half Hungarian, half German, \"Get out of here and\nbring me your officer. How dare you to come into a Swedish\nterritory.\" The kids got so frightened they went. Three minutes\nafter a Hungarian officer walks in and Raoul looks at his\nwatches, \"Simon, what took you three minutes to get here.\" The\nman looks and says, \"how do you know my name?\" And Raoul says, I\nknow everybody's name and I am very angry that you dare to send\nthe Swedish territory three little punks to frighten all the\npeople here and the sick people.

That was him. He said, well, how did you know his\nname? He said I only knew that office next door, that the head\nofficer was Simon and we were lucky it was Simon and he said all\nright I understand it, but I never had a German officer who died\nhere, and he says of course not, but he killed so many people one\nof them could have been a German officer. You see, that was his\nmind. He had to trick himself. He could have been in trouble\nbut that was the only way to save people. So, he saved the whole\nhospital.\nQO. You were there when those German --?\nA. That happened, yes, I was there.\nQ. You must have been terribly frightened?\nA. We never even knew anymore what is to be frightened, because\nthere were only two choices, either you get killed or you live.\nI don't even think we were frightened.

He\nwould pick up the children who were crying and start making\nanimal noises and tell them stories to get them out of\nfrightening. That kind of a person we don't find today.",

Yes, they were constantly worried but also they understood\nby that time that if you don't do that then all of us will be\ndead, my parents included. I remember when I finally got all\nthese papers and my working papers from Raoul and they handed me\nthese passes for the parents and also Raoul they gave me a paper\nthere was a house commission.

I don't know what he had\ndone to her after that, so he said yes, but I have nothing to do\nwith it. You will have to go to the house's lawyers.",
        "So, again I picked myself up and I walked to this lawyer and\nI told him I want this back. He said well I will give it back to\nyou under one condition and I stood like the Americans with my\nhands back, like I think Raoul did all the time, I said what is\nyour condition.

He sent the kid\nto school, I mean it was us who did everything. That's why the\nwife was so happy, but he was an s.o.b. and he came up with me to\nthe apartment. The apartment was empty and I thought to myself\noh my God, they have stolen everything, but we had the maids room\nand we opened the maids room and everything was in there, even\nthe paintings. So, at the moment, I thought well maybe he isn't\nthat bad until I heard him saying, \"I get even with you yet.\"\nBut he had no choice. He gave me the apartment.

He came out and he said to my mother,\nwhat happened and mommy said well, now I found out she was\nJumping in the Danube and she probably has pneumonia.

So, that the old\nfolks can have a little sleep in the afternoon, we went down to\nthe basement where we used to be before when they were bombing.",

From then on it was for the Jews even worse.\nQ. At one point you ended up leaving for Romania?\nA. Yes, I wanted to leave anyway.

I picked up\nthe child and they were shooting on the street. So,she was\nfrightening and I was telling her stories and you had to get your\nhead down because they were shooting. Somehow we managed we went\nto the nuns and I gave the little girl to the nuns. The next day\nthe parents went and got her back.

I said look\nit's made for you. They have the grand piano there, and I ring\nthe bell and my friend opened it and she screamed. I mean it's\nnot funny that I am alive and they brought out every food they\nhad in the house and I shouldn't have eaten, we all swell up\nafter because we had nothing to eat.

She and that Swedish lady\nwho was the former Swedish consul's wife then everybody left by\nairplane except the three of us and that was the German woman,\none Hungarian who was married to a Swedish girl and myself. We\nwere the only ones who stayed.",
        "QO. You wanted to stay?",
        "A. No, but that's how they managed. These people were very\nimportant. The two girls, the parents were waiting. The other\none was with the Scotland Yard. The other one was a girlfriend\nof -- so they had to go. All right, that doesn't matter because\nI was not in danger and in Switzerland I have this enormously big\nfamily.",
        "So, it was very exciting to see my family because I have a\nvery famous aunt and uncle. She was a concert pianist and my\nuncle was a conductor and so forth. So, they picked me up and\nall my cousins and it was a great thing that I am alive.",
        "QO. Where was this?\nA. In Zurich. We went on an overnight train to Zurich from",

My uncle turned to my aunt and he said, the war must have\ndone something to her mind. She's lying and every time the phone\nrang then he said, that's maybe the Swedish ambassador. It was a\nvery bad four weeks and when the phone rang and it was the\nNorwegian ambassador they couldn't believe that I was told that\nthe three of us will leave a Norwegian Red Cross bus to Denmark\nand then from there we go to Sweden.\nQ. So you tried to explain to them --?\nA. Oh, I told them what Wallenberg did but they weren't\ninterested. Not at all, such a man doesn't exist. It's alla\nlie.\nQ. Why do you think they weren't interested?\nA. Not interested because that's how the Swiss were. I have a\ncousin whose parents were killed in the Danube. He was the only\none that survived somehow, but then he was taken to either\nBergen-Belsun or Auschwitz. I don't know which one was liberated\nby the Russians and then the Russians wanted to take him to\nSiberia and he figured he has an uncle and an aunt in Switzerland\nhe's going to jump train, and he did. What they did to him and\nthey could see the number, the Swiss had hit him so badly he\nstill has cuts on his head for three days. It was incredible.",

        "called my uncle and then my uncle brought him home.\nQ. Why were the Swiss attacking him?\nA. Because that's how they were. They had too good a life all\ntheir life. They did that to us too. When we were about to\nleave the Swiss had everything. They had enough food but even\nhome I wanted a little more butter. My uncle said that's on\ncoupons, you can't have more butter. I hadn't seen butter for\nthe past six years. In Rumania they had not much butter at that\ntime either. But in any case we were standing ina long line\ntogether on the bus and had to go through customs and I was the\nlast one, thank God, and I see the custom officers knew that we\nhad to go through the town up Germany, through Nuremberg and all.",
        "There was no food, no nothing. They took all the food away from\neveryone. They took all the money away from every one. So,\nwhile there was such a long line I went into the bathroom, I took\nthe money and put it in my shoe. I figured at least I have a few\npennies. Could you imagine that the Swiss took everything away\nand they knew that we're going through a country where there's no\nfood for three days.\nQ. Had your family in Switzerland heard anything about the\ncamps, about the deportations?\nA. Oh, they probably had but they didn't believe.\nQO. None of it?\nA.

Lutz was home ina week. We called the Swedish prime\nminister, we had at that time a Swedish spy for Russia",
        ". He was the biggest spy and he was in a Swedish\njail and we suggested to give him back to the Russians for Raoul\nand they said it's not worth it to get into war with the Russians\nfor one man and international law wouldn't allow us. So, Raoul\nstayed. Lutz was home in a week.",
        "Now, about ten years ago, finally they made a committee for\nLutz and the committee mentioned that he helped Raoul and so\nforth. His wife just died and then they started to believe that\nthese things really happened. But in the mean time my family, my\nuncle and aunt died and now they're helping me. I'm waiting for\nthat letter maybe it will come eventually that a little boy, who\nwas my cousin teaching, he wrote a wonderful thing about Raoul\nand they want to send me. So, we will see.",
        "It was amazing. It was hurting me terribly because I needed\nall the being with us, and the other thing in Geneva -- I went\noff to Geneva for a couple of days because we had very, very dear\nfriends there.

Fur coats and money and then because in Hungary when you\nleft you always had to go to the bank and if you're going for two\nweeks then so much money you can take. So we'd go over there and\nin three days we'd come home that we spend all the money.",
        "So now I am in Zurich and I call up Aunt Nelli, this is\nAggi. You're alive, you're alive. I said I am. Wonderful. I\nsaid Poppy said I should ask you to please give me some money\nbecause I'm going to get married in Sweden and I need money.\nQuiet in the phone and he comes to the phone and he said your\nfather wrote us during the war and we have given back all the\nmoney. I said Uncle Otto, we couldn't correspond during the war,\nhow could Poppy ask you for the money.",
        "So, suddenly I said I'm coming to Geneva and so he says when\nand I said I don't know but I'll come. I thought if I tell them\n-- so the first trip I did in Geneva was a darling friend of ours\nwho was a Swiss whose wife now lived with him too. He left him\nand now lived with him too. He had a big clothes factory and I\nwalked into Andre and Andre started to cry. In French, too,",

They played poker. Now, you see these\nare Jewish people. Every penny we had. Everything we had. I\nasked for the fur coat, they looked at each other, oh the fur\nstore burned down. Those girls whom I saved I told you their\nmother was our best friend and she was very rich and she left her\nmoney in Germany with a Christian lawyer and she left. About she\nwas here two years already in '51l or '53 when finally she gets a\nnote from the lawyer that finally I found you. I tripled your\nmoney, come and get it. So, you see, it's not because one is a\nJew and one is a Christian. There are bad people. Here are our\nbest friends and they steal everything because they're going to\ndie anyhow. They're the ones who sent me home. They said go\nhome, nothing is going to happen.",
        "Funny, heartbreaking and I remember I went then to Sweden,\nit was already October and I was called and it\nmeans you are very capable and I wrote her a letter and I said\ncould you please send me some money I need a winter coat and the\nanswer was you are so capable you will get it yourself. So, this\nis life. I guess my uncle and aunt sort of behaved the same way.",
        "It wasn't interesting, it's not true. Now it's too late. Now\nthey believe in it, but so what. It was a heart break. It was a\nheart break because I couldn't believe it that they don't believe",

So, I was happy when I left Switzerland, but then it\ntook us three days through Germany and we saw the Germans come\nlike this and the Americans are -- they just walk because they\nwere prisoners. The Germans were prisoners. But the funny part\nwas that you read in my book too that the bus drivers for this\nNorwegian Red Cross were all German war prisoners and they still\nhad the swastika besides it. None of the Norwegians would open\ntheir mouth in German. So, they asked everybody who speaks\nGerman and I stupidly said I do and I sat with these German war\nprisoners, the Jewish kid, and everything was written in English.",
        "Be careful, no road, be careful no bridge and I had to translate\nand I thought to myself if you would know that it's a Jewish girl\nwho tells you what to do. But we made it to Denmark and the\nDanes were absolutely incredible. What they did they built us a\ncamp there, there must have been a thousand showers with the hot\nwater running like crazy and they made us food and they told --\nthe Norwegians they didn't eat much in the years before, don't\ngive us so much food we'll get sick. But you could not eat when\nyou look at the lox and the cheeses and I mean they were\nincredible. The Danes were absolutely fantastic. Then the next\nday they showed us a little bit and then we were put ont he same\nboat where they get the Jews from Denmark to Sweden and when we\ngot to Sweden these two people were still with me, this one man",

I said I cannot go\ninto Sweden, why no? No, we got the report that you can't get\ninto Sweden. I said to myself, oh my God, what kind of a stupid\nthing is that and the two people said well if she can't go then\nwe don't leave either. We stay here with her.",
        "So, in any case that too turned what happened. People do\nthings and they still do it. In Geneva one of my friends got\nmarried and this guy has written to the Swedish newspapers. He\nwas a newspaper man and he interviewed me. I was the first one,\nand he was fascinated by the story and I didn't know that these\npeople twisting the words and write what they feel like.

What\nI found out where the whole mistake come from is that this idiot\ninstead of saying I'm going to Sweden and get married, he said in\ngovernment business I'm going first to Oslo. So, they though,\noh, she's a communist. She's coming here from the communist\ngovernment. Can you believe that? We never even talked about\nOslo, nothing, but that was in his mind, why not. That was very\nhard because even when I got to Stockholm that was funny because\nfirst they asked me if I want to go to my fiance first or where\nand I said I want to go to his mother's first and his mother was\na darling and we couldn't speak each other language but we fell\nin love with each other.

We were\nlonely. So, the next day when I called up the Swedish embassy\nthey were all happy and they made me mad. The first question was\nwhy did you go to Oslo? Then I found out what was in the\nnewspaper. I said I never said that and then I cried very\nbitterly. Finally here I am arriving and everything is a\nmisunderstanding. And I said, do me one favor, could you please\nfind out about my fiance. I know I have to marry him and I will,\nbut if he is a communist I am not going to get married.",

So it wasn't just to protect you while you were in Budapest?\nA. No, I thought that a decent thing to do if a man goes in all\nthis trouble to do that, but I found out and they found out that\nhe's a communist. Thank God that let me off.

You should have seen the\nhotels in the country what they made over for rooms for these\npeople. They dressed them four times a season and they were\nallowed to get well there.
