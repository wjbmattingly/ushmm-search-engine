        "Answer: My name is Paul Halpern. I was born in Vienna, Austria November 29, 1932.",
        "Q: Well, first of all, thank you for giving us this interview.",
        "A: My pleasure.",
        "Q: I would like to thank you. Let's recall your childhood and your childhood years in\nVienna before the war. Where did you live at that time and what was your family like?",
        "A: I was the second child and the first son of a manufacturer of rain coats. Quite wealthy.\nWe lived at 2 Elizabeth StraBe, which is one block off the wing in the first district. And\nmy mother's -- my mother's father was a -- was a large manufacturer who had clothing\nfactories all over Europe, and the name of his factory was Airkaklidafabrake (ph), and my\nfather was -- worked for him. He was an office I mean, he worked his way up to be a\nmanager, and my grandfather finally said, Have I got a girl for you. And he married my\nmother who was a deb. She was high in Jewish society. And my dad was 14 years old\nthan she was, and they went away on the honeymoon. When they came back, my dad, he\nopened his own factory with the help of his father-in-law. We -- we had a very, very nice\nlife. It was a lot of money. We would summer in Switzerland, and we would -- we had ananny and we would walk out of the house and go to -- go one block and feed the horses\nin front of the opera house, and it was good -- really very, very nice and then --",
        "Q: How many siblings did you have?",
        "A: Thad one sister.",
        "Q: Oh. So just two of you?",
        "A: She was four years old -- three and a half years older than I was.",
        "Q: Two children in the family?",
        "A: Two -- two children in the family. My mother had two brothers, neither one had\nchildren --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- at that time, and my father was born in Limbeck (ph), Poland, and he came\nto -- came to Austria and he went to business school, and then he got this job -- I mean,\nhe -- he served in a -- he was -- he was a prisoner of the Russians during World War I,\nand then he came out, decided to work for my grandfather, and eventually hard work\npays off. And he married my mother and it was -- it was a good life.",
        "Q: And your mom was a housekeeper?",
        "A: No. My mom was a debutante. My mother had season tickets at the opera. My\nmother was a dilettante. She -- she -- she went to the Cordon Bleu cooking school,\ncouldn't cook a lick. We -- she -- she enjoyed her life. She was a young -- she was a\nyoung woman who enjoyed her life, and made it all the more difficult later on in her life,\nbut -- and I didn't -- I was a spoiled kid and so was my sister. And we lived in an\napartment, if I remember correctly, it was 11 rooms. And our dining room was bigenough that we used to do -- my sister and I would race our tricycles and bicycles in the\ndining room. There was enough room to make turns. It was that big. So you -- you\nknow, those -- the big trouble when you're five and six years old, you don't\nremember -- you remember pieces. And riding my bicycle is more important than where\nI went to school, what I had to eat, you know, and those are things I remember.",
        "Q: Sure. Can you describe your family as being religious?",
        "A: No. Absolutely not. What's interesting -- my father was the son of Ichivibulha (ph).\nYou know, he lived in Poland and he was like tevea (ph) without the milk route. He\nwas -- he was the village hebruscala (ph) basically, but, you know, you can't live on the\nchicken somebody brings you for advice. So his wife kept what would be now called the\n7-Eleven, you know. She had the local store, and people would come there, and he\nwould sit there and give out advice. I never knew either one because I'm named after my\ngrandfather and -- but they were smart enough that he was the oldest of six kids, and she\nsaid, Go to Austria. Get a business degree. Make enough money. Bring your brother\nout. When you bring your brother out, he goes to business school, gets a business degree.\nBring your other brother out and then your sister, and they all got out. They all went out\nand they kept ties with the -- my grandfather and my -- my grandmother died of natural\ncauses. I mean, that was way before -- before the Nazis, but nobody was religion. But\nmy dad could only pray orthodox. I mean, we would -- when -- this was when I was\nconservative leaning toward reformed, but in -- we would go to the synagogue. They had\nall three congregations, the Jewish and the Jaxonites (ph), and he would go downstairs to\nthe little hole in the wall orthodox, and he would daven only in the -- and passover with\nhim was a disaster because he would go through the entire Haggadah in Hebrew\nonly -- never pausing for one word, and my mother would be say, Joe, the dinner's getting\ncold, but we weren't religion. No.",
        "Q: And what was the name of your sister and your mother?",
        "A: My sister's name was Lucie, L-u-c-i-e, and my mother's name was Ditta, D-1-t-t-a,\nwhich is diminutive for Edith. Little Edith. But her name on her birth certificate was\nDitta, and my grandfather and his -- they came out of -- they came out of Czechoslovakia,\nand they were a super family. They -- my grandfather -- I have pictures of him flying to\nvisit his factories in 1929, pictures standing in front of an airplane, airline flying to\nplaces, and they -- my grandmother's family -- they -- Peter Bogdanovich, the movie\ndirector, 1s part of my mother's -- my grandmother's family on my mother's side\nand -- and her sister was the first pharmacist in Czechoslovakia, you know, so they\nwere -- they were an achieving upper-class family. And they're very, very -- I love\nmy -- my grandparents. They were classy people.",
        "Q: Sure. Did you or your sister go to school before the war?",
        "A: My -- well, I was small but my sister went to school.",
        "Q: Was it a Jewish school?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It was just a regular --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- older nation school?\nA: Politely put, even then we were in a simulated family. There was, you\nknow -- the -- my -- my dad had Jewish friends and so on, but it -- the Jewish Society was\nJewish Society, but I was never aware that I was a Jew. You know, we -- during the\nholidays and Passover, Yom Kippur, yeah, we did celebrate that, but usually at my\ngrandparent's house.",
        "Q: I see. Were you or your parents aware of Nazi --",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: -- rise and what -- what was their first --",
        "A: Once again -- once again, I'm thinking as a five-year-old, but I remember when\nDollfuss was assassinated. Dollfuss was a socialist minister who was against the\nAnschluss. And one day he was shot at a -- shot at a valley and the ambulance came\nthrough and said, We'll take him. And they loaded him in the ambulance. They found\nhim in the ambulance two days later dead when it was sun up. And it was politically very\ndifficult time. My father, I know for a fact about six or seven months before the\nAnschluss, one of his employees came in and he said, Mr. Halpern, I am a member of the\nAustrian Nazi Parties, National Socialist Party, and eventually, you know, it's just a\nmatter of time before we come here and we need friends. No Jewish questioned at all but\nwe need friends and we need -- and so it's how about a contribution now, and my father\nhad him thrown out, fired him and threw him out.",
        "Q: Did he mean, like, money?",
        "A: Well, yes. Donation to the party to show good-will toward the party and when right\nafter the Anschluss, my dad came to work one day and he was sitting in his office and hesaid, You work for me now. And for a while my dad -- my dad did -- my dad did\ngo -- one of the good -- and then you know we -- we had a nanny, and we -- we used to\ngo to the park and then we couldn't go into the park so -- the nanny was Catholic and we\nwould walk around the park, and then we had to wear arm bands.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: And my nanny -- I was upset that my nanny didn't wear one because, oh, you know,\nI'm sorry. You can't have one of these arm bands, you know. If you were Jewish you\ncould wear one of these things, you know, and that summer we still went to camp in the\nAlps. We still went to camp in the Alps. I remember it was a vegetarian camp. It was\nawful. And I came down with appendicitis. Could not find a doctor in the -- in the area\nto treat me. So with a case of appendicitis, I went on the train back to Vienna, and they\nwouldn't take me. The hospital -- I know that from my mother. And then my appendix\nwas taken out by a Jewish doctor in his office. You know, and he had kind of an\noperating room, and that was the first time I suddenly realized that something was a little\nbit wrong. And my sister had to change schools, you know. She couldn't go to the\nschool, and -- but we lived in a building where -- mostly Christians. I -- I can't tell you,\nbut I know -- I know that. And in the fall of '38, our nanny was not allowed to work for\nus anymore. So now my debutante mother had to take us for walks and stuff. And my\nsister was at school, and my mother said to me, Let's go for a walk. And she looked at\nme. She said, Your shoe lace is untied. So she literally stood me up on the dining room\ntable. Okay. She was 4'11. She stood me up on the dining room table so she could tie\nmy shoes. And I'm standing there, she's tying my shoe, and the doorbell rings. And twogentlemen come in, and it was right out of a -- right out of a German movie. These two\nguys came in, and they had rain coats and snap-brim hats and the whole bit. And they\nsaid is -- is your husband here? And my mother said, No. He's -- and my mother was\none of these very nervous people. And she said, No. He's not here. They said, We need\nto look around. And my mother said, Okay. And so they walked in -- and I'm five years\nold and I'm toddling behind them. I'm -- and they went into my father's study which\nwas I remember it because it had green shades you know, in the old days instead of white\nshades there was a green shade. So the sunlight was always filtered and I remember\ndistinctly one of them walking to my father's desk, reaching into his coat, taking out his\ngun, and laying it on the floor under my father's desk. And then the other one went over\nand said, Oh, what's this? And he picked the gun up and he turned to my -- went to my\nmother and said, Is this yours? And my mother said, No. And he said, Well, you're\ngoing to have to come with us. And she said, Well, why? He said, Well, do you have\nsomebody who can take care of him? And so my mother went up and got one of\nthe -- one of the neighbors to take care of me 'till my grandmother could come and collect\nus. And that the last time I saw my mother and father 'till spring of 1941. And they went\nto the downtown Vienna prison, and I understand for the two years they were in the\ndowntown Vienna prison they saw each other one time in the exercise yard and never\ntalked. But you have to understand here is a woman who has had the best of everything\nand she's living in a wing with 200 women, one shower, no doors; one toilet, no doors.\nBut through this entire time, my former nanny used to come and collect her laundry and\ndo her laundry for her, you know, what little rags she had. And she -- it was just kind ofdifferent, you know. So we -- we went to -- we went to my grandmother's house and\nthat's -- if you're going to record this, this is -- my grandfather, right after the Auschwitz\nand the troops were in the street, went on a normal business trip to Switzerland. And\nabout three days later, my mother got -- my grandmother got a letter. And the letter said,\nBy the time you get this letter. I'm on my way to the United States. I am not coming\nback. They don't want you. They want me. So sometime in the next week they will\ncome and say to you, Where's your husband? And you show them this letter, and they're\ngoing to say, When is he coming back? And you're going to say, He's not coming back.\nJust show them the letter, and eventually they'll let you go because they don't want you.\nSign over anything they want, give them anything you want -- they want, and they'll let\nyou go -- because this is still early on. And that's exactly how it happened. And so,\nfinally, after about by the spring of '39, my grandmother's arranging for us to go into\nKindertransport, and they said, Just sign here. Give us the bill and then sign over and get\nout. And she said, Not until I put my kids -- my grandkids on the train. And they said,\nNo, you have to get out. She said, No. I'm not getting out until they get on the train.\nThat's how tough she was. And she was the only member of my family who was over\n5'6, you know. So she was the queen. She put us on the train, and she went to the United\nStates; and she joined her husband who was -- he had guts. I mean, he played -- he\nplayed with people's lives, but he -- he knew human nature. He knew that as long as they\ngot what they wanted they were going to -- and I went to England, and I remember\nthe -- I remember the train ride. And, you know, a little them -- them memories and I had\nmy father's brother was in London, and he had come to England with his wife, Auga (ph),as a domestic. They signed on as a couple, and Auga (ph) came over pregnant. So their\nson, Ralph, was born in England and was a British subject, and did very well. He is a\nLord of the British Emperor. His name is Sir Ralph Halpern, and he was chairman of the\nboard of Burton Industries, and he now lives in South Beach, and my -- my son and he\nare good friends. And I see them occasionally, and he was always a -- always a Brit and\nhe's always been a Brit. Calls me Dear Boy and he's six years younger than Iam. And\nit's kind of racy, and I -- he and I have a good time together. And -- and but there was\nnowhere we could stay in England -- we could stay with him in London. We'd stay a\ncouple of days, and then went down to Bunce Court and Dan (ph) Court\nto -- Kindertransport. They made an arrangement for the kids who did not have -- weren't\ngoing to be taken there by families. There was -- there were these estates out by Kent,\nand they brought in an educator from Berlin named Anna Essinger and who was the most\nmagnificent teacher. I was there 16 months, and I stayed in one school, and my sister\nstayed in the other school. And I can't tell you whether I was in Bunce Court or Dan\nCourt. I think I was in Bunce Court because it comes easier to my mind, but, you know,\nthe memories are strange. All I know is that I did a lot of schooling because I jumped\nlike three years when I came here immediately because they thought I was a poor refugee\nkid until I -- I told them -- they put me in the second grade. I could read. I could do\nmath. I -- I had a little bit of chemistry. I knew European History because that's what\nthat's what the regimen there was, and the -- they -- the -- the -- the bombings were pretty\nbad around that area because a lot of fighter bases were in that area, and we got sent to\nLondon and -- which is interesting because then the Brits started in London for sure. And\nthe Brits -- Britains decided to have their own Kindertransport and, they went and signed\nup 30,000 children to get them first to the countryside and then to the colonies Australia,\nSouth Africa, New Zealand, Halifax. And it was a little bit different. And from what I'd\nbeen read -- what I read -- it was part of the government in power at that time, and he said\nthis is a mistake because they have to go by boat. And the -- the Germans controlled the\nseas. And if we lose one boat, when the war is over, we will lose the election because\nthat will be an issue. And we were supposed to go in December of -- September 10th or\n12th we were -- 1940, we were supposed to go from London to Liverpool to catch a boat,\nand I remember we sat in the station -- in Victoria Station because the air raids were very\nbad at that time, and we missed the boat. And it was the City of Benares, and the City of\nBenares was a troop ship converted from a Cunard-White Star Line. The City of Benares\nwas sunk a three days later in the -- on its way -- way, and I think 89 children didn't die in\nthe sinking but died of exposure to water. It was a horrific thing. And Churchill\nimmediately cancelled that -- and about 3500 -- there were books on that -- there were\nmore books on that Kindertransport than our Kindertransport because it was a different\nissue. And we stayed in Liverpool, and four days later we -- we got on the SS Antonia\nwhich was a converted Cunard-White Star Line, and all I remember is we were the only\ntwo kids on the boat and we saw in the crew quarters and my -- and for luck they would\nplay cards with us sitting on their lap. And we were supposed to go to New York, and\nthere was a -- there was a U-boat scare. So we went to Montreal, and we arrived in\nSeptember 30th, 1940. And I got to see my first comics, and I can still remember\nthe -- you know, Americans comics was something usual. And I -- I can tell you thestory. It was a Dick Tracy story, and I can do that when I get a smart -- I always -- I've\nalways been trying to get the copy of that -- that particular page from September 30th so I\ncould show -- and my grandfather -- my grandfather had us picked up in Montreal. We\ngot put on the train, and the first day we were in -- in New York City, we went and\napplied for first citizen -- first papers because as far as everyone knew, my parents were\ndead. So my grandfather was my guardian. And we applied for first papers for -- for\ndeclaration, not to -- to get out of refugee status. And I lived in Forest Hills with\nmy -- with my grandmother, and my sister went to my grandfather's brother who lived in\nKingston. He was also quite wealthy. And it was a good life. And I -- and I went to\nschool in Forest Hills and I went to PS3, and they -- a week after my teacher called my\ngrandmother and said, He's seven and a half years old and he doesn't belong in the second\ngrade. We're going to put him in the third grade. So I finished that year, and they said,\nWe need to put him in the fifth grade next year. And my -- and my grandmother said,\nNo. He's -- he's a smart kid, but he needs -- he needs a little bit of respect. He needs to\nbe leveled off a little bit. He needs to be with his age. You can put him in the fourth, but\nyou can't put him -- you can't put him in the fifth. So I was always early because of that.\nBut my grandmother was very -- very clever about that she said, you know, He needs\npeer pressure, and he's not going to get it if he's a smart-alecky kid three years over his\nhead. And -- and then in his early 1941 my grandfather who was in the -- he owned real\nestate, office buildings and apartment houses. They invested with -- with friends. He\nwas in RNS associates and he was visited by a member of the German litigation who said\nto him, Would you like to buy a couple of Jews? And I think my grandfather always kindof said that that's basically what he said. Would you like to buy somebody? And my\ngrandfather said, Who? And they said, Your daughter and her husband. And my\ngrandfather said, I sat shiver (ph) for them two years ago because my grandfather\ndid -- was observant a little then. And they said No, they're alive. They're alive. And so\nan arrangement was made. And from what I understand, and I can't prove it, but I know\nthat the fact that they had warehoused them for two years -- in the back of their mind, it\nwas a product. My -- my -- it was a product to be -- it was currency that could be\nconverted at any time. And an accommodation was made, and my grandfather -- the\ndoors opened in prison, and they told my mother and dad, 48 hours. 48 hours or -- and\nthen right after that, the -- the rest of the people went to -- within six months, they were\nall gone to concentration camps. They closed it up. And they went -- they did the route\nto Portugal, and they were supposed to go to Argentina and -- and wait it out. And the\naverage wait was, like, a year-and-a-half, two years. And my grandfather had very\nintelligent advisers, and one of them said to him, You know you're sponsoring your kids,\nbut they're grown people. Your grandchildren have status as first-paper Americans and\nthey're refugees. Have them sponsor their parents, my mother and dad. Because it's a\n[compassionate] and no argument at all. Immediately after we filed papers, immediately\nmy mother and dad came from Portugal to the United States. And it was -- there's an\ninteresting bypass to this -- this part of it. If 1 may, my dad worked his way, you\nknow -- he did what he could, and he got some Austrian woman and my mother they\ncrocheted the shopping bags. You know, in Europe, they used the net shopping bags\nwhich nobody in America did so the -- the Austrian ladies would sit there and embroidercolor hand -- onto this netting to make handbags. And my dad took them to\nBloomingdale's and started to sell them -- you know, he was much of an entrepreneur,\nand he handled slippers, you know, that -- there were cottage made and he sold those, and\nthen he got into the import/export business. And in 1947, the American government\ncalled my dad in and they said -- you know, he had become a citizen -- and they said,\nYou know your factories are gone. Your factory was bombed because it was making\nrainwear but your father-in-law who had died, his factory is there in Gupendolfush\ndausen (ph), but the equipment all went east to Russia, but it's there. Would you consider\ncoming back? We can offer you projection as an American citizen, not a lot of protection\nbecause it was behind the iron curtain but -- and we can't tell you that you can get any\nmoney on it right now, but it would help Austria come back on its feet and you have\nconnections. And so my dad -- my -- my -- the family said, you know, everybody you\nknew it like the -- their father's right-hand man, he went back starting in '47, went back\nand rebuilt Airkaklidafabrake (ph). And about '49 my mother started going back. My\nfather was not a happy man there. I mean, you know, but my mother, bygones, bygones.\nIt never occurred to her that all of her friends never lost a thing. Still had the houses in\nthe country. Still -- and she would -- it never -- the only way you could be that way 1s if\nyou were one of them. You know, and they were all Christians. And she -- she was\nfriends with them 'till she died. And she was -- she was a little bit different. And I\nremember my deb -- they -- they lived in a ponceon (ph) right on Amgraddam (ph). Do\nyou know Vienna? Amgraddam (ph) is the shopping district like Rodeo drive. And I\nhave -- I was -- I was there just recently, last November, and I took pictures withmy -- with my grandson. And she -- they lived in a ponceon (ph) the whole time and\nshe -- she just kept -- kept going. She just enjoyed life again. And when they were let\nout of prison, the first place they went to was back 2 Elizabeth Street, and they knocked\non the door. And the man opened the door, and my mother said she could see all her\nfurniture. And the man said, What do you want? And she said, Well, We used to live\nhere. And he said, You don't live here anymore, and he slammed the door. In about\n1962, '63, my mother and my dad are eating in a very fine restaurant in Vienna, and my\ndad said -- and you have to remember, my dad was about 5'3, 5'4. He said to my mother,\nExcuse me, and he left the table, and he walked to the table across the room where a\ngentlemen was eating with a woman. And he said, You remember me? And the guy\nsaid, No. And he said, No. You should remember me. You lived in my apartment. 2\nElizabeth StraBe 1941, and I came to the door and you slammed the door. And he\nbrought his voice up a notch, and the guy said, I don't remember. And my\ngrandfather -- my father, very quietly, said, Oh, you must remember me, and repeated the\nstory at a higher voice. And when he got to where he was talking very loudly, the man\ncalled for his check and he left. And my dad went back to table, put his napkin in his lap,\nsaid, Let's eat. And that -- that's a marvelous story because my dad -- my dad was a very\nquiet man. Greatest American that live lived, most patriotic American that ever lived.\nLoved this country. And the only protection they had was he lived in the -- he lived -- the\nfactory was in the 5th district. He lived in the second district. He lived in the first\ndistrict -- first or second then he moved to the first district when my mother move -- came\nin. And, you know, because of the McCarran-Walter Act, he could not be out of thiscountry six months and a day, you know, naturalized citizens had to, you know -- had to\nbe here for at least -- then he had to stay here six months, and it was just an\ninconvenience to him. I mean, he -- he said, I'm not going nowhere. I'm an American\ncitizen, and I'm -- you know, I'm doing this. And he did very well in the factories, and he\nactually was able -- I was -- I was in Germany working in -- I was -- I was in the Air\nForce, and I was the German-American Press Officer for the Air Forces of Europe. And\nwhen I got that assignment, I called my dad in Vienna, and I said, Listen. I can get out of\nthis job. All I've got to do is tell them who -- that you spent time in a German prison.\nAnd my dad said, 20 years is too long to hate. I'll meet you in Frankfort. And\nDietzenbach (ph) is right outside Frankfort, and they would come and they would spend\nsome time. My mother loved that we lived up in the mountains in a -- at a cor or (ph),\nyou know, and they would go in the afternoon, listen to music. My dad was never happy\nin Germany, but he -- he -- he believed in his principle. His principle was, It's 20 years.\nYou got to do what you got to do. And he was very proud of the fact that I was -- that I\ncould do that. And I do have to tell you one -- and I -- I'm digressing, but you know,\nI -- I've done this before. I tell stories. I was the information officer Dietzenbach (ph) air\nbase. And among the things that we had was the Glendola (ph) band of Europe, the Air\nForce band, which is equivalent to the -- the air force band that's in Washington, D.C.,\nand the -- was the same band that Miller conducted when he was lost. And they played\nfrom Glen Miller (ph) music, they played from Glen Aus (ph). And I would -- because I\nspoke German, and I would take them on -- I would be -- I would be their press office,\nand I would do Voice of America Interviews, and we went on a Red Cross tour ofAustria, and we ended up in Vienna playing at the concert hall with 2,000 seats. And the\nconcery (ph) had some problems because it was during the Vietnam War. And when we\ncame on the stage, there were two empty rows which is really frightening. You know, I\nmean, it's -- it implied threat, and it was a 49-piece brass concert band, really\nunbelievably good music. And they -- I -- I did the announcing. I did the announcing for\nthis one. And after about three numbers in the audience, they had just played the Braums\nAcademic Festival Overture (ph), and people said, That's -- that's not a oompa (ph) band,\nand I came on and my German was pretty good, but I had a script. And I said, You're\ngoing to have to excuse me because I need this paper. I said, From my accent you\nprobably can't tell that I was born in this country, and I got a lot of applause. I said, As a\nmatter of fact, I was born in this city, and I got a lot of applause. And I said, As a matter\nof fact, my mother and my father are sitting right there; my mother and my father with\nfour friends are sitting there. And my mother's down like this. And I said -- I said, now,\nI'm not a musician, but I think what you will agree that these gentlemen are -- and\neverybody, yes, because they were magnificent. And I said, therefore, for my mother in\nthe city of my birth, My Fair Lady, and they played. And my mother is crying away, you\nknow. And -- but to give you an idea of what kind of a debutante my mother was -- now\nwe're talking about '68 so my mother's 63 years old, and she comes back stage with my\ndad. And I introduce them to my conductor, and she said, Would you have -- we're\nhaving a little coffee at the Intercontinental Hotel, which is one block from the course\n(ph). We would love it 1f you and the conductor, Miche Delfonso (ph), and the first chair\nwould join us for coffee. I'm her son. I -- we've been touring Austria, walking around allday. And she never mentioned it until she was there. So I did a Voice of America\ninterview, and we walked down the street. And, you know, they're great musicians, but\nVienna appreciates good music. And the restaurant was filled with people who had been\nat this concert. And we did Glen Miller (ph) the whole after the -- and as we walked in,\nwhen the conductor walked in, everybody stood up and applauded. And you know what\na good feeling that is for a professional musician who's a military man to be applauded.\nNot because he was a Air Force officer, but because he was the conductor of a really\ngood orchestra. And we had this wonderful dinner. And -- and I mean, wonderful coffee\nand shla (ph) coffee ve shla (ph). And then my -- my dad, in '68, I was getting ready to\ncome back to the United States in -- in '69, I was coming back, early '69. He said, I'm\ntired. He's 76. It's '68. He came back and he said, It's my last trip. We -- we\nsold -- we've sold it to the European part of family. We've gotten our money out. I'm\ngoing to retire. And he was dead in two months. Couldn't -- came home, had a stroke.\nAnd I think if he had worked, he would have kept on working because that was his -- and\nmy mother -- my mother lived another -- 76 -- 60 was when he died, she was 62. And\nshe died at 94. She lived another 32 years and went back to Vienna. She went back to\nVienna when she was 91 years old. And she would go to co orts (ph). She went to\nShroonz (ph), and she kept those forshluganuh (ph) people as friends all her life. And it\nwas -- it was -- it's an interesting thing. But I -- I'm little different about it. I don't -- I\ndon't know -- I, you know, I -- I meet people and they ask me about -- and I do talk on the\nHolocaust. And they say to me, What do you remember? And I said, I've read some of\nthese books. Some of these books are, like, these 5-year-old children will have anepiphany, Oh, I was totally aware of this and that. That's -- that's bologna because at age\nfive it's a guess. It's -- it's fun. I remember sitting in my back yard in London and\nwatching Lufbafa (ph) fight the RAF, and I thought it was wonderful, you know.\nAnd -- and riding on the train with Zowy (ph), you know -- and so my mother wasn't\nthere to annoy me, and my father was -- was never home anyhow; and I thought it was\nwonderful. Oh, I'm sorry. And I thought it was wonderful.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you speak any English at all by the age of five?",
        "A: I spoke no English --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- but within three weeks in the -- in -- because Bunts Court, English only. English\nonly. So people say, What do you remember? I say, Well, I remember Bunts Court\nschool. I remember that one of my roommates was named Wolfe, and he ate paper. If he\nneeded attention, he ate paper. I remember when I turned seven years of age, I had my\nteddy bear named Peter. And in order to prove that I was a man, I flushed Peter down the\ntoilet. These are the things I remember, and, yet, it was such a significant time.\nBut -- it's not lost on children, but our reactions -- if you put 90 percent of these people\nback into a hypnotic trance and ask them to repeat the things that they've told you, they\nwould say, Well, I think that happened, but it's all post-knowledge. You learn about what\nyou've done later. But for kids -- people always tell me -- you know, I -- I flew combat, I\nflew 130 missions in Vietnam, and I lost a lot of friends. And people say to me, Do you\nhave any regrets? Because a lot of these people -- why me? Why did my mother -- my\nmother didn't love me. She kept my sister and let me go. That doesn't make any sense tome. And I always say to the people, Look. The question always comes up. How do you\nfeel? I said, 1am very sorry for your loss, and I am very sorry that they didn't make it. I\nwill not say that I am -- I wish it were me because I do not. I am very glad that I did\nmake it. It's the luck of the draw. And if -- I couldn't survive if I didn't think that way. I\ncouldn't think that way. And yet it's difficult. These people -- my -- my capadres (ph)\nhere in their 80s -- and then, you know, we're reasonably young because you couldn't\nhave been born before '23. So our oldest are only 87 years old, and that's young because\nthere are a lot of Holocaust survivors, and it's a horrible thing. I mean, we were not\nscathed. We weren't scarred and we weren't beaten, and we -- we -- we -- you know, but\nit's tough because many of these people lost so many people and -- but I have no guilt, no\nregrets at all. I -- I couldn't -- I'm reasonably upbeat, and I couldn't be that way if I\nthought that way. There you have my story.",
        "Q: Thank you very much. I would just like to --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: -- go back a little bit to Vienna and to England.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: First of all, my question is, was it your grandmother's decision to send you by\nKindertransport?",
        "A: No. My grandfather proudly found out the Kindertransport was going, and it's\ninteresting. I've met some people here -- I just had breakfast with a gentleman who said\nhe came from a poor family in Vienna. You have to remember that the Austrian Jew\nwas -- of that time was pretty uneducated because there were not a lot of us, but the\nAustrian was -- Vienna was an intelligent city anyhow, and most of -- most of the Jews\nwere upper-middle class. But he said he was -- he was son of a salesman, and he was\npoor. But he was a stateless pole (ph), and that -- that way he was able to go late. The\nfirst two or three trains, from what I understand, were filled with people whose children\nare people of influence. Once again, I don't regret it. I'm not sorry that my grandparents\nhad money.",
        "Q: Do you know that they had to pay a lot of money for --",
        "A: I would --",
        "Q: -- you to --",
        "A: -- imagine some money changed hands. Either that or my grandfather just by status,\njust by status had enough -- he -- he wasn't a super observant Jew, but I know he\nbelonged to the biggest synagogue in Vienna and, you know, and he -- that's how the lists\nwere made through there.",
        "Q: Do you know what organization managed Kindertransports in Vienna?",
        "A: No. I'm five. I'm six.",
        "Q: Yeah. Sure. Do you -- do you know if your parents knew that you were being sent to\nEngland when they were in jail?",
        "A: Yeah because the -- the -- it was a one-way street because we didn't know they were\nalive. Yeah. Basically in the beginning because my -- our nanny's name was Resi,\nR-e-s-i, and she was married to a guy named Pepe, P-e-p-e, and he was a photographer.\nAnd I'm a photographer, and I have a lot of old pictures you know, of us in the -- the\nmountains. And because wherever we went, the nanny went, and wherever the nannywent, the boyfriend went. And I have pictures of myself in you know in Lay De Hoison\n(ph) up in the -- in the Alps and so news, my grandparents were informed because they\nwould supply the money to Resi -- they would pay a little bit to go visit my mother, and\npick up the -- which 1s -- if I tell you that somebody was in prison and somebody\nhad -- had -- had a private person to do their laundry, you wouldn't -- but it was done. It\nwas done. Not anymore, it couldn't be done that way.",
        "Q: Do you know if your grandparents could visit their children --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- in the prison? No?",
        "A: No. My grandfather was -- my grandfather was already -- he left right after the\nAnschluss. He went to the United States, so my grandmother ran the show, but my\ngrandmother always ran the show. But she was the perfect wife. And she was everything\nmy mother was not. My kids loved my grandmother. They loved my mother too because\nthere was gifts. My mother's favorite two holidays were Easter and Christmas. This is\nfrom a Jewish woman. You know, and we always had a Christmas tree because she\nloved Christmas. But she always had Passover, but --",
        "Q: It was Christian Christmas, right?",
        "A: Of course. Of course. She liked -- she would visit us right around Passover. Come\nfor Passover. And I was military so I -- stationary, and she would bring battachini (ph)\nand botten (ph) kosher candy for the holidays and chocolate bunnies -- Easter bunnies for\nthe kids. She was -- if somebody would've played my mother in a movie, it would be\nBetty White because -- or -- or even -- or -- she -- she was a little bit oblivious, and shewas an absolute expert on opera. She was an absolute expert on all this stuff and life just\nflew, you know. She just -- and she was always like that, and she was totally oblivious of\nthe world situation. And when I went to Vietnam and my wife was in Columbus, Ohio,\nwith a friend, and she would get a telephone call from my mother. And she'd say, Was\nthat Paul? And Betty'd say, What are you talking about? She said, An airplane crashed\nin Chicago. Military airplane cashed in Chicago. A military airplane went down in\nGermany. Was that Paul? And she'd say, Mom, thank you for telling me, but, look, if\nI -- it's not Vietnam. If it's Vietnam, before you know it, I know it because the military\ntakes care of its own. It would be horrible, and you would hear the news from me, not\nfrom a newspaper. You have to stop calling me because when you do that you're\nworrying yourself to death over nothing because he's not -- he's not in Germany and he's\nnot in Chicago. He's in Vietnam. And the news comes out, I get it before you. But she\nwas oblivious of the world situation like that. And she just went through life -- she was\nthe perfect -- she was the perfect candid (ph). You know the Panglossian theory of we're\nliving in the best of all possible worlds. And here's -- two years in a German defangnus\n(ph) who is friends, stays friends with the people who did not visit her when she was\nthere. That -- nobody visited them, but it was just two inopportune years 1n her life.",
        "Q: That's great.",
        "A: It's unrealistic and she -- my sister ended up -- my sister died early. She was a\npsychiatrist. She was -- I mean, she was a doctor, and she was a psychiatrist who became\nnonfunctioning. She was so -- she was so bipolar that she ended up being on social -- she\nwas -- went on social security because she could not -- could not work, and she died atthe age -- one week short of her 70th birthday. And I've taken both her daughters in\nas -- put them into my family. But my -- my kids remember my grandmother fondly -- I\nmean, my mother fondly because she brought them presents, but they remember my\ngrandmother with love because they remember this wonderful, wonderful woman\nwho -- who died in '96 and who was just regal. She just floated. But I used to sit in\nForest Hills -- I -- in Jackson Heights. I used to sit in her apartment and watch her make\nstrudel. Now this woman who had the best of all possible worlds could make the best\ndamn strudel in the world and she would sit there with me sitting at her -- sitting at the\ntable, and she would roll this -- and that's -- those are memories. Those are great\nmemories for me, and not -- I wish it was my mother, but it wasn't. It was my\ngrandmother that I remember these great things about. And my -- my mother was just -- I\nended up being the -- she lived number one Lincoln Center looking down into the opera\nhouse. It's 2164 Street, and she had 24/7 help because she -- she was getting ill. She was\ngetting older. And when she stopped looking out the window -- because the view was\nmagnificent, you could look out into the Lincoln Center, we kidnapped her and brought\nher to -- brought her to Moorestown, New Jersey, and we put her into -- into the\nEvergreens which is a marvelous senior community nursing home. She lasted six\nmonths, and -- let me -- have I -- have I got a minute this-- this -- this --",
        "Q: Yes, you have. If you want to take a break at any time just let me know.",
        "A: I'ma talker. The -- I brought her -- we kidnapped her. We brought her to this very,\nvery elegant -- it was a Presbyterian home -- a Pescable (ph) home but it was beautiful.\nAnd she -- my mother even said, This was very elegant, which 1s, from her words, a realcompliment. And I took up the first day, and I put her in a wheelchair so I could\nmobile -- she could walk, but -- and we walk -- we sat out in the gardens and we were\nsitting there looking -- and this is September, and she says to me, When is -- when is\nEaster? This is a Jewish woman. And I'm sitting there and I said, Well, Ma, let's see.\nThis is September. We just had Labor Day. Thanksgiving is coming up. And then\nand -- and I said then Hanukah, and I'm trying to be Jewish, and she -- and I said, And\nthen it's Christmas. And I said, Valentine's Day and then comes Easter. And the next\ntime I came in, she said to me, What time is it? And I said, It's 9:00. And she said,\nMorning or evening? And I would say, If it was 9:00 in the evening, both of us would be\nin bed. She would say, When is Easter? And I would go through that same thing. If I\ncame in the afternoon and she'd say, What time is it? And I'd say, 4:00. She'd say,\nMorning or afternoon? And I'd say, If it was morning, I would -- you and I would both\nbe in bed. When is Easter? My mother died on Easter morning. And I don't believe in\nthis. I don't believe in the mystic. But it was just -- why would a little Jewish woman\nwith no connections to Easter want to know when Easter was coming? And she died on\nEaster morning.",
        "Q: That's incredible.",
        "A: It -- itis. And my mother was not a mystic. And she was 94, and she had a very good\nlife, including -- I mean, excluding two years, but those don't count. In her mind, my\nmother was 92. She forgot those three years. I would imagine. She never talked about\nit. My dad never talked about it either. And it must have been hard. It must have been\nharder because of the fact that it was a debasing experience for somebody who is not usedto being debased. We only lost one relative, and that was my Uncle Jacque (ph) who was\nthe third brother. And he -- I think he died of Daha (ph). And -- and then, of course, you\nknow, further-out people, but there weren't a lot of us. We were a very small family.\nNow we're a big family. I have nine grandsons. Five of them have my name. So, you\nknow, that's -- that's good. No. As a matter of fact, six of them have my name. And they\nrange from 25 to 7 and they're a joy. They're my -- they're my -- they're my boys, and I\nhave a good relationship with them. And I have the money and the -- you know, I have\nthe time and the money, and I -- and we -- we do things together. And my -- my\ngrandson has invited me to come -- he's a skydiver. He wants me to skydive. And I don't\nthink I'm going to do that. I'm a little bit too old for that. I don't feel old. I don't feel old.\nIt's been an interesting life. I mean, I've had -- I lost my wife two years ago after 54\nyears, and I moved into a -- I moved out of -- I lived in a senior CCRC (ph), went from\nthe Jewish generation of Cherry Hill, South Jersey Federation, and I was up the board. I\nwas among the original tenants at this place, and I was on a board, and I fought a good\nfight against them, you know, and I'm still very good friends with all the people there.\nAnd when my wife died, I -- it was perpetual shiver, you know, and I just couldn't do that\nanymore so I moved on. And I still -- I still go over and help install -- I set up the sound\nsystems and -- because I was a graphic designer so I -- you know, I did -- well, maybe I\nshould touch the fact that I went from Ohio State University directly into the Air Force. I\nspent 20 years in the Air Force as a flyer, as an information officer, as an intelligence\nofficer. And when I got out, my wife and I opened a copy shop, and then we ended\nup -- there were -- we started with just my wife and I, and when we sold 26 years later,we had 11 people. And my wife was the treasurer, so I have all the money I ever need for\nrest of my life because she -- I -- I was the schmoos (ph) and she was the -- she was the\nbusiness end, and we were a good team. And my kids after about eight months, they said\nto me, I was -- I was sour and I needed to socialize. So I said to my daughter, Define\nsocialize. And she said, How old are you? And I said, I understand. I said, what do your\nbrothers think? She said, they put me up to this. They're afraid of you. So I -- I have\nbeen seeing people, and I have gotten into a relationship with a widow who 1s\nsuperintendent of schools of Donna Woodridge -- was. And we -- we have a mutual\nrespect for each other. We've compartmentalized that part of our lives, and she's Jewish\nand I'm back to -- now I go to show Friday nights because she goes to show. She keeps\nKosher. She keeps Kosher so I represent that in her home. We -- she doesn't keep\nKosher out, and she doesn't -- you know, when she comes to visit me. But I'm back to\nbeing a Jew which I really never was. You know, as military man, I used to get a lot of,\nWhat's a good Jewish boy doing in the Army? And I said, Air Force. And there is a lot\nof them. Like Jews represent, what, one half or one percent of the population in this\ncountry, small part. My grandson is an Air Force Academy graduate.\nSeven -- seven -- almost eight percent of the class was Jewish which is anomaly, but it's\nnot. It's a good life -- I mean -- and I did it because kind of -- I kind of feel, you save my\nlife -- I felt like my dad. You saved my life. Let me pay you back. And I enjoyed my\nmilitary life. It was hard on my wife, but I don't regret it.",
        "Q: Great. Thank you.",
        "A: Okay.\nQ: Yeah. I just have --",
        "A: Please.",
        "Q: I would like to return back to England now.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Do you remember how you were treated in England those years you had to spend\nthere?",
        "A: Never left the campus the year and a half -- the year and a half --",
        "Q: Did you make some friends there?",
        "A: Not permanent. And I -- once in a while, there were people here who tell me they\nwere in Bunts Court when I was there. I do not rememberer. I do not remember. I do\nremember that my sister -- there I hit her in the head with a rock because she was\ntormenting me. She was trying to be my mother, and I threw a rock and I caught her\nright between -- right between the eyes. And -- and I -- to this day, I think it was a 200\nfeet, but 1t was probably five feet. But like I said, it's -- it's -- it's interesting. It's hard.\nEverything is hindsight. You -- I have glimpses, and I remember we used to -- for tea,\nwe would toast bread at the fireplace. We had a long fork, and we would toast bread.\nAnd I remember classes were really -- I mean, we learned -- I mean, it was -- it was a\nBritish boarding school run by a -- a -- a German martinet, you know, who really ran a\ntough school. But we weren't beaten; we weren't abused. And I don't ever ever\nremember going into town. I know we did. I don't remember it. I don't care. You know,\nI do -- I do remember when we moved to -- when we -- when the school moved. I think\nthey went to Shropshire (ph). We came to London, and we stayed with my uncle inLondon. And I remember the Blitz (ph) and in the beginning, we used to go every day\ndown to the -- the shelters and the subways, and then after a while with -- you get hit, you\nget hit, you know.",
        "Q: Was this school only for Kindertransport kids?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Jewish kids?",
        "A: Yes. If you were -- there's a very good book called My Heart's in a Suitcase. Anne\nFox wrote it and she's here. And she was at Bunts Court, and there's a whole chapter on\nBunts Court. And I think Anne is a little bit older than Iam. But, once again, it's\nreconstructionist history because you cannot remember methodology, and you cannot\nremember motivation when you're five and six. You remember the good times.",
        "Q: Were you missing your parents or grandparents there? Do you remember your\nthoughts about them?",
        "A: When I came to the United States, my sister almost immediately went to Kingston,\nand I was angry because Kingston was -- New York City; but I -- I lived with my\ngrandparents in Forest Hills, and I -- we were in an apartment building there we didn't\nown which is really funny. My grandfather didn't own this one. It was really -- it was in\nthe right off -- right off Greens Boulevard and I walked to school and I had a nice life.\nAnd I -- I never -- because of the fact that my family was a little bit disjointed to start\nwith, my mother was the ultimate intrarude (ph). I mean -- I mean, it -- she was a\nhadanist (ph). She enjoyed her life, and she would -- she had a nanny for us, you know.\nUntil the day she went to prison, she had a nanny -- and she -- for the good times. Butmy sister was already manifesting signs of bipolarism. When she got difficult, she would\nsay to the nanny, You need to take her out. And that -- that's, you know, and that of\ncourse effected it. So my connections with my parents was a little bit different\nthan -- and my dad was a business man. And my -- when I was born, he was 43, and we\nreally didn't talk. And when we came to the United States, it was a little bit too late.\nHis -- I'm -- he's 51; I'm 8, 9. But later on in life, we became friends. We became good\nfriends.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- was it --",
        "A: To this day -- well, you know, when I came back and I -- I became the Dutch\nAmericana shu press officer (ph), I had to -- my German got better again, and I got to the\npoint where I could -- but I used to use words and people'd say, Where'd you get that\nword? And I'd say, well, I'm Austrian. Yeah, but you left when you were six. What\nsix-year-old child says Auskasidenidt (ph)? You know? Or, you know, I -- I had a hell\nof a vocabulary. You know, I was a -- I was a precocious brat. I know that because I was\na spoiled kid, and my sister -- my sister was probably smarter than I was. I mean,\nshe -- she became a doctor, and she -- you know, she was a good student and everything\nelse, but I don't regret what I do. I have a Master's degree, and I'm in public relations;\nand I -- I have good friends and I -- but not -- not as many as I should have because it's\nkind of the military restriction, and you move on and you go someplace else. And I've\nadopted a lot of -- my lady friends, for instance, she's had 60 years and it's different life.It's a good life, but it's -- it's enjoyable. And I enjoy being around -- and it's a solid\nJewish community. I mean, these are -- one of them is a Holocaust survivor, and we all,\nyou know -- they -- they -- they -- they just sit around and drink coffee and -- and play\ncards and -- and talk about nothing hours on end, but it's -- I like it. I -- I like it. And\nthen Shelly and I go to -- go to the theater or we go to a museum, and then we go back\nand we -- and we go to a dance, you know, and -- and it's become -- I'm ready for that.\nI've never really had that. And I've got my kids as friends, and I -- I enjoy my life.",
        "Q: Great. Well, Mr. Halpern, now we have to pause and change tracks here. We'll just\npause it.\nEnd of File One\nBeginning File Two",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial interview of Paul Felix\nHalpern conducted by Juliet Danilian on October 17th of 2010 at the Kindertransport\nAssociation Conference in Arlington, Virginia. So I would like to get back to the time\nwhen you first came to the states. Do you remember your first impression like what were\nyour thoughts and what can you think about your experience in being in England and this\nHolocaust ordeal?",
        "A: New adventure. You know, once again I'm eight years old now and I'm -- and I -- I\nspoke perfect English by that time. And the thing that I remember the most of all was I\ncame into Montreal. And as I told you that my first impression was the Dick Tracy\ncomics and the Tarzan comics and that started my love for comics real early at that time.\nBut I got into the habit of reading billboards. You know, these roads signs and myEnglish -- if I didn't know what the word meant, you know, American, American English\nis different than English English. You know, there was signs for everything. But I was\nfascinated but I remember on the train reading all the billboards. And nobody in my\nfamily -- my grandfather didn't need a car. In New York you don't know a car. But if we\ntravel I read, I would read the subway, the billboards. And I enjoyed the new experience.\nAnd I fit in pretty well. School -- my sister was a little bit abrasive. Like I say she was\nfunctioning. And but I was, I made friends easily. And my best friend was named -- and\nno Jewish kid should ever be named Palmer Kelpelman. Who knows a Jewish kid\nPalmer, P-A-L-M-E-R. Palmer Kelpelman and I got into more trouble. We would ride,\nwe would ride our ride bikes. We would ride our bikes through Forest Hills. And we were\n-- we would go into the candy store and swipe candy. I mean, not because we needed\ncandy but because you could do that. And I ran into Palmer like don't ask me where it\nwas but I think we were about 40 years old at the time. He was the most boring, stuffy\nperson that I've ever met in my life. You know, he was just -- it was just funny that out of\nthat, that one thing Palmer was a bore. And then I ran, I had a friend named Lee Levine.\nAnd Lee's father owned Peter Pan bakeries of New York City.They ran up to about 200\nstores and then there was problems and then they came back. And I road a tricycle\nbecause they wouldn't give me a bicycle. And Lee had a bicycle. And we ran all around\nForest Hills, you know. And years later, my middle son was 14. So this is 36 years ago,\nwe sent him to a sports camp. We sent my middle son to a sports camp at Tom Castella,\nhe used to be a football player. And we went up to visit him and he said, \"Dad, you know\nsomebody named Lee Lavine?\" And I said, \"That's a name out of the past from when Iwas eight years old. Nine years old.\" He said, \"His son is here.\" And Lee, his father flies\nin to visit him every couple of weeks. He was like there six weeks. \"And he takes us out.\"\nAnd I said, \"You sure it's the same guy?\" Well, he said, \"I don't know but he owns all\nthese bakeries named --\" and I said, \"Peter Pan.\" \"Yeah.\" So you know, there one, one\nkid becomes -- one kid becomes -- and the third one of my group was a kid name Richy\nRaskind. And Richy Raskind, his father was an ophthalmologist. And I started to learn\nhow to fly in the Civil Air Patrol and he was also -- and he crashed. And he became -- I\nvisited him. He was -- and he crashed out in Long Island. And he was like\n16 like I was and he survived, you know. And had some plastic surgery done. We used to\nplay at his house all the time. And he was quite wealthy and I was just, you know, I was a\nlittle kid down the block who lived with his grandparents. And he turned into -- he\nbecame Renee Richards. You know who Renee Richards is? That's the sex change\ntennis player. So Richy Raskind became Renee Richards, which I guess was some weird\nfriends. And among my childhood friends Mike Nichols, the director, and my sister were\nan item. My mother and dad used to go to Tanner's Field (ph) room. And to celebrate\nwhere you sat on the porch, you know, you rocked on the porch and they did bring us up\nthere. And the people -- Ms. Nichols owned it. Owned the place. And Mike and Bobby\nwere her sons and they kind of helped out there. And my sister and he -- and years later,\nyears later he went to the University of Chicago. Left for years later I'm in Oklahoma and\nI'm at the University, and I have to fly, I have to fly to get my flying pay. We didn't have\nto do any work so I bought a Playboy Magazine with an interview with Michael Nichols.\nSo I'm reading this thing. And I began to laugh. And somebody said, \"What are youlaughing at?\" I said, \"My sister just made Playboy.\" And they said, \"You're kidding. Let's\nsee.\" And they asked Michael Nichols, \"Do you remember your first sexual\nexperience?\" And he describes the area behind, the woods behind Tanner's field where\nthe flash was. And he said, he goes to this entire thing, you know, but and he said, \"I was,\nI was 16 and she was 18.\" You know, and he says, \"You always remember your first\nexperience,\" you know. And I came back from having to getting that. So I called my\nmother and I said, \"Hi, mom. Listen, you might want to get a copy of Playboy\nMagazine.\" And said, \"I know.\" And I said, \"Oh, really. How do you know?\" She said,\n\"One of my friends told me.\" I said, \"She's not your friend, mom.\" And she said, \"Yes,\nbut you think it's really Lucie?\" I said,\"Mom. Tanner's Field, New York?\"\n\"Well, she wasn't 18. She was only 17.\" I said, \"Mom, who cares.\" Then I called my\nsister. And I said, \"Hey, Mike Nichols remembers you fondly.\" And she said, \"Send me a\ncopy.\" I said, \"The hell with you. You know, buy your own copy.\" But so that's another\nclaim to fame I have that my sister was -- Michael Nichols as first big -- and he is\nmagnificent, you know. He's a good director. He was a good comedian. I mean he did\nthe Graduate. He did, you know, we know a few famous people. Like I said Peter\nDanovich's his family. And friend Zimmerman who died. He directed High Noon and\ndirected Oklahoma. He was a Vietnamese. And he used to visit my mother because my\ngrandmother and my -- and Fred's mother were friends in Vienna. And any time he was\nin New York he would come and see my mother. He never talked film because my\nmother didn't understand films.",
        "Q: Only Opera?\nA: Let's not talk trains. You know, but so my claim to fame, the famous people I know\nare all, are all directors. All of them, all of them won Academy Awards. So it was a good\nlife. And then when my parents came, we moved. We got an apartment in the same\napartment house that my grandparents lived. So if I had enough of my mother I would go\nup and see, visit my grandmother. And my mother was totally oblivious but she did work\nhard. Let me put it this way here was this mom who used to -- my mother -- one year\nwhen she was young in Vienna I understand took a course in stringing pearls. What kind\nof a job is that? But my mother could string pearls. She couldn't cook but she could -- and\nshe was quite -- she was -- you probably gathered that I'm not that much of a fan of my\nmother's. I have a Galle Vase. Galle is really -- and it belonged to my mother. It was\ngiven to her by a gentleman who I met. Who was about 10 years older than my mother.\nAnd like she always used to talk about this guy and the la moor (ph). And I finally met\nhim in Switzerland and I know just in my heart that it had been more than a friendship.\nAnd so I have this Galle vase which is kind of irritating. It's beautiful. And it is out with\nthe antique, some of the antique dealers from the antique dealers, I'm trying to get a\ndecent estimate price for it to place it. I'm not going to pass that onto my, to my kids. But\nand I don't need the money. And what I will do with that money is that money I will --\neventually it will go in my estate, my three kids can have the money. I don't want to give\nanybody that vase. I just want to give them the money. And so I was up, I was up in\nLandenville, (ph) and they said, \"You have any provenance (ph) for this?\" \"I said,\n\"Yeah.This is a vase that my mother's boyfriend gave to her.\" And they said, \"Excuseme?\" I said, \"Yeah, don't ask.\" But we live a kind of strange life. I've always been this\nkind of a wacky person.",
        "Q: Well, your Holocaust experience sounds like one big adventure for you. Do you have\nlike some negative memories or were you realizing what was going on in Europe when\nyou enter the states?",
        "A: Yeah, I was pretty -- 'cause I followed. And of course, all young boys and since I was\na voracious reader I knew I had the battle maps, you know. And I was at Boy Scout\nCamp when they dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. And I remember we stood and\ncheered. You know, and now in retrospect it had to be done but it's horrific. It's horrific,\nyou know. But I had a military attitude. And my grandson now flies the drones in\nAfghanistan. He's in Las Vegas flying to Afghanistan. And he doesn't talk about it. He\ndoesn't talk about it. He's not allowed to. But I know he's doing awful --because -- but it's\nbetter that no American pilots are getting killed. The airplanes will do the work. And he's\n-- that's his job. And he and I talk -- his father tries to vicariously live his son's life but he\ngravitates towards me because I'm a combat flyer. And I flew -- I was in Cambodia and I\nflew a lot of friends in it. And when he talks he talks to me. And we have a good\nrelationship. Well, I love all my grandsons. It's just fun. I take every one of them when\nthey turn 12, I take them out to Bar Mitzvah trip. And I started with Joe. And the deal is\nyou get in the car on a Friday afternoon and we go somewhere basically where -- the first\ntrip where we went on a NFL football weekend to Washington, D.C. We stayed in\nGeorgetown and we had a great -- that was Joe. And now I have got it pretty well\nrefined. Lincoln, I took one of them flying. We flew around the Statute of Liberty. Wewent to the battleship in New York. The Aircraft Carrier Intrepid. But they get in the car\nand I say to them, \"This is what we are going to do. This is your party. Anything you\nwant to say to me you can say and whatever you say 1n this car, stays in this car. And it's\nyour party. The deal is you said you would like to do this, if you're tired or you're bored,\nwe are out of there. We will find something else to do in the two days. And I know your\nfather, your mother says 'Be sure you say thank you.\" I don't want to hear that. If you have\na good time when I drop you off at home, say 'Thank you.\" And usually in the beginning\nit's like kind of quiet. And then we just chat because I always make sure we do some\ndriving like that. We drove from Philadelphia to the Meadowlands to see a football game.\nI went to the Cooper's Town Hall of Fame. We went to see Boston Red Sox play in\nBoston. And it's two days. And I had -- I've got a 15 year old. He got in the car at twelve\nand a half. He says -- I said, \"You kind of know what's, you know, what to expect.\" He\nsaid, \"Yeah.\" I said, \"You can say anything you want.\" And he said, \"Can I say this?\"\nAnd he said a four letter word. I said, \"Sure.\" He said, \"How about this?\" He did about\nsix words. I said, \"Very impressive.\"",
        "Q: Challenging.",
        "A: Yeah. Very impressive. I said, \"So what else do you want to talk about?\" You know,\nso he got out of it. And he's getting -- he had his headset and he's listening to music crap.\nWithin an hour he's got the headset off and we're having a good, we are having a --\nbecause my wife used to say it's amazing my boy -- my grandsons love me and until they\ngo on that last trip. After that last trip they are yours. That's really funny. We will sit\nsomewhere and they will sit shoulder -- on my shoulders. You know, we sit in theliving room both boys sit -- I'm not --I'm not Oppa and I'm not Vaggy. (Ph). And I'm not\nPop Pop. I would kill the first child that calls me Pop Pop. I hate that. And then it's -- they\ncall my grandpa. And we have -- one of them called my gramps and that's my inventor\nand he does that just to irritate me. And he also when I started getting bold he was also\nthe one that does this to me. But other than that I've got a good life, you know, I have\nbeen -- I enjoy what I do. And I know a lot of people just because I -- I don't -- I have\nbeen having an interesting time here. And I went to this seminar on can we do a plan\nfrom the next possible Kindertransport? Is it possible to come up with a plan. And of\ncourse, the argument was in this modern day and age if it's a disaster like -- she started to\ntalk about Katrina. I said we can do Katrina, the world can save Katrina because we\nhave the airplanes. And we have the equipment. And we can go down to Haiti. I did the\nHaiti. I was in McGuire as retired and I helped with the Haitian Airlift. I helped the\nrefugee thing because that's what I do. And I said but the Kindertransports, Rwanda\nneeded a Kindertransporter but because they were black it was messy. And so the final\nthing she said was we have to sum this up. I said, \"You know, the next time you need a\nKindertransport for a specific group, put them in a mine in Chile where within 69 days\neverybody will be rescued and there will be no political stuff because that's what the\nworld does best. I mean this thing with the miners. So let's put the problem into a mine in\nChili and the world will solve it. Otherwise, Rwanda is still not solved. You know,\nKosovo, Sarajevo; not solved. They are still finding bodies.",
        "Q: Haitian.\nA: Yeah, it's horrific. Those are the problems that will not be solved -- because people\ndidn't like each other. But everybody likes a good story and those miners were a good\nstory and the world did their thing perfectly. I mean there was no flag because they all\nflew the Chilean flag and they made sure but it was done correctly. And that's -- if we\ncould solve the world's problems, if we can put the problems in a mine in Chili. And\nthat's the way I feel. You know, I kind of came to -- I was listening to this conversation\non a -- I don't particularly like a lot of the -- a lot of the Austrian Jews have quite a bit of\nthem because we didn't get reparations for a long time. They treated us like idiots.\nSo this lady from the Austrian deligation, the gentleman from Germany was fantastic.\nYou could ask him a question and he would think about it. And you know, \"Yeah, we\nwere wrong.\" You know, you are, you know, fourth generation. She said she started to\ntalk about all of the wonderful things that the Australian government, all of these\nprograms for the poor benefited Jews of Israel -- of Austria. And she went on and on and\non. And somebody said to her, \"How many Jews are left in Austria? How many Jews?\"\nShe said, \"Well, I could kind of go with 3,000. \"We are up to 15,000 but there are not the\n15,000, the Austrian Jews, the upper middle class society that held with the culture of\nVienna. It's Russian, Ukrainian, you know, Polish. And people hardworking labors\nbasically. It's one step down. And she said, \"15,000.\" And I was texting Shelly. And I\nsaid, \"This lady from Austria just tells me they have 15,000 --\" she said, there are 15,000\nJews left in Austria. She listed enough programs that every Jew could have one special\nproject because she kept talking about all of these people. There is only 15,000. They\ncouldn't do all of these things. This is all people wanting to play this \"Give game,\" youknow. And it's wrong. It's wrong. And I'm not -- I'm not a fan of the Austrians. I don't\nmind the Germans. I enjoyed, you know, at least you can, you know, that's the past.\nAustria is still in this to this day. I know that. I know that. And the Austrian -- I mean\nhere, you know, a lot of the people here from here from the Holocaust do not like their\nhome county and will not visit or visit and are very uncomfortable.",
        "Q: When did you visit for the first time after the war? After the Holocaust? When was it?",
        "A: 1968 when I took -- the first time I went back to Austria was when I took the band, the\nGlen Miller band to Grats and Mimins and the military. And then I visited again with my\nwife and kids again in '68. And then just last November I was in Vienna in 2009 with my\ngrandson.",
        "Q: And your grandparents went?",
        "A: My grandfather died young, he died when I was 14. So he died in 1946.",
        "Q: And he died in the States?",
        "A: Yeah. He -- well, I told you he came and he said, \"I'm going to the United States,\" and\nhe played the game. And my grandmother lived to be 96. And marvelous woman.\nMarvelous woman. And the family they put her into a nursing home in Queens but a real\nnice one. I used to visit her.And she she would be -- she was 90. I would say, \"Why don't\nyou go?\" Those are old people. I don't go with old people.\" And she was the oldest\nperson there. And so at that time her son, my uncle Walter whom I love dearly, bought\nher a television set. And I understand every morning she read the large print edition of\nthe New York Times. I mean that's how good she was. And she watched television. She\nwatched sports and cartoons not because it moved. You know, when you get to be 90years old and you're bored and your language, that's not your primary language, sports is\neasy to watch and cartoons. So my uncle Walter tells a story that it was the finals of the\nNCAA Basketball Tournament between Michigan State and Magic Johnson. These are\npeople that you don't know but these are great athletes. And nine out the ten players on\nthe floor were black. And they are all big and they were running up and down in the\nsports shorts. And my grandmother is, he's kind of watching the game, you know, a little\nbit. And she says to him, \"Walter, what are they doing?\" He said, \"They are playing\nbasketball Mom.\" And she said, \"Oh.\" She watched for a while and she said, \"Which are\nthe Jewish boys?\" And they were nine, six foot, inch when they are going for that. You\nknow, but that's a fond memory. That's a fond memory. She was a wonderful woman.\nWonderful woman. I like, I dearly loved her. She loved us which was the interesting\nthing. And I have no idea where she spawned a spoiled brat of a child that was my\nmother. And who -- at 90 was a spoiled brat. She was entertaining and she, you know,\nand like I said, I told you I thought Betty White would play her in the movie. Bill Burke\nwould have played her in the movie. That's before your time. That was my mom. And\nbut my kids loved her because grandma was synonymous with presents. My wife on the\nother hand ran my kids a little bit better. My daughter had Aaron who was very bright\nand he was two years -- coming up on two. And she would say dada and she wouldn't say\nmomma. And she said, \"You know, mom --\" she my wife baby-sat for her one day\nbecause she was doing some work and her sitter was out. And she said, \"You know, that\nkind of hurts.\" She says -- they work for us. Her husband worked for us. She says, \"He\nwill says daddy. He won't say momma.\" So she went away. She came back about fourhours later. And Betty said to Aaron, \"Who is that?\" And Aaron said, \"Momma.\" And\nshe said, \"Who am I?\" She said, \"Momma.\" And she said, \"How did you do that?\" She\nsaid, \"Really stmple.We had lunch and I said, 'Do you want dessert?' She said, \"Yes.\" I\nsaid to him, if you want dessert say momma.\" He said momma. And later on she said,\n\"Do you want some candy? What, do you say?\" \"Momma.\" So within 30 minutes she\ntaught them how to say a word that my daughter had been working on for months.\nBut that's the difference between my wife and my mother, you know. My mother would\nbe the person that would talk about herself for hours and at the end of it, she would say,\n\"Well, that's enough about me. Let's talk about you. What do you think of me.\" I mean\nthat was the attitude that she had. And it was charming but at the same time after a while,\nyou know, it's, it's up here. And it's not, it's not deep. But I was five when I left. I was in\nsix -- well, five when she left me, you know, to go to prison. And I was always taken\ncare of by nannies and so on. So my bonding with my mother was never really a bond.\nAnd it was her problem; not mine. When we came back to the United States she was busy\n-- they were trying to make a living. My dad came back. But the minute they came back\ninto the situation where they -- where they could do well, it became her story again and\nnot mine. You got to remember she went back in 1940 -- 1950, she went back to Austria\nto spend six months out the year. I was 17, she left. I was a freshman in college and she\nleft. I got to be an anchor -- you know, at Ohio State. She could do that and never look\nback. And never look back on it. And there was no nanny for me. And I was a hard\ncase. I mean I was -- I know what I wanted which I had no idea what was it but I knew\nwhat I wanted that's why, \"He's a big boy.\"\nQ: What did your dad do when he came to the States?",
        "A: Well, first thing he did was he looked for work. And he came up with this idea of the\npitman shortage was starting. And in Europe women carry net shopping bag, you know,\nfishnet shopping. And so like I said, he got my mother's friends who are all wonderful\nbecause they were all society women. They could all do embroidering and they could do\nthis stitch. And they stitched these handles. Beautiful colors. They got the most colorful\nrolls to do that and he immediately started selling them. He took two dozen to\nBloomingdale's and they ordered 100 dozen the first day he was there. Now he's got to\nget woman in line to do this. And then he did this and he did that. And then he became\npolitely put it he became a facilitator. He went into the import/export business. During\nthe War and after the War he was friends with -- he made friends with a guy named Sam\nSpig -- Sam Spiggel. And they had their European contacts and so on. And whenever\nsomething was needed, they understood how to get it legally. Not illegally. Legally they\nknew where to get things. They would -- the need -- like my dad invented these shopping\nbags for Americans but knowing it from Europe. They had a pretty good business\ntogether. And then Sam's son came out of the military. And he was a radar operator, you\nknow radar was new and television had just started, you know. The World Series in 1939.\nThere was and the first television was shown at the World's Fair. And the son came to us\nthere and he said, \"Television is the future.\" I know how to build -- you know, at that\ntime you could buy a kit to make a television set with tubes and the whole bit. They are\ngoing to be hundreds of television stations around the country and they need monitors.\nThey will need the monitor. It's nothing but a television set for one station basically 1swhat. I want to build perfectly, correctly done. I'll buy the kits. I want to build them and\nsell them to television stations as their monitors. And Sam came to my father and he said,\n\"I want to get into this.\" My father, you know, he was mechanically was a disaster. He\nsaid, \"If it will make us a buck,\" and they did very well. They made the first monitors for\nCBS New York and WOR and Dumont station. They had a good business. They had\nabout four or five of these guys who were really good at it. There was tubes and solder\nand wire and they would pinch them until they were correct. And then they would deliver\nthem and they got good money for them. You know, we had the first 12 inch television\nset. I watched the 1947 World Series in my house on a 12 inch TV set which was big, big\nTV set. And you know the memory of Europe after the war, a lot of Europeans came to\nthe United States. Took out their first papers, hung around for three months and went\nback to Europe, you know, because the established residence and then went back. A lot\nof my mother's friends did that. And they kind of hang out at my house a lot of times, you\nknow. I mean they lived in small quarters. There weren't that welcome because nobody\nhad a lot of -- the wealthy people didn't have a lot of money but they came to the United\nStates so they would have the protection in the next war. They would sit in my living\nroom watching television which was primitive. Eating good food and have gained,\neveryone gained 10, 15 pounds, and talk about how stupid Americans were. And I\ncouldn't stand it. And I was 12, 13. I couldn't stay in the same room with them because it\nwas impolite to me. It was impolite to be rude to your guests. But I hate -- don't talk\nabout my country like that because I'm an American. As far as I know, I'm going to be an\nAmerica. And my dad the same way. My dad was not happy with that. But they would sitand eat. They eat really good food. You know, they would and then talk down the\ncountry that they were getting first papers from. My mother said, you know, \"They're just\nprotecting themselves.\" No, you're not. You need manners. You are going to do that at\nleast if you're a hypocrite be a hypocrite with manners. Don't be a hypocrite with no\nmanners. And so you know, we didn't agree on a lot of things but nobody talked. I mean\nyou weren't allowed. You didn't talk against them.",
        "Q: Did your mom tell you something about being in prison or dad.",
        "A: A little bit. My dad not a lot. Because he was -- I can't remember. My father came out\nof Polish country stock. And so he was a self-educated man. He was never very\ncomfortable. My father never spoke to my mother, my grandmother in familiar. He never\nsaid Due. As a matter of fact if he said something, you speak German? He would say to\nmy mother through my grandmother's (Speaking German.) \"Would the dear mother like a\ncup of coffee?\" He always called her (German). De or Due. Always spoke because he\nwas -- her husband had been his boss. You know, and he was like -- my mother's family\ntreated my dad like the hired hand. He went back and he build that business. And by the\ntime the business sold they had, he had a lot of money had come back, had filtered\nthrough Switzerland legally. And they -- there's still money in Switzerland from 1968,\n'78. Still money accruing legally. Absolutely legally but he managed money correctly\nand did -- and he was their hired hand. And my mother let them do that. But you know,\nhe was so much older than I was. I didn't have that kind of -- I didn't have that much\nrespect for hem. But as I got older I liked him more and more. We really can get into\nconversations and we liked each other. My dad was a good chess player. And he wouldbeat my brains out. He never insulted me. It was always, \"Let's play another one.\" \"Oh,\nyou want to play another one. Oh, yeah.\" And I first time I beat him and I was so proud\nof myself. And so my kids, you want to play -- I'm not a good chess player but I'm better\nthan my kids. But you want to beat me, I mean you want to play me chess. You want to\nbeat me. I'm not throwing the game. You want to play Gin Rummy with me. If you are\nstupid, you're going to lose. And you know, and you know, it's not -- I'm not -- if you\nplay with me level, I'll treat you with respect and respect is play. And I'll play with you\nand when you beat me, I would say, \"Do you want to play?\" And my genius grandson\ncan beat me to death. And plays three dimensional chess. He plays this three level chess.\nHe says, \"I'm not very good at it.\" I mean, \"You can't play?\" \"Oh, I understand the game.\nI'm just not a good chess player.\" He beats my brains out. So we don't play any longer.\nBut that's -- it was a different, different kind of a family. You know, we didn't have many\nJewish ties. And maybe I regretted. That's why I kind of like Shelly. Like I said, one\nday I said to my son, I said, \"Where you going tonight?\" I said, \"I'm going to Black\nWood to be with Shelly. To Lakewood.\" He said, \"What are you going to do today?\"\n\"We're going to the show.\" And he said, \"Dad, you hear that sound?\" I said, \"What is\nthat?\" \"That's my mother spinning in her grave.\" You know, because that wasn't wasn't\nme. I enjoy it, you know. You know, because I got nothing to do right now. I'm enjoying\nmy life. You know I go to bed when I want to. I'm kind of regretting having to give up\nthis bachelor pad I've got now. Because not like, I'm a cook and there are some older\npeople living above me but they see me travel with a suitcase and Camo bag andthey know I'm a graphic designer and they know I'm a photographer. And they know --\npeople they know that I sit out there and I smoke. I'm back to smoking one cigar a day.\nAnd I sit out by the pool and I put on a headset. Here's a 77-year-old man with a headset\non and a hoody with the Air Force Academy on it smoking a cigar and listening to -- they\nhave no idea what I'm listening to. If I told them what I listen to. I listen to Doo-wop\nmusic or I listen to Mozart. And I just -- and the little Oriental kids come and play with\nme. And I say \"Mehow.\" (Ph). And they say \"Mehow.\" You know, I'm kind of like they\nhave no idea how old I am. They have no idea how old I am. I don't feel like I'm old,\nyou know, I mean you have some people here and some of them are -- I'm very -- for a\nwhile I was solid, but you know then I got my life back. For the last year I got my life\nback. And it's a new adventure because I can show -- I can -- she is sharing Judaism, you\nknow, she's been an Orthodox Jew. She is more of a mystic. She believes people have\nauras and people are this and people are that. But she's -- she is way more Jewish than I\nam. And I'm enjoying myself. I'm enjoying myself. I'm never -- I'm not happy with God.\nI'm not happy with God. I mean we work hard. My wife and I worked hard. And two\nmonths after we retire we was going to have a great time together because we got all the\nmoney in the world we need. We are going to do this. The kids are all very well off. And\nwe were going to have a good time and she strokes out on me for seven years. That's\nselfish what I just said. She just stroked out on me. She stroked out. And I would have\ndone this for the next 30 years. I would have -- as she got more infirm -- and they said,\n\"Dad, you have all of this insurance. You need to have somebody in 24/7.\" I said,\n\"Nobody sleeps with your mother but me.\" You know, I don't care if she gets up in themiddle of the night. I will take you to the bathroom and I'm not embarrassed about it. But\nyou know, your mother and I had been together for some long but I would feel wrong.\nAnd my wife -- your mother would feel wrong having to be helped to the bathroom by an\naide while I'm in the room. That's different. I would rather do it myself. And I tell you my\ndaughter told me this maybe two months ago. The last year every Saturday she would say\n-- my daughter would say -- my wife would say, \"I want to talk to my daughter.\" I dial\nthe phone. I would say or Susan would call. I would go do my Camo work for something\nelse. I would go out with the board. And they talked for what an hour and half. And she\nsaid, \"Paul, I have to go to the bathroom.\" She would say, \"I will call you back.\" I get her\na cup of coffee or something to eat and she go back to the phone. And Susan said that for\nthe last year every time she said goodbye she would say, \"Remember. Do not let him\nvegetate.\" That's a good woman. And which is a blessing, you know. Originally I said,\nyou know, it's not very long. \"Dad, you're impossible. You know, you're grumpy.\nYour outlook on life is wrong. You know, the kids -- you're affecting the kids. You're\nnot, you know, you're not who you normally are.\" And so basically she said, \"Mom\nwouldn't want do you do that. Mom wouldn't want you to do that.\" And this woman\nunderstands. I mean she -- when we did -- like November 18th is, 19th is -- is was\n28th. I would like -- but we will go to the cemetery the three of us. The four of us\ndepending on if Jack can come from Richmond. We go to the cemetery. We will go to her\nfavorite restaurant and we will order a vodka and Absolute and 7-Up and we will put it in\nthe middle of the table and we will have lunch and we will leave the glass there when we\ngo home. It's just, you know, it's something to do because we were friends. And it hasnothing to do with Jewish tradition. I mean I do not like my religion right now. I don't\nlike -- what kind of God let this go on like this? I went back to my senior community for\nthe holidays. And I didn't, I did-- I did Rosh Hashana but I fasted and I did Yom Kippur\nwith my friends because out of respect. I think, I think that she needs to be remembered.\nShe needs to be remembered for everything. And I never going to -- she is buried in a\nmilitary cemetery about 20 miles from where I live and six miles from the base. And I\nwork at the McGuire Airforce Base one day a week at the terminal helping people, space\navailable in the families. And I can go two miles out of my way and take a different road\nto the base. And I visit my wife twice a month for ten minutes. It's just -- I go out there. I\nremember one day I was at McGuire. I was going to go afterwards because it was\nsummer. It was late. And the base closed up because there were lighting storms in the\narea and they said, \"We're going to cancel all operations.\" So the weather was still clear\nand I said, \"I'm going to go out to the cemetery now.\" And I was standing there and I\ndon't know if you have seen military cemeteries, they are flat. All of headstones, you\nknow, how thousands are buried there. And I'm standing there and about 150 feet away\nwas this lighting bolt came down and hit in the middle of the woods and I began to ran. I\nmean the thunder and lighting hit together so it was right where I was. I was standing out\nthere among metal planks so I started to run for the car. And the car is 150 feet way and I\nam like awetrag. And it's raining and the lighting is hitting and I rolled the window\ndown and I said, \"That's not funny. You got me.\" But it's just, you know, it's not -- you\ndon't have to -- one of the greatest -- there's a man. His wife died in December. And\nevery time I was there, he would spend four days a week in a chair and he had a hamperfor food and he would sit for six hours a day and go have lunch and go back. He had a\npicture of his wife and he set it up in the attic. And he sat up and that's not necessary.\nYou know, we can tell stories about my wife forever and the kids understand that. I\nmean, you know. And they have a totally different idea of who she is because she is the\ntough one. You know, I went to Vietnam she ran the house. And she got into it with my\n14-year-old son about he wanted a motor scooter. And he wrote me a letter. And the letter\nsaid, \"Dear Dad, your wife is driving my crazy.\" That's beauty, isn't it? \"Your wife is\ndriving me crazy.\" I wrote her back a letter. I said, \"Join the crowd. Take a number. Live\nwith it.\" You know, what else was there. But I have a good relationship with the kids.\nYou know, you talked about German. You talk about working for Germans. My daughter\nworked -- she was IT for Siemens for 17 years. She was head of IT from big money. And\nthen when she got divorced she wanted to stick close to the home and now she works IT\nfor a buyer and she works from home and she is an absolute killer. She's a mother. She's\njust as much as my mother as her mom. And my oldest son is vice president of NCR\ncorporation and he runs the automated checkout division. And he is a combination. He's\nme. He's a little guy. Five foot six and his son is five foot four. He's a little guy but you\ndon't want to call him a little guy. I mean he's vice president NCR and he's really tough.\nHe owns a vineyard and we go out and we pick by hands for 10 years. I just finished for\nhelping. And the third one is a Cornell graduate and he's largest caterer in Virginia. Right\nnow business is not great. Nobody has any money. When Betty died, we had sold the\nhouse and we took the money to buy this apartment in this Federation, CCRC, or most of\nit and I got lucky because when I die -- when she died and I moved out I got 90 percentof my money back. That they had a year to pay me but they sold my apartment within\ntwo months. So I took 200,00 some odd thousand dollars. And I said, \"This is not my\nmoney. This is not my money.\" And I set up education funds for the remaining\ngrandchildren that hadn't been -- and I gave money to the guys who had graduated. Not a\nlot of money but I got nine of these guys that I spent -- I gave $200,000 away. Well, and\nwhat about mothers. As I started taking care of my mother I would drive up there twice a\nmonth and I would pay the help and I would do the shopping for her. And you know, and\nshe said to me, \"I have to redo my will.\" I said, \"Okay.\" And she said, now the problem\nis you know Liz is on welfare, you know, and on Social Security. And they tell me that\nshe's not going to -- that that might affect the will.\" I said, \"You're damn right. Any\nmoney you leave her the State of New York will take for welfare. | You have to pay\nback the state before she gets the money.\" \"Well, that's not fair.\" I said -- she said, \"Well,\nthen we have -- I want to give money to my grandchildren. She has two daughters and\nyou have three children.\" I said, \"Mom, just skip the generation.\" \"Well, I can't do\nthat.\" I said, \"I don't need your money. I don't have the money but I don't need your\nmoney. I already running your business anyhow. You got money. I'm representing\nyou in all the family affairs and I don't get paid for it. Skip a generation.\" \"Oh, that can't\nbe done.\" My idiot uncle who is an engineer says, \"Oh, you can't do that.\" I said, \"Talk\nto your attorney.\" So they get an attorney. They get a $3,000 bill that say, yeah, of\ncourse you can do that. The guy thought about it for nine minutes. They said, \"He doesn't\nknow what he's talking about.\" They get another attorney and they spend $4,000. Says,\n\"Yeah, of course you can do that. I'll write the will.\" So now the will gets -- and thedeal is skip a generation, the money gets split between the five grandchildren. And\namong them -- among not between. And I'm the executor which 1s legal. I get a call from\nmy uncle. He says, \"That's an unfair will.\" \"What are you talking about?\" He said, \"You\nknow, it was 50/50. Your three children were going to split 50 percent of grandma's\nmoney. My mother's money. And your sister's kids were going to get -- now they would\nhave gotten 25 percent each. Now they are really getting 20 percent and your children\nshould have gotten 60 now they are getting 20. That's not fair.\" And I said a verb and\npronoun you know what I mean. And I said, \"You know, 25 percent of nothing is\nnothing. 20 percent of million plus is something.\" And each one of the kids got almost\n$300,000 by the time I finished, you know, over the years and I distributed it. And so I\nfeel very good about that. And I don't mind, you know, it was better for them. I mean\nthey were able to use it. And Mike bought a vineyard and Susan bought a house, and you\nknow, everybody did well. And but that's the family this, this spoiled bunch of -- my\ngrandfather and my grandmother were really sharp but they raised three of the most\nspoiled brats in the history of the world, you know. I love my uncle because he was a\nmechanical engineer genius and he died just two years ago. Great. He was a good man.\nWe were friends. But as far as -- I said to him, \"Are you going to go for the Holocaust\nmoney?\" And he said, \"I'm not a Holocaust survivor.\" I said, \"Walter, where were you in\n19392\" He said, \"I was a student at RPI.\" I said, \"Where were you living?\" He said, \"I\nwas a Student living in United States going to Polytech.\" I said, \"Were you able to get\nback?\" He said, \"Oh, no. I couldn't get back.\" I said, \"Guess what, you were a refugee.\"\n\"Oh, you think so. Well, I don't need the money.\" I said, \"Okay. Let me fill it out foryou. You know, fill out the information. I'll ask you questions and we will submit it.\"\nAnd he said, \"If you get me money, you can have it.\" Then a year later I called him up\nand I said, \"Where's my check?\" He said, \"What check?\" I said, \"You got a check for\n$26,000 and you told me I could have it.\" \"Well, I will buy you dinner.\" And I said, \"I'm\ngoing to find a place where dinner is $26,000 because you own me money.\" No -- well\nno. I said, \"Don't worry about it.\" So the next sequence came and they didn't fill it out\nagain. This time they lost a lot of money because now they started -- here's an interesting,\nthe last preparations came in, you know -- and you know, we had the apartment and the\nworld but I remember my father sold the family business so they couldn't have that many\nassets left because they had been paid -- the money had been come out of in 60s. Sol\ngot my final and they said, you know, it's so many -- you people live so -- basically it's\nyou people life so damn long. There is so many of you remaining, we don't have a lot --\nwe can only pay ten cents on the dollar. Here's what you're worth and we're going to pay\nyou a three-fifth. So remember your sister gets, your sister's family gets one half of the\nestate but since they didn't apply for it nobody gets it unless you're willing, you know,\nunless you're willing to let them get paid through you and you will agree to pay them\nwhich I did. And they left a lot of money on the table. Now you are going to get -- you\nare going to get documents that I'm getting you. And among the documents I found this\nlist because I'm pretty good about the computer and the internet. And there was a listing.\nAnd here was my father and there were open insurance policies. I said that can't be my\nfather; he didn't believe in insurance. But I wrote them a letter. And it was a Italian\ncompany, department. And I said, \"My dad died. Here's the death certificate. My motherdied. Here's her death certificate. My sister died, here's her death certificate. I have no\nidea what this is but the birthday is correct and asked peck (ph) is correct. Do I have any\nmoney coming?\" About a month later I get this package and it looked like it been went\nthrough a washing machine. And there is stamps all over it; Italian stamps. And it's from\nthem and it's a package. And they said, \"Yes. You are -- thank you very much. We have\ncertified that you're the sole beneficiary because of the fact that we have the death\ncertificate. Your father took out a $2,000 -- now he took out a $200 annuity for 20 years\nwould have have paid in '49. And the Nazi party cashed it in in '39. Therefore since that's\nan invalid cash in, it would have been 4,200 some odd dollars. Since it's an invalid cash\nin, We are going to pay as if you had never done it, we would like to know where to sent\n$137,000. And I read it again. And I said, \"We're going to buy a nice car, Betty.\" You\nknow because the best revenge is living well. You know, and I got -- so my bank that I\nused to print for calls me up and says, \"Mr. Halpern we just got a deposit into your\naccount.\" I said, \"Really.\" They said, \"Yeah. You want to leave it in your checking\naccount?\" I said, \"Five figures?\" They said, \"No, it's six figures.\" I said, \"Okay. I'll be\ndown there. We are going to deal with it but just put 1t over into a money market\naccount until I get there.\" But that was, you know, and that was my dad and he had done\nthat for one reason: Because my grandfather believed in insurance. Now I will tell you\nif my father had a $200 account, my grandfather's account was in those papers. His name\nwas listed too. They never followed up on it. Now if my father had $200, you know how\nmuch -- my grandfather had a policy with Anchor. Anchor was a British company\nUncore I think but they paid too. If my grandfather had -- if my father had $200, thenmy grandfather must have had $2,000. Because my grandfather -- my father would never\nhave bought that policy if my grandfather hadn't said it was a good idea.",
        "Q: Now speaking about family funds, I would like to get back to the incident you\ndescribed in the restaurant where your dad was speaking with man who he recognize. Do\nyou know who those people were who were living in your apartment?",
        "A: Nope.",
        "Q: What happened to your apartment like \u2014",
        "A: Well, the building got bombed out.",
        "Q: It's a different building now?",
        "A: It's completely -- it's a totally different building now. It was the corner building onto to\nwhere you stepped out. But no that's -- I don't know what happened. It's just a great story\nbecause my father, my father was that kind of a man. Quick one on my father that that I\nheard from my mother and she -- her attitude was different. Where my mother went in\n1950 the first time she was went -- she was going to come live with him in Germany and\nyou got the Ponseon and they always traveled by the Queen Elizabeth and they played\nbridge all the way across the ocean and back. And you had stop in Paris to get a gray card\nso you can go behind the Iron Curtain. And at that time the Cold War was going on.\nAnd my father said to my mother, \"We're going to get on this train. And we have a\ncompartment, you know, semi-private compartment. And the Russians are going to come\non board and they are going to ask you. You don't say a word. Not a word. I'll talk to\nthem.\" You got to remember he's really mild mannered. He says, \"You can't say\nanything.\" And you know, if you know that the Russians occupied Austria with theirMongrel troops. Vienna was occupied by the Mongrels because the Russians knew that if\nthey sent their sophisticated troops in possession was unbelievably high so they sent in\nthe guys that slaughtered chickens -- I mean they really were the murders. You're a\nRussian but you understand what I'm saying?",
        "Q: Yeah, I know about Mongrels.",
        "A: The Mongrels troops were the ones that they sent and they were tough. So my mom\nand dad, the train starts and it gets to the border. And into their compartment come two\nSoviet soldiers. And my dad -- and they are carrying Stems over their shoulder. And he\nsays -- when the soldier says to my father, \"Passport.\" International world. My father\ntakes out these two -- in those days the American passport was green with this enormous\neagle on it. The American eagle. And this guy looks at him and he says, \"Americanee.\"\nAnd my father says -- and he takes the passport and he opens it and he does this, you\nknow, next to his face. And then he goes to my mother and she flinches and does that\nnext to her face. He closes it and he hands it to my father and he hands it to my father and\nhe leans over my father and he spits between my father's legs. (Noise.) He hands him the\npassport and father says, \"Thank you.\"",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: '60, '61. And he says -- no, no. Excuse me, '50, '51. Excuse me, but this '50 or '51.\nBecause my mother went in '50. So it had to be '50. And he -- my father says, \"Thank\nyou.\" And this Russian looks at him and he says, \"Sacebo\". (Ph). My father says, \"Thank\nyou.\" He says, \"You sir, Sacebo.\"My father said, \"I am an American. Thank you.\" And\nthe guy took the sten off. Never pointed it at him. Took the sten off his helmet and said,\"Sacebo.\" And just then an officer comes to the door and he says in Russian, \"What the\nhell is going on?\" We got all this -- you guys are wasting time here.\" My father leans\naround this soldier and in perfect Russian says to him, \"This expletive deleted, expletive\ndeleted is trying to teach me a language that was my mother tongue before he was just an\nidea in his father's mind.\" You know, really course. And he said, \"He wants me to speak\na language that I knew. I will not. Iam an American. I will speak my language. The\nlanguage of, of the country.\" And he said -- and he sat there. And the soldier is still\nholding the passports. The officer went over and he took the passports out he said\nsomething. They left the compartment. And the officer walked up to my father, handed\nhim the passport and said, \"Thank you.\" Which is a great story. You know, but my\nmother said, \"You father's insane. Your father is insane. He could have gotten me killed.\"\nThat's my mother. And I said, \"No, if you had died you would have died a hero,\" because\nthat's magnificent. That was my dad. You know, I mean he was a real quiet man and I\nwish I had known him better. And to tell you the truth when I go up to the family plot, I\ntalk to my father. They're buried in Mont Hepburn in Fleshing, New York. I go up there\nonce a year. But that's -- so money wise I don't know. I do not know what happened. I\nknow the apartment was demolished. I know that went to visit the factory in\nGupendolfush Dausen (ph). On our way out back to Vienna we stopped. It's in the Fifth\nDistrict. And I went -- I vaguely remember that you had to open -- it was a bunch of\nbuildings on a narrow street but you had to open a gate. There was a courtyard for the\nfactory. And it's still there but it's a music studio and graphic design. Once again there we\ngo again. But I -- I don't feel any smertz for loss because I'm an American. I mean Icame so early. I love baseball. I played college soccer but I played. I'm an American.\nI'm sportswriter. I can be couth, uncouth. You know, but I am, I like who I am. I'm -- not\neverybody likes me but I am who I am.",
        "Q: Did you speak German in your family or English?",
        "A: No, we -- well my mother wanted to speak to my father, they knew the German we\nunderstood it. We didn't speak German at home. But they were would talk French. No\nmy father -- typically my mother. My mother spoke a lot of languages. My father speaks\nabout twelve. From business he spoke Czech, Croatia, Slovenian, Russian, Hebrew. But\nmother would speak in a language in which he was uncomfortable -- he was not\ncomfortable in French. He could speak it.But he was like a student. My mother spoke\nperfect French because she learned it. You know, but pretty soon we caught on.\nAnd my sister and I both took French from, you know, we knew what they were talking\nabout. Then they switched to Czech a little bit. But no, no, but my mother, of course,\nspoke German with her friends. And I just wanted to slap her silly. Because come on,\nmom, everybody speaks English. I know you speak English. I know she speaks English\nbecause I speak English to her. And she is just -- she was just a little bit different. But\nyeah, we can't speak -- like I say, my vocabulary came out of nowhere. Like I said, what\nfive-year-old child knows the word was asqacitnine (ph). You know, and I would pick up\nexpressions from my mother. She called delicatessen the Malour (ph) shop because it's,\nyou know, I use that expression. I guess I learned some things from my mother. Snobbish\nthings. But no, she would do life totally -- to somebody who spent two years in the prisonwhen from the Nazis to be totally unaffected. Literally unaffected by it. Ask me who her\nfavorite composer is? Wagner.",
        "Q: Did she know about Wagner being --",
        "A: Of course. My mother went -- they live in Forest Hills. When my dad died her friends\nwouldn't come play bridge on the subway so she moved to Lincoln -- to one Lincoln\nCenter so she could walk and always had one ticket available. She used to go three or\nfour times a week to the opera. They would hold the ticket at the box office. And they\nalways had one ticket for her. And she would sit through the entire -- she would sit\nthrough every single one of these one of those and they would do this marathon. They\nwould do them like in five nights and my mother would go every night. And it's like\neating a mattress. It's good God. There some nice but it's really heavy, heavy, heavy\nheart. So she bought this membership. And she always got five tickets for two for five.\nShe always had a ticket. She would get five operas and she would also be able to pick\nthree good ones and always Wagner. And it always give you -- like you know when you\nbuy baseball seats, you get the teams you don't want to see but you have to buy that\nticket. And she said to us, \"I have these tickets to the Opera. Why don't you come and\nhave dinner and then you can go to the opera because I have these very nice seats.\"I said,\n\"That's nice of you, mom.\" I like opera but my wife -- Cleveland, Ohio. And she said -- I\nsaid, \"What's the opera?\" She said, \"Hazel and Gretel.\" And I said, \"Thanks, mom.\" I\nhope -- \"Will there be a translation so I can follow this story?\" That was my mom.",
        "Q: Well, we have to interrupt for changing tracks here.\nEnd of File Two\nBeginning File Three",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Interview\nwith Paul Felix Halpern conducted by Juliet Eninina (ph) on October 17th of 2010 at\nthe Kindertransport Association Conference in Arlington, Virginia. Let's continue.",
        "A: It is -- it was -- Levi Eshkol had just died. And when we visited the cemetery, they\nhad just -- it was the last day of Shiva, and they had opened the grave up for -- you know,\nthat people could go by there. And so that's the timing. I just figure out a week after\nLevi Eshkol died, that's when I was there with my wife on that trip. And I loved\neverything, and I felt very -- and my wife said, This is the most amazing place in the\nworld. That garbage man over there is a Jew, and that mailman is a Jew, and that guy in\nthat barber shop giving a haircut is a Jew. And, you know -- and they'll talk about the\nrich Jews, and everybody is a brother here, and it isn't -- it's -- it's classless. I mean, there\nare classes but within -- and it -- it makes a lie out of the rich Jew. And she says, I'm not\na rich Jew. I was a poor Russian, you know, and I -- you know, and they told me I killed\nChrist, you know. And -- but she was very -- she loved Israel. We thought it was -- and\nwe walked. There was no tram. We walked up on the -- the -- the Masada. We walked.\nWe walked up there. And, of course, to me, the military aspect of it is tremendous. You\nknow, that's where the Tank Corps gets sworn in. And I tried to get -- give my military\nguys -- I says, You don't understand. Never again means never again. And it's -- if -- and\nthey said, Well, you know, we're not -- we're gonna neglect Israel. I says, You're out of\nyour mind. Israel goes down, they will take the rest of the world down with them,\nbecause never again means never again. They're not going down without a fight. And ifthe fight is nuclear, they're gonna go nuclear and the world will die because of that, so it\nbehooves every country in the world to make sure that Israel continues to exist because of\nthe fact that these are tough, tough people who are not going down. Now, I'm not as\nhonest. I -- I believe land for peace, but that's my opinion. And I had no right to tell\nthem what to do, and I feel very strongly about that. And what's interesting 1s, I -- I had\nthe -- like I say, I had this -- my father's cousin. Her name was Betty Rubenstein (ph) and\nher kids were soverest (ph), and she and her husband came in the thirties through the\nPalestine. And they were very well-established, and they had friends in high places. And\none of her friends was a woman named Tao Rath (ph) who was the pearl (ph) muster, the\nsocial -- unofficial social secretary. When Bernstein would come to -- he would stay with\nTao. And we had a lot of time because, in between peace missions, you know, when --\nthe Secret Service would be at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, and they'd say,\nHenry's going to bed. You guys are off duty. Check in again in the morning. Because\nwe flew the limousine back and forth. And I get a call from this lady, and she says to me,\nHi, I'm Betty's -- Betty Rubenstein's friend, Tao Rath. And I didn't know who that was.\nShe said, Do you like music? I said, I love music. She says, You know, the Israeli\nPhilharmonic is playing tonight. I said, Yeah, but it's like the -- like the tickets to the\nBoston Red Sox. You have to -- have to know somebody who dies so you can get their\ntickets. She said, Ooh, would you like to go? And I said, I would love to go. And she\nsaid, Do you have a jacket? And I said, Yes, I have a jacket. I had a blazer, because we\nflew civilian clothes. And she said -- and she said, The address is so and so. I said, I\nknow where it is. I can get there. I'll take a cab. And we were staying downtown -- wewere staying out by the airport, as a matter of fact. I said, I can get there. And I'm\nstanding there, and she said, Meet me at the musician's entrance. And this limousine\npulls up and this driver gets out and he opens the door and this woman about that big --\nmy mother's small. This woman is that small. And she gets out, and she is the most\ncharming woman in the world. And she says, We're running late. Come in. She knocks\non the door, and the door opens up and the guard says, Ah, Mrs. Rafal (ph) Rath, how are\nyou? Hello, Henry. How are you? And she shakes his hand, and we walk across the\nstage -- and the orchestra's tuning up. We walk across the stage, we walk down into the\naudience and Krivitsky was conducting and playing. He actually was gonna play. And\nhe's magnificent. And we walk, and she's shaking hands with people, and she says,\nWhere's George? Oh, George is not here tonight. He couldn't make it. Okay, this is my\nfriend Paul. He's with Dr. Kissinger. He's gonna sit here. And I said, Where are you\ngonna sit? She says, Ooh -- and I look and she's sitting on the steps with friends. And\nthe first act is -- you know, he -- he's playing, and it's marvel -- he's a real -- he was\nfantastic in typical Russian with -- with the flowing hair. And she says, Come buy me a\ndrink, you know? Then she says, Do you have any Israeli money? And I said, Yeah, I\ngot shekels, you know? And we stand there, and people come around her because she\nis -- and because I'm with her, people are talking to me. And we -- we finish, and we go\nback to -- back to our seats and we finish the concert, and she says, Would you like to\nmeet the maestro? I said, I'd love to. And we go to the Arturo Toscanini room, which is\nthe VIP lounge, back of the hall, and she walks in and Krivitsky puts down his glass,\nwalks across, kisses her hand and says, Tao, my darling, how are you? And she said --she says, I'm wonderful. This is my friend, Paul. He's with Dr. Kissinger. And, of\ncourse, he doesn't shake hands with anybody. His hands are his gold. And he said, Nice\nto meet you. I said, Thank you so much, Maestro. It was marvelous, you know? I know\nhow to talk. And he looked at me like Americans that do that, and he said, You're\nwelcome. And that was the first time. So we went to see two concerts. One was with\nthe American -- the one that conducted the Washington National, the black who was\nparalyzed, and he was marvelous, too. One day she says, Are you free for dinner\ntomorrow? And I said, I'll call you. And I'd gone out to where she lived one day, and she\nsaid, Betty -- I want to take you and Betty to dinner. And she fixed me up at the hotel\nand Betty's in the car with Dr. Rubenstein, and we go driving out into the mountains \u2014\nobviously, you know -- you know Tel Aviv and that area -- and there's an enclave up\nthere where most of the official -- government officials live. Very highly secure. And\nwe get to the gate, and she says, Do you have an identification card? And I said, Of\ncourse. And we get to the gate, and this real hard-ass Israeli soldier at the gate, and he\nsees the limo, so a little bit of respect, and he leans in the back window and he says, Good\nevening, Mrs. Rath. And she says, How are you? And she knows his name. And he\nsays, I'm just checking the names. And he -- you know, Dr. Rubenstein, Captain Halpern\n-- or Major Halpern? And I said, Yes, lam. And we drive, and she says, Diane lives\nover here and so and so lives over here, and this is where -- and we drive up, and we're\ngoing to a dinner party at a Minister of Finance's house. And the door opens up, and I'm\nwearing a jacket. Everybody else is in evening culottes (ph). And there are Sehgals on\nthe wall and there's a Picasso on the wall, and they're not -- they're not copies. And she --this charming woman, she says, Darling, this 1s my friend Paul. He's with Dr. Kissinger.\nAnd she says to me, How's your -- how's your Hebrew? And I said, Nonexistent. And\nshe says -- I said, I speak a little -- I speak a little French. And she looks at me like\nphooey, you know. And she says, Just a moment. And she turns around and she says,\nLadies and gentlemen, in deference to our guest, English only, please. And the rest of the\nevening nobody spoke anything but English. And there was a cocktail party. There was\neverything. So Isit down. There's a very erect gentleman sitting next to me over here.\nThere are very erect gentlemen sitting over here. Absolutely military, no argument about\nit, sitting in close. And, remember, I am just the navigator for the airplane that carries\nKissinger's cars, but I'd been to Syria. I just came out of Damascus. And we start a\nconversation. And finally I said, Navy or Air Force? And he said, Army. And the other\nguy says, Navy. And I said, Gentlemen, I'm just a poor navigator, you know? I said, I\nam an information officer, as you know, and you know that I've talked to your people at -\n- at the airport. I've talked to your people, but there's nothing I can help you with, but I\nam honored that you would think that a poorly major -- you know. And they -- they had\njust decided to put two people next to me that wanted to talk about -- and I knew nothing\nabout Dr. Kissinger, except that he couldn't get it done. He was under a lot of pressure to\nget it done. His best friend, Joseph Alsop, died and he was supposed to be a pallbearer,\nand he wasn't allowed to come back. He had to get that peace mission. So he missed his\nbest friend's funeral because of that. But it was quite an experience. And Israel's seen as\na military man. And then I flew the Israeli airlift. I flewthe |= Yom Kippur War, and\nwe flew -- this is when our own country was told by our allies if we had trouble -- we\nflew out of the Azores, nonstop with a double crew carrying equipment to Tel Aviv, to\nLod. Lod. Ben Gurion. And we were told, in case of emergency, we could not land in\nSpain or France or anywhere. And they put their ranger, which is an American aircraft\ncarrier, in the middle of the Mediterranean, and that was out, and they said -- so the\nquestion was: Do you -- are you gonna control us? What if we need to land? Put it in\nthe Mediterranean. And we said, This airplane swims like a stone. So every one of us\nsaid, If we're in trouble, the first time that the French are gonna know that we're on their\nrunways 1s when we land. We're just gonna put it down. We could see Italian and\nFrench bases coming down the Mediterranean. We were gonna land. So we were\ncoming this way, and Aeroflot, the Soviets, were coming this way, and they were going\nto -- they were going to Egypt and we were going this way, and they were coming in.\nAnd, you know, English is the language of the -- of international air, and these Russian\npilots had terrible command of the English language. And they would call Cypress and\nthey would say, Cypress Control, this is -- this is Aeroflot so and so, and Cypress would\nstart to talk to them, and we'd hid our microphones and just block out -- block out that\ntransmission. And we drove them crazy. And finally, Cypress Control said, Military\naircraft in the vicinity of such and such a position, stop your transmissions. Because they\nknew we were doing that, you know, because we were just flying. It was -- and we got to\n-- we got to -- we got to -- you know, where Egypt -- Israel, and the Mirages came up for\nus and the migs came up for the -- and we could see each other. And we just landed.\nAnd they turned us around. You know, they turned us around immediately. And they\nhad taken all the first class seats out of the -- out of the LR Air-Cranes (ph) and all thestewardesses, and so we were crew members, and I said, Just leave us your loadmaster\nand you guys -- and we'd like to get something to eat. And we had fresh orange juice and\nthis and that. You know, we had a -- we had a wonderful time. And they knew more\nabout our airplanes, how to load our 141s, than our people did. And within two hours, all\nour flight plans were filed for us, all the weights and measurements were done, you\nknow, our pilots had signed off. And we knew how to get home, you know;\nMediterranean, head east, head west. And I did -- the total mission was like 20 hours\neach time, and we would drop things off and we would pick things up and bring them\nback to the Azores. And the lead commander of the Israeli Yom Kipper War airlift was a\ncolonel who was the deputy commander at my base, and I was a speech writer besides\nbeing a navigator, and his name was Wrigley. Like Wrigley -- Wrigley like W-r-i-g-l-e-\ny. He was a full colonel and he knew me because I used to write speeches for he and the\ngeneral. And we had a Jewish pilot. We -- you know, military airlift command, you\ndon't fly set crews. You just -- two pilots, two navi -- you know. And he came to me,\nand he says -- his name is Steve Tirshen (ph) -- and Steve said, You know, we could\nmake an all-Jewish crew. Do you think we could get the first crew into Tel Aviv? And I\nwent to Colonel Wrigley, and I said to him, Steve Tirshen -- and Bob Rowe's (ph) the\nnavigator and he's got a Jewish copilot and he can get a Jewish navigator. Bob was a\nnavigator who I knew for years. They want to be the number one aircraft. And Wrigley\nsaid, Okay. Just like that. And he was a -- he was a -- he was an Ekta (ph) goy, you\nknow. He -- and he -- so they put this airplane at number one air plan on this Erma and\nwas gonna be this all-Jewish crew. And I remember the pilot's name. His name wasSteve Tirshen. And they took off and they lost an engine. And they had to dump -- they\nhad to dump out over the Mediterranean -- over the -- over the Azores, South Atlantic,\nand make a turn and come back in again, and Wrigley went to number five in -- in line.\nNumber two and three were ready to go and number five was just getting ready. He put -\n- he -- he hopped in the truck and he said to the crew, Take number five. And he let them\n-- he couldn't give them the number one, but he gave them the first open air plan, which I\nthought was, you know, a real nice touch for a military man, you know. I was number\nfour crewman, and I flew with a bunch of -- a bunch of goys. But we went in and we --\nthe first time, and it -- and then we had 12 hours on the ground. We were two crews.\nAnd we were coming down the Mediterranean, and the Ranger said to us, You've got\ncompany. And we look up and there are two Algerian migs sitting on our wing. And\nthey're -- they're flying real close to us, and they're going like this, and \u201cblah,\u201d you know,\nand all we do is we take -- we always have a camera, and we were just taking pictures\nand -- you know, the official -- and they were fully voiced, and the Ranger said, You\nguys want company? We said, We'd appreciate it. And we look up and there were two\nNavy F-4s appeared, and the -- look up and these F-4s are sitting directly above the two\nmigs. And the F-4s let down there, their props had slowly come down like this, and these\nguys are looking like this, and they're on our wing. And they finally got here and they\naccelerated and went on their way. And the Ranger said, I think they've left. We said,\nYeah. Thank you very much for the help. And he did -- great stories that are -- never get\ntold. You know, I don't know if I'm -- I'm not breaking protocol because I'm not telling\nyou any of the procedures, but it was -- it made me feel like a good Jew. You know, it --it -- and I -- I was gone about 10 days, and on the last day they said, Who -- who's -- and\nthey -- some of us were rotating out, and they brought us -- there -- I must have had 10\ndozen baby roses, just -- and we flew home -- flew -- flew to Lajes where we were flying\nout of, the Azores, and I kept those in the -- in the flight kitchen. And 12 hours later, we\nflew home. And I got home at 4:00 in the morning. 4:00 in the morning. And I filled the\nsink, and the roses were still tight, and I dropped the roses in the sink to let them soak all\nnight, and I went to bed. And two days later, I'm -- I'm -- I'm at synagogue. It was one of\nthe holidays. It was Yom Kip -- it was -- it was Yom Kippur. The Yom Kippur War --\nit was right after Yom Kippur, and it must have been Sukkot, because my -- my -- my\nwife's yossi (ph) is Sukkot. And the rabbi's talking about how we must help because he\nhears things are terrible, you know, and I'm sitting in the back -- I've been there. I just\ncame back. I just came back from there, and I can't say anything about it, you know.\nCan't say anything about it at all. But that's what good Jews -- it was great.",
        "Q: I'm sorry.",
        "A: Again, all that has more religious and efficous (ph) than it did as before. It was -- like\nI say, when I lecture, I lecture. When I give talks, I talk about a five-year-old, a\nsix-year-old child and its impressions of -- of the Nazis and -- you know, and how it's --\nyou know, that's -- that's different than --\nPause in Proceedings",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with Paul\nFelix Halpern conducted by Juliet Eninina (ph) on October 17th of 2010 at theKindertransport Association Conference in Arlington, Virginia. So we were talking\nabout --",
        "A: The significance --",
        "Q: -- the significance of your experience as a Kindertransport child --",
        "A: I said it was -- I said it was -- it is my life, because I -- the Kindertransport saved my\nlife. I know that. But it -- it didn't affect me as a Jew. The older I get and the more\nintrospective I get and the fact that most of my -- my kids, they all were bar mitzvahed\nbut they're -- they're assimilated Jews more than anything else, and they -- I -- I've\nbecome more and more introspective about it. And I'm still -- because I lost my wife, I'm\nnot much of a -- I'm not much of a churchgoer, you know? But at the same time,\nethnically, I'm a very strong Jew, and I feel -- I feel very close -- close to what's going on.\nAnd I think that probably I -- I could probably do the Holocaust Museum -- I could do the\nmuseum. I hadn't been there. I've been to the one in Richmond because my son does a\nlot of work with them, but we'll probably give it a shot. I may -- I'll go there. I'm slowly\ncoming to -- to terms with it. You know, I'm 78 -- I'm gonna be 78 years old. I don't feel\nlike it, but -- so I always kid with this -- this lady I go out with now, and I always say,\nYou know, 20 years from now we're gonna -- and she says, Well, I may be here, you\nknow, because she's only 70. But I'm not looking to make a mark. I just -- I just want to\nunderstand more. And I'm getting there. I don't do a lot of reading about it because the\npeople who were there were too young to really understand. I didn't go -- you know, I --\nI talked to people who were -- who were in Auschwitz and who came out and some of my\nfriends are survivors who hidden -- who hid and were shot and things like this, and thepeople -- they were all young people, and young people don't think like us old people. In\nretrospect, I'm beginning to understand more. And you -- see, you have the advantage of\nwatching me have this experience, and -- but if you were experiencing it right now, 50\nyears from now it's gonna be a different thing because you're gonna say is, Oh, that's\nwhat scarred me; Oh, that's why I'm affected. And all these little crazy things like\nknowing -- having had a friend who ate paper, but yet that was a manifestation of a child\nneeding attention, a Jewish kid away from home, but I didn't think about it like that. My\nfriend, Wolf (ph), ate paper, you know? I flushed my teddy bear down the toilet, you\nknow? I'm just saying, Hey, somebody look over here, you know? But you don't know\nthat as it's going on. You do things and then why did you do it? But it makes life a lot of\nfun. And, look, I'm a journalist and I -- I'm published. I've -- I've written articles and I've\nwritten -- you know, but at the same time, I cannot sit down and write this stuff down.\nAnd I've told you a lot of stuff. Like this story about my father and the passports, it's a\nmagnificent story. Any Jewish newspaper, if I write it well, would pick it up.",
        "Q: Why do you think you can't write it down?",
        "A: I don't have the right words for it. I don't have the right respect for it. And I'm good.\nI mean, I can -- I can write. I was a journalist. I'm a sports writer. I can write features.\nYou know why? I've become too close to it. You tell me -- you could -- you told me that\nstory, I could write it, like you probably could write this, too. It's just not -- and even\nthough I'm a gadgeteer, you know, and I have full command of computers and I have full\ncommand of digital, I have upstairs a Sony tape recorder, which I was gonna take withme to listen, because -- but it's electronic and I can't do electronic. I'm a typewriter guy,\nyou know\u201d?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: And even on the computer. I have trouble on the computer because it's too easy. And,\nyou know, I -- I now have -- I just bought Nuance. I bought voice so I can -- I -- it can\ntype, and I find myself reading and saying, That's not how you spell that, instead of\nsaying, Just get it done. And I have troubles. I have started five or six recollections\nabout my father and about my -- my -- can't finish them. Because the people I lecture to\non -- and I haven't done it in about three years because I was busy with my wife. They\nwant to hear a five year old. They want to hear the story that a five year old -- from a\nfive-year-old aspect that -- they want to hear the fact that I remember riding my bicycle,\nthat I was so -- not that I was so affluent that I -- I could ride my bicycle in the dining\nroom, but the fact that I was a kid and this is how Holocaust affected me originally was I\nrode my bicycle around and I -- I -- I had a good father. It was cold one night and we still\nhad our nanny, and in our -- my sister and I had a room and there was a potbelly stove in\nthe room, you know? It was just as a convenience. And my -- and my nanny lit a fire\nand burned up about $50,000 worth of money that my father had put away for emergency\nescape funds. You know, those -- but the -- but when I tell that story to people, they say,\nWell, that's a lot of -- it's entertaining. The Holocaust was not entertaining, even though I\ntell it that way. And I tell my grandkids, Dying hurts and there's no rerun from it, you\nknow? You know, bang, bang, bang, you're dead, and this and that, and they shoot -- all\nthe shoot 'em up games and, yeah, but if you come away from this game with the aspectthat you can do something really reckless and once that game is over you can go back and\ndo it -- undo it, you can't do it. You get a shot -- you know, particularly -- I tell a joke,\nWatch yourself when you fly. I said, Dying hurts. And -- you know, and I -- not that I --\nI've been told. Nobody has come back to tell me, but I know it does. And, Just be\ncareful. And -- but that's not how life lives. The bottom line is: Be careful. Be careful.\nBut we weren't careful. And, you know, kids today -- if I tried to thrust one of my kids\non the train, he would probably pop me one. But we went because mom said we -- you\nknow, mom and dad took me to the -- took me to the -- and Oma took me to the train. It's\na different world. It's a different world.",
        "Q: Did you tell your story to your children and grandchildren?",
        "A: My kids know it. My kids know it. I made them -- I -- I was principal speaker at --\nmy synagogue did a Holocaust Memorial Garden, and a couple of -- couple of state\nsenators were there and so on, and I gave this little speech. It was real funny. They told\nme -- asked me if I would do this, and I said, Okay. And I sat down to write the basic\nspeech, and I hadn't -- I hadn't done Kindertransport speeches yet. And I said, How much\ntime do I have? And they said, Oh, about five minutes. I said, Just forget it. I said, If\nyou're gonna -- just so that that -- that state senator can -- can babble on about how\nwonderful you people are -- he had an Irish name -- I'm not -- I'm not playing second\nfiddle. This is a memorial -- Holocaust memorial thing. If you don't want to hear it --\nWell, how much time you need? I said, I just ran it through. It's 30 minutes. Oh, that's\nway too long. I said, Okay. 20? They said, Okay. And I did 35 minutes, you know\u2019?\nBut I said to my kids, Do me a favor -- and they weren't a member of my synagogue --check me out. See how I'm doing, because I'm gonna be giving this talk at your schools\npretty soon. So -- and they said they love it. And 35 minutes is good because school\nsessions are 40 minutes, you know, so I could -- I -- I haven't done it lately, and -- but\nBetty and I did teach reading in Camden. She wanted to teach reading to adults. And\nthen, of course, when she -- when she had the stroke, she couldn't -- for transportation.\nSo we taught first grade and second grade reading. And when Betty -- and when Betty\ndied, we -- people said, What do we donate to? And we said, the Elizabeth Halpern\nReaders Fund. And we got a lot of money, and we went to that Puerto Rican school or\nHispanic school in Camden where we had taught reading, we said, What do you need?\nAnd every year we give them $500 worth of Readers Club books. And just the other day,\nI went back -- for Rosh Hashanah, I went back to Lionsgate. And we have this wonderful\nrabbi who was my rabbi when he came out of reconstruction school, and he has done this\nsiddur just for us, you know, abbreviated session, and he's really -- and the auxiliary had\ngiven him the money for it. But, you know, they're gonna need more and more. So |\nwent over and I said, I want to give you money for this. And I gave them a check -- I\nremember the people at that Lionsgate gave money to my wife's fund, the Readers Club,\nand I took -- just gave them $300 from the Elizabeth Halpern Readers Club to buy more\nsiddurs, because that's reading. That's reading. You know? That's not -- that's not what\nthe original intent was. I ran -- and I -- I funded -- I funded -- I bring it up to a thousand\ndollars every year, and it's only been two -- she's only been gone -- second anniversary.\nBut we came down and I took it up to a thousand, and I said to her -- I said, Let me give\nyou a couple hundred dollars and give me a check for $300 and I'll -- because that wayit's tax free for you, you know, and it's tax free for me. And I just thought it was a -- and\nshe -- he said, Well, it already says who -- I said, Who cares? You know, I just -- you\nknow, I like to do things like that.",
        "Q: Yeah. One second. I'll just pause and --",
        "A: I'm all -- if I want to sum it up, I -- Iam content. I am -- I don't want to die, but we all\ndo. That's too bad. I -- I hope -- I hope to continue on for -- you know, I -- I want to be\nshot by a jealous husband and during the act, you know? I mean, that's -- but \u2014 that's --\nthat's not gonna happen. But I feel very -- I'm -- I'm content. I look at -- I've got three\nproductive children. Two of them are married correctly. The other one is a good mother.\nThey all had bought into education. The name's gonna go on. And for that,\nKindertransport, my name is on because my sister's name is gone. I mean, you know, she\n-- her married name, but she's gone. But Halpern goes on because of my -- my nine\ngrandsons, six of them who -- three \u2014 yes, six of them have my name. The other -- the\nothers are -- so I feel that I've accomplished something. I mean, you know, nothing --\nnothing big deal, but without Kindertransport, I'm not here. I'm not a dedicated -- you\nknow, maybe I got too much of my mother in me. I -- I enjoy life, you know, a little bit.\nBut I get angry, and I get -- I get angry because Rwanda happens and I get angry when\nSarajevo happens, and I get overenthusiastic when Chile happens because, you know,\nthere is solution -- there are solutions to this stuff. I'm -- I just -- I just want -- I just want\nto be remembered my -- you know, Your grandpa was nuts, you know? You know, or\nmy kids -- I want my -- my grandkids to say, He was a nice guy. He was a friend. We\ncould have a beer together. Like I'm going to go have a beer with them at Founders --you know, Founding Fathers restaurant -- Founding Fathers. I didn't get what I'm -- I'm\nnot the greatest writer in the world, and -- but I guess -- I guess I did all right, and I guess\nI'm gonna do all right. I mean, I -- I --",

        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial interview of Paul Felix\nHalpern conducted by Juliet Danilian on October 17th of 2010 at the Kindertransport\nAssociation Conference in Arlington, Virginia. So I would like to get back to the time\nwhen you first came to the states. Do you remember your first impression like what were\nyour thoughts and what can you think about your experience in being in England and this\nHolocaust ordeal?",
        "Q: Only Opera?\nA: Let's not talk trains. You know, but so my claim to fame, the famous people I know\nare all, are all directors. All of them, all of them won Academy Awards. So it was a good\nlife. And then when my parents came, we moved. We got an apartment in the same\napartment house that my grandparents lived. So if I had enough of my mother I would go\nup and see, visit my grandmother. And my mother was totally oblivious but she did work\nhard. Let me put it this way here was this mom who used to -- my mother -- one year\nwhen she was young in Vienna I understand took a course in stringing pearls. What kind\nof a job is that? But my mother could string pearls. She couldn't cook but she could -- and\nshe was quite -- she was -- you probably gathered that I'm not that much of a fan of my\nmother's. I have a Galle Vase. Galle is really -- and it belonged to my mother. It was\ngiven to her by a gentleman who I met. Who was about 10 years older than my mother.\nAnd like she always used to talk about this guy and the la moor (ph). And I finally met\nhim in Switzerland and I know just in my heart that it had been more than a friendship.\nAnd so I have this Galle vase which is kind of irritating. It's beautiful. And it is out with\nthe antique, some of the antique dealers from the antique dealers, I'm trying to get a\ndecent estimate price for it to place it. I'm not going to pass that onto my, to my kids. But\nand I don't need the money. And what I will do with that money is that money I will --\neventually it will go in my estate, my three kids can have the money. I don't want to give\nanybody that vase. I just want to give them the money. And so I was up, I was up in\nLandenville, (ph) and they said, \"You have any provenance (ph) for this?\" \"I said,\n\"Yeah.This is a vase that my mother's boyfriend gave to her.\" And they said, \"Excuseme?\" I said, \"Yeah, don't ask.\" But we live a kind of strange life. I've always been this\nkind of a wacky person.",
        "Q: Well, your Holocaust experience sounds like one big adventure for you. Do you have\nlike some negative memories or were you realizing what was going on in Europe when\nyou enter the states?",
        "Q: Challenging.",
        "Q: Haitian.\nA: Yeah, it's horrific. Those are the problems that will not be solved -- because people\ndidn't like each other. But everybody likes a good story and those miners were a good\nstory and the world did their thing perfectly. I mean there was no flag because they all\nflew the Chilean flag and they made sure but it was done correctly. And that's -- if we\ncould solve the world's problems, if we can put the problems in a mine in Chili. And\nthat's the way I feel. You know, I kind of came to -- I was listening to this conversation\non a -- I don't particularly like a lot of the -- a lot of the Austrian Jews have quite a bit of\nthem because we didn't get reparations for a long time. They treated us like idiots.\nSo this lady from the Austrian deligation, the gentleman from Germany was fantastic.\nYou could ask him a question and he would think about it. And you know, \"Yeah, we\nwere wrong.\" You know, you are, you know, fourth generation. She said she started to\ntalk about all of the wonderful things that the Australian government, all of these\nprograms for the poor benefited Jews of Israel -- of Austria. And she went on and on and\non. And somebody said to her, \"How many Jews are left in Austria? How many Jews?\"\nShe said, \"Well, I could kind of go with 3,000. \"We are up to 15,000 but there are not the\n15,000, the Austrian Jews, the upper middle class society that held with the culture of\nVienna. It's Russian, Ukrainian, you know, Polish. And people hardworking labors\nbasically. It's one step down. And she said, \"15,000.\" And I was texting Shelly. And I\nsaid, \"This lady from Austria just tells me they have 15,000 --\" she said, there are 15,000\nJews left in Austria. She listed enough programs that every Jew could have one special\nproject because she kept talking about all of these people. There is only 15,000. They\ncouldn't do all of these things. This is all people wanting to play this \"Give game,\" youknow. And it's wrong. It's wrong. And I'm not -- I'm not a fan of the Austrians. I don't\nmind the Germans. I enjoyed, you know, at least you can, you know, that's the past.\nAustria is still in this to this day. I know that. I know that. And the Austrian -- I mean\nhere, you know, a lot of the people here from here from the Holocaust do not like their\nhome county and will not visit or visit and are very uncomfortable.",
        "Q: When did you visit for the first time after the war? After the Holocaust? When was it?",
        "Q: And your grandparents went?",
        "Q: And he died in the States?",
        "A: Yeah. He -- well, I told you he came and he said, \"I'm going to the United States,\" and\nhe played the game. And my grandmother lived to be 96. And marvelous woman.\nMarvelous woman. And the family they put her into a nursing home in Queens but a real\nnice one. I used to visit her.And she she would be -- she was 90. I would say, \"Why don't\nyou go?\" Those are old people. I don't go with old people.\" And she was the oldest\nperson there. And so at that time her son, my uncle Walter whom I love dearly, bought\nher a television set. And I understand every morning she read the large print edition of\nthe New York Times. I mean that's how good she was. And she watched television. She\nwatched sports and cartoons not because it moved. You know, when you get to be 90years old and you're bored and your language, that's not your primary language, sports is\neasy to watch and cartoons. So my uncle Walter tells a story that it was the finals of the\nNCAA Basketball Tournament between Michigan State and Magic Johnson. These are\npeople that you don't know but these are great athletes. And nine out the ten players on\nthe floor were black. And they are all big and they were running up and down in the\nsports shorts. And my grandmother is, he's kind of watching the game, you know, a little\nbit. And she says to him, \"Walter, what are they doing?\" He said, \"They are playing\nbasketball Mom.\" And she said, \"Oh.\" She watched for a while and she said, \"Which are\nthe Jewish boys?\" And they were nine, six foot, inch when they are going for that. You\nknow, but that's a fond memory. That's a fond memory. She was a wonderful woman.\nWonderful woman. I like, I dearly loved her. She loved us which was the interesting\nthing. And I have no idea where she spawned a spoiled brat of a child that was my\nmother. And who -- at 90 was a spoiled brat. She was entertaining and she, you know,\nand like I said, I told you I thought Betty White would play her in the movie. Bill Burke\nwould have played her in the movie. That's before your time. That was my mom. And\nbut my kids loved her because grandma was synonymous with presents. My wife on the\nother hand ran my kids a little bit better. My daughter had Aaron who was very bright\nand he was two years -- coming up on two. And she would say dada and she wouldn't say\nmomma. And she said, \"You know, mom --\" she my wife baby-sat for her one day\nbecause she was doing some work and her sitter was out. And she said, \"You know, that\nkind of hurts.\" She says -- they work for us. Her husband worked for us. She says, \"He\nwill says daddy. He won't say momma.\" So she went away. She came back about fourhours later. And Betty said to Aaron, \"Who is that?\" And Aaron said, \"Momma.\" And\nshe said, \"Who am I?\" She said, \"Momma.\" And she said, \"How did you do that?\" She\nsaid, \"Really stmple.We had lunch and I said, 'Do you want dessert?' She said, \"Yes.\" I\nsaid to him, if you want dessert say momma.\" He said momma. And later on she said,\n\"Do you want some candy? What, do you say?\" \"Momma.\" So within 30 minutes she\ntaught them how to say a word that my daughter had been working on for months.\nBut that's the difference between my wife and my mother, you know. My mother would\nbe the person that would talk about herself for hours and at the end of it, she would say,\n\"Well, that's enough about me. Let's talk about you. What do you think of me.\" I mean\nthat was the attitude that she had. And it was charming but at the same time after a while,\nyou know, it's, it's up here. And it's not, it's not deep. But I was five when I left. I was in\nsix -- well, five when she left me, you know, to go to prison. And I was always taken\ncare of by nannies and so on. So my bonding with my mother was never really a bond.\nAnd it was her problem; not mine. When we came back to the United States she was busy\n-- they were trying to make a living. My dad came back. But the minute they came back\ninto the situation where they -- where they could do well, it became her story again and\nnot mine. You got to remember she went back in 1940 -- 1950, she went back to Austria\nto spend six months out the year. I was 17, she left. I was a freshman in college and she\nleft. I got to be an anchor -- you know, at Ohio State. She could do that and never look\nback. And never look back on it. And there was no nanny for me. And I was a hard\ncase. I mean I was -- I know what I wanted which I had no idea what was it but I knew\nwhat I wanted that's why, \"He's a big boy.\"\nQ: What did your dad do when he came to the States?",

        "A: No. My mom was a debutante. My mother had season tickets at the opera. My\nmother was a dilettante. She -- she -- she went to the Cordon Bleu cooking school,\ncouldn't cook a lick. We -- she -- she enjoyed her life. She was a young -- she was a\nyoung woman who enjoyed her life, and made it all the more difficult later on in her life,\nbut -- and I didn't -- I was a spoiled kid and so was my sister. And we lived in an\napartment, if I remember correctly, it was 11 rooms. And our dining room was bigenough that we used to do -- my sister and I would race our tricycles and bicycles in the\ndining room. There was enough room to make turns. It was that big. So you -- you\nknow, those -- the big trouble when you're five and six years old, you don't\nremember -- you remember pieces. And riding my bicycle is more important than where\nI went to school, what I had to eat, you know, and those are things I remember.",
        "A: No. Absolutely not. What's interesting -- my father was the son of Ichivibulha (ph).\nYou know, he lived in Poland and he was like tevea (ph) without the milk route. He\nwas -- he was the village hebruscala (ph) basically, but, you know, you can't live on the\nchicken somebody brings you for advice. So his wife kept what would be now called the\n7-Eleven, you know. She had the local store, and people would come there, and he\nwould sit there and give out advice. I never knew either one because I'm named after my\ngrandfather and -- but they were smart enough that he was the oldest of six kids, and she\nsaid, Go to Austria. Get a business degree. Make enough money. Bring your brother\nout. When you bring your brother out, he goes to business school, gets a business degree.\nBring your other brother out and then your sister, and they all got out.

        "A: Once again -- once again, I'm thinking as a five-year-old, but I remember when\nDollfuss was assassinated. Dollfuss was a socialist minister who was against the\nAnschluss. And one day he was shot at a -- shot at a valley and the ambulance came\nthrough and said, We'll take him. And they loaded him in the ambulance. They found\nhim in the ambulance two days later dead when it was sun up. And it was politically very\ndifficult time. My father, I know for a fact about six or seven months before the\nAnschluss, one of his employees came in and he said, Mr. Halpern, I am a member of the\nAustrian Nazi Parties, National Socialist Party, and eventually, you know, it's just a\nmatter of time before we come here and we need friends. No Jewish questioned at all but\nwe need friends and we need -- and so it's how about a contribution now, and my father\nhad him thrown out, fired him and threw him out.",
        "A: Well, yes. Donation to the party to show good-will toward the party and when right\nafter the Anschluss, my dad came to work one day and he was sitting in his office and hesaid, You work for me now. And for a while my dad -- my dad did -- my dad did\ngo -- one of the good -- and then you know we -- we had a nanny, and we -- we used to\ngo to the park and then we couldn't go into the park so -- the nanny was Catholic and we\nwould walk around the park, and then we had to wear arm bands.",
        "A: And my nanny -- I was upset that my nanny didn't wear one because, oh, you know,\nI'm sorry. You can't have one of these arm bands, you know. If you were Jewish you\ncould wear one of these things, you know, and that summer we still went to camp in the\nAlps. We still went to camp in the Alps. I remember it was a vegetarian camp. It was\nawful. And I came down with appendicitis. Could not find a doctor in the -- in the area\nto treat me. So with a case of appendicitis, I went on the train back to Vienna, and they\nwouldn't take me. The hospital -- I know that from my mother. And then my appendix\nwas taken out by a Jewish doctor in his office. You know, and he had kind of an\noperating room, and that was the first time I suddenly realized that something was a little\nbit wrong. And my sister had to change schools, you know. She couldn't go to the\nschool, and -- but we lived in a building where -- mostly Christians. I -- I can't tell you,\nbut I know -- I know that. And in the fall of '38, our nanny was not allowed to work for\nus anymore. So now my debutante mother had to take us for walks and stuff. And my\nsister was at school, and my mother said to me, Let's go for a walk. And she looked at\nme. She said, Your shoe lace is untied. So she literally stood me up on the dining room\ntable. Okay. She was 4'11. She stood me up on the dining room table so she could tie\nmy shoes. And I'm standing there, she's tying my shoe, and the doorbell rings. And twogentlemen come in, and it was right out of a -- right out of a German movie. These two\nguys came in, and they had rain coats and snap-brim hats and the whole bit. And they\nsaid is -- is your husband here? And my mother said, No. He's -- and my mother was\none of these very nervous people. And she said, No. He's not here. They said, We need\nto look around. And my mother said, Okay. And so they walked in -- and I'm five years\nold and I'm toddling behind them. I'm -- and they went into my father's study which\nwas I remember it because it had green shades you know, in the old days instead of white\nshades there was a green shade. So the sunlight was always filtered and I remember\ndistinctly one of them walking to my father's desk, reaching into his coat, taking out his\ngun, and laying it on the floor under my father's desk. And then the other one went over\nand said, Oh, what's this? And he picked the gun up and he turned to my -- went to my\nmother and said, Is this yours? And my mother said, No. And he said, Well, you're\ngoing to have to come with us. And she said, Well, why? He said, Well, do you have\nsomebody who can take care of him? And so my mother went up and got one of\nthe -- one of the neighbors to take care of me 'till my grandmother could come and collect\nus. And that the last time I saw my mother and father 'till spring of 1941. And they went\nto the downtown Vienna prison, and I understand for the two years they were in the\ndowntown Vienna prison they saw each other one time in the exercise yard and never\ntalked. But you have to understand here is a woman who has had the best of everything\nand she's living in a wing with 200 women, one shower, no doors; one toilet, no doors.\nBut through this entire time, my former nanny used to come and collect her laundry and\ndo her laundry for her, you know, what little rags she had. And she -- it was just kind ofdifferent, you know. So we -- we went to -- we went to my grandmother's house and\nthat's -- if you're going to record this, this is -- my grandfather, right after the Auschwitz\nand the troops were in the street, went on a normal business trip to Switzerland. And\nabout three days later, my mother got -- my grandmother got a letter. And the letter said,\nBy the time you get this letter. I'm on my way to the United States. I am not coming\nback. They don't want you. They want me. So sometime in the next week they will\ncome and say to you, Where's your husband? And you show them this letter, and they're\ngoing to say, When is he coming back? And you're going to say, He's not coming back.\nJust show them the letter, and eventually they'll let you go because they don't want you.\nSign over anything they want, give them anything you want -- they want, and they'll let\nyou go -- because this is still early on. And that's exactly how it happened. And so,\nfinally, after about by the spring of '39, my grandmother's arranging for us to go into\nKindertransport, and they said, Just sign here. Give us the bill and then sign over and get\nout. And she said, Not until I put my kids -- my grandkids on the train. And they said,\nNo, you have to get out. She said, No. I'm not getting out until they get on the train.\nThat's how tough she was. And she was the only member of my family who was over\n5'6, you know. So she was the queen. She put us on the train, and she went to the United\nStates; and she joined her husband who was -- he had guts. I mean, he played -- he\nplayed with people's lives, but he -- he knew human nature. He knew that as long as they\ngot what they wanted they were going to -- and I went to England, and I remember\nthe -- I remember the train ride. And, you know, a little them -- them memories and I had\nmy father's brother was in London, and he had come to England with his wife, Auga (ph),as a domestic. They signed on as a couple, and Auga (ph) came over pregnant. So their\nson, Ralph, was born in England and was a British subject, and did very well. He is a\nLord of the British Emperor. His name is Sir Ralph Halpern, and he was chairman of the\nboard of Burton Industries, and he now lives in South Beach, and my -- my son and he\nare good friends. And I see them occasionally, and he was always a -- always a Brit and\nhe's always been a Brit. Calls me Dear Boy and he's six years younger than Iam. And\nit's kind of racy, and I -- he and I have a good time together. And -- and but there was\nnowhere we could stay in England -- we could stay with him in London. We'd stay a\ncouple of days, and then went down to Bunce Court and Dan (ph) Court\nto -- Kindertransport. They made an arrangement for the kids who did not have -- weren't\ngoing to be taken there by families. There was -- there were these estates out by Kent,\nand they brought in an educator from Berlin named Anna Essinger and who was the most\nmagnificent teacher. I was there 16 months, and I stayed in one school, and my sister\nstayed in the other school. And I can't tell you whether I was in Bunce Court or Dan\nCourt. I think I was in Bunce Court because it comes easier to my mind, but, you know,\nthe memories are strange. All I know is that I did a lot of schooling because I jumped\nlike three years when I came here immediately because they thought I was a poor refugee\nkid until I -- I told them -- they put me in the second grade. I could read. I could do\nmath. I -- I had a little bit of chemistry. I knew European History because that's what\nthat's what the regimen there was, and the -- they -- the -- the -- the bombings were pretty\nbad around that area because a lot of fighter bases were in that area, and we got sent to\nLondon and -- which is interesting because then the Brits started in London for sure. And\nthe Brits -- Britains decided to have their own Kindertransport and, they went and signed\nup 30,000 children to get them first to the countryside and then to the colonies Australia,\nSouth Africa, New Zealand, Halifax. And it was a little bit different. And from what I'd\nbeen read -- what I read -- it was part of the government in power at that time, and he said\nthis is a mistake because they have to go by boat. And the -- the Germans controlled the\nseas. And if we lose one boat, when the war is over, we will lose the election because\nthat will be an issue. And we were supposed to go in December of -- September 10th or\n12th we were -- 1940, we were supposed to go from London to Liverpool to catch a boat,\nand I remember we sat in the station -- in Victoria Station because the air raids were very\nbad at that time, and we missed the boat. And it was the City of Benares, and the City of\nBenares was a troop ship converted from a Cunard-White Star Line. The City of Benares\nwas sunk a three days later in the -- on its way -- way, and I think 89 children didn't die in\nthe sinking but died of exposure to water. It was a horrific thing. And Churchill\nimmediately cancelled that -- and about 3500 -- there were books on that -- there were\nmore books on that Kindertransport than our Kindertransport because it was a different\nissue. And we stayed in Liverpool, and four days later we -- we got on the SS Antonia\nwhich was a converted Cunard-White Star Line, and all I remember is we were the only\ntwo kids on the boat and we saw in the crew quarters and my -- and for luck they would\nplay cards with us sitting on their lap. And we were supposed to go to New York, and\nthere was a -- there was a U-boat scare. So we went to Montreal, and we arrived in\nSeptember 30th, 1940. And I got to see my first comics, and I can still remember\nthe -- you know, Americans comics was something usual. And I -- I can tell you thestory. It was a Dick Tracy story, and I can do that when I get a smart -- I always -- I've\nalways been trying to get the copy of that -- that particular page from September 30th so I\ncould show -- and my grandfather -- my grandfather had us picked up in Montreal. We\ngot put on the train, and the first day we were in -- in New York City, we went and\napplied for first citizen -- first papers because as far as everyone knew, my parents were\ndead. So my grandfather was my guardian. And we applied for first papers for -- for\ndeclaration, not to -- to get out of refugee status. And I lived in Forest Hills with\nmy -- with my grandmother, and my sister went to my grandfather's brother who lived in\nKingston. He was also quite wealthy. And it was a good life. And I -- and I went to\nschool in Forest Hills and I went to PS3, and they -- a week after my teacher called my\ngrandmother and said, He's seven and a half years old and he doesn't belong in the second\ngrade. We're going to put him in the third grade. So I finished that year, and they said,\nWe need to put him in the fifth grade next year. And my -- and my grandmother said,\nNo. He's -- he's a smart kid, but he needs -- he needs a little bit of respect. He needs to\nbe leveled off a little bit. He needs to be with his age. You can put him in the fourth, but\nyou can't put him -- you can't put him in the fifth. So I was always early because of that.\nBut my grandmother was very -- very clever about that she said, you know, He needs\npeer pressure, and he's not going to get it if he's a smart-alecky kid three years over his\nhead. And -- and then in his early 1941 my grandfather who was in the -- he owned real\nestate, office buildings and apartment houses. They invested with -- with friends. He\nwas in RNS associates and he was visited by a member of the German litigation who said\nto him, Would you like to buy a couple of Jews? And I think my grandfather always kindof said that that's basically what he said. Would you like to buy somebody? And my\ngrandfather said, Who? And they said, Your daughter and her husband. And my\ngrandfather said, I sat shiver (ph) for them two years ago because my grandfather\ndid -- was observant a little then. And they said No, they're alive. They're alive. And so\nan arrangement was made. And from what I understand, and I can't prove it, but I know\nthat the fact that they had warehoused them for two years -- in the back of their mind, it\nwas a product. My -- my -- it was a product to be -- it was currency that could be\nconverted at any time. And an accommodation was made, and my grandfather -- the\ndoors opened in prison, and they told my mother and dad, 48 hours. 48 hours or -- and\nthen right after that, the -- the rest of the people went to -- within six months, they were\nall gone to concentration camps. They closed it up. And they went -- they did the route\nto Portugal, and they were supposed to go to Argentina and -- and wait it out. And the\naverage wait was, like, a year-and-a-half, two years. And my grandfather had very\nintelligent advisers, and one of them said to him, You know you're sponsoring your kids,\nbut they're grown people. Your grandchildren have status as first-paper Americans and\nthey're refugees. Have them sponsor their parents, my mother and dad. Because it's a\n[compassionate] and no argument at all. Immediately after we filed papers, immediately\nmy mother and dad came from Portugal to the United States. And it was -- there's an\ninteresting bypass to this -- this part of it. If 1 may, my dad worked his way, you\nknow -- he did what he could, and he got some Austrian woman and my mother they\ncrocheted the shopping bags. You know, in Europe, they used the net shopping bags\nwhich nobody in America did so the -- the Austrian ladies would sit there and embroidercolor hand -- onto this netting to make handbags. And my dad took them to\nBloomingdale's and started to sell them -- you know, he was much of an entrepreneur,\nand he handled slippers, you know, that -- there were cottage made and he sold those, and\nthen he got into the import/export business. And in 1947, the American government\ncalled my dad in and they said -- you know, he had become a citizen -- and they said,\nYou know your factories are gone. Your factory was bombed because it was making\nrainwear but your father-in-law who had died, his factory is there in Gupendolfush\ndausen (ph), but the equipment all went east to Russia, but it's there. Would you consider\ncoming back? We can offer you projection as an American citizen, not a lot of protection\nbecause it was behind the iron curtain but -- and we can't tell you that you can get any\nmoney on it right now, but it would help Austria come back on its feet and you have\nconnections. And so my dad -- my -- my -- the family said, you know, everybody you\nknew it like the -- their father's right-hand man, he went back starting in '47, went back\nand rebuilt Airkaklidafabrake (ph). And about '49 my mother started going back. My\nfather was not a happy man there. I mean, you know, but my mother, bygones, bygones.\nIt never occurred to her that all of her friends never lost a thing. Still had the houses in\nthe country. Still -- and she would -- it never -- the only way you could be that way 1s if\nyou were one of them. You know, and they were all Christians. And she -- she was\nfriends with them 'till she died. And she was -- she was a little bit different. And I\nremember my deb -- they -- they lived in a ponceon (ph) right on Amgraddam (ph). Do\nyou know Vienna? Amgraddam (ph) is the shopping district like Rodeo drive. And I\nhave -- I was -- I was there just recently, last November, and I took pictures withmy -- with my grandson. And she -- they lived in a ponceon (ph) the whole time and\nshe -- she just kept -- kept going. She just enjoyed life again. And when they were let\nout of prison, the first place they went to was back 2 Elizabeth Street, and they knocked\non the door. And the man opened the door, and my mother said she could see all her\nfurniture. And the man said, What do you want? And she said, Well, We used to live\nhere. And he said, You don't live here anymore, and he slammed the door. In about\n1962, '63, my mother and my dad are eating in a very fine restaurant in Vienna, and my\ndad said -- and you have to remember, my dad was about 5'3, 5'4. He said to my mother,\nExcuse me, and he left the table, and he walked to the table across the room where a\ngentlemen was eating with a woman. And he said, You remember me? And the guy\nsaid, No. And he said, No. You should remember me. You lived in my apartment. 2\nElizabeth StraBe 1941, and I came to the door and you slammed the door. And he\nbrought his voice up a notch, and the guy said, I don't remember. And my\ngrandfather -- my father, very quietly, said, Oh, you must remember me, and repeated the\nstory at a higher voice. And when he got to where he was talking very loudly, the man\ncalled for his check and he left. And my dad went back to table, put his napkin in his lap,\nsaid, Let's eat. And that -- that's a marvelous story because my dad -- my dad was a very\nquiet man. Greatest American that live lived, most patriotic American that ever lived.\nLoved this country. And the only protection they had was he lived in the -- he lived -- the\nfactory was in the 5th district. He lived in the second district. He lived in the first\ndistrict -- first or second then he moved to the first district when my mother move -- came\nin. And, you know, because of the McCarran-Walter Act, he could not be out of thiscountry six months and a day, you know, naturalized citizens had to, you know -- had to\nbe here for at least -- then he had to stay here six months, and it was just an\ninconvenience to him. I mean, he -- he said, I'm not going nowhere. I'm an American\ncitizen, and I'm -- you know, I'm doing this. And he did very well in the factories, and he\nactually was able -- I was -- I was in Germany working in -- I was -- I was in the Air\nForce, and I was the German-American Press Officer for the Air Forces of Europe. And\nwhen I got that assignment, I called my dad in Vienna, and I said, Listen. I can get out of\nthis job. All I've got to do is tell them who -- that you spent time in a German prison.\nAnd my dad said, 20 years is too long to hate. I'll meet you in Frankfort. And\nDietzenbach (ph) is right outside Frankfort, and they would come and they would spend\nsome time. My mother loved that we lived up in the mountains in a -- at a cor or (ph),\nyou know, and they would go in the afternoon, listen to music. My dad was never happy\nin Germany, but he -- he -- he believed in his principle. His principle was, It's 20 years.\nYou got to do what you got to do. And he was very proud of the fact that I was -- that I\ncould do that. And I do have to tell you one -- and I -- I'm digressing, but you know,\nI -- I've done this before. I tell stories. I was the information officer Dietzenbach (ph) air\nbase. And among the things that we had was the Glendola (ph) band of Europe, the Air\nForce band, which is equivalent to the -- the air force band that's in Washington, D.C.,\nand the -- was the same band that Miller conducted when he was lost. And they played\nfrom Glen Miller (ph) music, they played from Glen Aus (ph). And I would -- because I\nspoke German, and I would take them on -- I would be -- I would be their press office,\nand I would do Voice of America Interviews, and we went on a Red Cross tour ofAustria, and we ended up in Vienna playing at the concert hall with 2,000 seats. And the\nconcery (ph) had some problems because it was during the Vietnam War. And when we\ncame on the stage, there were two empty rows which is really frightening. You know, I\nmean, it's -- it implied threat, and it was a 49-piece brass concert band, really\nunbelievably good music. And they -- I -- I did the announcing. I did the announcing for\nthis one. And after about three numbers in the audience, they had just played the Braums\nAcademic Festival Overture (ph), and people said, That's -- that's not a oompa (ph) band,\nand I came on and my German was pretty good, but I had a script. And I said, You're\ngoing to have to excuse me because I need this paper. I said, From my accent you\nprobably can't tell that I was born in this country, and I got a lot of applause. I said, As a\nmatter of fact, I was born in this city, and I got a lot of applause. And I said, As a matter\nof fact, my mother and my father are sitting right there; my mother and my father with\nfour friends are sitting there. And my mother's down like this. And I said -- I said, now,\nI'm not a musician, but I think what you will agree that these gentlemen are -- and\neverybody, yes, because they were magnificent. And I said, therefore, for my mother in\nthe city of my birth, My Fair Lady, and they played. And my mother is crying away, you\nknow. And -- but to give you an idea of what kind of a debutante my mother was -- now\nwe're talking about '68 so my mother's 63 years old, and she comes back stage with my\ndad. And I introduce them to my conductor, and she said, Would you have -- we're\nhaving a little coffee at the Intercontinental Hotel, which is one block from the course\n(ph). We would love it 1f you and the conductor, Miche Delfonso (ph), and the first chair\nwould join us for coffee. I'm her son. I -- we've been touring Austria, walking around allday. And she never mentioned it until she was there. So I did a Voice of America\ninterview, and we walked down the street. And, you know, they're great musicians, but\nVienna appreciates good music. And the restaurant was filled with people who had been\nat this concert. And we did Glen Miller (ph) the whole after the -- and as we walked in,\nwhen the conductor walked in, everybody stood up and applauded. And you know what\na good feeling that is for a professional musician who's a military man to be applauded.\nNot because he was a Air Force officer, but because he was the conductor of a really\ngood orchestra. And we had this wonderful dinner. And -- and I mean, wonderful coffee\nand shla (ph) coffee ve shla (ph). And then my -- my dad, in '68, I was getting ready to\ncome back to the United States in -- in '69, I was coming back, early '69. He said, I'm\ntired. He's 76. It's '68. He came back and he said, It's my last trip. We -- we\nsold -- we've sold it to the European part of family. We've gotten our money out. I'm\ngoing to retire. And he was dead in two months. Couldn't -- came home, had a stroke.\nAnd I think if he had worked, he would have kept on working because that was his -- and\nmy mother -- my mother lived another -- 76 -- 60 was when he died, she was 62. And\nshe died at 94. She lived another 32 years and went back to Vienna. She went back to\nVienna when she was 91 years old. And she would go to co orts (ph). She went to\nShroonz (ph), and she kept those forshluganuh (ph) people as friends all her life. And it\nwas -- it was -- it's an interesting thing. But I -- I'm little different about it. I don't -- I\ndon't know -- I, you know, I -- I meet people and they ask me about -- and I do talk on the\nHolocaust. And they say to me, What do you remember? And I said, I've read some of\nthese books. Some of these books are, like, these 5-year-old children will have anepiphany, Oh, I was totally aware of this and that. That's -- that's bologna because at age\nfive it's a guess. It's -- it's fun. I remember sitting in my back yard in London and\nwatching Lufbafa (ph) fight the RAF, and I thought it was wonderful, you know.\nAnd -- and riding on the train with Zowy (ph), you know -- and so my mother wasn't\nthere to annoy me, and my father was -- was never home anyhow; and I thought it was\nwonderful. Oh, I'm sorry. And I thought it was wonderful.",

And in order to prove that I was a man, I flushed Peter down the\ntoilet. These are the things I remember, and, yet, it was such a significant time.\nBut -- it's not lost on children, but our reactions -- if you put 90 percent of these people\nback into a hypnotic trance and ask them to repeat the things that they've told you, they\nwould say, Well, I think that happened, but it's all post-knowledge. You learn about what\nyou've done later. But for kids -- people always tell me -- you know, I -- I flew combat, I\nflew 130 missions in Vietnam, and I lost a lot of friends. And people say to me, Do you\nhave any regrets? Because a lot of these people -- why me? Why did my mother -- my\nmother didn't love me. She kept my sister and let me go. That doesn't make any sense tome. And I always say to the people, Look. The question always comes up. How do you\nfeel?

She forgot those three years. I would imagine. She never talked about\nit. My dad never talked about it either. And it must have been hard. It must have been\nharder because of the fact that it was a debasing experience for somebody who is not usedto being debased. We only lost one relative, and that was my Uncle Jacque (ph) who was\nthe third brother. And he -- I think he died of Daha (ph). And -- and then, of course, you\nknow, further-out people, but there weren't a lot of us. We were a very small family.\nNow we're a big family. I have nine grandsons. Five of them have my name.

I\nwas among the original tenants at this place, and I was on a board, and I fought a good\nfight against them, you know, and I'm still very good friends with all the people there.\nAnd when my wife died, I -- it was perpetual shiver, you know, and I just couldn't do that\nanymore so I moved on. And I still -- I still go over and help install -- I set up the sound\nsystems and -- because I was a graphic designer so I -- you know, I did -- well, maybe I\nshould touch the fact that I went from Ohio State University directly into the Air Force. I\nspent 20 years in the Air Force as a flyer, as an information officer, as an intelligence\nofficer. And when I got out, my wife and I opened a copy shop, and then we ended\nup -- there were -- we started with just my wife and I, and when we sold 26 years later,we had 11 people. And my wife was the treasurer, so I have all the money I ever need for\nrest of my life because she -- I -- I was the schmoos (ph) and she was the -- she was the\nbusiness end, and we were a good team. And my kids after about eight months, they said\nto me, I was -- I was sour and I needed to socialize. So I said to my daughter, Define\nsocialize. And she said, How old are you? And I said, I understand. I said, what do your\nbrothers think? She said, they put me up to this. They're afraid of you. So I -- I have\nbeen seeing people, and I have gotten into a relationship with a widow who 1s\nsuperintendent of schools of Donna Woodridge -- was. And we -- we have a mutual\nrespect for each other.

She keeps Kosher so I represent that in her home. We -- she doesn't keep\nKosher out, and she doesn't -- you know, when she comes to visit me. But I'm back to\nbeing a Jew which I really never was. You know, as military man, I used to get a lot of,\nWhat's a good Jewish boy doing in the Army? And I said, Air Force. And there is a lot\nof them. Like Jews represent, what, one half or one percent of the population in this\ncountry, small part. My grandson is an Air Force Academy graduate.\nSeven -- seven -- almost eight percent of the class was Jewish which is anomaly, but it's\nnot. It's a good life -- I mean -- and I did it because kind of -- I kind of feel, you save my\nlife -- I felt like my dad. You saved my life. Let me pay you back. And I enjoyed my\nmilitary life.

        "A: Not permanent. And I -- once in a while, there were people here who tell me they\nwere in Bunts Court when I was there. I do not rememberer. I do not remember. I do\nremember that my sister -- there I hit her in the head with a rock because she was\ntormenting me. She was trying to be my mother, and I threw a rock and I caught her\nright between -- right between the eyes. And -- and I -- to this day, I think it was a 200\nfeet, but 1t was probably five feet. But like I said, it's -- it's -- it's interesting. It's hard.\nEverything is hindsight. You -- I have glimpses, and I remember we used to -- for tea,\nwe would toast bread at the fireplace. We had a long fork, and we would toast bread.\nAnd I remember classes were really -- I mean, we learned -- I mean, it was -- it was a\nBritish boarding school run by a -- a -- a German martinet, you know, who really ran a\ntough school. But we weren't beaten; we weren't abused. And I don't ever ever\nremember going into town. I know we did. I don't remember it. I don't care. You know,\nI do -- I do remember when we moved to -- when we -- when the school moved. I think\nthey went to Shropshire (ph). We came to London, and we stayed with my uncle inLondon. And I remember the Blitz (ph) and in the beginning, we used to go every day\ndown to the -- the shelters and the subways, and then after a while with -- you get hit, you\nget hit, you know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. If you were -- there's a very good book called My Heart's in a Suitcase. Anne\nFox wrote it and she's here. And she was at Bunts Court, and there's a whole chapter on\nBunts Court. And I think Anne is a little bit older than Iam. But, once again, it's\nreconstructionist history because you cannot remember methodology, and you cannot\nremember motivation when you're five and six. You remember the good times.",
        "A: When I came to the United States, my sister almost immediately went to Kingston,\nand I was angry because Kingston was -- New York City; but I -- I lived with my\ngrandparents in Forest Hills, and I -- we were in an apartment building there we didn't\nown which is really funny. My grandfather didn't own this one. It was really -- it was in\nthe right off -- right off Greens Boulevard and I walked to school and I had a nice life.\nAnd I -- I never -- because of the fact that my family was a little bit disjointed to start\nwith, my mother was the ultimate intrarude (ph). I mean -- I mean, it -- she was a\nhadanist (ph). She enjoyed her life, and she would -- she had a nanny for us, you know.\nUntil the day she went to prison, she had a nanny -- and she -- for the good times. Butmy sister was already manifesting signs of bipolarism. When she got difficult, she would\nsay to the nanny, You need to take her out. And that -- that's, you know, and that of\ncourse effected it. So my connections with my parents was a little bit different\nthan -- and my dad was a business man. And my -- when I was born, he was 43, and we\nreally didn't talk. And when we came to the United States, it was a little bit too late.\nHis -- I'm -- he's 51; I'm 8, 9. But later on in life, we became friends. We became good\nfriends.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: To this day -- well, you know, when I came back and I -- I became the Dutch\nAmericana shu press officer (ph), I had to -- my German got better again, and I got to the\npoint where I could -- but I used to use words and people'd say, Where'd you get that\nword? And I'd say, well, I'm Austrian. Yeah, but you left when you were six. What\nsix-year-old child says Auskasidenidt (ph)? You know? Or, you know, I -- I had a hell\nof a vocabulary. You know, I was a -- I was a precocious brat. I know that because I was\na spoiled kid, and my sister -- my sister was probably smarter than I was. I mean,\nshe -- she became a doctor, and she -- you know, she was a good student and everything\nelse, but I don't regret what I do. I have a Master's degree, and I'm in public relations;\nand I -- I have good friends and I -- but not -- not as many as I should have because it's\nkind of the military restriction, and you move on and you go someplace else. And I've\nadopted a lot of -- my lady friends, for instance, she's had 60 years and it's different life.It's a good life, but it's -- it's enjoyable. And I enjoy being around -- and it's a solid\nJewish community. I mean, these are -- one of them is a Holocaust survivor, and we all,\nyou know -- they -- they -- they -- they just sit around and drink coffee and -- and play\ncards and -- and talk about nothing hours on end, but it's -- I like it. I -- I like it. And\nthen Shelly and I go to -- go to the theater or we go to a museum, and then we go back\nand we -- and we go to a dance, you know, and -- and it's become -- I'm ready for that.\nI've never really had that. And I've got my kids as friends, and I -- I enjoy my life.",
        "A: New adventure. You know, once again I'm eight years old now and I'm -- and I -- I\nspoke perfect English by that time. And the thing that I remember the most of all was I\ncame into Montreal. And as I told you that my first impression was the Dick Tracy\ncomics and the Tarzan comics and that started my love for comics real early at that time.\nBut I got into the habit of reading billboards. You know, these roads signs and myEnglish -- if I didn't know what the word meant, you know, American, American English\nis different than English English. You know, there was signs for everything. But I was\nfascinated but I remember on the train reading all the billboards. And nobody in my\nfamily -- my grandfather didn't need a car. In New York you don't know a car. But if we\ntravel I read, I would read the subway, the billboards. And I enjoyed the new experience.\nAnd I fit in pretty well. School -- my sister was a little bit abrasive. Like I say she was\nfunctioning. And but I was, I made friends easily. And my best friend was named -- and\nno Jewish kid should ever be named Palmer Kelpelman. Who knows a Jewish kid\nPalmer, P-A-L-M-E-R. Palmer Kelpelman and I got into more trouble. We would ride,\nwe would ride our ride bikes. We would ride our bikes through Forest Hills. And we were\n-- we would go into the candy store and swipe candy. I mean, not because we needed\ncandy but because you could do that. And I ran into Palmer like don't ask me where it\nwas but I think we were about 40 years old at the time. He was the most boring, stuffy\nperson that I've ever met in my life. You know, he was just -- it was just funny that out of\nthat, that one thing Palmer was a bore. And then I ran, I had a friend named Lee Levine.\nAnd Lee's father owned Peter Pan bakeries of New York City.They ran up to about 200\nstores and then there was problems and then they came back. And I road a tricycle\nbecause they wouldn't give me a bicycle. And Lee had a bicycle. And we ran all around\nForest Hills, you know. And years later, my middle son was 14. So this is 36 years ago,\nwe sent him to a sports camp. We sent my middle son to a sports camp at Tom Castella,\nhe used to be a football player. And we went up to visit him and he said, \"Dad, you know\nsomebody named Lee Lavine?\" And I said, \"That's a name out of the past from when Iwas eight years old. Nine years old.\" He said, \"His son is here.\" And Lee, his father flies\nin to visit him every couple of weeks. He was like there six weeks. \"And he takes us out.\"\nAnd I said, \"You sure it's the same guy?\" Well, he said, \"I don't know but he owns all\nthese bakeries named --\" and I said, \"Peter Pan.\" \"Yeah.\" So you know, there one, one\nkid becomes -- one kid becomes -- and the third one of my group was a kid name Richy\nRaskind. And Richy Raskind, his father was an ophthalmologist. And I started to learn\nhow to fly in the Civil Air Patrol and he was also -- and he crashed. And he became -- I\nvisited him. He was -- and he crashed out in Long Island. And he was like\n16 like I was and he survived, you know. And had some plastic surgery done. We used to\nplay at his house all the time. And he was quite wealthy and I was just, you know, I was a\nlittle kid down the block who lived with his grandparents. And he turned into -- he\nbecame Renee Richards. You know who Renee Richards is? That's the sex change\ntennis player. So Richy Raskind became Renee Richards, which I guess was some weird\nfriends. And among my childhood friends Mike Nichols, the director, and my sister were\nan item. My mother and dad used to go to Tanner's Field (ph) room. And to celebrate\nwhere you sat on the porch, you know, you rocked on the porch and they did bring us up\nthere. And the people -- Ms. Nichols owned it. Owned the place. And Mike and Bobby\nwere her sons and they kind of helped out there. And my sister and he -- and years later,\nyears later he went to the University of Chicago. Left for years later I'm in Oklahoma and\nI'm at the University, and I have to fly, I have to fly to get my flying pay. We didn't have\nto do any work so I bought a Playboy Magazine with an interview with Michael Nichols.\nSo I'm reading this thing. And I began to laugh. And somebody said, \"What are youlaughing at?\" I said, \"My sister just made Playboy.\" And they said, \"You're kidding. Let's\nsee.\" And they asked Michael Nichols, \"Do you remember your first sexual\nexperience?\" And he describes the area behind, the woods behind Tanner's field where\nthe flash was. And he said, he goes to this entire thing, you know, but and he said, \"I was,\nI was 16 and she was 18.\" You know, and he says, \"You always remember your first\nexperience,\" you know. And I came back from having to getting that. So I called my\nmother and I said, \"Hi, mom. Listen, you might want to get a copy of Playboy\nMagazine.\" And said, \"I know.\" And I said, \"Oh, really. How do you know?\" She said,\n\"One of my friends told me.\" I said, \"She's not your friend, mom.\" And she said, \"Yes,\nbut you think it's really Lucie?\" I said,\"Mom. Tanner's Field, New York?\"\n\"Well, she wasn't 18. She was only 17.\" I said, \"Mom, who cares.\" Then I called my\nsister. And I said, \"Hey, Mike Nichols remembers you fondly.\" And she said, \"Send me a\ncopy.\" I said, \"The hell with you. You know, buy your own copy.\" But so that's another\nclaim to fame I have that my sister was -- Michael Nichols as first big -- and he is\nmagnificent, you know. He's a good director. He was a good comedian. I mean he did\nthe Graduate. He did, you know, we know a few famous people. Like I said Peter\nDanovich's his family. And friend Zimmerman who died. He directed High Noon and\ndirected Oklahoma. He was a Vietnamese. And he used to visit my mother because my\ngrandmother and my -- and Fred's mother were friends in Vienna. And any time he was\nin New York he would come and see my mother. He never talked film because my\nmother didn't understand films.",
        "A: Yeah, I was pretty -- 'cause I followed. And of course, all young boys and since I was\na voracious reader I knew I had the battle maps, you know. And I was at Boy Scout\nCamp when they dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. And I remember we stood and\ncheered. You know, and now in retrospect it had to be done but it's horrific. It's horrific,\nyou know. But I had a military attitude. And my grandson now flies the drones in\nAfghanistan. He's in Las Vegas flying to Afghanistan. And he doesn't talk about it. He\ndoesn't talk about it. He's not allowed to. But I know he's doing awful --because -- but it's\nbetter that no American pilots are getting killed. The airplanes will do the work. And he's\n-- that's his job. And he and I talk -- his father tries to vicariously live his son's life but he\ngravitates towards me because I'm a combat flyer. And I flew -- I was in Cambodia and I\nflew a lot of friends in it. And when he talks he talks to me. And we have a good\nrelationship. Well, I love all my grandsons. It's just fun. I take every one of them when\nthey turn 12, I take them out to Bar Mitzvah trip. And I started with Joe. And the deal is\nyou get in the car on a Friday afternoon and we go somewhere basically where -- the first\ntrip where we went on a NFL football weekend to Washington, D.C. We stayed in\nGeorgetown and we had a great -- that was Joe. And now I have got it pretty well\nrefined. Lincoln, I took one of them flying. We flew around the Statute of Liberty. Wewent to the battleship in New York. The Aircraft Carrier Intrepid. But they get in the car\nand I say to them, \"This is what we are going to do. This is your party. Anything you\nwant to say to me you can say and whatever you say 1n this car, stays in this car. And it's\nyour party. The deal is you said you would like to do this, if you're tired or you're bored,\nwe are out of there. We will find something else to do in the two days. And I know your\nfather, your mother says 'Be sure you say thank you.\" I don't want to hear that. If you have\na good time when I drop you off at home, say 'Thank you.\" And usually in the beginning\nit's like kind of quiet. And then we just chat because I always make sure we do some\ndriving like that. We drove from Philadelphia to the Meadowlands to see a football game.\nI went to the Cooper's Town Hall of Fame. We went to see Boston Red Sox play in\nBoston. And it's two days. And I had -- I've got a 15 year old. He got in the car at twelve\nand a half. He says -- I said, \"You kind of know what's, you know, what to expect.\" He\nsaid, \"Yeah.\" I said, \"You can say anything you want.\" And he said, \"Can I say this?\"\nAnd he said a four letter word. I said, \"Sure.\" He said, \"How about this?\" He did about\nsix words. I said, \"Very impressive.\"",
        "A: Yeah. Very impressive. I said, \"So what else do you want to talk about?\" You know,\nso he got out of it. And he's getting -- he had his headset and he's listening to music crap.\nWithin an hour he's got the headset off and we're having a good, we are having a --\nbecause my wife used to say it's amazing my boy -- my grandsons love me and until they\ngo on that last trip. After that last trip they are yours. That's really funny. We will sit\nsomewhere and they will sit shoulder -- on my shoulders. You know, we sit in theliving room both boys sit -- I'm not --I'm not Oppa and I'm not Vaggy. (Ph). And I'm not\nPop Pop. I would kill the first child that calls me Pop Pop. I hate that. And then it's -- they\ncall my grandpa. And we have -- one of them called my gramps and that's my inventor\nand he does that just to irritate me. And he also when I started getting bold he was also\nthe one that does this to me. But other than that I've got a good life, you know, I have\nbeen -- I enjoy what I do. And I know a lot of people just because I -- I don't -- I have\nbeen having an interesting time here. And I went to this seminar on can we do a plan\nfrom the next possible Kindertransport? Is it possible to come up with a plan. And of\ncourse, the argument was in this modern day and age if it's a disaster like -- she started to\ntalk about Katrina. I said we can do Katrina, the world can save Katrina because we\nhave the airplanes. And we have the equipment. And we can go down to Haiti. I did the\nHaiti. I was in McGuire as retired and I helped with the Haitian Airlift. I helped the\nrefugee thing because that's what I do. And I said but the Kindertransports, Rwanda\nneeded a Kindertransporter but because they were black it was messy. And so the final\nthing she said was we have to sum this up. I said, \"You know, the next time you need a\nKindertransport for a specific group, put them in a mine in Chile where within 69 days\neverybody will be rescued and there will be no political stuff because that's what the\nworld does best. I mean this thing with the miners. So let's put the problem into a mine in\nChili and the world will solve it. Otherwise, Rwanda is still not solved. You know,\nKosovo, Sarajevo; not solved. They are still finding bodies.",
        "A: 1968 when I took -- the first time I went back to Austria was when I took the band, the\nGlen Miller band to Grats and Mimins and the military. And then I visited again with my\nwife and kids again in '68. And then just last November I was in Vienna in 2009 with my\ngrandson.",
        "A: My grandfather died young, he died when I was 14. So he died in 1946.",
        "A: Well, first thing he did was he looked for work. And he came up with this idea of the\npitman shortage was starting. And in Europe women carry net shopping bag, you know,\nfishnet shopping. And so like I said, he got my mother's friends who are all wonderful\nbecause they were all society women. They could all do embroidering and they could do\nthis stitch. And they stitched these handles. Beautiful colors. They got the most colorful\nrolls to do that and he immediately started selling them. He took two dozen to\nBloomingdale's and they ordered 100 dozen the first day he was there. Now he's got to\nget woman in line to do this. And then he did this and he did that. And then he became\npolitely put it he became a facilitator. He went into the import/export business. During\nthe War and after the War he was friends with -- he made friends with a guy named Sam\nSpig -- Sam Spiggel. And they had their European contacts and so on. And whenever\nsomething was needed, they understood how to get it legally. Not illegally. Legally they\nknew where to get things. They would -- the need -- like my dad invented these shopping\nbags for Americans but knowing it from Europe. They had a pretty good business\ntogether. And then Sam's son came out of the military. And he was a radar operator, you\nknow radar was new and television had just started, you know. The World Series in 1939.\nThere was and the first television was shown at the World's Fair. And the son came to us\nthere and he said, \"Television is the future.\" I know how to build -- you know, at that\ntime you could buy a kit to make a television set with tubes and the whole bit. They are\ngoing to be hundreds of television stations around the country and they need monitors.\nThey will need the monitor. It's nothing but a television set for one station basically 1swhat. I want to build perfectly, correctly done. I'll buy the kits. I want to build them and\nsell them to television stations as their monitors. And Sam came to my father and he said,\n\"I want to get into this.\" My father, you know, he was mechanically was a disaster. He\nsaid, \"If it will make us a buck,\" and they did very well. They made the first monitors for\nCBS New York and WOR and Dumont station. They had a good business. They had\nabout four or five of these guys who were really good at it. There was tubes and solder\nand wire and they would pinch them until they were correct. And then they would deliver\nthem and they got good money for them. You know, we had the first 12 inch television\nset. I watched the 1947 World Series in my house on a 12 inch TV set which was big, big\nTV set. And you know the memory of Europe after the war, a lot of Europeans came to\nthe United States. Took out their first papers, hung around for three months and went\nback to Europe, you know, because the established residence and then went back. A lot\nof my mother's friends did that. And they kind of hang out at my house a lot of times, you\nknow. I mean they lived in small quarters. There weren't that welcome because nobody\nhad a lot of -- the wealthy people didn't have a lot of money but they came to the United\nStates so they would have the protection in the next war. They would sit in my living\nroom watching television which was primitive. Eating good food and have gained,\neveryone gained 10, 15 pounds, and talk about how stupid Americans were. And I\ncouldn't stand it. And I was 12, 13. I couldn't stay in the same room with them because it\nwas impolite to me. It was impolite to be rude to your guests. But I hate -- don't talk\nabout my country like that because I'm an American. As far as I know, I'm going to be an\nAmerica. And my dad the same way. My dad was not happy with that. But they would sitand eat. They eat really good food. You know, they would and then talk down the\ncountry that they were getting first papers from. My mother said, you know, \"They're just\nprotecting themselves.\" No, you're not. You need manners. You are going to do that at\nleast if you're a hypocrite be a hypocrite with manners. Don't be a hypocrite with no\nmanners. And so you know, we didn't agree on a lot of things but nobody talked. I mean\nyou weren't allowed. You didn't talk against them.",
        "A: A little bit. My dad not a lot. Because he was -- I can't remember. My father came out\nof Polish country stock. And so he was a self-educated man. He was never very\ncomfortable. My father never spoke to my mother, my grandmother in familiar. He never\nsaid Due. As a matter of fact if he said something, you speak German? He would say to\nmy mother through my grandmother's (Speaking German.) \"Would the dear mother like a\ncup of coffee?\" He always called her (German). De or Due. Always spoke because he\nwas -- her husband had been his boss. You know, and he was like -- my mother's family\ntreated my dad like the hired hand. He went back and he build that business. And by the\ntime the business sold they had, he had a lot of money had come back, had filtered\nthrough Switzerland legally. And they -- there's still money in Switzerland from 1968,\n'78. Still money accruing legally. Absolutely legally but he managed money correctly\nand did -- and he was their hired hand. And my mother let them do that. But you know,\nhe was so much older than I was. I didn't have that kind of -- I didn't have that much\nrespect for hem. But as I got older I liked him more and more. We really can get into\nconversations and we liked each other. My dad was a good chess player. And he wouldbeat my brains out. He never insulted me. It was always, \"Let's play another one.\" \"Oh,\nyou want to play another one. Oh, yeah.\" And I first time I beat him and I was so proud\nof myself. And so my kids, you want to play -- I'm not a good chess player but I'm better\nthan my kids. But you want to beat me, I mean you want to play me chess. You want to\nbeat me. I'm not throwing the game. You want to play Gin Rummy with me. If you are\nstupid, you're going to lose. And you know, and you know, it's not -- I'm not -- if you\nplay with me level, I'll treat you with respect and respect is play. And I'll play with you\nand when you beat me, I would say, \"Do you want to play?\" And my genius grandson\ncan beat me to death. And plays three dimensional chess. He plays this three level chess.\nHe says, \"I'm not very good at it.\" I mean, \"You can't play?\" \"Oh, I understand the game.\nI'm just not a good chess player.\" He beats my brains out. So we don't play any longer.\nBut that's -- it was a different, different kind of a family. You know, we didn't have many\nJewish ties. And maybe I regretted. That's why I kind of like Shelly. Like I said, one\nday I said to my son, I said, \"Where you going tonight?\" I said, \"I'm going to Black\nWood to be with Shelly. To Lakewood.\" He said, \"What are you going to do today?\"\n\"We're going to the show.\" And he said, \"Dad, you hear that sound?\" I said, \"What is\nthat?\" \"That's my mother spinning in her grave.\" You know, because that wasn't wasn't\nme. I enjoy it, you know. You know, because I got nothing to do right now. I'm enjoying\nmy life. You know I go to bed when I want to. I'm kind of regretting having to give up\nthis bachelor pad I've got now. Because not like, I'm a cook and there are some older\npeople living above me but they see me travel with a suitcase and Camo bag andthey know I'm a graphic designer and they know I'm a photographer. And they know --\npeople they know that I sit out there and I smoke. I'm back to smoking one cigar a day.\nAnd I sit out by the pool and I put on a headset. Here's a 77-year-old man with a headset\non and a hoody with the Air Force Academy on it smoking a cigar and listening to -- they\nhave no idea what I'm listening to. If I told them what I listen to. I listen to Doo-wop\nmusic or I listen to Mozart. And I just -- and the little Oriental kids come and play with\nme. And I say \"Mehow.\" (Ph). And they say \"Mehow.\" You know, I'm kind of like they\nhave no idea how old I am. They have no idea how old I am. I don't feel like I'm old,\nyou know, I mean you have some people here and some of them are -- I'm very -- for a\nwhile I was solid, but you know then I got my life back. For the last year I got my life\nback. And it's a new adventure because I can show -- I can -- she is sharing Judaism, you\nknow, she's been an Orthodox Jew. She is more of a mystic. She believes people have\nauras and people are this and people are that. But she's -- she is way more Jewish than I\nam. And I'm enjoying myself. I'm enjoying myself. I'm never -- I'm not happy with God.\nI'm not happy with God. I mean we work hard. My wife and I worked hard. And two\nmonths after we retire we was going to have a great time together because we got all the\nmoney in the world we need. We are going to do this. The kids are all very well off. And\nwe were going to have a good time and she strokes out on me for seven years. That's\nselfish what I just said. She just stroked out on me. She stroked out. And I would have\ndone this for the next 30 years. I would have -- as she got more infirm -- and they said,\n\"Dad, you have all of this insurance. You need to have somebody in 24/7.\" I said,\n\"Nobody sleeps with your mother but me.\" You know, I don't care if she gets up in themiddle of the night. I will take you to the bathroom and I'm not embarrassed about it. But\nyou know, your mother and I had been together for some long but I would feel wrong.\nAnd my wife -- your mother would feel wrong having to be helped to the bathroom by an\naide while I'm in the room. That's different. I would rather do it myself. And I tell you my\ndaughter told me this maybe two months ago. The last year every Saturday she would say\n-- my daughter would say -- my wife would say, \"I want to talk to my daughter.\" I dial\nthe phone. I would say or Susan would call. I would go do my Camo work for something\nelse. I would go out with the board. And they talked for what an hour and half. And she\nsaid, \"Paul, I have to go to the bathroom.\" She would say, \"I will call you back.\" I get her\na cup of coffee or something to eat and she go back to the phone. And Susan said that for\nthe last year every time she said goodbye she would say, \"Remember. Do not let him\nvegetate.\" That's a good woman. And which is a blessing, you know. Originally I said,\nyou know, it's not very long. \"Dad, you're impossible. You know, you're grumpy.\nYour outlook on life is wrong. You know, the kids -- you're affecting the kids. You're\nnot, you know, you're not who you normally are.\" And so basically she said, \"Mom\nwouldn't want do you do that. Mom wouldn't want you to do that.\" And this woman\nunderstands. I mean she -- when we did -- like November 18th is, 19th is -- is was\n28th. I would like -- but we will go to the cemetery the three of us. The four of us\ndepending on if Jack can come from Richmond. We go to the cemetery. We will go to her\nfavorite restaurant and we will order a vodka and Absolute and 7-Up and we will put it in\nthe middle of the table and we will have lunch and we will leave the glass there when we\ngo home. It's just, you know, it's something to do because we were friends. And it hasnothing to do with Jewish tradition. I mean I do not like my religion right now. I don't\nlike -- what kind of God let this go on like this? I went back to my senior community for\nthe holidays. And I didn't, I did-- I did Rosh Hashana but I fasted and I did Yom Kippur\nwith my friends because out of respect. I think, I think that she needs to be remembered.\nShe needs to be remembered for everything. And I never going to -- she is buried in a\nmilitary cemetery about 20 miles from where I live and six miles from the base. And I\nwork at the McGuire Airforce Base one day a week at the terminal helping people, space\navailable in the families. And I can go two miles out of my way and take a different road\nto the base. And I visit my wife twice a month for ten minutes. It's just -- I go out there. I\nremember one day I was at McGuire. I was going to go afterwards because it was\nsummer. It was late. And the base closed up because there were lighting storms in the\narea and they said, \"We're going to cancel all operations.\" So the weather was still clear\nand I said, \"I'm going to go out to the cemetery now.\" And I was standing there and I\ndon't know if you have seen military cemeteries, they are flat. All of headstones, you\nknow, how thousands are buried there. And I'm standing there and about 150 feet away\nwas this lighting bolt came down and hit in the middle of the woods and I began to ran. I\nmean the thunder and lighting hit together so it was right where I was. I was standing out\nthere among metal planks so I started to run for the car. And the car is 150 feet way and I\nam like awetrag. And it's raining and the lighting is hitting and I rolled the window\ndown and I said, \"That's not funny. You got me.\" But it's just, you know, it's not -- you\ndon't have to -- one of the greatest -- there's a man. His wife died in December. And\nevery time I was there, he would spend four days a week in a chair and he had a hamperfor food and he would sit for six hours a day and go have lunch and go back. He had a\npicture of his wife and he set it up in the attic. And he sat up and that's not necessary.\nYou know, we can tell stories about my wife forever and the kids understand that. I\nmean, you know. And they have a totally different idea of who she is because she is the\ntough one. You know, I went to Vietnam she ran the house. And she got into it with my\n14-year-old son about he wanted a motor scooter. And he wrote me a letter. And the letter\nsaid, \"Dear Dad, your wife is driving my crazy.\" That's beauty, isn't it? \"Your wife is\ndriving me crazy.\" I wrote her back a letter. I said, \"Join the crowd. Take a number. Live\nwith it.\" You know, what else was there. But I have a good relationship with the kids.\nYou know, you talked about German. You talk about working for Germans. My daughter\nworked -- she was IT for Siemens for 17 years. She was head of IT from big money. And\nthen when she got divorced she wanted to stick close to the home and now she works IT\nfor a buyer and she works from home and she is an absolute killer. She's a mother. She's\njust as much as my mother as her mom. And my oldest son is vice president of NCR\ncorporation and he runs the automated checkout division. And he is a combination. He's\nme. He's a little guy. Five foot six and his son is five foot four. He's a little guy but you\ndon't want to call him a little guy. I mean he's vice president NCR and he's really tough.\nHe owns a vineyard and we go out and we pick by hands for 10 years. I just finished for\nhelping. And the third one is a Cornell graduate and he's largest caterer in Virginia. Right\nnow business is not great. Nobody has any money. When Betty died, we had sold the\nhouse and we took the money to buy this apartment in this Federation, CCRC, or most of\nit and I got lucky because when I die -- when she died and I moved out I got 90 percentof my money back. That they had a year to pay me but they sold my apartment within\ntwo months. So I took 200,00 some odd thousand dollars. And I said, \"This is not my\nmoney. This is not my money.\" And I set up education funds for the remaining\ngrandchildren that hadn't been -- and I gave money to the guys who had graduated. Not a\nlot of money but I got nine of these guys that I spent -- I gave $200,000 away. Well, and\nwhat about mothers. As I started taking care of my mother I would drive up there twice a\nmonth and I would pay the help and I would do the shopping for her. And you know, and\nshe said to me, \"I have to redo my will.\" I said, \"Okay.\" And she said, now the problem\nis you know Liz is on welfare, you know, and on Social Security. And they tell me that\nshe's not going to -- that that might affect the will.\" I said, \"You're damn right. Any\nmoney you leave her the State of New York will take for welfare. | You have to pay\nback the state before she gets the money.\" \"Well, that's not fair.\" I said -- she said, \"Well,\nthen we have -- I want to give money to my grandchildren. She has two daughters and\nyou have three children.\" I said, \"Mom, just skip the generation.\" \"Well, I can't do\nthat.\" I said, \"I don't need your money. I don't have the money but I don't need your\nmoney. I already running your business anyhow. You got money. I'm representing\nyou in all the family affairs and I don't get paid for it. Skip a generation.\" \"Oh, that can't\nbe done.\" My idiot uncle who is an engineer says, \"Oh, you can't do that.\" I said, \"Talk\nto your attorney.\" So they get an attorney. They get a $3,000 bill that say, yeah, of\ncourse you can do that. The guy thought about it for nine minutes. They said, \"He doesn't\nknow what he's talking about.\" They get another attorney and they spend $4,000. Says,\n\"Yeah, of course you can do that. I'll write the will.\" So now the will gets -- and thedeal is skip a generation, the money gets split between the five grandchildren. And\namong them -- among not between. And I'm the executor which 1s legal. I get a call from\nmy uncle. He says, \"That's an unfair will.\" \"What are you talking about?\" He said, \"You\nknow, it was 50/50. Your three children were going to split 50 percent of grandma's\nmoney. My mother's money. And your sister's kids were going to get -- now they would\nhave gotten 25 percent each. Now they are really getting 20 percent and your children\nshould have gotten 60 now they are getting 20. That's not fair.\" And I said a verb and\npronoun you know what I mean. And I said, \"You know, 25 percent of nothing is\nnothing. 20 percent of million plus is something.\" And each one of the kids got almost\n$300,000 by the time I finished, you know, over the years and I distributed it. And so I\nfeel very good about that. And I don't mind, you know, it was better for them. I mean\nthey were able to use it. And Mike bought a vineyard and Susan bought a house, and you\nknow, everybody did well. And but that's the family this, this spoiled bunch of -- my\ngrandfather and my grandmother were really sharp but they raised three of the most\nspoiled brats in the history of the world, you know. I love my uncle because he was a\nmechanical engineer genius and he died just two years ago. Great. He was a good man.\nWe were friends. But as far as -- I said to him, \"Are you going to go for the Holocaust\nmoney?\" And he said, \"I'm not a Holocaust survivor.\" I said, \"Walter, where were you in\n19392\" He said, \"I was a student at RPI.\" I said, \"Where were you living?\" He said, \"I\nwas a Student living in United States going to Polytech.\" I said, \"Were you able to get\nback?\" He said, \"Oh, no. I couldn't get back.\" I said, \"Guess what, you were a refugee.\"\n\"Oh, you think so. Well, I don't need the money.\" I said, \"Okay. Let me fill it out foryou. You know, fill out the information. I'll ask you questions and we will submit it.\"\nAnd he said, \"If you get me money, you can have it.\" Then a year later I called him up\nand I said, \"Where's my check?\" He said, \"What check?\" I said, \"You got a check for\n$26,000 and you told me I could have it.\" \"Well, I will buy you dinner.\" And I said, \"I'm\ngoing to find a place where dinner is $26,000 because you own me money.\" No -- well\nno. I said, \"Don't worry about it.\" So the next sequence came and they didn't fill it out\nagain. This time they lost a lot of money because now they started -- here's an interesting,\nthe last preparations came in, you know -- and you know, we had the apartment and the\nworld but I remember my father sold the family business so they couldn't have that many\nassets left because they had been paid -- the money had been come out of in 60s. Sol\ngot my final and they said, you know, it's so many -- you people live so -- basically it's\nyou people life so damn long. There is so many of you remaining, we don't have a lot --\nwe can only pay ten cents on the dollar. Here's what you're worth and we're going to pay\nyou a three-fifth. So remember your sister gets, your sister's family gets one half of the\nestate but since they didn't apply for it nobody gets it unless you're willing, you know,\nunless you're willing to let them get paid through you and you will agree to pay them\nwhich I did. And they left a lot of money on the table. Now you are going to get -- you\nare going to get documents that I'm getting you. And among the documents I found this\nlist because I'm pretty good about the computer and the internet. And there was a listing.\nAnd here was my father and there were open insurance policies. I said that can't be my\nfather; he didn't believe in insurance. But I wrote them a letter. And it was a Italian\ncompany, department. And I said, \"My dad died. Here's the death certificate. My motherdied. Here's her death certificate. My sister died, here's her death certificate. I have no\nidea what this is but the birthday is correct and asked peck (ph) is correct. Do I have any\nmoney coming?\" About a month later I get this package and it looked like it been went\nthrough a washing machine. And there is stamps all over it; Italian stamps. And it's from\nthem and it's a package. And they said, \"Yes. You are -- thank you very much. We have\ncertified that you're the sole beneficiary because of the fact that we have the death\ncertificate. Your father took out a $2,000 -- now he took out a $200 annuity for 20 years\nwould have have paid in '49. And the Nazi party cashed it in in '39. Therefore since that's\nan invalid cash in, it would have been 4,200 some odd dollars. Since it's an invalid cash\nin, We are going to pay as if you had never done it, we would like to know where to sent\n$137,000. And I read it again. And I said, \"We're going to buy a nice car, Betty.\" You\nknow because the best revenge is living well. You know, and I got -- so my bank that I\nused to print for calls me up and says, \"Mr. Halpern we just got a deposit into your\naccount.\" I said, \"Really.\" They said, \"Yeah. You want to leave it in your checking\naccount?\" I said, \"Five figures?\" They said, \"No, it's six figures.\" I said, \"Okay. I'll be\ndown there. We are going to deal with it but just put 1t over into a money market\naccount until I get there.\" But that was, you know, and that was my dad and he had done\nthat for one reason: Because my grandfather believed in insurance. Now I will tell you\nif my father had a $200 account, my grandfather's account was in those papers. His name\nwas listed too. They never followed up on it. Now if my father had $200, you know how\nmuch -- my grandfather had a policy with Anchor. Anchor was a British company\nUncore I think but they paid too. If my grandfather had -- if my father had $200, thenmy grandfather must have had $2,000. Because my grandfather -- my father would never\nhave bought that policy if my grandfather hadn't said it was a good idea.",
        "A: Nope.",
        "A: Well, the building got bombed out.",
        "A: It's completely -- it's a totally different building now. It was the corner building onto to\nwhere you stepped out. But no that's -- I don't know what happened. It's just a great story\nbecause my father, my father was that kind of a man. Quick one on my father that that I\nheard from my mother and she -- her attitude was different. Where my mother went in\n1950 the first time she was went -- she was going to come live with him in Germany and\nyou got the Ponseon and they always traveled by the Queen Elizabeth and they played\nbridge all the way across the ocean and back. And you had stop in Paris to get a gray card\nso you can go behind the Iron Curtain. And at that time the Cold War was going on.\nAnd my father said to my mother, \"We're going to get on this train. And we have a\ncompartment, you know, semi-private compartment. And the Russians are going to come\non board and they are going to ask you. You don't say a word. Not a word. I'll talk to\nthem.\" You got to remember he's really mild mannered. He says, \"You can't say\nanything.\" And you know, if you know that the Russians occupied Austria with theirMongrel troops. Vienna was occupied by the Mongrels because the Russians knew that if\nthey sent their sophisticated troops in possession was unbelievably high so they sent in\nthe guys that slaughtered chickens -- I mean they really were the murders. You're a\nRussian but you understand what I'm saying?",
        "A: The Mongrels troops were the ones that they sent and they were tough. So my mom\nand dad, the train starts and it gets to the border. And into their compartment come two\nSoviet soldiers. And my dad -- and they are carrying Stems over their shoulder. And he\nsays -- when the soldier says to my father, \"Passport.\" International world. My father\ntakes out these two -- in those days the American passport was green with this enormous\neagle on it. The American eagle. And this guy looks at him and he says, \"Americanee.\"\nAnd my father says -- and he takes the passport and he opens it and he does this, you\nknow, next to his face. And then he goes to my mother and she flinches and does that\nnext to her face. He closes it and he hands it to my father and he hands it to my father and\nhe leans over my father and he spits between my father's legs. (Noise.) He hands him the\npassport and father says, \"Thank you.\"",
        "A: '60, '61. And he says -- no, no. Excuse me, '50, '51. Excuse me, but this '50 or '51.\nBecause my mother went in '50. So it had to be '50. And he -- my father says, \"Thank\nyou.\" And this Russian looks at him and he says, \"Sacebo\". (Ph). My father says, \"Thank\nyou.\" He says, \"You sir, Sacebo.\"My father said, \"I am an American. Thank you.\" And\nthe guy took the sten off. Never pointed it at him. Took the sten off his helmet and said,\"Sacebo.\" And just then an officer comes to the door and he says in Russian, \"What the\nhell is going on?\" We got all this -- you guys are wasting time here.\" My father leans\naround this soldier and in perfect Russian says to him, \"This expletive deleted, expletive\ndeleted is trying to teach me a language that was my mother tongue before he was just an\nidea in his father's mind.\" You know, really course. And he said, \"He wants me to speak\na language that I knew. I will not. Iam an American. I will speak my language. The\nlanguage of, of the country.\" And he said -- and he sat there. And the soldier is still\nholding the passports. The officer went over and he took the passports out he said\nsomething. They left the compartment. And the officer walked up to my father, handed\nhim the passport and said, \"Thank you.\" Which is a great story. You know, but my\nmother said, \"You father's insane. Your father is insane. He could have gotten me killed.\"\nThat's my mother. And I said, \"No, if you had died you would have died a hero,\" because\nthat's magnificent. That was my dad. You know, I mean he was a real quiet man and I\nwish I had known him better. And to tell you the truth when I go up to the family plot, I\ntalk to my father. They're buried in Mont Hepburn in Fleshing, New York. I go up there\nonce a year. But that's -- so money wise I don't know. I do not know what happened. I\nknow the apartment was demolished. I know that went to visit the factory in\nGupendolfush Dausen (ph). On our way out back to Vienna we stopped. It's in the Fifth\nDistrict. And I went -- I vaguely remember that you had to open -- it was a bunch of\nbuildings on a narrow street but you had to open a gate. There was a courtyard for the\nfactory. And it's still there but it's a music studio and graphic design. Once again there we\ngo again. But I -- I don't feel any smertz for loss because I'm an American. I mean Icame so early. I love baseball. I played college soccer but I played. I'm an American.\nI'm sportswriter. I can be couth, uncouth. You know, but I am, I like who I am. I'm -- not\neverybody likes me but I am who I am.",
        "A: No, we -- well my mother wanted to speak to my father, they knew the German we\nunderstood it. We didn't speak German at home. But they were would talk French. No\nmy father -- typically my mother. My mother spoke a lot of languages. My father speaks\nabout twelve. From business he spoke Czech, Croatia, Slovenian, Russian, Hebrew. But\nmother would speak in a language in which he was uncomfortable -- he was not\ncomfortable in French. He could speak it.But he was like a student. My mother spoke\nperfect French because she learned it. You know, but pretty soon we caught on.\nAnd my sister and I both took French from, you know, we knew what they were talking\nabout. Then they switched to Czech a little bit. But no, no, but my mother, of course,\nspoke German with her friends. And I just wanted to slap her silly. Because come on,\nmom, everybody speaks English. I know you speak English. I know she speaks English\nbecause I speak English to her. And she is just -- she was just a little bit different. But\nyeah, we can't speak -- like I say, my vocabulary came out of nowhere. Like I said, what\nfive-year-old child knows the word was asqacitnine (ph). You know, and I would pick up\nexpressions from my mother. She called delicatessen the Malour (ph) shop because it's,\nyou know, I use that expression. I guess I learned some things from my mother. Snobbish\nthings. But no, she would do life totally -- to somebody who spent two years in the prisonwhen from the Nazis to be totally unaffected. Literally unaffected by it. Ask me who her\nfavorite composer is? Wagner.",
        "A: Of course. My mother went -- they live in Forest Hills. When my dad died her friends\nwouldn't come play bridge on the subway so she moved to Lincoln -- to one Lincoln\nCenter so she could walk and always had one ticket available. She used to go three or\nfour times a week to the opera. They would hold the ticket at the box office. And they\nalways had one ticket for her. And she would sit through the entire -- she would sit\nthrough every single one of these one of those and they would do this marathon. They\nwould do them like in five nights and my mother would go every night. And it's like\neating a mattress. It's good God. There some nice but it's really heavy, heavy, heavy\nheart. So she bought this membership. And she always got five tickets for two for five.\nShe always had a ticket. She would get five operas and she would also be able to pick\nthree good ones and always Wagner. And it always give you -- like you know when you\nbuy baseball seats, you get the teams you don't want to see but you have to buy that\nticket. And she said to us, \"I have these tickets to the Opera. Why don't you come and\nhave dinner and then you can go to the opera because I have these very nice seats.\"I said,\n\"That's nice of you, mom.\" I like opera but my wife -- Cleveland, Ohio. And she said -- I\nsaid, \"What's the opera?\" She said, \"Hazel and Gretel.\" And I said, \"Thanks, mom.\" I\nhope -- \"Will there be a translation so I can follow this story?\" That was my mom.\nEnd of File Two\nBeginning File Three",
        "A: It is -- it was -- Levi Eshkol had just died. And when we visited the cemetery, they\nhad just -- it was the last day of Shiva, and they had opened the grave up for -- you know,\nthat people could go by there. And so that's the timing. I just figure out a week after\nLevi Eshkol died, that's when I was there with my wife on that trip. And I loved\neverything, and I felt very -- and my wife said, This is the most amazing place in the\nworld. That garbage man over there is a Jew, and that mailman is a Jew, and that guy in\nthat barber shop giving a haircut is a Jew. And, you know -- and they'll talk about the\nrich Jews, and everybody is a brother here, and it isn't -- it's -- it's classless. I mean, there\nare classes but within -- and it -- it makes a lie out of the rich Jew. And she says, I'm not\na rich Jew. I was a poor Russian, you know, and I -- you know, and they told me I killed\nChrist, you know. And -- but she was very -- she loved Israel. We thought it was -- and\nwe walked. There was no tram. We walked up on the -- the -- the Masada. We walked.\nWe walked up there. And, of course, to me, the military aspect of it is tremendous. You\nknow, that's where the Tank Corps gets sworn in. And I tried to get -- give my military\nguys -- I says, You don't understand. Never again means never again. And it's -- if -- and\nthey said, Well, you know, we're not -- we're gonna neglect Israel. I says, You're out of\nyour mind. Israel goes down, they will take the rest of the world down with them,\nbecause never again means never again. They're not going down without a fight. And ifthe fight is nuclear, they're gonna go nuclear and the world will die because of that, so it\nbehooves every country in the world to make sure that Israel continues to exist because of\nthe fact that these are tough, tough people who are not going down. Now, I'm not as\nhonest. I -- I believe land for peace, but that's my opinion. And I had no right to tell\nthem what to do, and I feel very strongly about that. And what's interesting 1s, I -- I had\nthe -- like I say, I had this -- my father's cousin. Her name was Betty Rubenstein (ph) and\nher kids were soverest (ph), and she and her husband came in the thirties through the\nPalestine. And they were very well-established, and they had friends in high places. And\none of her friends was a woman named Tao Rath (ph) who was the pearl (ph) muster, the\nsocial -- unofficial social secretary. When Bernstein would come to -- he would stay with\nTao. And we had a lot of time because, in between peace missions, you know, when --\nthe Secret Service would be at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, and they'd say,\nHenry's going to bed. You guys are off duty. Check in again in the morning. Because\nwe flew the limousine back and forth. And I get a call from this lady, and she says to me,\nHi, I'm Betty's -- Betty Rubenstein's friend, Tao Rath. And I didn't know who that was.\nShe said, Do you like music? I said, I love music. She says, You know, the Israeli\nPhilharmonic is playing tonight. I said, Yeah, but it's like the -- like the tickets to the\nBoston Red Sox. You have to -- have to know somebody who dies so you can get their\ntickets. She said, Ooh, would you like to go? And I said, I would love to go. And she\nsaid, Do you have a jacket? And I said, Yes, I have a jacket. I had a blazer, because we\nflew civilian clothes. And she said -- and she said, The address is so and so. I said, I\nknow where it is. I can get there. I'll take a cab. And we were staying downtown -- wewere staying out by the airport, as a matter of fact. I said, I can get there. And I'm\nstanding there, and she said, Meet me at the musician's entrance. And this limousine\npulls up and this driver gets out and he opens the door and this woman about that big --\nmy mother's small. This woman is that small. And she gets out, and she is the most\ncharming woman in the world. And she says, We're running late. Come in. She knocks\non the door, and the door opens up and the guard says, Ah, Mrs. Rafal (ph) Rath, how are\nyou? Hello, Henry. How are you? And she shakes his hand, and we walk across the\nstage -- and the orchestra's tuning up. We walk across the stage, we walk down into the\naudience and Krivitsky was conducting and playing. He actually was gonna play. And\nhe's magnificent. And we walk, and she's shaking hands with people, and she says,\nWhere's George? Oh, George is not here tonight. He couldn't make it. Okay, this is my\nfriend Paul. He's with Dr. Kissinger. He's gonna sit here. And I said, Where are you\ngonna sit? She says, Ooh -- and I look and she's sitting on the steps with friends. And\nthe first act is -- you know, he -- he's playing, and it's marvel -- he's a real -- he was\nfantastic in typical Russian with -- with the flowing hair. And she says, Come buy me a\ndrink, you know? Then she says, Do you have any Israeli money? And I said, Yeah, I\ngot shekels, you know? And we stand there, and people come around her because she\nis -- and because I'm with her, people are talking to me. And we -- we finish, and we go\nback to -- back to our seats and we finish the concert, and she says, Would you like to\nmeet the maestro? I said, I'd love to. And we go to the Arturo Toscanini room, which is\nthe VIP lounge, back of the hall, and she walks in and Krivitsky puts down his glass,\nwalks across, kisses her hand and says, Tao, my darling, how are you? And she said --she says, I'm wonderful. This is my friend, Paul. He's with Dr. Kissinger. And, of\ncourse, he doesn't shake hands with anybody. His hands are his gold. And he said, Nice\nto meet you. I said, Thank you so much, Maestro. It was marvelous, you know? I know\nhow to talk. And he looked at me like Americans that do that, and he said, You're\nwelcome. And that was the first time. So we went to see two concerts. One was with\nthe American -- the one that conducted the Washington National, the black who was\nparalyzed, and he was marvelous, too. One day she says, Are you free for dinner\ntomorrow? And I said, I'll call you. And I'd gone out to where she lived one day, and she\nsaid, Betty -- I want to take you and Betty to dinner. And she fixed me up at the hotel\nand Betty's in the car with Dr. Rubenstein, and we go driving out into the mountains \u2014\nobviously, you know -- you know Tel Aviv and that area -- and there's an enclave up\nthere where most of the official -- government officials live. Very highly secure. And\nwe get to the gate, and she says, Do you have an identification card? And I said, Of\ncourse. And we get to the gate, and this real hard-ass Israeli soldier at the gate, and he\nsees the limo, so a little bit of respect, and he leans in the back window and he says, Good\nevening, Mrs. Rath. And she says, How are you? And she knows his name. And he\nsays, I'm just checking the names. And he -- you know, Dr. Rubenstein, Captain Halpern\n-- or Major Halpern? And I said, Yes, lam. And we drive, and she says, Diane lives\nover here and so and so lives over here, and this is where -- and we drive up, and we're\ngoing to a dinner party at a Minister of Finance's house. And the door opens up, and I'm\nwearing a jacket. Everybody else is in evening culottes (ph). And there are Sehgals on\nthe wall and there's a Picasso on the wall, and they're not -- they're not copies. And she --this charming woman, she says, Darling, this 1s my friend Paul. He's with Dr. Kissinger.\nAnd she says to me, How's your -- how's your Hebrew? And I said, Nonexistent. And\nshe says -- I said, I speak a little -- I speak a little French. And she looks at me like\nphooey, you know. And she says, Just a moment. And she turns around and she says,\nLadies and gentlemen, in deference to our guest, English only, please. And the rest of the\nevening nobody spoke anything but English. And there was a cocktail party. There was\neverything. So Isit down. There's a very erect gentleman sitting next to me over here.\nThere are very erect gentlemen sitting over here. Absolutely military, no argument about\nit, sitting in close. And, remember, I am just the navigator for the airplane that carries\nKissinger's cars, but I'd been to Syria. I just came out of Damascus. And we start a\nconversation. And finally I said, Navy or Air Force? And he said, Army. And the other\nguy says, Navy. And I said, Gentlemen, I'm just a poor navigator, you know? I said, I\nam an information officer, as you know, and you know that I've talked to your people at -\n- at the airport. I've talked to your people, but there's nothing I can help you with, but I\nam honored that you would think that a poorly major -- you know. And they -- they had\njust decided to put two people next to me that wanted to talk about -- and I knew nothing\nabout Dr. Kissinger, except that he couldn't get it done. He was under a lot of pressure to\nget it done. His best friend, Joseph Alsop, died and he was supposed to be a pallbearer,\nand he wasn't allowed to come back. He had to get that peace mission. So he missed his\nbest friend's funeral because of that. But it was quite an experience. And Israel's seen as\na military man. And then I flew the Israeli airlift. I flewthe |= Yom Kippur War, and\nwe flew -- this is when our own country was told by our allies if we had trouble -- we\nflew out of the Azores, nonstop with a double crew carrying equipment to Tel Aviv, to\nLod. Lod. Ben Gurion. And we were told, in case of emergency, we could not land in\nSpain or France or anywhere. And they put their ranger, which is an American aircraft\ncarrier, in the middle of the Mediterranean, and that was out, and they said -- so the\nquestion was: Do you -- are you gonna control us? What if we need to land? Put it in\nthe Mediterranean. And we said, This airplane swims like a stone. So every one of us\nsaid, If we're in trouble, the first time that the French are gonna know that we're on their\nrunways 1s when we land. We're just gonna put it down. We could see Italian and\nFrench bases coming down the Mediterranean. We were gonna land. So we were\ncoming this way, and Aeroflot, the Soviets, were coming this way, and they were going\nto -- they were going to Egypt and we were going this way, and they were coming in.\nAnd, you know, English is the language of the -- of international air, and these Russian\npilots had terrible command of the English language. And they would call Cypress and\nthey would say, Cypress Control, this is -- this is Aeroflot so and so, and Cypress would\nstart to talk to them, and we'd hid our microphones and just block out -- block out that\ntransmission. And we drove them crazy. And finally, Cypress Control said, Military\naircraft in the vicinity of such and such a position, stop your transmissions. Because they\nknew we were doing that, you know, because we were just flying. It was -- and we got to\n-- we got to -- we got to -- you know, where Egypt -- Israel, and the Mirages came up for\nus and the migs came up for the -- and we could see each other. And we just landed.\nAnd they turned us around. You know, they turned us around immediately. And they\nhad taken all the first class seats out of the -- out of the LR Air-Cranes (ph) and all thestewardesses, and so we were crew members, and I said, Just leave us your loadmaster\nand you guys -- and we'd like to get something to eat. And we had fresh orange juice and\nthis and that. You know, we had a -- we had a wonderful time. And they knew more\nabout our airplanes, how to load our 141s, than our people did. And within two hours, all\nour flight plans were filed for us, all the weights and measurements were done, you\nknow, our pilots had signed off. And we knew how to get home, you know;\nMediterranean, head east, head west. And I did -- the total mission was like 20 hours\neach time, and we would drop things off and we would pick things up and bring them\nback to the Azores. And the lead commander of the Israeli Yom Kipper War airlift was a\ncolonel who was the deputy commander at my base, and I was a speech writer besides\nbeing a navigator, and his name was Wrigley. Like Wrigley -- Wrigley like W-r-i-g-l-e-\ny. He was a full colonel and he knew me because I used to write speeches for he and the\ngeneral. And we had a Jewish pilot. We -- you know, military airlift command, you\ndon't fly set crews. You just -- two pilots, two navi -- you know. And he came to me,\nand he says -- his name is Steve Tirshen (ph) -- and Steve said, You know, we could\nmake an all-Jewish crew. Do you think we could get the first crew into Tel Aviv? And I\nwent to Colonel Wrigley, and I said to him, Steve Tirshen -- and Bob Rowe's (ph) the\nnavigator and he's got a Jewish copilot and he can get a Jewish navigator. Bob was a\nnavigator who I knew for years. They want to be the number one aircraft. And Wrigley\nsaid, Okay. Just like that. And he was a -- he was a -- he was an Ekta (ph) goy, you\nknow. He -- and he -- so they put this airplane at number one air plan on this Erma and\nwas gonna be this all-Jewish crew. And I remember the pilot's name. His name wasSteve Tirshen. And they took off and they lost an engine. And they had to dump -- they\nhad to dump out over the Mediterranean -- over the -- over the Azores, South Atlantic,\nand make a turn and come back in again, and Wrigley went to number five in -- in line.\nNumber two and three were ready to go and number five was just getting ready. He put -\n- he -- he hopped in the truck and he said to the crew, Take number five. And he let them\n-- he couldn't give them the number one, but he gave them the first open air plan, which I\nthought was, you know, a real nice touch for a military man, you know. I was number\nfour crewman, and I flew with a bunch of -- a bunch of goys. But we went in and we --\nthe first time, and it -- and then we had 12 hours on the ground. We were two crews.\nAnd we were coming down the Mediterranean, and the Ranger said to us, You've got\ncompany. And we look up and there are two Algerian migs sitting on our wing. And\nthey're -- they're flying real close to us, and they're going like this, and \u201cblah,\u201d you know,\nand all we do is we take -- we always have a camera, and we were just taking pictures\nand -- you know, the official -- and they were fully voiced, and the Ranger said, You\nguys want company? We said, We'd appreciate it. And we look up and there were two\nNavy F-4s appeared, and the -- look up and these F-4s are sitting directly above the two\nmigs. And the F-4s let down there, their props had slowly come down like this, and these\nguys are looking like this, and they're on our wing. And they finally got here and they\naccelerated and went on their way. And the Ranger said, I think they've left. We said,\nYeah. Thank you very much for the help. And he did -- great stories that are -- never get\ntold. You know, I don't know if I'm -- I'm not breaking protocol because I'm not telling\nyou any of the procedures, but it was -- it made me feel like a good Jew. You know, it --it -- and I -- I was gone about 10 days, and on the last day they said, Who -- who's -- and\nthey -- some of us were rotating out, and they brought us -- there -- I must have had 10\ndozen baby roses, just -- and we flew home -- flew -- flew to Lajes where we were flying\nout of, the Azores, and I kept those in the -- in the flight kitchen. And 12 hours later, we\nflew home. And I got home at 4:00 in the morning. 4:00 in the morning. And I filled the\nsink, and the roses were still tight, and I dropped the roses in the sink to let them soak all\nnight, and I went to bed. And two days later, I'm -- I'm -- I'm at synagogue. It was one of\nthe holidays. It was Yom Kip -- it was -- it was Yom Kippur. The Yom Kippur War --\nit was right after Yom Kippur, and it must have been Sukkot, because my -- my -- my\nwife's yossi (ph) is Sukkot. And the rabbi's talking about how we must help because he\nhears things are terrible, you know, and I'm sitting in the back -- I've been there. I just\ncame back. I just came back from there, and I can't say anything about it, you know.\nCan't say anything about it at all. But that's what good Jews -- it was great.",
        "A: Again, all that has more religious and efficous (ph) than it did as before. It was -- like\nI say, when I lecture, I lecture. When I give talks, I talk about a five-year-old, a\nsix-year-old child and its impressions of -- of the Nazis and -- you know, and how it's --\nyou know, that's -- that's different than --\nPause in Proceedings",
        "A: The significance --",
        "A: I said it was -- I said it was -- it is my life, because I -- the Kindertransport saved my\nlife. I know that. But it -- it didn't affect me as a Jew. The older I get and the more\nintrospective I get and the fact that most of my -- my kids, they all were bar mitzvahed\nbut they're -- they're assimilated Jews more than anything else, and they -- I -- I've\nbecome more and more introspective about it. And I'm still -- because I lost my wife, I'm\nnot much of a -- I'm not much of a churchgoer, you know? But at the same time,\nethnically, I'm a very strong Jew, and I feel -- I feel very close -- close to what's going on.\nAnd I think that probably I -- I could probably do the Holocaust Museum -- I could do the\nmuseum. I hadn't been there. I've been to the one in Richmond because my son does a\nlot of work with them, but we'll probably give it a shot. I may -- I'll go there. I'm slowly\ncoming to -- to terms with it. You know, I'm 78 -- I'm gonna be 78 years old. I don't feel\nlike it, but -- so I always kid with this -- this lady I go out with now, and I always say,\nYou know, 20 years from now we're gonna -- and she says, Well, I may be here, you\nknow, because she's only 70. But I'm not looking to make a mark. I just -- I just want to\nunderstand more. And I'm getting there. I don't do a lot of reading about it because the\npeople who were there were too young to really understand. I didn't go -- you know, I --\nI talked to people who were -- who were in Auschwitz and who came out and some of my\nfriends are survivors who hidden -- who hid and were shot and things like this, and thepeople -- they were all young people, and young people don't think like us old people. In\nretrospect, I'm beginning to understand more. And you -- see, you have the advantage of\nwatching me have this experience, and -- but if you were experiencing it right now, 50\nyears from now it's gonna be a different thing because you're gonna say is, Oh, that's\nwhat scarred me; Oh, that's why I'm affected. And all these little crazy things like\nknowing -- having had a friend who ate paper, but yet that was a manifestation of a child\nneeding attention, a Jewish kid away from home, but I didn't think about it like that. My\nfriend, Wolf (ph), ate paper, you know? I flushed my teddy bear down the toilet, you\nknow? I'm just saying, Hey, somebody look over here, you know? But you don't know\nthat as it's going on. You do things and then why did you do it? But it makes life a lot of\nfun. And, look, I'm a journalist and I -- I'm published. I've -- I've written articles and I've\nwritten -- you know, but at the same time, I cannot sit down and write this stuff down.\nAnd I've told you a lot of stuff. Like this story about my father and the passports, it's a\nmagnificent story. Any Jewish newspaper, if I write it well, would pick it up.",
        "A: I don't have the right words for it. I don't have the right respect for it. And I'm good.\nI mean, I can -- I can write. I was a journalist. I'm a sports writer. I can write features.\nYou know why? I've become too close to it. You tell me -- you could -- you told me that\nstory, I could write it, like you probably could write this, too. It's just not -- and even\nthough I'm a gadgeteer, you know, and I have full command of computers and I have full\ncommand of digital, I have upstairs a Sony tape recorder, which I was gonna take withme to listen, because -- but it's electronic and I can't do electronic. I'm a typewriter guy,\nyou know\u201d?",
        "A: And even on the computer. I have trouble on the computer because it's too easy. And,\nyou know, I -- I now have -- I just bought Nuance. I bought voice so I can -- I -- it can\ntype, and I find myself reading and saying, That's not how you spell that, instead of\nsaying, Just get it done. And I have troubles. I have started five or six recollections\nabout my father and about my -- my -- can't finish them. Because the people I lecture to\non -- and I haven't done it in about three years because I was busy with my wife. They\nwant to hear a five year old. They want to hear the story that a five year old -- from a\nfive-year-old aspect that -- they want to hear the fact that I remember riding my bicycle,\nthat I was so -- not that I was so affluent that I -- I could ride my bicycle in the dining\nroom, but the fact that I was a kid and this is how Holocaust affected me originally was I\nrode my bicycle around and I -- I -- I had a good father. It was cold one night and we still\nhad our nanny, and in our -- my sister and I had a room and there was a potbelly stove in\nthe room, you know? It was just as a convenience. And my -- and my nanny lit a fire\nand burned up about $50,000 worth of money that my father had put away for emergency\nescape funds. You know, those -- but the -- but when I tell that story to people, they say,\nWell, that's a lot of -- it's entertaining. The Holocaust was not entertaining, even though I\ntell it that way. And I tell my grandkids, Dying hurts and there's no rerun from it, you\nknow? You know, bang, bang, bang, you're dead, and this and that, and they shoot -- all\nthe shoot 'em up games and, yeah, but if you come away from this game with the aspectthat you can do something really reckless and once that game is over you can go back and\ndo it -- undo it, you can't do it. You get a shot -- you know, particularly -- I tell a joke,\nWatch yourself when you fly. I said, Dying hurts. And -- you know, and I -- not that I --\nI've been told. Nobody has come back to tell me, but I know it does. And, Just be\ncareful. And -- but that's not how life lives. The bottom line is: Be careful. Be careful.\nBut we weren't careful. And, you know, kids today -- if I tried to thrust one of my kids\non the train, he would probably pop me one. But we went because mom said we -- you\nknow, mom and dad took me to the -- took me to the -- and Oma took me to the train. It's\na different world. It's a different world.",
        "A: My kids know it. My kids know it. I made them -- I -- I was principal speaker at --\nmy synagogue did a Holocaust Memorial Garden, and a couple of -- couple of state\nsenators were there and so on, and I gave this little speech. It was real funny. They told\nme -- asked me if I would do this, and I said, Okay. And I sat down to write the basic\nspeech, and I hadn't -- I hadn't done Kindertransport speeches yet. And I said, How much\ntime do I have? And they said, Oh, about five minutes. I said, Just forget it. I said, If\nyou're gonna -- just so that that -- that state senator can -- can babble on about how\nwonderful you people are -- he had an Irish name -- I'm not -- I'm not playing second\nfiddle. This is a memorial -- Holocaust memorial thing. If you don't want to hear it --\nWell, how much time you need? I said, I just ran it through. It's 30 minutes. Oh, that's\nway too long. I said, Okay. 20? They said, Okay. And I did 35 minutes, you know\u2019?\nBut I said to my kids, Do me a favor -- and they weren't a member of my synagogue --check me out. See how I'm doing, because I'm gonna be giving this talk at your schools\npretty soon. So -- and they said they love it. And 35 minutes is good because school\nsessions are 40 minutes, you know, so I could -- I -- I haven't done it lately, and -- but\nBetty and I did teach reading in Camden. She wanted to teach reading to adults. And\nthen, of course, when she -- when she had the stroke, she couldn't -- for transportation.\nSo we taught first grade and second grade reading. And when Betty -- and when Betty\ndied, we -- people said, What do we donate to? And we said, the Elizabeth Halpern\nReaders Fund. And we got a lot of money, and we went to that Puerto Rican school or\nHispanic school in Camden where we had taught reading, we said, What do you need?\nAnd every year we give them $500 worth of Readers Club books. And just the other day,\nI went back -- for Rosh Hashanah, I went back to Lionsgate. And we have this wonderful\nrabbi who was my rabbi when he came out of reconstruction school, and he has done this\nsiddur just for us, you know, abbreviated session, and he's really -- and the auxiliary had\ngiven him the money for it. But, you know, they're gonna need more and more. So |\nwent over and I said, I want to give you money for this. And I gave them a check -- I\nremember the people at that Lionsgate gave money to my wife's fund, the Readers Club,\nand I took -- just gave them $300 from the Elizabeth Halpern Readers Club to buy more\nsiddurs, because that's reading. That's reading. You know? That's not -- that's not what\nthe original intent was. I ran -- and I -- I funded -- I funded -- I bring it up to a thousand\ndollars every year, and it's only been two -- she's only been gone -- second anniversary.\nBut we came down and I took it up to a thousand, and I said to her -- I said, Let me give\nyou a couple hundred dollars and give me a check for $300 and I'll -- because that wayit's tax free for you, you know, and it's tax free for me. And I just thought it was a -- and\nshe -- he said, Well, it already says who -- I said, Who cares? You know, I just -- you\nknow, I like to do things like that.",
        "A: I'm all -- if I want to sum it up, I -- Iam content. I am -- I don't want to die, but we all\ndo. That's too bad. I -- I hope -- I hope to continue on for -- you know, I -- I want to be\nshot by a jealous husband and during the act, you know? I mean, that's -- but \u2014 that's --\nthat's not gonna happen. But I feel very -- I'm -- I'm content. I look at -- I've got three\nproductive children. Two of them are married correctly. The other one is a good mother.\nThey all had bought into education. The name's gonna go on. And for that,\nKindertransport, my name is on because my sister's name is gone. I mean, you know, she\n-- her married name, but she's gone. But Halpern goes on because of my -- my nine\ngrandsons, six of them who -- three \u2014 yes, six of them have my name. The other -- the\nothers are -- so I feel that I've accomplished something. I mean, you know, nothing --\nnothing big deal, but without Kindertransport, I'm not here. I'm not a dedicated -- you\nknow, maybe I got too much of my mother in me. I -- I enjoy life, you know, a little bit.\nBut I get angry, and I get -- I get angry because Rwanda happens and I get angry when\nSarajevo happens, and I get overenthusiastic when Chile happens because, you know,\nthere is solution -- there are solutions to this stuff. I'm -- I just -- I just want -- I just want\nto be remembered my -- you know, Your grandpa was nuts, you know? You know, or\nmy kids -- I want my -- my grandkids to say, He was a nice guy. He was a friend. We\ncould have a beer together. Like I'm going to go have a beer with them at Founders --you know, Founding Fathers restaurant -- Founding Fathers. I didn't get what I'm -- I'm\nnot the greatest writer in the world, and -- but I guess -- I guess I did all right, and I guess\nI'm gonna do all right. I mean, I -- I --",
