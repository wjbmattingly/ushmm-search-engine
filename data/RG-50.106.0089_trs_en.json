        "A: October 9, 1928.",
        "Q: And place of birth?",
        "A: Berlin.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Would you talk about your parents and your grandparents.",
        "A: I only knew my maternal grandparents and they were gentle people but I also, they\nwere a bit forbidding. They didn\u2019t have a great way with children.",
        "Q: And their religion?",
        "A: They were Jewish.",
        "Q: And your mother?",
        "A: My mother as well was Jewish.",
        "Q: And what about your father and his parents?",
        "A: My father\u2019s father was Jewish but in those days you were German first and then\nwhatever religion you were. He happened to fall in love with a Christian girl and\nswitched religions in order to be able to marry her. He became a Christian.",
        "Q: Yeah, in order to be able to marry her because of her parents or\u2014",
        "A: Now this is something I do not know. I don\u2019t know. This was quite a long time ago.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: But you were just told that he could not marry her unless he converted but you don\u2019t\nknow why.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether it was a must situation or whether it was just something he\nchose to do. Probably her parents might have objected but I don\u2019t know any of those\ncircumstances.",
        "Q: So your father was raised Christian.",
        "A: Yes. Although secularly really. Observing the major holidays but nothing much in\nbetween.",
        "Q: And do you know whether he was Catholic or Protestant.",
        "A: No, no Protestant.",
        "Q: Protestant. Lutheran or \u2014",
        "A: Yes, Lutheran Protestant. So he\u2014",
        "Q: Protestant Lutheran.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And so his family were secular Lutherans and were not very observant, as far as you\nknow.",
        "A: I wish I could tell you. But you know my father was already 40 when I was born. His\nparents were long dead. I never knew them. AII I knew was the stories he told me.",
        "Q: And what kinds of stories did he tell you?",
        "A: Well I mean the history of the fact that he never knew his mother. Only after she died,\nhe heard some aunt saying the poor boy and that was actually his first memory. He does\nnot remember his mother. She was the Christian. And his father, he was extremely close\nto, very, very, he loved him and honored and respected him. In fact all during my\nchildhood not, not a day would pass that he wouldn\u2019t mention his papa. In one nice way\nor another.",
        "Q: So you had an idea of him, even though you didn\u2019t know him.",
        "A: Oh I saw photos of him. A very, a man, with very big eyes and worried looking. He\nhad been widowed so very early and was never remarried you know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: So your father was Lutheran and your mother was Jewish.",
        "A: Jewish.",
        "Q: And what was your household like? Did your family\u2014",
        "A: Well. My parents were not church goers or temple goers as such. My mother\nsometimes with friends might go to temple for high holy days, Jewish high holy days.\nBut other than that she never did and my father simply was not a church goer, although\nhe was a very religious man. When I was a teenager I spoke to him once and he didn\u2019t\nanswer me, didn\u2019t answer me. And after about five minutes, he looked at me and he said\nI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t answer you, I was praying. That was his religion and it was very deep.\nBut he was not a church goer. But he accomplished miracles as you will later find out.\nAnd I\u2019m sure it had something to do with his relationship he had with the higher being.",
        "Q: And were you baptized?",
        "A: I was actually baptized. And you know I was young child. No, no I mean I wasn\u2019t a\ntoddler or an infant. I was already, I can\u2019t remember how old I was. Maybe five,\nsomething like that. And they decided that I should be baptized. And we went to Pastor\nNeemuler\u2019s church but he was not there. Someone else baptized me but with water from\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe Rubes spray in Berlin. And I remember we came home from that and my mother had\na close Jewish girlfriend who heartily disapproved. She thought it was just terrible. And\nshe told them that. But then she invited them in for coffee and cake to celebrate.",
        "Q: So this would have been in 1933 about.",
        "A: Probably. Or a little later. I don\u2019t know whether I was, I cannot remember what age I\nwas. I might have been older than, probably they might have done it a little later when\nthings were beginning to look really bad. 33 was still fairly early, you know. I wasn\u2019t\naware of what was really happening.",
        "Q: But some persecution had started in 1933.",
        "A: Yes and you know you have these roving bands of Brown Shirts, singing anti-Semitic\nsongs and torch parades. A little bit awesome and scary, that sort of thing.",
        "Q: So you had a baptismal certificate?",
        "A: If I ever had one, I don\u2019t think I ever saw it. Honestly. My mother must, I don\u2019t know.\nI just, ve never seen it.",
        "Q: Do you think that if you were baptized that one existed.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: This being Germany, you can be darned sure. They had documentation for everything.",
        "Q: So you went to school.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: To a public school?",
        "A: A public school until a certain time period, later in the 30s. When Jewish children\nwere no longer allowed in public school. And under the logic of the Nazis they had me\nfigured out as being three-fourths Jewish. So I went for a time, only for a time cause then\nwe left Germany, to a private Jewish school.",
        "Q: You said they had you figured out. Who\u2014",
        "A: The Nazis.",
        "Q: The Nazis. And how did they know that you were \u2014",
        "A: It would be like city hall. You know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: So they would have traced who your grandparents were.",
        "A: Yes, mm hm, well anything is documented so they knew exactly everyone\u2019s, they\nknew my roots better than I did.",
        "Q: So you had to leave the public schools. Do you remember that?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what was that like for you? To have to leave?",
        "A: Distressing. Scary. All of a sudden I was taken out of my, although I must tell you,\nthat the public school was no longer a pleasure. There was one teacher who was very\nanti-Semitic and was perfectly beastly to us Jewish children.",
        "Q: What did the teacher do?",
        "A: Oh it was just her sharpness and her nastiness. I don\u2019t remember details. Very quick to\nslap faces, things like that.",
        "Q: Do you remember your face being slapped?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Yes, mm hm.",
        "Q: And did you tell your parents?",
        "A: Well it was the custom in Europe for the teachers to do that. It wasn\u2019t, I mean, now it\nwould be a shocking thing, but in those days it was done.",
        "Q: There were other Jewish children in your class?",
        "A: You know that is vague to me. I don\u2019t really remember any particular Jewish, none of\nus children really paid attention to our different religion. We were just kids together. And\nI to this day I could not tell you who was Jewish and who wasn\u2019t. I think there probably\nwere more non-Jewish children in that class. There may have been a handful besides\nmyself.",
        "Q: Did you think of yourself as Jewish?",
        "A: I always thought of my, thanks to the Nazis, I thought of myself as three-fourths\nJewish and one-fourth Christian.",
        "Q: And what did you think that meant, being Jewish?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Being three-fourths of one religion and one-fourth of another religion.",
        "Q: So what did Jewish in particular mean to you?",
        "A: I wish I could really explain it to you. Later upon maturity, I realized much more\nabout what it means.",
        "Q: But as a child.",
        "A: As a child it was just a religion that for some reason wasn\u2019t popular at that time in that\ncountry. I was just a child.",
        "Q: So you had to leave the public school.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did the Jewish children in your class go with you to the same Jewish school.",
        "A: No. I remember going to this Jewish school which was in a nice suburb there, called\nRosentav, which means valley of roses. And not really now wait a minute. That may not\nhave been there. But the lady, my mother\u2019s best friend whom I stayed with for a while,\nshe lived in Rosentav. I remember having to take a bus in the mornings to get to the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nschool. I can\u2019t tell you to this day where it was. But it was a very nice school and\neveryone there was Jewish and they were all new faces to me. So.",
        "Q: Was the curriculum very different from the public school?",
        "A: The one big difference was that I had to learn Hebrew, which was very difficult and of\ncourse, I never really learned it. I just learned some of the symbols and how to\npronounce them and how to read them. But you know that time period could not have\nlasted very long because I didn\u2019t do that very long. And it was must be shortly thereafter\nthat we left. That means in other words, that I didn\u2019t leave the German public school.\nWell I left Germany in 39. Probably 38.",
        "Q: That you left the public school.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So you were about ten.",
        "A: I think I was nine. I was ten when I left. Yeah.",
        "Q: What else do you remember from that time about what your life was like?\nA: Well there was one little instance. I was down, I don\u2019t know if it was Vonnzee, that\ngreat big bathing resort, outside of Berlin. I was at the beach. And playing in the sand\nand a little girl came over and she said may I play with you. And I was just about to say\nyes when she added but not if you\u2019re Jewish. My mommy doesn\u2019t let me play with\nJewish children. So I said well I am, or you can\u2019t or something. And that was the end of\nthat. But I remember it to this day. And I\u2019m now 67. But you must admit that that is,\nothers had much worse experiences. And, and even though this was a small thing, it was\na pin prick that lasted. Let me see what else. Well you just wanted me to tell you about\nthings that went on around me and my reactions to them.",
        "Q: Sure",
        "A: Well there were Hitler\u2019s speeches on the loudspeakers in the streets. I would hear this\nmale voice shouting and of course his Austrian accent. I never was able to understand a\nword that the man was shouting. He could have been talking another language. I didn\u2019t\nunderstand what he said. And there were all sorts of things in the newspapers which of\ncourse I didn\u2019t read but I heard my father and my mother discussing them at home in the\nevening. And he would you know furrow his brow and be very worried and he always\nthought that this couldn\u2019t last. This was just something that would go away.",
        "Q: This is your father.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: My father. Sorry, my father. And he just couldn\u2019t believe that this madness could\nstay and they would be talking. There was a current joke that went around in Berlin that\nit ended with the Jews and the bicyclists. And the question would be why the bicyclists.\nAnd then the answer would be why the Jews. And that time it was one of the current\njokes. It sounds better in German. And let me see what else. It was just a general\nfeeling of, I don\u2019t know, something dark surrounding us. And of course, shall I go on\nabout when my father left or do you want to ask me that later.",
        "Q: Well before we get to that, what was your father\u2019s occupation.",
        "A: All right. He had his own export import firm and then he hired a new secretary and\nthis was my mother to be. And, they, she was his secretary for about four years and it\nwas a one man company. And of course no, he had people that worked for him but they\nwere salesmen. It was export import and it was doing quite nicely.",
        "Q: What export",
        "A: I, [remember he had British Yardley\u2019s so and things like that. All sort of different\nthings. And everything went along well. My parents got married after they had known\neach other for four years. I was born the next year. By then it was 1928. And his\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbusiness folded. Times were bad. Horrible. And he ended up scrounging around for all\nsorts of different jobs.",
        "Q: Now was the business folding, was that a result of persecution.",
        "A: I believe so. I don\u2019t know. I think it was the economic climate. I don\u2019t know if it was\na depression that had touched Germany. As well. I\u2019m not clear about the economic\nreasons. I just know that before I was born, or while I was still an infant this business was\nno longer supporting him.",
        "Q: If his father was born Jewish, was he considered a Jew?",
        "A: You mean his father.",
        "Q: No your father\u2019s father was born Jewish. So was your father considered a Jew by the\nNazis?",
        "A: Yes. For the same reason that I was considered three fourths Jewish, he was\nconsidered one half Jewish yes.",
        "Q: I wondered whether that \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: He had been in World War I. He had gotten the Iron Cross, second class and he had\nbeen a patriotic German and he was 40 when I was born. He had had a very happy young\nmanhood in Berlin, enjoying himself. Enjoying life in Germany. And all this came like a\nbad dream and he couldn\u2019t believe that it was going to last.",
        "Q: So backing up a bit, there was bad economic times and his business got into bad\ntrouble and so then what happened?",
        "A: Oh he scrounged around. He sold vacuum cleaners. He was a wine salesman. You see\nhis great gift was salesmanship. He used to, his nickname was Fredl. They used to joke\nFredl could sell refrigerators to Eskimos. He really could. And so he kept us afloat with\nthat. And my mother, when I was older, she went and got herself a job at something\ncalled the Palestina Unt. The office for Palestine, a Jewish organization, near where we\nlived. And she had a regular office job there, secretarial. And she had that job actually\nuntil we left. Oh, but before she got that, she tried everything. And I\u2019m going to jump\nahead and say when my dad left.",
        "Q: Ok.",
        "A: She took on a job as a housekeeper for a very nice well-to-do Jewish family and it\nwas really nice because there was a young woman there who she became very good\nfriends with. And her grandfather, the young woman\u2019s grandfather and her mother who\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nseemed to be a little bit retarded. Some kind of emotional problems. Her grandfather\nwas a marvelous old gentleman and they sort of adopted me as the child of the house, and\nspoiled me. And my mother did cleaning and cooking and it was something she\u2019d never\ndone before but she was really great, very adaptable and hardworking, just to keep us\ngoing.",
        "Q: So she was doing this to support you.",
        "A: Yes and also we started out in a lovely apartment when I was born. Then we went to a\nslightly less wonderful apartment. And finally ended up in a furnished room. Things\nwere really, really bad. We were poor.",
        "Q: So going back to your father leaving. How did that come about?",
        "A: All right. This was still before Kristallnacht. But things were bad and he was\nstruggling and one day a letter came from City Hall to present himself in the next day\nwith his passport. And he knew something was up. He was very intelligent and aware,\neven though he couldn\u2019t believe that this would last but he knew that things were getting\ndangerous.",
        "Q: What did he think that was all about?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well I'll tell you. At that time my mother was already employed at the Palestina Unt.\nYeah, I get confused. He called her at work. And he said Edith, come home and help me\npack. Tonight I have to leave Germany. And he explained that they wanted him to\npresent himself with his passport at City Hall and he knew what that meant. They were\ngoing to put a J in it for Jew, which would mean that his traveling would be severely\ncurtailed if not made impossible. And he decided he was going to flee that night. Get out\nof there.",
        "Q: Before they put a J on his passport.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And so how did he leave?",
        "A: Well. I think he went to his great aunt Matilda and borrowed some, she was the\nChristian part of the family and quite well off. And she lent him some money and he, I\nthink he took a train to um, somehow he found -- there was two places he went to. He\nwas in Amsterdam and he was in London, trying to find a stepping stone. I\u2019m a little\nconfused where he went first. And then eventually he ended up briefly in New York to\ngain a foothold. But in order to enter legally into the United States, he needed a quota\nnumber, visa. And so in those days, people in that position would either go to Canada.\nSome ended up in China. In Shanghai. And he opted or maybe it was the only choice hehad to go to Havana Cuba, to wait for this and so that\u2019s what happened. In the meantime,\nwe had a year without him. And I must tell you he was a marvelous cook. He was a great\ncook and he had made a bouillabaisse his last day and I remember after he had left, he\nhad left in the evening. And I don\u2019t quite know what mode of transportation. He must\nhave taken the train to Hamburg, to take the boat over to England, something like that.\nThere we were with his soup that he had left. And I remember my mother and I eating\nthat soup and the tears were just rolling down our cheeks. And for many, many, many\nyears, I couldn\u2019t stand bouillabaisse. I just couldn\u2019t stand. Then much later on I\ndeveloped a real liking for it because we were together again. That was something. It was\na terrible shock to have him gone all of a sudden. But he saved himself and he saved us.\nBy that action.",
        "Q: So when he left you had some awareness of what was happening.",
        "A: OH a great deal of it. In fact fear was our constant companion. Because then we had\nKristallnacht. November ninth wasn\u2019t it? 1938. I believe. And my mother was a real\nBerliner. There\u2019s an expression in Berlin. If somebody comes at you all excited, we say\nNabublensten (German) which means oh so where\u2019s the fire? You know. So at 4:00 in\nthe morning or at 4:30 or 5 there\u2019s a pounding at the door. And my mother gets up out of\nher sleep. This is some time after my father left. I don\u2019t\u2019 know how long. And all grumpy\nand she goes to the door and opens it and she said so where\u2019s the fire? And the person\nknocking on the door said the temple across the street 1s on fire. The Jewish temple. Thiswas Fazanemistrasse. The corner had hotel Kampinski at it. That was the last address\nwe had in Berlin. And kitty corner from us across the street was the, a Jewish synagogue,\nwhich is now by the way the Jewish Community Center. I saw it in 1978. They did\nsomething very smart. They saved the front of this temple. It had been a beautiful\nbuilding. They saved the doorway and made a modern building for the Jewish\nCommunity Center, and put the doorway there. It was a striking and very beautiful thing.\nAnd the strange feelings come back after so many years and see that. But anyway to get\nback to that horrible night or morning. My mother must have gone out the door to take a\npeek at it. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember. She left me upstairs in bed or maybe I slept through all of\nthis. I don\u2019t know. And I remember. She stayed home that day. And I remember saying\noh how nice. You don\u2019t have to go to work. You\u2019re staying with me. And I remember her\nsad smile and she said but what a reason. I was too young to understand the horrible\nthings that were going on around me. And another really nightmare moment was we at\nthis time lived in a furnished room. And I in fact slept on a cot in the kitchen. It was a\nnice big old Berlin apartment and the lady who lived there was a wonderful old lady. Her\nname was Mrs. Moses. I think her first name was Martha. I\u2019m not sure. She had a\nretarded daughter, a little shriveled lady, must have been in her 40s or 50s, scared me\nterribly because I didn\u2019t know about retardation. But she was kindness itself, very old and\ntired looking. And she was very good to my mother and myself. She had some other\ntenants there too. She had her son living in the apartment above her. And_ I think it was\nthe day after the fire or very shortly thereabouts that there was talk of Jewish men being\nsearched for by hordes of SA men. You know those were the Brown Shirts. And therewas a brass door sign next to the apartment door. Outside the front door and it said\nMoses on it. That was her name. And some very smart person across the way said, you\nknow if I were you, I would unscrew those screws and take that sign off. It\u2019s a very\nJewish name. They\u2019re bound to come to you. And my mother was real feisty Berliner\nalways, said oh that\u2019s not necessary. She didn\u2019t want to do that. And the reason prevailed\nand they did it. And it\u2019s a darned good thing because later on we heard these boots on the\nstairs. My mother and I were inside the pantry. With her arms around me, shaking like\naspen leaves when we heard those pounding boots coming up the stairs. And we heard\nsomebody say \u201cOh, don\u2019t ring there. There\u2019s no Jews there\u201d and they went on up. I\nbelieve they got her son, either that time or later. And I don\u2019t know. She and her daughter\nmust have ended up dead. It was just dreadful. Anyhow, that is a moment that is\nprobably the most frightening moment of my life. And we crept out of the pantry. The\nNazis had gone. And then shortly thereafter 1t must have been that word came that we\nshould go to H\u2014from my father who had at this point reached Havana. And, and he said,\nhe wrote, go to Hamburg. Go to the Cuban consulate and get all your documentation and\nsoon I\u2019Il be able to send for you. And so my mother and I took the\u2014and early morning\ntrain. It was still dark, from Berlin to Hamburg.",
        "Q: Now this was right away, the next day.",
        "A: No. As a child your sense of time is really non-existent. It\u2019s fueled by events. I simply\ncannot tell you. It must have been shortly thereafter. I\u2019m sure. And so there we were. I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthought it was the greatest treat in the world to sit in the dining car, a little ship. No,\nwhite table cloths and silver and waiters. And I remember eating a soft boiled gg and\nlooking out the train window. I took my enjoyment where I found it you know. (laughs) I\nthought that was great. Well then we trudged through Hamburg and we went to the\nconsulate. Everything was fine. It was lunch time. And I was getting hungry. And my\nmother, everywhere she saw a restaurant it said Jews aren\u2019t wanted, forbidden to Jews.\nAnd she was a mother first and she decided the heck with all of this. She had young child\nhere and she was going to see to it that that child got some lunch. And so we just walked\ninto one of those restaurants and ate. And of course it didn\u2019t mean much to me but you\ncan imagine her feeling. And then shortly after that I was able to leave the school and\nhappy word came that \u2014",
        "Q: Wait a minute. You weren\u2019t\u2014did you go back to Berlin or did you stay in Hamburg.",
        "A: Oh yes, this was just a trip to get documentation from the Cuban consulate. And then\nshortly there\u2014",
        "Q: So you went right back to Berlin?",
        "A: We went right back to, to Berlin.",
        "Q: How long was the trip from Berlin to Hamburg?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: You\u2019re asking me something I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not, I can look at the map here. How\nfar is Hamburg from Berlin. Maybe\u2014let\u2019s see Hamburg.",
        "Q: So you did it in a day?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh my yes. It was several hours.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t have to stay overnight in Hamburg?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that. It must have just been a day trip, yes. And so then the\nwonderful word came that we would be able to leave. And do you want to ask, I mean\nanything else. Or should I go on to that now. Word came and my mother got ready.\nPrepared everything. You know now I have to go back to childhood memories, before I\ncontinue with this. Let me delve back. You know we started moving from one nice\napartment to one less nice, to one less nice, to a furnished room. I remember a lovely\nplace we had. Geisenhimerstrasse is the place. It was outside of Berlin and it was a\nlittle apartment with a balcony but it was on the ground floor. And I remember, at that\ntime I was four years old. And I was just starting, having this impulse to draw pictures.\nAnd so I remember sitting at a little table, on a little chair on this balcony. It had a hedge\naround it to separate it from the road. And I would sit there with paper and pencil and\nscribble and scribble happy as could be. I remember that clearly. The first apartment Iremember. In fact, my first memory was waking up from a sleep and my parents were in\nthe next room packing and we were going to Denmark the next day for a little trip. That\nwas my very first memory. I think I was three then or something.",
        "Q: So that was a happy time when you were a very small child.",
        "A: Oh yes, my parents were my world. I had no siblings and they were always absolutely\nwonderful parents. We had a happy relationship. Trouble free. And that, why did I go\ninto that-- oh later on when I came back with my mother in 78, we visited this apartment\nbecause that was the only place that held happy memories for me. It was raining cats and\ndogs and the apartment, the whole neighborhood was now filled with Turkish labor\nimmigrants. They, you know you\u2019ve read about the Turks that, and they were having a\nvery hard time and foreigner hating Germany you know. And there were these Turks in\nthat apartment. We couldn\u2019t make ourselves understood that we used to live here. That\nwe wanted to see it. It was a blank. And it was rainy. I felt heartbroken. I don\u2019t know why\nbut I felt so sad. Anyway that was\u2014I\u2019m digressing here. I went back into the past. Now\nthis, why did I do that now. What was I trying to tell you?",
        "Q: You started to talk about leaving Germany and then you went back to your early\nchildhood happy \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: It\u2019s not, leaving that neighborhood. We had to leave that apartment because we just\ndidn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t have any more money. And that\u2019s when the furnished room life started.\nAnd no I think there was one more apartment, high under the roof, which wasn\u2019t too bad.\nAnd then came the furnished room. But anyway, the day that we had to leave\nGeisenhimerstrasse, there was neighborhood Punch and Judy show. In German it\u2019s\ncalled Caspela Teata and all the neighborhood children were getting ready to sit and\nwatch it. And I had to leave. I had to drive away with my parents. That very time. And I\nfelt so bereft, you know. So that was a sad thing.",
        "Q: So it was in many ways difficult for you to leave your home?",
        "A: Well that home, yes. But then later, leaving Fazanemistrasse to go on the boat to\nCuba was unbelievable happiness. I was not sorry to leave that Germany.",
        "Q: Talk about that leaving.",
        "A: All right. I had to, I was never one for dolls but I had a lot of stuffed toys and\nparticularly I loved a white stuffed cat, beautiful little white stuffed cat with green glass\neye, a little pink nose and a moustache. I loved it. And for some reason, with all the\nexcitement of packing and getting ready to leave that got left behind. And I don\u2019t know\nwhether we were 1n a taxi to the train or 1n the train or what. All of a sudden I\nremembered and I said oh Mutti, I forgot the cat and can we go back and she said no, oh\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nno. I mean can you imagine in her mind going back and being snapped up. Of course\nnot. But you know to this day I have regrets about that stuffed cat. And other than that.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s stop here because I have to turn over the tape. (pause) This is a continuation of\nthe United States Holocaust Memorial museum volunteer collection interview with Ruth\nHarvey. Tape number one, side B. When we stopped you were talking about leaving\nyour animal behind.",
        "A: Well, it was not a living animal. It was a stuffed toy animal.",
        "Q: And how upsetting that was for you. To forget that and then you were telling me\nabout a painting that you did which you now have in front of you and the title of the\npainting is.",
        "A: Childhood memories. It is so strange. My art teacher suggested a subject because I\nwas at a standstill. She said why don\u2019t you paint your childhood memories. And it\nunleashed a torrent in me and it had a very odd result. I had been planning a trip through\nthe Rhine country, a picturesque German towns along the river. When I got through\npainting this painting, I had gotten so closely back into my childhood self, that I was\ntotally unable to go to Germany. And I changed my travel plans and went to Greece\ninstead.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: So you had a lot of very strong feelings.",
        "A: Oh my lord yes, and you know it was catharsis. It just came out.",
        "Q: To do the painting?",
        "A: As I did the painting yes.",
        "Q: Could you describe some of the things in the painting?",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019d be happy to. Down here you see this cornucopia with the colorful objects.",
        "Q: This is in the lower right hand",
        "A: The lower right. I\u2019m going to go from the lower right hand. Now in Germany when\nchildren reached school age their loving families present them with these cardboard\ncornucopias filled with candy. This is a German tradition for your first day of school. I\nremember mine was just somewhere, I have a photo of myself with that in my arms. It\nwas like this big. And it was filled with candy, and but this year symbolizes. It\u2019s lying on\nthe ground with all these colors spilled out of it. And I think of that as my spoiled\nchildhood.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Spoiled childhood?",
        "A: Yes. Spilled, spoiled yes.",
        "Q: What do you mean spoiled childhood?",
        "A: Well instead of having a normal childhood, going through the normal schools in the\nnormal way, it took all sorts of odd twists and turns and humiliations and scares and that\nsort of thing.",
        "Q: And what else in the painting is especially important to you?",
        "A: Now you see there a little girl with her arms outstretched floating after a white toy cat.\nThat\u2019s the story I told before, that to this day I\u2019m searching for that.",
        "Q: Over here and you can speak into the microphone.",
        "A: Thank you, yes. So that is there. To the right of it is the Punch and Judy show. If you\nlook at it very closely there\u2019s a devil with a pitchfork and horns. These are all red. And\nthere\u2019s Caspela or Punch as he was called in English with his stick and his pointy cap\nand his red nose. And later on when I was all filled anew with, with fury at what hadhappened, I somehow thought of the Punch as a typical stupid German and the devil\nmainly Hitler or Goebbels leading him on. I thought of that later, with an adult mind,\nfairly recently. As a child I just thought of it as Punch and Judy but somehow it fits into\nthat painting. You know, for that reason. Now to the left of this you see a black\nrectangle, with a white bulb on the top and you see two shapes. A large female shape and\na small female shape. Clutching each other. And that was my mother and I in the pantry\nclutching each other in deadly fear. Behind it you see gray steps going up and a large red\nswastika behind it. That was the sound we heard of the Nazi boots on the stairs. Now if\nthere\u2019s anything else in here that you want to ask me about.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that is particularly emotional for you?",
        "A: Well all right. Emotional. It\u2019s both good and bad. Here you see a gray ship going\nthrough the ocean, bravely headed in a new direction. And that was the German ship the\nOrenachal and my mother and I were lucky to get tickets on that. We were in fourth\nclass, steerage. We were down in a down below in a huge room shared with many other\nwomen. I think there were 40 of them and lower bunks and upper-- my mother and I of\ncourse were together I think it was a lower bunk. And what she had done, brave lady,\nwe had a wonderful oil painting. It\u2019s right over there. It\u2019s a self-portrait of a great, great\ngrandfather of mine who had artistic talent. And he did this painting of himself in the\nearlier part of the 19\" century. And so she took it out of the frame because this was the\none true antique that we had of great sentimental value, a self-portrait of an ancestor. And\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nshe rolled it up and we slept with it between us in a cardboard roll. That was the one thing\nshe managed to get out. You know. And now it\u2019s hanging there. Anyhow that was a\npretty unpleasant trip. I mean the sleeping conditions \u2014 the food wasn\u2019t too bad. It was\nsimple but good. And I as a child enjoyed everything. The adults of course are worried\nsick and uncomfortable.",
        "Q: You were on a German ship.",
        "A: Yes and in fact there\u2019s something in there I\u2019m going to tell you about, yes, because the\nfirst \u2014 ok, this here what you see here is \u2014",
        "Q: We were talking about the painting yeah the upper right hand corner of the painting.",
        "A: And I\u2019m still in the middle here. There\u2019s a black and white tile floor. There are tables\nwith white table cloths, an elegant French door, palm trees, or palm bushes in pots. Very\nelegant salon. Well there was a lady on the ship who was a very well to do Jewish lady\nand she was traveling first class. My mother and she were acquainted. And one day she\ninvited us up to first class for tea. Now we had been for quite some time down in the\nhold. And here I am a little girl. And when we went up there I heard violin music playing\nand waiters scurrying by with trays. And I saw all this luxury and it made a very deep\nimpression on me. It really did. The next picture you see is a man, my father, wearing his\nblue bow tie, white shirt, and gray pants with his arms raised in the air, and he\u2019s standing\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nunder a palm tree and bidding us welcome. Very welcoming figure. And were we ever\nhappy to see him. And then it goes on the painting swirls up to the right above and there\u2019s\nlittle girls floating around. Those were the little girls I became friends with once we\nsettled in Cuba. And they were very lovely. And of course I didn\u2019t speak Spanish and\nthey didn\u2019t speak German. But I managed to learn both Spanish and English, at least\nstarting to while I had that year and a half in Havana. And the end of the painting at the\nupper right, you see these white towers, skyscrapers. You see the stars in the sky turning\ninto the stars in the American flag and this was the land of our dreams, which I didn\u2019t\u2019\nknow yet. And I saw these miraculous skyscrapers up there and we had to get there. And\nthat was the idealized version of it. That pretty well describes everything.",
        "Q: Oh that\u2019s a very interesting painting.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: Can we go back and fill in some of the details of your trip. You and your mother were\nin the taxi cab going to the train.",
        "A: Or whatever conveyance, yes.",
        "Q: And then you got to the train station in Berlin.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Oh that is no, I don\u2019t\u2019 remember those things.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t.",
        "A: No, I just remember I have never had a terribly good memory. I just remember the\nemotional parts or the dramatic parts. How I got somewhere, how long it took, this is all\ngray area. It\u2019s something I honestly don\u2019t know. At that time I was about nine years old.",
        "Q: Do you remember on the ship, the Oronoco, it was a German ship and I think you had\nsaid it sailed from Hamburg?",
        "A: Yes, to Havana. Oh and we stopped in Antwerp once. All I remember there are houses\nwith blue tiles. We stopped there shortly.",
        "Q: Do you remember on the ship whether you were treated differently being Jewish?",
        "A: The German crew for the fourth class were very decent. Nobody ever was rude or\nnasty. They were very decent and in fact my father always had high regard for the\nGerman navy. Men who were at sea. He had wanted to become a naval officer but his\nastigmatism kept him from that. And no, no there was not one instance of any kind of\nrudeness or mistreatment. They were other very interesting Jewish people who were\nprofessional people who were also down there in steerage and we enjoyed each other\u2019s\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncompany. And I had photo of that little girl with a scarf and a little sailor doll. We must\nhave bought on board, looking as happy as could be.",
        "Q: Were most of the other passengers Jewish?",
        "A: The people down at that level certainly were.",
        "Q: The trip was as you described it before. Do you remember anything else about the\nship?",
        "A: Just a terrific contrast between our steerage and that first class salon with the violin\nmusic. It was unbelievable. I stood there thunderstruck. I thought I was dreaming it all\nyou know. And of course I enjoyed seeing the gray north Atlantic. I had never been at\nsea be\u2014I mean no I was at Vonnzee which 1s a huge lake. I had never been by the\nocean. I loved it, I thought it was just wonderful. I\u2019ve loved it ever since.",
        "Q: You arrived in Havana.",
        "A: Yes, I have a cute story to tell about my father. Shows you what kind of a man he was.\nFirst of all he boarded the ship with a pilot, somehow he wrangled that. Greeted us all\n(inaudible, outside interference) It was heaven. It was so wonderful. I had always adored\nmy Popi and it was just shear heaven to be with him again and I\u2019m sure my mother felt\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe same. And then of course he couldn\u2019t\u2019 take us right off because there was a sort of\nCuban version of Ellis Island called Tresconia. I think it means three horns in Spanish\nbut I\u2019m not sure. And again with a child\u2019s different look at things, I thought it was\nfantastic. And it was this ancient garden with palm trees. I had never seen palm trees\nbefore and they were so wonderful I thought. And we had the, really unpleasant\nconditions. There were no mattresses. And we slept right on the metallic springboards\nwith a sheet over it, but it was the tropics. It was very hot and it wasn\u2019t too uncomfortable\nto me. The only thing I remember eating there was sweet black coffee and red beans. I\ndon\u2019t remember anything else. I thought it was great. I enjoyed it. And my father got us\nout of there within two or three days.",
        "Q: You and your mother stayed there, not your father.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. He had already made living arrangements so he came to get us much\nquicker than we had anticipated. Other people were still there. I remember saying\ngoodbye to them and out of sight, out of mind. I don\u2019t\u2019 even remember anyone in\nparticular there. So my father confronted my mother and he said Edith you have to be\nvery brave. Now you can imagine that I couldn\u2019t get something very good and you know\nwe don\u2019t\u2019 have any money and you have to be brave. It\u2019s a bit of a slum but at least we\u2019re\ntogether. And she said oh Fredl it doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re together. It\u2019s so wonderful. We\nall happily drove to whatever horrible place awaited us. Well he had had his little joke,\nbecause he had rented half of a two family house, typical Cuban with gorgeous tile floor,\nlovely veranda. Rented furniture. We had rocking chairs. The one thing I remember\ninside was a tray with tall glasses from Woolworth\u2019s with big red dots on them. Anda\ndecanter and this, these are the tropics. It looked so good and so inviting and the house\ninside was cool. And these wonderful old tile floors. Well we couldn\u2019t believe it. He had\ntotally tricked us. We were so happy, we didn\u2019t know what to think. He had his little\njoke. He was so happy too to have his family again. And I must tell you. This is where\nmy guilt complex comes in. While others were having this great sorrow and this great\npain in Europe and they were going to ghettos and concentration camps, we were having\nthis little idyll lasting some, over a year or so of pure happiness. Of course my father had\nmoney worries, but the important thing is we were together and we were safe and Cuba\nat that time long before Castro, was a wonderful place to be.",
        "Q: Were there particular people back in Germany that you were concerned about?",
        "A: My grandparents who were our only close relatives they had gone to South Africa\nthrough the help of my mother\u2019s younger brother who was five years younger than she.\nHe in his youth had been a communist, idealistic, and he saw the writing on the wall in\nthe early 30s. and he had he lit out from Germany. And he went to South Africa,\nestablished himself as a businessman and he became quite well off. He\u2019s dead now. And\nhe got his parents out. They lived there peacefully.",
        "Q: Did they leave Germany before you and your mother?",
        "A: I wish I could tell you for certain. Probably, probably. They didn\u2019t\u2014I was not close\nto them. They were good people but they didn\u2019t have a knack with children and it was the\nsame with my mother. They were her parents, but they were not really close. She\nappreciated them but there was no closeness. And so I\u2019m not quite certain. They must\nhave left before we did. Yes, they must have because there wasn\u2019t much later after 1939\nyou know.",
        "Q: Were there any people back in Germany that you \u2014",
        "A: There was the Christian side of the family who we ourselves didn\u2019t know too well.\nMy father was the contact there. They were doing all right. I mean I don\u2019t know what\nthey suffered under the Nazis but they were not in any imminent danger. My mother, my\nfather\u2019s mother\u2019s maiden name was Vogt, V-O-G-T or maybe it was V-O-I-G-H-T. ?\u2019'm\nnot sure. It was pronounced Vogt, which in German means abbot. And so they were the\nChristian side and Aunt Mathilda the great aunt, she had married an Abel so she was\nChristian so but her, the man she married came from Jewish family. So anyway it was\none aunt much later in fact just about two years ago I learned that my very glamorous\nolder great aunt, she was my grandmother\u2019s sister, her name was Ida, Eda and she\nmarried wealthy im, she was married and she had married a Jewish gentleman. And I\nlearned recently that she had ended up in Thereiseinstadt. I had not known this before. I\nwas very, very sad. She was \u2014 I wasn\u2019t close to her either but I knew she was an elegant\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nlady, very unhappily married. And I remember a stained glass window in her dining room\nwhen we visited. They had one of those phenomenal Berlin apartments you know. But\nbeing an only child, we did have some relatives in Dresden who were non-Jewish. The\nboys went into the army. I think they both died. They were an odd family. Do you want\nto hear another childhood memory.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: When I was in Dresden. Two, two come to mind. Neither one of them pleasant.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think you have mentioned why you were in Dresden or when you were in\nDresden.",
        "A: This was obvious, ok this was when my father was between jobs. He was struggling.\nAnd he wanted to put his wife and child someplace. There was \u2014 so he decided to leave\nus with his relatives in Dresden. So we went there. The lady was an eccentric. She had\nabout 13 cats or more and this big old rambling country house in Dresden. She had two\nsons. I remember one of them was called Reiner and I can\u2019t remember the other one.\nThey were much bigger boys. I was just a little kid. And they played two tricks on me.\nThey gave me something that looked just like honey and they said this is good, Ruth.\nWhy don\u2019t you eat it. I was such an ignoramus. | ate it and it was laundry soap. To this\nday I can remember the taste. It was so awful. The other thing they did which did notendear them to me, they would take, put me in a potato sack and move me around the\ngarden. Just drag me you know. That wasn\u2019t too good. I was scared to death of them. Not\nhaving any siblings, particularly brothers you know. And the other thing is I developed a\ntypical childhood cold and some German families had some peculiar ideas of how to raise\nchildren. This woman\u2019s idea of curing me was to tie me hand and foot in bed and put a lot\nof blankets on me to sweat it out of my system. Well my mother was horrified. She felt\nlike she was very vulnerable. She was there because she didn\u2019t have a penny to her name.\nHer husband was struggling in Berlin to find a job and a place to live. All she had were\nthese people. She didn\u2019t want to offend the lady but she didn\u2019t\u2019 want to desert me either.\nSo while I was lying there sweating and pleading for her to release me and she was sitting\nthere crying. But she didn\u2019t\u2019 have the nerve to untie me. This was a very unpleasant\nmemory. And remember this was not done by a Nazi. This was done by what was\nconsidered a good German parentsega, not my mother but this lady who was related to\nmy father by marriage. It was her husband who was a cousin of his. And so my\nmemories of Dresden and it was also ghastly winter weather and depressing and I was\ncold most of the -- it was just simply a horrible memory",
        "Q: So that was a difficult time",
        "A: But let me throw in how Germans think children should be raised. I told you how\nclose my father was to his father. And his father was a darling man who had been\nwidowed much too young. He was well off. They had a lovely house. And he had my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfather woken every morning by a housekeeper coming in and putting ice cold sheets\naround him to wake him up and toughen him up. Can you imagine a little boy, half\norphaned, waking up in the morning and being wrapped up in these icy sheets. Well this\nwas the German way of bringing children up. I\u2019m so glad that my own parents didn\u2019t\u2019\nhave those ideas. I just wanted to throw that in.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s move ahead to Cuba. You said that you were very happy",
        "A: Oh it was unbelievable",
        "Q: With your family there for about a year. Did you go to school in Cuba?",
        "A: Yes. I did and this is a very interesting thing. I went to a place called Miss Philip\u2019s\nschool and it was a private school. My father had done some fund raising for the\nAmerican Joint Committee and helped many Jewish refugees. And they were giving him\nan allowance. That\u2019s who we managed to live. And I don\u2019t know what the financial\narrangements were for me to attend school, but I went to this lovely American Miss\nPhilip\u2019s school in Havana. It was a lovely tropical building in a nice part of town. And I\nwas learning both Spanish and English and I \u2014",
        "Q: The school was conducted in English?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: There was a Miss Sema. I think it was English and Spanish. Yes, it was, I had an\nAmerican teacher, Miss Martha Jane Pruitt. No, Martha, Martha Jane Jones. She married\na Mr. Pruitt later. She was a darling young girl. And it was, I remember there was an\nolder teacher with white hair. Mrs. Morris Sema. And she must have been Spanish\nspeaking. But I managed with all these limitations in language to be the second best in\nmy class and I got a silver medal. I still have it. And a gold medal was earned by another\nrefugee boy I remember. A nice plump Jewish boy with a marvelous sense of humor.\nAnd he got the first one which was gold. So these refugee children were really\noutdistancing the local kids.",
        "Q: Were there many refugee children in this school?",
        "A: No. But there were many refugees in Havana. Yes.",
        "Q: And at home, did your family still speak German\u2019?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s probably why I am now working in the historical division doing\ntranslations, because my fundamental German is very deep seated that I have not really\nforgotten it because even in this country, until my parents\u2019 deaths. My mother died in\n1984, my father much earlier, we would intermingle English and German.",
        "Q: So German has for you the memories of being with your mother and with your father\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I know some very embittered people who have suffered greatly and who when they\ncame to America, refused to speak German. And I respect that and I understand it. But\nthat\u2019s a different situation.",
        "Q: Well maybe we can talk more about that later.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What else about Cuba?",
        "A: I thought the Cuban people were so different from anything I had seen before. I\nremember pale faced northern Germans or worried Jewish Germans and great deal \u2014 I\nwas always cold in Germany, it seems to me and everything seemed to be gray. Berlin\nseemed to be gray. And all of a sudden I was on this golden island and with royal palm\ntrees. I thought I\u2019d never seen anything so beautiful. The sunsets, this tropical skies were\nsomething I\u2019d never experienced before. The music, the people. They were very warm\nand charming. And at that time, happy.",
        "Q: And did you feel any special treatment as a Jew?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: They couldn\u2019t have been nicer to us. They were so good and hospitable and\nwelcoming.",
        "Q: How did you happen to leave Cuba?",
        "A: Oh that was because our quota number came up. We had done our wait. I was\nheartbroken. I remember the day we sailed away. My parents had locked me into a cabin\nbecause I had been asleep when they left and they didn\u2019t want me to be 1n any danger.\nAnd I remember waking up as the ship was sailing away and I was looking at the\nMonicone. It\u2019s that great stretch of road that\u2019s the first thing you see when you come to\nHavana harbor. And the lights twinkling like pearl necklace and I wanted to go on deck.\nAnd I couldn\u2019t. The door was locked. And I remember standing at that porthole and\nsobbing because I didn\u2019t want to leave Cuba. The people I knew. My little girlfriends. I\nwas distraught.",
        "Q: So you did make friends in Cuba?",
        "A: Oh in fact just a few months ago, I visited one of them who is now a lady my age in\nher late 60s. Living in Florida. That was my dear friend Hilda whom I had met then. She\nwas then a very beautiful little girl with her own problems. Her parents had divorced. But\nshe was a well upper crust Cuban. I mean a very well, they were wealthy.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: So she was not a refugee?",
        "A: She was an only child like myself and I fascinated her because I was a refugee and so\nwe became friends and it\u2019s a lifelong friendship.",
        "Q: So it was hard for you to say goodbye to Hilda and it was and your other friends.",
        "A: It was agonizing. Yes.",
        "Q: Why did your parents want to come to the US instead of staying in Cuba?",
        "A: Oh because there was no future for us in Cuba. It was a marvelous resting, stopping\noff place, better than we ever hoped for or expected. But it was not a place to remain.\nThere was no way you could make a living or anything. We were set to become\nAmericans.",
        "Q: Did your family have contacts in the United States?",
        "A: Well he had had connections with this Joint Committee and we quickly found work\nbut it was a terrible struggle. I once wrote an essay about my father. And I gave it to my\nchildren in which I explained how it was for him. Here he was at this point in his 50s,and he looked for any kind of job. Salesman. He worked at the Savoy Plaza Hotel in the\nbasement as sort of janitorial working. There he was once a well set up gentleman with\nhis little fortune. And here he was now practically a janitor and guys half his age who\nreferred to him as hey Al, you know. And it was a great come down or I don\u2019t know but\nhe was very gallant about the whole thing. He got used to it. He struggled with it. He put\nup with it. He fought and he finally ended up creating his own position with a German\nlanguage newspaper, the Stats Sanctunk und Herald (German), a Knight Ridder paper\nand he found a job in their advertising department. And with his contacts back in\nGermany and his knowledge of German, he became the advertising director for the ads\nfrom Germany, big industry ads. And I wanted to explain how it was possible for him to\ngo back to Germany on business trips after all that had happened. And this was of course\nafter the war when Germany was being built up again. He knew the high commissioner\nand he had contacts from business before. And he managed to get some fabulous ads for\nthe paper and he did this twice a year for seven years until he died of lung cancer. And\nthe way that he could do this, as I explained before is that he had had 40, almost up to \u2014\nno more than 40, mid 40s. He had had a good life in Germany. This was a nightmare that\ncame upon him in middle age and he had had to adjust to it. He had to understand it\nwasn\u2019t going to go away. That he had to get away from there. He had not been in the\ncamps. He had not had the experience. And so he was able to come back and deal with\nthe post war Germans. He was not eaten up by hatred or revulsion like so many\nrightfully were. You know. And so he could do this.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Can we back up a bit to your arrival in the New York. Do you remember that?",
        "A: Oh yes. He had a good friend in New York. His name was Eric Goodall. For a while\nhe was a political cartoonist and he, the very first night, he took us around in his car. I\nremember drove us to Little Italy where all the lights were lit and oh first the skyscrapers\ndown Fifth Avenue. And I was a little child. It was an open convertible and I laid back\nand just looked up at the skyscrapers and the bright lights in Little Italy and all over. And\nI remember falling asleep, leaning back with my mouth open. That\u2019s my first night in\nNew York. My father, as we were going down Broadway on that first day, stopped at\n77\" street and Broadway. At the corner there was a hotel called the Benjamin Franklin. I\nlooked recently and the building is still there, but it\u2019s no longer the Benjamin Franklin.\nIt\u2019s been rebuilt as something else. It was a residential hotel and he rented us a nice large\nroom with kitchen privileges for that first night. And we lived there for some months.\nAnd so our arrival in New York was very pleasant. I had my parents with me and my\nfather had his good friend there. And getting acquainted with New York. And then I went\nto public school and that of course was a little frightening but I got used to it.",
        "Q: So you were about 12?",
        "A: 11 I think. Wait. We arrived in 1940. I was born in 28. 12.",
        "Q: And how was your English by this time?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Oh it was so good. I remember being in public school and I asked what is a bra. And\nthis girl\u2019s laugh and said imagine Ruthie Abel not knowing what bra means. I didn\u2019t\u2019\nknow that it was a brassiere. I was still too young for that but girls were talking about it.\nAnd there were words I just didn\u2019t\u2019 know yet. I had to learn them and eventually I\nrealized that I was beginning to think in English and that I had really gotten good at it,\nbut it took a few years. Not too long because I was young. My mother although she had a\nvery good knowledge of structure of the language. Had an accent that is so thick you\ncould cut it with a knife. She never mastered the T-H\u2019s.",
        "Q: was she home during the day",
        "A: She worked.",
        "Q: She did",
        "A: I was sort of a latch key child for quite a while.",
        "Q: what did she do?",
        "A: Secretarial mostly. She was a very good secretary. In those days secretary was not a\ndirty word. Now it is.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: So she was out with the public and had to use her English every day.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes, but she also managed to work for many refugee firms where they all\nspoke German",
        "Q: She used German at work a lot of the times.",
        "A: Yes, different jobs yes.",
        "Q: So you went through school in New York. What schools did you go to in New York?",
        "A: It was a public school in the neighborhood there and I was just getting, I was getting\nadjusted to the American way of life and \u2014",
        "Q: How was it making friends?",
        "A: I made a few good ones, not too many. Kindred spirits and in fact one of them, Vera,\nwas arefugee. In fact she\u2019s in Chicago now. For many years she taught heart at the\nUniversity of Chicago and her father came from Danzig. And Russian background.\nLovely girl. I became very good friends. And then there was a darling Irish American Jill\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMcConnell. She became my best friend. She was from the neighborhood. She in fact\nshe\u2019s the one who gave me my middle name.",
        "Q: Which was?",
        "A: Andrea. What happened was after five years my parents had the opportunity to get\ntheir citizenship. In fact we went and swore the oath and they made a big dinner\nafterwards and celebrated. I, as their child. Automatically became a citizen. And I was\ntold that when you become a citizen you can have a choice at what name you want and\nwell I have always been upset at the fact that I had one name only and that was only one\nsyllable. Rutt. It just wasn\u2019t \u2014 that\u2019s how it was pronounced in Germany, Rutt. I\ndidn\u2019t\u2019 like it. It wasn\u2019t enough for me. I didn\u2019t feel like just Ruth. You know or Ruth and\nso she and I took a walk on Riverside Drive because I told her I wanted to get a middle\nname. And I realized that every American I knew had a middle name. I only had one and\nit was only one syllable so I said Jill will you help me find a name. So we walked and\nwe started with the A\u2019s naturally. We didn\u2019t get very far because when she said Andrea,\nI said say that again. And she said Andrea. And I said I like it.",
        "Q: What did you like about Andrea?",
        "A: The sound, the soft three syllable sound. And so I became Ruth Andrea Abel.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Did it have any national connotations for you? I mean was it definitely \u2014",
        "A: No I was always, I always went by sound rather than rule. Later I learned it meant\nsomething like gift of God or something. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ll have to look that up again.\nAnd of course Ruth Andrea became Randy. That was my nickname for many years. Now\nthat I work at the Holocaust Museum, I feel Randy isn\u2019t right, so I go as Ruth.",
        "Q: Where you named after anyone in particular?",
        "A: Well that\u2019s the strange thing. My parents when they were waiting for me, apparently\nnever had discussions about names the way my husband and I did. And here\u2019s my dear\nmother, recuperating from having had me in bed and my dad hot foots it to city hall and\nsays he wants me named Ruth. He had never even consulted her. She wanted to call me\nEllen, but then she thought Ellen Abel doesn\u2019t sound good so she hesitated. So he comes\nback with a fait accompli. Here I was Ruth. I didn\u2019t like, she didn\u2019t like it. But there it\nwas.",
        "Q: Do you know why he selected Ruth?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I wish I knew. It would be interesting, wouldn\u2019t it? I haven\u2019t a clue. I don\u2019t\u2019 think he\never had a girlfriend named --- used to have many girlfriends before he got married. In\nfact he was married before. And never mentioned Ruth.",
        "Q: we\u2019re almost at the end of this tape so let\u2019s stop and turn it over.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n(Tape 2 \u2014 RG-50.106.0089.02.02; duration: 51:55)\nMargaret Garrett: This is a continuation of United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Ruth Harvey, conducted by Margaret Garrett on\nAugust 22, 1997 in Bethesda, Maryland. Tape number 2, side A. During the break you\nwere talking about your father\u2019s first marriage.\nRuth Harvey: Yes. He had always been a stage door Johnny, a man about town. He really\nwas. He once had a violent love affair with a young actress named Helen Richter. And\nhe was so jealous of her, he was all set to shoot her. He was a very passionate young man.\nWell he got over that. But he did marry an artist as his first wife. She was prima ballerina\nof the Berlin Opera. Her name was Elizabeth Grube. She was non-Jewish and she was a\nvery good dancer. They were married about four years and then she ran off with a stage\ndesigner, a Greek stage designer. (background crashing noise) and then he was a\ndivorced man and I think it was a very good thing when my mother-to-be walked into his\nlife. As his secretary.",
        "Q: So he had no children from his first marriage.",
        "A: No. And she later married some titled German and barely escaped with her life when\nthe Russians overran the estate that they lived on, barely escaped. She later died. I met\nher once. She\u2019s a very charming lady.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Ok. Let\u2019s go back to New York and you went to high school where?",
        "A: I went to the high school of music and art which had always been a fund project of\nMayor LaGuardia, Fiorello LaGuardia. And you could, and only go in there by passing\ncertain tests. And I\u2019m happy to say I passed them. And there were two categories in\nthose days. Now it\u2019s the high school for the performing arts, but in those days it was just\nmusic and art. I belonged with the artists.",
        "Q: And\u2014",
        "A: It was a regular high school but they were these two different things that we\nconcentrated on, a career for music or a career as an artist, in addition to high school\nsubjects.",
        "Q: So you graduated from high school in what year?",
        "A: I think maybe 48. I was always one year behind because of my having been a refugee.\nI believe I graduated in 48 if I\u2019m not mistaken.",
        "Q: And then what happened?\nA: Well I went to Cooper Union for a time. I did not graduate from there. I was all, that\u2019s\nanother thing. You had to take an exam to get into that. I passed that for the day courses.\nAnd then my parents took me aside and said Ruthie, there just isn\u2019t the money there.\nYou\u2019re just going to have to take a day time job, go to night school. Well I was very\nupset about that. All my friends who were able to go to Cooper Union were going in the\nday time. And it was very hard for me to work at jobs, sales jobs. The worst job I ever\nhad as a very young person, oh this was ghastly was in some horrible neighborhood\ndowntown where we spray painted little monkey masks. You know the little faces on\nlittle monkeys. We spray painted them. Every time I sneezed I\u2019d get out a different\nrainbow color. It was unhealthy and unpleasant. It was I would say factory work. It was\njust ghastly. Well I did, the jobs I got in those days were not very good. And it was a\ngreat strain to work at that and then go to night school. And after a while I, I just dropped\nout. And much to my regret, really. And then I, eventually after many lesser and less\nenjoyable jobs, I found a lovely secretarial job with Paramount theaters in the Paramount\nbuilding in Times Square where I stayed for four years and I really enjoyed it. I was\nordering candy for the theater chains and doing secretarial. Candy was bigger with them\nthan the films were. They got more revenue from that. And I stayed with them. Oh I\nmust tell you how I got the job at the State Department in Washington. Would you like\nto hear how I got that?",
        "Q: Were you in New York when you got the State Department job?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Yes. [Il tell you how. My parents went for a vacation to Nassau and it was February\nand I was alone in the apartment and feeling a little woebegone. Things were not going\nterribly smoothly in my life. And late at night I had the radio on and I heard an\nannouncer say would you like a career in the foreign service? If so, apply to the State\nDepartment at Center Street downtown and get your form. Well I took off from work the\nvery next day and took the subway all the way down to Center Street, near Wall Street,\nand applied for form 57, for employment with the State Department in quintuplicate.",
        "Q: Why were you interested in applying for the job?",
        "A: New York was not a healthy environment for me. I had been there 16 years and I was\nnot flourishing. Things were not happening well for me. And I felt that I needed a\nchange of life, life style, surroundings, everything.",
        "Q: What was not happening that you wanted to?",
        "A: I met a lot of people who I felt were rather neurotic. There was something unhealthy\nabout life in New York, if you were not well cushioned by money. If you had to struggle,\nit could be downright depressing at times. And I felt that I was young enough, that I owed\nit to myself to go someplace else and try something new. So the very next day I got the\nform. My parents were still on vacation. Every night after work I would lie on the floor,\non the carpet, on my stomach and fill out some more of this huge, positively endless form\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nin quintuplicate. You had to go back to your very first beginnings of life. Everybody you\never knew you had to go get references and schools. It took a week to fill 1t out\nconscientiously. I did that and I listed references here and there and what not. And I\nmailed it off and this was February. And I forgot about it. In May I\u2019m sitting in my\noffice at the Paramount theaters when the phone rang and it was Washington, offering me\najob. Well my father was so pleased because he had always had a high regard for\ndiplomats. The diplomat\u2019s life. And here was this little Ruthie entering, true at the very\nbottom. But still it was the State Department. He couldn\u2019t have been more pleased. So I\ngave up my job at Paramount and traveled to Washington.",
        "Q: Now you had been living still in your parents\u2019 home.",
        "A: Well at first in their home and then I managed to get a room in the same building\nabove them. But I left all that quite happily and settled in Mount Pleasant and worked for\nthe State Department for about four years.",
        "Q: Did you know anyone in Washington?",
        "A: [had had a boyfriend who had lived in Washington on and off. He was a flight\nengineer. And I visited him once and the first thing I saw from Union Station was the\nCapitol and trees everywhere I looked. I feel hook line and sinker. I fell in love with\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nWashington and I wanted to live here. So when the State Department job came, I thought\nthis is wonderful. This is a wonderful way to get where I want to go.",
        "Q: So you came down by yourself and you found housing.",
        "A: Yes. My father treated me to my first night\u2019s hotel room and then at the State\nDepartment I went to the registry for housing and they found me a pleasant place on\nMount Pleasant. Yes, it was nice. A group home with lots of other young women.",
        "Q: And that job worked out pretty well for you.",
        "A: Oh indeed, I had a wonder, I loved working for ( )The odd thing is I went as\na, I wanted to go as a foreign secretary. And they offered me such a hideous assignment\nthat I simply switched to domestic because I thought I\u2019d be happier than oh what was this\ncountry. It was land locked. And I can\u2019t think of the name right now. But it was the least\nappealing country in Latin America. No ocean, no nothing. And I thought to myself to,\nto lose two years of my life in this boon docks. That didn\u2019t seem right. And so I simply\nand in those days you can get a second choice. And so I switched to domestic and I\nworked in the Latin American division with my previous knowledge of Spanish. And I\nhad a very good time as a single girl in Washington. I enjoyed myself. And then I met my\nhusband to be. And that starts another chapter in my life.\nQ: And how did you meet him?",
        "A: Very romantic. In those days the Park Sheraton hotel had a magnificent Olympic\nsized pool. Now it\u2019s been paved over as a parking lot. Can you imagine. IN those days it\nwas a very refreshing beautiful blue green. Water. And one Labor Day, it was Labor Day\n1957. It was very hot, my girlfriend and I decided to go to that pool for a nice swim. And\nso we went and that\u2019s how I met my husband. Sitting next to me.",
        "Q: What was he doing?",
        "A: Well this is so strange. He was also , he said he was also in the foreign service. And\nwhat he couldn\u2019t\u2019 tell me in those days, but I can tell now because he\u2019s been dead since\n1972, he was with the CIA. I mean he didn\u2019t\u2019 tell me that of course. He just, we\nexchanged telephone numbers and he said if you call me and I\u2019m not there, just leave a\nmessage cause that\u2019s the way it is. I didn\u2019t know that so he called me and missed me so I\ncalled him and he wasn\u2019t there and I wasn\u2019t going to leave a message so I just hung up.\nThis way we never would have gotten together. But finally he got me at home because I\nhad only given him my office number. My boss took pity on him and he said [Il give you\nher home phone number, god bless him. And then we saw each other every day for about\nnine months and then he was assigned to Athens, Greece. And that\u2019s when he asked me\nto share his life there with him, And we got married and we went to Athens. And live\nhappily there for five years. And two of my three children were born there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Now when did you learn he was with the CIA?",
        "A: He told me after much hemming and hawing months and months later. He had too\nbecause I was \u2014",
        "Q: Before you got married?",
        "A: No let me see. No I was aware of what he was doing before we talked marriage yes.",
        "Q: So before you talked marriage.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You knew that he was with the CIA. Was he Jewish?",
        "A: Oh no. He was, he came from Milwaukee of Polish and Welsh stock. The Welsh or\nEnglish part would have been Protestant, but I, Unitarian. And the other part was Polish\nCatholic. His mother was Catholic. She came from Polish peasants, maybe third\ngeneration and his father was first generation. They came over from England and went\ninto real estate in Milwaukee.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: And what religion was he?",
        "A: Well like his, like his, well he was not Catholic like his mother. He was like his father.\nCould you stop it for a minute. I\u2019m trying to.",
        "Q: Will you say that again. The tape didn\u2019t start when you spoke so would you just repeat\nthat?",
        "A: Yes, I had said Unitarian but I misspoke. He was Congregationalist. In fact our three\nchildren were baptized at Plymouth Church in Milwaukee on different home leaves when\nwe came back to visit his folks. And he had them christened right there.",
        "Q: Did you consider yourself at that point Jewish, not Jewish.",
        "A: This is the story of my life. I\u2019ve never figured out exactly what I am. I certainly feel\nmore Jewish than anything else. And yet, I am not really a practicing Jew. I don\u2019t follow\nthe high holidays or the customs because I was raised so differently. And so that is sort of\na, a conflict within me as to what exactly where do I belong.",
        "Q: So your children were christened in the Congregational church.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Yes, and they\u2019re fully aware that my background is Jewish, that some of their blood is\nJewish and they know all this and they are simply, all three of them. I have tried to get\nthem to go to Sunday school or have given them bibles, and they\u2019re just. They\u2019re\nwonderful. They\u2019ve got good characters but they\u2019re non-religious totally. I couldn\u2019t get\nanywhere with them.",
        "Q: Why did you try to get them to go to Sunday school?",
        "A: Because we were in the foreign service overseas. There was a lot of people going to\nchurch. It was a social thing for the people to get together. Their children went to Sunday\nschool. And I thought it would be kind of good for them to learn the stories of the bible.\nYou know. But I couldn\u2019t get them. They didn\u2019t want to.",
        "Q: In your home, did you celebrate Christmas?",
        "A: Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving. And birthdays. That was about it.",
        "Q: You were in Athens with your husband for five years.",
        "A: Yes five years.",
        "Q: You had two children there?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well two were born there, yes. The third was born in Fairfax hospital later.",
        "Q: How do you think having been a refugee and that entire experience, how do you think\nthat affected your life when you went back overseas to Athens?",
        "A: This is interesting that you should ask this because the Greeks, delving back into\nhistory have always been known to honor the stranger, to give hospitality to the stranger,\nto the visitor. Xenos, the stranger. They couldn\u2019t have been more hospitable or\nwelcoming. It\u2019s in their blood. And I compared that to the German character of\nmistrusting instinctively the foreign element. The Aryan. Right away. And I thought to\nmyself what a shame that people have to be so different.",
        "Q: So the Greeks were hospitable?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: How about other people in the foreign service and in the CIA?",
        "A: Well those were the days when there was a very idealistic bunch of people there like\nmy husband and his friends, very good sort of people. And to patriots, and risking their\nlives and we have a very high opinion of the people we worked with. In fact, I didn\u2019t\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nrealize. You know in those days I didn\u2019t\u2019 think about liberal or conservative, Democrat or\nRepublican. In those days in the 50s there were so many moderates on both sides and\nthey sort of melded. It wasn\u2019t really until the 80s and 90s that you see this really ugly\ntooth and nail attitude between the Democrats and the Republicans, the ultra\nconservatives and liberal has become a dirty word. This is something that didn\u2019t exist\nthen.",
        "Q: Did you feel there was any discrimination about you being Jewish?",
        "A: I just say no. No.",
        "Q: So you were in Athens for \u2014",
        "A: However excuse me for interrupting. Had there been anything like that, I would not\nhave hidden. I would have spoken out but I was fortunate in that, that never came up.",
        "Q: Do you think that\u2019s because of your previous experience that you would have been\nmore likely to speak up?",
        "A: Oh definitely, of course. Yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: What about having children? Was that for you do you think a different experience\nbecause of your previous life in Germany and\u2014",
        "A: I would not wed these two ideas together. It was something entirely different. A\ntotally different trip. Had nothing to do with religion. Or, or past or anything. It was\nsomething new, a new world I was going into.",
        "Q: And so that was\u2014",
        "A: The best thing I ever did or went through and gave meaning to my life. I mean this is\nwhat I had been born for and raising the\u2014and then later when my husband died, fairly\nearly. We had only been married 14 years, and left, leaving me with three children and\ntheir ages were at the time, 11, ten and eight. And fortunately the government provided\npensions and we didn\u2019t\u2019 suffer hardship, but still I was the one to raise these three and\nmay, this is interesting. Maybe my past experiences in dealing with hardships gave me\nthe strength to endure this terrible shock of losing him so young and being in charge of\nthree young lives. And I must say they had such good character. It was so easy to raise\nthem. I thoroughly enjoyed being a parent and I must say they didn\u2019t give me much grief\nat all. They were good kids. I raised them instinctually. All of us do and there\u2019s no\nhandbook for being a parent. And it came out well.",
        "Q: You have boys and \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I have two boys and the girl is in the middle. Well of course they are men and a\nyoung woman. Jenny just went, moved to Brooklyn to follow her man who got a job\nthere and she is a clinical social worker. She just got her masters last year, a year ago.\nAnd Michael is an honors, the oldest boy is an honors professor in Milwaukee at\nUniversity of Wisconsin.",
        "Q: What is his field?",
        "A: He\u2019s teaching an honors course which will be up next year and then he has to struggle\nto get another job. It\u2019s not easy.",
        "Q: An honors course would cover a number of different subjects?",
        "A: Yes. Arts, politics and those things are only for three years so when that\u2019s over and\nwith the present problem with teaching and professors not having tenure, he\u2019ll be lucky if\nhe gets another teaching position, although he\u2019s very, the students love him. And my\nyoungest is working here in Washington. He\u2019s got a nice job, just got married recently\nand nice young couple, very happy with life. Sol can gratefully say that I would say the\nmost creative thing and the most constructive thing in my life would be raising these\nthree children. Having gotten them in the first place born healthy and I\u2019m very, very\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ngrateful about that. And that\u2019s what helped me through my widowhood, having them to\ntake care of.",
        "Q: Did you work after your husband died?",
        "A: Yes. I remember that I had worked at, had a little part time job at an insurance\ncompany when Johnny was still working for the agency here and then he left and a month\nafter he left, I got the death notice and struggled for a little bit longer at that job. And\nthen they replaced me with somebody who had been there before and like a homing\npigeon I fled to the agency that he worked for and told them my story and they gave me a\npart time job which I kept for eight years while raising the children. I couldn\u2019t take a full\ntime job. I had a part time job. I was home when they came home from school. And then\nI switched to full time for a few more years when they were bigger and then I took early\nretirement. Now I\u2019m retired and it\u2019s amazing how full one\u2019s days can be, although\nretired.",
        "Q: And so have your friends been some refugees, not refugees?",
        "A: Well there\u2019s still Vera, although she\u2019s far away and I\u2019ve had friends from all over.\nRefugees and native Americans and Cubans and oh yes, I just take people as they come.\nI don\u2019t have groups.",
        "Q: So you haven\u2019t felt limited to having other refugees who have had similar\nexperiences?",
        "A: That is a feeling I had in New York when I was a teenager, about 13 or so and those\ndays all the poor frightened sick people who had survived Nazi Germany had all come to\nManhattan and all settled on the west side. And it was, I remember how terribly\ndepressive it was as a young teenager to see these poor old pale gray shadows of\nthemselves walking around Broadway, each one a tragic story. There were so many of\nthem. I remember the feeling I had at the time, how tragic this was and how I wanted to\nget away from it.",
        "Q: So that was part of your wanting to come to Washington.",
        "A: Well by the time\u2014yes, you know by the time that I was ready to leave, those people\nwere still there. Oddly enough, many, many decades later I went back. They were all\ngone and their offsprings doing well and the places had been, bad neighborhoods had\nbeen made wonderful. And New York was totally different, a completely different stage\nset. All those poor, poor shadows had vanished. And you saw nice young people jogging\nalong, healthy and it was just, just like it was when I went to Germany. I said this is a\nbrand new country. New York was a brand new country decades after I left it. But at the\ntime when we were all refugees there together, I found it very, very sad.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: But when you came to Washington, you did not have that feeling of refugees together.",
        "A: No, in fact you know in New York this had this unhappy reputation for not being\nterribly polite or. Well I thought anyone in Washington seemed so healthy and so\npleasant and I really enjoy the people here. I like it better. I must admit I had gotten fed\nup with New York. And consider this place a place to get my health back and I did.",
        "Q: You went back to Germany when\u2019?",
        "A: With my, oh after I became widowed in 72, my mother and I managed to plan to go\nback to Germany. I think it was 76 or 78. I don\u2019t remember which. And the sad thing\nabout my husband is he died in Viet Nam and when he left here, we had decided that\nwhen he had finished his tour which was supposed to be 18 months, we would meet in\nGermany and I would show it to him. He was going to come straight from Viet Nam. I\nwas going to come straight from Washington. We were going to meet there and I was, I\ntold him we were going to paint the town red. And I was so looking forward to that.",
        "Q: He was in Viet Nam with the CIA?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how did he die?",
        "A: Well there are several versions which I don\u2019t know that I want to go into. One is that\nhe died in a swimming pool and the other one\u2019s a different version that somebody got to\nhim from North Korea and so not knowing the full truth it\u2019s best not to. I don\u2019t\u2019 know.\nPll never know the truth so I can\u2019t really tell you. But anyway the idea being that when\nhe had finished his tour, we were going to reunite and I was going to show him my home\ntown. So you can imagine the state of mind I was in when I went years later with my\nmother. I remember being very unhappy and very unpleasant and very crabby and I\napologized to her. I said Mutti, I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m just so sad. I pictured this so\ndifferently. And she said apologies are not necessary my dear. I fully understand. But\nthen after I had gotten there and discovered that it was, everything was so different from\nwhat I remembered and people were pleasant. And this was before the return of the\nskinheads. At this point, I thought oh my this is marvelous. The new Germans are great.\nThis is a democracy. How nice. And it was only later when I was back home a few years\nlater and I read about these outrages against the Turkish laborers and the skinheads you\nknow setting houses on fire. And just being generally nasty to the alien labor forces that\nthey had. And skinheads with swastikas and what not and I got so fed up and so disgusted\nyou know. So as you can see, I\u2019ve always had a roller coaster feeling about Germany.\nIt\u2019 ll always be with me. My daughter said maybe you should see a therapist and I don\u2019t\nknow. I just don\u2019t know. Should I or shouldn\u2019t I, I don\u2019t, she thinks I should.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about your experience with the Holocaust museum.\nA: Yes. It\u2019s funny. People had always told me through the years, Randy why don\u2019t you\nbe a docent, maybe at the Smithsonian or something. And I\u2019d say yeah, yeah. I didn\u2019t\u2019\nreally want to. I had no desire to. I think \u2014",
        "Q: Think that you needed an interest or you had too much time.",
        "A: Yeah, something besides I\u2019m garrulous and I like people. They thought it\u2019d be terrific.\nAnd I said nothing tugged at me. And then I read an article in the Washington Post about\nthe new holocaust museum. And the idea that I adored, in those days they still had those\npass machines when you would take a one of those ID book, cards or pamphlets from the\nmachine and you would read you know people who had been through the Holocaust and\nyou\u2019d read their story. And in those days you would have to go to a different floor and\nget the second page and you couldn\u2019t just read the whole thing. As you went from floor to\nfloor the fate of this person unfolded. They got rid of those machines because they were\nused to death, they died. They got rid of them. They were always breaking down. Now\nyou get the whole little passbook and unless you control yourself and wait you can read\nthe whole thing while waiting for the elevator. The idea being that you didn\u2019t know then\nwould this person make it or would they perish. And that was rather dramatic. I thought\nthe idea was phenomenal you know. And then I read that they were looking for\nvolunteers and all of a sudden it was like bong. All of a sudden, I was interested. My\nheart was in this. This is something that I felt I could do so well with my background.And so I wrote a letter and they replied. And I came for an interview and I was accepted.\nI was thrilled. I loved the museum. I love what they\u2019re doing and I enjoyed being a\nvolunteer and were it not for my bad ankle and knee, I would be here much more often\nthan I am. But fortunately they have an opening for me here in the oral history\ndepartment and I\u2019m very happy translating and shaking through these documents.",
        "Q: You said that you love the museum and what they\u2019re doing. What is it that you love\nabout the museum?",
        "A: It\u2019s a learning museum. It teaches people, often, young people who otherwise might\nbe totally unaware of the Holocaust that there was such a thing and that those flakes who\nkeep proclaiming that it never happened are flakes. And that this really did happen.\nThere\u2019s enough evidence in this museum to show that. I love that. That somebody took\nthe trouble to build it and, and I love the architect who went to the camps and got the\nideas for the architecture directly from the camps. James Engle Freed. And I love what\nhe did. It\u2019s a magnificent building. And going, the strange is when I applied, I said\nplease don\u2019t put me near scenes of horror. I don\u2019t\u2019 want to see it. And put me anywhere.\nWell sure enough, they did just the opposite. And I found myself walking through the\npermanent exhibit. But I learned to live with it.",
        "Q: What was your first assignment there?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: To walk, to be a walker through the different floors of the permanent exhibit. Make\nsure everything was going along well. You know as you come out of the elevator you see\na horrible thing on the fourth floor, against the wall and all the corpses of, I mean this is\nwhat I had tried to avoid. And somehow they got me into that.",
        "Q: Did you ever ask to be transferred?",
        "A: No once I was there, I decided that having seen it once, I could live with it and do the\njob that they wanted me to do. And of course there\u2019s many others. You don\u2019t, you\u2019re not\nconstantly walking through the permanent exhibits. Many other areas. So I do it. And\nunfortunately because of my bad foot now, I don\u2019t go as often. I intend to go perhaps\nonce a month on a weekend when they need people. Keep my foot in so to speak, but\nconcentrate more on oral histories and transcriptions.",
        "Q: You said that when you read about the need for volunteers something \u2014",
        "A: Oh my heart just jumped. I said to myself god if anybody can show the public, it\u2019s me\nand I think every one of those volunteers must have had that same zing when they read\nabout this, don\u2019t you think?",
        "Q: Can you say more about that feeling that you would be able to show the public \u2014",
        "A: Thad a feeling that my life, remember now that I was a middle aged retired woman\nwithout a husband in her life, children grown up, life a little empty. And all of a sudden\nhere is something that totally engaged me, my mind and my heart and I said this is what I\nwas put here for. I was taking, I was in the skilled complex because I didn\u2019t\u2019 suffer as\nmuch as the others. I said this is maybe how I can atone for that. I can tell people what\nthese people went through and where they ended up and, and I can be more dramatic\nperhaps than somebody who wasn\u2019t as close to the subject, you know. And I, I had a\nfeeling that this museum gave more meaning to my life.",
        "Q: We have to turn over the tape.",
        "Q: When we stopped you were talking about your work at the museum giving meaning to\nyour life. Can you say more about that?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. First of all when I was an only child and shy I didn\u2019t\u2019 know that I really\nloved people. But as I got more mature and more worldly I discovered that I really liked\npeople very much and it\u2019s wonderful working with the public. You meet so many\ndifferent people, different outlooks on life. I\u2019m able to use my two foreign languages on\nthem. When I speak Spanish to some people, bewildered family from Argentina, their\nfaces just light up and I can convey to them the things they want to know about the\nmuseum and when Germans come to visit, and this is a strange thing. I\u2019ve seen young\nGerman people come in and they have the strangest expressions on their faces. Maybe I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nread more into it because of my background, but maybe not. There is a mixture, sort of\nfear and shame and more. It\u2019s a combination of impressions, when I look at the young\nfaces. They know what their country has done and I\u2019m sure they feel terrible about it.\nAnd they feel embarrassed and guilty but eager to see this and afraid to see it. It\u2019s a\nfascinating expression. I\u2019ve seen it at various times. And I try to put them at ease. I mean\nthey didn\u2019t cause this.",
        "Q: How do you do that?",
        "A: I speak their language to them. And look at them kindly. I am gentle with them. But I\nsay how happy I am that they are here. Then I emphasize but you of all people you have\nto know this and that\u2019s all I say. And they nod. And I have a feeling I\u2019m getting my point\nacross.",
        "Q: Do you think any of the visitors pick up that you were a refugee?",
        "A: Oh, this is interesting because one of those minute suggestion was, the minutes from\nthe meeting of the survivors, that the survivors ought to have special badges saying\nsurvivor. Some people want that. Others, myself included, do not think it\u2019s such a great\nidea. But whenever I think it\u2019s appropriate to a particular group of people in a given\nsituation, I\u2019ll mention. There is one place, my favorite in the whole museum and it\u2019s a\nremember the children Daniel\u2019s house. That is my favorite exhibit because that 1s partly\nmy youth growing up in Germany. Many of the things in that exhibit it\u2019s like walking\nthrough a series of stage sets. Remind me of my own childhood. Although it didn\u2019t have\nthe terrible ending that are pictured there like the ghetto and the camps. I left before them.\nBut every often when I have a nice family who brought their children, Ill put the\nemphasis on look at the children and they\u2019!1 say that\u2019s just like my childhood was I grew\nup under those circumstances and then I say but I didn\u2019t\u2019 have the sad ending. But I says\nbasically remember my own childhood there and this, the children look at me with big\neyes. It\u2019s very useful to be able to do that convincingly because it\u2019s the truth you know.\nAnd I do that when I like a given group and I want to add to their knowledge. I don\u2019t feel\nthat I want to go around with a badge that says survivor though you know. I don\u2019t want\nto do that. Was anything else on this subject that you wanted to know. Oh my interaction\nwith people. The sweetest little peasant woman from some East European country\ntalking Yiddish came. She had misplaced some object, had lost something that her\ngrandmother had given her and it had been found in the lost and found and I got it for her\nand handed it to her. And she didn\u2019t speak the language. She grabbed my hand and kissed\nit and I thought that was the sweetest most touching thing. And I was smiling the rest of\nthe day. I\u2019m embarrassed but also touched. And you meet so many different people.\nSometimes you see a lady middle aged, totally overcome. It was like we would come out\nof the hall of remembrance and she was just standing there and her shoulders were\nshaking. She was leaning against the column, her face to the column and I just gently. I\nknow we\u2019re not supposed to touch the public but sometimes a human touch 1s sort of\ninstinctive and I just gently patted her shoulder and stood by her and she calmed down.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nYou had the feeling that you are an ambassador between the museum and the public and,\nand you try to be a good influence and help and represent the museum and all of that.\nMany other stories.",
        "Q: How has it been working with the other volunteers?",
        "A: I met the nicest bunch. First I went on Wednesday afternoons and then Larry asked if\nthere were anybody here who would be willing to work on weekends because that\u2019s when\nthey really need help. So I decided sure if that\u2019s what\u2019s wanted. And I work on\nSaturdays, first in the afternoons and in the morning. Every second Saturday. And that\nworked out very well. As I said everything was fine until I got my trouble with the knee\nand the ankle. So I hope it will improve so I can do more. But I found it very\nchallenging and very nice. There\u2019s always the odd pill in every crowd. There was one\nthat was particularly odd but she\u2019s no longer there I\u2019m happy to say. And on the whole, I\nfound them very pleasant. Not everybody was pleasant but most of them are. And\nsome of them have stories to tell. Again which makes me feel guilty because I didn\u2019t go\nthrough what they went through. It\u2019s always that conflict.",
        "Q: You mean the other volunteers?",
        "A: The volunteers, yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Survivors had stories to tell. And how does that come up?",
        "A: Well I know that Nessy Golden for one, she\u2019s legendary. When we had our training\nshe was the speaker. She told us about when she was young child, when she was 15 and\nshe was 1n on one of the worst camps and told of life in camp and, and you know ever\nsince, whenever I see her, my arms around her and hug her. And compared to her I feel\nguilty. It\u2019s not my fault mind you. I know that. But the interesting thing is I discussed this\nwith another volunteer and she looked at me. She said you have the same feelings. She\nsaid I thought I was the only one and I said oh thank god there\u2019s more and it\u2019s a common\nfeeling for those of us who had not had the utmost pain that the others did.",
        "Q: Have you had more contact with survivors and other refugees through your work at\nthe museum than you had before as far as opportunity to talk about \u2014",
        "A: Opportunity arise there which I didn\u2019t have before. Yes.",
        "Q: Has that been helpful to you to have a chance to talk about some of these things?",
        "A: Absolutely. I mean it\u2019s\u2019 fascinating. There are some such dear people I look at them\nand I listen to their past as very young people in the camp and I say to myself, how can\nthis man be so pleasant and so normal what he went through you know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Are those things that you didn\u2019t think about before or \u2014",
        "A: Well those are things which I thought about before but had not been confronted with\nin the flesh. And you meet these people actually and you wonder about the human spirit,\nhow much it can take and stay normal.",
        "Q: Overall would you say it\u2019s been more upsetting for you or it\u2019s been more helpful to\nyou to have the volunteer experience?",
        "A: Oh it\u2019s been heartwarming. It has filled an empty place. I wanted to do something\nimportant, something necessary. I was feeling too comfortable here, a little isolated with\nnot terribly much to do and I think that the, for the rest of my life, until I am no longer\nable to, I want to be involved with this museum. I just love it.",
        "Q: You started as a volunteer?",
        "A: At the very beginning when they were first open, I was there before they opened they\nmuseum to the public the day before. There\u2019s another little story. I went with my very\nnice mature daughter Jenny. And we went through the museum and she went you know\nwhere those boxes are where adults look down at a series of clips below, pictures and\nfilm clips about the really horrendous things that they don\u2019t want kids to see. And that\u2019s\nthe experiments and beatings and that sort of thing. It\u2019s kind of sad how many people are\nalways eager to look down at that. Jenny came up to me and she said mom she said,\ndon\u2019t ever look at those. And I knew exactly what she meant because I\u2019m the type if I see\nan animal being treated cruelly, I can\u2019t get over it. And you see some of these things it\nsears your soul. You can\u2019t forget it. She did me a big favor. And I\u2019ve been working there\nsince the beginning and I have never gone and looked at those things. Never. And she\nwarned me. I\u2019m very grateful to her. Had I looked at that, I probably couldn\u2019t continue\nworking at the museum. You would have to shield yourself against the utter horror.\nThere\u2019s limits to what you can take. In fact I\u2019m going to travel to eastern Europe in the\nlate fall and on the way there will be a chance to go to the camps and I\u2019m not going to go.\nI don\u2019t\u2019 think I could face it. It\u2019s enough that I go through the permanent exhibit. It\u2019s not\nbecause I don\u2019t\u2019 care, but maybe because I care too much that I don\u2019t want to go.",
        "Q: Now you are working less with visitor services and you are spending some time doing\ntranslations \u2014",
        "A: The purple folder is full of a document which was on tape, a videotape in German.\nFirst I took it down wordy by word in German. 39 pages of it and now I\u2019m translating it.\nFrom the German to English. Unfortunately I\u2019m not ready yet for word processors and\nthings like that. I understand the museum might give courses on that. I\u2019d like that. I\u2019m\ndoing it by hand. It would be lovely if I could just sort of tick it off like this.",
        "Q: So you do this in longhand?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Oh yes, that\u2019s why it\u2019s taking me a little longer.",
        "Q: Do you go down to the museum to do this?",
        "A: When it\u2019s done, Pll go down. In the meantime I have a sufficient amount I\u2019!] mail it\nto Ms. Rubin. Amy Rubin, I work for her. She\u2019s a lovely girl and I want to have her\nknow that in working on this, it\u2019s taking quite a while.",
        "Q: I wanted to understand the process. The museum lends you the video.",
        "A: I could do it all there in the library. But I\u2019ve chosen to do it at home. It makes no\ndifference to me.",
        "Q: So you put the video \u2014",
        "A: I do the, I take the information from the video at the library of course with their\nmachines. And then when I have the document I go home and I translate it.",
        "Q: I see. And what is that like for you?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Fascinating. For instance, I\u2019Il tell you there is this wonderful video on. It\u2019s called\n\u201cWeapons of the Spirit\u201d and it\u2019s about the wonderful French Huguenots mountain village\nof Le Chambon and they\u2019re legendary for their aid that they gave to Jewish refugees.\nThey\u2019re famous for it. In fact if you\u2019d like me to lend you this, it\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s called\n\u201cWeapons of the Spirit\u201d. Ad it\u2019s this very stirring which I\u2019ve always been so moved by\nthat this particular translation is of a man who was a French Swiss who worked at Le\nChambon during the war, helping numerous children, carrying for them, nourishing\nthem, helping them escape. And how they village of Le Chambon worked with him.\nAnd it was a very famous priest. Father Trocm\u00e9, legendary and he\u2019s mentioned in this\nmanuscript. So I have been so thrilled to be working with this material because even\nbefore I knew of the museum, I was touched by the story of Le Chambon and how they\nhelped the Jews there. They were all Huguenots, not Catholics. It\u2019s very thrilling\nmaterial. First I did the story of his wife, and now I\u2019m doing his story and it\u2019s absolutely\nthrilling work. And it shows you the heroism that people are capable of. This is a\nparticularly, this is not the story only of suffering and victimization but it\u2019s what one man\nwith good will can do to prevent horrors from happening and to get, he always\nemphasizes in this report that he didn\u2019t do it by himself. He had the help of the village\npeople and other priests and many others. But he had this gift of networking which is a\ngift. And he used it to full advantage to save many lives. And you can imagine how\nhonored I am to be working with this story.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: You said some minutes ago that working with the museum is heartwarming for you.\nCould you say how that \u2014",
        "A: Maybe that\u2019s the wrong phrase. I just have the feeling that it engages my heart, my\nemotions. I\u2019m fully committed to bring out the best that this museum has to offer and\nshare it with the public. I have had no dealings with creating it or furnishing or anything\nbut what I am able to do as 1s be in between the museum and the public and convey to\nthem some of what the museum is about. And I feel that I am uniquely qualified to do\nthat. And that is satisfying.",
        "Q: And what do you think is the best that the museum has to offer. What is it that you\nwant to convey?",
        "A: It teaches the world about the Holocaust. That is its purpose. And it\u2019s, sometimes I\nlook through the book that visitors leave data on, their thoughts about it and it\u2019s\nmarvelous, wonderful what they have to say about it. You get the occasional oddball that\nsays something horrible, but fortunately they are few and far between. The majority of\npeople are absolutely enthralled by it.",
        "Q: What kinds of things do you remember people saying?\nA: How wonderful for you to be here and show the world or this sort of thing must never\nhappen again. And God couldn\u2019t, may God prevent this from happening again. Thank\nyou so much for showing the gratitude and astonishment and you know it\u2019s marvelous.\nIt\u2019s just fascinating. I don\u2019t know if people know that they can go up to the second floor\nand look through these books of what others say about it. At the, you know at the end of\nthe exhibition that crosses the Hall of Remembrance and then when you go through the\nlittle corridor there these big books that you can write in. And it shows you that the\npublic really does appreciate it.",
        "Q: Do you feel that your work is appreciated?",
        "A: Definitely. ? ve had numerous, we have one little gimmick that\u2019s very satisfying. Each\none of us receives every month, ten tickets. Now you know the tickets are free but you\nhave to wait in line for a long time. And it\u2019s very convenient to be handed a ticket. Now\nI don\u2019t always have ten family members or intimate friends that I give these tickets to.\nSo I keep them in my purse and when I\u2019m at the museum. And when that hour finally\narrives when there\u2019s no more tickets, and I see some desperate young visitor from a far\noff country, I\u2019m so glad I could slip her ticket or him and oh, right after the Oklahoma\nbombing, I had the Attorney General of Oklahoma. He was in the news just the other\nday. I forget his name right now. It\u2019s Boswerson or something. Very nice man. And he\nlooked at me. I had no idea who he was. And he said oh what a shame. He said I can\u2019t\nget any ticket and I\u2019m only here for a day. And I said where are you from. He saidOklahoma. He said I\u2019m the attorney general. No, he didn\u2019t\u2019 say that then. He just said he\nwas from Oklahoma and I liked the way he looked. He seemed like a nice human being\nso I reached into my pocket and I said here let me give you this little pass. I hate for you\nto be here for nothing. And he thanked me so much and dashed off. Hours later he found\nme where I was collecting tickets or something and said I want to thank you so much for\nmaking it possible for me to see. He said I\u2019m the Attorney General of Oklahoma and I\nsaid oh my god, I said your poor state. I\u2019m so sorry for what you had to go through. And\nit was just like instant friendship. We never see each other again. But I don\u2019t\u2019 think\nwe'll ever forget each other. And it\u2019s that sort of human story that is so enriching you\nknow. And many other instances that I can\u2019t remember of a direct contact with another\nlife, brief but you don\u2019t\u2019 forget it. I just said I can\u2019t remember. But you know what I\nmean. Different various instances remain in my mind.",
        "Q: What else would you like to talk about?",
        "A: Well I ok, let me say that I appreciate that the museum gives us folks a chance to\nvoice our experiences from where we came from and where we are and how it felt and\nhow it was. This is a wonderful thing that you\u2019re letting us do and it\u2019s always nice to\nhave a voice and to be counted and to be heard from and I appreciate that and I want to\nrepeat that I really love the museum and I\u2019m terribly glad they came to the city.

I passed that for the day courses.\nAnd then my parents took me aside and said Ruthie, there just isn\u2019t the money there.\nYou\u2019re just going to have to take a day time job, go to night school. Well I was very\nupset about that. All my friends who were able to go to Cooper Union were going in the\nday time. And it was very hard for me to work at jobs, sales jobs. The worst job I ever\nhad as a very young person, oh this was ghastly was in some horrible neighborhood\ndowntown where we spray painted little monkey masks. You know the little faces on\nlittle monkeys. We spray painted them. Every time I sneezed I\u2019d get out a different\nrainbow color. It was unhealthy and unpleasant. It was I would say factory work. It was\njust ghastly. Well I did, the jobs I got in those days were not very good. And it was a\ngreat strain to work at that and then go to night school. And after a while I, I just dropped\nout. And much to my regret, really. And then I, eventually after many lesser and less\nenjoyable jobs, I found a lovely secretarial job with Paramount theaters in the Paramount\nbuilding in Times Square where I stayed for four years and I really enjoyed it. I was\nordering candy for the theater chains and doing secretarial. Candy was bigger with them\nthan the films were. They got more revenue from that. And I stayed with them. Oh I\nmust tell you how I got the job at the State Department in Washington. Would you like\nto hear how I got that?",

And they offered me such a hideous assignment\nthat I simply switched to domestic because I thought I\u2019d be happier than oh what was this\ncountry. It was land locked. And I can\u2019t think of the name right now. But it was the least\nappealing country in Latin America. No ocean, no nothing. And I thought to myself to,\nto lose two years of my life in this boon docks. That didn\u2019t seem right. And so I simply\nand in those days you can get a second choice. And so I switched to domestic and I\nworked in the Latin American division with my previous knowledge of Spanish. And I\nhad a very good time as a single girl in Washington. I enjoyed myself. And then I met my\nhusband to be. And that starts another chapter in my life.\nQ: And how did you meet him?",

        "Q: Do you think that\u2019s because of your previous experience that you would have been\nmore likely to speak up?",
        "Q: What about having children? Was that for you do you think a different experience\nbecause of your previous life in Germany and\u2014",

People had always told me through the years, Randy why don\u2019t you\nbe a docent, maybe at the Smithsonian or something. And I\u2019d say yeah, yeah. I didn\u2019t\u2019\nreally want to.

My mother\nsometimes with friends might go to temple for high holy days, Jewish high holy days.\nBut other than that she never did and my father simply was not a church goer, although\nhe was a very religious man. When I was a teenager I spoke to him once and he didn\u2019t\nanswer me, didn\u2019t answer me. And after about five minutes, he looked at me and he said\nI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t answer you, I was praying. That was his religion and it was very deep.\nBut he was not a church goer. But he accomplished miracles as you will later find out.\nAnd I\u2019m sure it had something to do with his relationship he had with the higher being.",
        "A: I was actually baptized. And you know I was young child. No, no I mean I wasn\u2019t a\ntoddler or an infant. I was already, I can\u2019t remember how old I was. Maybe five,\nsomething like that. And they decided that I should be baptized. And we went to Pastor\nNeemuler\u2019s church but he was not there. Someone else baptized me but with water from\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe Rubes spray in Berlin. And I remember we came home from that and my mother had\na close Jewish girlfriend who heartily disapproved. She thought it was just terrible. And\nshe told them that. But then she invited them in for coffee and cake to celebrate.",
        "A: Probably. Or a little later. I don\u2019t know whether I was, I cannot remember what age I\nwas. I might have been older than, probably they might have done it a little later when\nthings were beginning to look really bad. 33 was still fairly early, you know. I wasn\u2019t\naware of what was really happening.",
        "A: Yes and you know you have these roving bands of Brown Shirts, singing anti-Semitic\nsongs and torch parades. A little bit awesome and scary, that sort of thing.",
        "A: If I ever had one, I don\u2019t think I ever saw it. Honestly. My mother must, I don\u2019t know.\nI just, ve never seen it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: This being Germany, you can be darned sure. They had documentation for everything.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: A public school until a certain time period, later in the 30s. When Jewish children\nwere no longer allowed in public school. And under the logic of the Nazis they had me\nfigured out as being three-fourths Jewish. So I went for a time, only for a time cause then\nwe left Germany, to a private Jewish school.",
        "A: The Nazis.",
        "A: It would be like city hall. You know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Yes, mm hm, well anything is documented so they knew exactly everyone\u2019s, they\nknew my roots better than I did.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Distressing. Scary. All of a sudden I was taken out of my, although I must tell you,\nthat the public school was no longer a pleasure. There was one teacher who was very\nanti-Semitic and was perfectly beastly to us Jewish children.",
        "A: Oh it was just her sharpness and her nastiness. I don\u2019t remember details. Very quick to\nslap faces, things like that.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Yes, mm hm.",
        "A: Well it was the custom in Europe for the teachers to do that. It wasn\u2019t, I mean, now it\nwould be a shocking thing, but in those days it was done.",
        "A: You know that is vague to me. I don\u2019t really remember any particular Jewish, none of\nus children really paid attention to our different religion. We were just kids together. And\nI to this day I could not tell you who was Jewish and who wasn\u2019t. I think there probably\nwere more non-Jewish children in that class. There may have been a handful besides\nmyself.",
        "A: I always thought of my, thanks to the Nazis, I thought of myself as three-fourths\nJewish and one-fourth Christian.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Being three-fourths of one religion and one-fourth of another religion.",
        "A: I wish I could really explain it to you. Later upon maturity, I realized much more\nabout what it means.",
        "A: As a child it was just a religion that for some reason wasn\u2019t popular at that time in that\ncountry. I was just a child.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. I remember going to this Jewish school which was in a nice suburb there, called\nRosentav, which means valley of roses. And not really now wait a minute. That may not\nhave been there. But the lady, my mother\u2019s best friend whom I stayed with for a while,\nshe lived in Rosentav. I remember having to take a bus in the mornings to get to the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nschool. I can\u2019t tell you to this day where it was. But it was a very nice school and\neveryone there was Jewish and they were all new faces to me. So.",
        "A: The one big difference was that I had to learn Hebrew, which was very difficult and of\ncourse, I never really learned it. I just learned some of the symbols and how to\npronounce them and how to read them. But you know that time period could not have\nlasted very long because I didn\u2019t do that very long. And it was must be shortly thereafter\nthat we left. That means in other words, that I didn\u2019t leave the German public school.\nWell I left Germany in 39. Probably 38.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I think I was nine. I was ten when I left. Yeah.",
        "A: Well there were Hitler\u2019s speeches on the loudspeakers in the streets. I would hear this\nmale voice shouting and of course his Austrian accent. I never was able to understand a\nword that the man was shouting. He could have been talking another language. I didn\u2019t\nunderstand what he said. And there were all sorts of things in the newspapers which of\ncourse I didn\u2019t read but I heard my father and my mother discussing them at home in the\nevening. And he would you know furrow his brow and be very worried and he always\nthought that this couldn\u2019t last. This was just something that would go away.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: My father. Sorry, my father. And he just couldn\u2019t believe that this madness could\nstay and they would be talking. There was a current joke that went around in Berlin that\nit ended with the Jews and the bicyclists. And the question would be why the bicyclists.\nAnd then the answer would be why the Jews. And that time it was one of the current\njokes. It sounds better in German. And let me see what else. It was just a general\nfeeling of, I don\u2019t know, something dark surrounding us. And of course, shall I go on\nabout when my father left or do you want to ask me that later.",
        "A: All right. He had his own export import firm and then he hired a new secretary and\nthis was my mother to be. And, they, she was his secretary for about four years and it\nwas a one man company. And of course no, he had people that worked for him but they\nwere salesmen. It was export import and it was doing quite nicely.",
        "A: I, [remember he had British Yardley\u2019s so and things like that. All sort of different\nthings. And everything went along well. My parents got married after they had known\neach other for four years. I was born the next year. By then it was 1928. And his\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbusiness folded. Times were bad. Horrible. And he ended up scrounging around for all\nsorts of different jobs.",
        "A: I believe so. I don\u2019t know. I think it was the economic climate. I don\u2019t know if it was\na depression that had touched Germany. As well. I\u2019m not clear about the economic\nreasons. I just know that before I was born, or while I was still an infant this business was\nno longer supporting him.",
        "A: You mean his father.",
        "A: Yes. For the same reason that I was considered three fourths Jewish, he was\nconsidered one half Jewish yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: He had been in World War I. He had gotten the Iron Cross, second class and he had\nbeen a patriotic German and he was 40 when I was born. He had had a very happy young\nmanhood in Berlin, enjoying himself. Enjoying life in Germany. And all this came like a\nbad dream and he couldn\u2019t believe that it was going to last.",
        "A: Oh he scrounged around. He sold vacuum cleaners. He was a wine salesman. You see\nhis great gift was salesmanship. He used to, his nickname was Fredl. They used to joke\nFredl could sell refrigerators to Eskimos. He really could. And so he kept us afloat with\nthat. And my mother, when I was older, she went and got herself a job at something\ncalled the Palestina Unt. The office for Palestine, a Jewish organization, near where we\nlived. And she had a regular office job there, secretarial. And she had that job actually\nuntil we left. Oh, but before she got that, she tried everything. And I\u2019m going to jump\nahead and say when my dad left.",
        "A: She took on a job as a housekeeper for a very nice well-to-do Jewish family and it\nwas really nice because there was a young woman there who she became very good\nfriends with. And her grandfather, the young woman\u2019s grandfather and her mother who\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nseemed to be a little bit retarded. Some kind of emotional problems. Her grandfather\nwas a marvelous old gentleman and they sort of adopted me as the child of the house, and\nspoiled me. And my mother did cleaning and cooking and it was something she\u2019d never\ndone before but she was really great, very adaptable and hardworking, just to keep us\ngoing.",
        "A: Yes and also we started out in a lovely apartment when I was born. Then we went to a\nslightly less wonderful apartment. And finally ended up in a furnished room. Things\nwere really, really bad. We were poor.",
        "A: All right. This was still before Kristallnacht. But things were bad and he was\nstruggling and one day a letter came from City Hall to present himself in the next day\nwith his passport. And he knew something was up. He was very intelligent and aware,\neven though he couldn\u2019t believe that this would last but he knew that things were getting\ndangerous.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well I'll tell you. At that time my mother was already employed at the Palestina Unt.\nYeah, I get confused. He called her at work. And he said Edith, come home and help me\npack. Tonight I have to leave Germany. And he explained that they wanted him to\npresent himself with his passport at City Hall and he knew what that meant. They were\ngoing to put a J in it for Jew, which would mean that his traveling would be severely\ncurtailed if not made impossible. And he decided he was going to flee that night. Get out\nof there.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Well. I think he went to his great aunt Matilda and borrowed some, she was the\nChristian part of the family and quite well off. And she lent him some money and he, I\nthink he took a train to um, somehow he found -- there was two places he went to. He\nwas in Amsterdam and he was in London, trying to find a stepping stone. I\u2019m a little\nconfused where he went first. And then eventually he ended up briefly in New York to\ngain a foothold. But in order to enter legally into the United States, he needed a quota\nnumber, visa. And so in those days, people in that position would either go to Canada.\nSome ended up in China. In Shanghai. And he opted or maybe it was the only choice hehad to go to Havana Cuba, to wait for this and so that\u2019s what happened. In the meantime,\nwe had a year without him. And I must tell you he was a marvelous cook. He was a great\ncook and he had made a bouillabaisse his last day and I remember after he had left, he\nhad left in the evening. And I don\u2019t quite know what mode of transportation. He must\nhave taken the train to Hamburg, to take the boat over to England, something like that.\nThere we were with his soup that he had left. And I remember my mother and I eating\nthat soup and the tears were just rolling down our cheeks. And for many, many, many\nyears, I couldn\u2019t stand bouillabaisse. I just couldn\u2019t stand. Then much later on I\ndeveloped a real liking for it because we were together again. That was something. It was\na terrible shock to have him gone all of a sudden. But he saved himself and he saved us.\nBy that action.",
        "A: OH a great deal of it. In fact fear was our constant companion. Because then we had\nKristallnacht. November ninth wasn\u2019t it? 1938. I believe. And my mother was a real\nBerliner. There\u2019s an expression in Berlin. If somebody comes at you all excited, we say\nNabublensten (German) which means oh so where\u2019s the fire? You know. So at 4:00 in\nthe morning or at 4:30 or 5 there\u2019s a pounding at the door. And my mother gets up out of\nher sleep. This is some time after my father left. I don\u2019t\u2019 know how long. And all grumpy\nand she goes to the door and opens it and she said so where\u2019s the fire? And the person\nknocking on the door said the temple across the street 1s on fire. The Jewish temple. Thiswas Fazanemistrasse. The corner had hotel Kampinski at it. That was the last address\nwe had in Berlin. And kitty corner from us across the street was the, a Jewish synagogue,\nwhich is now by the way the Jewish Community Center. I saw it in 1978. They did\nsomething very smart. They saved the front of this temple. It had been a beautiful\nbuilding. They saved the doorway and made a modern building for the Jewish\nCommunity Center, and put the doorway there. It was a striking and very beautiful thing.\nAnd the strange feelings come back after so many years and see that. But anyway to get\nback to that horrible night or morning. My mother must have gone out the door to take a\npeek at it. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember. She left me upstairs in bed or maybe I slept through all of\nthis. I don\u2019t know. And I remember. She stayed home that day. And I remember saying\noh how nice. You don\u2019t have to go to work. You\u2019re staying with me. And I remember her\nsad smile and she said but what a reason. I was too young to understand the horrible\nthings that were going on around me. And another really nightmare moment was we at\nthis time lived in a furnished room. And I in fact slept on a cot in the kitchen. It was a\nnice big old Berlin apartment and the lady who lived there was a wonderful old lady. Her\nname was Mrs. Moses. I think her first name was Martha. I\u2019m not sure. She had a\nretarded daughter, a little shriveled lady, must have been in her 40s or 50s, scared me\nterribly because I didn\u2019t know about retardation. But she was kindness itself, very old and\ntired looking. And she was very good to my mother and myself. She had some other\ntenants there too. She had her son living in the apartment above her. And_ I think it was\nthe day after the fire or very shortly thereabouts that there was talk of Jewish men being\nsearched for by hordes of SA men. You know those were the Brown Shirts. And therewas a brass door sign next to the apartment door. Outside the front door and it said\nMoses on it. That was her name. And some very smart person across the way said, you\nknow if I were you, I would unscrew those screws and take that sign off. It\u2019s a very\nJewish name. They\u2019re bound to come to you. And my mother was real feisty Berliner\nalways, said oh that\u2019s not necessary. She didn\u2019t want to do that. And the reason prevailed\nand they did it. And it\u2019s a darned good thing because later on we heard these boots on the\nstairs. My mother and I were inside the pantry. With her arms around me, shaking like\naspen leaves when we heard those pounding boots coming up the stairs. And we heard\nsomebody say \u201cOh, don\u2019t ring there. There\u2019s no Jews there\u201d and they went on up. I\nbelieve they got her son, either that time or later. And I don\u2019t know. She and her daughter\nmust have ended up dead. It was just dreadful. Anyhow, that is a moment that is\nprobably the most frightening moment of my life. And we crept out of the pantry. The\nNazis had gone. And then shortly thereafter 1t must have been that word came that we\nshould go to H\u2014from my father who had at this point reached Havana. And, and he said,\nhe wrote, go to Hamburg. Go to the Cuban consulate and get all your documentation and\nsoon I\u2019Il be able to send for you. And so my mother and I took the\u2014and early morning\ntrain. It was still dark, from Berlin to Hamburg.",
        "A: No. As a child your sense of time is really non-existent. It\u2019s fueled by events. I simply\ncannot tell you. It must have been shortly thereafter. I\u2019m sure. And so there we were. I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthought it was the greatest treat in the world to sit in the dining car, a little ship. No,\nwhite table cloths and silver and waiters. And I remember eating a soft boiled gg and\nlooking out the train window. I took my enjoyment where I found it you know. (laughs) I\nthought that was great. Well then we trudged through Hamburg and we went to the\nconsulate. Everything was fine. It was lunch time. And I was getting hungry. And my\nmother, everywhere she saw a restaurant it said Jews aren\u2019t wanted, forbidden to Jews.\nAnd she was a mother first and she decided the heck with all of this. She had young child\nhere and she was going to see to it that that child got some lunch. And so we just walked\ninto one of those restaurants and ate. And of course it didn\u2019t mean much to me but you\ncan imagine her feeling. And then shortly after that I was able to leave the school and\nhappy word came that \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, this was just a trip to get documentation from the Cuban consulate. And then\nshortly there\u2014",
        "A: We went right back to, to Berlin.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: You\u2019re asking me something I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not, I can look at the map here. How\nfar is Hamburg from Berlin. Maybe\u2014let\u2019s see Hamburg.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh my yes. It was several hours.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that. It must have just been a day trip, yes. And so then the\nwonderful word came that we would be able to leave. And do you want to ask, I mean\nanything else. Or should I go on to that now. Word came and my mother got ready.\nPrepared everything. You know now I have to go back to childhood memories, before I\ncontinue with this. Let me delve back. You know we started moving from one nice\napartment to one less nice, to one less nice, to a furnished room. I remember a lovely\nplace we had. Geisenhimerstrasse is the place. It was outside of Berlin and it was a\nlittle apartment with a balcony but it was on the ground floor. And I remember, at that\ntime I was four years old. And I was just starting, having this impulse to draw pictures.\nAnd so I remember sitting at a little table, on a little chair on this balcony. It had a hedge\naround it to separate it from the road. And I would sit there with paper and pencil and\nscribble and scribble happy as could be. I remember that clearly. The first apartment Iremember. In fact, my first memory was waking up from a sleep and my parents were in\nthe next room packing and we were going to Denmark the next day for a little trip. That\nwas my very first memory. I think I was three then or something.",
        "A: Oh yes, my parents were my world. I had no siblings and they were always absolutely\nwonderful parents. We had a happy relationship. Trouble free. And that, why did I go\ninto that-- oh later on when I came back with my mother in 78, we visited this apartment\nbecause that was the only place that held happy memories for me. It was raining cats and\ndogs and the apartment, the whole neighborhood was now filled with Turkish labor\nimmigrants. They, you know you\u2019ve read about the Turks that, and they were having a\nvery hard time and foreigner hating Germany you know. And there were these Turks in\nthat apartment. We couldn\u2019t make ourselves understood that we used to live here. That\nwe wanted to see it. It was a blank. And it was rainy. I felt heartbroken. I don\u2019t know why\nbut I felt so sad. Anyway that was\u2014I\u2019m digressing here. I went back into the past. Now\nthis, why did I do that now. What was I trying to tell you?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: It\u2019s not, leaving that neighborhood. We had to leave that apartment because we just\ndidn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t have any more money. And that\u2019s when the furnished room life started.\nAnd no I think there was one more apartment, high under the roof, which wasn\u2019t too bad.\nAnd then came the furnished room. But anyway, the day that we had to leave\nGeisenhimerstrasse, there was neighborhood Punch and Judy show. In German it\u2019s\ncalled Caspela Teata and all the neighborhood children were getting ready to sit and\nwatch it. And I had to leave. I had to drive away with my parents. That very time. And I\nfelt so bereft, you know. So that was a sad thing.",
        "A: Well that home, yes. But then later, leaving Fazanemistrasse to go on the boat to\nCuba was unbelievable happiness. I was not sorry to leave that Germany.",
        "A: All right. I had to, I was never one for dolls but I had a lot of stuffed toys and\nparticularly I loved a white stuffed cat, beautiful little white stuffed cat with green glass\neye, a little pink nose and a moustache. I loved it. And for some reason, with all the\nexcitement of packing and getting ready to leave that got left behind. And I don\u2019t know\nwhether we were 1n a taxi to the train or 1n the train or what. All of a sudden I\nremembered and I said oh Mutti, I forgot the cat and can we go back and she said no, oh\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nno. I mean can you imagine in her mind going back and being snapped up. Of course\nnot. But you know to this day I have regrets about that stuffed cat. And other than that.",
        "A: Well, it was not a living animal. It was a stuffed toy animal.",
        "A: Childhood memories. It is so strange. My art teacher suggested a subject because I\nwas at a standstill. She said why don\u2019t you paint your childhood memories. And it\nunleashed a torrent in me and it had a very odd result. I had been planning a trip through\nthe Rhine country, a picturesque German towns along the river. When I got through\npainting this painting, I had gotten so closely back into my childhood self, that I was\ntotally unable to go to Germany. And I changed my travel plans and went to Greece\ninstead.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Oh my lord yes, and you know it was catharsis. It just came out.",
        "A: As I did the painting yes.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019d be happy to. Down here you see this cornucopia with the colorful objects.",
        "A: The lower right. I\u2019m going to go from the lower right hand. Now in Germany when\nchildren reached school age their loving families present them with these cardboard\ncornucopias filled with candy. This is a German tradition for your first day of school. I\nremember mine was just somewhere, I have a photo of myself with that in my arms. It\nwas like this big. And it was filled with candy, and but this year symbolizes. It\u2019s lying on\nthe ground with all these colors spilled out of it. And I think of that as my spoiled\nchildhood.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Yes. Spilled, spoiled yes.",
        "A: Well instead of having a normal childhood, going through the normal schools in the\nnormal way, it took all sorts of odd twists and turns and humiliations and scares and that\nsort of thing.",
        "A: Now you see there a little girl with her arms outstretched floating after a white toy cat.\nThat\u2019s the story I told before, that to this day I\u2019m searching for that.",
        "A: Thank you, yes. So that is there. To the right of it is the Punch and Judy show. If you\nlook at it very closely there\u2019s a devil with a pitchfork and horns. These are all red. And\nthere\u2019s Caspela or Punch as he was called in English with his stick and his pointy cap\nand his red nose. And later on when I was all filled anew with, with fury at what hadhappened, I somehow thought of the Punch as a typical stupid German and the devil\nmainly Hitler or Goebbels leading him on. I thought of that later, with an adult mind,\nfairly recently. As a child I just thought of it as Punch and Judy but somehow it fits into\nthat painting. You know, for that reason. Now to the left of this you see a black\nrectangle, with a white bulb on the top and you see two shapes. A large female shape and\na small female shape. Clutching each other. And that was my mother and I in the pantry\nclutching each other in deadly fear. Behind it you see gray steps going up and a large red\nswastika behind it. That was the sound we heard of the Nazi boots on the stairs. Now if\nthere\u2019s anything else in here that you want to ask me about.",
        "A: Well all right. Emotional. It\u2019s both good and bad. Here you see a gray ship going\nthrough the ocean, bravely headed in a new direction. And that was the German ship the\nOrenachal and my mother and I were lucky to get tickets on that. We were in fourth\nclass, steerage. We were down in a down below in a huge room shared with many other\nwomen. I think there were 40 of them and lower bunks and upper-- my mother and I of\ncourse were together I think it was a lower bunk. And what she had done, brave lady,\nwe had a wonderful oil painting. It\u2019s right over there. It\u2019s a self-portrait of a great, great\ngrandfather of mine who had artistic talent. And he did this painting of himself in the\nearlier part of the 19\" century. And so she took it out of the frame because this was the\none true antique that we had of great sentimental value, a self-portrait of an ancestor. And\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nshe rolled it up and we slept with it between us in a cardboard roll. That was the one thing\nshe managed to get out. You know. And now it\u2019s hanging there. Anyhow that was a\npretty unpleasant trip. I mean the sleeping conditions \u2014 the food wasn\u2019t too bad. It was\nsimple but good. And I as a child enjoyed everything. The adults of course are worried\nsick and uncomfortable.",
        "A: Yes and in fact there\u2019s something in there I\u2019m going to tell you about, yes, because the\nfirst \u2014 ok, this here what you see here is \u2014",
        "A: And I\u2019m still in the middle here. There\u2019s a black and white tile floor. There are tables\nwith white table cloths, an elegant French door, palm trees, or palm bushes in pots. Very\nelegant salon. Well there was a lady on the ship who was a very well to do Jewish lady\nand she was traveling first class. My mother and she were acquainted. And one day she\ninvited us up to first class for tea. Now we had been for quite some time down in the\nhold. And here I am a little girl. And when we went up there I heard violin music playing\nand waiters scurrying by with trays. And I saw all this luxury and it made a very deep\nimpression on me. It really did. The next picture you see is a man, my father, wearing his\nblue bow tie, white shirt, and gray pants with his arms raised in the air, and he\u2019s standing\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nunder a palm tree and bidding us welcome. Very welcoming figure. And were we ever\nhappy to see him. And then it goes on the painting swirls up to the right above and there\u2019s\nlittle girls floating around. Those were the little girls I became friends with once we\nsettled in Cuba. And they were very lovely. And of course I didn\u2019t speak Spanish and\nthey didn\u2019t speak German. But I managed to learn both Spanish and English, at least\nstarting to while I had that year and a half in Havana. And the end of the painting at the\nupper right, you see these white towers, skyscrapers. You see the stars in the sky turning\ninto the stars in the American flag and this was the land of our dreams, which I didn\u2019t\u2019\nknow yet. And I saw these miraculous skyscrapers up there and we had to get there. And\nthat was the idealized version of it. That pretty well describes everything.",
        "A: Thank you.",

        "A: Oh that is no, I don\u2019t\u2019 remember those things.",
        "A: No, I just remember I have never had a terribly good memory. I just remember the\nemotional parts or the dramatic parts. How I got somewhere, how long it took, this is all\ngray area. It\u2019s something I honestly don\u2019t know. At that time I was about nine years old.",
        "A: Yes, to Havana. Oh and we stopped in Antwerp once. All I remember there are houses\nwith blue tiles. We stopped there shortly.",
        "A: The German crew for the fourth class were very decent. Nobody ever was rude or\nnasty. They were very decent and in fact my father always had high regard for the\nGerman navy. Men who were at sea. He had wanted to become a naval officer but his\nastigmatism kept him from that. And no, no there was not one instance of any kind of\nrudeness or mistreatment. They were other very interesting Jewish people who were\nprofessional people who were also down there in steerage and we enjoyed each other\u2019s\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncompany. And I had photo of that little girl with a scarf and a little sailor doll. We must\nhave bought on board, looking as happy as could be.",
        "A: The people down at that level certainly were.",
        "A: Just a terrific contrast between our steerage and that first class salon with the violin\nmusic. It was unbelievable. I stood there thunderstruck. I thought I was dreaming it all\nyou know. And of course I enjoyed seeing the gray north Atlantic. I had never been at\nsea be\u2014I mean no I was at Vonnzee which 1s a huge lake. I had never been by the\nocean. I loved it, I thought it was just wonderful. I\u2019ve loved it ever since.",
        "A: Yes, I have a cute story to tell about my father. Shows you what kind of a man he was.\nFirst of all he boarded the ship with a pilot, somehow he wrangled that. Greeted us all\n(inaudible, outside interference) It was heaven. It was so wonderful. I had always adored\nmy Popi and it was just shear heaven to be with him again and I\u2019m sure my mother felt\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe same. And then of course he couldn\u2019t\u2019 take us right off because there was a sort of\nCuban version of Ellis Island called Tresconia. I think it means three horns in Spanish\nbut I\u2019m not sure. And again with a child\u2019s different look at things, I thought it was\nfantastic. And it was this ancient garden with palm trees. I had never seen palm trees\nbefore and they were so wonderful I thought. And we had the, really unpleasant\nconditions. There were no mattresses. And we slept right on the metallic springboards\nwith a sheet over it, but it was the tropics. It was very hot and it wasn\u2019t too uncomfortable\nto me. The only thing I remember eating there was sweet black coffee and red beans. I\ndon\u2019t remember anything else. I thought it was great. I enjoyed it. And my father got us\nout of there within two or three days.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. He had already made living arrangements so he came to get us much\nquicker than we had anticipated. Other people were still there. I remember saying\ngoodbye to them and out of sight, out of mind. I don\u2019t\u2019 even remember anyone in\nparticular there. So my father confronted my mother and he said Edith you have to be\nvery brave. Now you can imagine that I couldn\u2019t get something very good and you know\nwe don\u2019t\u2019 have any money and you have to be brave. It\u2019s a bit of a slum but at least we\u2019re\ntogether. And she said oh Fredl it doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re together. It\u2019s so wonderful. We\nall happily drove to whatever horrible place awaited us. Well he had had his little joke,\nbecause he had rented half of a two family house, typical Cuban with gorgeous tile floor,\nlovely veranda. Rented furniture. We had rocking chairs. The one thing I remember\ninside was a tray with tall glasses from Woolworth\u2019s with big red dots on them. Anda\ndecanter and this, these are the tropics. It looked so good and so inviting and the house\ninside was cool. And these wonderful old tile floors. Well we couldn\u2019t believe it. He had\ntotally tricked us. We were so happy, we didn\u2019t know what to think. He had his little\njoke. He was so happy too to have his family again. And I must tell you. This is where\nmy guilt complex comes in. While others were having this great sorrow and this great\npain in Europe and they were going to ghettos and concentration camps, we were having\nthis little idyll lasting some, over a year or so of pure happiness. Of course my father had\nmoney worries, but the important thing is we were together and we were safe and Cuba\nat that time long before Castro, was a wonderful place to be.",

And he went to South Africa,\nestablished himself as a businessman and he became quite well off. He\u2019s dead now. And\nhe got his parents out. They lived there peacefully.",
        "A: I wish I could tell you for certain. Probably, probably. They didn\u2019t\u2014I was not close\nto them. They were good people but they didn\u2019t have a knack with children and it was the\nsame with my mother. They were her parents, but they were not really close. She\nappreciated them but there was no closeness. And so I\u2019m not quite certain. They must\nhave left before we did. Yes, they must have because there wasn\u2019t much later after 1939\nyou know.",
        "A: There was the Christian side of the family who we ourselves didn\u2019t know too well.\nMy father was the contact there. They were doing all right. I mean I don\u2019t know what\nthey suffered under the Nazis but they were not in any imminent danger. My mother, my\nfather\u2019s mother\u2019s maiden name was Vogt, V-O-G-T or maybe it was V-O-I-G-H-T. ?\u2019'm\nnot sure. It was pronounced Vogt, which in German means abbot. And so they were the\nChristian side and Aunt Mathilda the great aunt, she had married an Abel so she was\nChristian so but her, the man she married came from Jewish family. So anyway it was\none aunt much later in fact just about two years ago I learned that my very glamorous\nolder great aunt, she was my grandmother\u2019s sister, her name was Ida, Eda and she\nmarried wealthy im, she was married and she had married a Jewish gentleman. And I\nlearned recently that she had ended up in Thereiseinstadt. I had not known this before. I\nwas very, very sad. She was \u2014 I wasn\u2019t close to her either but I knew she was an elegant\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nlady, very unhappily married. And I remember a stained glass window in her dining room\nwhen we visited. They had one of those phenomenal Berlin apartments you know. But\nbeing an only child, we did have some relatives in Dresden who were non-Jewish. The\nboys went into the army. I think they both died. They were an odd family. Do you want\nto hear another childhood memory.",
        "A: When I was in Dresden. Two, two come to mind. Neither one of them pleasant.",
        "A: This was obvious, ok this was when my father was between jobs. He was struggling.\nAnd he wanted to put his wife and child someplace. There was \u2014 so he decided to leave\nus with his relatives in Dresden. So we went there. The lady was an eccentric. She had\nabout 13 cats or more and this big old rambling country house in Dresden. She had two\nsons. I remember one of them was called Reiner and I can\u2019t remember the other one.\nThey were much bigger boys. I was just a little kid. And they played two tricks on me.\nThey gave me something that looked just like honey and they said this is good, Ruth.\nWhy don\u2019t you eat it. I was such an ignoramus. | ate it and it was laundry soap. To this\nday I can remember the taste. It was so awful. The other thing they did which did notendear them to me, they would take, put me in a potato sack and move me around the\ngarden. Just drag me you know. That wasn\u2019t too good. I was scared to death of them. Not\nhaving any siblings, particularly brothers you know. And the other thing is I developed a\ntypical childhood cold and some German families had some peculiar ideas of how to raise\nchildren. This woman\u2019s idea of curing me was to tie me hand and foot in bed and put a lot\nof blankets on me to sweat it out of my system. Well my mother was horrified. She felt\nlike she was very vulnerable. She was there because she didn\u2019t have a penny to her name.\nHer husband was struggling in Berlin to find a job and a place to live. All she had were\nthese people. She didn\u2019t want to offend the lady but she didn\u2019t\u2019 want to desert me either.\nSo while I was lying there sweating and pleading for her to release me and she was sitting\nthere crying. But she didn\u2019t\u2019 have the nerve to untie me. This was a very unpleasant\nmemory. And remember this was not done by a Nazi. This was done by what was\nconsidered a good German parentsega, not my mother but this lady who was related to\nmy father by marriage. It was her husband who was a cousin of his. And so my\nmemories of Dresden and it was also ghastly winter weather and depressing and I was\ncold most of the -- it was just simply a horrible memory",
        "A: But let me throw in how Germans think children should be raised. I told you how\nclose my father was to his father. And his father was a darling man who had been\nwidowed much too young. He was well off. They had a lovely house. And he had my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfather woken every morning by a housekeeper coming in and putting ice cold sheets\naround him to wake him up and toughen him up. Can you imagine a little boy, half\norphaned, waking up in the morning and being wrapped up in these icy sheets. Well this\nwas the German way of bringing children up. I\u2019m so glad that my own parents didn\u2019t\u2019\nhave those ideas. I just wanted to throw that in.",
        "A: Oh it was unbelievable",
        "A: Yes. I did and this is a very interesting thing. I went to a place called Miss Philip\u2019s\nschool and it was a private school. My father had done some fund raising for the\nAmerican Joint Committee and helped many Jewish refugees. And they were giving him\nan allowance. That\u2019s who we managed to live. And I don\u2019t know what the financial\narrangements were for me to attend school, but I went to this lovely American Miss\nPhilip\u2019s school in Havana. It was a lovely tropical building in a nice part of town. And I\nwas learning both Spanish and English and I \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: There was a Miss Sema. I think it was English and Spanish. Yes, it was, I had an\nAmerican teacher, Miss Martha Jane Pruitt. No, Martha, Martha Jane Jones. She married\na Mr. Pruitt later. She was a darling young girl. And it was, I remember there was an\nolder teacher with white hair. Mrs. Morris Sema. And she must have been Spanish\nspeaking. But I managed with all these limitations in language to be the second best in\nmy class and I got a silver medal. I still have it. And a gold medal was earned by another\nrefugee boy I remember. A nice plump Jewish boy with a marvelous sense of humor.\nAnd he got the first one which was gold. So these refugee children were really\noutdistancing the local kids.",
        "A: No. But there were many refugees in Havana. Yes.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s probably why I am now working in the historical division doing\ntranslations, because my fundamental German is very deep seated that I have not really\nforgotten it because even in this country, until my parents\u2019 deaths.

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I thought the Cuban people were so different from anything I had seen before. I\nremember pale faced northern Germans or worried Jewish Germans and great deal \u2014 I\nwas always cold in Germany, it seems to me and everything seemed to be gray. Berlin\nseemed to be gray. And all of a sudden I was on this golden island and with royal palm\ntrees. I thought I\u2019d never seen anything so beautiful. The sunsets, this tropical skies were\nsomething I\u2019d never experienced before. The music, the people. They were very warm\nand charming. And at that time, happy.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

        "A: Oh that was because our quota number came up. We had done our wait. I was\nheartbroken. I remember the day we sailed away. My parents had locked me into a cabin\nbecause I had been asleep when they left and they didn\u2019t want me to be 1n any danger.\nAnd I remember waking up as the ship was sailing away and I was looking at the\nMonicone. It\u2019s that great stretch of road that\u2019s the first thing you see when you come to\nHavana harbor. And the lights twinkling like pearl necklace and I wanted to go on deck.\nAnd I couldn\u2019t. The door was locked. And I remember standing at that porthole and\nsobbing because I didn\u2019t want to leave Cuba. The people I knew. My little girlfriends. I\nwas distraught.",
        "A: Oh in fact just a few months ago, I visited one of them who is now a lady my age in\nher late 60s. Living in Florida. That was my dear friend Hilda whom I had met then. She\nwas then a very beautiful little girl with her own problems. Her parents had divorced. But\nshe was a well upper crust Cuban. I mean a very well, they were wealthy.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

        "A: Oh because there was no future for us in Cuba. It was a marvelous resting, stopping\noff place, better than we ever hoped for or expected. But it was not a place to remain.\nThere was no way you could make a living or anything. We were set to become\nAmericans.",
        "A: Well he had had connections with this Joint Committee and we quickly found work\nbut it was a terrible struggle. I once wrote an essay about my father. And I gave it to my\nchildren in which I explained how it was for him. Here he was at this point in his 50s,and he looked for any kind of job. Salesman. He worked at the Savoy Plaza Hotel in the\nbasement as sort of janitorial working. There he was once a well set up gentleman with\nhis little fortune. And here he was now practically a janitor and guys half his age who\nreferred to him as hey Al, you know. And it was a great come down or I don\u2019t know but\nhe was very gallant about the whole thing. He got used to it. He struggled with it. He put\nup with it. He fought and he finally ended up creating his own position with a German\nlanguage newspaper, the Stats Sanctunk und Herald (German), a Knight Ridder paper\nand he found a job in their advertising department. And with his contacts back in\nGermany and his knowledge of German, he became the advertising director for the ads\nfrom Germany, big industry ads. And I wanted to explain how it was possible for him to\ngo back to Germany on business trips after all that had happened. And this was of course\nafter the war when Germany was being built up again. He knew the high commissioner\nand he had contacts from business before. And he managed to get some fabulous ads for\nthe paper and he did this twice a year for seven years until he died of lung cancer. And\nthe way that he could do this, as I explained before is that he had had 40, almost up to \u2014\nno more than 40, mid 40s. He had had a good life in Germany. This was a nightmare that\ncame upon him in middle age and he had had to adjust to it. He had to understand it\nwasn\u2019t going to go away. That he had to get away from there. He had not been in the\ncamps. He had not had the experience. And so he was able to come back and deal with\nthe post war Germans. He was not eaten up by hatred or revulsion like so many\nrightfully were. You know. And so he could do this.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Oh yes. He had a good friend in New York. His name was Eric Goodall. For a while\nhe was a political cartoonist and he, the very first night, he took us around in his car. I\nremember drove us to Little Italy where all the lights were lit and oh first the skyscrapers\ndown Fifth Avenue. And I was a little child. It was an open convertible and I laid back\nand just looked up at the skyscrapers and the bright lights in Little Italy and all over. And\nI remember falling asleep, leaning back with my mouth open. That\u2019s my first night in\nNew York. My father, as we were going down Broadway on that first day, stopped at\n77\" street and Broadway. At the corner there was a hotel called the Benjamin Franklin. I\nlooked recently and the building is still there, but it\u2019s no longer the Benjamin Franklin.\nIt\u2019s been rebuilt as something else. It was a residential hotel and he rented us a nice large\nroom with kitchen privileges for that first night. And we lived there for some months.\nAnd so our arrival in New York was very pleasant. I had my parents with me and my\nfather had his good friend there. And getting acquainted with New York.

Rutt. It just wasn\u2019t \u2014 that\u2019s how it was pronounced in Germany, Rutt. I\ndidn\u2019t\u2019 like it. It wasn\u2019t enough for me. I didn\u2019t feel like just Ruth. You know or Ruth and\nso she and I took a walk on Riverside Drive because I told her I wanted to get a middle\nname. And I realized that every American I knew had a middle name. I only had one and\nit was only one syllable so I said Jill will you help me find a name. So we walked and\nwe started with the A\u2019s naturally. We didn\u2019t get very far because when she said Andrea,\nI said say that again. And she said Andrea. And I said I like it.",

Now\nthat I work at the Holocaust Museum, I feel Randy isn\u2019t right, so I go as Ruth.",

But he did marry an artist as his first wife. She was prima ballerina\nof the Berlin Opera. Her name was Elizabeth Grube. She was non-Jewish and she was a\nvery good dancer. They were married about four years and then she ran off with a stage\ndesigner, a Greek stage designer.

Every night after work I would lie on the floor,\non the carpet, on my stomach and fill out some more of this huge, positively endless form\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nin quintuplicate. You had to go back to your very first beginnings of life. Everybody you\never knew you had to go get references and schools. It took a week to fill 1t out\nconscientiously.

Well my father was so pleased because he had always had a high regard for\ndiplomats. The diplomat\u2019s life. And here was this little Ruthie entering, true at the very\nbottom. But still it was the State Department. He couldn\u2019t have been more pleased. So I\ngave up my job at Paramount and traveled to Washington.",
        "A: Well at first in their home and then I managed to get a room in the same building\nabove them. But I left all that quite happily and settled in Mount Pleasant and worked for\nthe State Department for about four years.",
        "A: [had had a boyfriend who had lived in Washington on and off. He was a flight\nengineer. And I visited him once and the first thing I saw from Union Station was the\nCapitol and trees everywhere I looked. I feel hook line and sinker. I fell in love with\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nWashington and I wanted to live here. So when the State Department job came, I thought\nthis is wonderful. This is a wonderful way to get where I want to go.",
        "A: Yes. My father treated me to my first night\u2019s hotel room and then at the State\nDepartment I went to the registry for housing and they found me a pleasant place on\nMount Pleasant. Yes, it was nice. A group home with lots of other young women.",
        "A: Very romantic. In those days the Park Sheraton hotel had a magnificent Olympic\nsized pool. Now it\u2019s been paved over as a parking lot. Can you imagine. IN those days it\nwas a very refreshing beautiful blue green. Water. And one Labor Day, it was Labor Day\n1957. It was very hot, my girlfriend and I decided to go to that pool for a nice swim. And\nso we went and that\u2019s how I met my husband. Sitting next to me.",
        "A: Well this is so strange. He was also , he said he was also in the foreign service. And\nwhat he couldn\u2019t\u2019 tell me in those days, but I can tell now because he\u2019s been dead since\n1972, he was with the CIA. I mean he didn\u2019t\u2019 tell me that of course. He just, we\nexchanged telephone numbers and he said if you call me and I\u2019m not there, just leave a\nmessage cause that\u2019s the way it is. I didn\u2019t know that so he called me and missed me so I\ncalled him and he wasn\u2019t there and I wasn\u2019t going to leave a message so I just hung up.\nThis way we never would have gotten together. But finally he got me at home because I\nhad only given him my office number. My boss took pity on him and he said [Il give you\nher home phone number, god bless him. And then we saw each other every day for about\nnine months and then he was assigned to Athens, Greece. And that\u2019s when he asked me\nto share his life there with him, And we got married and we went to Athens. And live\nhappily there for five years.

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh no. He was, he came from Milwaukee of Polish and Welsh stock. The Welsh or\nEnglish part would have been Protestant, but I, Unitarian. And the other part was Polish\nCatholic. His mother was Catholic. She came from Polish peasants, maybe third\ngeneration and his father was first generation. They came over from England and went\ninto real estate in Milwaukee.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well like his, like his, well he was not Catholic like his mother. He was like his father.\nCould you stop it for a minute. I\u2019m trying to.",
        "A: Yes, I had said Unitarian but I misspoke. He was Congregationalist. In fact our three\nchildren were baptized at Plymouth Church in Milwaukee on different home leaves when\nwe came back to visit his folks. And he had them christened right there.",
        "A: This is the story of my life. I\u2019ve never figured out exactly what I am. I certainly feel\nmore Jewish than anything else. And yet, I am not really a practicing Jew. I don\u2019t follow\nthe high holidays or the customs because I was raised so differently. And so that is sort of\na, a conflict within me as to what exactly where do I belong.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

I have tried to get\nthem to go to Sunday school or have given them bibles, and they\u2019re just. They\u2019re\nwonderful. They\u2019ve got good characters but they\u2019re non-religious totally. I couldn\u2019t get\nanywhere with them.",
        "A: Because we were in the foreign service overseas. There was a lot of people going to\nchurch. It was a social thing for the people to get together. Their children went to Sunday\nschool. And I thought it would be kind of good for them to learn the stories of the bible.\nYou know. But I couldn\u2019t get them. They didn\u2019t want to.",

        "A: Well two were born there, yes. The third was born in Fairfax hospital later.",
        "A: This is interesting that you should ask this because the Greeks, delving back into\nhistory have always been known to honor the stranger, to give hospitality to the stranger,\nto the visitor. Xenos, the stranger. They couldn\u2019t have been more hospitable or\nwelcoming. It\u2019s in their blood. And I compared that to the German character of\nmistrusting instinctively the foreign element. The Aryan. Right away. And I thought to\nmyself what a shame that people have to be so different.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Well those were the days when there was a very idealistic bunch of people there like\nmy husband and his friends, very good sort of people. And to patriots, and risking their\nlives and we have a very high opinion of the people we worked with. In fact, I didn\u2019t\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nrealize. You know in those days I didn\u2019t\u2019 think about liberal or conservative, Democrat or\nRepublican. In those days in the 50s there were so many moderates on both sides and\nthey sort of melded. It wasn\u2019t really until the 80s and 90s that you see this really ugly\ntooth and nail attitude between the Democrats and the Republicans, the ultra\nconservatives and liberal has become a dirty word. This is something that didn\u2019t exist\nthen.",

        "A: Oh definitely, of course. Yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I would not wed these two ideas together. It was something entirely different. A\ntotally different trip. Had nothing to do with religion. Or, or past or anything. It was\nsomething new, a new world I was going into.",
        "A: The best thing I ever did or went through and gave meaning to my life. I mean this is\nwhat I had been born for and raising the\u2014and then later when my husband died, fairly\nearly. We had only been married 14 years, and left, leaving me with three children and\ntheir ages were at the time, 11, ten and eight. And fortunately the government provided\npensions and we didn\u2019t\u2019 suffer hardship, but still I was the one to raise these three and\nmay, this is interesting. Maybe my past experiences in dealing with hardships gave me\nthe strength to endure this terrible shock of losing him so young and being in charge of\nthree young lives. And I must say they had such good character. It was so easy to raise\nthem. I thoroughly enjoyed being a parent and I must say they didn\u2019t give me much grief\nat all. They were good kids. I raised them instinctually. All of us do and there\u2019s no\nhandbook for being a parent. And it came out well.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

She just got her masters last year, a year ago.\nAnd Michael is an honors, the oldest boy is an honors professor in Milwaukee at\nUniversity of Wisconsin.",
        "A: He\u2019s teaching an honors course which will be up next year and then he has to struggle\nto get another job. It\u2019s not easy.",

Arts, politics and those things are only for three years so when that\u2019s over and\nwith the present problem with teaching and professors not having tenure, he\u2019ll be lucky if\nhe gets another teaching position, although he\u2019s very, the students love him. And my\nyoungest is working here in Washington. He\u2019s got a nice job, just got married recently\nand nice young couple, very happy with life. Sol can gratefully say that I would say the\nmost creative thing and the most constructive thing in my life would be raising these\nthree children. Having gotten them in the first place born healthy and I\u2019m very, very\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ngrateful about that. And that\u2019s what helped me through my widowhood, having them to\ntake care of.",
        "A: Yes. I remember that I had worked at, had a little part time job at an insurance\ncompany when Johnny was still working for the agency here and then he left and a month\nafter he left, I got the death notice and struggled for a little bit longer at that job. And\nthen they replaced me with somebody who had been there before and like a homing\npigeon I fled to the agency that he worked for and told them my story and they gave me a\npart time job which I kept for eight years while raising the children. I couldn\u2019t take a full\ntime job. I had a part time job. I was home when they came home from school. And then\nI switched to full time for a few more years when they were bigger and then I took early\nretirement. Now I\u2019m retired and it\u2019s amazing how full one\u2019s days can be, although\nretired.",

        "A: That is a feeling I had in New York when I was a teenager, about 13 or so and those\ndays all the poor frightened sick people who had survived Nazi Germany had all come to\nManhattan and all settled on the west side. And it was, I remember how terribly\ndepressive it was as a young teenager to see these poor old pale gray shadows of\nthemselves walking around Broadway, each one a tragic story. There were so many of\nthem. I remember the feeling I had at the time, how tragic this was and how I wanted to\nget away from it.",
        "A: Well by the time\u2014yes, you know by the time that I was ready to leave, those people\nwere still there. Oddly enough, many, many decades later I went back. They were all\ngone and their offsprings doing well and the places had been, bad neighborhoods had\nbeen made wonderful. And New York was totally different, a completely different stage\nset. All those poor, poor shadows had vanished. And you saw nice young people jogging\nalong, healthy and it was just, just like it was when I went to Germany. I said this is a\nbrand new country. New York was a brand new country decades after I left it. But at the\ntime when we were all refugees there together, I found it very, very sad.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: No, in fact you know in New York this had this unhappy reputation for not being\nterribly polite or. Well I thought anyone in Washington seemed so healthy and so\npleasant and I really enjoy the people here. I like it better. I must admit I had gotten fed\nup with New York. And consider this place a place to get my health back and I did.",
        "A: With my, oh after I became widowed in 72, my mother and I managed to plan to go\nback to Germany. I think it was 76 or 78. I don\u2019t remember which. And the sad thing\nabout my husband is he died in Viet Nam and when he left here, we had decided that\nwhen he had finished his tour which was supposed to be 18 months, we would meet in\nGermany and I would show it to him. He was going to come straight from Viet Nam. I\nwas going to come straight from Washington. We were going to meet there and I was, I\ntold him we were going to paint the town red. And I was so looking forward to that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well there are several versions which I don\u2019t know that I want to go into. One is that\nhe died in a swimming pool and the other one\u2019s a different version that somebody got to\nhim from North Korea and so not knowing the full truth it\u2019s best not to. I don\u2019t\u2019 know.\nPll never know the truth so I can\u2019t really tell you. But anyway the idea being that when\nhe had finished his tour, we were going to reunite and I was going to show him my home\ntown. So you can imagine the state of mind I was in when I went years later with my\nmother. I remember being very unhappy and very unpleasant and very crabby and I\napologized to her. I said Mutti, I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m just so sad. I pictured this so\ndifferently. And she said apologies are not necessary my dear. I fully understand. But\nthen after I had gotten there and discovered that it was, everything was so different from\nwhat I remembered and people were pleasant. And this was before the return of the\nskinheads. At this point, I thought oh my this is marvelous. The new Germans are great.\nThis is a democracy. How nice. And it was only later when I was back home a few years\nlater and I read about these outrages against the Turkish laborers and the skinheads you\nknow setting houses on fire. And just being generally nasty to the alien labor forces that\nthey had. And skinheads with swastikas and what not and I got so fed up and so disgusted\nyou know. So as you can see, I\u2019ve always had a roller coaster feeling about Germany.\nIt\u2019 ll always be with me. My daughter said maybe you should see a therapist and I don\u2019t\nknow. I just don\u2019t know. Should I or shouldn\u2019t I, I don\u2019t, she thinks I should.",
        "A: Yeah, something besides I\u2019m garrulous and I like people. They thought it\u2019d be terrific.\nAnd I said nothing tugged at me. And then I read an article in the Washington Post about\nthe new holocaust museum. And the idea that I adored, in those days they still had those\npass machines when you would take a one of those ID book, cards or pamphlets from the\nmachine and you would read you know people who had been through the Holocaust and\nyou\u2019d read their story. And in those days you would have to go to a different floor and\nget the second page and you couldn\u2019t just read the whole thing. As you went from floor to\nfloor the fate of this person unfolded. They got rid of those machines because they were\nused to death, they died. They got rid of them. They were always breaking down. Now\nyou get the whole little passbook and unless you control yourself and wait you can read\nthe whole thing while waiting for the elevator. The idea being that you didn\u2019t know then\nwould this person make it or would they perish. And that was rather dramatic. I thought\nthe idea was phenomenal you know. And then I read that they were looking for\nvolunteers and all of a sudden it was like bong. All of a sudden, I was interested. My\nheart was in this. This is something that I felt I could do so well with my background.And so I wrote a letter and they replied. And I came for an interview and I was accepted.\nI was thrilled. I loved the museum. I love what they\u2019re doing and I enjoyed being a\nvolunteer and were it not for my bad ankle and knee, I would be here much more often\nthan I am. But fortunately they have an opening for me here in the oral history\ndepartment and I\u2019m very happy translating and shaking through these documents.",
        "A: It\u2019s a learning museum. It teaches people, often, young people who otherwise might\nbe totally unaware of the Holocaust that there was such a thing and that those flakes who\nkeep proclaiming that it never happened are flakes. And that this really did happen.\nThere\u2019s enough evidence in this museum to show that. I love that. That somebody took\nthe trouble to build it and, and I love the architect who went to the camps and got the\nideas for the architecture directly from the camps. James Engle Freed. And I love what\nhe did. It\u2019s a magnificent building. And going, the strange is when I applied, I said\nplease don\u2019t put me near scenes of horror. I don\u2019t\u2019 want to see it. And put me anywhere.\nWell sure enough, they did just the opposite. And I found myself walking through the\npermanent exhibit. But I learned to live with it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: To walk, to be a walker through the different floors of the permanent exhibit. Make\nsure everything was going along well. You know as you come out of the elevator you see\na horrible thing on the fourth floor, against the wall and all the corpses of, I mean this is\nwhat I had tried to avoid. And somehow they got me into that.",
        "A: No once I was there, I decided that having seen it once, I could live with it and do the\njob that they wanted me to do. And of course there\u2019s many others. You don\u2019t, you\u2019re not\nconstantly walking through the permanent exhibits. Many other areas. So I do it. And\nunfortunately because of my bad foot now, I don\u2019t go as often. I intend to go perhaps\nonce a month on a weekend when they need people. Keep my foot in so to speak, but\nconcentrate more on oral histories and transcriptions.",
        "A: Oh my heart just jumped. I said to myself god if anybody can show the public, it\u2019s me\nand I think every one of those volunteers must have had that same zing when they read\nabout this, don\u2019t you think?",
        "A: Thad a feeling that my life, remember now that I was a middle aged retired woman\nwithout a husband in her life, children grown up, life a little empty. And all of a sudden\nhere is something that totally engaged me, my mind and my heart and I said this is what I\nwas put here for. I was taking, I was in the skilled complex because I didn\u2019t\u2019 suffer as\nmuch as the others. I said this is maybe how I can atone for that. I can tell people what\nthese people went through and where they ended up and, and I can be more dramatic\nperhaps than somebody who wasn\u2019t as close to the subject, you know. And I, I had a\nfeeling that this museum gave more meaning to my life.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. First of all when I was an only child and shy I didn\u2019t\u2019 know that I really\nloved people. But as I got more mature and more worldly I discovered that I really liked\npeople very much and it\u2019s wonderful working with the public. You meet so many\ndifferent people, different outlooks on life. I\u2019m able to use my two foreign languages on\nthem. When I speak Spanish to some people, bewildered family from Argentina, their\nfaces just light up and I can convey to them the things they want to know about the\nmuseum and when Germans come to visit, and this is a strange thing. I\u2019ve seen young\nGerman people come in and they have the strangest expressions on their faces. Maybe I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nread more into it because of my background, but maybe not. There is a mixture, sort of\nfear and shame and more. It\u2019s a combination of impressions, when I look at the young\nfaces. They know what their country has done and I\u2019m sure they feel terrible about it.\nAnd they feel embarrassed and guilty but eager to see this and afraid to see it. It\u2019s a\nfascinating expression. I\u2019ve seen it at various times. And I try to put them at ease. I mean\nthey didn\u2019t cause this.",
        "A: I speak their language to them. And look at them kindly. I am gentle with them. But I\nsay how happy I am that they are here. Then I emphasize but you of all people you have\nto know this and that\u2019s all I say. And they nod. And I have a feeling I\u2019m getting my point\nacross.",
        "A: Oh, this is interesting because one of those minute suggestion was, the minutes from\nthe meeting of the survivors, that the survivors ought to have special badges saying\nsurvivor. Some people want that. Others, myself included, do not think it\u2019s such a great\nidea. But whenever I think it\u2019s appropriate to a particular group of people in a given\nsituation, I\u2019ll mention. There is one place, my favorite in the whole museum and it\u2019s a\nremember the children Daniel\u2019s house. That is my favorite exhibit because that 1s partly\nmy youth growing up in Germany. Many of the things in that exhibit it\u2019s like walking\nthrough a series of stage sets. Remind me of my own childhood. Although it didn\u2019t have\nthe terrible ending that are pictured there like the ghetto and the camps. I left before them.\nBut every often when I have a nice family who brought their children, Ill put the\nemphasis on look at the children and they\u2019!1 say that\u2019s just like my childhood was I grew\nup under those circumstances and then I say but I didn\u2019t\u2019 have the sad ending. But I says\nbasically remember my own childhood there and this, the children look at me with big\neyes. It\u2019s very useful to be able to do that convincingly because it\u2019s the truth you know.\nAnd I do that when I like a given group and I want to add to their knowledge. I don\u2019t feel\nthat I want to go around with a badge that says survivor though you know. I don\u2019t want\nto do that. Was anything else on this subject that you wanted to know. Oh my interaction\nwith people. The sweetest little peasant woman from some East European country\ntalking Yiddish came. She had misplaced some object, had lost something that her\ngrandmother had given her and it had been found in the lost and found and I got it for her\nand handed it to her. And she didn\u2019t speak the language. She grabbed my hand and kissed\nit and I thought that was the sweetest most touching thing. And I was smiling the rest of\nthe day. I\u2019m embarrassed but also touched. And you meet so many different people.\nSometimes you see a lady middle aged, totally overcome. It was like we would come out\nof the hall of remembrance and she was just standing there and her shoulders were\nshaking. She was leaning against the column, her face to the column and I just gently. I\nknow we\u2019re not supposed to touch the public but sometimes a human touch 1s sort of\ninstinctive and I just gently patted her shoulder and stood by her and she calmed down.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nYou had the feeling that you are an ambassador between the museum and the public and,\nand you try to be a good influence and help and represent the museum and all of that.\nMany other stories.",
        "A: I met the nicest bunch. First I went on Wednesday afternoons and then Larry asked if\nthere were anybody here who would be willing to work on weekends because that\u2019s when\nthey really need help.

As I said everything was fine until I got my trouble with the knee\nand the ankle. So I hope it will improve so I can do more. But I found it very\nchallenging and very nice. There\u2019s always the odd pill in every crowd. There was one\nthat was particularly odd but she\u2019s no longer there I\u2019m happy to say. And on the whole, I\nfound them very pleasant. Not everybody was pleasant but most of them are. And\nsome of them have stories to tell. Again which makes me feel guilty because I didn\u2019t go\nthrough what they went through.

She said you have the same feelings.

I was feeling too comfortable here, a little isolated with\nnot terribly much to do and I think that the, for the rest of my life, until I am no longer\nable to, I want to be involved with this museum. I just love it.",
        "A: At the very beginning when they were first open, I was there before they opened they\nmuseum to the public the day before. There\u2019s another little story. I went with my very\nnice mature daughter Jenny. And we went through the museum and she went you know\nwhere those boxes are where adults look down at a series of clips below, pictures and\nfilm clips about the really horrendous things that they don\u2019t want kids to see. And that\u2019s\nthe experiments and beatings and that sort of thing. It\u2019s kind of sad how many people are\nalways eager to look down at that. Jenny came up to me and she said mom she said,\ndon\u2019t ever look at those. And I knew exactly what she meant because I\u2019m the type if I see\nan animal being treated cruelly, I can\u2019t get over it. And you see some of these things it\nsears your soul. You can\u2019t forget it. She did me a big favor. And I\u2019ve been working there\nsince the beginning and I have never gone and looked at those things. Never. And she\nwarned me. I\u2019m very grateful to her. Had I looked at that, I probably couldn\u2019t continue\nworking at the museum. You would have to shield yourself against the utter horror.\nThere\u2019s limits to what you can take. In fact I\u2019m going to travel to eastern Europe in the\nlate fall and on the way there will be a chance to go to the camps and I\u2019m not going to go.\nI don\u2019t\u2019 think I could face it. It\u2019s enough that I go through the permanent exhibit. It\u2019s not\nbecause I don\u2019t\u2019 care, but maybe because I care too much that I don\u2019t want to go.",
        "A: The purple folder is full of a document which was on tape, a videotape in German.\nFirst I took it down wordy by word in German. 39 pages of it and now I\u2019m translating it.\nFrom the German to English. Unfortunately I\u2019m not ready yet for word processors and\nthings like that. I understand the museum might give courses on that. I\u2019d like that. I\u2019m\ndoing it by hand. It would be lovely if I could just sort of tick it off like this.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Oh yes, that\u2019s why it\u2019s taking me a little longer.",
        "A: When it\u2019s done, Pll go down. In the meantime I have a sufficient amount I\u2019!] mail it\nto Ms. Rubin. Amy Rubin, I work for her. She\u2019s a lovely girl and I want to have her\nknow that in working on this, it\u2019s taking quite a while.",
        "A: I could do it all there in the library. But I\u2019ve chosen to do it at home. It makes no\ndifference to me.",
        "A: I do the, I take the information from the video at the library of course with their\nmachines. And then when I have the document I go home and I translate it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Fascinating. For instance, I\u2019Il tell you there is this wonderful video on. It\u2019s called\n\u201cWeapons of the Spirit\u201d and it\u2019s about the wonderful French Huguenots mountain village\nof Le Chambon and they\u2019re legendary for their aid that they gave to Jewish refugees.\nThey\u2019re famous for it. In fact if you\u2019d like me to lend you this, it\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s called\n\u201cWeapons of the Spirit\u201d. Ad it\u2019s this very stirring which I\u2019ve always been so moved by\nthat this particular translation is of a man who was a French Swiss who worked at Le\nChambon during the war, helping numerous children, carrying for them, nourishing\nthem, helping them escape. And how they village of Le Chambon worked with him.\nAnd it was a very famous priest. Father Trocm\u00e9, legendary and he\u2019s mentioned in this\nmanuscript. So I have been so thrilled to be working with this material because even\nbefore I knew of the museum, I was touched by the story of Le Chambon and how they\nhelped the Jews there. They were all Huguenots, not Catholics. It\u2019s very thrilling\nmaterial. First I did the story of his wife, and now I\u2019m doing his story and it\u2019s absolutely\nthrilling work. And it shows you the heroism that people are capable of. This is a\nparticularly, this is not the story only of suffering and victimization but it\u2019s what one man\nwith good will can do to prevent horrors from happening and to get, he always\nemphasizes in this report that he didn\u2019t do it by himself. He had the help of the village\npeople and other priests and many others. But he had this gift of networking which is a\ngift. And he used it to full advantage to save many lives. And you can imagine how\nhonored I am to be working with this story.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Maybe that\u2019s the wrong phrase. I just have the feeling that it engages my heart, my\nemotions. I\u2019m fully committed to bring out the best that this museum has to offer and\nshare it with the public. I have had no dealings with creating it or furnishing or anything\nbut what I am able to do as 1s be in between the museum and the public and convey to\nthem some of what the museum is about. And I feel that I am uniquely qualified to do\nthat. And that is satisfying.",
        "A: It teaches the world about the Holocaust. That is its purpose. And it\u2019s, sometimes I\nlook through the book that visitors leave data on, their thoughts about it and it\u2019s\nmarvelous, wonderful what they have to say about it. You get the occasional oddball that\nsays something horrible, but fortunately they are few and far between. The majority of\npeople are absolutely enthralled by it.",
        "A: Definitely. ? ve had numerous, we have one little gimmick that\u2019s very satisfying. Each\none of us receives every month, ten tickets. Now you know the tickets are free but you\nhave to wait in line for a long time. And it\u2019s very convenient to be handed a ticket. Now\nI don\u2019t always have ten family members or intimate friends that I give these tickets to.\nSo I keep them in my purse and when I\u2019m at the museum. And when that hour finally\narrives when there\u2019s no more tickets, and I see some desperate young visitor from a far\noff country, I\u2019m so glad I could slip her ticket or him and oh, right after the Oklahoma\nbombing, I had the Attorney General of Oklahoma. He was in the news just the other\nday. I forget his name right now. It\u2019s Boswerson or something. Very nice man. And he\nlooked at me. I had no idea who he was. And he said oh what a shame. He said I can\u2019t\nget any ticket and I\u2019m only here for a day. And I said where are you from. He saidOklahoma. He said I\u2019m the attorney general. No, he didn\u2019t\u2019 say that then. He just said he\nwas from Oklahoma and I liked the way he looked. He seemed like a nice human being\nso I reached into my pocket and I said here let me give you this little pass. I hate for you\nto be here for nothing. And he thanked me so much and dashed off. Hours later he found\nme where I was collecting tickets or something and said I want to thank you so much for\nmaking it possible for me to see. He said I\u2019m the Attorney General of Oklahoma and I\nsaid oh my god, I said your poor state. I\u2019m so sorry for what you had to go through. And\nit was just like instant friendship. We never see each other again. But I don\u2019t\u2019 think\nwe'll ever forget each other. And it\u2019s that sort of human story that is so enriching you\nknow. And many other instances that I can\u2019t remember of a direct contact with another\nlife, brief but you don\u2019t\u2019 forget it. I just said I can\u2019t remember. But you know what I\nmean. Different various instances remain in my mind.",
        "A: Well I ok, let me say that I appreciate that the museum gives us folks a chance to\nvoice our experiences from where we came from and where we are and how it felt and\nhow it was. This is a wonderful thing that you\u2019re letting us do and it\u2019s always nice to\nhave a voice and to be counted and to be heard from and I appreciate that and I want to\nrepeat that I really love the museum and I\u2019m terribly glad they came to the city. And I\nthink that\u2019s all. Don\u2019t you.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
