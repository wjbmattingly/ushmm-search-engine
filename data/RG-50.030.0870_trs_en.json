There was a, so the first year\nwhen we had to leave the house we had no, we didn\u2019t get any coal to heat the house. So that they\nhad the barns. The boys broke it down. And we used the wood and the next year in spring we\nturned the ground and we took the eyes from the potatoes, you cut out the eyes from the potato.\nAnd you put it in the ground upside down. And we turned the ground and there was a pump\ndownstairs so we got to work. And when I came home from work I was taking care of the\ngarden, I was the gardener. So we had potatoes, a little tomatoes, we planted things. Of course\nthere was no gates so people stole they were hungry. But the potatoes underground was a big\nhelp. To get what to eat.",

Every morning that when you came to\nwork in the factory, had to go to the office to report. That you are here and you had a cell\nnumber, the floor number where you worked and everywhere they had a number a registry\nnumber. I happened to have a good memory so I worked in the evidence. After a year or so they\ntook me to work in the office. So I was in the registry office. So it was a little easier because I\nremembered so went first. When people came to work in the morning they had to register.",

        "Q: We were talking about office work and work in the factory itself. I wanted to ask a larger\nquestion. Were you always hungry or were you not so hungry in the ghetto.",
        "A: You see it was hard there for boys because I didn\u2019t grow too much. Anymore because there\nwasn\u2019t the food what teenagers eat. But I wasn\u2019t so hungry because they used to give kohlrabi. I\ndidn\u2019t like it. But you, I was occupied in the garden. I had this, but the boys were hungry. I\ncould have used another piece of bread but you couldn\u2019t complain because what would they do\nto, it was much harder for the grown boys.",

        "Q: But they didn\u2019t patrol the ghetto.",
        "A: They patrolled it then the borders. The Germans came every so often. They came to grab the\npeople wherever they could. They took them to concentration camps before us. We were the last\ntransport and they take, took children. They took men. I had an aunt that lived from my mother\u2019s\nside. When they had the rations they came and they went into every house to seize the people.\nAnd they took out whoever they wanted. Old people, young people. So my father we had the, it\nwas a small house and under the steps was a place where you could go in so my father opened\nthe floor. He cut the floor open and he made a hiding place. They shouldn\u2019t come there because\nthey took children and everybody to take for killing. So when they were the rations we lived on,\nit was like you see here, (gesturing with hands in circular motion) the streets went like this so\nlike you lived on this side of the street, on the other side. There was a small place that you could\ngo through to the other street without going around. So this place when they, the ration, when\nthere were Auslang there were --",
        "Q: Where they were taking people away",
        "A: People away. My brother bought a band as a policeman and he came to warn us we should\nhide in the hiding place.",
        "Q: Your brother was working as a ghetto police person.",
        "A: No he just --",
        "Q: He just got the band",
        "A: He just got the band. He wasn\u2019t a policemen. He just got the band. For the, from the police\nstation. He pay something like a loaf. So he came so we went down with the children. Also was\nan old lady. My father she could, they also were afraid they\u2019d take the old people for killing too.\nSo we he dug it, a hole and from the center he made two like benches to sit. He put a piece of\nboard so that people could hide there. and we knew that if we heard the steps so we locked the\nchildren\u2019s mouth. He shouldn\u2019t hear noises. And when they went away someone brought the key\nand that we could go out so that we could go into the houses.",
        "Q: Did this happen a lot? In your home?",
        "A: It, it happened. It happened. The last time it happened my mother was so scared because there\nwere shots outside and she imagined that they killed my brother so we gave up and we went\naway with, but it was already the end. Two weeks later the whole ghetto was evacuated.",
        "Q: Isee. So that\u2019s at the end of the time. But throughout the ghetto time, you had so many small\nchildren in your family. It was a risk.",
        "A: Yeah who had to hide. It was a risk because they took away, they had no use for small\nchildren, so they killed them. They killed them. We don\u2019t know where they took them. My\naunt we heard, she had two boys. Her husband ran to Russia and she was stayed with two boys\nso she lived not far from us and we took her in whenever she was all alone. So she\u2019s also\nresiding there. And we heard that they took them to the ocean, to the boat to the ocean and they\nthrew this transport of people into the ocean alive. We didn\u2019t know what happened but then we\nheard from people after the war. That\u2019s what happened. So she had two boys. One was nine, one\nwas eleven. And the husband died in Russia. He never came back.",
        "Q: In the ghetto, did you see people starving? Did you see people dying in the ghetto? When\nyou were there.",

        "Q: What I mean is within the ghetto during the years that you lived \u2014",
        "A: Was people yes. After work there wasn\u2019t people that lived in the area you saw. You didn\u2019t\nhave time to go because we worked.",
        "Q: My question was different. My question was did you see people dying. Did you see people\nhungry?",
        "A: Oh yes, you saw people like skin and bone because they couldn\u2019t live from what they lived.\nAnd sometimes they were older people they didn\u2019t even have the money. You had to pay for it\ntoo. To buy it. So they thought and it happened that people kept the corpse to get the food. They\nkept the corpse, people, after they died to, to get. They were hungry so they got the food to they\ncould live. Yes, they were starving. Was very bad. We were hungry in the ghetto. There was a\njoke that was a song in and I have for you a good thing. A roll with butter that this would be the\nbest thing for you. You know like a little something. So the other boy answered I cannot, I\ncannot laugh because if I look at my sick old father I cannot laugh and I cannot enjoy anything.\nYou know a child\u2019s conversation was in a song they made up jokes but it was not a joke.",
        "Q: It was through tears. (both talking) Did your parents\u2019 personalities change at all through\nthese types of hardships.",
        "A: Of course they changed but you, main thing in a Jewish family is your family. That\u2019s what\nyou live for, for your family and to help people if you can. A person isn\u2019t born just for yourself.\nYou were born here, but sometimes I need you, sometimes you need me but people need people.\nI don\u2019t know if Iam expressing myself.",
        "Q: Absolutely perfectly. I\u2019m just wondering how your mother and father took it, how they were\nable to handle this cause they have nine children.",
        "A: My brothers were, my brother was already big and the ones that were over ten, you know you\ngrow up fast then in a big family. Over ten, eleven, twelve, you already people. You had\nresponsibilities. In a big family somehow everybody 1s close. We cared for each other.",
        "Q: Did that help you survive do you think?",
        "A: Yes, yes. How we survived you know. Sometimes people ask how did you survive. Honestly\nI don\u2019t know. God wanted it, it was the way. Then when they sent us to Auschwitz and when\nthey shaved our hair, I didn\u2019t see, I couldn\u2019t recognize my sister next to me. My other sister went\nwith my mother, straight off then and I saw through the bath house where they were where we\ntook the baths and when they cut us off the hair. We were standing (points at camera), there was\nbig windows downstairs and there were people standing outlined and I think I saw my father\nwith the two, took, all the boys like eight, eight, nine, ten and my mother we never saw since we\nleft the train that brought us to Auschwitz. I never saw her. But the capo that took us off was a\nJewish police. My sister went with my mother so he told her don\u2019t go there. This way they going\nto kill you. They burn and they gas you, and they burn you. So she said no it\u2019s my children. I\nwant to go with them. They took, they told us that the mothers will take care of the children,\nwhich wasn\u2019t true, wasn\u2019t true. It wasn\u2019t.

And then once the Russians came too and he picked the tallest girl. And it was already\nnight and we didn\u2019t know. And so she ran to a place where little rabbits hide. And she was very\ntall. She said she does not how she do it. He was drunk. She ran away and she, all night she\nstayed in this place in the rabbit place. And in the morning when it was light she saw he isn\u2019t\nthere anymore. She came back to the house. And then we got scared to stay there too. So we\nwent to Prague. And the authorities. I don\u2019t know what the stories, I can\u2019t even remember.\nSome girl, we stayed in the place in that factory place where we slept for a while. But then this\nRussian came and we were scared of them. There was no place where to go what to do. Then we\nwent some, but they told us we could go to trains. They gave trains to Prague.

        "A: Yeah, they sold the bakery whatever money they got, we have to pay money to smuggle us\nand they we were on trains with coal and you paid the people working and they put us between\nthe coal.",
        "Q: Why did you need to be smuggled out of Poland?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t want to stay there, was dangerous.",
        "Q: But why couldn\u2019t you just freely leave and go on a train? Why not?",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t because they wouldn\u2019t let us in.",
        "Q: Germany wouldn\u2019t let you in. Or the Poles wouldn\u2019t let you out.",
        "A: The Poles might . I don\u2019t know but they took care of it. Then they paid them and we ended\nup in West Berlin.",
        "Q: One of the reasons why I\u2019m asking 1s that I suspect it\u2019s because it was occupied by Soviet\nforces and they weren\u2019t letting people out. I suspect, but I wanted to find out whether that\u2019s the\ncase.",
        "A: Yes, probably the Russians, the Russians wouldn\u2019t let us out because was already the city\nwas divided into, into French, English, Russian and American.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about Berlin",
        "A: Berlin, yes.",
        "Q: Which section did you arrive into?",
        "A: In American.",
        "Q: You got to the American section?",
        "A: We could go to the French but once we had plans to either we go to Israel or to America.\nThere was no other places to go.",
        "Q: So it was that your brother came back to Lodz, he found you.",
        "A: One brother. Then we went back to pick up my other brother. He was in Germany and then\nwe stayed there. The German, the government, the geminder gave an apartment to my aunt.\nWas the first Jewish child born in from there, from those people and the Americans gave my\nuncle a bakery so he baked for the Americans. (both talking)",
        "Q: This was in Berlin.",
        "A: Yeah in Berlin and there was at that point between those orphans was a boy at that point from\nthe city where my uncle lived and two girls, three girls. And my aunt, two girls got married and\nbut that boy stayed in Berlin. I don\u2019t know what happened. One girl went to France. She had an\nuncle there. And the others, the other one had some family in Israel. So they went and they, we\ncouldn\u2019t go to Israel. They wouldn\u2019t let us.",
        "Q: I have a question here. You are four children who survived. Your older brother, your younger\nbrother, your younger sister and you. Did you end up living together again.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t stay with your uncle and your aunt. You just lived separately.",
        "A: After a while we lived separately but we lived in, we didn\u2019t go to the DP camps. We lived in\nthe city because of my aunt, yeah. At this point we sold the diamond. We were on our own and\nstarted doing something.",
        "Q: You sold your diamond in Berlin.",
        "A: I gave it to my brother. They took care of us. Because the girls you know it\u2019s different.",
        "Q: Did you sister still have a diamond to give to him as well.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t have. She lost it. And I lost mine, the second one. Too. But nobody worried about\nit. That was helpful.",
        "Q: It\u2019s what your father would have wanted. It\u2019s exactly why he wanted you to have them.",
        "A: And it was a good thing because he would give you anything. It\u2019s good the uncle and aunt\ntook care of us but you know they had already a baby and they took care of the other but the deaf\nboy was a little helpless. Because he couldn\u2019t speak. But then some, I don\u2019t\u2019 know. Maybe some,\nsomebody in the geminder took care of him.",
        "Q: You\u2019re in Berlin and I think you told me what section of the city were you living in?",
        "A: In Kreutzberg.",
        "Q: In Kreutzberg. How long did you stay there.",
        "A: From December 45 til 51. I got married in 1951.",
        "Q: Oh so you stayed six years in Berlin.",
        "A: Yeah. I went to school. I learned languages. I learned to do, to manage the make-up. I don\u2019t\u2019\nknow. They were from, the HIAS they helped us. (both talking) Too much we could not. And my\nsister went to a nursing school. She finished high school and she went to a nurse but she was\nyounger than me. And then she wanted to go to medical school but then I got married and we\ngot permits to go to America so \u2014",
        "Q: How did you meet your husband?",
        "A: In Berlin I met him.",
        "Q: How\u201d",
        "A: Through friends.",
        "Q: How did he get there? How did he leave the Soviet Union?",
        "A: Yes, he was, Soviet Union. He came, they came home to Poland with his mother and the\nbrother was sick. He had TB on, TB so he went to place. My husband worked very hard to get\nhim to Switzerland. They had a sanatorium there. So he healed.",
        "Q: Did he? He got better?",
        "A: Yes and my husband had already a heart condition. I didn\u2019t know but somehow he lived but\ngave us four children and he took care of us. That\u2019s why I believe in God because we see it that\nwe were very helpless and who helped us.",
        "Q: Is there something else you would like to add to your story for today. You\u2019ve talked about an\nawful lot and it\u2019s only, in a few hours you can never get the full story of a person. But here we\u2019re\nclose to the end and I wanted to ask, is there something else you would want people to know\nwhat you\u2019ve gone through, what you experienced and how you came out of it.",
        "A: The only way I could explain that God took care of us because we by ourselves we had no\nway to go to Israel because the children transports weren\u2019t allowed to go in the time when we,\nwe didn\u2019t\u2019 have where to go and we didn\u2019t know what to do. And somehow God showed us a\nway. We didn\u2019t do it by our self. So I, whatever happens to us it\u2019s not that we\u2019re so smart, that\none is smarter than the next one, some people are smart. And it\u2019s not meant for them to have\nanything. And they struggle. Some people get very rich and some people are not so rich and they\nhave to make the best with what they have. But the main thing in my life 1s whether I did\nanything good that I helped somebody when he needed me. And whenever I could, I was able\nto. I\u2019m not sorry. I\u2019m only sorry that I maybe didn\u2019t do enough. What we tried to do and we\ncould.",
        "Q: Did you tell your children about your experiences during the war. Did you share \u2014",
        "A: No, not when they were young. Now I did. Now when they were, when they understood\nalready, I did. My husband spoke more about it, what he went through. And he was but he\ninjected the belief and he showed me many times in life I thought it\u2019s not going to work. It\u2019s not\ngoing to be good. My husband was sick and I was pregnant with my third child. I didn\u2019t know\nthat from the beginning he struggled plenty too. But everybody does. So he told me and he said\nbut you said he had a small heart attack. He was in besert so he said to me don\u2019t be scared. You\nsee God takes care of us. And if God will want me to live, I will live and don\u2019t worry. God\nprovides for everything. And he injected into the children the belief and trust in God. And we,\nthe truth and it\u2019s a true thing that he could only trust in God because he takes care of us. Because\nourselves, we think we\u2019re smart. We can do. It\u2019s not what happened that night a friend of his\nwent to a wedding and he passed across the street to the subway to get the subway from East\nBroadway and a motorcycle came and on the spot he was dead. So he said there is no insurance\nin life for anything. If you are supposed to live and you have to live, God helps you. But if you\nare supposed to die in one minute, you are dead. So then I said whatever it was, we managed\nand life it\u2019s what you want from life. You\u2019re not here just for our pleasure. We have to be here\nfor other people and whenever we had a friend or my son went to school away to Switzerland\nand aman came. He was also a Holocaust survivor without a hand. And the principal directed\nhim to our house. It was holiday. So he came. He wasn\u2019t an easy person with one hand and my\nyounger daughter had to take him across the subway. He was scared but my husband said he 1s a\nguest. You have to treat him better than yourself. And if he needs your bed, you give your bed to\nhim. So he injected it into the children too. And thanks to him we have good children.",
        "Q: I think not only thanks to him but probably also thanks to you.",
        "A: Yeah but yes, I did too. And whenever he brought somebody home, I never said, I always\ntook him with a smiling face and made them feel good. I guess I got it a little from home too.",
        "Q: Thank you so much. I have appreciated that you took the time to share your story with us.",
        "A: Yeah but I appreciate you. You\u2019re such a wonderful person. There isn\u2019t many like you and I\nreally admire you as a person. I didn\u2019t know you but I wish you all the best. They claim to say\nthat Holocaust survivors have the power to bless people because they went through, that\u2019s what\nthe rabbis say because they like.",
        "Q: Thank you very much.",
        "A: I wish you a happy long happy and good life and you should have joy that life should bring to\nyou.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a real gift thank you. I will say with that , that this concludes our interview, the United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Marcia Loewi on January 8, 2016 in\nBorough Park, New York.",
        "A: Thank you. It\u2019s a pleasure. I learned from you a lot. Because there isn\u2019t many people like you.\nBut thank God there is people.\n(file 2 \u2014 RG-50.030.0870.02.02 \u2014 audio; duration: 22:11)\nIna Navazelskis: this is United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Marcia\nLoewi on March 6, 2016 and this is in addition to the interview that we conducted with Marcia\nLoewi earlier this year in January and should be considered as one interview. In this addition,\nMrs. Loewi would like to add some information that she forgot to mention during our first\ninterview. So now I am going to turn it over to you Mrs. Loewi. Tell me about these points,\nthese things, these experiences that you wanted us to record and give me a little bit of context of\nwhat happened.\nMarcia Loew1: I worked in that, in a small furniture company and one day we came to work and\nthe night shift, the night.",
        "Q: This was in the Lodz ghetto already?",
        "A: Yes, yes, and the night shift, how do you say it.",
        "Q: The night shift is perfectly fine.",
        "A: The night shift people were sitting and crying. We came in like 8:00 and so and there was you\nknow like blood in the street. There was a hospital for mentally ill next and there was next to our\nfactory so at night the Germans came and evacuated the hospital. There were children. They\ncame with trucks and they threw down the children like objects with their heads down.",
        "Q: From the windows.",
        "A: From the windows of the hospital. It was called the Visola street hospital. It\u2019s for mental ill\nand they said what they saw happened. Animals, animals wouldn\u2019t act like this. In essential and\npeople that were not capable. And they had mental illnesses and that\u2019s affected us very badly\nbecause what is a human being. You take and throw it down with their heads. You, so you break\nthe heads and scalps of innocent little children. That were born with defects.",
        "Q: Were these, did anybody have family members perhaps who had been in that hospital. Did\nyou know of anybody who had a dear one or a relative \u2014",
        "A: You see I was a teenager in those times. I was maybe 15, 16. So I, we didn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t\nconnected to a different area than we lived. We lived on the other side of the bridge out from the\nhere in the center of the city. Was a, like a round thing and there was a pomnik, how do you\nsay.",
        "Q: A statue.",
        "A: A statue. There was a statue and from this round circle went different streets. This way, this\nway and out there. That\u2019s how the city was running. And we lived on this side of the city and it\nwent down to the lower streets, to the \u2014",
        "Q: Outside the ghetto when you had \u2014",
        "A: Outside the ghetto. No I don\u2019t, I didn\u2019t know people that and the factory was you had to go\nover a bridge to the other side of the road and the middle was barbed wire. And there a bridge\nthat was there that you shouldn\u2019t have to go through the traffic. It was like a highway.",
        "Q: And was it one part of the ghetto connected to another part of the ghetto.",
        "A: Part of the ghetto yes, but I think this bridge probably was built before the war because it was\na big bridge. You went up steps and there was a walk.",
        "Q: What was the name of the hospital. Do you remember.",
        "A: Visola.",
        "Q: Visola and had it been a hospital before the war.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure. I don\u2019t\u2019 know but I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t build hospitals during the war.",
        "Q: No, but a building could be taken over and made into a hospital.",
        "A: I think it was famous, that\u2019s how they called it Visola hospital and our factory was on beside,\nso it was like one next to the other and there was also a cemetery in back of our factory. Was a\nbig cemetery. Sometimes we used to go there in recess time. So we walked and we talked you\nknow but I didn\u2019t\u2019 have connection with the people. We just heard it and it was a terrifying\nthing. The way they explained like they threw down the kids like with their heads down.",
        "Q: Do you know was this also Polish children as well as Jewish children or do you think it was \u2014",
        "A: No it was part of the ghetto. So I don\u2019t think that the Polish children was in it. About the\nhospital yes. Yeah I don\u2019t think they were only children that probably couldn\u2019t stay home and\nthey needed the attention of a medical attention.",
        "Q: Well you know the Germans had this euthanasia program with in Germany itself for Jews and\nnon-Jews but \u2014",
        "A: The ghetto was separate. The people from the city, the Jewish people there, they evacuated\nand took off everything, the stores. There was a lot, it was a big city of 600,000 population and\n300,000 were Jewish. There were a lot of hospitals, big hospitals. That rich Jews donated to\nbuild the hospitals. There were three big hospitals. There was a very rich man they call\nKoznansky. And this Koznansky built two hospitals in different areas of the city.",
        "Q: And all of that was taken over and stolen basically.",
        "A: Taken over and then, everything they pushed out. And you see people are mean to them\nbecause when we were in the ghetto, we were before the war, my parents built up. They were\nwealthy. We had nine children, but if God wants he gives you, he gives you to make a living.\nYou could work and work and nothing happens but if it\u2019s God\u2019s will whatever you touch goes.\nSo my parents had a beautiful home right before the war. One thing I am, I feel my father went\nto a rabbi.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to pause just for a second. It\u2019s very important.",
        "A: It\u2019s just that everybody was so shattered by what happened you couldn\u2019t\u2019 imagine that people\ndid things to innocent sick children. Like this to children.",
        "Q: Not to see them as worthy of any kind of consideration or dignity or anything.",
        "A: So and then, you see this picture. We had in our bedroom, my parents\u2019 bedroom.",
        "Q: This particular \u2014",
        "A: Not this picture. Was a picture there was once a court and King Solomon was a very smart\nman and he, there were two mothers and one, one the mothers had a fight. Who\u2019s the, one child\nwas missing from the hospital or from whatever. And each one claimed it\u2019s their child, it\u2019s her\nchild. So the king said of the child and you see from the picture we going to cut the baby in two\nand you get half the baby and you get half the baby. So he wanted to see the reaction. And one\nof the mothers went how they said, give her the baby, don\u2019t cut the baby. So he said you are the\nmother and she got the baby.",
        "Q: I remember that story.",
        "A: You remember that story and we had the picture in our bedroom. And this was left and I\ndon\u2019t\u2019 know but my mother said she ordered it. Took a couple years to paint it. cause there\u2019s a\nlot of detail on it. And that expression on the faces was very good. You know the way and their\nmother was running, don\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2019 do it. Stop it.",
        "Q: Don\u2019t hurt the baby.",
        "A: Yeah you heard us talking. We had this painting.",
        "Q: You had it at your home in Lodz. And did you lose that painting when you lost everything\nelse.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think we lost. We came back. there was nothing ours. Nothing was belonging to us\nanymore. Somebody lived in our apartment but he hardly let us in.",
        "Q: Really.",
        "A: And they were neighbors before. They lived on the fourth floor and we lived on the third\nfloor. They went, that nasty but they just weren\u2019t very happy that we came.",
        "Q: But they had taken over your apartment.",
        "A: You see the expensive furniture that we have, they took to the ghetto. There were like two,\nthey had a place for horses for cattle. So they, the people that lived there they had friends of my\ncousin. He had a store that was selling wheat and food for horses and animals. So he exchanged\nthe houses. So we took the expensive dining room set, we took it to the ghetto. But once\nsomebody was showing, if somebody showed who was rich Jews and who has who might have\nmoney, then they came to the house and they looked in the whole house. The children were\nstanding. And my father told us don\u2019t look the direction where I have some, the older children.\nThe younger didn\u2019t know. So we had like medicine cabinet. In that medicine cabinet my father\nbecause somebody denunciated that were rich. So he said don\u2019t look in the direction where I\nhave something because they look in the places and then they follow where everybody 1s nervous\nabout so there was in the bathroom was the medication we had some diamonds. Because my\nfather when he gave up the business for the first year they needed a textile factory to make\nuniforms and they paid for it something. And my father had the raw material. Not finished\ntextile. So they paid something for it and let him stay in the city for a while.",
        "Q: This search was still in your original home, not in the ghetto. When he says don\u2019t look in the -",
        "A: It was in the ghetto.",
        "Q: It was already in the ghetto.",
        "A: Because the Ripo, Criminal Politsar went to look for rich Jews. Ripo Criminal Politsar so\nmy father said he had two rooms, how much did we have in the ghetto. We had two rooms,\nwe\u2019re nine children and the kitchen.",
        "Q: And they didn\u2019t find the diamonds.",
        "A: No we tried to look how to win them but they took away the expensive dining room set. Was\ngorgeous. You don\u2019t see it really.",
        "Q: Who knows where it\u2019s ended up.",
        "A: They took it and then, and then they called my father once to the Ripo. They beat him up and\nsaid what we have we should give. So he saw that dining room was in the office over there where\nthey took him in. They took it out from the ghetto, from the warehouse and they took it. It was\nbeautiful, unusual. It was like African wood and the mahogany veneer was laid out like lion\u2019s\nheads and because that African wood has like a\nSara: a pattern like a zebra. Like I have on my",
        "Q: This is Sara your daughter saying that\nSara: Like that\u2019s on my vanity like crouch mahogany you\u2019re talking about or like zebra wood.",
        "A: It was you see this is a copy. I bought the door that we had. It\u2019s deep dark mahogany. It was\ngorgeous.\nSara: like Crouch mahogany, like clay mahogany.",
        "A: And the doors were lined with marble, was like a winery where you kept the bottles of wine\nliquor and it opened this way. Like on hinges. It came apart when you opened it.\nSara: 1s that the wine rack like the wine cellar.",
        "A: No, like you see sometimes you have hinges you pull out.",
        "Q: You can see that becomes like a surface.",
        "A: It comes like a table.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s finish up with that point then. So your father then is sees this dining room set at the\nRipo headquarters.",
        "A: Because they came once to the house and they looked all over and they found it there.\nProbably people, they told them about it. They probably paid them some to say who the rich\npeople were, people who had where they could take things. People were jealous too you know.\nSara: What about painting.",
        "A: The painting stayed in the house. I don\u2019t think we had work taken, but they took it away\nbecause it was a historical painting. And there was even wider than this because \u2014",
        "Q: And this one, if we look at your painting here it 1s a painting of animals and landscape.",
        "A: Now this my husband picked up here at an auction for $20 when we came to America. He\nhad my, he imported like antique, you see like this Bloom vase I have here. We were importers,\nwe imported and sold antiques. You see I have here a Meissen vase and all this. It was mostly for\nbusiness but he didn\u2019t sell it so I have it. We didn\u2019t go out to buy these things. We had more\nimported but we couldn\u2019t sell 1t because the Americans didn\u2019t like to buy silver and all this. We\nhad to give it away. We needed money. So it was, this is not so important but the dining room\nset was nine, several thousand dollars they paid my parents. That was a piece of art. The table.\nSara: The 1930s, a few thousand dollars 1s like today like 50,000",
        "Q: It\u2019s a lot, it\u2019s a lot and it shows \u2014",
        "A: And it was very unusual, very beautiful. But this they took away. We took it to the ghetto as\nout of the house. Now so they looked all over and he took it away and when they took my father\nand they beat him up, he should say what he has to give, where he has his money so he saw it\nlater on in the Ripo house there. Where they take the people for investigation. People were\njealous to him. People are mean, people are jealous, was hungry, but you couldn\u2019t\u2019 eat the\nfurniture.",
        "Q: Was there anything else. Hang on just a second. Let\u2019s take a look here.",
        "A: The hospital that I thought was important.",
        "Q: It\u2019s very important. Is there any other point that you had wanted to bring up here.",
        "A: No, the little kids like five, six, seven year old kids worked in the straw factory. They were\nwhat. Weavers of straw. They made",
        "Q: What did they make from the straw.",
        "A: Baskets. Baskets. I don\u2019t\u2019 know because they little kids, they used the kids because whatever\nthey could they did. They didn\u2019t pay anything for it. You see like probably we got soap and we\ngot a piece of bread, this size like for a day.",
        "Q: So that would be something like 4 inches by 2 inches.",
        "A: Yeah, this way, this way. You cut the bread and we had to buy it, loaves and it was so heavy\nbecause they left it wet. It should weigh more. So the people that, the bakers could take a little\nflour. It\u2019s still in the oven, much of the same.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to pause for a minute. I\u2019ve turned the machine on again and I just want to be able to\nask if there was anything else you wanted to add to your interview or any final thoughts that you\nhave about what we were talking now or the other time when I was here.",
        "A: You should learn something from mistakes of people before. We shouldn\u2019t repeat the same\nthing because this wouldn\u2019t\u2019 bring any, the world no place\nSara: Anti-Semitism and (both talking)",
        "A: not only anti-Semitism\nSara: discrimination for any",

We didn\u2019t know what was doing and where everything was.\nObviously my father had a radio and he knew more than we knew. So I, in ghetto I worked.",
        "A: The first months that we also tried to go to go away so my father, we hired a you know like a\nbig like what they use to transport merchandise. So we covered it with a canvas and we went to\nthe protectorate. That was not far from Warsaw. It was Lovich. And over there we came and we\ncame to a family. It was Saturday. We couldn\u2019t ride anymore and in Lovich we came toa\nfamily and my youngest brother had croup. So he couldn\u2019t, and then they started evacuating the\nLodz the city and they started the ghetto. So we came back and my father was, it was called\nlumpfun and they needed the raw material to make for the army in what is it called. The\nuniforms for the army. So they had to buy the material and they allowed some Jews that gave\nmaterial. They gave them a green band. We used to have a band with the Juden on the arm. I\nhad to go with the arm, with the band.",
        "A: We were still in the city but then they started evacuating to the ghetto and my cousin knew\nsomebody who lived in the area and he gave him his apartment and there the Polish man that\nused to be his customer gave him his house in the ghetto area. And we moved together with my\ncousins to the ghetto. But my father stayed in the city here, the permit, with the green band.",
        "A: It was like two bedrooms and a kitchen. On the first floor. Was a small house. And they used\nto have a barn for the horses downstairs and my cousin took the downstairs apartment. We took\none upstairs. It was a small house like a private house. They had barns and outside around the\nhouse. Was small like on an outskirts, not like in the city. Small houses.",
        "A: No there was a barbed wire around the ghetto. But later on they took they gave work and\nthey, there was like the highway was wired with barbed wire but in one place was a bridge to go\nto the other side of the ghetto. And when they took us to work there was no school so they took\nus to work. And I worked and it was called klein mabel Fabrik. They made for the children\nthere what do you call it. The play pens, the children\u2019s cribs.",
        "A: Children and also handles for a pail you know the wooden handle, like the carved wood. And\nI helped there because I was a Juden teacher.",
        "A: Teenager so I was working there and there was a supervisor for the kids to see how they treat\nthem. So of course the people that were, they were also tired and hungry because in the ghetto\nalready started now not the same food. We didn\u2019t, we couldn\u2019t buy food. Only what we got.",
        "A: Oh we couldn\u2019t. We were happy to get some barley and potatoes, big deal. And we got\nalready the portions of the bread. But we had to pay for it too. So we worked. They paid\nsomething, not much. So in the ghetto there wasn\u2019t food already. There was a, so the first year\nwhen we had to leave the house we had no, we didn\u2019t get any coal to heat the house. So that they\nhad the barns. The boys broke it down. And we used the wood and the next year in spring we\nturned the ground and we took the eyes from the potatoes, you cut out the eyes from the potato.\nAnd you put it in the ground upside down. And we turned the ground and there was a pump\ndownstairs so we got to work. And when I came home from work I was taking care of the\ngarden, I was the gardener. So we had potatoes, a little tomatoes, we planted things. Of course\nthere was no gates so people stole they were hungry. But the potatoes underground was a big\nhelp. To get what to eat.",
        "A: No because we broke down that we needed the wood.",
        "A: Yeah, the ground. And we didn\u2019t have horses or cows.",
        "A: Inside the ghetto he could go yes. My father worked in a straw factory. I worked in a furniture\nfactories, Klein Mabel, that was over the bridge. We had to go to the other side of the ghetto.",
        "A: They also worked.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t work the same place I did. I think they worked where, straw or something else I\nthink. You know to be honest --",
        "A: No my sister worked in an office and my brother worked in a factory someplace.",
        "A: With the babies she stayed home. They were little babies so you couldn\u2019t leave them. The\nsecond year all they took to the straw factory. They did work. And my father was a problem\nbecause Saturday he didn\u2019t want to work so the meat, there was horsemeat. Horsemeat isn\u2019t\nkosher. My father never ate meat in the ghetto. He never ate, but the children they were hungry\nand they were growing so he permitted to what they gave we ate. But my father didn\u2019t eat the\nmeat.",
        "A: Hiram Kofsky.",
        "A: No, he made up even songs like you know songs that were like sarcastic. Rum Kofsky\nHaim, [Getus Kleim and Ketenes Groten and Ketenes Man] Grot means barley. It was like\ndemanded what gave in the wilderness so we felt everything in the man because there was no\nfood but it fell down from heaven.",
        "A: Yes. So they made a joke like he gives us barley. He made the ghetto was a getta and he says\nit\u2019s gereft. So that was like his song, like he\u2019s a kidder.",
        "A: No. But it wasn\u2019t his fault. He did what he had to do.",
        "A: Yeah we saw him. Not very much, not very much like there were stations where you picked\nup the bread for the week and the bread was so heavy because should weigh more. It wasn\u2019t very\nwell baked. But somehow we bought because my father was in the city so we had some extra\nmoney to buy on the black market. There was a black market.",
        "A: Yeah you know. People that were by foot like it\u2019s all open so they tried to take something\nhome. They didn\u2019t have money to buy it. Out the card, the rations, so they had the money so\nthey had some flour so you can buy a little flour so my mother baked something on Friday. So\nwe were a little better off.",
        "A: That was til 1940 when the Russian war broke out. Everybody went to ghetto. Then it was\nfinished.",
        "A: 41 when the Russian, when the Russians went to war with Germany so --",
        "A: In the ghetto. We were in the ghetto til 1944, August 24, 1944, we left the ghetto.",
        "A: No I was 18.",
        "A: So it was I worked there and then the men came from the school department and he said I am\ngood so they took me to their office to do the evidence. Every morning that when you came to\nwork in the factory, had to go to the office to report. That you are here and you had a cell\nnumber, the floor number where you worked and everywhere they had a number a registry\nnumber. I happened to have a good memory so I worked in the evidence. After a year or so they\ntook me to work in the office. So I was in the registry office. So it was a little easier because I\nremembered so went first. When people came to work in the morning they had to register.",
        "A: Yes there were more than me just. There were some other girls too.",
        "A: Yes you had to carry the heavy wood pieces. They were heavy sticks for the furniture and\nalso we had to chisel. It was hard on the fingers.",
        "A: Much easier.",
        "A: No, food extra no. You go the soup and you got the piece of bread. That\u2019s all you got.",
        "A: You see it was hard there for boys because I didn\u2019t grow too much. Anymore because there\nwasn\u2019t the food what teenagers eat. But I wasn\u2019t so hungry because they used to give kohlrabi. I\ndidn\u2019t like it. But you, I was occupied in the garden. I had this, but the boys were hungry. I\ncould have used another piece of bread but you couldn\u2019t complain because what would they do\nto, it was much harder for the grown boys.",
        "A: In the ghetto. They were guarding by the wires. By the barbed wires. That people shouldn\u2019t\nrun out from the ghetto.",
        "A: They patrolled it then the borders. The Germans came every so often. They came to grab the\npeople wherever they could. They took them to concentration camps before us. We were the last\ntransport and they take, took children. They took men. I had an aunt that lived from my mother\u2019s\nside. When they had the rations they came and they went into every house to seize the people.\nAnd they took out whoever they wanted. Old people, young people. So my father we had the, it\nwas a small house and under the steps was a place where you could go in so my father opened\nthe floor. He cut the floor open and he made a hiding place. They shouldn\u2019t come there because\nthey took children and everybody to take for killing. So when they were the rations we lived on,\nit was like you see here, (gesturing with hands in circular motion) the streets went like this so\nlike you lived on this side of the street, on the other side. There was a small place that you could\ngo through to the other street without going around. So this place when they, the ration, when\nthere were Auslang there were --",
        "A: People away. My brother bought a band as a policeman and he came to warn us we should\nhide in the hiding place.",
        "A: No he just --",
        "A: He just got the band. He wasn\u2019t a policemen. He just got the band. For the, from the police\nstation. He pay something like a loaf. So he came so we went down with the children. Also was\nan old lady. My father she could, they also were afraid they\u2019d take the old people for killing too.\nSo we he dug it, a hole and from the center he made two like benches to sit. He put a piece of\nboard so that people could hide there. and we knew that if we heard the steps so we locked the\nchildren\u2019s mouth. He shouldn\u2019t hear noises. And when they went away someone brought the key\nand that we could go out so that we could go into the houses.",
        "A: It, it happened. It happened. The last time it happened my mother was so scared because there\nwere shots outside and she imagined that they killed my brother so we gave up and we went\naway with, but it was already the end. Two weeks later the whole ghetto was evacuated.",
        "A: Yeah who had to hide. It was a risk because they took away, they had no use for small\nchildren, so they killed them. They killed them. We don\u2019t know where they took them. My\naunt we heard, she had two boys. Her husband ran to Russia and she was stayed with two boys\nso she lived not far from us and we took her in whenever she was all alone. So she\u2019s also\nresiding there. And we heard that they took them to the ocean, to the boat to the ocean and they\nthrew this transport of people into the ocean alive. We didn\u2019t know what happened but then we\nheard from people after the war. That\u2019s what happened. So she had two boys. One was nine, one\nwas eleven. And the husband died in Russia. He never came back.",
        "A: Well going. No it was closed after a certain time. In the beginning of January, February 1940\nwas closed the ghetto.",
        "A: Was people yes. After work there wasn\u2019t people that lived in the area you saw. You didn\u2019t\nhave time to go because we worked.",
        "A: Oh yes, you saw people like skin and bone because they couldn\u2019t live from what they lived.\nAnd sometimes they were older people they didn\u2019t even have the money. You had to pay for it\ntoo. To buy it. So they thought and it happened that people kept the corpse to get the food. They\nkept the corpse, people, after they died to, to get. They were hungry so they got the food to they\ncould live. Yes, they were starving. Was very bad. We were hungry in the ghetto. There was a\njoke that was a song in and I have for you a good thing. A roll with butter that this would be the\nbest thing for you. You know like a little something. So the other boy answered I cannot, I\ncannot laugh because if I look at my sick old father I cannot laugh and I cannot enjoy anything.\nYou know a child\u2019s conversation was in a song they made up jokes but it was not a joke.",
        "A: Of course they changed but you, main thing in a Jewish family is your family. That\u2019s what\nyou live for, for your family and to help people if you can. A person isn\u2019t born just for yourself.\nYou were born here, but sometimes I need you, sometimes you need me but people need people.\nI don\u2019t know if Iam expressing myself.",
        "A: My brothers were, my brother was already big and the ones that were over ten, you know you\ngrow up fast then in a big family. Over ten, eleven, twelve, you already people. You had\nresponsibilities. In a big family somehow everybody 1s close. We cared for each other.",
        "A: Yes, yes. How we survived you know. Sometimes people ask how did you survive. Honestly\nI don\u2019t know. God wanted it, it was the way. Then when they sent us to Auschwitz and when\nthey shaved our hair, I didn\u2019t see, I couldn\u2019t recognize my sister next to me. My other sister went\nwith my mother, straight off then and I saw through the bath house where they were where we\ntook the baths and when they cut us off the hair. We were standing (points at camera), there was\nbig windows downstairs and there were people standing outlined and I think I saw my father\nwith the two, took, all the boys like eight, eight, nine, ten and my mother we never saw since we\nleft the train that brought us to Auschwitz. I never saw her. But the capo that took us off was a\nJewish police. My sister went with my mother so he told her don\u2019t go there. This way they going\nto kill you. They burn and they gas you, and they burn you. So she said no it\u2019s my children. I\nwant to go with them. They took, they told us that the mothers will take care of the children,\nwhich wasn\u2019t true, wasn\u2019t true. It wasn\u2019t. And on the way when we went from the baths to the, to\nthe barracks where we stayed, there was a big road with puddles and they didn\u2019t give us shoes.\nSo we walked on the road. Oh you leaving. (someone off camera says they are leaving)",
        "A: We heard shots outside.",
        "A: So she said, she was very, she was hysterical. And we were still in the hole there. The last\ntime we didn\u2019t see until we saw him we didn\u2019t know that he is alive. So my mother said to my\nfather he cannot take it what would be. So it looks like the end. So my father knew something\nabout Auschwitz. So we went on those, you could only take a bag, a duffel bag on the --",
        "A: With nothing. Left the hiding place, went upstairs. We ate something. When they came next\ntime we were there. They took us.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: To Auschwitz. That was it was about two weeks later the ghetto was liquidated.",
        "A: Yes. We left on the 24\" and \u2014",
        "A: All way we\u2019re together. You know was, was really we struggled to be together. And but we\nall went. And then when the train stopped my father was went down and he saw the sign\nAuschwitz. He knew about Auschwitz. We didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: What. Because he told my brother and my older sister, don\u2019t tell mommy anything. It\u2019s not\ngood. And he gave us, he had some, when he sold the merchandise from you know when the\nGermans bought the merchandise. So he bought diamonds because you couldn\u2019t run with the\nmerchandise and you couldn\u2019t run with money. So he bought diamonds. So he get all the\nchildren. He gave each one a diamond and I had a wisdom tooth here (points to jaw). I had a\ncotton over. So I put one diamond. He gave me two. One diamond here and one here (points to\nother side of jaw) and I didn\u2019t know whatever he gave me. I tried, he said if you have to save\nyour life, give it away. Or if you need to get food or anything. He knew something what was\ngoing on. So he give all the older children, the three older children, four older children, my sister\ntoo. But she, and \u2014",
        "A: Before we went off the trains he gave us. (both talking) In Auschwitz yeah he gave us this.\nSo, so I put one (points at jaw) here, but the night when I saw we went to the barracks. On the\nway we Saw in the distance a white, in white uniforms a band was playing Vienna waltz. And in\nthe background we heard the screaming. To deaden down the screaming so the band was\nplaying very loud. But you could still hear something. And then my throat got so dry, when I\nwasn\u2019t hungry, I wasn\u2019t thirsty. I was just feeling like I am choking. Because I knew what\u2019s\ngoing to happen. He said, he told us open that they gas you and they burn you. So I imagine all\nthis. And then we went to the barracks. You\u2019re tired. I didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t eat and we didn\u2019t drink.\nAnd the first night we slept on the floor.",
        "A: No, no. Just me and my sister.",
        "A: We both went, my younger sister. My older sister went with my mother.",
        "A: We were all together on the train, on the \u2014",
        "A: No they have selected, left right. To work or mothers and children on the other side.",
        "A: And father too. My father was a little afraid too but he told me not to tell mommy anything\nbecause she shouldn\u2019t, she shouldn\u2019t be a shock. Happened, what happened. That night on the,\non the way we didn\u2019t get shoes. We just got something. They took away everything we had and\nthey cut off the hair and we waited there. They put some sanitizer on top of the, I didn\u2019t\nrecognize my sister. She looked different without hair. So but we were standing there by the big\nwindow and we saw outside lined up the men and we were only girls here on this side. So and I\nheard them singing. I fell down (shouting?) but what can you do. You can\u2019t do anything. We\ncame to this lager. The first night they didn\u2019t send us to the right place. And another lady well\nlike lying down (lies backward) and top of you was another person. The next day they sent us to\nlager 20 or 21 and we got already on bunk beds. Of straw. But was an improvement on laying on\nthe floor. And then every night at 2:00 they came we should coffee (home?). To drink coffee so\nsome girls went and that night that was already, we were already a few weeks in. Maybe six\nweeks in Auschwitz.",
        "A: One I lost right away. The first night, but one I saved (gestures both sides of jaw). The better\none I lost but this one I saved and when we got to that room I was afraid to drink or eat anything.\nI didn\u2019t realize that I lost this one so the diamond I, there was a girl. She came to the, to the same\nplace where we had the bunk beds. And she knew how to , so I was very scared. I was_watching\nthem so much because my brothers gave it away in Bergen Belsen for food. So they could get\nsomething. And we didn\u2019t know but after the war we met them. So and after, after we drank\ncoffee 2:00 at night we had to stand outside lined up in file. And it was already cold in Poland\nwithout shoes. Some girls got like Dutch wooden shoes. So I put the foot a little on the back of\nthe foot. I shouldn\u2019t stand on the ground so much. My legs got frozen cause over there the\nclimate is different than here. And then in beginning of October they sent us to a working camp\nto Sudetenland to \u2014",
        "A: Czechoslovakia. But we went under quarantine.",
        "A: Yes, quarantine because they had to make sure that we healthy to go to work, was an\nammunition factory.",
        "A: [had a cold. I think that they sent us, they gave us in Auschwitz I didn\u2019t have shoes. But I\nthink when they sent us out to Harmstadt I think we got shoes and they even my friend hacked\noff from the nightgown a piece to cover that we were without hair so to put like a kerchief on the\nhead and when we came to. So we went, I was sick and I pinched my sister she should look\nhealthy. And I was scared too. If you didn\u2019t look healthy they wouldn\u2019t send you to work. And\nwe were happy to get out. And my friend was so friendly. We stayed all the time til the end of\nthe war together. She knew how to sew. And in that working camp they were French working\nalso in the same factory in the ammunition factory. So they brought us a needle and thread and I\nsewed it into the nightgown because I was always so scared that I lose it.",
        "A: It was very tough. I didn\u2019t have (gestures at jaw) when I ate I took it out cause \u2014",

We found\na picture after the war, my grandmother\u2019s sister came before the war to visit and we gave her\nsome pictures so she gave us after the war. Because we didn\u2019t take anything from our house. We\ncouldn\u2019t.",

Maybe if she\nknew maybe it wasn\u2019t so good that we didn\u2019t know. Because then but this capo the one that was\nthe, that was taking the people off the trains, he told, don\u2019t go there, don\u2019t go there.",

        "A: Yes and they told us you know because the people that worked there but you still you know,\nsubconsciously you hope that maybe they made it, maybe they lived. But with my mother I knew\nright away. With my sister and the two younger children. I knew it right away that it\u2019s not good.\nBut you\u2019re helpless. What can we do. What could we have done. And even in Auschwitz there\nwere also (interruption)",

And some girls\nwere sent in the same building where we stayed or two floors down was a, weaving company.\nAnd some girls were sent there. Some of the girls. I met one after the war once in a hotel in the\nlobby. I saw people from, they looked like similar. Asked where you from. She said I\u2019m from\nLodz. So I saw where were you during the war. She was in the same place, we slept in the same\nplace. But she worked downstairs but we knew each other. There were 500 girls altogether.",

And you just. It was a\nmachine. You had to get it down and cut out. It wasn\u2019t easy work. Was hard work. But better\nthan Auschwitz. In Auschwitz you didn\u2019t work but you were standing hours outside at night and\ninstead of sleeping. Here at least you could sleep a little and on Sunday you could get a shower.\nAnd you could wash your clothes. You had the Sunday that you had, it was more humanely.\nAnd even the people. I mean one officer was nasty.",
        "A: Yes, nasty and she one night I fell asleep by the machine because there was no work. So she\ncame over, she knocked out two teeth. Because I fell asleep.

        "A: Yeah we were liberated but a week before we were liberated, or maybe a few days they told\nus that we\u2019re going to go someplace else. We should be ready. Because they wanted to send us.\nAnd what happened. The Russians came first then. Then you saw and they didn\u2019t send us but\nthen we found out, the French told us. They knew more than we did. Because they had the\nradios. And they lived in, with families together. We they weren\u2019t like we because they were\nfrom the border between Germany and France.",
        "A: No, no. They worked like we did. They were also prisoners like but it was families, not like\nwe lived in the ghetto. They lived over there.",
        "A: The men worked. We didn\u2019t see any French women, only the men worked in the, but they had\nfamilies there. Yes they lived in there but they didn\u2019t come to work. The men came to work.\nAnd we were only girls that worked there. Some girls maybe one was 25, one was 26, 27, those\nwere the older girls. But otherwise we are girls are working.",
        "A: No we didn\u2019t even realize when they told us we\u2019re going on the, on those, that we\u2019re going to\na different place. The French told us there\u2019s mines on the road and they wanted to send us to test\nthe mines before the Russians came. They wanted to try and test if the mines are working. So\nthey wanted to send us as --",
        "A: Well it wasn\u2019t a big thing. Jewish children who are,. How do you know God leads the\nworld, not the people. Even the big people don\u2019t lead the world. That\u2019s we, that\u2019s people that\nbelieve, believe that God leads the world.",
        "A: Yeah we prayed by heart what we knew how to pray. We didn\u2019t have books.",
        "A: While we were bitter, we were very bitter, even after the war. Why did it have to happen.\nThose children never sinned. They were little kids. They never did anything.",
        "A: Yeah we lost for a while, we weren\u2019t so religious. For a while.",
        "A: We saw that the folks, that God took care of us. We were like lost sheep. We didn\u2019t have\nwhere to go. We did not, even when the war ended. What choice was it. We thought that if the\nwar would end everybody would come and try to help us. There was nobody to help. No there,\nI wouldn\u2019t say the Czech government wasn\u2019t there. They gave us money to go home. And when\nthe war was over, the French came in. They sang the Marseilles and they said the war is over.\nAnd where did we have to go? We didn\u2019t have (both talking)",
        "A: The Russians but they were drunken. You know they came from Afghanistan, Kavkaz, they\nwere Russian, very wild, drunken soldiers. It was scary. It was very scary.",
        "A: Yes, yes. There was one major that came from Minsk, from a big city. And he said I am\nJewish. And try to get out of the way because they\u2019re not out for any good. Because they were\ndrunk and they wanted to have a good time. What were they interested in?",
        "A: Yeah one girl ran away. She was very tall. Then we ran away from that place where we\nstayed in that factory because the Russians came in and to them, you know they are on the way.\nThey wanted to have a good time. And we were very scared so we found a house. It\u2019s the\nGermans left, just like we left because they ran away too from the Russians. So we were hiding\nthere. And then once the Russians came too and he picked the tallest girl. And it was already\nnight and we didn\u2019t know. And so she ran to a place where little rabbits hide. And she was very\ntall. She said she does not how she do it. He was drunk. She ran away and she, all night she\nstayed in this place in the rabbit place. And in the morning when it was light she saw he isn\u2019t\nthere anymore. She came back to the house. And then we got scared to stay there too. So we\nwent to Prague. And the authorities. I don\u2019t know what the stories, I can\u2019t even remember.\nSome girl, we stayed in the place in that factory place where we slept for a while. But then this\nRussian came and we were scared of them. There was no place where to go what to do. Then we\nwent some, but they told us we could go to trains. They gave trains to Prague. We stayed all\nnight, one night and it was scary for young girls to be any place. You weren\u2019t safe any place.",
        "A: In Prague they gave us money and then we went to Poland to go home. So we went to trains.\nThey gave money for the trains and they took care of our papers so I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Jewish. I don\u2019t know if it was only, the Czech were very nice, even the supervisor in the\nfactory, he was also very nice.",
        "A: Yes, he spoke German but he was, they behaved different you know. Different people. We\nweren\u2019t so scared. They were normal kind of people and they couldn\u2019t do anything for us but at\nleast they didn\u2019t scare us.",
        "A: We got back to Lodz but I went, we went through, we didn\u2019t have much money. The first\nlittle town we got coming over there, the border from Czechoslovakia to Poland, there are some\nPolish ladies by the station where the first station. And they said so many of you are still alive.\nWe were three girls. Three. I don\u2019t think there were more than three girls. So but then we met\nsomebody told us that our uncle, my mother\u2019s brother is alive and they told us already they went\nback to look for their family, the two older girls. And they took us for the night to their house.\nAnd they were so nice. They called us children. So they got out of their beds and they stayed,\nslept on the floor and gave me and my sister the beds to sleep and gave us money to go to\nPavyanets to see to my uncle.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: On my mother\u2019s side.",
        "A: So he gotten freed in April because he was in a different place. And he got freed in March or\nApril, the Russians came. In before. Then he went home and they also have a bakery so he got\nhis bakery and they had what to eat and they took us in and took us, all the what they call it,\nchildren that lost their families, orphans. They took, they were also teenagers. But they took\nthem in and they took us in too.",
        "A: For a while and then my aunt was pregnant. She was expecting a baby and we were scared to\nbe in Poland. Because in small towns they killed Jews. Lodz was a bigger city. Was not so\ndangerous but we were scared and then we found out in the, when you came to Lodz was like a\nbig board and you (gestures with hand over shoulder off camera) registered. Who 1s looking for\nwhom. So my brothers registered from Bergen Belsen that they are looking for family. And\nthen they stayed in the younger brother stayed in Germany and my older brother came back and\nhe came back to look for us. So he came to my aunt. But I was sick. I went to some place with\nmy uncle to buy flour and then I got a typhus and I was in the hospital. So when my brother\ncame back he couldn\u2019t see me, only through the window because \u2014",
        "A: Yes. Yes, I was under.",
        "A: My sister was in the house and I was in the hospital.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah and then when we both, when we all got to Germany to Berlin, my aunt had the baby in\nDecember.",
        "A: Yeah, they sold the bakery whatever money they got, we have to pay money to smuggle us\nand they we were on trains with coal and you paid the people working and they put us between\nthe coal.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t want to stay there, was dangerous.",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t because they wouldn\u2019t let us in.",
        "A: The Poles might . I don\u2019t know but they took care of it. Then they paid them and we ended\nup in West Berlin.",
        "A: Yes, probably the Russians, the Russians wouldn\u2019t let us out because was already the city\nwas divided into, into French, English, Russian and American.",
        "A: Berlin, yes.",
        "A: In American.",
        "A: We could go to the French but once we had plans to either we go to Israel or to America.\nThere was no other places to go.",
        "A: One brother. Then we went back to pick up my other brother. He was in Germany and then\nwe stayed there. The German, the government, the geminder gave an apartment to my aunt.\nWas the first Jewish child born in from there, from those people and the Americans gave my\nuncle a bakery so he baked for the Americans. (both talking)",
        "A: Yeah in Berlin and there was at that point between those orphans was a boy at that point from\nthe city where my uncle lived and two girls, three girls. And my aunt, two girls got married and\nbut that boy stayed in Berlin. I don\u2019t know what happened. One girl went to France. She had an\nuncle there. And the others, the other one had some family in Israel. So they went and they, we\ncouldn\u2019t go to Israel. They wouldn\u2019t let us.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: After a while we lived separately but we lived in, we didn\u2019t go to the DP camps. We lived in\nthe city because of my aunt, yeah. At this point we sold the diamond. We were on our own and\nstarted doing something.",
        "A: I gave it to my brother. They took care of us. Because the girls you know it\u2019s different.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t have. She lost it. And I lost mine, the second one. Too. But nobody worried about\nit. That was helpful.",
        "A: And it was a good thing because he would give you anything. It\u2019s good the uncle and aunt\ntook care of us but you know they had already a baby and they took care of the other but the deaf\nboy was a little helpless. Because he couldn\u2019t speak. But then some, I don\u2019t\u2019 know. Maybe some,\nsomebody in the geminder took care of him.",
        "A: In Kreutzberg.",
        "A: From December 45 til 51. I got married in 1951.",
        "A: Yeah. I went to school. I learned languages. I learned to do, to manage the make-up. I don\u2019t\u2019\nknow. They were from, the HIAS they helped us. (both talking) Too much we could not. And my\nsister went to a nursing school. She finished high school and she went to a nurse but she was\nyounger than me. And then she wanted to go to medical school but then I got married and we\ngot permits to go to America so \u2014",
        "A: In Berlin I met him.",
        "A: Through friends.",
        "A: Yes, he was, Soviet Union. He came, they came home to Poland with his mother and the\nbrother was sick. He had TB on, TB so he went to place. My husband worked very hard to get\nhim to Switzerland. They had a sanatorium there. So he healed.",
        "A: Yes and my husband had already a heart condition. I didn\u2019t know but somehow he lived but\ngave us four children and he took care of us. That\u2019s why I believe in God because we see it that\nwe were very helpless and who helped us.",
        "A: The only way I could explain that God took care of us because we by ourselves we had no\nway to go to Israel because the children transports weren\u2019t allowed to go in the time when we,\nwe didn\u2019t\u2019 have where to go and we didn\u2019t know what to do. And somehow God showed us a\nway. We didn\u2019t do it by our self. So I, whatever happens to us it\u2019s not that we\u2019re so smart, that\none is smarter than the next one, some people are smart. And it\u2019s not meant for them to have\nanything. And they struggle. Some people get very rich and some people are not so rich and they\nhave to make the best with what they have. But the main thing in my life 1s whether I did\nanything good that I helped somebody when he needed me. And whenever I could, I was able\nto. I\u2019m not sorry. I\u2019m only sorry that I maybe didn\u2019t do enough. What we tried to do and we\ncould.",
        "A: No, not when they were young. Now I did. Now when they were, when they understood\nalready, I did. My husband spoke more about it, what he went through. And he was but he\ninjected the belief and he showed me many times in life I thought it\u2019s not going to work. It\u2019s not\ngoing to be good. My husband was sick and I was pregnant with my third child. I didn\u2019t know\nthat from the beginning he struggled plenty too. But everybody does. So he told me and he said\nbut you said he had a small heart attack. He was in besert so he said to me don\u2019t be scared. You\nsee God takes care of us. And if God will want me to live, I will live and don\u2019t worry. God\nprovides for everything. And he injected into the children the belief and trust in God. And we,\nthe truth and it\u2019s a true thing that he could only trust in God because he takes care of us. Because\nourselves, we think we\u2019re smart. We can do. It\u2019s not what happened that night a friend of his\nwent to a wedding and he passed across the street to the subway to get the subway from East\nBroadway and a motorcycle came and on the spot he was dead. So he said there is no insurance\nin life for anything. If you are supposed to live and you have to live, God helps you. But if you\nare supposed to die in one minute, you are dead. So then I said whatever it was, we managed\nand life it\u2019s what you want from life. You\u2019re not here just for our pleasure. We have to be here\nfor other people and whenever we had a friend or my son went to school away to Switzerland\nand aman came. He was also a Holocaust survivor without a hand. And the principal directed\nhim to our house. It was holiday. So he came. He wasn\u2019t an easy person with one hand and my\nyounger daughter had to take him across the subway. He was scared but my husband said he 1s a\nguest. You have to treat him better than yourself. And if he needs your bed, you give your bed to\nhim. So he injected it into the children too. And thanks to him we have good children.",
        "A: Yeah but yes, I did too. And whenever he brought somebody home, I never said, I always\ntook him with a smiling face and made them feel good. I guess I got it a little from home too.",
        "A: Yeah but I appreciate you. You\u2019re such a wonderful person. There isn\u2019t many like you and I\nreally admire you as a person. I didn\u2019t know you but I wish you all the best. They claim to say\nthat Holocaust survivors have the power to bless people because they went through, that\u2019s what\nthe rabbis say because they like.",
        "A: I wish you a happy long happy and good life and you should have joy that life should bring to\nyou.",
        "A: Thank you. It\u2019s a pleasure. I learned from you a lot. Because there isn\u2019t many people like you.\nBut thank God there is people.\n(file 2 \u2014 RG-50.030.0870.02.02 \u2014 audio; duration: 22:11)\nIna Navazelskis: this is United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Marcia\nLoewi on March 6, 2016 and this is in addition to the interview that we conducted with Marcia\nLoewi earlier this year in January and should be considered as one interview. In this addition,\nMrs. Loewi would like to add some information that she forgot to mention during our first\ninterview. So now I am going to turn it over to you Mrs. Loewi. Tell me about these points,\nthese things, these experiences that you wanted us to record and give me a little bit of context of\nwhat happened.\nMarcia Loew1: I worked in that, in a small furniture company and one day we came to work and\nthe night shift, the night.",
        "A: Yes, yes, and the night shift, how do you say it.",
        "A: The night shift people were sitting and crying. We came in like 8:00 and so and there was you\nknow like blood in the street. There was a hospital for mentally ill next and there was next to our\nfactory so at night the Germans came and evacuated the hospital. There were children. They\ncame with trucks and they threw down the children like objects with their heads down.",
        "A: From the windows of the hospital. It was called the Visola street hospital. It\u2019s for mental ill\nand they said what they saw happened. Animals, animals wouldn\u2019t act like this. In essential and\npeople that were not capable. And they had mental illnesses and that\u2019s affected us very badly\nbecause what is a human being. You take and throw it down with their heads. You, so you break\nthe heads and scalps of innocent little children. That were born with defects.",
        "A: You see I was a teenager in those times. I was maybe 15, 16. So I, we didn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t\nconnected to a different area than we lived. We lived on the other side of the bridge out from the\nhere in the center of the city. Was a, like a round thing and there was a pomnik, how do you\nsay.",
        "A: A statue. There was a statue and from this round circle went different streets. This way, this\nway and out there. That\u2019s how the city was running. And we lived on this side of the city and it\nwent down to the lower streets, to the \u2014",
        "A: Outside the ghetto. No I don\u2019t, I didn\u2019t know people that and the factory was you had to go\nover a bridge to the other side of the road and the middle was barbed wire. And there a bridge\nthat was there that you shouldn\u2019t have to go through the traffic. It was like a highway.",
        "A: Part of the ghetto yes, but I think this bridge probably was built before the war because it was\na big bridge. You went up steps and there was a walk.",
        "A: Visola.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure. I don\u2019t\u2019 know but I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t build hospitals during the war.",
        "A: I think it was famous, that\u2019s how they called it Visola hospital and our factory was on beside,\nso it was like one next to the other and there was also a cemetery in back of our factory. Was a\nbig cemetery. Sometimes we used to go there in recess time. So we walked and we talked you\nknow but I didn\u2019t\u2019 have connection with the people. We just heard it and it was a terrifying\nthing. The way they explained like they threw down the kids like with their heads down.",
        "A: No it was part of the ghetto. So I don\u2019t think that the Polish children was in it. About the\nhospital yes. Yeah I don\u2019t think they were only children that probably couldn\u2019t stay home and\nthey needed the attention of a medical attention.",
        "A: The ghetto was separate. The people from the city, the Jewish people there, they evacuated\nand took off everything, the stores. There was a lot, it was a big city of 600,000 population and\n300,000 were Jewish. There were a lot of hospitals, big hospitals. That rich Jews donated to\nbuild the hospitals. There were three big hospitals. There was a very rich man they call\nKoznansky. And this Koznansky built two hospitals in different areas of the city.",
        "A: Taken over and then, everything they pushed out. And you see people are mean to them\nbecause when we were in the ghetto, we were before the war, my parents built up. They were\nwealthy. We had nine children, but if God wants he gives you, he gives you to make a living.\nYou could work and work and nothing happens but if it\u2019s God\u2019s will whatever you touch goes.\nSo my parents had a beautiful home right before the war. One thing I am, I feel my father went\nto a rabbi.",
        "A: It\u2019s just that everybody was so shattered by what happened you couldn\u2019t\u2019 imagine that people\ndid things to innocent sick children. Like this to children.",
        "A: So and then, you see this picture. We had in our bedroom, my parents\u2019 bedroom.",
        "A: Not this picture. Was a picture there was once a court and King Solomon was a very smart\nman and he, there were two mothers and one, one the mothers had a fight. Who\u2019s the, one child\nwas missing from the hospital or from whatever. And each one claimed it\u2019s their child, it\u2019s her\nchild. So the king said of the child and you see from the picture we going to cut the baby in two\nand you get half the baby and you get half the baby. So he wanted to see the reaction. And one\nof the mothers went how they said, give her the baby, don\u2019t cut the baby. So he said you are the\nmother and she got the baby.",
        "A: You remember that story and we had the picture in our bedroom. And this was left and I\ndon\u2019t\u2019 know but my mother said she ordered it. Took a couple years to paint it. cause there\u2019s a\nlot of detail on it. And that expression on the faces was very good. You know the way and their\nmother was running, don\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2019 do it. Stop it.",
        "A: Yeah you heard us talking. We had this painting.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think we lost. We came back. there was nothing ours. Nothing was belonging to us\nanymore. Somebody lived in our apartment but he hardly let us in.",
        "A: And they were neighbors before. They lived on the fourth floor and we lived on the third\nfloor. They went, that nasty but they just weren\u2019t very happy that we came.",
        "A: You see the expensive furniture that we have, they took to the ghetto. There were like two,\nthey had a place for horses for cattle. So they, the people that lived there they had friends of my\ncousin. He had a store that was selling wheat and food for horses and animals. So he exchanged\nthe houses. So we took the expensive dining room set, we took it to the ghetto. But once\nsomebody was showing, if somebody showed who was rich Jews and who has who might have\nmoney, then they came to the house and they looked in the whole house. The children were\nstanding. And my father told us don\u2019t look the direction where I have some, the older children.\nThe younger didn\u2019t know. So we had like medicine cabinet. In that medicine cabinet my father\nbecause somebody denunciated that were rich. So he said don\u2019t look in the direction where I\nhave something because they look in the places and then they follow where everybody 1s nervous\nabout so there was in the bathroom was the medication we had some diamonds. Because my\nfather when he gave up the business for the first year they needed a textile factory to make\nuniforms and they paid for it something. And my father had the raw material. Not finished\ntextile. So they paid something for it and let him stay in the city for a while.",
        "A: It was in the ghetto.",
        "A: Because the Ripo, Criminal Politsar went to look for rich Jews. Ripo Criminal Politsar so\nmy father said he had two rooms, how much did we have in the ghetto. We had two rooms,\nwe\u2019re nine children and the kitchen.",
        "A: No we tried to look how to win them but they took away the expensive dining room set. Was\ngorgeous. You don\u2019t see it really.",
        "A: They took it and then, and then they called my father once to the Ripo. They beat him up and\nsaid what we have we should give. So he saw that dining room was in the office over there where\nthey took him in. They took it out from the ghetto, from the warehouse and they took it. It was\nbeautiful, unusual. It was like African wood and the mahogany veneer was laid out like lion\u2019s\nheads and because that African wood has like a\nSara: a pattern like a zebra. Like I have on my",
        "A: It was you see this is a copy. I bought the door that we had. It\u2019s deep dark mahogany. It was\ngorgeous.\nSara: like Crouch mahogany, like clay mahogany.",
        "A: And the doors were lined with marble, was like a winery where you kept the bottles of wine\nliquor and it opened this way. Like on hinges. It came apart when you opened it.\nSara: 1s that the wine rack like the wine cellar.",
        "A: No, like you see sometimes you have hinges you pull out.",
        "A: It comes like a table.",
        "A: Because they came once to the house and they looked all over and they found it there.\nProbably people, they told them about it. They probably paid them some to say who the rich\npeople were, people who had where they could take things. People were jealous too you know.\nSara: What about painting.",
        "A: The painting stayed in the house. I don\u2019t think we had work taken, but they took it away\nbecause it was a historical painting. And there was even wider than this because \u2014",
        "A: Now this my husband picked up here at an auction for $20 when we came to America. He\nhad my, he imported like antique, you see like this Bloom vase I have here. We were importers,\nwe imported and sold antiques. You see I have here a Meissen vase and all this. It was mostly for\nbusiness but he didn\u2019t sell it so I have it. We didn\u2019t go out to buy these things. We had more\nimported but we couldn\u2019t sell 1t because the Americans didn\u2019t like to buy silver and all this. We\nhad to give it away. We needed money. So it was, this is not so important but the dining room\nset was nine, several thousand dollars they paid my parents. That was a piece of art. The table.\nSara: The 1930s, a few thousand dollars 1s like today like 50,000",
        "A: And it was very unusual, very beautiful. But this they took away. We took it to the ghetto as\nout of the house. Now so they looked all over and he took it away and when they took my father\nand they beat him up, he should say what he has to give, where he has his money so he saw it\nlater on in the Ripo house there. Where they take the people for investigation. People were\njealous to him. People are mean, people are jealous, was hungry, but you couldn\u2019t\u2019 eat the\nfurniture.",
        "A: The hospital that I thought was important.",
