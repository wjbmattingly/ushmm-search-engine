        "Q: Good morning, Carola.",
        "A: Good morning.",
        "Q: It's nice to be with you.",
        "A: Same here, nice to meet you.",
        "Q: Can you give me your name that you were born with and where you were born and when,\nplease?",
        "A: Right. I was born Carola Stern in 1925, March the 8th. No, March the 8th, right. In Nieder-\nohmen, Germany. And my father's name was Meier Stern. My mother's name was Hedwig\nStern, and we lived in Nieder-ohmen for many, many years before -- my parents were both\nborn there. My grandparents were born there, and I believe my great grandparents were born\nthere.",
        "Q: You had a sister?",
        "A: I do have a sister, yes. She was just about 15 months older than me, and we lived very\nhappily in Nieder-ohmen.",
        "Q: Tell me what you father did for a living.",
        "A: My father was a cattle dealer and so had been my grandfather before him. And my father had\nsisters and brothers who more or less helped 1n this field. And then my grandfather was\ngetting older, my father took over. So we had cattles, and we had everything. We had\nchickens and we had goats and we had a marvelous time, especially when we were young.\nAnd we had eggs and we raised potatoes, and we had a whole farm. We were actually\nfarmers.",
        "Q: So including cattle and animals?",
        "A: Including cattle, yes. We had a stall with cattles where my mother reluctantly went in the\nmorning to milk the cows. It was a little shtetl, and we had people who helped. And we were\nfarmers, just like anybody else in Nieder-ohmen. There was never any difference; we were\nJewish, but we didn't feel it. We were Germans first. Jews were secondary -- nobody\nbothered with this religion. And since my father was a veteran of World War I, he was very\nwell liked. Very well liked. And whenever someone had a problem in Nieder-ohmen, my\nfather was sure to solve it. We called him later on the Kissinger\u2019 of Nieder-ohmen.",
        "Q: And do you remember any particular thing, problem that came up that he solved?",
        "A: Well, there were problems with marriages. One wanted a divorce from one another, so they\nwould come to my father and ask him could he talk to this one and that one. My father did,\nand he usually solved everything. He was very well liked. So was my mother.",
        "Q: And tell me about your mother.",
        "A: My mother was about 13 years younger as my father. So we looked upon my father as the\nhead of the house, and my mother was one of us. She was a young girl. She always has been,\nand as we grew older, she sort of looked for guidance towards us, to my sister and me. And\nwe became sort of like three sisters. She was quite young, she was still our mother. I mean I\nwouldn't say when it came to disciplining us, she was the head of the house. She knew just\nwhat to do, but basically we grew up together with our mother.",
        "Q: If your mother was 13 years younger than your father, do you know approximately how old\nthey were at this time?",
        "A: My mother was 20. She was 19 when she got engaged, and my father must have been 32.\nAnd my mother, and then she got married at 20 when my father was 33. And from the same\nvillage, it wasn't unusual.",
        "Q: It wasn't?",
        "A: No, it wasn't unusual. And they were very much in love, I was told. My father, everybody\nthought that, \u201c\u201cWhy would he marry such a young kid?\u201d But my mother was 1n love with\nhim, I heard that and I seen that.",
        "Q: So this was a very warm household.",
        "A: Very warm household, right. But we did -- our grandparents lived with us. And my father\nhad a sister who was retarded. She lived with us, too. So it was a big house, but it was a\nhappy house. My mother took care of the retarded sister, who, who,, really was never older\nthan 11, let's say. You know, mentally. And we grew up with her, too.\nAnd we had a dog, and, we were just one happy family. We never had any problems.\nHenry Alfred Kissinger",
        "Q: Did you milk the cows, too?",
        "A: I tried. It didn't help me. But what I did, we had a dog. And whenever my mother punished\nme, I would go out. The dog was never in the house, that didn't happen in Germany. Dogs\nwere kept outside, so, therefore, I went outside. If she punished me, I went outside and ate\nwith the dog.",
        "Q: And ate with dog?",
        "A: I ate with the dog. And my mother would always catch me, and she would say, \"Why are\nyou eating the dog's food?\" And I would just say, \"Well, the dog didn't want it.\" And I ate it,\nand, you know, grew up healthy. Didn't bother me a bit.",
        "Q: Was this dog a real pet for you?",
        "A: It was -- he sort of was my friend, you know. He walked after me wherever I went. And, you\nknow, in Germany where we lived, we had an outhouse. We didn't have a toilet inside, so the\ndog was right next to the outhouse. So every time we went there or stayed there a little while,\nthe dog would scratch on the door. \u201cIt's enough already, come on out.\u201d So the dog was part\nof our family, we loved him. And his name was Flock.",
        "Q: Flock?",
        "A: Uh-huh. Strange name.",
        "Q: And what about friends? Were you...",
        "A: Well, I had lots of German friends. I had little kids who played with me, and went to school\nwith me and we were -- sometimes one of my friends would go with me to synagogue, and I\nwent with her to church. My mother told me I shouldn't kneel down because that's not in my\nreligion, so I didn't. Nobody bothered, I don't even think they did kneel down. Because I was\nalways told, I remember that from way back. But, but I went to church Sundays and she went\nto synagogue on Saturdays. We were really close friends, and she's still alive. And she was\nhappy that I did that for her, and I was happy to have her. I never wanted to let her go, why\nlet her go on Saturdays and why would she let me go on Sundays, you know? But it\nchanged, it changed in 1933. It changed a lot. This particular friend didn't change too much,\nbut I had one girl which really was my idol. She was extremely intelligent, and she was a\nlittle redhead and she was very cute. And we played together, and at one point she said to\nme, \"You know, Carola, I can't play with you anymore.\" And I said, \"How come?\" She said,\n\"Because you're a Jew.\" I said, \"What is that?\" She said, \"Well, have you heard of Hitler?\" I\nsaid, \"Yes, because every morning they used to say Heil Hitler. And,, but why can't you play\nwith me anymore? Why?\" She said, \"Because my father told me that you're Jewish, and\nGentile children, Aryan kids can no longer play with the Jewish kids.\"\nAnd her father had gone to school with my mother, and they were the best of friends. And\nthat was very, very hard for an eight-year-old, you know. It felt very strange that suddenly --\nand then the whole group disappeared. Nobody would play with a Jewish child anymore. So\nthen we sort of -- to the Jewish kids, we were friendly with the Jewish kids, too. So then we\nwere all Jewish kids, and we stuck to one another.",
        "Q: When that young friend said that to you, was that the first time that you felt. . .",
        "A: Felt there was something -- I was different. And I couldn't, and I couldn't understand why I\nwas different. Well, I was asked before by someone why was I different. Did I feel any\ndifferent? You know, we did speak Hochdeutsch\u2019, which is the better German. So did that\ngirl, this Lucy, Lucy, really, she spoke Hochdeutsch. Only the farmers had a dialect, and we\nnever did have a dialect. So I felt was that the difference? No, it wasn't the difference,\nbecause the teacher spoke Hochdeutsch and so did the pastor of the village, speak\nHochdeutsch. So we were -- I was very upset that suddenly they would make such a\ndifference and make us feel like outcasts, and it got worse and worse. It was just -- that was\nonly the beginning.",
        "Q: Did it affect school right away?",
        "A: Yes. Not right away, because we were pretty good students, especially my sister was an\nexcellent student. So the teachers couldn't right away throw us out of school because we sort\nof held the school together. But there was a time where it was impossible, it was only Heil\nHitler and there were these songs which I really can't translate. But in German it was\n\u2018\u201cWenn\u2019s Judenblut vom Messer spritzt\u2019.\u201d Jewish blood runs off the knives, then we feel\nbetter. Just songs like that, and we felt very, very, very bad. We were little kids and yet when\nwe looked around and we seen the BDM\u2019, that's a circle of German girls who had these nice\noutings, we felt so why can't we be part of it? Why can't we? As a matter of fact, I remember\nat one point when I walked through the schoolyard -- we lived right next to the schoolyard --\neverybody said, \"Heil, Hitler\" like this. I did, too. What did I know? I was eight years old. So\nmy mother said to me, \"You're not supposed to do that.\" I said, \"Why not?\" She said,\n\"Haven't you been told that you are Jewish?\" I said, \"Oh, I forgot.\" So it was very hard to\ncomprehend.\nI couldn't get it together that I was suddenly Jewish and I couldn't do whatever I did before.\n* Standard German (German)\n\u00b0 When the blood of the Jews sprays from the knife (German).\n* Bund Deutscher Madel [League of German Girls] (German); branch of Hitler Youth.\nBut, they told me quickly that...",
        "Q: That must have been very frightening.",
        "A: It was very frightening, and, especially for an eight-year-old child. If you're older, you\nunderstand. But it got worse and worse, and by the age of 11, my parents decided that they\ncouldn't leave me in school anymore. Neither myself nor my sister, and they would send me\nto a Jewish school. In the meantime they had made Jewish schools all over Germany where\nonly Jewish kids went. And so, therefore, I went to Bad Nauheim, which was Bad Nauheim\nBezirkschule\u2019 in the district of the area where some of the children came by bus and some of\nthem stayed in the dorm. And I was sent into the dorm. I was very homesick, and my mother\nand father had a hard time getting me there, but once I was there I was fine. And my sister\nwent -- went,, she's a year older -- she skipping already, I don't know, in one grade here and\nthere, went straight to a teacher's seminary to Wurzburg. That was a teacher's seminary, so\nshe went there and I went to Bad Nauheim.",
        "Q: So what year, do you remember what year it was that you went?",
        "A: In 19 -- I was 11, 1936.",
        "Q: Did you, before you left for school, did you talk with your sister about what was happening\nand what was happening to her?",
        "A: Yeah, always, always. And my sister, although she's only 15 months older, she always was,\nlike, she gave me strength. I, I made believe like she was 100 years older, and I would say to\nher, \"So, what's going to happen to us?\" She says, \"Nothing. I don't know why you're\nworried. It's going to be all right. Don't worry about it. We'll live, we'll survive.\" So I figured\nif she said so, I'll probably survive and went on with that thought.",
        "Q: Did your parents tell you this? I mean...",
        "A: My father, my father was a very -- he was a German. He would say, \"I went through World\nWar I, and the Germans are really not bad people. And you're a young girl, and they're not\ngoing to kill you. Don't worry about it, you'll be fine. You'll absolutely fine. Hitler will\ndisappear one of these days, and you're going to be okay. Just hold out, don't let them make\nyou crazy. Be strong.\" And he had all these quotations from Schiller\u00ae and Goethe\u2019 and all\nkinds of things telling me that never do anything wrong. \u201cRather suffer, but don't do\nanything wrong.\u201d Which in German is, \u201cLieber Unrecht Leiden als tun.*\u201d And he left me\nwith all kinds of legacies, and I really, I, I lived through this on my life. I listened to ... he\n\u00b0 District school (German)\n\u00b0 (Johann Christoph) Friedrich von Schiller\n\u2019 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n* Better to suffer injustice than to cause it (German).\nwas a very bright man.\nAnd,, at least of everybody feels their father's superior, but he had a strong mind. And he\nkept saying that definitely we'll get through that easily, and we don't have to go to America.\nWe can stay in Germany, not to worry. So what was I supposed to do? I said \u201cokay.\u201d Little\ndid he know what was in store for him.",
        "Q: He and your family had an opportunity to go the United States?",
        "A: Well, yes. We had a -- we could have gone, but the number was very high. It was 70 or\nsomething, 700, I don't remember anymore. And, we had an aunt, you know, my father had\nthis retarded sister. And he wasn't going to let her go, just abandon her. So he said, \"Maybe I\nought to send the children,\" my sister and myself. But then he said, \"But my kids want to be\nwith me.\" And we really wanted to be with them, and he said, \"It will be okay.\" But in the\nmeantime, they took the retarded sister into a home to Berlin away from us. And my father\nwas taken to a labor camp, and well, on the 10th of November, you know, he was taken to\nBuchenwald. And my mother came to, to Bad Nauheim where I was. And my sister came to\nBad Nauheim from Wurzburg and we reunited there. And from there we just faded out and\nbeing in Bad Nauheim with all the children and we were taken out of the school to the,. . .",
        "Q: Could I interrupt fora moment...",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: ... and just go back a little bit? When you were at school and you were alone boarding was\nthe first time you were away from home.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Was that both difficult and easier because life was better for you there?",
        "A: Life was better for me school-wise, yes. And I was 11 years old, so I figured eventually I\nwould have to grow up -- be on my own, so I adjusted very well and I stayed there, and I had\nfriends and it was fine. I could have gone home. I usually went home on vacations, but, it\nwas never the same anymore because my sister wasn't there, and I stayed a few days and\nwent back to school. But it was considerably pretty normal yet.",
        "Q: So the Nazis or the Germans didn't come in and do things at the school? There was a...",
        "A: Well, the 10th of November.",
        "Q: In 1938?",
        "A: 1938. The Germans came and threw all the kids out, cut into the feather beds, and the whole\nschool was in an uproar. The little kids were crying, looking for their parents. But naturally\nthere were no parents; it was a boarding school. And, well, I was one of the older ones, there\nwere six-year-olds; we held on to them. And they marched us to the mayor's office with the\nteachers, and the teachers were frightened themselves. We thought we were going to be shot\nthere, but we weren't. We stayed there for a while, and from there we went back home. We\nwent home. In the school, and it was horror. All the feather beds and everything was on the\nfloor and all the -- it was a religious school, so the torah cloths were all torn and the books all\n-- whatever. But we remained in the school until 1939. We fixed it up again, and we stayed\nthere.",
        "Q: And the kids fixed it up? Everybody...",
        "A: The kids and the teachers and whoever helped, we all fixed it up, and we stayed another year\nuntil 1939.",
        "Q: So when these Nazis left, did you -- were the kids still very frightened? Did kids have bad\ndreams?",
        "A: Yes. The kids had bad dreams. So did the teachers. They weren't that much older, you know.\nAnd we all had bad dreams. We were afraid. What would they do with us? And, -- but life\nwent on, and we stayed till 1939 and then the school was eliminated.",
        "Q: Now, your mother and your sister came there...",
        "A: And my sister stayed in the school for another year. Since she had some education in\nWurzburg she taught first and second grade.",
        "Q: In your school?",
        "A: In my school.",
        "Q: So this must have been very good for you?",
        "A: That was good because I had my sister. My mother went back home, and I think she\neliminated everything. She -- my grandparents and her and my father moved to Frankfurt\nbecause there was no way we could stay in Nieder-ohmen because we were recognized all\nover. In Frankfurt, nobody knew us as Jews. We were just people like anybody else until we\nhad to wear the star. So we lived together with our grandparents and it was okay. And, my\nsister worked, she had to do some, also, some slave labor work in Frankfurt. I don't recall\nwhat she did, but I went to school yet because I was still young -- younger. I went to\nPhilanthropin and I took a course in medicine.\nI took a course in sewing, and I sort of was preparing myself for America. Learned how to\nspeak English. And,, all kinds of courses, and that lasted until 1941. From 1931, till 1939 till\n1941.",
        "Q: Now, you father had been take to Buchenwald after Kristallnacht\u2019?",
        "A: Yes, but he came out about four weeks later because he was the so-called Frontkampfer'\u201d\nbecause had for -- at the front, so that if you could provide papers, they let him out. So he\ncame to Frankfurt, and in Frankfurt he was taken away to a labor camp. It was someplace\naround Mecklenburg, I believe; I don't recall. And he had to do really hard work.",
        "Q: Do you remember his return from Buchenwald and what he talked about?",
        "A: I remember. He was so thin, and he was -- a few teeth were missing. I don't know whether\nthey had beat him up or something, and he never wanted to talk about it. He was afraid that\nwe would be frightened by it. And since he was such a German, he thought that couldn't\nhappen to him. He definitely didn't want to talk about 1t. And I remember in 1939 when\nGerman soldiers came back to Germany from Poland, and they used to say, \"They're taking\nthe Polish Jews and they shoot them right outside.\" And my father would say, \u201cthat guy\nnever told the truth, it's not so. I'm sure it's not.\u201d He denied it. He really denied it, he thought\nthat couldn't happen. Germans were not bad people. It was, you know, they were educated\nmostly from birth. Beethoven\u2019 t Schiller and all the whole thing, so he couldn't believe that.",
        "Q: Were you more skeptical?",
        "A: No. I listened to my father. I thought my father couldn't be wrong. Only I could be wrong. I\nwas too young anyway to think -- my sister kept saying, \"Daddy is right. Not to worry.\" So\nwe weren't worried.",
        "Q: So you're living with your grandparents .. .",
        "A: And my parents.",
        "Q: ... and your parents and your sister.",
        "A: My mother and my sister. My father was then taken away.\n\u00b0 Crystal Night (German); Night of Broken Glass.\n' Front line soldier (German)\n'' Ludwig van Beethoven",
        "Q: Taken away?",
        "A: Right. In Frankfurt. And it was bearable. We had a room and we didn't have much to eat, but\nwe had food stamps, and we got food here and there. My grandfather used to go and buy\nthings, but we were always rationed. My grandmother was always afraid that I would eat too\nmuch. Because I was always tall and heavier than the rest of the family, and she couldn't\nstand that. Whenever I ate, she said, \"It's enough.\"\nThat was a little hard for me, but she didn't mean any harm. I just took it very badly. But, in\n1941 they took 150 or 60 young girls from Frankfurt to Berlin to a labor camp, and I was\namong them. My parents remained. My mother and my grandparents and my sister remained\nin Frankfurt, but I was taken to Berlin.",
        "Q: Now, by then you were wearing a Jewish star?",
        "A: By then we were wearing -- yes. By then we were wearing a Jewish star, right.",
        "Q: And these are just young Jewish girls that they're taking?",
        "A: Young Jewish girls.",
        "Q: And...",
        "A: Not older -- we were maybe \u2018til 18. I was 15 then.",
        "Q: And how did you find out you had to go?",
        "A: Well, we got a notice...",
        "Q: In the mail?",
        "A: ... we had to be -- in the mail. And we had to be there at a certain time, and a doctor would\nexamine us, a Jewish doctor. And we were told we were going to a labor camp, which we\ndid, and we were all taken to Berlin. Now, we were -- like I was 15 years old. I didn't think\nthat was so terrible. I went with lots of friends. Of course, I had to say goodbye again to my\nparents from then I would never see them anymore, and my grandparents and I went to\nBerlin. And when, when, we came to Berlin, we were put up in an old movie house, and, it\nwas in a very good neighborhood. But it was an old movie house and they made it in little\nrooms, so we were about -- two, four, six, eight people -- eight girls together. It was livable.\nIf they would have left us alone, we could have survived there during the war. It was livable.\nSo, of course, food was scarce, but at that time they had occupied Italy. They brought\nwatermelons, and we had enough potatoes, so we made potatoes and we fried them with\nnothing. Made potato pancakes and watermelons and we got a little bread, and we got by.\nAnd we worked for the Siemens-Schuckert- Werke 1n Berlin. It was pretty hard labor,\nespecially for a 15-year-old, but...",
        "Q: What were you doing?",
        "A: We were making airplane doors. Well, I wouldn't say doors. A little, it was more or less\nwindows. We had to cut off pieces,, we put it on a -- in German, it's a trebank.\u2019\u201d I've seen\nthese things here, and I kept looking at them. I said, \"This is what I worked on.\" You had to\nput it into the machine, and then you had to put the knife really close to it.\nAnd then it would cut off a piece, make it to a certain size. And very often if you didn't do\nthat right and the thing kept falling out, you know, and would hit you. But I was always very\ncareful to do it nght, and I did okay. They paid us very little, but we had enough money to\nsupport ourselves.",
        "Q: So they did pay you?",
        "A: They would pay us a little bit, yes. But we weren't just Jewish girls, there were German\npeople living in Berlin, older people who worked there. And I was in Abteilung\u2019? 505. That\nwas really for big, fat people. And since I was strong and tall, they put me in there while the\nothers went to different places, but luckily I survived in that place. It was, 1t was bad, but the\nvoice of my father came up, \"You've got to survive. You have to be strong.\" And I tried very\nhard really. It wasn't always pleasant, but Berlin was not the worst. The worst is yet to come.",

        "Q: Okay, Carola, I wanted to ask you a few questions about Frankfurt. Did your mother work\nduring this time?",
        "A: No, she didn't. She took care of her parents, our grandparents, and, she took care of us.",
        "Q: Where was the money coming from for food...",
        "A: I don't know. I have no idea. Maybe they had a little bit, I have no idea. There was no one\nworking, and I don't know where the money came -- maybe from my grandparents. I asked\nthat question many a times.",
        "Q: Do you know if your parents sold the farm, or was it confiscated?",
        "A: Yeah, they just took it. It wasn't sold. It was confiscated, absolutely. So we didn't get any\nmoney from the farm then until later on. So there was -- I don't know. What I lived from, I\nhave no idea.",
        "Q: Do you remember when your dad went to the forced labor of the...",
        "A: I remember that, right. I remember that.",
        "Q: What was that day like?",
        "A: Well, we were afraid that we weren't going to see him anymore. And he said that he would\ncome back, not to worry. He's not going to leave us, he will come back. But I didn't see him\nanymore. My mother and my sister did, but I didn't see him anymore.",
        "Q: And how come they were able to see him?",
        "A: They took Jewish people out to labor camps. They wouldn't let anybody in there, and I\nsuppose he wrote to them here and there. But I was taken away, so I had no connections with\nmy father anymore. I would write to my mother once 1n a while, and she would write back.\nBut that was only a short while, I was taken in 1941 to Berlin, in February.\nAnd my parents were taken then altogether to Lodz in September of 1941.",
        "Q: Did you know they were taken in September?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you know that?",
        "A: They sent a letter saying we are relocating to Litzmannstadt. I still didn't know what that\nmeant. They were moved out of Frankfurt to Lodz together with my sister, that's all I knew.\nNothing else.",
        "Q: Now, the war started in 1939.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Was there a particular effect on you other than being Jewish?",
        "A: No, there was no particular effect, not on us personally. We went about our way like I was in\nschool yet and, but no, not me. I mean, I was absolutely away from everybody. You know, I\nwas all on my own. Then in Berlin, of course, I was together with other girls, and we formed\nclose ties; we really did. We had no other choice. All we had was each other, and we didn't\nknow what was going to happen. Their parents were also taken, so, we didn't know. We had\nto really stick to one another and bond.",
        "Q: Can you describe those relationships, what kinds of things you did together?",
        "A: Well, we were -- the more religious girls would eat together, you know, and I was one of\nthem. And a little bit, I think, I was an outcast because the others always thought I was a\nlittle bit too religious. I really wasn't, I was just observant. That was how I was brought up\nfrom home. But other kids really didn't care about religion, the other girls. They did\nwhatever they had to do, so I made sure not to eat meat and things like that, you know. If\nthere was meat available, I stayed away from it, I didn't -- I was very kosher.",
        "Q: Now, this is interesting, because when you talked about your childhood and when your\nfriends wouldn't talk to you anymore, you said, \"But I didn't think I was Jewish.\"",
        "A: Right. I didn't think I was, but kosher I was.",
        "Q: I see, so it was different. You had a certain set of traditions that you followed that were\nhabitual?",
        "A: Absolutely. Right. It was very much accepted in Nieder-ohmen, very much so. Because on\nPassover, we would hand out matzos to our Gentile neighbors and friends, and they in return\nwould give us eggs. And I very often went to my friend's house and they had these beautiful\nsalamis hanging in their cellar. It looked so good to me, I asked my mother many a times,\n\"Why can't I just have a sliver?\" And she said, \"It's not kosher. It comes from a pig.\" So that\nwas it, it was a no-no and I lived by the rules.",
        "Q: Now, when you're in this factory, was that harmful in any way? I mean, are you getting\nweaker because you're not eating some of the things that you weren't?",
        "A: Well, we were young, 15 years old. No, I wasn't really that weak, but I missed my parents. I\nmissed everything. But, you know, there was one thing we were young, and I think that\nreally helped. Because when you're young, you always feel that something better is going to\ncome, and it will eventually be good again. And we really didn't think of the worst, none of\nus did. We thought, \u201cEventually this will all end and we are going to go home again, and\nwe'll be free.\u201d But it didn't come to that, never did.",
        "Q: Were you praying with these young girls, as well eating together?",
        "A: I did. I prayed for myself. They didn't do much praying. But I had one girl -- two other girls\nwho were equally religious, and we did a lot of praying. But the other girls really didn't.\nThey sort of looked down on us a little bit like the frumis -- frumies'* you know. That was\ndone, but it didn't bother us a bit. It was okay.",
        "Q: Now, did sometimes difficult things happen so you had to really help each other, not simply\nsupport each other spiritually?",
        "A: Spiritually. In Berlin?",
        "Q: Yes. Did someone get sick and they needed to...",
        "A: Well, it wasn't that much that people got sick, but, you know, they were young girls and they\nwanted to have dates. They wanted to go out on a date, and maybe they did. And they wore\nthe Juden-star, the star, and they were caught. And when they were caught, they went right to\nthe gas chambers. They went right to Auschwitz where we never heard from them again. So\nthat was a big issue, and so many girls disappeared. They just felt we'll take the star off and\nnobody will even know that I'm Jewish. After all, our skin was white. So nobody would\nknow, but they were always caught, and many of the girls were taken before that time to\ncamps and never survived.",
        "Q: Now, who would they meet and where...",
        "A: It's hard to say -- it's hard to say who they met. They were recognized by somebody. Maybe\ntheir nose was too long. Maybe they were stopped by a Gestapo, who would say \u201cDu bist\neine Jiidin?\u201d\u2019\u201d and then what? To say \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d You had to have papers,\n'* Pious Jews (Yiddish)\n'\u00b0 You are a Jewess? (German)\nthat was it.",
        "Q: No, I meant boys. Where were they meeting boys?",
        "A: Oh, where did they find boys? Well, in the factory, you could find not just Jewish boys.\nThere were the men who helped us with the machinery. Every young men, young German\nmen, who sort of became interested in the Jewish girls, and if you were stupid enough, you\nwould go with them. But, otherwise, you just didn't do that.",
        "Q: So you never thought about doing that?",
        "A: Never. First of all, that wouldn't have been my thing. I was much too religious. Second of all,\nthat was something you just didn't do as a decent human being; you just wouldn't do that. So",
        "Q: Did you have some kind of a social life when you went to that, but when you were boarding\nin school?",
        "A: In Bad Nauheim?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Oh, yes. We had a wonderful life there. We had -- 1t was very good there. Really, it was\neasy. I met my husband there. He went to the same boarding school.",
        "Q: So were you boyfriend and girlfriend in that school?",
        "A: We were -- I had an eye on him. I don't know whether he had an eye on me. Like girls\nusually do, yes.",
        "Q: So you had a crush?",
        "A: I had a little bit of a crush on him. I had a little crush on the teacher, and like all girls do, that\nwas okay. But, you know, I went away, and we had different, very different roads, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Now, there seemed to have been some freedom of movement being to work in that...",
        "A: In Berlin?",
        "Q: ... 10 Berlin.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you saw your father's sister?",
        "A: Right. I, we could go out on certain days. We had a curfew, of course, you know. But we\ncould go out on Sundays if we weren't working in the factory. And I remember taking\nanother girl along. I had heard that there was an institute for retarded people, and that she\nwas brought there. So every Sunday I went with my friends to that place, and -- to meet her,\nto see her. And she was so happy when I came, and she didn't really know where she was.\nShe had her friends there, and it was ring around the rosy and whatever, and she was happy\nto see me. And I was happy that she was happy, and I went back into the labor camp, until\none day I went to see her -- wanted to see her and it was closed. Closed indefinitely, no\nmore. Somehow they had taken them all some place and suppose gassed them.",
        "Q: That must have been a horrible day.",
        "A: It was terrible, right. But I realized -- I still didn't realize that they had gassed them. I thought\nmaybe they put them someplace else. I mean, you really didn't -- maybe we were so naive\nwe really didn't think of gas chambers because we thought relocating, relocation, that was\nthe thing. Gas chambers were far from our minds. We didn't think that could happen. That\nwas only later. So when she wasn't there anymore, I was devastated, but there was nothing I\ncould do. That was it.",
        "Q: So now you're really alone in a way that you've never been before. Now, your parents are\nLodz and your sister is in Lodz?",
        "A: Right. And my aunt, well she wasn't much of a help, but she was there, you know. While I\nwas 1n Berlin, I knew she was there, and I could see her. She was someone from home, but\nthat was it. There was no, no relationship with anybody. We sort of had each other, the girls.",
        "Q: How did you deal with it? I mean, did you cry? Did you get really depressed?",
        "A: Well, we all did, you know. When we cried, we cried together. And like, you know, like in\nGerman they'll say, \u201cgeteilter schmerz ist halber schmerz,'\u00ae\u201d \u201cIf you share your pain with\nsomeone, it's half the pain.\u201d And we shared everything, everything, even the clothes we\nshared. We were really one happy bunch together. We made the best of it, but it wasn't until\nwe were in Berlin until 1943 in February, they took big transports, more than a thousand\nJews from Berlin, including us. And they told us in the labor camp that they didn't need us\nany longer. We are going to be resettled to Poland, and they're going to have Russians --\nWhite Russian, who were replacing us. But what could we do? We were going together on\n'\u00ae Shared pain is half the pain (German)\nthe transport, and we were together again, all of us, 160, 50, 40, whatever we were by then.\nSome of the girls, I must say, had gone back home to their parents and were taken with their\nparents to a camp. How this was arranged, I don't know. But, I couldn't, my parents just\ndisappeared overnight, so I couldn't have gone with them.",
        "Q: What rumors are you now hearing? I mean, you're in the factory for two years in Berlin\nwhere some information must be coming in to somebody. Are there rumors that you're\nhearing about ghettos, about killings?",
        "A: Yeah, we heard about ghettos. Never about killings. We heard about resettlements in ghettos.\nKillings, we didn't hear about. We, we kept thinking about the girls who disappeared from\nnowhere. That they did something wrong, they shouldn't have done it. But, we never thought\nthat they were actually killed. We thought maybe they had taken them into a camp\nsomeplace else, but that they were killed? Never entered my mind, anyway. So it was not\nuntil 1943 in February we were taken to -- we didn't know where we were taken.\nWe were taken to Auschwitz. We were going on the cattle -- on the train. And in the train, it\nwas horrible conditions. We were in there for quite a few days, and, people died right then\nand there. And we had one pail in the middle there -- well, it was horrible. So ...",
        "Q: Is that your worst time?",
        "A: one of -- not knowing where we were going, not knowing what they were going to do with\nus, that was really hard. But there were always a few people, older people than us, who said,\n\"It's going to be all right. You're going to be resettled and not to worry.\" We never really\nscreamed, cried, or did anything. We just took it as it came, I guess because we were young.\nAnd we said, \u201cIt's going to be all right.\u201d\u2019 One sort of did that to the other, you know, we tried\nto really calm each other down until we got the train rolled in Auschwitz in February. And\nthen we what happened, we got out in the middle of night and there was Mengele\u2019 \u2019. Of\ncourse, we didn't know who Mengele was, and there were quite a lot of other Gestapo and\nSS men and everybody around us with dogs. And they kept screaming in German, of course,\n\"Aussteigen, Aussteigen! \"'S And they formed a line, and \u201cYou go right and the other one\ngoes left.\u201d And whatever the older people left, the children to the left, and the younger\npeople to the right. And we still didn't know what was going on.",
        "Q: How big a transport was this, do you know?",
        "A: A thousand.\n' Dr. Josef Mengele\n'\u00ae Get out! (German)",
        "Q: A thousand?",
        "A: Right. From Berlin.",
        "Q: And how did you know it was Mengele?",
        "A: I didn't know it then. Later on I recognized him. I really didn't know then. And he started\nscreaming, \"You get here. You go here.\" Well, by then I was 17, so I went into the camps\nand all the rest of the people -- I mean, the older people, and the people -- the children went\nto the gas chambers. But we didn't know that. So when we got to the camps, we were first --\nthey undressed us. We were sent to the sauna, and in the sauna -- they cut our hair before\nthat. They cut our hair, and then we were tattooed. And we met in the sauna, we were all\nsitting together, not knowing each other because we had no hair and it was really -- for a\nyoung girl to suddenly have no hair whatsoever -- was a devastating experience. But it wasn't\nthe worst. So we just looked at each other and most of the time, we didn't even recognize\neach other because we looked so different.\nSo after the so-called delousing, we were given clothing. Our clothes we never seen any\nmore. So they gave us some old things. I was a tall girl and I had a blouse which went to\nhere. No hair, and unbelievably you looked like a degenerate. You looked like an idiot\ncoming out of there. And what happened to those beautiful girls, I've been asked many a\ntimes, but you were a young girl. You must have been a pretty girl. If that's done to you,\nyou're not pretty anymore. You look disgusting, and, of course, that wasn't the worst yet. The\nworst was yet to come.",
        "Q: How did they cut your hair, with what? Did they cut it with a scissors or with a razor?",
        "A: Clippers.",
        "Q: With clippers?",
        "A: Clippers and all the way down, so...",
        "Q: Did they cut your bodily hair as well?",
        "A: Yes, they did.",
        "Q: Women cut your -- was it the same person who cut the hair on your head, or did you go ina\nline?",
        "A: We went in a line, some of them did their head and some of them did the other, you know,\nbodily hairs for us. It was a line, it was very well organized like everything in Germany was\nvery well organized. But the people who did that were other inmates, you know, that were\nassigned to that particular thing. And most of them didn't speak German at all, so the only\nlanguage I spoke was German. So all, some of them spoke Polish; some of them spoke\nwhatever . . . Czechoslovakian",
        "Q: Did you -- you, obviously, then didn't speak with these women, or did you try to speak with\nthem and say, \"What's going on here?\"",
        "A: Well, you know, you know my friend, Zippy\u2019, she was around that area. She was in the\nPolitische Abteilung\u201d and I remember her coming by and saying -- she spoke German, and\nshe said, \"Don't say a word. Just do what they tell you and you'll be okay.\" And I figured she\nreally meant well with me, and I did what she said. I didn't say one word, and I told my\nfriends, \"Just let's keep still and do what they tell us to do.\" And they really didn't do us any\nharm except for someone who made a big to-do about it. I don't want my hair cut. Why\nshould you? Some of the women were married to Gentiles, and they said, \"My husband is an\nAryan. Why should you cut my hair?\" And that would get those girls who had been there for\nseveral years already extremely angry. They kept saying, \"But you are a Jew. So, therefore,\nwe have to cut your hair and shut up.\" So there was always some sort of an argument with\ncutting of the hair.",
        "Q: Did Zippy go to a number of young girls and say, \"Just be quiet\"?",
        "A: Yes, she would just go around and say, \"Be quiet. Don't say anything.\nLet them cut your hair. It's not the world's worst. It will grow back.\" And she was right, you\nknow. This is not the world's worst, this wasn't.",
        "Q: What was the tattooing like?",
        "A: The tattooing was done --, well, like any tattooing here. People are tattooed all the time. The\ntattooing was they took your skin and they took a pin, a pen, pen and they sort of stuck it in\npiece by piece and they put the number. It's a real German number I have on my arm. And\nthen this half a Winkel,\u201d' here underneath, which I never knew what it actually meant. I\nthought maybe this was part of a -- half of a Magen David. That's what I explained to myself;\nI don't think that it was now. Whatever it was, I have it.",
        "Q: Did that hurt?\n\" Zippy Tichauer\n\u201d Political division (German)\n*! Corer (German)",
        "A: Not really. Didn't hurt, no.",
        "Q: Now, were you then given a number to put on your uniform?",
        "A: Yes. Over here and we had like a cross in the back so we shouldn't be able to escape, so...",
        "Q: And who put -- who did that?",
        "A: It was old people, other inmates who were assigned to do these things. It wasn't the SS\nwomen themselves. They just stood there and supervised. They didn't do that themselves.\nThey stood and laughed and had a good time in seeing these poor Jews looking like animals.",
        "Q: Were there any men around?",
        "A: Yeah, once in a while there was a...",
        "Q: I mean, when you were being registered, in that registering process?",
        "A: There was always a few SS men standing there with the SS women, and -- but it didn't\nbother us. We really you know, we didn't look like women anymore anyway. We were not\nashamed of anything, that's what we looked like and that's what we had to deal with.",
        "Q: Were you registered the first day you came in?",
        "A: I believe I was registered the first day I came in, because, you know, the Germans are\naccurate with their registrations and their book work. So I believe I was registered, maybe I\nwasn't. I don't know.",
        "Q: Did somebody fill out a card of information? Just your number?",
        "A: I believe so. Maybe they did. If they did, I don't remember. It could have been because why\nwould they have the officers where Zippy worked, they called it the Politische~ Office. So\nmaybe they did, I do not recall it at all. It's possible.",
        "Q: So you get these strange-looking clothes, you're shaved, and you have a tattoo?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Now, what happens?",
        "A: Now, we were assigned to a block. I think it was Block 13 I was in. We were all the girls, not\nall of the girls who came at the same transport. So we were more or less together, and we\n* Political (German)\nwere put on -- so we had what we call a Koje.\u201d\nYou know what a Koje is? A Koje is like a board. There was one on the bottom; there was\none on the top, and I think there was a third one. We had no straw, we had no blankets, we\nhad nothing and it was February. They took away our clothes, but I do remember they left\nme with my shoes. And I was a kid, I didn't know -- I had shoes, very simple shoes on. I was\nin Auschwitz three days and the soles had separated from the top. So I found a rag\nsomeplace and tied them together. It was quite a few weeks I walked barefoot in February. It\nwas very cold. There was snow on the ground. I put all kinds of -- whatever I could find on\nmy feet just to stay warm. And so they did put us into the barracks. And then every morning\nwe had zahlappell** which is the roll call, and there was usually SS men or SS women that\ncame. We stood there sometimes for hours in the freezing cold, so some of the girls already\ndied right then and there because it was impossible. Couldn't take that. Food, we hardly got.\nAnd really, I mean, they were falling down left and right. So standing there -- then, one of\nthe SS men would come and make a selection, and most of the time that was Mengele. And\nhe would go to say -- he didn't like the face, he didn't like what you looked like, and he says,\n\"Come on out. Come on out. Come on out.\" So I remember that so well. You know, I was\nbrought up very religious, and the prayer you say when you die is \u201cShema Israel~\u2019,\u201d so every\ntime he came around, I would just stand there and say my prayer. And luckily I was never\ntaken. And I used to tell my friends, \"Do what I'm doing.\" I was such a religious person.\nWell, it worked for me, it didn't work for everybody.\nSo it went on for weeks and weeks. We marched out in the morning. We went to build\nbarracks out in Auschwitz, and then the SS men came with their dogs. And if they didn't like\nyou -- but who you -- liked you? You looked like an animal. They would just say, \"Go, run\nafter her. Go ahead and take the dog.\" The dog would bite you. I have a few bites on my\nlegs. And, you know, by then you were already every day you looked skinnier and skinnier.\nThere was nothing left of you anymore, and then suddenly I noticed I was getting typhoid. I\nstarted to -- couldn't control my bowel movements anymore, and I felt this is it. I'll probably\nlay down like the rest of them. By then most of the girls had already -- the first four weeks\nwere the worst, and I probably won't be able to make this. But then I remember my father\nsaid not to give in. \u201cYou've got to be strong.\u201d And at night I used to hallucinate and, you\nknow, there was no Schindler \u2019, no Schindler's list or anything. If anyone would help you, it\nwas the girl who laid next to you. She would say, \"Here, look, I give you a piece of rag to\nclean yourself off, and I'll take your bread.\" Well, I much rather gave her the bread, clean\n\u00b0\u00b0 Bunk (German)\n* Roll call count (German)\n> Hear, O Israel (Hebrew); declaration of God\u2019s unity and watchword of Jewish faith.\n\u00b0 Oskar Schindler\nmyself off, and be okay the next day. But it was horrible, I screamed for my mother, my\nfather. There was nobody. I was a young girl, I just felt somebody should listen to me. I\nreally would say the first four weeks, if you held out the first four or six weeks, you were\nokay. I think I did, I held out those weeks.",
        "Q: Okay, let's take a break.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Carola, you said that you were building barracks. So you were living in Auschwitz barrack\nnow at the time?",
        "A: Birkenau.",
        "Q: And where were you building these barracks?",
        "A: We walked out -- I don't know. We walked out, we walked in at night. Quite a distance, it\nmust have been in Oswiecim, in someplace there. And, we, you know, we carried the stones.\nIf we had sort of a jacket, we had to turn it around and we put the stones in there and carried\nthem. The buttons in the back, and that's the kind of work we did.",
        "Q: Were you put to that work very quickly within the first week of your coming?",
        "A: Yeah, right away. Right away. The first four weeks, I was doing that kind of work and that\nwas the time when I started having typhoid. I was so sick, so sick. And I went -- in\nAuschwitz, there was this so-called LagerstraBe,\u201d\u2019 the street. And there was the LagerstraBe\nwhere our barrack was, and I -- it was close to the kitchen. And I walked to the kitchen, and I\nfound some coal on the floor. And I always heard that coal will stuff you up if you eat coal.\nAnd I had a little bit of medical knowledge, not too much. Coal will stuff you up. No matter\nwhat, what could have happened? I found a piece of coal in the kitchen and I ate the coal,\nand I found a piece of lemon peel near the kitchen and I took the piece of lemon peel in my\npocket. I ate the piece of coal. And water we didn't have, but we had the snow on the ground.\nAnd I ate the snow, and I swallowed that and I got better. And every time when I felt faint,\nand I had that piece of lemon peel in my pocket for all the years I\u2019ve been in Auschwitz, and\nevery time I felt faint, I took that lemon peel. And, you know, there's always a little\nsomething coming out yet -- no matter how long you have a lemon peel in your pocket -- and\nI could smell it, and I felt like -- relieved. So the lemon peel and the coal got me out of my\ndilemma. And then one day, they were taking all the so-called fryz] erkas~* which I didn't\nknow at the time what that meant, to Auschwitz. And they needed new ones in Birkenau. I\ndidn't know what that meant, and they had selected already about six; they needed a seventh.\nAnd this girl, Sheyna was her name, stood next to me, and she said to me, \"Pick up your\narm.\" And I said, \"Now I\u2019m not -- what is a fryzjerka anyway?\" She says, \"A fryzjerka is a\nbeautician.\" And I said, \"But I'm not a beautician. I, I don't know how to do hair. I can't do\n7 Camp street (German)\n*> Hair dresser (Polish)\nthat for the SS women.\" She said, \"Oh, keep quiet. Just give them your number.\" So she took\nmy hand, and she said, \"37468, she's the seventh fryzjerka. \u201c So the girl in charge took my\nnumber down and that made me the fryzjerka, which is a beautician, but I didn't have to do\nthe SS women. All I did was cutting the hair of the people who came in the same way they\nhad done to us. Now, that was a very devastating experience, since lots of transports came in\nand lots of friends of mine came and I had to cut their hair. And I kept telling them, like\nZippy had done previously to me, \"Do what they tell you and don't make noise.\" And I did\ntell them, and their hair was cut and I did that for quiet some time. That somehow made my\nlife a little better since it was indoors. Then after a while, they replaced us again with other\ngirls.",
        "Q: About how long were you doing this?",
        "A: I don't recall how long, but I did that for a few months, for a few months.",
        "Q: Did you still live in the barrack you had been?",
        "A: The same barrack I was living in, yes.",
        "Q: Did they train you? I mean...",
        "A: No, they didn't train me, no. Well, everybody knows how to use a clipper, and you just cut\nthe hair. I really didn't do too much hair cutting. I did more of the body -- the bodily hair, you\nknow, under the arm, on the bottom part. And it worked for a while, it was okay.\nThen they replaced us again.",
        "Q: Wait, wait, wait, wait. This couldn't have been very easy for you.",
        "A: It wasn't easy, but it got me out of the Aufenarbeit,\u201d\u2019 going, marching out of the camps every\nday and building barracks.",
        "Q: Were there rules that you weren't allowed to talk to the women who came in? Do you know?",
        "A: We were mainly supervised by Kapos, women who had been there before us. Well, they\ncould have been miserable and started hitting each and every one. But whoever came and\nstarted to rebel, we would tell them, \"Don't say anything. Just have your hair cut. It's not the\nworst.\" And people -- only some people would say, \"But my husband is Aryan. Why should\nyou cut my hair?\" And then the whole thing started to explode a little bit. I watched this for\nquite some time, and it was horrible.\n*\u201d Outside work (German)",
        "Q: Did you see Zippy again there in that area?",
        "A: Zippy always worked near the sauna. She would work in the political -- she would come by,\nand she would ask questions and she would come around. And she would talk to the\nnewcomers, because Zippy speaks more than one language. My language was German,\nnothing else. And that was a bit hard, you know. Speaking -- you know, speaking German\nonly was for the other inmates like I spoke the language of our enemies, you know, of the\nNazis. So many a times, they thought \"Are you Jewish?\" I said, \"Yes, Iam.\" \"How come you\nspeak German?\" So, you know, for survival you do anything. It didn't take me long, and I\nlearned how to speak the Slovak language. I spoke it so well -- unfortunately, I don't speak it\nanymore -- that I went after the war to Czechoslovakia and they thought I was born there. So\nI learned a different language, and it got me a little further, I suppose.",
        "Q: Now, how about the other women who were cutting the hair? You knew them...",
        "A: Well, I got to know them, yeah. I got to know them. Well, this little girl, Shayna, who took\nme in and said, \"Take her number,\" I worked with her. And she spoke Yiddish only, you\nknow, and she had a little sister. They were beauticians. They were manicurists and\nbeauticians, but I was nothing. I had no idea. And I remember that was my first experience I\nhad with Yiddish. Now, Yiddish sounds pretty much like German, you know. A little bit. For\na Yiddish-speaking person, the German is like a distorted Yiddish, but for a German-\nspeaking person, Yiddish is a distorted German. So I, that's when I learned how to speak\nYiddish, too.\nSo I learned two languages in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Now, why did you decide to learn Slovakian?",
        "A: Most of the girls, like Zippy, they spoke so many languages, and they spoke Slovak, and you\nknow, it's a Slawisch - language. Once you know how to speak the Slovak language, you can\nunderstand Polish, too, so I understood a little Russian, a little Polish. I understood quite a\nbit, so it was okay. Except for Hungarian, that language I could never catch on. That was too\nmuch for me.",
        "Q: Now, you knew a young woman named Rose Farkas, who was also cutting hair.",
        "A: Yeah, Rose Farkas worked with me. She was in the same Kommando\u201d\", so called. And I\nremember her, but she had been in Auschwitz for quite some time. I was a newcomer to\n30 ;\nSlavic (German)\n*' Commando (German)\nthem, and now, I'm an old lady, but then I was the youngest of them all. And it seemed that\nall the girls, you know, they were very sweet to me. I was the little kid, the new little kid on\nthe block. So they took very good care of me. We didn't have Schindler, we didn't have\nanyone. We helped each other.",
        "Q: So how did they take care of you?",
        "A: Well, that's a long story. I'll make it as short as I can.",
        "Q: No, don't make it short. That\u2019 okay.",
        "A: Well, when I worked in the sauna, you know, I couldn't hold my stool because I had diarrhea\ncontinuously. And the Kapo of the sauna was a German woman. She was a lady of ill repute,\nso she was not very nice or very neat. And she had nasty things to say, and when she seen\nthat I was just a -- I couldn't walk anymore, and wherever I went -- I hate to say it -- but\nsomething dropped. The girls would just take a pail of water and wash it away, and she\nwould say, \"So what's wrong with that one here? She belongs to Block 25.\" Block 25 was\nthe death camp -- death block. And the girls said, \u201cNo, no, no, no, no. She is okay. Not to\nworry. She is working hard. Nothing.\" And they protected me, you know, they protected me\nfrom all sides. Why, I don't know, but I really, like I said, I was a young kid and they were\nall a little older. Zippy 1s maybe about seven years older than I am. So they felt they had to\nrachmones\u201d with me. And, of course, you know I didn't speak exactly the way they...",
        "Q: So this went on for a long time?",
        "A: It went on for a long time. You don't -- it helped. The coal, the lemon peel, that was my\nmedication, and it helped me. It helped me to survive for quite some time.",
        "Q: Did you think about going to the hospital?",
        "A: No. That was a no-no. If you went to the hospital, you stayed there because you would never\ngo out again, no matter what. So I had to, because my father had said, \"You have to survive,\nand you will survive.\"\nAnd I had that in me that, \u201cIt's going to be all right. Just don't give in to them, you're going to\nmake it.\u201d",
        "Q: So, now, they took all of you who were so-called \u201cbeauticians\u201d -- what a strange name -- and\nput you into another Kommando?\n* Mercy, compassion (Yiddish)",
        "A: I don't know whether they took all of us. I believe when the Greek transports came, like this\nRollie and Stella, they were beauticians. They took them into that Kommando, but I was out\nof the Kommando. But I went, instead of cutting hair, I went to the Bekleidungskammer, \u201d\nwhich was close by. There we cleaned the clothes. It was like a cleaning outfit. We, people\nwere getting undressed, we had to sort their stuff and then put it through machines and --\ncalled the Entlausung.\u201d* So I worked there for a while then. That also better than going\noutside and building barracks.",
        "Q: Was it warm in there during the winter?",
        "A: Well, you were near sort of an oven. It wasn't that cold. It wasn't always warm, but when you\nslept at night, you were cold in the corner. It was kind of cold, freezing. But by then, of\ncourse, once I got into the sauna, I got a pair of shoes. Not shoes, but those things you wear\nin Holland. What do you call them?",
        "Q: The clogs?",
        "A: Clogs, right.",
        "Q: Wooden shoes.",
        "A: Yeah, that was good. They lasted, so you could go through winter weather with them.",
        "Q: Did you feet get sores on them from those shoes?",
        "A: Uh-uh.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: Luckily nothing. Luckily nothing. And I walked without shoes in Auschwitz for quite some\ntime.",
        "Q: Now, how did you manage that and not get...",
        "A: I don't know. Somehow I think somebody up there was watching over me. Because when I\nlook back -- at that time, nothing phased me, I was a young kid, but when I look back and I\nthink back of all the things I experienced, I said to myself \u201csomebody up there was watching\nover me\u201d because how do you walk in Poland without shoes, in March? There were other\npeople that did the same thing, and their toes were frozen off. Quite a few.",
        "Q: And you never had frostbite?\n*\u00b0 Dressing room (German)\n* Delousing station (German)",
        "A: Never. I had bites from the dogs, but not frostbites.",
        "Q: Carola, when did you find out after you had come to Auschwitz that there were gas\nchambers and they were killing people?",
        "A: Very easily, because we worked in the sauna. The gas chambers were very close by. So we\nseen the chimney smoke, that's all we seen. We didn't see transports going in there.\nMaybe they did that at night, but we seen the chimney smoke and it was peaceful. We didn't\nhear anything, we didn't hear anybody cry. We didn't hear anybody scream. We did hear\nmusic play when the transports marched in and out to work. AuBenarbeit, so to speak, but\nyou did not hear any screaming in the gas chambers because people who went into the\ncamps -- into the gas chambers didn't know where they were going. So while I was working\nin the sauna and doing the entlausen\u2019\u2019, disinfection, they asked me to go to the crematorium\nand get some blue gas. Whether they needed that for the clothes or they needed it to wash the\npeople off to take lice away and entlausen -- I don't recall. All I recall 1s that I went, of\ncourse, not alone. There was an SS woman walking with me to the gas chambers. I was\nsupposed to get two bottles of Zyklon B\u2019\u2019, or whatever they called it. A liquid gas. And, I\nwent, and this lady went with me with her gun, of course. And I asked the\nSonderkommando\u2019\u2019, the man, to get me what I was supposed to get. So he opened the\nwrong door. He must have opened the wrong door. I just stood there, and I seen these people\npiled into the gas chambers. Not saying a word, they were all dead. They were all piled in\nthere. They couldn't even fall down because they pushed them all in there, and I just looked\nand I said, \"This is impossible.\" Of course, I had known all along that was happening, but to\nsee 1S to believe it. And then I came back to the sauna. I never told anybody. I was so\nhorrified, I didn't want other girls to feel bad and get nightmares. I had them. You see\ngrownups with children and everything, yet standing up. They were not taken out yet, and\nthey were not gassed. They were not burned yet, so quickly he closed the door. He was very\nembarrassed that he opened the wrong door, and this SS woman escorted me back into the\ncamp. And, like I said, I never told anybody until a few years ago I was interviewed by\nsomeone and then it took me a long time to even talk about it. That was the experience I had\nwith the gas chambers.",
        "Q: Did you ever tell Zippy this?\n* Delousing (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Cyclone B (German)\n*7 Special commando (German); term used for Jewish prisoners selected to work in the gas\nchambers and crematoria.",
        "A: I don't think so.",
        "Q: So you didn't even go to someone who you knew was a functionary to talk about it?",
        "A: I didn't talk to anybody about it because I don't think I told ever anybody except Nina who\ninterviewed me after the Washington Together\u201d -- Togetherness, but otherwise, I didn't tell\nanybody. But it's now not as bad to talk about it anymore. It was very hard for me to even\nopen up to see this horror.",
        "Q: Was the SS woman standing with you when he did this?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And...",
        "A: It was nothing to her, she had probably seen it a million times.",
        "Q: And she didn't care that you had seen it?",
        "A: No. Nothing. It was okay. As a matter of fact, you know, the SS women -- all the transports\ncame from Poland, from Czechoslovakia, from Greece, from Italy. Everybody brought\nbeautiful clothes and I had been working in the sauna. I had to put this stuff into the\nmachines. They used to say, \"Well, this is nothing. Just wait till the American people come.\nWhen we get the clothing of the American Jews, then we really have clothes.\" So, obviously,\nthey were very sure of themselves that the American Jews will eventually end up in the gas\nchambers, too. So that was my experience with the gas chambers in Auschwitz. , what I\nwanted to say, by that time, you know, in Auschwitz most of our girls who had come with\nme from Berlin had already died except for one. She was a young girl, she was 19; I was 17.\nBy then maybe she was 20 and I was 18. I passed -- I walked in the LagerstraBe and I seen\nher laying there, and I said to her, \"What's the matter?\" She says, \"Well, I'm going to die. I\ncan't hold out.\" But she says, \"You're a young girl. You're going to --\" She says, \"You're\ngoing to make it, ... and I want you to tell the world what they did to us.\" And I held her in\nmy arms and she died. And I said the \u201cShema\u2019\u2019,\u201d that was the right thing for me to do and I\nwalked away.\nIt was an everyday happening in Auschwitz, you just seen your friends on the street and\ndying. She was a very nice girl, and I really felt that she was going to make it, but there was\nno way. People could not endure all the stress and all the strain and no food and wintertime.\n*> American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors (Washington, DC)\n*\u201d See \u201cShema Israel.\u201d\nThat was a very, very bad experience for me. That was something that I will never forget. I\nhad known this girl from childhood on. And even today sometimes I see a woman, an older\nwoman, who -- she was very short -- and I look at her and I say, \"She probably would have\nlooked like--\" Bertel was her name -- \"she probably would have looked like that today.\" She\nwould have been an old lady by now, but at that time she was 19 years old, beautiful and\neverything. Couldn't make it, no chance. And so by then all, most of the girls from Berlin\nhad passed away, had been killed, or had been shot, or didn't want to live anymore. And we\nwere just with the girls who were there, and we again made close ties with each and every\none because everybody had one reason; that was to survive. Stick to one another and survive.\nAnd there was one thing I must say. Somebody in Auschwitz, and I think they must be from\nCzechoslovakia, maybe from Poland by the name of Carola Stern, and that person must have\ndied. And she got some sardines from the Red Cross from Switzerland, and she was no\nlonger there, so they gave it to me. This was the most fortunate thing I had, so I had about\nfour cans of sardines, and I could buy myself, you know, a piece of bread or something like\nthat. They also gave us a piece of salami, like once a week. And being that I was so\nOrthodox, I wasn't going to eat it, I exchanged it for bread. Later on I found out that I didn't\nhave to do that, I could have eaten it. But that was my religion which wouldn't allow me to\neat any unkosher food, even in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Where could you exchange? You would just exchange with another prisoner when you had\nthem?",
        "A: Uh-huh, with another person. And sometimes if you exchange it for a pair of underpants you\nknow. Anything, and sometimes, you know, whatever.",
        "Q: When you were working in the sauna -- not the sauna, when you were working with cleaning\nthe clothes...",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: ... did you ever take clothes for yourself or for other people?",
        "A: I don't really -- I never took clothes. Because the clothes was dirty, you know. You had to go\nthrough a machine first. They came out on the other end. Maybe the people who were on the\nother end could. What I did I assorted the clothes dirty, you know. Maybe I did take a thing\nor two; it's possible. I don't recall ever taking anything because by then they had given me a\nblack uniform, a black -- I had something to wear and the clogs. So I was happy with what I\nhad, I didn't really -- I got a jacket, yeah. We did organize -- they called it \u201corganization.\u201d\nWe stole a few things, let's put it that way, if we could.",
        "Q: Did you wear a babushka on your head?",
        "A: Yes. All the time because they wanted us to. They didn't want the hair to grow. But then the\nhair grew back slowly, you know. But after a week -- a month or so, they would always cut\nif off again until later when I worked in the Bekleidungskammer they didn't cut their hair\nthat much anymore. Sort of skipped it once or twice, so my hair grew back and I looked a\nlittle bit more normal than I did before.",
        "Q: How did you wash?",
        "A: Well, you had to keep yourself clean; otherwise, you had lice and whatever. So we went to\nthe toilets, whatever water kept running there, we did wash ourselves off. But the toilet\nconditions were terrible, you know, it was an awful thing. But if we got to some water or\neven during the snowy season we would take a little bit snow, and we would let it stand in\nour Schiissell*\u00ae or whatever we had. And we had some water, we kept washing ourselves.\nWell, we did not have our periods, you know. So we were not women. Obviously, they had\nput something in the food which women did not menstruate anymore. So we were easy to\nkeep ourselves clean. They did that, I forgot what they call it. Some sort of a solution they\nput in the soups to make the women sort of leaner and no desires or anything like that.",
        "Q: Did you have your period when you were working in the factory in Berlin?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And was that difficult in the factory?",
        "A: No, that wasn't difficult. We could still go out and get things and to protect ourselves. That\nwas Okay. In Auschwitz, that would have been an impossible thing.\nIt really would have been. It was very hard to keep yourself clean. If you kept yourself clean,\nyou were on top of things. It was very hard, though.",
        "Q: Were you picking lice off each other?",
        "A: Well, I didn't pick lice off myself: I, I, don't think -- I probably did have. But I remember\nlater on that I had sort of knots. Is that what you call it?",
        "Q: Knots?\n40\nBowl (German)",
        "A: The eggs of the lice in hair. No actual louse crawled around my head, but then you sort of\ncombed yourself with your fingernails, whatever, to get that stuff out. And you kept washing\nyourself and washing yourself and somewhat it went away again. Never did go away\ncompletely. We all had lice. We definitely all had lice. There was no way that we could\nescape that.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's take a break.",
        "A: Okay. We will have lunch.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: Carola, what was the next job that you had after the cleaning of the clothes?",
        "A: Well, it was sort of a side job, I would call it. They took lots of the people and somebody had\nto write it down. Because the Germans were very thorough with all their bookkeeping, and\nsince I spoke German, I was elected to write down whether one had blood type A, blood type\nB, blood type whatever. And everybody was so thin and so hungry to give blood was a\nhorrible thing, but they did. They had no other choice because that blood was sent to the\nfront, to the soldiers, Wehrmacht\". So I did, too. They took it from me, too. So I did that for\na while, that was -- that is besides when no one came for a day or so, that was my job then.\nSo, of course, people cried, they didn't want to do it, but there was no other choice. They had\nto, we were forced to. And all these survivors who looked so undernourished and ready to\ndie had to give blood.",
        "Q: And where was this done?",
        "A: It was done in the sauna in a little room, and they marched the people in. Not the newcomers,\nbut the people who had been there for a while. So they gave blood.",
        "Q: So people must have been extremely weak after that.",
        "A: They were terribly weak. Not only that, a lot of Hungarians had the good blood type, blood\ntype B, I believe is the good blood type.\nAnd they took it again and again because that was the type they wanted for their soldiers. I\nbelieve it's B, the best blood type. And they had to give it. Of course, they were weak. They\nwere weak to begin with. They got weaker after that.",
        "Q: You had typhoid, not typhus; 1s that nght?",
        "A: I had -- in German, it's typhus. In English, it's typhoid. Right.",
        "Q: Did you get sick any other time?",
        "A: Well, I was never -- I never really recuperated to the fullest. I, in later on as we were -- 1945,\nas we marched out of Auschwitz, I developed an eye infection, and my eyes were very red.\nAnd I don't know how, but somehow things always fell in place. There was this doctor who\n*! Armed forces (German)\nworked at the Revier.\u201d He seen me walking on the street, and he said to me, \"Carola, your\neyes are red. You need some drops.\" And I said, \"Oh, I didn't see a mirror. I didn't even\nknow my eyes were red.\" And he gave me drops and the drops helped me, and my eyes got\nbetter until later on, 32 years later, there was a flare-up of the eyes which I developed really\nin the camps. The doctors had examined the whole thing. It had been laying there dormant\nfor 32 years, and then it came up as iritis. And later on, it developed into glaucoma.",
        "Q: Do you remember your day off?",
        "A: I don't remember my day off. We weren't always working, because sometimes we were just\nlaying around. When there was nothing to do and we were dreaming of better times and then\nwhen the war would end and we would survive. We would be together with our parents and\npeople again. And, and, we were always cooking -- for some reason \u201csome day we will have\nfood again.\u201d When you're hungry, that's the only thing you think of. The only thing 1s food.\nAnd, we were constantly talking about food. \u201cWe will cook this\u201d and \u201cwe will cook this.\u201d\nThe most intelligent, the most -- I mean, each and every one of us was talking about food.",
        "Q: What particular food did you talk about? Did you have a particular fantasy?",
        "A: Whatever one liked best.",
        "Q: And what did you like best?",
        "A: I liked puddings. I loved puddings, and I liked cakes and things like that. So I dreamt of rice\npudding. I adored rice pudding and all this kind of stuff I didn't have in years.\nThen food didn't mean -- a particular food didn't mean too much,. We just wanted to have,\nlet's say, a loaf of bread. Just a loaf of bread and call 1t our own. And we felt that some day\nsomewhere we'll have a loaf of bread. May be.",
        "Q: Did you ever notice a difference in the food, the amount of food you got or the kind of food\nyou got? Was sometimes it better than other times?",
        "A: Well, it was never good. But in -- after we went out of Auschwitz, we went to the last camp.\nThey eliminated the salt. Obviously, they were short on salt and they sent this all to the front,\nto the soldiers. So after we had no salt, we were so skinny, it's amazing. We were so thin, it\ntook all the water and everything out of us. That was horrible. That was in the last camp.\nThat wasn't in Auschwitz.\n* Police station (German); according to interviewee, this term was used to refer to the camp\ninfirmary.",
        "Q: Were you ever able to take a shower after you first came into Auschwitz?",
        "A: Yes, I have been able to take a shower when no one was looking. We went sometimes we\nstole ourselves a shower. We went into the sauna, and somebody turned on the water, one,\ntwo, three; we were in and out.",
        "Q: Was that dangerous?",
        "A: Yeah, we made sure that no one was looking. None of the SS women was -- well, I don't\nknow how dangerous it would have been, but they probably wouldn't have liked that. They\nwanted us to be dirty. Dirty Jews.",
        "Q: Do you remember noise in the barrack or smells in the barrack?",
        "A: There were quite a bit of smells because people always died, and then they laid there for a\nlittle while until someone removed them. But when somebody died, the next took the shoes.\nThe next one took the kerchief. The next one took the -- it was like an everyday occurrence.\nIt was done every single day. That's where we got an extra jacket or something. If somebody\ndied, you took it from them, and you cried with everyone who died who was killed or didn't\nget up anymore in the morning. But life had to go on. Life and death. There was more death\nthan life, but that's how it was in Auschwitz. It was like a very quiet street when I watched\nthe movie \"Shoah.\" I seen that silence, that silence. That's how it was. It was very silent, you\ndidn't hear anything. It wasn't noisy at all, and the gas chambers were burning day and night.",
        "Q: So even in the barracks, it was quiet?",
        "A: It was quiet. Because, you know, you get to a point when you're so hungry, you have nothing\nto say to each other anymore. When you're so desperate for food and so starved for love and\nfor your family, there's very little to say.\nAbsolutely nothing. At the end, we hardly talked to each other. There was no spirit. What\ndoes a young person do? They talk about boyfriends. And we had nothing to talk about.\nThere was nothing. They had take the dignity and everything away from us. There was\nabsolutely nothing left.",
        "Q: In the beginning did you have conversations at night? Did you learn about each other's lives\nwhen you met new people?",
        "A: We always did. Yeah, we always did. They always told us what they did at home, and what\ntheir father and mother did and what a good life they had at home and we talked about it.",
        "Q: Did anybody ever sing?",
        "A: We had a sort of a Lager\u201d song. Yes, we did -- we didn't -- we heard the music, you know,\nwhen people marched in and out. And yes, there was a song in Auschwitz, too. But we really\ndidn't sing much, no. We didn't...",
        "Q: Do you remember that song?",
        "A: Yeah, I do. Very vaguely, but I do. Let me think.... It doesn't come to me at the moment, but\nI'll remember it maybe later on. Yeah.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the women's orchestra playing? They played when you went\nout to work and when you came back.",
        "A: Viennese waltzes and things like that. Good music, Beethoven and very good music, because\nthe Nazi officers, the SS, liked good music so they played it for them. And there musicians,\ngirls, yes. They had training, and sounded very good, very nice.",
        "Q: Was it helpful in some way?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: It was horrible. It was -- the gas chamber was here and the music was playing. I mean, it was\nironic, you know. It was terrible.",
        "Q: Did you know that Zippy was in the orchestra?",
        "A: No, I didn't know that. I think she played an instrument, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you have relationships with non-Jewish prisoners, as well as Jewish prisoners? Or were\nyou in the barrack with only Jews?",
        "A: Well, in the barrack in Auschwitz, I was with only Jews, but, I had, you know, Kapos, I got\ntogether with Gentiles, yes. They were prisoners, too. They were -- the one with the blue\nWinkel over the -- I can't think of the name now. Bibelforscher\u2122 -- they were Jehovah's\nWitnesses, right. And there were the black Winkel that was the prostitutes. The red Winkel\nwas the politische -- the Communists and whatever. So each and every one had a -- they\nweren't all Jewish.\n2\n43\nCamp (German)\n\u201c Biblical scholar (German); term used to refer to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\nThere were Polish Gentiles, and they were from all over. All kinds of people that we dealt\nwith, and you spoke to them, too, of course.",
        "Q: Do you remember any particular prisoners who. Were...",
        "A: A Gentile prisoner? Not really. No. Later on I remember Gypsies in the last camp. Yes, I do.\nBecause there were, -- that could read your hand, and -- do you want me to tell that story?",
        "Q: Why don't we -- well, no, go ahead, tell the story.",
        "A: Well, that was in the last camp. We were just sitting there, and it was a Sunday, I suppose.\nWe didn't do anything, we were just sitting together. The last camp I didn't work -- I worked\nin the kitchen. I was little waiter, and the Gypsies were sitting there. And they kept saying to\nus, \"Let me read your hand.\" They were Hungarians. \"Let me read your hand.\" And, you\nknow, reading your hand, telling the fortune, is not done in the Jewish tradition. We don't do\nthat, but I figured, \u201c\u201cWhat have I got to lose?\u201d And so I gave them my hand. I said, \"Go ahead\nand read it.\" So she read my hand and she said -- other girls translated for me -- she said,\n\"You're going to come of here, I want you to know, you're going to come out of here. You're\ngoing to meet a young man, someone you knew already from early childhood and you'll\nmarry him. And you're going to have a son and a daughter.\" And I said, \"You word in God's\near.\" I couldn't pay her, but that's all I could tell her. So she said, \"Okay, it's going to\nhappen.\" It did happen. I don't know, it did happen. It really did. That was a very strange\nthing, but I never forget it. I always remembered the Gypsy who gave me, told me her\nfortune -- my fortune.",
        "Q: Did you know about any underground work in Auschwitz or hear about resistance?",
        "A: Well, yes, I did at one point. That was at the first four weeks we were in Auschwitz. There\nwere two girls that were half Jewish, and they didn't want to go on. They wanted us to bury\nthem under, under the barracks, and we did. We shoveled stuff over them, and they went\nunderneath that. And when it was time to go home, Taube * -- Taube was the Aufzahler.\u201d\u00b0\nHe counted us, and there were two missing. And, my God, he put the dogs on us and\neverything. He had the dogs shovel them out. The dogs captured them and they shoveled\nthem out. They wanted to escape, go back to Germany. That was about the only thing where\nI was a witness of -- I helped them shovel in there.\nI -- we kept saying, \"Don't do that, don't do that.\" They said, \"Yes, yes, yes, yes.\" So we did.\n* Adolf Taube\n*\u00b0 Counter (German)",
        "Q: And then what happened to those two girls?",
        "A: I don't recall what happened to them. They certainly weren't treated very well, that's for sure.\nWhat happened to them, I don't remember. It was in the beginning in 1943. So, maybe they\ngot to Auschwitz the first four weeks, so I really don't remember. What happened to the girls.\nThat was a no-no.",
        "Q: Did they try to find those of you who helped, or do you know?",
        "A: No. Well, we had all kinds of things there. They didn't give us any food for a day. We\nshouldn't have done that. All kinds, we were, we had punishment there. All kinds of things,\nbut nothing major happened. Nothing major. What happened to the girls, I don't know. I\nreally don't know.",
        "Q: So you were never beaten or were you?",
        "A: I have had the dogs put on me, yeah. Beaten? Beaten, I was like everybody else. You know,\nyou passed through there, and they took the whip and they just beat everybody who passed\nthrough. But not me personally beaten. If they felt like beating the people at the zahlappells,\nthey would beat. They would just take a whip and beat. But nothing that was sort, of like a\nmorning prayer.",
        "Q: Do you ever remember very short appells as very long ones?",
        "A: No, I only remember the long appells. There was never a short appell. It could have rained,\nand it could have snowed. It could have done anything. They let us stand there until they\nwere good and ready to come out and count us. Because, I mean, the Kapo, or what they\ncalled the Stubendlteste*\u2019, the one of the barrack, they would put us together and we would\nstand there. We had to wait for the SS person to come and count us again. And they took\ntheir good old time. Could be two hours in the rain, whatever. Well, all they wanted us to do\nis die right then and there, so why hurry up? That was the master plan.",
        "Q: You know, in the men's camp, the men wore caps. And whenever they saw as SS, they were\nsupposed to take off their cap. Were there any particular rules? Did you have to stand a\ncertain distance from the SS?",
        "A: Not really, but when you spoke to them you had to address them in a certain manner. Like, in\nthe military, you know, because I had the experience later on talking to the\nObersturmfihrer\u00ae and otherwise, I never spoke to any of the SS, I really didn't. SS women,\nyes, they were there, and we didn't talk much to them really, no.\n*\u201d Room elder (German)\n** Lieutenant colonel (German)",
        "Q: Do you remember who you say, which SS women, other than. . .",
        "A: Teresa. Teresa. Well, there were other women, but I don't remember their names 1n particular\nbecause I really had no dealings. No dealings with them.",
        "Q: Did you have any occasion to go into Zippy's office in the barrack four.",
        "A: Yeah. I have been -- I've been in the politische, yeah.",
        "Q: And what was that like?",
        "A: It was -- if remember correctly, there were desks that were sort of make-believe desks, and\nthere were girls writing and doing whatever. And Zippy forever walked around with her little\ncharts and pencil and did whatever -- whatever she did, I don't really know, but I seen her\nalways hanging out there.",
        "Q: So you saw her a good deal?",
        "A: I saw her, yeah. Saw her quite often. She was an all around person in Auschwitz. She was\nvery well liked, it seemed to me.",
        "Q: Well, tell me about that a little bit, because often people talk about the Slovakian girls in very\nnegative terms.",
        "A: Yeah, I know. Well, my opinion is that when I came to Auschwitz in 1943, the Slovakian\ngirls had been there already for a year and a half, I believe. They had lost everything. Their\nsisters or brothers or whatever they had, they were already dead. They were the pioneers of\nAuschwitz, and they were treated like dirt. Like dirt. So everybody was out to live, you\nknow. We all wanted to live, and we tried very hard to make the best of it. So when the other\nso-called Zugange\u201d inmates came into Auschwitz, they may have been harsh at times. Yeah,\nI've seen that quite often. Like I said before, when someone says, \"Well, I don't get my hair\ncut because my husband is Aryan,\" and so on, they would say, \"You're just as much of a Jew\nas Iam. Who do you think you are?\" They would get nasty with words, but never -- I mean, I\nhave never experienced anything like hitting or kicking or something like that. I've heard\nsome people say that, but it was -- where I worked it wasn't like that. As a matter of fact, the\ngirls who worked with me in the sauna some of them are still alive and have been really very\ngood to me. They have called me. They live in Israel. And, as a matter of fact, one was here\nin America. She's now a widow, and she came here and she asked me whether I was happy\nwith my marriage and I said, \"Yes, I am.\" I said, \"Why would you ask me?\" She says,\n\"Because I have enough. We could both live in Israel together because I would take you with\n* New comers (German)\nme.\" I thought that was very, very nice. I said, \"No, thank you.\"",
        "Q: So your relationship with the Slovakian girls was .. .",
        "A: I cannot say anything, -- I can only say that they survived their way.\nEverybody survived their -- I can't say anything nasty about them really. They were out to\nlive and if something came across they didn't like, they would shout and they would maybe\nkick and maybe hit. I personally haven't seen it, but I have heard from plenty of people who\nsaid they were nasty. They weren't nice. But look, I was not their kind; I was a German Jew,\nand maybe I was young, I don't know. Maybe they felt I was a child, they were awfully nice\nto me. That's all I can say. And Zippy was exceptionally nice. Very, very nice.",
        "Q: Did a lot of people know her in the camp?",
        "A: I think everybody knew her. Yeah. I asked some of my friends, \"Did you know Zippy?\" \"Oh,\nthe dark-haired girl? Sure, I knew her.\" Of course, she was always around. She was running\naround. Everybody knew Zippy, mostly everybody.",
        "Q: Tell me, you were talking about how close the girls were in your barrack. Did you have a\nparticular small -- you couldn't be close friends with 500 people in your barrack, right?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you each have small groups with you when you were close?",
        "A: Right, right. Mostly with the girls who worked together, we were close with one another.\nAnd we helped each other with food, you know, and some of the girls smoked, which I didn't\ndo. But somehow, somehow they got cigarettes into the camps. How they got them, I don't\nknow. And it was a very close relationship with one another. Everybody was trying to help\none another without having a Schindler hanging on us, you know. We did for each other\nwhatever we could do to survive.",
        "Q: Were there ever fights that developed between groups, or did people stick within their own\ngroup pretty much?",
        "A: You mean...",
        "Q: Arguments with...",
        "A: Slovaks with them and Polish with them? I didn't see it, no. I seen two sisters fighting with\none another, and that was my first experience with the Yiddish language. And I couldn't\nbelieve it, like, they were very good with each other. They were really very sweet people.\nThey were beauticians, and one said to the other, \"You, you zolst vaksen vi a tsibele mit kop\nin der erd.\"\"\u201d Which I translated that in German. I was horrified, that's when I learned to\nspeak Yiddish. That means, \u201cYou should grow an onion with your head in the earth.\u201d Oh,\nmy God. That was a curse if you ever heard one. So I spoke to her and I said, \"Why would\nyou say that?\" \u201cBecause she did such stupid things.\u201d I don't know what she did, but there\nwere two sisters, so it couldn't have been all that bad. But things like that came up, you\nknow, where two sisters would fight with one another.\nWe were only human, you know, no matter what the situation.",
        "Q: Do you remember men prisoners coming into the camp and working?",
        "A: Yeah, there were men coming 1n, right, but not too many. There were people coming in. , we\ndidn't have that much of a connection with the men. Some girls had more than others, but, I\nmet a very nice person who later on helped me with lots of things. And, -- but there was not\nwhat you call a love affair going on in Auschwitz, but men were in there.",
        "Q: Did he help you in Auschwitz?",
        "A: He helped insofar if I tell the story now, you know. When the transports from Lodz came\ninto Auschwitz, I thought -- that was in June -- no, that was in August 1944, I thought that\nmy parents would be still alive. And I said to myself, \u201cNothing can happen to me anymore.\nIf I see the Obersturmfthrer\u201d -- and I forgot his name \u2014 \u201cI would go to him and I'll ask him if\nhe can bring my parents into the camp, provided they are still living.\u201d So as I walked on the\nstreet in Auschwitz, I see this Obersturmfthrer walking, and I went over to him. And then --\nwe were talking about how do you address an officer -- I went over to him, clicked my heels,\nand said, \"Herr Obersturmfthrer, sieben und dreising vier acht und sechzig, meldet sich.\"\u201d!\nWhich means \"37468 makes herself known.\" He says, \"What do you want?\" with a very\nstern voice. And he said, \"And how come you speak German?\" I said, \"I'm from Frankfurt,\"\nwhich I really wasn't, but Nieder-ohmen, nobody would have ever known. I said, \"Well, I\nwas born in Germany, and I wanted to ask you something. Do you go to the ramp to get the\npeople from the Lodzer ghetto?\" He said, \"Yah, yah.\" \u201cYes,\u201d he says, \"why would that\ninterest you?\" I said, \"Because my parents have been in the L\u00e9dzer ghetto since 1941, and\nsince the transports are coming now into Auschwitz, I would like to ask you if it's okay with\nyou, sir, to bring my parents into the camp. I'm here two years, and if that's possible, please\ndo that.\" So he looked at me like I was nuts, like chutzpa of a young girl. And he said, \"Your\nparents, where are they?\"\n*\u00b0 should grow like an onion with your head in the ground (Yiddish).\n>! Mr. Lieutenant Colonel, 37468 reporting (German).\nI said, \"Well, in Litzmannstadt.\" He said, \"Well, no, you can't go. But if you know of a man\nwho can -- if you know of a man, he can go.\" So I knew this man by the name of Bumeck\nStern, same name as mine. And I knew him, and I said, \"Yes, I do, and if the officer allows\nme to, I will get him.\" And he took this young man to the ramp and this Bumak called out\nthe names of my parents and my sister, and they weren't there anymore. There was no, no\nresponse. So he came back into the camp. Occasionally, he would come into the camp. He\nwasn't in my camp, you know, and he said, \"There was no response. I don't think your sister,\nnor your parents are alive.\" So I had to deal with that, I figured \u201cthat's it.\u201d And then\ntransports still came in...",
        "Q: We have to change the tape. I'm sorry. So we'll start right there.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: You know, he was the Obersturmfthrer who was killed together with Grese.\u201d\u201d When I see\nhim together on the movies once, I recognized him. I don't recall. Zippy would know his\nname. Kramer,\u201d I believe.",
        "Q: Kramer?",
        "A: Kramer, I thought. I don't remember.",
        "Q: All right. So Mr. Stern doesn't find. . .",
        "A: My parents.",
        "Q: ... your parents or your sister?",
        "A: Doesn't find anybody. But I -- are we on?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I, I, didn't give up. I thought maybe the next transport. We didn't go to every transport,\nmaybe the next transport. So I, I didn't give up. And in July -- in August 1944, another big\ntransport came from Lodz, Litzmannstadt and I walked through the sauna thinking that if my\nmother -- my father wouldn't have been there anyway -- and my sister would be there, I\nwould just see them. My mother at that time was still a young woman. Maybe she was 41, 42\nyears old, and she was tiny. She looked tiny. And I walked through the aisles where people\nthe came in and their head -- their hair was already shaven, I think so. They already had --\nno, they didn't have a number on their arm yet. They were about to be bathed or whatever,\nshowered. And as I walked through the rows, through the aisle there, I hear a tiny voice say,\n\"Carola.\" And I turned around. It was my sister. And the reason she recognized me, it's a\nvery interesting story. When I as a child, I had a way of bending my arm completely back,\nand I walked like this.\nShe knows, I really don't know. She seen a woman walking, a girl walking with the arm like\nthat, and she said to her -- a girl was standing next to her, \"This is my sister.\" She says,\n\"What are you talking about? This couldn't be your sister.\" \"I noticed the arm,\" she said.\nAnd, and when I turned around after she called, \"Carola,\" it was my sister. And we hugged\n** Irma Grese\n> Josef Kramer\nand I wanted to know what happened to my parents, and she said they were all dead. And\nthat's where Grese was, Grese, \u201cthe Beast of Bergen-Belsen.\u201d She witnessed this thing, she\nseen me speaking to my sister and hugging my sister. And she stood there and cried.\nSomething nobody had ever seen before, and then she said to me, \"Carola,\" she heard my\nsister call \"Carola\"; otherwise, she wouldn't have known. She said, \"You don't have to worry.\nYour sister is going to stay with you now.\" And we hugged again, at least we are together.\nAnd whatever happens, we are together. And she said, \"Okay, there is nothing to worry\nabout. Your sister is going to be with you.\" So I was trying to hold on to my sister, but she\nhad to go through all kinds of different routines. Having, being tattooed. She was tattooed on\nthe inside because I felt that she didn't have to have -- in case she would survive, she has a\ntiny little tattoo. And I thought we would be together, but 1t was just a false promise. They\nsent her to a different camp, and I didn't know where she went. And once in a while, one of\nmy friends who went around -- my friend, Claire,, one of the Frankfurt girls, she would go to\nthe camp where she was in. And she would come back, and she says, \"Your sister is still\nalive. Your sister 1s still alive.\" She was in a different camp, and, I would hear from her once\nin a while. \"Not to worry, I'm still living.\" And I had hoped that maybe, you know, maybe\nthe Russians would come and we would, we would be free again, and we would get together.\nBut there was little hope, very little hope that we would be together. So it went on,, the\nmarch that was in 1944 in, in August. 1945 in January, the big march from Auschwitz\nstarted, and I didn't know where my sister was. I didn't know what was happening. She was\nalready so tiny and so skinny, I was afraid that she, she would be killed. She would have\nbeen killed already then. So we marched out of Auschwitz day and night, and late night and\nday.\nAnd we were in cattle cars and we went to Ravensbriick. And in Ravensbriick we stayed\nfour weeks, and I had no -- no sight of my sister. I didn't know where she was. We marched\nout of Ravensbriick, and from Ravensbriick we went supposedly to Malchow. We did go to\nMalchow, there was another march from Ravensbriick to Malchow day and night, day and\nnight. And I was already so weak, and we all were. One helped me on one side, the other on\nthe other side, and we slept walking. And that's how we went on, and whoever didn't do it\nlay down and they shot them. They didn't give them any chance; they shot the girls just night\nthen and there. So at one point I had to go to the bathroom. I didn't know what to do. And I\nwent out of my line and there was no bathroom, but there was barn. So I went into the barn. I\nsaid to the girls, \"I have to go to the bathroom, it's impossible.\" I went to the barn, I walked\ninto barn. My sister walked out of the barn. And so I said, \"Now, you're not going to be out\nof my sight anymore. You're going to be with me.\" And we did cling to each and she walked\nwith me. And everybody thought she was my little sister because she's small. And we stayed\ntogether from that day on \u2018til we were in Malchow, we stayed together. We were never\nseparated anymore. So that was one good thing that I had to the bathroom. That was a very\nunusual incident. So from the march on, we marched into Malchow. That was the camp\nwhere we hardly got any salt in anything. But I had a chance to work in their kitchen, and in\nthe kitchen what I did there is I did heat the kettles the to make the fire underneath, you\nknow. So what we really -- what the girls cooked there was water, potato peels, and a little\nbit of farina. Not farina, oatmeal. And that made sort of a soup, but it was better than\nnothing. So at least I had a little soup I could give my sister and my friends, Claire, who was\nwith me and Martha. Two of the girls from Frankfurt survived with me. We were together,\nand I had a chance to give them a little extra soup. I added a little hot water and it was good.\nBut we got thinner and thinner every day because they took away the salt. But that's where\nwe laid around, and that's where we talked to the Gypsies and we talked about food and\ntalked about better times which we felt we will never see. And across from us was a camp\nwith English prisoners, and they looked just as bad as we did.\nIt was just across from the camp we were in. They were also laying around, like, you know,\nlike, like dead animals. You know, when you go to a zoo and sometimes and those animals\nlook like tranquilized, that's what we all looked like. We were just either waiting to die or\nbeing liberated. Something had to happen to us, we couldn't go on anymore. And then that\nwas in February, and we talked about that maybe we're getting liberated. Maybe the\nRussians were coming closer, but we had no newspaper. Nobody knew anything. All of a\nsudden at the beginning of May, the Nazis, the SS came running in and they kept screaming,\n\"Get out of here you dirty Jews. Get out of here. Let's go. Walk.\" Now, we figured \u201cwhere\nare we walking now?\u201c We could hardly move anymore. They walked us into the woods. We\nwere so sure that in the woods they were going to shoot us. Because it was coming closer,\nthe war was getting -- coming to an end, we felt. And why in the woods? So they marched us\ninto the woods, and all of a sudden in the woods -- it was, I think it was May the 3rd, or was\nit -- maybe it was a different -- maybe May the 8th. I think it was May the 3rd. They all\ndisappeared, there were no Nazi uniforms. They were either they had their private uniform,\ntheir clothes in a package. The SS men disappeared; there were none. And all of a sudden we\nsee a tank with three young American soldiers screaming from the top of their lungs, \"You\nguys are free. Hitler 1s dead. You're free, you're free.\" And they had -- I remember they had\nchocolate. There was a quite a few of us. They had chocolate and cigarettes, and they threw\nit out of the tank, and they threw it down for us. It wasn't enough for all of us, and we -- my\nsister looked at me and said, \"Did you hear that? We're free.\" I said, \"Yes, but where are we\ngoing to be?\" We were free, we were happy, but no place to go. But, we had more than other\npeople because we had each other. So while we were sitting around in the woods, we all got\ntogether and, \u201cWe got to do something. Where are we going? We're not going to go back to\nGermany.\u201d So one of the girls, Slovak girls, said, \"I lost two sisters in Auschwitz. I'm not\ngoing home alone.\nYou two girls are going with me.\" So we traveled from Malchow to Czechoslovakia, my\nsister and I. And we came there, and to our surprise her parents were still there. Her little\nbrother was there, and they greeted us with open arms. For the first time we seen parents\nagain and people who were good to us. Gave us clothes, gave us food, and it was like such a\nrelief. It was unbelievable. We stayed there four weeks, and they fed us. And, of course, we\nhad only one wish, to come to the United States. So no matter they did, my sister and I\nlooked at each other and I, I remember my father, my mother had told me that I should\nremember an address in New York City. It was \u201c648 184th Street in New York City;\u201d that\nwas my aunt's address. And I said to my sister, \"You know, I know Tante Anna's address.\"\nAnd she said, \"No, you don't.\" I said, \"Yes, I do.\" I said, \"If I get only to that address, then\nwe'll be fine.\" Well, there no one -- you know, you couldn't do anything. I mean, we went in\nthe nighttime, early in the morning we went over the border from Czechoslovakia to Austria.\nAnd the border was like a train -- what do you call the train, what the train goes on?",
        "Q: Train track?",
        "A: A train track. And on one side the Russians stood, and they wanted to shoot when they seen\ntwo little girls, two young girls coming there. So I said to them -- I knew a little bit Russian, I\nsaid I was a Gypsy and I looked like one. My hair had grown by then, and it was long and a\ncomb I didn't have. And I said I was Gypsy -- and it was pitch black because I was a blonde\nbefore. \"My father lives in Austria, and we want to go to Austria.\" Would they let us\nthrough? They said no, they had to shoot us. And we said, \"No, no, no. We can't be shot. We\nhave to get through here and just close your eyes. Turn around. Let us go.\" So they said,\n\"Okay, close your eyes.\" And we closed our eyes. \"Go right through, but when you get over\nthe border there will be the Americans. They're going to be shooting at you.\" Well, there was\nno American shooting at us. The Americans were fast asleep, it was five o'clock in the\nmorming. And we got into Austria. Once we were in Austria, we went to the train station. We\nfigured that was the right thing to do. And there we seen other survivors. Why would we\nknow that they're survivors? They looked like us. They had not much clothes, and they said\nto us, \"You, you must be\" -- at that time they were called \u201cKZ ler,\u201d \u201cconcentration camp,\"\nyou know.\nAnd we said, \"Yes, we are.\" And they said, \"We'll take you to a DP camp.\" So they took us\nto a DP camp, and we lived in Austria until we were ready to come to America, in Gmunden,\nin Kammer-Schorfling. And through the help of the American soldiers which we met in\nAustria, they were stationed in Austria, we wrote to my aunt. And my aunt got the letter, and\nshe was overwhelmed that we were alive, but, of course, everyone else had died. My\ngrandparents and whatever. And she sent us food and she sent us clothing, and we were\nsaved. We came to America in 1946 in July. It was a year and three months after the\nliberation, which was good. That\u2019s where -- and after I was here for a little while, my aunt\nthought it would be wise to put it in the newspaper. Tell everybody that we are alive, but\nthere was like the German Jewish newspaper called the Aufbau\u2019. She, she put it in there, and\nmy husband read it and he came to visit me. And that's when we later on got married. So the\n\"4 Konzentrationslager [concentration camp] (German)\n\u00bb\u00b0 Reconstruction (German); popular periodical of the German-Jewish community in America.\nGypsy was right, I married the guy I knew from way back when, and I had a son and a\ndaughter. And now I have five grandchildren, and I have a lovely daughter-in-law and a\nlovely son-in-law. And I have my own family, thank God. That's something I never would\nhave dreamt of, something I thought it would never, so I marched into Auschwitz and I was\none of the lucky ones who marched out. Not many did. ... Now, my friend, Martha, survived,\nand she lives here partly. And the other one lives in Queens, and Zippy lives in Manhattan.\nAnd I have the two other friends in Israel, and that's about it.",
        "Q: So you maintained Lagerschwesters \u00b0?",
        "A: Yes, we do. We call each other once every so often. Now, distances are pretty far, but we do\nspeak to one another. We call each other and we try to keep up the friendship.",
        "Q: Are those some of your closest friendships, the ones with the people you were in Auschwitz\n-- with whom you were in Auschwitz?",
        "A: Yeah. They are my closest friends. You know, like you said \u201cLagerschwesters\u201d -- besides\nmy sister, Martha is like a sister to me, Claire is like a sister to me.\nWe, we don't see each other all that often, but we call each other and we get together to\nweddings and Bar Mitzvahs, whatever is to celebrate. We, we kept that friendship.",
        "Q: Do you talk about Auschwitz very much with each other?",
        "A: Not really, no. We really don't. Once 1n a while, 1f someone asks us, we bring up the subject\nbut, we try not to. But I remember one incident I had and this was also friend who worked in\nthe sauna with me, a Czechoslovakian girl. We had a bakery in Washington Heights, and she\ncame in one day. And she didn't know me, but I recognized her. And she asked me for a loaf\nof bread, and I looked at her, and I said, \"B6zsi\" So she said to me, \"Could I have a loaf of\nbread, please?\" And I said, \" Bozsi, you can have all the bread in the world. I have all the\nbread you want.\" And she looked at me, and she said, \"Am I supposed to know you?\" And I\nsaid, \"Yes, you know me quite well. I'm Carola.\" And she says, \"Really? I can have all that\nbread?\" That's something we only wanted, one loaf of bread and call it our own.",
        "Q: Could we take a break? You decided to leave Czechoslovakia in spite of this warm and\nloving family because you really wanted to get to the United States?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When you came to the DP camp, what was it like there? I mean, did they give you help with\n\u00b0\u00b0 Camp sisters (German)\nthings, other than with the letter?",
        "A: No, they gave us help. As a matter of fact, we got a uniform because we didn't have decent\nclothes really. We got a uniform like the American soldiers and on it here, it had the sign DP,\ndisplaced persons. So we, we -- the Germans thought we were Americans, I guess, except we\ndidn't speak the language. We were well taken care of there. They gave us food and\neverything. And, of course, we made connections. We met one soldier who came from\nChicago who was originally from Germany, and he had been in the army. A very -- one very\ninteresting story, I forgot to tell you that. And we were sitting in the -- what is 1t? They called\nthe clubs PX, PX clubs, right? We were sitting there in the nightclub in Austria with this\nparticular young man. I had met him in the synagogue on a Friday night, and he said that I\nwas the first German Jew he had met. All were Polish Jews, and where did I come from. So I\ntold him and we talked to each other, and he said he will get in touch with my relatives and\ntell them that I'm living, my sister and me.\nWhich was very nice, and he offered to take us, my sister and me, to the club and there you\ncould have something to eat and something to drink. And you could dance a little bit, and\nsomething we didn't have in years. And all of a sudden I'm sitting in the club, and I see this\nsoldier sitting there. And I look at this young soldier I was with and I said, \"You know, I\nknow this guy.\" So he looked \u2014 he says, \"Where would you know this guy from?\" I said,\n\"That soldier went to school with me in Germany in Bad Nauheim.\" He says, \"Are you\nkidding me?\" \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, \"I'll ask him.\" So he's sitting there and he calls, you know, he\nsays to him, \"Hey, listen, listen.\" And I said to him, \"But his name isn't \u2018Listen.\u2019 His name is\nMax Bettman.\" So he said -- I didn't know the language that well. So he said, \"Is your name\nMax Bettman?\" And he said, \"Yes.\" And he said, \"Do you know this lady?\" And he looked\nat me and said, \"No.\" I looked at him and I says, \"I'm Carola,\" and he says, \"Oh, no.\" He\ncouldn't believe it, that he went to school with me, and his father was the principal of the\nschool. And he also helped to bring us to the United States, his father, yeah. And only about\nthree years ago we had a reunion where I invited all the kids who survived from Bad\nNauheim, and he was there, Max Bettman. He didn't remember that I said, \"This is Max\nBettman,\" he didn't, you know. He had forgotten. But I, the funniest part was that when I\nsaid, \"Don't call him Listen. His name is Max Bettman.\"",
        "Q: What did you do during the days? Was there vocational training? Did they teach you\nEnglish--?",
        "A: After the war? After -- in Austria?",
        "Q: In the DP camp, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I did work -- since my first love always has been nursing, and I had a little training in\nGermany in Berlin, while I was in camp I had been sick quite often. And while I was in the\nBerlin and I had an ear infection, they always kept me a little longer in the hospital because\nthey knew that my first love was nursing. So I stayed there and took the temperatures of\npeople and they gave me uniform, whatever. And, when I was liberated, I worked in an\nArmy, American Army hospital for a little while. Not for too long, but for a few days. I just\nwanted to -- it was hard because I didn't speak the language, and they kept calling me\n\u2018Fraulein,\u2019 and I didn't want to be called \u201cFraulein.\u201d That's all the Americans knew, they,\nyou know, heard by one thing or the other.\nBut, I could take temperatures then, too, and pulse, then take the blood pressure and that was\nokay.",
        "Q: And what was your sister doing?",
        "A: My sister also worked a little bit. Yeah, she, she met an American soldier, and I think what\nshe did -- he was a dentist. She worked a little bit in a dental office or something. If I'm not\nmistaken, I think that's what she did. But for a little while because we only stayed there a\nyear and went to America. So we weren't too long in Austria, but we recuperated. And\nAustria 1s a beautiful country, really nice, and we regained our strength and it was good. It\nwas nice.",
        "Q: How long did it take you to regain you to regain your physical strength, do you think?",
        "A: Maybe two, three months. You know, because we were young. You know, we were 20; 19,\n20, whatever. We were pretty young, so it doesn't take too long. We got food. It took us a\nwhile to adjust. I remember I was quite sick. Something went wrong with my intestines, I\nhad very often terrible cramps. Because you had to really get used to food again; we had no\nfood whatsoever. And if you ate anything fatty, the gallbladder acted up, so it was quite\nhectic for me to get used to. But the minute I sat my foot on an American boat to come to\nAmerica, I never had another attack of pain. It may be psychological. The minute I entered --\non the boat, everybody was sick. Everybody was throwing up, that was a natural thing. But I\nnever had another gallbladder attack. And I was examined in Austria. For the gallbladder had\nbent, or was out of shape, or something like that. So somehow I felt I was safe, on safe\nground, in coming to America.",
        "Q: Did you find it difficult to be in Austria at all?",
        "A: I didn't find it difficult. The only difficulty I had, I remember going to the movies with the\nAmerican soldiers, and I heard a woman say, \u201cDie Juden machen sich wieder.\"\u201d\u2019 \u201cThe Jews\nmake themselves known again.\" You know, that was my experience in Austria, so that was\nright after the war. There was people who were very antisemitic. I'm sure today 1t wouldn't\n>\u2019 The Jews are making themselves again (German).\nbe like that anymore, but at that time they noticed -- well, it wasn't written all over us that we\nwere Jews, but, they recognized it. Somehow they recognized this. It was so instilled in them\nto get rid of the Jews that they had no other way but act up on it. Not to look at the Jews and\ndestroy them any which way. We were like, like vermin, no-good people.",
        "Q: Did you date when you were in the DP camp? Did you meet...",
        "A: Did I date in the DP camp? , yes, I did. I think I did. Yeah. I had met my friend again,\nBumak. He came to the -- he was in -- I don't remember where he was. He came and I\nvisited. He visited a few times, and well, there were young American soldiers and there was\na little dating going on. Most of the girls found their husband right then and there, you know.\nGot married with them. I didn't, I wanted to go to America.",
        "Q: Let's take a break and change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "A: Okay. Where were we?",
        "Q: We were -- you obeyed the prediction of the Gypsy and you got married. What year did you\nget married?",
        "A: 1950.",
        "Q: So when did you meet your husband? Soon after, within a few...",
        "A: '46. Right. He came to visit. And well, he had been a friend of mine in at school in Bad\nNauheim, but we didn't want to get married. I mean we were just good friends, and thing\nwere very lonely for me when I came to America, you know. He had been in the Army and\nhe spoke the language, and I sort of spoke it okay. And he was very good, and he -- I had\ntold him my whole story. He always wanted to know more and more. He was very warm\nbecause in the beginning it was very hard for me. First of all, I didn't know the language too\nwell. Second of all, when you rode in the subway and it was in the summertime and you\nwere exposed, a number of people would walk away from you and say, \"What in the world 1s\nthat? She has a number on her arm.\" There weren't too many of us at that time in 1946, and I\nfelt very isolated, very lonely. And if you wanted to tell actually what happened to you,\npeople used to say, \"Don't tell me that. I won't sleep tonight. I don't want to hear your story.\"\nI mean I didn't tell people on subways, but my own relatives -- they were awfully nice to me,\nthey were really good. But they didn't want to hear our stories because they were getting on\nin years, and they didn't really want to be bothered. My aunt, I told the story, and then, \u201cIt's\nenough. I won't sleep tonight.\u201d So, therefore, no one did anything. Of course, we were not\nAmerican citizens. We couldn't afford a psychiatrist or anything like that.\nWe were just -- we were just people who had to get into the mainstream of life, you know,\nand we tried very hard. We didn't -- German wasn't spoken in America because the war had\nended. If you spoke German, they looked at you like you were a Nazi. So we had to speak\nthe language which was good, I suppose. And we got together with our own people, people\nwho were in camps. And very often I heard from people who had come here previously, I\nheard them say, \"Well, these people who were in camps, they behave awfully strange.\" And\nI'm a sensitive person, I didn't like to hear that. We did behave awfully strange, but nobody\ntook in consideration what we had actually gone through. So it got to a point where we sort\nof separated ourselves from everyone, and we said -- we got together on social occasions,\nonly the survivors, the ones who survived. But we went to work and we started a new life,\nand we got into the mainstream. And I went, -- I knew how to sew which I had learned in\nFrankfurt. I went into the factory and I made piecework, worked in a blouse factory. And it\nwas in 1946, 7, I made $80 a week, which was a fortune. And everyone around me hated me\nbecause at that time we were piece -- they were pieceworkers, and if you worked too fast you\nruined the prices for the other people. I didn't know that. I did it as fast as I could because I\nwanted to make money in the worst way. So that was pretty tough, but I made it. I mean I\nhad an average of $60, which was pretty nice in 1946 and seven when really people didn't\nmake too much money. And then I paid the money to my uncle and aunt who let me stay\nthere. You know, and my aunt cooked for me, and I lived there. And it was very cozy and\nvery nice, and then my husband would come and take me out for dinner. My husband, he\nwasn't -- he was just a boyfriend -- would take me to the movies and things like that. And\nfrom then on, life got a lot easier for me.",
        "Q: Did you go to school at all? Were you able to?",
        "A: After the war?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I didn't really. The only schooling I had was going to a parent's class when I pregnant with\nmy son to learn how to be a mother. That was also not easy. You see, when you're young and\nyou don't have a mother and don't have a father, and people sort of -- you had to do it all on\nyour own. But we did it, we really worked hard.\nWe helped one another. \u201cYou do it this way, I do it that way. You bathe the baby.\u201d I took the\nmother's class -- yeah, that was the only schooling I had because I had to make a living; I had\nto work.",
        "Q: Were you -- of the two sisters, did you get pregnant first? Or did your sister get pregnant?",
        "A: My sister got pregnant and she lost the first baby. I was really the one who had the first. My\nson was the firstborn.",
        "Q: And she helped you, as well?",
        "A: My sister lived in Baltimore, so she couldn't really help too much. They separated us, which\nwe didn't really like. But my sister went to college again in business college in Baltimore.\nSome other relatives of ours lived in Baltimore, and so she stayed there and she met her\nhusband there. So it was all for the better. She had hers in Baltimore, and she still lives in\nBaltimore again. She ended up in Baltimore.",
        "Q: Tell me something, Carola. You lived under the Nazis from the age of eight to the age of 20.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: I don't know if it's the most formative years, but 1t certainly 1s an enormously significant part\nof your life. How do you understand your adjustment? Your coming back to life after all of\nthis happening to you?",
        "A: You know, there is such a thing, I guess it's called a \u201csurvivor.\u201d You just do it, you know.\nYou don't think about, you just do it. We had, we had such a strong will to survive in the\ncamps. When we -- once we were liberated, it was a piece of cake, you know, and you don't\nthink about it too much. You just go ahead and do it. Don't talk about it and do it. But when I\nthink back now -- I'm an old lady, and I think back at the time, the hard times we had, I\nsometimes don't understand how I survived it and how I did it. And how I -- later on we had\nthe bakery and I worked there, and it was all completely strange to me, bakery and whatever,\nbut I did it. And whatever I did, thank God, I was pretty good at it, so they tell me. So, at\nleast I know some through college, and my daughter or whatever, it was hard work to do all\nthat. And we wanted -- they denied us a free education in Germany. Maybe I could have\ngone to nursing school, but I didn't have the means and have the money, and so I didn't. But I\nwanted my children to have the education that everyone deserved, so we worked, both my\nhusband and I, we worked very hard to get our son through law school and the whole thing,\nyou know. So you just, I would say, get up and do it. Don't think back what has happened,\ndon't have pity.\nDon't look, look in the past, look 1n future.",
        "Q: Is that what you learned from all this?",
        "A: That's what I learned from it. And the other day my, my son was -- since we talked about tt,\nmy son was to make to speech how it was living with a mother who's a survivor. And, you\nknow, come to think of it, he said the same thing. He said, \"She didn't look back and she\ndidn't live in the past. She lived in the present, and she lives in the future.\" And, we never\ndiscussed the Holocaust in our house. We didn't cry -- if I cried, I cried on my own. I never\nshowed my kids that I was a poor Holocaust survivor. They never knew about that, I used to\npick him up when he was a baby and I used to hold him. And I used to say, \"They're never\ngoing to take you away from me,\" you know. And I really thought I had created something\nhere. You know I wanted to really hold onto him, and that he didn't know. I only knew that\nhe was so dear to me. Once I had this little boy in my arms, I thought the world belonged to\nme. And then another little girl, it was just wonderful. But I went on with life and didn't look\nback and I think I accomplished, after all this horror, I accomplished what I wanted to\naccomplish. Not quite, but I'm not finished yet. And like I listen and read the stories and I\nhear these kids saying -- of course, they're right -- they keep saying, \"We have to tell the\nstory because soon the survivors will be dead.\" So the kids who go through the March of the\nLiving say that, \u201cWe have to tell the story; therefore, we're going through the March of the\nLiving -- the Holocaust survivors will be dead.\u201d I don't want to hear it. I want to live for a\nwhile yet and tell my story. And I think maybe I will. With God's help, I will. Well, the\n\u2018\u201c\u201cShema\u2019\u201d I've been saying in Auschwitz, at the roll call, appell, I still say. If things get really\ntough and you know they have been. I've complained already in the meantime and I've had\nall kinds of diseases, I'll say my \u201cShema,\u201d I go on. So, basically, I wouldn't call myself a very\northodox person, but I would call myself an observer. And I think everybody should, in their\nown religion, should be observant. It will make for a better world.",
        "Q: So you do believe in God?",
        "A: I do. Because I, I feel somehow, somebody looked out over me, looked out for me because\nnot too many people came out of this horror.",
        "Q: When you think about the human race, as opposed to God, given what you went through and\nwhat you saw people doing to other human beings, are you -- you don't look like a\npessimistic person, but are you pessimistic or are you optimistic?",
        "A: Well, what they did to other people, yeah -- that in the beginning did destroy my whole\noutlook on life. That I have to admit. That was, \u201cWhere was God, you know, and why did\nthey do it? The Germans educated people, and, you know, why would they do a thing like\nthat?\u201d It is very much so threw me off everything 1n the very beginning. But then I noticed\nthat without God and without a belief, it's not for me. I can't go on like that, so I went right\nback to where I started out from. I really did. I tried to instill it into my kids, but they are not\nas observant as I am. But, to each his own. I don't preach to them, I let them do whatever\nthey want to because it has to come from you inside, so...",
        "Q: Is there anything you would like to say that we haven't talked about, or tell your grandkids?",
        "A: Well, one thing I hope and pray that there is never a repetition of this horrible crime the\nGermans have done. I hope that they have a better life. It doesn't just go for my\ngrandchildren, it goes for all human beings, humankind. And these wars, unfortunately, in\nthe Middle East and all that, I hope will come to peace, eventually. That the whole world\nwill be at ease, there will be fights. No guns, no nothing. Guns should be completely\ndestroyed. There shouldn't be any of this, and people should live in harmony and peace. And\nI hope my grandchildren -- I won't see it anymore, but maybe my grandchildren will.",
        "Q: Thank you.",

        "A: Good morning.",
        "A: Same here, nice to meet you.",
        "A: Right. I was born Carola Stern in 1925, March the 8th. No, March the 8th, right. In Nieder-\nohmen, Germany. And my father's name was Meier Stern. My mother's name was Hedwig\nStern, and we lived in Nieder-ohmen for many, many years before -- my parents were both\nborn there. My grandparents were born there, and I believe my great grandparents were born\nthere.",
        "A: I do have a sister, yes. She was just about 15 months older than me, and we lived very\nhappily in Nieder-ohmen.",
        "A: My father was a cattle dealer and so had been my grandfather before him. And my father had\nsisters and brothers who more or less helped 1n this field. And then my grandfather was\ngetting older, my father took over. So we had cattles, and we had everything. We had\nchickens and we had goats and we had a marvelous time, especially when we were young.\nAnd we had eggs and we raised potatoes, and we had a whole farm. We were actually\nfarmers.",
        "A: Including cattle, yes. We had a stall with cattles where my mother reluctantly went in the\nmorning to milk the cows. It was a little shtetl, and we had people who helped. And we were\nfarmers, just like anybody else in Nieder-ohmen. There was never any difference; we were\nJewish, but we didn't feel it. We were Germans first. Jews were secondary -- nobody\nbothered with this religion. And since my father was a veteran of World War I, he was very\nwell liked. Very well liked. And whenever someone had a problem in Nieder-ohmen, my\nfather was sure to solve it. We called him later on the Kissinger\u2019 of Nieder-ohmen.",
        "A: Well, there were problems with marriages. One wanted a divorce from one another, so they\nwould come to my father and ask him could he talk to this one and that one. My father did,\nand he usually solved everything. He was very well liked. So was my mother.",
        "A: My mother was about 13 years younger as my father. So we looked upon my father as the\nhead of the house, and my mother was one of us. She was a young girl. She always has been,\nand as we grew older, she sort of looked for guidance towards us, to my sister and me. And\nwe became sort of like three sisters. She was quite young, she was still our mother. I mean I\nwouldn't say when it came to disciplining us, she was the head of the house. She knew just\nwhat to do, but basically we grew up together with our mother.",
        "A: My mother was 20. She was 19 when she got engaged, and my father must have been 32.\nAnd my mother, and then she got married at 20 when my father was 33. And from the same\nvillage, it wasn't unusual.",
        "A: No, it wasn't unusual. And they were very much in love, I was told. My father, everybody\nthought that, \u201c\u201cWhy would he marry such a young kid?\u201d But my mother was 1n love with\nhim, I heard that and I seen that.",
        "A: Very warm household, right. But we did -- our grandparents lived with us. And my father\nhad a sister who was retarded. She lived with us, too. So it was a big house, but it was a\nhappy house. My mother took care of the retarded sister, who, who,, really was never older\nthan 11, let's say. You know, mentally. And we grew up with her, too.\nAnd we had a dog, and, we were just one happy family. We never had any problems.\nHenry Alfred Kissinger",
        "A: I tried. It didn't help me. But what I did, we had a dog. And whenever my mother punished\nme, I would go out. The dog was never in the house, that didn't happen in Germany. Dogs\nwere kept outside, so, therefore, I went outside. If she punished me, I went outside and ate\nwith the dog.",
        "A: I ate with the dog. And my mother would always catch me, and she would say, \"Why are\nyou eating the dog's food?\" And I would just say, \"Well, the dog didn't want it.\" And I ate it,\nand, you know, grew up healthy. Didn't bother me a bit.",
        "A: It was -- he sort of was my friend, you know. He walked after me wherever I went. And, you\nknow, in Germany where we lived, we had an outhouse. We didn't have a toilet inside, so the\ndog was right next to the outhouse. So every time we went there or stayed there a little while,\nthe dog would scratch on the door. \u201cIt's enough already, come on out.\u201d So the dog was part\nof our family, we loved him. And his name was Flock.",
        "A: Uh-huh. Strange name.",
        "A: Well, I had lots of German friends. I had little kids who played with me, and went to school\nwith me and we were -- sometimes one of my friends would go with me to synagogue, and I\nwent with her to church. My mother told me I shouldn't kneel down because that's not in my\nreligion, so I didn't. Nobody bothered, I don't even think they did kneel down. Because I was\nalways told, I remember that from way back. But, but I went to church Sundays and she went\nto synagogue on Saturdays. We were really close friends, and she's still alive. And she was\nhappy that I did that for her, and I was happy to have her. I never wanted to let her go, why\nlet her go on Saturdays and why would she let me go on Sundays, you know? But it\nchanged, it changed in 1933. It changed a lot. This particular friend didn't change too much,\nbut I had one girl which really was my idol. She was extremely intelligent, and she was a\nlittle redhead and she was very cute. And we played together, and at one point she said to\nme, \"You know, Carola, I can't play with you anymore.\" And I said, \"How come?\" She said,\n\"Because you're a Jew.\" I said, \"What is that?\" She said, \"Well, have you heard of Hitler?\" I\nsaid, \"Yes, because every morning they used to say Heil Hitler. And,, but why can't you play\nwith me anymore? Why?\" She said, \"Because my father told me that you're Jewish, and\nGentile children, Aryan kids can no longer play with the Jewish kids.\"\nAnd her father had gone to school with my mother, and they were the best of friends. And\nthat was very, very hard for an eight-year-old, you know. It felt very strange that suddenly --\nand then the whole group disappeared. Nobody would play with a Jewish child anymore. So\nthen we sort of -- to the Jewish kids, we were friendly with the Jewish kids, too. So then we\nwere all Jewish kids, and we stuck to one another.",
        "A: Felt there was something -- I was different. And I couldn't, and I couldn't understand why I\nwas different. Well, I was asked before by someone why was I different. Did I feel any\ndifferent? You know, we did speak Hochdeutsch\u2019, which is the better German. So did that\ngirl, this Lucy, Lucy, really, she spoke Hochdeutsch. Only the farmers had a dialect, and we\nnever did have a dialect. So I felt was that the difference? No, it wasn't the difference,\nbecause the teacher spoke Hochdeutsch and so did the pastor of the village, speak\nHochdeutsch. So we were -- I was very upset that suddenly they would make such a\ndifference and make us feel like outcasts, and it got worse and worse. It was just -- that was\nonly the beginning.",
        "A: Yes. Not right away, because we were pretty good students, especially my sister was an\nexcellent student. So the teachers couldn't right away throw us out of school because we sort\nof held the school together. But there was a time where it was impossible, it was only Heil\nHitler and there were these songs which I really can't translate. But in German it was\n\u2018\u201cWenn\u2019s Judenblut vom Messer spritzt\u2019.\u201d Jewish blood runs off the knives, then we feel\nbetter. Just songs like that, and we felt very, very, very bad. We were little kids and yet when\nwe looked around and we seen the BDM\u2019, that's a circle of German girls who had these nice\noutings, we felt so why can't we be part of it? Why can't we? As a matter of fact, I remember\nat one point when I walked through the schoolyard -- we lived right next to the schoolyard --\neverybody said, \"Heil, Hitler\" like this. I did, too. What did I know? I was eight years old. So\nmy mother said to me, \"You're not supposed to do that.\" I said, \"Why not?\" She said,\n\"Haven't you been told that you are Jewish?\" I said, \"Oh, I forgot.\" So it was very hard to\ncomprehend.\nI couldn't get it together that I was suddenly Jewish and I couldn't do whatever I did before.\n* Standard German (German)\n\u00b0 When the blood of the Jews sprays from the knife (German).\n* Bund Deutscher Madel [League of German Girls] (German); branch of Hitler Youth.\nBut, they told me quickly that...",
        "A: It was very frightening, and, especially for an eight-year-old child. If you're older, you\nunderstand. But it got worse and worse, and by the age of 11, my parents decided that they\ncouldn't leave me in school anymore. Neither myself nor my sister, and they would send me\nto a Jewish school. In the meantime they had made Jewish schools all over Germany where\nonly Jewish kids went. And so, therefore, I went to Bad Nauheim, which was Bad Nauheim\nBezirkschule\u2019 in the district of the area where some of the children came by bus and some of\nthem stayed in the dorm. And I was sent into the dorm. I was very homesick, and my mother\nand father had a hard time getting me there, but once I was there I was fine. And my sister\nwent -- went,, she's a year older -- she skipping already, I don't know, in one grade here and\nthere, went straight to a teacher's seminary to Wurzburg. That was a teacher's seminary, so\nshe went there and I went to Bad Nauheim.",
        "A: In 19 -- I was 11, 1936.",
        "A: Yeah, always, always. And my sister, although she's only 15 months older, she always was,\nlike, she gave me strength. I, I made believe like she was 100 years older, and I would say to\nher, \"So, what's going to happen to us?\" She says, \"Nothing. I don't know why you're\nworried. It's going to be all right. Don't worry about it. We'll live, we'll survive.\" So I figured\nif she said so, I'll probably survive and went on with that thought.",
        "A: My father, my father was a very -- he was a German. He would say, \"I went through World\nWar I, and the Germans are really not bad people. And you're a young girl, and they're not\ngoing to kill you. Don't worry about it, you'll be fine. You'll absolutely fine. Hitler will\ndisappear one of these days, and you're going to be okay. Just hold out, don't let them make\nyou crazy. Be strong.\" And he had all these quotations from Schiller\u00ae and Goethe\u2019 and all\nkinds of things telling me that never do anything wrong. \u201cRather suffer, but don't do\nanything wrong.\u201d Which in German is, \u201cLieber Unrecht Leiden als tun.*\u201d And he left me\nwith all kinds of legacies, and I really, I, I lived through this on my life. I listened to ... he\n\u00b0 District school (German)\n\u00b0 (Johann Christoph) Friedrich von Schiller\n\u2019 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n* Better to suffer injustice than to cause it (German).\nwas a very bright man.\nAnd,, at least of everybody feels their father's superior, but he had a strong mind. And he\nkept saying that definitely we'll get through that easily, and we don't have to go to America.\nWe can stay in Germany, not to worry. So what was I supposed to do? I said \u201cokay.\u201d Little\ndid he know what was in store for him.",
        "A: Well, yes. We had a -- we could have gone, but the number was very high. It was 70 or\nsomething, 700, I don't remember anymore. And, we had an aunt, you know, my father had\nthis retarded sister. And he wasn't going to let her go, just abandon her. So he said, \"Maybe I\nought to send the children,\" my sister and myself. But then he said, \"But my kids want to be\nwith me.\" And we really wanted to be with them, and he said, \"It will be okay.\" But in the\nmeantime, they took the retarded sister into a home to Berlin away from us. And my father\nwas taken to a labor camp, and well, on the 10th of November, you know, he was taken to\nBuchenwald. And my mother came to, to Bad Nauheim where I was. And my sister came to\nBad Nauheim from Wurzburg and we reunited there. And from there we just faded out and\nbeing in Bad Nauheim with all the children and we were taken out of the school to the,. . .",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Life was better for me school-wise, yes. And I was 11 years old, so I figured eventually I\nwould have to grow up -- be on my own, so I adjusted very well and I stayed there, and I had\nfriends and it was fine. I could have gone home. I usually went home on vacations, but, it\nwas never the same anymore because my sister wasn't there, and I stayed a few days and\nwent back to school. But it was considerably pretty normal yet.",
        "A: Well, the 10th of November.",
        "A: 1938. The Germans came and threw all the kids out, cut into the feather beds, and the whole\nschool was in an uproar. The little kids were crying, looking for their parents. But naturally\nthere were no parents; it was a boarding school. And, well, I was one of the older ones, there\nwere six-year-olds; we held on to them. And they marched us to the mayor's office with the\nteachers, and the teachers were frightened themselves. We thought we were going to be shot\nthere, but we weren't. We stayed there for a while, and from there we went back home. We\nwent home. In the school, and it was horror. All the feather beds and everything was on the\nfloor and all the -- it was a religious school, so the torah cloths were all torn and the books all\n-- whatever. But we remained in the school until 1939. We fixed it up again, and we stayed\nthere.",
        "A: The kids and the teachers and whoever helped, we all fixed it up, and we stayed another year\nuntil 1939.",
        "A: Yes. The kids had bad dreams. So did the teachers. They weren't that much older, you know.\nAnd we all had bad dreams. We were afraid. What would they do with us? And, -- but life\nwent on, and we stayed till 1939 and then the school was eliminated.",
        "A: And my sister stayed in the school for another year. Since she had some education in\nWurzburg she taught first and second grade.",
        "A: In my school.",
        "A: That was good because I had my sister. My mother went back home, and I think she\neliminated everything. She -- my grandparents and her and my father moved to Frankfurt\nbecause there was no way we could stay in Nieder-ohmen because we were recognized all\nover. In Frankfurt, nobody knew us as Jews. We were just people like anybody else until we\nhad to wear the star. So we lived together with our grandparents and it was okay. And, my\nsister worked, she had to do some, also, some slave labor work in Frankfurt. I don't recall\nwhat she did, but I went to school yet because I was still young -- younger. I went to\nPhilanthropin and I took a course in medicine.\nI took a course in sewing, and I sort of was preparing myself for America. Learned how to\nspeak English. And,, all kinds of courses, and that lasted until 1941. From 1931, till 1939 till\n1941.",
        "A: Yes, but he came out about four weeks later because he was the so-called Frontkampfer'\u201d\nbecause had for -- at the front, so that if you could provide papers, they let him out. So he\ncame to Frankfurt, and in Frankfurt he was taken away to a labor camp. It was someplace\naround Mecklenburg, I believe; I don't recall. And he had to do really hard work.",
        "A: I remember. He was so thin, and he was -- a few teeth were missing. I don't know whether\nthey had beat him up or something, and he never wanted to talk about it. He was afraid that\nwe would be frightened by it. And since he was such a German, he thought that couldn't\nhappen to him. He definitely didn't want to talk about 1t. And I remember in 1939 when\nGerman soldiers came back to Germany from Poland, and they used to say, \"They're taking\nthe Polish Jews and they shoot them right outside.\" And my father would say, \u201cthat guy\nnever told the truth, it's not so. I'm sure it's not.\u201d He denied it. He really denied it, he thought\nthat couldn't happen. Germans were not bad people. It was, you know, they were educated\nmostly from birth. Beethoven\u2019 t Schiller and all the whole thing, so he couldn't believe that.",
        "A: No. I listened to my father. I thought my father couldn't be wrong. Only I could be wrong. I\nwas too young anyway to think -- my sister kept saying, \"Daddy is right. Not to worry.\" So\nwe weren't worried.",
        "A: And my parents.",
        "A: My mother and my sister. My father was then taken away.\n\u00b0 Crystal Night (German); Night of Broken Glass.\n' Front line soldier (German)\n'' Ludwig van Beethoven",
        "A: Right. In Frankfurt. And it was bearable. We had a room and we didn't have much to eat, but\nwe had food stamps, and we got food here and there. My grandfather used to go and buy\nthings, but we were always rationed. My grandmother was always afraid that I would eat too\nmuch. Because I was always tall and heavier than the rest of the family, and she couldn't\nstand that. Whenever I ate, she said, \"It's enough.\"\nThat was a little hard for me, but she didn't mean any harm. I just took it very badly. But, in\n1941 they took 150 or 60 young girls from Frankfurt to Berlin to a labor camp, and I was\namong them. My parents remained. My mother and my grandparents and my sister remained\nin Frankfurt, but I was taken to Berlin.",
        "A: By then we were wearing -- yes. By then we were wearing a Jewish star, right.",
        "A: Young Jewish girls.",
        "A: Not older -- we were maybe \u2018til 18. I was 15 then.",
        "A: Well, we got a notice...",
        "A: ... we had to be -- in the mail. And we had to be there at a certain time, and a doctor would\nexamine us, a Jewish doctor. And we were told we were going to a labor camp, which we\ndid, and we were all taken to Berlin. Now, we were -- like I was 15 years old. I didn't think\nthat was so terrible. I went with lots of friends. Of course, I had to say goodbye again to my\nparents from then I would never see them anymore, and my grandparents and I went to\nBerlin. And when, when, we came to Berlin, we were put up in an old movie house, and, it\nwas in a very good neighborhood. But it was an old movie house and they made it in little\nrooms, so we were about -- two, four, six, eight people -- eight girls together. It was livable.\nIf they would have left us alone, we could have survived there during the war. It was livable.\nSo, of course, food was scarce, but at that time they had occupied Italy. They brought\nwatermelons, and we had enough potatoes, so we made potatoes and we fried them with\nnothing. Made potato pancakes and watermelons and we got a little bread, and we got by.\nAnd we worked for the Siemens-Schuckert- Werke 1n Berlin. It was pretty hard labor,\nespecially for a 15-year-old, but...",
        "A: We were making airplane doors. Well, I wouldn't say doors. A little, it was more or less\nwindows. We had to cut off pieces,, we put it on a -- in German, it's a trebank.\u2019\u201d I've seen\nthese things here, and I kept looking at them. I said, \"This is what I worked on.\" You had to\nput it into the machine, and then you had to put the knife really close to it.\nAnd then it would cut off a piece, make it to a certain size. And very often if you didn't do\nthat right and the thing kept falling out, you know, and would hit you. But I was always very\ncareful to do it nght, and I did okay. They paid us very little, but we had enough money to\nsupport ourselves.",
        "A: They would pay us a little bit, yes. But we weren't just Jewish girls, there were German\npeople living in Berlin, older people who worked there. And I was in Abteilung\u2019? 505. That\nwas really for big, fat people. And since I was strong and tall, they put me in there while the\nothers went to different places, but luckily I survived in that place. It was, 1t was bad, but the\nvoice of my father came up, \"You've got to survive. You have to be strong.\" And I tried very\nhard really. It wasn't always pleasant, but Berlin was not the worst. The worst is yet to come.\nEnd of Tape #1\n* Lathe (German)\n'\u00b0 Division (German)\nTape #2",
        "A: No, she didn't. She took care of her parents, our grandparents, and, she took care of us.",
        "A: I don't know. I have no idea. Maybe they had a little bit, I have no idea. There was no one\nworking, and I don't know where the money came -- maybe from my grandparents. I asked\nthat question many a times.",
        "A: Yeah, they just took it. It wasn't sold. It was confiscated, absolutely. So we didn't get any\nmoney from the farm then until later on. So there was -- I don't know. What I lived from, I\nhave no idea.",
        "A: I remember that, right. I remember that.",
        "A: Well, we were afraid that we weren't going to see him anymore. And he said that he would\ncome back, not to worry. He's not going to leave us, he will come back. But I didn't see him\nanymore. My mother and my sister did, but I didn't see him anymore.",
        "A: They took Jewish people out to labor camps. They wouldn't let anybody in there, and I\nsuppose he wrote to them here and there. But I was taken away, so I had no connections with\nmy father anymore. I would write to my mother once 1n a while, and she would write back.\nBut that was only a short while, I was taken in 1941 to Berlin, in February.\nAnd my parents were taken then altogether to Lodz in September of 1941.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They sent a letter saying we are relocating to Litzmannstadt. I still didn't know what that\nmeant. They were moved out of Frankfurt to Lodz together with my sister, that's all I knew.\nNothing else.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, there was no particular effect, not on us personally. We went about our way like I was in\nschool yet and, but no, not me. I mean, I was absolutely away from everybody. You know, I\nwas all on my own. Then in Berlin, of course, I was together with other girls, and we formed\nclose ties; we really did. We had no other choice. All we had was each other, and we didn't\nknow what was going to happen. Their parents were also taken, so, we didn't know. We had\nto really stick to one another and bond.",
        "A: Well, we were -- the more religious girls would eat together, you know, and I was one of\nthem. And a little bit, I think, I was an outcast because the others always thought I was a\nlittle bit too religious. I really wasn't, I was just observant. That was how I was brought up\nfrom home. But other kids really didn't care about religion, the other girls. They did\nwhatever they had to do, so I made sure not to eat meat and things like that, you know. If\nthere was meat available, I stayed away from it, I didn't -- I was very kosher.",
        "A: Right. I didn't think I was, but kosher I was.",
        "A: Absolutely. Right. It was very much accepted in Nieder-ohmen, very much so. Because on\nPassover, we would hand out matzos to our Gentile neighbors and friends, and they in return\nwould give us eggs. And I very often went to my friend's house and they had these beautiful\nsalamis hanging in their cellar. It looked so good to me, I asked my mother many a times,\n\"Why can't I just have a sliver?\" And she said, \"It's not kosher. It comes from a pig.\" So that\nwas it, it was a no-no and I lived by the rules.",
        "A: Well, we were young, 15 years old. No, I wasn't really that weak, but I missed my parents. I\nmissed everything. But, you know, there was one thing we were young, and I think that\nreally helped. Because when you're young, you always feel that something better is going to\ncome, and it will eventually be good again. And we really didn't think of the worst, none of\nus did. We thought, \u201cEventually this will all end and we are going to go home again, and\nwe'll be free.\u201d But it didn't come to that, never did.",
        "A: I did. I prayed for myself. They didn't do much praying. But I had one girl -- two other girls\nwho were equally religious, and we did a lot of praying. But the other girls really didn't.\nThey sort of looked down on us a little bit like the frumis -- frumies'* you know. That was\ndone, but it didn't bother us a bit. It was okay.",
        "A: Spiritually. In Berlin?",
        "A: Well, it wasn't that much that people got sick, but, you know, they were young girls and they\nwanted to have dates. They wanted to go out on a date, and maybe they did. And they wore\nthe Juden-star, the star, and they were caught. And when they were caught, they went right to\nthe gas chambers. They went right to Auschwitz where we never heard from them again. So\nthat was a big issue, and so many girls disappeared. They just felt we'll take the star off and\nnobody will even know that I'm Jewish. After all, our skin was white. So nobody would\nknow, but they were always caught, and many of the girls were taken before that time to\ncamps and never survived.",
        "A: It's hard to say -- it's hard to say who they met. They were recognized by somebody. Maybe\ntheir nose was too long. Maybe they were stopped by a Gestapo, who would say \u201cDu bist\neine Jiidin?\u201d\u2019\u201d and then what? To say \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d You had to have papers,\n'* Pious Jews (Yiddish)\n'\u00b0 You are a Jewess? (German)\nthat was it.",
        "A: Oh, where did they find boys? Well, in the factory, you could find not just Jewish boys.\nThere were the men who helped us with the machinery. Every young men, young German\nmen, who sort of became interested in the Jewish girls, and if you were stupid enough, you\nwould go with them. But, otherwise, you just didn't do that.",
        "A: Never. First of all, that wouldn't have been my thing. I was much too religious. Second of all,\nthat was something you just didn't do as a decent human being; you just wouldn't do that. So",
        "A: In Bad Nauheim?",
        "A: Oh, yes. We had a wonderful life there. We had -- 1t was very good there. Really, it was\neasy. I met my husband there. He went to the same boarding school.",
        "A: We were -- I had an eye on him. I don't know whether he had an eye on me. Like girls\nusually do, yes.",
        "A: I had a little bit of a crush on him. I had a little crush on the teacher, and like all girls do, that\nwas okay. But, you know, I went away, and we had different, very different roads, you\nknow.",
        "A: In Berlin?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right. I, we could go out on certain days. We had a curfew, of course, you know. But we\ncould go out on Sundays if we weren't working in the factory. And I remember taking\nanother girl along. I had heard that there was an institute for retarded people, and that she\nwas brought there. So every Sunday I went with my friends to that place, and -- to meet her,\nto see her. And she was so happy when I came, and she didn't really know where she was.\nShe had her friends there, and it was ring around the rosy and whatever, and she was happy\nto see me. And I was happy that she was happy, and I went back into the labor camp, until\none day I went to see her -- wanted to see her and it was closed. Closed indefinitely, no\nmore. Somehow they had taken them all some place and suppose gassed them.",
        "A: It was terrible, right. But I realized -- I still didn't realize that they had gassed them. I thought\nmaybe they put them someplace else. I mean, you really didn't -- maybe we were so naive\nwe really didn't think of gas chambers because we thought relocating, relocation, that was\nthe thing. Gas chambers were far from our minds. We didn't think that could happen. That\nwas only later. So when she wasn't there anymore, I was devastated, but there was nothing I\ncould do. That was it.",
        "A: Right. And my aunt, well she wasn't much of a help, but she was there, you know. While I\nwas 1n Berlin, I knew she was there, and I could see her. She was someone from home, but\nthat was it. There was no, no relationship with anybody. We sort of had each other, the girls.",
        "A: Well, we all did, you know. When we cried, we cried together. And like, you know, like in\nGerman they'll say, \u201cgeteilter schmerz ist halber schmerz,'\u00ae\u201d \u201cIf you share your pain with\nsomeone, it's half the pain.\u201d And we shared everything, everything, even the clothes we\nshared. We were really one happy bunch together. We made the best of it, but it wasn't until\nwe were in Berlin until 1943 in February, they took big transports, more than a thousand\nJews from Berlin, including us. And they told us in the labor camp that they didn't need us\nany longer. We are going to be resettled to Poland, and they're going to have Russians --\nWhite Russian, who were replacing us. But what could we do? We were going together on\n'\u00ae Shared pain is half the pain (German)\nthe transport, and we were together again, all of us, 160, 50, 40, whatever we were by then.\nSome of the girls, I must say, had gone back home to their parents and were taken with their\nparents to a camp. How this was arranged, I don't know. But, I couldn't, my parents just\ndisappeared overnight, so I couldn't have gone with them.",
        "A: Yeah, we heard about ghettos. Never about killings. We heard about resettlements in ghettos.\nKillings, we didn't hear about. We, we kept thinking about the girls who disappeared from\nnowhere. That they did something wrong, they shouldn't have done it. But, we never thought\nthat they were actually killed. We thought maybe they had taken them into a camp\nsomeplace else, but that they were killed? Never entered my mind, anyway. So it was not\nuntil 1943 in February we were taken to -- we didn't know where we were taken.\nWe were taken to Auschwitz. We were going on the cattle -- on the train. And in the train, it\nwas horrible conditions. We were in there for quite a few days, and, people died right then\nand there. And we had one pail in the middle there -- well, it was horrible. So ...",
        "A: one of -- not knowing where we were going, not knowing what they were going to do with\nus, that was really hard. But there were always a few people, older people than us, who said,\n\"It's going to be all right. You're going to be resettled and not to worry.\" We never really\nscreamed, cried, or did anything. We just took it as it came, I guess because we were young.\nAnd we said, \u201cIt's going to be all right.\u201d\u2019 One sort of did that to the other, you know, we tried\nto really calm each other down until we got the train rolled in Auschwitz in February. And\nthen we what happened, we got out in the middle of night and there was Mengele\u2019 \u2019. Of\ncourse, we didn't know who Mengele was, and there were quite a lot of other Gestapo and\nSS men and everybody around us with dogs. And they kept screaming in German, of course,\n\"Aussteigen, Aussteigen! \"'S And they formed a line, and \u201cYou go right and the other one\ngoes left.\u201d And whatever the older people left, the children to the left, and the younger\npeople to the right.

        "A: Right. From Berlin.",
        "A: I didn't know it then. Later on I recognized him. I really didn't know then. And he started\nscreaming, \"You get here. You go here.\" Well, by then I was 17, so I went into the camps\nand all the rest of the people -- I mean, the older people, and the people -- the children went\nto the gas chambers. But we didn't know that. So when we got to the camps, we were first --\nthey undressed us. We were sent to the sauna, and in the sauna -- they cut our hair before\nthat. They cut our hair, and then we were tattooed. And we met in the sauna, we were all\nsitting together, not knowing each other because we had no hair and it was really -- for a\nyoung girl to suddenly have no hair whatsoever -- was a devastating experience. But it wasn't\nthe worst. So we just looked at each other and most of the time, we didn't even recognize\neach other because we looked so different.\nSo after the so-called delousing, we were given clothing. Our clothes we never seen any\nmore. So they gave us some old things. I was a tall girl and I had a blouse which went to\nhere. No hair, and unbelievably you looked like a degenerate. You looked like an idiot\ncoming out of there. And what happened to those beautiful girls, I've been asked many a\ntimes, but you were a young girl. You must have been a pretty girl. If that's done to you,\nyou're not pretty anymore. You look disgusting, and, of course, that wasn't the worst yet. The\nworst was yet to come.",
        "A: Clippers.",

        "A: Yes, they did.",
        "A: We went in a line, some of them did their head and some of them did the other, you know,\nbodily hairs for us. It was a line, it was very well organized like everything in Germany was\nvery well organized. But the people who did that were other inmates, you know, that were\nassigned to that particular thing. And most of them didn't speak German at all, so the only\nlanguage I spoke was German. So all, some of them spoke Polish; some of them spoke\nwhatever . . . Czechoslovakian",
        "A: Well, you know, you know my friend, Zippy\u2019, she was around that area. She was in the\nPolitische Abteilung\u201d and I remember her coming by and saying -- she spoke German, and\nshe said, \"Don't say a word. Just do what they tell you and you'll be okay.\" And I figured she\nreally meant well with me, and I did what she said. I didn't say one word, and I told my\nfriends, \"Just let's keep still and do what they tell us to do.\" And they really didn't do us any\nharm except for someone who made a big to-do about it. I don't want my hair cut. Why\nshould you? Some of the women were married to Gentiles, and they said, \"My husband is an\nAryan. Why should you cut my hair?\" And that would get those girls who had been there for\nseveral years already extremely angry. They kept saying, \"But you are a Jew. So, therefore,\nwe have to cut your hair and shut up.\" So there was always some sort of an argument with\ncutting of the hair.",
        "A: Yes, she would just go around and say, \"Be quiet. Don't say anything.\nLet them cut your hair. It's not the world's worst. It will grow back.\" And she was right, you\nknow. This is not the world's worst, this wasn't.",
        "A: The tattooing was done --, well, like any tattooing here. People are tattooed all the time. The\ntattooing was they took your skin and they took a pin, a pen, pen and they sort of stuck it in\npiece by piece and they put the number. It's a real German number I have on my arm. And\nthen this half a Winkel,\u201d' here underneath, which I never knew what it actually meant. I\nthought maybe this was part of a -- half of a Magen David.

        "A: It was old people, other inmates who were assigned to do these things. It wasn't the SS\nwomen themselves. They just stood there and supervised. They didn't do that themselves.\nThey stood and laughed and had a good time in seeing these poor Jews looking like animals.",
        "A: Yeah, once in a while there was a...",
        "A: There was always a few SS men standing there with the SS women, and -- but it didn't\nbother us. We really you know, we didn't look like women anymore anyway. We were not\nashamed of anything, that's what we looked like and that's what we had to deal with.",
        "A: I believe I was registered the first day I came in, because, you know, the Germans are\naccurate with their registrations and their book work. So I believe I was registered, maybe I\nwasn't. I don't know.",
        "A: I believe so. Maybe they did. If they did, I don't remember. It could have been because why\nwould they have the officers where Zippy worked, they called it the Politische~ Office. So\nmaybe they did, I do not recall it at all. It's possible.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Now, we were assigned to a block. I think it was Block 13 I was in. We were all the girls, not\nall of the girls who came at the same transport. So we were more or less together, and we\n* Political (German)\nwere put on -- so we had what we call a Koje.\u201d\nYou know what a Koje is? A Koje is like a board. There was one on the bottom; there was\none on the top, and I think there was a third one. We had no straw, we had no blankets, we\nhad nothing and it was February. They took away our clothes, but I do remember they left\nme with my shoes. And I was a kid, I didn't know -- I had shoes, very simple shoes on. I was\nin Auschwitz three days and the soles had separated from the top. So I found a rag\nsomeplace and tied them together. It was quite a few weeks I walked barefoot in February. It\nwas very cold. There was snow on the ground. I put all kinds of -- whatever I could find on\nmy feet just to stay warm. And so they did put us into the barracks. And then every morning\nwe had zahlappell** which is the roll call, and there was usually SS men or SS women that\ncame. We stood there sometimes for hours in the freezing cold, so some of the girls already\ndied right then and there because it was impossible. Couldn't take that. Food, we hardly got.\nAnd really, I mean, they were falling down left and right. So standing there -- then, one of\nthe SS men would come and make a selection, and most of the time that was Mengele. And\nhe would go to say -- he didn't like the face, he didn't like what you looked like, and he says,\n\"Come on out. Come on out. Come on out.\" So I remember that so well. You know, I was\nbrought up very religious, and the prayer you say when you die is \u201cShema Israel~\u2019,\u201d so every\ntime he came around, I would just stand there and say my prayer. And luckily I was never\ntaken. And I used to tell my friends, \"Do what I'm doing.\" I was such a religious person.\nWell, it worked for me, it didn't work for everybody.\nSo it went on for weeks and weeks. We marched out in the morning. We went to build\nbarracks out in Auschwitz, and then the SS men came with their dogs. And if they didn't like\nyou -- but who you -- liked you? You looked like an animal. They would just say, \"Go, run\nafter her. Go ahead and take the dog.\" The dog would bite you. I have a few bites on my\nlegs. And, you know, by then you were already every day you looked skinnier and skinnier.\nThere was nothing left of you anymore, and then suddenly I noticed I was getting typhoid. I\nstarted to -- couldn't control my bowel movements anymore, and I felt this is it. I'll probably\nlay down like the rest of them. By then most of the girls had already -- the first four weeks\nwere the worst, and I probably won't be able to make this. But then I remember my father\nsaid not to give in. \u201cYou've got to be strong.\u201d And at night I used to hallucinate and, you\nknow, there was no Schindler \u2019, no Schindler's list or anything. If anyone would help you, it\nwas the girl who laid next to you. She would say, \"Here, look, I give you a piece of rag to\nclean yourself off, and I'll take your bread.\" Well, I much rather gave her the bread, clean\n\u00b0\u00b0 Bunk (German)\n* Roll call count (German)\n> Hear, O Israel (Hebrew); declaration of God\u2019s unity and watchword of Jewish faith.\n\u00b0 Oskar Schindler\nmyself off, and be okay the next day. But it was horrible, I screamed for my mother, my\nfather. There was nobody. I was a young girl, I just felt somebody should listen to me. I\nreally would say the first four weeks, if you held out the first four or six weeks, you were\nokay. I think I did, I held out those weeks.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",

        "A: We walked out -- I don't know. We walked out, we walked in at night. Quite a distance, it\nmust have been in Oswiecim, in someplace there. And, we, you know, we carried the stones.\nIf we had sort of a jacket, we had to turn it around and we put the stones in there and carried\nthem. The buttons in the back, and that's the kind of work we did.",
        "A: Yeah, right away. Right away. The first four weeks, I was doing that kind of work and that\nwas the time when I started having typhoid. I was so sick, so sick. And I went -- in\nAuschwitz, there was this so-called LagerstraBe,\u201d\u2019 the street. And there was the LagerstraBe\nwhere our barrack was, and I -- it was close to the kitchen. And I walked to the kitchen, and I\nfound some coal on the floor. And I always heard that coal will stuff you up if you eat coal.\nAnd I had a little bit of medical knowledge, not too much. Coal will stuff you up. No matter\nwhat, what could have happened? I found a piece of coal in the kitchen and I ate the coal,\nand I found a piece of lemon peel near the kitchen and I took the piece of lemon peel in my\npocket. I ate the piece of coal. And water we didn't have, but we had the snow on the ground.\nAnd I ate the snow, and I swallowed that and I got better. And every time when I felt faint,\nand I had that piece of lemon peel in my pocket for all the years I\u2019ve been in Auschwitz, and\nevery time I felt faint, I took that lemon peel. And, you know, there's always a little\nsomething coming out yet -- no matter how long you have a lemon peel in your pocket -- and\nI could smell it, and I felt like -- relieved. So the lemon peel and the coal got me out of my\ndilemma. And then one day, they were taking all the so-called fryz] erkas~* which I didn't\nknow at the time what that meant, to Auschwitz. And they needed new ones in Birkenau. I\ndidn't know what that meant, and they had selected already about six; they needed a seventh.\nAnd this girl, Sheyna was her name, stood next to me, and she said to me, \"Pick up your\narm.\" And I said, \"Now I\u2019m not -- what is a fryzjerka anyway?\" She says, \"A fryzjerka is a\nbeautician.\" And I said, \"But I'm not a beautician. I, I don't know how to do hair. I can't do\n7 Camp street (German)\n*> Hair dresser (Polish)\nthat for the SS women.\" She said, \"Oh, keep quiet. Just give them your number.\" So she took\nmy hand, and she said, \"37468, she's the seventh fryzjerka. \u201c So the girl in charge took my\nnumber down and that made me the fryzjerka, which is a beautician, but I didn't have to do\nthe SS women. All I did was cutting the hair of the people who came in the same way they\nhad done to us. Now, that was a very devastating experience, since lots of transports came in\nand lots of friends of mine came and I had to cut their hair. And I kept telling them, like\nZippy had done previously to me, \"Do what they tell you and don't make noise.\" And I did\ntell them, and their hair was cut and I did that for quiet some time. That somehow made my\nlife a little better since it was indoors. Then after a while, they replaced us again with other\ngirls.",
        "A: I don't recall how long, but I did that for a few months, for a few months.",
        "A: The same barrack I was living in, yes.",
        "A: No, they didn't train me, no. Well, everybody knows how to use a clipper, and you just cut\nthe hair. I really didn't do too much hair cutting. I did more of the body -- the bodily hair, you\nknow, under the arm, on the bottom part. And it worked for a while, it was okay.\nThen they replaced us again.",
        "A: It wasn't easy, but it got me out of the Aufenarbeit,\u201d\u2019 going, marching out of the camps every\nday and building barracks.",
        "A: We were mainly supervised by Kapos, women who had been there before us. Well, they\ncould have been miserable and started hitting each and every one. But whoever came and\nstarted to rebel, we would tell them, \"Don't say anything. Just have your hair cut. It's not the\nworst.\" And people -- only some people would say, \"But my husband is Aryan. Why should\nyou cut my hair?\" And then the whole thing started to explode a little bit. I watched this for\nquite some time, and it was horrible.\n*\u201d Outside work (German)",
        "A: Zippy always worked near the sauna. She would work in the political -- she would come by,\nand she would ask questions and she would come around. And she would talk to the\nnewcomers, because Zippy speaks more than one language. My language was German,\nnothing else. And that was a bit hard, you know. Speaking -- you know, speaking German\nonly was for the other inmates like I spoke the language of our enemies, you know, of the\nNazis. So many a times, they thought \"Are you Jewish?\" I said, \"Yes, Iam.\" \"How come you\nspeak German?\" So, you know, for survival you do anything. It didn't take me long, and I\nlearned how to speak the Slovak language. I spoke it so well -- unfortunately, I don't speak it\nanymore -- that I went after the war to Czechoslovakia and they thought I was born there. So\nI learned a different language, and it got me a little further, I suppose.",
        "A: Well, I got to know them, yeah. I got to know them. Well, this little girl, Shayna, who took\nme in and said, \"Take her number,\" I worked with her. And she spoke Yiddish only, you\nknow, and she had a little sister. They were beauticians. They were manicurists and\nbeauticians, but I was nothing. I had no idea. And I remember that was my first experience I\nhad with Yiddish. Now, Yiddish sounds pretty much like German, you know. A little bit. For\na Yiddish-speaking person, the German is like a distorted Yiddish, but for a German-\nspeaking person, Yiddish is a distorted German. So I, that's when I learned how to speak\nYiddish, too.\nSo I learned two languages in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Most of the girls, like Zippy, they spoke so many languages, and they spoke Slovak, and you\nknow, it's a Slawisch - language. Once you know how to speak the Slovak language, you can\nunderstand Polish, too, so I understood a little Russian, a little Polish. I understood quite a\nbit, so it was okay. Except for Hungarian, that language I could never catch on. That was too\nmuch for me.",
        "A: Yeah, Rose Farkas worked with me. She was in the same Kommando\u201d\", so called. And I\nremember her, but she had been in Auschwitz for quite some time. I was a newcomer to\n30 ;\nSlavic (German)\n*' Commando (German)\nthem, and now, I'm an old lady, but then I was the youngest of them all. And it seemed that\nall the girls, you know, they were very sweet to me. I was the little kid, the new little kid on\nthe block. So they took very good care of me. We didn't have Schindler, we didn't have\nanyone. We helped each other.",
        "A: Well, that's a long story. I'll make it as short as I can.",
        "A: Well, when I worked in the sauna, you know, I couldn't hold my stool because I had diarrhea\ncontinuously. And the Kapo of the sauna was a German woman. She was a lady of ill repute,\nso she was not very nice or very neat. And she had nasty things to say, and when she seen\nthat I was just a -- I couldn't walk anymore, and wherever I went -- I hate to say it -- but\nsomething dropped. The girls would just take a pail of water and wash it away, and she\nwould say, \"So what's wrong with that one here? She belongs to Block 25.\" Block 25 was\nthe death camp -- death block. And the girls said, \u201cNo, no, no, no, no. She is okay. Not to\nworry. She is working hard. Nothing.\" And they protected me, you know, they protected me\nfrom all sides. Why, I don't know, but I really, like I said, I was a young kid and they were\nall a little older. Zippy 1s maybe about seven years older than I am. So they felt they had to\nrachmones\u201d with me.

        "A: It went on for a long time. You don't -- it helped. The coal, the lemon peel, that was my\nmedication, and it helped me. It helped me to survive for quite some time.",
        "A: No. That was a no-no. If you went to the hospital, you stayed there because you would never\ngo out again, no matter what. So I had to, because my father had said, \"You have to survive,\nand you will survive.\"\nAnd I had that in me that, \u201cIt's going to be all right.

        "A: I don't know whether they took all of us. I believe when the Greek transports came, like this\nRollie and Stella, they were beauticians. They took them into that Kommando, but I was out\nof the Kommando. But I went, instead of cutting hair, I went to the Bekleidungskammer, \u201d\nwhich was close by. There we cleaned the clothes. It was like a cleaning outfit. We, people\nwere getting undressed, we had to sort their stuff and then put it through machines and --\ncalled the Entlausung.\u201d* So I worked there for a while then. That also better than going\noutside and building barracks.",
        "A: Well, you were near sort of an oven. It wasn't that cold. It wasn't always warm, but when you\nslept at night, you were cold in the corner. It was kind of cold, freezing. But by then, of\ncourse, once I got into the sauna, I got a pair of shoes. Not shoes, but those things you wear\nin Holland. What do you call them?",

        "A: I don't know. Somehow I think somebody up there was watching over me.

There were other\npeople that did the same thing, and their toes were frozen off. Quite a few.\n*\u00b0 Dressing room (German)\n* Delousing station (German)",

        "A: Very easily, because we worked in the sauna. The gas chambers were very close by. So we\nseen the chimney smoke, that's all we seen. We didn't see transports going in there.\nMaybe they did that at night, but we seen the chimney smoke and it was peaceful. We didn't\nhear anything, we didn't hear anybody cry. We didn't hear anybody scream. We did hear\nmusic play when the transports marched in and out to work. AuBenarbeit, so to speak, but\nyou did not hear any screaming in the gas chambers because people who went into the\ncamps -- into the gas chambers didn't know where they were going. So while I was working\nin the sauna and doing the entlausen\u2019\u2019, disinfection, they asked me to go to the crematorium\nand get some blue gas. Whether they needed that for the clothes or they needed it to wash the\npeople off to take lice away and entlausen -- I don't recall. All I recall 1s that I went, of\ncourse, not alone. There was an SS woman walking with me to the gas chambers. I was\nsupposed to get two bottles of Zyklon B\u2019\u2019, or whatever they called it. A liquid gas. And, I\nwent, and this lady went with me with her gun, of course. And I asked the\nSonderkommando\u2019\u2019, the man, to get me what I was supposed to get. So he opened the\nwrong door. He must have opened the wrong door. I just stood there, and I seen these people\npiled into the gas chambers. Not saying a word, they were all dead. They were all piled in\nthere. They couldn't even fall down because they pushed them all in there, and I just looked\nand I said, \"This is impossible.\" Of course, I had known all along that was happening, but to\nsee 1S to believe it. And then I came back to the sauna. I never told anybody. I was so\nhorrified, I didn't want other girls to feel bad and get nightmares. I had them. You see\ngrownups with children and everything, yet standing up. They were not taken out yet, and\nthey were not gassed. They were not burned yet, so quickly he closed the door. He was very\nembarrassed that he opened the wrong door, and this SS woman escorted me back into the\ncamp. And, like I said, I never told anybody until a few years ago I was interviewed by\nsomeone and then it took me a long time to even talk about it. That was the experience I had\nwith the gas chambers.\n* Delousing (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Cyclone B (German)\n*7 Special commando (German); term used for Jewish prisoners selected to work in the gas\nchambers and crematoria.",
        "A: I don't think so.",
        "A: I didn't talk to anybody about it because I don't think I told ever anybody except Nina who\ninterviewed me after the Washington Together\u201d -- Togetherness, but otherwise, I didn't tell\nanybody. But it's now not as bad to talk about it anymore. It was very hard for me to even\nopen up to see this horror.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was nothing to her, she had probably seen it a million times.",
        "A: No. Nothing. It was okay. As a matter of fact, you know, the SS women -- all the transports\ncame from Poland, from Czechoslovakia, from Greece, from Italy. Everybody brought\nbeautiful clothes and I had been working in the sauna. I had to put this stuff into the\nmachines. They used to say, \"Well, this is nothing. Just wait till the American people come.\nWhen we get the clothing of the American Jews, then we really have clothes.\" So, obviously,\nthey were very sure of themselves that the American Jews will eventually end up in the gas\nchambers, too. So that was my experience with the gas chambers in Auschwitz. , what I\nwanted to say, by that time, you know, in Auschwitz most of our girls who had come with\nme from Berlin had already died except for one. She was a young girl, she was 19; I was 17.\nBy then maybe she was 20 and I was 18. I passed -- I walked in the LagerstraBe and I seen\nher laying there, and I said to her, \"What's the matter?\" She says, \"Well, I'm going to die. I\ncan't hold out.\" But she says, \"You're a young girl. You're going to --\" She says, \"You're\ngoing to make it, ... and I want you to tell the world what they did to us.\" And I held her in\nmy arms and she died. And I said the \u201cShema\u2019\u2019,\u201d that was the right thing for me to do and I\nwalked away.\nIt was an everyday happening in Auschwitz, you just seen your friends on the street and\ndying. She was a very nice girl, and I really felt that she was going to make it, but there was\nno way. People could not endure all the stress and all the strain and no food and wintertime.\n*> American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors (Washington, DC)\n*\u201d See \u201cShema Israel.\u201d\nThat was a very, very bad experience for me. That was something that I will never forget. I\nhad known this girl from childhood on. And even today sometimes I see a woman, an older\nwoman, who -- she was very short -- and I look at her and I say, \"She probably would have\nlooked like--\" Bertel was her name -- \"she probably would have looked like that today.\" She\nwould have been an old lady by now, but at that time she was 19 years old, beautiful and\neverything. Couldn't make it, no chance. And so by then all, most of the girls from Berlin\nhad passed away, had been killed, or had been shot, or didn't want to live anymore. And we\nwere just with the girls who were there, and we again made close ties with each and every\none because everybody had one reason; that was to survive. Stick to one another and survive.\nAnd there was one thing I must say. Somebody in Auschwitz, and I think they must be from\nCzechoslovakia, maybe from Poland by the name of Carola Stern, and that person must have\ndied. And she got some sardines from the Red Cross from Switzerland, and she was no\nlonger there, so they gave it to me. This was the most fortunate thing I had, so I had about\nfour cans of sardines, and I could buy myself, you know, a piece of bread or something like\nthat. They also gave us a piece of salami, like once a week. And being that I was so\nOrthodox, I wasn't going to eat it, I exchanged it for bread. Later on I found out that I didn't\nhave to do that, I could have eaten it. But that was my religion which wouldn't allow me to\neat any unkosher food, even in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Uh-huh, with another person. And sometimes if you exchange it for a pair of underpants you\nknow. Anything, and sometimes, you know, whatever.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I don't really -- I never took clothes. Because the clothes was dirty, you know. You had to go\nthrough a machine first. They came out on the other end. Maybe the people who were on the\nother end could. What I did I assorted the clothes dirty, you know. Maybe I did take a thing\nor two; it's possible. I don't recall ever taking anything because by then they had given me a\nblack uniform, a black -- I had something to wear and the clogs. So I was happy with what I\nhad, I didn't really -- I got a jacket, yeah. We did organize -- they called it \u201corganization.\u201d\nWe stole a few things, let's put it that way, if we could.",
        "A: Yes. All the time because they wanted us to. They didn't want the hair to grow. But then the\nhair grew back slowly, you know. But after a week -- a month or so, they would always cut\nif off again until later when I worked in the Bekleidungskammer they didn't cut their hair\nthat much anymore. Sort of skipped it once or twice, so my hair grew back and I looked a\nlittle bit more normal than I did before.",
        "A: Well, you had to keep yourself clean; otherwise, you had lice and whatever. So we went to\nthe toilets, whatever water kept running there, we did wash ourselves off.

But if we got to some water or\neven during the snowy season we would take a little bit snow, and we would let it stand in\nour Schiissell*\u00ae or whatever we had. And we had some water, we kept washing ourselves.\nWell, we did not have our periods, you know. So we were not women. Obviously, they had\nput something in the food which women did not menstruate anymore. So we were easy to\nkeep ourselves clean. They did that, I forgot what they call it.

And everybody was so thin and so hungry to give blood was a\nhorrible thing, but they did. They had no other choice because that blood was sent to the\nfront, to the soldiers, Wehrmacht\". So I did, too. They took it from me, too. So I did that for\na while, that was -- that is besides when no one came for a day or so, that was my job then.\nSo, of course, people cried, they didn't want to do it, but there was no other choice.

Not only that, a lot of Hungarians had the good blood type, blood\ntype B, I believe is the good blood type.\nAnd they took it again and again because that was the type they wanted for their soldiers. I\nbelieve it's B, the best blood type. And they had to give it. Of course, they were weak. They\nwere weak to begin with. They got weaker after that.",

That's where we got an extra jacket or something. If somebody\ndied, you took it from them, and you cried with everyone who died who was killed or didn't\nget up anymore in the morning. But life had to go on. Life and death. There was more death\nthan life, but that's how it was in Auschwitz. It was like a very quiet street when I watched\nthe movie \"Shoah.\" I seen that silence, that silence. That's how it was. It was very silent, you\ndidn't hear anything.

        "A: It was quiet. Because, you know, you get to a point when you're so hungry, you have nothing\nto say to each other anymore. When you're so desperate for food and so starved for love and\nfor your family, there's very little to say.\nAbsolutely nothing. At the end, we hardly talked to each other. There was no spirit. What\ndoes a young person do? They talk about boyfriends. And we had nothing to talk about.\nThere was nothing. They had take the dignity and everything away from us. There was\nabsolutely nothing left.",
        "A: We always did. Yeah, we always did. They always told us what they did at home, and what\ntheir father and mother did and what a good life they had at home and we talked about it.",
        "A: We had a sort of a Lager\u201d song. Yes, we did -- we didn't -- we heard the music, you know,\nwhen people marched in and out. And yes, there was a song in Auschwitz, too. But we really\ndidn't sing much, no. We didn't...",
        "A: Yeah, I do. Very vaguely, but I do. Let me think.... It doesn't come to me at the moment, but\nI'll remember it maybe later on. Yeah.",
        "A: Viennese waltzes and things like that. Good music, Beethoven and very good music, because\nthe Nazi officers, the SS, liked good music so they played it for them. And there musicians,\ngirls, yes. They had training, and sounded very good, very nice.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It was horrible. It was -- the gas chamber was here and the music was playing. I mean, it was\nironic, you know. It was terrible.",
        "A: No, I didn't know that. I think she played an instrument, yeah.",
        "A: Well, in the barrack in Auschwitz, I was with only Jews, but, I had, you know, Kapos, I got\ntogether with Gentiles, yes. They were prisoners, too. They were -- the one with the blue\nWinkel over the -- I can't think of the name now. Bibelforscher\u2122 -- they were Jehovah's\nWitnesses, right. And there were the black Winkel that was the prostitutes. The red Winkel\nwas the politische -- the Communists and whatever. So each and every one had a -- they\nweren't all Jewish.\n2\n43\nCamp (German)\n\u201c Biblical scholar (German); term used to refer to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\nThere were Polish Gentiles, and they were from all over. All kinds of people that we dealt\nwith, and you spoke to them, too, of course.",
        "A: A Gentile prisoner? Not really. No. Later on I remember Gypsies in the last camp. Yes, I do.\nBecause there were, -- that could read your hand, and -- do you want me to tell that story?",
        "A: Well, that was in the last camp. We were just sitting there, and it was a Sunday, I suppose.\nWe didn't do anything, we were just sitting together. The last camp I didn't work -- I worked\nin the kitchen. I was little waiter, and the Gypsies were sitting there. And they kept saying to\nus, \"Let me read your hand.\" They were Hungarians. \"Let me read your hand.\" And, you\nknow, reading your hand, telling the fortune, is not done in the Jewish tradition. We don't do\nthat, but I figured, \u201c\u201cWhat have I got to lose?\u201d And so I gave them my hand. I said, \"Go ahead\nand read it.\" So she read my hand and she said -- other girls translated for me -- she said,\n\"You're going to come of here, I want you to know, you're going to come out of here. You're\ngoing to meet a young man, someone you knew already from early childhood and you'll\nmarry him. And you're going to have a son and a daughter.\" And I said, \"You word in God's\near.\" I couldn't pay her, but that's all I could tell her. So she said, \"Okay, it's going to\nhappen.\" It did happen. I don't know, it did happen. It really did. That was a very strange\nthing, but I never forget it. I always remembered the Gypsy who gave me, told me her\nfortune -- my fortune.",
        "A: Well, yes, I did at one point. That was at the first four weeks we were in Auschwitz. There\nwere two girls that were half Jewish, and they didn't want to go on. They wanted us to bury\nthem under, under the barracks, and we did. We shoveled stuff over them, and they went\nunderneath that. And when it was time to go home, Taube * -- Taube was the Aufzahler.\u201d\u00b0\nHe counted us, and there were two missing. And, my God, he put the dogs on us and\neverything. He had the dogs shovel them out. The dogs captured them and they shoveled\nthem out. They wanted to escape, go back to Germany. That was about the only thing where\nI was a witness of -- I helped them shovel in there.\nI -- we kept saying, \"Don't do that, don't do that.\" They said, \"Yes, yes, yes, yes.\" So we did.\n* Adolf Taube\n*\u00b0 Counter (German)",
        "A: I don't recall what happened to them. They certainly weren't treated very well, that's for sure.\nWhat happened to them, I don't remember. It was in the beginning in 1943. So, maybe they\ngot to Auschwitz the first four weeks, so I really don't remember. What happened to the girls.\nThat was a no-no.",
        "A: No. Well, we had all kinds of things there. They didn't give us any food for a day. We\nshouldn't have done that. All kinds, we were, we had punishment there. All kinds of things,\nbut nothing major happened. Nothing major. What happened to the girls, I don't know. I\nreally don't know.",
        "A: I have had the dogs put on me, yeah. Beaten? Beaten, I was like everybody else. You know,\nyou passed through there, and they took the whip and they just beat everybody who passed\nthrough. But not me personally beaten. If they felt like beating the people at the zahlappells,\nthey would beat. They would just take a whip and beat. But nothing that was sort, of like a\nmorning prayer.",
        "A: No, I only remember the long appells. There was never a short appell. It could have rained,\nand it could have snowed. It could have done anything. They let us stand there until they\nwere good and ready to come out and count us. Because, I mean, the Kapo, or what they\ncalled the Stubendlteste*\u2019, the one of the barrack, they would put us together and we would\nstand there. We had to wait for the SS person to come and count us again. And they took\ntheir good old time. Could be two hours in the rain, whatever. Well, all they wanted us to do\nis die right then and there, so why hurry up? That was the master plan.",
        "A: Not really, but when you spoke to them you had to address them in a certain manner. Like, in\nthe military, you know, because I had the experience later on talking to the\nObersturmfihrer\u00ae and otherwise, I never spoke to any of the SS, I really didn't. SS women,\nyes, they were there, and we didn't talk much to them really, no.\n*\u201d Room elder (German)\n** Lieutenant colonel (German)",
        "A: Teresa. Teresa. Well, there were other women, but I don't remember their names 1n particular\nbecause I really had no dealings. No dealings with them.",
        "A: Yeah. I have been -- I've been in the politische, yeah.",
        "A: It was -- if remember correctly, there were desks that were sort of make-believe desks, and\nthere were girls writing and doing whatever. And Zippy forever walked around with her little\ncharts and pencil and did whatever -- whatever she did, I don't really know, but I seen her\nalways hanging out there.",
        "A: I saw her, yeah. Saw her quite often. She was an all around person in Auschwitz. She was\nvery well liked, it seemed to me.",
        "A: Yeah, I know. Well, my opinion is that when I came to Auschwitz in 1943, the Slovakian\ngirls had been there already for a year and a half, I believe. They had lost everything. Their\nsisters or brothers or whatever they had, they were already dead. They were the pioneers of\nAuschwitz, and they were treated like dirt. Like dirt. So everybody was out to live, you\nknow. We all wanted to live, and we tried very hard to make the best of it. So when the other\nso-called Zugange\u201d inmates came into Auschwitz, they may have been harsh at times. Yeah,\nI've seen that quite often. Like I said before, when someone says, \"Well, I don't get my hair\ncut because my husband is Aryan,\" and so on, they would say, \"You're just as much of a Jew\nas Iam. Who do you think you are?\" They would get nasty with words, but never -- I mean, I\nhave never experienced anything like hitting or kicking or something like that. I've heard\nsome people say that, but it was -- where I worked it wasn't like that. As a matter of fact, the\ngirls who worked with me in the sauna some of them are still alive and have been really very\ngood to me. They have called me. They live in Israel. And, as a matter of fact, one was here\nin America. She's now a widow, and she came here and she asked me whether I was happy\nwith my marriage and I said, \"Yes, I am.\" I said, \"Why would you ask me?\" She says,\n\"Because I have enough. We could both live in Israel together because I would take you with\n* New comers (German)\nme.\" I thought that was very, very nice. I said, \"No, thank you.\"",
        "A: I cannot say anything, -- I can only say that they survived their way.\nEverybody survived their -- I can't say anything nasty about them really. They were out to\nlive and if something came across they didn't like, they would shout and they would maybe\nkick and maybe hit. I personally haven't seen it, but I have heard from plenty of people who\nsaid they were nasty. They weren't nice. But look, I was not their kind; I was a German Jew,\nand maybe I was young, I don't know. Maybe they felt I was a child, they were awfully nice\nto me. That's all I can say. And Zippy was exceptionally nice. Very, very nice.",
        "A: I think everybody knew her. Yeah. I asked some of my friends, \"Did you know Zippy?\" \"Oh,\nthe dark-haired girl? Sure, I knew her.\" Of course, she was always around. She was running\naround. Everybody knew Zippy, mostly everybody.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Right, right. Mostly with the girls who worked together, we were close with one another.\nAnd we helped each other with food, you know, and some of the girls smoked, which I didn't\ndo. But somehow, somehow they got cigarettes into the camps. How they got them, I don't\nknow. And it was a very close relationship with one another. Everybody was trying to help\none another without having a Schindler hanging on us, you know. We did for each other\nwhatever we could do to survive.",
        "A: You mean...",
        "A: Slovaks with them and Polish with them? I didn't see it, no. I seen two sisters fighting with\none another, and that was my first experience with the Yiddish language. And I couldn't\nbelieve it, like, they were very good with each other. They were really very sweet people.\nThey were beauticians, and one said to the other, \"You, you zolst vaksen vi a tsibele mit kop\nin der erd.\"\"\u201d Which I translated that in German. I was horrified, that's when I learned to\nspeak Yiddish. That means, \u201cYou should grow an onion with your head in the earth.\u201d Oh,\nmy God. That was a curse if you ever heard one. So I spoke to her and I said, \"Why would\nyou say that?\" \u201cBecause she did such stupid things.\u201d I don't know what she did, but there\nwere two sisters, so it couldn't have been all that bad. But things like that came up, you\nknow, where two sisters would fight with one another.\nWe were only human, you know, no matter what the situation.",
        "A: Yeah, there were men coming 1n, right, but not too many. There were people coming in. , we\ndidn't have that much of a connection with the men. Some girls had more than others, but, I\nmet a very nice person who later on helped me with lots of things. And, -- but there was not\nwhat you call a love affair going on in Auschwitz, but men were in there.",
        "A: He helped insofar if I tell the story now, you know. When the transports from Lodz came\ninto Auschwitz, I thought -- that was in June -- no, that was in August 1944, I thought that\nmy parents would be still alive. And I said to myself, \u201cNothing can happen to me anymore.\nIf I see the Obersturmfthrer\u201d -- and I forgot his name \u2014 \u201cI would go to him and I'll ask him if\nhe can bring my parents into the camp, provided they are still living.\u201d So as I walked on the\nstreet in Auschwitz, I see this Obersturmfthrer walking, and I went over to him. And then --\nwe were talking about how do you address an officer -- I went over to him, clicked my heels,\nand said, \"Herr Obersturmfthrer, sieben und dreising vier acht und sechzig, meldet sich.\"\u201d!\nWhich means \"37468 makes herself known.\" He says, \"What do you want?\" with a very\nstern voice. And he said, \"And how come you speak German?\" I said, \"I'm from Frankfurt,\"\nwhich I really wasn't, but Nieder-ohmen, nobody would have ever known. I said, \"Well, I\nwas born in Germany, and I wanted to ask you something. Do you go to the ramp to get the\npeople from the Lodzer ghetto?\" He said, \"Yah, yah.\" \u201cYes,\u201d he says, \"why would that\ninterest you?\" I said, \"Because my parents have been in the L\u00e9dzer ghetto since 1941, and\nsince the transports are coming now into Auschwitz, I would like to ask you if it's okay with\nyou, sir, to bring my parents into the camp. I'm here two years, and if that's possible, please\ndo that.\" So he looked at me like I was nuts, like chutzpa of a young girl. And he said, \"Your\nparents, where are they?\"\n*\u00b0 should grow like an onion with your head in the ground (Yiddish).\n>! Mr. Lieutenant Colonel, 37468 reporting (German).\nI said, \"Well, in Litzmannstadt.\" He said, \"Well, no, you can't go. But if you know of a man\nwho can -- if you know of a man, he can go.\" So I knew this man by the name of Bumeck\nStern, same name as mine. And I knew him, and I said, \"Yes, I do, and if the officer allows\nme to, I will get him.\" And he took this young man to the ramp and this Bumak called out\nthe names of my parents and my sister, and they weren't there anymore. There was no, no\nresponse. So he came back into the camp. Occasionally, he would come into the camp. He\nwasn't in my camp, you know, and he said, \"There was no response. I don't think your sister,\nnor your parents are alive.\" So I had to deal with that, I figured \u201cthat's it.\u201d And then\ntransports still came in...",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: You know, he was the Obersturmfthrer who was killed together with Grese.\u201d\u201d When I see\nhim together on the movies once, I recognized him. I don't recall. Zippy would know his\nname. Kramer,\u201d I believe.",
        "A: Kramer, I thought. I don't remember.",
        "A: My parents.",
        "A: Doesn't find anybody. But I -- are we on?",
        "A: I, I, didn't give up. I thought maybe the next transport. We didn't go to every transport,\nmaybe the next transport. So I, I didn't give up. And in July -- in August 1944, another big\ntransport came from Lodz, Litzmannstadt and I walked through the sauna thinking that if my\nmother -- my father wouldn't have been there anyway -- and my sister would be there, I\nwould just see them. My mother at that time was still a young woman. Maybe she was 41, 42\nyears old, and she was tiny. She looked tiny. And I walked through the aisles where people\nthe came in and their head -- their hair was already shaven, I think so. They already had --\nno, they didn't have a number on their arm yet. They were about to be bathed or whatever,\nshowered. And as I walked through the rows, through the aisle there, I hear a tiny voice say,\n\"Carola.\" And I turned around. It was my sister. And the reason she recognized me, it's a\nvery interesting story. When I as a child, I had a way of bending my arm completely back,\nand I walked like this.\nShe knows, I really don't know. She seen a woman walking, a girl walking with the arm like\nthat, and she said to her -- a girl was standing next to her, \"This is my sister.\" She says,\n\"What are you talking about? This couldn't be your sister.\" \"I noticed the arm,\" she said.\nAnd, and when I turned around after she called, \"Carola,\" it was my sister. And we hugged\n** Irma Grese\n> Josef Kramer\nand I wanted to know what happened to my parents, and she said they were all dead. And\nthat's where Grese was, Grese, \u201cthe Beast of Bergen-Belsen.\u201d She witnessed this thing, she\nseen me speaking to my sister and hugging my sister. And she stood there and cried.\nSomething nobody had ever seen before, and then she said to me, \"Carola,\" she heard my\nsister call \"Carola\"; otherwise, she wouldn't have known. She said, \"You don't have to worry.\nYour sister is going to stay with you now.\" And we hugged again, at least we are together.\nAnd whatever happens, we are together. And she said, \"Okay, there is nothing to worry\nabout. Your sister is going to be with you.\" So I was trying to hold on to my sister, but she\nhad to go through all kinds of different routines. Having, being tattooed. She was tattooed on\nthe inside because I felt that she didn't have to have -- in case she would survive, she has a\ntiny little tattoo. And I thought we would be together, but 1t was just a false promise. They\nsent her to a different camp, and I didn't know where she went. And once in a while, one of\nmy friends who went around -- my friend, Claire,, one of the Frankfurt girls, she would go to\nthe camp where she was in. And she would come back, and she says, \"Your sister is still\nalive. Your sister 1s still alive.\" She was in a different camp, and, I would hear from her once\nin a while. \"Not to worry, I'm still living.\" And I had hoped that maybe, you know, maybe\nthe Russians would come and we would, we would be free again, and we would get together.\nBut there was little hope, very little hope that we would be together. So it went on,, the\nmarch that was in 1944 in, in August. 1945 in January, the big march from Auschwitz\nstarted, and I didn't know where my sister was. I didn't know what was happening. She was\nalready so tiny and so skinny, I was afraid that she, she would be killed. She would have\nbeen killed already then. So we marched out of Auschwitz day and night, and late night and\nday.\nAnd we were in cattle cars and we went to Ravensbriick. And in Ravensbriick we stayed\nfour weeks, and I had no -- no sight of my sister. I didn't know where she was. We marched\nout of Ravensbriick, and from Ravensbriick we went supposedly to Malchow. We did go to\nMalchow, there was another march from Ravensbriick to Malchow day and night, day and\nnight. And I was already so weak, and we all were. One helped me on one side, the other on\nthe other side, and we slept walking. And that's how we went on, and whoever didn't do it\nlay down and they shot them. They didn't give them any chance; they shot the girls just night\nthen and there. So at one point I had to go to the bathroom. I didn't know what to do. And I\nwent out of my line and there was no bathroom, but there was barn. So I went into the barn. I\nsaid to the girls, \"I have to go to the bathroom, it's impossible.\" I went to the barn, I walked\ninto barn. My sister walked out of the barn. And so I said, \"Now, you're not going to be out\nof my sight anymore. You're going to be with me.\" And we did cling to each and she walked\nwith me. And everybody thought she was my little sister because she's small. And we stayed\ntogether from that day on \u2018til we were in Malchow, we stayed together. We were never\nseparated anymore. So that was one good thing that I had to the bathroom. That was a very\nunusual incident. So from the march on, we marched into Malchow. That was the camp\nwhere we hardly got any salt in anything. But I had a chance to work in their kitchen, and in\nthe kitchen what I did there is I did heat the kettles the to make the fire underneath, you\nknow. So what we really -- what the girls cooked there was water, potato peels, and a little\nbit of farina. Not farina, oatmeal. And that made sort of a soup, but it was better than\nnothing. So at least I had a little soup I could give my sister and my friends, Claire, who was\nwith me and Martha. Two of the girls from Frankfurt survived with me. We were together,\nand I had a chance to give them a little extra soup. I added a little hot water and it was good.\nBut we got thinner and thinner every day because they took away the salt. But that's where\nwe laid around, and that's where we talked to the Gypsies and we talked about food and\ntalked about better times which we felt we will never see. And across from us was a camp\nwith English prisoners, and they looked just as bad as we did.\nIt was just across from the camp we were in. They were also laying around, like, you know,\nlike, like dead animals. You know, when you go to a zoo and sometimes and those animals\nlook like tranquilized, that's what we all looked like. We were just either waiting to die or\nbeing liberated. Something had to happen to us, we couldn't go on anymore. And then that\nwas in February, and we talked about that maybe we're getting liberated. Maybe the\nRussians were coming closer, but we had no newspaper. Nobody knew anything. All of a\nsudden at the beginning of May, the Nazis, the SS came running in and they kept screaming,\n\"Get out of here you dirty Jews. Get out of here. Let's go. Walk.\" Now, we figured \u201cwhere\nare we walking now?\u201c We could hardly move anymore. They walked us into the woods. We\nwere so sure that in the woods they were going to shoot us. Because it was coming closer,\nthe war was getting -- coming to an end, we felt. And why in the woods? So they marched us\ninto the woods, and all of a sudden in the woods -- it was, I think it was May the 3rd, or was\nit -- maybe it was a different -- maybe May the 8th. I think it was May the 3rd. They all\ndisappeared, there were no Nazi uniforms. They were either they had their private uniform,\ntheir clothes in a package. The SS men disappeared; there were none. And all of a sudden we\nsee a tank with three young American soldiers screaming from the top of their lungs, \"You\nguys are free. Hitler 1s dead. You're free, you're free.\" And they had -- I remember they had\nchocolate. There was a quite a few of us. They had chocolate and cigarettes, and they threw\nit out of the tank, and they threw it down for us. It wasn't enough for all of us, and we -- my\nsister looked at me and said, \"Did you hear that? We're free.\" I said, \"Yes, but where are we\ngoing to be?\" We were free, we were happy, but no place to go. But, we had more than other\npeople because we had each other. So while we were sitting around in the woods, we all got\ntogether and, \u201cWe got to do something. Where are we going? We're not going to go back to\nGermany.\u201d So one of the girls, Slovak girls, said, \"I lost two sisters in Auschwitz. I'm not\ngoing home alone.\nYou two girls are going with me.\" So we traveled from Malchow to Czechoslovakia, my\nsister and I. And we came there, and to our surprise her parents were still there. Her little\nbrother was there, and they greeted us with open arms. For the first time we seen parents\nagain and people who were good to us. Gave us clothes, gave us food, and it was like such a\nrelief. It was unbelievable. We stayed there four weeks, and they fed us. And, of course, we\nhad only one wish, to come to the United States. So no matter they did, my sister and I\nlooked at each other and I, I remember my father, my mother had told me that I should\nremember an address in New York City. It was \u201c648 184th Street in New York City;\u201d that\nwas my aunt's address. And I said to my sister, \"You know, I know Tante Anna's address.\"\nAnd she said, \"No, you don't.\" I said, \"Yes, I do.\" I said, \"If I get only to that address, then\nwe'll be fine.\" Well, there no one -- you know, you couldn't do anything. I mean, we went in\nthe nighttime, early in the morning we went over the border from Czechoslovakia to Austria.\nAnd the border was like a train -- what do you call the train, what the train goes on?",
        "A: A train track. And on one side the Russians stood, and they wanted to shoot when they seen\ntwo little girls, two young girls coming there. So I said to them -- I knew a little bit Russian, I\nsaid I was a Gypsy and I looked like one. My hair had grown by then, and it was long and a\ncomb I didn't have. And I said I was Gypsy -- and it was pitch black because I was a blonde\nbefore. \"My father lives in Austria, and we want to go to Austria.\" Would they let us\nthrough? They said no, they had to shoot us. And we said, \"No, no, no. We can't be shot. We\nhave to get through here and just close your eyes. Turn around. Let us go.\" So they said,\n\"Okay, close your eyes.\" And we closed our eyes. \"Go right through, but when you get over\nthe border there will be the Americans. They're going to be shooting at you.\" Well, there was\nno American shooting at us. The Americans were fast asleep, it was five o'clock in the\nmorming. And we got into Austria. Once we were in Austria, we went to the train station. We\nfigured that was the right thing to do. And there we seen other survivors. Why would we\nknow that they're survivors? They looked like us. They had not much clothes, and they said\nto us, \"You, you must be\" -- at that time they were called \u201cKZ ler,\u201d \u201cconcentration camp,\"\nyou know.\nAnd we said, \"Yes, we are.\" And they said, \"We'll take you to a DP camp.\" So they took us\nto a DP camp, and we lived in Austria until we were ready to come to America, in Gmunden,\nin Kammer-Schorfling. And through the help of the American soldiers which we met in\nAustria, they were stationed in Austria, we wrote to my aunt. And my aunt got the letter, and\nshe was overwhelmed that we were alive, but, of course, everyone else had died. My\ngrandparents and whatever. And she sent us food and she sent us clothing, and we were\nsaved. We came to America in 1946 in July. It was a year and three months after the\nliberation, which was good. That\u2019s where -- and after I was here for a little while, my aunt\nthought it would be wise to put it in the newspaper. Tell everybody that we are alive, but\nthere was like the German Jewish newspaper called the Aufbau\u2019. She, she put it in there, and\nmy husband read it and he came to visit me. And that's when we later on got married. So the\n\"4 Konzentrationslager [concentration camp] (German)\n\u00bb\u00b0 Reconstruction (German); popular periodical of the German-Jewish community in America.\nGypsy was right, I married the guy I knew from way back when, and I had a son and a\ndaughter. And now I have five grandchildren, and I have a lovely daughter-in-law and a\nlovely son-in-law. And I have my own family, thank God. That's something I never would\nhave dreamt of, something I thought it would never, so I marched into Auschwitz and I was\none of the lucky ones who marched out. Not many did. ... Now, my friend, Martha, survived,\nand she lives here partly. And the other one lives in Queens, and Zippy lives in Manhattan.\nAnd I have the two other friends in Israel, and that's about it.",
        "A: Yes, we do. We call each other once every so often. Now, distances are pretty far, but we do\nspeak to one another. We call each other and we try to keep up the friendship.",
        "A: Yeah. They are my closest friends. You know, like you said \u201cLagerschwesters\u201d -- besides\nmy sister, Martha is like a sister to me, Claire is like a sister to me.\nWe, we don't see each other all that often, but we call each other and we get together to\nweddings and Bar Mitzvahs, whatever is to celebrate. We, we kept that friendship.",
        "A: Not really, no. We really don't. Once 1n a while, 1f someone asks us, we bring up the subject\nbut, we try not to. But I remember one incident I had and this was also friend who worked in\nthe sauna with me, a Czechoslovakian girl. We had a bakery in Washington Heights, and she\ncame in one day. And she didn't know me, but I recognized her. And she asked me for a loaf\nof bread, and I looked at her, and I said, \"B6zsi\" So she said to me, \"Could I have a loaf of\nbread, please?\" And I said, \" Bozsi, you can have all the bread in the world. I have all the\nbread you want.\" And she looked at me, and she said, \"Am I supposed to know you?\" And I\nsaid, \"Yes, you know me quite well. I'm Carola.\" And she says, \"Really? I can have all that\nbread?\" That's something we only wanted, one loaf of bread and call it our own.",
        "A: Yes.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Camp sisters (German)\nthings, other than with the letter?",
        "A: No, they gave us help. As a matter of fact, we got a uniform because we didn't have decent\nclothes really. We got a uniform like the American soldiers and on it here, it had the sign DP,\ndisplaced persons. So we, we -- the Germans thought we were Americans, I guess, except we\ndidn't speak the language. We were well taken care of there. They gave us food and\neverything. And, of course, we made connections. We met one soldier who came from\nChicago who was originally from Germany, and he had been in the army. A very -- one very\ninteresting story, I forgot to tell you that. And we were sitting in the -- what is 1t? They called\nthe clubs PX, PX clubs, right? We were sitting there in the nightclub in Austria with this\nparticular young man. I had met him in the synagogue on a Friday night, and he said that I\nwas the first German Jew he had met. All were Polish Jews, and where did I come from. So I\ntold him and we talked to each other, and he said he will get in touch with my relatives and\ntell them that I'm living, my sister and me.\nWhich was very nice, and he offered to take us, my sister and me, to the club and there you\ncould have something to eat and something to drink. And you could dance a little bit, and\nsomething we didn't have in years. And all of a sudden I'm sitting in the club, and I see this\nsoldier sitting there. And I look at this young soldier I was with and I said, \"You know, I\nknow this guy.\" So he looked \u2014 he says, \"Where would you know this guy from?\" I said,\n\"That soldier went to school with me in Germany in Bad Nauheim.\" He says, \"Are you\nkidding me?\" \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, \"I'll ask him.\" So he's sitting there and he calls, you know, he\nsays to him, \"Hey, listen, listen.\" And I said to him, \"But his name isn't \u2018Listen.\u2019 His name is\nMax Bettman.\" So he said -- I didn't know the language that well. So he said, \"Is your name\nMax Bettman?\" And he said, \"Yes.\" And he said, \"Do you know this lady?\" And he looked\nat me and said, \"No.\" I looked at him and I says, \"I'm Carola,\" and he says, \"Oh, no.\" He\ncouldn't believe it, that he went to school with me, and his father was the principal of the\nschool. And he also helped to bring us to the United States, his father, yeah. And only about\nthree years ago we had a reunion where I invited all the kids who survived from Bad\nNauheim, and he was there, Max Bettman. He didn't remember that I said, \"This is Max\nBettman,\" he didn't, you know. He had forgotten. But I, the funniest part was that when I\nsaid, \"Don't call him Listen. His name is Max Bettman.\"",
        "A: After the war? After -- in Austria?",
        "A: Yeah, I did work -- since my first love always has been nursing, and I had a little training in\nGermany in Berlin, while I was in camp I had been sick quite often. And while I was in the\nBerlin and I had an ear infection, they always kept me a little longer in the hospital because\nthey knew that my first love was nursing. So I stayed there and took the temperatures of\npeople and they gave me uniform, whatever. And, when I was liberated, I worked in an\nArmy, American Army hospital for a little while. Not for too long, but for a few days. I just\nwanted to -- it was hard because I didn't speak the language, and they kept calling me\n\u2018Fraulein,\u2019 and I didn't want to be called \u201cFraulein.\u201d That's all the Americans knew, they,\nyou know, heard by one thing or the other.\nBut, I could take temperatures then, too, and pulse, then take the blood pressure and that was\nokay.",
        "A: My sister also worked a little bit. Yeah, she, she met an American soldier, and I think what\nshe did -- he was a dentist. She worked a little bit in a dental office or something. If I'm not\nmistaken, I think that's what she did. But for a little while because we only stayed there a\nyear and went to America. So we weren't too long in Austria, but we recuperated. And\nAustria 1s a beautiful country, really nice, and we regained our strength and it was good. It\nwas nice.",
        "A: Maybe two, three months. You know, because we were young. You know, we were 20; 19,\n20, whatever. We were pretty young, so it doesn't take too long. We got food. It took us a\nwhile to adjust. I remember I was quite sick. Something went wrong with my intestines, I\nhad very often terrible cramps. Because you had to really get used to food again; we had no\nfood whatsoever. And if you ate anything fatty, the gallbladder acted up, so it was quite\nhectic for me to get used to. But the minute I sat my foot on an American boat to come to\nAmerica, I never had another attack of pain. It may be psychological. The minute I entered --\non the boat, everybody was sick. Everybody was throwing up, that was a natural thing. But I\nnever had another gallbladder attack. And I was examined in Austria. For the gallbladder had\nbent, or was out of shape, or something like that. So somehow I felt I was safe, on safe\nground, in coming to America.",
        "A: I didn't find it difficult. The only difficulty I had, I remember going to the movies with the\nAmerican soldiers, and I heard a woman say, \u201cDie Juden machen sich wieder.\"\u201d\u2019 \u201cThe Jews\nmake themselves known again.\" You know, that was my experience in Austria, so that was\nright after the war. There was people who were very antisemitic. I'm sure today 1t wouldn't\n>\u2019 The Jews are making themselves again (German).\nbe like that anymore, but at that time they noticed -- well, it wasn't written all over us that we\nwere Jews, but, they recognized it. Somehow they recognized this. It was so instilled in them\nto get rid of the Jews that they had no other way but act up on it. Not to look at the Jews and\ndestroy them any which way. We were like, like vermin, no-good people.",
        "A: Did I date in the DP camp? , yes, I did. I think I did. Yeah. I had met my friend again,\nBumak. He came to the -- he was in -- I don't remember where he was. He came and I\nvisited. He visited a few times, and well, there were young American soldiers and there was\na little dating going on. Most of the girls found their husband right then and there, you know.\nGot married with them. I didn't, I wanted to go to America.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "A: Okay. Where were we?",
        "A: 1950.",
        "A: '46. Right. He came to visit. And well, he had been a friend of mine in at school in Bad\nNauheim, but we didn't want to get married. I mean we were just good friends, and thing\nwere very lonely for me when I came to America, you know. He had been in the Army and\nhe spoke the language, and I sort of spoke it okay. And he was very good, and he -- I had\ntold him my whole story. He always wanted to know more and more. He was very warm\nbecause in the beginning it was very hard for me. First of all, I didn't know the language too\nwell. Second of all, when you rode in the subway and it was in the summertime and you\nwere exposed, a number of people would walk away from you and say, \"What in the world 1s\nthat? She has a number on her arm.\" There weren't too many of us at that time in 1946, and I\nfelt very isolated, very lonely. And if you wanted to tell actually what happened to you,\npeople used to say, \"Don't tell me that. I won't sleep tonight. I don't want to hear your story.\"\nI mean I didn't tell people on subways, but my own relatives -- they were awfully nice to me,\nthey were really good. But they didn't want to hear our stories because they were getting on\nin years, and they didn't really want to be bothered. My aunt, I told the story, and then, \u201cIt's\nenough. I won't sleep tonight.\u201d So, therefore, no one did anything. Of course, we were not\nAmerican citizens. We couldn't afford a psychiatrist or anything like that.\nWe were just -- we were just people who had to get into the mainstream of life, you know,\nand we tried very hard. We didn't -- German wasn't spoken in America because the war had\nended. If you spoke German, they looked at you like you were a Nazi. So we had to speak\nthe language which was good, I suppose. And we got together with our own people, people\nwho were in camps. And very often I heard from people who had come here previously, I\nheard them say, \"Well, these people who were in camps, they behave awfully strange.\" And\nI'm a sensitive person, I didn't like to hear that. We did behave awfully strange, but nobody\ntook in consideration what we had actually gone through. So it got to a point where we sort\nof separated ourselves from everyone, and we said -- we got together on social occasions,\nonly the survivors, the ones who survived. But we went to work and we started a new life,\nand we got into the mainstream. And I went, -- I knew how to sew which I had learned in\nFrankfurt. I went into the factory and I made piecework, worked in a blouse factory. And it\nwas in 1946, 7, I made $80 a week, which was a fortune. And everyone around me hated me\nbecause at that time we were piece -- they were pieceworkers, and if you worked too fast you\nruined the prices for the other people. I didn't know that. I did it as fast as I could because I\nwanted to make money in the worst way. So that was pretty tough, but I made it. I mean I\nhad an average of $60, which was pretty nice in 1946 and seven when really people didn't\nmake too much money. And then I paid the money to my uncle and aunt who let me stay\nthere. You know, and my aunt cooked for me, and I lived there. And it was very cozy and\nvery nice, and then my husband would come and take me out for dinner. My husband, he\nwasn't -- he was just a boyfriend -- would take me to the movies and things like that. And\nfrom then on, life got a lot easier for me.",
        "A: After the war?",
        "A: I didn't really. The only schooling I had was going to a parent's class when I pregnant with\nmy son to learn how to be a mother. That was also not easy. You see, when you're young and\nyou don't have a mother and don't have a father, and people sort of -- you had to do it all on\nyour own. But we did it, we really worked hard.\nWe helped one another. \u201cYou do it this way, I do it that way. You bathe the baby.\u201d I took the\nmother's class -- yeah, that was the only schooling I had because I had to make a living; I had\nto work.",
        "A: My sister got pregnant and she lost the first baby. I was really the one who had the first. My\nson was the firstborn.",
        "A: My sister lived in Baltimore, so she couldn't really help too much. They separated us, which\nwe didn't really like. But my sister went to college again in business college in Baltimore.\nSome other relatives of ours lived in Baltimore, and so she stayed there and she met her\nhusband there. So it was all for the better. She had hers in Baltimore, and she still lives in\nBaltimore again. She ended up in Baltimore.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: You know, there is such a thing, I guess it's called a \u201csurvivor.\u201d You just do it, you know.\nYou don't think about, you just do it. We had, we had such a strong will to survive in the\ncamps. When we -- once we were liberated, it was a piece of cake, you know, and you don't\nthink about it too much. You just go ahead and do it. Don't talk about it and do it. But when I\nthink back now -- I'm an old lady, and I think back at the time, the hard times we had, I\nsometimes don't understand how I survived it and how I did it. And how I -- later on we had\nthe bakery and I worked there, and it was all completely strange to me, bakery and whatever,\nbut I did it. And whatever I did, thank God, I was pretty good at it, so they tell me. So, at\nleast I know some through college, and my daughter or whatever, it was hard work to do all\nthat. And we wanted -- they denied us a free education in Germany. Maybe I could have\ngone to nursing school, but I didn't have the means and have the money, and so I didn't. But I\nwanted my children to have the education that everyone deserved, so we worked, both my\nhusband and I, we worked very hard to get our son through law school and the whole thing,\nyou know. So you just, I would say, get up and do it. Don't think back what has happened,\ndon't have pity.\nDon't look, look in the past, look 1n future.",
        "A: That's what I learned from it. And the other day my, my son was -- since we talked about tt,\nmy son was to make to speech how it was living with a mother who's a survivor. And, you\nknow, come to think of it, he said the same thing. He said, \"She didn't look back and she\ndidn't live in the past. She lived in the present, and she lives in the future.\" And, we never\ndiscussed the Holocaust in our house. We didn't cry -- if I cried, I cried on my own. I never\nshowed my kids that I was a poor Holocaust survivor. They never knew about that, I used to\npick him up when he was a baby and I used to hold him. And I used to say, \"They're never\ngoing to take you away from me,\" you know. And I really thought I had created something\nhere. You know I wanted to really hold onto him, and that he didn't know. I only knew that\nhe was so dear to me. Once I had this little boy in my arms, I thought the world belonged to\nme. And then another little girl, it was just wonderful. But I went on with life and didn't look\nback and I think I accomplished, after all this horror, I accomplished what I wanted to\naccomplish. Not quite, but I'm not finished yet. And like I listen and read the stories and I\nhear these kids saying -- of course, they're right -- they keep saying, \"We have to tell the\nstory because soon the survivors will be dead.\" So the kids who go through the March of the\nLiving say that, \u201cWe have to tell the story; therefore, we're going through the March of the\nLiving -- the Holocaust survivors will be dead.\u201d I don't want to hear it. I want to live for a\nwhile yet and tell my story. And I think maybe I will. With God's help, I will. Well, the\n\u2018\u201c\u201cShema\u2019\u201d I've been saying in Auschwitz, at the roll call, appell, I still say. If things get really\ntough and you know they have been. I've complained already in the meantime and I've had\nall kinds of diseases, I'll say my \u201cShema,\u201d I go on. So, basically, I wouldn't call myself a very\northodox person, but I would call myself an observer. And I think everybody should, in their\nown religion, should be observant. It will make for a better world.",
        "A: I do. Because I, I feel somehow, somebody looked out over me, looked out for me because\nnot too many people came out of this horror.",
        "A: Well, what they did to other people, yeah -- that in the beginning did destroy my whole\noutlook on life. That I have to admit. That was, \u201cWhere was God, you know, and why did\nthey do it? The Germans educated people, and, you know, why would they do a thing like\nthat?\u201d It is very much so threw me off everything 1n the very beginning. But then I noticed\nthat without God and without a belief, it's not for me. I can't go on like that, so I went right\nback to where I started out from. I really did. I tried to instill it into my kids, but they are not\nas observant as I am. But, to each his own. I don't preach to them, I let them do whatever\nthey want to because it has to come from you inside, so...",
        "A: Well, one thing I hope and pray that there is never a repetition of this horrible crime the\nGermans have done. I hope that they have a better life. It doesn't just go for my\ngrandchildren, it goes for all human beings, humankind. And these wars, unfortunately, in\nthe Middle East and all that, I hope will come to peace, eventually. That the whole world\nwill be at ease, there will be fights. No guns, no nothing. Guns should be completely\ndestroyed. There shouldn't be any of this, and people should live in harmony and peace. And\nI hope my grandchildren -- I won't see it anymore, but maybe my grandchildren will.",
