        "Q: Would you tell me your name please?",
        "A: I'm Ernest James.",
        "Q: Where were your born and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Ord, Nebraska, on April 23, 1920.",
        "Q: Would you tell me something about your childhood and family, growing up?",
        "A: Well, I came from rather a large family. There's nine of us, and incidentally they're, all\nbut one are still living and we get together a lot. Uh, uh, I was the next to the youngest of\nthe family. We were in a farming community in uh, central Nebraska. Uh, I had a very\nuh, good childhood. Uh, uh, graduated from high school in 1938, and immediately\nthereafter uh, in fact the day I graduated I got on the train and left for California, where I\nworked in uh, the U.S. Forest Service. Uh, I worked there until about 19 uh, oh 40. And\nthen with the war coming along uh, I decided that rather than be drafted I would uh, join\nthe Army. I joined the California National Guard. Uh, uh, we were called into active\nservice at uh, in March of 1941. I was in the infantry and had uh, basic training and rose\nuh, by uh, the time the war started I was a sergeant. Uh, we were uh, uh, right after Pearl\nHarbor we were called in to uh, be the defensive troops along the the coast in San\nFrancisco and I had a lot of experiences in uh, running patrols, uh, trying to uh, set it up\nso that if the Japanese came, why we could uh, keep them away. I uh, uh, was uh, I\napplied for officer's candidate school in the engineers in uh, June of 1942 and was\naccepted. Uh, went through training in Fort Belvoir and uh, uh, was commissioned as a\nSecond Lieutenant. Uh, I went up to Platsburg Barracks in New York where I had uh, I\nwas assigned to a com...engineer combat battalion and we trained our troops up there uh,\nuh, from about 19 uh, 19...through 1942. We then went uh, uh, overseas. Went down to\nNorth Africa about the time of the uh, that uh, Roosevelt was at the Yalta Conference,\nand uh, at that conference they decided to uh, that they're going to invade Europe so\nrather than go to the Far East, we went up to England where we prepared for the invasion.\nUh, after uh, uh, going for about several months in England training for the invasion, we\nwere ready and in uh, June we uh, uh, got on our ships and our trip, our troops were some\nof the first that landed on D-Day uh, uh, in Normandy. Uh, we uh, were involved in\nvirtually all of the uh, combat operations of the 1st Army in 7th Corps. Uh, captured\nCherbourg and and the uh, uh, Battles of St. Lowe (ph) and uh, uh, moving on through\nover to Paris uh, we turned north and went up to Belgium, through uh, uh, through\nBelgium and in Aucken (ph) we were uh,...one of the things that I remember was uh, how\nwonderful the people were in France and Belgium, but the minute we hit Aucken uh,\npeople were somber. They resented us and uh, uh, it was there we first started uh, getting\nthe feeling that uh, uh, the Germans were more...uh, were worst than just a uh, enemy,\nthat uh, we started hearing stories about uh, uh, the uh, concentration camps. Uh, I might\ngo back to a couple of recollections that I do have of uh, uh, the uh,...what was happening\nover in Germany. Back in 1938 uh,...well, maybe it was earlier than that, '36...",
        "Q: We really would like to stick with your story and what you experienced.",
        "A: Well, this 1s what I experienced. (Oh, OK.) Uh, uh, I discussed uh, the World War I with\nsome uh, with a gentleman that had uh, been in that, and he told me that uh, he felt that\nwe weren't finished with the Germans, that the Nazi uh, the Nazi uh, that were coming in\nuh, in power, uh, that there was going to be a war, and he impressed on uh, on me this.\nThen uh, in 1939 I met my first, I had my first contact and inkling that there was uh,\nsomething happening over there. I was with a church group and they sponsored a Jewish\nuh, family that came over, and I remember this this family...very brilliant people, and uh,\nwonderful people and they uh, they were Jewish. This was a Congregational Church.\nWell, they came in and uh, we got acquainted with them, and I remember talking to uh,\nthe daughter and she was telling me about how they were taking the Jewish people and\nputting them into camps, and this was in 1938 or '39. And uh, we couldn't, we couldn't\ncomprehend that that type of thing was happening. However, the church did sponsor\nseveral Jewish people coming uh,...Jewish families coming over and uh, wouldn't it have\nbeen wonderful if we had of known then what actually was happening, but that my...the\nfirst inkling that I had that anything such as this happened. Now, getting back to uh, uh,\ngetting back to uh, going into Germany, I had several uh, instances where we we found\nuh, people who were uh, displaced people from Poland and other uh, countries and uh,\nbut not a not a lot of them. Apparently, as we moved on through Germany, these people\nwere uh, were uh, carried back behind the German lines and as a consequence, only those\nthat may have hidden someplace uh, uh, were the ones that we saw. Uh, I do remember\none time...uh, it was uh, not too long before uh, we hit Nordhausen that uh, we went into\na large uh, oh German farm. It was a...there was a baron that was that had an estate and\nuh, he had virtually a castle, a small castle. Uh, we went into into this area and uh, uh,\nthere were a lot of uh, well, slave labors. Uh, uh, they were probably uh,...they were\nPolish, uh, possibly some Russians and there were some Italians there. Why there were\nItalians I don't know, but uh, uh, the baron uh, came out and asked me if I could do\nsomething about these horrible people that were uh, stealing all his food and we uh.....I I\nwas a platoon commander at the time, and uh, so he invited me in for some wine, and so I\nuh, went over to my uh, sergeant and asked him to get uh, two of our people. One was of\nPolish uh, extraction and could speak Polish and German. The other was Italian. His\nname of Pecares (ph). Well uh, they went over and talked to these people while I went in\nto talk to the baron. Well, I went in there and he had these beau...these beautiful uh, arms,\nguns and uh, medieval type armament on the wall and then uh, he had apparently been a\nbig game hunter. Uh, the uh, baron told me how horrible these people were and uh, uh,\nhow the Germans were uh, being uh, victimized by them. Well, in talking to this man...he\nhad uh, he had been an editor of a newspaper uh, somewhere in Germany and uh, in\nasking him about the Nazis, why of course he didn't know that all these things were\nhappening. Uh, uh, and he pointed out that he had opened up his, part of his home as a\nhospital. And he did. He had a hospital there. They were all uh, either wounded Germans\nor wounded civilians uh, that were in there. Uh, after uh, I had my glass of wine with\nhim, I went back to talk to the uh, to the Polish and the Italian men. Well their story was\nquite interesting. These people were kept in virtual slavery in this in this farm, and uh,\nthey uh, uh, they weren't allowed to have religious services. They weren't allowed to\nmarry. And one of the interesting things was uh, one of them told how they uh, if one, if a\nman and a woman wanted to get together...1ncidentally they all lived in in communal uh,\nuh, barracks in effect...a man and woman wanted to get together and become man and\nwife, why they uh, stood and told each other that they uh, were were man and wife.\nThere's of course no religious services, but to them that was a marriage. Uh, but uh, uh,\nthese these people were hungry. They had nothing to eat, and the only food was what the\nbaron had and so we told the baron that he was going to have to feed them and that we\ncould do nothing about uh, them stealing, uh, well actually taking food, that uh, we were\ngoing to leave and that uh, uh, we we gave instructions to the people to be reasonable and\nfair and whatever happened after that I don't know. But this was one incident that we ran\ninto uh, rather often in uh, to one degree or another. Uh, uh, it was amusing that uh, the\nbaron was uh,...of course, he knew nothing about what was happening. Uh, the same as\nuh, another place where there's a man that was an umbrella manufacturer, and he knew\nnothing...uh, we took over his house to stay...he knew nothing about the what the Nazis\nwere doing, and he wasn't a Nazi, but in the house we found him in a Nazi uniform uh, as\na local official, and we even found a picture with he and Hitler. (Laughter) But it was\nuh,...I relate these to show the the people over there almost universally in quotes did not\nknow what the Nazis were doing, and they were not Nazis, yet we found most of them\ndid know. Now getting over uh, towards the concentration camps, uh, uh, in uh, one\ntown, uh, very close to Nordhausen...it couldn't have been more than oh thirty or forty\nmiles away, up in the Hartz (ph) Mountains, we came across this almost bucolic scene. A\nbeautiful uh, landscaped uh, uh, estate and homes around uh, and walking around were\ngirls pushing uh, baby carriages and uh, uh, young pregnant women. Well, we found out\nlater that these women had become pregnant with uh, uh, German soldiers and the\nchildren were uh, taken after they had reached a few years old and put into a school,\ntaken away from their mothers and put into a school and later on as they grew up, there\nwas a small military camp. Now the military camp...these kids were actually put into the\ncamp and trained uh, as soldiers. Uh, it was kind of interesting that when we came upon\nthe town uh, we had uh, we had a little fire from uh, uh, back uh, behind some barricades,\nand we found out that they were they were kids fourteen and fifteen years of age, but we\ntalked them into stopping it, and these were actual children that were uh, uh, that were\nout of this this little area. The town I don't know, but it was in the Hartz Mountains. I\nrelate this to show that three or four days later we came across Nordhausen. Uh, a\ndiametric uh, scene. Uh, we were uh, our troops, the 238th Engineer Combat Battalion\nuh, was a uh, attached to the 7th Corps and we normally were then attached to any\ndivision that needed combat engineer uh, needed more combat engineer troops, primarily\nif they had uh, if they had bridges to build or roads or any type of engineering work, but\nwe were assigned uh, uh, in this area to the uh, uh, the Ist Division, the 104th Division\nand or the 3rd Armored. Uh, these troops, the infantry and armored, would move ahead\nof us and we'd come in and uh, repair the roads so that the uh, the support troops could\ncome up or we would go ahead and build bridges so they could move across them. Uh,\nthe 104th uh, Infantry uh, uh, and I believe the 3rd Armored went through the town of\nNordhausen. Uh, when they arrived there they found the most horrible situation that uh, a\nperson can ever explain. Uh, I came in probably a day or two days later. It 1t couldn't\nhave been more than a day later. Uh, my first recollection was moving in with my uh,\nwith my platoon into a uh, railroad yards, and German civilians were uh, well looting the\ntrains. They would break open the box cars and take any food out and of course they\nhadn't had any food and uh, so they'd uh, go get anything they could in the trains. Well,\nthere over on a siding there was this one train that uh, nobody had broken into and we\nwent over there and uh, the smell incidentally was horrible, in the town, all over. The\ncloser we got to this place uh, the worse the smell got. When I got over there I saw fluids\ndripping out of the the uh, boxcars. We opened one up and uh, uh, all I can compare it to\nis a group of fish slithering out of a net. These people were packed in uh, and they were\ndead and they had started into deteriorate. The uh, the body fluids were dripping out and\nwe...uh, well, many of us got sick. Uh, other uh, groups of our battalion were in uh, other\nparts of the uh, of the town. What uh, we did uh, was to go into town...after we'd found\nall this, we went into town and uh, ordered all the able-bodied people to...men, to come\nout and help bury. Uh, the town uh, uh, as I've heard since...there was actually two camps\nbut I I have no recollection of that. I...it all melds into one...uh, uh, I didn't know it at the\ntime but one was Camp Dora and the other was uh, was Nordhausen. Well, Camp Dora\nwas uh, I believe near a suburb and uh, uh, the town uh, you could be in the town and\nlook into the camp. Well the people all swore they knew nothing about it. Uh, each of\nthem must have been blind because we could see into the camp and see the dead bodies.\nUh, I remember a couple of things. I remember opening a furnace and seeing partially\nburned bodies. I remember the bodies in the barracks, uh, some alive, some dead. Uh, in\nsome instances there were people who were alive but barely alive that were laying right\nnext to people that were dead. The uh, we got uh, all the able-bodied men that we could\nand we dug rough trenches with our bulldozers and then we made the Germans and the\nGerman civilians uh, shovel uh, the trenches and make them perfect. They were beautiful\ntrenches. Uh, straight up and down, across, up and very clean. The dirt was piled uh, up\nabove the trench. They...we allowed them to have masks over their face, but we didn't\nallow them any kind of gloves. They had to handle the dead bodies with their bare hands.\nWe felt uh, rather strongly about this. Today I don't know whether I'd do the same thing\nbut uh, at that time uh, there was a a hatred, if you will. We uh, made them carry uh, each\nindividual body uh, they, on stretchers. Now they made stretchers out of oh doors, uh,\nthey'd take two poles and put uh, a coat in between, or take real stretchers...any type of\nmakeshift stretcher, but one person on a stretcher, four people carrying them. They took\nthem over. They laid them out neatly. We made them lay them out neatly and where they\ncould put their hands over them, and then carry them and lay them in line in the trenches\nuh, and then I don't know how they were buried because we left because the uh, before\nthey were uh, covered up. But we tried to stick them with detail. Uh, I'll never forget\nseeing partially burned bodies. I saw a few little children. Uh, uh, everybody was\nemaciated. Uh, these people apparently had been, well obviously were workers in a V-2\nfactory, in a Mescherschmidt (ph) factory that they had there. Uh, the Mescherschmidt's\nfactory was uh, uh, in I believe three tunnels and uh, I won't go into detail about the about\nthe factory, but needless to say we went into uh, we went into these and uh, they were the\nthe ultimate of German precision, but all of the work was done by slave labor and the\nslave labor was uh, worked until they got sick and then they were and then they either\ndied or they were killed. Uh, there apparently was no medical attention or any other type\nof attention and there was no food any place around. Possibly the Germans had taken\nwhat there was but there definitely was not any in the uh, barracks. The barracks\nthemselves that the that the uh, that the uh, uh, camp or where these people were housed\nwere large uh,...I don't recall whether they were brick or wood buildings...but uh, filthy,\nuh, dirty, and it was just...the entire the entire uh, experience was something that even\nthough we had seen uh, some of the things such as the slave labor camps out on the\nfarms, where the people weren't treated quite as bad...uh, this was...we just never even\nconceived of this type of thing happening. Uh, we did not know at the...I didn't even think\nabout it, whether these were uh, were Jews or displaced people from Poland or uh, where\nthey were from. In the camps out on the farms, they mostly were displaced people, but in\nDora, I think that the last of the Jewish people were uh, were in there in addition to others\nuh, but it...I just can't remember uh, uh, any of the stories. The the picture was so\nhorrible. Uh, to this day uh, I'm normally a uh, person that's rather complacent, and I do\nnot get into controversial discussions, but the one place where I get angry, and obviously\nangry, is when I hear people question that this existed, and I've had this happen several\ntimes and my answer uh, with expletives 1s that yes, it did exist. I saw it and I smelled it\nand I've got pictures of it. Our battalion photographer took uh, uh, oh twelve or fourteen\nphotographs of which I've uh, given to the uh, Holocaust Museum and uh, uh, it's kind of\ninteresting. We had two photographers. Uh, one one's name was Garfinkel. He was a\nJewish fellow, and Garfinkel could speak Yiddish and German and uh, we used to uh,\nhave Garfinkel come over and interview German prisoners and he delighted in speaking\nYiddish to them and uh, of course they could do nothing, nothing about it, but we we\nnever controlled that type of thing. He uh, he usually interviewed them and and got what\nwe wanted out of it. Garfinkel may or may not have been the one that took these. We had\ntwo photographers, and I think we have it on record uh, of who did. Uh, the photographs\nwere taken by the 238th Engineers and they are uh, the original photographs. I know that\nthey were taken. They were sent...they're probably in the uh, in the archives, because we\nsent uh, the copies of them through channels as we did any document we had. Uh...",
        "Q: Did you...did you through an interpreter perhaps uh, speak with any of the survivors?",
        "A: Uh, no. Uh, the reason was that the survivors were uh,...they couldn't speak, the ones that\nwere there. They were, they were almost dead. Uh, and uh, what we what we did, we\ntook care of burying...we took care of seeing that they were buried. Uh, apparently there\nwere troops that came in after us that took care of the medical...uh, gave them any\nmedical uh, uh, treatment that they needed, but we didn't we didn't have contact with uh,\nany of the ones that were left alive uh, as far as I know. Many of these things fade back\nand I I really can't remember.",
        "Q: What did you do about food or lack of food?",
        "A: Well, uh, this this was kind of interesting. Uh, we ran across many people that were\nstarved and uh, uh, I remember in in one place shortly after Nordhausen, we we came\nonto a uh, slave labor camp where the people were very hungry, and in this they had uh,\nuh, Russian prisoners of war as well as Polish and others. I don't think there was any\nJewish people in uh, in this, but uh, they immediately of course asked us for food. And\nuh, uh, we started feeding them. Our doctor came over and blew his stack. He said you do\nnot feed those people. You will kill them. And this actually happened. I am told that it\nactually happened that if you fed them, they'd die and uh, in one in one uh, case we met\nuh, we came across an American prisoner of war camp. Actually we came up to it, and it\nhad already been liberated and the American prisoners of war were coming out of it, and\nof course we immediately, we'd give them anything we had. Again our doctor uh, uh, put\nout orders that nobody was to feed them. We were to take them, put them in a compound\nand that the medical people would come in and feed them uh, to bring them back. Uh,\nsome who were uh, given food immediately got sick. Uh, I uh, only recall a couple of\ntimes where we did give them food. I remember one time when when some uh, some of\nthose people found some meat that uh, was that uh, had worms in it, maggots in it, and\nthey took it and brushed it out and started eating it and we had to forcefully take 1t away\nfrom them. Because they would have almost certainly died. Those were uh,...I do uh,...uh,\nI wrote my wife, who...she was my girlfriend then...I I wrote her quite a few letters and\nuh, we couldn't discuss many of these things in the letters, however I do have uh, uh, I\nhave one uh, uh, little piece that I I wrote. I'd like to read if if you would. Uh, this is April\n23rd, 1945, and this is about ten days after we were in Nordhausen. My wife's name was\nFaith. I said: Faith, I'm one year older today. Twenty-five. At least I think it's the 23rd of\nApril. You loose track of those things. No gray hairs yet but if this work keeps on uh,\nthere will be. (Cough) Uh, this 1s...today is one of those cold dreary days that would be\nbest spent by a fireplace. That kind of life is far away, especially when everyone is hating\neach other. These last few weeks I've seen what the Germans are really like. You see the\npeople from the concentration camps, the camps themselves, and you wonder if the\nmaster race is really human. What is in congruous, the civilians complain to us that the\nforced laborers are looting their homes of food and uh, moving in on them. Uh, the very\nsame thing the Nazis did to their enemies. They have such an innocent manner. All I can\nsay to them without losing my temper is, you brought them here. What a far cry from\nhome. Now we couldn't write details uh, of the of the camp, and so I never put it down in\nwriting, but this does, behind the lines you can see what I was thinking uh, after that\nexperience. Any other things that you might uh,...?",
        "Q: Is there anything you want to add about Nordhausen, any other recollections that you\nwant to tell us?",
        "A: Well, Nordhausen is in a beautiful area. Uh, in fact all of the area in the Hartz Mountains\nand I guess Nord...Nordhausen is a little south of there, but all of those areas are\nbeautiful. The uh, the dichotomy of a beautiful, beautiful, and things such as this\nhappening. I'd like to go back to Nordhausen, and one of these days I shall. Uh, I'd like to\nI'd like to see if there's any type of uh, uh, of monument where we buried those people. I\nassume there is. I hope there is. Uh, it it would be interesting uh, uh, to go back. Uh, no, I\nI don't think that there's uh,...oh, uh, there is one thing. The uh, tunnels that were back in\nthere, as I said were a they were a uh, uh, Meserschmidt factory or actually a V-2 factory,\nand uh, Werner Braun uh, von Braun (ph) was one of the top men there. I've often\nwondered if Werner von Braun were one of the people that we made carry those dead\nbodies out, because I'm certain that he was around the area. Uh, in all probability the\npeople that we made carry the bodies out were some of the scientists. Uh, they had to be,\nbecause they couldn't have all gotten out and we took every able-bodied man. I did read a\nuh, a very interesting uh, uh, piece about three years ago in a newspaper. It was in\nrelation to one of the uh, German rocket scientists that had been brought over here and\nhad been very instrumental in helping develop our space program, and uh, he was from\nNordhausen and a contemporary of Werner Braun, von Braun. Apparently he had uh, uh,\nbeen instrumental in sending some of the people to the uh, to their death there and uh,\nwas being charged as such. Who he was I don't recall, but he was he was sent uh, being\nsent back to Germany, and the thing that was interesting to me was that there was a\ncommentary about it. Why should we send...uh, this man had done so much for our\ncountry. Why should we send him back to face those uh, uh, the uh, courts over there?\nWell, 1t made me wonder how quick we forget. I don't care what the person did, if he was\ninstrumental in uh, in perpetuating that type of a situation, he's got to face his accusers\nsometime. And how many others of the scientists that came over were instrumental in\ndoing that sort...they mu...they had to know it.",
        "Q: I wanted to go back to you and to your experience during the war, if I may?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh, after you left Nordhausen, uh, you told us in this interview and you told me before\nyou were in other slave labor camps as well.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Would you tell us about some of those camps and what you saw?",
        "A: Yes. Uh, uh, I think the one you're referring to is actually a uh, a German prisoner of war\ncamp. As the uh, when we uh, in May, just a month or so after uh, the war was over and\ntroops were put in as uh, as uh, well for military government and uh, I for instance was\nassigned a little town uh, by the name of Wimbleberg (ph), uh, and I was in effect the\nmilitary governor of that. It's near Iceslaven (ph). Uh, we were uh, uh,...again, none of the\npeople knew anything about uh, uh, the concentration camps. None of them had been\nNazis and uh, by this time we were sort of hardened to that type of an answer. It was\nuh,...we we almost..we were amused because uh, where were all the Nazis? Uh, where\nwere the...how come they didn't know that the that there were slave labor camps? Uh, this\narea, they'd had trains going through there. Uh, it was on the main uh, uh, railroad lines.\nWell, one...uh, we were uh, pulled out of that duty for uh, two weeks, a week or two\nweeks work in guarding a uh, large military prisoner of war camp. This uh, camp had uh,\nat at the back of it was a large slag pile from coal uh, from coal mines, and you couldn't\nclimb up it, so that made a uh, a way of barring that side. Then we had barbed wire all\naround the camp. Uh, there were probably eighty to a hundred thousand prisoners in\nthere. Uh, one one portion of the uh, camp had a separate wire cage. Uh, there were three\nrings of concertina (ph)...that's the round barbed wire...two and then one atop around this.\nThen there was a bare area and then there was another line of concertina. Now uh, we had\nour our uh, guns, what we called uh, anti-aircraft multiple mounts...four fifty calibre\nmachine guns that were lowered down and aimed along there. If any one escaped, they\nwere shot uh, and that's the only way we could control a hundred thousand people with\nprobably two or three hundred uh, troops, and at night they had search lights that went\ndown these. They'd have what we called a field of fire...one down here, one down here\nand that zig-zagged around. Uh, this one particular area that was separated uh,,...there\nwere civilians in it. They were all uh, uh, war criminals, uh, people who had been guards\nin the camp and various other types of things, of uh, positions that they had held and they\nwere in there for reasons. We didn't know why, but uh, uh, many of them were guards in\nthe un probably in Nordhausen, because this wasn't too far away from there, or\nBuchenwald. Uh, and uh, these people uh, were...they were the some of the meanest\nlooking people that I think I've ever seen, and I don't know what happened to them. I do\nremember that uh, we had one uh, of our guns that were aimed down there, and if anyone\ncome close to the wire, they let loose with the guns. Uh, we had obviously had a uh, a\nvery strong feeling towards the civilians that were put in that cage. Uh, the German\nsoldiers, we kept telling them through their own officers and their own uh, uh, non-coms\nthat they were being held there only so we could process them to let them out, which was\ntrue. Within weeks they were all out and at home, but I'll never forget those uh, people in\nthat that portion of the concentra...or of the uh, the uh, prisoner of war camp. What\nhappened to them I don't know. I assume that they are the ones that went into some of the\ntrials, but they were in there because there were documented reasons for them being\nthere. Uh, we uh, after after we were in the Nordhausen area and Iceslaven area, from\nthen on why uh, we heard a lot of stories but we had no no direct contact with any uh, any\ntype of slave labor or concentration camp uh, camps. We were on...we left for uh, for\nFrance uh, a couple of months later, but all that time we were just in military government\nand uh, we were keeping things uh, some sort of of government until the civil\ngovernment could come in, and when they came in why we moved out.",
        "Q: Did you come in contact uh, with refugees during this period?",
        "A: Oh yes. Yes. Many refugees. Uh, uh, in fact uh, that was one of our big problems of\nmovement was uh, the refugees would be coming back and we'd being going forward. In\nuh, in over in France and Belgium, they were of course French and Belgium people...",
        "Q: Let's stay in Germany...",
        "A: But getting over into Germany, uh, these people were uh, primarily they were uh,\nGermans whose towns had been totally destroyed and they uh, they had no place to go.\nWe did run across uh, refugees who were non-Germans, primarily the Poles and uh,\nuh,...1t always comes back Italians but I can't imagine why Italians...they may have been,\nthey may have had uh, laborers come in. I don't know. Uh, then uh, there were Russians,\nand it was hard to separate the Russians who were uh, military prisoners from Russian\ncivilians that had been sent back, but uh, they were always hungry. They uh, we'd give\nthem food sometimes but uh, there were so many of them. Uh, it just uh,...I don't I don't\nhave too many reco...detailed recollections except the masses uh, of them. We made them\nget off the road when we were moving our military forward though. And...",
        "Q: I'd like to go back to Nordhausen if you don't mind one more time for a minute. Uh, when\nyou went into the camp, uh, you described some of it for us. Uh, can you uh, tell us at\nall about uh, uh, the the layout of the camp? How was it, how was it set up?",
        "A: Well, this...no...I've tried, I've tried to uh, to bring that back but I can't. Uh, uh, I do\nremember the large barracks, and I do remember uh, uh, opening an oven, but\nwhat...where that was in relation to other things, I I don't recall. There were so many\nthings happening and and frankly we were so tired. Uh, we had, we were moving\nsometimes uh, fifty or sixty miles a day and working day and night and uh, we were just\nuh, uh, we were just dead on our feet, and uh, one of the problems that we had in relation\nto this type of recollection is that uh, we were numb. Uh, we were emotionally numb.\nAnd so uh, many of those details are are difficult, uh, difficult to remember. Uh, some of\nmy memories are stimulated by the photos that I have, but I can't tell whether it's a it's a\nremembering or whether it's looking at the photo and that is impressed as a memory. Uh,\nuh, I do know that uh, you can see into the camp from outside of the camp. That 1s\ndefinite. Uh, I couldn't figure how in the how the people in the town didn't know what\nwas happening. I had heard uh, others say that they had been, that people had been shot\nright out or killed right out in broad daylight there. I didn't see it but that's uh, uh, that\ndoes tell how how open uh, it apparently was. Uh, additionally I'm not sure whether those\ntrains that we saw were coming in or going out. Uh, uh, I would assume that they were\ncoming in, however I've heard later that the Germans were moving them back, but we\nwere getting awfully close to the __ River so they didn't have very uh, very many other\nplaces to move them, and whether they had come from Buchenwald or not, uh, I don't\nknow. I assume that some of them had come from Buchenwald.",
        "Q: When you left Germany, could you just tell us briefly where you went?",
        "A: Well, we uh, uh, in about uh, June or it must have been July because the 4th of July I\nspent in Germany. Uh, uh, the civil government came in and took over and we moved\nback to uh, back to France where as engineers we became the ones that maintained\nredeployment camps and uh, we uh, kept oh the water supply and roads and everything\nsuch as that, and we kept that up until October. Then I finally uh, got my orders to go\nhome and uh, I couldn't believe it. I got the Queen Elizabeth. (Laughter) And I'll never\nforget the difference between all the deprivations we had and then getting on the Queen\nElizabeth where we had waiters for our tables and uh, we could go to the bar and get\nscotch and soda and uh, oh that was heaven. (Laughter) And then when I got home, the\nfirst thing that I remember is the Red Cross being on the docks with great big uh, uh,\ntrucks loaded with milk, and they gave us all the milk we wanted. See we hadn't had milk\nfor oh two years, fresh milk, and that was the thing that we that we liked the most. But\nafter that I I landed about the 13th of October and I called my girlfriend up and told her I\nwas coming home, and she asked when and I told her and I got on the train on the 17th.\nMet her the 17th and the 18th we were married. And she's still with me, after forty-five\nyears. Is there anything else that I, that we might...I can't I can't think of anything\nelse...well, I I can add uh, there are uh, quite a few people who are in my uh, uh, in the\n238th Engineer Combat Battalion Association. We still meet. We've had forty-four\nmeetings, every year since then. It's a small group - five hundred people originally in it\nand we still have two hundred that are active. Many of those do remember uh, uh, the\nincidents. I've made several tapes which I've given to the uh, to the Holocaust Museum\nand uh, I'm having, we're having a meeting next week and at that time why uh, uh, we've\ninvited a member of the Holocaust Museum to come over and we'll talk in detail. One of\nthe things that that I have noticed uh, (cough), excuse me...uh, over the years uh, uh, why\nwe didn't talk about this, about Nordhausen, I don't know, but it was years before uh, we\nhad any discussion upon it. I never recall discussing Nordhausen in to any degree in any\nof our meetings. Now it wasn't because we wanted to put it out of our mind. It uh,...I\ndon't know. Uh, it was only after uh, we had uh, uh, found the photographs...uh, the\ncommanding officer had the photographs along with several hundred others of the\nbattalion and we got to discussing that and then I believe that uh, early in the 1980's that\nthere was a trend towards uh, publicizing the fact that all this happened, probably because\nof what I'd experienced...people denying that it existed, and uh, even today I find that\npeople in that unit are uh, rather reluctant to talk about it. Now why this is I don't know.\nIt may be because their memories have uh, have slipped. Uh, I could only find four or\nfive who would uh, uh, say that they recalled this. I've tried to get them to talk about it\nand uh, I can't. They'll say well, yes, I remember that but they won't go in to detail. I'm\nwondering if possibly they may have uh, unconsciously put it out of their minds. It was\nso horrible. Uh, I can't I cannot believe uh, in my own mind that people are are capable of\nthat, and in my own mind I think I do separate the actual accident or actual incident uh,\nwith the uh, with how it happened. Do you get what I mean? The uh, uh, the fact that\npeople did that versus the physical dead bodies is is to a degree separated in my own\nmind. I can't uh, I guess subconsciously I can't believe that it uh, that it could have been\ndone, yet uh, uh, the odor is still firmly impressed in my mind. Uh, if I smell a dead body\nof any kind I immediately think about that. So uh, it did happen. Uh, I I am pleased that\nthe uh, the Holocaust Museum and that others are uh, uh, trying to uh, document all of\nthis. I I believe in my own mind that if uh, if it isn't documented, more and more people\nare going to come by and say, did it really happen. I can say it happened because I saw it.\nBut those of us that saw it are probably within ten or fifteen years of not being here, and\nthere'll be nobody that saw it. And uh, these documentaries like this are the only thing\nthat will be existing uh, and so uh, I, every opportunity I get now I talk about it. I don't\nwant to hold back anything. The sordid details are very important uh, because they they\ntend to emphasize that man's inhumanity to man 1s is there and one other thing that I can\nsay...uh, uh, a little incident happened to me that uh, is unrelated to the Holocaust but it's\nrelated to the, to what can happen. We were crossing...we were building a bridge across\nthe Rhine River just before _ fell, and I was in charge of of preparing the the uh,\nenemy shore. We had crossed __, come up and had a slit of land north. This was near\n. We were cleaning out all of the uh, civilians that were in the area. We didn't\nwant any German in the area, so we just vacated their houses, kicked them out. Uh, they\ncould have gone over and thrown a bomb on our bridge and knocked it out. Anyhow uh,\neach officer took an enlisted man and uh, we went up one street and down the other,\nknocked on the door, uh, told the people they had to get out. They had ten minutes to get\nout. Where are they going to go? You go that way, and you'll be directed, and that\nwas...that way was back away from the Rhine River. I went up to this one house and\nknocked on the door and uh, as the person that was in there opened the door, this young\ncorporal from a little town in Kansas uh, was there with me. He snapped to, clicked his\nheels together, put his gun up like this, and all I could think was my God, a Nazi storm\ntrooper. I have never forgotten that incident, because here was young Mr. America. This\nis the all American boy, and we're in a position of power and he turned to a Nazi\nlike...man...I corrected him but I've never forgotten that. Given the right circumstances, it\ncan still happen.",

        "A: I'm Ernest James.",
        "A: I was born in Ord, Nebraska, on April 23, 1920.",
        "A: Well, I came from rather a large family. There's nine of us, and incidentally they're, all\nbut one are still living and we get together a lot. Uh, uh, I was the next to the youngest of\nthe family. We were in a farming community in uh, central Nebraska. Uh, I had a very\nuh, good childhood. Uh, uh, graduated from high school in 1938, and immediately\nthereafter uh, in fact the day I graduated I got on the train and left for California, where I\nworked in uh, the U.S. Forest Service. Uh, I worked there until about 19 uh, oh 40. And\nthen with the war coming along uh, I decided that rather than be drafted I would uh, join\nthe Army. I joined the California National Guard. Uh, uh, we were called into active\nservice at uh, in March of 1941. I was in the infantry and had uh, basic training and rose\nuh, by uh, the time the war started I was a sergeant. Uh, we were uh, uh, right after Pearl\nHarbor we were called in to uh, be the defensive troops along the the coast in San\nFrancisco and I had a lot of experiences in uh, running patrols, uh, trying to uh, set it up\nso that if the Japanese came, why we could uh, keep them away. I uh, uh, was uh, I\napplied for officer's candidate school in the engineers in uh, June of 1942 and was\naccepted. Uh, went through training in Fort Belvoir and uh, uh, was commissioned as a\nSecond Lieutenant. Uh, I went up to Platsburg Barracks in New York where I had uh, I\nwas assigned to a com...engineer combat battalion and we trained our troops up there uh,\nuh, from about 19 uh, 19...through 1942. We then went uh, uh, overseas. Went down to\nNorth Africa about the time of the uh, that uh, Roosevelt was at the Yalta Conference,\nand uh, at that conference they decided to uh, that they're going to invade Europe so\nrather than go to the Far East, we went up to England where we prepared for the invasion.\nUh, after uh, uh, going for about several months in England training for the invasion, we\nwere ready and in uh, June we uh, uh, got on our ships and our trip, our troops were some\nof the first that landed on D-Day uh, uh, in Normandy. Uh, we uh, were involved in\nvirtually all of the uh, combat operations of the 1st Army in 7th Corps. Uh, captured\nCherbourg and and the uh, uh, Battles of St. Lowe (ph) and uh, uh, moving on through\nover to Paris uh, we turned north and went up to Belgium, through uh, uh, through\nBelgium and in Aucken (ph) we were uh,...one of the things that I remember was uh, how\nwonderful the people were in France and Belgium, but the minute we hit Aucken uh,\npeople were somber. They resented us and uh, uh, it was there we first started uh, getting\nthe feeling that uh, uh, the Germans were more...uh, were worst than just a uh, enemy,\nthat uh, we started hearing stories about uh, uh, the uh, concentration camps. Uh, I might\ngo back to a couple of recollections that I do have of uh, uh, the uh,...what was happening\nover in Germany. Back in 1938 uh,...well, maybe it was earlier than that, '36...",
        "A: Well, this 1s what I experienced. (Oh, OK.) Uh, uh, I discussed uh, the World War I with\nsome uh, with a gentleman that had uh, been in that, and he told me that uh, he felt that\nwe weren't finished with the Germans, that the Nazi uh, the Nazi uh, that were coming in\nuh, in power, uh, that there was going to be a war, and he impressed on uh, on me this.\nThen uh, in 1939 I met my first, I had my first contact and inkling that there was uh,\nsomething happening over there. I was with a church group and they sponsored a Jewish\nuh, family that came over, and I remember this this family...very brilliant people, and uh,\nwonderful people and they uh, they were Jewish. This was a Congregational Church.\nWell, they came in and uh, we got acquainted with them, and I remember talking to uh,\nthe daughter and she was telling me about how they were taking the Jewish people and\nputting them into camps, and this was in 1938 or '39. And uh, we couldn't, we couldn't\ncomprehend that that type of thing was happening. However, the church did sponsor\nseveral Jewish people coming uh,...Jewish families coming over and uh, wouldn't it have\nbeen wonderful if we had of known then what actually was happening, but that my...the\nfirst inkling that I had that anything such as this happened. Now, getting back to uh, uh,\ngetting back to uh, going into Germany, I had several uh, instances where we we found\nuh, people who were uh, displaced people from Poland and other uh, countries and uh,\nbut not a not a lot of them. Apparently, as we moved on through Germany, these people\nwere uh, were uh, carried back behind the German lines and as a consequence, only those\nthat may have hidden someplace uh, uh, were the ones that we saw. Uh, I do remember\none time...uh, it was uh, not too long before uh, we hit Nordhausen that uh, we went into\na large uh, oh German farm. It was a...there was a baron that was that had an estate and\nuh, he had virtually a castle, a small castle. Uh, we went into into this area and uh, uh,\nthere were a lot of uh, well, slave labors. Uh, uh, they were probably uh,...they were\nPolish, uh, possibly some Russians and there were some Italians there. Why there were\nItalians I don't know, but uh, uh, the baron uh, came out and asked me if I could do\nsomething about these horrible people that were uh, stealing all his food and we uh.....I I\nwas a platoon commander at the time, and uh, so he invited me in for some wine, and so I\nuh, went over to my uh, sergeant and asked him to get uh, two of our people. One was of\nPolish uh, extraction and could speak Polish and German. The other was Italian. His\nname of Pecares (ph). Well uh, they went over and talked to these people while I went in\nto talk to the baron. Well, I went in there and he had these beau...these beautiful uh, arms,\nguns and uh, medieval type armament on the wall and then uh, he had apparently been a\nbig game hunter. Uh, the uh, baron told me how horrible these people were and uh, uh,\nhow the Germans were uh, being uh, victimized by them. Well, in talking to this man...he\nhad uh, he had been an editor of a newspaper uh, somewhere in Germany and uh, in\nasking him about the Nazis, why of course he didn't know that all these things were\nhappening. Uh, uh, and he pointed out that he had opened up his, part of his home as a\nhospital. And he did. He had a hospital there. They were all uh, either wounded Germans\nor wounded civilians uh, that were in there. Uh, after uh, I had my glass of wine with\nhim, I went back to talk to the uh, to the Polish and the Italian men. Well their story was\nquite interesting. These people were kept in virtual slavery in this in this farm, and uh,\nthey uh, uh, they weren't allowed to have religious services. They weren't allowed to\nmarry. And one of the interesting things was uh, one of them told how they uh, if one, if a\nman and a woman wanted to get together...1ncidentally they all lived in in communal uh,\nuh, barracks in effect...a man and woman wanted to get together and become man and\nwife, why they uh, stood and told each other that they uh, were were man and wife.\nThere's of course no religious services, but to them that was a marriage. Uh, but uh, uh,\nthese these people were hungry. They had nothing to eat, and the only food was what the\nbaron had and so we told the baron that he was going to have to feed them and that we\ncould do nothing about uh, them stealing, uh, well actually taking food, that uh, we were\ngoing to leave and that uh, uh, we we gave instructions to the people to be reasonable and\nfair and whatever happened after that I don't know. But this was one incident that we ran\ninto uh, rather often in uh, to one degree or another. Uh, uh, it was amusing that uh, the\nbaron was uh,...of course, he knew nothing about what was happening. Uh, the same as\nuh, another place where there's a man that was an umbrella manufacturer, and he knew\nnothing...uh, we took over his house to stay...he knew nothing about the what the Nazis\nwere doing, and he wasn't a Nazi, but in the house we found him in a Nazi uniform uh, as\na local official, and we even found a picture with he and Hitler. (Laughter) But it was\nuh,...I relate these to show the the people over there almost universally in quotes did not\nknow what the Nazis were doing, and they were not Nazis, yet we found most of them\ndid know. Now getting over uh, towards the concentration camps, uh, uh, in uh, one\ntown, uh, very close to Nordhausen...it couldn't have been more than oh thirty or forty\nmiles away, up in the Hartz (ph) Mountains, we came across this almost bucolic scene. A\nbeautiful uh, landscaped uh, uh, estate and homes around uh, and walking around were\ngirls pushing uh, baby carriages and uh, uh, young pregnant women. Well, we found out\nlater that these women had become pregnant with uh, uh, German soldiers and the\nchildren were uh, taken after they had reached a few years old and put into a school,\ntaken away from their mothers and put into a school and later on as they grew up, there\nwas a small military camp. Now the military camp...these kids were actually put into the\ncamp and trained uh, as soldiers. Uh, it was kind of interesting that when we came upon\nthe town uh, we had uh, we had a little fire from uh, uh, back uh, behind some barricades,\nand we found out that they were they were kids fourteen and fifteen years of age, but we\ntalked them into stopping it, and these were actual children that were uh, uh, that were\nout of this this little area. The town I don't know, but it was in the Hartz Mountains. I\nrelate this to show that three or four days later we came across Nordhausen. Uh, a\ndiametric uh, scene. Uh, we were uh, our troops, the 238th Engineer Combat Battalion\nuh, was a uh, attached to the 7th Corps and we normally were then attached to any\ndivision that needed combat engineer uh, needed more combat engineer troops, primarily\nif they had uh, if they had bridges to build or roads or any type of engineering work, but\nwe were assigned uh, uh, in this area to the uh, uh, the Ist Division, the 104th Division\nand or the 3rd Armored. Uh, these troops, the infantry and armored, would move ahead\nof us and we'd come in and uh, repair the roads so that the uh, the support troops could\ncome up or we would go ahead and build bridges so they could move across them. Uh,\nthe 104th uh, Infantry uh, uh, and I believe the 3rd Armored went through the town of\nNordhausen. Uh, when they arrived there they found the most horrible situation that uh, a\nperson can ever explain. Uh, I came in probably a day or two days later. It 1t couldn't\nhave been more than a day later. Uh, my first recollection was moving in with my uh,\nwith my platoon into a uh, railroad yards, and German civilians were uh, well looting the\ntrains. They would break open the box cars and take any food out and of course they\nhadn't had any food and uh, so they'd uh, go get anything they could in the trains. Well,\nthere over on a siding there was this one train that uh, nobody had broken into and we\nwent over there and uh, the smell incidentally was horrible, in the town, all over. The\ncloser we got to this place uh, the worse the smell got. When I got over there I saw fluids\ndripping out of the the uh, boxcars. We opened one up and uh, uh, all I can compare it to\nis a group of fish slithering out of a net. These people were packed in uh, and they were\ndead and they had started into deteriorate. The uh, the body fluids were dripping out and\nwe...uh, well, many of us got sick. Uh, other uh, groups of our battalion were in uh, other\nparts of the uh, of the town. What uh, we did uh, was to go into town...after we'd found\nall this, we went into town and uh, ordered all the able-bodied people to...men, to come\nout and help bury. Uh, the town uh, uh, as I've heard since...there was actually two camps\nbut I I have no recollection of that. I...it all melds into one...uh, uh, I didn't know it at the\ntime but one was Camp Dora and the other was uh, was Nordhausen. Well, Camp Dora\nwas uh, I believe near a suburb and uh, uh, the town uh, you could be in the town and\nlook into the camp. Well the people all swore they knew nothing about it. Uh, each of\nthem must have been blind because we could see into the camp and see the dead bodies.\nUh, I remember a couple of things. I remember opening a furnace and seeing partially\nburned bodies. I remember the bodies in the barracks, uh, some alive, some dead. Uh, in\nsome instances there were people who were alive but barely alive that were laying right\nnext to people that were dead. The uh, we got uh, all the able-bodied men that we could\nand we dug rough trenches with our bulldozers and then we made the Germans and the\nGerman civilians uh, shovel uh, the trenches and make them perfect. They were beautiful\ntrenches. Uh, straight up and down, across, up and very clean. The dirt was piled uh, up\nabove the trench. They...we allowed them to have masks over their face, but we didn't\nallow them any kind of gloves. They had to handle the dead bodies with their bare hands.\nWe felt uh, rather strongly about this. Today I don't know whether I'd do the same thing\nbut uh, at that time uh, there was a a hatred, if you will. We uh, made them carry uh, each\nindividual body uh, they, on stretchers. Now they made stretchers out of oh doors, uh,\nthey'd take two poles and put uh, a coat in between, or take real stretchers...any type of\nmakeshift stretcher, but one person on a stretcher, four people carrying them. They took\nthem over. They laid them out neatly. We made them lay them out neatly and where they\ncould put their hands over them, and then carry them and lay them in line in the trenches\nuh, and then I don't know how they were buried because we left because the uh, before\nthey were uh, covered up. But we tried to stick them with detail. Uh, I'll never forget\nseeing partially burned bodies. I saw a few little children. Uh, uh, everybody was\nemaciated. Uh, these people apparently had been, well obviously were workers in a V-2\nfactory, in a Mescherschmidt (ph) factory that they had there. Uh, the Mescherschmidt's\nfactory was uh, uh, in I believe three tunnels and uh, I won't go into detail about the about\nthe factory, but needless to say we went into uh, we went into these and uh, they were the\nthe ultimate of German precision, but all of the work was done by slave labor and the\nslave labor was uh, worked until they got sick and then they were and then they either\ndied or they were killed. Uh, there apparently was no medical attention or any other type\nof attention and there was no food any place around. Possibly the Germans had taken\nwhat there was but there definitely was not any in the uh, barracks. The barracks\nthemselves that the that the uh, that the uh, uh, camp or where these people were housed\nwere large uh,...I don't recall whether they were brick or wood buildings...but uh, filthy,\nuh, dirty, and it was just...the entire the entire uh, experience was something that even\nthough we had seen uh, some of the things such as the slave labor camps out on the\nfarms, where the people weren't treated quite as bad...uh, this was...we just never even\nconceived of this type of thing happening. Uh, we did not know at the...I didn't even think\nabout it, whether these were uh, were Jews or displaced people from Poland or uh, where\nthey were from. In the camps out on the farms, they mostly were displaced people, but in\nDora, I think that the last of the Jewish people were uh, were in there in addition to others\nuh, but it...I just can't remember uh, uh, any of the stories. The the picture was so\nhorrible. Uh, to this day uh, I'm normally a uh, person that's rather complacent, and I do\nnot get into controversial discussions, but the one place where I get angry, and obviously\nangry, is when I hear people question that this existed, and I've had this happen several\ntimes and my answer uh, with expletives 1s that yes, it did exist. I saw it and I smelled it\nand I've got pictures of it. Our battalion photographer took uh, uh, oh twelve or fourteen\nphotographs of which I've uh, given to the uh, Holocaust Museum and uh, uh, it's kind of\ninteresting. We had two photographers. Uh, one one's name was Garfinkel. He was a\nJewish fellow, and Garfinkel could speak Yiddish and German and uh, we used to uh,\nhave Garfinkel come over and interview German prisoners and he delighted in speaking\nYiddish to them and uh, of course they could do nothing, nothing about it, but we we\nnever controlled that type of thing. He uh, he usually interviewed them and and got what\nwe wanted out of it. Garfinkel may or may not have been the one that took these. We had\ntwo photographers, and I think we have it on record uh, of who did. Uh, the photographs\nwere taken by the 238th Engineers and they are uh, the original photographs. I know that\nthey were taken. They were sent...they're probably in the uh, in the archives, because we\nsent uh, the copies of them through channels as we did any document we had. Uh...",
        "A: Uh, no. Uh, the reason was that the survivors were uh,...they couldn't speak, the ones that\nwere there. They were, they were almost dead. Uh, and uh, what we what we did, we\ntook care of burying...we took care of seeing that they were buried. Uh, apparently there\nwere troops that came in after us that took care of the medical...uh, gave them any\nmedical uh, uh, treatment that they needed, but we didn't we didn't have contact with uh,\nany of the ones that were left alive uh, as far as I know. Many of these things fade back\nand I I really can't remember.",
        "A: Well, uh, this this was kind of interesting. Uh, we ran across many people that were\nstarved and uh, uh, I remember in in one place shortly after Nordhausen, we we came\nonto a uh, slave labor camp where the people were very hungry, and in this they had uh,\nuh, Russian prisoners of war as well as Polish and others. I don't think there was any\nJewish people in uh, in this, but uh, they immediately of course asked us for food. And\nuh, uh, we started feeding them. Our doctor came over and blew his stack. He said you do\nnot feed those people. You will kill them. And this actually happened. I am told that it\nactually happened that if you fed them, they'd die and uh, in one in one uh, case we met\nuh, we came across an American prisoner of war camp. Actually we came up to it, and it\nhad already been liberated and the American prisoners of war were coming out of it, and\nof course we immediately, we'd give them anything we had. Again our doctor uh, uh, put\nout orders that nobody was to feed them. We were to take them, put them in a compound\nand that the medical people would come in and feed them uh, to bring them back. Uh,\nsome who were uh, given food immediately got sick. Uh, I uh, only recall a couple of\ntimes where we did give them food. I remember one time when when some uh, some of\nthose people found some meat that uh, was that uh, had worms in it, maggots in it, and\nthey took it and brushed it out and started eating it and we had to forcefully take 1t away\nfrom them. Because they would have almost certainly died. Those were uh,...I do uh,...uh,\nI wrote my wife, who...she was my girlfriend then...I I wrote her quite a few letters and\nuh, we couldn't discuss many of these things in the letters, however I do have uh, uh, I\nhave one uh, uh, little piece that I I wrote. I'd like to read if if you would. Uh, this is April\n23rd, 1945, and this is about ten days after we were in Nordhausen. My wife's name was\nFaith. I said: Faith, I'm one year older today. Twenty-five. At least I think it's the 23rd of\nApril. You loose track of those things. No gray hairs yet but if this work keeps on uh,\nthere will be. (Cough) Uh, this 1s...today is one of those cold dreary days that would be\nbest spent by a fireplace. That kind of life is far away, especially when everyone is hating\neach other. These last few weeks I've seen what the Germans are really like. You see the\npeople from the concentration camps, the camps themselves, and you wonder if the\nmaster race is really human. What is in congruous, the civilians complain to us that the\nforced laborers are looting their homes of food and uh, moving in on them. Uh, the very\nsame thing the Nazis did to their enemies. They have such an innocent manner. All I can\nsay to them without losing my temper is, you brought them here. What a far cry from\nhome. Now we couldn't write details uh, of the of the camp, and so I never put it down in\nwriting, but this does, behind the lines you can see what I was thinking uh, after that\nexperience. Any other things that you might uh,...?",
        "A: Well, Nordhausen is in a beautiful area. Uh, in fact all of the area in the Hartz Mountains\nand I guess Nord...Nordhausen is a little south of there, but all of those areas are\nbeautiful. The uh, the dichotomy of a beautiful, beautiful, and things such as this\nhappening. I'd like to go back to Nordhausen, and one of these days I shall. Uh, I'd like to\nI'd like to see if there's any type of uh, uh, of monument where we buried those people. I\nassume there is. I hope there is. Uh, it it would be interesting uh, uh, to go back. Uh, no, I\nI don't think that there's uh,...oh, uh, there is one thing. The uh, tunnels that were back in\nthere, as I said were a they were a uh, uh, Meserschmidt factory or actually a V-2 factory,\nand uh, Werner Braun uh, von Braun (ph) was one of the top men there. I've often\nwondered if Werner von Braun were one of the people that we made carry those dead\nbodies out, because I'm certain that he was around the area. Uh, in all probability the\npeople that we made carry the bodies out were some of the scientists. Uh, they had to be,\nbecause they couldn't have all gotten out and we took every able-bodied man. I did read a\nuh, a very interesting uh, uh, piece about three years ago in a newspaper. It was in\nrelation to one of the uh, German rocket scientists that had been brought over here and\nhad been very instrumental in helping develop our space program, and uh, he was from\nNordhausen and a contemporary of Werner Braun, von Braun. Apparently he had uh, uh,\nbeen instrumental in sending some of the people to the uh, to their death there and uh,\nwas being charged as such. Who he was I don't recall, but he was he was sent uh, being\nsent back to Germany, and the thing that was interesting to me was that there was a\ncommentary about it. Why should we send...uh, this man had done so much for our\ncountry. Why should we send him back to face those uh, uh, the uh, courts over there?\nWell, 1t made me wonder how quick we forget. I don't care what the person did, if he was\ninstrumental in uh, in perpetuating that type of a situation, he's got to face his accusers\nsometime. And how many others of the scientists that came over were instrumental in\ndoing that sort...they mu...they had to know it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yes. Uh, uh, I think the one you're referring to is actually a uh, a German prisoner of war\ncamp. As the uh, when we uh, in May, just a month or so after uh, the war was over and\ntroops were put in as uh, as uh, well for military government and uh, I for instance was\nassigned a little town uh, by the name of Wimbleberg (ph), uh, and I was in effect the\nmilitary governor of that. It's near Iceslaven (ph). Uh, we were uh, uh,...again, none of the\npeople knew anything about uh, uh, the concentration camps. None of them had been\nNazis and uh, by this time we were sort of hardened to that type of an answer. It was\nuh,...we we almost..we were amused because uh, where were all the Nazis? Uh, where\nwere the...how come they didn't know that the that there were slave labor camps? Uh, this\narea, they'd had trains going through there. Uh, it was on the main uh, uh, railroad lines.\nWell, one...uh, we were uh, pulled out of that duty for uh, two weeks, a week or two\nweeks work in guarding a uh, large military prisoner of war camp. This uh, camp had uh,\nat at the back of it was a large slag pile from coal uh, from coal mines, and you couldn't\nclimb up it, so that made a uh, a way of barring that side. Then we had barbed wire all\naround the camp. Uh, there were probably eighty to a hundred thousand prisoners in\nthere. Uh, one one portion of the uh, camp had a separate wire cage. Uh, there were three\nrings of concertina (ph)...that's the round barbed wire...two and then one atop around this.\nThen there was a bare area and then there was another line of concertina. Now uh, we had\nour our uh, guns, what we called uh, anti-aircraft multiple mounts...four fifty calibre\nmachine guns that were lowered down and aimed along there. If any one escaped, they\nwere shot uh, and that's the only way we could control a hundred thousand people with\nprobably two or three hundred uh, troops, and at night they had search lights that went\ndown these. They'd have what we called a field of fire...one down here, one down here\nand that zig-zagged around. Uh, this one particular area that was separated uh,,...there\nwere civilians in it. They were all uh, uh, war criminals, uh, people who had been guards\nin the camp and various other types of things, of uh, positions that they had held and they\nwere in there for reasons. We didn't know why, but uh, uh, many of them were guards in\nthe un probably in Nordhausen, because this wasn't too far away from there, or\nBuchenwald. Uh, and uh, these people uh, were...they were the some of the meanest\nlooking people that I think I've ever seen, and I don't know what happened to them. I do\nremember that uh, we had one uh, of our guns that were aimed down there, and if anyone\ncome close to the wire, they let loose with the guns. Uh, we had obviously had a uh, a\nvery strong feeling towards the civilians that were put in that cage. Uh, the German\nsoldiers, we kept telling them through their own officers and their own uh, uh, non-coms\nthat they were being held there only so we could process them to let them out, which was\ntrue. Within weeks they were all out and at home, but I'll never forget those uh, people in\nthat that portion of the concentra...or of the uh, the uh, prisoner of war camp. What\nhappened to them I don't know. I assume that they are the ones that went into some of the\ntrials, but they were in there because there were documented reasons for them being\nthere. Uh, we uh, after after we were in the Nordhausen area and Iceslaven area, from\nthen on why uh, we heard a lot of stories but we had no no direct contact with any uh, any\ntype of slave labor or concentration camp uh, camps. We were on...we left for uh, for\nFrance uh, a couple of months later, but all that time we were just in military government\nand uh, we were keeping things uh, some sort of of government until the civil\ngovernment could come in, and when they came in why we moved out.",
        "A: Oh yes. Yes. Many refugees. Uh, uh, in fact uh, that was one of our big problems of\nmovement was uh, the refugees would be coming back and we'd being going forward. In\nuh, in over in France and Belgium, they were of course French and Belgium people...",
        "A: But getting over into Germany, uh, these people were uh, primarily they were uh,\nGermans whose towns had been totally destroyed and they uh, they had no place to go.\nWe did run across uh, refugees who were non-Germans, primarily the Poles and uh,\nuh,...1t always comes back Italians but I can't imagine why Italians...they may have been,\nthey may have had uh, laborers come in. I don't know. Uh, then uh, there were Russians,\nand it was hard to separate the Russians who were uh, military prisoners from Russian\ncivilians that had been sent back, but uh, they were always hungry. They uh, we'd give\nthem food sometimes but uh, there were so many of them. Uh, it just uh,...I don't I don't\nhave too many reco...detailed recollections except the masses uh, of them. We made them\nget off the road when we were moving our military forward though. And...",
        "A: Well, this...no...I've tried, I've tried to uh, to bring that back but I can't. Uh, uh, I do\nremember the large barracks, and I do remember uh, uh, opening an oven, but\nwhat...where that was in relation to other things, I I don't recall. There were so many\nthings happening and and frankly we were so tired. Uh, we had, we were moving\nsometimes uh, fifty or sixty miles a day and working day and night and uh, we were just\nuh, uh, we were just dead on our feet, and uh, one of the problems that we had in relation\nto this type of recollection is that uh, we were numb. Uh, we were emotionally numb.\nAnd so uh, many of those details are are difficult, uh, difficult to remember. Uh, some of\nmy memories are stimulated by the photos that I have, but I can't tell whether it's a it's a\nremembering or whether it's looking at the photo and that is impressed as a memory. Uh,\nuh, I do know that uh, you can see into the camp from outside of the camp. That 1s\ndefinite. Uh, I couldn't figure how in the how the people in the town didn't know what\nwas happening. I had heard uh, others say that they had been, that people had been shot\nright out or killed right out in broad daylight there. I didn't see it but that's uh, uh, that\ndoes tell how how open uh, it apparently was. Uh, additionally I'm not sure whether those\ntrains that we saw were coming in or going out. Uh, uh, I would assume that they were\ncoming in, however I've heard later that the Germans were moving them back, but we\nwere getting awfully close to the __ River so they didn't have very uh, very many other\nplaces to move them, and whether they had come from Buchenwald or not, uh, I don't\nknow. I assume that some of them had come from Buchenwald.",
        "A: Well, we uh, uh, in about uh, June or it must have been July because the 4th of July I\nspent in Germany. Uh, uh, the civil government came in and took over and we moved\nback to uh, back to France where as engineers we became the ones that maintained\nredeployment camps and uh, we uh, kept oh the water supply and roads and everything\nsuch as that, and we kept that up until October. Then I finally uh, got my orders to go\nhome and uh, I couldn't believe it. I got the Queen Elizabeth. (Laughter) And I'll never\nforget the difference between all the deprivations we had and then getting on the Queen\nElizabeth where we had waiters for our tables and uh, we could go to the bar and get\nscotch and soda and uh, oh that was heaven. (Laughter) And then when I got home, the\nfirst thing that I remember is the Red Cross being on the docks with great big uh, uh,\ntrucks loaded with milk, and they gave us all the milk we wanted. See we hadn't had milk\nfor oh two years, fresh milk, and that was the thing that we that we liked the most. But\nafter that I I landed about the 13th of October and I called my girlfriend up and told her I\nwas coming home, and she asked when and I told her and I got on the train on the 17th.\nMet her the 17th and the 18th we were married. And she's still with me, after forty-five\nyears. Is there anything else that I, that we might...I can't I can't think of anything\nelse...well, I I can add uh, there are uh, quite a few people who are in my uh, uh, in the\n238th Engineer Combat Battalion Association. We still meet. We've had forty-four\nmeetings, every year since then. It's a small group - five hundred people originally in it\nand we still have two hundred that are active. Many of those do remember uh, uh, the\nincidents. I've made several tapes which I've given to the uh, to the Holocaust Museum\nand uh, I'm having, we're having a meeting next week and at that time why uh, uh, we've\ninvited a member of the Holocaust Museum to come over and we'll talk in detail. One of\nthe things that that I have noticed uh, (cough), excuse me...uh, over the years uh, uh, why\nwe didn't talk about this, about Nordhausen, I don't know, but it was years before uh, we\nhad any discussion upon it. I never recall discussing Nordhausen in to any degree in any\nof our meetings. Now it wasn't because we wanted to put it out of our mind. It uh,...I\ndon't know. Uh, it was only after uh, we had uh, uh, found the photographs...uh, the\ncommanding officer had the photographs along with several hundred others of the\nbattalion and we got to discussing that and then I believe that uh, early in the 1980's that\nthere was a trend towards uh, publicizing the fact that all this happened, probably because\nof what I'd experienced...people denying that it existed, and uh, even today I find that\npeople in that unit are uh, rather reluctant to talk about it. Now why this is I don't know.\nIt may be because their memories have uh, have slipped. Uh, I could only find four or\nfive who would uh, uh, say that they recalled this. I've tried to get them to talk about it\nand uh, I can't. They'll say well, yes, I remember that but they won't go in to detail. I'm\nwondering if possibly they may have uh, unconsciously put it out of their minds. It was\nso horrible. Uh, I can't I cannot believe uh, in my own mind that people are are capable of\nthat, and in my own mind I think I do separate the actual accident or actual incident uh,\nwith the uh, with how it happened. Do you get what I mean? The uh, uh, the fact that\npeople did that versus the physical dead bodies is is to a degree separated in my own\nmind. I can't uh, I guess subconsciously I can't believe that it uh, that it could have been\ndone, yet uh, uh, the odor is still firmly impressed in my mind. Uh, if I smell a dead body\nof any kind I immediately think about that. So uh, it did happen. Uh, I I am pleased that\nthe uh, the Holocaust Museum and that others are uh, uh, trying to uh, document all of\nthis. I I believe in my own mind that if uh, if it isn't documented, more and more people\nare going to come by and say, did it really happen. I can say it happened because I saw it.\nBut those of us that saw it are probably within ten or fifteen years of not being here, and\nthere'll be nobody that saw it. And uh, these documentaries like this are the only thing\nthat will be existing uh, and so uh, I, every opportunity I get now I talk about it. I don't\nwant to hold back anything. The sordid details are very important uh, because they they\ntend to emphasize that man's inhumanity to man 1s is there and one other thing that I can\nsay...uh, uh, a little incident happened to me that uh, is unrelated to the Holocaust but it's\nrelated to the, to what can happen. We were crossing...we were building a bridge across\nthe Rhine River just before _ fell, and I was in charge of of preparing the the uh,\nenemy shore. We had crossed __, come up and had a slit of land north. This was near\n. We were cleaning out all of the uh, civilians that were in the area. We didn't\nwant any German in the area, so we just vacated their houses, kicked them out. Uh, they\ncould have gone over and thrown a bomb on our bridge and knocked it out. Anyhow uh,\neach officer took an enlisted man and uh, we went up one street and down the other,\nknocked on the door, uh, told the people they had to get out. They had ten minutes to get\nout. Where are they going to go? You go that way, and you'll be directed, and that\nwas...that way was back away from the Rhine River. I went up to this one house and\nknocked on the door and uh, as the person that was in there opened the door, this young\ncorporal from a little town in Kansas uh, was there with me. He snapped to, clicked his\nheels together, put his gun up like this, and all I could think was my God, a Nazi storm\ntrooper. I have never forgotten that incident, because here was young Mr. America. This\nis the all American boy, and we're in a position of power and he turned to a Nazi\nlike...man...I corrected him but I've never forgotten that. Given the right circumstances, it\ncan still happen.",
