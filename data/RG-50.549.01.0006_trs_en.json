        "Interview of William Loew\nA. My name is William Loew. They call me Bill and I am not\nbeing interviewed for my after the liberation part where I was\nliberated after 1945, April 23, 1945. It was a glorious day then\nand it's a great day today after so many years.\nQ. I want to go back just a little bit before that day, April\n23, and ask you because I wasn't completely clear from the\ninterview earlier how long were you in Auschwitz?",
        "A. Well, I arrived in Auschwitz on the day of my birthday and\nthat was October 29, 1944 and I came from Budapest, from Hungary.\nThat was the time where I was imprisoned by when I try to flee\nHungary into Rumania. I was sent by the underground organization",
        "that I used to work for. At that time I was a courier for that\norganization. I was caught on the border and brought back\nthrough different parts of Hungarian cities until they brought me\nback to Budapest. That's where I used to live for basically a\nfew months.",
        "I arrived in Budapest I think I escaped from Poland through\nSlovokia and then finally arrived in Hungary and from that city\nwhich I don't recall this point in time. I was brought back to\nBudapest where I was received by some people who used to deal\nwith the refugees and I received my papers. A refugee from\nPoland and I wanted to make sure that my status is a Gentile\nrather than Jewish for very obvious reasons. And the papers\nactually were falsified and my name was Budinski Neokivchov where",
        "I held that name after a very good friend of my from Poland from",
        ". So, I had those remembering days, those days\nactually are kind of vivid in my mind.\nQO. You said you don't have a lot of memories of Auschwitz?\nA. Very little. For a reason that I don't understand it and\nmaybe I'm trying to block it off subconsciously or not. I don't\nknow. I remember certain events. I remember events when I was\ngoing through the gate to so called -- that's a very vivid\nrecollection in that we were going through the gates and there\nwas an orchestra that was actually playing most of the time\nSousa's march and we had to keep our step with that march beat.\nThat was one of those events that I recall. The other things\nthat I recall that I had some sores on my neck and I couldn't\nclean them up or didn't have the medicine or didn't have the\ngauze didn't have the things to keep them clean and I didn't have\nany choice but to go to the clinic and the clinic was a notorious\nplace not to go for reasons that all kinds or rumors were among\nus, among the inmates. But I went there and to my surprise to m\npleasant surprise I met my doctor, my physician from Lamberg who\nwas also there as a prisoner and he recognized me and he helped\nme out with those sores. We had very little things to say to\neach other than he wished me luck and I wished him luck and\nhopefully we will meet again which we never did.",
        "This is other event that I recall. The other event was that\nthere was five police escapees that escaped from Auschwitz, I\nthink there were five and we were -- they caught them and brought\nthem back to the camp and that was the day that we were waking up",
        "William Loew 3",
        "at night and we had to stay outside. It was winter time. I\ndon't recall whether this was December or January. I think it\nwas December. It was already cold and it was already winterish.\nA lot of snow already on the ground. See Auschwitz is on the\nwestern part of Poland and it's pretty cold there. So, it was\nprobably the end of December and we were outside. Apparently not\nknowing what was going to happen, but rumors were that there will\nbe a public hanging and this is what happened. At dawn those\nfive Polish men got hung. Before they were hung, I heard\ndistinctly their outburst and their slogans for independent\nPolish state. Down with the tyranny and so on and then they were\nhung.",
        "We were outside basically almost all night and we were\nbasically almost numb but only by the event that was shown to us\nbut the physical endurance during the winter time it was quite\nvivid event.",
        "Q. They made you watch the hanging?\nA. Oh, yes. It was a lesson apparently for them to show to us\nwhat would happen if anyone would escape from the camp. Besides\nit was very difficult to escape. There were no cases that I know\nof to escape out of the Auschwitz camp. First of all, the camp\nwas surrounded by barb wires that were electrified with high\nvoltage that it was impossible. The only way you could possibly\nescape would be from some kind of outside work outside the camp",
        "William Loew 4\nthat you could probably sneak out, but I don't know of any cases.\nQ. Was there any physical abuse? Did you have anything happen\nto you while you were in Auschwitz?\nA. No, I was never abused per se, other than that general day\nby day intolerance and lack of food, lack of clothing, lack of\nSanitary provisions. There was one other event that I recall and\nthat was something very interesting to me and to many other of my\nstatus because I didn't know that I was a . <A\n1S a person who apparently by the status of the",
        "German or the camps regulations I was a person who has certain\nknowledge about things that they need to extract from me.\nBecause when I was caught on the boarder between Hungary and\nRumania, it was the time that they tagged me as a spy. And being\nas a spy I must have certain information, although they tried to\nextract this information back in , that was one of\nthe areas where they held me for a few days before they brought\nme back to Budapest. I didn't have basically any information for\nthem, but they didn't know that. They felt I had a lot of\ninformation. I was a young fellow. I think I was 17 or 18 years\nold, but they felt that they had information. So, when they\nbrought me from Hungary, from Budapest, it was a prison for\npolitical people, used to call it -- what was the name of it -- I\nforget. When they brought me from that political prison from\nBudapest to Auschwitz they gave me a special number, 193229,",
        "William Loew 5\nwithout any prefixes and that was a number that was assigned\nbasically to all those , all people, prisoners\nthat need to be preserved for a later time to extract certain\ninformation. But that was to my benefit because when there was a\nselection one day where they were selecting certain people, not\nknowing where they were going to go and I was selected to that\ngroup that I had to go somewhere, frankly I don't know where,\nthey pulled me out because of my number. That was the first time\nI realized that I'ma and everyone else was\ncurious about it and when they looked at my number they said oh,\nyou are a . You are a person to be preserved.",
        "That made my day that I was lucky enough to have that number.",
        "Other than those events, maybe there are some other events",
        "that I recall, very few. There was a friend of mine whom I was\nbrought from Budapest also on the same train. There were only a\nfew of us that we were brought from that prison. I think 13,\nthat was the number that comes to my mind and was\nanother fellow that we befriended actually in that prison there\nin Budapest so we kind of stuck together making sure that we\ntried to survive. We were together and we tried to help each. I\nrecall one day they were distributing bread extra bread to be\nconsumed by us but the bread was very stale. AS a matter of\nfact, moldy, and we were told later on that this bread was\nactually from another group from a train that was gathered from",
        "William Loew 6\nthose who were not as lucky as we were and brought in directly to\nthe chamber and that bread is being distributed now among other\nprisoners. There may be some other events but I don't recall.\nThere are only flashbacks that come to my mind.\nQ. You're saying the bread was for people who ended up going to\nthe gas chamber?\nA. That bread used to belong to them and then this bread was\ncollected and then distributed among the prisoners.\nQ. Can you tell me about the circumstances that led up to\nliberation, the weeks, the time what you remember about just\nbefore liberation, where you were?\nA. Well, liberation was not on our minds because there was a\nvery bleak conditions for that. I recall being in Flosenberg\nthere was little thing that I remember out of Flosenberg. There\nwas the only event in Flosenberg that I recall is when President\nRoosevelt died. That was the time when all hopes that we had\nkind of vanished. Somehow we were connecting with his longevity,\nwith his presence with our liberation. So, when he died, the\nhope also died within us, at least with me. So, it was kind of a\nbleak day at that time.",
        "I don't remember too much from Flosenberg. They gave us\nsome camp money for the chores that we were doing over there and\nI don't recall the work that I had done for them, but I do\nremember I used to get some printed some type of camp money which",
        "William Loew 7\nI have it still. One mark, and I met since a man who actually\nused to be in Flosenberg and he found me or I found him through\nmy daughter Jennifer, who works with the Holocaust Museum, and\nthis man, his name is Harry , who was trying to find\nother inmates, others who were actually in Flosenberg and she\noverheard that and she pointed out to him about me. We got in\ntouch and we became very good friends. He visited me here last\nyear and he has great memories he recalled a lot of things I\nstill don't understand, don't know what it was but he knows it.\nHe remembers a train that came to Flosenberg from Auschwitz and\nhe says that train and those people who were on the train was a\nsore lot. Very, very sore and hardly walking people. I was one\nof them, of that train. Because we were on that train in open\ncarts that they hauled us from Auschwitz all the way through part\nof Poland, part of Germany through - If don't know all\nthese days how long we were there, but we were frozen. I\ndeveloped a lot of frostbites on my feet and which I don't recall\nany more other than I still have those physical remains on my\ntoes. But Harry, he remembers. He knows what shape we came in\nand I recovered and I recovered rather fast because when we were\nabout to move out of Flosenberg I felt pretty good. I felt\nstrong enough. It was probably April the 20th or so, in 1945.\nWhen the rumors were that we were moving out of this camp,\nFlosenberg, to Dachau and we would be traveling. So, I felt",
        "William Loew 8\nstrong enough. I never met Harry on that and some of these\ncolumns that we were with the rest of my friends.\nThere was one young man also from Russia that I befriended,\na very nice fellow, but his face colors were very grayish and he\ndidn't look good to me at all and I wasn't sure whether he's\ngoing to survive this trip. But I stayed with him.\nQ. You took care of him?\nA. Yes, I did, at time. Whenever he was really wobbly we were\ntogether and it was one of those nights that as we were walking\nand they gave us a rest and we would be resting in some of the\nditches on the way to Dachau and it was one of those nights that\nhe disappeared and I never found him. He was gone.\nQ. Do you know what happened to him?\nA. No, I don't know. I never met him. I never found him. He\njust disappeared from me that night. That was the time that we\nwere completely exhausted, everyone was exhausted so that few\nminutes that we had to rest we immediately fall asleep and\nstrangely enough even until today when i am very tired and try to\nrest I have the same feeling of succumbing into that deep sleep\nthat I had then. It's a good feeling in a way because at least\nnow I don't have to wake up for the next walk. Here I am safer.\nQO. You have that feeling when you're really tired?\nA. Right, right, and that still prevails. It's a very, very\ndeep almost resigned feeling, and that still prevails. On the",
        "William Loew 9\none hand that's the flashback that I usually get when I rest and\njust before I fall asleep.\nQO. What kinds of associations does it have?\nA. It is that trip. It is that trip that gives you being\nexhausted, having no hope, just walk and no hope for the future,\nalthough it's kind of mixed now other than you're very tired.\nBut that flashback always comes back.\nQO. How often do you have it?\nA. Whenever I'm tired. Whenever I am very exhausted. In fact,\nworking here in my vineyard it's a lot of work involved and\nthat's when I'm ready to rest, when I'm ready to take a nap,\nthat's the time it comes in, that undescribable feeling, and that\nprobably remains for the rest of my life.\nQ. Tell me, you never made it to Dachau?\nA. Right, I never made it to Dachau, none of us made it to\nDachau. The only time that I remember is that this was probably\na very nice day. Obviously we were liberated. It was April 23,\n1945. It was a beautiful day at that time as I recall for a\nnumber of reasons. We were on the way to Dachau and I don't\nrecall too much about that other than as we were walking in those\ncolumns, all of a sudden we heard some roaring sounds, and these\nwere actually the sounds from tanks. It was American tanks and\nbefore we knew that, there were the guards who were guarding us\nas we were walking, all of a sudden were running onto the forest",
        "William Loew 10",
        "because we were going through part of a forest. And they're",
        "running and apparently it was known already that the Americans\nare behind us and some of our inmates, some of colleagues were\nrunning after the guards. I wasn't capable. I was exhausted.",
        "Some people were in much better shape than I was. I don't recall",
        "from there on anything. Harry remembers alot of those things.",
        "Q. What's the next thing that you remember?",
        "A. The guards running away.",
        "Q. The American troops coming and what's your next memory after",
        "that?",
        "A. The next memory was where am I and with whom do I associate.\nVery little other than we are all of a sudden in no man's land.\nBasically yes, we are happy, but how and where are we going to",
        "go, and I don't recall at that point anything other than seeing",
        "those tanks roaring and thrusting ahead into the columns were\nactually split on both side of the road and the tanks kept on\ngoing.",
        "QO. Did you have any interaction with the troops?",
        "A. No, not at all. Not that I recall. Obviously we were very",
        "happy to see them. The only time that I recall of me walking",
        "into that village, and I think it was named .",
        "That's the village that I recall. From there on I again, just a",
        "matter of recomposition of your own life.",
        "Q. When did you realize that you were free?",
        "William Loew 11\nA. That's a good question. I wasn't sure. I'm not sure, but I\nwas free I felt strange, but there's no question about it, I was\nfree. The only question was from here on how do I recompose\nmyself not knowing too much of where I was. What do I do from\nhere.\nQO. What did you do?\nA. I didn't do too much. I went to this village and one of the\nhouses that we stayed was which I recall very little, it seems to\nme that I ate but there is very little that I recall from there.\nQ. Do you remember your first meal?\nA. I don't recall although I remember that that was the time\nthat my stomach was really upset for a number of days because of\nthe food I was consuming or the food I didn't consume. So, it\nwas a number of days before I realized that I had to be a little\nmore reasonable with my intake.\nQO. You were eating too much?\nA. I don't know.\nQ. You just didn't feel good?\nA. I didn't feel right. It was just a matter I needed more of\na rest. Rest and to gather my thought and to reconstruct my\nwhole system. My whole system was out of order. There was a\ntime that I recall when I was in one working on a road with some\nother of my colleague and a jeep came through with American\nsoldiers. There were three of them and they asked us certain",
        "William Loew 12\nguestions and I was the only one that I had some knowledge of the\nEnglish language, and they asked me whether I would like to join\nthem because they're going to Bumberg, and not knowing where\nBumberg was and not knowing where we are then, I felt that any\nplace other than here would be an improvement. So, I said I\nwould like to go with them, and they took me in that jeep and I\nrecall that we were traveling for 10 or 12 hours overnight and\nthey brought me to Bumberg, but they didn't know where to put me\nso they invited me to their shelters. It was a barracks.\nBarracks where the American G.I.s stayed. I remember this was\nthe first division 16 Infantry and they invited me and I could\ncommunicate with them, and I stayed with them. I liked them.\nThey liked me and they felt that they could use me for purposes\nbecause they did have a lot of German prisoners and I could help\nthem in interpreting some of their cases.\nSo, I became an interpreter and they gave me a uniform, a\nG.I. uniform --.\nQO. An American uniform?\nA. An American uniform, so I felt I was one of them and I\nstayed in their barracks. So, I wasn't a soldier but I was\nworking for them. It was very interesting because I had now a\nchance to interrogate some of the German prisoners.\nSo, I worked there for a number of months.",
        "QO. What kind of questions would you ask them?",
        "William Loew 13\nA. Well, basically those questions were related mostly to where\nthey're from. Their ranks, how come they were in the area of\nBomberg. Mostly they were from the east part of Germany. Some\nof them were from the south part of Germany. None of them had\nuniforms. They all were in civilian clothing, but they were\nactually German soldiers.\nI don't recall of any SS people being interrogated, mostly\n. It was questioned that they had to feel out\napparently and to process some of these soldiers one way or\nanother. They were not be released. They still had to be\nincarcerated for a time being but later on I remember a column of\nthose Germans just left and maybe they went to a different camp.\nQ. What was your attitude towards them?\nA. My attitude was ambilivent. I didn't compose myself yet. I\nwasn't sure what to do with my life and I was confused in many\nways. I wasn't angry in that sense. It doesn't mean that I\nliked them. It was just a matter I didn't want to have anything\nto do with them. Not that they were responsible for what was\ndone to me or my family, they may not have been responsible, I\ndon't know. But I didn't have enough time to build up the anger.\nThe anger was there but it was tame. That's the kind of\nattitude I had at that time.\nQO. It was tamed?\nA. Tamed yes.",
        "William Loew 14\nQ. You weren't allowing yourself --\nA. I was controlled. I controlled myself a lot, so maybe\nbecause I was organized then. Maybe because of a lot of things\nthat I wasn't sure what may happen or should happen to my life.\nBut my main goal was not to be involved with things that will not\nrelate to my life because I need to reconstruct my life. That\nwas my main objective. How do you do that without any family,\nwithout any friends, without any advisors. You're on your own.\nYou have seen a lot but that doesn't bring you to a point that\nyou could do a lot with your life.\nQO. How did you go about reconstructing your life?\nA. I was basically very methodical in doing things that I need\nto do. First thing after when I used to live on those barracks I\nfelt first of all I had to get out of there and to see what other\nthings I have to do outside the barracks. And it was a good\nfeeling to be there, but on the other hand I had to get out of\nthere and to join the other people who actually in town. Also\nJewish survivors, and in fact there was a committee that\norganized in Bomberg and I joined that committee.",
        "In fact they issued identification card for all of us who\nwere actually in the area of Bomberg and I got one. I still have\nit and in that picture that you identify yourself I was in that\nG.I. uniform and it gives you certain information, where I am\nfrom, where I was born, the date I was born, and that I am",
        "William Loew 15\nidentified and that I'm registered in that Bomberg Jewish\ncommunity.",
        "Then I found that while I was there I really didn't feel\ngood. I was run down. It was a very false feeling that after\nthe liberation everything is fine. Your system is fine, and this\nwas a false signal. I wasn't fine. I was in fact in bad shape.",
        "I was run down, and I went to a doctor to find out whether or\nnot what it is the problem that I am so run down. In fact I did\nhave a case of tuberculosis. I go back to a sanitorium to be\ntaken care of and that was from Bomberg I left to a hospital --\nSanitorium rather than a hospital, to bring back my health and I\nstayed there for more than a year before I got help.",
        "Q. Where was the sanitarium?\nA. That was not far from Munich called . In\nthere were a number of us, none of whom I recall but\nthere was one person that I met in whom I met in\nBudapest that was also in the same condition. He also got sick\nand he was trying to get better. So, I met him in Budapest and\nwe all tried to survive in Budapest and it was a good meeting for\nhim. We tried to recall the small events that we had together.\nwas a Sanitorium maybe held three to four\nhundred survivors. They were all in run down condition and it\ntakes a long time to really recuperate. It took me more than a\nyear to recuperate.",
        "William Loew 16\nBut during that time of recuperation I took courses because\nI needed to get back into my schooling. So, I took the high\nschool courses to finish up what I had to do, because my goal was\nback to the school, to college and to get a degree.\nwas not far from Munich where major universities were and when I\nfinished my high school courses I took an entrance exam into\nwhich is basically the engineering college in\nMunich. I passed that and they took me in and from to\nMunich was a train and it was there while I was\nrecuperating.\nAnd I went there for two years and then I finished only two\nyears of the major science courses before I left for .\nThat's in Bavaria. There's another place where we would be\ngetting rehabilitation. It was a welcome sign that I was already\nin much better shape than when I came into and I\nstayed there for a number of months. JI still didn't finish my\nschool. I wanted to finish my school. I took some other courses\nthere in .\nThen I got a call from a friend of mine and this time it was\na call from Umberg and that was a name it was not camp but it was\na major center for people -- for displaced persons who were\ntrying to get to the United States. Again, they were trying to\nrecruit some interpreters for American Embassy to help out the\nprocess for the displaced person.",
        "William Loew 17\nSo, they recruited me as interpreter for those people. And",
        "there were all kinds of people there from different countries.\nThere were Polish there were Russians and there were Slovaks and\nthere were German Jews and so on, and the first thing they asked\nme to do is to interpret all their regulations into--\nEnd of Tape 1",
        "William Loew 18\nTape 2",
        "A. Interpret that and write them into those languages that that\nperson may be more familiar. So, all the regulations I\ntranslated that. Some were in Yiddish, some were in Polish, some\nwere in RusSSian and German. So, I translated all those\nregulations ina clear language so that they would be comfortable\nwith because they were not knowledgeable in the English language.",
        "That was my job plus the job was that I would be in presence of\nthe I call them ambassadors, when he was interviewing the\nprospective immigrants.\nQO. American?\nA. American, yes. I stayed there for a number of months\nhelping them out. There was actually three of them that I would\nwork for.\nQO. Can I go back a little bit and just ask you between that job\nand before that job what did you do for money? How did you\nSupport yourself?\nA. Well, during the time that I was in that\nalready was subsidized by the German government and given the\ntime when I was in and that was only a few months\nthere was also subsidized by UNRO. This was United Nations\nRelief Organization. I think that's what they called it.",
        "William Loew 19",
        "So basically we were taking care of -- we didn't have any\nmoney but at least we were helped out by those organizations.\nQO. Did you have any possessions?\nA. I did not. I did not have any money. I did not have any\npossessions. I was -- I felt that I should have but I didn't. I\nwas in process of getting there so it didn't bother me.\nQO. Clothes?\nA. That was again helped out by the major organizations so I\ndid not have any income.\nQ. What did you know about -- you hadn't heard what had\nhappened to your older brothers or your mother. During that\nperiod did you try to find out what happened to your family?\nA. Well, my family was decimated so I didn't have any hope for\nAbe, which was my older brother. He was killed in Lamberg. My\nmother was taken away in one of the actions, meaning they taken\naway thousands and thousands of us and my mother was one of them\nthat took her away not knowing where.",
        "Most likely to one of the camps and we did have a camp in",
        "called camp. There were some\nmassacres over there but only in terms of thousands but the real\ndestruction camps were somewhere else, in Treblinka and some\nother camps that I don't even know. Now there were destruction\ncamps in hundreds of thousands so I'm not quite sure but I think\nthey took away my mother in one of those camps.",
        "William Loew 20\nQ. You weren't able to find out for sure what happened?\nA. There was no way to find out. The only time that I recall\nabout my brother Eli who apparently was in camp and I\nwas told that he escaped and I tried to rescue him and I couldn't\nrescue him to bring him back to the place I worked in\nfabric, that was in Lamberg, .",
        "I was one of the 40 Jews who were on the premises of that\nfactory and when I found that when I heard that my brother Eli is\nin one of the ghettos during one of the actions that he's seeking\nmy help, that was the time that I left the factory with armband\nusing a W with a stamp of SS that I am in good standing working\nfor the German , German enterprises. I went to the\nghetto to look for him and the way I understood from a lady where\nthe place was apparently that Eli was supposed to be there and\nshe told me that they took him away. I was too late, because I\nwas going to bring him back to the factory.",
        "There were some other people on the premises but hidden in\nthe factory. There was a wall constructed that I later found out\nand behind that wall were some members of the family of the\nfriends who used to work there, and that was the time that I\nwanted to bring Eli to that place and most likely he would be\nable to work for us, but I was too late.",
        "After the war, knowing how resourceful Eli was, I thought he\nmay have survived. There were all kinds of rumors that someone",
        "William Loew 21\nsaw him here or there and in fact I got a call, I got some\ninformation that Eli was seen somewhere in France, in Paris so I\nsent out all kinds of advertisements seeking him. I never got\nany answers to my search.",
        "So, I didn't find Eli. I knew about Abe that he was dead\nand my mother was gone to one of the transportation. The rest of\nthe family, Aunt Miriam, she disappeared from us in the very\nearly part of the ghetto. So, the immediate family was gone.",
        "The uncles and their families we were 80 people strong in\nour immediate family. They were all gone. So there was no hope\nfor me to find anyone alive from Europe. The only ones that were\nleft was one that I knew there was somebody in Argentina, Uncle",
        ", and someone in Israel from my mother's side, the\nfamily and they were alive and it was later on that\nI got in touch with.\nQO. A little bit more about the job you had at the displaced\npersons camp in Homburg, but first I wanted to ask you -- Umberg,\nif you could tell me about some of the friends you made between\nthe time you were liberated and the time you went to work at the\ndisplaced persons camp?\nA. Well, the friends that I cultivated since 1945 were probably\nquite a few and frankly I don't know where they are although some\nof them are in Israel, some are in the United States. There was\na fellow with whom we studied together for college. His name is",

        ", there were two brothers and they immigrated here to\nthe United States. Another fellow who we studied also together\nhe went to Israel. We kept some communication with each other.\nThere's another fellow that I stayed with in . His\nname is Rabinovitz and he left for Switzerland to continue to\nrecuperate. Since that time he actually got married and he\nbecame a designer, a show designer and he was apparently quite\nsuccessful in what he was doing.",
        "I did get in touch with him a number of times. There are\nmany acquaintances that I have and had but we are so far apart\nthat we didn't continue to cultivate each other because of the\ndaily things that we had to do on our own and frankly I don't\nknow where they are. There was one fellow who actually I got in\ntouch a number of times Max who is in New York and\nhe is retired now and so we are still in touch.",
        "QO. Can you pick up the story being in Umberg working -- and",
        "that's in Bavaria and that's 1948?",
        "A. 1948, yes.",
        "Q. And you were working as an interpreter for the Americans?",
        "A. Yes.",
        "QO. What happened there and if you can pick it up from there and",
        "you continued to get your life together?",
        "A. The work in Umberg was very interesting work. Apparently",
        "this was my first work place that I experienced in fact it was.",
        "William Loew 23\nIt was very nice surrounding. It was an office, obviously. I\nhad an embassy office that we were processing the displaced\npersons, people who were trying to immigrate to the United\nstates.",
        "IT used to work for three -- I really don't know what was\ntheir title and I should know but I forget. But I used to call\nthem Ambassador, there was Ambassador Mochay from Massachusetts,\nAmbassador Moody and I think Ambassador Frank and they were all\nnice gentlemen that I used to work for. In fact when I was about\nto leave the embassy and to immigrate to the United States all of\nthem gave me a letter of recommendation for me to continue in my\nwork and wished me a lot of luck. Especially William Mochay from\nMassachusetts. Then I tried to get in touch later on and was\nvery unsuccessful, I couldn't find him. He was a very dear\nperson. A very nice man. He was very sensitive and he was very a\nno nonsense person but he was very human and very reasonable to\nthe all the applicants that he was processing.",
        "QO. What was the camp like?\nA. It wasn't a camp. It was a place, a building a huge\nbuilding probably one time a German court or a German building\nthat certain processes were conducted and it was taken over by\nthe displaced people and an embassy was erected over there and\nthey were processing those displaced persons. Thousands and\nthousands of those applicants were going through. For one thing,",
        "William Loew 24\nthe regulations that were prevalent at that time that no person\nwho was illiterate must enter the United States. The people who\nwere actually in good standing without any conviction, who were\nnot convicted and people who were able to work were eligible to\nenter the United States. It goes without saying that the people\nhad to be healthy and had to go through certain physical\nexaminations and so on.",
        "These were the requisites and one of the requisites of\ncourse as I mentioned before is that they had to be literate and\nspeak at least one language and must read that language. This is\nwhere I interpreted some of those regulations. Those applicants\nhad to read in their chosen language and understood so that they\ncould be productive citizens in the United States.",
        "There was one Jewish family that I recall that applied for\nUnited States and the way they were reading those regulations was\nsuspicious by Mr. Mochay and he whispered to me saying that he\ndoesn't think that they are reading those regulations and he was\nright. When I looked at them before they were sitting right in\nfront of Mr. Mochay's desk, there were more fearful than anything\nelse but they were not reading the regulations and I asked them\nin the Polish language whether they read the regulations in\nPolish and they say no. And I said well what language do you\nread and the woman said they don't read any of those that we have\nprepared for them. Then I turned some of these papers and some",
        "William Loew 25\nof the regulations that I wrote were actually in Yiddish which\nhad also Hebrew lettering but they were in Yiddish. I was sure\nthat they would read that and to my surprise they were looking at\nit and they didn't read that. So, they were -- it proved to me\nthat they were illiterate. I looked at Mr. Mochay and I said I\ndon't think that those people read any of those papers because\nthey are unfamiliar with those languages, although they speak\nthem, they don't read them.",
        "Then I asked this woman what do they read and she said none\nof them and I looked at this man who had a beard and he appeared\nto me aS a pious man and I asked him do you know how to",
        ", which means do you know how to pray, in Hebrew, and\nhe says yes. At that point I ran out of the office and looking\nfor a Hebrew prayer book, whether or not he'll be able to read\nthat. I open up the section where they have big lettering of",
        "and I brought this over and I showed it to him and\nI said read this. Do you know how to read this? And he says\n. He read by heart rather than by the contents in\nthe seder, the prayer book. When I went back to my ambassador\nMr. Mochay, he said they don't speak any of those languages but\nthey read Hebrew. And they did. He knew everything by heart and\nhe passed the test.\nQO. And he went to America?\nA. He was processed.",
        "William Loew 26\nQ. The whole family?\nA. The whole family because he was the household member and he\nwas the one who would take care of the household family. There\nwere some other acquaintances that I made in that embassy that I\ndidn't know where they went. It was a short episode. It was a\nmemorable episode. It was nice to work with them.\nQO. What were your goals at this point? It was 1948?\nA. It was 1948 and I kept on going, and now the goals that I\nhad somehow to move out of Germany. The question is where do I\ngo and obviously there is one possibility of us to go to\nPalestine which I got in touch with my cousin on my mother's side\nand he felt that the time was very bad at that time because the\nwar was going on between the Israeli Jews and the Arabs. Another\ntime that I felt that I may want to go possibly to Australia or\nUnited States but Mr. Mochay felt that I would have a good\nopportunities here in the United States. His name was Bill and\noccasionally I called him Bill but mostly Mr. Mochay. A very\nnice person, and he actually convinced me to come to the United\nstates.\nQO. How did he do that?\nA. I really don't know what he talked a lot, he talked a lot\nabout the United States. That was his favorite topic and he also\ngot in touch with a Jewish agency for them to sponsor me to come\nto the United States and that's what he did. The Jewish Agency",
        "William Loew 27\nactually sponsored me at his intervention I suppose because I\nnever made that attempt, but he did. And so the papers went\nthrough without any problems and that year that was in '49 that I\ngot my papers and Mr. Mochay interviewed me for this exit and it\nwas a memorable day. I felt very good about it and I left and\nthat was something in October 1949 that I left Umberg and all my\nacquaintances for Homburg and I boarded on a ship called General\nHosey. It took us about 11 days, two stormy days and the ocean\nwas kind of stormy but we finally arrived in New York. The\nprocess of entering as I recall was very simple. I didn't have\nany complications. My papers called for my name Willy Loew.\nThat was the day when I went on a bus from New York port of entry\nand I arrived in New Jersey in Lindon New Jersey. There was two\nladies that welcomed me from the Jewish agency.",
        "One of the ladies was named Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Slesinger\nand they were very nice ladies and they knew that I did not\nfinish my schooling. They knew that I have some electronic\nbackground because of my schooling in Germany and the one thing\nthat they wanted to make sure that I get a job and be on my own.",
        "That's exactly what I did.",
        "It was that I joined a family in Roselle New Jersey, their\nname was Kohn and I tried to get a job immediately and I got a\njob as an electrician, as an assistant electrician and to work my\nway out and I was getting paid I think 75 cents an hour. That",
        "William Loew 28\napparently was a good pay. So, by the time I finished a week I\nwould getting paid like $25. I had to pay $25 to the Kohn family\nand that's what I got. I got paid $34.75. I owed them every\nweek like a quarter. So, I didn't have any money per se and I\nasked Mr. White who was the owner of this electrical company if I\ncould work some overtime to get some extra money, which he did\nand I worked there for a number of weeks. But there was a time\nwhere it was still difficult to work on those wages because I had\nto pay the $25 to that family of Kohn and I didn't want to be\nbehind and I didn't have any extra money for myself.",
        "So my goal at that point in time was first of all get a\nbetter job, or a little bit more money and then go back to\nschool. Now, I used to live in Lindon, New Jersey and the\ncolleges, there was one Rutgers University, and Newark College of\nEngineering. Newark College of Engineering also changed recently\nto New Jersey Institute of Technology but at that time was still\nNewark College of Engineering.",
        "I inquired what are the prospects of me finishing my degree.",
        "They were good prospects but then I had to either go to school\non a full time basis or go to school night time. So, it was\nobvious I had to go at night time and I could possible transfer\nall my credits from Germany onto this Newark College of\nEngineering which I wouldn't have had any problem of transferring\nthose credits.",
        "William Loew 29",
        "But there again, it was tough for me because that was back\nin 1951, beginning of '51 that my health actually was again\nquestionable. So, I went back to sanitorium. Again my health\nwasn't in good shape so I stayed there again for another few\nmonths before I regained my health.",
        "During that time again I was preparing myself to go back to\nschool. New Jersey is a very good state. They picked up the tab\nof the hospital. They knew I didn't have any money and it was in\nthe sanitorium in New Jersey. When I got out since I\nhad some electrical background, I joined a company called\nAmerican Company and they were dealing with television\ninstallations. That was the time at first, that was 1950 and '5l1\nthat was when a television became very popular and I joined them\nand I had a very good prospect of livelihood. At that time they\noffered me $1 an hour and that was pretty good in view of the\nfact that the expenses were high but I could live on that and I\nwas saving some money, whatever I could to purchase a car because\nI needed a car to get places and also to go back to school. That\nwas my goal. The goal was clearly defined that I needed to get\nto school and lived in New Jersey from Newark it was about maybe\nten miles or more so the transportation with the bus would be\nvery difficult and I felt that I needed to save on my health\nrather than on anything else.",
        "So, I saved the money to purchase a car. I purchased a car,",
        "William Loew 30\ncalled Hudson. It was a low gravity car. It was built like a\ntank. It was guzzling a lot of gas but it was good. It was a\nnice car and then I was still looking for more of a challenge for\nmyself in terms of finding work that would pay me more but more\nrelated to engineering because at that time even working for the\nACE which is the American Company of Electronics, I think that's\nwhat they called themselves, the owner's name was Gene Brown.\nAlthough they gave me work basically installing antennas on a\nroof which was okay at the time, but I couldn't see a future in\nthat and I told them so that I would like to work on a bench\nrepairing television sets, which he did eventually and I was\nrepairing television. It came in kind of easy for me. I was\nable to fix television reading on my own the technology of\ntelevision.",
        "Then I befriended a fellow who was already also a refugee\nbut met him through another acquaintance. He used to work for\nGeneral Instrument. General Instrument was a company that was\nbuilding and designing television tuners, which is directly in\nthe line I would have been for me working in an engineering\natmosphere.",
        "I took an entrance exam with that company and I passed and I\nwas assistant engineer to a man who was designing television\nreceivers, television tuners and shortly after I was in charge of\ntelevision receivers and television tuners evaluating and testing",
        "William Loew 31\nthem. While I was there, that was 1952 and 1953, I applied for\nadmittance for Newark College of Engineering and while I was\nworking during the day, I was able to go at night to school to\ncomplete my engineering degree. In 1955 I got my degree in\nengineering and from there on I was working with General\nInstrument. A very fine company in engineering.",
        "I made very good friends there, in fact, friends that we are\nstill together. Ron that later on from General\nInstrument from Elizabeth New Jersey we moved out to Newark New\nJersey and I met him over there in this company which was a part\nof General Instrument and Sid who was a mechanical\nengineer. Sylvan was an electronic engineer, Sid was\na mechanical engineer. I myself was also an engineer working\nwith them together designing television tuners. Well, they're\nall retired now and after four years of communication we're still\ntogether and occasionally get together on special events, mostly\nweddings and occasional visits from them and we visit them\noccasionally.",
        "The time flies back in a hurry because it's when you work\nfor a certain company you continue, you need to expand your\nexperience and I worked for General Instrument since 1952 until\n1960 I think and at that time I recall that I got a call from a\nfriend of mine who joined the Ford company in Philadelphia and he\ntold me that there is an opening for a project at the Ford",
        "William Loew 32\nCompany to do some design work and I felt that this would be an\nopportunity for me to join that company plus gaining some more\nexperience in electronics. And I moved at that time from New\nJersey to Philadelphia.",
        "This was a contract by Ford Company by the government,\nSpread Eagle, that's what they called it. That's how they had to\nhire so many people for this particular project. It happened so\nthat the Ford Company lost the contract for a reason that I don't\nknow and I felt that I'm not going to wait for another project.\nBut that Ford Company and I was looking for another job and\nanother opportunity came in St. Louis. In St. Louis a company\ncalled Emerson Electric were designing fire control systems for\nB-58. So they were recruiting engineers and I applied for that\nposition and I worked there in Emerson Electric for a number of\nyears. At least three years I think. This was '59 to 1962. And\nI gained a lot of experience there. And the engineers at that\ntime were known as the gypsies because they were moving from\nplace to place and I was offered another position in Indianapolis\nin Indiana to work for the Mallory Company.",
        "They were building at that time in Mallory batteries and\ncomponents for electronic systems. They wanted to go into a new\nbusiness which is called microelectronics dealing with minute\nelements of components like resisters, diodes and so on and they\nneeded an engineer to organize that part. They selected me and I",
        "William Loew 33\njoined them and worked out the discreet components and not only\nwas I working on the design for it, but I also miniaturized\nelectronic systems using those components for the micro elements\nthat the industry was going in that direction. Everything had to\nbe miniaturized.",
        "Of course in any attempt of miniaturization the transistors\nand microchips surfaced all of a sudden and the diodes, the chips\nthemselves, although they were in minute form a tremendous\nprogress was shown at that time that those chips will take hold\nin the electronic industry and would take off in a hurry.",
        "It was at that time that Mallory had to make a decision\nwhether of not to go into micro electronics for the discreet\ncomponents, investing a lot of money of abandon this completely\nin view of the fact that the chip companies especially IBM and\nother Intel and other companies are coming out with micro\nelectronics that could easily compete with the discreet\ncomponents.",
        "So, I had to make a decision at that time which way to go\nand again I was called -- I got a call from General Instrument,\nmy Old company, would I like to join them and that company then\nwas not in Newark New Jersey, but they expanded and they had some\nother outlets in design engineering in Massachusetts, Chicapa.\nthat is the place where they recruited me to work on new designs\non television tuners and that is not only very high frequency",
        "William Loew 34\ntuners but also the ultra high frequency tuners.",
        "That was a time when I wa pretty much comfortable that I\ncould help them out and I joined them again. But prior to that,\nbefore I joined them, I met a lovely lady, Lois, and I met her\nand I married her in Brown County in . She was at\nthat time a working psychologist. She finished her degree and\nshe has her masters in psychology and she wanted to continue in\nthe psychology discipline.",
        "QO. What year was this?\nA. This was in 1962. We married -- a lovely lady -- glad to\nhave met her.\nQO. And you have been married how long.\nA. We've been married since 1962 so -- it seems like we've been\nmarried so long but it's been a breeze.\nQ. Do you have any children?\nA. We had three children. The oldest is Jennifer. The middle\none is Amy and the youngest is Karen. They all are married,\nhappily married. Jennifer is married to a very nice young man,\nDaniel Mendleson. Jennifer is working for the Holocaust Museum\nin the information part of the Holocaust Museum. Denny is a\nconsultant in health issues. Amy is a school teacher and she has\nher own degree also as a consulting person for the school system.\nShe also has her master's degree. She's married to a very nice\nyoung man, Steve Litman, he's going to be a CPA. He's an",
        "William Loew 35\naccountant now. They have two children, so I am a grandfather\nand I have two grandchildren. The youngest one is Karen married\nto a very nice young man Steve Boden and he's a teacher in auto\nmechanics, very resourceful and a fine young man. So, we have a\nwonderful family.\nQO. I'm curious about how you told your children and your\ngrandchildren if you've talked to them about your experience\nabout the Holocaust.\nA. No, I never mentioned anything to my grandchildren, well\nfirst of all the grandchildren are tiny. They youngest, Alex, is\nonly over a year old so he's got a wonderful --\nEnd of Tape 2",
        "William Loew 36\nTape 3\nQO. -- and a very happy young fellow. And Rachel, she's three\nyears old so she wouldn't be able to understand that. But to my\nown children, I never talked to them about my experiences. Every\nso often only I'll just flash through some event that I recalled\nand I will tell them that, and they would be very much interested\nin that, but I would stop at that point. I just wouldn't\nelaborate on that. There's no reason for it, for me to go\nthrough and frankly I'm not that comfortable in disclosing\neverything that was through my life, my past life. There was no\nreason for that and they should know it -- well, they know it\nnow. I made that information available to the Holocaust Museum\nand if they are interested in it, they could view it, they could\nread it and they know it now.",
        "Those events that I flashed through my lifetime, everything\nhad its own point that they could actually combine it together,\nso they know it pretty much what I went through and they're\ncurious and rightly so. If they ask questions about a specific\nevent I could tell them, and I will tell them, and I told them,\nbut I don't elaborate on that point. I'm not reluctant but I'm\nnot enthusiastic. So, whatever they ask questions I do it. I'd\nrather live the present life rather than my past life. There's",
        "William Loew 37\nno glory in that, in the past. The only time that you want is to\nknow that things are not forgotten, but it mustn't be prolonged.",
        "There's no need for that.\nQO. You mentioned earlier about when you get tired at a certain\npoint you remember that march from on the way to\nDachau. Are there other things in your life that trigger\nmemories, music or smells or anything from the Holocaust\nexperience?\nA. Yes, there are many unpleasant memories that would trigger\nme but I would never relay that to my family.\nQO. Not necessarily to my family but to yourself?\nA. Yes, there was the time when I recall when I was on the\ntrain from Auschwitz to apparently I finally wound up in\nFlosenberg and on my way -- again, two events that come to my\nmind is the one that we were actually in open carts on the train\nand it was a very freezing day. It was the winter time. It was\nin January, and when they were making stops at certain stations,\nI recall that they would pull out the dead bodies out of those\ncars and some of them and they were piling them up on the side of\nthe tracks. Some of them were still alive and there was one that\nI recall that he would be shooting them and they're alive. Maybe\nthis 1S a better way to die than to suffer ina pile of bodies.\nThat was one of the events. Well, those stops were more frequent\nand those piles were also more frequent.",
        "William Loew 38",
        "We went through also Czechoslovakia in open carts and as we\nwere traveling through Czechoslovakia I recall in those open\ncarts people were standing on the overpass and they were throwing\nbread into the open carts and I thought this was a nice gesture\nfrom the Czechoslovakian people, whatever they could offer us,\nand they did. This was a little happier event.",
        "QO. Do you ever have nightmares about your experience in the",
        "war?",
        "A. IT used to. I used to and I don't have them any more. Every\nso often I would, but I did have a lot of nightmares.",
        "QO. What were they of?",
        "A. Well, they were horrible feelings. You would try to get\naway and you cannot get away. You run and you feel like you're",
        "being trapped and you cannot get away. It's a terrible feeling.\nOccasionally I would wake up and it was much better then.",
        "But those feelings, those nightmares, I don't have them\nanymore, at least I don't know, at least I don't dream that much.\nQO. You were on the run for quite a while when you left your\nvillage and before you ended up getting caught. How long did it\ntake for you to feel as though you weren't running anymore after\nthe war was over. Do you still feel like you're running?",
        "A. Well, the feeling of running was constant event with me. As",
        "long aS you were ina strange country, as long as you were on",
        "false papers, say in Budapest which supposedly is a free country,",
        "William Loew 39\nbut I was on false papers. I arrived in Budapest for example in\nJanuary and it wasn't occupied at that time by the Germans, but I\nthink in February they occupied. So, until February I felt safe\neven though I was on Gentile papers. But in February when they\noccupied the country, again, we were ina dire situation that you\nhad to start running again, and where do you go. There was very\nlittle you could do. You were in Hungary, you were closed in.",
        "I wasn't free because first of all I didn't know the\nlanguage. So, you're always on the run. So, from Hungary my\nnext bet was to run away from Hungary and the thought came to me\nmany times to reach Turkey. That was the only free country you\ncould possibly go, but to reach Turkey, you had to go to Rumania\nOr some other country, or to go to Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was a\nbad country because there waS a war going on between the\nYugoslavians and the Germans. So, it was a bad choice to go to\nYugoslavia. The only way is to go to Rumania. And to go to\nRumania you had to have connections. I didn't have the\nconnections but since I joined the underground they had the\nconnections. That's how I went to Rumania in the first place.",
        "Q. Yes, you had explained this in the video. I don't want to\ntake up too much time asking you again, but I guess the question\nwas more, even after the war, because of all the running you were\ndoing, did you feel as though part of your life you were still\nrunning?",
        "William Loew 40\nA. No, it wasn't that kind of feeling of running away from your\nlife per se. The only time, the reason that I was moving from\nplace to place here in the United States, it was on my own free\nwill, and I was already an engineer with my degree and I could\nimprove my status and to gain more experience, and this was the\nbeauty of this country, that you could do so much with your own\nabilities without asking for any permission from anyone else.\nThat's the beauty of it. There was no feeling that I'm running\naway, it was going to get some more experience and to see all the\nbeauty of the United States. That is the nice part of it.\nQO. You mentioned earlier that I think before we started\nrecording, that you thought your experience during the Holocaust\n-- I think you said this and maybe you explain it -- made you\nwant to be more successful. Somehow made you more aggressive in\nyour pursuit of your goal. Can you talk a little bit about how\nyour experience affected the decisions you made and the goals\nthat you set?\nA. Well, I felt that I met many survivors in my life time and\nevery survivor that I met was to me at least a special person. I\ndon't know that I could define a survivor but to me a survivor is\na person who's got a will to live. He's a special person because\nhe wants to live. But also, in order to live you have to live\nwell. You have to acquire certain skills to do that. I have met\nyet a survivor that isn't doing that well. All of them that I",
        "William Loew Al\nknew is fairly well. He's not a person who would be willing to\ngo on welfare. I know of that. He's a person who either\nacquires some education or some profession or goes into some kind\nof business. He's a person who's got a drive. Maybe he acquired\nthis during the days that he had to survive. I'm not saying this\nbecause of my own goals that I have set for myself, but I know a\nlot of survivors that they do have that kind of drive. They want\nto live well and they want to make up for the time that they have\nlost during the time when they were forced to lose the time. I\nknow that from myself. I want to live well, but I work hard for\nthat. It's good to work hard. You know, my family was ina\nhoney business in Poland. We used to have a brewery, a honey\nbrewery and we used to make honey wine. In fact the business\nthat my parents used to have, it wasn't only my parents but all\nmy uncles were in this kind of business because it came back for\ngenerations that we had established back in 1870s those\nbreweries. So, the business was since 1870 that generation after\ngeneration was going on and everyone was in this kind of\nbusiness. That was kind of inspiring to me. Although during the\ntime that I was in my engineering profession, it was kind of\nquestionable why am I in this kind of business in engineering\nrather than in the wine business. When I realized that to be in\na wine business it would take a tremendous effort on my part to\nget acquainted with that part of the business, first of all I",
        "William Loew 42\nwasn't prepared for it and second of all it was just a flashing\nthought on my part, to think about it. But I discarded that,\nbeing in that kind of business because first of all I was still\npretty much involved in my engineering profession and at that\ntime when that flashing thought came about I was in the\nadministration working on extradition problems that\nwe here had with the television products. Television products at\nthat time and for a number of years emitted some x-rays out of\nthe tubes and that was the time when in 1975 when I\ngained that position with the Food and Drug Administration to\nregulate the industry so that the manufactures of the television\nproduct would comply with our regulations. I did work for FDA a\nnumber of years since 1975 all the way through 1990 when I\nretired and in those times I worked not only for regulating the\ntelevision product but also working on medical devices working\nwith the manufacturers making sure that they complied again to\ntheir own standards and their own specifications on certain\nproducts that was offered to the market.\nIt was during that time that flashing point of going into\nthe kind of business that became more a reality to me because I\nalready started to make wine at home even before that time for\nour Own consumption. Mostly honey wine. The honey wine that I\nrecall, that certain taste that still haunts me over the years\nand to duplicate that wine from my parents and from the family",
        "William Loew 43\nJust in general since they'd been marketed back in Poland.\nApparently we used to export it to different countries, it was a\nspecial taste. A taste I'll never forget, although I try so many\ntimes to duplicate it, I just cannot duplicate that. There were\ncertain ingredients in that recipe that was never given to me,\nfor obvious reasons I never inquired for that. I was too small,\ntoo young to realize how important that is. It is now that I\nremember that I feel that it was so important because it was a\nwonderful time. Ever since that time since I started to make\nwine I tried to duplicate that and I say maybe next year I'll try\nto find it. I never found it yet.",
        "But I wanted to start somewhere and I wanted to begin some\nexperience in wine making in general. JI bought a piece of land\nin Frederick County back in 1982 and my wife Lois and myself and\nmy kids were planting year by year a new vintage, new vines and\nat this point in time since 1982 we have 5 1/2 acres of grapes\nthat combines not only grapes but French hybrid\ngrapes, two distinctive varieties that you make different wines\nwhich have different palates but equally good, could be good if\nmade right.",
        "All this time back in 1989 when I started to make some honey\nwine for the market, every year I would be producing a different\nwine hoping to find my recipe of the family and some\ndisappointment in it because I cannot duplicate it and I still",
        "William Loew 44\nexperiment but any wine that I make, the honey wine that is,\npeople like it and it's being sold on the market. I still hope\nthat I will find that recipe.\nQO. I want to ask you when you first met your wife Lois -- she's\nAmerican?\nA. She is.\nQO. When did you tell her your experience in the Holocaust and\nwhen you did what did you tell her?\nA. Well, Lois she knew that I'm from Europe. I told her so.\nBesides my accent she didn't ask a lot of questions about my past\nbecause she felt if I wanted to talk about my experiences I will\nand if I wouldn't want to talk obviously there was a reason I\nwouldn't want to talk. So, she wasn't pressing on that point.\nShe's good about it. She only presses on certain questions if\nshe misunderstood me, then I would try to explain it. Yes, I\ntold her about some of my experiences. In fact, I make a point\nwhenever a certain flashing event comes to my mind I would tell\nher right away, something flashed in my mind and I want to share\nthis with you, and I would tell her that. At that point, if\nshe's more inguisitive of that event, I would probably explain it\nor we would just end it at that point.",
        "As I mentioned before I don't live in the past so I'm not\ntaken by that. I live by the present and I live for the future\nand I'm basically programmed to that. I don't have any guilt",
        "William Loew 45\nfeelings and if I do I just bury it. There's no reason to go on\nwith that.\nQO. Guilt feelings?\nA. Guilt feelings that I'm the only one who survived and\nsometimes that is very difficult to justify. Sure, there is some\nguilt feelings. My brother Eli could have survived too if he\nwould have been as lucky as I was. I tried to rescue him, went\nto ghetto, tried to get him out. I was too late. But it would\nbe nice if someone of my family would have survived with me, but\nthat's the fate. That's the way we keep on going.\nQ. Were there periods before you were married and after the war\nwhere it was lonely because you didn't have any family?\nA. Of course, that's obvious that you don't have any family\nyou're on your own and that's something that any person who is by\nhimself he tries to seek a new family. It's something that in\norder to continue with your life, continue with your tradition,\nit's something that you need to take some steps. I married a\nwonderful woman, who gave me wonderful children and\ngrandchildren. We have a family and what I lost before I have\nregained and we have a future. The family is a wonderful family\nand they basically live in the tradition of my past family.",
        "Now, I want to touch base a little bit about the vineyard\nthat I have established with my wife back in 1982 that I felt\nback in 1982 when I purchased that piece of land I wanted to make",
        "William Loew 46\nsure that this is my place where I wanted to experiment in wine\nmaking in a place where I could retire. That was on my mind,\nthat was goal, and that's what I started. After -- here we are\nin 1995. I retired back in 1990 and in that year we broke the\nground and built a house here at the vineyard. It's a beautiful\nhouse, spacious, overlooking the vineyard. The point that I'm\nmaking 1s that whatever the goals you have set for yourself,\nthings are achievable. You can do it if you're persistent. You\ncan do it if you work hard. You can do it if you have support\nfrom your family, which I do, and my wife is wonderful in that\narea. Kids, my children are also supportive in many ways.\nThey're proud of what we do, what we have, what a tradition is,\nwhat we anticipate to do. Anything in a project that we make\nthey're very supportive.\nQO. How much -- it's a hard question I think to answer but how\nmuch of that persistence that you have, that optimism that you\nhave do you think was there when you were born and how much did\nthe experience during the Holocaust affect how you contribute to\nthat desire to succeed and achieve goals?\nA. Frankly, I don't think that the Holocaust was the prime\nmotivator to my goals. I'm aman who sets the goals and tries to\nachieve them. The only thing that would be a certain motivation\nto set my goals would be my upbringing, my family. Back in\nFurope where I was always proud of them, we were always hard",
        "William Loew 47\nworking people. Not that I knew at that time what a goal is, but\nI saw things around, being surrounded with the every day task\nthat stood before us. My brother, the oldest brother Abe, he was\na physiologist and he gained his master's degree in Warsaw. I\nrecall that he wasn't prodded at all by my mother to gain his\nprofession. He was willing to do it by himself. We had to\nSupport him because he was away from Lamberg, many miles away\nfrom us, so we had to support him. That is, my mother used to\nSupport him. My father died when I was four years old. So, he\ndied, so I knew him very little, but he was the one who actually\nestablished the winery. So, were his brothers, my uncles, they\nall had wineries. Either they had wineries or they worked for\none of our uncles. So, it was a family enterprise, as I\nmentioned before since 18/70.",
        "As I said before I don't think the Holocaust did anything to\nmy character. My character apparently was already established\nway back and the only thing that I had to do is to persist that I\nstay alive.",
        "QO. What influence do you think it ultimately had or that period",
        "in your life when you were between 15 and 20, how did it",
        "influence you?",
        "A. Well, sheer stubbornness that my life was all of a sudden",
        "interrupted and interrupted in a vicious way. Taken away from my",
        "being all the things that I loved. Now, you could imagine that a",
        "William Loew 48\nyoung boy who is trying to remember all those good things from\nhome all of a sudden doesn't have anything and I wasn't about to\nlet go. I persisted that I do whatever I had to do what my\nparents would expect me to do.",
        "So, Holocaust was a crucial terrible time that what it did\nto my family and to me, but it couldn't break me, and wouldn't\nbreak me as long as I lived.",
        "QO. Do you think it made you more optimistic or less optimistic\nabout life other than your optimism because you seemed\noptimistic, hopeful.\nA. Well, I was always hopeful with one exception of the time in\nFlosenberg where President Roosevelt died, so I -- the only thing\nthat comes to my mind was a sheer stubbornness. I wasn't about\nto give up on things that were against my will. Very important\npart of your character because those people who were not stubborn\nenough gave up their life. And it doesn't take too much for\nanyone in those situations that I was in to give up their life.\nIt was easy. It's to fight against terrible elements without\nhaving hope. It's easy to succumb to those pressures. I was\nstubborn. And it is a good situation and it was worth it every\nbit of it.\nQ. Now you were talking about how the Holocaust experience made\nyou more stubborn. Do you think it made you more aggressive\ntowards the pursuit of your goals?",
        "William Loew 49\nA. I don't know about that. I feel that to claim that the\nHolocaust made me more stubborn in a certain way, I don't know.\nI feel that it's more a character of a person that becomes\nmotivated in certain way. My motivation was to achieve certain\ngoals in my life. You could probably project yourself, which\ndirection you want to live, in what way. In my case, it was a\nmatter of first getting an education after what I have lost and\nlive the kind of life I would be comfortable with and second it\nseems to me that once you have achieved that goal, you cannot\nproject yourself too much far ahead. You have to accept things\nas they come and make changes and be willing to make changes if\nit's necessary. In my case, I did make some changes in my life\nespecially not continue to be in the engineering profession but\nsomething to pick up the roots of my family, namely wine making,\nand have fun. This is what we have it now and I feel very\ncomfortable with it. As long as I can do it, I will do it. And\nif I cannot make it anymore I cannot do it because my age or my\nphysical needs will require me to do something else, I don't\nknow. I cannot project it at this point in time.\nQO. You had mentioned the problem with your feet because of the\nfrost bite when you were being transported. Can you talk a\nlittle bit about that?\nA. Well it was a passing episode because the frost bite that I\ngot on my feet it was unfortunate at that time because I had to",
        "William Loew 50\nbe strong enough to walk and I couldn't fake too well, by walking\nstraight when I couldn't. I happen to have shoes at that time\nand the blisters that I got on my feet they wouldn't fit in my\nshoes and that was very painful. But ever since that time,\neverything got healed and there were no distortions on my\ntoenails or anything else. It was just one of those things that\nit persisted. Since my evacuation from Auschwitz all the way\nthrough to Flosenberg, it seems to me it healed in Flosenberg so\nI was okay afterwards.\nWhen I left on that trip from Flosenberg I have not limped.",
        "It appears to me that I was okay at that time so evidently I got\nhealed because I was strong enough to walk.\nQ. Do you have any problems now these days?\nA. No, no, I'm fine.\nQO. Physically?\nA. Physically I'm very strong. Physically I'm very healthy and\nI make sure that I maintain my body in a healthy way.\nQO. I wanted to ask you one other thing about what you said ina\nvideo interview that sometimes when you hear a knock you'll jump\na little bit these days still. Can you talk about that?\nA. Yes, this 1S something that one of the remnants that I have\nfrom the Holocaust especially when I used to live in Budapest. I\nused to live different places in Budapest and especially at night\nthe only thing that was dreadful after the German occupation that",
        "William Loew 51\nsome of my friends or acquaintances in Budapest were kind of\ndisappearing one by one for no reason. Later on I found out that\nthey were already imprisoned, some were. At that time\n, which is a political prison where I actually wound\nup when they caught me on Rumanian border, that was the place\nwhere some of my friends were and I couldn't find them then, but\nliving in different apartments in Budapest it was the night that\nwas so dreadful because you heard this knocking at the door. And\nthat's the time when any knock would scare me because that was\nthe time I would think they came to pick me up. Ever since that\ntime, that kind of persists and today someone knocks at the door\nI have a heartbeat much louder than I would want to have it.\nBut we have now a doorbell. It sounds much softer.",
        "QO. One other thing that I picked up from your video interview\nwas during the time that you were on the run, you had to trust a\nlot of people. You had to have faith in them that they wouldn't\ninform or turn you in or betray you. Do you think that had any\neffect on your outlook afterwards, that you were more trusting or\nless trusting?\nA. The trust that you are talking about is being so called free\nand that was everything took place in Budapest. This was the\nonly place after I escaped from Poland the only place that I felt\nsemi-free and being a free man walking on the streets without any\narmbands, identified as a Jew, because basically I was a Gentile",
        "William Loew 52\non the false papers, and the freedom was basically a superficial\nfreedom. If you cannot identify yourself who you actually are,\nthat's no freedom. You're basically a fugitive and if you're a\nfugitive you have to confine yourself to someone or not to\nconfine yourself so living in those apartments in Hungary that I\ndid, I always had to tell them who I am that I am a Polish\nrefugee. In order to convince them that I am a good practicing\ncatholic I would go to them to church. That was to convince them\nthat I am in good standing with them, but I would never claim\nthat I am Jewish. So, there was no trust in that other than I\nhad to survive the way I had to survive. They don't have to know\nabout those things.",
        "It was experience. I could talk to you now because I'm\nfree, but there was no freedom at that time. I had to deny my\nown religion for something I hated to do that but life goes on\nand things have passed. I could talk about it now in a more\nleisurely way. Thank God for that.",
        "Q. I think I pretty much covered all the territory that I",
        "wanted. Is there anything you'd like to say that I haven't asked",
        "you about?",
        "A. I don't know what to add to my testimony more what I had.",
        "There were maybe some more incidents, more events that I haven't",
        "covered. Maybe there were some important things, I don't recall.\nThe only thing I could recall is a flashing point that I could",
        "William Loew 53\nrecall that one event triggers another event and obviously I may\nhave left many events because if you are talking about events\nSince the Holocaust back in 1941 when they took away my brother\nAbe and all the way through my life and living among those 40\nJews in , every day living with those people was\nan event by itself. Because these are horrible days, you live\nnot from day to day but from minute to minute. Everything\ndepends --\nEnd of Tape 3",
        "William Loew 54\nTape 4\nA. -- determination by some assessment in\nbecause we could be picked up at that time almost any time. So,\nthe life was horrible then. It would have been nice if some of\nthe people would have been survived, I don't know. I don't know\nif any of them --.",
        "There are many events that I could probably recall, under\nproper circumstances I could probably disclose them, but I don't\nknow it now. The life now is very good, wonderful. The family\nis wonderful. I'll leave it at that.",
        "Q. You don't seem to have any bitterness?\nA. No, no bitterness, maybe some sorrow, but this is the least\nI can endure. This is at least I could -- that doesn't have to\nmake me angry because anger doesn't solve anything. I am\nemotional and it comes at times especially at the times when the\nflashbacks come in but they go away as soon as they come in.\nQ. How often do you have those flashbacks?\nA. Quite often.\nQ. Every day?\nA. No, I don't count them. I don't know when they come, they\njust come. Not necessarily every day. Something has to trigger\nthat flashback it seems to me.",
        "William Loew 55\nQO. Do you know what it is that triggers it?\nA. No, I don't know. It's part of a life cycle I suppose.\nEveryone has some recollections of their childhood and that's\npart of the process I suppose. Some are very happy events. Some\nof these flashbacks are very happy, some are very bad. I don't\nknow which type of flashback I have. I never counted them. I\nnever tried to separate them. They come quite naturally and they\ngo away.\nQ. How long do they last normally?\nA. Just a flashback.\nQO. Just a moment?\nA. Yes. Just a flashback and the flashbacks actually could be\ninterpreted later on. I could interpret what that flashback is.",
        "I could probably ask myself what happened. It could be a very\nhappy event. And of course it could be a very sad event.\nProbably there are more happy events that surface to me than the\nbad events, which is good in a way because the happy events\nmostly tie in with the family.\nQ. What's a typical flashback? Do you have a recurring\nflashback from the Holocaust that you remember?\nA. No, I have just occasional flashbacks from the Holocaust.\nAs I said there are more happy events than bad events. Maybe for\nvery good obvious reasons, I don't know why. Maybe I want to\nremember those good events and they're happy or interesting and",
        "William Loew 56\nyou could stay with them a little bit longer.",
        "So, it's those flashbacks will remain with me, not that I\nplan on them but they come when they want to come.\nQ. And you're not sure of a particular thing that triggers\nthem?\nA. Right. I don't know how they come in nothing seems to\ntrigger that flashback. They come naturally. Apparently there's\na file in my head that opens up when it wants to open and it\ncloses when it wants to be closed. I'll have to ask my wife,\nwho's a psychologist how that works. It must work that way\nsomehow. It's something -- an intermittent event. Maybe that's\nthe way it works, intermittently.\nQ. I want to thank you very much for talking to me.\nA. Thank you very much for interviewing me. I appreciate that.\nConclusion of Interview",
