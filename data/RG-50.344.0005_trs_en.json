        "Question: Okay, this is July 15th, 1995. \u2019'm Nina Ellis, speaking with Louise Birch, in\nWest Park, New York. Tell me please, when and where were you born?",
        "Answer: June 21st, 1921, Cleveland, Ohio.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And tell me something about your family and your background.",
        "A: Mother and father, father was a newspaper reporter in Cleveland, transferred to New\nYork City and became sports editor of the New York World Telegram. I have a brother.\nMy mother and father divorced and saw very little of him. And -- but my mother, I think\nwas loyal to him all the time. The one thing that I remember about him, when I wanted to\nbecome a nurse, he said to my mother, \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any damn maids in our\nfamily.\u201d",
        "Q: That\u2019s what he thought of nursing?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Well, in those days -- you\u2019re thinking -- talking 1939 -- is when I graduated\nfrom high school. So my mother said I could go to college and become a teacher. Well, I\ndidn\u2019t want to become a teacher, I wanted to become a nurse. So I stayed home for a whole\nyear and did absolutely nothing. And she finally said to me, \u201cGo, go,\u201d you know. \u201cT\u2019ll pay\nfor it,\u201d because in those days you had to pay for a nursing education. And it was Dad\u2019s\nresponsibility. So, anyhow, make a long story short, I became a nurse and he never\ncongratulated me or anything, until I got in the service. And he wrote me a letter that he\nwanted to come down and do an article on the nurses, the army nurses. And by the time I\nJuly 15, 1995\ngot the letter, we were all -- already overseas, living 1n tents. In fact it was [indecipherable]\nwho helped me compose a letter back to my father saying, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to do a story\non us. We don't look like nurses, we don\u2019t act like nurses. We\u2019re,\u201d you know, \u201cwe\u2019re living\nin tents and,\u201d you know, \u201cwalking in mud and not the sterile atmosphere that you think, the\nwhite, crisp nurses.\u201d So he dropped the subject. He never said boo to me a -- the rest of my\nlife -- or his life. And --",
        "Q: Where did you get the idea that you wanted to be a nurse and why was it such a strong\nmotivation?",
        "A: Well, actually, it goes back to -- I was five and a half years old, had a real bad operation\nand I al-almost died, evidently. It was rare in that time -- and I won\u2019t go into it, because,\nwell -- but anyhow, two holes in my belly here. And I can alway -- and I had specials\naround the clock and I can always remember, you know, begging my -- my nurses to, \u201cOh,\nI'd give you a drink if you were thirsty,\u201d you know, and -- cause I couldn\u2019t have any water,\nanything to drink and stuff. And that must have been what was instilled in me.",
        "Q: You remembered that?",
        "A: Cause I had no idea what nursing was like when I went into training. In fact, my mother,\nwhen she finally said go, she said, \u201cI give you a couple of months and you\u2019ll be back.\u201d And\nI said, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t, I'll stick it out.\u201d And I did.",
        "Q: Well, where did you get the idea that you wanted to go in the service?",
        "A: Well, that -- that\u2019s almost another s -- chapter in my life. I had my boyfriend through\nhigh school was -- had gone in the service before he was drafted, so -- and he and --\nJuly 15, 1995\nvolunteered for the airborne. He was in the 82nd Airborne Division. And in training we\nweren\u2019t allowed to be married. And we had been really romantic and he knew he was going\noverseas and so he got leave and I sneaked out and we got married. Well, his -- his family\nknew about it and my family knew about it. It was a real simple ceremony and we just had a\nweekend pass. And that was the last I saw of him. He went o -- he was in the invasion of\nSicily and he was mi -- th-that\u2019s a thorn in my side, he was considered an MIA for a year.\nThen he -- they you\u2019re dead. Not like the MIA\u2019s today that they\u2019re still -- you know, I know\nthat they have to look for these people, but they didn\u2019t look for the boys in the World War\nTwo. And there were many of them that they never found. And unless there\u2019s blue eyed\nblondes running around Sicily, then I don\u2019t know where he 1s. And -- so I went trying to\nfind some trace of him. I\u2019d written to his chaplain and I\u2019d written to a lieutenant that used to\ncensor our letters and never got any response. Went to the Red Cross, never got any\nresponse. So, I finally found -- when I was in the service, and I was stationed down Atlantic\nCity in what they called England General Hospital -- it was one of the big hotels in\nAtlantic City at the time, they made a hospital. And I found a -- a fellow that was in his\ncompany. And so he invited me over to his apartment with his wife and we got talking and\nhe knew that my -- my Hughie had jumped, and he -- cause I wondered, you know, did he\neven make it over there? And he said, \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that was a\u201d -- I guess that whole\noperation was a faux pas, you know. They went off of target and whatever. So anyhow, at\nleast I knew that he did his duty, [indecipherable]",
        "Q: What was his name?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Hugh Sheridan. And that\u2019s why they call me Sherry. My maiden name was Williams.\nSo at least I found that out.",
        "Q: When did you find that out?",
        "A: Well, actually it was a year that they -- well no, 1t wasn\u2019t a year, because they had listed\nhim as missing in action and his pap -- picture was in the paper and a | -- his -- his family\nhad given this little blurb that -- you know, he\u2019d just gotten married, etcetera. And I knew\nmy directress of nurses would see this paper, cause it was a local paper. By this time I\u2019m out\nof school, but I felt so bad, cause I had lied to her, you know, to get this little pass that I had.\nSo I went back to her and, you know, in a teary eyed, nice, you know, \u201cMiss Copeland, I\nwant to talk to you and --\u201d so I started to say something, she said, \u201cI know.\u201d She said, \u201cI\nknow you got married.\u201d And I looked at her and -- but she didn\u2019t know, you know, that he\nhad been missing. So she was sorry about that. But it was okay and I guess she probably felt\ngood that I came back to confess my crime or so. But -- you see, we were Catholic and --\nand the banns had to be announced in the church and they were announced in his church,\nwhere -- where she went.",
        "Q: Oh, so she knew.",
        "A: And she picked up the n -- the names and she must have even known who was writing to\nme, I don\u2019t know. Cause they knew everything. So that\u2019s --",
        "Q: So he was lost in --",
        "A: Sicily.",
        "Q: June *44?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Actually, July.",
        "Q: July.",
        "A: July \u201843.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And I got out of school. I finished school probably September \u201843. And by the time you\ntook state boards and, you know, to get your RN, cause you couldn\u2019t join the service until\nyou got your state boards and had physical, papers, it was \u201844. It was early \u201844 that I went in\nthe service.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And was stationed down Atlantic City for awhile. And then got my orders to go to\nCamp Polk where the 131st was being started.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. The full name of your unit was what?",
        "A: 131st evacuation hospital, semi-mobile. In other words, you could pick up half of that\nhospital and move it on, while the other half was still operating, although we never did that,\nbut it was equipped to do that. You could even take down half of the operating room, which\nwas a huge, big tent. Look -- it was several tents put together. Looked like a big circus tent,\nalmost. And you could take down half of that and move it on and move half of the wards on.\nAnd we had two teams, you know, nurses and doctors and stuff. But we never did that. We -\n- we all -- when we set up -- set up as a whole and moved the whole unit as a whole, so --",
        "Q: So it -- it\u2019s -- it was like what -- what we might know today as a -- a MASH unit?",
        "A: Mm.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "Q: A mobile hospital?",
        "A: Yeah, mo-mobile army surgical hospital. And I imagine today that that\u2019s what they call\nit. | don\u2019t think they call it evacuation hospitals any more. The patients that we had stayed\nmaybe -- maybe two nights at the most and then they were either taken by ambulance or air\nevac-ed out.",
        "Q: So this was 1944 they were forming this unit at Fort --",
        "A: Polk.",
        "Q: Where was that, what state?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m wrong. Fort Jackson.",
        "Q: Fort Jackson.",
        "A: Fort Jackson, South Carolina.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. 1944.",
        "A: Yeah. Fort Polk is where we got just -- and broke up, yeah.",
        "Q: And you stayed in South Carolina until when, do you remember?",
        "A: Well, it -- we headed up north in December, early December and by this time we knew\nthat we were heading someplace. We had gotten a leave to go home and it was a short leave,\nprobably 10 days and then we would up at -- and I don\u2019t remember whether it was Camp\nKilmer, someplace in New Jersey. And we did a lot of training, as far as marching with\npacks on our backs and --",
        "Q: What el -- what other kind of training?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Well, well I think we did that down in Fort Jackson, we dug fli -- trenches. We put up\ntents and we hiked and I was -- I think I told you about the gas chamber that we went\nthrough. And then we --",
        "Q: Tell me about that again, on tape.",
        "A: Well, it was this -- almost about the -- the length of a barrack, maybe shorter, but there\nwas nothing in it but tear gas.",
        "Q: Underground, or it was --",
        "A: No, no up -- up above. It was all sealed, full of tear gas and there was a sergeant or some\nGI sitting at the end with a pad of paper and a pencil and a desk and you went into the far\nend and walked through this whole chamber of gas, with a gas mask on. You always had to\nhave your gas mask on and you had to put it on properly, too. Cause if it wasn\u2019t properly fit\nthen you got the gas. When you reached this officer -- enlisted man, whatever he was, took\noff your gas mask and told him your name, rank and your serial number. And if you got\nnervous and flubbed -- cause he must have had it right down there what your s-serial\nnumber was, if you missed a number, he\u2019d say, \u201cRepeat that.\u201d You know, and -- but it was\none way to teach us all our serial number, because that was very important. And then you --\nyou got out into the fresh air and then --",
        "Q: Oh, where he was sitting -- he had a gas mask on?",
        "A: Oh, he had it on too.",
        "Q: Oh, was a gas --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh yeah, he wa -- he was sitting in there with his mask on, but you would take yours off.\nAnd he was just delighting in every, you know, especially with a bunch of females you\nknow and we were all screaming. And -- I imagine -- I know the men had to go through this\ntoo, probably even harder. And --",
        "Q: And -- and you had to dig trenches and --",
        "A: We -- we dug a slit tr -- well, what they call a slit trench, which would just hold a -- a\nbody, you know, in case you got bombed, you could jump into it. And we put our pup tents\nup. And those were small tents, they were like two men tents. And as I remember, each one\nof us carried a half a tent at all times. So if you were ever caught someplace with no shelter,\nyou could double up and -- and -- and put some s -- kind of a shelter up. All those things I\nthink are in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, cause when we came back, stuff was going\nover the side.",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, you didn\u2019t want to -- hey, you didn\u2019t want to carry this home. Hopefully you\nwouldn\u2019t need it again, but --",
        "Q: Did they teach you how to use a weapon?",
        "A: No, no --",
        "Q: Never?",
        "A: No, never --",
        "Q: Never had to use it?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: No, no. We were given all sorts of films on disease, body lice, sanitary conditions, and I\ndon\u2019t even think there was a film for us on weapons. And there were no weapons in our\nhospital, although I do have a picture of our dental assistant and he\u2019s got a bandoleer of, you\nknow, shells on him. I don\u2019t know where he got it. But --",
        "Q: And did they -- did you have special training in how to treat combat wounds?",
        "A: Well, that was -- in the army you do everything, as they say, by the AR\u2019s -- Army\nregulations. There was only one way to dress a wound and you did it that way. You might\nnot like to do it that way, but the army wanted you to do it that way, so yes, we had -- had\nall these army regulations on how to treat this and that. And going over on the ship, I was\nassigned to -- to be an orthopedic surgical nurse. And I met the orthopedic surgeon and he\ngave me a whole list of what we would do for all these orthopedic -- amputations or\nwhatever, you know. And you read them and okay, we\u2019ll do what we have to do.",
        "Q: Were they substantially different from the way you had learned in nursing school?",
        "A: No, no, but -- no, not really, you know, the -- you -- you still had a surgical technique\nthat you had to follow. But they had a particular way of doing things and the army is a\nstickler for that. Y-Y -- In the hospital you might have several different sizes of bandages,\nyou know. In the army, you have one or two sizes. I do -- it may be different now, but 1-in\nwartime it wasn\u2019t anyhow.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: While we were in England, I saw returning casualties from the Battle of the Bulge. For\nbandages they used the latest issue of \u201cStars and Stripes\u2019, which was the magazine. They\nJuly 15, 1995\nhad no bandages. And we\u2019d get them in the operating room and we\u2019d have to wet down this\nleg that was -- had all this paper -- newspaper stuck to it. Cause that\u2019s the only thing they\nhad. Cause that was a different situation. So you can\u2019t say that they went by army\nregulations. You do what you have to do.",
        "Q: Mm. Mm. Let\u2019s pick up our chronology. You had to leave in December, you went home.",
        "A: We went home for a short leave and I can remember my mother gave me a Hagen\nHague bottle of Scotch, pinch bottle and I hate Scotch. And so we got back to base --",
        "Q: Why did she give you Scotch?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. She -- it wa -- evidently this was a very -- and 1s -- I don\u2019t know, cause I\u2019m\nnot a Scotch -- it\u2019s a very good brand of Scotch. And she said, \u201cTake this back, you know,\nthey might want to have a little party or something.\u201d And when we got back to camp, the\ndoor came down and you could not make a phone call, you could not write a letter, you\ncould not have any visitors. It was -- and I\u2019m trying to think of the name they used. I want to\nsay black out, but it wasn\u2019t -- was the censo-censorship. So my mother never heard from me\nand she\u2019s saying, \u201cOh, Louise got caught with that bottle of -- 1n her --\u201d She said they put\nher on -- you know, put her in the brig or something, cause I got -- and I went in -- I can\nremember going in to the little commissary there and they had a fl -- a florist in there that\nyou -- they could wire flowers out. Pll fix -- Pll get in touch with my mother. So I wired her\na dozen red roses. Course she got them a month later, but I thought they would go right out,\nyou know. But they were smart, you know, and just all I put on 1s, \u201cI love you\u201d, you know.\nAnd -- it didn\u2019t work.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "Q: And you -- and you shipped out",
        "A: And we shipped out, yeah. We were -- we were like that for maybe three or four days I\nthink, that you couldn\u2019t do anything. And -- and the other girls must have told you the story\nabout crossing the Hudson at night and this fog rising up and that\u2019s a vision I'll never\nforget.",
        "Q: Tell me about that.",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember exactly whether -- I know we had gone by train to this barge. Now it\nseemed to me the train was on the barge, but I could be wrong. But I remember crossing, it\nwas dark, night and crossing the river and this fog coming up. And there was this big gray\nthing in front of us. It was huge, huge, several stories high. And you\u2019re looking up at it and\nyou could just make out, Queen E-I-i and then you don\u2019t know what was in around -- and of\ncourse it was all painted gray. The Queen Elizabeth. And we were, \u201cMy God,\u201d you know.\nAnd I -- I get goose pimples right now. This is it. And we all had steel helmets on and they\nchalked mark -- you\u2019re all numbered. And we lined up and they had the -- the roster and you\nknow, one, two, three, four. And then you got to the gangplank and they checked the one,\ntwo, three, four and you got up on top of the gangplank and one, two, three, four and they\nshowed you which way to go. They had our quarters all -- the women were, of course all\nsegregated, cause there were thousands -- thousands on that ship. All the doors on the\nstateroom were removed, there were no doors on the stateroom. They had guards either into\nthe hall, so nobody could go -- nobody else could go and we only could eat twice a day,\nbecause there were so many on there to feed that I guess the ki-kitchen was going\nJuly 15, 1995\nconstantly. You -- you got your -- your seating thing, which was like 10 o\u2019clock in the\nmorning and maybe nine o\u2019clock at night. That\u2019s when you ate. Two meals. Cause they\ncouldn\u2019t feed everybody three meals.",
        "Q: Were you able to mingle with the men at all? Did you talk to them?",
        "A: Oh we -- yeah, we -- well just -- just the officers. Course it was very segregated. The\nhuge, huge, big lounge. You couldn\u2019t find a place to sit, everyone was sitting on the floor.\nThe few that got a chair were lucky you know, and they weren\u2019t about to give it up. And the\nofficers all mingled -- there were many air corps fellows going back to England. There\nwere many other units. I found out after the war that one of my friends, who I knew as a\nlittle kid, was on that same ship. And he was in -- in fact, he was in the 120th evac hospital.",
        "Q: Watch your microphone there.",
        "A: That liberated Buchenwald and I tried to tell -- tried to get him to talk to me, no. He\u2019s\nbusy right now, his wife had got cancer. But anyhow, yes and -- and while we were there,\nsome of the nurses from another unit put on a little skit. That\u2019s why I know it was the same\nboat that this friend of mine went on, because he was talking about the [indecipherable], I\ncan still see the girls up there singing, \u201cDon\u2019t Fence Me In.\u201d And they had big wings,\nsuppose -- supposed to be Air Corps wings on it, you know. And of course the Air Corps\nguys went ape over that. And so we had a good time and --",
        "Q: So there was another unit of nurses? Yours wasn\u2019t the only one?",
        "A: Oh, this was in Buchenwald they went to .",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: A -- a unit replaced us when we left. The 58th field hospital replaced us. And I have no\nidea, you know, what happened then. That\u2019s why I was disappointed -- well, maybe Mike\nwould know, when he comes back with Bonnie because I\u2019m sure his outfit stayed there.",
        "Q: So you got to England right after Christmas?",
        "A: Just before Christmas. Just before Christmas and we knew we were going to be away for\nChristmas, so all the nurses went into the PX and we all bought three gifts. Handkerchiefs\nor aftershave or a razor or something and wrapped it up for the enlisted men. And we had\nthat -- I think we bought an ornament, too. It seems to me we -- but we carried those. So\nwhen we got to England and course holly grows wild over there, so we had a ball cutting it\noff and trying to make our quarters a little bit more cheerful. And Christmas night we took\nall these -- grab gifts you\u2019d call them, but we thought it was something -- up to the enlisted\nmen\u2019s quarters and we all -- we\u2019re great singing group, not that I have a voice. I\u2019m losing\nwhat I have. But we sang all the time and I am sure the men got so sick of hearing us sing.\nAnd Ecky was one of the ringleaders, cause she ca -- has a voice. You know, all kinds of\nsongs. And we sang Christmas carols for the -- the enlisted men and gave them a little\npresent, so that made it a little nicer.",
        "Q: You all -- seems like you saw it as your responsibility to care for the men as well as the\ninjured.",
        "A: Well -- well it was -- it was hard, this segregation thing, you know. And -- and I -- you\nknow, the -- the men thought of -- of the nurses as -- for the en -- for the officers only. We\nweren\u2019t supposed to fraternize with them. And how can you do that with somebody you\u2019re\nJuly 15, 1995\nworking with? I mean yo-you -- you had a little law and order, let\u2019s say, on the wards and\nstuff, but you still were friendly. Like one night at Christmas time, we had this house that\nwe turned into a sick bay, so anybody in the outfit, whether they were officer or enlisted\nmen was sick and needed care and stuff, were sent there. So, of course the nurses had to\nman it and one night we\u2019re sitting there and one of the GIs, the enlisted man who was taking\ncare of the fires -- each hou -- in England, each house -- room, has a little fireplace and\nGod, if you don\u2019t keep that going, you freeze to death. And he\u2019d go around -- and so we\u2019re\nsitting there and we\u2019re talking about Christmas back home and we\u2019re sad, you know. And\nthis guy says to me, \u201cBoy,\u201d he says, \u201cthere no -- no place like Christmas in the\nAdirondacks.\u201d Which is, you know, right up here. And I grew up in the Adirondacks,\nsummertime. And I said, \u201c\u201cWhereabouts in the Adirondacks?\u201d He says, \u201cSpeculator.\u201d And\nno one has ever heard of Speculator. Well, that\u2019s where I grew up. I -- off the bench\n[indecipherable] and I jumped in his lap and I\u2019m kissing him and going on. And the poor\nkid, he\u2019s scared to death, you know, what did I do wrong, you know, I\u2019m going to be court-\nmartialed. But I was so -- someone has heard of Spec. And then he said to me, \u201cYou know, I\nrecognized you, but I didn\u2019t recognize your name.\u201d And that\u2019s because I had my married\nname.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: But that was, you know, it --",
        "Q: You all were homesick, huh?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, we just -- especially at Christmastime. And this boy happened to be\nJewish too, so that really didn\u2019t mean as much to him, but the fact that he was even near any\narea. You know, when you -- when you meet a soldier, \u201cWhere you from?\u201d Everyone know\nwa -- where you from. Most -- the Amer -- majority of our enlisted men were from\nOklahoma. A bunch of Okies. A few, like Mark, happened to be from New York, and we\nhad a few from Pennsylvania. Us girls -- most of us girls were from New York,\nPennsylvania and New Jersey. Our officers -- our doctors were mostly from Ohio,\nPennsylvania. And you know, so there were little areas. So you were always looking for\nsomeone who knew your hometown so you would have something to talk about and would\nremind you of home. And I -- and -- and -- you know, the -- especially the -- the fighting\nsoldiers, you know they were so glad to see somebody. First -- first you know, it was an\nAmerican voice that they want, oh, were so glad to see and then the American woman and\nthen, you know, where are you from? Where are you from? And if you were even two states\naway, you know, you were their sister. So --",
        "Q: What was it like caring for the men who had been injured coming back from -- they --\nthey were in the Battle of the Bulge, some of them?",
        "A: At that point, see, it was right at Christma -- I was in the operating room, so I really\ndidn\u2019t care for them. I saw them and saw their wounds and that\u2019s all I -- because they were\nin and out and -- and we had two tables going at the same time, 1n one room. And --",
        "Q: These were people who were pretty badly injured?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Well yeah, they had all sorts of inj -- in -- in the room I was in, 1t was an orthopedic\nroom, so it was either real brad -- bad fractures, some amputations, something like that. But\nthere were other rooms that had chest wounds and you know, abdominal. So they were, in a\nway, worse off, because it\u2019s a little easier to fix a bone than it 1s to fix a -- a shatter --",
        "Q: Soft tissue, yeah.",
        "A: You know, lung and stuff. So I really -- in fact I had to relieve one day in the -- 1n the\nchest surgery room and I oh, get me out of here. You know, I was scared. I gi -- bega -- I\nnever saw so much blood in my life and -- you know, and they work so fast, whereas\northopedic is, you know, you aw-aw.",
        "Q: It\u2019s slower?",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s slower, because you know, most of the bleeding had already been under\ncontrol because it hadn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t just happen. But, you know, they were repairing\nwhat they could and even -- even that they would probably have to have more surgery when\nthey got back to the States, cause there were nerve damages done, which the -- I don\u2019t think\nthey would attempt to do there. But -- it\u2019s an awful thing to say, but it was good to take care\nof our -- our soldiers. And --",
        "Q: What do you mean by that? I mean --",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what we were there for. And -- and when I was stationed in Atlantic City,\nthese soldiers were -- were all injured ones, but they were up and about on crutches and in\nwheelchairs and you know, slings and whatnot. So they were sick, yes, but they weren\u2019t sick\nthat way. Had a couple of real bad head injuries that upset me because they couldn\u2019t talk\nJuly 15, 1995\nand -- but they weren\u2019t fresh wounds and -- and in England was the first time I saw a fresh\nwound. And then in France we sat up -- set up the hospital in Fran-France, but we didn\u2019t\nhave any patients. It was like a dry run, cause that\u2019s the first time we had set up the tents.\nWe had to make sure all of our equipment worked. Trying out generators and dis -- water\ndistillers and autoclaves and -- and our -- all of our instruments were shipped over covered\nwith some sort of a grease or Vaseline or something. We had to clean all that off -- it was to\nprotect it, you know, from the salt water, I guess, whatever. And we cleaned the instruments\nand even made little -- some of the girls made soap -- hand soap, little -- little compartments\nfor some of the more delicate instruments, the -- you know, to protect them. And then we\nwent on to Germany, that was the first time we had -- had fresh patients.",
        "Q: In April?",
        "A: April, yeah. April, yeah.",
        "Q: April 1945?",
        "A: \u201845, yeah.",
        "Q: And these were coming off the battlefield?",
        "A: Yeah. Or one -- our -- our very first load of patients was a -- a truck accident, the truck\nhad tipped over and a whole bunch were injured in that. In fact, we even had some German\nPOWs that had gotten injured and we treated those. But then there were -- the war was\nstarting to wane down, so the one -- that furious amount of accidents where a lot of mine --\nyou know, people walking into personnel mines and stuff like that. I remember -- and I can\u2019t\nremember wh-what happened to wa -- one night in the operating room, was this kid with\nJuly 15, 1995\nthis head wound and we had just set up the distilled water and it was -- the doctor yelled at\nme to get a pitcher of water and pour it out -- you know, to debride it, to get the dirt out.\nAnd I said, \u201cNo, the water\u2019s too hot.\u201d And he says, \u201cPour it.\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s too hot.\u201d He says,\n\u201cPour it, God damn it, pour it.\u201d And when I did I could see the kids toes jumping and oh, I -\n- I felt terrible. And he came later and --",
        "Q: His toes moved?",
        "A: Well, yeah. Because the -- of the nerve reflex",
        "Q: Nerve --",
        "A: -- you know. And I felt terrible, I felt so bad. And he came to me later and apologized, he\nsays, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I shouldn\u2019t have questioned you.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have felt that.\u201d He said, \u201cThe damage that was in his brain,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cbut I had to\u201d -- you know. So that was one incident I remember.",
        "Q: What -- was it a generally tense situation? I mean I don\u2019t know about what the normal\nstate of an operating room is, but how 1s it different in that -- in a -- in a -- in a -- you know,\nbehind the lines?",
        "A: Yeah, well I think any operating room situation, even if you watch MASH, is tense\nwhile they\u2019re doing the operation. Once it\u2019s over, and it\u2019s -- I know on civilian -- cause I\nworked in civilian hospitals in the operating room -- once it\u2019s over, the laughter starts and\nthey ask how your golf game is or they\u2019Il start, hey did you hear this joke, you know. It\u2019s\nvery blas\u00e9. And I think there, too. Although they did things a lot faster. They had to move,\nkeep moving.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "Q: Because there was always another --",
        "A: There\u2019s another one waiting, yeah. We always had what we call a pre-op tent that came\nout this way and then the big operating room tent was this way and the pre-ops were in there\non the stretchers and --",
        "Q: Waiting.",
        "A: -- waiting.",
        "Q: So it was a constant emergency surgery?",
        "A: Yeah -- next, yeah -- next.",
        "Q: Constant.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Some of it wasn\u2019t considered emergency, but it had -- it wasn\u2019t life or death -- some of\nthem weren\u2019t life or death, but they still needed attention and you took the first ones first,\nthat\u2019s triage. But --",
        "Q: Who would do those assessments, the triage assessments, a doctor in that area?",
        "A: Ah, well yeah, and -- and -- and the nurse -- like Woody, she was head of the OR that I\nworked in. I don\u2019t know, cause I was in the operating room. Actually, I don\u2019t remember\nthose in the -- I know we had a sergeant who was in charge of the ward itself and he was an\nolder man, so whether he was -- you know, some -- the corpsman, God bless them, was a lot\nbetter than some of the nurses. They were great, really great.",
        "Q: How many -- on a typical day, how many surgeries would you do?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh, that would be hard to tell because we moved so much. We moved an awful lot. He\njust couldn\u2019t keep up with -- the third army was moving through. And we weren\u2019t that busy.\nI can -- wards were never full, whether they shipped them back out faster -- like I said, the\nwar was waning down and they could get them moved out further -- they wanted to get\nthem to general hospitals as soon as they could. And then back home. So they -- we were\nnever out straight, I wouldn\u2019t say. In England yes. England was different. England was\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: What do you mean by out straight?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: Working around the clock --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. One right after the other and at night time, you might be called out at\nnight. But, you know --",
        "Q: That would happen? At night --",
        "A: Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah",
        "Q: -- you were on call, virtually every day, all the time?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, there was always this two team units or one --\nsomebody was always there to work the hospital, if some of us got to go to a -- a so-called\nparty, you know, as long as there was enough left to cover the hospital, that was okay. You\nknow, you could get leave to go. So --",
        "Q: So half of you were always on and half of you were always off?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh, actually -- yes, I suppose you\u2019d call it that. I was going to say we were always all on\nunless there was something doing, which wasn\u2019t that often. It sounds like we were just one\nbig party, but it certainly wasn\u2019t. And -- and we made -- made our own parties a lot of times.\nJust for something to do, something different.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I think that\u2019s probably why we got along so well together, because you could always\nthink of something else to do.",
        "Q: What do you mean?",
        "A: Well, if you had to, you know, you -- y-you sit in the tent and you might write letters or\nread books and somebody would come in and make a lot of noise and you\u2019d say, \u201cOh well,\nquiet down.\u201d And, you know, they realize, \u201cWell, maybe I should go out for a walk,\u201d and\nthen you\u2019d go out for a walk. And you couldn\u2019t walk far, cause you weren\u2019t allowed to go\ntoo far. So, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s funny, thinking back of -- we didn\u2019t take it lightly, but\nwe didn\u2019t let it get underneath, you know, let us get down. We -- we had a job to do, we\nwere there to do it.",
        "Q: Let me check this. While you were in Germany, in April, was your general attitude --\nwhat was your general attitude? Were you feeling, \u201cI\u2019m glad to be here. I feel good doing\nthis.\u201d Or was it, \u201cThis is terrible, I want to go home.\u201d",
        "A: Well, I always wanted to go home. I know that when I was in Germany, I hated the\nGermans with a passion. Just hated them with a passion. And I -- I couldn\u2019t even be civil to\nthem when I would look at them. I\u2019ve changed since, believe me. Cause I\u2019ve been back and\nJuly 15, 1995\nfound the [indecipherable] people. But it was -- we were almost like cattle being led.\nYou\u2019re -- you\u2019re in the service, you\u2019re told when to get up and go to bed and when to eat\nand you didn\u2019t question what you were eating, you ate it. You went to work and you did\nyour job. And why am I here? Because I joined. I wasn\u2019t drafted, I joined. This is what I\nwant to do. I never thought of coming home as a -- it seemed to me that everybody in that\nera joined the service. So, it was the thing to do. You had to do it for your country. And we\nweren\u2019t doing it maybe we weren\u2019t doing it for the country per se, we were doing it for our\nmen, our fellow men. Fellow Americans. And that\u2019s what we wanted to do, that\u2019s why we\nwere all there, to help them over, cause they\u2019re the ones that did the dirty work.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And we\u2019d tried to make it a little nicer, a little softer or healthier.",
        "Q: Did you think about your husband?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, I did, yeah. Wondered, you know? He used to have a -- on his dogtags he had\na little vial with my hair in it and he had said to me the last I saw him, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t ever\nbelieve I\u2019m dead unless you get this back.\u201d And course, I\u2019ve never gotten it back. But there\nwere -- I\u2019ve heard so many stories since, how -- must have been an awful job for these -- I\ndon\u2019t know what they call them, they had a name -- that buried the dead. And this\nespecially, in the Battle of Normandy, I heard this from one of the GIs, the -- the -- the --\nthe invasion of Normandy was so horrendous, that they had a truck of left arms and a truck\nof right arms and a truck of left legs and when they went to bury a body, if it was missing a\nleft leg, they went to that truck. So, you wonder. And even when I was in high school, my\nJuly 15, 1995\nchemistry teacher in high school was a doctor, a female doctor and she was a doctor in\nWorld War One. And she had all these slides to show us. They were slides of heart tissue\nand lung tissue and all sorts of tissues that she had taken out of World War One dead\nsoldiers. And she told us then -- and here we are, that\u2019s way back in the young -- late --\nearly 30\u2019s, that they stuffed them with straw and sent them home to be buried. So you\nwonder, you know, what came home. Maybe he\u2019s better over there, not knowing, you know.\nBlown to bits or something, I don\u2019t know. But that stuck and I -- I -- I can always remem -- I\ncan remember we had these seats in -- in hi -- in -- in -- in our chemistry lab that were two to\na desk, and I w -- I -- listening like this and all of a sudden I hear bump and the girl next to\nme fainted right out on -- of her seat. But I don\u2019t know if they could do that now. Maybe\nthey do, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know. So you were caring for e -- wounded soldiers and grieving at the same\ntime, or --",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t have been grieving. As -- now this 1s a -- a year later, for one thing. I was busy\ndoing my work. I thought of him, I car -- I still have the same picture I carried with him --\nwith his wings, and the last letter I wrote him, or he wrote me, excuse me, which was a V-\nmail letter, but they never photographed it. And I am curious to know why it was never\nphotographed, because they came all photographed, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with the\n-- well, V -- V mail, you would write on this certain paper, you could only have one sheet\nand they would photograph and put them into microfilm. And then they sent that microfilm.\nThey\u2019d get thousands and thousands of letters on this little spool of microfilm. And that\nJuly 15, 1995\nsaved hundreds of cubic feet in a cargo ship, sending all these letters back and forth. This\nletter, dated July, it looks like seven, but he made it an eight and he was missing on the 10th.\nAnd it says, \u201cI\u2019m going to be busy for awhi -- this\u2019Il probably be the last letter you get from\nme, cause I\u2019m going to by busy, but you\u2019!l hear about it soon enough.\u201d And that -- why\nwould they sent that handwritten, you know, piece, the original piece. So I still have that\nand his picture, which I carried all overseas with me and kept even when I remarried and my\nhusband knew it was in my drawer and it stayed there and it\u2019s still there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Let me turn the tape over, while we have a break.",
        "A: Okay.",

        "Q: This is side two with Louise Birch. July 15th, 1995, in West Park, New York. W-We\nstopped before, we were talking about being in Germany in April, 1945. You must have\ngotten word there about the death of President Roosevelt?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about that?",
        "A: Well, being a staunch Republican, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d Which is terrible. But\neveryone was stunned and you know, what\u2019s going to happen now? That, I think was the\nfirst concern about everybody, what\u2019s going to happen now. Because he certainly, you\nJuly 15, 1995\nknow, did give us good leadership. But then we heard about this guy named Truman and\nwent on with our work.",
        "Q: And shortly thereafter?",
        "A: It was VE Day. And I think I told you about stealing the denatured alcohol out of the\noperating room and --",
        "Q: No, you didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Oh, didn\u2019t I?",
        "Q: No, you -- I think you need to.",
        "A: We had what we call solution basins, they were little porcelain basins that we\u2019d soak\ninstruments in in alcohol and stuff and we swiped -- we had this denatured alcohol -- would\nkill you, you know, kill you. Put that in and we had powdered grape juice, it\u2019d turn it all\npurple. Whoosh, whoosh it around, whoosh it around. Oh.",
        "Q: Terrible.",
        "A: Terrible. And -- and -- our whole, Ecky was the only one that was sober that night and\nshe had these what we call number 10 cans. You know, peanut butter and jelly came in\nthem. She had one by each one of our bunks. Cause we would just roll out of bed and go\nnaa, you know -- couldn\u2019t get up. It\u2019s a wonder we didn\u2019t die.",
        "Q: So you had a big party.",
        "A: Well, not really, you know. We just -- just among ourselves, saying oh, you know,\nwhoopee do. Cause at that time we were right next to the 34th evacuation hospital. They had\nbrought us in and we were supposed to help them out or you know, relieve them of some of\nJuly 15, 1995\ntheir duties. They didn\u2019t like us and we didn\u2019t like them. And I think it was just a -- an ego\ntrip, you know? Maybe the nurses were afraid that we\u2019d infringe on their officers or\nwhatever, but we could care less, you know. We -- we were our own li -- we were very\ncliquey as you can notice and we were our own little establishment and so we did what we\nhad to do and they did what they had to do, until our men up and left us. And then we had to\nstay with the 34th, because they --",
        "Q: Well, what happened there? Your --",
        "A: Well, that was right after VE Day, maybe two days after, three days after, I\u2019m not sure\non what date. We were used to hearing our tents being pulled down, cause the hospital was\nalways moving. And one morning, there\u2019s the tents coming down. And they came and told\nus we had to move out of our tents, but we weren\u2019t going with them. And they had one big\ntent. So all of us 40 nurses were in this one big tent. We had to stay behind and we j -- we\njust felt so abandoned, because we\u2019d been a family for so long. How could you do this, you\nknow? \u201cWe\u2019re going on to Austria and you\u2019re staying here with the 34th.\u201d And oh, there\nwere tears, because we had some romances going on and you know, \u201cWe don\u2019t know. We\ndon\u2019t know nothing. You stay here, they\u2019ll feed you, you work with them and that\u2019s it.\u201d And\nsome of the girls were angry and some were sad and some were indignant because, \u201cHow\ncould they do this to us, you know, we\u2019re part of this unit and they\u2019re leaving us.\u201d But off\nthey went. And we didn\u2019t know why. And so we made hay, you know, we played around\nand make -- did what we had to do.",
        "Q: You worked with the other unit?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: We worked with the other unit. Not too much. They -- they were -- they were getting rid\nof -- their patients were being pushed out back to the general hospitals too. And I can\u2019t\nremember, except for just horsing around, like we found that old cart and we used to run\naround the place pulling this cart and --",
        "Q: Horse cart?",
        "A: Well, it was -- I don\u2019t know wh -- maybe it was, but it was like a pushcart, but a big\npushcart. We\u2019d put two of the girls in it and two would pull it, you know and it was stupid,\nyou know, but it was silly. And I can remember sunbathing, we -- 1-it was -- it was getting,\nyou know, it was May then and it was -- it was getting warm and the -- the earth -- I -- I can\nstill smell the earth. The earth was very sour. We were set up in what might have been a\npasture or something and you don\u2019t realize, America here is a new country and our earth is\nstill new. But that\u2019s centuries old over there and it stunk. The earth was sour like -- like it\nwas moldy, but it had an o -- so when the sun hit it, o00. But anyhow, one morning, down\nthe dirt road comes our trucks, trumbling around and yea, tooting the horn, you know.\n\u201cPack your bags, girls, we\u2019re going.\u201d And you didn\u2019t see a happier bunch, you know. And\nin the trucks we went. One truck\u2019s for our bedrolls and two trucks for the nurses. And off\nwe went, singing all the way. And the tarp was down off of the trucks because it was nice\nweather. And we didn\u2019t even ask them, just went and sang and drove through the roads and\nthe countryside was so beautiful, the trollian houses with the flower boxes and all the\nflowers were starting to bloom. And then the -- we crossed the -- into Austria and you\nJuly 15, 1995\ncould see these -- these rolling Alps in the background, some still had snow on it. And it\nwas just ideal. We were in heaven, really in heaven.",
        "Q: The war was over?",
        "A: Yeah, the war was over and this was beautiful and serene and happy and what more\ncould you ask for? And there\u2019s the Danube and we crossed the Danube at Linz and I\nremember going across the bridge at Linz and the Danube and someone mentioned, \u201cThis\nis the city Hitler was born in. Linz, Austria, he was born here.\u201d \u201cSo? He ain\u2019t around any\nmore, we don\u2019t care.\u201d And we drove out, just through a corner of Linz itself and off we\nwent. All alongside the river we were driving. Just beautiful. Singing away, having a ball.",
        "Q: How long did you travel? Just one day?",
        "A: Oh yeah, not even a whole day. Wasn\u2019t that long, I think we were not too far from the\nAus-Austrian border. And all of a sudden the singing stopped, one by one we stopped\nsinging. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. Something\u2019s wrong, what\u2019s wrong? I don\u2019t know, what\u2019s\nwrong? Something\u2019s the matter with the air.\u201d\u201d We didn\u2019t even see the place and we could\nsmell it. And the truck came down around the corner and there she was. This big, gray,\ngranite wall, with guardhouses every so often and barbed wire [inaudible] and we just --\nfirst your mouth would open and then your hand went over your mouth. And we drove up in\nfront of these huge gates.",
        "Q: Watch your microphone, yeah.",
        "A: We drove up in front of these huge gates. And usually the enlisted men got right out of\nthe trucks and opened the tailgate for us, so we could get down. This time they didn\u2019t. The\nJuly 15, 1995\ngates were shut. And we just sat there, all with our hands over our mouth, eyes as big as\nsaucers. At that time we didn\u2019t see any bodies. There were a few -- I like to call them stick\nfigures. You know how you draw a stick figure? Their hips stuck out, their legs came down\nand this little ball on top for a head. A couple of them were walking around.",
        "Q: Outside of the gates?",
        "A: No, inside, cause we were inside the -- the wall came around and then the -- the -- the big\ngate was in here on the -- on the block house. And some had striped uniforms on, some had\njust a blanket on them. Stark naked. Some had the blanket wrapped around their heads so\nyou wouldn\u2019t know who they were. They were afraid of being recognized, that\u2019s how --\nand, you know, \u201cWhat? What is this?\u201d And the other girls may have told you the same\nthing, our colonel came out and the first words out of his mouth were, \u201cThere are no\nAmericans here.\u201d Which would -- cause you didn\u2019t know what you were looking at. There\nwas no identification on them.",
        "Q: You were afraid that could have been an American POW camp?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah, we didn\u2019t know. You couldn\u2019t tell. Just a -- so then he started his little spiel about,\n\u201cYou girls were not sent over here to do this work, you girls were not trained to do this\nwork. You girls were not -- are not equipped to do this work. And I will not order any one\nof you in this camp.\u201d He was visibly upset and I personally think that he had grandiose\nJuly 15, 1995\nplans of -- for himself, being in some nice hospital, doing some great deeds. I don\u2019t know,\nthat\u2019s my personal opinion.",
        "Q: This was your commanding officer?",
        "A: Commanding officer.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Colonel Dale Friend. Who has -- was quite a researcher at Peter Bent Brigham\nHospital in Boston. But -- so after he gave his spiel, the GIs let down those tailgates and we\njumped out, two oh one. Everyone of them. And I think he was shocked that we all\nresponded in that way, cause he just stood there. \u201cNow wait a minute,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s\ngoing to be rules and regulations.\u201d Or words to that effect. \u201c\u201cYou can\u2019t be here after dark,\nyou can\u2019t be here by yourself. At all times you\u2019re with another person, even in the wards.\nYou have to be completely covered. I don\u2019t want them to even know you\u2019re f -- a female.\u201d\nYeah, supposed to wear a -- the turbans and masks over our face. Our -- our dungarees that\nwe had. Little puttees around our ankles and our boots.",
        "Q: What are those, I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: Puttees are actually left over from World War One. They\u2019re a canvas, like a ski sock and\nthey -- and they buckle across, so they keep your pants into your boots, because of course,\ntyphus was such a rage there, anything get up your pants and you\u2019ve had it. So -- although\nwe'd all been inoculated. So, with that, you know, they -- they took us to our -- our nurses\nquarters, cause we didn\u2019t go right into the camp itself then. And -- which was nice, it was\nthe first time we had a nice hou -- we had three nice house -- I think there were three, yeah.\nJuly 15, 1995\nThree nice houses up on top of a hill, overlooking the Danube. Couldn\u2019t have been better.\nAnd these German girls all -- you know, I do -- I do -- can I do -- can I do, you know, and\nthey couldn\u2019t do -- like, one of the girls was saying today, you remember you put down --\nyou put down your -- your panties and they\u2019d snatch them up and go wash them. You put\nthem -- take them out to put them on, they\u2019re gone, she\u2019s out there washing them. They\ncouldn\u2019t --",
        "Q: They were from the local --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: From Linz?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. They couldn\u2019t do enough for you. And I -- still having this hatred in me, I --\nyou know, who you trying to kid, you know? Which side were you on, you know? Now,\nyou\u2019re tone -- turncoat? I -- I didn\u2019t trust anybody that was like that. I -- I really couldn\u2019t. I\nfigured, last week you were doing that for the Germans. But anyhow, th-they were victims.",
        "Q: And what -- had they been working for the German officers?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know?",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t be surprised, you know?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And there again, it\u2019s survival. A sense of survival. Just like the poor inmates in the camp.\nWhy did this one live and thousands other die? They had a survival. And I\u2019m sure a lot of\nthem must have had a guilty complex going home. Especially if their whole family died.\nJuly 15, 1995\nWhy did he live? That\u2019s -- you know, I would -- I would have no idea what that feeling is\nlike, but I imagine there must be a lot that -- that have that feeling.",
        "Q: So you would -- you would have your quarters and then they would come and get you\nand you would go down to the camp?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah the trucks would always take -- we couldn\u2019t walk. We were in -- supposed to\nbe walking outside the areas, because you didn\u2019t know what was out there. The trucks\nwould bring us down to the camp and we would work and eat and they would take us back\nto quarters and we stayed there.",
        "Q: And the name of the camp?",
        "A: Was Camp Gusen, which was a satellite of Mauthausen. Mauthausen was up on the\nhill and they brought down -- well, Gusen enough -- had enough of it\u2019s own patients, but\nsome of the patients from Mauthausen, because there was no medical facilities up there.\nAnd our wards were set up, they must have told you, in former SS barracks. But we used the\nsame -- I guess you\u2019d call it the same three tiered bunks, for the inmates, except there was\nonly one in each bunk instead of three or four. And they had beds of straw, because I, you\nknow, I never questioned, when I was there, where\u2019d all these blankets come from? Or\nwhere\u2019d these pajamas come from? And evidently they must have flown them in and it\nwasn\u2019t -- this Mike Wordell, who I\u2019d wanted to come, he told me -- and I didn\u2019t realize it at\nthe time, there were two units that were sent in, which were called delousing units. That\u2019s\nall they did. And they were behind the walls, delou -- cause these guys all -- pa -- inmates,\nJuly 15, 1995\npatients, whatever you want to call them, had to be completely deloused before they were\nbrought out to us.",
        "Q: So that had been going on before you arrived?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, before we arrived. And then -- and while we were there, because as we\nwould have, say eight deaths a night, we\u2019d have eight -- eight empty beds, they\u2019d bring out -\n- but they were -- they were doing this behind the wall. Washing them down and delousing\nthem and giving them either a blanket or pajamas, whatever was flown in. And I didn\u2019t\nknow about that, I didn\u2019t even question, \u201cWhere 1s this all coming?\u201d I should have said,\n\u201cHow come?\u201d You know?",
        "Q: And what did you do then, you would come every day into the same ward?",
        "A: We\u2019d come in -- into the same ward, yeah.",
        "Q: And how many people were -- would be in there, do you know?",
        "A: I would say at least 100, but I am not sure. 120 - 140, I\u2019m not sure. Rooms on both sides\nand they were big, big rooms. And --",
        "Q: And a hallway in the middle?",
        "A: Big hallway and open door here and an open door at the other end, so that you could --\nthe hallway itself was very dark, but you could see light at the end of the tunnel. And I -- I\nlike to think of that, yes there is a light at the end of the tunnel. One of -- and I think I told\nyou that we were not allowed to have any physical contact with the patients. We could not --\ninmates, whatever you want to call them. We were not allowed to give them nursing care.\nThey brought in either prisoners of war -- German prisoners of war or people from the\nJuly 15, 1995\ncommunity. Went out in trucks and rounded them up and they stayed there for the day, fed,\nwashed and cleaned. These guys did what they could.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t touch them?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t touch them. We weren\u2019t allowed to touch them. The only thing we did was\ngive them medication.",
        "Q: Every day?",
        "A: Every day. Those that needed. We learned the word diarrhea in three languages and I\u2019m\nnot sure that I can even say the -- the names today and I\u2019m sure they would too, because one\nwas Russian, one was Polish and one was, I guess French, because we had a very sweet\nFrenchman who spoke beautiful English. And whatever we were saying, he says, \u201cSister,\u201d\ncause they call the nurses sister, \u201cdon\u2019t say\u201d -- and I think we were -- I forget the word we\nwere saying, but -- excuse me, but we were saying shits. And he wanted -- he said, \u201cIt\u2019s\ndeeareeah. That\u2019s not nice,\u201d he said. Cause we\u2019d stand at the -- at the door and yell out these\nthree words and those who had diarrhea, would raise their little old hand up, you know and\nwe'd go over and we\u2019d give them their medicine.",
        "Q: Huh. And that\u2019s how you cared for them, huh?",
        "A: That\u2019s -- that\u2019s the only way. I don\u2019t think we kept any records. Maybe number wise, I --\nthings like that I don\u2019t remember. I know we didn\u2019t keep records, cause we didn\u2019t know\ntheir names. Towards the end of our stay there, things seemed to ease -- you know, maybe\nbecause we\u2019d been there long enough to not be so tense, that we were able to talk to some of\nthe patients through an interpreter. And I got a couple of names that I wrote to their -- one\nJuly 15, 1995\nwas a sister back in the States and one was some other kind of a relative. To tell them, you\nknow, they\u2019re begging, \u201cT-Tell America I\u2019m here,\u201d you know. And at that time you\ncouldn\u2019t say exactly where they were, you know, just someplace in Austria was the term\nyou had to use. A-And you couldn\u2019t say exactly what their condition was. When I got back\nto the States and I must have given my address back at the States, I got a letter from one\nwoman in Evanston, Illinois and she had gotten my letter and sent me a check for 50\ndollars, to do something for her brother, it was her brother. And so by this time I\u2019m back in\nthe States, so I wrote back to her exactly where he was, exactly his condition and sent her\nback the 50 dollars. Hopefully he was still alive. And I said, \u201cContact your Red Cross. Now\nyou know exactly where he was. Whether he\u2019s still there now, I don\u2019t know.\u201d I never heard\nfrom the other one that I wrote from, but -- to -- so I -- you know, sometimes I think -- I\nwonder how he made out. Did he make it out of there, did he make it to America. So --",
        "Q: So you -- you did - -you were, after awhile, able to have some communication with some\nof the people?",
        "A: Some of the -- some of them. Not very many. Our -- our corpsman happened to be a\ngreat guy. He was -- I think he was Mexican and he spoke Spanish fluently and he could\nspeak a few words of German or Polish, whatever it was. And he was able to -- well, this,\nyou know and then you could do with hand signals, too, you know and there wasn\u2019t much\nyou could talk to them about. They were too weak for one thing. I don\u2019t know if I told you\nthe -- an-and Ecky knows I will tell you the story where we weren\u2019t supposed to look like\nwomen and like I told you, we used to give out these medicines together and she\u2019d give the\nJuly 15, 1995\npills and I\u2019d be behind her with a bottle of whatever it was I had to pour out and give it to\nthem. And I\u2019m waiting for her, she\u2019s bending over, giving this guy his pills. And out from\nthe other bunk comes this little bony hand and pats her on the fanny. And I\u2019m standing there\n-- not laughing out loud, but saying, \u201cThere\u2019s hope for them after all. There\u2019s still life in\nthem,\u201d you know, really -- which you -- and of course, she didn\u2019t even feel it, it was so\nweak. And when she stood up and I\u2019m -- and I says, \u201cWho we kidding? They know who we\nare.\u201d You know and she\u2019s, \u201cWhy?\u201d And I -- I get tears. I can still see him now, doing that. It\nwas -- it was cute. It was pathetic that 1t was cute.",
        "Q: Did you know who these people were? Were they -- did -- I mean, som -- they were from\ndifferent countries, were there -- there were some Jewish people, mostly Jewish people, do\nyou know?",
        "A: Oh, I think there were -- I -- I -- I would -- I couldn\u2019t swear, but I would say I thought\nmost of them were Jewish.",
        "Q: At the time, you did, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. But we had Frenchmen. We had one Spanish guy who worked on the ward. He\nwas another one I didn\u2019t trust, cause he was a -- a -- a trustee for the Germans. And he was -\n- looked well preserved. And he had been in the Spanish revolution and had gotten caught\nsomehow and you know, and the Germans helped them out. Roberto his name was. But he\nhelped us out. But these people, no, we didn\u2019t know who they were. Had no idea. There was\neven Russians there too, I think.",
        "Q: At the time, did you feel that what you were doing for them was helpful?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: It must have helped a little bit, but 1t was like swimming upstream. You made a little\nprogress, but not much, you know. You nourished them, but you had to start out with, you\nknow -- thin, thin soup, because you couldn\u2019t give them food, per se. And just the thought\nthat they were free, you know, must have been something.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I\u2019m sure, you know, I see pictures of these survivors now for the ho -- in the\nHolocaust and God, they look great. So they -- you know, they -- life does -- you know, the\nbody does improve.",
        "Q: Oh, you mean survivors today?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. That they interview on TV and you would say n -- look at them. You\ncouldn\u2019t have been in a concentration camp, but you know. You know yourself, if\nsomeone\u2019s really sick and loses a lot of weight, gets better, they do come back, but -- the\nbody is a wonderful machine. So -- it\u2019s too bad it gets abused.",
        "Q: How long were you at Gusen?",
        "A: I would s -- I think about five weeks we were there, because we left to go home, either --\nit was either on my birthday or the day after. It was either June 21st or 22nd, I remember.\nMy birthday.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And were you informed suddenly that you were going to leave and --",
        "A: I think probably a week\u2019s notice, yeah.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "Q: And did you -- by the -- by the end of that period, did you feel as if some of the people\nthat you were caring for had made progress, or -- was the situation better when you left than\nwhen you came?",
        "A: Well, the -- the attitude was better, you know. It wa -- it was a lot more relaxed, because\nwe went in there with -- so tight and so tense and you were all literally afraid of them,\nbecause, you know, they were so riddled with disease and hey, you know, you\u2019re protected.\nAnd --",
        "Q: Did any of the nurses get sick?",
        "A: Well, as far as we -- now, they\u2019re talking about the DDT, which you heard about. The --\nyou know, several of our nurses have developed breast cancer. But, with the ratio of breast\ncancer today, I -- I can\u2019t see blaming it on the DDT that we had --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t tell me this -- you were sprayed with DDT every day\u201d",
        "A: Every day, yeah. Down our pants, up our arms and in the back of our necks. She had an\nold flint gun, I don\u2019t know if you know what a flint gun it. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a ca -- a canister on\nthe end of a sh-sh-sh pump thing. And I think flit they used to use for flies or mosquitoes or\nsomething. You\u2019d fill this canister with whatever and that was filled with DDT powder.\nAnd we\u2019d stand in front of our chief nurse and pull our pants out. How degrading, when you\nthink of it. But that\u2019s how we had to go on. The first couple of days that we worked at the\ncamp, we felt so bad, so dirty, so contaminated, that we would come back to our nurses\nquarters and literally strip, outside the door and just drop our drawers right there and these\nnice German girls would grab them and wash them for us, cause we didn\u2019t want to go in the\nJuly 15, 1995\nhouse with this aroma around us. You know, and -- and that odor clung to you -- your\nclothes after awhile, too. So -- and after awhile you didn\u2019t notice it.",
        "Q: What other kinds of things that you know of were going on at the camp, in addition to\nthe care that you were giving? What else was happening there, do you know?",
        "A: Well, I know they got musical instruments for some of the inmates that were musically\ninclined. I don\u2019t know where they came from. I imagine they just walked into somebody\u2019s\nhouse and took them. That\u2019s what they usually did. This Jeannie Striker that I gave you her\n-- her papers, she worked with the women. Now, I never saw the women. I knew they were\nthere, but I never saw them. Some of the men went in town and got bolts of material and\nbrought it out to the women and she said they practically clawed at the material, they\ncouldn\u2019t wait to get a piece of it, to make themselves, you know, a top or a -- you know, a\nmuumuu type dress or shorts or something, something to put on their bodies. And -- but\nthat\u2019s the only story I ever heard from her from the women.",
        "Q: Do you know if there were children around?",
        "A: I never saw a child, no. Thank God.",
        "Q: So there were survivors there who were well enough to play musical instruments?",
        "A: Yeah, but, you know, there were all grades of degration or something. I don\u2019t know\nwhat you want to call it. There were some that could not move at all and some that walked\naround. And yes, they could play a violin. Maybe not as well as they did in days gone by.\nAnd the spirit is always there, I guess, if you\u2019re a musician. I\u2019m not. But --",
        "Q: Was Gusen by that time, being called a DP camp?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Mm-mm, mm-mm.",
        "Q: Never was?",
        "A: Not as far as I know. It wasn\u2019t at that time, anyhow. And we were the 131st evacuation\nhospital at Gusen.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Were there people arriving there from other places?",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "Q: I know that happened in some other --",
        "A: Mm-mm. We had more than we could take care of.",
        "Q: Do you have any sense of how many\u201d?",
        "A: Oh, someone at one time told me there were four -- we had 4000 pa -- we were a 400 bed\nhospital, originally, this little tent hospital -- and that we had 4000 patients. But there were,\naccording to that confession, there were what, 60,00 inmates there? So that\u2019s just a drop in\nthe bucket.",
        "Q: Did you have a chance to walk around the camp at all, or -- did you go up to\nMauthausen, the main camp, or --",
        "A: I never got up there and you had to have -- you had to know somebody to get up there,\nbecause that was off limits as far as I know. I did get in -- behind the camp there was this\nnice, rolling hill and I did get back there and inside that hill was a complete factory --\nrailroad tracks and everything. And I was told they were making Mezzerschmidts planes in\nthere. In fact I brought home a piece of -- still have it -- piece of balsa wood that was\npainted like a -- a dark, dark olive green and you can just about see a swastika on it. And\nJuly 15, 1995\nsomeone else told me it was a news -- news -- ammunition place and this Mike that I talked\nto on the phone, who didn\u2019t make it here, that was our interpreter, he claims that they were\nmaking parts for the V2 bombs there. But it was a complete factory back there, all\nunderground in a bi -- big cavern. And when I went back to Germany and Austria years\nlater with my daughters and I -- we were in Strasbourg, that was as far as we were -- we\nwere going to go. I said, \u201cHey, we have enough time to go to Linz.\u201d And my daughter, at\nthis time, she was doing all the driving. \u201cOh Ma, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo,\u201d and I just,\nby my nose, crossed the bridge, turned right, follow the river. And she said, \u201cDo you know\nwhere you\u2019re going?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, but it\u2019s in this direction.\u201d Oh, and she was getting so\nupset with me. You know, it\u2019s like looking for a needle in a haystack. And I said, \u201cSlow\ndown.\u201d In the -- over on the horizon, I saw that same hill. I says, \u201cWe\u2019re coming there, we --\nI know we\u2019re coming there.\u201d And there it was.",
        "Q: The camp?",
        "A: The camp. TV antennas out of what was our wards, lace curtains, flower boxes.",
        "Q: People were living in those buildings?",
        "A: Oh, painted white and beautiful. I have pictures downstairs, Ill have to show you. They\nhad -- just before you got to the camp, there was a -- a memorial to the camp built. And it\nwas like a -- a maze and you went ar -- and there were all pictures and sayings all around\nthis cement wall right in the center, where the ovens -- but it was locked, you couldn\u2019t get\nin. So I went -- there was a little, like I call it a 7-11 Store next door. By this time my\ndaughter\u2019s really mad at me. So I went next door and I -- you know, we wanted the key to\nJuly 15, 1995\nget in there. Oh, hese wasa sloe shanol. He couldn\u2019t speak English, I couldn\u2019t speak\nGerman and he was very upset that I wanted to get in there.",
        "Q: In where?",
        "A: In -- into this little maze, see, it was locked. There was a padlock on it. And I say, I want\nto get -- and he was upset, he was visibly upset. And I didn\u2019t know what he was saying, he\ndidn\u2019t know what I was saying. So finally I\u2019m going -- cause we all wore the Red Cross on\nour sleeve. \u201cBoom, boom, cranksfester.\u201d And that\u2019s what I thought was nurse in -- in\nGerman. Boom, boom. All of a sudden he got the message and he -- his wife comes out with\nwine and cheese and they\u2019re hugging me and kissing me and my daughter\u2019s standing there\nlike this. She was so mad. He come over and opened up the gate and oh, oh, oh -- couldn\u2019t\ndo enough for me. So, you know, I walked all the way around in -- inside with the ovens\nthey had. I\u2019ve got pictures downstairs in my album, Ill have to show you.",
        "Q: So, that was the crematorium there, is that what you mean by ovens?",
        "A: Well it -- th-they had taken the ovens out of -- you know, where the crematorium was in\nbehind that -- that\u2019s another story that -- where I\u2019m telling you the -- the barracks were made\nup like nice houses with TV antennas. And then there\u2019s the big block house, which had the\nbig gates in it and those -- it was all boarded over, the gates had been removed to\nsomeplace. Maybe -- maybe they were in the maze, I forget. But we drove up on top of the\nquarry, which is famous for those last steps and looked down into what was the big\ncompound. Course all those barracks were blown up and burnt down. Guess what they were\nusing it for? They made tombstones there.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "Q: From the stone 1n the quarry?",
        "A: [inaudible] all these beautiful carved --",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Tell me about the quarry. What -- what do you know about that whole --",
        "A: I\u2019m losing [inaudible]",
        "Q: You want to -- let me --",
        "A: I just saw --",
        "Q: I understand there was a quarry at this Mauthausen - Gusen complex --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- where people were forced to carry stones. Did you hear about that, did you see\nevidence of that?",
        "A: Well we -- we have the picture that the -- our chaplain gave us of the steps, they call\nthem the steps of death, and --",
        "Q: What were they? They were --",
        "A: They were just granite. Everything that Mauthausen and Gusen was built at were huge\nblocks of granite and it all came from that quarry. And they\u2019re still using the quarry to make\ntombstones. But I drove down there once, I must have had a date with somebody that had a\nJeep and it was weird, you know, these -- you -- like in a -- almost in the Grand Canyon,\nthese walls and walls of rock, you know. And I saw the steps and that was all and I wanted\nto get out of there, cause it was eerie.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "Q: And -- and the -- these were steps that went up to the quarry, or --",
        "A: No, th-they came out of the quarry and they -- they must have built these steps cause they\nwere also of these big blacks of -- blocks of granite and then there\u2019s a big wall to one side,\nin fact other side of the steps, that they must have built as they went up. And when they got\nto the very top, I don\u2019t know what was up there, more for maybe trucks or something to take\nthese blocks or quarries -- o-of granite someplace else. But it was eerie. And then to drive\nup there 20 years -- was it 20 le -- years later? Hm. Must have been more than that. But to\nlook down and see all of these tombstones down there in that compound, I thought, \u201cYou\nson of a gun.\u201d So somebody\u2019s making a good business. So -- even the roadblocks, there was\na roadblock between our quarters and Gusen, that of course had been discombobulated for\nus to go through, but that was built of big blocks of this quarry.",

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And where did you go?",
        "A: We went back to France, by -- this time we went by train. The nurses and the officers\nwere in first class cars and the men were in horse cattles. Again, segregation. And every so\noften the train would stop and they would say, nurses, we -- we\u2019re not to look out to the side\nJuly 15, 1995\nbecause the men were all having their relief break. And the -- the train would stop and start\nbecause the tracks were, you know, in repair or -- you know. It was -- it was a -- seemed to\nme a long ride to where we got. Then there were trucks that took us first to -- I f -- I think\nthey took us first to what we call Camp 20 grand. They had all these little like reppo-\ndeppo\u2019s, which were replacement depots for different units and they were named after\ncigarettes. First we went to Camp 20 grand, then we went to Camp Lucky Strike, which was\ngreat. It was up on top of a hill, overlooking the -- the Seine in -- in France, except this was\njust a huge rockpile. There again, we had to live in tents again. They were pitched on these\nrocks and we had to wash our hair out of tin cans and we had a good mess hall, which was\nrun by the German POWs. And they would be quite fresh to us, but sometimes they\u2019d say,\n\u201cNo sugar today for your coffee. No sugar today. No sugar today for your coffee.\u201d Well, I\ndon\u2019t take sugar in my coffee, it didn\u2019t bother me. The other girls -- at night they\u2019d have\nsugar cookies they\u2019d make for us. You know, they\u2019d try to make up, you know, they -- they\nwould do this on purpose to make something nice for us. So th-they were also trying to be\nnice. See, I\u2019m still -- had this distrust of the people. And -- I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t like anyone\nthat got too familiar. And we finally found out they had a ship, we were going home. We\nhad our footlockers all packed and away they went and they went down to the harbor and\nsomebody\u2019s packing the -- the -- and they -- course they were all stenciled with our names.\n\u2018\u201cWho\u2019s this Mary? Females? No way. Unload, unload,\u201d and the poor GIs, just cause we\nwere females, our men couldn\u2019t go either. So they --",
        "Q: Huh. Why? Why\u2019?\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: There were no facilities on that ship for females and why they kept the men behind,\nbecause we couldn\u2019t get on, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: What does that mean, no facilities for females?",

And here these guys have been sitting, waiting\nto go home too, just as much as we had. And then we finally got the General Bliss, which\nhad an area that they could, you know, core our -- you know -- yeah --",
        "Q: Cordon off.",
        "A: Cordon off.",
        "Q: That was a big ship, the General Bliss?",
        "A: Ha -- It was big, but it wasn\u2019t that -- it wasn\u2019t as big as the Queen Elizabeth, that\u2019s for\nsure.",
        "Q: And where did you leave from, what port?",
        "A: We left from Le Havre, in France and we wound up in Boston. And it was great, you\nknow, when the boats were out there and welcoming -- and bands were in the boats and\nfrom there we went to -- in fact, w-we -- I remember it was the fish pier in -- in Boston,\nJuly 15, 1995\nwhich 1s still there and we got on trains that were right there at the fish pier and they took us\ndown to Camp Miles Standish, on the Cape. Not quite too far down on the Cape, but some\npart on the Cape. It\u2019s now a big campground, I guess. And they were great. They had -- you\nknow, welcome home and we slept in -- like it was a huge ward, so we were all together, but\nthere were sheets, the first time we\u2019d had sheets 1n -- oh, months and months and months,\nwe haven\u2019t had a sheet. And it was great. I remember calling my mother, cause you could\ncall whoever you want to call and they had the -- papers had a habit of printing what units\nwere landing when and where and she had seen in the paper that the 131st was coming into\nNew York Harbor at such and such a date. Well, that must have been the first boat that they\nwere loading our stuff on. So she says, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d I said, \u201cUp in Massachusetts\nsomeplace, Camp Miles Stand,\u201d -- \u201cYou get right home here.\u201d I said, \u201cHuh? I can\u2019t. I\u2019m still\nin the army, you know.\u201d \u201cWell, you were supposed to arrive,\u201d -- buppabuppa. I said, \u201cNo,\nMother.\u201d So we finally went to Camp Dix and got our leave papers. We had 30 day leave\nand then we were booked to go to CBI, China-Burma-India area. And we knew it and\nthen we figured -- but while we were on leave, VJ was declared, so --",
        "Q: You remember the dropping of the bomb?",
        "A: Yes, I do, yes. And I\u2019m sorry to say, I was all for it and still am. Not now, I wouldn\u2019t\nwant to drop today. I mean what they\u2019re making today is 10 times bigger than that. But I\njust felt that it saved our men a lot. And to me it was -- they\u2019re the ones that started it.\nWoody and | are going over to Hawaii for the VJ ceremonies in August, yeah, the end of\nAugust, so --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "Q: So you knew right away then that you wouldn\u2019t be going over?",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t, but you know, we didn\u2019t know whether we\u2019d be made to go in the army\nof occupation or what, so we had to report back to Camp Polk. Now Woody was in the\nservice longer than I -- girls that had longer service, they had points and you got out by a\ncertain point system. If you were married -- not a widow, but if you were married, if you\u2019d\nbeen in the service so long, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, you could be discharged. And we had\nseven discharged from Camp Polk. Another gal and I got orders to go to San Antone,\nTexas. Fort Sam Houston, which 1s a huge hospital. When I got down there, hadn\u2019t worked\non a ward, didn\u2019t know what to do. Didn\u2019t know how to do anything, actually. Hadn\u2019t\nworked -- how to make a bed, even. And this young whippersnapper had just gotten in the\narmy and I\u2019m saying, \u201cWell, how do you do this,\u201d and, \u201chow do you do that?\u201d And she --\nshe thinks, well, I must have just got in the army before she -- you know, after she did and\nso she\u2019s giving me this [indecipherable]. She says, \u201cWell where were you last month?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cI was over in Germany,\u201d you know. Or where were you when VE Day, that was -- I\ncan remember her saying to me. I said, \u201cI was in Germany.\u201d \u201cIn Germany\u201d? What were you\ndoing there?\u201d So she thought I had just joined the army, acting so dumb, well how do you\ndo this and how do you do that? And so I met my present -- my ex-husband there. He was in\nthe Air Corps and we got married and life starts anew.",
        "Q: Yeah. How long did you stay in the service?",
        "A: Well, I got out just before Christmas then, so -- so it was about 18 months total, I was in.",
        "Q: What a year.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. In fact, I was embarrassed because when I met my husband to be, he\nwas very shy and didn\u2019t say boo and I thought, \u201cOh, what a dud you are.\u201d You know, and so\nI\u2019m telling him how I -- cause you got 300 dollars when you were mustered out. In other\nwords when you were discharged, they gave you 300 dollars to survive on. And I told him\nhow I was putting up a notice on the ward, I\u2019d pay anybody on the ward my mustering out\npay that would marry me to get me out of the service.",

        "A: Mm-hm. Well, in those days -- you\u2019re thinking -- talking 1939 -- is when I graduated\nfrom high school. So my mother said I could go to college and become a teacher. Well, I\ndidn\u2019t want to become a teacher, I wanted to become a nurse. So I stayed home for a whole\nyear and did absolutely nothing. And she finally said to me, \u201cGo, go,\u201d you know. \u201cT\u2019ll pay\nfor it,\u201d because in those days you had to pay for a nursing education. And it was Dad\u2019s\nresponsibility. So, anyhow, make a long story short, I became a nurse and he never\ncongratulated me or anything, until I got in the service. And he wrote me a letter that he\nwanted to come down and do an article on the nurses, the army nurses. And by the time I\nJuly 15, 1995\ngot the letter, we were all -- already overseas, living 1n tents. In fact it was [indecipherable]\nwho helped me compose a letter back to my father saying, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to do a story\non us. We don't look like nurses, we don\u2019t act like nurses. We\u2019re,\u201d you know, \u201cwe\u2019re living\nin tents and,\u201d you know, \u201cwalking in mud and not the sterile atmosphere that you think, the\nwhite, crisp nurses.\u201d So he dropped the subject. He never said boo to me a -- the rest of my\nlife -- or his life. And --",
        "A: Well, actually, it goes back to -- I was five and a half years old, had a real bad operation\nand I al-almost died, evidently. It was rare in that time -- and I won\u2019t go into it, because,\nwell -- but anyhow, two holes in my belly here. And I can alway -- and I had specials\naround the clock and I can always remember, you know, begging my -- my nurses to, \u201cOh,\nI'd give you a drink if you were thirsty,\u201d you know, and -- cause I couldn\u2019t have any water,\nanything to drink and stuff. And that must have been what was instilled in me.",
        "A: Cause I had no idea what nursing was like when I went into training. In fact, my mother,\nwhen she finally said go, she said, \u201cI give you a couple of months and you\u2019ll be back.\u201d And\nI said, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t, I'll stick it out.\u201d And I did.",
        "A: Well, that -- that\u2019s almost another s -- chapter in my life. I had my boyfriend through\nhigh school was -- had gone in the service before he was drafted, so -- and he and --\nJuly 15, 1995\nvolunteered for the airborne. He was in the 82nd Airborne Division. And in training we\nweren\u2019t allowed to be married. And we had been really romantic and he knew he was going\noverseas and so he got leave and I sneaked out and we got married. Well, his -- his family\nknew about it and my family knew about it. It was a real simple ceremony and we just had a\nweekend pass. And that was the last I saw of him. He went o -- he was in the invasion of\nSicily and he was mi -- th-that\u2019s a thorn in my side, he was considered an MIA for a year.\nThen he -- they you\u2019re dead. Not like the MIA\u2019s today that they\u2019re still -- you know, I know\nthat they have to look for these people, but they didn\u2019t look for the boys in the World War\nTwo. And there were many of them that they never found. And unless there\u2019s blue eyed\nblondes running around Sicily, then I don\u2019t know where he 1s. And -- so I went trying to\nfind some trace of him. I\u2019d written to his chaplain and I\u2019d written to a lieutenant that used to\ncensor our letters and never got any response. Went to the Red Cross, never got any\nresponse. So, I finally found -- when I was in the service, and I was stationed down Atlantic\nCity in what they called England General Hospital -- it was one of the big hotels in\nAtlantic City at the time, they made a hospital. And I found a -- a fellow that was in his\ncompany. And so he invited me over to his apartment with his wife and we got talking and\nhe knew that my -- my Hughie had jumped, and he -- cause I wondered, you know, did he\neven make it over there? And he said, \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that was a\u201d -- I guess that whole\noperation was a faux pas, you know. They went off of target and whatever. So anyhow, at\nleast I knew that he did his duty, [indecipherable]\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Hugh Sheridan. And that\u2019s why they call me Sherry. My maiden name was Williams.\nSo at least I found that out.",
        "A: Well, actually it was a year that they -- well no, 1t wasn\u2019t a year, because they had listed\nhim as missing in action and his pap -- picture was in the paper and a | -- his -- his family\nhad given this little blurb that -- you know, he\u2019d just gotten married, etcetera. And I knew\nmy directress of nurses would see this paper, cause it was a local paper. By this time I\u2019m out\nof school, but I felt so bad, cause I had lied to her, you know, to get this little pass that I had.\nSo I went back to her and, you know, in a teary eyed, nice, you know, \u201cMiss Copeland, I\nwant to talk to you and --\u201d so I started to say something, she said, \u201cI know.\u201d She said, \u201cI\nknow you got married.\u201d And I looked at her and -- but she didn\u2019t know, you know, that he\nhad been missing. So she was sorry about that. But it was okay and I guess she probably felt\ngood that I came back to confess my crime or so. But -- you see, we were Catholic and --\nand the banns had to be announced in the church and they were announced in his church,\nwhere -- where she went.",
        "A: And she picked up the n -- the names and she must have even known who was writing to\nme, I don\u2019t know. Cause they knew everything. So that\u2019s --",

        "A: July \u201843.",
        "A: And I got out of school. I finished school probably September \u201843. And by the time you\ntook state boards and, you know, to get your RN, cause you couldn\u2019t join the service until\nyou got your state boards and had physical, papers, it was \u201844. It was early \u201844 that I went in\nthe service.",
        "A: And was stationed down Atlantic City for awhile. And then got my orders to go to\nCamp Polk where the 131st was being started.",
        "A: 131st evacuation hospital, semi-mobile. In other words, you could pick up half of that\nhospital and move it on, while the other half was still operating, although we never did that,\nbut it was equipped to do that. You could even take down half of the operating room, which\nwas a huge, big tent. Look -- it was several tents put together. Looked like a big circus tent,\nalmost. And you could take down half of that and move it on and move half of the wards on.\nAnd we had two teams, you know, nurses and doctors and stuff. But we never did that. We -\n- we all -- when we set up -- set up as a whole and moved the whole unit as a whole, so --",
        "A: Mm.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Yeah, mo-mobile army surgical hospital. And I imagine today that that\u2019s what they call\nit. | don\u2019t think they call it evacuation hospitals any more. The patients that we had stayed\nmaybe -- maybe two nights at the most and then they were either taken by ambulance or air\nevac-ed out.",

        "A: Well, it -- we headed up north in December, early December and by this time we knew\nthat we were heading someplace. We had gotten a leave to go home and it was a short leave,\nprobably 10 days and then we would up at -- and I don\u2019t remember whether it was Camp\nKilmer, someplace in New Jersey. And we did a lot of training, as far as marching with\npacks on our backs and --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Well, well I think we did that down in Fort Jackson, we dug fli -- trenches. We put up\ntents and we hiked and I was -- I think I told you about the gas chamber that we went\nthrough. And then we --",
        "A: Well, it was this -- almost about the -- the length of a barrack, maybe shorter, but there\nwas nothing in it but tear gas.",
        "A: No, no up -- up above. It was all sealed, full of tear gas and there was a sergeant or some\nGI sitting at the end with a pad of paper and a pencil and a desk and you went into the far\nend and walked through this whole chamber of gas, with a gas mask on. You always had to\nhave your gas mask on and you had to put it on properly, too. Cause if it wasn\u2019t properly fit\nthen you got the gas. When you reached this officer -- enlisted man, whatever he was, took\noff your gas mask and told him your name, rank and your serial number. And if you got\nnervous and flubbed -- cause he must have had it right down there what your s-serial\nnumber was, if you missed a number, he\u2019d say, \u201cRepeat that.\u201d You know, and -- but it was\none way to teach us all our serial number, because that was very important. And then you --\nyou got out into the fresh air and then --",
        "A: Oh, he had it on too.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh yeah, he wa -- he was sitting in there with his mask on, but you would take yours off.\nAnd he was just delighting in every, you know, especially with a bunch of females you\nknow and we were all screaming. And -- I imagine -- I know the men had to go through this\ntoo, probably even harder. And --",
        "A: We -- we dug a slit tr -- well, what they call a slit trench, which would just hold a -- a\nbody, you know, in case you got bombed, you could jump into it. And we put our pup tents\nup. And those were small tents, they were like two men tents. And as I remember, each one\nof us carried a half a tent at all times. So if you were ever caught someplace with no shelter,\nyou could double up and -- and -- and put some s -- kind of a shelter up. All those things I\nthink are in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, cause when we came back, stuff was going\nover the side.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, you didn\u2019t want to -- hey, you didn\u2019t want to carry this home. Hopefully you\nwouldn\u2019t need it again, but --",

        "A: No, never --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: No, no. We were given all sorts of films on disease, body lice, sanitary conditions, and I\ndon\u2019t even think there was a film for us on weapons. And there were no weapons in our\nhospital, although I do have a picture of our dental assistant and he\u2019s got a bandoleer of, you\nknow, shells on him. I don\u2019t know where he got it. But --",
        "A: Well, that was -- in the army you do everything, as they say, by the AR\u2019s -- Army\nregulations. There was only one way to dress a wound and you did it that way. You might\nnot like to do it that way, but the army wanted you to do it that way, so yes, we had -- had\nall these army regulations on how to treat this and that. And going over on the ship, I was\nassigned to -- to be an orthopedic surgical nurse. And I met the orthopedic surgeon and he\ngave me a whole list of what we would do for all these orthopedic -- amputations or\nwhatever, you know. And you read them and okay, we\u2019ll do what we have to do.",
        "A: No, no, but -- no, not really, you know, the -- you -- you still had a surgical technique\nthat you had to follow. But they had a particular way of doing things and the army is a\nstickler for that. Y-Y -- In the hospital you might have several different sizes of bandages,\nyou know. In the army, you have one or two sizes. I do -- it may be different now, but 1-in\nwartime it wasn\u2019t anyhow.",
        "A: While we were in England, I saw returning casualties from the Battle of the Bulge. For\nbandages they used the latest issue of \u201cStars and Stripes\u2019, which was the magazine. They\nJuly 15, 1995\nhad no bandages. And we\u2019d get them in the operating room and we\u2019d have to wet down this\nleg that was -- had all this paper -- newspaper stuck to it. Cause that\u2019s the only thing they\nhad. Cause that was a different situation. So you can\u2019t say that they went by army\nregulations. You do what you have to do.",
        "A: We went home for a short leave and I can remember my mother gave me a Hagen\nHague bottle of Scotch, pinch bottle and I hate Scotch. And so we got back to base --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. She -- it wa -- evidently this was a very -- and 1s -- I don\u2019t know, cause I\u2019m\nnot a Scotch -- it\u2019s a very good brand of Scotch. And she said, \u201cTake this back, you know,\nthey might want to have a little party or something.\u201d And when we got back to camp, the\ndoor came down and you could not make a phone call, you could not write a letter, you\ncould not have any visitors. It was -- and I\u2019m trying to think of the name they used. I want to\nsay black out, but it wasn\u2019t -- was the censo-censorship. So my mother never heard from me\nand she\u2019s saying, \u201cOh, Louise got caught with that bottle of -- 1n her --\u201d She said they put\nher on -- you know, put her in the brig or something, cause I got -- and I went in -- I can\nremember going in to the little commissary there and they had a fl -- a florist in there that\nyou -- they could wire flowers out. Pll fix -- Pll get in touch with my mother. So I wired her\na dozen red roses. Course she got them a month later, but I thought they would go right out,\nyou know. But they were smart, you know, and just all I put on 1s, \u201cI love you\u201d, you know.\nAnd -- it didn\u2019t work.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: And we shipped out, yeah. We were -- we were like that for maybe three or four days I\nthink, that you couldn\u2019t do anything. And -- and the other girls must have told you the story\nabout crossing the Hudson at night and this fog rising up and that\u2019s a vision I'll never\nforget.",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember exactly whether -- I know we had gone by train to this barge. Now it\nseemed to me the train was on the barge, but I could be wrong. But I remember crossing, it\nwas dark, night and crossing the river and this fog coming up. And there was this big gray\nthing in front of us. It was huge, huge, several stories high. And you\u2019re looking up at it and\nyou could just make out, Queen E-I-i and then you don\u2019t know what was in around -- and of\ncourse it was all painted gray. The Queen Elizabeth. And we were, \u201cMy God,\u201d you know.\nAnd I -- I get goose pimples right now. This is it. And we all had steel helmets on and they\nchalked mark -- you\u2019re all numbered. And we lined up and they had the -- the roster and you\nknow, one, two, three, four. And then you got to the gangplank and they checked the one,\ntwo, three, four and you got up on top of the gangplank and one, two, three, four and they\nshowed you which way to go. They had our quarters all -- the women were, of course all\nsegregated, cause there were thousands -- thousands on that ship. All the doors on the\nstateroom were removed, there were no doors on the stateroom. They had guards either into\nthe hall, so nobody could go -- nobody else could go and we only could eat twice a day,\nbecause there were so many on there to feed that I guess the ki-kitchen was going\nJuly 15, 1995\nconstantly. You -- you got your -- your seating thing, which was like 10 o\u2019clock in the\nmorning and maybe nine o\u2019clock at night. That\u2019s when you ate. Two meals. Cause they\ncouldn\u2019t feed everybody three meals.",
        "A: Oh we -- yeah, we -- well just -- just the officers. Course it was very segregated. The\nhuge, huge, big lounge. You couldn\u2019t find a place to sit, everyone was sitting on the floor.\nThe few that got a chair were lucky you know, and they weren\u2019t about to give it up. And the\nofficers all mingled -- there were many air corps fellows going back to England. There\nwere many other units. I found out after the war that one of my friends, who I knew as a\nlittle kid, was on that same ship. And he was in -- in fact, he was in the 120th evac hospital.",
        "A: That liberated Buchenwald and I tried to tell -- tried to get him to talk to me, no. He\u2019s\nbusy right now, his wife had got cancer. But anyhow, yes and -- and while we were there,\nsome of the nurses from another unit put on a little skit. That\u2019s why I know it was the same\nboat that this friend of mine went on, because he was talking about the [indecipherable], I\ncan still see the girls up there singing, \u201cDon\u2019t Fence Me In.\u201d And they had big wings,\nsuppose -- supposed to be Air Corps wings on it, you know. And of course the Air Corps\nguys went ape over that. And so we had a good time and --",
        "A: Oh, this was in Buchenwald they went to .\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: A -- a unit replaced us when we left. The 58th field hospital replaced us. And I have no\nidea, you know, what happened then. That\u2019s why I was disappointed -- well, maybe Mike\nwould know, when he comes back with Bonnie because I\u2019m sure his outfit stayed there.",
        "A: Just before Christmas. Just before Christmas and we knew we were going to be away for\nChristmas, so all the nurses went into the PX and we all bought three gifts. Handkerchiefs\nor aftershave or a razor or something and wrapped it up for the enlisted men. And we had\nthat -- I think we bought an ornament, too. It seems to me we -- but we carried those. So\nwhen we got to England and course holly grows wild over there, so we had a ball cutting it\noff and trying to make our quarters a little bit more cheerful. And Christmas night we took\nall these -- grab gifts you\u2019d call them, but we thought it was something -- up to the enlisted\nmen\u2019s quarters and we all -- we\u2019re great singing group, not that I have a voice. I\u2019m losing\nwhat I have. But we sang all the time and I am sure the men got so sick of hearing us sing.\nAnd Ecky was one of the ringleaders, cause she ca -- has a voice. You know, all kinds of\nsongs. And we sang Christmas carols for the -- the enlisted men and gave them a little\npresent, so that made it a little nicer.",
        "A: Well -- well it was -- it was hard, this segregation thing, you know. And -- and I -- you\nknow, the -- the men thought of -- of the nurses as -- for the en -- for the officers only. We\nweren\u2019t supposed to fraternize with them. And how can you do that with somebody you\u2019re\nJuly 15, 1995\nworking with? I mean yo-you -- you had a little law and order, let\u2019s say, on the wards and\nstuff, but you still were friendly. Like one night at Christmas time, we had this house that\nwe turned into a sick bay, so anybody in the outfit, whether they were officer or enlisted\nmen was sick and needed care and stuff, were sent there. So, of course the nurses had to\nman it and one night we\u2019re sitting there and one of the GIs, the enlisted man who was taking\ncare of the fires -- each hou -- in England, each house -- room, has a little fireplace and\nGod, if you don\u2019t keep that going, you freeze to death. And he\u2019d go around -- and so we\u2019re\nsitting there and we\u2019re talking about Christmas back home and we\u2019re sad, you know. And\nthis guy says to me, \u201cBoy,\u201d he says, \u201cthere no -- no place like Christmas in the\nAdirondacks.\u201d Which is, you know, right up here. And I grew up in the Adirondacks,\nsummertime. And I said, \u201c\u201cWhereabouts in the Adirondacks?\u201d He says, \u201cSpeculator.\u201d And\nno one has ever heard of Speculator. Well, that\u2019s where I grew up. I -- off the bench\n[indecipherable] and I jumped in his lap and I\u2019m kissing him and going on. And the poor\nkid, he\u2019s scared to death, you know, what did I do wrong, you know, I\u2019m going to be court-\nmartialed. But I was so -- someone has heard of Spec. And then he said to me, \u201cYou know, I\nrecognized you, but I didn\u2019t recognize your name.\u201d And that\u2019s because I had my married\nname.",
        "A: But that was, you know, it --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, we just -- especially at Christmastime. And this boy happened to be\nJewish too, so that really didn\u2019t mean as much to him, but the fact that he was even near any\narea. You know, when you -- when you meet a soldier, \u201cWhere you from?\u201d Everyone know\nwa -- where you from. Most -- the Amer -- majority of our enlisted men were from\nOklahoma. A bunch of Okies. A few, like Mark, happened to be from New York, and we\nhad a few from Pennsylvania. Us girls -- most of us girls were from New York,\nPennsylvania and New Jersey. Our officers -- our doctors were mostly from Ohio,\nPennsylvania. And you know, so there were little areas. So you were always looking for\nsomeone who knew your hometown so you would have something to talk about and would\nremind you of home. And I -- and -- and -- you know, the -- especially the -- the fighting\nsoldiers, you know they were so glad to see somebody. First -- first you know, it was an\nAmerican voice that they want, oh, were so glad to see and then the American woman and\nthen, you know, where are you from? Where are you from? And if you were even two states\naway, you know, you were their sister. So --",
        "A: At that point, see, it was right at Christma -- I was in the operating room, so I really\ndidn\u2019t care for them. I saw them and saw their wounds and that\u2019s all I -- because they were\nin and out and -- and we had two tables going at the same time, 1n one room. And --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Well yeah, they had all sorts of inj -- in -- in the room I was in, 1t was an orthopedic\nroom, so it was either real brad -- bad fractures, some amputations, something like that. But\nthere were other rooms that had chest wounds and you know, abdominal. So they were, in a\nway, worse off, because it\u2019s a little easier to fix a bone than it 1s to fix a -- a shatter --",
        "A: You know, lung and stuff. So I really -- in fact I had to relieve one day in the -- 1n the\nchest surgery room and I oh, get me out of here. You know, I was scared.

        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s slower, because you know, most of the bleeding had already been under\ncontrol because it hadn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t just happen. But, you know, they were repairing\nwhat they could and even -- even that they would probably have to have more surgery when\nthey got back to the States, cause there were nerve damages done, which the -- I don\u2019t think\nthey would attempt to do there. But -- it\u2019s an awful thing to say, but it was good to take care\nof our -- our soldiers. And --",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what we were there for. And -- and when I was stationed in Atlantic City,\nthese soldiers were -- were all injured ones, but they were up and about on crutches and in\nwheelchairs and you know, slings and whatnot. So they were sick, yes, but they weren\u2019t sick\nthat way. Had a couple of real bad head injuries that upset me because they couldn\u2019t talk\nJuly 15, 1995\nand -- but they weren\u2019t fresh wounds and -- and in England was the first time I saw a fresh\nwound. And then in France we sat up -- set up the hospital in Fran-France, but we didn\u2019t\nhave any patients. It was like a dry run, cause that\u2019s the first time we had set up the tents.\nWe had to make sure all of our equipment worked. Trying out generators and dis -- water\ndistillers and autoclaves and -- and our -- all of our instruments were shipped over covered\nwith some sort of a grease or Vaseline or something. We had to clean all that off -- it was to\nprotect it, you know, from the salt water, I guess, whatever. And we cleaned the instruments\nand even made little -- some of the girls made soap -- hand soap, little -- little compartments\nfor some of the more delicate instruments, the -- you know, to protect them. And then we\nwent on to Germany, that was the first time we had -- had fresh patients.",
        "A: April, yeah. April, yeah.",
        "A: \u201845, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Or one -- our -- our very first load of patients was a -- a truck accident, the truck\nhad tipped over and a whole bunch were injured in that. In fact, we even had some German\nPOWs that had gotten injured and we treated those. But then there were -- the war was\nstarting to wane down, so the one -- that furious amount of accidents where a lot of mine --\nyou know, people walking into personnel mines and stuff like that. I remember -- and I can\u2019t\nremember wh-what happened to wa -- one night in the operating room, was this kid with\nJuly 15, 1995\nthis head wound and we had just set up the distilled water and it was -- the doctor yelled at\nme to get a pitcher of water and pour it out -- you know, to debride it, to get the dirt out.\nAnd I said, \u201cNo, the water\u2019s too hot.\u201d And he says, \u201cPour it.\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s too hot.\u201d He says,\n\u201cPour it, God damn it, pour it.\u201d And when I did I could see the kids toes jumping and oh, I -\n- I felt terrible. And he came later and --",
        "A: Well, yeah. Because the -- of the nerve reflex",
        "A: -- you know. And I felt terrible, I felt so bad. And he came to me later and apologized, he\nsays, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I shouldn\u2019t have questioned you.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have felt that.\u201d He said, \u201cThe damage that was in his brain,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cbut I had to\u201d -- you know. So that was one incident I remember.",
        "A: Yeah, well I think any operating room situation, even if you watch MASH, is tense\nwhile they\u2019re doing the operation. Once it\u2019s over, and it\u2019s -- I know on civilian -- cause I\nworked in civilian hospitals in the operating room -- once it\u2019s over, the laughter starts and\nthey ask how your golf game is or they\u2019Il start, hey did you hear this joke, you know. It\u2019s\nvery blas\u00e9. And I think there, too. Although they did things a lot faster. They had to move,\nkeep moving.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: There\u2019s another one waiting, yeah. We always had what we call a pre-op tent that came\nout this way and then the big operating room tent was this way and the pre-ops were in there\non the stretchers and --",
        "A: -- waiting.",
        "A: Yeah -- next, yeah -- next.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Some of it wasn\u2019t considered emergency, but it had -- it wasn\u2019t life or death -- some of\nthem weren\u2019t life or death, but they still needed attention and you took the first ones first,\nthat\u2019s triage. But --",
        "A: Ah, well yeah, and -- and -- and the nurse -- like Woody, she was head of the OR that I\nworked in. I don\u2019t know, cause I was in the operating room. Actually, I don\u2019t remember\nthose in the -- I know we had a sergeant who was in charge of the ward itself and he was an\nolder man, so whether he was -- you know, some -- the corpsman, God bless them, was a lot\nbetter than some of the nurses. They were great, really great.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh, that would be hard to tell because we moved so much. We moved an awful lot. He\njust couldn\u2019t keep up with -- the third army was moving through. And we weren\u2019t that busy.\nI can -- wards were never full, whether they shipped them back out faster -- like I said, the\nwar was waning down and they could get them moved out further -- they wanted to get\nthem to general hospitals as soon as they could. And then back home. So they -- we were\nnever out straight, I wouldn\u2019t say. In England yes. England was different. England was\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. One right after the other and at night time, you might be called out at\nnight. But, you know --",
        "A: Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, there was always this two team units or one --\nsomebody was always there to work the hospital, if some of us got to go to a -- a so-called\nparty, you know, as long as there was enough left to cover the hospital, that was okay. You\nknow, you could get leave to go. So --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Oh, actually -- yes, I suppose you\u2019d call it that. I was going to say we were always all on\nunless there was something doing, which wasn\u2019t that often. It sounds like we were just one\nbig party, but it certainly wasn\u2019t. And -- and we made -- made our own parties a lot of times.\nJust for something to do, something different.",
        "A: I think that\u2019s probably why we got along so well together, because you could always\nthink of something else to do.",
        "A: Well, if you had to, you know, you -- y-you sit in the tent and you might write letters or\nread books and somebody would come in and make a lot of noise and you\u2019d say, \u201cOh well,\nquiet down.\u201d And, you know, they realize, \u201cWell, maybe I should go out for a walk,\u201d and\nthen you\u2019d go out for a walk. And you couldn\u2019t walk far, cause you weren\u2019t allowed to go\ntoo far. So, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s funny, thinking back of -- we didn\u2019t take it lightly, but\nwe didn\u2019t let it get underneath, you know, let us get down. We -- we had a job to do, we\nwere there to do it.",
        "A: Well, I always wanted to go home. I know that when I was in Germany, I hated the\nGermans with a passion. Just hated them with a passion. And I -- I couldn\u2019t even be civil to\nthem when I would look at them. I\u2019ve changed since, believe me. Cause I\u2019ve been back and\nJuly 15, 1995\nfound the [indecipherable] people. But it was -- we were almost like cattle being led.\nYou\u2019re -- you\u2019re in the service, you\u2019re told when to get up and go to bed and when to eat\nand you didn\u2019t question what you were eating, you ate it. You went to work and you did\nyour job. And why am I here? Because I joined. I wasn\u2019t drafted, I joined. This is what I\nwant to do. I never thought of coming home as a -- it seemed to me that everybody in that\nera joined the service. So, it was the thing to do. You had to do it for your country. And we\nweren\u2019t doing it maybe we weren\u2019t doing it for the country per se, we were doing it for our\nmen, our fellow men. Fellow Americans. And that\u2019s what we wanted to do, that\u2019s why we\nwere all there, to help them over, cause they\u2019re the ones that did the dirty work.",
        "A: And we\u2019d tried to make it a little nicer, a little softer or healthier.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, I did, yeah. Wondered, you know? He used to have a -- on his dogtags he had\na little vial with my hair in it and he had said to me the last I saw him, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t ever\nbelieve I\u2019m dead unless you get this back.\u201d And course, I\u2019ve never gotten it back. But there\nwere -- I\u2019ve heard so many stories since, how -- must have been an awful job for these -- I\ndon\u2019t know what they call them, they had a name -- that buried the dead. And this\nespecially, in the Battle of Normandy, I heard this from one of the GIs, the -- the -- the --\nthe invasion of Normandy was so horrendous, that they had a truck of left arms and a truck\nof right arms and a truck of left legs and when they went to bury a body, if it was missing a\nleft leg, they went to that truck. So, you wonder. And even when I was in high school, my\nJuly 15, 1995\nchemistry teacher in high school was a doctor, a female doctor and she was a doctor in\nWorld War One. And she had all these slides to show us. They were slides of heart tissue\nand lung tissue and all sorts of tissues that she had taken out of World War One dead\nsoldiers. And she told us then -- and here we are, that\u2019s way back in the young -- late --\nearly 30\u2019s, that they stuffed them with straw and sent them home to be buried. So you\nwonder, you know, what came home. Maybe he\u2019s better over there, not knowing, you know.\nBlown to bits or something, I don\u2019t know. But that stuck and I -- I -- I can always remem -- I\ncan remember we had these seats in -- in hi -- in -- in -- in our chemistry lab that were two to\na desk, and I w -- I -- listening like this and all of a sudden I hear bump and the girl next to\nme fainted right out on -- of her seat. But I don\u2019t know if they could do that now. Maybe\nthey do, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t have been grieving. As -- now this 1s a -- a year later, for one thing. I was busy\ndoing my work. I thought of him, I car -- I still have the same picture I carried with him --\nwith his wings, and the last letter I wrote him, or he wrote me, excuse me, which was a V-\nmail letter, but they never photographed it. And I am curious to know why it was never\nphotographed, because they came all photographed, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with the\n-- well, V -- V mail, you would write on this certain paper, you could only have one sheet\nand they would photograph and put them into microfilm. And then they sent that microfilm.\nThey\u2019d get thousands and thousands of letters on this little spool of microfilm. And that\nJuly 15, 1995\nsaved hundreds of cubic feet in a cargo ship, sending all these letters back and forth. This\nletter, dated July, it looks like seven, but he made it an eight and he was missing on the 10th.\nAnd it says, \u201cI\u2019m going to be busy for awhi -- this\u2019Il probably be the last letter you get from\nme, cause I\u2019m going to by busy, but you\u2019!l hear about it soon enough.\u201d And that -- why\nwould they sent that handwritten, you know, piece, the original piece. So I still have that\nand his picture, which I carried all overseas with me and kept even when I remarried and my\nhusband knew it was in my drawer and it stayed there and it\u2019s still there.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, being a staunch Republican, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d Which is terrible. But\neveryone was stunned and you know, what\u2019s going to happen now? That, I think was the\nfirst concern about everybody, what\u2019s going to happen now. Because he certainly, you\nJuly 15, 1995\nknow, did give us good leadership. But then we heard about this guy named Truman and\nwent on with our work.",
        "A: It was VE Day. And I think I told you about stealing the denatured alcohol out of the\noperating room and --",
        "A: Oh, didn\u2019t I?",
        "A: We had what we call solution basins, they were little porcelain basins that we\u2019d soak\ninstruments in in alcohol and stuff and we swiped -- we had this denatured alcohol -- would\nkill you, you know, kill you. Put that in and we had powdered grape juice, it\u2019d turn it all\npurple. Whoosh, whoosh it around, whoosh it around. Oh.",
        "A: Terrible. And -- and -- our whole, Ecky was the only one that was sober that night and\nshe had these what we call number 10 cans. You know, peanut butter and jelly came in\nthem. She had one by each one of our bunks. Cause we would just roll out of bed and go\nnaa, you know -- couldn\u2019t get up. It\u2019s a wonder we didn\u2019t die.",
        "A: Well, not really, you know. We just -- just among ourselves, saying oh, you know,\nwhoopee do. Cause at that time we were right next to the 34th evacuation hospital. They had\nbrought us in and we were supposed to help them out or you know, relieve them of some of\nJuly 15, 1995\ntheir duties. They didn\u2019t like us and we didn\u2019t like them. And I think it was just a -- an ego\ntrip, you know? Maybe the nurses were afraid that we\u2019d infringe on their officers or\nwhatever, but we could care less, you know. We -- we were our own li -- we were very\ncliquey as you can notice and we were our own little establishment and so we did what we\nhad to do and they did what they had to do, until our men up and left us. And then we had to\nstay with the 34th, because they --",
        "A: Well, that was right after VE Day, maybe two days after, three days after, I\u2019m not sure\non what date. We were used to hearing our tents being pulled down, cause the hospital was\nalways moving. And one morning, there\u2019s the tents coming down. And they came and told\nus we had to move out of our tents, but we weren\u2019t going with them. And they had one big\ntent. So all of us 40 nurses were in this one big tent. We had to stay behind and we j -- we\njust felt so abandoned, because we\u2019d been a family for so long. How could you do this, you\nknow? \u201cWe\u2019re going on to Austria and you\u2019re staying here with the 34th.\u201d And oh, there\nwere tears, because we had some romances going on and you know, \u201cWe don\u2019t know. We\ndon\u2019t know nothing. You stay here, they\u2019ll feed you, you work with them and that\u2019s it.\u201d And\nsome of the girls were angry and some were sad and some were indignant because, \u201cHow\ncould they do this to us, you know, we\u2019re part of this unit and they\u2019re leaving us.\u201d But off\nthey went. And we didn\u2019t know why. And so we made hay, you know, we played around\nand make -- did what we had to do.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: We worked with the other unit. Not too much. They -- they were -- they were getting rid\nof -- their patients were being pushed out back to the general hospitals too. And I can\u2019t\nremember, except for just horsing around, like we found that old cart and we used to run\naround the place pulling this cart and --",
        "A: Well, it was -- I don\u2019t know wh -- maybe it was, but it was like a pushcart, but a big\npushcart. We\u2019d put two of the girls in it and two would pull it, you know and it was stupid,\nyou know, but it was silly. And I can remember sunbathing, we -- 1-it was -- it was getting,\nyou know, it was May then and it was -- it was getting warm and the -- the earth -- I -- I can\nstill smell the earth. The earth was very sour. We were set up in what might have been a\npasture or something and you don\u2019t realize, America here is a new country and our earth is\nstill new. But that\u2019s centuries old over there and it stunk. The earth was sour like -- like it\nwas moldy, but it had an o -- so when the sun hit it, o00. But anyhow, one morning, down\nthe dirt road comes our trucks, trumbling around and yea, tooting the horn, you know.\n\u201cPack your bags, girls, we\u2019re going.\u201d And you didn\u2019t see a happier bunch, you know. And\nin the trucks we went. One truck\u2019s for our bedrolls and two trucks for the nurses. And off\nwe went, singing all the way. And the tarp was down off of the trucks because it was nice\nweather. And we didn\u2019t even ask them, just went and sang and drove through the roads and\nthe countryside was so beautiful, the trollian houses with the flower boxes and all the\nflowers were starting to bloom. And then the -- we crossed the -- into Austria and you\nJuly 15, 1995\ncould see these -- these rolling Alps in the background, some still had snow on it. And it\nwas just ideal. We were in heaven, really in heaven.",
        "A: Yeah, the war was over and this was beautiful and serene and happy and what more\ncould you ask for? And there\u2019s the Danube and we crossed the Danube at Linz and I\nremember going across the bridge at Linz and the Danube and someone mentioned, \u201cThis\nis the city Hitler was born in. Linz, Austria, he was born here.\u201d \u201cSo? He ain\u2019t around any\nmore, we don\u2019t care.\u201d And we drove out, just through a corner of Linz itself and off we\nwent. All alongside the river we were driving. Just beautiful. Singing away, having a ball.",
        "A: Oh yeah, not even a whole day. Wasn\u2019t that long, I think we were not too far from the\nAus-Austrian border. And all of a sudden the singing stopped, one by one we stopped\nsinging. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. Something\u2019s wrong, what\u2019s wrong? I don\u2019t know, what\u2019s\nwrong? Something\u2019s the matter with the air.\u201d\u201d We didn\u2019t even see the place and we could\nsmell it. And the truck came down around the corner and there she was. This big, gray,\ngranite wall, with guardhouses every so often and barbed wire [inaudible] and we just --\nfirst your mouth would open and then your hand went over your mouth. And we drove up in\nfront of these huge gates.",
        "A: We drove up in front of these huge gates. And usually the enlisted men got right out of\nthe trucks and opened the tailgate for us, so we could get down. This time they didn\u2019t. The\nJuly 15, 1995\ngates were shut. And we just sat there, all with our hands over our mouth, eyes as big as\nsaucers. At that time we didn\u2019t see any bodies. There were a few -- I like to call them stick\nfigures. You know how you draw a stick figure? Their hips stuck out, their legs came down\nand this little ball on top for a head. A couple of them were walking around.",
        "A: No, inside, cause we were inside the -- the wall came around and then the -- the -- the big\ngate was in here on the -- on the block house. And some had striped uniforms on, some had\njust a blanket on them. Stark naked. Some had the blanket wrapped around their heads so\nyou wouldn\u2019t know who they were. They were afraid of being recognized, that\u2019s how --\nand, you know, \u201cWhat? What is this?\u201d And the other girls may have told you the same\nthing, our colonel came out and the first words out of his mouth were, \u201cThere are no\nAmericans here.\u201d Which would -- cause you didn\u2019t know what you were looking at. There\nwas no identification on them.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, we didn\u2019t know. You couldn\u2019t tell. Just a -- so then he started his little spiel about,\n\u201cYou girls were not sent over here to do this work, you girls were not trained to do this\nwork. You girls were not -- are not equipped to do this work. And I will not order any one\nof you in this camp.\u201d He was visibly upset and I personally think that he had grandiose\nJuly 15, 1995\nplans of -- for himself, being in some nice hospital, doing some great deeds. I don\u2019t know,\nthat\u2019s my personal opinion.",
        "A: Commanding officer.",
        "A: Colonel Dale Friend. Who has -- was quite a researcher at Peter Bent Brigham\nHospital in Boston. But -- so after he gave his spiel, the GIs let down those tailgates and we\njumped out, two oh one. Everyone of them. And I think he was shocked that we all\nresponded in that way, cause he just stood there. \u201cNow wait a minute,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s\ngoing to be rules and regulations.\u201d Or words to that effect. \u201c\u201cYou can\u2019t be here after dark,\nyou can\u2019t be here by yourself. At all times you\u2019re with another person, even in the wards.\nYou have to be completely covered. I don\u2019t want them to even know you\u2019re f -- a female.\u201d\nYeah, supposed to wear a -- the turbans and masks over our face. Our -- our dungarees that\nwe had. Little puttees around our ankles and our boots.",
        "A: Puttees are actually left over from World War One. They\u2019re a canvas, like a ski sock and\nthey -- and they buckle across, so they keep your pants into your boots, because of course,\ntyphus was such a rage there, anything get up your pants and you\u2019ve had it. So -- although\nwe'd all been inoculated. So, with that, you know, they -- they took us to our -- our nurses\nquarters, cause we didn\u2019t go right into the camp itself then. And -- which was nice, it was\nthe first time we had a nice hou -- we had three nice house -- I think there were three, yeah.\nJuly 15, 1995\nThree nice houses up on top of a hill, overlooking the Danube. Couldn\u2019t have been better.\nAnd these German girls all -- you know, I do -- I do -- can I do -- can I do, you know, and\nthey couldn\u2019t do -- like, one of the girls was saying today, you remember you put down --\nyou put down your -- your panties and they\u2019d snatch them up and go wash them. You put\nthem -- take them out to put them on, they\u2019re gone, she\u2019s out there washing them. They\ncouldn\u2019t --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. They couldn\u2019t do enough for you. And I -- still having this hatred in me, I --\nyou know, who you trying to kid, you know? Which side were you on, you know? Now,\nyou\u2019re tone -- turncoat? I -- I didn\u2019t trust anybody that was like that. I -- I really couldn\u2019t. I\nfigured, last week you were doing that for the Germans. But anyhow, th-they were victims.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t be surprised, you know?",
        "A: And there again, it\u2019s survival. A sense of survival. Just like the poor inmates in the camp.\nWhy did this one live and thousands other die? They had a survival. And I\u2019m sure a lot of\nthem must have had a guilty complex going home. Especially if their whole family died.\nJuly 15, 1995\nWhy did he live? That\u2019s -- you know, I would -- I would have no idea what that feeling is\nlike, but I imagine there must be a lot that -- that have that feeling.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah the trucks would always take -- we couldn\u2019t walk. We were in -- supposed to\nbe walking outside the areas, because you didn\u2019t know what was out there. The trucks\nwould bring us down to the camp and we would work and eat and they would take us back\nto quarters and we stayed there.",
        "A: Was Camp Gusen, which was a satellite of Mauthausen. Mauthausen was up on the\nhill and they brought down -- well, Gusen enough -- had enough of it\u2019s own patients, but\nsome of the patients from Mauthausen, because there was no medical facilities up there.\nAnd our wards were set up, they must have told you, in former SS barracks. But we used the\nsame -- I guess you\u2019d call it the same three tiered bunks, for the inmates, except there was\nonly one in each bunk instead of three or four. And they had beds of straw, because I, you\nknow, I never questioned, when I was there, where\u2019d all these blankets come from? Or\nwhere\u2019d these pajamas come from? And evidently they must have flown them in and it\nwasn\u2019t -- this Mike Wordell, who I\u2019d wanted to come, he told me -- and I didn\u2019t realize it at\nthe time, there were two units that were sent in, which were called delousing units. That\u2019s\nall they did. And they were behind the walls, delou -- cause these guys all -- pa -- inmates,\nJuly 15, 1995\npatients, whatever you want to call them, had to be completely deloused before they were\nbrought out to us.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, before we arrived. And then -- and while we were there, because as we\nwould have, say eight deaths a night, we\u2019d have eight -- eight empty beds, they\u2019d bring out -\n- but they were -- they were doing this behind the wall. Washing them down and delousing\nthem and giving them either a blanket or pajamas, whatever was flown in. And I didn\u2019t\nknow about that, I didn\u2019t even question, \u201cWhere 1s this all coming?\u201d I should have said,\n\u201cHow come?\u201d You know?",
        "A: We\u2019d come in -- into the same ward, yeah.",
        "A: I would say at least 100, but I am not sure. 120 - 140, I\u2019m not sure. Rooms on both sides\nand they were big, big rooms. And --",
        "A: Big hallway and open door here and an open door at the other end, so that you could --\nthe hallway itself was very dark, but you could see light at the end of the tunnel. And I -- I\nlike to think of that, yes there is a light at the end of the tunnel. One of -- and I think I told\nyou that we were not allowed to have any physical contact with the patients. We could not --\ninmates, whatever you want to call them. We were not allowed to give them nursing care.\nThey brought in either prisoners of war -- German prisoners of war or people from the\nJuly 15, 1995\ncommunity. Went out in trucks and rounded them up and they stayed there for the day, fed,\nwashed and cleaned. These guys did what they could.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t touch them. We weren\u2019t allowed to touch them. The only thing we did was\ngive them medication.",
        "A: Every day. Those that needed. We learned the word diarrhea in three languages and I\u2019m\nnot sure that I can even say the -- the names today and I\u2019m sure they would too, because one\nwas Russian, one was Polish and one was, I guess French, because we had a very sweet\nFrenchman who spoke beautiful English. And whatever we were saying, he says, \u201cSister,\u201d\ncause they call the nurses sister, \u201cdon\u2019t say\u201d -- and I think we were -- I forget the word we\nwere saying, but -- excuse me, but we were saying shits. And he wanted -- he said, \u201cIt\u2019s\ndeeareeah. That\u2019s not nice,\u201d he said. Cause we\u2019d stand at the -- at the door and yell out these\nthree words and those who had diarrhea, would raise their little old hand up, you know and\nwe'd go over and we\u2019d give them their medicine.",
        "A: That\u2019s -- that\u2019s the only way. I don\u2019t think we kept any records. Maybe number wise, I --\nthings like that I don\u2019t remember. I know we didn\u2019t keep records, cause we didn\u2019t know\ntheir names. Towards the end of our stay there, things seemed to ease -- you know, maybe\nbecause we\u2019d been there long enough to not be so tense, that we were able to talk to some of\nthe patients through an interpreter. And I got a couple of names that I wrote to their -- one\nJuly 15, 1995\nwas a sister back in the States and one was some other kind of a relative. To tell them, you\nknow, they\u2019re begging, \u201cT-Tell America I\u2019m here,\u201d you know. And at that time you\ncouldn\u2019t say exactly where they were, you know, just someplace in Austria was the term\nyou had to use. A-And you couldn\u2019t say exactly what their condition was. When I got back\nto the States and I must have given my address back at the States, I got a letter from one\nwoman in Evanston, Illinois and she had gotten my letter and sent me a check for 50\ndollars, to do something for her brother, it was her brother. And so by this time I\u2019m back in\nthe States, so I wrote back to her exactly where he was, exactly his condition and sent her\nback the 50 dollars. Hopefully he was still alive. And I said, \u201cContact your Red Cross. Now\nyou know exactly where he was. Whether he\u2019s still there now, I don\u2019t know.\u201d I never heard\nfrom the other one that I wrote from, but -- to -- so I -- you know, sometimes I think -- I\nwonder how he made out. Did he make it out of there, did he make it to America. So --",
        "A: Some of the -- some of them. Not very many. Our -- our corpsman happened to be a\ngreat guy. He was -- I think he was Mexican and he spoke Spanish fluently and he could\nspeak a few words of German or Polish, whatever it was. And he was able to -- well, this,\nyou know and then you could do with hand signals, too, you know and there wasn\u2019t much\nyou could talk to them about. They were too weak for one thing. I don\u2019t know if I told you\nthe -- an-and Ecky knows I will tell you the story where we weren\u2019t supposed to look like\nwomen and like I told you, we used to give out these medicines together and she\u2019d give the\nJuly 15, 1995\npills and I\u2019d be behind her with a bottle of whatever it was I had to pour out and give it to\nthem. And I\u2019m waiting for her, she\u2019s bending over, giving this guy his pills. And out from\nthe other bunk comes this little bony hand and pats her on the fanny. And I\u2019m standing there\n-- not laughing out loud, but saying, \u201cThere\u2019s hope for them after all. There\u2019s still life in\nthem,\u201d you know, really -- which you -- and of course, she didn\u2019t even feel it, it was so\nweak. And when she stood up and I\u2019m -- and I says, \u201cWho we kidding? They know who we\nare.\u201d You know and she\u2019s, \u201cWhy?\u201d And I -- I get tears. I can still see him now, doing that. It\nwas -- it was cute. It was pathetic that 1t was cute.",
        "A: Oh, I think there were -- I -- I -- I would -- I couldn\u2019t swear, but I would say I thought\nmost of them were Jewish.",
        "A: Yeah. But we had Frenchmen. We had one Spanish guy who worked on the ward. He\nwas another one I didn\u2019t trust, cause he was a -- a -- a trustee for the Germans. And he was -\n- looked well preserved. And he had been in the Spanish revolution and had gotten caught\nsomehow and you know, and the Germans helped them out. Roberto his name was. But he\nhelped us out. But these people, no, we didn\u2019t know who they were. Had no idea. There was\neven Russians there too, I think.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: It must have helped a little bit, but 1t was like swimming upstream. You made a little\nprogress, but not much, you know. You nourished them, but you had to start out with, you\nknow -- thin, thin soup, because you couldn\u2019t give them food, per se. And just the thought\nthat they were free, you know, must have been something.",
        "A: And I\u2019m sure, you know, I see pictures of these survivors now for the ho -- in the\nHolocaust and God, they look great. So they -- you know, they -- life does -- you know, the\nbody does improve.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. That they interview on TV and you would say n -- look at them. You\ncouldn\u2019t have been in a concentration camp, but you know. You know yourself, if\nsomeone\u2019s really sick and loses a lot of weight, gets better, they do come back, but -- the\nbody is a wonderful machine. So -- it\u2019s too bad it gets abused.",
        "A: I would s -- I think about five weeks we were there, because we left to go home, either --\nit was either on my birthday or the day after. It was either June 21st or 22nd, I remember.\nMy birthday.",
        "A: I think probably a week\u2019s notice, yeah.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Well, the -- the attitude was better, you know. It wa -- it was a lot more relaxed, because\nwe went in there with -- so tight and so tense and you were all literally afraid of them,\nbecause, you know, they were so riddled with disease and hey, you know, you\u2019re protected.\nAnd --",
        "A: Well, as far as we -- now, they\u2019re talking about the DDT, which you heard about. The --\nyou know, several of our nurses have developed breast cancer. But, with the ratio of breast\ncancer today, I -- I can\u2019t see blaming it on the DDT that we had --",
        "A: Every day, yeah. Down our pants, up our arms and in the back of our necks. She had an\nold flint gun, I don\u2019t know if you know what a flint gun it. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a ca -- a canister on\nthe end of a sh-sh-sh pump thing. And I think flit they used to use for flies or mosquitoes or\nsomething. You\u2019d fill this canister with whatever and that was filled with DDT powder.\nAnd we\u2019d stand in front of our chief nurse and pull our pants out. How degrading, when you\nthink of it. But that\u2019s how we had to go on. The first couple of days that we worked at the\ncamp, we felt so bad, so dirty, so contaminated, that we would come back to our nurses\nquarters and literally strip, outside the door and just drop our drawers right there and these\nnice German girls would grab them and wash them for us, cause we didn\u2019t want to go in the\nJuly 15, 1995\nhouse with this aroma around us. You know, and -- and that odor clung to you -- your\nclothes after awhile, too. So -- and after awhile you didn\u2019t notice it.",
        "A: Well, I know they got musical instruments for some of the inmates that were musically\ninclined. I don\u2019t know where they came from. I imagine they just walked into somebody\u2019s\nhouse and took them. That\u2019s what they usually did. This Jeannie Striker that I gave you her\n-- her papers, she worked with the women. Now, I never saw the women. I knew they were\nthere, but I never saw them. Some of the men went in town and got bolts of material and\nbrought it out to the women and she said they practically clawed at the material, they\ncouldn\u2019t wait to get a piece of it, to make themselves, you know, a top or a -- you know, a\nmuumuu type dress or shorts or something, something to put on their bodies. And -- but\nthat\u2019s the only story I ever heard from her from the women.",
        "A: I never saw a child, no. Thank God.",
        "A: Yeah, but, you know, there were all grades of degration or something. I don\u2019t know\nwhat you want to call it. There were some that could not move at all and some that walked\naround. And yes, they could play a violin. Maybe not as well as they did in days gone by.\nAnd the spirit is always there, I guess, if you\u2019re a musician. I\u2019m not. But --\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: Mm-mm, mm-mm.",
        "A: Not as far as I know. It wasn\u2019t at that time, anyhow. And we were the 131st evacuation\nhospital at Gusen.",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "A: Mm-mm. We had more than we could take care of.",
        "A: Oh, someone at one time told me there were four -- we had 4000 pa -- we were a 400 bed\nhospital, originally, this little tent hospital -- and that we had 4000 patients. But there were,\naccording to that confession, there were what, 60,00 inmates there? So that\u2019s just a drop in\nthe bucket.",
        "A: I never got up there and you had to have -- you had to know somebody to get up there,\nbecause that was off limits as far as I know. I did get in -- behind the camp there was this\nnice, rolling hill and I did get back there and inside that hill was a complete factory --\nrailroad tracks and everything. And I was told they were making Mezzerschmidts planes in\nthere. In fact I brought home a piece of -- still have it -- piece of balsa wood that was\npainted like a -- a dark, dark olive green and you can just about see a swastika on it. And\nJuly 15, 1995\nsomeone else told me it was a news -- news -- ammunition place and this Mike that I talked\nto on the phone, who didn\u2019t make it here, that was our interpreter, he claims that they were\nmaking parts for the V2 bombs there. But it was a complete factory back there, all\nunderground in a bi -- big cavern. And when I went back to Germany and Austria years\nlater with my daughters and I -- we were in Strasbourg, that was as far as we were -- we\nwere going to go. I said, \u201cHey, we have enough time to go to Linz.\u201d And my daughter, at\nthis time, she was doing all the driving. \u201cOh Ma, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo,\u201d and I just,\nby my nose, crossed the bridge, turned right, follow the river. And she said, \u201cDo you know\nwhere you\u2019re going?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, but it\u2019s in this direction.\u201d Oh, and she was getting so\nupset with me. You know, it\u2019s like looking for a needle in a haystack. And I said, \u201cSlow\ndown.\u201d In the -- over on the horizon, I saw that same hill. I says, \u201cWe\u2019re coming there, we --\nI know we\u2019re coming there.\u201d And there it was.",
        "A: The camp. TV antennas out of what was our wards, lace curtains, flower boxes.",
        "A: Oh, painted white and beautiful. I have pictures downstairs, Ill have to show you. They\nhad -- just before you got to the camp, there was a -- a memorial to the camp built. And it\nwas like a -- a maze and you went ar -- and there were all pictures and sayings all around\nthis cement wall right in the center, where the ovens -- but it was locked, you couldn\u2019t get\nin. So I went -- there was a little, like I call it a 7-11 Store next door. By this time my\ndaughter\u2019s really mad at me. So I went next door and I -- you know, we wanted the key to\nJuly 15, 1995\nget in there. Oh, hese wasa sloe shanol. He couldn\u2019t speak English, I couldn\u2019t speak\nGerman and he was very upset that I wanted to get in there.",
        "A: In -- into this little maze, see, it was locked. There was a padlock on it. And I say, I want\nto get -- and he was upset, he was visibly upset. And I didn\u2019t know what he was saying, he\ndidn\u2019t know what I was saying. So finally I\u2019m going -- cause we all wore the Red Cross on\nour sleeve. \u201cBoom, boom, cranksfester.\u201d And that\u2019s what I thought was nurse in -- in\nGerman. Boom, boom. All of a sudden he got the message and he -- his wife comes out with\nwine and cheese and they\u2019re hugging me and kissing me and my daughter\u2019s standing there\nlike this. She was so mad. He come over and opened up the gate and oh, oh, oh -- couldn\u2019t\ndo enough for me. So, you know, I walked all the way around in -- inside with the ovens\nthey had. I\u2019ve got pictures downstairs in my album, Ill have to show you.",
        "A: Well it -- th-they had taken the ovens out of -- you know, where the crematorium was in\nbehind that -- that\u2019s another story that -- where I\u2019m telling you the -- the barracks were made\nup like nice houses with TV antennas. And then there\u2019s the big block house, which had the\nbig gates in it and those -- it was all boarded over, the gates had been removed to\nsomeplace. Maybe -- maybe they were in the maze, I forget. But we drove up on top of the\nquarry, which is famous for those last steps and looked down into what was the big\ncompound. Course all those barracks were blown up and burnt down. Guess what they were\nusing it for? They made tombstones there.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: [inaudible] all these beautiful carved --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I\u2019m losing [inaudible]",

        "A: Well we -- we have the picture that the -- our chaplain gave us of the steps, they call\nthem the steps of death, and --",
        "A: They were just granite. Everything that Mauthausen and Gusen was built at were huge\nblocks of granite and it all came from that quarry. And they\u2019re still using the quarry to make\ntombstones. But I drove down there once, I must have had a date with somebody that had a\nJeep and it was weird, you know, these -- you -- like in a -- almost in the Grand Canyon,\nthese walls and walls of rock, you know. And I saw the steps and that was all and I wanted\nto get out of there, cause it was eerie.\nJuly 15, 1995",
        "A: No, th-they came out of the quarry and they -- they must have built these steps cause they\nwere also of these big blacks of -- blocks of granite and then there\u2019s a big wall to one side,\nin fact other side of the steps, that they must have built as they went up. And when they got\nto the very top, I don\u2019t know what was up there, more for maybe trucks or something to take\nthese blocks or quarries -- o-of granite someplace else. But it was eerie. And then to drive\nup there 20 years -- was it 20 le -- years later? Hm. Must have been more than that. But to\nlook down and see all of these tombstones down there in that compound, I thought, \u201cYou\nson of a gun.\u201d So somebody\u2019s making a good business. So -- even the roadblocks, there was\na roadblock between our quarters and Gusen, that of course had been discombobulated for\nus to go through, but that was built of big blocks of this quarry.",
        "A: June.",
        "A: Mi-Middle of June we left Gusen.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: We went back to France, by -- this time we went by train. The nurses and the officers\nwere in first class cars and the men were in horse cattles. Again, segregation. And every so\noften the train would stop and they would say, nurses, we -- we\u2019re not to look out to the side\nJuly 15, 1995\nbecause the men were all having their relief break. And the -- the train would stop and start\nbecause the tracks were, you know, in repair or -- you know. It was -- it was a -- seemed to\nme a long ride to where we got. Then there were trucks that took us first to -- I f -- I think\nthey took us first to what we call Camp 20 grand. They had all these little like reppo-\ndeppo\u2019s, which were replacement depots for different units and they were named after\ncigarettes. First we went to Camp 20 grand, then we went to Camp Lucky Strike, which was\ngreat. It was up on top of a hill, overlooking the -- the Seine in -- in France, except this was\njust a huge rockpile. There again, we had to live in tents again. They were pitched on these\nrocks and we had to wash our hair out of tin cans and we had a good mess hall, which was\nrun by the German POWs. And they would be quite fresh to us, but sometimes they\u2019d say,\n\u201cNo sugar today for your coffee. No sugar today. No sugar today for your coffee.\u201d Well, I\ndon\u2019t take sugar in my coffee, it didn\u2019t bother me. The other girls -- at night they\u2019d have\nsugar cookies they\u2019d make for us. You know, they\u2019d try to make up, you know, they -- they\nwould do this on purpose to make something nice for us. So th-they were also trying to be\nnice. See, I\u2019m still -- had this distrust of the people. And -- I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t like anyone\nthat got too familiar. And we finally found out they had a ship, we were going home. We\nhad our footlockers all packed and away they went and they went down to the harbor and\nsomebody\u2019s packing the -- the -- and they -- course they were all stenciled with our names.\n\u2018\u201cWho\u2019s this Mary? Females? No way. Unload, unload,\u201d and the poor GIs, just cause we\nwere females, our men couldn\u2019t go either. So they --\nJuly 15, 1995",

And it was great, you\nknow, when the boats were out there and welcoming -- and bands were in the boats and\nfrom there we went to -- in fact, w-we -- I remember it was the fish pier in -- in Boston,\nJuly 15, 1995\nwhich 1s still there and we got on trains that were right there at the fish pier and they took us\ndown to Camp Miles Standish, on the Cape. Not quite too far down on the Cape, but some\npart on the Cape. It\u2019s now a big campground, I guess. And they were great. They had -- you\nknow, welcome home and we slept in -- like it was a huge ward, so we were all together, but\nthere were sheets, the first time we\u2019d had sheets 1n -- oh, months and months and months,\nwe haven\u2019t had a sheet. And it was great. I remember calling my mother, cause you could\ncall whoever you want to call and they had the -- papers had a habit of printing what units\nwere landing when and where and she had seen in the paper that the 131st was coming into\nNew York Harbor at such and such a date. Well, that must have been the first boat that they\nwere loading our stuff on. So she says, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d I said, \u201cUp in Massachusetts\nsomeplace, Camp Miles Stand,\u201d -- \u201cYou get right home here.\u201d I said, \u201cHuh? I can\u2019t.

If you were married -- not a widow, but if you were married, if you\u2019d\nbeen in the service so long, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, you could be discharged. And we had\nseven discharged from Camp Polk. Another gal and I got orders to go to San Antone,\nTexas. Fort Sam Houston, which 1s a huge hospital. When I got down there, hadn\u2019t worked\non a ward, didn\u2019t know what to do. Didn\u2019t know how to do anything, actually. Hadn\u2019t\nworked -- how to make a bed, even.
