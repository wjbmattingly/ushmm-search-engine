And then he -- oh, he -- when he was\nworking as a machine operator, he worked Saturdays as a shoe salesman in a department\nstore in downtown Chicago.

        "Q: Well, that's what I'm curious about. Did you open a newspaper and that's how you\nlearned about it or did someone tell you, run up to you and say hey, this is what just\nhappened? Do you recall how you heard about it first?",

And but when I started college -- oh, before I\nstarted college, I had a high school guidance counselor and she gave me some tests,\nvocational interests and other things and I was so impressed with her job and her, her\nfunction that I decided that I wanted to be that. So when I started college, I told them I\nwanted to be a guidance counselor. I wanted vocational guidance as my major.",
        "Q: Now, what was --",
        "A: And they said --",
        "Q: Yeah \u2014",

        "Q: Oh, I'm sorry, confusing everyone?",
        "A: My father was -- was --",

When I got out of the Army,\nmy first -- When I got out of the Army, I went to Stanford. That was the school I was\nalways interested in. So I went to Stanford. I went to Berkeley for the first summer. And\nthey moved to Berkeley because her sister, Ester, lived in Berkeley. By the way, the three\nsisters each had only children -- each had only one.",
        "Q: Really? What a coincidence.",
        "A: And one, Ester's and Bernard's son was a physicist and Sophie and Saul's son --\ndaughter was a lawyer.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And so, my parents moved to Berkeley and all the time that I went through Stanford.\nAnd then I moved to Ann Arbor after that, they stayed in Berkeley. Then I moved to\nBaltimore and they moved to Baltimore.",
        "Q: Now, was this because your family was a --",
        "A: And he was -- When he lived in Berkeley, he sold shoes in San Francisco at the major\nshoe store in San Francisco, I can't remember the name of it. And then in Baltimore he\nworked selling shoes.",
        "Q: Well, it seems to me that your parents are moving from town to town to be along with\nyou. Was this --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- I'm guessing, this was kind of unusual that the nuclear family would stay together\neven after the child is an adult? Was this unusual?",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "Q: Oh?",
        "A: Probably.",
        "Q: Was there something about your family that made them more tight knit than usual?",
        "A: Well, they didn't have anybody else. They just only had one child, so.",
        "Q: Did they have a social group of their own? Did they have people that they would go to\ndinner or have a card game or --",
        "A: No, not much.",
        "Q: -- tea?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So there weren't people, guests, in the house when you were growing up?",
        "A: No. Well, my grandfather lived with us for a while. And then when we had a -- when\nwe had the two bedroom apartment, we had a roomer. We had a grocery store owner who\n-- who lived with us.",
        "Q: Really? So he was renting out the -- the room?",
        "A: The room. So I always slept in the living room.",

        "A: Later. What happened was, my parents got a bigger apartment. In order to rent a\nroom to a distant cousin, a woman and her daughter. So they lived with us and they \u2014 we\nhad a piano. We had an upright piano. I don't know if my parents --",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: -- got it or because I know that my cousin Pat, Pearl was her name; Pat, they changed\nit to Pat. She took piano lessons and then I did too. So, we were both taking piano\nlessons.",
        "Q: Okay. So this -- this piano in your home, when was this? How old were you?",
        "A: Oh, probably 10; 10, 12; 10, 12 to 14, something like that.",
        "Q: And did you play any other instruments?",
        "A: Yeah, I played e flat alto clarinet in the high school -- in the high school concert band.\nAnd I played snare drum in a marching band, a marching drum and bugle corps.",
        "Q: So, you said that you did not have your own room growing up but you were playing\nall of these instruments. Clearly some of them at school. But was that not an issue that\nyou had to practice an instrument and you didn't have your own area?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It wasn't imposing on other people?",
        "A: No.",

        "A: Radio.",
        "Q: So -- so there was no gramophone or record or?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay. So what -- If I understand correctly, you were not drafted; you volunteered?",

        "Q: '43? So would that have been when you volunteered for the Army?",
        "A: No.No, I went in in '43. I went into the Army in '43.",

        "Q: And you actually went in in '43?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So what caused the delay?",
        "A: I -- I enlisted in a program called the ASTP, Army Specialized Training Program;\nmillions of guys did this. And it was -- it was a way to continue college until, I think, the\nend of the academic year and -- and not go right away. So if you enlisted, you could\ncontinue college if you were --",
        "Q: -- already in college?",
        "A: -- in a field. If you were already in and you were in a field that they considered a\nspecialized field.",
        "Q: And this was one such field?",
        "A: Yeah, right. So, I went in and was in college but then I-- I don't remember exactly why\nI got impatient and instead of staying, I -- at the end of that -- of that -- of that year, that\nSpring of '43 I think, I asked to -- to go.",
        "Q: Now --",
        "A: And not continue in ASTP.",

        "A: Until graduation.",
        "Q: Until graduation?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Now, what was your motivation to enlist to volunteer?",
        "A: I was so interested in personnel administration and industrial psychology that I\nthought that I could do it in the Army. And so I asked to -- to go.",
        "Q: Did someone, some kind of advisor, confirm that that was an option that they would\nbe able to do this or this was just your own idea?",
        "A: No, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So I went in the Army and -- and I was -- I went to infantry basic training which --",
        "Q: Where?",
        "A: It was North Camp Hood, Texas; which now is Fort Hood. And it was rough and it\nwas -- there was no running -- there was no plumbing and there were lister bags for\nwater.",
        "Q: What's a lister bag?",
        "A: A lister bag is a water holder. It's a big -- it's a big bag with a faucet at the end of it.",
        "Q: So you're saying there is no plumbing? How -- how did you and other guys clean\nthemselves?",
        "A: No, I think there -- there were showers but there \u2014",
        "Q: There were showers?",
        "A: -- but there was no water pumps or anything else. I know we were always short of\nwater. Basic training started on the 4th of July in Texas.",
        "Q: Of '43?",
        "A: Yeah, it was really rough.",
        "Q: Can you describe what kind of -- what kind of regiment you had? What you had to do\nin a day?",
        "A: Well, all of the usual military training things.",
        "Q: How physical would it have been?",
        "A: And ending in a 25-mile hike.",
        "Q: 25-mile hike?",
        "A: Ina full -- full field pack hike. And there was also crawling under machine gun fire,\nthe obstacle course, and -- and just and listening to lectures.",
        "Q: Lectures on what?",
        "A: Military, you know, arms like --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",

        "A: That was okay.",
        "Q: They were --",
        "A: They were worried.",
        "Q: -- supportive?",
        "A: Well, they were worried about me in the service but -- but they were supportive, yeah.",
        "Q: How many of your -- your friends or acquaintances were doing the same at the time?",
        "A: Well, some were drafted and I don't know whether anybody else was doing what I did.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In basic training, were you the only Jewish person there in your unit?",
        "A: I think there were one or two others. You know, I should say before I forget that, I'm\njumping the gun here, though.",
        "Q: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "A: I was hoping that I would be assigned to personnel or classification because that's\nwhat -- that's what I wanted. And at the end of basic, they did put me in the camp office\nin classification which is what I liked.",
        "Q: How much time was there between the beginning and the end of basics?",
        "A: Well, basic training was 13-weeks at that time.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Well, I did work in the office for a little while and I thought I had it all made and that I\nwas part of the camp and I wasn't shipped out. And then orders came through. I guess\nwhat happened was that the Army needed more troops and more combat troops so the\norder came in closing or -- or changing our office.",
        "Q: How much time did you spend in the office before that order came through?",
        "A: I don't think it was more than a month or two.",
        "Q: Okay. So we're still in '43?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So then -- So, I was shipped out and along with maybe one or two other people that's\nall.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And so I was shipped out to a the 71st Light Division which was jungle and mountain.\nAnd that was at Camp Carson Colorado. And that was in preparation for Asia.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. What kind of training was that?",
        "A: That was also rough and it was -- there was a maneuvers there -- in the -- it was\nraining and -- and there we had no light -- light infantry means this was a mule pack\noutfit. There was -- there were three light divisions: The 89th, the 14th, and the 5th. I was\nin the 5th, regiments, pardon me.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The 5 regiment and the 14th and the 66th. And --",
        "Q: You said something mule. What was the expression you used?",
        "A: Oh, mule. Mule pack.",
        "Q: What is that?",
        "A: Mules like our outfit was just backpacks and carts I think pulling, pull-carts,\nbackpacks. And another Light Division was all mules.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So -- so what is all mules? You said you were carts and backpacks?",
        "A: Mules. Yeah, we were backpacks and something else, I forgot. Light, meaning that\nyou could go without cannon.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Without tanks.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Without heavy trucks and stuff like that. So it was all on foot. But I think we had a\nkind of a cart. But another division was all mule packs.",
        "Q: So what is a mule pack?",
        "A: A mule is -- is a donkey.",
        "Q: Oh, so these are actually mules?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I thought it was maybe a code for some kind of --",
        "A: No, no they were --",
        "Q: Mules.",
        "A: -- mules. They had mules that carried --",
        "Q: So they had mules with them?",
        "A: And they would carry things.",
        "Q: I see. I see. But you were not in that division?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay. Now, given that you had --",
        "A: But I -- I -- I --",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: -- want to say that by volunteering and going into that --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- then I was just in the infantry and I was -- I was in the -- in the mud.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: One day a guy from headquarters that I knew was a friend of mine saw me in a\nfoxhole in the rain and he said Les, is that you? And he said considering your\nbackground, let's see what we can do. And so he got them to -- to think of me for -- for\nService Company, which would be classification.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So then later, when I was in classification, I was in charge of getting the new men\ncoming into the outfit into their units. Well the new men coming into the outfit, by then I\nwas a corporal, the new men coming into the outfit were buck privates and they were --\nthey were raw like raw recruits.",
        "Q: Recruits.",
        "A: Because they had just come from ASTP. ASTP ended.",
        "Q: I see. So it would have been your cohort?",
        "A: And they were all shipped out of college. So I, you know, had the advantage.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. This, this man who you knew, a friend of yours, do you remember his name\u2019?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Do you remember where you knew him from?",
        "A: From the Army itself. From just --",
        "Q: But from Colorado or maybe had you been together in Texas or?",
        "A: No, I think it was Colorado.",
        "Q: And so, during this whole process you said that maybe there was one other Jewish\nperson there. Was -- Did the other --",
        "A: There was one Jewish guy who was the newspaper reporter. His name was Irving\nWerstein. I remember him.",
        "Q: Did the other men in this unit know that you were Jewish?",
        "A: The 5th Regiment was originally in Panama in peacetime and most of the people in it\nwere from Kentucky and Tennessee and they were hillbilly types.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And they didn't -- they didn't know much about that. About Jewish or whatever.",
        "Q: So they would not have been aware?",
        "A: No, I think there was some anti-Semitism from somewhere but it wasn't -- it wasn't so\nmuch Jewish as it was city and college.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And you had both? You had been a college boy and a city boy?",
        "A: Uh-huh, right.",
        "Q: Was this an issue? Did they make it an issue?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, because they were in much better shape. I mean, they were more used to\nthat kind of life than I was.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did they taunt you or did they treat you badly?",
        "A: Well, I remember one day I was huffing and puffing climbing a mountain and I said,\nI'm not used to this. I said, I grew up in Chicago where -- where I'm used to escalators\nand elevators.",
        "Q: What did they say?",
        "A: So, so he laughed. But later that night around the campfire, he told the other guys what\nI said and they in a taunting, teasing, hostile way. So I...",
        "Q: But this -- this didn't escalate? They didn't actually hurt you or?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: There was no -- They didn't isolate you for being different?",
        "A: No, I think I was closer to a couple of guys that were more city.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That we were different from the -- from everybody else.",
        "Q: And you had your own support group then?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now given that you had had very different ideas about what was going to happen\nbefore you got the desk job, before your friend finds you in the foxhole, so during those\nmonths, how are you coping with the disappointment? Is it a disappointment?",
        "A: It wasn't. I mean, I just took it as life; something to cope with. I didn't -- I didn't try to\ndo anything about it --",
        "Q: You weren't angry?",
        "A: -- except cope with it. No, it's just the Army, that's all. I mean, I figure that's just\nnormal.",
        "Q: Now --",
        "A: When I got orders to go -- to go to the 71st Light Division, I did look up what a Light\nDivision was in the camp library and it said jungle/mountain, mule pack, amphibious, and\nparatroop.",
        "Q: And what did you think when you saw that?",
        "A: And then I -- I said God, I don't want any of those. And then it turned out to be a\ncombination of two of them: Jungle and mountain.",
        "Q: Right. Uh-huh.",
        "A: But you know my son was a paratrooper.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: SO.",
        "Q: When? What year?",
        "A: Oh, 20 years ago or so.",
        "Q: 20 years ago or So.",
        "A: No, more than that. He's in his 50's so.",
        "Q: Was there a war on?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It was in peacetime?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. Because you were not drafted. You were -- you were a volunteer. Did you\nenjoy any perks? Was there anything given to you as a reward for that or you were just\ntreated the same\u2019?",
        "A: My impression was that there were a lot of enlisted personnel in our outfit because it\nwas an old Panama outfit. It was a regular Army outfit, 5th Infantry.",
        "Q: So those were not draftees?",
        "A: No. But -- but then there were draftees, too. So, there were both.",
        "Q: And there was no distinction between an enlistee and a draftee?",
        "A: Well, I think the newer ones, like the ones who were drafted, along with me, we -- we\nwere different, you know, coming from cities or with more education than these other\nguys that...",
        "Q: But the system didn't treat you differently?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. So this -- this man recognizes you in the foxhole. This is your -- your big\nbreakthrough moment and he -- he takes you where? Where do you end up?",
        "A: In Service Company, the same regiment.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But instead of Company F, which is a line company, and I was on mortar. I was a 60-\nmilimeter mortar ammunition bearer. And I thought that I was lucky to get that -- to get\nthat assignment because the mortar squad 1s a little behind the lines.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because you have to shoot over --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: You know -- but I was there were -- there were seven ammunition bearers in a mortar\nsquad, I think, or five or seven, I don't remember. And I was tail end.I was the last one in.\nSo I considered myself really lucky --",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: -- that I got that job.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: So.",
        "Q: And then you're taken out of that company and put into Service Company?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And what -- what letter is that? The Service Company?",
        "A: Just Service Company.",
        "Q: Oh, it doesn't have a letter?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay. And are you given training in the Service Company?",
        "A: I don't remember any training. I think I had to learn the personnel situation.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Personnel procedures and everything.",
        "Q: So you said earlier you were processing the new recruits, the boys who had been\nASTP and who had just -- just graduated?",
        "A: That was in this.",
        "Q: In this company?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Are you still in Colorado at that point?",
        "A: No, we moved to -- We changed to a Full Division from a Light Division.",
        "Q: Okay?",
        "A: So I think that's why I got the job in Service Company because it expanded.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Everything expanded and classification specialist, I guess, was created or I don't know\nwhether it was there before.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But when we changed to a Full Division instead of a Light Division, we went to Fort\nBenning, Georgia and that's where we were. Fort Benning.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Fort Benning? Approximately when did you get there and\nwhen did you leave?",
        "A: I think until we went to overseas. We went overseas from New Jersey. We were there\njust very briefly in New Jersey. But --",
        "Q: So when did you get to Georgia and when did you leave Georgia?",
        "A: Well, I don't think we went -- we got overseas until '45.",
        "Q: January '45 is when you got overseas?",
        "A: Something like that.",
        "Q: So, when you enlist, this is '43, you do 13 weeks of basic training.So 13 weeks, what\nis that? That's about three months? So, you're in the Fall of '43 and then you're going into\n-- your -- then you go to Colorado because basic training is in California; did I get this\nright?",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Texas, Texas is basic training. And then you go to Colorado?",
        "A: And then Colorado.",
        "Q: And you stayed in Colorado a whole year?",
        "A: Part of Colorado was in, I think part of Colorado I must have been in Service\nCompany too at the end of it.",
        "Q: Okay?",
        "A: But -- but I may have been there a full year but I -- I think we were in Fort Benning\nlonger.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Georgia?",
        "A: I'm not sure.",
        "Q: Okay. Was -- was your job different in Georgia? Did you do different tasks there?",
        "A: No, there it was Classification Specialist 275.",
        "Q: And when you get your orders to ship out, how do you feel? What's your reaction?",
        "A: Just expected, that's all it was.",
        "Q: You weren't worried? Scared? Apprehensive?",
        "A: No, not that I remember.",
        "Q: Okay. All right. So in '45, at the beginning of that year, where -- where are you\nshipped to?",
        "A: We landed in Normandy but by then there was no beachhead anymore. It was all a\nport.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.",
        "A: You know, so, with -- with landing docks and stuff like that. So we landed there and\nwe camped in Fort -- now what was it called, Camp Lucky Strike.",
        "Q: This is in France?",
        "A: Yeah, Camp Lucky Strike. Camp Chesterfield. I think we were -- the French called it,\n\"Lukey Streak\".",
        "Q: Was it close to Normandy? Was it in Normandy?",
        "A: In Normandy.",
        "Q: In Normandy. And what were you doing in the camp?",
        "A: Uh-huh. Well, the same, same things. I mean, I was working in Service Company and\nclassification.",
        "Q: But -- but what kind of tasks were you assigned? Or were you still processing new\ndraftees in France?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: What were you doing?",
        "A: I don't know, it was just keeping track of personnel.",
        "Q: How long were you in Normandy?",
        "A: Shifts, promotions, I don't know. I don't remember how long but I know that when we\nstarted going across, I \u2014 I remember there was a town of Bitche, B-I-T-C-H-E.",
        "Q: B-I-T-C-H-E?",
        "A: And Kulmbach in Germany was -- we were in Alsace Lorraine first. I don't remember\nthe town, but I think --",
        "Q: While you were in -- still in France, were you interacting with any of the local\npopulation?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So what -- what kinds of --",
        "A: I took French in high school.",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: So, I was the French interpreter. It was rough. I mean, I -- I mean, my French was\nrough.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But I was the official getter of wine.",
        "Q: So how did that happen? How did you get the wine?",
        "A: Well, at the end of the day, you know, we could go into town.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So we went into the village and I would ask for -- for wine and there was something\nelse, there was two things. And of course, we were always in good shapes to -- good\nshape to barter because we had cigarettes and that was what everybody wanted.",
        "Q: Was that the only thing you bartered or was there anything else? Rations or chocolate\nor?",
        "A: Chocolate. But I remember saying, (?\"Aba do divan\"?). Oh, I know, it was \"vin rouge\nor vin blanc\". That's right. It was only two --",
        "Q: So you didn't get down to the varietals. You didn't talk about what kind of wine it is?\nYou didn't say --",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "Q: -- I would like a burgundy wine? Or no? No, it was just red or white? Both?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did they have both?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you have a preference?",
        "A: But mostly red, I think. I don't know. I wasn't hot on wine drinking any way. I brought\nit back for the other guys.",
        "Q: Was -- was actually alcohol consumption, was that something your parents did? Did\nthey drink wine at home ever?",
        "A: My parents didn't drink. My father would take a shot of schnapps only at a party or\nsomething. And he never was drunk. My mother wouldn't drink.",
        "Q: And so growing up had you had any experience with alcohol in high school? In\ncollege, before you entered the Army\u201d?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: There were no parties?",
        "A: With alcohol?",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So when you were tasked to bring back this wine, you had no interest in it?",
        "A: No.I don't -- I'm not sure about that. Maybe I was interested in tasting it or but not a\ngreat deal.",
        "Q: And the other -- the other soldiers, did they drink too much?",
        "A: Well some of them did, yeah.",
        "Q: They did? Did they misbehave when they drank too much?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, there was some times cases of fighting or passing out or...",
        "Q: So the misbehavior would be on base? It would not be in the village? It would not be\nin with locals?",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: There was no incidents with locals?",
        "A: No, I don't remember any.",
        "Q: When somebody misbehaved, given that you're in classification, did you have to write\nup a report?",
        "A: No, that was -- that was done -- that was not done by me. That was court-martials.",
        "Q: Okay. Oh, okay. So you were bringing back wine. And what other tasks did you do as\nan interpreter?",
        "A: Laundry.",
        "Q: So you took -- You were speaking with the locals in order to get the laundry done?\nWith women?",
        "A: I don't remember anything else.",
        "Q: So, how long -- how long was your stay in France? You get there at the beginning of\nthe year. Is it still cold when you leave?",
        "A: I don't remember. I think it must have been. I -- I do remember Kulmbach and there\nwas beer --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- there.",
        "Q: This is Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, approximately where in Germany? What's a big city there?",
        "A: Kulmbach was -- was a big city.",
        "Q: Okay. Close to or in, in which state?",
        "A: It's -- I don't know the state but it was closer to France.",
        "Q: Okay. Uh-huh. Is it spelled K-U-M-B-A-C-H?",
        "A: K-U-L-M-B-A-C-H.",
        "Q: Okay. All right. So that's your -- in your memories that's your first German\nexperience?",
        "A: Yeah, if I could see a map, there might be a some other -- some other towns that we\nstopped in before that but I can't remember them.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, all right. So tell me about Kulmbach. What happened there?\nInsdg ",
        "A: Nothing except that it was an interesting, 1t was a German city and there was -- it had\nthe buildings and the narrow streets and so on and beer and that's all I remember.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me about the beer. You weren't very interested in alcohol so why did you\nmention the beer?",
        "A: Well, I just remembered that was one of the features there that they talked about.",
        "Q: Oh. What about the locals in Kulmbach? Did you interact with them?",
        "A: It seems to me that I -- I was suspicious of all of the Germans and didn't know who\nwas a Nazi and who wasn't and was kind of not friendly with them like I was with the\nFrench.",
        "Q: And how did you feel about the Germans in general? Did you, because the way you're\ndescribing it, what I'm understanding, is that you had a sense that some were not Nazi's.\nDid you have a feeling that some had been part of the system and some had not? Or did\nyou have a stronger sentiment of kind of a blanket feeling regarding towards them that\nthey must of all been a part of the system?",
        "A: Well, everybody said \"nicht Nazi, nicht Nazi.\" But no, I had a sense that some were\nand some were not but most were.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So does that mean that you were -- you pretty much did not interact\nwith the population at that point yet because you weren't sure what you were in for?",
        "A: Right. Also, we weren't there. We weren't at any place long enough.",
        "Q: How long did you say?",
        "A: You know, well, we -- we got into combat 54 days before the end of the war; okay?",
        "Q: Okay.\nInsdg ",
        "A: So, when was -- when was V-E day?",
        "Q: May 8th?",
        "A: May 8th. So 54 days before May 8th was what?",
        "Q: Roughly two months. So that would put it at early March; right?",
        "A: Uh-huh. So that's when we went into combat.",
        "Q: And where did you go into combat?",
        "A: And I think it was around Kulmbach; but I'm not sure.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. And what was your first experience of combat?",
        "A: Well, see, I was in Service Company; so it was, I don't-- I don't -- We weren't in\ncombat. I mean, they were, the front lines, the line companies were in actual combat.",
        "Q: Right, uh-huh.",
        "A: And we were behind them, following them.",
        "Q: Sure. Sure.",
        "A: So we knew what was going on but we weren't directly in it. Where we were, we were\ntaking over what had already been --",
        "Q: Liberated?",
        "A: -- victorious for us, so.",
        "Q: And -- and again, what -- what tasks were you doing? Were you still only processing\nyour own people's --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- papers? So you were -- you were not working on local issues while the Army was\nadvancing?\nInsdg ",
        "A: No, not that I -- no not that I --",
        "Q: Did you ever see combat before the end of the war? Were you in any kind of danger?",
        "A: Yeah, there was -- there was one time when there was some shooting or some sniper\nor something. But in general, no, I was not in combat.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So --",
        "A: There was one day, one -- one time that was dangerous. I don't remember whether it\nwas a truck, something was blown up or shot or something but.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.",
        "A: But I wasn't hurt.",
        "Q: How did you learn that the war was over in Europe?",
        "A: I don't remember exactly. I think it just was announced all over and celebrated.",
        "Q: Where were you when -- when the war was over?",
        "A: We were in Steyr Austria.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Or near Steyr Austria on the Inn River; we had met the Russians.",
        "Q: So when did you meet the Russians?",
        "A: That was -- When was the war over, May?",
        "Q: May 8th.",
        "A: May 8th. So I would say it was in May.",
        "Q: So that -- that one week, it was one week before. It was the week of -- that's when you\nmet the Russians?",
        "A: I think so, around then.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: So can you describe what happened when you met the Russians?",
        "A: All I remember was that there was toasting and -- and joyful meeting and celebrating\nand --",
        "Q: Did the -- did the two groups mix? Was there any kind of interaction between the\nSoviet Army and the U.S. Army\u2019?",
        "A: I don't -- A little bit.",
        "Q: Did you -- Do you recall ever meeting the Soviet soldier?",
        "A: More by the officers, not much by us. Our -- our major-- our major meeting was with\nformer concentration camp people that were strewn, that were wherever we went, you\nknow.",
        "Q: When did that start happening? That wherever you would go you would bump into,\nrun into?",
        "A: Oh, I would say probably from -- from Central Germany on; especially in Bavaria and\nAustria. It was the worst in Austria.",
        "Q: So, if it started in Germany, do you recall when you first -- when your company first\ncame across a concentration camp survivor?",
        "A: No, I don't remember when --",
        "Q: Do you recall -- do you recall your first thoughts? Did you know who these people\nwere?",
        "A: Yeah, I knew they were -- Well, they wore striped, striped like pajama like uniforms.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And some of them looked like skeletons.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: Where were you coming across these people?",
        "A: Several places across Germany and Austria.",
        "Q: Fields? Roads?",
        "A: But I think the most -- the most -- the largest one was this camp that we opened.",
        "Q: Okay. So, tell me about that.",
        "A: Well, that was -- What was the name of it again? During --",
        "Q: Gunskirchen?",
        "A: Yeah. Gunskirchen Lager. Another GI and I walked away from our unit and just\nstrolling and we -- we came across this camp and we opened the door and out poured\nsome prisoners and some of them were so, looked like skeletons and -- and one -- one\ncalled to me in Yiddish and said, \"I'm one of you.\" \"I'm one of you.\"",
        "Q: -- So the prisoner said to you, I'm one of you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, did he know that you spoke Yiddish or understood Yiddish?",
        "A: He didn't. I guess I looked Jewish.",
        "Q: And so you hear this. What -- what is passing through --",
        "A: He said, \"Haberach Monus (ph)\" have pity, have sympathy.",
        "Q: What did you do when you heard that?",
        "A: I didn't, nothing. I just, I mean, you know, we had a rifle and a steel helmet and we\nwere in full gear and they stumbled out and -- and some, he -- he dropped and I think he\ndropped dead. And there was some who dropped dead and some just started flowing out\nso we ran back to our unit to try to get medics and to try to get everybody involved.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: But this was not the first time you had seen people in these striped uniforms?",
        "A: No, I had seen -- we had seen others before.",
        "Q: How frequently had you seen them? Just a few incidents or?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And those incidents were -- I\u2014 I understand you probably don't remember the exact\nlocation but what was the -- where was it in a field? Or on a road? Or in an other camp\nwhere they concentrated? Was it many people? Few people?",
        "A: I think it was a few.",
        "Q: So you had come across these people in the striped clothing?",
        "A: I think so, yeah.",
        "Q: And you had known what about them exactly at that time?",
        "A: That they were concentration camp prisoners.",
        "Q: And you knew about concentration camps because?",
        "A: Because I read about them.",
        "Q: In where?",
        "A: I don't know. Maybe, maybe the Yank paper, maybe the GI paper or -- or well, I knew\nabout concentration camps from the time I was a civilian.",
        "Q: But would you -- would you know that the striped uniform is what a concentration\ncamp inmate wears?",
        "A: I think so.",
        "Q: Did the Army ever brief you on who these people are or what to expect about these\npeople?\nInsdg ",
        "A: I think -- I think they did. I think there was some discussion about tt.",
        "Q: Do you have any concrete examples? Any details?",
        "A: No, I don't. No. In military government we learned a lot about it.",
        "Q: But that was after having --",
        "A: That was \u2014",
        "Q: -- liberated?",
        "A: -- that was later.",
        "Q: -- Gunskirchen. Uh-huh. So when you happened upon this camp your idea of what\nyou're seeing 1s what?",
        "A: You know, I'm a little confused about prisoners of -- German prisoners of war that\nwere huddled together in trucks and they were carried, they were driven away from\nwhere they were captured and prisoners of -- and concentration camp prisoners with the\nstriped uniforms in trucks. It seems to me that I saw them in trucks, too but I'm not sure\nthat they were rescued and carried and that I -- we passed some of them on the roads. I\ndon't know, I just felt that I knew about concentration camps and prisoners well before\nthat time and that we saw some.",
        "Q: So as you were describing, you opened the gates. Were the gates locked?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So you could just turn a handle and open it?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Why had they not opened it?\nInsdg ",
        "A: And the guards were all gone. The guards had left already and they took all of the\nfood.",
        "Q: Do you know why they had not opened it? The gate?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Because it seems to me you're saying that 1t was easy to open?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. The other guy and I lifted 1t and opened it and I said my God, we opened\nit.",
        "Q: Do you remember the other guy's name?",
        "A: No.I've been trying to think of it and I -- I can't remember his name. I remember what\nhe looked like.",
        "Q: Careful of the mic.",
        "A: He was also in Service Company. He -- I don't know whether he was a clerk of some\nsort or --",
        "Q: But so you opened the gate and this is when you hear the man speaking Yiddish?",
        "A: Well, he -- he started coming out?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts -- thoughts when you heard that?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: -- \"have pity. Have\" --",
        "A: Well, just felt, I'm touched, you know, moved.",
        "Q: The fact that he was speaking Yiddish?\nInsdg ",
        "A: Yeah and that he was so, so thin. And then he, you know.",
        "Q: So did you immediately decide to go back to your company\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you -- At that point you are not interacting with any of the prisoners?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: How long did it take you to get back to the company, do you think?",
        "A: Oh, immediately. We turned around and ran back when we saw all of these people.",
        "Q: And what did you tell your company? What had you just seen?",
        "A: That we opened a concentration camp and --",
        "Q: And what did -- and what did your \u2014",
        "A: Take over.",
        "Q: Okay. And what did they do?",
        "A: They did. As I recall they went there and they evacuated the prisoners.",
        "Q: Did you go back with them?",
        "A: With ambulances, you know, they got ambulances and they got -- Yeah, well, I don't -\n- | don't remember too much after that. Where we -- where we were or where we were\nassigned to something else right away or...",
        "Q: So did you ever go -- go back to Mauthausen during that period?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: There was -- there was just that one interaction of, I'm sorry, Gunscarium (sic), that --\nthat one situation where you're opening the gate and then you immediately went back to\nthe company. So you did not enter the camp?\nInsdg ",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And you must have been there just a few minutes?",
        "A: Maybe, yeah.",
        "Q: How many people did you see?",
        "A: Maybe dozens in the background.",
        "Q: What was?",
        "A: It smelled of death.",
        "Q: Tell me -- tell me about the smell?",
        "A: Just -- it just had an awful smell.",
        "Q: What was it reminiscent of?",
        "A: I don't know. Smelled bad and people said that's the smell of death?",
        "Q: Which people? Who said that?",
        "A: Guys in the Army. I just don't remember too much of that.",
        "Q: What was the weather like that day? Was it raining?",
        "A: It was not raining, no.",
        "Q: Was it fairly warm by then? Or was it a cold Spring?",
        "A: I don't remember that. I think it was fairly -- It must-- I don't know. I know it wasn't\nraining.",

        "Q: Uh-huh, okay, very good. Well I was very much interested to hear and I also listened a\nlittle bit to the original interview what your function was after World War II. How did\nyou get involved with the denazification and why were you chosen -- chosen to be part of\nthat program?",
        "A: Well, I was -- I was in the infantry --",

        "Q: Oh, yes.",
        "A: And I was just bored, I guess, and I -- and I heard about military government needing\npeople, so I applied for a transfer and I got it, and they transferred me to Regensburg.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And when I went to -- I was put into Public Safety Special Branch and it turned out\nthat the head of denazification, the enlisted man who was the head, the title is chief clerk,\nthat he was leaving in a few days.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And I had a few years of college credit in psychology and I guess they thought that --\nthat I could do it. So I was only 22 years old, but I wanted it and they thought I could do\nit, so they trained me to fill his spot.",

        "A: Yes, it was.",
        "Q: Now, what -- how -- now in retrospect, how successful do you think that this program\nworked out?",
        "A: Well, in our district, which was -- the state of the niederbayern and obersfeldt (ph)\nwhere Regensburg is.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: We had the highest number of -- of -- what you call it, of screenings, we had the\nhighest number of evaluations and removals of people from their jobs, Nazis, than\nanyone else in the U.S. Zone. We had -- we were very successful.",

        "Q: -- on the Nazis to -- well, let's say nevermind repent, but they realized finally how\nwrong they had gone or how criminal their government had been or do you think that\nthey -- they did this mostly so that they would be spared from trials or prison or worse?",
        "A: Well, they didn't do it, we did it, we removed them. We-- we evaluated them.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- administrative jobs and we removed thousands and that-- that was our mission, to\ncleanse the new government of -- of Nazis as much as possible at the higher levels. I\nmean at the lower levels there were -- there were many Nazi party members, but we kept\n-- if they were -- if -- if they had joined the party after summer of '37 they were\nconsidered okay.",
        "Q: Because then they were forced?",
        "A: Yeah. If they hadn't held any position -- any official positions.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what was their reaction to being chosen to be denazified? \u2014I assume that some\nwere beyond that. In other words, that they, you know, either ended up in prison or could\nnot be used --",

        "Q: Yeah.\nInsdg ",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t process them. We turned them over to--",

        "Q: I see, yeah.",
        "A: -- but we didn't deal with those.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see.",
        "A: Yeah, it didn't last long, though. We understand \u2014 I understand that it changed about,\nyou know -- in 1946, I think it was, late 1946. I was there only until May '46.",

        "A: I was there from September to May '46. And we were very-- we were very aggressive\nin pursuing Nazis and getting them out of office.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "A: And some people -- I mean I understand the Germans themselves felt that it wasn't\nworth doing or something, I don't know. One -- I remember one Nazi party official that\nwe removed from office said to me that he had -- he had his days of glory and now -- and\nnow it's turned over, so, you know, it's --",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and were they in favor of it or not, and so apparently he -- you know, he became\nquite well known. That's maybe why the name is familiar to you. Yeah, Kempner was the\nname. He was a German interrogating his own people.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Yeah. Okay. So how -- let's see, did they honestly cooperate or did they just want to\nescape punishment and, therefore, participated in the program? What would you think?\nInsdg ",
        "A: No, I -- well, they were being investigated, they wanted to get away -- I don't think\nthey cooperated. They were --",

        "A: The people who were screened?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, they filled out the fragebogen and handed it in.",
        "Q: That was my question, too: How honest were the answers or could you assess that?",
        "A: Well, that's an interesting question because a lot of -- many Germans came from the\neast zone.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "A: And there were no records to check on their responses, but in our zone, 1n our area,\nRegensburg itself --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- had an intact record center that had all the Nazi records. So people from the local\narea we could check on, so we had --",

        "A: -- so we had a routine check in the records center \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah.",

        "Q: Yeah.\nInsdg ",
        "A: -- whatever, we had no way of checking on them, so of course they were more sus --\nthey were more suspicious.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you think that some of them really -- well, let me ask you this then: How\ndid you determine who -- whom to get into the program?",
        "A: Who --",
        "Q: How did you choose the individual that you thought would qualify to be in the\nprogram and be denazified?",
        "A: I -- I don't know. We didn't -- we didn't choose.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Somebody chose.",
        "Q: I see, uh-huh.",

        "Q: I see, I see.",

        "Q: So you were handed a list of people \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I see, I understand. And then you did your best to try and get the Nazi ideology out of\nthem, huh?",
        "A: Not to get the Nazi ideology out of them, but to keep the ones that were more serious\nNazis out of -- out of important jobs.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: I mean we didn't expect to change their ideology.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: And -- {coughing} excuse me. And how did you -- you were a young person, as you\nmentioned earlier.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How did you feel to carry out such a difficult burden? I mean in a way from a human\npoint of view this is quite a -- a hard burden to carry because you decide on somebody's\nfuture in a way.",
        "A: Not at all, it was a joy.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: I was glad to do it. It was revenge.",
        "Q: Well, that I can understand, right. Now, how was the --",
        "A: I was -- you know, I'm Jewish.",
        "Q: I know, I know.",
        "A: So I -- you know, I saw that as a -- as a good kind of revenge.",
        "Q: I see, uh-huh. And -- well, okay.",
        "A: My interpreter was also Jewish, he was -- he was a German Jewish refugee who was\nin the Army.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, many of them came \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- at an age here to America and then enlisted in the Army, that's right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: You know I come from that part of the world, too.",
        "A: You came from --\nInsdg ",
        "Q: I'm originally from -- from Hamburg.",
        "A: Oh, yeah?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, that's in the north.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Now, what was the procedure, was this program conducted on a\nOne -- one-on-one basis or did you have groups at the same time, and how exactly did you\nproceed in this project, in this program of denazification?",
        "A: Well, we had the fragebogens.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And they would come in, and they would have to be evaluated.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we had a staff of evaluators that were about 30 people.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, uh-huh, yeah.",
        "A: And there were -- they went over them and -- and they would come to me and say this\none looks suspicious or this one, you know, and so on, but they would -- there were --\nthere were procedures to follow.",
        "Q: I see, okay.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: So you followed a protocol, in other words?",
        "A: Yeah.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see, okay. But then -- and then let's say now you have chosen 10 or 20 or 30\nof these individuals. Was it conducted like in a classroom or was it conducted on a one-\nto-one basis?",
        "A: No, one-to-one.",
        "Q: It was one-to-one?",
        "A: Well, each -- each questionnaire was \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- was a -- it was a Separate investigation, a separate procedure for each individual.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was the procedure?",
        "A: The procedure was to evaluate their questionnaire and to come up with a rating in --\nthere were five categories.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see.",
        "A: You know, you know those five categories: Number one is mandatory removal,\nnumber two is -- is discretionary adverse recommendation, number three is discretionary\nno recommendation, number four is no evidence of anti -- no evidence of Nazi activity,\nand number five was evidence of anti-Nazi activity.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: And so each individual would get a rating.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nInsdg ",
        "A: That would be the conclusion. And then if they were in the four or five, they would be\nremoved from office or not hired and their bank account would be frozen and their\nproperty could be seized and used by the Allies, by the Americans for, you know, like\nhomes could be used for troops.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah. And how long did such a process take?",
        "A: The evaluation process?",
        "Q: Yes, uh-huh.",
        "A: Just -- just -- 1t was -- I don't know, I would say anywhere from an hour to a couple of\ndays.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see.",
        "A: It depended on if there were any complications, because we also had a special\ninvestigations unit that would look into difficult case -- cases that were, you know, harder\nto figure out.",
        "Q: Right, right, uh-huh.",
        "A: They -- you know, they might -- they might go to -- to interrogate some other people\nor try to get other records or whatever.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Or did you interview members of their family or --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- I don\u2019t know what \u2014 uh-huh.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Or friends or \u2014\nInsdg ",
        "A: either. Most -- the action in most cases was taken on the basis of the questionnaire\nalone.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see.",
        "A: We would bring them in for interviews if we had questions.",
        "Q: I see, I see. Oh, you mean you got the fragebogen, that you evaluated, but you didn't\nnecessarily have the individual in front of you?",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see. I didn't realize that. Now I suppose I had a -- I had a different concept\nsomewhat. I thought that after you went through the fragebogen and you decided who\nwas suspicious or wasn't suspicious, that they somehow got some kind of a -- I don't want\nto call it brainwashing, but some kind of a, you know, democratic viewpoint or -- or --",
        "A: Oh, no, no. No, it was strictly \u2014",
        "Q: Based on their fragebogen.",
        "A: It was, yeah, strictly screening, no attempt to change them or argue with them.",
        "Q: And were they cooperative, were they hostile, antagonistic or --",
        "A: Well, I would say the main attitude was to try to get out of it, you know, to say that\nthey were innocent.",
        "Q: Oh --",
        "A: \"Nicht Nazi, Nicht Nazi\" was -- was their motto. There was one case -- -",
        "Q: Well, that was easy to say afterwards.",
        "A: There was one case I remember where this man said that-- that he understands that the\ntables were turned and he had his days of glory and now his side has lost and he's\nInsdg \nprepared to take the consequences, and he -- you know, he said well, we had our day and\nnow you have your day. Well, that was very unusual.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, to admit that?",
        "A: For anybody to do that. Most of them were\u2014made excuses. You know, they said they\nwere forced or that they were not really a Nazi and so on. And of course the people from\n-- who came from East Germany, there was no way to check.",
        "Q: That's the other big problem, exactly, right. So I was-- one of the questions I had in\nmy mind was: Was any material used during this process, but I guess it wasn't 'cause I\nhad a different concept of it at all.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: I thought there were lectures being given on democracy or lectures --",
        "A: Oh, no. There was no attempt to change anybody. It was completely screening.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And get the least suspicious back into the workforce?",
        "A: The what?",
        "Q: I said and then to get the least suspicious individuals back into the working force?",
        "A: Yeah, to -- well, to allow them to continue in their -- on their jobs.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Or to be hired.",
        "Q: Yeah, I understand, yeah. Okay. Let's see now, what qualifications did you have or\nrequired in order to be part of this process? Well, you said that --\nInsdg ",
        "A: Well, I was -- I was a college student, I was a psychology major, and I also had\nexperience working in personnel administration.",
        "Q: I see, oh, I see.",
        "A: So I had administrative experience.",
        "Q: I see. And were you in charge of the -- of this particular program?",
        "A: Yes, I was -- well, I was an enlisted man, I was a sergeant.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The person in charge of the whole thing was an officer, a captain.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And he -- and there was also a lieutenant, so I remember there were two American\nofficers that were in charge, but the day-to-day work was done by -- the day-to-day work\nof -- of being in charge, | mean, --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- was done by an enlisted man.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And my predecessor was the one who was being discharged. He was also a Jewish\nguy \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah",
        "A: -- from the States. And I was put in to learn \u2014 learn the ropes.",
        "Q: I see, yeah.",
        "A: And learn the job \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh.\nInsdg ",
        "A: -- that he did heading up the staff, supervising the staff.",
        "Q: I see. So you were in a supervisory position?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The title was chief clerk.",
        "Q: I see, good, very good. Were there Germans that participated under oath?",
        "A: Germans --",
        "Q: Well, let's say those who filled out the fragebogen -- fragebogen, and was there\nanywhere where they had to, I don't know, sign that -- like we say here in the United\nStates --",
        "A: I think -- I think --",
        "Q: You know, to whatever I wrote that --",
        "A: I think they signed it -- I think they -- when they signed it it said -- it probably said in\nthere that something about --",
        "Q: But they were not under any verbal oath or anything like that?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Well, they -- I think they got away with too much, quite honestly, but never mind.\nWell, that was another question I had: How could you be sure that what they put down in\ntheir fragebogen was an honest answer? But I think you answered that already and you\ncould --",
        "A: The record center.",
        "Q: Yeah. You could check it unless they came from the east?\nInsdg ",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, that's, of course, a big problem, but -- and that I guess wasn't really\neliminated until the '90s, right, when they got records.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What did you hope to achieve with this denazification program?",
        "A: Cleansing. Well, to keep the new Germany, the new German government more\ndemocratic, and not -- not back in the hands of the Nazis.",
        "Q: And do you think you succeeded?",
        "A: We succeeded in -- in our job, but we understand that the new German government\nkind of weakened and we had heard that Nazis were being kept or hired again.",
        "Q: And that was under Adenauer or \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well, I guess you were dealing here with what, 52 million people or however many --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you told me already where you were located, right? In -- in Regensburg \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- or where was --",
        "A: Regensburg on the...",
        "Q: Okay. And that's where -- where your work was concentrated, in that part of Bavaria?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How long did you work in this capacity?",
        "A: I was there from September of '45 through May of '46.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: At the time that I was in a DP camp in Italy.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: Beyond that even, until August, I guess, of '46. Okay. What were some of the most\nmemorable incidents that you remember from that period? You already told me about the\nguy who said you had your day --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I mean we had our day, now you have your day. I'm sure you came across a number of\nother memorable incidents with these people.",
        "A: Well, I think one was when the statistics came out to show that we had the highest\nnumber of removals in the whole US zone.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. The highest removal?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That's interesting.",
        "A: Yeah, the highest number.",
        "Q: Well, Bavaria is sort of Hitler country \u2014",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: -- perhaps that's why.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Munich, that's part of it.",
        "A: Also, we had heard --",
        "Q: Yeah.\nInsdg ",
        "A: -- that the British were sitting and having tea with the Nazis, and that the French, I\ndon't know -- the French were either very vengeful or just didn't care, but that the United\nStates forces were the most serious about denazification, so we were proud that we were\ndoing a good job.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay. But specifically on a one-to-one from an individual, do you have any\nmemorable incidents that occurred with, you know, you speaking to any of these people\nor in conversation or --",
        "A: I don't -- I don't remember any specific.",
        "Q: I see. Now, you think that the program was effective?",
        "A: Well, it was effective while we were doing it, but it was -- but it was overturned; you\nknow, it was watered down and then it was done away with.",
        "Q: How soon would you think was it watered down? I think that really is also an\nimportant point because was there already a new younger generation coming 1n or --",
        "A: No, not while we were there. It was after -- we heard that it was done afterward,\nprobably in late '46.",
        "Q: What, that they over turned this program?",
        "A: That's what I heard.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Were any other highlights that you remember during this period? I\nmean some really heavy duty Nazis that were discovered in this way? I assume that\nperhaps through the fragebogen you did discover some --",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Anybody specific?\nInsdg ",
        "A: No, I can't remember any -- any big -- big name.",
        "Q: Yeah, I mean really big shots.",
        "A: No, I don't think so.",
        "Q: Okay. What about -- or how was it justified that some of the Nazis scientists, etcetera,\nended up here?",
        "A: Oh, I don't know. I don't know anything about that. I guess the United States needed\nthem.",
        "Q: Or they would have fallen into the hands of the -- of the -- of the other side.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you think -- well, let me ask you this: What are some of the strengths or\nweaknesses of this program?",
        "A: Well, I think -- the weakness was not having record centers -- not having records on\npeople who came from other areas.",
        "Q: Oh, yeah, yeah, right, right.",
        "A: Other than that, I think it was done very well.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: You know, and they were serious and people were removed and gradually jobs were --\nwere given to people who were not Nazis. There weren't many -- there weren't many\naround, you know. There was -- practically everybody was in the Nazi party because of\nthe mandatory membership --",
        "Q: Right --",
        "A: -- from '37 on.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: {Coughing} excuse me. No, that I realize and that, of course, very difficult to make\nthis distinction and then to be sure that --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, very difficult. Did you -- were you able to -- to obtain lists of Nazi party\nmembers?",
        "A: As I recall, there was one time when -- when somebody uncovered a record or a list of\n-- of -- of members that we could check against -- against our applicants. It was kind of\na surprise treasure that was uncovered.",
        "Q: I can imagine, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And probably to the great disappointment of some of the people --",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: There you had it black and white, huh?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. I had a question of how were the candidates for denazification chosen?",
        "A: It was a routine thing on their job. It was because of what -- what position -- I guess --\nI guess it was, you know, everybody in certain jobs in the government or in important\npositions in society.",
        "Q: That you really needed in order to --",
        "A: We didn't -- we didn't select them, they were -- we received -- we received them,\nsomebody else selected them.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: Made the selection. When you say somebody else, you mean from among the allies,\nnot from within the Germans themselves?",
        "A: I guess so. I don't -- I don't really know. It might be that an order went in from military\ngovernment that everybody in a certain industry had to submit a fragebogen.",
        "Q: I see, okay, uh-huh. So really everything, all the -- all the selection, and I hate to use\nthat word for obvious reasons, but let's -- let's just use it for lack of a better word, so all\nthe selections were really based entirely on the fragebogen?",
        "A: On -- all the selection?",
        "Q: Yeah, who was going to be denazified or not.",
        "A: Oh. Well, it started with the fragebogen.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Then if there were questions or suspicions, then -- then there would be interviews and\nfurther investigations.",
        "Q: Did you do some of the interviews yourself as well?",
        "A: Did what?",
        "Q: Did you do personally some of the interviews yourself or \u2014",
        "A: No. We had an American GI originally from Germany who was a special investigator\nand he would -- he would do them.",
        "Q: He would do the --",
        "A: Interviews. And he -- and he would do the -- he would do further investigation.",
        "Q: I see. So really was a whole team work\u2019?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, absolutely.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Now, the -- the workload must have been overwhelming, as we said\nbefore, dealing with a whole nation?",
        "A: Well, we only had one state.",
        "Q: Now, did this -- that's a good answer because that brings me to another question. Did\nyou -- did the United States have such programs all over Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yes. It was in the -- the whole US zone \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- was divided into areas and all of them had the same kind of thing we did.",
        "Q: I see, I see.",
        "A: We were just -- we were just in one state.",
        "Q: You're just the -- the --",
        "A: Niederbayern and obersfeldt.",
        "Q: Niederbayern, yeah. Oh, I see. This really was a very well organized undertaking.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: I mean -- so what would you say, roughly how many people in your sector, on your\nsection were involved in this? Germans, I mean.",
        "A: Oh, I -- the population?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don't -- I don't know.A million.",
        "Q: Oh, really?\nInsdg ",
        "A: I don't know. I don't remember.",
        "Q: Well, it was a vast undertaking. And you -- you -- you talk about the Americans\nhaving done that, and I was not aware of that either that -- that this was not an allied\nundertaking. I always was under the impression that this was a cooperative undertaking.",
        "A: No, this was American.",
        "Q: I see. And the other --",
        "A: And the others had their own systems.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did they also call it denazification?",
        "A: I don't think so.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I don't know what they had. I mean we -- we had heard that -- that -- that the British\nwere having tea with the Nazis and the French were just wrecking their stores and homes.",
        "Q: So not -- not --",
        "A: Oh, and the Russians were terrible, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah, I know that.",
        "A: Everybody ran away from the Russians \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and said that they were monsters.",
        "Q: Right. Now that I heard --",
        "A: Because they were so -- they were so vengeful \u2014",
        "Q: Right, even from --",
        "A: -- at the destruction that the Germans did of Russia.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: And also a lot of Russians died because of that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. So let me ask you this: What would you say, how-- how did this experience\naffect you as a young person in such a responsible position, you know, which involved\nreally impacting the course of people's lives? Were you aware of your power, were you\ntroubled by the fact that you did not have experience in that area?",
        "A: No, actually, I think it matured me. I enjoyed it. We lived well. I mean we had -- we\nhad a hotel room, we had a \u2014 we had -- we -- you know, we lived in a hotel, we had\ndances, we had an orchestra, we had a bar, we -- I had a girlfriend. We had a chauffeur to\ngo wherever we wanted to, like to a play or an opera or concert. It was -- it was a very\neducational experience.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I mean I was -- I was so young. I had -- I had three years of college credit, which I had\ndone in two years.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "A: And so, you know, --",
        "Q: Did you pursue that psychology at the end?",
        "A: Yes, I went on and got a PhD in psychology.",
        "Q: Very nice, lovely. Well, so you're telling me that so close after the war ended, this\nhorrible war, they had already concert, theater, opera, dances --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and everything else?\nInsdg ",
        "A: Yep.",
        "Q: I guess people are very resilient.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Well --",
        "A: Well, Regensburg wasn't -- wasn't wrecked as much as some other cities.",
        "Q: I know, I know. Hamburg was destroyed, 75 percent.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, bombing.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. And were you -- well, you said you enjoyed it, so I assume you enjoyed\nthe feeling of having power over these people?",
        "A: Well, it wasn't that, it was just having an important job.",
        "Q: Important job, too.",
        "A: And having a lot of the luxuries of -- of, you know, living well.",
        "Q: Right, right, right.",
        "A: I mean there were also the problems of being away from home and living in -- still\nliving in a hostile environment. I mean we weren't -- you know, it was dangerous to walk\ndown the streets alone at night.",
        "Q: You just asked -- you just answered my next question, which really was How\ndangerous or how hostile were these people against the -- well, the allies in general but\nthe United States Army soldiers that were in --",
        "A: Well, they were -- there were always stories about an attack. You know, there were --\nthere were German Army veterans, was Hitler Youth former members, there were true\nbelievers. There were stories that there were attacks on GIs and -- but I don't remember\nInsdg \nthat anybody in our unit was attacked, but -- but we were always careful. I mean I\nremember walk -- walking down the street myself at night, like if I took my girlfriend\nhome, and then I would walk back to my hotel, I would carry a knife.",
        "Q: I see. So one really did need a little bit of protection after all.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You were not welcomed with open arms?",
        "A: Oh, no. Although many of them acted that way.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Well --",
        "A: Oh, yeah, they acted that way.",
        "Q: Well, it probably netted them some chocolate and nylon stockings and other things.",
        "A: That's right, and they were glad the war was over.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, that's for sure.",
        "A: And cigarettes were very important, cigarettes and chocolate and stockings, yeah.",
        "Q: What days these were, oh, my God. I remember them quite well still. Well, I had a\nquestion whether, you know, you had to follow a protocol in this process or whether it\nwas, you know, partially your own instinct to realize who was honest, who was not\nhonest, etcetera? What guided your -- your work more, the protocol that you had to\nfollow or the instinct that you felt when confronting some of these fragebogen?",
        "A: Probably both. You know, for instance if there was a contradiction in dates or\nfunctions or -- see I -- I didn't -- I wasn't an evaluator myself, I was the head of the unit,\nso the evaluator would come to me with a question. They would say here's -- here's a\nInsdg \nfragebogen where this guy answers this and this place and that on that place and it looks\nlike a contradiction and so on, so they would come to me with questions.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "A: But they would -- they would do the evaluations, I wouldn't, but I would train them.",
        "Q: I see, uh-huh. Now, another question just came to my mind. Most of Germany was\nmobilized into the Army.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And these people that you dealt with were people who were holding office jobs or --\nor were working for the government in a -- in a different capacity.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Not in the Army.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: How did they -- how did they manage to stay out of the Army?",
        "A: I -- I have no idea.",
        "Q: But these guys, in other words, had -- that you were dealing with had not been in -- in\nthe military in the Wehrnacht?",
        "A: I'm -- I don't know. I think some were -- some were in both.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Civilian and had been in the Army too.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I don't know. I think they were in the Army and then they were -- this was peace time.",
        "Q: Well, just a few months, yeah, they may have been \u2014\nInsdg ",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- demobilized by that time?",
        "A: Right. So maybe the records show that they were in the Nazi party and then they were\nin the Army and now they were out in a job and they were being screened in the job.",
        "Q: Now, how often did you come across or did they honestly --",
        "A: How what?",
        "Q: How often did you come across somebody who honestly said that he was a member of\nthe SS?",
        "A: Oh, nobody.",
        "Q: Nobody, I see.",
        "A: No. We didn't come -- we didn't come across many SS. I think they were picked up by\nother intelligence. Maybe they were picked up before -- before they got to us.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I don't remember many -- I don't remember many SS members.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I remember some SR members --",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, that was the forerunner.",
        "A: Sturmabteilung.",
        "Q: Well, they were the forerunners to the SS actually, I guess.",
        "A: Yeah, they were the brown shirts.",
        "Q: Yeah, the beginning of the whole business.",
        "A: Yeah.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: Okay. How did it affect you as a Jew to be put into this position, to work with Nazis\nand trying to sort of get them back on a normal footing on the -- on the non-Nazi lifestyle\nor non-Nazi outlook.",
        "A: Well, I was -- I was certainly motivated.",
        "Q: As a Jew.",
        "A: Yes. I was glad to pay them back.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I was glad to see justice being done.",
        "Q: What happened, by the way, to those people that were fired from their jobs and did not\n-- could not be re-employed in -- into the government?",
        "A: Yeah, that's a good question, I don't know. We -- we always wondered about that,\nwhat happened to them.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Maybe they -- they just did some -- some kind of business by themselves.",
        "Q: Well, this was -- Germany has always been a big bureaucratic --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- structure, but \u2014",
        "A: Maybe this went into some kind of business or got jobs in a business where --",
        "Q: But you don't -- you don't know what \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: I mean unless they ended up in prison. I suppose some of these people had a record or\n-- arecord came to light --\nInsdg ",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: -- where they actually --",
        "A: They weren't imprisoned. They -- I mean some of them lost their homes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: Well, you said they -- their finances were --",
        "A: Yeah, their bank account was frozen. They were allowed to take out just like $200 a\nmonth, something like that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They were punished.",
        "Q: Not enough.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Not enough, but what can you do. You could have taken a whole nation and cut them\noff from the member of the world like Mr. Morgenthau you wanted to do?",
        "A: By the way, I wanted to ask you \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- kind of a far out question.",
        "Q: That's okay.",
        "A: I have written a novel based on my experience there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It's called The Finishing Touch.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nInsdg ",
        "A: And it's about the nazification, and it has a love story woven in and out of it, but, you\nknow, it's about an American who falls in love with a German woman and the German\nwoman has two brothers, one of whom was in the -- notorious Nazi and the -- and one --\none died, and the one who was the Nazi takes on the identity of the one who died and\ntries to pass as the one who died and so there is this intrigue about who -- which -- which\nbrother is this --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- and trying to trace and find out so on. It's a suspense novel. And I would like to find\na publisher or an agent for it.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Oh, my goodness. That is very very intriguing. You did that in recent years?",
        "A: I just wrote it. I just finished it.",
        "Q: How lovely. That's really quite an undertaking.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Well, that's always very, very difficult to find a publisher, but I suppose you could\napproach a number of, you know, known publishers and send them the manuscript. I\nguess that's how you go about it \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- or you can go through some of the universities publish books.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: But I don't know whether -- you know, as a novel, but it's really a historic novel, I\nassume\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah, it's a historical novel. It's all about the kinds of things that we talked about.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: Right. Okay. So possibly some of the universities might be interested. I mean you\nhave to start somewhere and usually, you know, one person gives you an idea and\nanother person and eventually you may --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- find somebody who does -- sounds fascinating to me.",
        "A: Well, it's related Holocaust museum, that's why I asked you.",
        "Q: We don't do any publishing.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: We don't do any publishing.",
        "A: Oh, I see.",
        "Q: We have a book steward that sells novels and mostly authentic stories about the\nHolocaust --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- but these are all published books, but we do not -- we in the museum do not publish\nbooks, but you --",
        "A: Oh, by the way, when I was in the infantry, we had opened -- we had opened a\nconcentration camp as -- I was in Patton's Army as we swept across France, Germany and\nAustria and it was almost like a different town every-- every day the advance was so fast",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but we-- we came upon a Mauthausen.",
        "Q: Oh, yeah, yeah.\nInsdg ",

        "Q: Oh. You mean one of the subcamps?",
        "A: Subcamps, right.",
        "Q: Yeah, uh-huh.",
        "A: And that was interesting.",
        "Q: I bet. And you found survivors there?",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah. Lots of people were -- were there and we opened the gates and they streamed\nout --",

        "A: Some dropped dead.",
        "Q: -- in Austria or was that in Germany?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Mauthausen, was on the German side or Austrian?",
        "A: I think it was -- I thought it was German.",
        "Q: Could be, I'm not sure.",
        "A: I mean our unit went farther west -- I mean farther east --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- than any other.",
        "Q: So how long were you in the Army?",
        "A: We met the Russians near Styer, Austria. I was in the Army for three years.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: You enlisted or you --",
        "A: Yeah, I enlisted. I enlisted in '41 \u2014",
        "Q: After Pearl Harbor.",
        "A: -- and then they had a program where you could stay in college.",
        "Q: Oh, oh, I see, uh-huh.",
        "A: And so I didn't -- actually didn't go in until '43.",
        "Q: I see, I see. Well, those were the worst years, I guess.",
        "A: '43 and '46. And then I was -- I was put in the infantry.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So -- but I was -- I was put in classification, so I was the head of the classification part\nof the infantry regiment, which is a personnel, so --",
        "Q: So you saw a lot of battle though?",
        "A: A lot of what?",
        "Q: Battle. I mean active warfare.",
        "A: I saw a lot of what?",
        "Q: Of active warfare, of battles.",
        "A: Warfare?",
        "Q: Yeah. I mean you were in the trenches, so to say?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, yeah, right. No, I saw a lot, but I was not in -- I was not actually in the front\nline. I was in service -- service company, which 1s -- which is in -- it's an infantry\nregiment, but it's -- but it's -- it's -- it's the clerks and the drivers and the supply people --",
        "Q: I see, okay.\nInsdg ",
        "A: -- and so on, SO we were -- we were a little behind. We were not in -- in the foxholes.",
        "Q: I see. Did you -- you had a staff that worked with you, yeah?",
        "A: In -- in denazification?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: How large a staff would you say did you have?",
        "A: Oh, there were 35 people altogether.",
        "Q: I see, uh-huh. And you were the -- you were the supervisor --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- of these 35 people?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And they had to report back to you of their findings, --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- etcetera?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And who were they mostly, they \u2014",
        "A: They were mostly Germans and DPs.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. Not the American soldiers?",
        "A: There were -- there were a few American soldiers, but they were not the evaluators.\nThe evaluators were all German speaking.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And --\nInsdg ",
        "Q: So they were Germans out of the population of Germany?",
        "A: Some -- some were Germans and some were DPs from -- from other countries.",
        "Q: But spoke German\u2019?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. And DPs, also Jewish DPs?",
        "A: There were a few, but most of the DPs were not Jewish.",
        "Q: I see, uh-huh. Well, that's interesting.",
        "A: There were a few -- I remember there was a Polish -- couple of Polish Jews, there\nwere a couple that were in concentration camps, and then there were others that were\nhidden or escaped, but the majority were not Jewish, but there were some Jews.",
        "Q: How long do you -- would you say that this whole program last?",
        "A: Well, as I understand -- as I understand, it didn't last much longer after I left. That\nsomehow with the new government they changed the thing, maybe the whole program\nlasted a year or a year and a half.",
        "Q: I see. So that's not very -- no, I -- excuse me. I remember as a teenager hearing about\nthis -- papers were full of this denazification, denazification, but I don't think that we ever\nhad really a concept of what that really involved. I think perhaps, maybe only in my own\nmind, I thought that really was kind of a -- how shall I say, yeah, a curriculum, that's\nprobably the right way of --",
        "A: Oh, uh-huh.",
        "Q: I thought it was like a curriculum of changing these people's outlook.",
        "A: Oh, no.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: But you're telling me now that this was not it at all.",
        "A: No, it was never -- it was never like that.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: It was political screening.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Cleansing of job holding. But I think they -- I think they let Nazis back in because\nthey needed them.",
        "Q: They did.",
        "A: They needed their job skills. And also the whole scientific and technical \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- development.",
        "Q: And then you had the scientists that they needed.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What were the dynamics between your team members?",
        "A: And?",
        "Q: No, I said the dynamics between your team members, among themselves, the 35 or\nwhatever, yeah, especially in view of what you just told me that there were DP people\nand there were Germans and then there was the Army, so how did all that work?",
        "A: It was -- it was fine. I mean everybody worked together, everybody seemed to --\neverybody got along --",
        "Q: Even --",
        "A: Everybody had stories to tell about their own hardships.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: Well, that I would believe, yeah. Do you remember some of those stories or some of\nthose hardships that people were talking about?",
        "A: Well, as I said, a couple were in concentration camps.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Some, you know, had to leave their homes and travel --escaped, were in hiding for\nmany years.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: No, I -- as I recall, everybody got along fine. There were no frictions.",
        "Q: Even among the people who were in the concentration camp and the Germans that\nthey were --",
        "A: Well, the Germans on our staff were anti-Nazis.",
        "Q: Yeah, that I can understand, sure.",
        "A: So that was okay.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. But among themselves they got along, you say?",
        "A: Yeah. Seems to me they got along fine. I don't know.",
        "Q: I mean you did not notice any frictions?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Well, I guess maybe they were all out to do the same thing.",
        "A: Yeah, exactly. No, we were all doing an important job, we -- we realized that, and it\nwas -- it was Nazi hunting, and, you know, somebody would find a fragebogen that\nwould have a contradiction in it or show something or -- or some -- something would\ncome up from the record center showing that somebody that we had screened turned out\nInsdg \nto be an important Nazi office holder, they would come into my office and hold it up like\nvictory. Yeah, look what we found.",
        "Q: I can imagine, yeah.",
        "A: That was -- those were the high spots was discovering somebody who had been\ncheating or finding a --",
        "Q: Do you -- well, I can imagine that that was regarded as a major victory.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Well, I don't know whatever we -- we try to do, I hope we accomplished this in some\nway or other.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was this an emotional situation for you?",
        "A: Yeah, somewhat, I guess.",
        "Q: As an American or as a Jew?",
        "A: Well, my family did not -- my -- my parents and grandparents did not come from\nGermany, they had -- they had -- they were American immigrants, they came from\nRussia.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And they came a lot earlier, so they were not affected by what was going on in\nGermany with Hitler. But everybody, of course, was very involved and very interested\nand cared a lot about what was happening in Germany, so my -- my work there in\nmilitary government was -- was highly respected.",
        "Q: I can imagine, yeah. That I can imagine. Well, I --\nInsdg ",

        "Q: There was --",
        "A: -- it went back into German hands.",
        "Q: Yeah. That's really too bad. I didn't -- must confess that I did not realize it, but then at\nthat point I had come to the United States \u2014",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: -- and I guess, you know, your -- you start a new life and a new language and a new\neverything, and somehow you leave these horrible events of the past behind.",

        "A: That's good.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yes, it is, and it's not much known, not well known at all. And in fact, you\nknow, I speak in many places, in schools, etcetera, to talk about that part of history.",

        "Q: You weren\u2019t angry",
        "A: Just the army, that\u2019s all. I mean you know what, I figured that\u2019s just normal and when I\ngot orders to go to the 71\u201c light division, I did look up what a light division was in the camp\nlibrary. And it said jungle, mountain, mule pack, amphibious and paratroop.",
        "Q: And what did you think when you saw that.",
        "A: and then I, then I said god I don\u2019t want any of those and then it turned out to be a\nInsdg \ncombination of two of them, jungle and mountain. But you know my son was a paratrooper so",

        "Q: It wasn\u2019t his time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Because you were not drafted, you were a volunteer, did you enjoy any perks, was there\nanything given to you as a reward for that or you were just treated the same.",
        "A: My impression was that there were a lot of enlisted personnel in our outfit because it was\nan old Panama outfit. It was a regular army outfit fixed infantry.",
        "Q: So those were not draftees.",
        "A: No but, but then there were draftees too so there were both.\nQ; There was no distinction between an enlistee and a draftee",
        "A: Well I think the newer ones, like the ones who were drafted along with me, would, we\nwere different you know coming from cities or with more education than these other guys that",
        "Q: But the system didn\u2019t treat you differently",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: This man recognizes you in the fox hole, this is your big breakthrough moment. He takes\nyou where, where do you end up?",
        "A: In the service company, the same regiment but instead of company F which is a line\ncompany and I was a mortar, I was a 16 millimeter mortar ammunition bearer and I thought that\nI was lucky to get that, to get that assignment because a mortar squad 1s a little behind the lines\ncause you have to shoot over you know and but I was, there were 7 ammunition bearers 1n a\nmortar squad. 5, 5 or 7 I don\u2019t\u2019 remember and I was tail end.

        "Q: In this company",
        "A: No, yeah. right.",
        "Q: Are you still in Colorado at that point?",
        "A: No we moved to we changed to a full division from a light division so I think that\u2019s why I\ngot the job in service company because it expanded everything expanded. And classification\nspecialist I guess was created or I don\u2019t know whether it was there before.

        "Q: So when you enlist this is 43, you do 13 weeks of basic training, so 13 weeks what 1s that,\nthat\u2019s about 3 months. So you\u2019re in the fall of 43 and then you\u2019re going into then you go to\nColorado, cause basic training is California, did I get this right, I did. Texas, Texas is basic\nInsdg \ntraining.

We were just strolling\nand we came across this camp. and we opened the door and out poured prisoners and some of\nthem were so looked like skeletons and one, one called to me in Yiddish and said I\u2019m one of you\nand I\u2019m one of you.",
        "Q: So the prisoner said I\u2019m one of you. how did he know that you spoke Yiddish. Or",
        "A: He didn\u2019t. I guess I looked Jewish.",
        "Q: And so hear this",
        "A: He said hober rach mones? Have pity, have sympathy.",
        "Q: And what did you do when you heard that.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t, I nothing. I just I mean you know we had a rifle and a steel helmet and we were\nin full gear and, and they stumbled out and he, he dropped. And I think he dropped dead. And\nthere were some who dropped dead and some just started flowing out so we ran back to our unit\nto try to get medics and to try to get everybody involved.",
        "Q: but this was not the first time you had seen people in the striped uniforms",
        "A: No we had seen others. Before.",
        "Q: How frequently had you seen them. Just a few incidents\nA; Yeah.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: and those incidents were, I understand you probably don\u2019t\u2019 remember the exact location\nbut what was, was it in a field or on a road or in a other camp were they concentrated. Was it\nmany people, few people?",
        "A: I think it was few.",
        "Q: So you had come across these people in the striped clothing",
        "A: I think so yeah.",
        "Q: And you had known what about them exactly at that time.",
        "A: that they were concentration camp prisoners",
        "Q: and you knew about concentration camps because",
        "A: Because I had read about them.",
        "Q: In where?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know maybe, maybe the Yanks paper, maybe the GI paper or I knew about\nconcentration camps from the time I was a civilian.",
        "Q: But would you, would you know of that the striped uniform is what a concentration camp\ninmate wears.",
        "A: I think so.",
        "Q: Did the army ever brief you on who these people are or what to expect about these\npeople.",
        "A: I think they did. I think there was some discussion about it.",
        "Q: Do you have any concrete examples, any details.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t. no. the military government we learned a lot about it.",
        "Q: But that was after having liberated",
        "A: That was later.",
        "Q: So when you happened upon this camp your idea of what you\u2019re seeing is what",
        "A: You know I\u2019m a little confused about prisoners of, German prisoners of war that were\nhuddled together in trucks and they were carrying, they were driven away from where they were\ncaptured and prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners in the striped uniforms in trucks.\nInsdg \nSeems to me that I saw them in trucks too but I\u2019m not sure what they were rescued or carried and\nwhen we asked some of them on the roads. And I don\u2019t\u2019 know. I just felt that I knew about\nconcentration camps and prisoners well before that time and that we saw some.",
        "Q: So as you were describing you opened the gates. Were the gates locked",
        "A: No",
        "Q: So you could just turn a handle and open it.",
        "A: yeah",
        "Q: Why had they not opened",
        "A: And the guards were all gone. The guards had left already and they took all the food.",
        "Q: Do you know why they had not opened it? the gate",
        "A: No",
        "Q: Cause it seems to me you\u2019re saying",
        "A: Yeah the other guy and I lifted 1t and opened it and I said my god we opened it.",
        "Q: Do you remember the other guy\u2019s name?",
        "A: No, I have been trying to think of it and I can\u2019t remember. I remember what he looked\nlike. He was also in service company. He, I don\u2019t\u2019 know whether he was a clerk of some sort or\nbut",
        "Q: So you opened the gate and this is when you hear the man speaking Yiddish.",
        "A: He, he started coming out.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts when you heard that. have pity",
        "A: I just felt touched. Moved.",
        "Q: the fact that he was speaking Yiddish",
        "A: Yeah and that he was so, so thin.",
        "Q: So did you immediately decide to go back to your company",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you at that point you were not interacting with any other prisoners\nInsdg ",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: How long did it take you to go back to the company",
        "A: Oh immediately. WE, we turned around and ran back when we saw all the, all these\npeople.",
        "Q: and what did you tell your company, what had you just seen.",
        "A: That we opened a concentration camp and take over.",
        "Q: Ok and what did they do",
        "A: They did. As I recall they went there and they evacuated the prisoners.",
        "Q: Did you go back with them.",
        "A: It was amb, you know they got ambulances and they got yeah I well, I don\u2019t\u2019 remember\ntoo much after that. Where we, where we, we were assigned to something else right away or",
        "Q: So did you ever go back to Mauthausen during that period.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: There was just that one interaction of, \u2019'm sorry Gunskirchen. That one situation where\nyou\u2019re opening the gate and then you immediately went back to the company so you did not\nenter the camp.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And you must have been there just a few minutes.",
        "A: May, yeah.",
        "Q: How many people did you see",
        "A: Maybe dozens in the background. They smelled of death.",
        "Q: Tell me about the smell",
        "A: It just had that awful smell.",
        "Q: What was it reminiscent of",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. it smelled bad and people said that\u2019s the smell of death.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: Which people",
        "A: the guys inthe army. I just don\u2019t\u2019 remember too much of that.",
        "Q: What was the weather like that day. Was it raining",
        "A: It was not raining, no.",
        "Q: Was it fairly warm b then? Or was it a cold spring?\nA; | I don\u2019t\u2019 remember that. I think it was fairly, it must I don\u2019t know. I know it wasn\u2019t\nraining.\n(end first interview; second interview follows on October 25, 2012 with Dr. Johanna Neumann)\nInsdg \nLESTER MARTIN LIBO\nOctober 25, 2012\nInterviewer: Dr. Johanna Neumann\n(file: RG-50.030.0662.02.02)",
        "Q: This is Holocaust Memorial Museum. Interviewing with Lester Libo, contacted by me,\nby Johanna Neumann, October 25, 2012 in Washington, DC. And this interview is being\nconducted over the phone. And now I am introducing myself to you. I understand that you had\nsome interview already, part of your interview already took place.",
        "A: Yes, it was an interview there, in Washington.",
        "Q:I  Isee ok. Well I think I hope you are comfortable and sitting down and relaxing.",
        "A: Yes, I am.",
        "Q: Ok, very good. Where are you?",
        "A: I am in Albuquerque.",
        "Q: Ah, New Mexico.",
        "A: New Mexico.",
        "Q: That\u2019s where you live",
        "A: Yes",
        "Q: Ok, very good. Well I was very much interested to hear and I also listened a little bit to\nthe original interview. What your function was after World War II. How did you get involved\nwith the de-Nazification and why were you chosen to be part of that program.",
        "A: Well I was, I was in the infantry and we were in occupation in Augsburg and I was just\nbored I guess. And I heard about military government needing people so I applied for a transfer\nand I got it and they transferred me to Regensburg and when I went to, was put into public safety\nspecial branch. And it turned out that the head of de-Nazification, the enlisted man who was the\nhead of, the title was Chief Clerk, that he was leaving in a few days. And I had a few years of\ncollege credit in psychology and I guess they thought that, that I could do it. So I was only 22\nyears old but I wanted it and they thought I could do it. So they trained me to fill his spot.",
        "Q: I suppose it was quite a challenge for you.",
        "A: Yes it was.",
        "Q: Now in this respect, how successful do you think that this program worked out.\nInsdg ",
        "A: Well in our district which was the state was Niederbeir and Oberfaus where Regensburg\nis. We had the highest number of what you call it screenings. We had the highest number of\nevaluations and removals of people from their jobs, Nazis, than anyone else in the US Zone. We\nhad, we were very successful.",
        "Q: When you say successful do you think that it had an impact on the Nazis. To well let\u2019s\nsay never mind repent but that they realized finally how wrong they had gone or how criminal\ntheir government had been or do you think that they did this mostly so that they would be spared\nfrom trials or prison or worse.",
        "A: Well they didn\u2019t do it. We did it. We removed them. We evaluated them. And this is the\nUS government. It wasn\u2019t the Germans.",
        "Q: No, no I understand. I know that. but I was just wondering",
        "A: We removed them from office in important jobs like in the government and in important\njobs, administrative jobs and we removed thousands. And that was our mission. To cleanse the\nnew government of Nazis as much as possible, at the higher levels. I mean at the lower levels,\nthere were many Nazi party members but we kept, if they were, if they had joined the party after\nsummer of 37, they were considered ok.",
        "Q: Because then they were forced.",
        "A: If they hadn\u2019t held any po, any official position.",
        "Q: The reason that you felt that way is because at that point they were forced, whether they\nliked it or not.",
        "A: It was mandatory that they joined.",
        "Q: Right, well my question really my next question actually was who were the individuals\nyou were dealing with and had they been officials during the Nazi regime. So in a way you have\nanswered that already.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You said that they were, they had been in the government",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And you think that those who went into the party after 37, but in their hearts they were\nnot Nazis. Do you think",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know. No I think it was mixed I\u2019m sure. That some believed in it and some\nwere didn\u2019t and were forced into it.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: How do you think what was the reaction on the part of these Germans. They were\nremoved from their office, by the United States military and what was their reaction to being\nchosen to be de-Nazified. I assume that some were beyond that. In other words, that they you\nknow either ended up in prison or could not be used in",
        "A: Oh yeah well the ones who were suspected of being war criminals, we didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t\nprocess them. We turned them over to counter intelligence, you know to intelligence. And but we\ndidn\u2019t deal with those.",
        "Q: So you had good reason to think that the people you were dealing with it was worthwhile\ntrying to change them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah, it didn\u2019t last long though. We understood, I understand that it changed about you\nknow in 1946 I think it was, late 1946. I was there only until May 46. I was there from\nSeptember to May 46. And we were very, we were very aggressive in pursuing Nazis and\ngetting them out of office. And some people I mean I understand the Germans themselves felt\nthat it wasn\u2019t worth doing or something. I don\u2019t know. One I remember one Nazi party official\nthat we removed from office. Said to me that he had his days of glory and now it\u2019s turned over\nso you know it\u2019s wasn\u2019t worth it.",
        "Q: In what language did you interrogate these people. How did you",
        "A: Well I had a German American. I had an American originally from Germany as an\ninterpreter. He was in the army and so he was an interpreter.",
        "Q: By the way have you ever come across the name of an American lawyer by the name of\nKent, no not American, German lawyer by the name of Kempner.",
        "A: Kempner",
        "Q: Kempner. Yeah.",
        "A: Sounds familiar.",
        "Q: Oh because apparently he is was a lawyer who interrogated also these kind of people,\npeople who had been in office, who had held government jobs and trying to find out how much\ndid they know. What was going on. Were they in favor of it or not and so on. And apparently\nhe you know he became quite well known. That\u2019s maybe he was, why the name is familiar to\nyou. Yeah, Kempner is his name. He was German interrogating his own people.",
        "A: Unh hunh.",
        "Q: Ok so did they honestly cooperate or did they just want to escape punishment and\nInsdg \ntherefore participated in the program. What would you think.",
        "A: No. I well they were being investigated. They wanted to get away with, they, I don\u2019t\nthink they cooperated. They were.",
        "Q: They did not cooperate with the American military.",
        "A: Well who were you thinking of. The people who were",
        "Q: The people who were supposed to be de-Nazified.",
        "A: the people who were screened.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: well yeah, filled out the fragebogen and handed it in.",
        "Q: That was my question too. How honest were the answers. How could you assess that.",
        "A: Well that\u2019s an interesting question because a lots, many Germans came from the east\nzone. And there were no records to check on their responses. But in our zone, 1n our area,\nRegensburg itself had an intact record center that had all the Nazi records. So people from the\nlocal area we could check on. So we had so we had a routine check in the record center, in\nRegensburg on everybody. People who came from Poland or east Germany, whatever, we had\nno way of checking on them so of course they were more susp, they were more suspicious.",
        "Q: So you think that some of them really well let me ask you this then. How did you\ndetermine who was to get into the program.",
        "A: Who?",
        "Q: Yeah how did you choose the individuals that you thought would qualify to be in the\nprogram and be de-Nazified.",
        "A: I, [don\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t choose. Somebody chose. Military government, I don\u2019t\u2019\nknow. We were the evaluators, but we didn\u2019t\u2019 do the initial choice.",
        "Q: So you were handed a list of people.",
        "A: yes.",
        "Q: I see. I understand and then you did your best to try and get the Nazi ideology out of\nthem.",
        "A: Well not to get the Nazi ideology out of them but to, to keep the ones that were more\nserious Nazis out of important jobs. I mean we didn\u2019t expect to change their ideology.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: And how did you, you were a young person as you mentioned earlier. How did you feel\nto carry out such a difficult burden. I mean in a way from a human point of view, this is quite a\nhard burden to carry because you decide on somebody\u2019s future in a way.",
        "A: Not at all. It was a joy.",
        "Q: Oh ok.\nA; I was glad to do it. it was a revenge.",
        "Q: Well that I can understand, right. Now how was the",
        "A: You know I\u2019m Jewish.",
        "Q: I know, I know.",
        "A: So I you know I saw that as a good kind of revenge.",
        "Q: I see. And well ok.",
        "A: My interpreter was also Jewish. He was a German Jewish refugee who was in the army.",
        "Q: Yeah well many of them came at an age here to America and then enlisted in the army.\nThat\u2019s right. you know I come from that part of the world too. I am originally from Hamburg.",
        "A: Oh yeah, well that\u2019s in the north.",
        "Q: Ok now what was the procedure. Was this program conducted on one, on a one on one\nbasis or did you have groups at the same time and how exactly did you proceed in this project, in\nthis program of de-Nazification.",
        "A: Well we had the fragebogens. And they would come in and they would have to be\nevaluated. And we had a staff of evaluators that were about 30 people. And there were they\nwent over them and they would come to me with say this one looks suspicious and this one. You\nknow and so on but there were, there were procedures to follow.",
        "Q: I see ok, so you followed a protocol in other words.",
        "A: Yeah",
        "Q: Ok but then and then let\u2019s say now you have chosen 10 or 20 or 30 these individuals. It\nwas conducted like in a classroom or was it conducted on a one to one basis.",
        "A: No, one to one",
        "Q: It was one to one\nInsdg ",
        "A: Well each, each questionnaire was, it was a separate investigation. A separate, a separate\nprocedure for each individual.",
        "Q: I see, and what was the procedure.",
        "A: The procedure was to evaluate their questionnaire and to come up with a rating and there\nwere five categories. You know. you know those five categories. Number one is mandatory\nremoval. Number 2 is discretionary adverse recommendation. Number 3 is discretionary no\nrecommendation. Number 4 1s no evidence of anti, no evidence of Nazi activity. And number 5\nwas evidence of anti-Nazi activity.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And so each individual would get a rating that would be the conclusion and then if they\nwere in the 4 or 5 they would be removed from office or un, not hired and their bank account\nwould be frozen and their property could be seized and used by the allies, by the Americans for\nyou know like homes could be used for troops.",
        "Q: Yeah and how long did such a process take.",
        "A: The evaluation process.\nQ; Yeah.",
        "A: Just, just. It was I don\u2019t\u2019 know. I would say anywhere from an hour to a couple of days.\nIt depended on if there were any complications because we also had a special investigations unit\nthat would look into difficult cases that were you know harder to figure out.",
        "Q: right, right.",
        "A: You know they might go to interrogate some other people or try to get other records or\nwhatever.",
        "Q: Did you interview members of their family or I don\u2019t know",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Or friends or",
        "A: We didn\u2019t necessarily interview them either. Most were, the action in most cases was\ntaken on the basis of the questionnaire alone. We would bring them in for interviews 1f we had\nquestions.",
        "Q: I see. Oh you mean you got the fragebogen that you evaluated, but you didn\u2019t necessarily\nhave the individual in front of you.",
        "A: that\u2019s right.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: I see. I didn\u2019t realize that. Now I suppose I had a different concept somewhat. I thought\nthat after you went through the fragebogen and you decided who was suspicious or wasn\u2019t\nsuspicious, that they somehow got some kind of a I don\u2019t\u2019 want to call it brain washing, but some\nkind of a you know democratic viewpoint or, or",
        "A: Oh no, no it was strictly",
        "Q: Based on their fragebogen.",
        "A: Yeah it was strictly screening. No attempt to change them. or, or argue with them.",
        "Q: And were they cooperative. Were they hostile, antagonistic or",
        "A: Well I would say the main attitude was to try to get out of it. you know to say that they\nwere innocent. You know nicht Nazi, Nicht Nazi was, was their motto. There was",
        "Q: That was easy to say.",
        "A: There was one case I remember where this man said that he understands that the tables\nare turned and he had his days of glory and now his side had lost and he\u2019s prepared to take the\nconsequences. And he you know he said well we had our day and now you have your day. Well\nthat was very unusual.",
        "Q: To admit that.",
        "A: To do that. Most of them were made excuses. You know and they said they were forced\nand that they were not really a Nazi and so on. And of course the people from, who came from\neast Germany there was no way to check.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the other big problem in Nazi mind. So I was, one of the questions I had in my\nmind was, was there any material use during this process. But I guess it wasn\u2019t cause I had a\ndifferent concept of it at all. You know I thought there were lectures being given on democracy\nor lectures",
        "A: Oh no. there was not attempt to change anybody. It was completely screening.",
        "Q: And at the least suspicious back into the work force.",
        "A: To what",
        "Q: I said and then to get the least suspicious individuals back into the working force.",
        "A: Yeah well to allow them to continue in their jobs. Or to be hired.",
        "Q: I understand, yeah. Ok let\u2019s see now. What qualifications did you have or were required\nin order to be part of this process.\nInsdg ",
        "A: Well I was a college student. I was a psychology major and I also had experience\nworking in personnel administration. So I had administrative experience.",
        "Q: I see. And were you in charge of this particular program.",
        "A: yes I was well, I was an enlisted man. I was a ser, a sergeant. The person in charge of the\nwhole thing was an officer. A captain. And he and there was also a lieutenant. So I remember\nthere were 2 American officers that were in charge, but the day to day work was done by the day\nto day work of being in charge, I mean, was done by an enlisted man. And my predecessor was\nthe one who was being discharged. He was also a Jewish guy from the states. And I was put in to\nlearn, learn the ropes. And learn the job. That he did. Heading up the staff. Supervising the\nstaff.",
        "Q: I see, So you were in a supervisory position.",
        "A: Yes. The title was chief clerk",
        "Q: Good, very good. Were the Germans that participated under oath. When I say those who\nsent out the fragebogen and was there anywhere where they had to I don\u2019t know sign that like\nwe say here in the United States.",
        "A: I think, I think they signed it, they had, when they signed it, it said it, I think it probably\nsaid in there that something about",
        "Q: But they were not on any verbal oath or anything like that.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: I think they got away with too much. Well that was another question I had. How could\nyou be sure that what they put down in their fragebogen was an honest answer, but I think you\nanswered that already. And you could check it unless they came from the east.",
        "A: Yeah",
        "Q: Yeah well. That\u2019s of course a big problem but and that I guess wasn\u2019t really eliminated\nuntil the 90s right when they got records. What did you hope to achieve with this de-\nNazification program.",
        "A: Cleansing. Well to keep the new Germany, the new German government more\ndemocratic. And, and not, not back in the hands of the Nazis.",
        "Q: And do you think you succeeded.",
        "A: We succeeded in, in our job. We understand that the new German government kind of\nweakened and we had heard that Nazis were being kept or hired again.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: And that was under Adenauer or",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well I guess you were dealing here with what 52 million people or however many",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. so you told me already where you were located right. And in Regensburg or\nwhere was it.",
        "A: Regensburg.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s where your work was located, in that part of Bavaria.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How long did you work in this capacity.",
        "A: I was there from September of 45 to May of 46.",
        "Q: At the time that was in a DP camp in Italy.",
        "A: Oh",
        "Q: Well beyond that even and so August I guess of 46. Ok. What are some of the most\nmemorable incidents that you remember from that period. You already told me about the guy\nwho said you had your day. I mean we had our day, now you have your day. I\u2019m sure you came\nacross a number of other memorable incidents with these people.",
        "A: Well I think one was when the statistics came out to show that we had the highest number\nof removals in the whole US zone.",
        "Q: The highest removal. Yeah",
        "A: The highest number.",
        "Q: Well Bavaria is sort of Hitler country, perhaps that\u2019s why. Munich that\u2019s part of it.",
        "A: Also we had heard that the British were sitting and having tea with the Nazis and that the\nFrench I don\u2019t know, the French were either a very vengeful or just didn\u2019t care but that the\nUnited States forces were the most serious about de Nazification so we were proud that we were\ndoing a good job.",
        "Q: Ok but specifically on a one to one from an individual did you have any memorable\nincidents. That occurred with you know you speaking to any of these people or in conversation\nor\nInsdg ",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember any specific.",
        "Q: I see. Now you think that the program was effective.",
        "A: Well it was effective while we were doing it but 1t was overturned. You know it was\nwatered down and then it was done away with.",
        "Q: How soon would you think was it watered down. I think that really is also important\npoint because was there already a new younger generation coming in or",
        "A: No it was not while we were there. it was after. We heard that it was done afterward.\nProbably in late 46.",
        "Q: What that they overturned this program.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I heard.",
        "Q: Unh hunh. Well any other highlights that you remember during this period. I mean some\nreally heavy duty Nazis that were discovered in this way. I assume that perhaps through the\nfragebogen you did discover some",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Anybody specific",
        "A: No I can\u2019t remember it. any big, big name.",
        "Q: Yeah I mean really big shots.",
        "A: No I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: What about how was it justified that some of the Nazis signed this et cetera, ended up\nhere.",
        "A: Oh I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know anything about that. I guess United States needed them.",
        "Q: Or they would have fallen into the hands of the, of the other side.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you think, now let me ask you this. what are some of the strengths or weaknesses of\nthis program.",
        "A: Well I think the weakness was not, not having record centers, not having records on\npeople who came from other areas.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: You\u2019re right, right.",
        "A: Other than that I think it was done very well. You know and was serious. People were\nremoved and gradually jobs were, were given to people who were not Nazis. There weren\u2019t\nmany there weren\u2019t many around you know. there was practically everybody was in the Nazi\nparty because of the mandatory membership. From 37 on.",
        "Q: Not that I realize and that\u2019s of course very difficult to make this distinction. And then to\nbe sure that yeah, really difficult. Did you were you able to obtain lists of Nazi party members.",
        "A: If I recall there was one time when somebody uncovered a record or a list of, of members\nthat we could check against, against our applicants. It was kind of a surprise treasure that was\nuncovered.",
        "Q: I can imagine yeah. and probably to the great disappointment of some of the people.",
        "A: Yeah right.",
        "Q: there you have it black on white.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I had a question of how were the candidates for de Nazification chosen.",
        "A: It was a routine thing on their job. It was because of what, what poss, I guess to. I guess\nit was you know everybody in certain jobs in the government or in important positions in the\nsociety.",
        "Q: that you really needed in order to",
        "A: We didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t\u2019 select them. they were we received, we received them. Somebody\nelse selected them.",
        "Q: Made the selection. Now when you say somebody else, you mean from among the allies,\nnot from within the Germans themselves.",
        "A: I guess so. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t\u2019 really know. it might be that an order went in from military\ngovernment that everybody in a certain industry had to submit a fragebogen.",
        "Q: Isee. So really everything all the, all the selection and I hate to use that word for\nobvious reasons, but let\u2019s just use it for lack of a better word. So all the selections were really\nbased entirely on the fragebogen.",
        "A: On the all the selections.",
        "Q: Yeah who was going to be de Nazified or not\nInsdg ",
        "A: Oh. Well it started with the fragebogen and then if there were questions or suspicions\nthen, then there would be interviews, and further investigations.",
        "Q: Did you do all the interviews yourself as well.",
        "A: Did what",
        "Q: Did you do personally some of the interviews yourself or",
        "A: No we had an American GI originally from Germany who was a special investigator and\nhe would, he would do them.",
        "Q: He would do the",
        "A: The interviews. And he would look into and he would do further investigation.",
        "Q: I see so it really was a whole teamwork.",
        "A: Oh yeah, absolutely.",
        "Q: Now the work load must have been overwhelming. As you said before, you\u2019re dealing\nwith a whole nation.",
        "A: Well we only had one state.",
        "Q: now this, that\u2019s a good answer because that brings me to another question. Did you, did\nthe United States have such programs all over Germany.",
        "A: Yes. Yes it was the whole US zone was divided into areas and all of them had the same\nkind of thing we did.",
        "Q: I see, I see",
        "A: And we were just one, we were just in one state.",
        "Q: The Niederbier yeah. I see so this really was a well-organized undertaking.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: I mean so what would you say roughly. How many people in your sector or in your\nsection were involved in this. Germans I mean",
        "A: Oh the population.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I, I don\u2019t know. A million, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: Well it was a vast undertaking. When you talk about the Americans having done that.\nAnd I was not aware of that either, that this was not an allied undertaking. I always was under\nthe impression that this was a cooperative undertaking.",
        "A: NO this was American. And the others had their own systems.",
        "Q: Did they also call it de Nazification",
        "A: I don\u2019t\u2019 think so. I don\u2019t\u2019 know what they had. I mean we had heard that the British were\nhaving tea with the Nazis and the French were just wrecking their stores and homes.",
        "Q: So not a",
        "A: Oh and the Russians were terrible you know. Everybody ran away from the Russians and\nsaid that they were monsters. They were so vengeful at the destruction that the Germans did of\nRussia.",
        "Q: Well and also a lot of Russians died because of that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So let me ask you this. What would you say how did this experience affect you as a\nyoung person, in such a responsible position you know which involved really impacting the\ncourse of people\u2019s lives. Were you aware of your power. Were you troubled by the fact that you\ndid not have experience in that area.",
        "A: No, actually I think it matured me. I enjoyed it. we lived well. I mean we had a hotel\nroom. We had a, we had a you know we lived in a hotel. We had dances. We had an orchestra.\nWe had a bar. We [had a girlfriend. We had a chauffeur to go wherever we wanted to like to a\nplay or an opera. Or aconcert. It was a, it was a very educational experience. I mean I was so\nyoung, I had 3 years of college credit, which I had done in 2 years and so you know",
        "Q: Did you pursue psychology in the end.",
        "A: Yes, yeah I went on and got a PhD in psychology.",
        "Q: Very nice, lovely. Well so you were telling me that so close after the war ended, this\nhorrible war, they had already concerts, theater, opera and dances and everything else.",
        "A: Yep.",
        "Q: I guess people are very resilient.",
        "A: Yes. Well Regensburg wasn\u2019t wrecked as much as some other cities.",
        "Q: Yeah I know, but Hamburg was destroyed by 75%\nInsdg ",
        "A: Bombing.",
        "Q: yeah and were you, you said you enjoyed it. so I assume you enjoyed the feeling of\nhaving power over these people.",
        "A: Well it wasn\u2019t that. 1t was just having an important job. And having a lot of luxuries of,\nof you know living well. I knew there were also the problems of being away from home and\nliving in you know still living in a hostile environment. I mean we weren\u2019t you know it was, it\nwas dangerous to walk down the streets alone at night.",
        "Q: You just answered my next question which really was how dangerous or how hostile\nwere these people against the well the allies in general but the United States army soldiers that\nwere in",
        "A: Well there were, there were always stories about an attack. You know there were, there\nwere German army veterans. There was Hitler Youth, former members that were true believers.\nThere were stories that there were attacks on GIs and but I don\u2019t\u2019 remember that anybody in our\nunit was attacked. But we were always careful. I mean I rambler walk, walking down the street,\nmyself at night like if I took my girlfriend home and then I would walk back to my hotel, I would\ncarry a knife.",
        "Q: I see so you really did need a bit of protection after all.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You were not welcomed with open arms.",
        "A: Oh no. although many of them acted that way. oh yeah they acted that way.",
        "Q: Well it probably netted them some chocolate and nylon stockings and other things.",
        "A: That\u2019s right and they were glad the war was over. And cigarettes were very important,\ncigarettes and chocolate and stockings yeah.",
        "Q: What days these were. Oh my god. I remember them quite well still. I had a question\nwhether you had to follow a protocol in this process or whether it was you know partially your\nown instinct to realize who was honest, who was not honest, et cetera. What guided your work\nmore, the protocol that you had to follow or the instinct that you felt when confronting some of\nthese fragebogen.",
        "A: Probably both. You know for instance if there was a contradictions in dates or functions.\nSee I didn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t an evaluator myself. I was a head of the unit so the evaluator would come\nto me with a question. They would say here is, here is this fragebogen where this guy answers\nthis on this place in that and that place and it looks like a contradiction and so on. so they would\ncome to me with questions. But they would, they would do the evaluations. I wouldn\u2019t. But I\nwould train them.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: A question just came to my mind. Most of Germany was mobilized into the army.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And these people that you dealt with were people who were holding office jobs or, or\nwere working for the government in a different capacity, not in the army.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: How did they manage to stay out of the army.",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "Q: but these guys in other words had that you were dealing with had not been in, in the\nmilitary in the Wehrmacht.",
        "A: I don\u2019t\u2019 know. I think some were, some were. In both. Civilian and had been in the army\ntoo. I don\u2019t know. I think they were in the army and then they were this was peace time.",
        "Q: Well just a few months, yeah they may have been demobilized by that time.",
        "A: Right so maybe the records show that they were in the Nazi party and then they were in\nthe army and now they were out in ajob. And they were being screened 1n the job.",
        "Q: how often did you come across or did they honestly",
        "A: how what",
        "Q: How often did you come across somebody who honestly said that he was a member of\nthe SS.",
        "A: Oh none, nobody.",
        "Q: Nobody, I see\nA; No, we didn\u2019t come we didn\u2019t\u2019 come across many SS. I think they were picked up by\nother intelligence but maybe they were picked up before, before they got to us. I don\u2019t\u2019\nremember many, I don\u2019t\u2019 remember many SS members. I remember some SA members.",
        "Q: Yes well that was a forerunner.",
        "A: Sturm aftilung",
        "Q: Yes, well they were the forerunners to the SS actually I guess.",
        "A: Yeah they were the brown shirts.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: Yeah the beginning of the whole business.",
        "A: yeah.",
        "Q: Ok. How did it affect you as a Jew to be put into this position to work with Nazis and\ntrying to sort of get them back on the normal footing, on the, on the non-Nazi life style. Well\nnon-Nazi outlook.",
        "A: Well I was certainly motivated",
        "Q: AS a Jew.",
        "A: Yes. I was glad to pay them back and I was glad to see justice being done.",
        "Q: What happened by the way to those people that were fired from their jobs and did not\ncould not be reemployed and enter the government.",
        "A: yeah that\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t know. we always wondered about that. what\nhappened to them. maybe they, they just did some kind of business by themselves.",
        "Q: Well this was Germany has always been a big bureaucratic structure.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: but",
        "A: Maybe they went into some kind of business or got a job in a business where",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t\u2019, you don\u2019t know what I mean unless they ended up in prison. I suppose\nsome of these people had a record or a record came where they actually",
        "A: They weren\u2019t in prisons. They I mean some of them lost their homes. And",
        "Q: well you said they, their finances were",
        "A: yeah their bank account was frozen. They were allowed to take out just like $200 a\nmonth, something like that. they were punished.",
        "Q: Not enough.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Not enough but what can you do. You could have taken a whole nation and cut them off\nfrom the map of the world like Mr. Morgenthau wanted to do.",
        "A: By the way I wanted to ask you. kind of a far out question.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: Yes, ok.",
        "A: I have written a novel based on my experience there. it\u2019s called the Finishing Touch and\nit\u2019s about de-Nazification. And it has a love story woven in and out of it. but you know it\u2019s\nabout an American who falls in love with a German woman and the German woman has two\nbrothers. One of whom was a notorious Nazi and the and one died. And the one who was the\nNazi took, takes on the identity of the one who died and tries to pass as the one who died. And so\nthere is this intrigue about who which, which brother is this and trying to trace and find out and\nso on, so. It\u2019s a suspense novel. And I would like to find a publisher or an agent for it.",
        "Q: oh my goodness. Sounds really very intriguing. You did that in recent years.",
        "A: I just wrote it. I just finished it.",
        "Q: how lovely. Well that\u2019s really a quite an undertaking.",
        "A: yes.",
        "Q: Well that\u2019s always very, very difficult to find a publisher but I suppose you could\napproach a number of you know known publishers and send them the manuscript.. I guess that\u2019s\nhow you go about it. or you can go through some of the universities publish books. But I\ndon\u2019t\u2019 know whether you know, as a novel, but it\u2019s really a historic novel I assume.",
        "A: Yeah it\u2019s a historical novel. It tells all about these kind of things that we talked about.",
        "Q: So possibly some of the universities might be interested. I mean you have to start\nsomewhere and usually you know one person gives you an idea and another person and\neventually you may find somebody who does, sounds fascinating to me.",
        "A: Well it\u2019s related to the Holocaust Museum. That\u2019s why I asked you.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah right. well we don\u2019t\u2019 do any publishing. We have a book store that sells you\nknow novels and mostly authentic stories about the Holocaust. And but these are all published\nbook but we do not, we in the museum do not publish books.",
        "A: By the way when I was in the infantry we had opened a, we had opened a concentration\ncamp as, I was in Patton\u2019s army as we swept across France, Germany and Austria. And was\nalmost like a different town every, every day. The advance was so fast. But we, we came upon a\nMauthausen and our unit opened one of the camps of Mauthausen.",
        "Q: You mean one of the sub camps.",
        "A: Yeah the sub camps. Right. and that was interesting.",
        "Q: I bet. And you found survivors there.\nInsdg ",
        "A: Oh yeah. Yeah. Lots of people, it\u2019s were, were there. we opened the gates and they\nstreamed out.",
        "Q: Mauthausen, was that in Austria or was it in Germany. Mauthausen was on the German\nside or Austrian.",
        "A: I, I think it, I thought it was German. But",
        "Q: Could be, I don\u2019t\u2019 know. I\u2019m not sure.",
        "A: I mean our unit went farther west, farther east than any other.",
        "Q: So how long were you in the army.",
        "A: We, we met the Russians in, near Stier Austria. I was in the army for 3 years.",
        "Q: You enlisted or you",
        "A: Yeah I enlisted. I enlisted in 41.",
        "Q: After Pearl Harbor",
        "A: And then they had a program where you could stay in college. And so I didn\u2019t actually\ndidn\u2019t actually go in until 43.",
        "Q: I see. Those were the worst years I guess.",
        "A: 43 and 46. And then I was I was put in the infantry. So but I was put in classification so\nI was the head of the classification part of the infantry regiment which is a personnel so",
        "Q: So you saw a lot of battle though",
        "A: A lot of what",
        "Q: Battle. I mean active warfare.",
        "A: I saw a lot of what.",
        "Q: Of active warfare. Of, of battles.",
        "A: Warfare.",
        "Q: Yeah, I mean you were in the trenches.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah right. No I saw a lot but I was not in, I was not actually in the front line. I\nwas in service, service company which is, which is in, it\u2019s an infantry regiment but it\u2019s, it\u2019s the\nclerks and the drivers and the supply people so we were, we were a little behind. we were not in\nInsdg \nthe foxholes.",
        "Q: I see. Did you, you had a staff that worked with you, yes.",
        "A: in the, in de-Nazification. Oh yes.",
        "Q: How large a staff would you say.",
        "A: Oh there were 35 people altogether.",
        "Q: and you were, you were the supervisor. Of these 35 people.",
        "A: yeah.",
        "Q: And they had to report back to you of their findings et cetera.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Ok. And who were they mostly. They",
        "A: They were mostly Germans and DPs.",
        "Q: Oh I see, not the American soldiers.",
        "A: there were, there were a few American soldiers but they were not the evaluators. The\nevaluators were all German speaking.",
        "Q: I see, so they were Germans out of the population of Germany.",
        "A: Some, some were Germans and some were DPs. From, from other countries.",
        "Q: they spoke German.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And DPs, also Jewish DPs.",
        "A: There were a few but most of the DPs were not Jewish.",
        "Q: I see. Well that\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: There were a few, I remember there was a Polish, couple of Polish Jews. There were a\ncouple that were in concentration camps. And there were others that were hidden or escaped.\nBut the majority were not Jewish, but there were some Jews.",
        "Q: How long would you say that this whole program last.\nInsdg ",
        "A: Well as I understand as I understood it, 1t didn\u2019t last much longer after I left. That\nsomehow with the new government they changed the thing. Maybe the whole program lasted a\nyear or a year and a half.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s not very, no I excuse me. I remember as a teenager hearing about this, papers\nwere full of this de-Nazification, de-Nazification but I don\u2019t think that we ever had really a\nconcept of what that really involved. I think that perhaps maybe only in my own mind, I thought\nthat it really was kind of a how shall I say it, yeah a curriculum that\u2019s probably the right way.",
        "A: Oh unh hunh.",
        "Q: I thought it was like a curriculum of changing these people\u2019s outlook",
        "A: No, no",
        "Q: But you\u2019re telling me now that this was not it at all.",
        "A: No it was never, It was never like that. it was political screening. Cleansing of job\nholding. But I think they, I think they let Nazis back in because they needed them. They needed\ntheir job skills. And also the whole scientific and technical development.",
        "Q: And then you have the scientists that they needed",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What were the dynamics between your team members.",
        "A: And",
        "Q: No I said the dynamic between your team members, among themselves, the 35 or\nwhatever, yeah, especially in view of the , of what you just told me that there were DP people\nand there were Germans and then there was the army so how did all that work.",
        "A: It was every, it was fine. I mean everybody worked together and everybody was\nchanging, everybody got along. Everybody had stories to tell about their own hardships.",
        "Q: Well that I would believe yeah. You remember some of those stories among those\nhardships that people",
        "A: Well you know as I said a couple, a couple were in concentration camps. Some you know\nhad to leave their homes and travel, escape, were in hiding. For many years. No I, as I recall\neverybody got along fine. There were no frictions.",
        "Q: Even among the people who were in a concentration camp and the Germans that they\nwere",
        "A: Well the Germans on our staff were anti-Nazi.\nInsdg ",
        "Q: Yeah that I can understand, sure.",
        "A: So that was ok.",
        "Q: But among themselves, they got along you say.",
        "A: Yeah seems to me they got along. I don\u2019t\u2019 know. I",
        "Q: You did not notice any frictions.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Well I guess maybe they were all out to do the same thing.",
        "A: Yeah exactly. No we were all doing an important job. We realized that and it was, it was\nNazi hunting. And you know somebody would find a fragebogen that would have contradiction\nin it or show something or, or some, something would come up from the record center, showing\nthat somebody that we had screened turned out to be an important Nazi office holder. They\nwould come into my office and, and hold it up like a victory.",

        "Q: Okay. And this was -- this was after 1943? Or was this still during the war?",
        "Q: It was. But after you had -- after you had joined the Army\u2019?",
        "Q: You started college in '41. So what year did you graduate high school?",
        "Q: Okay. So you went to college the Fall right after?",
        "Q: And which college did you attend?",
        "Q: And this is in Chicago?",
        "Q: The scholarship was based on maybe some --",
        "Q: A competitive exam. And the Central YMCA is in Chicago?",
        "Q: Going to college was something you wanted for yourself or your parents wanted or\nboth?",
        "Q: Were you still living at home when you were in college?",
        "Q: And when you were in college by that time had your parent's situation ameliorated and\nwere you in a bigger apartment?",

        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: Yeah. Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So they -- they weren't really squeezed for money by that time or do you recall feeling\nlike money was an issue still at the time?",
        "Q: Money was always an issue?",
        "Q: It was a topic of conversation or?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Do you remember hearing about Pearl Harbor?",
        "Q: So how did you learn about it?",
        "Q: Was that -- was that --",
        "Q: -- how you learned about it?",
        "Q: Well, that's what I'm curious about. Did you open a newspaper and that's how you\nlearned about it or did someone tell you, run up to you and say hey, this is what just\nhappened? Do you recall how you heard about it first?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. How did you feel when you saw the headlines?",
        "Q: How -- At that time, how did you define yourself? Were you American? Jewish\nAmerican? Jewish American of Russian heritage? How did you think of yourself at the\ntime?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. When you started college did you have a focus? Did you have a concentration\nof topic that you knew you wanted to pursue?",
        "Q: And what was that?",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "Q: Now, what was --",
        "Q: Yeah \u2014",
        "Q: And what about vocational guidance that really grabbed you? What was it that excited\nyou about this?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. By the way, that -- that test that she gave you, what was her guidance to you?\nWhat career did she propose?",
        "Q: She did?",
        "Q: Something to that effect?",
        "Q: So since you were the -- the editor of the high school paper, you must have thought of\nyourself or other people thought of yourself as a good writer. Was this something that\nyour parents were particularly proud of? Interested in? Did they give you feedback about\nthis or?",
        "Q: How -- how good was their English at that point?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Right. So he must have been good at communicating. I'm a little bit concerned -- a\nlittle bit confused about the timeline of your father's jobs. Was he first in dairy and then\nin textiles?",
        "Q: Oh, I'm sorry, confusing everyone?",
        "Q: Right. Right.",
        "Q: Right. Right. And then he goes into shoe salesman?",
        "Q: Did he work in a store? Was he his own boss? How did he --",
        "Q: A department store?",
        "Q: Which one?",
        "Q: Really? What a coincidence.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Now, was this because your family was a --",
        "Q: Well, it seems to me that your parents are moving from town to town to be along with\nyou. Was this --",
        "Q: -- I'm guessing, this was kind of unusual that the nuclear family would stay together\neven after the child is an adult? Was this unusual?",
        "Q: Oh?",
        "Q: Was there something about your family that made them more tight knit than usual?",
        "Q: Did they have a social group of their own? Did they have people that they would go to\ndinner or have a card game or --",
        "Q: -- tea?",

        "Q: Really? So he was renting out the -- the room?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. I see. Okay so we are back --",
        "Q: How do you think that affected you?",
        "Q: Oh, yeah? Okay. So let's get back to your college years. So you start college in '41 and\nyou're studying psychology. Are you studying anything else?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Were you good at math? Bad at math? Didn't really care?",
        "Q: And I seem to recall in a conversation before this interview you said that you had a\npassion for music?",
        "Q: So this is something that came from your parents?",
        "Q: But -- but there was no piano in the home? Or was there?",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "Q: Okay. So this -- this piano in your home, when was this? How old were you?",
        "Q: And did you play any other instruments?",
        "Q: So, you said that you did not have your own room growing up but you were playing\nall of these instruments. Clearly some of them at school. But was that not an issue that\nyou had to practice an instrument and you didn't have your own area?",
        "Q: It wasn't imposing on other people?",
        "Q: Your father was listening to symphonies on the radio or did he have his own records?",
        "Q: So -- so there was no gramophone or record or?",
        "Q: Okay. So what -- If I understand correctly, you were not drafted; you volunteered?",
        "Q: Okay. When was that and why was that?",
        "Q: Well, you were in college how many years before you went into the Army?",
        "Q: So if you started in '41 and you did two full years that would have been --",
        "Q: '43? So would that have been when you volunteered for the Army?",
        "Q: So you volunteered earlier --",
        "Q: And you actually went in in '43?",
        "Q: So what caused the delay?",
        "Q: -- already in college?",
        "Q: And this was one such field?",
        "Q: Now --",
        "Q: And the ASTP would have given you the right to defer until when?",
        "Q: Ok.",
        "Q: Until graduation?",
        "Q: Now, what was your motivation to enlist to volunteer?",
        "Q: Did someone, some kind of advisor, confirm that that was an option that they would\nbe able to do this or this was just your own idea?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Where?",
        "Q: What's a lister bag?",
        "Q: So you're saying there is no plumbing? How -- how did you and other guys clean\nthemselves?",

        "Q: Lectures on what?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Now, how did your parents feel about you volunteering?",
        "Q: They were --",
        "Q: -- supportive?",
        "Q: How many of your -- your friends or acquaintances were doing the same at the time?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In basic training, were you the only Jewish person there in your unit?",
        "Q: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Q: How much time was there between the beginning and the end of basics?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: How much time did you spend in the office before that order came through?",
        "Q: Okay. So we're still in '43?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. What kind of training was that?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: You said something mule. What was the expression you used?",
        "Q: What is that?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So -- so what is all mules? You said you were carts and backpacks?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So what is a mule pack?",
        "Q: Oh, so these are actually mules?",

        "Q: Mules.",
        "Q: So they had mules with them?",
        "Q: I see. I see. But you were not in that division?",

        "Q: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Recruits.",
        "Q: I see. So it would have been your cohort?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. This, this man who you knew, a friend of yours, do you remember his name\u2019?",
        "Q: Do you remember where you knew him from?",
        "Q: But from Colorado or maybe had you been together in Texas or?",
        "Q: And so, during this whole process you said that maybe there was one other Jewish\nperson there. Was -- Did the other --",
        "Q: Did the other men in this unit know that you were Jewish?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So they would not have been aware?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And you had both? You had been a college boy and a city boy?",
        "Q: Was this an issue? Did they make it an issue?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did they taunt you or did they treat you badly?",
        "Q: What did they say?",
        "Q: But this -- this didn't escalate? They didn't actually hurt you or?",
        "Q: There was no -- They didn't isolate you for being different?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And you had your own support group then?",
        "Q: Now given that you had had very different ideas about what was going to happen\nbefore you got the desk job, before your friend finds you in the foxhole, so during those\nmonths, how are you coping with the disappointment? Is it a disappointment?",
        "Q: You weren't angry?",
        "Q: Now --",
        "Q: And what did you think when you saw that?",
        "Q: Right. Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: When? What year?",
        "Q: 20 years ago or So.",
        "Q: Was there a war on?",
        "Q: It was in peacetime?",
        "Q: Okay. Because you were not drafted. You were -- you were a volunteer. Did you\nenjoy any perks? Was there anything given to you as a reward for that or you were just\ntreated the same\u2019?",
        "Q: So those were not draftees?",
        "Q: And there was no distinction between an enlistee and a draftee?",
        "Q: But the system didn't treat you differently?",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. So this -- this man recognizes you in the foxhole. This is your -- your big\nbreakthrough moment and he -- he takes you where? Where do you end up?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "Q: Sure.",

        "Q: And what -- what letter is that? The Service Company?",
        "Q: Oh, it doesn't have a letter?",
        "Q: Okay. And are you given training in the Service Company?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So you said earlier you were processing the new recruits, the boys who had been\nASTP and who had just -- just graduated?",
        "Q: In this company?",
        "Q: No?",
        "Q: Yes?",

        "Q: Texas, Texas is basic training. And then you go to Colorado?",
        "Q: And you stayed in Colorado a whole year?",
        "Q: Okay?",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Georgia?",
        "Q: Okay. Was -- was your job different in Georgia? Did you do different tasks there?",
        "Q: And when you get your orders to ship out, how do you feel? What's your reaction?",
        "Q: You weren't worried? Scared? Apprehensive?",
        "Q: Okay. All right. So in '45, at the beginning of that year, where -- where are you\nshipped to?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.",
        "Q: This is in France?",
        "Q: Was it close to Normandy? Was it in Normandy?",
        "Q: In Normandy. And what were you doing in the camp?",
        "Q: But -- but what kind of tasks were you assigned? Or were you still processing new\ndraftees in France?",

        "Q: So how did that happen? How did you get the wine?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Was that the only thing you bartered or was there anything else? Rations or chocolate\nor?",
        "Q: So you didn't get down to the varietals. You didn't talk about what kind of wine it is?\nYou didn't say --",
        "Q: -- I would like a burgundy wine? Or no? No, it was just red or white? Both?",
        "Q: Did they have both?",
        "Q: Did you have a preference?",
        "Q: Was -- was actually alcohol consumption, was that something your parents did? Did\nthey drink wine at home ever?",
        "Q: And so growing up had you had any experience with alcohol in high school? In\ncollege, before you entered the Army\u201d?",
        "Q: There were no parties?",
        "Q: No?",
        "Q: So when you were tasked to bring back this wine, you had no interest in it?",
        "Q: And the other -- the other soldiers, did they drink too much?",
        "Q: They did? Did they misbehave when they drank too much?",
        "Q: So the misbehavior would be on base? It would not be in the village? It would not be\nin with locals?",
        "Q: There was no incidents with locals?",
        "Q: When somebody misbehaved, given that you're in classification, did you have to write\nup a report?",
        "Q: Okay. Oh, okay. So you were bringing back wine. And what other tasks did you do as\nan interpreter?",
        "Q: So you took -- You were speaking with the locals in order to get the laundry done?\nWith women?",

        "Q: Okay. All right. So that's your -- in your memories that's your first German\nexperience?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, all right. So tell me about Kulmbach. What happened there?",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me about the beer. You weren't very interested in alcohol so why did you\nmention the beer?",
        "Q: Oh. What about the locals in Kulmbach? Did you interact with them?",
        "Q: And how did you feel about the Germans in general? Did you, because the way you're\ndescribing it, what I'm understanding, is that you had a sense that some were not Nazi's.\nDid you have a feeling that some had been part of the system and some had not? Or did\nyou have a stronger sentiment of kind of a blanket feeling regarding towards them that\nthey must of all been a part of the system?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So does that mean that you were -- you pretty much did not interact\nwith the population at that point yet because you weren't sure what you were in for?",
        "Q: How long did you say?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: May 8th?",

        "Q: Do you recall -- do you recall your first thoughts? Did you know who these people\nwere?",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Okay. So, tell me about that.",
        "Q: Gunskirchen?",
        "Q: -- So the prisoner said to you, I'm one of you?",
        "Q: Now, did he know that you spoke Yiddish or understood Yiddish?",
        "Q: And so you hear this. What -- what is passing through --",
        "Q: What did you do when you heard that?",
        "Q: But this was not the first time you had seen people in these striped uniforms?",
        "Q: How frequently had you seen them? Just a few incidents or?",
        "Q: And those incidents were -- I\u2014 I understand you probably don't remember the exact\nlocation but what was the -- where was it in a field? Or on a road? Or in an other camp\nwhere they concentrated? Was it many people? Few people?",
        "Q: So you had come across these people in the striped clothing?",
        "Q: And you had known what about them exactly at that time?",
        "Q: And you knew about concentration camps because?",
        "Q: In where?",
        "Q: But would you -- would you know that the striped uniform is what a concentration\ncamp inmate wears?",
        "Q: Did the Army ever brief you on who these people are or what to expect about these\npeople?",
        "Q: Do you have any concrete examples? Any details?",
        "Q: But that was after having --",
        "Q: -- liberated?",
        "Q: -- Gunskirchen. Uh-huh. So when you happened upon this camp your idea of what\nyou're seeing 1s what?",
        "Q: So as you were describing, you opened the gates. Were the gates locked?",
        "Q: So you could just turn a handle and open it?",
        "Q: Why had they not opened it?",
        "Q: Do you know why they had not opened it? The gate?",
        "Q: Because it seems to me you're saying that 1t was easy to open?",
        "Q: Do you remember the other guy's name?",
        "Q: Careful of the mic.",
        "Q: But so you opened the gate and this is when you hear the man speaking Yiddish?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts -- thoughts when you heard that?",
        "Q: -- \"have pity. Have\" --",
        "Q: The fact that he was speaking Yiddish?",
        "Q: So did you immediately decide to go back to your company\u2019?",
        "Q: So you -- At that point you are not interacting with any of the prisoners?",
        "Q: How long did it take you to get back to the company, do you think?",
        "Q: And what did you tell your company? What had you just seen?",
        "Q: And what did -- and what did your \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. And what did they do?",
        "Q: Did you go back with them?",
        "Q: So did you ever go -- go back to Mauthausen during that period?",
        "Q: There was -- there was just that one interaction of, I'm sorry, Gunscarium (sic), that --\nthat one situation where you're opening the gate and then you immediately went back to\nthe company. So you did not enter the camp?",
        "Q: And you must have been there just a few minutes?",
        "Q: How many people did you see?",
        "Q: What was?",

        "Q: That\u2019s where you live?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay, very good. Well I was very much interested to hear and I also listened a\nlittle bit to the original interview what your function was after World War II. How did\nyou get involved with the denazification and why were you chosen -- chosen to be part of\nthat program?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: I -- I suppose it was quite a challenge for you.",
        "Q: Now, what -- how -- now in retrospect, how successful do you think that this program\nworked out?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: When you say successful, do you think that it had an impact on --",
        "Q: -- on the Nazis to -- well, let's say nevermind repent, but they realized finally how\nwrong they had gone or how criminal their government had been or do you think that\nthey -- they did this mostly so that they would be spared from trials or prison or worse?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "Q: No, no, I understand, I know that, but I was just wondering --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Because then they were forced?",
        "Q: The reason that you felt that way 1s because at that point they were forced, whether --",
        "Q: -- they liked it or not?",
        "Q: Right, right. My question merely -- my next question actually was: Who were the\nindividuals you were dealing with and had they been officials during the Nazi regime? So\nin a way you have answered that already.",
        "Q: Yeah. You said that they were \u2014",
        "Q: -- they had been in the government?",
        "Q: And -- well, and you think that those who went into the party after '37 by -- in their\nhearts they were not Nazis? Do you think 00?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "Q: Now, how do you think -- what was the reaction on the parts of these Germans? They\nwere removed from their office by the United States military.",
        "Q: And what was their reaction to being chosen to be denazified? \u2014I assume that some\nwere beyond that. In other words, that they, you know, either ended up in prison or could\nnot be used --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: I see, yeah.",
        "Q: So you had good reason to think that the people you were dealing with, it was\nworthwhile trying to change them \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: In what language did you interrogate these people? How did you deal with the --",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "Q: By the way, have you ever come across the name of a American lawyer by the name\nof Kemp -- not American, German lawyer by the name of Kempner (ph)?",
        "Q: Kempner, yeah.",
        "Q: Because apparently he is -- was a -- a -- a lawyer who interrogated also this -- these\nkind of people, people who had been in office, who had --",
        "Q: -- held government jobs and trying to find out how much did they know what was\ngoing on --",
        "Q: -- and were they in favor of it or not, and so apparently he -- you know, he became\nquite well known. That's maybe why the name is familiar to you. Yeah, Kempner was the\nname. He was a German interrogating his own people.",
        "Q: Yeah. Okay. So how -- let's see, did they honestly cooperate or did they just want to\nescape punishment and, therefore, participated in the program? What would you think?",
        "Q: They did not cooperate with the American --",
        "Q: The people who were supposed to be denazified.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: That was my question, too: How honest were the answers or could you assess that?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you think that some of them really -- well, let me ask you this then: How\ndid you determine who -- whom to get into the program?",
        "Q: How did you choose the individual that you thought would qualify to be in the\nprogram and be denazified?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: I see, uh-huh.",
        "Q: I see, I see.",
        "Q: So you were handed a list of people \u2014",
        "Q: I see, I understand. And then you did your best to try and get the Nazi ideology out of\nthem, huh?",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: And -- {coughing} excuse me. And how did you -- you were a young person, as you\nmentioned earlier.",
        "Q: How did you feel to carry out such a difficult burden? I mean in a way from a human\npoint of view this is quite a -- a hard burden to carry because you decide on somebody's\nfuture in a way.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "Q: Well, that I can understand, right. Now, how was the --",
        "Q: I know, I know.",
        "Q: I see, uh-huh. And -- well, okay.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, many of them came \u2014",
        "Q: -- at an age here to America and then enlisted in the Army, that's right.",
        "Q: You know I come from that part of the world, too.",
        "Q: I'm originally from -- from Hamburg.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Now, what was the procedure, was this program conducted on a\nOne -- one-on-one basis or did you have groups at the same time, and how exactly did you\nproceed in this project, in this program of denazification?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, uh-huh, yeah.",
        "Q: I see, okay.",
        "Q: So you followed a protocol, in other words?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see, okay. But then -- and then let's say now you have chosen 10 or 20 or 30\nof these individuals. Was it conducted like in a classroom or was it conducted on a one-\nto-one basis?",
        "Q: It was one-to-one?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: What was the procedure?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah. And how long did such a process take?",
        "Q: Yes, uh-huh.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see.",
        "Q: Right, right, uh-huh.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Or did you interview members of their family or --",
        "Q: -- I don\u2019t know what \u2014 uh-huh.",
        "Q: Or friends or \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see.",
        "Q: I see, I see. Oh, you mean you got the fragebogen, that you evaluated, but you didn't\nnecessarily have the individual in front of you?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see. I didn't realize that. Now I suppose I had a -- I had a different concept\nsomewhat. I thought that after you went through the fragebogen and you decided who\nwas suspicious or wasn't suspicious, that they somehow got some kind of a -- I don't want\nto call it brainwashing, but some kind of a, you know, democratic viewpoint or -- or --",
        "Q: Based on their fragebogen.",
        "Q: And were they cooperative, were they hostile, antagonistic or --",
        "Q: Oh --",
        "Q: Well, that was easy to say afterwards.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, to admit that?",
        "Q: That's the other big problem, exactly, right. So I was-- one of the questions I had in\nmy mind was: Was any material used during this process, but I guess it wasn't 'cause I\nhad a different concept of it at all.",
        "Q: I thought there were lectures being given on democracy or lectures --",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And get the least suspicious back into the workforce?",
        "Q: I said and then to get the least suspicious individuals back into the working force?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, I understand, yeah. Okay. Let's see now, what qualifications did you have or\nrequired in order to be part of this process? Well, you said that --",
        "Q: I see, oh, I see.",
        "Q: I see. And were you in charge of the -- of this particular program?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Yeah",
        "Q: I see, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: I see. So you were in a supervisory position?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: I see, good, very good. Were there Germans that participated under oath?",
        "Q: Well, let's say those who filled out the fragebogen -- fragebogen, and was there\nanywhere where they had to, I don't know, sign that -- like we say here in the United\nStates --",
        "Q: You know, to whatever I wrote that --",
        "Q: But they were not under any verbal oath or anything like that?",
        "Q: Well, they -- I think they got away with too much, quite honestly, but never mind.\nWell, that was another question I had: How could you be sure that what they put down in\ntheir fragebogen was an honest answer? But I think you answered that already and you\ncould --",
        "Q: Yeah. You could check it unless they came from the east?",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, that's, of course, a big problem, but -- and that I guess wasn't really\neliminated until the '90s, right, when they got records.",
        "Q: What did you hope to achieve with this denazification program?",
        "Q: And do you think you succeeded?",
        "Q: And that was under Adenauer or \u2014",
        "Q: Well, I guess you were dealing here with what, 52 million people or however many --",
        "Q: So you told me already where you were located, right? In -- in Regensburg \u2014",
        "Q: -- or where was --",
        "Q: Okay. And that's where -- where your work was concentrated, in that part of Bavaria?",
        "Q: How long did you work in this capacity?",
        "Q: At the time that I was in a DP camp in Italy.",
        "Q: Beyond that even, until August, I guess, of '46. Okay. What were some of the most\nmemorable incidents that you remember from that period? You already told me about the\nguy who said you had your day --",
        "Q: I mean we had our day, now you have your day. I'm sure you came across a number of\nother memorable incidents with these people.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. The highest removal?",
        "Q: That's interesting.",
        "Q: Well, Bavaria is sort of Hitler country \u2014",
        "Q: -- perhaps that's why.",
        "Q: Munich, that's part of it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay. But specifically on a one-to-one from an individual, do you have any\nmemorable incidents that occurred with, you know, you speaking to any of these people\nor in conversation or --",
        "Q: I see. Now, you think that the program was effective?",
        "Q: How soon would you think was it watered down? I think that really is also an\nimportant point because was there already a new younger generation coming 1n or --",
        "Q: What, that they over turned this program?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Were any other highlights that you remember during this period? I\nmean some really heavy duty Nazis that were discovered in this way? I assume that\nperhaps through the fragebogen you did discover some --",
        "Q: Anybody specific?",
        "Q: Yeah, I mean really big shots.",
        "Q: Okay. What about -- or how was it justified that some of the Nazis scientists, etcetera,\nended up here?",
        "Q: Or they would have fallen into the hands of the -- of the -- of the other side.",
        "Q: Do you think -- well, let me ask you this: What are some of the strengths or\nweaknesses of this program?",
        "Q: Oh, yeah, yeah, right, right.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Right --",
        "Q: {Coughing} excuse me. No, that I realize and that, of course, very difficult to make\nthis distinction and then to be sure that --",
        "Q: Yeah, very difficult. Did you -- were you able to -- to obtain lists of Nazi party\nmembers?",
        "Q: I can imagine, yeah.",
        "Q: And probably to the great disappointment of some of the people --",
        "Q: There you had it black and white, huh?",
        "Q: Okay. I had a question of how were the candidates for denazification chosen?",
        "Q: That you really needed in order to --",
        "Q: Made the selection. When you say somebody else, you mean from among the allies,\nnot from within the Germans themselves?",
        "Q: I see, okay, uh-huh. So really everything, all the -- all the selection, and I hate to use\nthat word for obvious reasons, but let's -- let's just use it for lack of a better word, so all\nthe selections were really based entirely on the fragebogen?",
        "Q: Yeah, who was going to be denazified or not.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you do some of the interviews yourself as well?",
        "Q: Did you do personally some of the interviews yourself or \u2014",
        "Q: He would do the --",
        "Q: I see. So really was a whole team work\u2019?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Now, the -- the workload must have been overwhelming, as we said\nbefore, dealing with a whole nation?",
        "Q: Now, did this -- that's a good answer because that brings me to another question. Did\nyou -- did the United States have such programs all over Germany\u2019?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: I see, I see.",
        "Q: You're just the -- the --",
        "Q: Niederbayern, yeah. Oh, I see. This really was a very well organized undertaking.",
        "Q: I mean -- so what would you say, roughly how many people in your sector, on your\nsection were involved in this? Germans, I mean.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "Q: Well, it was a vast undertaking. And you -- you -- you talk about the Americans\nhaving done that, and I was not aware of that either that -- that this was not an allied\nundertaking. I always was under the impression that this was a cooperative undertaking.",
        "Q: I see. And the other --",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did they also call it denazification?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So not -- not --",
        "Q: Yeah, I know that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right. Now that I heard --",
        "Q: Right, even from --",
        "Q: And also a lot of Russians died because of that.",
        "Q: Yeah. So let me ask you this: What would you say, how-- how did this experience\naffect you as a young person in such a responsible position, you know, which involved\nreally impacting the course of people's lives? Were you aware of your power, were you\ntroubled by the fact that you did not have experience in that area?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you pursue that psychology at the end?",
        "Q: Very nice, lovely. Well, so you're telling me that so close after the war ended, this\nhorrible war, they had already concert, theater, opera, dances --",
        "Q: -- and everything else?",
        "Q: I guess people are very resilient.",
        "Q: Well --",
        "Q: I know, I know. Hamburg was destroyed, 75 percent.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. And were you -- well, you said you enjoyed it, so I assume you enjoyed\nthe feeling of having power over these people?",
        "Q: Important job, too.",
        "Q: Right, right, right.",
        "Q: You just asked -- you just answered my next question, which really was How\ndangerous or how hostile were these people against the -- well, the allies in general but\nthe United States Army soldiers that were in --",
        "Q: I see. So one really did need a little bit of protection after all.",
        "Q: You were not welcomed with open arms?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Well --",
        "Q: Well, it probably netted them some chocolate and nylon stockings and other things.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, that's for sure.",
        "Q: What days these were, oh, my God. I remember them quite well still. Well, I had a\nquestion whether, you know, you had to follow a protocol in this process or whether it\nwas, you know, partially your own instinct to realize who was honest, who was not\nhonest, etcetera? What guided your -- your work more, the protocol that you had to\nfollow or the instinct that you felt when confronting some of these fragebogen?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "Q: I see, uh-huh. Now, another question just came to my mind. Most of Germany was\nmobilized into the Army.",
        "Q: And these people that you dealt with were people who were holding office jobs or --\nor were working for the government in a -- in a different capacity.",
        "Q: Not in the Army.",
        "Q: How did they -- how did they manage to stay out of the Army?",
        "Q: But these guys, in other words, had -- that you were dealing with had not been in -- in\nthe military in the Wehrnacht?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Well, just a few months, yeah, they may have been \u2014",
        "Q: -- demobilized by that time?",
        "Q: Now, how often did you come across or did they honestly --",
        "Q: How often did you come across somebody who honestly said that he was a member of\nthe SS?",
        "Q: Nobody, I see.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, that was the forerunner.",
        "Q: Well, they were the forerunners to the SS actually, I guess.",
        "Q: Yeah, the beginning of the whole business.",
        "Q: Okay. How did it affect you as a Jew to be put into this position, to work with Nazis\nand trying to sort of get them back on a normal footing on the -- on the non-Nazi lifestyle\nor non-Nazi outlook.",
        "Q: As a Jew.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: What happened, by the way, to those people that were fired from their jobs and did not\n-- could not be re-employed in -- into the government?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Well, this was -- Germany has always been a big bureaucratic --",
        "Q: -- structure, but \u2014",
        "Q: But you don't -- you don't know what \u2014",
        "Q: I mean unless they ended up in prison. I suppose some of these people had a record or\n-- arecord came to light --",
        "Q: -- where they actually --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Well, you said they -- their finances were --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Not enough.",
        "Q: Not enough, but what can you do. You could have taken a whole nation and cut them\noff from the member of the world like Mr. Morgenthau you wanted to do?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: That's okay.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Oh, my goodness. That is very very intriguing. You did that in recent years?",
        "Q: How lovely. That's really quite an undertaking.",
        "Q: Well, that's always very, very difficult to find a publisher, but I suppose you could\napproach a number of, you know, known publishers and send them the manuscript. I\nguess that's how you go about it \u2014",
        "Q: -- or you can go through some of the universities publish books.",
        "Q: But I don't know whether -- you know, as a novel, but it's really a historic novel, I\nassume\u2019?",
        "Q: Right. Okay. So possibly some of the universities might be interested. I mean you\nhave to start somewhere and usually, you know, one person gives you an idea and\nanother person and eventually you may --",
        "Q: -- find somebody who does -- sounds fascinating to me.",
        "Q: We don't do any publishing.",
        "Q: We don't do any publishing.",
        "Q: We have a book steward that sells novels and mostly authentic stories about the\nHolocaust --",
        "Q: -- but these are all published books, but we do not -- we in the museum do not publish\nbooks, but you --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Oh, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Oh. You mean one of the subcamps?",
        "Q: Yeah, uh-huh.",
        "Q: I bet. And you found survivors there?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Mauthausen, was that \u2014",
        "Q: -- in Austria or was that in Germany?",
        "Q: Mauthausen, was on the German side or Austrian?",
        "Q: Could be, I'm not sure.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So how long were you in the Army?",
        "Q: You enlisted or you --",
        "Q: After Pearl Harbor.",
        "Q: Oh, oh, I see, uh-huh.",
        "Q: I see, I see. Well, those were the worst years, I guess.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So you saw a lot of battle though?",
        "Q: Battle. I mean active warfare.",
        "Q: Of active warfare, of battles.",
        "Q: Yeah. I mean you were in the trenches, so to say?",
        "Q: I see, okay.",
        "Q: I see. Did you -- you had a staff that worked with you, yeah?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: How large a staff would you say did you have?",
        "Q: I see, uh-huh. And you were the -- you were the supervisor --",
        "Q: -- of these 35 people?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And they had to report back to you of their findings, --",
        "Q: -- etcetera?",
        "Q: Okay. And who were they mostly, they \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, I see. Not the American soldiers?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: So they were Germans out of the population of Germany?",
        "Q: But spoke German\u2019?",
        "Q: Yeah. And DPs, also Jewish DPs?",
        "Q: I see, uh-huh. Well, that's interesting.",
        "Q: How long do you -- would you say that this whole program last?",
        "Q: I see. So that's not very -- no, I -- excuse me. I remember as a teenager hearing about\nthis -- papers were full of this denazification, denazification, but I don't think that we ever\nhad really a concept of what that really involved. I think perhaps, maybe only in my own\nmind, I thought that really was kind of a -- how shall I say, yeah, a curriculum, that's\nprobably the right way of --",
        "Q: I thought it was like a curriculum of changing these people's outlook.",
        "Q: But you're telling me now that this was not it at all.",

        "Q: No, I said the dynamics between your team members, among themselves, the 35 or\nwhatever, yeah, especially in view of what you just told me that there were DP people\nand there were Germans and then there was the Army, so how did all that work?",
        "Q: Even --",
        "Q: Well, that I would believe, yeah. Do you remember some of those stories or some of\nthose hardships that people were talking about?",

        "Q: Do you -- well, I can imagine that that was regarded as a major victory.",
        "Q: Well, I don't know whatever we -- we try to do, I hope we accomplished this in some\nway or other.",
        "Q: Was this an emotional situation for you?",

        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yes, it is, and it's not much known, not well known at all. And in fact, you\nknow, I speak in many places, in schools, etcetera, to talk about that part of history.",

        "Q: -- whether, you know -- whether this will be on a DVD and whether they can send it to\nyou.",

        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.",
        "Q: That's a big aim right now, to get as many survivors and etcetera, you know,\ninterviewed before it's too late. But I can ask that question right now because the young\nlady just walked in, so hold on one minute, please.",

        "Q: So, you know, we're trying to get as much as possible.",
        "Q: Because this is really the only source that people can come to and our, how shall I say,\nbig aim in a way is to educate the youth, the next generation and the next generation.",
        "Q: And unless we have all of this material on the website or available for students or\nteachers, etcetera, we're really missing a lot.",

        "Q: When was that and why was that?",
        "Q: You were in college how many years before you went to the army.",
        "Q: So if you started in 41 and you did 2 full years, that would have been",
        "Q: 43, so would that have been when you volunteered for the army.",
        "Q: So you volunteered earlier and then you got, you actually went in, in 43.",
        "Q: So what caused the delay.",
        "Q: And this was one such field.",
        "Q: And the ASTP would have given you the right to defer until when.",
        "Q: what was your motivation to enlist, to volunteer",
        "Q: Did someone, advisor confirm that that was an option, that they would be able to do this\nor this was just your own idea.",
        "Q: Where",
        "Q: What\u2019s a lister bag?",

        "Q: Oh these are actual mules. I thought maybe it\u2019s a code for some kind of",
        "Q: But you were not in that division",
        "Q: Given that you had had",
        "Q: I see, so it would have been your cohort",
        "Q: This man who you knew, a friend of yours, do you remember his name",
        "Q: Do you remember where you knew him from?",
        "Q: But from Colorado or maybe had you been together in Texas.",
        "Q: During this whole process you said maybe there was one other Jewish person there. Was\ndid the other",
        "Q: Did the other men in this unit know that you were Jewish?",
        "Q: So they would not have been aware.",
        "Q: You had both. You had been a college boy and a city boy. Was this an issue, did they\nmake it an issue",
        "Q: Did they taunt you, did they",
        "Q: This didn\u2019t escalate, they didn\u2019t actually hurt you or",
        "Q: there was no, they didn\u2019t isolate you for being different.",
        "Q: And you had your own support group then.",
        "Q: Now given that you had very different ideas about what was going to happen before you\ngot the desk job, before your friend finds you in the fox hole. So during those months how are\nyou coping with the disappointment. Is it a disappointment?",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t angry",
        "Q: And what did you think when you saw that.",
        "Q: What year",
        "Q: Was there a war on",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t his time.",
        "Q: Because you were not drafted, you were a volunteer, did you enjoy any perks, was there\nanything given to you as a reward for that or you were just treated the same.",
        "Q: So those were not draftees.",
        "Q: But the system didn\u2019t treat you differently",
        "Q: This man recognizes you in the fox hole, this is your big breakthrough moment. He takes\nyou where, where do you end up?",
        "Q: And then you\u2019re taken out of that company and put into service company",
        "Q: And what letter is that, the service company.",
        "Q: Oh it doesn\u2019t have a letter.",
        "Q: Are you given training in the service company.",
        "Q: You said earlier you were processing the new recruits, the boys who had been ASTP and\nwho had just, just graduated.",
        "Q: In this company",
        "Q: Are you still in Colorado at that point?",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Fort Benning? Approximately when did you get there and when\ndid you leave",

        "Q: January of 45 is when you got overseas",
        "Q: So when you enlist this is 43, you do 13 weeks of basic training, so 13 weeks what 1s that,\nthat\u2019s about 3 months. So you\u2019re in the fall of 43 and then you\u2019re going into then you go to\nColorado, cause basic training is California, did I get this right, I did. Texas, Texas is basic",
        "Q: And you stayed in Colorado a whole year.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Georgia.",
        "Q: Was your job different in Georgia. Did you do different tasks there",
        "Q: And when you get your orders to ship out. How do you feel, what\u2019s your reaction?",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t worried, scared, apprehensive",
        "Q: All right so in 45, the beginning of that year where are you shipped to",
        "Q: This is in France",
        "Q: Was it close to Normandy? Was it in Normandy?",
        "Q: What were you doing in the camp",
        "Q: But what kind of tasks were you assigned. Or where you still processing new draftees in\nFrance, what were you doing.",
        "Q: How long were you in Normandy.",
        "Q: While you were in still in France were you interacting with any of the local population.",
        "Q: SO how did that happen. How did you get the wine.\nA; Well at the end of the day you know I we could go into town so we went into the village\nand I would ask for, for wine. And there was something else. There were 2 things. And of\ncourse we were always in good shape as far, in good shape to barter because we had cigarettes\nand that was what everybody wanted.",
        "Q: Was that the only thing you bartered or was there anything else, rations or chocolate.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t get down to the varietals? You didn\u2019t talk about what kind of wine it is,\nyou didn\u2019t say",
        "Q: I would like a burgundy wine or",
        "Q: It was just red or white.",
        "Q: Did they have both",
        "Q: Was actually alcohol consumption was that something your parents did. Did they drink\nwine at home every.",
        "Q: And so growing up had you had any experience with alcohol in high school, in college,\nbefore you entered the army.",
        "Q: There were no parties",
        "Q: So when you were tasked to bring back this wine you had no interest 1n it.",
        "Q: And the other soldiers. Did they drink too much.",
        "Q: They did. Did they misbehave when they drank too much.",
        "Q: So the misbehavior would be on base. It would not be in the village, it would not be",
        "Q: With locals. There were no incidents with locals.",
        "Q: When somebody misbehaved, given that you\u2019re in classification, did you have to write a\nreport.",
        "Q: So you were bringing back wine and what other tasks did you do as an interpreter.",
        "Q: So you took, you were speaking with the locals in order to get the laundry done with\nwomen.",
        "Q: How long was your stay in France? You get there at the beginning of the year. Is it still",
        "Q: This is Germany.",
        "Q: Approximately where in Germany. What\u2019s a big city there.",
        "Q: Close to or in which state",
        "Q: Is it spelled K-u-M-B-A-C-H",
        "Q: So that\u2019s your in your memories that\u2019s your first German experience.",
        "Q: Tell me about Kulmbach. What happened there.",
        "Q: Tell me about the beer. You weren\u2019t very interested in alcohol so why do you mention\nthe beer.",
        "Q: What about the locals in Kulmbach. Did you interact with them?",
        "Q: How did you feel about the Germans in general. Did you, cause the way you\u2019re\ndescribing it, what I\u2019m understanding is that you had a sense that some were not Nazis. Did you\nhave a feeling that some had been part of the system and some had not. Or did you have a\nstronger sentiment of kind of a blanket feeling towards them that they must have all",
        "Q: Does that mean that you pretty much did not interact with the population at that point\nyet? Cause you weren\u2019t sure what you were in for",
        "Q: How long did you stay",
        "Q: May 8\"",
        "Q: Roughly 2 months so that would put it at early March",
        "Q: And where did you go into combat?",
        "Q: Ok and what was your first experience of combat",
        "Q: Again what tasks were you doing. Were you still only processing your won people\u2019s\npapers",
        "Q: So you were not working on local issues while the army was advancing.",
        "Q: Did you ever see combat before the end of the war. Were you in any kind of danger?",
        "Q: So",
        "Q: How did you learn that the war was over? In your",
        "Q: Where were you when the war was over",
        "Q: When did you meet the Russians",
        "Q: May 8\"",
        "Q: So that one week it was one week before, it was the week of, that\u2019s when you met the\nRussians",
        "Q: Can you describe what happened when you met the Russians.",
        "Q: Did the two groups mix? Was there any kind of interaction between the soviet army and\nthe US Army",
        "Q: Do you recall ever meeting",
        "Q: When did that start happening that wherever you go you would bump into",
        "Q: So if it started in Germany do you recall when you first when your company first came\nacross concentration camp survivors",
        "Q: Do you recall your first thoughts. Did you know who these people were?",
        "Q: Where were you coming across these people?",
        "Q: Fields, roads",
        "Q: Ok so tell me about that.",
        "Q: Gunskirchen",
        "Q: So the prisoner said I\u2019m one of you. how did he know that you spoke Yiddish. Or",
        "Q: And so hear this",
        "Q: And what did you do when you heard that.",
        "Q: but this was not the first time you had seen people in the striped uniforms",
        "Q: How frequently had you seen them. Just a few incidents\nA; Yeah.",
        "Q: and those incidents were, I understand you probably don\u2019t\u2019 remember the exact location\nbut what was, was it in a field or on a road or in a other camp were they concentrated. Was it\nmany people, few people?",
        "Q: So you had come across these people in the striped clothing",
        "Q: And you had known what about them exactly at that time.",
        "Q: and you knew about concentration camps because",
        "Q: In where?",
        "Q: But would you, would you know of that the striped uniform is what a concentration camp\ninmate wears.",
        "Q: Did the army ever brief you on who these people are or what to expect about these\npeople.",
        "Q: Do you have any concrete examples, any details.",
        "Q: But that was after having liberated",
        "Q: So when you happened upon this camp your idea of what you\u2019re seeing is what",
        "Q: So as you were describing you opened the gates. Were the gates locked",
        "Q: So you could just turn a handle and open it.",
        "Q: Why had they not opened",
        "Q: Do you know why they had not opened it? the gate",
        "Q: Cause it seems to me you\u2019re saying",
        "Q: Do you remember the other guy\u2019s name?",
        "Q: So you opened the gate and this is when you hear the man speaking Yiddish.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts when you heard that. have pity",
        "Q: the fact that he was speaking Yiddish",
        "Q: So did you immediately decide to go back to your company",
        "Q: So you at that point you were not interacting with any other prisoners",
        "Q: How long did it take you to go back to the company",
        "Q: and what did you tell your company, what had you just seen.",
        "Q: Ok and what did they do",
        "Q: Did you go back with them.",
        "Q: So did you ever go back to Mauthausen during that period.",
        "Q: There was just that one interaction of, \u2019'm sorry Gunskirchen. That one situation where\nyou\u2019re opening the gate and then you immediately went back to the company so you did not\nenter the camp.",
        "Q: And you must have been there just a few minutes.",
        "Q: How many people did you see",
        "Q: Tell me about the smell",
        "Q: What was it reminiscent of",
        "Q: Which people",
        "Q: What was the weather like that day. Was it raining",
        "Q: Was it fairly warm b then? Or was it a cold spring?\nA; | I don\u2019t\u2019 remember that. I think it was fairly, it must I don\u2019t know. I know it wasn\u2019t\nraining.\n(end first interview; second interview follows on October 25, 2012 with Dr. Johanna Neumann)",
        "Q: This is Holocaust Memorial Museum. Interviewing with Lester Libo, contacted by me,\nby Johanna Neumann, October 25, 2012 in Washington, DC. And this interview is being\nconducted over the phone. And now I am introducing myself to you. I understand that you had\nsome interview already, part of your interview already took place.",
        "Q:I  Isee ok. Well I think I hope you are comfortable and sitting down and relaxing.",
        "Q: Ok, very good. Where are you?",
        "Q: Ah, New Mexico.",
        "Q: That\u2019s where you live",
        "Q: Ok, very good. Well I was very much interested to hear and I also listened a little bit to\nthe original interview. What your function was after World War II. How did you get involved\nwith the de-Nazification and why were you chosen to be part of that program.",
        "Q: I suppose it was quite a challenge for you.",
        "Q: Now in this respect, how successful do you think that this program worked out.",
        "Q: When you say successful do you think that it had an impact on the Nazis. To well let\u2019s\nsay never mind repent but that they realized finally how wrong they had gone or how criminal\ntheir government had been or do you think that they did this mostly so that they would be spared\nfrom trials or prison or worse.",
        "Q: No, no I understand. I know that. but I was just wondering",
        "Q: Because then they were forced.",
        "Q: The reason that you felt that way is because at that point they were forced, whether they\nliked it or not.",
        "Q: Right, well my question really my next question actually was who were the individuals\nyou were dealing with and had they been officials during the Nazi regime. So in a way you have\nanswered that already.",
        "Q: You said that they were, they had been in the government",
        "Q: And you think that those who went into the party after 37, but in their hearts they were\nnot Nazis. Do you think",
        "Q: How do you think what was the reaction on the part of these Germans. They were\nremoved from their office, by the United States military and what was their reaction to being\nchosen to be de-Nazified. I assume that some were beyond that. In other words, that they you\nknow either ended up in prison or could not be used in",
        "Q: So you had good reason to think that the people you were dealing with it was worthwhile\ntrying to change them.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: In what language did you interrogate these people. How did you",
        "Q: By the way have you ever come across the name of an American lawyer by the name of\nKent, no not American, German lawyer by the name of Kempner.",
        "Q: Kempner. Yeah.",
        "Q: Oh because apparently he is was a lawyer who interrogated also these kind of people,\npeople who had been in office, who had held government jobs and trying to find out how much\ndid they know. What was going on. Were they in favor of it or not and so on. And apparently\nhe you know he became quite well known. That\u2019s maybe he was, why the name is familiar to\nyou. Yeah, Kempner is his name. He was German interrogating his own people.",
        "Q: Ok so did they honestly cooperate or did they just want to escape punishment and",
        "Q: They did not cooperate with the American military.",
        "Q: The people who were supposed to be de-Nazified.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: That was my question too. How honest were the answers. How could you assess that.",
        "Q: So you think that some of them really well let me ask you this then. How did you\ndetermine who was to get into the program.",
        "Q: Yeah how did you choose the individuals that you thought would qualify to be in the\nprogram and be de-Nazified.",
        "Q: So you were handed a list of people.",
        "Q: I see. I understand and then you did your best to try and get the Nazi ideology out of\nthem.",
        "Q: And how did you, you were a young person as you mentioned earlier. How did you feel\nto carry out such a difficult burden. I mean in a way from a human point of view, this is quite a\nhard burden to carry because you decide on somebody\u2019s future in a way.",
        "Q: Oh ok.\nA; I was glad to do it. it was a revenge.",
        "Q: Well that I can understand, right. Now how was the",
        "Q: I know, I know.",
        "Q: I see. And well ok.",
        "Q: Yeah well many of them came at an age here to America and then enlisted in the army.\nThat\u2019s right. you know I come from that part of the world too. I am originally from Hamburg.",
        "Q: Ok now what was the procedure. Was this program conducted on one, on a one on one\nbasis or did you have groups at the same time and how exactly did you proceed in this project, in\nthis program of de-Nazification.",
        "Q: I see ok, so you followed a protocol in other words.",
        "Q: Ok but then and then let\u2019s say now you have chosen 10 or 20 or 30 these individuals. It\nwas conducted like in a classroom or was it conducted on a one to one basis.",
        "Q: It was one to one",
        "Q: I see, and what was the procedure.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Yeah and how long did such a process take.",
        "Q: right, right.",
        "Q: Did you interview members of their family or I don\u2019t know",
        "Q: Or friends or",
        "Q: I see. Oh you mean you got the fragebogen that you evaluated, but you didn\u2019t necessarily\nhave the individual in front of you.",
        "Q: I see. I didn\u2019t realize that. Now I suppose I had a different concept somewhat. I thought\nthat after you went through the fragebogen and you decided who was suspicious or wasn\u2019t\nsuspicious, that they somehow got some kind of a I don\u2019t\u2019 want to call it brain washing, but some\nkind of a you know democratic viewpoint or, or",
        "Q: Based on their fragebogen.",
        "Q: And were they cooperative. Were they hostile, antagonistic or",
        "Q: That was easy to say.",
        "Q: To admit that.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the other big problem in Nazi mind. So I was, one of the questions I had in my\nmind was, was there any material use during this process. But I guess it wasn\u2019t cause I had a\ndifferent concept of it at all. You know I thought there were lectures being given on democracy\nor lectures",
        "Q: And at the least suspicious back into the work force.",
        "Q: I said and then to get the least suspicious individuals back into the working force.",
        "Q: I understand, yeah. Ok let\u2019s see now. What qualifications did you have or were required\nin order to be part of this process.",
        "Q: I see. And were you in charge of this particular program.",
        "Q: I see, So you were in a supervisory position.",
        "Q: Good, very good. Were the Germans that participated under oath. When I say those who\nsent out the fragebogen and was there anywhere where they had to I don\u2019t know sign that like\nwe say here in the United States.",
        "Q: But they were not on any verbal oath or anything like that.",
        "Q: I think they got away with too much. Well that was another question I had. How could\nyou be sure that what they put down in their fragebogen was an honest answer, but I think you\nanswered that already. And you could check it unless they came from the east.",
        "Q: Yeah well. That\u2019s of course a big problem but and that I guess wasn\u2019t really eliminated\nuntil the 90s right when they got records. What did you hope to achieve with this de-\nNazification program.",
        "Q: And do you think you succeeded.",
        "Q: And that was under Adenauer or",
        "Q: Well I guess you were dealing here with what 52 million people or however many",
        "Q: Yeah. so you told me already where you were located right. And in Regensburg or\nwhere was it.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s where your work was located, in that part of Bavaria.",
        "Q: How long did you work in this capacity.",
        "Q: At the time that was in a DP camp in Italy.",
        "Q: Well beyond that even and so August I guess of 46. Ok. What are some of the most\nmemorable incidents that you remember from that period. You already told me about the guy\nwho said you had your day. I mean we had our day, now you have your day. I\u2019m sure you came\nacross a number of other memorable incidents with these people.",
        "Q: The highest removal. Yeah",
        "Q: Well Bavaria is sort of Hitler country, perhaps that\u2019s why. Munich that\u2019s part of it.",
        "Q: Ok but specifically on a one to one from an individual did you have any memorable\nincidents. That occurred with you know you speaking to any of these people or in conversation\nor",
        "Q: I see. Now you think that the program was effective.",
        "Q: How soon would you think was it watered down. I think that really is also important\npoint because was there already a new younger generation coming in or",
        "Q: What that they overturned this program.",
        "Q: Unh hunh. Well any other highlights that you remember during this period. I mean some\nreally heavy duty Nazis that were discovered in this way. I assume that perhaps through the\nfragebogen you did discover some",
        "Q: Anybody specific",
        "Q: Yeah I mean really big shots.",
        "Q: What about how was it justified that some of the Nazis signed this et cetera, ended up\nhere.",
        "Q: Or they would have fallen into the hands of the, of the other side.",
        "Q: Do you think, now let me ask you this. what are some of the strengths or weaknesses of\nthis program.",
        "Q: You\u2019re right, right.",
        "Q: Not that I realize and that\u2019s of course very difficult to make this distinction. And then to\nbe sure that yeah, really difficult. Did you were you able to obtain lists of Nazi party members.",
        "Q: I can imagine yeah. and probably to the great disappointment of some of the people.",
        "Q: there you have it black on white.",
        "Q: I had a question of how were the candidates for de Nazification chosen.",
        "Q: that you really needed in order to",
        "Q: Made the selection. Now when you say somebody else, you mean from among the allies,\nnot from within the Germans themselves.",
        "Q: Isee. So really everything all the, all the selection and I hate to use that word for\nobvious reasons, but let\u2019s just use it for lack of a better word. So all the selections were really\nbased entirely on the fragebogen.",
        "Q: Yeah who was going to be de Nazified or not",
        "Q: Did you do all the interviews yourself as well.",
        "Q: Did you do personally some of the interviews yourself or",
        "Q: He would do the",
        "Q: I see so it really was a whole teamwork.",
        "Q: Now the work load must have been overwhelming. As you said before, you\u2019re dealing\nwith a whole nation.",
        "Q: now this, that\u2019s a good answer because that brings me to another question. Did you, did\nthe United States have such programs all over Germany.",
        "Q: I see, I see",
        "Q: The Niederbier yeah. I see so this really was a well-organized undertaking.",
        "Q: I mean so what would you say roughly. How many people in your sector or in your\nsection were involved in this. Germans I mean",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well it was a vast undertaking. When you talk about the Americans having done that.\nAnd I was not aware of that either, that this was not an allied undertaking. I always was under\nthe impression that this was a cooperative undertaking.",
        "Q: Did they also call it de Nazification",
        "Q: So not a",
        "Q: Well and also a lot of Russians died because of that.",
        "Q: So let me ask you this. What would you say how did this experience affect you as a\nyoung person, in such a responsible position you know which involved really impacting the\ncourse of people\u2019s lives. Were you aware of your power. Were you troubled by the fact that you\ndid not have experience in that area.",
        "Q: Did you pursue psychology in the end.",
        "Q: Very nice, lovely. Well so you were telling me that so close after the war ended, this\nhorrible war, they had already concerts, theater, opera and dances and everything else.",
        "Q: I guess people are very resilient.",
        "Q: Yeah I know, but Hamburg was destroyed by 75%",
        "Q: yeah and were you, you said you enjoyed it. so I assume you enjoyed the feeling of\nhaving power over these people.",
        "Q: You just answered my next question which really was how dangerous or how hostile\nwere these people against the well the allies in general but the United States army soldiers that\nwere in",
        "Q: I see so you really did need a bit of protection after all.",
        "Q: You were not welcomed with open arms.",
        "Q: Well it probably netted them some chocolate and nylon stockings and other things.",
        "Q: What days these were. Oh my god. I remember them quite well still. I had a question\nwhether you had to follow a protocol in this process or whether it was you know partially your\nown instinct to realize who was honest, who was not honest, et cetera. What guided your work\nmore, the protocol that you had to follow or the instinct that you felt when confronting some of\nthese fragebogen.",
        "Q: A question just came to my mind. Most of Germany was mobilized into the army.",
        "Q: And these people that you dealt with were people who were holding office jobs or, or\nwere working for the government in a different capacity, not in the army.",
        "Q: How did they manage to stay out of the army.",
        "Q: but these guys in other words had that you were dealing with had not been in, in the\nmilitary in the Wehrmacht.",
        "Q: Well just a few months, yeah they may have been demobilized by that time.",
        "Q: how often did you come across or did they honestly",
        "Q: How often did you come across somebody who honestly said that he was a member of\nthe SS.",
        "Q: Nobody, I see\nA; No, we didn\u2019t come we didn\u2019t\u2019 come across many SS. I think they were picked up by\nother intelligence but maybe they were picked up before, before they got to us. I don\u2019t\u2019\nremember many, I don\u2019t\u2019 remember many SS members. I remember some SA members.",
        "Q: Yes well that was a forerunner.",
        "Q: Yes, well they were the forerunners to the SS actually I guess.",
        "Q: Yeah the beginning of the whole business.",
        "Q: Ok. How did it affect you as a Jew to be put into this position to work with Nazis and\ntrying to sort of get them back on the normal footing, on the, on the non-Nazi life style. Well\nnon-Nazi outlook.",
        "Q: AS a Jew.",
        "Q: What happened by the way to those people that were fired from their jobs and did not\ncould not be reemployed and enter the government.",
        "Q: Well this was Germany has always been a big bureaucratic structure.",
        "Q: but",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t\u2019, you don\u2019t know what I mean unless they ended up in prison. I suppose\nsome of these people had a record or a record came where they actually",
        "Q: well you said they, their finances were",
        "Q: Not enough.",
        "Q: Not enough but what can you do. You could have taken a whole nation and cut them off\nfrom the map of the world like Mr. Morgenthau wanted to do.",
        "Q: Yes, ok.",
        "Q: oh my goodness. Sounds really very intriguing. You did that in recent years.",
        "Q: how lovely. Well that\u2019s really a quite an undertaking.",
        "Q: Well that\u2019s always very, very difficult to find a publisher but I suppose you could\napproach a number of you know known publishers and send them the manuscript.. I guess that\u2019s\nhow you go about it. or you can go through some of the universities publish books. But I\ndon\u2019t\u2019 know whether you know, as a novel, but it\u2019s really a historic novel I assume.",
        "Q: So possibly some of the universities might be interested. I mean you have to start\nsomewhere and usually you know one person gives you an idea and another person and\neventually you may find somebody who does, sounds fascinating to me.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah right. well we don\u2019t\u2019 do any publishing. We have a book store that sells you\nknow novels and mostly authentic stories about the Holocaust. And but these are all published\nbook but we do not, we in the museum do not publish books.",
        "Q: You mean one of the sub camps.",
        "Q: I bet. And you found survivors there.",
        "Q: Mauthausen, was that in Austria or was it in Germany. Mauthausen was on the German\nside or Austrian.",
        "Q: Could be, I don\u2019t\u2019 know. I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: So how long were you in the army.",
        "Q: You enlisted or you",
        "Q: After Pearl Harbor",
        "Q: I see. Those were the worst years I guess.",
        "Q: So you saw a lot of battle though",
        "Q: Battle. I mean active warfare.",
        "Q: Of active warfare. Of, of battles.",
        "Q: Yeah, I mean you were in the trenches.",
        "Q: I see. Did you, you had a staff that worked with you, yes.",
        "Q: How large a staff would you say.",
        "Q: and you were, you were the supervisor. Of these 35 people.",
        "Q: And they had to report back to you of their findings et cetera.",
        "Q: Ok. And who were they mostly. They",
        "Q: Oh I see, not the American soldiers.",
        "Q: I see, so they were Germans out of the population of Germany.",
        "Q: they spoke German.",
        "Q: And DPs, also Jewish DPs.",
        "Q: I see. Well that\u2019s interesting.",
        "Q: How long would you say that this whole program last.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s not very, no I excuse me. I remember as a teenager hearing about this, papers\nwere full of this de-Nazification, de-Nazification but I don\u2019t think that we ever had really a\nconcept of what that really involved. I think that perhaps maybe only in my own mind, I thought\nthat it really was kind of a how shall I say it, yeah a curriculum that\u2019s probably the right way.",
        "Q: I thought it was like a curriculum of changing these people\u2019s outlook",
        "Q: But you\u2019re telling me now that this was not it at all.",
        "Q: And then you have the scientists that they needed",
        "Q: What were the dynamics between your team members.",
        "Q: No I said the dynamic between your team members, among themselves, the 35 or\nwhatever, yeah, especially in view of the , of what you just told me that there were DP people\nand there were Germans and then there was the army so how did all that work.",
        "Q: Well that I would believe yeah. You remember some of those stories among those\nhardships that people",
        "Q: Even among the people who were in a concentration camp and the Germans that they\nwere",
        "Q: Yeah that I can understand, sure.",
        "Q: But among themselves, they got along you say.",
        "Q: You did not notice any frictions.",
        "Q: Well I guess maybe they were all out to do the same thing.",
        "Q: That flag.",
        "Q: Do you, well I can imagine. That that was regarded as a major victory.",
        "Q: Well I don\u2019t\u2019 know. whatever we tried to do I hope we accomplished it in some way or\nthe other. Was this an emotional situation for you.",
        "Q: As an American or as a Jew.",
        "Q: I can imagine yeah. and I can imagine. Well.",
        "Q: That\u2019s really too bad. I didn\u2019t must confess that I did not realize it. but then at that point I\nhad come to the United States and I guess you know you start a new life and a new language and\na new everything. And somehow you leave these horrible events of the past behind.",
        "Q: Yes",
        "Q: Right now I\u2019m 81.",
        "Q: Yeah at 1946. After the war.",
        "Q: Yeah but you grew up here. I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: My parents had the good fortune of finding",
        "Q: Yeah well some of them came early. They were smart.",
        "Q: Well my parents found out that Albania allowed Jews to come in and that\u2019s where we\nwent and that\u2019s where we survived the war.",
        "Q: But you know the Germans occupied that country as well in 1943. Yeah but the\nAlbanian people were exceptional among the nations. Of saving, they were exceptionally among\nthe nations of saving Jews and not handing them over and not",
        "Q: Yeah, yes it is and it\u2019s not much known, not well known at all and in fact you know I\nspeak in many places, in schools et cetera to talk about that part of history. And it\u2019s really\nimportant that people have to know.",
        "Q: I believe so but I have this is actually the first time that they have asked me to do an\ninterview. You are my guinea pig. And so I really don\u2019t know the exact correct answer to your\nquestion. I believe it\u2019s going to be on a DVD yes.",
        "Q: Yeah I\u2019m going to ask the young lady who talked to you earlier and who interviewed you\nthe first time whether you know whether this will be on a DVD and whether they can send it to\nyou.",
        "Q: But I think it you know certainly going to be here in the museum in the oral history\ndepartment.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah of course. Well that\u2019s the big aim right now to get as many survivors. And et\ncetera you know. interviewed before it\u2019s too late. But I can answer a question right now because\nthe young lady just walked in so hold on one minute please.",
        "Q: He would like to know whether this interview will be on a DVD. And can you send him a\ncopy.\n(someone responds in background \u2014 mostly inaudible:",
        "Q: You will be sent a copy.",
        "Q: How many copies would you want.",
        "Q: Ok Ill tell them. How many children do you have?",
        "Q: These are the little dividends. As they say. But very good.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the best way of being in the army.",
        "Q: Well that\u2019s very good. Ok, you have any other little anecdotes or stories that you would\nlike to relate at this point.",
        "Q: In Regensburg",
        "Q: These are all very romantic little cities aren\u2019t they.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure and what happened not trying to be indiscreet. What happened to the girlfriend.",
        "Q: Parted ways.",
        "Q: Very good. At any rate it was a great pleasure talking to you.",
        "Q: and I think you very much for your time. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,\nwe all thank you very much for your time and",
        "Q: right. I am sure that there is so much material out there on many different issues and\nmany different topics that we do not have information on so you know we\u2019re trying to get as\nmuch as possible. You know this is really the only source that people can come to and our how\nshall I say, big aim in a way is to educate the youth, the next generation and the next generation.\nUnless we have all of this material on the website or available for students, for teachers, et cetera\nwe are really missing a lot.",
        "Q: I\u2019m very glad that you did. Ok. Keep well.",
        "Q: And likewise it was a pleasure",
        "Q: Of course, I will tell them. I will ask them and I will tell them, probably together with the\nDVD or maybe even earlier ok.",

        "A: No, yeah.",
        "A: So I went in the Army and -- and I was -- I went to infantry basic training which --",
        "A: It was North Camp Hood, Texas; which now is Fort Hood. And it was rough and it\nwas -- there was no running -- there was no plumbing and there were lister bags for\nwater.",

        "A: No, I think there -- there were showers but there \u2014",

        "A: Well, some were drafted and I don't know whether anybody else was doing what I did.",
        "A: I think there were one or two others. You know, I should say before I forget that, I'm\njumping the gun here, though.",
        "A: I was hoping that I would be assigned to personnel or classification because that's\nwhat -- that's what I wanted. And at the end of basic, they did put me in the camp office\nin classification which is what I liked.",
        "A: Well, basic training was 13-weeks at that time.",
        "A: Well, I did work in the office for a little while and I thought I had it all made and that I\nwas part of the camp and I wasn't shipped out. And then orders came through. I guess\nwhat happened was that the Army needed more troops and more combat troops so the\norder came in closing or -- or changing our office.",
        "A: I don't think it was more than a month or two.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: So then -- So, I was shipped out and along with maybe one or two other people that's\nall.",
        "A: And so I was shipped out to a the 71st Light Division which was jungle and mountain.\nAnd that was at Camp Carson Colorado. And that was in preparation for Asia.",
        "A: That was also rough and it was -- there was a maneuvers there -- in the -- it was\nraining and -- and there we had no light -- light infantry means this was a mule pack\noutfit. There was -- there were three light divisions: The 89th, the 14th, and the 5th. I was\nin the 5th, regiments, pardon me.",
        "A: The 5 regiment and the 14th and the 66th. And --",
        "A: Oh, mule. Mule pack.",

        "A: Mules. Yeah, we were backpacks and something else, I forgot. Light, meaning that\nyou could go without cannon.",
        "A: Without tanks.",
        "A: Without heavy trucks and stuff like that. So it was all on foot. But I think we had a\nkind of a cart. But another division was all mule packs.",
        "A: A mule is -- is a donkey.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no they were --",
        "A: -- mules. They had mules that carried --",
        "A: And they would carry things.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: But I -- I -- I --",
        "A: -- want to say that by volunteering and going into that --",
        "A: -- then I was just in the infantry and I was -- I was in the -- in the mud.",
        "A: One day a guy from headquarters that I knew was a friend of mine saw me in a\nfoxhole in the rain and he said Les, is that you? And he said considering your\nbackground, let's see what we can do. And so he got them to -- to think of me for -- for\nService Company, which would be classification.",
        "A: So then later, when I was in classification, I was in charge of getting the new men\ncoming into the outfit into their units. Well the new men coming into the outfit, by then I\nwas a corporal, the new men coming into the outfit were buck privates and they were --\nthey were raw like raw recruits.",
        "A: Because they had just come from ASTP. ASTP ended.",
        "A: And they were all shipped out of college. So I, you know, had the advantage.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: From the Army itself. From just --",
        "A: No, I think it was Colorado.",
        "A: There was one Jewish guy who was the newspaper reporter. His name was Irving\nWerstein. I remember him.",
        "A: The 5th Regiment was originally in Panama in peacetime and most of the people in it\nwere from Kentucky and Tennessee and they were hillbilly types.",
        "A: And they didn't -- they didn't know much about that. About Jewish or whatever.",
        "A: No, I think there was some anti-Semitism from somewhere but it wasn't -- it wasn't so\nmuch Jewish as it was city and college.",
        "A: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, because they were in much better shape. I mean, they were more used to\nthat kind of life than I was.",
        "A: Well, I remember one day I was huffing and puffing climbing a mountain and I said,\nI'm not used to this. I said, I grew up in Chicago where -- where I'm used to escalators\nand elevators.",
        "A: So, so he laughed. But later that night around the campfire, he told the other guys what\nI said and they in a taunting, teasing, hostile way. So I...",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I think I was closer to a couple of guys that were more city.",
        "A: That we were different from the -- from everybody else.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It wasn't. I mean, I just took it as life; something to cope with. I didn't -- I didn't try to\ndo anything about it --",
        "A: -- except cope with it. No, it's just the Army, that's all. I mean, I figure that's just\nnormal.",
        "A: When I got orders to go -- to go to the 71st Light Division, I did look up what a Light\nDivision was in the camp library and it said jungle/mountain, mule pack, amphibious, and\nparatroop.",
        "A: And then I -- I said God, I don't want any of those. And then it turned out to be a\ncombination of two of them: Jungle and mountain.",
        "A: But you know my son was a paratrooper.",
        "A: SO.",
        "A: Oh, 20 years ago or so.",
        "A: No, more than that. He's in his 50's so.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: My impression was that there were a lot of enlisted personnel in our outfit because it\nwas an old Panama outfit. It was a regular Army outfit, 5th Infantry.",
        "A: No. But -- but then there were draftees, too. So, there were both.",
        "A: Well, I think the newer ones, like the ones who were drafted, along with me, we -- we\nwere different, you know, coming from cities or with more education than these other\nguys that...",
        "A: No.",
        "A: In Service Company, the same regiment.",
        "A: But instead of Company F, which is a line company, and I was on mortar. I was a 60-\nmilimeter mortar ammunition bearer. And I thought that I was lucky to get that -- to get\nthat assignment because the mortar squad 1s a little behind the lines.",
        "A: Because you have to shoot over --",
        "A: You know -- but I was there were -- there were seven ammunition bearers in a mortar\nsquad, I think, or five or seven, I don't remember. And I was tail end.I was the last one in.\nSo I considered myself really lucky --",
        "A: -- that I got that job.",
        "A: So.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Just Service Company.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I don't remember any training. I think I had to learn the personnel situation.",
        "A: Personnel procedures and everything.",
        "A: That was in this.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, we moved to -- We changed to a Full Division from a Light Division.",
        "A: So I think that's why I got the job in Service Company because it expanded.",
        "A: Everything expanded and classification specialist, I guess, was created or I don't know\nwhether it was there before.",
        "A: But when we changed to a Full Division instead of a Light Division, we went to Fort\nBenning, Georgia and that's where we were. Fort Benning.",
        "A: I think until we went to overseas. We went overseas from New Jersey. We were there\njust very briefly in New Jersey. But --",

        "A: Something like that.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And then Colorado.",
        "A: Part of Colorado was in, I think part of Colorado I must have been in Service\nCompany too at the end of it.",

        "A: We landed in Normandy but by then there was no beachhead anymore. It was all a\nport.",
        "A: You know, so, with -- with landing docks and stuff like that. So we landed there and\nwe camped in Fort -- now what was it called, Camp Lucky Strike.",
        "A: Yeah, Camp Lucky Strike. Camp Chesterfield. I think we were -- the French called it,\n\"Lukey Streak\".",
        "A: In Normandy.",

        "A: I don't know, it was just keeping track of personnel.",
        "A: Shifts, promotions, I don't know. I don't remember how long but I know that when we\nstarted going across, I \u2014 I remember there was a town of Bitche, B-I-T-C-H-E.",

        "A: Well, at the end of the day, you know, we could go into town.",
        "A: So we went into the village and I would ask for -- for wine and there was something\nelse, there was two things. And of course, we were always in good shapes to -- good\nshape to barter because we had cigarettes and that was what everybody wanted.",
        "A: Chocolate. But I remember saying, (?\"Aba do divan\"?). Oh, I know, it was \"vin rouge\nor vin blanc\". That's right. It was only two --",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: But mostly red, I think. I don't know. I wasn't hot on wine drinking any way. I brought\nit back for the other guys.",
        "A: My parents didn't drink. My father would take a shot of schnapps only at a party or\nsomething. And he never was drunk. My mother wouldn't drink.",

        "A: With alcohol?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.I don't -- I'm not sure about that. Maybe I was interested in tasting it or but not a\ngreat deal.",
        "A: Well some of them did, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, there was some times cases of fighting or passing out or...",
        "A: Right, right.",

        "A: Nothing except that it was an interesting, 1t was a German city and there was -- it had\nthe buildings and the narrow streets and so on and beer and that's all I remember.",
        "A: Well, I just remembered that was one of the features there that they talked about.",
        "A: It seems to me that I -- I was suspicious of all of the Germans and didn't know who\nwas a Nazi and who wasn't and was kind of not friendly with them like I was with the\nFrench.",
        "A: Well, everybody said \"nicht Nazi, nicht Nazi.\" But no, I had a sense that some were\nand some were not but most were.",
        "A: Right. Also, we weren't there. We weren't at any place long enough.",
        "A: You know, well, we -- we got into combat 54 days before the end of the war; okay?\nInsdg ",

        "A: Well, see, I was in Service Company; so it was, I don't-- I don't -- We weren't in\ncombat. I mean, they were, the front lines, the line companies were in actual combat.",
        "A: And we were behind them, following them.",
        "A: So we knew what was going on but we weren't directly in it. Where we were, we were\ntaking over what had already been --",
        "A: -- victorious for us, so.",

        "A: There was one day, one -- one time that was dangerous. I don't remember whether it\nwas a truck, something was blown up or shot or something but.",
        "A: But I wasn't hurt.",
        "A: I don't remember exactly. I think it just was announced all over and celebrated.",

        "A: I don't -- A little bit.",
        "A: More by the officers, not much by us. Our -- our major-- our major meeting was with\nformer concentration camp people that were strewn, that were wherever we went, you\nknow.",
        "A: Oh, I would say probably from -- from Central Germany on; especially in Bavaria and\nAustria. It was the worst in Austria.",
        "A: No, I don't remember when --",
        "A: Yeah, I knew they were -- Well, they wore striped, striped like pajama like uniforms.",
        "A: And some of them looked like skeletons.\nInsdg ",
        "A: Several places across Germany and Austria.",
        "A: But I think the most -- the most -- the largest one was this camp that we opened.",
        "A: Well, that was -- What was the name of it again? During --",
        "A: Yeah. Gunskirchen Lager. Another GI and I walked away from our unit and just\nstrolling and we -- we came across this camp and we opened the door and out poured\nsome prisoners and some of them were so, looked like skeletons and -- and one -- one\ncalled to me in Yiddish and said, \"I'm one of you.\" \"I'm one of you.\"",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: He didn't. I guess I looked Jewish.",
        "A: He said, \"Haberach Monus (ph)\" have pity, have sympathy.",

I just, I mean, you know, we had a rifle and a steel helmet and we\nwere in full gear and they stumbled out and -- and some, he -- he dropped and I think he\ndropped dead. And there was some who dropped dead and some just started flowing out\nso we ran back to our unit to try to get medics and to try to get everybody involved.\nInsdg ",
        "A: No, I had seen -- we had seen others before.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I think it was a few.",
        "A: I think so, yeah.",
        "A: That they were concentration camp prisoners.",
        "A: Because I read about them.",
        "A: I don't know. Maybe, maybe the Yank paper, maybe the GI paper or -- or well, I knew\nabout concentration camps from the time I was a civilian.",

        "A: I think -- I think they did. I think there was some discussion about tt.",
        "A: No, I don't. No. In military government we learned a lot about it.",

        "A: -- that was later.",
        "A: You know, I'm a little confused about prisoners of -- German prisoners of war that\nwere huddled together in trucks and they were carried, they were driven away from\nwhere they were captured and prisoners of -- and concentration camp prisoners with the\nstriped uniforms in trucks. It seems to me that I saw them in trucks, too but I'm not sure\nthat they were rescued and carried and that I -- we passed some of them on the roads. I\ndon't know, I just felt that I knew about concentration camps and prisoners well before\nthat time and that we saw some.",

        "A: And I had a few years of college credit in psychology and I guess they thought that --\nthat I could do it. So I was only 22 years old, but I wanted it and they thought I could do\nit, so they trained me to fill his spot.",
        "A: Yes, it was.",

        "A: We had the highest number of -- of -- what you call it, of screenings, we had the\nhighest number of evaluations and removals of people from their jobs, Nazis, than\nanyone else in the U.S. Zone. We had -- we were very successful.\nInsdg ",
        "A: That what?",
        "A: Well, they didn't do it, we did it, we removed them. We-- we evaluated them.",
        "A: This was the U.S. government, it wasn't the Germans.",

        "A: -- 1n important jobs, like in the government and in important jobs, --",
        "A: -- administrative jobs and we removed thousands and that-- that was our mission, to\ncleanse the new government of -- of Nazis as much as possible at the higher levels.

        "A: I was there from September to May '46. And we were very-- we were very aggressive\nin pursuing Nazis and getting them out of office.",
        "A: And some people -- I mean I understand the Germans themselves felt that it wasn't\nworth doing or something, I don't know. One -- I remember one Nazi party official that\nwe removed from office said to me that he had -- he had his days of glory and now -- and\nnow it's turned over, so, you know, it's --",

        "A: -- had an intact record center that had all the Nazi records. So people from the local\narea we could check on, so we had --",

        "A: I mean we didn't expect to change their ideology.\nInsdg ",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Not at all, it was a joy.",

        "A: And we had a staff of evaluators that were about 30 people.",
        "A: And there were -- they went over them and -- and they would come to me and say this\none looks suspicious or this one, you know, and so on, but they would -- there were --\nthere were procedures to follow.",

        "A: And so each individual would get a rating.\nInsdg ",
        "A: That would be the conclusion. And then if they were in the four or five, they would be\nremoved from office or not hired and their bank account would be frozen and their\nproperty could be seized and used by the Allies, by the Americans for, you know, like\nhomes could be used for troops.",
        "A: The evaluation process?",
        "A: Just -- just -- 1t was -- I don't know, I would say anywhere from an hour to a couple of\ndays.",
        "A: It depended on if there were any complications, because we also had a special\ninvestigations unit that would look into difficult case -- cases that were, you know, harder\nto figure out.",

        "A: Oh, no, no. No, it was strictly \u2014",
        "A: It was, yeah, strictly screening, no attempt to change them or argue with them.",
        "A: Well, I would say the main attitude was to try to get out of it, you know, to say that\nthey were innocent.",
        "A: \"Nicht Nazi, Nicht Nazi\" was -- was their motto. There was one case -- -",
        "A: There was one case I remember where this man said that-- that he understands that the\ntables were turned and he had his days of glory and now his side has lost and he's\nInsdg \nprepared to take the consequences, and he -- you know, he said well, we had our day and\nnow you have your day.

        "A: For anybody to do that. Most of them were\u2014made excuses. You know, they said they\nwere forced or that they were not really a Nazi and so on. And of course the people from\n-- who came from East Germany, there was no way to check.",
        "A: Right.",

        "A: I don't -- I don't remember any specific.",
        "A: Well, it was effective while we were doing it, but it was -- but it was overturned; you\nknow, it was watered down and then it was done away with.",

        "A: You know, and they were serious and people were removed and gradually jobs were --\nwere given to people who were not Nazis. There weren't many -- there weren't many\naround, you know. There was -- practically everybody was in the Nazi party because of\nthe mandatory membership --",

        "A: I guess so. I don't -- I don't really know. It might be that an order went in from military\ngovernment that everybody in a certain industry had to submit a fragebogen.",
        "A: On -- all the selection?",
        "A: Oh. Well, it started with the fragebogen.",
        "A: Then if there were questions or suspicions, then -- then there would be interviews and\nfurther investigations.",
        "A: Did what?",
        "A: No. We had an American GI originally from Germany who was a special investigator\nand he would -- he would do them.",

        "A: -- at the destruction that the Germans did of Russia.\nInsdg ",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: And having a lot of the luxuries of -- of, you know, living well.",
        "A: I mean there were also the problems of being away from home and living in -- still\nliving in a hostile environment. I mean we weren't -- you know, it was dangerous to walk\ndown the streets alone at night.",
        "A: Well, they were -- there were always stories about an attack. You know, there were --\nthere were German Army veterans, was Hitler Youth former members, there were true\nbelievers. There were stories that there were attacks on GIs and -- but I don't remember\nInsdg \nthat anybody in our unit was attacked, but -- but we were always careful. I mean I\nremember walk -- walking down the street myself at night, like if I took my girlfriend\nhome, and then I would walk back to my hotel, I would carry a knife.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, no. Although many of them acted that way.",

        "A: And cigarettes were very important, cigarettes and chocolate and stockings, yeah.",
        "A: Probably both. You know, for instance if there was a contradiction in dates or\nfunctions or -- see I -- I didn't -- I wasn't an evaluator myself, I was the head of the unit,\nso the evaluator would come to me with a question. They would say here's -- here's a\nInsdg \nfragebogen where this guy answers this and this place and that on that place and it looks\nlike a contradiction and so on, so they would come to me with questions.",
        "A: But they would -- they would do the evaluations, I wouldn't, but I would train them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: How what?",
        "A: Oh, nobody.",

        "A: By the way, I wanted to ask you \u2014",
        "A: -- kind of a far out question.",
        "A: I have written a novel based on my experience there.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, by the way, when I was in the infantry, we had opened -- we had opened a\nconcentration camp as -- I was in Patton's Army as we swept across France, Germany and\nAustria and it was almost like a different town every-- every day the advance was so fast",
        "A: -- but we-- we came upon a Mauthausen.\nInsdg ",
        "A: And our unit opened one of the camps of Mauthausen.",

        "A: '43 and '46. And then I was -- I was put in the infantry.",
        "A: So -- but I was -- I was put in classification, so I was the head of the classification part\nof the infantry regiment, which is a personnel, so --",

        "A: Warfare?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, yeah, right. No, I saw a lot, but I was not in -- I was not actually in the front\nline. I was in service -- service company, which 1s -- which is in -- it's an infantry\nregiment, but it's -- but it's -- it's -- it's the clerks and the drivers and the supply people --\nInsdg ",
        "A: -- and so on, SO we were -- we were a little behind. We were not in -- in the foxholes.",

        "A: Well, as I understand -- as I understand, it didn't last much longer after I left. That\nsomehow with the new government they changed the thing, maybe the whole program\nlasted a year or a year and a half.",
        "A: Oh, uh-huh.",
        "A: Oh, no.\nInsdg ",
        "A: No, it was never -- it was never like that.",
        "A: It was political screening.",

        "A: So that was okay.",
        "A: Yeah. Seems to me they got along fine. I don't know.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah, exactly. No, we were all doing an important job, we -- we realized that, and it\nwas -- it was Nazi hunting, and, you know, somebody would find a fragebogen that\nwould have a contradiction in it or show something or -- or some -- something would\ncome up from the record center showing that somebody that we had screened turned out\nInsdg \nto be an important Nazi office holder, they would come into my office and hold it up like\nvictory. Yeah, look what we found.",

        "A: Just the army, that\u2019s all. I mean you know what, I figured that\u2019s just normal and when I\ngot orders to go to the 71\u201c light division, I did look up what a light division was in the camp\nlibrary. And it said jungle, mountain, mule pack, amphibious and paratroop.",
        "A: and then I, then I said god I don\u2019t want any of those and then it turned out to be a\nInsdg \ncombination of two of them, jungle and mountain. But you know my son was a paratrooper so",

        "A: No, yeah. right.",
        "A: No we moved to we changed to a full division from a light division so I think that\u2019s why I\ngot the job in service company because it expanded everything expanded. And classification\nspecialist I guess was created or I don\u2019t know whether it was there before. But when we changed\nto a full division instead of a light division we went to Fort Benning Georgia, and that\u2019s where\nwe were Fort Benning.",

And I heard about military government needing people so I applied for a transfer\nand I got it and they transferred me to Regensburg and when I went to, was put into public safety\nspecial branch. And it turned out that the head of de-Nazification, the enlisted man who was the\nhead of, the title was Chief Clerk, that he was leaving in a few days. And I had a few years of\ncollege credit in psychology and I guess they thought that, that I could do it. So I was only 22\nyears old but I wanted it and they thought I could do it. So they trained me to fill his spot.",
        "A: Yes it was.\nInsdg ",
        "A: Well in our district which was the state was Niederbeir and Oberfaus where Regensburg\nis. We had the highest number of what you call it screenings. We had the highest number of\nevaluations and removals of people from their jobs, Nazis, than anyone else in the US Zone. We\nhad, we were very successful.",
        "A: Well they didn\u2019t do it. We did it. We removed them. We evaluated them. And this is the\nUS government. It wasn\u2019t the Germans.",
        "A: We removed them from office in important jobs like in the government and in important\njobs, administrative jobs and we removed thousands. And that was our mission. To cleanse the\nnew government of Nazis as much as possible, at the higher levels. I mean at the lower levels,\nthere were many Nazi party members but we kept, if they were, if they had joined the party after\nsummer of 37, they were considered ok.",
        "A: If they hadn\u2019t held any po, any official position.",

        "A: Oh yeah well the ones who were suspected of being war criminals, we didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t\nprocess them. We turned them over to counter intelligence, you know to intelligence. And but we\ndidn\u2019t deal with those.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, it didn\u2019t last long though. We understood, I understand that it changed about you\nknow in 1946 I think it was, late 1946. I was there only until May 46. I was there from\nSeptember to May 46. And we were very, we were very aggressive in pursuing Nazis and\ngetting them out of office. And some people I mean I understand the Germans themselves felt\nthat it wasn\u2019t worth doing or something. I don\u2019t know. One I remember one Nazi party official\nthat we removed from office. Said to me that he had his days of glory and now it\u2019s turned over\nso you know it\u2019s wasn\u2019t worth it.",

        "A: the people who were screened.",
        "A: well yeah, filled out the fragebogen and handed it in.",
        "A: Well that\u2019s an interesting question because a lots, many Germans came from the east\nzone. And there were no records to check on their responses. But in our zone, 1n our area,\nRegensburg itself had an intact record center that had all the Nazi records. So people from the\nlocal area we could check on. So we had so we had a routine check in the record center, in\nRegensburg on everybody. People who came from Poland or east Germany, whatever, we had\nno way of checking on them so of course they were more susp, they were more suspicious.",

        "A: yes.",
        "A: Well not to get the Nazi ideology out of them but to, to keep the ones that were more\nserious Nazis out of important jobs. I mean we didn\u2019t expect to change their ideology.\nInsdg ",
        "A: Not at all. It was a joy.",
        "A: You know I\u2019m Jewish.",
        "A: So I you know I saw that as a good kind of revenge.",
        "A: My interpreter was also Jewish. He was a German Jewish refugee who was in the army.",
        "A: Oh yeah, well that\u2019s in the north.",
        "A: Well we had the fragebogens. And they would come in and they would have to be\nevaluated. And we had a staff of evaluators that were about 30 people. And there were they\nwent over them and they would come to me with say this one looks suspicious and this one. You\nknow and so on but there were, there were procedures to follow.",
        "A: Yeah",
        "A: No, one to one\nInsdg ",
        "A: Well each, each questionnaire was, it was a separate investigation. A separate, a separate\nprocedure for each individual.",
        "A: The procedure was to evaluate their questionnaire and to come up with a rating and there\nwere five categories. You know. you know those five categories. Number one is mandatory\nremoval. Number 2 is discretionary adverse recommendation. Number 3 is discretionary no\nrecommendation. Number 4 1s no evidence of anti, no evidence of Nazi activity. And number 5\nwas evidence of anti-Nazi activity.",
        "A: And so each individual would get a rating that would be the conclusion and then if they\nwere in the 4 or 5 they would be removed from office or un, not hired and their bank account\nwould be frozen and their property could be seized and used by the allies, by the Americans for\nyou know like homes could be used for troops.",
        "A: The evaluation process.\nQ; Yeah.",
        "A: Just, just. It was I don\u2019t\u2019 know. I would say anywhere from an hour to a couple of days.\nIt depended on if there were any complications because we also had a special investigations unit\nthat would look into difficult cases that were you know harder to figure out.",
        "A: You know they might go to interrogate some other people or try to get other records or\nwhatever.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t necessarily interview them either. Most were, the action in most cases was\ntaken on the basis of the questionnaire alone. We would bring them in for interviews 1f we had\nquestions.",
        "A: that\u2019s right.\nInsdg ",
        "A: Oh no, no it was strictly",
        "A: Yeah it was strictly screening. No attempt to change them. or, or argue with them.",
        "A: Well I would say the main attitude was to try to get out of it. you know to say that they\nwere innocent. You know nicht Nazi, Nicht Nazi was, was their motto. There was",
        "A: There was one case I remember where this man said that he understands that the tables\nare turned and he had his days of glory and now his side had lost and he\u2019s prepared to take the\nconsequences. And he you know he said well we had our day and now you have your day. Well\nthat was very unusual.",
        "A: To do that. Most of them were made excuses. You know and they said they were forced\nand that they were not really a Nazi and so on. And of course the people from, who came from\neast Germany there was no way to check.",
        "A: Oh no. there was not attempt to change anybody. It was completely screening.",

        "A: yes I was well, I was an enlisted man. I was a ser, a sergeant. The person in charge of the\nwhole thing was an officer. A captain. And he and there was also a lieutenant. So I remember\nthere were 2 American officers that were in charge, but the day to day work was done by the day\nto day work of being in charge, I mean, was done by an enlisted man. And my predecessor was\nthe one who was being discharged. He was also a Jewish guy from the states. And I was put in to\nlearn, learn the ropes. And learn the job. That he did. Heading up the staff. Supervising the\nstaff.",

        "A: Also we had heard that the British were sitting and having tea with the Nazis and that the\nFrench I don\u2019t know, the French were either a very vengeful or just didn\u2019t care but that the\nUnited States forces were the most serious about de Nazification so we were proud that we were\ndoing a good job.\nInsdg ",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember any specific.",

I was a head of the unit so the evaluator would come\nto me with a question. They would say here is, here is this fragebogen where this guy answers\nthis on this place in that and that place and it looks like a contradiction and so on. so they would\ncome to me with questions.
