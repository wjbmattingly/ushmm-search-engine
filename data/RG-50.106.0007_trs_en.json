        "A: There were about 50. In half a thing, half a box car only, because the other half were\nthe SS in there.",
        "A: Mostly young men, yeah.",
        "A: I didn't know everybody volunteered, but \u2014",
        "A: Quite a lot volunteered to get out of -- out of Auschwitz.",
        "A: I saw what was going on. We didn't get no food.",
        "A: When they carried the food through the block, people coming out, they kill them, they\nshoot them. But they were going under with the food container and robbed the food\ncontainer. So the most of them was in the underground. Before they come to the block,\nthey had no food. But when we left there, they gave us a piece of bread. One loaf of\nbread, actually, not a piece, a loaf of bread, a piece of sausage and a piece of cheese.",
        "A: Each person, right. Till I get to the box car I had no more bread, I had no more\nsausage, I had no more cheese. I eat everything up. Then we were four days in that box\ncar to go to Auschwitz without food, without water.",
        "A: Auschwitz -- Kaufering. That's a commando post from Dauchau. It was not far from\nDauchau, camp number three, I was.",
        "A: Half were the SS and half were -- there were three or four people in there and \u2014",
        "A: Well, they didn't say anything to us. They just said if one goes -- tries to escape --",
        "A: Kaufering, yeah.",
        "A: I went to -- that was bad. Very, very bad. The first two weeks I think I lost all the\nweight. I was skeleton. Nearly a skeleton. I couldn't walk anymore, we were full of lice. I\nhad one shirt on for six months and that was my towel and everything. I slept in it at night\nand I worked in the -- at night -- for the first two weeks we were carrying cement bags\nfrom the box car to the cement mixer. That was going steady. Steady, steady for two\nweeks I did this. And I said to myself, if I keep on doing this, I won't live long. So I\ndisappeared always. I got caught a few times.",
        "A: One of the big halls with the lager haus (ph) where they place the cement, the\nwarehouses, and I crawled up there and I made a hole.",
        "A: I made a hole and was laying in there and I covered myself and I slept a couple hours\nevery night and I went down. I got caught a couple times, too, and they hit me. But it was\nworth it. It was worth it.",
        "A: Not good. Very, very bad.",
        "A: The barracks were all right. Wooden, wooden -- were wooden -- one long -- long --",
        "A: Platform, right, with two blankets each. And that was not enough. It was cold.",
        "A: December, January, February, '44-'45.",
        "A: Yeah, it was bad. It was really bad.",
        "A: Well, we had -- everyone had the \u2014",
        "A: A bowl. We got a soup and a piece of -- slice of bread. That's all we get all day.",
        "A: Oh, yes, oh, yes. They passed away. They all passed away. I buried them, too, then. I\nwas, after those first two weeks, the camp -- not the commander, there was an SS man\nthere, but the camp (spoke in German), that means the camp first inmate.",
        "A: He was a Viennese. And we were -- we were -- we were left nine Viennese and four\nCzechoslovakians and were singing at night a little bit. And this man came in at night and\nsung with us and he -- he is the one who saved our lives.",
        "A: In what way? Because he took us out of that cement factory. He put us in the camp.\nAnd we did everything. We digged holes, we buried the dead, we went to other camps\nwith the hand wagon to get some provisions, me, then whatever for the camp. And we got\nin the kitchen. And we were in the kitchen, and we were bad guys, too. We stole. We\nstole potatoes, whatever we put our hands on. That was our life. He saved us.",
        "A: His name was Neches (ph), Vichy (ph) Neches. I don't know if he is still alive. I don't\nthink so. I met him once after the war in Vienna.",
        "A: Yeah, I worked in the camp after. We didn't go out on command anymore. I mean\noutside.",
        "A: We stayed inside the fence.",
        "A: Until the end. Until the end. Until the -- the -- what, the Americans came from one\nside -- right now the Americans only came from one side and they closed the camp and\nwe had to march for at least five, six days. We were in a march from Kaufering to --",
        "A: Well, we only saw the plane flying over when they dropped the bomb. The lights went\nout from the fans.",
        "A: American plane, when they were bombing Munich. They were bombing Munich. The\nlights went out always and we were happy. We were lucky no bomb fell in. But on the\nmarch from Kaufering, we were supposed to go to Dauchau. But we came again next to\nDauchau, Allach. They called this Allach, the camp was Allach. And next to the Camp\nAllach was a German artillery, and the Americans were shooting in and the Germans\nwere shooting back. And every American shell that went to shore came in the camp.\nThere were a lot of dead people. But in the morning then it was April the 30th, April the\n30th, 1945, I was right. And I run away right away.",
        "A: No food. A lot of people fell over. A lot of people died, a lot of people run away, they\nhide. I don't know what happened.",
        "A: I tried once, but I came back. I had always my future brother-in-law was with me all\nthe time.",
        "A: No, no, we know him in Vienna. That's my wife's -- my wife's brother.",
        "A: In Theresienstadt, in Auschwitz, in Kaufering.",
        "A: Was Landau, Ivick (ph) Landau. He passed away.",
        "A: Always.",
        "A: He was older than me. I think four years, three or four years.",
        "A: Always together.",
        "A: I helped him, he helped me.",
        "A: Well, lots of friends I had.",
        "A: There were nine Viennese in that Kaufering. We stuck really together and we helped\neach other. We did a lot of bad things, too, in there.",
        "A: Not -- I didn't kill anybody, no, but I -- we broke 1n -- in the -- in the kitchen, because\nwe know where everything was, you know. We took the meat out, the sausages out for\nthe SS. The next day the SS over fuhrer came in and said we had to go in, we had\ntrucking transport, transport \u2014",
        "A: Group, yeah, thank you. And we have to search the camp. And that the oldest one,\nMr. Niches (ph), he had all the camp, we know where it was right away when he said, so\nwe went to each one. And he said this 1s the Red Cross. We had our barracks, the Red\nCross had blankets and milk was inside and we had the key. And we hide everything\nthere. And he went inside, Mr. Niches, the oldest, camp oldest, got in and found it right\naway and he came out and (spoke in German) there is nothing inside.So we were lucky,\notherwise we would be hanged. Because the camp hanged a lot of people in the camp, in\nKaufering.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I saw people between the fence. They got caught stealing potatoes,\nthey put potatoes in their mouth. You stayed between the two wires for many, many\nhours. When they didn't want to live anymore, they just touch the wire and they fell over.\nWhen anything you steal, they put you between the wires.",
        "A: No. I had a will, will to live. I always had the will to live. I think I was strong. I was\nvery strong. I saw so many people dying, dying like flies, but I never gave up. And I\nalways washed myself. I dried myself in my shirt that was six months old. At night I put\nit under the blanket so it dries. And I was shivering, but still it dries for the next day to go\nto work. But I washed myself. The people -- the first two weeks when they were in\nKaufering, they had the cement coming out of their ears, out of their nose, and it was like,\nlike concrete. They couldn't get that off no more because they never washed.",
        "A: Well, we had a fountain, we had \u2014",
        "A: We call it -- it was a little hot, a faucet around, but no towels, no soap.",
        "A: Very bad. Very, very bad. The toilet was called the latrine, and there was just one two-\nby-four, four-by, something like that, and everybody was sitting on it next to each other.",
        "A: My health went bad after I got freed. I had typhus, typhus. I got freed on the 30th of\nApril in Allach, and I went with Landau, I went --",
        "A: Well, the war is over and we live. That's all. I want to live. I want to live. So we went\nto -- we took a car from Luftwaffe and we drove to Salzburg.",
        "A: It was standing in the street with the keys inside. It is a long story, too. But, anyway,\nwe came to Salzburg.",
        "A: Got in the car and we drove. And I was sick, I was very, very sick. I didn't know what\nI had. And we came to Salzburg and they took away the car from us, but when they\nopened the door I fell and I went unconscious. So they put me in a Lazarette, in a\nhospital, in a German hospital. They didn't know I was in -- because I didn't speak a word\nof English.",
        "A: Something like that. I didn't speak a word of English and I didn't even know what\nGerman means. I swear that's the truth. I said I am German, I am German. I want to say I\nam a Jew, Iam a Jew. And I said I am German, because I hear that so often, you know.\nSo finally explained to me a chaplain that, I don't even know the name, Kaplan, Kaplan\nwas his name. He said don't ever say that again. So they put me in that hospital.",
        "A: In Salzburg. They put me in that hospital and that was -- the war ends on that day and\nthere were a lot of shooting going on. And I was scared because there were only German\npeople in there. So I explained it to them. Then they transferred me to -- they transferred\nme to Landis Kartenhaus (ph) in Salzburg.",
        "A: Right. They put me in that Lazarette, in that hospital with the German soldiers. I didn't\nwant to go in there, I was afraid. So finally they send me to Landis Kartenhaus, (ph) and\nthere I was about a month, month and a half.",
        "A: In Salzburg, the Landis Kartenhaus (ph). I still got (unintelligible). That's the only two\nthings I got. And I was there for about 30 days.",

        "A: No -- I was in the hospital and he met one of the kapos in Salzburg from our camp,\ntoo. It was a Viennese, too, and all of a sudden he came -- an American soldier came in\nthe hospital, and I looked, it was the kapo from the camp. It was a Jewish boy wearing an\nAmerican uniform. I said, \"How you got on a uniform?\" He worked for the CIC, and I\ndid the same thing. When I got out, I worked a few months in Hielbrunn.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I got out and I went to the American Army for a few weeks. I was looking for SS\npeople.",
        "A: They hired me. They took me in the wings -- under their wings. And they put me in it\nbecause I spoke German. And they were saying to me, don't say nothing. Just listen. And\nif I see somebody with a tattoo under the arm, then we know it is the SS. I catched only\none.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. And then I was with the Seventh -- Seventh Division, Seventh\nInfantry, Third Division. A long time with them.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: They treated me so nice. And I said to myself, there was a demarcation line between --\nin Austria between Linz, Wuffe (ph), and I said I want to go back to Vienna. And so I left\nthem and I could not go over to the Russian side -- they didn't let me -- I couldn't go with\nthem. So I came back to Salzburg. So I worked for the Rainbow Division in the kitchen\nfor the time being, and after this I got back to Vienna.",

        "A: I know exactly because my brother-in-law got a baby -- no. I got back, I am sorry, I\ngot back on the 24th and one of the brother-in-laws got a baby on the 26th.",

I got a few checks but\nI never -- whatever they got, my father-in-law, let him rest in peace, I said whatever you\nget, you keep. So he said three or four checks maybe, about 300, $400, that's all.",
        "A: Influenced to what? In what way?",
        "A: I couldn't learn anything. I was a dummy in one way because I was only a work -- a\nhard worker in my life. That's -- I could not go to school. I didn't learn a trade.",
        "A: Nothing. I am Jewish more than anybody else. I am not religious, but I am a Jew.",
        "A: Oh, people wise, yes. I still hate the people over there. It is a nice country. Beautiful\ncountry. But I still hate the people.",
        "A: What do you mean by that? Health wise? No.",
