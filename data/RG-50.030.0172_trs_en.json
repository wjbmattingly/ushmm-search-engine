(Crying) She got up immediately to go\ndownstairs to the kitchen. (Crying) Then all of my sister\ncame... Theresa she came. She said oh my God, Frieda 1s here.

She said\nwell go to sleep and go to rest. Tomorrow we'll talk. And next day my father was the\nworst problem. I was scared of my father. He said oh my God, what you did to us. I said\nyes, I know.",
        "Q: Did anything else happen that next day that you remember?",
        "A: Yes. Oh we talked there. They were...my mom was excellent. So my father said well.\nHe got...they got me out because uh they need me for work so bad and that he did\nanything possible. I said what did you do? He didn't answer. I know it cost him a lot of\nmoney and a lot of whatever to get me out because it was a miracle. My hair grew back. I\nwas ashamed to go some place, naturally, you know that some outside people don't see\nme and then one day my mom said well, your hair getting a little longer now. You should\nhave a permanent now, you know...the permanent came out but I couldn't go to the town\nwhere I come from. I was so embarrassed, so my mom sent me to Wels so\nMom said take some... at that time, you know, there was food shortage and things\nlike that...take some butter and some meat with you and give it to the some kind of\nstrange, you know, whatever lady to tell her to do your hair. (Crying) That's what I did.\nAnd I looked a little better already. (Crying) And then I put myself together at\nhome...kept busy working. My sisters were nice. They accept me again, but the outside\npeople...some outside people were bad.",
        "Q: What did they do? What did they do?",
        "A: Well, they just do angry...actually they do nothing to me. They just...when they saw me,\noh...there she 1s, there she is. She was...she was in a concentration camp because of a\nPole, you know. You know, it was like a big, awful big thing, you know, and it was\njust...I put just my life in from one day to the next, you know, because it seemed so\nempty, so worthless. I didn't know what happened to Julian. I don't know, so...I didn't\nknow what's going to happen so I just leave it up to God. Then one day that other Pole,\nFranz, he told me he got a card from Julian. I said oh my God, where is he? He says here,\nhere's the card and it was written in German. I said Flossenberg?\nFlossenberg? I don't even know such a concentration camp is Flossenberg. And then I\nthought my God, I wonder, you know, how he is there. My God, you know, to help him\nor something. So in time being, I I put myself together and I thought I'm going to send\nhim a package, but I had to talk to Franz first. Franz, you help me? He said yes. But uh\nyou no can...I I going to make a package but I have to take everything on my own. That\ntime we we had...on the farm we had over six hundred trees...apple trees in that time\nwas...pick pears and apples, you know...everything fresh picked. I though my God a\npackage like that would get there that they no rot, you know, whatever...how long they\nget it...everything fresh picked. And uh I smuggled in my room a huge box and I...the the\napples were there and the huge pears, the sugar pears. I wrapped every apple and every\npear in a in a piece of newspaper and put it in a box, one after the other, and there was a\nbig pail of onions in the room also to dry out and garlic. I put everything...filled every\nlittle hole, til it was full. (Crying) I put it together, carried it downstairs at night for Franz\nto take it in his room and the next day I...there was a a a non-working day. I told him that\nhe got to take this package to Wiesenkirchen...that's very far away. It's about ten\nmiles from there, maybe even more, on the post office because the other post office might\nknow what something fishy going on, you know, some somebody send a package to to to\nFlossenberg, but I put on uh front this friend Franz name to go for the address, for\nthe...you know, for who sent the package. And uh Franz said I not going to do that for\nnothing. What you give me for that? What do you want? He liked to drink schnapps, so\nhad to give him...Franz...a pitcher and fill it up with schnapps and give it to him. He was\na good guy, but he used to like to drink and he did. Took that schnapps that he carried\nthis package to the post office and sent it to Julian. After the war, after when Julian got\nout, he told me he received this package. You know, I was wondering if he received it or\nnot. If\nthey found out that I did it, because they were saying when I left the concentration camp,\nif you stay in contact with Julian that you...any...make any move...you going to be black\nand blue and a head shorter, and I always remembered that, you know, but I did put this\npackage together for Julian, you know, so it was a a big chance to take. My sisters didn't\nknow. Nobody knew. Just Franz and me knew itt, that I sent this package. And uh when it\ncome to the time when the war got worse and worse during the end, a lot of time I was...I\nI almost didn't hope that he...Julian is still alive. But I keep praying and hoping that he is\nalive. (Crying) And all of a sudden the war was over. God...how we start...how I find out,\nhow can I find out if he make it. I know his mother was from Tarnow somewhere. I\ngot...I got to find out if he is alive, whether or not even if he not come, not to come here.\nAnd spring came. It was nice spring weather. I was...it was on Saturday morning. It was\nMay 18th. I was sitting on back porch. Not sitting...was outside in the back yard of the\nhouse. All of a sudden the the the bell ring. We got a bell that rings through the whole\nhouse. We had a bell. I thought my God, who that...who 1s this? I hadn't even thought\nabout it, you know. Let it be whatever it 1s. My sister Theresa, she went outside and she\nsaid \"mein Gott' Julian, she said, and I heard that name...I just couldn't believe it. I\njumped and you know, went see who it is. Oh my God...there he is, but he didn't came\nalone. He came with another another friend. He...I think he was afraid to come alone.\n(Laughter) So...God, I'm glad you're alive. And then just happen you know, we were in\nlove and that's it. (Crying) But we still still was uh meeting secretly. My father was still a\nlittle, you know...but uh was no other way. He could see it's just no other way, so they try\nto help us but he said what you going to do? Nothing what you can I, you know, to help\nor something. What you do? Then he said, well, if we get married I going to get a job just\ntemporarily get a job and an apartment to live there and uh later on I would like to plan to\ngo to America because my father is there. And I thought my God...so far away...America.\nAnd that's what we did, you know. My father then...my sisters, my mom...agreed that we\nget married and we got married in a year later. It was April 24th. And uh we had a little\napartment in 01:54:00 Biesling. He was photographer. He was...he work in a machine,\nyou know, and things to make a little living, you know, things. It's nothing to brag about\nbut it was a job and then he arranged the papers to go to America. And my father said\nthat's the best thing, you know, to go to America because this is a land of the opportunity,\nthe future for all people, but still they would like to have us there, not to leave. Meantime\nour little girl was born. Then we left for this country.",

        "A: We arrived in March...March...I don't know exactly the date...I think also around the\n20th. Around the 20th March we arrived in this country and uh we lived three months\nwith my husband's father and then we got our own apartment. We worked in a textile mill\nand I was weaving. Textile mill...and he worked also in a different mill. Between time,\nyou know, I left six o'clock in the morning for work until two and he started three o'clock\nfrom eleven o'clock, so we had always somebody for our little girl and then later on the\nmills, the textile mill closed up. We're...we wanted so...we had a little bit money already\nsaved. We we said if it's an old house, I don't care so long we got our own little roof over\nour head. That would be nice for our children. That's what we did. We found an old, old\nhouse, farmhouse, very good land. I said you'll see...we going to make it on this. Fixed up\nthe old house...it's beautiful. Fixed it up, renewed it and uh first we didn't had any money\nto buy cows or anything. We bought little chickens, raised the chickens, three hundred\nfifty leghorns. And then we had the profit from leghorns, sold the eggs and later on we\nbought cows on the...bought young stock...bought fifteen young stock to raise to make\nsome money to sell it, so we already on on our own and he...besides he worked on the\nconstruction and I on the farm and then later on we said, well...he said I would like to go\nin some business.

I already knew it, you know. He\nsaid where are we going to meet? I said I don't know. It's going to be real hard, you\nknow. He said, listen, next Sunday, in Wels at the Landstrasse you're going to be there\nabout one o'clock, and that's where we meet. He came on a bicycle to Wels from Biesling\nto Wels, and I came on a bicycle to Biesling and we were riding up and down. We just\nsaw each other, but we couldn't...we couldn't go there to shake hands or to say hello\nbecause we were afraid somebody see us. And finally we went on a side place\nsomewhere, you know. We got off and we talked to each other and we meet over there,\nOK, and that's how I told him how to get there to Gunskirchen but he find me where I am\nand so he came a couple of times to Gunskirchen on a Saturday, late in the evening to\nmeet and uh, you know, it was very strict that we're said, you know, if somebody see\nus...my God, you know, we're we're...it's the end of us. And then he said yes, I know that,\nyou know, but can't help it. So I said it's so terrible on this farm here (sniffle). I would\nlike to get an easier job somewhere and he said well, don't do it, you know. I said well, I\ntry, you know, to get maybe in Wels maybe an easier...they need...they needed somebody\nto the factories, you know, and I tried to go to the unemployment, to the employment\noffice. I tried. And they did have a job over there and when I start quitting that farm, the\nfarm...the the guy was so miserable...he saw...he said he saw Julian there in the evening\nthat we're meet\non his farm. So he put me into the Gestapo that they're going to arrest me, and I\nnever could get this job in in Wels because I I left the farm so the farmer he was so mad,\nyou know, and he make me, you know, to to to told the Gestapo, you know, that I meet\nthe Pole at this and that and Julian and that they're arrest me, and so they did.

(Crying) She got up immediately to go\ndownstairs to the kitchen. (Crying) Then all of my sister\ncame... Theresa she came. She said oh my God, Frieda 1s here. First...first she looked at I\ndon't have my hair and she says oh you poor thing. (Crying) The oldest sister got\nup...Marianne. She also the same thing. My mom said are you hungry. I said no. She said\nwell go to sleep and go to rest. Tomorrow we'll talk. And next day my father was the\nworst problem. I was scared of my father. He said oh my God, what you did to us. I said\nyes, I know.",
        "A: Yes. Oh we talked there. They were...my mom was excellent. So my father said well.\nHe got...they got me out because uh they need me for work so bad and that he did\nanything possible. I said what did you do? He didn't answer. I know it cost him a lot of\nmoney and a lot of whatever to get me out because it was a miracle. My hair grew back. I\nwas ashamed to go some place, naturally, you know that some outside people don't see\nme and then one day my mom said well, your hair getting a little longer now. You should\nhave a permanent now, you know...the permanent came out but I couldn't go to the town\nwhere I come from. I was so embarrassed, so my mom sent me to Wels so\nMom said take some... at that time, you know, there was food shortage and things\nlike that...take some butter and some meat with you and give it to the some kind of\nstrange, you know, whatever lady to tell her to do your hair. (Crying) That's what I did.\nAnd I looked a little better already. (Crying) And then I put myself together at\nhome...kept busy working. My sisters were nice. They accept me again, but the outside\npeople...some outside people were bad.",
        "A: Well, they just do angry...actually they do nothing to me. They just...when they saw me,\noh...there she 1s, there she is. She was...she was in a concentration camp because of a\nPole, you know. You know, it was like a big, awful big thing, you know, and it was\njust...I put just my life in from one day to the next, you know, because it seemed so\nempty, so worthless. I didn't know what happened to Julian. I don't know, so...I didn't\nknow what's going to happen so I just leave it up to God. Then one day that other Pole,\nFranz, he told me he got a card from Julian. I said oh my God, where is he? He says here,\nhere's the card and it was written in German. I said Flossenberg?\nFlossenberg? I don't even know such a concentration camp is Flossenberg. And then I\nthought my God, I wonder, you know, how he is there. My God, you know, to help him\nor something. So in time being, I I put myself together and I thought I'm going to send\nhim a package, but I had to talk to Franz first. Franz, you help me? He said yes. But uh\nyou no can...I I going to make a package but I have to take everything on my own. That\ntime we we had...on the farm we had over six hundred trees...apple trees in that time\nwas...pick pears and apples, you know...everything fresh picked. I though my God a\npackage like that would get there that they no rot, you know, whatever...how long they\nget it...everything fresh picked. And uh I smuggled in my room a huge box and I...the the\napples were there and the huge pears, the sugar pears. I wrapped every apple and every\npear in a in a piece of newspaper and put it in a box, one after the other, and there was a\nbig pail of onions in the room also to dry out and garlic. I put everything...filled every\nlittle hole, til it was full. (Crying) I put it together, carried it downstairs at night for Franz\nto take it in his room and the next day I...there was a a a non-working day. I told him that\nhe got to take this package to Wiesenkirchen...that's very far away. It's about ten\nmiles from there, maybe even more, on the post office because the other post office might\nknow what something fishy going on, you know, some somebody send a package to to to\nFlossenberg, but I put on uh front this friend Franz name to go for the address, for\nthe...you know, for who sent the package. And uh Franz said I not going to do that for\nnothing. What you give me for that? What do you want? He liked to drink schnapps, so\nhad to give him...Franz...a pitcher and fill it up with schnapps and give it to him. He was\na good guy, but he used to like to drink and he did. Took that schnapps that he carried\nthis package to the post office and sent it to Julian. After the war, after when Julian got\nout, he told me he received this package. You know, I was wondering if he received it or\nnot. If\nthey found out that I did it, because they were saying when I left the concentration camp,\nif you stay in contact with Julian that you...any...make any move...you going to be black\nand blue and a head shorter, and I always remembered that, you know, but I did put this\npackage together for Julian, you know, so it was a a big chance to take. My sisters didn't\nknow. Nobody knew. Just Franz and me knew itt, that I sent this package. And uh when it\ncome to the time when the war got worse and worse during the end, a lot of time I was...I\nI almost didn't hope that he...Julian is still alive. But I keep praying and hoping that he is\nalive. (Crying) And all of a sudden the war was over. God...how we start...how I find out,\nhow can I find out if he make it. I know his mother was from Tarnow somewhere. I\ngot...I got to find out if he is alive, whether or not even if he not come, not to come here.\nAnd spring came. It was nice spring weather. I was...it was on Saturday morning. It was\nMay 18th. I was sitting on back porch. Not sitting...was outside in the back yard of the\nhouse. All of a sudden the the the bell ring. We got a bell that rings through the whole\nhouse. We had a bell. I thought my God, who that...who 1s this? I hadn't even thought\nabout it, you know. Let it be whatever it 1s. My sister Theresa, she went outside and she\nsaid \"mein Gott' Julian, she said, and I heard that name...I just couldn't believe it. I\njumped and you know, went see who it is. Oh my God...there he is, but he didn't came\nalone. He came with another another friend. He...I think he was afraid to come alone.\n(Laughter) So...God, I'm glad you're alive. And then just happen you know, we were in\nlove and that's it. (Crying) But we still still was uh meeting secretly. My father was still a\nlittle, you know...but uh was no other way. He could see it's just no other way, so they try\nto help us but he said what you going to do? Nothing what you can I, you know, to help\nor something. What you do? Then he said, well, if we get married I going to get a job just\ntemporarily get a job and an apartment to live there and uh later on I would like to plan to\ngo to America because my father is there. And I thought my God...so far away...America.\nAnd that's what we did, you know. My father then...my sisters, my mom...agreed that we\nget married and we got married in a year later. It was April 24th. And uh we had a little\napartment in 01:54:00 Biesling. He was photographer. He was...he work in a machine,\nyou know, and things to make a little living, you know, things. It's nothing to brag about\nbut it was a job and then he arranged the papers to go to America. And my father said\nthat's the best thing, you know, to go to America because this is a land of the opportunity,\nthe future for all people, but still they would like to have us there, not to leave. Meantime\nour little girl was born. Then we left for this country.",
        "A: We arrived in March...March...I don't know exactly the date...I think also around the\n20th. Around the 20th March we arrived in this country and uh we lived three months\nwith my husband's father and then we got our own apartment. We worked in a textile mill\nand I was weaving. Textile mill...and he worked also in a different mill. Between time,\nyou know, I left six o'clock in the morning for work until two and he started three o'clock\nfrom eleven o'clock, so we had always somebody for our little girl and then later on the\nmills, the textile mill closed up. We're...we wanted so...we had a little bit money already\nsaved. We we said if it's an old house, I don't care so long we got our own little roof over\nour head. That would be nice for our children. That's what we did. We found an old, old\nhouse, farmhouse, very good land. I said you'll see...we going to make it on this. Fixed up\nthe old house...it's beautiful. Fixed it up, renewed it and uh first we didn't had any money\nto buy cows or anything. We bought little chickens, raised the chickens, three hundred\nfifty leghorns. And then we had the profit from leghorns, sold the eggs and later on we\nbought cows on the...bought young stock...bought fifteen young stock to raise to make\nsome money to sell it, so we already on on our own and he...besides he worked on the\nconstruction and I on the farm and then later on we said, well...he said I would like to go\nin some business. I think that be a good idea, what else. You know, we not going to stay\non the farm. I said it's OK. We got a place, some cottage place with a yard. He had some\nstones for display and uh start his monument business and later on we found out\nanother...what we are now...it's a beautiful place...was for sale and we bought that place.\n[...besides I worked in a factory, helped him and he worked at the...with the stones. I\nworked with Dunlop sixteen years and uh that's all I know. (Laughter)",
