He was Polish\ndoctor and his family stay in this place, and my parents were very friendly with the -- with this\n[indecipherable] and her daughter. And he -- these two women, they were teachers in sch -- in\nthe school. I don\u2019t remember how many classes, I think only five classes were in the school. Fi --\nfive grades. Maybe more, I don\u2019t know. I went to first grade, and she was my teacher.

        "A: Wanska. Wanska Nadunietsin. It was the -- on the Dunajec river, between Nowy Sacz and\nStarzenice, Starzenice was the resort town. It\u2019s a beautiful, beautiful place. My parents used to\ngo hiking and -- and used to, I remember, on the carnival season, my mother used to bring those\nballoons and stuff and hang on my -- from the parties that used to attend. They had very, very\nsocial life. To restaurant in the nearby region. My -- my father had a good practice, and he was\nvery much liked by local people.

        "Q: Can you talk a bit more about his standing in the community? You\u2019ve described a small\ncommunity, how did your father fit in as the -- the town doctor?",
        "A: I -- it was in -- on that time in Poland it was big distance between peasants and -- and people\nwhich were educated. So they were all kind of lower -- lower class people that [indecipherable |\nyou call, and he had commanded respect. I remember his patients waiting -- he had practice at\nhome, it -- part of the house was clinic -- by the way, he bought an -- on \u201836, I think, he built the\nhouse for us, 1t was designed by his friend architect, and it was a really beautiful house. It was\nnever fully furnished, because war started. And he -- so people were [indecipherable] he --\nkissing his, you know, bending and -- and grabbing his feet, or kissing his hand. Now, that kind\nof relation between poor and -- and whoever gave them help, it always amazed me\n[indecipherable] because all my friends were the village children. I used to run with them, I used\nto eat in their houses. And I didn\u2019t realize that actually they did it because they needed my father.\nSo my -- I rather assoc -- associate myself with all those kids. We had fun climbing the trees, you\nknow, and --",
        "Q: When you had talked about your father getting together with the priest, can you talk a little bit\nmore about that?",
        "A: Oh yes, the local priest, which was [speaks Polish here] used to call him, he was a big friend\nof my parents. And my father was playing bridge, there used to be evening bridge with the priest,\nand the police, the commandant of local police, Mr. Polovich, and he -- the pharmacist, that was\na bridge party. And he -- probably they -- they used to drink as well, because drinking in Poland\nwas one of the social events. And he -- and also he had the friends around, you know, some\npeople living in the estates, which my father probably treated, and they befriend him, the Polish\npeople. He had friends, he -- we were extremely assimilated. I knew I am Jewish, but wa -- I\nnever went to synagogue. My parents never observe any holidays, except my mother, probably\nfrom [indecipherable] she never ate on the Yom Kippur, that\u2019s -- she only drank tea, I tho -- tea\nwith milk, that was her way of celebrating. But my father family was to-totally unobservant. But\nhe -- my grandfather was Zionist, and we have this little box of [speaks Polish here] we should\nbring, with money to b-buy land in Palestine.",

On weeke -- on Fridays, on Saturdays, on Sundays, my parents usually took off.\nThey went to friends and -- and they have friends, they have a lot of Polish friends, and a lot of\nJewish friends, mostly doctors or lawyers, and he -- from Nowy Sacz, or -- or from Starzenice, or\nthose nearby places, larger cities.",
        "Q: In general, what ca -- in general, can you tell us more about the atmosphere in the town? Was\nthat normal for Jews and non-Jews to be so friendly, or do you think it was particularly your\nfather was very comfortable --",
        "A: No, it was my father who was the -- actually, because in this town was -- is small Jewish\npopulation, which 1s actually large -- large Jewish population for the size of town. And they were\nmostly very religious. They used to walk in those, you know, dress, headdresses, and -- but we\nhad nothing -- at least I don\u2019t remember, I never had anything in common with these people. It\nwas the only place that my father -- mother used to go, they had some kind of restaurant, and\nevery fr -- every Thursday, I think, they used to have the market. So from y -- on -- in the center\nof the town. So used to -- so people from nearby [indecipherable] or the merchant used to come\nand bring, you know, those goods. And was a big ma -- great big market and people were\nmaking pots on the street, you know, and stuff like that. So -- and they were selling -- also, local\npeople were selling stuff on this market. But the only people that my fr -- my mother used to go,\nit was the local store. Her name was Mrs. Horowicz, and she always bring the chair and my\nmother had to sit down, and she chat, and then she bought whatever she needed, and she used to\ngo home. And the local little restaurant actually that was kind of in, when the peasants, whoever\nthey sold the goods on the market used to drink, they live out of vodka, you know, and -- and this\nwoman was very observant. And I call her [speaks Polish here] gran-grandmother Haiya. And\nthey used to go there, is always fascinated me. And on high holiday, where you didn\u2019t bring the\nbre -- eat the bread, I used to bring with my sandwich, and she didn\u2019t know how to get me out\nbecause I -- I was spoiling her holiday. And so the only family I remember that\u2019s from the town,\nbut we had really nothing in common in -- except they were my pa -- father patients.",
        "Q: I -- I don\u2019t know if -- how did you think about the observant Jews? Did you consider yourself\na part of them in some way, or separate?",
        "A: Totally separate.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It was like, you know, having some Muslim community here, and you don\u2019t belong there.\nThat what I felt. It means -- I never thought about it. I f -- consider myself Polish. My father was\na great Polish patriot, he was in Polish army when he was a young 18 years old boy, he escaped\nto Pulsudski legion, and he fought for independent and probably that why he had all those\nfriends. And later on he graduate from Lvov, from university in Lvov, and then he went to\nVienna, to the -- for his training and then he was in Krakow.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The only time that I remember really anti-Semite is just before war, that I faced that. My\nmother send me to Mrs. Horowicz to buy something, and it was a group of young boys, young\npeople, in front of the store, and they didn't let me -- anybody -- get to the store, and they\ndirected everybody to store -- Polish store which opened next door. So I was afraid and I went to\nthis Polish store and I bought whatever it was. I was eight years old in that time. And when I\nbring it home, I told my mother what happened, I couldn\u2019t go to buy -- bought at this place, she\nasked me to return it. And maybe because my father has -- was -- had the standing, he -- and he\nasked me to go to Mrs. Horowicz, so I went, nobody touched me. But the first time I saw, you\nknow, this -- I felt what happened, really. But he -- we were kind of protected in this town, and if\nyou -- I really didn\u2019t feel anything because I was not privileged to -- nobody really told me\nanything. I felt extremely secure, and extremely important because my father. That\u2019s --",
        "Q: Tell us what your parents taught you about faith, or God.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing.",
        "A: It was no discussion in our house about faith and God. That was for -- I don\u2019t know. It was\nnothing against and nothing for. The first -- actually the first time I was taught about faith, when\nI was with nuns. And maybe because of my training, I was not really very convinced. I was\nbaptized, and se -- I was taught all those religious, you know, everything about Catholic religion,\nand I know -- I know til today, and I went to Communion, and -- but I -- it was kind of, you\nknow, very superficial. I was never very convinced, I was -- what my pa -- fa -- my parents used\nto, what I heard at home, that is not really important because you need to be moral\n[indecipherable] it is something that you have to face. And faith was something that everybody\nwas privileged to do whatever. They didn\u2019t -- they were not [indecipherable] fighting\n[indecipherable] but it was total freedom of your thinking.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit more about that, that your parents said you had to be moral inside, so\nthey -- they really were talking to you about really core values, but in a different way.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yes, I was taught values. People don\u2019t do that [indecipherable] used to say. And I\nhad to -- I knew exactly what is right, what is wrong. It was very strongly defined in our family,\nthat you don\u2019t do certain things, you have to -- you know better. So I was taught -- I saw it in my\nfamily that there were certain thing that we don\u2019t do. You don\u2019t lie, you don\u2019t steal, you don\u2019t --\nyou have to be helpful, you need to be -- you n-need to give, you cannot be selfish. That what we\nwere taught. You have, for instance, you know, what every child in probably Europe on that time\nwas taught, that if you see the older person, you have to stand up and give the place to the older\nperson. You cannot [indecipherable] yourself. Is -- is no-no. You don\u2019t behave like that. You\ncannot steal, you cannot -- you know, you have to be consider.",
        "Q: For example, how did your mother or father teach you about helping others?",
        "A: I saw it because my father was helping. I used to go, when I was a little child, he had those\npatient in the mountains, he couldn\u2019t get -- reach them by car, so they used to bring 1s -- on the\nwintertime they used to send sleds, you know, and he used to take me with him to those houses.\nAnd people are so poor, you know. When I think about it today -- they live in the huts, and they\ndidn\u2019t have glass in the windows, only skin from the animal skin, which was transparent. And\nthey didn't have a floor, the floor was just, you know, earth, and some wooden chips. And they\nsleep in one room with the animals, because is -- was warm, and these people were -- were so\npoor. He used to leave money to -- for -- to these people for the 1 -- because they couldn\u2019t buy\nmedicine. That why they kissed his hands, you know, and he -- they were extremely, extremely\npoor people. In this region, I think it were -- they were the poorest people in the po -- in Poland.\nAnd they very nice people, except they drunk a lot. I remember also that e -- when they have\nweddings. After wedding, my father used to have a lot of patients ti -- with knife si -- which were\nstabbed, al -- wo-wounds, you know. The -- the one family rebel another -- \u2018nother family, and\nso he used to have all those bloodiest people, they killed themself, they -- they stabbed themself.\nThey were mostly uneducated, they couldn\u2019t read and write. They didn\u2019t have electricity.",
        "Q: Back to the being moral inside, something your father and mother said to you, when you\nreturned the -- the grocery item back to the Polish store and went to the Jewish store, Mrs.\nHorowicz, when you came home, did they talk to you about that?",
        "A: No. It was done. No, I had to do what was right, and 1t was done. My parents didn\u2019t talk very\nmuch to me, you know, it was kind of -- they expect from me. They -- and now is not like today,\nyou talk to children, you explain to children, no. You just -- she told me it\u2019s not right, you have\nto buy from Mr. hor -- nobody can force you. And you have to go and return it, and you go and\nbuy from Mr. Horowicz, you cannot be afraid. And I was afraid. It was the first time, actually,\nwhen I -- and later on when we already left the -- during the war, went to Pinsk, and Russians\ncame to Pinsk, that was a first -- you know, this region of Poland was occupied by Russian.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And then I went to school, and suddenly I was between the normal kids, and then I learn who\nI am, you know, because they call me mountain Jew, I remember. I spoke with a different accent,\nI wa -- I had this accent of the village. And he -- in Pinsk, people, they spoke with Russian\naccent, with this different accent. So they call me mountain Jew, and he -- then I learned who I\nam.",
        "Q: What would they -- ho-how would they say that in Polish?",
        "A: [speaks Polish here]",
        "Q: Oh. Can you tell us about school in the little town you grew up in? You said you went to first\ngrade, t-tell us what that was like.",
        "A: Oh, that was great, because see, Mrs. Holibook was my fi -- both my teacher and she was\ngreat friend of my family, so I was very privilege in this school. But she was demanding, you\nknow, I remember I -- I have a problem writing, we used to write like entire line that would write\nm, n, n, whatever. And I couldn\u2019t write this a properly. And I had a lot of problems because she\ncalled my father and he -- she talked to him because the phones were -- we used to have phone\nnumber one, and if you call, you -- you turn your phone, and then you con -- and we were\nconnected to post office, and the post office connect us to whoever had the phones around. And\nphone number one, number one [indecipherable] of my father, it\u2019s very funny. So I was\ndisciplined, I -- I didn\u2019t have any privileges because they expect me to be better than everybody\nelse, and I was not.",
        "Q: How were you disciplined?",
        "A: I was not -- not allowed to go out. I was yell upon. I -- well, they even spanked me. It was\nnormal. Today if I would spank my daughter, she -- she probably would call police. But on that\ntime was normal, and they used to spank me.",
        "Q: An -- bi -- di -- tell us, 1s -- 1s there more you can tell us about school?",
        "A: I remember very little about the school. I -- they were -- they were mixed children. The\nJewish children used to go to cheder -- to Hebrew, to Jewish school, but there were some in our\nclass. And I really cannot remember the names.",

Then was Yerzhika\nPelovich and his sister. And of course we play. And there were some village children, but I don\u2019t\nremember names at all, which we always play. It was a girl named Roma, I remember I used to\nplay with her. And hi -- 1-it\u2019s rather visually, I can visualize, you know, the place and faces of\nthose kids, but I had quite a lot of village children that we used to play, and -- mostly boys. I\ndon\u2019t know why gir -- what happened to girls.",

It\nwas beyond the imagination. So it was better to go back and stay, you know, in our place, to go\nto [indecipherable] and we had home, and house and friends.",

        "A: They cross in pi --",
        "Q: I-If the Russians were in charge in both places?",
        "A: Because probably in Pinsk, authority knew that we want to go back to 1 -- to -- you know, you\ncouldn\u2019t arrange a passport any more, because they knew where we want to go back, so we were\ndone of the -- we actually -- they actually looking for us to send us to Siberia. They didn\u2019t -- had\nour names. And in Turka it was a chaos, it was a war. A-Authority didn\u2019t know about it, so it was\nsimpler to arrange papers in another place.",

They felt that -- somebody told them -- they\ndidn\u2019t have any children, and they decided, well, we are going to Romania. And they survive in\nRomania.

And he had Polish friends and all others were just skunks, you know? But\nhe consider Polish people extremely noble, and he -- he had friends from any, you know, layer of\nsociety, and he felt very, very liked, and so I don\u2019t think that with -- my mother maybe more than\nmy father, but he definitely w-wouldn\u2019t leave Poland.",

In Turka he was surrounded on the street. The German -- it\nwas raining and German truck, big army truck was stuck in the mud. And so they rounded the\nJews, mostly older Jews to lift this truck from the mud, and it was probably more game than they\nneeded to lift this truck. And my f -- grandfather was around that, and he was always very well\ndressed, and -- and he had the medal from the first World War. And that he was privilege of even\nbefore, you know? So he went to this German, he showed him this cross that he had, and he said,\nwell I am Austrian, and I fought for Franz Joseph, or whoever it was, naively. And then this man\n-- he was beaten so badly that somebody brought him home, my father took him to hospital, and\nhe actually didn\u2019t recover after that.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was that ever considered by your family?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. There was such will to live, you know. We need to be probably depressed,\ntremendously depressed to try to take the life, now or never. Now, now or never, never. My\nmother was fighter. He would never consider to take her life.",
        "Q: When you first got to Turka -- I wonder if we can go through some of the details, you said\nthat the family arranged papers and then, can you talk a little bit about your father getting a job?",

And he really befriend a lot of people\nin hospital. I even remember the director of hospital was -- that was Ukrainian town, too, quite a\nnumber of people were Ukrainian, there were Jewish Ukrainian and Polish people. And director\nof hospital, his name w-was Garbovsky, he was Ukrainian, was a -- and there were some\nUkrainian doctors, and it was a Polish doctor, his name was Gibywa. Probably Gibywa 1s\nLithuanian name probably was -- was -- was from Leepfa. And he became very close friend of\nmy father. He was -- he didn\u2019t have family, he live in hospital. His mother lived in town. And\nthey -- they just -- just click, they became friends.

He -- so he -- finally -- we had a problem with food, food was so scarce, people used to be --\nget hung -- be hungry and more and more and more, even Polish people. So the only way to have\nfood was to buy them from farmers. And we didn\u2019t have too much money, or at least as much as\nmy father earned. So my grandmother used to cut whatever pieces of fabric we had, and she was\nvery handy. She used to crochet, and si -- and exchange, you know, whatever she sew, for food.",

And he -- things have changed, the Gestapo started terrorize people\nright away. And it was this -- I cannot tell you -- give you facts because I really don\u2019t remember\n-- | don\u2019t know, I didn't know. But it was this fear. They immediately rounded and took some\nmen and send them to work, you know, to road work and mostly Jews, of course. I stopped going\nto school, school was not available. And he -- on that time we moved to the house, I told you\nthat, my parent -- parents ran and in the house, it was small house, belong to the old Jew who\nlive in one room. And one little apartment block was rented by family. I don\u2019t reme -- I even\nremember name, his name was Buchman. And that was elderly couple with a son. The son used\nto be the teacher in high school. And he was hiding, he didn\u2019t go out at all. He st -- was staying\nat home. We build in the basement, it was the -- the entrance to the house was the -- went\nthrough the kind of patio, cover the how you call that --",
        "Q: Porch?",
        "A: -- porch, we cover porch. And there was a basement and windows underneath the porch. And\nof course, house didn\u2019t have the bathrooms, you -- you went out -- outs -- the outside bathroom,\nwhich every family has a key from his own place. So we built in one -- one part of the basement\nwas so well hidden that we really couldn\u2019t figure out what happened and so they built their own\nhiding place with the camouflage doors. They put shelves you know, and you could just move\nthose shelves and open it [indecipherable] this room. And they had water in the place, and food\nstored, some dry food. And it was kind of crawling space that you could get to the garden outside\nand escape. So they were talking about hiding.",
        "Q: Who?",
        "A: Those two families, my -- my parents and Buchman and this old man. That was common for\nthis entire house. The German used to inspect the house, the Jewish houses and of course they\nraided them, they took whatever was -- had the value. So poor young Mr. Buchman used to stay\nalways in this place because they were afraid they will grab him. They --",
        "Q: Did they ever come to the house?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. They used to come to our house. It was funny thing because this Gestapo\nofficer was -- I don\u2019t remember his name, I could still see his face, used to -- they used to come\nwith the dogs and with his soldiers and himself. He, who had syphilis, and my father treated him.\nSo he used to come, my father used to treat him. In one of the rooms he arrange his little office,\nand next day the same man with dogs officer used to come and take everything whatever we had.\nOf course, he didn\u2019t pay. And they were always looking for something which was hidden, so\nwhen -- by the way -- when they left, the house was totally disordered because they always\nsuspected we might have a lot of money or whatever, jewelry. And was at least once a week. I\ndon\u2019t know why they raided us all the time, probably some other people too. And also\nBuchmans, and also this man.",
        "Q: So the young man, would he just be in hiding a lot of the time in anticipation of the raids?",
        "A: No, he could escape really, when they were banging on the door.",
        "Q: He would escape and then sneak into the basement hiding place?",
        "A: It was the entrance inside the house to the basement.",
        "Q: Did you ever hide there?",
        "A: Once, once. It was terrible, I couldn't get to the basement, so I lay on the -- on those shelves.\nBut they didn\u2019t come. They were upstairs, they didn\u2019t come down.",
        "Q: You just laid on those shelves trying to be flat?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Why -- why did you hide that time?",
        "A: ...It was the -- they used to call it the aktion that when they rounded Jews, and these -- or kill\nthem, or si -- took them with their cart to the forest. Because on that time they did not really\nexport anybody to concentration camp. Most of the time they used to take them to the -- to those\nbig cars, we call them buda [indecipherable] the covered car. And they take them to the forest\nand they killed them in massive graves. And we already knew about it. There were -- a lot of\npeople were swollen from hunger, begging for food. And you couldn\u2019t give them any food\nbecause it was what you need to survive. So when somebody told us it -- the German care --\nbuda 1s approaching, so everybody run to hide. And bu -- I don\u2019t know what really happened,\nhow come I was along. And I know they went to this basement, and they couldn\u2019t open this door\nany more, and I didn\u2019t now want it. So I felt that Iam so small and skinny, so I can fit on the\nshelf. They didn\u2019t come to our house. So, you know, we were lucky, but was first time I really\nescape --\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Can you tell us more about how things were going in Turka when the Germans -- once the\nGermans arrived? You were no longer in school. Did the Germans create any laws that you had\nto obey?",
        "A: Oh yes. First they started with the -- the armband with the blue star, David star. And I\nremember that we used to fabricate this at home. And it was -- my father found kind of plas --\nPlexiglas, you know, the ple -- it was not plastic on that time, that we used to embroider star, but\nit has the -- it was small, so you could turn it around if you need it, and hide it. And that was very\nhandy. When they caught you, the game was, oh, I didn\u2019t know it turned. I didn\u2019t wear it, from\nthe first moment. I don\u2019t why I didn\u2019t, and nobody ever stopped me. But my mother used to wear\nthat was made out of piece of fabric of this, you know, sle -- one which was made out of piece of\nPlexiglas. So we had s -- entire collection, and it was very important I remember, to have this\nstar done very precise and right, you know. And then I learned how to make the triangle, which\nhas same -- same lengths of arms, you know, so -- so e -- the second rule, which was the worse\nrule that I remember, was to cut the hair. The men had to shave the heads, and the women\nsupposed to have hair which are only three centimeter. So my mother -- at the first she didn't cut\nmy hair. I had braids, long braids, but I wear the scarf on my head, and my hair was -- so every\nPolish girl used to wear a scarf, so I look really like a Polish girl with my hair st -- hanging. And\nmy fa -- my mother immediately made the permanent -- perm, you know, so it curls your hair, so\nshe could have it longer, not three centimeter. And my aunts also, they all wear with curls. But\nthat -- they were those terrible rules. And then you couldn\u2019t -- it was marshal law. You couldn\u2019t\nget out of the dark.",
        "Q: Why didn\u2019t your mother cut your hair, wasn\u2019t she afraid not to?",
        "A: She didn\u2019t want me to be marked. I don\u2019t know why. It was a wise decision. Also, I used to\ngo and buy food for the family, and few people knew me. Really, one that knew me, really didn\u2019t\ncare. So she was afraid, you know, the German way, you are marked right away. I don\u2019t really\nknow, but I was very happy she didn\u2019t -- decided not to cut my hair. So I had this long hair\nwhich, I was unmarked, really.",
        "Q: Y-You could pass for a Polish girl.?",
        "A: I could pass for a Polish girl, Ukrainian girl. I was not -- also my behavior, you know, was not\nvery Jewish, because I grew in the Polish community. My language was perfect, no accent\nwhatsoever. So when I open my mouth, no I didn\u2019t -- I never spoke Yiddish, so I -- I didn\u2019t have\nany accent in my Polish language.",
        "Q: Were you aware when you went out without the star and with your long braids, or your braids\nunder a scarf that -- that you were passing for a non-Jewish?",
        "A: I tried to think about it. I tried to believe that I am not pass -- I am passing, yes. I used to go to\nstores, for instance. I -- one of the doctors had friend who ran the milk -- how you call that?\nWhen they collect milk from --",
        "Q: The dairy?",
        "A: Dairy, dairy. And of course they took cream out of milk, and what was left is skim milk that\nnobody wanted. Course today everybody wants it. Nobody wants skim milk. So he arrange with\nthis friend of his that I could come and collect the skim milk. So I was going there every day, and\nwe had s-skim milk. My father -- my mother used to give it to Buchmans, and we drank as a\nwater, which is probably very good. So that was my -- I used to stay in the long line, it was like -\n- I started very in the -- early in the morning before store opened for bread, a loaf of bread, and it\nwas only for Polish people. So I used to stay there, you know, and behave myself, that nobody in\nanger will suddenly recognize me and point it out, or s -- throw me out. And I was lucky, I never\nhad really problem.",
        "Q: You said you were very aware, and you knew that you were passing, and that you tried to act\na certain way. What was that way? I mean, when you were so young.",
        "A: I tried to be unvis -- invisible. I tried not to -- to be very polite, very, you know, on the same\ntime, try to be secure, to feel secure. I don\u2019t know really, it was kind of natural probably, cause I\n-- | don\u2019t know even if I act -- I try not to be afraid, that was the main thing, I try not to be afraid.",
        "Q: And wa -- and was that something you figured out on your own --",
        "A: No, it was --",
        "Q: -- or had your mother or father told you?",
        "A: No, it was kind of natural, I think. No, they never told me anything. No, we -- it was no\ndiscussion. I just felt it where I have my hair, and nobody really knows me in this town, and I\ncan pray, I can cross myself, and it is totally natural, because I did it from childhood.",
        "Q: At this point you\u2019re 10, maybe 11?",
        "A: 10 - 10.",
        "Q: 10.",
        "A: 10.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: 1940 - 1941, I was 11 in May.",
        "Q: Did you ever go to the hospital where your father worked?",
        "A: Oh yes. I went there every day because another source of food was whatever was left from\nmy father. And he used to get -- he stay in hospital later actually permanently, because he took --\nhe -- he stay on call, covering the Ukrainians and Polish doctors. So he -- and actually, he lived\nin the hospital. And he -- he used to get food and bread, and most important bread, and piece of\nmeat. So I collected it every day, and I used to bring it home to my parents, because food was\nsomething -- we never -- the hunger is something that you have to experience to understand.\nWhen person is really, really hungry, and he -- we didn\u2019t have any water, you know, no oil. And\npiece of bread was something that you couldn\u2019t get. My mother used to get grain, buy grain from\nthe peasants. And she used to grind it in the coffee mill, three or four, five times. And of course\ngrain has the left over hot skin that was grinded and she used to bake with mayb -- with pe --\nwith the -- make flour like that, and she used to -- if she had egg, she added egg, but most of the\ntime it was water and saccharine as a sweetener. And she used to bake on the plate kind of\ncookies, and yo -- if you ate these cookies, the -- this hard part of the grain sticks into your gums,\nand it was like ne -- they were like needles. And we used to spit that, you know, you ate that and\nyou spit those pieces. And we used to call it pluey carli because you spit it. Pluey, it is to spit.\nAnd that was food that we had and the -- some soup. I used to go out to the fields and collect --\nyou know, it\u2019s funny how many field wheat is eatable, and is very good. So she used to make\nspinach out of certain -- o-of certain grasses, which I collected, it was kind of sweet. And she\nused to cook it, and s -- it was kind of spinach, with a little salt, a little bit sweetener, and we\nused to eat that. And of course we had the garden, little garden whenever was place around the\nhouse, that she planted. She liked to work in the garden when -- even before war, she always had\na vegetable garden, she like gardening. She used to plant whatever seeds she could get, and we\nate that. So food was something that you couldn\u2019t get. Meat was absolutely inaccessible.",
        "Q: When you went to the hospital, did you have any interaction with people at the hospital?\nNurses, doctors?",
        "A: No, only this Dr. Gibywa was very gracious to me and he liked me, he was -- used to pick me\nup, you know, and I like him very much. He was very friendly with my father. And I used to\nknow some Jewish doctors, which of course I used to say politely good morning, and they don\u2019t -\n- didn\u2019t talk to kids, you know, so -- and nurses, not really. And at the beginning I went through\nthe main entrance, which had guard always. And later I discover the hole 1-in the fence. Ho-\nHospital, like everything in Poland was fence. So it was a big fence, and it was the hole under, so\nI used to go under in the -- through the hole, specially in the evening.",
        "Q: Why did you change your [indecipherable]",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want -- I was afraid of guard. I didn\u2019t want him to see me. I didn\u2019t want him to s -- to\nsee me taking food. So -- and my fr -- room that doctors used to stay, that my father slept, it was\na room with two beds, usually two doctors, a big cupboard, actually big closet was separate more\nthan cabinets that you hang your -- usually was locked, everything had a lock, everything was\nlocked in Poland. Apparently people were stealing stuff. So the key were you -- it was key to\neverything, to every little drawer had the key, you locked everything. And I used to knock to the\nwindow, it was pretty high, you know. Maybe it was not high, but I was small. Anyway, I had to\nstep on something to knock to this window, to batter the window, and they used to pull me up,\nopen the window and pull me up.",
        "Q: Who pulled you up?",
        "A: Dr. Gibywa, or my father, you know, when I knock. So, I didn\u2019t want to go through the\ncorridors. And then -- oh, they used to lower, you know, the container with food or bread,\nusually there was paper bag that I took home. And --",
        "Q: And people were waiting at home for the food?",
        "A: Oh yes. Especially my grandmother, and my grandfather. They were first, the older in the\nfamily and that\u2019s -- they should have. They really couldn\u2019t eat this grass and s-stuff. My fath --\nmy grandfather had ulcer, you know, so he -- they were elderly people. And everybody had\nwaited for food.",
        "Q: Who was in the hospital? What kinds of patients were in the hospital? Were they German\nsoldiers who\u2019d been hurt?",
        "A: No, no, the Polish people, Ukrainian from nearby villages. Some Jews from the town. The\nlocal population. It was --",
        "Q: So this point it\u2019s --",
        "A: -- yes --",
        "Q: -- fairly normal.",
        "A: -- it was a big outbreak of typhoid fever, because of hunger and dirt and the lices that\neverybody had. And so it was separate pavilion in hospital of typhoid fever. It was also\n[indecipherable] 1n winter, one winter I remember, the wolves came to the village and they bite\nsome of the people. From the forests. There were big forests over there, and they had wild\nanimals. And people develop distemper. And they br-brought to hospital. The first time I saw\nperson with distemper, and on that time I stay overnight because fa -- my father was taking care\nof the infection -- infected -- nobody wants to go to infect [indecipherable] my father was one,\nand I saw the person with distemper, it was horrible. Horrible, like wild animal. The first time I\nsaw it. But mostly typho -- typhoid fever, and my father was infected, too, he was sick with\ntyphoid fever. I knew some nuns in -- the nurses were mostly Catholic nuns in this hospital. They\nwere, you know, al-always walking with a white se -- dress -- had this dress, and they were\nnurses in the hospital. And they were very friendly with my father because when the Russians\nwere in, they really wanted to get rid of nuns. And my father suggested to this head nun that\nhelped me later on, why didn\u2019t you just dress? Take off your dresses and dress normally, then\nthey wouldn\u2019t even notice. So they did. And they liked him. They were very friendly with him.\nAnd he was always, you know, v -- working hard and very helpful and friendly. He -- he was\nliked, my father. He had this quality of the person that you like.",
        "Q: At this point in Turka are -- what are your parents saying about how long you might stay\nthere? Is there a feeling that that\u2019s a place that your -- the whole family will be able to stay for\nthe war?",
        "A: To the end of the war.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Oh, really?",
        "A: Yes. All the time we secure. We didn\u2019t want to move. AIl the time my father work, and you\nknow -- we were expecting that war will be over, we all are going to go back and life is going to\nbe the same as before. But probably the human expectation. And that what I felt, that it was no --\nit was no place to escape, you couldn\u2019t -- where could we go? We didn\u2019t have any money. No --\nnobody wanted us.",
        "Q: Some of the photographs in the collection that you donated to the museum are identified as\nthe Turka ghetto. Now, is that where you lived, or wer -- later were there -- was there a\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: No, I think that is a mistake. It was no ghetto in Turka. The Jews concentrated most --\ntogether most of the time. If somebody had better apartment you had to move, to vacate this\napartment to German, or to the kra -- Ukrainians or whoever. But it was no defined ghetto like --\nin Turka like it was in Lvov, or in Warsaw. It was no really -- real gathering of Jews in one\nplace. We had to move to the lesser pla -- apartment, or to one room only. Or they combined\nfamilies together. They have to vacate those villas, or houses, or apartments which were once for\nprominent people. But it was no ghetto in Turka.",
        "Q: And so there was never one period where there was a big upheaval and people were moved\nhere and there, wa -- 1t would just be one at a time, you have to move out of that apartment.",
        "A: It was -- yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay [inaudible]",
        "A: It was now -- the only time the German really terrorize, when they deported people. They\nused to catch men and take them to the camp, to work in camp. Later on every man wanted to go\nto work in camp because they felt it is a way to survive; they need me, so they are going to\nprotect me. That was the feeling.",
        "Q: What was your understanding of what the Germans were doing? At this point were y -- you\nhearing any inklings? Well, what was your understanding of what the Germans were doing with\nJews? Were you hearing anything about other -- what was going on in other places?",
        "A: Probably my parents did, because they were so much afraid of transportation. We heard --\nlater on I was, you know, the place was small, so I was more privileged to listen, they were\ntalking about killing. We are afraid to be around it, we are afraid to being taken by train to -- it\nwas the camp, th-they didn't know what exactly are doing in this camp, bel -- in Belzyce, that\nwas the closest camp, and was only camp they kill, so they -- we were afraid to go to Belzyce.\nYou have to completely give up all your property and go, and we didn\u2019t know what they are\ngoing to do with us. We knew about killings, they kill on the street. They kill, you know, they --\nwe knew about being taken to the car and driven, and they kill by gas, gassing people inside the\ncar, we knew about those cars. But it was always somebody else, it was not us. Everybody\nwanted to protect, you know, his family and his life. And he -- it was so -- 1 -- I-I -- I think that it\nwas psychologically so horrible that they did. They simply immuned people by feeling sorry for\nother people. You were worrying about your own life, your -- your family, and was -- we knew\nabout others, but nobody cry or feel sorry for them. It was one more day for us. And nobody\nreally -- people used to escape, probably -- I want to survive. It was secrecy. If we had a hiding\nplace, nobody knew about it. And we were afraid of Jewish, it -- it was Jewish police as well as,\nyou know, the -- they had this Jewish police which supposed to deal along with Ukrainian and\nGermans, with the order, you know, whatever. So whenever was si -- they notified they have\naktion that you have to pack 20 pounds and go to the train, the Jewish policemen used to go\naround and talk to Jews. And he -- they collected furs, every fur that you have, you should be\ngiving to German because they were freezing on the eastern front. So they took fur from the\ncoats, you know, every little girl had the fur collar, they took that and -- and the Jewish police --\npolice collected it. And they were obliged to point out who hide the fur, and they did. They did.\nAnd we hated Jewish police, you know, they considered them horrible people. But they were like\ne-every one of us.",
        "Q: W-Was there a time that the Jewish police came for your mother\u2019s furs or your fur collar?",
        "A: Well, it was the -- they came from house to house to let us know, and we all collected\neverything, and my father has the coat which was line -- it was fur, 1t was very elegant coat. And\nhe gave it to Ukrainian doctor, and this man wear this coat, and every time I pass by, I saw my\nfather coat, and I was wondering, is he going to give it back to us after the war. It was one that\nhad friends, you know, in the da -- dairy place where he used to collect me, so he gave him his\ncoat.",
        "Q: When your grandfather was beaten and then died, did that shift anything in the family? Or\nhow did that shift?",
        "A: Not really. My grandmother was suddenly crying nonstop. And I don\u2019t know how the other\npeople feel, but I was so angry with her. I felt that she disturbed the peace in the family. It was\ncruel of me. But you know, child doesn\u2019t -- I was very angry. I didn\u2019t feel sorry for her at all.\nAnd she cry for si -- weeks and weeks when she cry. I wanted her to stop. It was so much going\non on that time that --",
        "Q: W-Was the family able to have any sort of burial service?",
        "A: It was something, but I was not there. I know they buried him in Jewish cemetery.",
        "Q: Oh?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, they -- he die in hospital, so he was buried, yes. I don\u2019t even know where is his\ngrave, but probably my father knew.",
        "Q: At this point di -- do you think that your mother and your father are making preparations in\ncase something happens? Do you th -- do you know?",
        "A: Well, I think they were trying to obtain the false papers. But I don\u2019t think they have any\nsource that they could do it. And on this point they didn\u2019t yet. When things in 19 -- end of 1941,\nit was a really -- at -- horrible -- the -- the German probably decided to get rid of Jews\nwhatsoever. And the terror start -- was really unbearable. Every time they were rounding people\non the streets they -- there were more and more killing, and e -- and there were two big aktions.\nThey wanted to -- that everybody need to -- needed to report to railroad station with 20\nkilograms, or whatever it is, for deportation. And every time -- probably some people went and\nwere deported. But we always managed to get postponement, because my father was in hospital,\nand he -- so we stay. The family stay, the same [indecipherable] you know, the dentist, they stay.\nAnd he -- only in -- 1t was before cri -- after cris -- after Christmas or New Year, on fr -- \u201941 -\n\"42, Christmas \u201941 and New Year \u00b042 that it was this final aktion and he -- I remember the -- my\nfather was on the hospital on that time, and the po -- [indecipherable] Jewish policeman came\nover and talked to my mother. He -- I don\u2019t know if he was his patient, or he like him, or -- he\ngave -- tel -- he told her in secrecy that in the morning, early in the morning, go and hide,\nbecause Germans going to round everybody and that is end of us. And that was a time when my\nmother spoke to my grandmother, you know, and -- and Buchmans, and she send me at night,\nsend me to hospital to notify my father that she doesn\u2019t know what to do, that we are going all to\ndie. And that was a night that she really -- 1t was late, it was maybe one o\u2019clock at night that I\nwent. And I remember the day, it was seven of January, 1942, it was Ukrainian Christmas.\nBecause they were walking, you know -- they had a tradition also in Poland, they walk with the\nstar and with the -- with the Bethlehem marionet -- you know, little dolls and they go from house\nto house and they play and they get money for showing, you know, having the show, marionette\nshow, the doll show. And they were still walking on -- those young, young people, on the roads.\nSo when I run to hospital, I went through the fields to avoid them, to -- if -- I didn\u2019t want to meet\neverybody, I was afraid. And when I heard voices, I used to just lay down in the ditch. It was a\nroad, and every road has a ditch for water. So I was just laying down in the ditch, waiting for\nthem to pass by. And you feel like trying to go underground, you know, to the tunnel, to hide.\nAnd he -- of course, when I reached the hospital, the lights were on, so I had to really knock and\nDr. Gibywa, that was the one that pull me up to the -- and she gave me this little bag to give it to\nmy father, one that I found which had papers and money left over, his diploma, my birth\ncertificate. The marriage license of my parents. The insurance policy from Italian, you know,\ninsurance firm that my father took before war. She felt that it\u2019s very important, we have to have\nit after war. And -- and pictures. Were loose, you know.",
        "Q: She put these in a bag, and locked the bag?",
        "A: It was not a bag, it was like her cosmetic bag. It was like little -- little suitcase, leather, very\nheavy leather and had a very heavy lock. It was completely locked, and had the little handle, and\nthe -- she always used to lock it, that was her safe.

And later on she locked me in another closet, and then\nI was in the basement. And then I was on -- on the attic. Every time she used to take me some\nother place, you know, and -- and finally, after week or two -- I haven\u2019t seen my father at all, and\n[indecipherable] Dr. Gibywa, she used to take care of, she used to hide me. And he -- then one\nday she took me to the tower and I stay in the nun\u2019s apartment. And also I stay in the clo -- I was\nnot allowed to walk, because they could hear the steps, and to make sure that I won\u2019t walk, she\nlocked me in the closet again.

        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: What did you -- what did you do?",
        "A: Nothing. You are numb, nothing. In evening she used to come back and you know,\n[indecipherable] and s -- nuns that used to live with her, we both knew. And then maybe -- I\ndon\u2019t know how long it was, it was -- my time was just -- when things were quiet -- I was told\nthat my mother is fine and my father is fine, my grandmother 1s fine and I shouldn\u2019t worry. That\nI was told. And he -- one day she -- it\u2019s -- she came and she took me to railroad station, there was\nevening train to Lvov.",

And she was such a sweet, young, with smiling face, and I feel very comfortable.\nBefore they took me, they braid my hair differently, they dress me differently in poor, you know,\nlong skirt, because I used to wear those short coat and they gave me diff -- dress me differently,\nand she gave me prayer book to my -- you know, to my little bag, and she -- and rosary, and I --\nprobably she had some papers for me too. And I went with her with -- to Lvov, and nobody\nreally bother us on the way at all.",
        "Q: But before that, that -- I had understood that at some point when you were staying in the\napartment with Sister Jadwiga, was she teaching you something?",
        "A: Yes. She was teaching me prayers, which I knew, practically, and she was si -- talking to a\n[indecipherable] she was ta -- teaching me who I am, my new name, where I was born, my\nmother maiden name. And that was kind of -- she -- she used to do that every day, I had to repeat\nthat and tell her and she used to wake me up, what\u2019s your name? To make sure that I really\nknow.",
        "Q: D-Do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Yes. Marisha Borofska. I was born on 29 of different -- February 1929. [indecipherable] and\nmy mother was Laguinsky, and father -- and my father left her, she -- she die and sh -- he die and\nshe die and I don\u2019t know anything about the family. That\u2019s it. And I was in orphanage.",
        "Q: So what -- you would get up in the morning and she would make you recite prayers in front of\nher?",
        "A: No, not prayers, because --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- I knew prayers, but I have to give my immediate who are you, what\u2019s your name, just to\nmake sure that I really know what is my name, that I won\u2019t hesitate.",
        "Q: So she was teaching you your new identity?",
        "A: My new i -- identity, yes. She wanted to make sure that I am not going to hesitate.",
        "Q: And did your father come visit you at all?",
        "A: No, no. In that point I haven\u2019t seen my father and I never saw my mother again. Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you know if your mother knew what was happening?",
        "A: Yes. She knew because they even knew where I am even I was in Wamina, because she used\nto send me, though the nuns, she used to send me some cookies that she bake. It must be -- I\ndon\u2019t know how much she paid [indecipherable] to cook them, to do that. Or melted butter, I\nremember. You know, in the [indecipherable] she melted the butter, because it holds longer, and\nshe send it to me. And of course, I couldn\u2019t have that, so sist -- Sister Sophia call me at night,\nlate at night to her room and she used to give me piece of bread that she brought from her supper,\nand she put this butter on, and she said that\u2019s from -- from your mother. And I couldn\u2019t say to\nanyone, nothing. So she knew where I was, and she -- later on I met someone from Turka and the\nperson said that my mother told everybody that I was killed, I was taken by Germans. So she\ndidn\u2019t want anybody to know [indecipherable] question. And it was such obvious things, that\nnobody questioned. But what happened, when I arrived to Lvov, this Sister Blanche let me loose,\nshe didn\u2019t want me -- she was afraid that I might -- somebody might see me. And to make long\nstory short, this Ukrainian girl with her mother was on the railroad station in Lvov and they saw\nme, and they look at me, and I pretend that I don\u2019t know who they are. And they didn\u2019t even get\nclose to me. But when they came back, the mother went to my mother and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\nshe\u2019s alive, I just saw her in Lvov.\u201d So -- but they didn\u2019t know, you know, I was alone because\nthey ask me to leave station alone.",
        "Q: I mean, your -- your father never came to you and said this is who\u2019s going to take care of you",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- it was just th-the -- the nurse came and then another nun, and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- you just trusted.",
        "A: I had no choice. I knew that he -- that was arranged. I knew that. Without him, probably\nnobody would take care of me. But he didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t talk, y-you know, we didn\u2019t have any\nexplain -- they never explain anything to me, it was like that to the end, when I was grown up. It\n-- we had to -- my father and myself, he expect me to know. It was -- he -- we never talk about\npersonal things at all, it was absolutely obvious. There was no explanation whatsoever.",
        "Q: Y -- you talked about the last time you saw your mother, from what you learned later, what\nhappened to your mother? Did she stay in Turka for awhile, was she actually deported in the\naktion?",
        "A: No. When I -- when I left, I was totally [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I was not there. My parents tried to escape to Hungary. In Hungary apparently it was simpler\nto -- to stay alive, and probably they -- they knew somebody, I have no idea why to Hungary.\nAnd they left with widow of one of the doctors and her son. I was told that by her son. I don\u2019t\nknow how true it is, but I met him in Germany later, after the war, and -- and he -- actually, he\ndidn\u2019t know who I am. I remember him when I was a little girl, and he was like 20 on that time.\nSo when I introduce myself, suddenly he con -- I said, well, you know, I -- we used to escape\nwith your mother and your father to Hungary. And I know they were escaping. And he told me\nstory which shaked me. I have no idea if this true or not, but why should he lie? That they were\nescaping and they were caught by Hungarian patrol, border patrol. And they wanted to return\nthem to Gestapo, to Germans. That was like death sentence. That my mother kneeled in front of\nthese people and they told -- she told them, please don\u2019t do that, I have a daughter and she is\nwaiting for me. And they let them go, but they had to return. So they went back to Turka. I-It\nwas very close to Hungarian border. And he -- so he -- this man and his mother somehow were\nhidden and they survived the war. He\u2019s still alive, he\u2019s -- he lives in Germany. My father never\nmentioned that and I never talked to him about it. He didn\u2019t talk at all. Whatever --",
        "Q: So he didn\u2019t tell you what happened?",
        "A: No. When I ask him once, he said just, I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Is over. Is nothing to talk\nabout, 1s over. So 1-1t was unsuccessful. So later on my father managed to find -- hide this place\nfor his mother from aunt -- from my grandmother, and he -- papers for my mother that was sent\nfrom Lvov, and sh -- the only thing that she needed to reach the place. And on the way she was\nrecognized by someone, or suspected by someone, we have -- we have no idea. And she was\ntaken off the train in Druhobich and taken to the prison. And she insisted that is not true, that\nshe\u2019s not Jewish, and she 1s so and so and so and so. And my father got news from Jewish\ncommittee over there that he -- they can arrange for her release if he pays so much money. So\napparently my father sent the money. Somehow he managed to get bribe, but money was gone,\nbut he was told he\u2019s too late. So we really didn\u2019t know what happened, if they killed her over\nthere, or they send her to the camp, or -- but we know that she was -- she died. But all my aunts\ndie. They were taken to concentration camp from Lvov, they went to Lvov. Their husband were\nkilled before. And two daughters, my -- each of -- we -- it was only single child in every family\nin our family. So one, Zula, that I mentioned to you, she was hidden by my grandmother and my\naunt\u2019s maid. She was wonderful, and we -- we loved her, she was such a -- she like family\nmember in our house, in their house. And second one, which was older, she was 18, and she was\nblonde with blue eyes, Irena Trepper was se -- somehow arranged for the papers and she went\nstraight to Germans and she said she was to go to work in Germany because on that time Polish\npeople used -- were taken for work in Germany, taught organization. So she went -- they sent her\nto Hamburg and she worked for German family as a maid. And these people loved her. I don\u2019t\nreally know because she never talk about it, she lives in Israel, she\u2019s still there. And after war she\ndecided not to go back to Poland, and she went through Cyprus to Palestine. She knew language,\nshe used to go to Hebrew high school in Nowy Sacz, her father was a Zionist, but it was very\nimportant. She was not the religious [indecipherable] not the same, but they were determined to\ngo to Palestine one day. That\u2019s what she did.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: I want you to talk a bit about leaving Turka with Sister Jadwiga.",
        "A: With Sister Blanche.",
        "Q: Blanche. Tell us -- tell us that story. At this point you have gone home with the nurse from the\nTurka hospital. You\u2019ve been given your life story, your false identity, and if you could just sort\nof walk us through what happens.",
        "A: Well, she took me to Lvov, and they had hom. It means an orphanage near Lvov, on Korkova\nStreet in Lvov. I -- I -- they had two orphanages, one on Swidova, and one on Korkova, and\n[indecipherable] which I went to. But it was this orphanage and he -- many children, we had the -\n- our bedrooms were like 20 beds in one bedroom, one next to another, the old s -- open space,\nbig open space and beds. So I got to one of them, and he -- actually I didn\u2019t go to school at the --\nwhat we did -- I don\u2019t even remember. We work in, you know, in the kitchen and I didn\u2019t go to\nschool over there. It was some kind of fe -- they had some kind of activity. And I went -- I was\nthere a very short time, because the first what happened, that somebody, one of the girls came to\nme and said, well you are Marisha Borofska, we had Marisha Borofska here. It was the name of\nthe gir -- one of the girls, probably they pick out those papers which existed. So nuns got scared.\nSo Sister Blanche came again. She was a courier actually. She used to bring children from those\n-- children with -- Polish children without the parents, orphans from the charitable organization\nto the orphanages. And probably they were paid by those organizations some money because you\nhave to -- they didn\u2019t have money to -- to support those kids, but they really took care of those\nkids. So she came, and when she came back with the new papers, and she change my name to\nMarisha Vorshinska and she took me away from there to Wamina. And --",
        "Q: Hm, one question. When the little girl said oh, we know maris -- Mariasa -- the first identity --",
        "A: Marishka -- Mari --",
        "Q: Did you -- did you sort of immediately run and tell the nun?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t say anything.",
        "Q: So -- so how did it sort of come out that this little girl was --",
        "A: Apparently it came out.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Apparently it came out, because I didn\u2019t say anything, I didn\u2019t react it. I didn\u2019t know what to\nsay. I didn\u2019t react it. And he -- probably they felt insecure. Later on the Mother Superior of this\nconvent in -- she became Mother Superior of entire convent, you know, those nuns, Franciscan\nnuns, but in that time she was simply in charge, Mother in charge in the convent in Wamina. She\nknew -- actually, she was one that agree -- send -- send up [indecipherable] to take me. And he --\napparently she was -- it was just taking place for me, Lvov. But later, after war when I spoke to\nher, she said to me that in Lvov they were afraid to keep me because apparently they were in the\nmiddle of the town and they were simply afraid. So she decided to take me to Wamina. Wamina\nwas close place, it was little Ukrainian village. The only Polish place was this monastery, and\norphanage. And they have some fields and gardens and cows and the whole thing. They have a\nfarm. The nuns were running this farm, which support them a little. But he -- I was really the first\n-- maybe not me, because it was another girl, she was the daughter of the judge from Sembor or\nDruhobich, I don\u2019t know exactly. Her name was Ursula Piper. She was the Jewish girl, and she\nwas very, very Semitic. Very dark, olive skin and very, very dark hair. So -- and I was actually\nthe second Jewish girl that came to this place.",
        "Q: This is in Wamina?",
        "A: Wamina, yes. It was beginning on \u201942. It was somewhere in February \u00b042.",

        "Q: In -- in Lvov, what do you -- why do you think the little girl said that, and if she was making\nnoises, what was her --",
        "A: No, because it was another girl by this name, that it was -- that once used to be in Lvov, and\nlater on she would transfer somewhere else, so they remember that girl. No, she didn\u2019t try to --\nshe didn\u2019t have anything in mind except that it was another girl like that.",
        "Q: When you were in Wamina, when you were introduced with your -- tell us about your new\nidentity again. The second identity.",
        "A: Well my -- second identity was ma -- Maria Vorshinska, and they call me Maryla because it\nwas so many Marias that they have to change those Marias a little bit.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And when she brought me to Wamina, I felt very comfortable because they have the nun\nwhich was in charge in school and children, was the wonderful, wonderful person, Sophia --\nSister Sophia. She was full of talent, she was running the chorus, she play on organs, she dance,\nshe organize theater. We -- you know, she was very artistic, and also she was tremendously good\npedagogue. So everybody was in love with her. On the same time she -- everybody was afraid of\nher because she was very rigid. And she took me after -- under her wings. I don\u2019t know if she\nwas -- felt pity for me, you know, and she was really extremely good to me. The -- years later\nwhen I met someone from Wamina, the girl says to me, oh you were the favorite of doct -- Sister\nSophia, and I think I was. She really like me. It doesn\u2019t mean that sh -- I have any privilege, but I\nfelt that she is really my friend, and I needed it. So I felt very, very comfortable about that. And I\nloved her, you know, I could kill for her. She was just wonderful person.",
        "Q: You mentioned that one girl looked very Semitic, but did you think that she was Jewish, or\nperhaps even know that she was Jewish with you?",
        "A: Oh, I could -- I took one look at her and I knew who she is. You know? You don\u2019t -- you just\ntake one look at the person and you -- you know she 1s Jewish. It is a way I recognize others later\non and I\u2019m pretty sure they did, too.",
        "Q: Recognize you?",
        "A: Yeah. And we never talk about it. We never even get close one to another. It was something\nstrange, you know, the danger.",
        "Q: So you might feel fairly comfortable with the other girls, but if there was another Jewish girl\nin the group, you\u2019d keep your distance?",
        "A: I kept my distance. Yes, I kept my distance. So we -- we all did that.",
        "Q: And would the nuns ever tell you that little girl over there is in the same situation as you? No.",
        "A: No, no. No, there was no discussion whatsoever. Even nuns really, the only two that knew\nwho we were, except some could suspect, because that was sus -- was Sophia and Blanche and\nSister Budnofska which was the -- she made the decision whom she should take, she was\nauthority in this place.",

        "Q: Is it Sister Sophia then, who shared the butter with you?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. I was very thin, and she used to bring soup from her supper, and I\u2019m pretty sure\nthey didn\u2019t have too much, and call me at night and ask me to eat her soup, extra food. I don\u2019t\nknow, maybe she did it to others too, because everything was kind of secretive. But she used to\nfeed me, you know, just because I was extremely, extremely thin. I have the -- it was a period of\ntime that I have the lack of vitamins and food, so I develop boils all over my body including my\nface. Here, and nose, and -- of course I am not talking about lice and that stuff which live after\nthis -- under the skin. It was horrible, it was horrible. And whenever I cut myself it was\nimmediately boil, you know? So that was the -- probably lack of vitamins and I didn\u2019t have\nanything at all for -- for awhile ye -- also. So it was -- in some times -- it was winter on \u201942\nalready, end of \u201942, when one day she walked me out and she -- I don\u2019t know what was first,\nwhen she told me about my mother when she die? No, that was first. She walked me out at night\nand she let me -- asked me to dress [indecipherable] and took me to the second -- the con -- it\nwas church in the middle, school and girl\u2019s quarter was on one wing, and second wing was nun\nwings, and guest wings. So she took me to nun wings, and it was a tunnel underneath the church\nthat you could -- in the basement that you could walk through. And she opened the door in one of\nthe guest room and it was my father. Apparently he was sent by German with group of Jewish\ndoctors to the nearby villages to immunize against typhoid fever, because it was again out --\noutbreak of typhoid fever. And he managed to contact Sister Budnofska and she asked him to\ncome. And he -- so he saw my boils and he gave me something, I think. They were suspecting\nthat maybe I have syphilis or whatever, what the hell I [indecipherable] I had that stuff on my\nface. So she gave me some kind of medicine which I don\u2019t know it helped me, I don\u2019t remember.\nFinally it went away. But they fed me a little bit better so it went away. But I saw him on that\ntime, and he -- later on in that morning I saw him in church. He probably -- and he -- I don\u2019t\nknow how long he stayed. And wa -- what was the reason, but he was there.",
        "Q: Tell us about that meeting, when you -- the door was opened and your father was there.",
        "A: Yeah, and I didn\u2019t react. I didn\u2019t react at all. You know, you see those [indecipherable]\nkissing, no, I didn't react. Okay. Well, apparently he knew where I am, yes. And second\nexperience I had, I think it was beginning \u201933 -- \u201943, I dreamt that my mother died. It\u2019s funny\nbecause I probably cry. And, you know, we have this big bedroom, 20 beds, you know, and so\nsomebody, one of the children wake me up, and then s -- and I couldn't wake up. So when I wake\nup I saw Sister Sophia stand -- and it was night, and she took me away. And she told me that my\nmother die, was killed. So they knew everything about the family, they follow it, you know, they\nwere attached to.",
        "Q: Going back to when -- when you did see your father and you didn\u2019t react, how long were you\nand your father together? And you --",
        "A: Few hours.",
        "Q: Eventually -- do you remember anything about what was spoken or --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- what he said?",
        "A: No. The Sister was -- were in the room, and you know, we didn\u2019t have any secrets with S-\nSophia, and Superior, and later on I left and they still stayed, probably talk.",
        "Q: Did he say anything to you about what was going on, or --",
        "A: No. He asked me if I behave, he asked me to be a good girl. And Sister Superior complained\nthat I am too daring, that I -- you know, when I -- we have these German inspections and -- and\nprobably I was too visible, they should stay. And that was it.",
        "Q: And then you saw him the next day in church, did you have any contact at all?",
        "A: No, no, no, I pretend I don\u2019t know he was here. Cause we used to go to church every day for\nmorning prayers, you know.",
        "Q: So what was it like to have your father appear out of nowhere? Did it --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I cannot -- I\u2019m afraid to think back. I was numb. I didn\u2019t express any emotions\nor anything like that, I didn\u2019t cry. Now I am crying more than that. Now. Probably I was happy\nthat he is fine, but -- it gave me certain security that he exist, you know. I didn\u2019t ask what happen\nwith rest of family, nothing. I didn\u2019t know what to talk about.",
        "Q: And is that how you normally were at the orphanage? Were you very quiet and numb?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. One of the girls later on 1s -- much later told me that I was very reserved. You\nknow, I didn\u2019t want to lie, so I didn\u2019t want to get close, really. I didn\u2019t want to talk about\nanything which personal. So we talk about, you know, everyday stuff, but I was not -- I couldn\u2019t\n-- I didn\u2019t want to tell them, you know, about family and stuff like that, so I was -- I never\nwanted to get close to anyone. I was kind of waiting. It was time when we had in -- we didn't go\nto s-school, school is in orphanage. They have certain classes, but priority was work. So\nwhenever was a field work, we had to do that, the washing, you know, the laundry. It was done\nby girls, and there was plenty of, you know. And they were small, they used to have very small\nchildren, they wet beds, you know, so you have to wash every time all those huge sheets and --\nand laundry was a good place to work because you got extra bread, and don\u2019t forget we were\nhungry, all of us, was no food. So -- and also I was older than my real age, my papers were that I\nam older, so I belong to older children. And also, older children used to hide when German came\nbecause they tried to take Polish children to work in Germany. So we used to hide, and we had\nthis hiding place, they have a big [indecipherable] stage and under the stage it was the -- and we\nused to crowd there, and whenever was German inspection, we lay one and next to another in\nthis little corner, which was invisible even if you light, and later on Sister Sophia used to go up\nand just knock, and everybody crawl out. And there were older children, Polish girls, and there\nwere some -- not children, but youngsters, 18 years old that work at the orphanage, and they\nwere hiding as well because nobody wanted to go to work in Germany. In -- so I was -- they ask\nus to -- every morning Sister Sophia used to either read names of girls which go to kitchen to\npeel potatoes, or they -- another group goes to the laundry, and another group goes to the garden,\nand another group cleans, you know, rooms, we have to -- they were parquet floors, that you\nhave -- they a need -- needed to be absolutely, you know, shining, so that was a lot of work to --\nto [indecipherable] you know, to -- to polish those floors. So there were groups working, depends\nhow old you are, and -- and sh-she used to rotate those groups so not everybody -- so quite often\nI used to go to laundry, and was a great place because you have this extra bread with cheese,\nwith bowl of cheese on top for -- for second breakfast. And of course I had to have a chair\nbecause I couldn\u2019t reach, you know, and you didn\u2019t have the washing machine, but you have to\nuse those, you know, how you call that stuff?",
        "Q: The washboard?",
        "A: Washboards, yes. And I couldn't twist that. I was practically left handed, except that I was\nforced to work with my right hand, so I was twisting with left hand and the Sister in laundry used\nto say, \u201cMaryla, don\u2019t twist like a Jew.\u201d Because it\u2019s different, left hand. It was the -- and I used\nto fake, because I couldn\u2019t get rid of those stains. So you wa -- that was a white laundry, you\nhave to wash it, and then you -- she -- look at that, is absolutely [indecipherable] now you have\nto do it again. And then you -- they used to boil it, it was big boiler, and you used to -- and it\nboils, and after it was boiling, you wash it again, it was white. So I was waiting for her to turn so\nI could throw it into the boiler. And somehow I was pretty successful doing that. Probably\nsomebody else di-did the same. Someone very strong and they washed well, and they were very\nproud of it. But -- and then we used to peel potatoes and work in the garden, and they didn\u2019t like\nit very much. And the fo -- on the fall we used to pick up potatoes, you have to -- in the field,\nthat was very hard work, extremely hard. It was a machine that you have to go and pick up\neverything. Today probably people are leaving that stuff. And so we -- we work very hard, you\nknow, in addition to goin -- going to school.",
        "Q: A question about the ner -- the -- the nun who said don\u2019t twist like a Jew. Did she know that\nyou were Jewish?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. She wouldn\u2019t say that.",
        "Q: And so h-how did you understand her comment?",
        "A: I was afraid. I was afraid. But I -- even today I am doing it with left hand, I cannot do\notherwise. And I didn\u2019t mention anything to the nuns. I felt that it\u2019s much better when I am going\nto be quiet.",
        "Q: Do you think she was sending you a message?",
        "A: I think so. You know, they were different people. The only thing they were -- kept extremely\nunder control by Mother Superior, so they wouldn\u2019t do anything to -- you know, to misbehave,\nand they could be punished or sent away, you know, the -- it was tremendous power of Superior\nover the nuns.",
        "Q: In the time that you were there, or in any of the different orphanages, w-was someone in\nhiding ever discovered?",
        "A: No. No. And they were daring. On the end it was many, many Jewish children in this. She\nused to admit quite a lot. And not only older one, but also boys in orphanage, th-the small, little\none, we used to call them [indecipherable] the little one, which were like two years old, three\nyears old, there were some boys. And I -- when things were worse, I saw much more children.\nAnd we could recognize them, they were absolutely [indecipherable] different. And also the\nchildren my age, and older people -- younger, they came, it was several names that I can\nmention, were saved by those nuns. Later on --",
        "Q: Do you want to mention those names?",
        "A: Yes. The [indecipherable] it was a girl from -- probably older than I was, very smart, and\ndefinitely hiding. And it was Teresa Branoff, she came and she was shaved, you know, that --\nand sh -- probably -- she used to dance pretty, probably she used to go to ballet school when she\nwas a little girl. And it was the girl with a brother, a brother was a little one, and he sh -- her\nname was Kovalska, Teresa Kovalska. Let\u2019s see, Teresa Rogashinska, and few more girls. And I\ndidn't know except wa -- oh, Janka Davidovich that I have still contact with her. Her name was\non that time Markofska.",
        "Q: The girl whose head was shaved, now what did people make of that?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t that just identify her as Jewish?",
        "A: I knew. I don\u2019t know if the other people knew. She looked very well. She didn\u2019t look Jewish\nat all. But I knew. She\u2019s -- she lives in Poland, she stayed in Poland.",
        "Q: Di-Did Sister Sophia or any of the nuns ever say anything to you about why they were doing\nwhat they were doing?",
        "A: No. After war, Sister soph -- Tekla wrote -- well, I wa -- used to correspond with her, and this\nletter 1s amusing that she wrote me because I sent her a letter and I said, I don\u2019t know how I\nshould thank you for what you did. And she send me a letter that she didn\u2019t do anything. That\nwas her mission to do what she\u2019s supposed to do, and she was guided by God. And from her I thi\n-- | learned that was like fa -- 500 children saved by this -- not by her, but entire -- this nun\norganization. So -- and I also kn-knew some other people, it was the professor gynecology in\n[indecipherable], Professor Justaporsky who was save by them, and many, many people, I am\npretty sure that they help my father as well, as much they could.",
        "Q: You -- you called it a nun organization --",
        "A: Those --",
        "Q: -- was it a fra -- did it have a name? That -- it was a Franciscan --",
        "A: Yes, they were Franciscan -- I think Polish [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know how to translate\nthat. Franciscan order of -- Sister of Maria.",
        "Q: Go ahead and say it in Polish also.",
        "A: [speaks Polish here] -- I have mental block. I have mental block, yeah.",
        "Q: If you think of it, just say it [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, I will.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I know it by heart.",
        "Q: Is the question about --",
        "A: [speaks Polish here] now that\u2019s what is, yeah. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You described yourself as very reserved, afraid sometimes --",
        "A: Well, I was conf -- constantly with the -- I was afraid. I had this -- I was numb. I couldn\u2019t\nexpress anything, I was afraid.",
        "Q: W-Was there anything that you did for yourself, or in your mind, maybe late at night, in a\nway to kind of reassure yourself or reaffirm your own identity, who you were, Lidia, in --\nanything that you did, in your mind I suppose it would have have to have been.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. It was something probably that I behave like -- like -- like a moron\nsometime, because I was so uptight. Then, quite often, Sister Sophia, who was such a good\nfriend of mine, she called me, Maria, you ha -- how you call the child of cow --",
        "Q: A calf?",
        "A: Calf.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You dumb calf, she used to call me. You know, this used to be the calf. In Polish it sounds\nhorrible, you know. Maria [indecipherable] you si -- Maryla [indecipherable], you stupid calf.\nBecause probably she wanted me to react somehow, and I wa -- had always delay reaction. And I\nknow she was wonderful friend of mine, but even so, you know, she was -- she wanted to\nstimulate me somehow, and I couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Did you sleep well?",
        "A: Yeah. Oh yes. I was tired. Oh, I was overworked and tired, I could sleep anywhere.",
        "Q: And wh -- how much did you think about your father or the rest of your family, your mother,\nuntil you knew?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t really. I was hoping that I am going, when everything\u2019s over, I\u2019m going to end up\nstaying forever in -- over there, because all the children, you know, the -- they have, the Polish\norphans, they didn\u2019t have parents, or they have dysfunctional family, or they were children they\nnever had any parents. They\u2019re all orphans. And they were actually, as far as parents condition,\nthey were in the same situation. And the way they raised those children, we didn\u2019t have -- they\ndidn\u2019t have any vacation. So they supposed to be na -- nannies, or maids, cooks, or whatever,\nyou know, the lowest of the lower. And actually, they -- most of them got education because of\nthe Communistic parliament. You know, they -- they were taken away from them when\nCommunists came in. And it was always freedom to get the communa -- education, that\u2019s\nactually what Communists did, to one that didn\u2019t have anything. So I didn\u2019t want to be a maid,\nand I didn\u2019t want to be -- so next step, if you learn a little bit, you could be a teacher. So when\nthey ask what do you want to do, I always write I want to be a teacher. I don\u2019t know if I want --\nprobably not, but then I was thinking, what happened? Where I am going to go? I was sure that it\nis no Jew left in the world except this little, you know, clique that we are hidden. And I was not\nsure of my parents. I knew my mother was -- die, and I didn\u2019t know anything about my grand --\nthe rest of the family. And I was sure that it was no Jew left in Poland, everybody was killed.\nAnd in Wamina, it was very close to Turka, and it was in the village, and there were big forests\nover there, and we heard those shots. They used to bring Jews and kill them, you know, they dig\ntheir own grave, and from the roof of the -- you could see, you know, this -- what is going on.\nNot close, was pretty far. And it was every day going on, and I was sure it\u2019s -- no one is left. So\nwhat I am going to do? I\u2019m not going to be a Jew, I don\u2019t want to be a maid, I don\u2019t want to stay\nthere. I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s -- what might happened. When even -- when we went to Warsaw\nalready, during the Warsaw op -- uprising, Sister Sophia used to guard me against the -- they was\n-- they were underground Polish organization, and they organize hospital exactly, and\n[indecipherable] Jews to help him. And I was not allowed to show my face, but they were afraid\nthat they might kill me. They were not Germans. But she asked me to stay in the basement. She\narranged -- they arranged the little chapel in the basement and we used to pray 24 hours, you\nknow, novena for the safe [indecipherable] from Warsaw because we were under shells, and 1-it\nwas horrible, horrible time, and the bombs, you know, Germany used to bombs, and American\nused to bombs, and everybody, you know, and we were there, you know, in the middle of this\nshooting. So 1 -- 24 hours somebody should pray, and I was one that it was 24 hours in the\nchapel.",
        "Q: Now, I want to talk more about that, but just tell us how you went from Wamina to Warsaw,\nand apparently the -- the Germans were involved.",
        "A: Yes, so one night, it was end of, I think \u201943, the Ukrainian band, you know, the troops,\nwhoever it was, in [indecipherable] was name of the group, they invaded monastery, and they\nwanted to -- they were after Polish people working for Germans to register cows and pigs. And\nso they were after these people, and of course they found them, they kill some of them.",
        "Q: But just -- before you go on, th-th -- these people had been given the job of --",
        "A: Going from the -- from the farm to farm, and tried, you know, register cows and pigs, and\nthey used to put marks on them. So the peasant couldn't pi -- kill those pigs, they had to give\nthem as a conthing -- condint -- give them to Germans, It was for German army. They wanted to\nhave ready -- registration, and whoever killed the pig was severely punished. So they hated these\npeople because they wanted -- they raised those pigs. And he -- so they deci -- they came, and\nthey really didn\u2019t want to have Polish group, a Polish settlement over there. So they killed some\nof the civilian workers, and I think some nuns, and they set fire in the building, and the German\nsaw the fire --",
        "Q: In your building, in your --",
        "A: Some of the buildings, you know.",
        "Q: Nearby where you lived?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The buildings that belongs to. And they came from room to room, I remember, I -- I -- I hide\nunder the bed, be -- some -- some kids run away, you know, and the German ca -- saw the fire --\nactually it was Gestapo, I think, and they came, and it -- this band run away, but she -- Sister\nSuperior was told, you better get out of here, because we will get you, so they decided to leave\nthe place. They knew that they are going to -- if not they are going to be killed. They left only\none sister to guard, you know, the place, and German supply the cars, you know, the big trucks,\nand we simply took everything. Everybody was worrying about his possession, so we took as\nmuch as we could. And we moved to Lvov, and later from Lvov we moved to near Warsaw.",
        "Q: W-Were you carrying anything?",
        "A: Yeah, everybody got his belongings, and so I got my little suitcase, and I have couple of -- I\nused to write diary. So I have my diary, and I have my w-we -- I didn\u2019t own anything, really,\nexcept this little suitcase which had my name on, so she gave it to me and everybody -- because\neverybody had to guard his own stuff. And that how we got -- went to Warsaw.",
        "Q: I-Is this the same suitcase --",
        "A: Yes, yes, with picture.",
        "Q: -- that your mother gave you?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And he -- so we went to Warsaw by -- to Lvov by car and later train, and he -- German in --\nand we were disperse in different homes. I was 1-in [indecipherable], they have homes in\n[indecipherable].",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I remember before I went there Sister Sophia called me and said to me, listen, is a priest\nover there and you have to go and take Communion and he -- you know. So when he\u2019s going to\nask you if you are baptized, or you are Jewish, you should tell him -- y-you are Jewish, you\nshould tell him no, and is not a lie. Because then -- 1-inside you should say no for you. And that\nfor you, you should s-stay quiet. So it was like look [indecipherable]. So she simply told me, you\njust have to lie. And is not going to be a big sin, God will understand.",
        "Q: Did the lying ever bother you?",
        "A: No. Oh, I was a perfect liar. I could lie, too. I could lie and I could steal. Didn\u2019t bother me at\nall.",
        "Q: When did you steal, you haven\u2019t told us about that?",
        "A: It was in Warsaw, we were very hungry, so we used to go to market, and we used to distract\nthe -- you know, the -- the -- the stable keeper and we used to steal tomato, onion, stuff like that.\nLike crazy. I didn\u2019t need anything else. The only thing that I steal was food. We were hungry.",
        "Q: After the priest, what -- what happened when you did meet the priest?",
        "A: He didn\u2019t ask me. He never asked me, he never bother. He didn\u2019t -- probably he didn\u2019t\nsuspect, you know, whatever. I didn\u2019t have this problem, but she told me to lie. She said is not a\nlie because now I\u2019m -- not for you, not for you.",
        "Q: Be-Before we move on a little bit more to Warsaw, there -- there was a Father, and I\u2019m not\nsure if it was in Wamina or Lvov, Franz? Father Franz?",
        "A: Caesar?",
        "Q: C -- yes.",
        "A: Oh no, that was much later.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay.",
        "A: He didn't know anything about us.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: We met him when we -- after Warsaw uprising.",
        "Q: Okay, well then let\u2019s -- let\u2019s just touch on --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- that one when we get there. So when you arrive in Warsaw, where -- where are all the\norphans and the nuns located?",
        "A: Well they -- we were dispersed to different houses, and I was on the outskirt, in the orphanage\noutside of Warsaw. And -- but later on e -- Sister Budnofska made his point that he wanted all\nher children with her. So she -- and the first the Jewish children, she wanted them -- you know,\nto guard them. And she took me 1-in -- they got the place in section of the ghetto. A house which\nwas -- used to be a ghetto hou -- belonged to ghetto. So we had to -- she got everybody back, we\nhad to clean this building. We got few floors on this house because -- and we have to clean the\nbuilding completely, and that was a hard thing to do because it was so many papers and\nphotographs on the floor. When they took these people away, you know, those papers were --\nand later on somebody plundered the house. They didn\u2019t have use for photographs and papers\nand documents. And I remember cleaning that, and we used to read those documents, and it was\nvery hard for me, at least. In -- and he -- so we settled there til Warsaw uprising. And more childr\n-- Jewish children came on that time. On that time she -- we had the yon -- Janka Markofska,\nJanka Davidovich, and s -- a few more children, and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: But what was it like being in the ghetto, was -- was it basically empty, that area of the city?",
        "A: It was empty already, totally empty. Some building were occupied by Poles which moved in,\nbecause Warsaw was very crowded, and it was -- there were building available, so they moved\nin. But basically it was empty. And they moved the wall of the ghetto, so exactly in, behind this\nbuilding it was the wall, which street was divided by the wall, and it was backyard of the\nbuilding, became backyard. So it was a wall of the ghetto. I don\u2019t know if ghetto was still, but it\nwas -- there was still some activities over there, sho -- the shooting, and German were looking\nfor people that were hiding, you know, and things like that.",
        "Q: So it -- it was right next to the ghetto, it was a --",
        "A: Next to the -- it -- 1t used to be once ghetto, and they move, you know, but when ghetto\nbecame smaller, they used to move --",
        "Q: The walls.",
        "A: -- the walls, yes.",
        "Q: And what did you -- how long did you stay there, and what -- what was a normal day like\nthere? I mean, what -- what was going on there?",
        "A: Well, it was the same. It -- we learn a bit more, it was a school because we didn\u2019t have a\nguard then and -- and we have to wash the clotheses and we had to clean and we had to peel\npotatoes. And also -- what we did also, the n -- it -- nuns found they -- they were -- were shorted\nof money, so we used to make the buttons. You know, the buttons that you make out of thread?\nThey were some steel rings, and you just thread those buttons, so we used to make those buttons\nand they s-sewed the buttons. Used to paint the pictures and they sold the pictures. The older\nchildren used to go and clean in Polish\u2019 people houses, so we used to have jobs like that. I was\nnever sent to clean other people house.",
        "Q: Was Sister Sophia still waking you up sometimes and giving you food at this point?",

        "Q: I wonder if you could just talk a bit about Jewish identity and that situation when you were in\nhiding.",
        "A: Well, I didn't consider myself Jew, and I would not admit to anyone that I was a Jew. I\nremember when I was -- I went to Lvov first time, and the nuns talked to me in her house. She\ntold me, even if they will kill you, you cannot -- if they catch you, you cannot admit you are a\nJew, because that is a death sentence for us and for yourself. If they want to -- they want to kill\nyou, they should kill you as a non-Jew, and you cannot admit that to anyone. And remember that\nif you admit that, it will be death sentence for whoever is helping you, and for you. So I -- 1t was\njust -- I don\u2019t know if I remember even that, but I became non-Jew. And I wouldn\u2019t admit to\nanyone, ever, who I am. And after -- worrying haunted me for a long time. This not being -- no\nproblems. I have no Jewish problem, I am not a Jew. I remember that I didn\u2019t have this identity. I\nknew I am a Jew, but I didn\u2019t have this implanted identity or religious background, or -- or\nnational background when I was a little child. I came from very assimilated house. So that was\nthe -- I didn\u2019t have problem who I am, I was Polish. I was not Catholic, but I was Polish. And\nthat\u2019s how I felt.",
        "Q: Did it make you anxious that s-some people did know you were Jewish, for instance, the\nnuns?",
        "A: No. I just didn\u2019t want to have -- I didn\u2019t want to -- I didn\u2019t want to think about it. I -- I identify\nmyself as a non-Jew. And that was it. I lie to myself.",
        "Q: And then it took time to stop lying?",
        "A: Oh yes. It took quite a long time. It was a fear involved when I stopped lying. I felt uptight.\nLike you change your skin color, you know?",
        "Q: Tell us what happened during the Warsaw uprising.",
        "A: Well, we were mostly hiding in the basement, praying 24 hours novena, you know, we change\nand pray to -- I don\u2019t remember what saint it was. I think that\u2019s Thaddeusz, Thad, so whatever.\nHe is supposed to be saint of whatever is save you. And he -- we were mostly waiting things to\nstop. There was nothing to do. You couldn\u2019t go upstairs because we were bombed constantly. So,\nthere were no -- it was no glass in the windows any more. The bomb came so close that some of\nthe walls fell off. So the only safe place was this basement. So we were mostly downstair in\nbasement with nothing to eat. It was horrible. I remember somebody found the sack of the beans,\ndry beans. We used to keep those beans in the mouth that it soak completely, and it was so\ndelicious, raw. Com -- and he -- it was really end -- that wi -- was this hospital and I was not\nallowed to show my face. So some of the girls used to go there to help, I was not allowed to\nshow my face, so I didn\u2019t, and I was afraid. Finally, the German capture the section that we were\nin, it\u2019s Volnush, Ritza Volunush, it was corner of Volnushti and Jelazinna, where this house was\nlocated. And the German came in, they chase everybody from the house, from the bi -- from the\nbuilding. And he -- the way of walking through the street, they used to make holes from building\nto building and walk on the first floors through the apartments to the end of the block, because\nthe very tight building in European. But they chase everybody. Whoever wanted to escape,\nescapes through the holes and to the canal, and from the -- through the canal, but nun didn\u2019t --\nthey didn\u2019t feel they need to escape, it was nowhere to escape. So the home army people\nescaped, but they -- we stayed. And they took us to the street. They immediately pour gasoline in\nthe building and set building on fire. So here we are on the street, and all the buildings are on\nfire. It was -- and they f -- when they got everybody from the buildings, old people, and then\npeople with children, and -- we walk -- they walk us through those burning streets, it was -- I still\nhave that in front of my eyes, just burning streets, and terrible smoke. They walk us to the\nrailroad station which was -- I don\u2019t remember, it wasn\u2019t a main railroad station because in the\ncity that was gone. Some side railroad station. And then we st -- and when we walk -- and\nGermans on both sides, you know, and he -- with the dogs and he -- and the machine guns, and\nhe -- on some of the building which were still burning, we could see the people with the -- funny,\nyou know the -- when you have the handkerchief and you tie four corners and you make a cup,\nthey have those cups with handkerchief with tied four corners. And they were taking bodies from\nthe burning buildings. So they have those flat cars full of bodies, black, black, burned bodies.\nAnd he -- so that was on the way when you walk. And we finally went to railroad station, and\nwas group of Gypsies the German found somewhere. They were guarded, and they gave us soup.\nIt -- it was made from this horse. And doesn\u2019t matter how hungry I was, I couldn\u2019t eat this meat,\nit was sweet, and I just couldn\u2019t eat that meat. And they pack us on train, which was like -- it was\nnot regular train, it was these freight wagons, parked one next to another, we climbed there, they\ntook us to the railroad station, they set camp in [indecipherable]. And he -- they -- some of the --\nthey kept us for awhile, and finally the -- the Sister Superior, the -- Tekla, which spoke perfect\nGerman -- she spoke non-accented German because she was raised by her family in Berlin. Her\nfather, or whoever it was, she told me, worked for Polish embassy in Berlin and she was raised in\nBerlin and she went to school in Germany, so her German was totally untouched by accent. She\nmanaged to work our release. And we walk later on by foot to -- no, we walked, I think, 10\nkilometers or more to the nearby forest. It was -- nuns used to have their retreat and school, and\nwe stayed there to the end of the war. And she -- they said, you know, in -- one of the classroom\nthey gave us, and we slept on the floor, all next to another.",
        "Q: So was it -- how did Mother Superior Tekla, how was she able to get you released from the\nGermans?",
        "A: Well, apparently she had power on persu -- of persuasion, and they were extremely polite to\nher when she opened her mouth in -- you know, the -- she was a nun, and she was not very pretty\nnun, very stern, you know, type of person. And she was -- she had this power of persuasion. So\nshe decided she has children, orphans, Polish orphans and who happen to be in Warsaw, and we\nwant to go to our retreat, and you have to let us go. Because what they are going to do with\nchildren, you are going to send them to work camp. And she managed to arrange that, and -- and\nthat was when we met this Father Caesar, he also escape from Warsaw and he supposed to go to\nthe man monastery, which was somewhere else, but she changed his direction and he went with\nus to Kostovitz. And we stay in Kostovitz from -- it was in \u201944 yes, til end of the war, which was\nactually when German army passed by, because -- German -- Russian army -- because you\nknow, during the uprising, the army was on opposite side of Vistula, and they didn\u2019t want to take\nany action because it was different group fighting, that was London group fighting in Warsaw.",
        "Q: Which army was on the other side of the Vistula?",
        "A: Russian army, with the Polish army, which was fighting with Russian army. And they simply\nwaited for Warsaw to bleed to death. And after uprising actually, they move -- you know, they\nhave invasion, they moved with new invasion and they pushed the Germans away. So it took til\nJanuary, \u201945.",

So you put the straw on the floor, and some kind of cover over it. And during the\nday we used to move this straw against the wall and our tables, you know, school tables back in\norder so we could have the class. And at night we used to move everything back and have a\nstraw. And was funny, I remember we moved the straw, it was plenty of fleas jumping up. So, in\naddition to our lice, we used to have fleas as well. We felt like dogs.",

But he was a decent person, very s -- helpful, and he\nbecame also teacher, he used to teach us Latin and til today I don\u2019t know anything. And he -- so\nhe organized the school, really, with another priest which was our chaplain. And he was actually\n-- he was not -- he was priest, but he was the francis -- from Franciscan convents. He was a\nmonk, that what he was. And after war, when he really learn who I was, and he came west to\nvisit me [indecipherable] was my father, he tried to keep contact, which for me was very\nuncomforta -- I don\u2019t know why, I just didn\u2019t want that any more.

And he -- later on after war he tried to make [indecipherable] and he\nused to -- he -- he was very resourceful. He helped to rebuild the monastery -- Franciscan\nmonastery in Warsaw. And he used to also collect money, you know, donations, and stuff like\nthat, so he was very visible man. And he then visit me in Israel once, it was funny because on\nthat time, it was before six year war, so Jordan and Jerusalem was divided.

So I wrote to Yad\nVashem, and I wrote them what I heard from my father, that this man Rostoski, saved my father,\nand his family saved him. And I didn\u2019t realize that name of this man, not his father-in-law, came,\nhe got the awa -- paper from Yad Vashem.

You know, it was kind of -- and I was so angry that I didn\u2019t responded at\nall. I did show it to someone and I decided, let\u2019s get rid of that.

It was\nnever fully furnished, because war started. And he -- so people were [indecipherable] he --\nkissing his, you know, bending and -- and grabbing his feet, or kissing his hand. Now, that kind\nof relation between poor and -- and whoever gave them help, it always amazed me\n[indecipherable] because all my friends were the village children. I used to run with them, I used\nto eat in their houses. And I didn\u2019t realize that actually they did it because they needed my father.\nSo my -- I rather assoc -- associate myself with all those kids. We had fun climbing the trees, you\nknow, and --",

He had friends, he -- we were extremely assimilated. I knew I am Jewish, but wa -- I\nnever went to synagogue. My parents never observe any holidays, except my mother, probably\nfrom [indecipherable] she never ate on the Yom Kippur, that\u2019s -- she only drank tea, I tho -- tea\nwith milk, that was her way of celebrating.

        "A: No, it was my father who was the -- actually, because in this town was -- is small Jewish\npopulation, which 1s actually large -- large Jewish population for the size of town. And they were\nmostly very religious. They used to walk in those, you know, dress, headdresses, and -- but we\nhad nothing -- at least I don\u2019t remember, I never had anything in common with these people. It\nwas the only place that my father -- mother used to go, they had some kind of restaurant, and\nevery fr -- every Thursday, I think, they used to have the market. So from y -- on -- in the center\nof the town. So used to -- so people from nearby [indecipherable] or the merchant used to come\nand bring, you know, those goods.

Her name was Mrs. Horowicz, and she always bring the chair and my\nmother had to sit down, and she chat, and then she bought whatever she needed, and she used to\ngo home. And the local little restaurant actually that was kind of in, when the peasants, whoever\nthey sold the goods on the market used to drink, they live out of vodka, you know, and -- and this\nwoman was very observant. And I call her [speaks Polish here] gran-grandmother Haiya. And\nthey used to go there, is always fascinated me. And on high holiday, where you didn\u2019t bring the\nbre -- eat the bread, I used to bring with my sandwich, and she didn\u2019t know how to get me out\nbecause I -- I was spoiling her holiday.

        "A: Totally separate.",
        "A: It was like, you know, having some Muslim community here, and you don\u2019t belong there.\nThat what I felt. It means -- I never thought about it. I f -- consider myself Polish. My father was\na great Polish patriot, he was in Polish army when he was a young 18 years old boy, he escaped\nto Pulsudski legion, and he fought for independent and probably that why he had all those\nfriends.

        "A: The only time that I remember really anti-Semite is just before war, that I faced that.

So I was afraid and I went to\nthis Polish store and I bought whatever it was. I was eight years old in that time. And when I\nbring it home, I told my mother what happened, I couldn\u2019t go to buy -- bought at this place, she\nasked me to return it. And maybe because my father has -- was -- had the standing, he -- and he\nasked me to go to Mrs. Horowicz, so I went, nobody touched me. But the first time I saw, you\nknow, this -- I felt what happened, really. But he -- we were kind of protected in this town, and if\nyou -- I really didn\u2019t feel anything because I was not privileged to -- nobody really told me\nanything. I felt extremely secure, and extremely important because my father. That\u2019s --",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: It was no discussion in our house about faith and God. That was for -- I don\u2019t know. It was\nnothing against and nothing for. The first -- actually the first time I was taught about faith, when\nI was with nuns. And maybe because of my training, I was not really very convinced. I was\nbaptized, and se -- I was taught all those religious, you know, everything about Catholic religion,\nand I know -- I know til today, and I went to Communion, and -- but I -- it was kind of, you\nknow, very superficial. I was never very convinced, I was -- what my pa -- fa -- my parents used\nto, what I heard at home, that is not really important because you need to be moral\n[indecipherable] it is something that you have to face. And faith was something that everybody\nwas privileged to do whatever. They didn\u2019t -- they were not [indecipherable] fighting\n[indecipherable] but it was total freedom of your thinking.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yes, I was taught values. People don\u2019t do that [indecipherable] used to say. And I\nhad to -- I knew exactly what is right, what is wrong. It was very strongly defined in our family,\nthat you don\u2019t do certain things, you have to -- you know better. So I was taught -- I saw it in my\nfamily that there were certain thing that we don\u2019t do. You don\u2019t lie, you don\u2019t steal, you don\u2019t --\nyou have to be helpful, you need to be -- you n-need to give, you cannot be selfish. That what we\nwere taught. You have, for instance, you know, what every child in probably Europe on that time\nwas taught, that if you see the older person, you have to stand up and give the place to the older\nperson. You cannot [indecipherable] yourself. Is -- is no-no. You don\u2019t behave like that. You\ncannot steal, you cannot -- you know, you have to be consider.",
        "A: I saw it because my father was helping. I used to go, when I was a little child, he had those\npatient in the mountains, he couldn\u2019t get -- reach them by car, so they used to bring 1s -- on the\nwintertime they used to send sleds, you know, and he used to take me with him to those houses.\nAnd people are so poor, you know. When I think about it today -- they live in the huts, and they\ndidn\u2019t have glass in the windows, only skin from the animal skin, which was transparent. And\nthey didn't have a floor, the floor was just, you know, earth, and some wooden chips. And they\nsleep in one room with the animals, because is -- was warm, and these people were -- were so\npoor. He used to leave money to -- for -- to these people for the 1 -- because they couldn\u2019t buy\nmedicine. That why they kissed his hands, you know, and he -- they were extremely, extremely\npoor people. In this region, I think it were -- they were the poorest people in the po -- in Poland.\nAnd they very nice people, except they drunk a lot. I remember also that e -- when they have\nweddings. After wedding, my father used to have a lot of patients ti -- with knife si -- which were\nstabbed, al -- wo-wounds, you know. The -- the one family rebel another -- \u2018nother family, and\nso he used to have all those bloodiest people, they killed themself, they -- they stabbed themself.\nThey were mostly uneducated, they couldn\u2019t read and write. They didn\u2019t have electricity.",
        "A: No. It was done. No, I had to do what was right, and 1t was done. My parents didn\u2019t talk very\nmuch to me, you know, it was kind of -- they expect from me. They -- and now is not like today,\nyou talk to children, you explain to children, no. You just -- she told me it\u2019s not right, you have\nto buy from Mr. hor -- nobody can force you. And you have to go and return it, and you go and\nbuy from Mr. Horowicz, you cannot be afraid. And I was afraid. It was the first time, actually,\nwhen I -- and later on when we already left the -- during the war, went to Pinsk, and Russians\ncame to Pinsk, that was a first -- you know, this region of Poland was occupied by Russian.",
        "A: And then I went to school, and suddenly I was between the normal kids, and then I learn who\nI am, you know, because they call me mountain Jew, I remember. I spoke with a different accent,\nI wa -- I had this accent of the village. And he -- in Pinsk, people, they spoke with Russian\naccent, with this different accent.

They felt that -- somebody told them -- they\ndidn\u2019t have any children, and they decided, well, we are going to Romania. And they survive in\nRomania. So they escaped through the border to Romania.",
        "A: No. No, my father was -- my family was so patriotic Polish that all the -- the culture was\nPolish culture, you know, that was totally unthinkable that we can leave Poland. It was our\ncountry. My father fought in the war, and he fought for independent, and it was his language and\nhis -- was his culture. And he had Polish friends and all others were just skunks, you know? But\nhe consider Polish people extremely noble, and he -- he had friends from any, you know, layer of\nsociety, and he felt very, very liked, and so I don\u2019t think that with -- my mother maybe more than\nmy father, but he definitely w-wouldn\u2019t leave Poland.",

The Holocaust was something that nobody consider.\nIt -- that was very good example -- my grandfath-father, who was actually Austrian, he consider\nhimself Austrian culture, you know. In Turka he was surrounded on the street. The German -- it\nwas raining and German truck, big army truck was stuck in the mud. And so they rounded the\nJews, mostly older Jews to lift this truck from the mud, and it was probably more game than they\nneeded to lift this truck. And my f -- grandfather was around that, and he was always very well\ndressed, and -- and he had the medal from the first World War. And that he was privilege of even\nbefore, you know? So he went to this German, he showed him this cross that he had, and he said,\nwell I am Austrian, and I fought for Franz Joseph, or whoever it was, naively. And then this man\n-- he was beaten so badly that somebody brought him home, my father took him to hospital, and\nhe actually didn\u2019t recover after that. He die later on, he had internal bleeding, I don\u2019t know if his\n[indecipherable] but -- and I remember him laying in bed, because we had only two rooms and\nkitchen, and he was -- it was funny, because he was -- how you call it?

He -- so he -- finally -- we had a problem with food, food was so scarce, people used to be --\nget hung -- be hungry and more and more and more, even Polish people. So the only way to have\nfood was to buy them from farmers. And we didn\u2019t have too much money, or at least as much as\nmy father earned.

        "A: They -- actually they immediately started to terrorize Jews. The Gestapo became very active.\nAnd I know that on that time there were some Jews from the Austria, temporary living, that they\nleft in \u00b039, living in Turka.

And it was this -- I cannot tell you -- give you facts because I really don\u2019t remember\n-- | don\u2019t know, I didn't know. But it was this fear. They immediately rounded and took some\nmen and send them to work, you know, to road work and mostly Jews, of course. I stopped going\nto school, school was not available. And he -- on that time we moved to the house, I told you\nthat, my parent -- parents ran and in the house, it was small house, belong to the old Jew who\nlive in one room. And one little apartment block was rented by family. I don\u2019t reme -- I even\nremember name, his name was Buchman. And that was elderly couple with a son. The son used\nto be the teacher in high school. And he was hiding, he didn\u2019t go out at all. He st -- was staying\nat home.

And\nof course, house didn\u2019t have the bathrooms, you -- you went out -- outs -- the outside bathroom,\nwhich every family has a key from his own place. So we built in one -- one part of the basement\nwas so well hidden that we really couldn\u2019t figure out what happened and so they built their own\nhiding place with the camouflage doors. They put shelves you know, and you could just move\nthose shelves and open it [indecipherable] this room. And they had water in the place, and food\nstored, some dry food. And it was kind of crawling space that you could get to the garden outside\nand escape. So they were talking about hiding.",
        "A: Those two families, my -- my parents and Buchman and this old man. That was common for\nthis entire house. The German used to inspect the house, the Jewish houses and of course they\nraided them, they took whatever was -- had the value. So poor young Mr. Buchman used to stay\nalways in this place because they were afraid they will grab him. They --",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. They used to come to our house. It was funny thing because this Gestapo\nofficer was -- I don\u2019t remember his name, I could still see his face, used to -- they used to come\nwith the dogs and with his soldiers and himself. He, who had syphilis, and my father treated him.\nSo he used to come, my father used to treat him. In one of the rooms he arrange his little office,\nand next day the same man with dogs officer used to come and take everything whatever we had.\nOf course, he didn\u2019t pay. And they were always looking for something which was hidden, so\nwhen -- by the way -- when they left, the house was totally disordered because they always\nsuspected we might have a lot of money or whatever, jewelry. And was at least once a week. I\ndon\u2019t know why they raided us all the time, probably some other people too. And also\nBuchmans, and also this man.",
        "A: No, he could escape really, when they were banging on the door.",
        "A: It was the entrance inside the house to the basement.",
        "A: Once, once. It was terrible, I couldn't get to the basement, so I lay on the -- on those shelves.\nBut they didn\u2019t come. They were upstairs, they didn\u2019t come down.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: ...It was the -- they used to call it the aktion that when they rounded Jews, and these -- or kill\nthem, or si -- took them with their cart to the forest. Because on that time they did not really\nexport anybody to concentration camp. Most of the time they used to take them to the -- to those\nbig cars, we call them buda [indecipherable] the covered car. And they take them to the forest\nand they killed them in massive graves. And we already knew about it. There were -- a lot of\npeople were swollen from hunger, begging for food. And you couldn\u2019t give them any food\nbecause it was what you need to survive. So when somebody told us it -- the German care --\nbuda 1s approaching, so everybody run to hide. And bu -- I don\u2019t know what really happened,\nhow come I was along. And I know they went to this basement, and they couldn\u2019t open this door\nany more, and I didn\u2019t now want it. So I felt that Iam so small and skinny, so I can fit on the\nshelf.

And it was -- my father found kind of plas --\nPlexiglas, you know, the ple -- it was not plastic on that time, that we used to embroider star, but\nit has the -- it was small, so you could turn it around if you need it, and hide it. And that was very\nhandy. When they caught you, the game was, oh, I didn\u2019t know it turned. I didn\u2019t wear it, from\nthe first moment. I don\u2019t why I didn\u2019t, and nobody ever stopped me. But my mother used to wear\nthat was made out of piece of fabric of this, you know, sle -- one which was made out of piece of\nPlexiglas. So we had s -- entire collection, and it was very important I remember, to have this\nstar done very precise and right, you know. And then I learned how to make the triangle, which\nhas same -- same lengths of arms, you know, so -- so e -- the second rule, which was the worse\nrule that I remember, was to cut the hair. The men had to shave the heads, and the women\nsupposed to have hair which are only three centimeter. So my mother -- at the first she didn't cut\nmy hair. I had braids, long braids, but I wear the scarf on my head, and my hair was -- so every\nPolish girl used to wear a scarf, so I look really like a Polish girl with my hair st -- hanging. And\nmy fa -- my mother immediately made the permanent -- perm, you know, so it curls your hair, so\nshe could have it longer, not three centimeter. And my aunts also, they all wear with curls.

Really, one that knew me, really didn\u2019t\ncare. So she was afraid, you know, the German way, you are marked right away. I don\u2019t really\nknow, but I was very happy she didn\u2019t -- decided not to cut my hair. So I had this long hair\nwhich, I was unmarked, really.",

And at the beginning I went through\nthe main entrance, which had guard always. And later I discover the hole 1-in the fence. Ho-\nHospital, like everything in Poland was fence.

Apparently people were stealing stuff. So the key were you -- it was key to\neverything, to every little drawer had the key, you locked everything.

Horrible, like wild animal. The first time I\nsaw it. But mostly typho -- typhoid fever, and my father was infected, too, he was sick with\ntyphoid fever. I knew some nuns in -- the nurses were mostly Catholic nuns in this hospital. They\nwere, you know, al-always walking with a white se -- dress -- had this dress, and they were\nnurses in the hospital. And they were very friendly with my father because when the Russians\nwere in, they really wanted to get rid of nuns. And my father suggested to this head nun that\nhelped me later on, why didn\u2019t you just dress? Take off your dresses and dress normally, then\nthey wouldn\u2019t even notice. So they did.

We heard --\nlater on I was, you know, the place was small, so I was more privileged to listen, they were\ntalking about killing. We are afraid to be around it, we are afraid to being taken by train to -- it\nwas the camp, th-they didn't know what exactly are doing in this camp, bel -- in Belzyce, that\nwas the closest camp, and was only camp they kill, so they -- we were afraid to go to Belzyce.\nYou have to completely give up all your property and go, and we didn\u2019t know what they are\ngoing to do with us.

They kill, you know, they --\nwe knew about being taken to the car and driven, and they kill by gas, gassing people inside the\ncar, we knew about those cars. But it was always somebody else, it was not us. Everybody\nwanted to protect, you know, his family and his life. And he -- it was so -- 1 -- I-I -- I think that it\nwas psychologically so horrible that they did. They simply immuned people by feeling sorry for\nother people. You were worrying about your own life, your -- your family, and was -- we knew\nabout others, but nobody cry or feel sorry for them. It was one more day for us. And nobody\nreally -- people used to escape, probably -- I want to survive. It was secrecy. If we had a hiding\nplace, nobody knew about it. And we were afraid of Jewish, it -- it was Jewish police as well as,\nyou know, the -- they had this Jewish police which supposed to deal along with Ukrainian and\nGermans, with the order, you know, whatever. So whenever was si -- they notified they have\naktion that you have to pack 20 pounds and go to the train, the Jewish policemen used to go\naround and talk to Jews. And he -- they collected furs, every fur that you have, you should be\ngiving to German because they were freezing on the eastern front. So they took fur from the\ncoats, you know, every little girl had the fur collar, they took that and -- and the Jewish police --\npolice collected it. And they were obliged to point out who hide the fur, and they did. They did.\nAnd we hated Jewish police, you know, they considered them horrible people. But they were like\ne-every one of us.",
        "A: Well, it was the -- they came from house to house to let us know, and we all collected\neverything, and my father has the coat which was line -- it was fur, 1t was very elegant coat. And\nhe gave it to Ukrainian doctor, and this man wear this coat, and every time I pass by, I saw my\nfather coat, and I was wondering, is he going to give it back to us after the war. It was one that\nhad friends, you know, in the da -- dairy place where he used to collect me, so he gave him his\ncoat.",
        "A: Not really. My grandmother was suddenly crying nonstop. And I don\u2019t know how the other\npeople feel, but I was so angry with her. I felt that she disturbed the peace in the family. It was\ncruel of me. But you know, child doesn\u2019t -- I was very angry. I didn\u2019t feel sorry for her at all.\nAnd she cry for si -- weeks and weeks when she cry. I wanted her to stop. It was so much going\non on that time that --",
        "A: It was something, but I was not there. I know they buried him in Jewish cemetery.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, they -- he die in hospital, so he was buried, yes. I don\u2019t even know where is his\ngrave, but probably my father knew.",
        "A: Well, I think they were trying to obtain the false papers. But I don\u2019t think they have any\nsource that they could do it. And on this point they didn\u2019t yet. When things in 19 -- end of 1941,\nit was a really -- at -- horrible -- the -- the German probably decided to get rid of Jews\nwhatsoever. And the terror start -- was really unbearable. Every time they were rounding people\non the streets they -- there were more and more killing, and e -- and there were two big aktions.\nThey wanted to -- that everybody need to -- needed to report to railroad station with 20\nkilograms, or whatever it is, for deportation. And every time -- probably some people went and\nwere deported. But we always managed to get postponement, because my father was in hospital,\nand he -- so we stay. The family stay, the same [indecipherable] you know, the dentist, they stay.\nAnd he -- only in -- 1t was before cri -- after cris -- after Christmas or New Year, on fr -- \u201941 -\n\"42, Christmas \u201941 and New Year \u00b042 that it was this final aktion and he -- I remember the -- my\nfather was on the hospital on that time, and the po -- [indecipherable] Jewish policeman came\nover and talked to my mother. He -- I don\u2019t know if he was his patient, or he like him, or -- he\ngave -- tel -- he told her in secrecy that in the morning, early in the morning, go and hide,\nbecause Germans going to round everybody and that is end of us. And that was a time when my\nmother spoke to my grandmother, you know, and -- and Buchmans, and she send me at night,\nsend me to hospital to notify my father that she doesn\u2019t know what to do, that we are going all to\ndie. And that was a night that she really -- 1t was late, it was maybe one o\u2019clock at night that I\nwent. And I remember the day, it was seven of January, 1942, it was Ukrainian Christmas.\nBecause they were walking, you know -- they had a tradition also in Poland, they walk with the\nstar and with the -- with the Bethlehem marionet -- you know, little dolls and they go from house\nto house and they play and they get money for showing, you know, having the show, marionette\nshow, the doll show. And they were still walking on -- those young, young people, on the roads.\nSo when I run to hospital, I went through the fields to avoid them, to -- if -- I didn\u2019t want to meet\neverybody, I was afraid. And when I heard voices, I used to just lay down in the ditch. It was a\nroad, and every road has a ditch for water. So I was just laying down in the ditch, waiting for\nthem to pass by. And you feel like trying to go underground, you know, to the tunnel, to hide.\nAnd he -- of course, when I reached the hospital, the lights were on, so I had to really knock and\nDr. Gibywa, that was the one that pull me up to the -- and she gave me this little bag to give it to\nmy father, one that I found which had papers and money left over, his diploma, my birth\ncertificate. The marriage license of my parents. The insurance policy from Italian, you know,\ninsurance firm that my father took before war. She felt that it\u2019s very important, we have to have\nit after war. And -- and pictures. Were loose, you know.",
        "A: It was not a bag, it was like her cosmetic bag. It was like little -- little suitcase, leather, very\nheavy leather and had a very heavy lock. It was completely locked, and had the little handle, and\nthe -- she always used to lock it, that was her safe. And she gave it to me, said give it to Father,\nbecause I don\u2019t know, they might steal it, they might take it. It was always hidden.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t tell me anything, I knew. I knew. She didn\u2019t have to explain anything. On that time\nI was, you know, I was privilege to all the discussions. I knew. We didn't talk about it. She said,\njust give it to your father, and be careful. And tell him what\u2019s happening.",
        "A: I was -- no, I didn\u2019t, it was night, it was really nobody around. I was afraid of Germans, I was\nafraid of Ukrainian police, and I was afraid of the youngst -- young people that might spot me\nand really take me to Germans, so -- because we were not allowed to walk after dark.",
        "A: Gibywa.",
        "A: Well, he hide me. They knew already. They already knew, you know, the news were spread\nall over, probably somebody who was friendly with them notify. They knew, and he was very\nconcerned, and he locked me in this big closet. So I -- and said, \u201cStay quietly here, I don\u2019t want\nyou -- anybody to know you.\u201d And he went for my father, and then they went, and they -- when\nhe came back, it was this nun who took me and she took me from this closet, and it was the\nbathroom, men bathroom. And one of the compartment was used for the other clean -- janitor\ncloset. So she opened this compartment, she had a key -- I told you, everything has a key. And\nshe said to me, you have to sit on -- that was the -- no, lavatory over there, so she said, you have\nto pull your legs, and you have to sit there quietly because -- and I\u2019m going to fetch you\n[indecipherable] and get some --",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Yeah, yes, yes, the patients, that was patient -- they didn\u2019t have -- they had only one place,\nyou know, so the patient used the -- or they use the [indecipherable] or whatever, or they -- it\nwas a man lavatory [indecipherable].",

        "A: No, no. Nobody. Nobody even -- it -- nobody visited me. I had to stay there and behave. But\nwas the worse, it was already night, so probably three or four o\u2019clock, and at six o\u2019clock I heard\nthe German cars, you know, those trucks, big trucks, you could hear that, and they have\n[indecipherable] for I -- I was familiar with the sound of those trucks, and dogs and Germans\nshouting, and Ukrainian police, and so I looks through the louver, and they were on the yar -- on\nthe hospital grounds, and yelling and shouting, and they knock to the -- they have the main\nentrance, which was always locked, everything was locked in Poland, you know. So they open --\nthe doorman opened this door, and they run upstairs and to get all the Jews out. So I saw those\npatients, some on the -- they were taking and loading them to the truck.",
        "A: Some on stretchers, some si -- you know, in the gowns, undress, in the gowns, sick people,\nloading them to the truck. And infectious one they used to kill and throw on the truck. And then I\nsaw some -- Dr. Rebach was a Jewish with a white coat, he was loaded, and my father was\nloaded to the truck. And, you know, some nurses which were helps -- people working with Jews\nwere on the truck. And apparently somebody called this doctor, what was his name? I s --\nGarbovsky, so he came from the house, and Dr. Gibywa was standing and talking to Germans\nand -- and when this director hospital came, they unloaded doctors. So I saw my father --\nbecause on this point I wanted to go, I didn't want to stay there, I wanted to be with him. I was\nafraid to be completely alone. So they unloaded the doctors, and I saw, you know, let them know\n-- apparently he said he doesn\u2019t have doctors, it\u2019s a typhoid fever, he needs to have doctors.

        "A: I couldn\u2019t. I wanted, and I was afraid. I was there and they -- I was petrified what will happen\nto me.",
        "A: When that was over, she came and she took me from this place. And she hide me in one room\nwhich was empty, she put me to the beds. And later on she locked me in another closet, and then\nI was in the basement. And then I was on -- on the attic.

So I was staying there til she comes back and --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Nothing. You are numb, nothing. In evening she used to come back and you know,\n[indecipherable] and s -- nuns that used to live with her, we both knew. And then maybe -- I\ndon\u2019t know how long it was, it was -- my time was just -- when things were quiet -- I was told\nthat my mother is fine and my father is fine, my grandmother 1s fine and I shouldn\u2019t worry. That\nI was told. And he -- one day she -- it\u2019s -- she came and she took me to railroad station, there was\nevening train to Lvov.",
        "A: Yeah. And Sister Blanche waited for me on the railroad station, a second, another one that I\ndidn\u2019t know. And she was such a sweet, young, with smiling face, and I feel very comfortable.\nBefore they took me, they braid my hair differently, they dress me differently in poor, you know,\nlong skirt, because I used to wear those short coat and they gave me diff -- dress me differently,\nand she gave me prayer book to my -- you know, to my little bag, and she -- and rosary, and I --\nprobably she had some papers for me too. And I went with her with -- to Lvov, and nobody\nreally bother us on the way at all.",
        "A: Yes. She was teaching me prayers, which I knew, practically, and she was si -- talking to a\n[indecipherable] she was ta -- teaching me who I am, my new name, where I was born, my\nmother maiden name. And that was kind of -- she -- she used to do that every day, I had to repeat\nthat and tell her and she used to wake me up, what\u2019s your name? To make sure that I really\nknow.",
        "A: Yes. Marisha Borofska. I was born on 29 of different -- February 1929.

        "A: -- I knew prayers, but I have to give my immediate who are you, what\u2019s your name, just to\nmake sure that I really know what is my name, that I won\u2019t hesitate.",
        "A: My new i -- identity, yes. She wanted to make sure that I am not going to hesitate.",
        "A: No, no. In that point I haven\u2019t seen my father and I never saw my mother again. Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. She knew because they even knew where I am even I was in Wamina, because she used\nto send me, though the nuns, she used to send me some cookies that she bake. It must be -- I\ndon\u2019t know how much she paid [indecipherable] to cook them, to do that. Or melted butter, I\nremember. You know, in the [indecipherable] she melted the butter, because it holds longer, and\nshe send it to me. And of course, I couldn\u2019t have that, so sist -- Sister Sophia call me at night,\nlate at night to her room and she used to give me piece of bread that she brought from her supper,\nand she put this butter on, and she said that\u2019s from -- from your mother. And I couldn\u2019t say to\nanyone, nothing. So she knew where I was, and she -- later on I met someone from Turka and the\nperson said that my mother told everybody that I was killed, I was taken by Germans. So she\ndidn\u2019t want anybody to know [indecipherable] question. And it was such obvious things, that\nnobody questioned. But what happened, when I arrived to Lvov, this Sister Blanche let me loose,\nshe didn\u2019t want me -- she was afraid that I might -- somebody might see me. And to make long\nstory short, this Ukrainian girl with her mother was on the railroad station in Lvov and they saw\nme, and they look at me, and I pretend that I don\u2019t know who they are. And they didn\u2019t even get\nclose to me. But when they came back, the mother went to my mother and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\nshe\u2019s alive, I just saw her in Lvov.\u201d So -- but they didn\u2019t know, you know, I was alone because\nthey ask me to leave station alone.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I had no choice. I knew that he -- that was arranged. I knew that. Without him, probably\nnobody would take care of me. But he didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t talk, y-you know, we didn\u2019t have any\nexplain -- they never explain anything to me, it was like that to the end, when I was grown up. It\n-- we had to -- my father and myself, he expect me to know. It was -- he -- we never talk about\npersonal things at all, it was absolutely obvious. There was no explanation whatsoever.",
        "A: No. When I -- when I left, I was totally [indecipherable]",
        "A: I was not there. My parents tried to escape to Hungary. In Hungary apparently it was simpler\nto -- to stay alive, and probably they -- they knew somebody, I have no idea why to Hungary.\nAnd they left with widow of one of the doctors and her son. I was told that by her son. I don\u2019t\nknow how true it is, but I met him in Germany later, after the war, and -- and he -- actually, he\ndidn\u2019t know who I am. I remember him when I was a little girl, and he was like 20 on that time.\nSo when I introduce myself, suddenly he con -- I said, well, you know, I -- we used to escape\nwith your mother and your father to Hungary. And I know they were escaping. And he told me\nstory which shaked me. I have no idea if this true or not, but why should he lie? That they were\nescaping and they were caught by Hungarian patrol, border patrol. And they wanted to return\nthem to Gestapo, to Germans. That was like death sentence. That my mother kneeled in front of\nthese people and they told -- she told them, please don\u2019t do that, I have a daughter and she is\nwaiting for me. And they let them go, but they had to return. So they went back to Turka. I-It\nwas very close to Hungarian border. And he -- so he -- this man and his mother somehow were\nhidden and they survived the war. He\u2019s still alive, he\u2019s -- he lives in Germany. My father never\nmentioned that and I never talked to him about it. He didn\u2019t talk at all. Whatever --",
        "A: No. When I ask him once, he said just, I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Is over. Is nothing to talk\nabout, 1s over. So 1-1t was unsuccessful. So later on my father managed to find -- hide this place\nfor his mother from aunt -- from my grandmother, and he -- papers for my mother that was sent\nfrom Lvov, and sh -- the only thing that she needed to reach the place. And on the way she was\nrecognized by someone, or suspected by someone, we have -- we have no idea. And she was\ntaken off the train in Druhobich and taken to the prison. And she insisted that is not true, that\nshe\u2019s not Jewish, and she 1s so and so and so and so. And my father got news from Jewish\ncommittee over there that he -- they can arrange for her release if he pays so much money. So\napparently my father sent the money. Somehow he managed to get bribe, but money was gone,\nbut he was told he\u2019s too late. So we really didn\u2019t know what happened, if they killed her over\nthere, or they send her to the camp, or -- but we know that she was -- she died. But all my aunts\ndie. They were taken to concentration camp from Lvov, they went to Lvov. Their husband were\nkilled before. And two daughters, my -- each of -- we -- it was only single child in every family\nin our family. So one, Zula, that I mentioned to you, she was hidden by my grandmother and my\naunt\u2019s maid. She was wonderful, and we -- we loved her, she was such a -- she like family\nmember in our house, in their house. And second one, which was older, she was 18, and she was\nblonde with blue eyes, Irena Trepper was se -- somehow arranged for the papers and she went\nstraight to Germans and she said she was to go to work in Germany because on that time Polish\npeople used -- were taken for work in Germany, taught organization. So she went -- they sent her\nto Hamburg and she worked for German family as a maid. And these people loved her. I don\u2019t\nreally know because she never talk about it, she lives in Israel, she\u2019s still there. And after war she\ndecided not to go back to Poland, and she went through Cyprus to Palestine. She knew language,\nshe used to go to Hebrew high school in Nowy Sacz, her father was a Zionist, but it was very\nimportant. She was not the religious [indecipherable] not the same, but they were determined to\ngo to Palestine one day. That\u2019s what she did.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: With Sister Blanche.",
        "A: Well, she took me to Lvov, and they had hom. It means an orphanage near Lvov, on Korkova\nStreet in Lvov. I -- I -- they had two orphanages, one on Swidova, and one on Korkova, and\n[indecipherable] which I went to. But it was this orphanage and he -- many children, we had the -\n- our bedrooms were like 20 beds in one bedroom, one next to another, the old s -- open space,\nbig open space and beds. So I got to one of them, and he -- actually I didn\u2019t go to school at the --\nwhat we did -- I don\u2019t even remember. We work in, you know, in the kitchen and I didn\u2019t go to\nschool over there. It was some kind of fe -- they had some kind of activity. And I went -- I was\nthere a very short time, because the first what happened, that somebody, one of the girls came to\nme and said, well you are Marisha Borofska, we had Marisha Borofska here. It was the name of\nthe gir -- one of the girls, probably they pick out those papers which existed. So nuns got scared.\nSo Sister Blanche came again. She was a courier actually. She used to bring children from those\n-- children with -- Polish children without the parents, orphans from the charitable organization\nto the orphanages. And probably they were paid by those organizations some money because you\nhave to -- they didn\u2019t have money to -- to support those kids, but they really took care of those\nkids. So she came, and when she came back with the new papers, and she change my name to\nMarisha Vorshinska and she took me away from there to Wamina. And --",

        "A: Apparently it came out, because I didn\u2019t say anything, I didn\u2019t react it. I didn\u2019t know what to\nsay. I didn\u2019t react it. And he -- probably they felt insecure. Later on the Mother Superior of this\nconvent in -- she became Mother Superior of entire convent, you know, those nuns, Franciscan\nnuns, but in that time she was simply in charge, Mother in charge in the convent in Wamina. She\nknew -- actually, she was one that agree -- send -- send up [indecipherable] to take me. And he --\napparently she was -- it was just taking place for me, Lvov. But later, after war when I spoke to\nher, she said to me that in Lvov they were afraid to keep me because apparently they were in the\nmiddle of the town and they were simply afraid. So she decided to take me to Wamina. Wamina\nwas close place, it was little Ukrainian village. The only Polish place was this monastery, and\norphanage. And they have some fields and gardens and cows and the whole thing. They have a\nfarm. The nuns were running this farm, which support them a little. But he -- I was really the first\n-- maybe not me, because it was another girl, she was the daughter of the judge from Sembor or\nDruhobich, I don\u2019t know exactly. Her name was Ursula Piper. She was the Jewish girl, and she\nwas very, very Semitic. Very dark, olive skin and very, very dark hair. So -- and I was actually\nthe second Jewish girl that came to this place.",

So everybody was in love with her. On the same time she -- everybody was afraid of\nher because she was very rigid. And she took me after -- under her wings. I don\u2019t know if she\nwas -- felt pity for me, you know, and she was really extremely good to me. The -- years later\nwhen I met someone from Wamina, the girl says to me, oh you were the favorite of doct -- Sister\nSophia, and I think I was. She really like me. It doesn\u2019t mean that sh -- I have any privilege, but I\nfelt that she is really my friend, and I needed it. So I felt very, very comfortable about that.

I don\u2019t\nknow, maybe she did it to others too, because everything was kind of secretive. But she used to\nfeed me, you know, just because I was extremely, extremely thin. I have the -- it was a period of\ntime that I have the lack of vitamins and food, so I develop boils all over my body including my\nface. Here, and nose, and -- of course I am not talking about lice and that stuff which live after\nthis -- under the skin. It was horrible, it was horrible. And whenever I cut myself it was\nimmediately boil, you know? So that was the -- probably lack of vitamins and I didn\u2019t have\nanything at all for -- for awhile ye -- also. So it was -- in some times -- it was winter on \u201942\nalready, end of \u201942, when one day she walked me out and she -- I don\u2019t know what was first,\nwhen she told me about my mother when she die? No, that was first. She walked me out at night\nand she let me -- asked me to dress [indecipherable] and took me to the second -- the con -- it\nwas church in the middle, school and girl\u2019s quarter was on one wing, and second wing was nun\nwings, and guest wings. So she took me to nun wings, and it was a tunnel underneath the church\nthat you could -- in the basement that you could walk through. And she opened the door in one of\nthe guest room and it was my father. Apparently he was sent by German with group of Jewish\ndoctors to the nearby villages to immunize against typhoid fever, because it was again out --\noutbreak of typhoid fever. And he managed to contact Sister Budnofska and she asked him to\ncome. And he -- so he saw my boils and he gave me something, I think. They were suspecting\nthat maybe I have syphilis or whatever, what the hell I [indecipherable] I had that stuff on my\nface. So she gave me some kind of medicine which I don\u2019t know it helped me, I don\u2019t remember.\nFinally it went away. But they fed me a little bit better so it went away. But I saw him on that\ntime, and he -- later on in that morning I saw him in church. He probably -- and he -- I don\u2019t\nknow how long he stayed. And wa -- what was the reason, but he was there.",
        "A: Yeah, and I didn\u2019t react. I didn\u2019t react at all. You know, you see those [indecipherable]\nkissing, no, I didn't react. Okay. Well, apparently he knew where I am, yes. And second\nexperience I had, I think it was beginning \u201933 -- \u201943, I dreamt that my mother died. It\u2019s funny\nbecause I probably cry. And, you know, we have this big bedroom, 20 beds, you know, and so\nsomebody, one of the children wake me up, and then s -- and I couldn't wake up. So when I wake\nup I saw Sister Sophia stand -- and it was night, and she took me away. And she told me that my\nmother die, was killed. So they knew everything about the family, they follow it, you know, they\nwere attached to.",
        "A: Few hours.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. The Sister was -- were in the room, and you know, we didn\u2019t have any secrets with S-\nSophia, and Superior, and later on I left and they still stayed, probably talk.",
        "A: No. He asked me if I behave, he asked me to be a good girl. And Sister Superior complained\nthat I am too daring, that I -- you know, when I -- we have these German inspections and -- and\nprobably I was too visible, they should stay. And that was it.",
        "A: No, no, no, I pretend I don\u2019t know he was here. Cause we used to go to church every day for\nmorning prayers, you know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I cannot -- I\u2019m afraid to think back. I was numb. I didn\u2019t express any emotions\nor anything like that, I didn\u2019t cry. Now I am crying more than that. Now. Probably I was happy\nthat he is fine, but -- it gave me certain security that he exist, you know. I didn\u2019t ask what happen\nwith rest of family, nothing. I didn\u2019t know what to talk about.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. One of the girls later on 1s -- much later told me that I was very reserved. You\nknow, I didn\u2019t want to lie, so I didn\u2019t want to get close, really. I didn\u2019t want to talk about\nanything which personal. So we talk about, you know, everyday stuff, but I was not -- I couldn\u2019t\n-- I didn\u2019t want to tell them, you know, about family and stuff like that, so I was -- I never\nwanted to get close to anyone. I was kind of waiting. It was time when we had in -- we didn't go\nto s-school, school is in orphanage. They have certain classes, but priority was work. So\nwhenever was a field work, we had to do that, the washing, you know, the laundry. It was done\nby girls, and there was plenty of, you know. And they were small, they used to have very small\nchildren, they wet beds, you know, so you have to wash every time all those huge sheets and --\nand laundry was a good place to work because you got extra bread, and don\u2019t forget we were\nhungry, all of us, was no food. So -- and also I was older than my real age, my papers were that I\nam older, so I belong to older children. And also, older children used to hide when German came\nbecause they tried to take Polish children to work in Germany. So we used to hide, and we had\nthis hiding place, they have a big [indecipherable] stage and under the stage it was the -- and we\nused to crowd there, and whenever was German inspection, we lay one and next to another in\nthis little corner, which was invisible even if you light, and later on Sister Sophia used to go up\nand just knock, and everybody crawl out. And there were older children, Polish girls, and there\nwere some -- not children, but youngsters, 18 years old that work at the orphanage, and they\nwere hiding as well because nobody wanted to go to work in Germany. In -- so I was -- they ask\nus to -- every morning Sister Sophia used to either read names of girls which go to kitchen to\npeel potatoes, or they -- another group goes to the laundry, and another group goes to the garden,\nand another group cleans, you know, rooms, we have to -- they were parquet floors, that you\nhave -- they a need -- needed to be absolutely, you know, shining, so that was a lot of work to --\nto [indecipherable] you know, to -- to polish those floors. So there were groups working, depends\nhow old you are, and -- and sh-she used to rotate those groups so not everybody -- so quite often\nI used to go to laundry, and was a great place because you have this extra bread with cheese,\nwith bowl of cheese on top for -- for second breakfast. And of course I had to have a chair\nbecause I couldn\u2019t reach, you know, and you didn\u2019t have the washing machine, but you have to\nuse those, you know, how you call that stuff?",
        "A: Washboards, yes. And I couldn't twist that. I was practically left handed, except that I was\nforced to work with my right hand, so I was twisting with left hand and the Sister in laundry used\nto say, \u201cMaryla, don\u2019t twist like a Jew.\u201d Because it\u2019s different, left hand. It was the -- and I used\nto fake, because I couldn\u2019t get rid of those stains. So you wa -- that was a white laundry, you\nhave to wash it, and then you -- she -- look at that, is absolutely [indecipherable] now you have\nto do it again. And then you -- they used to boil it, it was big boiler, and you used to -- and it\nboils, and after it was boiling, you wash it again, it was white. So I was waiting for her to turn so\nI could throw it into the boiler. And somehow I was pretty successful doing that. Probably\nsomebody else di-did the same. Someone very strong and they washed well, and they were very\nproud of it. But -- and then we used to peel potatoes and work in the garden, and they didn\u2019t like\nit very much. And the fo -- on the fall we used to pick up potatoes, you have to -- in the field,\nthat was very hard work, extremely hard. It was a machine that you have to go and pick up\neverything. Today probably people are leaving that stuff. And so we -- we work very hard, you\nknow, in addition to goin -- going to school.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. She wouldn\u2019t say that.",
        "A: I was afraid. I was afraid. But I -- even today I am doing it with left hand, I cannot do\notherwise. And I didn\u2019t mention anything to the nuns. I felt that it\u2019s much better when I am going\nto be quiet.",
        "A: I think so. You know, they were different people. The only thing they were -- kept extremely\nunder control by Mother Superior, so they wouldn\u2019t do anything to -- you know, to misbehave,\nand they could be punished or sent away, you know, the -- it was tremendous power of Superior\nover the nuns.",
        "A: No. No. And they were daring. On the end it was many, many Jewish children in this. She\nused to admit quite a lot. And not only older one, but also boys in orphanage, th-the small, little\none, we used to call them [indecipherable] the little one, which were like two years old, three\nyears old, there were some boys. And I -- when things were worse, I saw much more children.\nAnd we could recognize them, they were absolutely [indecipherable] different. And also the\nchildren my age, and older people -- younger, they came, it was several names that I can\nmention, were saved by those nuns. Later on --",
        "A: Yes. The [indecipherable] it was a girl from -- probably older than I was, very smart, and\ndefinitely hiding. And it was Teresa Branoff, she came and she was shaved, you know, that --\nand sh -- probably -- she used to dance pretty, probably she used to go to ballet school when she\nwas a little girl. And it was the girl with a brother, a brother was a little one, and he sh -- her\nname was Kovalska, Teresa Kovalska. Let\u2019s see, Teresa Rogashinska, and few more girls. And I\ndidn't know except wa -- oh, Janka Davidovich that I have still contact with her. Her name was\non that time Markofska.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: I knew. I don\u2019t know if the other people knew. She looked very well. She didn\u2019t look Jewish\nat all. But I knew. She\u2019s -- she lives in Poland, she stayed in Poland.",
        "A: No. After war, Sister soph -- Tekla wrote -- well, I wa -- used to correspond with her, and this\nletter 1s amusing that she wrote me because I sent her a letter and I said, I don\u2019t know how I\nshould thank you for what you did. And she send me a letter that she didn\u2019t do anything. That\nwas her mission to do what she\u2019s supposed to do, and she was guided by God. And from her I thi\n-- | learned that was like fa -- 500 children saved by this -- not by her, but entire -- this nun\norganization. So -- and I also kn-knew some other people, it was the professor gynecology in\n[indecipherable], Professor Justaporsky who was save by them, and many, many people, I am\npretty sure that they help my father as well, as much they could.",
        "A: Those --",
        "A: Yes, they were Franciscan -- I think Polish [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know how to translate\nthat. Franciscan order of -- Sister of Maria.",
        "A: [speaks Polish here] -- I have mental block. I have mental block, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, I will.",
        "A: I know it by heart.",
        "A: [speaks Polish here] now that\u2019s what is, yeah. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, I was conf -- constantly with the -- I was afraid. I had this -- I was numb. I couldn\u2019t\nexpress anything, I was afraid.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. It was something probably that I behave like -- like -- like a moron\nsometime, because I was so uptight. Then, quite often, Sister Sophia, who was such a good\nfriend of mine, she called me, Maria, you ha -- how you call the child of cow --",
        "A: Calf.",
        "A: You dumb calf, she used to call me. You know, this used to be the calf. In Polish it sounds\nhorrible, you know. Maria [indecipherable] you si -- Maryla [indecipherable], you stupid calf.\nBecause probably she wanted me to react somehow, and I wa -- had always delay reaction. And I\nknow she was wonderful friend of mine, but even so, you know, she was -- she wanted to\nstimulate me somehow, and I couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh yes. I was tired. Oh, I was overworked and tired, I could sleep anywhere.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t really. I was hoping that I am going, when everything\u2019s over, I\u2019m going to end up\nstaying forever in -- over there, because all the children, you know, the -- they have, the Polish\norphans, they didn\u2019t have parents, or they have dysfunctional family, or they were children they\nnever had any parents. They\u2019re all orphans. And they were actually, as far as parents condition,\nthey were in the same situation. And the way they raised those children, we didn\u2019t have -- they\ndidn\u2019t have any vacation. So they supposed to be na -- nannies, or maids, cooks, or whatever,\nyou know, the lowest of the lower. And actually, they -- most of them got education because of\nthe Communistic parliament. You know, they -- they were taken away from them when\nCommunists came in. And it was always freedom to get the communa -- education, that\u2019s\nactually what Communists did, to one that didn\u2019t have anything. So I didn\u2019t want to be a maid,\nand I didn\u2019t want to be -- so next step, if you learn a little bit, you could be a teacher. So when\nthey ask what do you want to do, I always write I want to be a teacher. I don\u2019t know if I want --\nprobably not, but then I was thinking, what happened? Where I am going to go? I was sure that it\nis no Jew left in the world except this little, you know, clique that we are hidden. And I was not\nsure of my parents. I knew my mother was -- die, and I didn\u2019t know anything about my grand --\nthe rest of the family. And I was sure that it was no Jew left in Poland, everybody was killed.\nAnd in Wamina, it was very close to Turka, and it was in the village, and there were big forests\nover there, and we heard those shots. They used to bring Jews and kill them, you know, they dig\ntheir own grave, and from the roof of the -- you could see, you know, this -- what is going on.\nNot close, was pretty far. And it was every day going on, and I was sure it\u2019s -- no one is left. So\nwhat I am going to do? I\u2019m not going to be a Jew, I don\u2019t want to be a maid, I don\u2019t want to stay\nthere. I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s -- what might happened. When even -- when we went to Warsaw\nalready, during the Warsaw op -- uprising, Sister Sophia used to guard me against the -- they was\n-- they were underground Polish organization, and they organize hospital exactly, and\n[indecipherable] Jews to help him. And I was not allowed to show my face, but they were afraid\nthat they might kill me. They were not Germans. But she asked me to stay in the basement. She\narranged -- they arranged the little chapel in the basement and we used to pray 24 hours, you\nknow, novena for the safe [indecipherable] from Warsaw because we were under shells, and 1-it\nwas horrible, horrible time, and the bombs, you know, Germany used to bombs, and American\nused to bombs, and everybody, you know, and we were there, you know, in the middle of this\nshooting. So 1 -- 24 hours somebody should pray, and I was one that it was 24 hours in the\nchapel.",
        "A: Yes, so one night, it was end of, I think \u201943, the Ukrainian band, you know, the troops,\nwhoever it was, in [indecipherable] was name of the group, they invaded monastery, and they\nwanted to -- they were after Polish people working for Germans to register cows and pigs. And\nso they were after these people, and of course they found them, they kill some of them.",
        "A: Going from the -- from the farm to farm, and tried, you know, register cows and pigs, and\nthey used to put marks on them. So the peasant couldn't pi -- kill those pigs, they had to give\nthem as a conthing -- condint -- give them to Germans, It was for German army. They wanted to\nhave ready -- registration, and whoever killed the pig was severely punished. So they hated these\npeople because they wanted -- they raised those pigs. And he -- so they deci -- they came, and\nthey really didn\u2019t want to have Polish group, a Polish settlement over there. So they killed some\nof the civilian workers, and I think some nuns, and they set fire in the building, and the German\nsaw the fire --",
        "A: Some of the buildings, you know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The buildings that belongs to. And they came from room to room, I remember, I -- I -- I hide\nunder the bed, be -- some -- some kids run away, you know, and the German ca -- saw the fire --\nactually it was Gestapo, I think, and they came, and it -- this band run away, but she -- Sister\nSuperior was told, you better get out of here, because we will get you, so they decided to leave\nthe place. They knew that they are going to -- if not they are going to be killed. They left only\none sister to guard, you know, the place, and German supply the cars, you know, the big trucks,\nand we simply took everything. Everybody was worrying about his possession, so we took as\nmuch as we could. And we moved to Lvov, and later from Lvov we moved to near Warsaw.",
        "A: Yeah, everybody got his belongings, and so I got my little suitcase, and I have couple of -- I\nused to write diary. So I have my diary, and I have my w-we -- I didn\u2019t own anything, really,\nexcept this little suitcase which had my name on, so she gave it to me and everybody -- because\neverybody had to guard his own stuff. And that how we got -- went to Warsaw.",
        "A: Yes, yes, with picture.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: But I remember before I went there Sister Sophia called me and said to me, listen, is a priest\nover there and you have to go and take Communion and he -- you know. So when he\u2019s going to\nask you if you are baptized, or you are Jewish, you should tell him -- y-you are Jewish, you\nshould tell him no, and is not a lie. Because then -- 1-inside you should say no for you. And that\nfor you, you should s-stay quiet. So it was like look [indecipherable]. So she simply told me, you\njust have to lie. And is not going to be a big sin, God will understand.",
        "A: No. Oh, I was a perfect liar. I could lie, too. I could lie and I could steal. Didn\u2019t bother me at\nall.",
        "A: It was in Warsaw, we were very hungry, so we used to go to market, and we used to distract\nthe -- you know, the -- the -- the stable keeper and we used to steal tomato, onion, stuff like that.\nLike crazy. I didn\u2019t need anything else. The only thing that I steal was food. We were hungry.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t ask me. He never asked me, he never bother. He didn\u2019t -- probably he didn\u2019t\nsuspect, you know, whatever. I didn\u2019t have this problem, but she told me to lie. She said is not a\nlie because now I\u2019m -- not for you, not for you.",
        "A: Caesar?",
        "A: Oh no, that was much later.",
        "A: He didn't know anything about us.",
        "A: We met him when we -- after Warsaw uprising.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well they -- we were dispersed to different houses, and I was on the outskirt, in the orphanage\noutside of Warsaw. And -- but later on e -- Sister Budnofska made his point that he wanted all\nher children with her. So she -- and the first the Jewish children, she wanted them -- you know,\nto guard them. And she took me 1-in -- they got the place in section of the ghetto. A house which\nwas -- used to be a ghetto hou -- belonged to ghetto. So we had to -- she got everybody back, we\nhad to clean this building. We got few floors on this house because -- and we have to clean the\nbuilding completely, and that was a hard thing to do because it was so many papers and\nphotographs on the floor. When they took these people away, you know, those papers were --\nand later on somebody plundered the house. They didn\u2019t have use for photographs and papers\nand documents. And I remember cleaning that, and we used to read those documents, and it was\nvery hard for me, at least. In -- and he -- so we settled there til Warsaw uprising. And more childr\n-- Jewish children came on that time. On that time she -- we had the yon -- Janka Markofska,\nJanka Davidovich, and s -- a few more children, and [indecipherable]",
        "A: It was empty already, totally empty. Some building were occupied by Poles which moved in,\nbecause Warsaw was very crowded, and it was -- there were building available, so they moved\nin. But basically it was empty. And they moved the wall of the ghetto, so exactly in, behind this\nbuilding it was the wall, which street was divided by the wall, and it was backyard of the\nbuilding, became backyard. So it was a wall of the ghetto. I don\u2019t know if ghetto was still, but it\nwas -- there was still some activities over there, sho -- the shooting, and German were looking\nfor people that were hiding, you know, and things like that.",
        "A: Next to the -- it -- 1t used to be once ghetto, and they move, you know, but when ghetto\nbecame smaller, they used to move --",
        "A: -- the walls, yes.",
        "A: Well, it was the same. It -- we learn a bit more, it was a school because we didn\u2019t have a\nguard then and -- and we have to wash the clotheses and we had to clean and we had to peel\npotatoes. And also -- what we did also, the n -- it -- nuns found they -- they were -- were shorted\nof money, so we used to make the buttons. You know, the buttons that you make out of thread?\nThey were some steel rings, and you just thread those buttons, so we used to make those buttons\nand they s-sewed the buttons. Used to paint the pictures and they sold the pictures. The older\nchildren used to go and clean in Polish\u2019 people houses, so we used to have jobs like that. I was\nnever sent to clean other people house.",
        "A: No, no, no, she didn\u2019t, no. She didn\u2019t. It was the -- I was older a little bit, and more, you\nknow, familiar with everything. I was the part of the establishment already. I was a oldtimer.",

You really were\nmuch more free to walk, when I was in Warsaw. For instance, we used to go to clinic. I suddenly\nsi -- I lost my vision. It was a period of time that I couldn\u2019t see anything, I hardly could see. So\nSister Sophia took me to eye clinic. They discover that I have a shortage of vitamin A, and I have\nnight -- I have the night blindne -- blindness, I couldn\u2019t see anything. So they gave me a little bit\nmore vitamins and then my teeth were terrible, so I used to go to dentist, 1t was on\n[indecipherable] it was in different part. They -- I -- she used to take me around, it was no real\nproblem, and I really didn\u2019t have any problems, I was kind of lucky, I -- we used to ride the tram,\nbecause everywhere you -- you know, you need to get -- to reach the -- Warsaw is a large city.\nAnd the activities are very limited, mostly work -- work, you work and work.",

So we had those uniforms, you can\nsee on photographs, which we\u2019|l wear over, and again you try, it is too long, or is too big, and\nwhatever fits you 1s yours for -- for an hour of day, or whatever.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have anything which was my own. I didn\u2019t have shoes. The coat -- for instance, if I\nused to go out, I got a coat. But next day somebody else needs to wear this coat. We didn\u2019t have\nanything. We used to mend, and sew, you know, holes, and in addition we were extremely dirty.\nYou know, lice, ha -- everybody has the lice. In the head, on the body. It was just horrible.",

If they want to -- they want to kill\nyou, they should kill you as a non-Jew, and you cannot admit that to anyone. And remember that\nif you admit that, it will be death sentence for whoever is helping you, and for you. So I -- 1t was\njust -- I don\u2019t know if I remember even that, but I became non-Jew. And I wouldn\u2019t admit to\nanyone, ever, who I am. And after -- worrying haunted me for a long time. This not being -- no\nproblems. I have no Jewish problem, I am not a Jew. I remember that I didn\u2019t have this identity. I\nknew I am a Jew, but I didn\u2019t have this implanted identity or religious background, or -- or\nnational background when I was a little child. I came from very assimilated house. So that was\nthe -- I didn\u2019t have problem who I am, I was Polish. I was not Catholic, but I was Polish. And\nthat\u2019s how I felt.",
        "A: No. I just didn\u2019t want to have -- I didn\u2019t want to -- I didn\u2019t want to think about it. I -- I identify\nmyself as a non-Jew. And that was it. I lie to myself.",
        "A: Oh yes. It took quite a long time. It was a fear involved when I stopped lying. I felt uptight.\nLike you change your skin color, you know?",
        "A: Well, we were mostly hiding in the basement, praying 24 hours novena, you know, we change\nand pray to -- I don\u2019t remember what saint it was. I think that\u2019s Thaddeusz, Thad, so whatever.\nHe is supposed to be saint of whatever is save you. And he -- we were mostly waiting things to\nstop. There was nothing to do. You couldn\u2019t go upstairs because we were bombed constantly. So,\nthere were no -- it was no glass in the windows any more. The bomb came so close that some of\nthe walls fell off. So the only safe place was this basement. So we were mostly downstair in\nbasement with nothing to eat. It was horrible. I remember somebody found the sack of the beans,\ndry beans. We used to keep those beans in the mouth that it soak completely, and it was so\ndelicious, raw. Com -- and he -- it was really end -- that wi -- was this hospital and I was not\nallowed to show my face. So some of the girls used to go there to help, I was not allowed to\nshow my face, so I didn\u2019t, and I was afraid. Finally, the German capture the section that we were\nin, it\u2019s Volnush, Ritza Volunush, it was corner of Volnushti and Jelazinna, where this house was\nlocated. And the German came in, they chase everybody from the house, from the bi -- from the\nbuilding. And he -- the way of walking through the street, they used to make holes from building\nto building and walk on the first floors through the apartments to the end of the block, because\nthe very tight building in European. But they chase everybody. Whoever wanted to escape,\nescapes through the holes and to the canal, and from the -- through the canal, but nun didn\u2019t --\nthey didn\u2019t feel they need to escape, it was nowhere to escape. So the home army people\nescaped, but they -- we stayed. And they took us to the street. They immediately pour gasoline in\nthe building and set building on fire. So here we are on the street, and all the buildings are on\nfire. It was -- and they f -- when they got everybody from the buildings, old people, and then\npeople with children, and -- we walk -- they walk us through those burning streets, it was -- I still\nhave that in front of my eyes, just burning streets, and terrible smoke. They walk us to the\nrailroad station which was -- I don\u2019t remember, it wasn\u2019t a main railroad station because in the\ncity that was gone. Some side railroad station. And then we st -- and when we walk -- and\nGermans on both sides, you know, and he -- with the dogs and he -- and the machine guns, and\nhe -- on some of the building which were still burning, we could see the people with the -- funny,\nyou know the -- when you have the handkerchief and you tie four corners and you make a cup,\nthey have those cups with handkerchief with tied four corners. And they were taking bodies from\nthe burning buildings. So they have those flat cars full of bodies, black, black, burned bodies.\nAnd he -- so that was on the way when you walk. And we finally went to railroad station, and\nwas group of Gypsies the German found somewhere. They were guarded, and they gave us soup.\nIt -- it was made from this horse. And doesn\u2019t matter how hungry I was, I couldn\u2019t eat this meat,\nit was sweet, and I just couldn\u2019t eat that meat. And they pack us on train, which was like -- it was\nnot regular train, it was these freight wagons, parked one next to another, we climbed there, they\ntook us to the railroad station, they set camp in [indecipherable]. And he -- they -- some of the --\nthey kept us for awhile, and finally the -- the Sister Superior, the -- Tekla, which spoke perfect\nGerman -- she spoke non-accented German because she was raised by her family in Berlin. Her\nfather, or whoever it was, she told me, worked for Polish embassy in Berlin and she was raised in\nBerlin and she went to school in Germany, so her German was totally untouched by accent. She\nmanaged to work our release. And we walk later on by foot to -- no, we walked, I think, 10\nkilometers or more to the nearby forest. It was -- nuns used to have their retreat and school, and\nwe stayed there to the end of the war. And she -- they said, you know, in -- one of the classroom\nthey gave us, and we slept on the floor, all next to another.",
        "A: Well, apparently she had power on persu -- of persuasion, and they were extremely polite to\nher when she opened her mouth in -- you know, the -- she was a nun, and she was not very pretty\nnun, very stern, you know, type of person. And she was -- she had this power of persuasion. So\nshe decided she has children, orphans, Polish orphans and who happen to be in Warsaw, and we\nwant to go to our retreat, and you have to let us go. Because what they are going to do with\nchildren, you are going to send them to work camp. And she managed to arrange that, and -- and\nthat was when we met this Father Caesar, he also escape from Warsaw and he supposed to go to\nthe man monastery, which was somewhere else, but she changed his direction and he went with\nus to Kostovitz. And we stay in Kostovitz from -- it was in \u201944 yes, til end of the war, which was\nactually when German army passed by, because -- German -- Russian army -- because you\nknow, during the uprising, the army was on opposite side of Vistula, and they didn\u2019t want to take\nany action because it was different group fighting, that was London group fighting in Warsaw.",
        "A: Russian army, with the Polish army, which was fighting with Russian army. And they simply\nwaited for Warsaw to bleed to death. And after uprising actually, they move -- you know, they\nhave invasion, they moved with new invasion and they pushed the Germans away. So it took til\nJanuary, \u201945.",
        "A: Kostovitz?",
        "A: Very close. It\u2019s like 20 kilometer past Warsaw. Very close to Warsaw.",
        "A: No, it was a village, and it was the big farm which belong to -- to the Polish prince over there,\nthe noble [indecipherable] it was -- it -- the big farm, and nearby was a little village which was --\nname was Kostovitz, I don\u2019t know how -- and nuns used to run school and orphanage in\nKostovitz. So they have this school building which they converted to the orphanage for other\norphans which escaped from Warsaw. So they -- and they were -- it was more orphanages in\nWarsaw and they all came to Kostovitz. It means that were the same nun organization.",
        "A: Every group got couple of school rooms, which we used to convert to the -- to our living\nspace during -- at night, and we used to take all those -- we didn\u2019t have mattresses, so it was a\nstraw mattress. So you put the straw on the floor, and some kind of cover over it. And during the\nday we used to move this straw against the wall and our tables, you know, school tables back in\norder so we could have the class. And at night we used to move everything back and have a\nstraw. And was funny, I remember we moved the straw, it was plenty of fleas jumping up. So, in\naddition to our lice, we used to have fleas as well. We felt like dogs.",
        "A: It was a clou -- 1-it was -- they had the bathrooms, main bathrooms which we went to. I\nremember -- I don\u2019t remember it was outside or inside. I think it was inside they used to have\nthose bathrooms wash space. They had electricity over there. It was electricity and we had the\nregular water, running water.",
        "A: Yes, I was born in May, so it -- I was 13 and a half.",
        "A: Oh yes, we --",
        "A: Yes. Well, it was the trouble, because we really were not prepared, and we didn\u2019t talk about\nit. So I remember that when it happen, I went to Sister Sophia and she gave me fact of life. That\nwas -- I -- that was very embarrassing for me, but she talk, and she was very obvious and she did\nit very well, so -- apparently she did that with all her girls.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, we had the pads.",
        "A: Napkins, and we had to wash them. It was not like a disposable. So it was kind of --\neverybody did it very discreetly, so --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, no, no, no. We didn\u2019t talk about it, 1t was a sin, deadly sin talk about sex, and that kind of\nstuff.",
        "A: No, no. My hair were cut when I have those terrible boils and lice. I have so much boils that --\nand they decide to cut my hair because they couldn\u2019t comb -- take away the lice. So I had already\nshorter hair. But I was still growing it, and I had some pony tails. I have to look at the pictures, I\nshould have -- no, I have a shorter hair.",
        "A: Oh, he was -- it was kind of accident, he s -- he -- he glue to me after war, really. He knew me\nduring the -- from Kostovitz. I\u2019m not sure if he knew who I was. He wanted to be some kind of\nmentor, you know. And he was kind of funny, we all laugh at him. He used to take a lot of\nphotographs and he was trying to play with us. It was kind of embarrassing. And nuns didn\u2019t like\nus to [indecipherable] very much with him. But he was a decent person, very s -- helpful, and he\nbecame also teacher, he used to teach us Latin and til today I don\u2019t know anything. And he -- so\nhe organized the school, really, with another priest which was our chaplain. And he was actually\n-- he was not -- he was priest, but he was the francis -- from Franciscan convents. He was a\nmonk, that what he was. And after war, when he really learn who I was, and he came west to\nvisit me [indecipherable] was my father, he tried to keep contact, which for me was very\nuncomforta -- I don\u2019t know why, I just didn\u2019t want that any more. But he -- he was not one that I\n-- he help me out, he help anyone. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know if he really was any help for Jews,\nor for any -- anywa -- body. And he -- later on after war he tried to make [indecipherable] and he\nused to -- he -- he was very resourceful. He helped to rebuild the monastery -- Franciscan\nmonastery in Warsaw. And he used to also collect money, you know, donations, and stuff like\nthat, so he was very visible man. And he then visit me in Israel once, it was funny because on\nthat time, it was before six year war, so Jordan and Jerusalem was divided. And suddenly I am\ngetting phone call fro -- in my office from this secret agent in Israel. And he ask me, listen, it is\nsomebody in Jordan asking for you on Mandelbaumgate, and he want to come to Israel\n[indecipherable], he\u2019s with group of Pilgrims. And he -- who is this man? And he 1s trying to\nspell his name, and I couldn\u2019t figure out what this man is talking about. So before I left the phone\nit was -- the agent was already in my office, waiting. And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are\ntalking about.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhat kind of contact do you have with people in Jordan?\u201d So the\nagent was in my office, and he again ask me, and I said, \u201cCan you write it down?\u201d When he\nwrote it down, I saw Barron, that is th -- and I said, \u201cOh yes, I know him.\u201d And of course I have\nto say, well I knew him during the war, when I was a child in convent and he\u2019s priest, and he --\nyou shouldn\u2019t worry, he\u2019s not a spy, he\u2019s not the Arabic agent. He is so and so and so. So I\ninvited him to Tel Aviv, he came, he stayed with us few days and then he left back. And he was\nvery resourceful because it was communistic Poland. Tho -- he -- he went to Rome. In Rome, he\ngot the papal passport, separate. Well, he got Israeli and Jordanian visa. So when he was back in\nPoland, his passport was totally clear.",
        "A: Which one? In Kostovitz?",
        "A: Oh, I -- we were til probably spring, early spring of \u201945. And he -- there were already some\nparents [indecipherable] picking up Jewish children, and nobody picked me up. And finally nuns\ndecided they need to settle somewhere, you cannot live in the classroom, so e -- they got the\nbuilding, a house from authorities, which was in another town. It was Lubon Kwiofsky. We got\nthe house, which was once mansion of one of Polish noble, which was empty, and we moved\nthere with all the belongings and -- and there where my father found me, 1t was May, May third.\nApparently he -- he was moving with the army, Polish army, from eastern Poland, and he was --\nhe knew the nuns, and the nuns told him where I was. He also lost track of me because we were\nmoving so much, but they told him a possibility that I might be in Lubon, and he suddenly, one\nday he just appear. And -- and his clotheses were torn, he took his army uniform off because\nactually he left the army. He didn\u2019t continue in the corps with the army. So -- and he looked like\na bum. He was unshave. Terrible. I didn\u2019t -- never seen my father looking like a bum, dirty. And\nnuns, of course, help him [indecipherable] and he -- I remember they -- I was doing something,\nso su -- Sister Sophia as -- one the girl said that I have to go to Mother Superior, so I went in, she\ntook me and it\u2019s -- that was my father. And again, I didn\u2019t feel anything. And he said, well -- she\nask him to rest for a few days, and then we took off. He just hija -- you know, hiking --\nhijacking, yes?",
        "A: In some Russian truck because it was no transportation whatsoever.",
        "A: Hitchhiking, hitchhiking, yes. The Russian truck took us to [indecipherable] and then it was\nthe train, which went to another town. It was still tremendous army movement. And we ended up\nin Warsaw, it was nine of May, which was my father\u2019s birthday, and then that was the end of the\nwar. That was the same day. So he managed to get to -- again to army train to medical corps, and\nwe went to Krakow. And in Krakow my father had a friend, same architect Felibook, Jan\nFelibook. We stayed in his house for a few days, and then he took me to Wanska to his friend\npriest, and he left me in Wanska with him til he reorganized something. And my grandmother\nwas still on the eastern Poland, she was waiting for transport from Russia.",
        "A: Paternal grandmother, yes, because she was hidden by his patient, this woman was his patient.\nAnd we end up in Sacz again. My grandparent -- grandmother brother used to have apartment\nbuilding and one apartment was -- before war in Sacz, and one apartment was vacant, so our\nfamily just moved to this apartment. And he -- Aneila -- Aneila was the maid that saved my\ncousin. She moved with us, with my cousin. And he -- we waited for whoever survived to\nappear. And then my aunt came from Romania few months later. And I went to school. It was\nkind of --",
        "A: Moving back? No, he didn\u2019t want to go back to Wamina. This house was occupied during the\nwar by Germans, and later on Polish authority -- the city or town, village offices were set in this\nhouse, and my father just left it the way it was. He didn\u2019t want to deal with this problem. He\ndefinitely -- they wanted him, it was even delegation of people that he would move back, but he\ndidn\u2019t want to do that. He want to stay away from the region. And so when war ended, really, we\nmoved to siles -- lower Silesia, which was German territory once. [indecipherable]. And -- but\nthat where we settle.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. He simply didn\u2019t want to go back. He felt that too many people die in this town,\nand he said, I don\u2019t want to live in graveyard, in graveyard, that how he put [inaudible]",
        "A: Well, I ask him, he said, well let -- let\u2019s not talk about it now. So he told me about my mother\nwhen she survive, and -- and [indecipherable] family, this dentist family, they were hidden by\none of his patient in the village. They said -- they were peasants and they had the barn, so they\nclose one -- they build one wall inside the barn, and these people live -- the family, which was\ngrandmother, son, wife and husband, they live in this narrow, like two and a half feet space. And\nin -- evening used to throw from the top, you know, from the -- used to throw food and pick up\nthe -- you know, bucket with the -- sometimes two days they [indecipherable] hadn\u2019t eaten the\npears who was nearby. But they survive. Was interesting story because my cousin told me how\nthey quarreled, for anything, you know, they fight. Being stuck in this little space.",
        "A: No, he -- it was in -- very interesting. I don\u2019t have this paper any more because I was so angry\nthat I got rid of that. I should have keeped that. He was immunize villages in one -- this small\nvillage. The name of wi-willage -- village was Washinitz, I learn it aft -- from my cousin after\nthe war. And he -- the way Germans acted, they kept-- they kept the doctors over there, and\nwhen epidemic was over they used to kill these doctors. And they got the new one. So my father\nwas in one of the group. And somebody run and said, well Gestapo is in that town. So he knew\nthat when the Gestapo came to the town they are going to liquidate it. So he run. He run to the\nUkrainian church. It was Ukrainian church, the -- not Roman Catholic, but Orthodox church.\nAnd he hides in this church. And the pope, Ukrainian priest came over and saw him. So he said,\nplease save me, I am a doctor in the village. And Gestapo came and -- so he opened the -- the --\none of the block in the floor, said, go down. But my fa -- it was totally pitch black and my father\nsaid, later on when they came 1 -- it was a woman sitting in -- in this cave. Apparently she was a\ndoctor from previous time. So he saved my father, and this woman, young doctor, it was another\nseven months when army came back. And my father said -- he was a funny man, he used to drink\na lot. So my father said, we used to get drunk, totally drunk every evening. Totally drunk, and he\nhad the daughter and son-in-law who was extremely unhappy about the situation. And also he\nhad very sick wife. So my father treated this wife. She was very sick and he -- he -- that how he\nsurvive. And he like the old man. After war, he die. The ji -- Russian wanted to immediately\nprosecute him, but my father testify, so that was -- they left him alone, but he was a old man, and\nhe die, his wife die. But when we [indecipherable] already [indecipherable] in Yagura, one day\nmy father told me that his son-in-law and his daughter came in, and they very Ukrainian. And his\nson-in-law was immediately arrested, and he was sentenced, I don\u2019t know for what. So my dad\nagain went and testified that he saved, blah, blah, blah, but actually the old man did it. And he s -\n- his son-in-law was lawyer, or some kind of judge once. It was Ukrainian family.",
        "A: What happened, my father was not alive any more, and hi-his wife, some co -- somebody\ncame from [indecipherable] Yagura and this Mr. Yanofich or Yanofsky told him that he saved\nmy father, and they started that I should do something about it. You should do something about\nit. So I wrote to Yad Vashem -- and there was another lawyer in Israel who was nagging me\nabout that, and they knew very little about it. I knew very little as well. So I wrote to Yad\nVashem, and I wrote them what I heard from my father, that this man Rostoski, saved my father,\nand his family saved him. And I didn\u2019t realize that name of this man, not his father-in-law, came,\nhe got the awa -- paper from Yad Vashem. But I just decided not to do anything about it, I just\nwant -- few years ago he wrote me a letter, the old man, very angry letter, that he supposed to get\nsome kind of money from a claim [indecipherable] whatever, because everybody who got this\naward gets money. And I was kind of shocked. So I wrote him a letter that it\u2019s true that I testify,\nbut actually I testify for your father-in-law, not for you. Cause I heard from my father that not\nyou, but your father-in-law saved him. [indecipherable] and he was a pope. So he wrote me a\nlong story, how it happen, how my father, you know, came to this place, and what happen that he\nrun without breath and blah, blah, blah, and he used to pick up the -- you know, his dirt and --\nand see that he has a child, and he had to -- afraid the German, somebody might discover it. \u2019'm\nsure he was afraid. It was very brave. But it was a long, long story, full of anger. And also he was\nangry about this woman doctor, that she never really k-kept contact, and she\u2019s well off, and she\nsaid, when your father left Poland the German pay him a big reparation and it shoul -- part of the\nmoney belongs to us. You know, it was kind of -- and I was so angry that I didn\u2019t responded at\nall. I did show it to someone and I decided, let\u2019s get rid of that. It\u2019s not a document, it\u2019s just\nangry letter. But the story was that his -- this drunk man really save him.",

I could s -- so this case, when I was in Wamina, was in with nuns, you\nknow, with the -- in the storage place, and later on they couldn\u2019t keep that because everybody\nwas moving. So I kept that, and it was dirty. And it has the cover, and I used to keep my books\nand everything between the cover, in between the space so you can\u2019t [indecipherable] out. So\nwhen I left, the nuns gave my father -- it was something else that my mother sent to them, that\nthey gave her back some kind of tablecloth, part of that they sell. My mother used to have\nbeautiful, beautiful hand embroidered tablecloth, and some from Italy, and so -- whatever they\nsold, they sold, but rest they gave to my dad. And of course I have this case, and when we were\nat home, he just pry open the lock. So lock was not good any more because it was opened. But I\nstill kept that, you know, this case.
