        "Q: This is Arwen Donahue. It\u2019s January 10\", 1996 and I\u2019m here with Mr. Robert Holczer in\nParis, Kentucky and this is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview tape one,\nside A. And Mr., Mr. Holczer, if we can just begin by you telling me your name at birth and\nthe place of birth and your date of birth.",
        "A: I, my name is Robert Holczer. I was born in Budapest in 1929, August 31.",
        "Q: And, will you tell me something about your mother and your father, their, their names and\ntheir family backgrounds?",
        "A: My father was, my father\u2019s name is Lajos Holczer. He comes from a very poor working\nclass family, a Jewish family that was almost totally assimilated into the Proletarian\nenvironment. They lived on the outskirts of Budapest in a tenement without any water and\nelectricity. My grandmother was practically the sole supporter of the family until the\nchildren got a little bit older because my grandfather was a, what you would call a /umpen\nproletary (ph) person who did not really care too much about father responsibilities. The, so\nmy father was the oldest one who made it into adult life, there was somebody else ahead of\nhim but died of tuberculosis. And he has always been a great support to his brothers and\nsisters. He was a working man, he has always worked for other people. Eventually, he\nbecame kind of a, an amateur druggist, worked for companies but he did not have a formal\neducation and after the war, he joined a co-op. He rose to kind of a mid-level managerial\nposition but he basically was always just a working man. He never went beyond the second\ngrade and he taught himself how to read and write and everything else. He had exceptional\nqualities in math and law. My mother\u2019 comes from a small northern Hungarian town, Vacz.\nThis is where the Danube turns suddenly south and she comes from a middle class family,\nOrthodox, very religious. She had a brother and a sister, both of them who died in World\nWar II. The sister was deported, the brother died in labor camp. Her entire family from\nVacz were, was deported to Auschwitz and died there. My mother never had to work,\nbasically, my father was always making enough money and she enjoyed just being a\nhousewife. Anything else?",
        "Q: Did you say how many brothers and sisters your father had?\n1 Cornelia Oestreicher",
        "A: My father had thirteen brothers and sisters, yes, and he was the oldest one to survive, to grow\nup, because his older brother died, very early. So, the burden of supporting the family was\nalways on him. So he was the provider type and my mother had no basic responsibility.\nShe was basically what you would call a_petit-bourgeois lady and I always admired my\nfather\u2019s values more than my mother\u2019s but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t love my mother. My\nmother also survived the war with me.",
        "Q: How did your father and your mother meet?",
        "A: My father and mother met, so that, my father was working for a wholesale drug distribution\nfirm. By drug I, we mean a cosmetic supply firm, but in Hungary they were called druggists,\nmaking cologne water, things like that. It had nothing to do with what we call drugs today.\nIt was not a pharmaceutical company. And my, at that time, in Hungary and in Europe, it\nwas the custom of middle-class families to send their daughters to secretarial school and then\nhave them work for a few years for some firm, hoping that they\u2019re going to catch a husband.\nAnd my mother caught my father there, which was very much to the dislike of her family\nbecause my father, they felt, was much below their class and they made him feel that way in\nall his life. Of course, I cannot really say what would have happened after World War II\nbecause my mother\u2019s entire family was wiped out, practically. Only a few people who lived\nin Budapest remained. So, but I resented them for a very simple reason, that they looked\ndown on my father who I thought was a, was a very, was a man of integrity and, and hard-\nworking, a good human being.",
        "Q: Were they, how did they treat you as a child?",
        "A: I had a very strange relationship with my mother\u2019s family, especially my grandparents\nbecause they were very religious and I was born irreligious and whenever I had to visit with\nthem they forced me to wear a hat even in the middle of the summer and eat a certain kind of\nvery strict kosher food, go to the synagogue every night and pray and, and in general, they\nconsidered me some kind of a, what they call in Yiddish a shaygets, somebody who 1s kind\nof just an outsider because I never really went along with their, with their religious rules. I\nalso resented the fact that my grandmother was kind of a, of a, of a very angry person. I felt\nthat, that the way she treated others and the way she treated my grandfather, I resented that.\nI didn\u2019t like to go there and my mother, of course, always wanted me to go and visit and I\nhave, I just finally decided to take my revenge so I would not have to visit anymore. And\none day, this was, I must have been about eleven or so, I went to a butcher shop, got a huge\nham hock and got out and when the people went to the synagogue Friday night, I was eating\nit without a hat and pretty soon they were reporting it to her and they were coming and that\nwas my last visit. They immediately sent me back to Budapest and I never had to visit again.",
        "Q: Was your mother angry with you?",
        "A: Yes. My mother was very angry, but my father and I, we always had some kind of an\nunderstanding. Even when he scolded me for something that, that had something to do with\nreligion to go along with my mother, I sensed in his voice that it was not serious, that he just\ndid it for my mother\u2019s sake. And I also found out since, between 1948 and 1950, I went to\nIsrael, I was in Israel which we will come back later, when I came back and I spoke Hebrew,\nI realize that my father doesn\u2019t know how to pray, that he just mumbles the words. He has\nno idea, what really, how to even pronounce them and he did this all for, for the love of my,\nmy, my mother and I appreciated this, that he put up this pretense but it was an interesting\ndiscovery for me, that. So he never, he never really scolded me and he was practically\ninfluential after the war to put down his foot and say, forget about kosher anymore, let\u2019s just\neat what is available. And so we did not have a kosher household anymore.",
        "Q: Now was your father\u2019s entire family not very religious, then?",
        "A: Yes, yes, they weren\u2019t. They were Jews, they never, they never doubt their Jewishness.\nThey knew they were Jews but they were secular Jews, you know? And interestingly, quite\na few of them survived because of the place where they lived. Since they lived in a\nProletarian tenement of\u2014city tenement\u2014that was given to people under a certain income\nwho had too many children and not enough income, there, the Communist Party, the illegal\nCommunist Party had a very strong hold on this area and when, then, the World War II came\nand the Nuremburg laws and everything else, some of these Communist leaders, Communist\nmembers, came and actually rescued members of the family. I have an uncle in Hungary and\nhe, for example, was a very good friend of a past Communist prime minister who just died\nrecently because they practically lived side by side. So a great deal of the Hungarian\nleadership, Communist leadership, came from this tenement. So that helped rescue them.\nThe Communists were the only, the only group you could really turn to, during those terrible\nyears that, that would help you.",
        "Q: So, was religion mainly only recognized in your household on holidays, or... .",
        "A: Yes. Yes. My, my father always talked to me and said go, you know, to the synagogue,\nyour mother wants you to go and all this and that, but he never really did anything to force\nme to do whatever with religion. He just asked me to respect my mother\u2019s wishes and so I\nhad Bar Mitzvah and that was the last thing that I did. After my Bar Mitzvah I never\nprobably went to synagogue again unless it was a tourist attraction, I just, wanted to see what\nit is, inside. And, but I never denied my Jewishness so when my grandchildren especially\nask me about religion, I say Iam a Jew but I\u2019m not Jewish. And they ask me, \u201cHow can that\nbe?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s easy.\u201d",
        "Q: Did you have any sort of, any sense of faith?",
        "A: No, not really. It\u2019s a strange thing that I have never been somebody who believes in the\nsupreme being and so maybe, eventually, my lot, this is going to be difficult, but because\nthey say people who have faith, they die much easier than the ones who don\u2019t, but I always\njust associated with people who practically felt the same way and it never caused any\nproblems so far in my life, in my sixty-six years. But I can\u2019t remember when I really\nhonestly believed in a supreme being. And then of course, the war probably wiped out, if I\nhad any doubts.",
        "Q: Will you say something about your relationship with your father?",
        "A: My relationship with my father was always very good. I [indecipherable], I considered him\nalways my, my example, my hero, and I was very very upset when in 1942, he was taken\naway and sent to a labor camp in Yugoslavia. And when he came back in 1945, he, of\ncourse, I was overwhelmed and in my memory too, even though I spent more time with my\nmother, a lot more than with my father because he was also a traveling salesman for a long\ntime and I only saw him on weekends, somehow my memory is much more blurred when it\ncomes to my mother than when it comes to my father. My mother, one reason it might be\nthat my mother died in 1970 and my father died in 1980, so he survived ten more years and\nsince we lived in Europe from \u201974 on, at least for six years I had a lot more contact with him\nthan I would have if I had stayed in the U.S. I always considered him an absolute statue of\nintegrity and, and honesty and he was always looking out for my interests and I, even though\nwhen I as an American, had a very nice living, I made a very nice living and I didn\u2019t need\nany, any material, he was still saving and collecting things for us in Hungary and was always\ngiving us a lot of things when we went to visit him and we kept telling him that he should\nspend it on himself. He, he was just one of the most unselfish people I have ever met in my\nlife.",
        "Q: And you felt this way from the time that you were a small child...",
        "A: Yes, always, always. He was always that way. Just a very simple, very simple man. Very,\nextremely intelligent, uneducated but a true human being. And with my mother, I always\nhad a little bit of my doubts that she\u2019s not as straightforward as my father. And there were\nlittle incidents that kind of, as a child, it\u2019s amazing how it gets engraved in your mind and\nyou cannot get rid of it. And the thing that I was very, very bitter about, that I could never\nforgive my mother for, was that while my father was in concentration camp in Yugoslavia,\nshe took a little job and she worked for a drugstore in the center of Budapest. And next to\nthe drugstore was an antique store. Mr. Klein was the name of the man who owned and he\nliked my mother. My mother was a cute little creature and everybody liked her and so he\nwould wait for her when she closed this shop to escort her home because he lived the same\nway and I didn\u2019t see anything wrong with this, but they noticed how jealous I am of my\nmother and it\u2019s not that I wanted to possess my mother, I just, I was protecting my mother\nfor my father and so he put his arm around my mother and they were looking at me and\nlaughing at how annoyed I became and this picture is constantly in my mind. And I could\nnever forgive my mother for this, that, that she did not realize how hurt I was by playing this\nsilly game. And she was, still she was a good person, she did everything possible to give me\na good education and, but, she had a very petit-bourgeois thinking and another thing that\nsomehow stood between the two of us was piano. She decided that I\u2019m going to be a great\npiano player and I decided that I have no interest in playing the piano and she would\nsometimes get so annoyed that I did not practice that she would take a rug-beater and run\nafter me and try to beat me but I was much faster than she was so we were running around\nthe table and then eventually she just broke down and cried that she couldn\u2019t catch me but\nshe had this obsession with, with, with piano playing and so again, ever since in World War\nII, our piano was destroyed. We gave it to somebody for safekeeping and they claimed that\nthe, the bomb got it, whatever, I was glad. She wanted to buy another piano and I said no.\nWhen I, when we came up from the cellar after liberation, I said, that\u2019s it. I am now a man.\nI basically rescued my mother more than once during World War II and I said no more piano\nand I never sat down to play the piano. Never. I never had the urge.",
        "Q: You talked a little bit about your relationship with your mother\u2019s family and I was interested\nin hearing your relationship with your father\u2019s family.",
        "A: My father\u2019s family was my favorite side of the family. I had a grandmother, a typical\nProletarian woman with thirteen children and not much of a husband. And I remember\ngoing out and loving every moment of spending time with them because here I came, I was\nthe, the, the second grandchild in the family. There was one older one who, unfortunately,\nduring the war, was killed. So I was kind of the sweetheart of everybody and they were\npampering me and taking me to places and my grandmother, I remember, had a tremendous\nknowledge of how to make beans in at least fifteen different ways. There were beans every\ntime I went out, they had beans, beans, but she was just a marvelous woman, a very warm-\nhearted, a typical country woman. She came from southern Hungary from a very small\nvillage and after raising thirteen children during the day, she left them in the care of my\nfather and then went from door to door selling silk stockings just to add a little bit to the, to\nthe income. The, my father\u2019s brothers and sisters were, of course, some of them are only just\na few years older than I am, so they were almost like brothers and sisters to me at that time\nand since there was no money at all in the family, they resorted to somehow, illegal things. I\nremember I loved ice skating and they said, oh no problem and they took a huge scissor\u2014\npair of scissors\u2014and cut a big hole and pushed me through the hole into the ice skating rink,\nnearby, so we always went ice skating. A lot of things were solved not by very legal ways,\nbut as a child, this was life to me. There were a lot of children in the tenement constantly\nhorsing around and nobody, nobody was constantly bothering me and, and, and disciplining\nme and getting ahead or going to the synagogue, nothing. It was a great freedom and I just\nenjoyed it very very much.",
        "Q: Did you have a particularly close relationship with any of your father\u2019s siblings?",
        "A: Any of my father\u2019s brothers or sisters?",
        "Q: Mmm-hmm.",
        "A: Let\u2019s see, did I? No, I really had a very, very good relationship with all of them, with\npractically all of them. And I cannot really say that one or the other, I liked one particularly\nand interestingly, I spent the least time with him. He was a, just kind of a very outstanding\nfigure, a tall, very mascular [sic] man who went to Czechoslovakia during the War, World\nWar II and somehow worked for a shoe factory, which was a very famous shoe factory all\nover the world, Bata, got married there and came once to visit us and I still remember his\nvisit. I was so impressed with him, with his, there was just an air about this man that\nimpressed me a great deal and, unfortunately, when there was the big uprising, there was a\nbig Slovakian uprising against the Germans in 1944, and he was an officer in the, in this\nuprising, in the Partisan Army, and they caught him and he was hanged. So, we knew this\nfor sure because his wife survived the war, he was a Gentile and he has two children living in\nSwitzerland today. One, I\u2019m sorry, one, the other one is a stepbrother. He has one and I met\nhim and so I knew the story. But, this, this was the man who, to me, was an outstanding\nrepresentative of my father\u2019s side of family. But, today, there are only two men and one\nwomen [sic.] left of the thirteen. I mean, they\u2019re in their late seventies, so, but on my\nmother\u2019s side, no brothers, no brother, no sister, practically. I only have one cousin left on\nmy mother\u2019s side in Budapest today. He\u2019s younger than I am, so, that\u2019s.",
        "Q: What were your, did you have particular interests as a child or special things that you liked\nto do?",
        "A: I was an avid cyclist. I loved to, I loved to bicycle. I would come home from school and\nimmediately take off and go, there was a big park, we lived near the, the, we lived on the\nPest side and there was a so-called rose garden in the center of Pest and that\u2019s where I met\nwith my friends every afternoon. And we were comparing our bicycles. Bicycles were the\nsame as cars today for us. I mean, it was, it was a thing and we admired the one who had the\ncustom-made one or had just even custom-made parts, and so we had big races on bicycle\nand then that was it, so I was heartbroken when in 1944, one of the first things we had to take\nin when the Germans occupied Hungary was the bicycle and the radio. And I lost it. I also\nbelonged to an underground Boy Scout group, I was an avid underground Boy Scout. The\nreason I say underground because we couldn\u2019t be legal Boy Scouts. The Boy Scout\nmovement, which was based on brotherhood and equality of all, declared that Jews are not\nequal and therefore all Jewish Boy Scout organizations were disbanded and Jews were also\nthrown out of those Boy Scout groups that were not affiliated with some Jewish school or\nsomething. I belonged to the so-called Three-Hundred Ten, number Three-Hundred Ten\nJokay Mor Boy Scout group. Jokay Mor was a famous Hungarian writer, a humanist. He\nwas not Jewish but he was a humanist. And we met illegally, sometimes in the basement of\nsynagogues and then we had to split up later into smaller groups and it was in, in homes, in\none, the small groups consisted of about ten, between ten and fourteen people and so we just\nrotated and did all kinds of things, besides hiking, we were building model airplanes and did\nwhat, what Boy Scouts usually do, otherwise. I have always, always dreamt these days, I\nhad always dreamt about one day having a uniform. The uniform was unbelievably\nimportant for me, like most kids of my age at that ttme. And I was always dreaming about it\nand at school, I just looked at my classmates who were, of course, Christians and could wear\nthe uniform and just, I dreamt about that one day, I\u2019m going to have a uniform and the sad\nthing is that after the war, when we met for the first time, those who survived in our group,\nand we went to get the uniform and we put it on and all of a sudden, to most of us, it didn\u2019t\nmean anything anymore. We were, it\u2019s hard to say, either we were too old or too cynical by\nthat time to really attach any importance to the uniform, so I never wore it again.",
        "Q: Did you attend a secular school?",
        "A: Yes, I have always attended a secular school, except my first fourth grades were in a, the\nJewish orphanage ran a school, it was basically a secular school, but the Jewish orphanage\nwas in charge in order to have enough money to raise the orphans. So the orphans lived in a\ndorm while we who were coming from the outside, we had to pay tuition. And it was\nnearby, I spent four years there and then, middle school. I went to a secular state school,\nmiddle school because it was exactly next door to my house. And then, of course, came\nthe... 1944, and 1943-44, I couldn\u2019t go to high school. There\u2019s one incident in my middle\nschool that I felt had very, very important consequences for the rest of my life. We were, as\nbasically innocents abroad, to the point where I really didn\u2019t pay much attention to being\nJewish or not Jewish until this incident happened. In fifth grade, it was an art class and my\nart teacher was drawing something on the blackboard and we had to copy it, exactly. And\nthen color it exactly. And he came by and for some reason, I used a different kind of color or\nsomething and he always walked around with a huge cane, which was not unusual in those\ndays for teachers because teachers...\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\nTape 1, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape one, side B of an interview with Mr. Robert Holczer. And Mr. Holczer, I was\njust asking you about your education and you were going to tell me about an experience that\nyou had that you said was very significant.",
        "A: Yes, in fifth grade, the, the idea of art was for the art teacher to draw on the blackboard and\nthen for the rest of the class, class to copy it and color it. The, teacher came around and\nmade sure that everybody\u2019s following his instructions and just to emphasize that he means\nbusiness, he had a big cane in his hand and for some reason, I missed a couple of the colors\nand used something different. He became absolutely just, angry, unreasonably so and started\nto beat me to the point where I began to bleed through my nose. And I also became frantic\nseeing the blood coming from, from my nose and all this so Iran home. I mentioned before\nthat I lived next to the school. The other house was where we lived, apartment house. And I\nran up to my mother\u2019s, into my mother\u2019s arms and asked her to clean me up and come and\nbasically what I wanted is justice, I could not, even at the age of eleven, I couldn\u2019t believe\nthat this 1s going to be the way it is. And I wanted her to come in and do something about it.\nAnd after she cleaned me up she said, \u201cNow you must understand, a lot of things that you\ncannot understand now, I cannot go in and do anything, yes, except apologize for your\nbehavior.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat, what behavior, what did I do, used the wrong color,\u201d and she\nsaid, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t understand just now.\u201d [Clocks chiming] And the reason, what I left\nout was a very important thing. The teacher was yelling at me as I was running out of the\nclass, \u201cI hope you go to Palestine to sell oranges. That\u2019s where you belong.\u201d And so when I\ntold my mother, this is when her reaction came. So she came back to school with me and\ninstead of demanding some kind of a remedial action for this, apologized to the teacher. And\nI thought that was, that was a very strange thing. I didn\u2019t understand at that time. I did\nunderstand it, years later, that this was the only course she could, she could take. Obviously,\nshe was afraid that maybe they will kick me out of school if she does something else. And\nevery Jewish family, of course, wanted to have their son finish middle school. And that\nincident somehow frustrated me to the point, it created a mental block. I never drew or never\npainted in my life since. I am such idiot when it comes to, to do anything with my hands that\ninvolves drawing or painting that it is pathetic. When we play some games, for example,\nwith my friends, when I have to draw something, they can\u2019t believe that, they think my\nperception is that of a mentally retarded person and it is, it is ust a, just a block. However, I\nappreciate art very much. I never fail to go and see an exhibit of paintings and drawings. I\njust don\u2019t want to do it and I cannot do it myself. Now it\u2019s possible that this can be unlocked\nin time but by that time I won\u2019t be alive. So, I rather just leave this.",
        "Q: Did you father care about this incident?",
        "A: No, my father was not around anymore. He heard it after the war and of course by that time,\nI could, I understood the whole situation better.",
        "Q: Was that the first instance of anti-Semitism that...",
        "A: ...Hit me for the first tume? Well, the first one, I remember was when I was six and I was\nplaying marbles with, with kids and I won. And one kid said, threw the marble down the\ngutter and said \u201cI\u2019d rather throw it down the gutter than to give it to a Jew.\u201d And I went\nhome and asked my mother, \u201cWhat, what does it mean?\u201d So, that really was the first time\nthat something like this hit me. And since I went to a Jewish school for the first four years, I\nwas not really exposed to things like this. But the minute I switched and in fifth grade,\neverything started. Luckily, there were some teachers of course, in our school who tried to\nmake up for this. And I remember a couple of them. Unfortunately, they\u2019re not alive\nanymore but they did everything possible to, to make our life a bit more civilized. And one\nof them was even fired because of that. But not everybody was like this.",
        "Q: He was fired because he was...",
        "A: He was very protective of, of Jewish children and he was also fired because we had a special\nsubject called, how would I, how would I translate this, Defensive Studies, which meant,\nbasically, kind of a ROTC type, except it was sheer propaganda. We had to, the book\ncontained sentences that were so revolting as far as Hungary\u2019s neighbors were concerned.\nFor example, the Romanians were described as monkeys on a, on a tree, their intellectual\nlevel and, I mean, for every nationality that surrounded Hungary, they had a very derogatory\nterm. And, actually, the book was preparing you that one day we will get even. And what\nhe was, among other things, he was teaching this subject, and he said, \u201cPut the book away\nand let me tell you what life is about.\u201d And it was a very, very human, humanistic lecture\nthat he would give us every day. And, after the war, to our great satisfaction, but not\nsurprise, he was named as the first director of the Hungarian Academy of Physical Sciences,\nso, he, they recognized him. And he was then, I talked to him later and he was in the Illegal\nSocial Democratic Party, so that also helped him. But, there were teachers and I had a\nteacher, I don\u2019t even know if he had any political conviction, but he was a human being and\nhe always tried to mitigate any law, anything, but, but as a child, for example, even, even in\nmiddle school, I had to go once a week to three hours of, of labor, battalion practice. This\nwas one of the most humiliating experiences that anybody can have. They had the scum of\nearth in charge of us, it was not teachers or any... we had to report either at school or\nsomewhere on the outskirts of Budapest to a practice ground where these hired instructors\nthat were a lot worse than any drill instructor I have ever seen in any movie, any American\nmovie, because it\u2019s not that, it was not just the physical, the physical abuse can be tolerated,\nbut it is the mental abuse, but that was so, so bad, the way they called us everything, a Jewish\nthis and a Jewish that, and these were people hired to do this job and besides of marching\nand, and digging and building, constantly, we were abused and constantly even physically\nso. Many times they beat us and all this. And we had to go there about three hours on a\ncertain day. The Christians then went to three hours of practice of what you would call\ntoday ROTC. They had, they had marching drill practices and all this. But ours was\ncompletely different.",
        "Q: What year did that start?",
        "A: What year? Well, I was in fifth grade, right, so it was about 1940 when I entered the middle\nschool. It was about 1940.",
        "Q: By that time, had any of the anti-Jewish legislation, I know there were a few things that\nHungary had adopted, was that affecting your family at all?",
        "A: Well, yes, in a sense, that some people in the family, such as my aunt, who was very young,\none of my father\u2019s sisters, and, was married also to a young, twenty-one or twenty-two year\nold man. He was called up to go to the eastern front and, and he go into labor battalions, in\n\u201941, I\u2019m talking about \u201941 because that\u2019s when Germany declared war, Germany attacked the\nSoviet Union. Immediately, the very young, I think twenty-one old Jewish men were called\nup. They had to go to a certain place in their own clothes. They didn\u2019t get any uniform,\nanything, and taken to the eastern front immediately for mine, got to, to pick up mines, okay?\nAnd many of them without any previous experience and, and, and any schooling as to how\nto do it, of course, blew up. Now, the reason I am mentioning this because my father\u2019s sister\nwho was very young and married to a young man, interestingly, when he was taken to the\nfront, for some reason, somebody made a mistake and his unit was issued Hungarian army\nuniforms.",
        "Q: This is her husband?",
        "A: Her husband, yes, okay. And he then went to the photographer for something and just had a\npicture taken, proudly posing in a Hungarian military uniform, he sent home. By the time,\nthe picture arrived at home, he was dead. He was blown up on a mine. And this picture\ninitiated a whole avalanche of events in our family because my aunt who was an extremely\nshrewd person, used this picture to start, to basic... declaring herself first as half-Jewish,\nwhich was an exceptional position then. And as the Nuremburg laws were tightened more\nand more so, she took one more step and one more step and one more step in pushing this\nwhole idea that she\u2019s not really under this category of the Nuremburg laws. And it, the\nwhole thing accelerated to the point where the last, when the only way she could be declared\nan exceptional person, as they were called, which means that you\u2019re not considered Jewish,\nwas to take my grandmother down to the police station and that was a scene I remember: her\ntaking my grandmother down and my grandmother had to, under oath, sign an affidavit that\nshe is an, she was an illegitimate child because my grandmother was cleaning house for a\nlawyer, a Christian lawyer who was dead by that time, a bachelor. And she signed this\naffidavit which made her a, a Christian. And with a husband who died in military uniform,\nso he was obviously a Christian, with her mother signing this affidavit that she was\nillegitimate, and the father was a Christian, she practically cleared herself and then set out to\nsave the rest of the family. And, as I mentioned to you before, she did an excellent job up\nuntil 1944, October, that was the point where nobody could do anything anymore because\nhell broke loose in Hungary and the scum of earth, the worst elements, the so-called Arrow\nCross Party took over and ruled from October 15\" until January 18\" when Pest was\nliberated.",
        "Q: Back in the beginnings of the war, when there were, did your, did your family experience\neconomic hardships when there were economic restrictions on Jewish...",
        "A: Yes. Obviously, everybody experienced this because the men were away and there were\nvery, very few employers who would feel obligated to compensate the family. And so a lot\nof people were actually either starving, or the mother had to go and look for a job, or if the\nchildren were old enough, they had to go and work and do something. We were in a very\ngood position, my mother and I, for a while, because my father\u2019s employer felt obligated to\nsend us part of his regular monthly salary, so we did get money.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s come back to that and first, if you would, tell me how your father was taken away and\nwhen?",
        "A: Okay, my father was taken away several times. You know, Hungary was kind of a strange\npart of that Nazi area because the Hungarians, the Hungarian government has always been in\nthe hands of the aristocracy, Hungarian aristocracy, and the Hungarian aristocracy had no\ntaste for Jews but also had no taste for killing or murdering Jews. They were above this, and\nso therefore when the dictator of Hungary, Admiral Horthy, had to appoint a government,\nmost of the time that government would not eventually do everything that the Germans\nwanted them to do. So it was almost like playing musical chairs, I mean, Hungary\u2019s a very\nsmall country and you don\u2019t have that many politicians, aristocrats to go around, but almost\nthe same faces somehow appeared, if not as prime minister then maybe minister of interior,\nor something. So we really, up until 1944, we had a great deal of anti-Semitism, we had a\ngreat deal of persecution of Jews but we were not in fear of our lives. Because somehow that\nwas below the dignity of that class. Not only that, some of those aristocrats were very\nAnglophiles and had, during the war, connections with the British. And so in between, it\ndepended on which aristocrat was in charge of the country. Some of them were a little bit\nmore German-oriented than others. And when, and more German-oriented came into the\npicture because the Germans didn\u2019t like the one who was in office, then he ordered that so\nand so is going to go and serve in, these Jews will be taken to the labor battalion. My father\nwas in the labor battalion before he was taken to Yugoslavia but he was inside Hungary so\nwe could visit him, we could take food for him and eventually, when a new prime minister\ncame, he declared that anybody over let\u2019s say, forty-five can go home. So there was no fear\nof being killed just because you are, you\u2019re a Jew. Up until 1944, March, when the Germans\nmarched into Hungary.",
        "Q: So when your father was called to be taken away...",
        "A: To go, yeah, we knew where he was. I remember, he was not far from Budapest for awhile,\nfor a few month, and then almost every weekend we took food down, we talked to him, he\nwas released, we could walk around a little bit. And so it was not the same thing as taken\naway to a faraway country where we had no idea what would happen to him. Now, there,\nthere, then in 1942, he was taken away for, for good. For some reason, and I cannot really\nremember exactly what happened and why. We had, probably, a more radical prime\nminister who yielded to the Germans and let this contingent of Jewish labor battalions go\noutside the country and he was then taken to Yugoslavia. I remember, even then, they, they\nwere told which railroad station are they going to be going through in Budapest and they\nallowed them to be there I think half an hour or an hour where we had a visit with him so we\ncould talk over a few things. And that was the last I saw him, then, for a couple of years\nuntil he came back after the war.",
        "Q: And he, where did he go exactly?",
        "A: He went to, he was 1n a copper mine 1n Bor, B, O, R which 1s I think the nearest 1s NiS which\nis Serbia today, the Serb Republic in Yugoslavia. And he was there, he was always telling\nme about what was, what was interesting, the various people who guarded them. They had\nCroats, they had German, they was all SS, Croat, Croatian SS, German SS, Hungarian, not\nSS, but Hungarian, and I think that they had something, I\u2019ve forgot what, but anyway,\nvarious nationalities were guarding them and probably Bosnians. And he mentioned when\nhe came home, interestingly, he said, \u201cSon,\u201d he said, \u201cwe never, we never really worried too\nmuch about anyone else guarding us except the Croatians.\u201d He said, \u201cWe had never seen\nsuch beasts as the Croatian SS was.\u201d They called them UstaSas, you know. He was there\nand I think, I, this is probably much better written than in my memory, I think about one\nhundred fifty thousand were in this particular area where he was and what happened was\nwhen, when the Tito partisans were really pushing them back, The Germans decided to\nmarch them back toward Germany and in, in what is northern, what was northern\nYugoslavia at that time and previously back before 1918, was southern Hungary, they set up\nthese slaughterhouses, where those who survived the concentration camp were\nkilled and my father was in the last six thousand being marched and they were captured by\nTito\u2019s partisans. And then he was given a choice whether he could fight with the partisans,\nhe could work for the partisans, or they would allow him to go into an area that was already\nliberated and live there and they would supply him with enough food to survive until the war\nis over, they said. And he was a very strong man and very grateful that they saved his life\nand he volunteered to work. So he worked in a flour mill somewhere around and came\nhome with all kinds of documents and, and little medals that testified to the fact that he was a\ngood worker and did his share. And he was very proud of it, and when Stalin decided to\neradicate any of the memories attached to Tito, unfortunately we had to burn everything and\nwe had to throw away his medals because it was very dangerous to be in the possession of\nanything that connects you to Tito. People were hanged all the time without not much\nreason, let alone if they find something on you. So, he was very bitter about this, and this\nturned him against the Russians so in all his life he was very anti-Russian and very pro-\nYugoslavian. He would have been heartbroken to see what happened to Yugoslavia had he\nlived today.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s stop.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\nTape 2, Side A",
        "Q: I would like to ask, you were just describing your, your father\u2019s experience in Bor and I\nwonder if when he was taken away to Bor if that, you and your mother and your father were\nrecognizing that this was going to be the big one, as it were and if you can recall that\nseparation and what happened.",
        "A: Well, of course we were always afraid that he would not survive and we had no doubt that\nphysically he could survive but we were afraid that, that he would get killed. But an\ninteresting episode was that, [cough] excuse me, I asked him after the war, what, why did he\nsurvive if so many people died? And he had a little, just a short little anecdote, he said, \u201cSon,\nthere were two kinds of people in the concentration camp. We got a canteen of water every\nmorning. The one group drank the water immediately and the second group, such as myself,\ndrank half of the water during the day and we used the other half to wash ourselves.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cHalf a canteen of water would make you clean?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, but I felt like a human\nbeing, I was still caring about myself.\u201d And he said, \u201cAnd later on I understood a lot more\nabout this whole attitude that I\u2019m not going to lie down here and gulp down everything, I am,\neven though I am full of lice, I\u2019m still caring about myself.\u201d So that, basically, that was the\nattitude that saved, I\u2019m sure, that was who survived. And of course luck, because even with\nthis attitude somebody could have shot you if they didn\u2019t like your face or the way they\nmoved. Yes, we, my mother maintained of course like most wives that he\u2019s going to return,\nand she was right because even though we have not heard from him for a long time,\nespecially the last year when he was there, of course by that time, we couldn\u2019t have heard\nfrom him because he was already in the liberated area and we were in Hungary still, in the\nbattlefield. It was, however, just that, that deep feeling that he will come home. And he\ncame home in 1945, I remember late spring, it must have been April, May, probably, and he\ndid not just stop by and said, \u201cHere I am.\u201d He was afraid that maybe we would faint or\nsomething like that. He sent a friend up. A man came up and inquired about my father and\nvery slowly kind of asked, \u201cWhen did you hear from him?\u201d and all this, and \u201cDo you think\nhe\u2019s alive?\u201d and all this, and slowly he said, \u201cWell, I have a feeling that he is alive,\u201d and\nslowly he led us to this. I remember him coming up on the stairs with a rucksack. The\nrucksack was full of sausage and potatoes. And he knew that we were starving and so that\nwas it. Now, just to describe the situation in Hungary at that time and how you needed to be,\nto stay a human being, the, we did not live in our apartment, we were moved, because you\ncould not stay in your apartment. You had to move to first, to so-called Jewish houses that\nhad a big star on them and, eventually to the ghetto. And because of the history of this\nhouse, we did not move into the ghetto but this house Zichy street One, was designated as a\nJewish house first. So, in the meantime, we moved out of, of our apartment in, that was\n1944, summer when you had to leave your apartment. We, the neighbors came, some of\nthem, and said \u201cWe will keep this for you, and keep this for you,\u201d and needless to say, that\nnot one thing eventually survived again. Or resurfaced again. They all, either the Russians\ntook it, or the bombing or everything. It\u2019s all disappeared, and what could you do about it?\nYou said okay. But people were in a way like vultures, they were just circling around and\nsee, you know, what they can take. And then the apartment was given, all these Jewish\napartments were given to bomb those people whose... Gentiles whose houses were bombed\nand they couldn\u2019t live in anymore. And I had no idea of course what happened to our\napartment. We lived in a street called Rottenbiller Street, 66\u00b0, and I, my first thing, we were\nliberated on January 18 and the first thing I went back to see, what, what happened to our\napartment because we left, believe it or not, a few boxes of linen there, just when we left.\nWe just, we couldn\u2019t do anything with it, so. And when I came, when I went up there, I had\nthis tremendous chip on my shoulder that I\u2019m going to show these people whoever are there,\nthat within two hours, I said I\u2019m going to give them two hours to get out of here. And here I\nwas a sixteen year old kid, barely sixteen, fifteen really, and telling them, here was a family\nand I was telling them to get out of here. And the family consisted of a mother, father, a\ndaughter and two sons. And they were tailors. And the old man was quite old, the father,\nwas telling me, he said, \u201cBut, but, where can we go?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy did you come\nhere?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, we have, we have no place. Our, our house was destroyed, and I\nmean we knew that this 1s, this was a Jewish apartment, but still 1t was between this or living\nin the street, in the cold snowy January,\u201d so he said, \u201cCould, could you do something, could,\ncould we somehow come to some kind of an agreement?\u201d And so my mother came up and\nshe said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just divide the place between us?\u201d And here it was a two room\napartment with their family, four people, five people in their families and two, my mother\nand I, and we decided that after looking at them and listening to them and all this, there was\njust something that all of a sudden hit me. My chip was gone and so we decided that yes, we\nwere going to, we'll, we\u2019ll make it. And so we lived there under the same roof and we\nbecame very good friends. And when my father came home in late spring, the new\ngovernment, Democratic government, devised this plan of each block had to elect a kind of a\nsmall council and the head of that council was quite powerful in deciding if there was an\nempty apartment or, almost like a Justice of Peace. They had certain tasks that they can\nperform, temporarily, they were deputized. And my father was appointed to do this because\nhe was always very much respected by the people there and the fact that he was now good,\nyou know, with the new regime. And next to us, an apartment was full of old, old women\nwho died one after another. It was a, like a Salvation Army place. They, they rented it and it\nbecame empty, so my father got the apartment for them and they moved over there so we\ncould get our apartment back, we lived there, but they could never really thank enough and\nwe, we kept this relationship for a long time and I\u2019m sorry I lost contact with them. But\nthen, we had an apartment and then we faced something else because then the Russians were\ncoming around and trying to find places for their soldiers and so they, they got, they got two\nold Russian soldiers from Siberia who were quartered in, in our apartment because two\nrooms were too many for three people. So, and I remember, they were very cute old men,\nwe had no, I mean we had sign language, we didn\u2019t speak Russian and the only incident I\nremember is that my mother, of all these sufferings, had one little symbol 1n her possession:\na bottle of very expensive cologne water that she kept. And she said, \u201cI am going to start\nusing this after the war, when we are all together and we live in peace.\u201d And so, and she\nkept it and she had it with her all the time. And so now, when we moved back, she, we got a\ntemporarily, kind of an armoir and she put it way back between sheets. Now one day we\n* When Robert lived there, the street number was 39. It was later changed to 66.\ncame home and my mother said, \u201cThis, this place smells like cologne water, very good\ncologne water,\u201d and she rushed to her cologne water in the armoir but these two Siberians,\nRussians were very hard pressed to get alcohol, anything, they would drink. I mean, there\nwere stories that I can\u2019t believe, that they went to the museum and drank alcohol out of these\nscientific lab experiments and\u2014including embryos\u2014but I never believed those stories, but\nthis is true. They drank my mother\u2019s cologne water. They were so, so hard pressed for\nalcohol. And that was about our only experience with Russians in our house. Otherwise,\nmost people lost their watches. They were very hard pressed for watches. It was a time\nwhen nobody in his right mind would walk around in Budapest with a watch on his wrist.\nThey just, they were fascinated. They stop you and they took your watch. That was their,\ntheir, their thing. Well, anyway, okay, ask.",
        "Q: So the Russians had moved into your apartment then. . .",
        "A: Yeah, two.",
        "Q: During the German occupation, this was before. . .",
        "A: No, no, no. This was during the Russian occupation.",
        "Q: Oh, after. [talkover]",
        "A: Oh yes. I\u2019m talking about after, this all happened after. Oh no, there were no Russians\nduring the German occupation. I wish there were. No.",
        "Q: I wanted to go back just a little...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: ...bit, I had, I had wanted to ask you about when you were younger as a child and you were\nin school, were your friends mostly Jewish...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Or did you share .. .",
        "A: Yes. Mostly Jewish. There were a few Gentile friends who never, ever mentioned religion,\nnever really made us feel inferior, just a few. And after the war, I made it clear how much I\nappreciated it. So, I\u2019m glad that I could do that. Now, I also have to say that not many of\nmy classmates survived because my Jewish classmates were in a labor battalion and they\nwere working outside Budapest on the day when the deportations came to that village. And\nthe gendarmerie had an empty boxcart and they decided not to let them go home but deport\nthem. So very few Jewish classmates of mine survived. Gentiles, again, the war, the army\neventually, everybody who was fifteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen at the end of the war, the\nlast few months, the Arrow Cross people, they forced children out into the street with a gun.\nSo quite a few of them did not survive. I really had very few contact with, with, with the\nfew that survived but there weren\u2019t too many.",
        "Q: And you had mentioned that your father\u2019s employer was helping you and your mother out.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Yes. And my father was very grateful to him and worked for him again after the\nwat.",
        "Q: And so the help that he gave you then during the time that your father was away was enough\nfor you and your mother to... [talkover]",
        "A: Yes. I also took a job. I was a messenger boy up until 19... until the yellow star came into\nexistence... \"44 March. I was a messenger boy for architectural firm. Because of the\nbicycle. I could bicycle around then, so I was delivering messages and things. So, that\nsupplemented also, my father\u2019s salary which wasn\u2019t a full salary, just part of it.",
        "Q: And as the war progressed, was the next significant event then, would have been the German\noccupation?",
        "A: Yes. 1944, March, if I remember it, 19, is when the Germans had serious doubts\napparently, that Hungary is not a trusted ally anymore, that Hungary probably entertains the\nidea of getting out of the war because by that time I think Romania was ready to jump and\nthe situation in Italy was very shaky so they decided to occupy Hungary officially and put in\na very right-wing government which was still a lot better than what came in 1944, October.\nThat will be the other stage. But let\u2019s take a look at what happened when the Germans\nmarched in, the yellow star had to be worn within a few weeks, or... So, the labor battalions\nwere more intensified. Now everybody who was eighteen had to go, that was now, they\nlowered the limit and the deportations started. So, unfortunately, that was the worst thing,\nthe deportations. They started in the countryside, eventually coming to Budapest. They\nwere supposed to come to Budapest, you know, by the fall.",
        "Q: You mentioned that your friends were deported one day.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you manage to avoid being deported yourself?",
        "A: That was just an, a coincidence, that my aunt, the one who gained this special status, said to\nme, \u201cPlease, I just have some very bad feelings, I don\u2019t want you to go today out and work.\nStay home, stay with me.\u201d She took me to her apartment and that was the day when it\nhappened. It was just a, just a miraculous instinct that she had. And that is what saved me.",
        "Q: Did life take a turn after that, after the German occupation did you feel, were you able to\nfeed yourself and your mother adequately?",
        "A: Well, what I did was, I gathered, I was always quite street smart and so I somehow found\nthat the best way to do this whole thing is first to get some papers that would qualify us\u2014at\nleast to those who don\u2019t know us\u2014as Christians. So I took my mother\u2019s jewellries, sold it,\nand bought papers. And the papers were blank and you had to fill it out. And I did that.\nAlso, I got some papers and I fill it out with the same name from a cousin of mine who was\nadopted but had birth certificate and everything else that pertained to the fact that he was a\nGentile. And his parents gave me his papers too so I had kind of this double insurance,\nmoving around, in case I needed it. For a while, I did not use these papers. I waited until,\nyou know, we got the point where it was necessary. Also, there was a danger that until the\nRussian troops did not cross the Hungarian border, it was a matter of a telephone call to find\nout if you had false birth certificates. All they had to do 1s call the principality, you know,\nand that, that municipality and check, okay? And so, actually, we waited until practically the\nfirst village fell and, after that, it was much easier to fill it out, to a town or a village that had,\nthat was already occupied under occu... Soviet occupation because they couldn\u2019t check\nanymore.",
        "Q: And after that point, did you use those papers?",
        "A: Then, then, then we used the papers for awhile, but it was a, it was very confusing period\nwhen we were moving a lot. First, my wife, my mother and I moved to the, the apartment of\none of my father\u2019s friends. They were Seventh-Day Adventists. And they offered their\nplace but soon they learned that Seventh-Day Adventists are just in the same danger as Jews\nso after consultation, we left. Then we were, we went to a, I was always on the street,\nhearing, feeling, looking, what can happen? Then I took my mother to a Jewish high school\nwhich was designated as a clothing supply business for the Hungarian army and it was really\na refuge for, for Jews. They were sewing uniforms for the army and it was established by\nold Hungarian Jewish army officers who wanted to save their skin and their family and hired\nfake guards in uniform to come in and out of the place, putting on a show and inside they\nwere actually really making, sewing uniforms and delivering it to the army and, and, so I was\nalways, it was just constantly you had to change your position and you had to always look at\nwhat seems safe at the moment. And it is possible that something that was safe one week\nbecame unsafe the next week because somebody recognized one person in that place when\nhe was walking down the street, going into places, \u201cHere is a Jew, doesn\u2019t wear a yellow\nstar, what is he doing?\u201d And so, your life depended on nuances, those days.",
        "Q: So you just took off the yellow star?",
        "A: My aunt is the one who just ripped off the yellow star and said, \u201cYou stay with me,\u201d and\nthen my mother came there, too. And this is how we got to this house in Zichy Jeno Street,\nOne, in the Fifth District of Budapest.",
        "Q: Now, I think before you even moved into that house, there had been a lot of Allied bombings",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Had there not? Of Budapest?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So where were you during that time?",
        "A: Well, we, whenever there was a, up until we had to leave our own apartment, when there\nwas a bombing we lived in the cellar, you know, sometimes for hours. But usually, the\nbombings came at night, so, I, one thing that war taught me how to be very organized\nbecause there was no light. You couldn\u2019t turn on the light. No, that was a major offense. If\nthey saw any light, when the sirens went off, they, they considered you collaborating with\nthe, with the enemy, you know, giving signals. So, I had to lay out all my stuff and in the\ndarkness I could pick every one of my clothes and still do, to run down. We had seconds to\nrun down in the bombing, started. Usually, there was no really intense bombing of\nBudapest. Most of the bombers, many times, Americans, were flying over to Romania, to\nPloesti, to bomb the oil fields. There was really not much to bomb in Budapest, was not very\nbadly bombed. Budapest was, Budapest was mainly destroyed during that siege from\nDecember until January 18. That was the main reason for the destruction. But before that,\nthere was not that much.",
        "Q: So, when was it that you moved in with your aunt?",
        "A: It was late fall, in 1944, you know. Late fall that... when we felt that that place was the best\nplace to be. And then it turned out to be a very fortunate choice because in that house, there\nwas a famous Hungarian psychiatrist. Psychiatry was, in Hungary, at the very, very early\nstage. This man became very famous and since there weren\u2019t too many, a great deal of his\nclientele were famous politicians, actors, actresses, writers. So he was well-known all over\nthe place and he had this idea that he is going to save his family and friends by number one,\ncontacting a fascist officer and I\u2019ve no idea how he did it, who wants to save his skin and is\nwilling to play this game of declaring the house a clinic and, and do everything possible to\nsave the people inside the house and then he found this man and his name was Jereczian Ara\nGeorge. And this is in reverse order because Hungarian names are in reverse order. The last\nname is what we consider first so in English you would say George Ara Jereczian. The, I\nremember him, a very handsome man, a very, kind of a man of stature and a fascist uniform,\nhand grenades hanging from his belt. I mean, he was intimidating to anyone. To, with us, he\nwas very kind. The, I suppose, looking back that we about three hundred doctors and\nfamilies in that apartment house jammed, absolutely jammed. While we could still live\nupstairs, probably there were at least five to ten people to a room. When we lived in the\nbasement, no one is to tell, we were just side by side on mattresses because when the siege of\nBudapest started, you couldn\u2019t live upstairs anymore. So this man moved in with a few of\nhis men who apparently were loyal to him and his girlfriend and they set up their\nheadquarters there and they were practically like a, a, a support group. The clinic had its\nofficial emblem there and the whole operation looked like it was a legal operation to save\nanybody who 1s injured. \u2018Kay? Now, we\u2019re at the end?",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t we pause here? I\u2019d like to ask you some more .. .",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\nTape 2, Side B",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019re on tape two, side B of an interview with Mr. Robert Holczer. And if we can\njust go back a little bit and I\u2019d like to know something about during the, you mentioned that\nyou stopped going to school at a certain point and I wanted to hear about what you did with\nyour days at that time. When was that exactly?",
        "A: It was, it was in 1944, [coughs] excuse me. After I finished what would be eighth grade\nhere, it was the fourth grade of middle school and I was supposed to then go to what they\ncall gymnasium, which is high school in Europe. I could not get into a high school and so it\nwas not a long period but between 1944, I have to figure this out. Let\u2019s see, 1925, 40, right.\nSo there was a year, \u201943 because I was, I left the school, \u201943 so I had one year when actually\nI didn\u2019t do much except odd jobs. My father was away, so, as I mentioned before I\ndelivered, worked for an architectural firm and delivered blueprints, whatever I can find but I\ncould not get into high school. The higher four grades of high school, the gymnasium. And\nso my mother suggested that we hire a tutor so by the time I would be available for high\nschool, I wouldn\u2019t miss much. And this is why I had a private tutor. I was studying\nespecially Latin because everybody suggested that that would probably create a problem\nwhen all of a sudden I, war would be over\u2014we were always optimists\u2014and I could go to,\ninstead of the first form to the second form and Latin would create the biggest problem. So\nfor Latin and Algebra, I had a tutor, somebody in, in my mother\u2019s distant family, who lived\nin Budapest. And this is how the year went by. There was really not much else, a little work\nand a little study.",
        "Q: At that time, was, were you and your mother aware of the so-called Final Solution and what\nwas happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe?",
        "A: Yes. My mother somehow, well, first of all the BBC, of course, unfortunately told us what\nhappened to the Jews who were taken away to concentration camps and death camps but by\nthe that time it was well known in Hungary too, what the deportations, how the deportations\nend up. So my mother was extremely upset, for understandable reasons and I really had to\nkind of keep her spirit up and, constantly reminding her that there are certain things we can\u2019t\nchange and she still has to live for her own little immediate family. But yes, we were very\nmuch aware, very much aware. And even though it was very, very difficult to get BBC and\nup until 1944, March, or April when the radios had to be turned in, we could still get BBC.\nAnd I learned from my father, I was six years old when I learned from my father that there is\nmore to news than just the Hungarian papers and the Hungarian radio. He would close the\nshutters at certain times, he always changed the times, of course, he would lock the doors\nand he would listen to BBC. At a very early age and would tell me that this is the truth.\nEventually, it became very dangerous because the Germans would have a device that was on\ntop of a car, similar probably to what radar is today, that would circle and try to find people\nwho listened to foreign broadcasts. And it was punishable also by going to concentration\ncamp.",
        "Q: And yet, despite your awareness of what was happening elsewhere in Europe, you and your\nmother remained, or at least your mother remained optimistic enough to find you a tutor and\nto...",
        "A: Yes. Yes. [talkover] Well, I think this is in the Jewish nature, if you consider the fact that\npeople in boxcars going to Auschwitz were still running schools, right? It\u2019s just that, this\npart of the, of the optimism and the fact that you have to learn, learn and learn. That was\nwith us. That kind of a feeling never left us and we never really gave up.",
        "Q: Was your tutor Jewish?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. She was. And she was just a distant cousin of my, my mother and she, I\neventually met her when I was in Israel, again. She emigrated to Israel.",
        "Q: And, were, well let\u2019s just go forth to the, okay, let\u2019s go back to your, your home with your\naunt that you had moved into several months after the German occupation and you had\nbegun to describe to me this house, and the man who had been a member of Arrow Cross\nwho had established it as a clinic. And as, as it was established as a clinic, did the same\npeople who had been living in it before, did some of them move out or have to leave or just\nmore people came?",
        "A: No, those who were in the house, they were allowed to stay, which is obvious, I mean,\nanybody who would have been tossed out would have had to go to the ghetto. And it was, to\nmost people, it was clear that eventually the ghetto 1s going to be annihilated. There was no\nother way, since Budapest was surrounded by then by the Soviet forces, what else can you\ndo with it? They built a huge wooden wall around the ghetto and, according to the rumors,\nthey would just detonate the whole thing or burn it down or, but they would not let the Jews\nsurvive if the siege had lasted another week or so. The lucky thing is that they just ran out of\ntime. I, of course I was never in the ghetto, but no, those who were in the house, they could\nstay, and a lot of other families moved in, practically all of them connected to famous\nHungarian doctors.",
        "Q: Before the house was established as a clinic...",
        "A: It was a Jewish house.",
        "Q: It was a Jewish house...",
        "A: Yes. It was a Jewish house. It had, it was a designated Jewish house.",
        "Q: And who was living in your aunt\u2019s apartment with you?",
        "A: Well, about at least ten other members of our family. Some other aunts and brothers of my\nfather, my mother, of course, and I. I say, and it was a, about one and a half room apartment\nand there were plenty of people in it. But that was the, the least of our problems, really, you\nknow. We could, we could sleep very well. There were a lot worse arrangements in\nBudapest at that time. There were, there were people in Swedish-protected houses in, near\nthe Danube, where, I understand, people couldn\u2019t even sleep. They just were, you know,\npractically back to back in a room, there were so many people jammed in. This is the one\nthat Wallen... what was his name, the Swedish diplomat, Wallenberg, the one, that was his\nlittle area, Raoul Wallenberg. But I never, I went a couple of times by, but I never went up\nbut I noticed that there just, there were just lots of lots of people.",
        "Q: And then this house, before it was established as a clinic, were there non-Jews living as\nwell?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. And interestingly, I can remember that a couple of non-Jewish families stayed\nthere. They just stayed there. By that time, perhaps what went through their mind is, that,\nsince the war inevitably is coming to an end, it\u2019s not a bad idea to be here when the Soviet\ntroops come. So that must have been their reasoning. And it was not, not impractical,\nactually. At the same time, even in the last week, we were in danger of being taken to the\nDanube, that was the, the most common way of getting rid of Jews who were discovered\noutside the ghetto, marched down and shot into the river. It was a cold, bitter, snowy winter\nand the Danube was red and full of corpses. But I remember that even the last week,\nsomebody from the neighborhood reported us to the fascist authorities and they came and\ntried to disarm Jereczian Ara George\u2019s own people in the house, the bodyguards. And he\nseemed, he almost seemed helpless. We were already lined up and then he again arrived\nthere, amazingly, he did this more than once, with some paper from a very special higher\nauthority that said, \u201cClear out of here. This is a protected territory and we do our job for the\ngovernment and leave us alone.\u201d We confronted the man after the war. I know that. He was\ncaught, the one who reported us because he was stupid enough to show up the last week\nbefore Budapest was, Pest was occupied, and pointed fingers. I also remember another man\nwho was a fascist officer that lived a couple of houses across from us who was also quite\nantagonistic toward us and we were worried about him. And also the last week, they brought\nhim in with a head injury. He was shot in the head in the street fighting. There was\ntremendous street fighting and he was just left there to die. And I don\u2019t know, I was just\nfascinated by, by this man that, that everybody was always afraid of and here he was,\nbasically a nothing anymore, you know. And in spite of my good judgement, I watched him,\nkept going back to him, as a young man all night, watch him how he was dying. And I can\u2019t,\nI still cannot explain this fascination, because ever since I couldn\u2019t look at another human\nbeing, even an animal that is dying. But somehow, there was a mixed feeling in me of\nrevenge and satisfaction that this scum 1s, is not going to be here any longer and I wanted to\nsee how he was going. And my mother, I remember scolded me for this and constantly was\ntaking me back to our place, where we, our sleeping arrangement was. But, there, there were\nincidents like this and it was a very, very strange period for a fifteen-year-old boy. My job\nwas basically to take legs and arms up that were cut off, operated on in the so-called\noperating room which was a, a dark part of the basement and kind of arrange them on the, in\nthe courtyard. And when in, when in January 18\", we went up, upstairs, everybody was\nhorrified. There were huge piles of limbs just piled up on the courtyard. And most of it, I\nhad to pile up because I was the one who was always sent up with these. The doctors\noperated without any anesthesis [sic], anything. There were, there were, there was nothing\nand it, of course, the survival ratio probably was minimal, you know. But that, whenever I\nlook into that house, that always comes to my mind, how these houses survive. We die but\nthey keep their secrets.",
        "Q: Had any of the other people who were living in your aunt\u2019s apartment, did they have papers,\nfalse papers?",
        "A: I have a feeling that most of them did because my father\u2019s brothers wore the uniform of a\nmilitary police and again, because of their, their origin from this working, workers\u2019\nneighborhood, they got papers and they got uniforms. They were supplied with everything,\nboth of them. So.",
        "Q: Were you using your papers at the time?",
        "A: I was, only when, when on the street, they stopped me and asked for papers. That was the\nonly time I used mine. And, by the last, I would say the last few weeks it didn\u2019t mean\nanything if they stopped a man because they didn\u2019t even ask for papers. They asked for you\nto drop your pants. And since in Europe, only Jews are circumcised, it was very easy to\ndetect who was a Jew. And I have to thank, I mean my life was really saved by a man who,\namazingly appeared at the trme when I thought that this was my last moment on earth. I was\nsent out to get something, I think, if I remember correctly, I was sent out because a horse fell\non the street from shrapnels and we needed some meat. And the only kind of meat,\nwhenever we had meat, the only meat that we could get was horsemeat. And of fallen\nhorses, horses that were shot on the street, usually by airplanes. Airplanes flew very low and\nthey were just machine-gunning anything that moved. And I always ran out and I also\ncrawled out to get water. There were certain areas where a faucet was still intact and you\ncould get some water. And a patrol came and caught me and they said, \u201cOkay, here, come,\ncome into the doorway of this house,\u201d and they were shouting, yelling, \u201cThis looks like a\nJew and took off your pants, take off your pants,\u201d and they give me the order and I was kind\nof snow-white probably and shaking and all of a sudden another man with a much higher\nrank came and said to the guys, \u201cLook, I see four, five Jews on that corner. Go immediately,\nsee, catch those, I take care of this idiot here. And so we went under the doorway and I was\nunbuttoning my pants and kind of shaking and he said, \u201cListen,\u201d he said, \u201care you crazy?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where you come from, do you have a place where you were staying?\u201d\nI said yes. He said, he said, \u201cGo back and I don\u2019t ever want to see you again on the street.\u201d\nAnd we came out and he was hitting me and beating me and just and he said to these people,\n\u201cThis idiot, he\u2019s not a Jew,\u201d he said, \u201che\u2019s an idiot, a young idiotic kid who wants to be a\nhero apparently. Go back to your mother and don\u2019t ever leave the house.\u201d And I told my\nmother this story and of course, she never let me, the last week she never let me leave the\nplace, under no circumstances. And interestingly, about four, five weeks after we were\nliberated, I went to the UNRRA, the UNRRA was the U, N, R, R, A, that was the, the joint\ncommittee of the Jewish Relief and you could go there and you could get some emergency\nsupplies, food supplies, they were bringing them in. And who was at the door letting people\nin? I recognized this man. And I walked up to him, he had a huge, a big flag emblem on his\nlapel, the flag of what today is Israel, at that time it was a Zionist emblem. And I said to\nhim, I said, \u201cHey, you know, you saved my life?\u201d And he looked at me, he said, \u201cYou too?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cThere were many more.\u201d And turned\u2014he didn\u2019t really want me to elaborate or\nnothing. And there were many people like this. Now who they were, I was very curious and\nI went to find out and most of the people who were doing this were Polish Jews because a lot\nof them had very fair complexions. They were blond and blue-eyed and so, and they came\nto Hungary early, 1939 or so, and in four, five years, they learned enough Hungarian, and\ngood Hungarian so they had very little accent and they could pass as, there were other people\nin the Arrow Cross movement who had accents, so quite a few of them were in the Arrow\nCross movement. And in the Zionist Underground so, that was a lucky, a lucky accident for\nme.",
        "Q: How did you get food during that time?",
        "A: During the siege? Well, during the siege. . .",
        "Q: Well, I\u2019m sorry, not only during the siege but during the time of the establishment of the\nclinic.",
        "A: Oh, well they, they did it, the, the man I told you who saved us, he had good source of\nsupply. So, there was always a center of supply. The only thing that we could not get was of\ncourse, what did we get, flour and beans. These were the two and soya. People made, there\nwas incredible things out of soyabeans. I have great respect for soyabeans. They made\nsausage, they made, you name it, and it all tasted like real sausage or soyabread was\nmarvelous. And they made bread of rice and just invented all kinds of things that they had\nnever eaten before. But the, the big thing was meat. Everybody wanted to have meat so we\nalways watched out, looked out for horses, horses. And you should have seen, when a horse\nfell on the street, ah, everybody was running with huge knives and carving it out and running\nback into the basement because . . .",
        "Q: People wearing the stars at that time? [talkover]",
        "A: No, nobody in, nobody, nobody in this house wore stars. Okay? Nobody, that was a taboo.\nNo. And that was his order. \u2018Kay? We were exempt, because a lot of things that he told us,\nit was not true, 1t was just to boost our confidence but by that time there was such confusion\neverywhere, in higher government places that who, who knows what was really the truth and\nwhat was not? Only he can.",
        "Q: So he would distribute the food and then everybody would take it back to their apartments...",
        "A: No, no. We did, we had pretty good organization. No, he was the one who secured the food\nby, you know, sending a contingent of people to, to get it and then we brought it back and\nthen we, we divided it. He had his little place there and he was just, these are all intelligent\npeople and very disciplined people. He did not have to go down personally and do anything,\nreally. All we needed him for is to, to, to help us survive, to, to protect us from the outside\nworld. But inside, we organized everything ourselves.",
        "Q: Was everybody who lived in the building in some way involved [talkover]",
        "A: Some way, yes. Yes. They had to. They had to, they did something. Okay, at least, if\nnothing else on paper. My mother was a nurse, for example.",
        "Q: And your only job was to take these limbs?",
        "A: Well, I was, what they called, I was a messenger, you know, I was an errand boy. I was\nfifteen, and so, that was, I had a little uniform and a gray overall with a, kind of a military\ncap. But I was in charge of taking the, the severed things up.",
        "Q: Did you have any friends in the building?",
        "A: I, did I have, yes, I had a friend. And it was the first time in my life that I really felt a sexual\nattraction toward a woman. And I was kind of a cute little kid and she was a lot older than I.\nAnd I think under different circumstances, probably, we would have been much cozier but it\nwas, there were too many people around. I liked her. She was a, believe it or not, there was\na, among other things, there was a famous Hungarian Jewish comedian who also ended up in\nour, in our place. Alphonso. And this was the other half of his act, a young woman. And\nwe became good friends and I had all kinds of fantasies about her and maybe she, too, about\nme. But my mother was around and too many people and so our attraction never really came\nto anything else, but just that. But we spent a lot of time together and, and, and it was just a\nnice puppy love, I think, that I\u2019ve had for the first time in my life with an older, somebody\nwas at that time older, not too old. I think she was in her early twenties or so, but I was just\nfifteen. And the, I also had a strange relationship with an Italian girl. The Italian\ngovernment of Badoglio (ph), that was his name, his Air Force chief I think, or Air Force\nminister had a Hungarian Jewish wife and when things got very hot in Italy, he brought her\nback to Hungary because he felt that in Hungary she has a better chance of survival, being\nthe wife of the famous Italian Air Force general. In Italy, everybody knew that she was\nJewish and they were afraid of deportation. So, and he had a daughter, and somehow I had a\nlot of friends in the Italian school in Budapest, the Italian embassy maintained a school. And\nI fell in love with this girl. And the stupid thing, the reason this ties in with this story, the\nstupid I did was, during the terrible, during those terrible days of siege, whenever I had some\nfood like horsemeat or something, I would walk, they lived about a half an hour from our\nhouse and I would walk on the street, of course walk, try to run from one block to another,\nvery close to the walls to deliver food to this girl and to her mother. And, and I felt that this\nwas my obligation and it was a stupid thing to do.\nEnd of tape 2, Side B\nTape 3, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape three, side A of an interview with Mr. Robert Holczer. Am I pronouncing your\nname correctly?",
        "A: Holczer.",
        "Q: Holczer. Holczer. I\u2019m interested in hearing, you were just describing some of your\nfriendships to me and I\u2019m interested in hearing what you did for entertainment, how you, if\nyou managed to find any games to play or ways to have fun?",
        "A: Well, if I remember correctly, we did not play any games because the day went by with\nconstantly watching out to survive. We watched the streets, we listened to the radio. I\nremember that I was terribly concerned with the expression of adults around me, I watched\ntheir faces. I always suspected that they know more than what they would tell me and\nsomehow, in the last few weeks, I just became obsessed with, with this business of survival.\nI couldn\u2019t think of anything else and my uncle, who is, the one who is still alive, reminded\nme that my constant question to him was, practically hourly, \u201cHow long will this last? How\nlong will this last?\u201d This was my constant question. I was just counting the hours. We knew\nthat the, that the streetfighting between the Germans and the Russians cannot be more than a\ncouple of city blocks away. We saw German soldiers, insured, moving down the street and\nwe heard, practically, the gunfire as if it were next to us. Some people came in injured who\nreported that just a couple of blocks from us there were already Russian soldiers so it was\nthat, that, that tension that kept me from doing anything else except just waiting for that final\nonslaught when I can see that our area is liberated. There was just no mood for playing. We\nwere not children. None of us were children. We were, all our conversations, I remember,\nwith the, with the kids of my age down there, all, everything was always revolving around\nsurvival.",
        "Q: So even before the, the actual siege you didn\u2019t have?",
        "A: No, before the actual siege, yes, I, 1 still contacted sometimes my old Boy Scout comrades,\nthey were the ones that I kept up with. But once of course, the siege started then, there was\nno chance to, to go out and do anything like that.",
        "Q: So some of your, your Boy Scout comrades had escaped the deportation?",
        "A: Oh yes, well, remember these were not school, these were not school people, I told you that.\nNo, these are all from various, the Boy Scout group, the membership consisted of people\nfrom anywhere in Budapest and for various areas and quite a few of them survived. So, even\nafter the war, of course, we met for awhile and then we decided there is nothing in it for us\nanymore and that\u2019s when I joined the Zionist Movement. That gave me a lot more important\ngoals than the Boy Scouts.",
        "Q: The, the Boy Scouts, your friends from the Boy Scouts weren\u2019t in the ghetto then.",
        "A: No. Some of them did go in, you know, some of them did go in. But others weren\u2019t. And\nSO Wwe communicated and visited with a couple of, who were outside.",
        "Q: You would go to each other\u2019s home?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Strictly, you know, strictly so. We didn\u2019t want any conversation, any, any public\nplace that can be overheard. Because our main concern was the kind of topic that others\nshouldn\u2019t hear.",
        "Q: Such as what?",
        "A: Well, where are the Russian forces? What did you hear? All this. What did the radio say?\nWe didn\u2019t have any radios, the Jews, right? But those who were hiding, and were perhaps\nwith a Christian family, they could still listen to BBC so that was the, the entire existence\nwas the war and the topics were just that.",
        "Q: Now the, the clinic, what, who were the people that the clinic would treat? Was it just\nanyone who would happen to be injured?",
        "A: Well, theoretically, we were supposed to treat fascist officials according to all the papers and\nthe, the permit that our leader, you know, had. But there was such chaos in the last few\nweeks, you know, when the siege of Budapest started, that we treated everybody who came\nin from the street who was injured. And it was pathetic, sometimes, that people would come\nin with some very minor problems and leave the clinic, and within minutes they were\nbrought back with, with practically their guts out. In other words, in order to reach us, they\nwent through such danger that they lost their lives, eventually. We had, we had no medicine\nleft, we had practically nothing. So we couldn\u2019t do much. Anybody, anybody was treated.\nAnd doctors are doctors. I was always interested in, especially when there was a fascist\nofficial, what did they do to him? Would they take advantage of the fact that here we are,\nyou know, lost all family members and all this, but I talked to, this interested me and I talked\nto some of the doctors and they said there\u2019s no such thing, a doctor cannot do that.",
        "Q: Did the clinic work with any of the other rescue organizations in any way?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t. By that time, there was no contact, nothing. Everybody\u2019s out for, for itself.\nThere was, there was just, everything collapsed. The streets were ruled by twelve year old\nchildren with submachine guns and disenfrised [sic], uneducated laborers who never\namounted to anything, and this was their way to get their revenge. They were shooting first,\ntruly and asking questions after. It was, it was the, a total reign of terror.",
        "Q: What about before the siege, siege?",
        "A: Before the siege, it was already leading up to this because they, as soon as the Arrow Cross\nmovement took over on October 15, the, they started. It was just as bad. And the minute the\nadmiral who was the head of Hungary, Admiral Horthy finished his speech in which he\nannounced that as far as he was concerned the war was lost, at that moment, you know, hell\nbroke loose. He was arrested, his bodyguards were arrested.",
        "Q: And you, as soon as that, that date, October 15, you just didn\u2019t go outside anymore?",
        "A: No, well, we, that was the date when the house, the story I told you began to get, take shape,\nokay? This was when we kind of put our heads together and we learned that this psychiatrist\nis taking steps to bring this man in and all this. We had to act very quickly because events\nwere really coming to an end. The Russians were approaching Budapest rapidly and we\nknew that again, that gives the, these guys very little time to kill all of us. And they were\ngetting more and more vicious, amazingly. Instead of saving their skin, they became even\nmore violent.",
        "Q: Okay, so, before the siege, and you were sometimes going out...",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: You would deliver messages?",
        "A: Right, right. I had, you know, the uniform and the ID and all this. I was sent to get our\nrations, you know, I was sent to pick up some papers or pick up medicine. Yeah, I was just a",
        "Q: But you had no contact with the Red Cross or with the different legations.",
        "A: Well, the, the Red, if I remember correctly, we had some, some very vague contact with the\nRed Cross, I probably picked up medicine from them or something for the, for the\norganization. But personally, I had no as a, as an individual, I had no contact other than with\nthe, just with the Swiss Embassy. I told you I had a Switz, Swiss schutzpass, that by the time\nthe Arrow Cross movement started, meant very little.",
        "Q: How did you, how did you get that schutzpdsse?",
        "A: Well, you could go to the Swedish Embassy or the Swiss Embassy and they would, put you\non the list and eventually would give it to you. And it was really just a, kind of a, a\nsmokescreen. There was not much, if you were lucky, they respected it and they let you go.\nIf you were unlucky, they just tore it apart and said, \u201cStep into the wagon,\u201d you know, and\nyou were gone. You could never, never know. It, those embassies issued this in good faith\nbut the people who looked at it, you were at the mercy of those. And I just happened to go\nto the Swiss one, but the Swedish did it and then probably you heard the story, the Japanese,\nit was a Japanese in, in, not in Hungary, I think it was in Lithuania or somewhere, did the\nsame thing.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So, in Hungary, it was mainly the Swedish and the, and the Swiss and I think the Vatican\ntoo. There was some, even though that the Primate of Hungary was almost like a\ncollaborator. He did not really act very courageously under the Nazi era.",
        "Q: Do you remember when the siege began?",
        "A: Yes. It was in December, if I know, December 20\" or something, very close to Christmas.\nThat\u2019s when it... really, it just, all of a sudden we were shot at from every direction. We\nknew that Budapest was totally surrounded. The airplanes were just coming day and night.\nThey were called ratas, R, A, T, A, these small Soviet airplanes machine-gunning anything\non the street that moved. It was very dangerous to get out on the street. And of course, then,\nwhen it came to night, anybody was moving could have been also shot by the fascists, by the\nArrow Cross people, \u2018cause they were also moving. And it, it was a lot of noise, a lot of\ninjuries, a smell of, of the stench of, of gunpowder and, and corpses came closer, you know?\nWar has a certain smell, a very very unpleasant smell that you can really honestly feel. And\nas a child, I learned that. That\u2019s, that\u2019s all I can tell you, but...",
        "Q: Now, so the entire building then moved down into the basement?",
        "A: Yes, the entire Budapest lived in basements. Some of the newer houses\u2019 basements were\nclean, perhaps dry, you know. And you could make it with a little effort to become\ntemporary living quarters. But those built in the 19\" century, they were damp, dark, they\nwere just awful. Cold. And luckily, that this house, this Zichy Jeno Street was a fairly, fairly\nnew house. And the basement was livable. Now where I lived, where I lived before, in most\nof my life, back, that basement was such that I, oh, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to spend any\ntime right there because it was a damp, old typical, what you see almost in Dickensian, you\nknow, movies or read about Dickensian novels. Also, there were rats, loved this kind of a\nmoist dark environment. But here, I remember our basement as quite civilized in, in this\nhouse. So it was, the hardship was not really bad and so many people, the heat, I think, of\nthe bodies made up for the cold outside.",
        "Q: How many people were there?",
        "A: Oh, I would say we were a few hundred people in that basement, yeah?",
        "Q: How big was the basement?",
        "A: Oh, it, it would be like a floor, an entire floor of the house, because it was, usually the\nbasements were what you can consider a low floor. So, it\u2019s, I cannot really describe it in, in\nsquare footage because at that time I didn\u2019t even, I didn\u2019t even know about that, but it, 1t was\na good size apartment house floor, okay, just picture it. And there were mattresses down,\nand everybody brought the mattresses down, and there were people very closely situated\nand, was in a way, it was kind of a warm place.",
        "Q: Were there separate rooms?",
        "A: There were a few, but mainly the separate rooms were, were given to the doctors for\noperation, operating rooms and, and supply rooms and things like that. Most of the people\nlived in, in these big open areas.",
        "Q: So the treatments continued, then?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Up until the, practically the last minute. And then the liberation, January 18,\nis when we heard the emergency wall of our basement. We heard a knock and by law, there\nwas a, an emergency entrance to every one of these basements between two houses that\nconsisted only of one layer of bricks. So, and there had to be a pick next to it. So we heard\nthat a pick was working, breaking through. And then, must have been about four o\u2019clock,\nfive o\u2019clock in the morning and all of a sudden the furred hat half of a young Russian soldier,\nSoviet soldier, came through first and then the whole body. And this was first time, I think,\nthat he got a hug from people because, and he couldn\u2019t understand why, he was absolutely\nbewildered because, of course, the Soviet soldiers were not welcomed with great enthusiasm\nanywhere since most Hungarians were hoping for a German victory and we, we were just\nhugging and kissing him.",
        "Q: Before we go forward, you, so the treatments continued but so, somebody was actually was\ngoing out onto the streets during that time and...",
        "A: We were, yeah, bringing in people from just the vicinity, okay, very close vicinity. And\npeople would come in on their own too, you know, with a, with a shrapnel or something in\ntheir leg or a small injury.",
        "Q: And was somebody going out to get food?",
        "A: Well, we had beans. We, we, I remember that we practically had beans every day. Beans,\nbeans and beans. As long as you have beans, you can really survive. And water, yeah, water\nwas dripping but still, we could get at enough water to, for drinking. Nobody took a shower,\nthat\u2019s for sure. There was no way.",
        "Q: Was there a place to cook in the, in the basement?",
        "A: Yep. People had these little, you know, stoves. A lot of people had little stoves and they\nshared those, whole families. There was, amazingly, it was a very peaceful environment\nbecause we all, we only had one important thing in our mind, to get out of there, alive. And\npeople shared.",
        "Q: So everybody managed to get along [talkover]?",
        "A: Yes, nobody, there was no such thing as leaving somebody starving or leaving somebody\nwithout fuel, or, I remember that everybody was doing their best. And of course, there are\nsmall little skirmishes mainly a couple of old people who just didn\u2019t understand the situation\ncompletely, and had unreasonable demands or something and we had to step on their toes,\nand... But no basic, no, no big problems.",
        "Q: How many doctors would you say there were out of that...",
        "A: It\u2019s hard for me to look back but I would say we had at least thirty doctors there, at least.\nAnd we are talking about the cream of, of the Hungarian Jewish doctors, you know? Really,\nthey went out and famous professors from universities so this man, this Doctor V\u00e9lgyessi\u201d\nwho was the psychiatrist living in the house originally, he had a very large circle of friends,\nand so he managed to gather the ones that he could and brought them in. And there were\nmany other people, I don\u2019t know how they got there. I just read a few years ago that the\nchief architect of Budapest, the main architect of Budapest today, was with me in the\nbasement in this house. I... somebody sent me, I think, a newspaper article or while in\nvisiting in Budapest I saw it, he gave an interview about it. Because it was the fiftieth\nanniversary of the liberation of Budapest this year.",
        "Q: Was Jereczian still in, still with you at that point, at the point of the siege?",
        "A: Jereczian?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh he stayed, he stayed all the time, he stayed, he never left the place. Yeah. So, no, he was\nthere all the time. And if he had to leave for some reason, he made sure that he left enough\npeople there to, to protect us.",
        "Q: So he had made just a complete break from the Arrow Cross?",
        "A: Yes, apparently, apparently and why he even joined them and what was his job there, I don\u2019t\nknow. I don\u2019t know. Since I left in 1948, you know, and I think that probably it took a few\nyears to write about these things and clear up this thing and I was not there in these, from \u00b048\nto \u201950. And after I came back, you just didn\u2019t want to, those were the worst years of\nStalinism and you didn\u2019t want to get involved with anything because you didn\u2019t know what\nhe was doing at that time and so, no questions asked was the best policy. But, later on in the\nsixties and seventies, I heard that he was a concert impressario and that he took certain\nshows back to Budapest. And I even saw his name and I am, I really regret that I didn\u2019t go\n* First name: Ferencz\nto see him. I should have looked for him somehow and talked to him. So I feel so strongly\nabout this whole thing that if I knew today that he 1s still alive, living, I would probably go to\nVienna. That\u2019s where he lived and, and, and just thank him again. But I know that he\nreceived a great deal of recognition from people. But I know, I don\u2019t know exactly what, if\nhe\u2019s alive today. He was, I would say, about ten, at least ten, fifteen years older than I, so it\u2019s\nhard to say.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s go back to the, to the liberation. So there\u2019s a Russian soldier who broke through\nand you all embraced him and then, and then what did you do?",
        "A: What did I do after that? Well, I did what probably is a natural thing to do. I went with the\nRussian soldiers and whenever they broke into a store and they broke into every store that\nstill had anything, I went with them. And after they were through and took what they\nwanted to take, I took what I wanted to take. In other words, I did what we called zabralny\nwhich means to confiscate things. I was full of hate, I was full of frustration and I thought\nthis, this was the way to get even, probably. And, I had a little store at home, a kind of a\nlittle supply of all these stolen goods that I got from shops that were just there, most people\nwouldn\u2019t dare to go in with the Russians, but I put back my yellow star and I went with them\nand unless I bumped into some Ukrainians, who were famous anti-Semites and beat the hell\nout of you, the, the others, they, they were welcoming you. They said go ahead. Also, we\nhad a, a little Jewish domestic from Romania with us, who joined us and helped my, my\nmother and she also spent the last few months with us in this, in this basement. And she was\nfrom Romania and with the Russians we had Romanian troops coming in. And she was a\nbeautiful young girl, nineteen, and the Romanian officers were just, just absolutely crazy\nabout her. So she took me by the hand and she said, \u201cCome with me.\u201d And she went with\nthese Romanians to all the jewelry stores and she amassed a fortune within days in jewelry.\nAnd then said goodbye to us and disappeared. We never found out what happened to her.\nShe had a fiancee in Romania, whether she found him or not, we suspected she eventually\nended up in Israel like most young people of that time. But I went with her and Romanian\nofficers, I went with Russians. I was kind of a street urchin for awhile. I enjoyed the fact\nthat nobody, nobody can really give me any orders. And my mother could not control me\neither, you know? I was now a man and I was just intoxicated by this, and so I had a little\nstore there, that, with all the stolen goods, and my father saw this when he came home and\nfound out, asked me what happened and I told him. And he was absolutely just horrified\nthat I would do something like this and made me take everything back to the stores where I\ngot it from. It was interesting, he got a little cart for me, we put everything on it and he came\nwith me and he stayed outside and I had to deliver it back. And I tell you, some of those\npeople could not believe that this happened. And today, of course, I feel very good about\nthis but not, not at that time. So, in, it took me only a year or two to realize that I, my real\nemotions that I\u2019m not a Hungarian, I never had a Hungarian passport, you know? I never\nhad any, any identity, Hungarian identity. They, I was always being denied of being a\nHungarian even though my parents were born in Hungary and practically everybody back\ngenerations born in Hungary and so I joined the Zionist Movement. And in 1948, the, the,\nthe Communists completely took over the government. They called it the Year of Turn.\nAnd all other organizations except for Communist youth organizations were banned. So\nagain now I was in the underground Zionist organization.\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\nTape 3, Side B",
        "Q: Okay, so this is tape three, side B of an interview with Mr. Robert Holczer. And will you\ndescribe to me your father\u2019s homecoming, what that event was like for you and your mother?\nAnd your father?",
        "A: Well, I told you, before, that, it, we knew because of an emissary that he had sent ahead of\nhim who then by small dosage made us aware of the fact that he was alive, that he was\ncoming, but of course, it was a tremendous emotional experience for him to appear there\nand, the fact that he immediately understood why there are two families living in the\napartment and, and, and accepted our decision, it was just a very nice homecoming. Because\nnumber one, we saw him, number two he brought food, which helped us to have a little feast\nthen, and number three is that he, we knew that that\u2019s what he would have done, he would\nhave split the living quarters and would not throw a family of four, family of five who were\nout of their own, well, problems, housed in our place. We... naturally, we were totally just\noverwhelmed by emotions for awhile and then, set out to see the rest of the family. He\nwanted to see his brothers and sisters and, and, that\u2019s, this is what happened.",
        "Q: So you had left, when did you, let\u2019s go back a little bit again.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You had left the, the house on Zichy Jeno Street.",
        "A: Yes. Zichy utca. Yeah, I left it practically the day after we were liberated and went back to\nsee what happened to our apartment. And that\u2019s where I found that family living in it.\n\u2018Kay? And, then shortly we moved back with my mother and so after a few months, I think it\nmust have been April or May when my father finally appeared.",
        "Q: And you, during that few months, food was very scarce?",
        "A: It was, very scarce. But again, this aunt of ours, of mine, who played such an important role\nin saving all of us, again, she and I, we teamed up and went, which was very customary then\nfor city people to do, took jewelry and possessions of the family that we thought farmers\nmight like to have and we could put on our body, and walked about, I would say, thirty, forty\nkilometer, about twenty miles from Budapest, and exchange it for food. We also hired a\nperson with a horse to drag it back to Budapest. It was mainly flour, lard, necessities, but of\ncourse, a horse was immediately a red flag in, in the eyes of the Russians because they\nconfiscated every horse, everything that could be used for transporting their goods. And we\nwere caught midway between this place and Budapest, coming back, in a small Danubian\nvillage. On the other side of the Danube, there was a battle going on. And we knew that it\ndoesn\u2019t affect anything, because the Danube is a very wide river and the Germans didn\u2019t\nhave any means to get over and why would they come over, but there was a battle over there\nbecause Trans-Danubia was not liberated yet. And so the Russians were very edgy and they\nconfiscated the cart, they confiscated the food, they confiscated the horse and then, they also\nincarcerated my aunt and myself. And I have no idea what happened, but the next... my\naunt was with me in the room and the, the Russian captain came in and took her out and she\ncame back a few hours later and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything is going to be fine.\u201d\nAnd the next morning, we were given back the cart, the horse, the man who was the owner\nof the horse and cart and the food and everything else and let go. And I can only guess what\nwas the price. The only thing I regret is that we heard that after delivering the stuff to our\nhome and sharing it with the family, when the, the farmer whose, who had the horse and the\ncart went back, eventually, was caught and lost both. So yes, if you had still some\nbelongings that farmers would appreciate, you could have food. Because the farmers always\nhave food.",
        "Q: How long did that cartful of food last you?",
        "A: Ah, probably, a few weeks and then, the, the UNRRA, the American Jewish organizations\nwere also sending packages and, and would supply us regularly. So that helped too. We\nwere not really, you know, in danger of, of starving to death.",
        "Q: And did you go back to school?",
        "A: Yes, I went back to school, to high school, and eventually finished practically, my high\nschool at the age of eighteen. And just a few weeks before, practically, of finishing, my\nZionist Organization give me signals that it was time to go to Israel because they couldn\u2019t\nguarantee that we would have more time. The Communist Police was and the border guards\nwere really closing everything very tightly. So, I, my instructions were to say goodbye to\nmy family and get either an instrument or an instrument case, that was instruction number\none. Then I was called by my Zionist leaders and, and asked if it is true that my mother\ncomes from this northern Hungarian town, I said yes. They said, \u201cDo us a favor. Go to that\ntown, introduce yourself as, so they can recognize that you are, your mother is related,\u201d and\nall this and that, \u201cand ask them if they would like to have a high school orchestra to play a\nconcert in town. And if they say yes,\u201d \u2014which probably they would, they said, because\nwhich little town doesn\u2019t like a free concert\u2014 \u201cgo to a printer, here is money and have nice\nposters printed.\u201d And they give me the date. I went, I talked to the mayor, he was\noverwhelmed, I went to the printer, I had all the prints made and I didn\u2019t realize at that time\nthat this was the alibi just in case we would be caught because this town is on the way to the\nborder, my mother\u2019s birthplace. On a given day, we boarded the bus, the bus was a state-\nowned bus by that time from a state-owned company. We were all either holding an\ninstrument or having an instrument case so people thought this was a high school orchestra\nand while singing Communist songs, we took off for the border. On the border, when we got\nclose to this town, we kept on going and the bus driver said that he was hungry, we were\nhungry too so we stopped in a, in a certain pub or so and this was in 1948, February. We\nwere eating there and getting something to drink and a woman began to flirt with the bus\ndriver. And we were horrified because that would, everything would cause a problem, we,\nwe knew that we had a definite plan. And soon the bus driver said that he would like to take\nabout a half an hour rest and my, our leader argued with him but he said, \u201cAll right, go.\u201d\nAnd as soon as he disappeared, he gathered us and he said, \u201cGo across this field and there is\na barn there and don\u2019t ask any questions, just get into the barn.\u201d That\u2019s what we did. They\nclosed the barn and around midnight, or so, or later, we were marched down to the Ipoly\nRiver which is the river between Czechoslovakia and Hungary and to our great amazement,\nwho was leading us?\u2014the peasant woman who was in the pub. She shed her twelve skirts or\nso because those women still wore many, many skirts, this was the, the thing. Now she had\na leather jacket and blue jeans and she spoke Hebrew with our leader. She was a, an Israeli\narmy officer, born to Hungarian parents who spoke perfect Hungarian and this was her job,\nto distract. And she led us down to the river, everything was supposed to happen so that on\nthe other side of the river, this was Czechoslovakia and the reason we had to go to\nCzechoslovakia and not to Austria because the border between Austria and Hungary was\nalready closed and tightly controlled but the Czechs were still kind of in between this Year\nof Turn and the Democratic regime that was there before. The, the end, at the end we\ncrossed the river but instead of getting into the trucks, the border guards stayed and started to\ntalk right there which was odd and very painful because there was snow on the ground. It\nwas very cold in February, we were wet and we had to lie on the ground for about a half an\nhour when they finally left. Then we couldn\u2019t find a truck, the truck left, too, who was\nsupposed to wait for us. So it took us about a half a day to find it and, finally, we were taken\nto Bratislava, where the gendarmerie was paid off. We were nominally arrested by the\ngendarmerie and he put into a warm place in the synagogue, there was straw on the floor, I\nremember, and the next morning, we were taken to the railroad station, put in boxcarts [sic]\nand within about a half an hour they opened. We were in Vienna, in the American section\nof, of, of Vienna. At that time, Vienna was divided. So this was my, my great escape to\nIsrael. And from there on, of course, we were taken down and eventually ended up in Israel.",
        "Q: You mentioned how you had joined this Zionist organization that you realized that you, you\nwere not really a Hungarian citizen.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Was it the desire to have a place that led you to join the Zionist Organization?",
        "A: Yes. I mean, they, they, they, I felt that I was among brothers and sisters and I felt\u2014at that\ntime remember it was the last few weeks of the war\u2014that I was, if I fought, I was going to\nfight for, for the Jewish homeland. And I already associated myself more with that than with\nHungary. That was, every young person needs a fatherland and that was mine, even though\nI'd never seen it before. So, it was an emotional thing and I stayed in Israel for two day, two\nyears.",
        "Q: How did your parents relate to your decision, to...",
        "A: Of course, they were very, very upset and very sad. But I said, \u201cYou can come and, and join\nme,\u201d you know. And we agreed that they would but of course, they couldn\u2019t, because after\nwe left, 1t was impossible to, to leave Hungary for awhile. So, I corresponded and this was,\nthis was one of the reasons why I returned eventually, in 1950 to Hungary, \u201ccause I realized\nthat I needed to make up for the years that my father was away. So I returned to Hungary\nand it was the worst of the Stalinist era. It was like 1984, it was terrible.",
        "Q: Did he, did your father identify himself as a, did he feel a Hungarian nationalism in any\nway?",
        "A: No, my father never really made an issue out of this. He never made an issue out of this, you\nknow? One way or another. Just, he, he, he loved his environment, Budapest. He loved to\ngo to the coffee house and play cards with his friends and drink coffee and, and, probably\ngossip or whatever, politics. He loved that. And he told us a cute little joke. They always\nasked him why doesn\u2019t he follow me, when he was already alone, after my mother died and\nhe, he said, \u201cI tell you a joke.\u201d He said, \u201cMr. Kohn sits in this famous Hungarian coffee\nhouse\u201d\u2014it was called Hungaria, it\u2019s a very famous, or New York, it had two names. New\nYork before and after the German occupation, called Hungaria because you couldn\u2019t give a\nplace New York. Anyway, Mr. Kohn sits there and people say, \u201cMr. Kohn, it is now the\n1940s, we are after the war, all your friends are gone. They\u2019re all in New York, what are\nyou doing here alone in the coffee house?\u201d And Mr. Kohn said, \u201cLook son, what would I\nhave done had I also left for New York? I would have arrived there one day and the next day\nI would have looked for my old friends and I would have found them and the third day we\nwould have sat down to talk, about what? The good old days in the coffee house.\u201d He said,\n\u201cLook son, I am already in the coffee house.\u201d And my father always said, \u201cThis is my coffee\nhouse.\u201d In other words, this was his life, this was his environment. You know, he was\nalways on his feet, he was always going around in Budapest and he was also working almost\nup to the last year just before he died. He was, he just couldn\u2019t be without work. He was a\nworkaholic and he knew that in this country, you need language. And he had very poor\nlanguage facilities, he would have never learned English. So, it was a realization but we, we\nsaw him as much as we could.",
        "Q: What did you do when you arrived in Israel?",
        "A: Basically, I spent most of my time in kibbutz, living in a kibbutz. I learned to work with the\ntractors at that time, and then we, with a hundred other Hungarian, young Hungarian youth,\nmost of them from my old organization from Hungary, we received land near the Jordanian\nborder by a town called Afula and started our own settlement. So, I was really working the,\nas a farmer, kibbutz.",
        "Q: Did you play any role in the War of Independence?",
        "A: Very little, almost none. I got there very late, remember, so I do not claim any, any real\nmajor role at all. No.",
        "Q: And then you decided to come back in 1950?",
        "A: In 1950, then, it was part of a homesickness for my parents and part of stupidity on my part,\nthat I believed that things are the way Communist papers describe it in Hungary. I decided\nto return, perhaps temporarily, perhaps not. And when I arrived in Hungary, I realized that it\nwas a fatal mistake.",
        "Q: Had you found any of that sense of home that you were looking for when. . .",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: when you went to Israel?",
        "A: No, no. I found my parents, but other than that, it was, it was a terrible period for any human\nbeing, especially people who came from the West. It was the worst for those, because you\nwere considered unreliable and especially coming from Israel, even more so. The reason\nwas, that by that time, Stalin was very paranoid and Zionism was one of his main targets.\nSo, it, it, this is, this is something that is not much to do with the Holocaust anymore. It was\njust very hard for anybody to live under Communist rule at that time, but especially for Jews.\nWell, I don\u2019t know if you know that in 1953 when he was dying, he looked up and he saw\nsome Jewish doctors around his deathbed and he said, \u201cThey are poisoning me, they\u2019re\nagainst me.\u201d And he said, \u201cArrest them.\u201d And practically hours before he died, they\narrested Jewish doctors and I was just at the University in Hungary, studying and that was\nmy state, the time of my state examination. And Hungary had to follow everything that the\nSoviet Union did so they were looking for anybody who had anything to do with Zionism.\nAnd they found me at the university and I was let go, weeks before my state exam. So, it, it\nwas difficult but of course that has nothing to do with the Holocaust anymore.",
        "Q: When you had been in Israel, had you, do you feel, did you feel that you had found some of\nwhat you were looking for there? Was your intention to go?",
        "A: Yes and no. Yes and no. I had some very deep feelings about the country as such and then\nagain, I was still a young man, eighteen, and I was also influenced by a great deal of these\nrevolutionary Marxist ideas. And there were many things that were not to my liking, that I\nwould have loved to see differently. And so when I left Israel, I did not just leave it with\nnostalgia. I left it because I thought that finally, somehow, in Hungary, I\u2019m going to find,\nfind that utopistic state, that, that 1s, 1s justice and equality for everyone. And, I was just a\nlittle bit too stupid, to, to think that way, but I did. So it a was a, a double reason to return.\nA, a totally unfounded idealism and homesickness.",
        "Q: What did you do for work when you returned home?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t work for awhile because I was unreliable, anybody who came from the West,\nespecially from Israel. Finally, with some great connections, I was hired to sweep and clean\na garage, a state-owned garage. And that would have been my future for a long time, had it\nnot been for a, just a, a very fortunate incident when the Party secretary of my, my company\nwas sick and a substitute Party secretary was there. And I appeared at her office because\nthere were big posters, they wanted workers youth to go to college because they figure that\nsome of the middle class and the former upper class that sends its sons to college and I asked\nif she can recommend me and she said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know you but why don\u2019t you dictate a\nrecommendation to my secretary?\u201d And so that was the big first hurdle that I went through\nbecause the regular Party secretary would have never written that letter. So, with this, I went\nto a university forum, but the trouble is you had to write your autobiography, and the minute\nthey got to a point of Israel, which you could not in those days just stay silent about two\nyears of your life, when they found out they said \u2018Thanks but no thanks,\u2019 and again a strange\nthing happened. One of the faculty members who was on the committee, cause the\ncommittee that interviewed people consisted of faculty member, Communist Youth\nOrganization, the Communist Party, the union, various organizations. He came after me and\nhe said, \u201cHolczer, Holczer,\u201d he said, \u201cwas your father from the suburb of Budapest?\u201d I said\nyes. He said, \u201cWas there a soccer team in which he and four or five of his brothers played at\nthe same time?\u201d I said yes. He said, \u201cI played with your dad.\u201d He said, \u201cCome back in\nSeptember,\u201d he says \u201cYou were a minor when you left Hungary. Let\u2019s see if the minister of\neducation can exempt you,\u201d you know? Amnesty you, pardon you, whatever. Well,\nanyway, I went back in September and nobody knew who I was, nobody, they had no idea,\ngo away. So I looked for him and he went in to the Party secretary and he came out and he\nsaid, and he said, \u201cI am happy to inform you that the minister of education give you a\ndispensation. You can enter the university.\u201d And he said, \u201cThis is the last time you and I\never talk to each other.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t even greet me.\u201d He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d\nAnd that was it. This is how I got in. Yeah. So it was two coincidences, very lucky ones.\nEnd of Tape 3, Side B\nTape 4, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape four, side A of an interview with Robert Holczer. So you entered university,\nwhat year was this?",
        "A: 1950.",
        "Q: And you stayed, you studied what?",
        "A: I studied, my major was geography and my minor was history.",
        "Q: What were you interested in doing after you gained your degree?",
        "A: I wanted to be a geographer. I wanted to work for the Geographic Institute of Hungary or\nteach geography. I love geography. And, in Hungary, it was a very important subject at that\ntime. But in America, it was no subject at all. I, when I arrived here, people were just\nlooking at me and they said, \u201cNo, this is, unfortunately, we are not teaching geography\nhere.\u201d\u2019 It was incorporated into what they called social studies in the high school.",
        "Q: So, after you...",
        "A: So, I switched and I made, I went back to school here in 1959, and switched and had a\nhistory major, \u2018kay. And I left geography just out there, I didn\u2019t touch it anymore, so I got a\nmaster\u2019s degree in history and my secondary credentials, teaching credentials.",
        "Q: After you graduated from, from college while you were in Hungary, what did you do?",
        "A: Then I taught in a junior high school in the suburbs of Budapest, working-class suburb in\nBudapest until 1956, when the Revolution broke out and I left.",
        "Q: Did you play any sort of role in the Revolution?",
        "A: Just a very minor one. In the 19\" district of Budapest, I was asked to form the New\nDemocratic Teachers\u2019 Union. And I had very ambivalent feelings about the revolution\nbecause I was afraid that the same elements, the same kind of elements who came up in\n1944, October 15, eventually will dominate it. I just did not trust the revolution so I stayed\naway from it. I understood the anger of the people and I sympathized with the, with the\ndesire to have a free country, but I didn\u2019t trust some of the groups that participated in it. And\nwhat, what really precipitated my departure is that a few days before I left, I saw some\ngroups with Arrow Cross armbands, and that did it. I realized that I would never be able to\nlive here anymore. There will be absolutely no, no peace for somebody who is either a\nhuman being or, or has a Jewish background or favors a peaceful living, lifestyle.",
        "Q: Had you experienced directly any anti-Semitism?",
        "A: All the time. Hungarians are with the Austrians and Poles, probably the three most anti-\nSemitic countries in Europe. I felt much less anti-Semitism frankly in Germany in my\nnineteen years that I recently spent there than in Hungary or in Austria.",
        "Q: So you decided to leave Hungary.",
        "A: Yes, I decided to leave Hungary and in 1956, November, I started to walk toward the border\nwith a cousin of mine who just graduated from high school and was always in political\ntrouble with the police for his outspoken attitude, so, he followed, he came with me, and we\nthen crossed the border after, I think about six, seven days or so. And arrived in Austria.",
        "Q: Was it difficult to leave, did you need any exit visa or any...",
        "A: No, it was totally illegal. We were walking usually from dawn to dusk and whatever the\nconditions were, you know, favorable, we didn\u2019t really like to walk in broad daylight but of\ncourse we couldn\u2019t walk in the darkness either because we didn\u2019t know the terrain. We slept\nin, in haylofts, the farmers were quite kind. They felt probably a little bit guilty for not\nparticipating in the revolution and slowly approached the border this way. And then before\nthe border, it was then a little bit difficult, and we had to have, we had connections because a\nthird person joined us whose relatives lived in a border town and they helped us to get over.",
        "Q: And then your parents were still living...?",
        "A: Yes. My parents were still there and I told them definitely that this time I want them to\nfollow me, eventually, when they can come legally. Because I didn\u2019t want them to, they\nwere by that time, the age when you don\u2019t just chase somebody across snowfields. So, we\narrived in Graz, that was the first Austrian town, and you had all the opportunity to go then\nanywhere in the world. Every country opened its arms. [dog barking] Lie down, Gelsey.",
        "Q: So you arrived in, in Graz.",
        "A: And the world was then open to us and I intended to go to Sweden. I wanted to stay in\nEurope, and I just thought that Sweden would be a good place for me to, to be. But my\ncousin got away from me while we were staying in Salzburg, in, in a hotel which was one of\nthe gathering points for the Hungarian refugees, and left a note for me to come and follow\nhim. And I promised his mother that I would take care of him so I followed him and this 1s\nhow I ended up in the U.S.",
        "Q: You followed him all the way to the U.S.?",
        "A: Yes. Well, of course, it was very easy. All I had to do is go and tell the authorities there,\nthe, the ones who were in charge of the Hungarian refugees that instead of Sweden, I\nchanged my mind and I want to go to the U.S. Not only that, they already, they already had\nsome messages from the Red Cross saying that if I show up, and the reason I was away,\nbecause previously he had asked me to go to Vienna and arrange for him to stay with his\nrelatives in Vienna who were not my relatives, but he wanted to go to school there. He was\ntotally intoxicated by the, by the light, western lifestyle because he had never been to the\nWest. And by the time I came back to Salzburg, he was gone. So, but he left messages. So\nthe Red Cross sent me to St. Louis, Missouri to be reunited with him.",
        "Q: Did you have any idea why he would have done such a thing, of just leaving?",
        "A: No, he, he was just, he was a very unpredictable fellow, you know? You could not really, he\nwas, he was a just a restless person and I think he figured, well, why not, I want to see the\nU.S. and, and his message to me was, \u201cYou can always go to Sweden from the U.S. You\nwill have the money and opportunity, but maybe you won\u2019t have the opportunity to go and\nsee the U.S. if you live in Sweden.\u201d Little, little did he know about economic conditions in\nthe eighties and nineties that, I think, more Swedes can travel much easier and come here\nthan we in Sweden.",
        "Q: Why did you prefer to go to Sweden?",
        "A: You know, I am a romantic. And I just felt that I would not want to leave Europe. Europe,\nto me, was always my home. I loved the old towns, and I always loved clarity and that, the\nScandinavian purity, maybe, that I have seen too many, I had seen too many Scandinavian\nmovies, Swedish movies. But they just appealed to me, the lifestyle. And I liked the fact\nthat the social security, that people have in Scandinavian countries, especially in Sweden.\nAnd just a lot of things appealed to me about Sweden, and I knew that I would be treated\nfairly, so, that was it.",
        "Q: And you had, yet you had enough money to just travel to the U.S. instead and...",
        "A: No, I had no money. We didn\u2019t need any money. [talkover] No. Nobody had any money.\nAll you did was as a refugee, you appeared at, when, when we finally were picked up and\ntaken to Graz by the Austrian police, they were very well organized there, there, you found\nevery religious denomination having a booth, who welcomed you. You could go and say\nthat I am a Baptist, I am a Catholic, made no difference and then name the country where\nyou wanted to go to. And, and it was very simple, you didn\u2019t need any money. Then, next\nstep was each had a place in Austria where they temporarily would house you, even give you\na little pocket money and there you waited for your transportation to go to that country. And\nthat so, I did not really want to be attached to any religious organization so I went to a very\nindependent one called the Tolstoy Foundation. It was founded by Tolstoy\u2019s daughter and,\nusing I think the, the royalties of Tolstoy\u2019s books, and so they are the ones who brought me\nto the U.S. It was all gratis. I came over, the American military and the Air Force is the one\nwho flew all Hungarian refugees over. MATS, Military Air Transportation, the, the\nstewardesses and almost everybody involved with us were of, of Hungarian origin, most of\nthem from Cleveland. Cleveland is the second largest Hungarian city in the world after\nBudapest. And, and so here, they then, then I was handed over to a Jewish organization\nbecause my cousin came through a Jewish organization. So in St. Louis they were waiting\nfor me. If you were a Hungarian refugee those days, you had no problem because the world,\nthe whole world felt very guilty about not helping the Revolution and so they did everything\npossible. I mean I was so embarrassed. I never, I was never in my life treated this way, I\nthought, you know, I was some dignitary or something. They were waiting for me at the\nairport and I was just... But first I had to spend, like most Hungarians, some time at Camp\nKilmer in New Jersey which was a screening camp for people. They screened out the sick,\nthe U.S. did not take, I think, people with TB and some other illnesses, they went to\nScandinavia, the Swedes did, and also Communist Party members and such. I don\u2019t know\nwhat the criteria was, but they looked into your background a little bit. And so this is how I\nended up in St. Louis. My cousin stayed with me for about no more than two months, not\neven that much. He found some relatives in Chicago who would help him to go to\nChampagne, the University of Illinois, and he just left. And we were housed, we were taken\nby an American family who had very good intentions but the man was a manic depressive so\nyou could never figure out for one second to another how he would react to you. And,\napparently, his wife felt that maybe taking Hungarian refugees in would, would somehow\nremedy the problem but it didn\u2019t. And they had a mentally retarded child, so it was not a\nvery ideal situation for a newcomer although she was very nice to me and I stayed there for a\nfew months and then eventually, I met a professor of Hungarian ancestry and origin at the\nUniversity of, Washington University in St. Louis who had in Aspen, Colorado, a house, and\nhe and his family spent every summer there because he was a member of the music festival.\nAnd when they heard... I hated St. Louis, I just couldn\u2019t find anything redeeming about\nthat, that city, and when they heard that I was very unhappy and all this, they took me to\nAspen, Colorado and they said, \u201cYou can always work here for a dollar an hour, too.\u201d And I\nloved it. I stayed there for almost three years. And most of my friends and connections and\neverything in my American life practically comes from that period. From my Aspen period,\npeople who helped me to get ahead in, in more ways than one. So, I am, I was very lucky\nagain to end up there. Of course, those days Aspen was not what it is today, you know.",
        "Q: Were you teaching there?",
        "A: I was, no, from Aspen was a place where I collected my money and, and, you know, saved\nenough. I wanted to go up to Alaska for one summer. I went up to Alaska and worked for\nthe Forest Service and then came to Fresno, California, which offered me a loan. I couldn\u2019t\nget a scholarship because they didn\u2019t know much about me. My papers did not arrive from\nHungary. So it was, but at least they offered me a National Defense Loan so that helped me\nto start school. And I stayed in Fresno for two years when I got my teaching credentials and\nmy master\u2019s degree in history. And I, those were, scholastically speaking, they were good\nyears. I had very good instructors and, and good friends and sponsors and, I did not regret it.\nAnd then I ended up in the Bay Area where I wanted to be. And met my wife there. And I\nwas teaching in Marin County.",
        "Q: Were you in touch with your parents throughout this. . .",
        "A: Yes. All the time. And I, almost every summer I went home to visit, okay?",
        "Q: Were there plans for them to come?",
        "A: Yes. They, once I got married in \u201967, they came to visit and they enjoyed it very much and\nthen in 1974, when, see I married my wife with three children. They were tiny, their, their\nfather abandoned them, he was alcoholic. And so, my wife and I raised them. And by the\ntime, 1974, I get an offer from a friend of mine in Switzerland to come and help him, he was\na director of a school in a children\u2019s village in Switzerland, Pestalozzy, very famous\nchildren\u2019s village, Pestalozzy Children\u2019s Village. Do you speak German?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. Okay. And so, and I loved the mountains, I loved the Alps and I wanted to get back to\nEurope. And since we had only one child at home by that time, and he was willing to come\nSO we went over. We, we resigned our jobs and we went back and the job fell through.\nBecause in the meantime, the Swiss had the law, not a law, a plebiscite about not hiring\nforeigners unless they can find a local person for the job. And after years of advertisement\nfor this particular position, they couldn\u2019t find anybody, a couple came just as we were being\ninterviewed. So it fell through and in 1964, no I mean 1965, before I got married, I came\nover to Europe to teach for the Army, just for a year. I just needed, I was a very confirmed\nbachelor, and I needed a year to think about whether I want to marry somebody with three\nsmall children and here a confirmed bachelor. So I stayed for a year when I decided yes, but\nduring the year, I got to know a lot of people in the system, in the Department of Defense\nSchool System. So now that the job fell through and we basically gave up our jobs here in\nthe States, I had only one, you know, opportunity here, to go over and see if any of our, our,\nany of my former colleagues can be found and if I can get any help to get a job for my wife\nand myself. And not only that I found some but they were now in very, very high positions\nand they said, no problem. And both of us, within a year, started to teach. My wife got a job\neven before me, because it was more difficult for high school teachers than elementary. So\nshe started out and we lived in the Frankfurt area and we stayed for nineteen years.",
        "Q: How did you meet your wife?",
        "A: We, when I left school with my credentials, I wanted to, I had a girlfriend in the Bay Area,\nalso from Aspen. She was a schoolteacher and she wanted me to get a job there so we can\nbe close and we were there. Now all of a sudden, she said, oh, at that time it was very, by\nthat time it was very difficult to get a job for a teacher, in the early sixties, and the only job\navailable, finally, was teaching special ed classes. And I said, children are children, I don\u2019t\ncare. I had to sign a paper that I would go to school and get a credential. And the man who\nhired me was also a Holocaust survivor so it, it really helped. I told him very honestly why I\nwant the job and I said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter why I want the job, I will, I will do a good job, you\ncan, you can bet on that.\u201d And I hope I did. So, he hired me and this is where I met my\nwife. She was also teaching special ed classes, and but she stayed only for a few years and\nthen when I came back in 1965, then I went into special ed for the county, for Marin County,\nand I stayed for almost ten years, nine years. So that\u2019s how we met. And then I switched.\nWith the Army, I switched back to teaching political science and, and history.",
        "Q: What was it like living in Germany all those years?",
        "A: Well, it was much more pleasant than I had envisioned, frankly. I found that there is a very\nlarge segment of a new German generation that is, is absolutely appalled, okay, of the past.\nAnd I met a lot of intellectuals who had a very good vision of the past, and not only that,\nthey spread the knowledge around. Naturally, there is an element in, in Germany, that 1s,\nyou know, that is the scum of earth, but frankly, they are very much the minority. And I, I\ncould live in Germany much easier, probably, than I could ever live in Austria, where it\ndoesn\u2019t take more than a few minutes to hear somebody making an anti-Semitic or fascist\nremark, especially if they have a couple of beer. You know. So, there is, there is a new\nGermany. Now, with East Germany joining, it is a problem. But West Germany itself, was,\nI would say, a pretty civilized state. Okay, now the East Germans, that\u2019s a different, that\u2019s a,\nthat\u2019s a tragedy right now, that they had not been instructed by the proper history teachers,\nand, there are big problems in East Germany because the East Germans said, \u201cThe Nazis, oh\nno, they live in West Germany. We, we are good Communists here, we don\u2019t have to worry\nabout the past.\u201d And this attitude then led to what 1s happening nowadays in Germany with\nthe skinheads.",
        "Q: Was it difficult at first for you to accept that Germany was so, that you could really get along\nwith some of these Germans?",
        "A: Well, again, you know, I followed my father. He came to see us in Germany once and while\nhe was there, our landlady\u2019s son was killed in a motorcycle accident, a young seventeen year\nold, a young man. And we had to go to the funeral. And my wife said to my father as she\nlook around, \u201cGrandpa, look, all these men of your age. Do you sometimes think of all the\nghosts that are around here behind these men?\u201d And my father said, \u201cYou can\u2019t live with\nhate.\u201d He says, \u201cThere are ghosts everywhere. There are Indian ghosts in America, too.\nYou have your own ghosts.\u201d And that\u2019s just the way that, you can\u2019t constantly think of that.\nAnd we befriended Germans who were a lot more even liberal than, than we are. And so, I\nmean, you can find all kinds of people. That, but there, Germany, I don\u2019t really worry too\nmuch about Germany as much as I worry about Russia and, and Poland and Austria and\nthere you can find a lot of fascist elements and Hungary too, probably.",
        "Q: We\u2019ve got a few more minutes. So, is there anything, what made you decide to return to the\nStates?",
        "A: Oh, when, the, the military was in a, is, is a drawdown situation where they were pulling out\nquite a few troops from Germany and we reached, my wife reached the point where she just\nsaid she wanted to be close to the children. We have four grandchildren. She, this house\nwhich didn\u2019t look like this at that time was a small little place, this was one end of the house\nand that was the other end of the house. A partner of my brother-in-law lived here, a\nveterinarian, but it was a very small place. It was available. They bought it and he called us\nand my wife said, \u201cLook, I stayed in Europe for nineteen years with you, now I would like\nyou to stay where I would like to be and it is so nice to be so close to family.\u201d Our son 1s\nonly four hours away, in Nashville, with a little baby. And oh, and she gets along with her\nsister very well and we all get along, we never had an argument. So, that was an ideal\nsituation so that\u2019s how we got here.\nEnd of Tape 4, Side A\n[NOTE: SIDE TWO OF TAPE 4 IS BLANK]\nTape 5, Side A",
        "Q: I'm Arwen Donahue and I'm here with Robert Holczer in Paris, Kentucky on April 29, 1996.\nThis is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview. And first to... ask you a\ncouple of questions about the issues that came up in the last interview. I just wanted to get\nyour aunt's name, for one thing, the aunt whose apartment you stayed in on Zichy Jeno\nStreet, what was her name?",
        "A: Her name was Aranka, that is Goldie in English, you know, Aranka, and Teply, T-E-P-L-Y.\nShe's still living in Hungary at this date and probably it would be very difficult to\ncommunicate with her because she is number one, old, and number two, I think that she has\nsome mental problems that she developed since the war and, but she certainly is the heroine\nof the whole story and my survival, so I try to keep up with her but it's very, very difficult\nand I'm very, very sorry about that. But she has a son who lives in Switzerland so at this\npoint she's still alive.",
        "Q: I didn't quite understand how just go back a little bit, when you lived in the house on Zichy\nJeno Street, before it became a clinic, it was a Jewish house.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And yet there were some people who lived in the house who were non-Jews.",
        "A: Non-Jews, yes.",
        "Q: And I suppose your aunt was considered one of them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But before the house was designated a clinic, if anyone in the house were to be liquida...\nwere to be put into the ghetto, would they have gone apartment by apartment, or would they\nhave taken the entire house?",
        "A: They would have gone apartment by apartment and, of course, if you could prove that you\nare a gentile, and that was very easy because every concierge had a list, years ago this was a\nlaw in Hungary, that every concierge had a list and that had nothing to do with Jews or non-\nJews way back, because when you change your residence in Europe, you have to go to the\npolice and report it. In other words, every European country, they know who is at that point\nwhere. And so this list existed, all they had to do, come and talk to the concierge and all the\nconcierges were basically serving the government, they were in my estimate, what I call the\ncommon man, and their attitude changed regarding of what the government was doing and\nthey were lackeys and so there was no big problem, they always could tell who were the\ngentiles and who were not by just showing the list. But there were gentiles still living in the\nJewish houses who had a nice place and they just didn't want to move, you know? And so\nwhen, for example, at one time we were lined up because the house was discovered and this\nGeorge Ara Jereczian was not there with his guards. I think they went to buy, get some\nrations for the house, and so we were really without any defense, and we were lined up, then\nthe gentiles who are not down there be also lined up because they, apparently they had\nknown what was going on and could identify themselves.",
        "Q: But you were lined up although you lived with your aunt?",
        "A: We were, yes, we were lined up, we were lined up. And then in the last moment, a lot of\nthings happened. This aunt of mine, for example, she was also out, most people who could\ngo on the street were always out looking for something to eat and bring home and when she\nsaw her mother, for example, in the lineup, she just went up to her and started to kick her and\nsaid, \u201cThis stupid slut. Just, she is so stupid. Every time people say line up, she lines up,\nshe's not Jewish.\u201d And all this, and in front of those Arrow Cross people, she just dragged\nher mother out of the line up and she had a personality that nobody argued with her. So they\nassume that she is a gentile, therefore her mother is a gentile, too. And then we were saved\nbecause George Ara Jereczian came home and immediately, his men immediately went to\nthese punks and said, you know, \u201cClear out of here in short order, papers and everything\nelse. And if you want, you know, we'll call the Ministry of Defense.\u201d And so, they knew\ntheir job and threatened these people who then left.",
        "Q: You mentioned that there were about ten people living in that apartment with your aunt?",
        "A: About ten, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And some of them were her brothers and sisters?",
        "A: Yes, they were, they were, I start out with my mother, then my father's three sisters, okay?\nAmong them this Aranka, Goldie, and eventually my father's two brothers, too, joined us.\nThey were also under some kind of a disguise as policemen or this and that in whatever\nuniform they could get, but when things were really tough the last, I think, ten days or two\nweeks, they joined us, so they were there, too. Then there were some husbands, my, one of\nmy aunts had a husband and a boyfriend. It was a triangle that the family just tolerated\nbecause the boyfriend was a much nicer person than the husband, everybody, so there was\neven humor then. And some children. So we might, it's possible we were even more than\nten and that was very fortunate, a lot of apartments have a lot more than just ten people\nbecause this was, it sound like, it seemed like a safe haven and of course, all the relatives\nwere coming and you wouldn't want to throw out your relatives and so... a lot of very famous\ndoctors were there who then went on and came to this country and elsewhere and the whole\nfamily was there, so.",
        "Q: What about her other brothers and sisters, other than those who were in the apartment?\nWhere did they... were they at the time?",
        "A: Oh, my aunt's other, well, we were all together in the same apartment, it was her apartment\nand because ordinarily a gentile would not have had anything to do with Jews, but this was\nan extraordinary place because we, she knew that if they really stormed the house, the Arrow\nCross people, and if they really eliminate George Ara Jereczian and his guards, then\neverything is lost, 1t doesn't make any difference, so... and inside the house, of course, there\nwas absolutely no other rule except you made up your own so nobody cared. Yes?",
        "Q: But she had, there were thirteen all together, siblings, nght?",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: SO...",
        "A: No, no, no, no, thirteen, my father had thirteen brothers and sisters and some of them were\nalready dead and others were elsewhere. One was in what was Slovakia at that time and\nparticipated in the Slovak uprising against the Germans and was hanged, was captured and\nhanged. My father was in Yugoslavia, so there were, another was in a labor camp, we didn't\neven know where he was, so they were dispersed. The women were together, the women we\ncould get together and, but the men, only two of them. So there were altogether five, five of\nthe thirteen, right there.",
        "Q: Also, what was the name of the psychiatrist, the famous psychiatrist who...",
        "A: Volgyessi, Volgyessi. He was the most famous Hungarian psychiatrist of his, of that time.",
        "Q: Would you spell his name, please?",
        "A: V-O, and there is a double, what the Germans call, what is it, well, anyway, two dots.",
        "Q: Umlaut.",
        "A: Umlaut, yes, two dots on the O, then L-G-Y-E-S-S-I, Volgyessi. And he, he was a very\ninfluential man and I, if I remember correctly, I heard, at that time as a child, that he was the\nmain reason that this whole setup was the way it was. That he had the connection, he knew\nGeorge Ara Jereczian and he is the one who brought him in and suggested that let's do this.",
        "Q: Do you know what became of him after the war?",
        "A: He was in his, I would say, late 50's in 1945, but he had a son and two daughters and a\nrelatively younger wife, so I assume that they are somewhere and I also assume that they are\nnot in Hungary, that they are probably in the U.S., so if ever there is a reunion, I will see\nthem. As a matter of fact, I would like to see them because I was deeply in love with one of\nthe, the little Volgyessi girls. I was a young kid then, it was just a puppy love.",
        "Q: Who else of the group that was with you in the apartment on Zichy Jeno Street survived?\nYou and your aunts and your mother?",
        "A: Well, in 1945, we all survived, okay? But, oh you mean since? Who's still alive?",
        "Q: So everyone went through okay, went through the war?",
        "A: Oh, we went through the same experience and nobody... in that house, the only people who\nwere taken away were a man between eighteen and, I think it was eighteen and forty-five or\neighteen and fifty-five, before, before October 15th when the labor, when they truly were\njust going to a labor camp, labor organizations, that 1s when all the men, so there were no\nmen until October 15th, between eighteen and fifty-five in that house, they were all taken\naway. So, some of the families who lived there, for example, their father was not with them\nby that time. And, I don't know of anybody who survived. In other words, unfortunately,\nmost of these people were then in a forced march toward Germany at the end of the war and\nsomewhere in, probably western Hungary, they were just either killed or died of typhus.",
        "Q: Did you keep in touch with anyone else from the clinic after the war, other than your family?",
        "A: No, no, no. You know, I was fifteen when the war ended, and I regret this very much, but\noutside my family, my family is the only one, and there are only two members living in my\nfamily and they are the only ones. I tried to ask them if they can make some contact, I am\nnow really very much interested in keeping up with some other people, but they, they just,\nthey never really bothered and they are not very good letter writers so, and if I go to\nHungary, maybe I will look for it, I would like to and I'm going to ask, perhaps, if I can get\nto the, to any, perhaps to the synagogue in Hungary, if they have some knowledge of, is there\na group that still comes together, because there were kids of my age and I'd like to know\nwhat happened to them.",
        "Q: When you returned to your apartment, you described, in our last interview, about returning\nto your apartment after the war and finding that there were other people who were living\nthere.",
        "A: Mmm-hmm.",
        "Q: Were your things, were you furniture, any of your belongings still in the apartment?",
        "A: Yeah, interestingly, well, there was very little left in our apartment, what was left, a couple\nof boxes, and I don't know why they were left there, this family never touched. And that, to\nme, was immediately, I give them some good points for that. But when I opened it, our\napartment got a direct hit when the siege of Budapest took place and so a lot of the... and\nmost of these boxes contained tablecloth or sheets or something like that, and so they all had\nbig holes in them. And, however, a very beautiful embroidered tablecloth and the napkins\nwe had for a long time until they disintegrated. My wife mended them and we used them.\nAnd now, what happened to the furniture? A lot we give to neighbors to say, \u201cIf we come\nback, okay, hopefully, you will give it back to us and if we are not, then it is yours,\u201d so, and\nthey took it and now not one of them had a piece left that they can give back to us. They all\nsaid the same thing: the Russians took it. Now, this was the most illogical, stupid thing to\nsay, because the Russian soldiers had two hands, what are they going to do with a piano?\nWhat are they going to do with a table, what do they need it? The Russians only went for\none thing. Watches. They had watches up to their ears, it's as if they had never seen watches\nbefore, that was the only thing. They stop you on the street and that was the only question,\n\u201cDavay chasi!\u201d That means, \u201cGive me your watch.\u201d Nothing else, I mean what can a, a foot\nsoldier who is going on and on and on across Europe, what is he going to do with anything\nthat takes up space and has weight? And so it was ridiculous, but nothing, absolutely\nnothing was returned from the neighbors.",
        "Q: Did any of your friends from before the war return afterwards?",
        "A: Any of my friends? Well, as I mentioned before, my class, junior high class, was practically\ntotally taken and deported under those very unusual circumstances, so I had to look for the\nkids who were not my schoolmates, but, or either lower or higher classes, and also the ones\nthat I used to play with when I went to the city park which was not far away from us. And I\nwould say that about half of them I found, but the other half perished, you know, either\nbecause of the fires, you know there was bombs, or because they were killed during the\nArrow Cross era, after October 15th.",
        "Q: You, in our last interview, had talked a little bit about meeting up with some of your friends\naround Budapest and that you would talk about the war and that was exclusively what you\nwould talk about. When you met up with them again after the war, what did you talk about\nthen?",
        "A: Well, when I met my friends after the war, number one, we were so full of hatred, we were\nlooking for some kind of an outlet, some organization that we can join, and we found it. And\npart of it was they give away shirts, we found a Communist Party. Imagine, we were fifteen\nyear olds and we saw that people were walking around in red, flaming red shirts. And we\nfound out that the flaming red shirts come from parachutes and these parachutes were supply\nparachutes that were dropped by the Soviet forces and the Hungarians got the material and\nthe Communist Party made a kind of a campaign and made it into shirts and would give\nthem to anybody who signed up. And I think this drew us a lot more than anything else, the\nfour very close friends of mine, whom I knew from the illegal boy scout organization and,\nluckily, we all survived, we all went and signed up with the Communist Party and I think this\nis the first, or almost the last time, I ever went to the Party because, now we went to a couple\nof meetings and we were just bored to death, this happened to American communists, too.\nSigned up or something, I mean it was the most boring thing, so we never really considered\nourself truly Communist Party members because we were, I think, members for a month and\nthen we never paid any fees or we didn't do anything after that, but this was, our first step\nwas to go down to the Communist Party headquarters and sign up with the Communist\nParty, which was understandable because we felt that the Communist Party was going to be\nthe one that revenges all these atrocities and whatever happened, and then we saw that\nalmost everybody who was in the Arrow Cross movement is also in the Communist Party\nbecause people easily turned, that's obvious, you know, a lot of books and essays were\nwritten about how anybody who is an extremist in one way can become the extremist in\u2014on\nthe other side. So we found that and that was disgusting, absolutely. And the Communist\nParty knew about it and they defended it and we didn't like that, their terminology, and so we\nquit. So then we went back to, and kind of regrouped as old boy scouts. But our heart was\nnot in it because now, I mean for so many years we could not do anything as boy scouts\nexcept go out and hike in nature, we couldn't even wear a kerchief. And so now we could\nwear a uniform and some of us really bought a uniform, and then we just, we just lost\ncompletely our lust for boy scout life and that didn't work. Then, you know, this was,\nanother year went by and I, of the four, I broke away from the other four and I joined the\nZionists. They just, there were a lot of things that appealed to me, the fact that, finally, I am\ngoing to have a homeland, finally, I am going to have a passport, there was adventure.\nImmediately, they send me up in the mountains and I had to go through a certain instruction,\nmore than one, on more than one occasion. And they, I advanced, I was pretty eager and\ngood at learning things, and I became a youth leader in the movement and I loved to be with\nyoung people. And so that, to me, was a, was a very happy period of my life. My only\nconflict was with my parents. Since I was an only child, of course, they wanted me around\nas much as possible, and I reached that rebellious teenage period, I was not too rebellious,\nbut rebellious enough to move out of the house at sixteen and go to a Zionist children's home\nwhere first I was just a, a resident and I liked being with my peer group. There were many,\nthere were many in Hungary, a lot of the survivors, young people of my age, just chose this\nas a lifestyle. And what we were doing there, we received a lot of instructions in agriculture,\nin the language, Hebrew language, in Jewish history, to prepare us when we go to Israel.\nAnd my parents, of course, didn't like for me being away at sixteen and I felt really sorry for\nthem and once the rebellious period ended, in about a half a year or so, I moved back home\nand one of the reasons was that life was too free on these, it was the perfect kind of thesis,\nanti-thesis, that we were so restricted, now everything was free, I mean, and I was a little bit\nof a, I was a strange kid because I didn't grow up very quickly to become a man, and I did\nnot like the fact that here were girls of my age who wanted to sleep with me and all this and\nthat, I just, I always pictured myself more of a, an individual, a man who has things to do and\nI don't, I'm not going to spend a lot of time with, with sex and all this and my mind was not\nonly on just women, let's put it this way, even though I already had sexual experiences and\nthe whole, and because of this, they considered me a little bit of an eccentric so that happy, I\nmoved back home to satisfy my parents, but I didn't stay there long enough because I got an\noffer at the age of seventeen to go and be a resident advisor in a home for Jewish orphans.\nThat was on, it was called Tarogato Street in the Buda section of Budapest where I found a\nman who became a very good friend of mine, the man who led the institution, a marvelous\nman, also a Zionist, by the name of Spitzer\u201d and his family, and they were very good to me\nand I felt very much at home, plus I got a nice salary and all my needs were taken care of\n* First name: Imre\nthere. Even I had a girlfriend who was also a resident counselor there, so happy, really, they\nwere very happy days. And in the meantime, I also participated very actively in, I changed\norganizations and left, I was in a, I would say, kind of a petit bourgeois Zionist group and I\nwent over to the Marxists because that suited my philosophy a lot more and I stayed with\nthem and eventually they were the ones that helped me to then immigrate to Israel, that was\nafter, but we'll get to this. Now I want to talk just a little bit about school because all these\ntimes I went to school, too. Right after the, 1945, as soon as the school started, my mother\nwas determined that I should go to the School of Commerce, the high schools were\nspecialized, and there was one that was called, the Special High School for Commerce. Can\nyou stop it for a second because I want to close the window. So as I said, my mother was\ndetermined that I should go there, of course, I had no desire but I was still a good boy and I\nstarted at that school and the fact that it was the middle of the year, basically, and I missed\nthe first half of a year wasn't a big problem because anybody who was a, a Holocaust\nsurvivor at that time can just about do anything. So this was no big problem, the big\nproblem came when I noticed how many of my teachers are outright anti-American, anti-\nRussian, anti-Semitic, they haven't changed their attitude and there were some other Jewish\nkids in that school and I got together with them and I asked them if, if we should tolerate\nthis, if they think this is correct and everybody was kind of lying low, the usual way, and I\nsaid, \u201cNo, I am not going to do that.\u201d There was specifically one teacher who had, I forgot,\nhad a German name, a very small man who not only was anti-Semitic and anti-Russian and\nanti-everything and very pro-German, but agitating. He was not just making statements, he\nwas really agitating and in a very emotional way and I was, I just, I reached a point where I\njust couldn't take it anymore, not after what happened, just, you know, in the last few years\nand my boy scout commander, and at that time I was still kind of hanging on with the boy\nscout movement, my boy scout commander was now a member of the new Hungarian Secret\nPolice and he was an officer and he escaped from the labor camp and went over to the\nRussians and all this and came back with the Russian troops already and was one of the\norganizers. And I went to see him and I said, \u201cThis man should be removed from the\nschool.\u201d And they did take him in and somehow they went down the list at school and found\nout that I was the one who reported him because it was obvious since I was constantly\narguing with him, arguing with him in class and so. . .\nEnd of Tape 5, Side A\nTape 5, Side B",
        "Q: Okay, this is tape one, side B of an interview with Robert Holczer.",
        "A: I just had to quit. And then I continued my studies, I did not want to have the same\nexperience again and I went to the Jewish, the Jewish rabbi school, really, what it was, it was\na school to educate future teachers, but it was a high school still. Just like my previous high\nschool was specialized for commercial jobs, this one was, basically, a teaching gymnasium, a\nteaching high school, which meant by the laws of Hungary at that time that once you\nfinished\u2014and it was instead of four, five classes, so you were nineteen when you finished\nthe school\u2014you were then an elementary school teacher at the age of nineteen without any\ncollege education. I was there at this school and, of course, as far as any kind of a bad\nexperience, I didn't have any. Now I was among my own people, there were some very, very\ngood friends, I liked the school, it was nothing special, 1t was not challenging me, the only\naspect most of us didn't like is the religious aspect, which we didn't take very seriously. So\nactually, I was still in that school in my eighteenth year when eventually, and we will go\nback to this, I emigrated, emigrated to Israel, and so I never really finished my high school.\nBut out of deference to what happened and all this, I got a diploma. So I had a high school\ndiploma which, of course, my parents got later because I needed one and... so these are the\ntwo schools. Once I reached this level of the, this, the Jewish teaching high school for, high\nschool for future teachers, whatever, it's very difficult to translate into English, perhaps\nLyceum is a good name for it, once I reached that, then as far as my experiences after the\nHolocaust, there was no problem, you know, it's obvious. Now, going back, of course in the\nmeantime, in the Zionist movement, a lot of changes took place because we had to go\npractically underground. As the communist regime established itself in Hungary and in 1948\nthe famous turn, Year of the Turn came about, which happened in every Eastern European\ncountry, and the Year of the Turn is an expression when the communists took control,\ncomplete power, because until 1948, we had democracy in Eastern Europe, those countries\nthat knew what democracy was. And Hungary had some very able politicians and was really\non its road to become a democracy, so was Czechoslovakia, and probably Poland, too, of\ncourse, Romania was very different. But, in 1948, everything has changed, we became,\nagain, just like with the illegal boy scout group before 1945, I found myself belonging to an\nillegal organization, Zionism was outlawed because all of a sudden Stalin and company\nfound Zionism, of course, a tool of the imperialists as they called it. So we were doing,\nbasically, the same things that we were doing before, but now very cautiously, illegally, and\nmeetings were held usually either in some far away synagogues, basements or in some\nJewish orphanages where it was not very obvious if, let's say, twenty, thirty people came in\nand out because there were hundreds of people living there anyway. The, many times we\nparaded as young communists, if we wanted to have a larger meeting somewhere, singing\ncommunist songs when somebody came by, but otherwise doing our own business. By\n1949, early 1949, the situation almost was intolerable and, basically, they wanted to have the\nwhole Zionist movement leave, not the communists, but the Zionist movement wanted to get\nas many people out as possible, fearing that if Czechoslovakia is going to turn also\ncompletely communist, that there will be no way from Hungary to go anywhere. By that\ntime we could only go illegally across the border. And I think it was in February, 1949, that\nI got an order from my Zionist leadership to go to a little northern town, Vacz, V-A-C-Z, my\nmother comes from that town and they knew it. My job was to go to the mayor of the town\nand ask him if he would like to have a high school orchestra give a, an evening concert on\nsome given date. I went there, I mentioned to the mayor that I had been to Vacz many, many\ntimes because my grandparents, cousins, aunts, I had a lot of relatives and my mother was\nborn here, and of course, he was overwhelmed that a high school orchestra is coming to play.\nI then went to a printer, this was one of my instructions, and had all kinds of posters printed\nadvertising the date and the concert. Went back, reported it and the next command was that\non a certain day, I would have to go with an instrument or with an instrument case to a\ncorner of Budapest and there would be a bus there, a state bus, by that time every bus\ncompany was nationalized, and I have to board the bus with a lot of other people and I have\nto pretend that I am a member of a high school band, whatever instrument I am playing, and\ndo, not to talk about anything, Zionism or Israel, anything like that. And just wait for further\ninstructions there. And of course, I was notified that this is it, that we would be going to\nIsrael and I bid farewell to my family and got an instrument case, boarded the bus on a\ncertain date and time and I saw all my fellow Zionist members, the ones who were in my\ngroup, and we started toward the Czechoslovakian border.",
        "Q: Can I ask a few questions before we go on?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I wanted to, I'm interested in hearing how you felt about Marxism, why it was that Marxism\nappealed to you as far as the type of Zionist organization that you were involved in and\nhearing a little bit more about how you felt about the politics of the time and the communist\ntakeover.",
        "A: I had very ambivalent feelings like a lot of those Jews who did not come from the upper\nmiddle class or upper class. I came from definitely no better than the middle of the middle\nclass or rather, perhaps, the lower middle class. My father came from a very low class\nproletarian family which was very unusual among the Jews of Hungary. My mother came\nfrom a little petit bourgeois family from the northern Hungarian town. They thought they\nwere middle class, but it depends on how you classify this, as far as I'm concerned they were\nkind of a pseudo-petit bourgeois people, the kind who, it's very difficult to define them, but\nthere was not much work and a lot of complaining. Now, because I never had a very, let's\nsay satisfactory and wealthy life, naturally I had some sympathies with, with the Marxist\nmovement, it's obvious. Second, I had a very definite sympathy with them because they\nwere the most adamant about taking the war criminals and punish them. They were the most\nanti-fascist and all these things appealed to me. I was, you can consider even though I was\nnot a member, really after my one month experience, I was not a member, at least I didn't\nconsider myself a member of the Communist Party, but I certainly was sympathizing with a\nlot of their goals, even though I was in a completely different game by that time, knowing I\nwould go to Israel. But, this is probably why I changed my affiliation and went from a\nbourgeoisie Zionist organization to a Marxist Zionist organization where I felt very much at\nhome. And there were, of course, ugly things happening, the communist takeover in Eastern\nEurope was not a very pleasant occasion. And one only had to think a little bit clearly and\nrise above all this emotion to see that the communists used very nasty methods to eliminate\nanyone who disagreed with them. And the more power they grabbed, the more vicious they\nbecame. And of course, eventually I, the Zionists suffered more what anybody who was\nconsidered a Zionist or anybody, like my father, who could have been executed if they\ndiscovered that he was with Tito, so if you were an enemy for one reason or another, there\nwas no law. The communists created their own laws, the secret police had free hand and, of\ncourse, I began to become very disappointed in that. My father, he was always a Social\nDemocrat, and he never, never approved what the Communist Party was doing in Hungary.\nAnd he was very courageous because when the Communist Party gobbled up the Social\nDemocratic Party, he sent in a postcard and said, \u201cExcuse me, but I don't want to join you.\u201d\nWhich was very courageous because from there on, you could have been watched. The fact\nthat he comes from a working class and was a very little fish, I think saved his life. But if he\nhad been a name, probably he would have been killed then. And so, politics, yes, I kept my\neye on politics all the time and this helped me in 1949 to just go, because I figured there will\nnever be peace here, there will never be peace here. And, do you have any other questions?",
        "Q: Mmm-hmm.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: As far as, you had mentioned that there were some serious anti-Semitic incidents at your\nschool and I am wondering if you had any expectations after the war was over that some of\nthat would be ameliorated and that anti-Semitism was not going to be as much of a problem\nany more?",
        "A: Yes, I was very naive, really, at the age of fifteen, for some reason, I thought that a better\nworld is coming. And I was deeply disappointed when I heard that there were even pogroms\nin the countryside where a few Jews dared to come back to a village or a town in Hungary, in\nPoland, in Slovakia, I think the Czechs were the only ones who acted in a very civilized way,\nbut then they were always civilized and the most civilized in Eastern Europe. That\ndisappointed me, people were killed, survived Auschwitz, came home and killed in a\npogrom in Hungary and in some other Eastern European countries, two years after the war.\nAnd that made me very bitter and my idealism and my naivete really evaporated.",
        "Q: Did you experience anything directly, any anti-Semitic incidents?",
        "A: I have not been directly in an anti-Semitic incidence because I avoided, I avoided them, I\navoided any kind of such thing. I associated mainly with my own kind because I saw that\nthere is no hope. Now, this interestingly must have changed to a certain extent because\nalmost every one of my cousins is married to a gentile in Hungary, I think with the exception\nof maybe two, but every one of them, and the marriages are very solid. So I, and it's not,\nthey are still not what you would call a truly middle class family, that most of them still\nstayed in, you know, auto mechanics and this and that, that part. Now, the ones who are up\nthere, went to college and became dentists and those, they are all married to other Jews. It's\na very interesting phenomenon. But I have not experienced anything except when, right\nafter the war at school. Okay? I heard people constantly yelling anti-Semitic slogans,\nespecially at soccer games, but I knew that I can't expect anything else any more.",
        "Q: And you, when you joined the Zionist organization, did you have, did you really have\ndreams of being in Israel, or that this, that this was something that you felt very strongly\nabout?",
        "A: Yes, I had dreams and that was probably a, a, just a marvelous high of my youth. The\nwhole, the Zionists did a, a fantastic job in catching the spirit of young people and really\ngiving us what we wanted to have. We had a relatively free life, we had, we had a picture of\na heroic future for us, whether we are going to be still serving in the army in Israel or just\nworking in a kibbutz as farmers, almost everything about it had a kind of a super human\ntouch that I'm going to be better than all these people around here who are running around\nlike ants on the cities of Budapest, I'm going to lead a very healthy life, and finally I'm going\nto have a country, I have a home, I will have a fatherland and it was, it was a marvelous\nfeeling. And also, the whole, the whole setup, the whole organization, you know, until then,\nuntil 1946 or so, most of the picture that we saw of Jewish people is, is like sheep going into\nAuschwitz. And all of a sudden these people come from Israel, they are beautiful looking\npeople. And not only that, they had courage, the way they carried themselves and they were\nteaching us a lot of things, you know, Israel sent a lot of, they called them Schliahs, people\nthat, those who are sent, I think, literally. And they were in charge of all these camps where\nwe had to go to where we were taught self-defense and, you know, we lived on a tree in one\ncamp, I think what, for forty-eight hours, we were given a piece of rope and a knife and we\nhad to stay up, and sleep up there and make our bed and all this. I mean, which young\nperson doesn't like this? The whole image of the Jew has changed 1n our mind and we said,\n\u201cGod, it's beautiful.\u201d\u201d And when we were in danger, they were the ones who led us out of\ndanger. I remember once I was up in the BorzsOny mountains in Hungary in a self-defense\ncamp for a week and somebody betrayed us to the police and the police surrounded us and\nthere was a creek, not deeper, I don't think it was deeper than maybe twenty inches, and\nguess who is the one who escaped from the creek in order to do something, not to save his\nown skin, but he was immediately telephoning and all this and that and eventually we were\nreleased. The Israeli whatever, diplomat, I can't call them, the diplomat is not the right word\nbecause you picture somebody, you know, with a tie and suit and all this, but they were just,\nI, messengers or whatever, leaders. And he escaped, he escaped in that creek, crawling in\ntwenty inch of water, you know, getting on something that blend in with the, with the rocks,\nI mean they were unbelievable, unbelievable people. And women, you know, it's, it's, okay,\nafter them the women came and, I mean this is a completely different Jew. I mean, and\nwhen I took my wife to Israel, she understood that, that there was just something about those\nkids. And so this, this, of course, was, they were idols and it was very easy to follow them.\nAnd they were, they were not really demagogues, I remember quite a few of them who got\nquite introverted, they were not giving you big speeches or something, but by personal\nexample, they were leaders because we followed them. So the, the bus going back to my\nescape from Hungary, the bus eventually reached Vacz and, needless to say, it didn't stop\nthere. Beyond Vacz, it became quite dark and our leader suggested to the bus driver that we\nstop somewhere and eat and there was a roadside pub where they also served food. We went\nin and we were given money and we could order something, and in that pub, there was a\nvery beautiful peasant woman, with I don't know how many skirts on her, this was the reason\nyou recognize a peasant woman, in those days they still wore a lot of skirts, you know, that's\nan Eastern European costume that a dozen skirts is no big deal. And she started to flirt with\nthe bus driver. And soon the bus driver came, went over to her table, and they had a good\ntime and, of course, we were getting more and more anxious that this is going to create a big\nproblem here, right? We knew that we were on a timetable. All of a sudden, the bus driver\nsaid to our leader, \u201cHow long do you think we will be here?\u201d And our leader said, \u201cWell, all\nthese kids eat, oh, a half an hour, forty-five minutes.\u201d He said, \u201cGood, I'll be back.\u201d and left\nwith the woman. We ate, and our leader said, \u201cOkay, line up outside.\u201d And instead of going\nback to the bus, he led us down on a field into a big barn, I would say about one mile down\nin a muddy field, 1t was February and snow and mud everywhere. We all got into the barn,\nabout thirty of us, they closed the doors, barn doors, and he said, \u201cOkay, don't worry.\nEverything will be okay.\u201d After midnight, 1:00 or so, the barn door opened and we were,\nthey said we have to get on line and marched down, there was the river Ipoly, I-P-O-L-Y,\nand that was the border between Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The Austrian border was\nalready sealed, but the Czechs still let Zionist groups come over, it was kind of an\narrangement, the Joint did it for a lot of money, however, they didn't know which border,\nCzech border guard was a communist or not, so we have to be very careful. And once we\nwent beyond the border guards, everything was organized there, I will go back to this. So as\nwe were marching down, I saw a woman in a leather jacket with a revolver hanging on her\nhip in blue jeans. I looked at this woman's face, said, \u201cHey, I have seen her before.\u201d And I\nlooked and said, \u201cThis is the woman in the pub.\u201d This is to show you how organized they\nwere. I mean, the Germans couldn't have done better, really, with their devilish organization.\nI mean, everything, if you understood the whole, they called it aliyah, the going of, to Israel.\nIf you understood that, how they did it, you can understand how they could survive. All\nright? Surrounded by, of course, a sea of enemies. Once we got down to the river, we had to\ntake our shoes off, and we kept everything on our head, the river was not high enough, we\ncouldn't swim, so we had to walk, but I was very small, and it got to my throat at one time.\nNow this is February, imagine. We got over to the other side and it was supposed to be that\nthe border guards change, everything was according to the clock, and something happened\nand the border guards did not change the way they were supposed to, they were still talking\nto each other. There was snow on the ground and the dogs, their dogs were barking, so we\nhad to lie down on the snow for about a half an hour, wet. And many of us got sick, right\nthere. I myself, I lost, I got frostbitten and even today I suffer for that. Now, then the border\nguards finally were gone and we went up, there was a house where they used to press grapes,\nit was a grape growing region, but had no roof and the wind was blowing and I remember, I\ndon't think I have ever been colder in my life since then. And so we huddled together\nbecause now we missed the truck that was supposed to pick us up right down on a highway\nbeyond that hill, so the Israelis, the two Israelis, a man and a woman who were leading us,\nthey went down and eventually, in about four or five hours, they located the truck, the truck\ncame back, the truck was looking for us and then left and then, anyway the truck came back,\nwe got up on the truck, the canvas, the top was taken down, and from there on, all we heard\nwas the engine of the truck was occasionally, when they were halted and the word dollar, the\nword dollar came back all the time, I remember that.\nEnd of Tape 5, Side B\nTape 6, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Robert Holczer. So you'll say something about\nthe group of people that you were with.",
        "A: I, my best friend in that group was a young man by the name of Zev Rotics. He lives in\nIsrael at this time still, in Haifa, at Rehov Shunamit 14, and we correspond monthly, we have\nbeen ever since, ever since that time, and eventually when I left Israel, we corresponded, we\nkept up and I consider him my best friend. He's about the only person I keep up with. Oh\nno, there was one, another, a man by the name of Nissan Meschel, and I have no, he is in\ntouch with my friend, Zev Rotics, but I lost touch with him, so I have no idea what\nhappened, I just know that he's living there. But the others, the, I remember one young lady\nwho was with us and she, unfortunately, had eventually pneumonia when we got to Vienna,\nwhich I will go back to when I continue the story of the journey, and died in Vienna of\npneumonia, and she's buried there somewhere in the cemetery and I always planned to go\nand visit her, but I always run out of time and I don't know where she is buried, probably\nthere is no more than one Jewish cemetery, so when I go back to Israel I'm going to find out\nbecause my wife... Zev Rotics, sometimes he goes to the meetings of our old friends and so\nhe would know. Now, after the truck finally stopped in Bratislava. In Bratislava they took\nus to the gendarmerie where, as a formality, we were arrested, and interned in the synagogue,\nthey took us to the synagogue that had already warm rooms, straw on the floor, blankets,\ngood food, everything, and we were told that next morning we are going on. And it was\nvery strange because next morning, again, the gendarmerie surrounded the synagogue, it was\na big show, of course, all just in case some Soviet authority is watching. And they took us to\nthe railroad station where we were taken in boxcars, how interesting, locked up, quite a few\npeople in boxcars, and the train started and I think within an hour or so, they opened up and\nwe were in the American sector of Vienna. Because Bratislava is very close to Vienna. We\nstayed in Vienna for, I think, two, one or two weeks, and in an American hospital, that's\nwhere the Joint somehow got an American hospital for the Zionist members and we were all\nthere and we were given good food and warm rooms and it was very pleasant, the only thing\nwe were always warned about, not to ever wander into the Soviet section. We were free to\nwander around, the city was still divided into four sections, American, British, French and\nSoviet. And sometimes we had to go very close to the Soviet section in going to, I\nremember going to a swimming pool, it was on the edge, and so everybody was nervous.\nBut, basically, it was a good time. Vienna was full of refugees, full of life. After one week\nor so, then we were taken across, again by trucks, across the Alps into, no I have to correct\nmyself, to, not to Austria, to a, a,a UNRRA camp, UNRRA was the United Nations Refugee\nAssociation or something, so the joint gave us temporarily over to UNRRA and we were\nhoused in a beautiful area of the Alps in a town called Zaalfelden. It is a, on a lake, just the\nother side from Germany, and there were some very picturesque villages nearby, and I\nremember even though here the food was very meager and we still were hiking almost every\nday and going up in the mountains, and I remember that just above our camp, our refugee\ncamp, there was a place, a mountain hut where Hitler and Mussolini met and we had to see it\nand sometimes a cabbage soup a day just didn't give us enough energy, but we were still\npushing for it, we wanted to see it. We stayed here, again, one or two weeks and then on,\nagain, now over the border to Italy. In Italy, they took us again to the train station,\nsomewhere in northern Italy, and the train then was closed up and sealed, but regular train,\nwe just could not leave the train, Italian detectives were on the train to make sure that\nnobody escapes because it was ridiculous because who wants to escape to Italy, at least at\nthat ttme? And we were taken down to Bari. Now, the only thing that stands out in my mind\nwas that a lot of times when the train stopped, we, of course, rolled the windows down and\nthe good looking girls among us ended up with dozens of pictures from Italian men, written\non it, I love you, I'm going to marry you and all this, by the time we got to Bari, I think the\ngirls were exchanging pictures and who wanted this one and this one? I mean it was a funny\nthing to see that those men were really just instantly falling in love with these girls. In Bari,\na ship was waiting for us, if you could call it a ship. It was called the Galil, Galilea or\nGalilee, I forgot exactly, and so we boarded the ship and in two days or three days, 1t must\nhave been three I think, we were going to reach Haifa. Everybody got sea sick, the boat was\nan old, old fishing boat that the Israeli government brought from, bought from Greece and it\nwas a primitive thing, very primitive. And I know I have a very strong will and I don't want\nto, you know, go back to that, to the story, but I never throw up, somehow I just psych\nmyself up ever since I was a little kid as a result of an incident that I would not throw up.\nAnd I remember I was the only one on the ship who could eat. Everybody else was just\nconstantly throwing up and so we arrived, by the time we arrived in Haifa, everybody was\njust yellow and green and wouldn\u2019t want to look at food. Now, the funny thing about this\nship is that a few years ago I was travelling in France with my wife and we stopped in the\nLoire valley in a small little town, Blois, and as we were walking in the town there was a\nkind of a summer suit that I wanted to buy, it was very inexpensive and I needed a summer\nsuit for wearing on some occasion that I have to wear a suit and I went into the shop and I\nwas trying on the suit when the owner of the shop all of a sudden yelled and said, \u201cShalom\nhaver.\u201d And it appears he was talking to my wife and somehow it came that he was a\nMoroccan Jew and he was telling, I think, my wife that he was a Moroccan Jew and all this,\nbecause he had a definite Arabic name. And so my wife, I think, told him that I was Jewish,\ntoo you know, and this, so he invited us after the deal\u2014which was a good one\u2014he invited\nus to a bar down on the street, an outdoor caf\u00e9, to drink something with him. And during the\nconversation he asked me a little bit about my life and he said to, and I asked him and he\nsaid, \u201cOh, I was in Israel, I was a sailor.\u201d I said, \u201cWhere did you sail?\u201d He said, In the\nMediterranean, of course,\u201d and I said, \u201cWhat ship?\u201d He said, \u201cThe Galilea.\u201d\u2019 \u201cWhat time?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cFrom 1948 to 1950 something.\u201d Well, he was on that ship, you know, and I mean\nit was a small ship and he was one of the sailors. Well, when we arrived in Haifa, of course,\nthat was a very emotional scene and then eventually, the war, basically, was finished and\nthere was no temporary animosity so then we, our movement went to a kibbutz there where\nwe then blended in and one year after we were taught a trade in the kibbutz and we got our\nown land then. I don't know what else you want to know about the Israeli thing.",
        "Q: Everyone from your group then who was travelling together went to the same kibbutz?",
        "A: Yes, everyone went to the same kibbutz except the ones who did not want to go to the\nkibbutz, had relatives who were waiting for them and this was a little bit of a disappointment\nto us because theoretically, everybody was supposed to stay together, but this was not the\ncase. There were, not everybody wants to live in a kibbutz because it is a very difficult\nliving for those who dream of money and wealth and their own car and all this because it's a,\nat that time it was a very perfect community, but it was a community, you didn't have a great\ndeal that you owned at all, you know, you were lucky if you had a radio that you can call\nyour own. So we lost, I would say, about one-third of our group who had planned, but not\nshared their plan with us, to go immediately and stay on the outside.",
        "Q: How was it decided that your group would go to a kibbutz, was it decided communally\namong the group or did someone else decide it for you?",
        "A: All Zionist youth organizations basically, with very little exception, very few exceptions,\nwere geared toward the kibbutz. This was an understanding back in Eastern Europe where\nwe were recruited that Israel, and they always brought the example of the pyramid, that the,\nwe Jews, we always like a pyramid on the top, we had all the, the farmers, and down at the\nbottom where the pyramid is the largest, we had all the intellectuals, and Israel needed a\npyramid upside down, where the largest group is going to be the farmers and the agricultural\ngroup, and the smallest one is going to be the intellectuals, the tip of the pyramid. So almost\nevery Zionist organization, that was the very strong influence and educational goal to teach\nyou to go and be a farmer in a collective, you know? So that was the reason why most of us\ndid go to a kibbutz. And who decided it? It was decided above, that had nothing to do with\nus, where we would go, we were assigned to an old kibbutz, very old, experienced, large\nkibbutz, called Givat Chajim, in Israel which is in, about midway between Haifa and Tel\nAviv and this is where we learned our trade for one year, we stayed there for one year.",
        "Q: Did you speak any Hebrew at all?",
        "A: We did not speak any Hebrew when we arrived there, most of us didn't speak any Hebrew,\nexcept the ones who came from very religious families. They knew quite a bit and for them\nit was much easier to learn, we spoke no Yiddish because Hungarians do not speak,\nHungarian Jews, very few Hungarian Jews speak Yiddish, and so at first we felt a little bit\nkind of ostracized by the community, especially the young Israeli kids. There were so many\nHungarians coming in at that time that the Hungarians even had a nickname in Israel, they\nwere called Igen-Migen, Igen means yes in Hungarian and so kids would go after us on the\nstreet and call us Igen-Migen, Igen-Migen, because they heard us speak. And so we were in\na big hurry to learn Hebrew. And then when we learned Hebrew, we had another thing, the\nHungarian language is such that your accent stays with you no matter what language you\nlearn, and so we had a very thick accent, even when we were speaking Hebrew, so we had\nour difficulties with the language, but most of us learned it eventually. I was there in Israel\nfor two years and by the time I came home, I was really speaking fluently.",
        "Q: What trade did you learn on this kibbutz?",
        "A: Okay, I was a tractor driver in the kibbutz and worked out plowing everything connected\nwith the tractor, it was called a Falha, that particular branch, and from sacking, you know,\nflours and up to plowing and then seeding and cultivating, we had, we did everything. Then\nwe got our own land, own piece of land, which was a reclaimed area on the train line\nbetween Tel Aviv and Haifa, it was the, the, the Israel and Jordan swapped land and so\nJordan give back a piece of land so the train service can go from Tel Aviv to Haifa because\npart of the train line was in Jordan. This was the land that we received, and it was a very\ndangerous place, so when we, the first day we went out there, I remember, was really hair\nraising because the tractor drivers had to go down and plow and the, the weed in Israel is\nmuch higher than a human being and also we didn't know where the mines, if there were any\nmines. And even though the army supported us and they did give us, you know, generous\nsupport there, we the tractor drivers had to go down and practically open up the area. And so\nwe were very respected in the kibbutz for that reason. Above us was an Arab town, Tul\nKarem, which today is under Israeli occupation and still a very hot spot for riots. And I\nremember that Arab town practically you could see the people on the street, and here we\nwere on the other side living, you know, two enemies and of course, I had a lot of adventures\nbecause of living on the border, but then again, that has not much to do with the Holocaust\nand I am sure that the Holocaust Museum has a lot of testimonies from Israelis so they don't\nneed. I don't know, but that's up to you, but I have a lot of stories that came to us as a result\nof living so close at that time, back in 1948, 1949, on the border, you know.",
        "Q: I'd be interested in hearing how, what kinds of relations or encounters you had with Arabs in\nthat area.",
        "A: Well, when we first showed up, when we first showed up, the first day, there were Arab\nshepherds down on the other side of the barbed wire, the border was just marked with a\nbunch of barbed wire. And when they saw us, they emitted a sound like woo-woo-woo, and\nthey were running away, they were just scared to death. These were shepherds, very poor\npeople, and we didn't know exactly who they were, but we learned eventually, that they\nwere, they were working for the local, you know, sheik or whomever owns the land for very\nlittle. And eventually, we also saw that here on this side of the border we are plowing with\nup-to-date 20\"-century machinery and we saw not far from us, a man on a horseback\nwhipping people just because they did something apparently that did not please them. The\nowner of the land had practically complete jurisdiction over these poor fellows, and that was\njust a few hundred yards from where we were working. As they got used to us, they came\ncloser and closer and when they saw that we don't mean any harm, they came down to the\nbarbed wire many times, watching to make sure that nobody sees them and tried to make\nfriends with us and we did make friends with them for, the main reason is that chocolate was\nvery expensive in Israel those days, cocoa, and we already had quite a few children in our\ngroup, babies. Cigarettes were very expensive for some reason in Jordan and they were very\ncheap in Israel, American cigarettes. So they asked, oh, these people offered us a deal, but\nthey did not want to do it during the day because they were afraid that the... Jordan had the\nbest military force, the Arab Legion, trained by the British and they were afraid that they\nwere patrolling there and all this and it was a serious crime to deal with, with Israelis. So at\nnight in the darkness, and I remember it was my turn, too, it was always a few people and\nalways the tractor drivers because we had the contact with the border people, we went down\nbecause they would recognize us and it was a very risky thing, they could have just shot me\ndead right there, it could have been a trap. We went down and we were doing all the\nbusiness, they jumped over or we went over, but mainly they came over because they were\nmuch better fence jumpers than we were. So this was one contact that we had. The other\none was not so pleasant, these wadis, dry river beds, that run across, they don't recognize\nborders, they run, you know, back and forth, Israel, Jordan, and in, when they are dry which\nis most of the time, this 1s where the Arab thieves come over, they use these river beds\nbecause you can't see them, they are, you know, they are like little canyons. And they would\ncome over in these river beds and go into other areas and steal, mainly animals. And they\nwere unbelievably good thieves. They would steal, they can, they would steal a cattle, they\nwould steal a donkey, they would steal a horse surrounded by walls. Nobody could ever\nfigure out how they did it. So the army hired us to be kind of a paramilitary force and go out\nand lie, so we had to lie down in the wadis and a few of us, we didn't have very good guns,\nwe had old Czech guns, and wait for these thieves to come. And I only had one occasion\nwhen three of us were in a patrol and there were about fifteen or twenty of these coming by\nand we didn't feel like getting murdered by them because what chances do we have? And so\nwe let them go by and then reported to the border police that they went by, but we didn't\nwant to engage in any fire fight there. Now, my good experience was with the Jordanian\nLegion, which then eventually had also a sad ending. All of a sudden one day we were, I\nwas plowing I remember, and I had to have always a guard on my tractor with a submachine\ngun who was constantly casing and watching because I was so close to the border and this\nwas a friend of mine one day who was a guard in an Arab POW camp, an Israeli POW camp,\nguarding Arabs during the War of Independence, so he learned some Arabic from them.\nAnd you will see why this is important, and all of a sudden we saw some, an Arab Legion\npatrol right by the barbed wire and they were motioning to us to come down and we said no,\nyou know. And so they went away. Next day they came and again they were motioning,\nthey said, \u201cPeace, peace.\u201d\u2019 So finally they went back about fifty yards and they put their guns\ninto a pile and then came back, showing that they had no weapons and they told us, \u201cSit\ndown on that side of the border. What can we do?\u201d They were about twelve, if they really\nwanted to kill us, we said, \u201cOkay, let's go down. What do they want?\u201d They just wanted to\ntalk to us and from there on, every day they would come down at a certain time and\neventually they, the Arabs have watermelon all over, so it was like a party, they would yell at\none of these poor fellows who was working there and I, this is all I learned in Arabic, what it\nis, \u201cHey, bring me a watermelon.\u201d Yalla Jibbu Battiyah. And they brought a watermelon\nand they would slice it and we were eating, almost every day we had a little lunch there\ntogether, we brought some stuff. And this went on for weeks and weeks and weeks and\nweeks. And eventually we really fooled our countries because sometimes they came over\nand ate and laughed that they ate in Israel and sometimes we jumped over and we said, \u201cOh,\nwe ate in Jordan.\u201d And one day it was our turn, we stopped the tractor, they haven't come\ndown yet so we were waiting for them, but we were already sitting on the other side, we had\na little blanket, we put it down, all the food from our kitchen and all of a sudden a patrol is\nthere, but it is a totally different patrol. What happened, apparently somebody saw them and\nreported them, I don't know what ever happened, I never saw them again and these guys\nwere, they drew their guns and they are going to shoot us. And you know that border was no\njoke, every night somebody was killed there, either an Israeli or an Arab. Very innocent\npeople, you know, sometimes a, one night I felt so badly, a young couple, lovers, were\nwalking around and apparently they were in the wrong place and an Israeli guard, and most\nof the Israeli border guards were from Arab countries, Arab Jews, well, not Arab, that sounds\nkind of strange, but Jews from Arab countries, and they were vicious. I mean, you could not\nget better border guards and they were, they hated the Arabs more than we hated the Nazis.\nAnd so they were, they were, they saw one at night, they were shooting sometimes for no\nreason. So that was a very poisonous atmosphere there, and I mean it took a long time and\nthe fact that my friend spoke some Arabic and all this and mitigated the situation, but then\nthe man said, \u201cHow come you speak some Arabic? Where did you learn it?\u2019 And then he\nhad to kind of, so finally the sergeant who was leading all them, always a master sergeant\nleading the patrol, he said, \u201c\u201cYou have one luck that I have a son of your age.\u201d He said, \u201cIf I\never see you even down touching the barbed wire,\u201d he said, \u201cI am going to just make dust\nout of you.\u201d And of course, we never went back again. That was, these are some\nexperiences living on the border.",
        "Q: Do you remember what you would talk about with these, with the guards before they were\ntaken away?",
        "A: Well, it was a very simple conversation because we had a language problem, it was mainly\nsign language quite a bit, and we were talking about, basically, these people were talking\nabout their children, they showed pictures of their families and the word peace, Salaam or\nShalom in Hebrew, was constantly mentioned. And I have a feeling that all of us involved,\nprobably, if they are, hopefully they are alive, will always remember this and that kind of\nsoftened us up, so we know that human beings can relax under certain circumstances and we\ndon't have to be enemies. It was the first time that I realized that an Arab can, doesn't\nnecessarily have to be my opponent, you know\u2019?",
        "Q: How many people were members of this kibbutz?",
        "A: About a hundred, about a hundred, and all from Hungary. But other kibbutzim had\nsometimes mixed.\nEnd of Tape 6, Side A\nTape 6, Side B",
        "Q: Okay, this is tape two, side B of an interview with Robert Holczer. Did you find that your\ndream of Israel was fulfilled, the utopian ideal that you had and some of your, your thirst for\na place where you felt you belonged, was fulfilled there?",
        "A: At first I was very, very idealistic. Then somehow, I felt a little bit disappointed where in\nour kibbutz, all kinds of political groups tried to kind of tear us apart. And there were more\nand more arguments and somehow this and the fact that as the country settled down into so-\ncalled peace, if we can call it, the usual symptoms that every nation in the world experiences,\nsurfaced, such as crime and... but the fact that there were Jewish criminals, that shocked me.\nYou know, I was so naive that I thought that anybody goes to Israel, certainly doesn't want\nto do anything to hurt another human being. There were even, even murderers, and I just\none day after another, these things, they added to my little disappointment, but I was still\nenjoying myself because I love to be outdoors and we, we did the physical work and it was\nall that a young person wants for self-image, good self-image, we had a very good self-image\nof ourselves. There were two things that contributed to my, to my coming, going back to\nHungary eventually in '51. One was, all of a sudden I realized that I, in all my life I loved\nmy father very, very much, and this 1s a, I mean it's a fact, there is nothing you can do about\nit, I loved my father more than I loved my mother. Somehow I always considered my\nmother a little bit of a, of a kind of petit bourgeois that I never really completely understood.\nAnd I thought that she was a little bit, she was just in another, in other words, she wanted\nme to be also, you know, like she was, and play the piano and all these things and I was not\nthe type. So I was not that close to her even though I was with her all the time and\npractically, I was also instrumental in saving her life in the war when I dragged her with me\neverywhere and all this, but my father, and I realized I spent very little time with my father\nas a young man because he was always away in, in the concentration camp. And now he\nwas home and now they couldn't come any more, Hungary was sealed. And then I also, at\nthe age of nineteen, became somehow involved with a group of cynical people. And I met\nthem here and there and some of them I knew from Hungary and they were married to this\nand this, I just somehow was under the influence of these who saw nothing nice any more in\nIsrael except the bad things. This, the homesickness plus the fact that then I began to get all\nkinds of propaganda material from Hungary and somehow, this was the third thing, I was\nmisled by all this, what I read, and I thought that the situation changed and Hungary is such a\nmarvelous country today. And my parents tried to communicate to me, even though they\nnever wanted me to really go away, but now they didn't want me to really come home, they\nwere afraid what would happen to me. And that, they just apparently didn't come across\nquite well because I, eventually I just decided I want to go back to Hungary, and probably\nhomesickness had a great deal to do, I, at that time as a young man, I didn't realize that you\ncan't go home again, you know? I envisioned that everything is going to be back and all this.\nWell, I then applied to the Hungarian Embassy, got a permit and the Israelis, of course,\ndidn\u2019t keep me there, and in 1951, I returned to Hungary. And those were the worst years,\naside from October 15th, those years were the worst years of my life, the next two or three\nyears.",
        "Q: Before we go into more details about that, you mentioned that you found the Israelis very\nwell organized as you were escaping from Hungary. When you arrived in the kibbutz, did\nyou, did you share the feeling that the way that the kibbutz was organized was, was very\ngood and smooth and, did you have any observations about that?",
        "A: The kibbutz was also very well organized, this was an old kibbutz and it was like a clock\nwork. Also, there was a hierarchy which naturally some people didn't understand, but I had\nno argument with that because I realized a person who came here fifty years ago when there\nwas nothing here except rocks and Arabs shooting at them, has, 1s more equal, right, than\nsomebody who arrives here today. It was well run, it was a wealthy kibbutz, there was very\ngood food, there was culture, they made sure that orchestras are coming, good ones,\nentertainment, no, I had absolutely no feeling of let down in this respect. No, I admired the\nway they carried on. Just a little, just a little thing that shows that how they thought of\neverything: shoveling manure, for example, of course, not something that somebody wants\nto do for the rest of his or her life, so or washing dishes in the kitchen, so there were, there\nwere certain things in the kibbutz that it was not a, an area where you were assigned\npermanently, they were temporary. And so everybody knew that once in a month I have to\nshovel manure and once a month or twice a month, I have to wash the dishes, so, there were\nsome other, but even this was taken care of, you know, I think in a very human manner.",
        "Q: Did you have dreams or ideas of what exactly you would be doing when you went back to\nHungary, was that... was your sense of where you wanted to go in your life very developed?",
        "A: I was naively thinking about going to the university and continuing with my education to\nbecome a teacher, a high school teacher, and so I went back through the Bosporus, Turkey,\nBlack Sea, Romania and then Hungary. Travelling through Romania by train, in 1949,\nexcuse me, 1951, was quite an experience, the people just looked at me, looked at me and\nsince there are quite a few Hungarians in Romania, I then... eventually they found out that I\nspeak Hungarian, so there was always a Hungarian there and asked me and I very naively\ngive all the details of my life and all this and that, and I didn't understand why they looked at\nme, just looked at me, just looked at me, and also Romania was tremendously gray and I\ncould only think of 1984, going across Romania. And that was only the beginning, 1951,\nyou know?",
        "Q: You're referring to the book, 1984?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: You're referring to the book?",
        "A: Yes, I refer to the book 1984, or the movie rather, okay? It's the same thing, but the movie 1s\nthe one that I always keep in my mind when I think of Romania. So I arrived on the\nHungarian border and here was an officer on the border looked at my papers and all this and\nhe, I'll never forget what he told me, he said to me, \u201cI don't know where you come from, but\nit must have been very bad, very bad there, that you come from.\u201d And he looked at me and\nsaid, \u201cWelcome to Hungary.\u201d And this was a border guard officer. And I thought this 1s a\nstrange thing, what does it mean? Well, I learned very quickly. When I boarded the train\nagain on the other side of the border, it was just as gray as coming through Romania and then\nfinally when I arrived home, I looked around, I realized that I was totally, totally misled.\nNever have I been misled before or after the way I was. I arrived there and it was the\ngrayest, most colorless, most suspicious, paranoid society you can imagine. And my bad\nperiod started with, of course, not being able to get a job, any job, there was no one, going to\nthe university, of course, was ridiculous to think about because I was an unreliable element, I\ncame home, number one, from the West, I was an imperialist agent, as far as they were\nconcerned, not only that, I was a Zionist imperialist agent. And it took me almost six month\nto get a job to sweep a floor, to sweep floors and clean oil off the concrete in a garage, in a\nstate-owned garage.",
        "Q: How did you get the job?",
        "A: With great connections, the fact that my father was from the working class and many of his\nbrothers and their friends were involved, but mainly their friends of where they come from,\nthis suburb of Hungary, a very poor one, suburb of Budapest, where now the communist\nofficials with great connections, but nobody wanted any names, nobody wanted to stick out\ntheir neck, they just somehow pushed some paperwork somewhere and I was an, kind of an\nauxiliary labor help, a no name person whom they hired because they needed somebody to\nclean something. And that was the only job I could get. What hurt me even more was the\nfact that my good friends on the street, some of them who stayed in Hungary, not too many\nbecause most of them escaped, but they would not want anything to do with me because\nmost people didn't want to touch me, didn't want to talk to me, they don't know me, they\nrather would go to the other side of the street than to meet me. Some probably out of disgust\nthat how stupid a human being can be to come back to this, and others for fear.",
        "Q: Because you had been in Israel?",
        "A: Yes, yes, because I had been out, it doesn't have to be, it didn't have to be Israel, anyone, it\nwas a totally paranoid society, everything that happened in the Soviet Union was copied the\nnext day, you know. So the, I worked in this garage for about six month and I always\nnoticed with great nostalgia, how they have these posters about urging workers to go to\ncollege and I wanted to go to college, and I went to the Party secretary of the firm which had\nabout twelve garages, had to sign a paper that recommends you to go to the next step and\nevery time I went to see him, he laughed at me, he said, \u201c\u201cYou know that you are here by the\ngrace of a few people and not, you have no merits to go there.\u201d So the, my break came when\nthe secretary became very ill, the Party secretary of the firm, and they sent out a temporary\nParty secretary, and she was a woman, she was very busy when I entered, you know, dirty\nand overalls and all this, and when I told her what I wanted, I got an, this opportunity and\ntry, now, when I told her what I wanted, she said, \u201cWell, I don't have time to write you a\nrecommendation. I'm glad that a worker wants to go to college, we need working youth,\nwhy don't you dictate what you need to my secretary and I will just sign it.\u201d So I passed the\nfirst hurdle, with this I went to the university where I had to submit this. This was a\ncommittee, they interviewed you and they read your, you had to write your, your biography,\nautobiography for everything, everything. So here was a committee, admitting committee,\nthe Young Communist League, the Communist Party, one from the faculty, et cetera, about,\nI would say, seven, eight people. And when they got to certain points, they said, \u201cCome on,\nyou must be joking that you really think that, you know, you can come here.\u201d Well, I left\nand as I was going out a man whose name was Mr. Bartos, he was on the faculty, this was\nthe Hungarian Teachers Academy, this was the university where I wanted to go, it was called\nthe Teachers Academy, but it was part of the university. He came out and he said, \u201cHolczer,\nHolczer, didn't your father play on a certain soccer team?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201cDidn't\nyour father have four or five brothers playing on the same soccer team?\u201d And he said,\n\u201cYes.\u201d And he said, \u201cOkay, come back in September and see, maybe since you were a\nminor when you left the country, I will try and write to the Ministry of Education, maybe\nsomething can be done.\u201d Well, I was holding my breath for three months, I went back in\nSeptember and I went into the Party secretary's office, they had no idea who I was, they\ncouldn't find any paper, anything, so I was looking for him. And I found him and he said,\n\u201cJust a second.\u201d He went into the Party secretary, he came out a few minutes later and he\nsaid, \u201cI am very happy to inform you that the Minister of Education, on the basis that you\nwere a minor when you left Hungary, give you special permission to enter the university.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cNow, this was the last time you ever talk to me, you ever looked at me, you\never even thought that we have anything to do with each other. Never again.\u201d He said,\n\u201cThat is the price. You understand?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d Said, \u201cand say hello to your dad.\u201d That\nwas it. I went home, my father remembered him, they played on the same team. And he was\nthe head of the physical education branch of the faculty, you know? And this is how I got in.\nAnd I had a very, very good time because I found out ninety-nine percent of the kids\nthought the same way as I did and there were very few communists, very few. And yet,\nwhen it came to 1953, I almost was, I was thrown out for about one week. Stalin was dying\nand when he, in his last breath, he looked up, he saw doctors around him and he was\nparanoia, he said, \u201cWho are these?\u201d They said, \u201cDoctors.\u201d And Stalin was very anti-Semitic\nand he said, \u201cAre they Jewish doctors?\u201d And I think, out of twelve or so, seven or eight\nwere Jewish, they said, \u201cYes.\u201d They said, \u201cArrest them.\u201d And they were, all the doctors\naround Stalin were arrested a few days before he died. And then, when this happened, in\nHungary, too, they were looking for Jewish doctors or anybody who was, had anything to do\nwith Zionists because they called them the Zionist conspiracy against Stalin and they found\nme at the college. They had to, since this was a chain reaction, that went down. So they\nfound me and they told me to go home and that I am a Zionist this and Zionist that. And\nStalin died three days later and I mean, I was just heartbroken because it was before exams\nand all this and it was in March and I was ready to take my exams soon and then when\neverything died, died down, and the so-called Thaw, this is what they called it politically, the\nThaw started, then they called me back and they said forget about the whole thing and\ncontinue.",
        "Q: You mentioned in the last tape that your father had, after he returned from Bor, he was\nappointed on a committee for housing?",
        "A: Mmm-hmm.",
        "Q: What, what happened with his work, with his career, did he remain on that committee after\nthe communist takeover, or did he continue, you also mentioned that he went back to work\nfor his former employer, did he continue to work for this former employer? What became of\nhis career?",
        "A: My father's former employers, either died or escaped in 1947 or 1948, to the West, so this,\nwhat I mentioned, was a volunteer work. Everybody, basically, had to volunteer to do\nsomething. This was volunteer work, he volunteered to be appointed to this position and this\nwas not a paid job. And it did not require a great deal of his time. He immediately looked\nfor some opportunity and started to work for a co-op, a lot of co-ops started and what co-ops\nwere are a group of people who banded together and formed a what you would call a, maybe\na small enterprise, as long as they worked under the ruse of a cooperation and everything\nwas divided, the profit if there was any, and they paid their taxes to the state, this was what\nthe communists considered kind of a happy in-between of state farms or state enterprise and\nprivate enterprise. Because private enterprise was phased out gradually, except in cases such\nas a Shoe maker that, you know, repairs shoes, but even for that, eventually, they had co-ops,\nshoemaker co-ops or tailor co-ops or this, but a few, a few of those branches, that you could\nnot really work any other way except in a co-op, but he was working for a co-op where he\nrose eventually, he was a very smart man, and he rose to be kind of a midlevel manager, but\nalso working and this co-op was working with a lot of women who would then get the\nmerchandise and do it at home. They were making shopping nets and shopping bags and\nthings like that that anybody can do on a sewing machine at home. And then they would\nbring it in and so actually they had a very, a very small area, a very small base and just a\nwarehouse and he enjoyed this, he enjoyed it and he was very much liked. The only problem\nhe had occasionally is that they asked him, because he was such a good worker, and he\nreceived all kinds of awards that he didn't really want particularly because he was not very,\nyou know, infatuated with the communist system, they always wanted him to join the Party\nbecause he was a perfect, what they called cadre, cadre, he comes from the working class, he\nwas a hard-working man, he was an honest man, he rose from nothing to a midlevel\nmanager, so he was an ideal person. But he never joined, he always said, \u201cNo, absolutely\nno.\u201d So that, he was such a good worker, they left him alone.",
        "Q: Did your mother have to start working?",
        "A: No, my mother was totally just a mother and a housewife, she never had any, any, and I can't\nremember my mother having, you know, political opinion or anything like that, she had\nother interests. She read a lot and went to the movies and she loved visiting around during\nthe day, she was kind of a social butterfly.",
        "Q: You mentioned that in school you were studying geography and history?",
        "A: Yes, that was my, in college, geography and history.",
        "Q: And that the other students who were in school with you were, were also didn't have a lot of\nsympathy for communism. Did you all get together with your classmates and did you, did\nyou talk about politics often, what was the mood like among your, your, your fellow\nstudents?",
        "A: Interestingly, with most people, you could talk politics. You know, eventually, throughout\nthese years, we isolated the ones who were suspicious to us and... because they were always\neager beaver Party workers and give big speeches and some of them did big speeches and we\nknew that we can still talk to them, they\u2019re just careerists and they just want to go ahead.\nBut I would say the great majority, even in the worst days, we could still discuss things.\nObviously, we didn't do it on the street, we didn't do it elsewhere except in our own home or\nin a restaurant where there was a lot of noise and they couldn't discern, you know, who says\nwhat. So in this respect, we did not really have a kind of a prison atmosphere in college.\nAnd our professors, I would say eighty percent of them were very much against the regime\nand occasionally they let that go in very, you know, ambiguous statements. We recognized\nit immediately and all this, but just to give you one example, most of us, we had to go to\nRussian instruction every day, most of us either didn't show up or if we did, we didn't listen,\nwe didn't learn anything, and after going through college, at the end you had to take a state\nexam. And I, the exam in Hungary at that time was you had to draw a written note on which\nyou had a topic. And you were given fifteen minutes to take notes on that topic from your\nmemory, you were given a pencil and some paper, and when you were called upon, this was\nyour turn and you could talk about, introduce your topic and there was a committee. And I\nwent to my Russian exam, and this happened to other people too, and I drew my topic and I\ncouldn't even read the title, let alone, couldn't read the title, I Just, in these years I just never\nbothered to read, to learn enough to read. Today of course, I'm not very proud of this,\nbecause now I know that the more languages you speak, you know, the more lives you have,\nbut those days, this was a political statement, they couldn't believe it, they just couldn't\nbelieve it because I was straight A in my subjects and so there was tremendous animosity\ntoward me from the police, from the Party secretary and all the others. Can we stop?\nEnd of Tape 6, Side B\nTape 7, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape three, side A of an interview with Robert Holczer. Do you want to continue with\nwhat you were saying about your. . .",
        "A: Oh, the Russian exam. And then I found out later that some of my classmates had the same\nproblem and, eventually, they decided not to, not to have us back, so they just gave us a D\nand they were very angry about it. But in a way it was their fault, too, because how could we\nget up to that point, going through all classes, didn\u2019t they realize that something 1s wrong?\nWell, this, I remember this very distinctly, that that was one way to show our reaction to\nwhat was going on. And otherwise, even the ones who were very active in the Communist\nParty, most of them always gave us a signal that this is all a show, there is nothing to worry\nabout. There were very few people. So when I left the college, at that time, you, I became a\nteacher and we were supposed to go to the countryside, they could not, you could not teach\nin Budapest the first year and I was then assigned to a little, small village, not far from Vacz,\nfrom my mother's birthplace, only a few miles and taught there for a year. And this was a\nsmall village of a minority, Hungary has very few minorities, but they have some Slovak\nminorities in the North, these were Slovaks and they speak, they spoke very little Hungarian,\nbut they would not admit it because they were afraid that there would be repercussion, so\nthey asked for a Hungarian teacher, they could have asked for a Slovak-speaking teacher,\ntoo. And it was quite an experience, but it has nothing to do with being Jewish or with the\nHolocaust, none of that came up, it was just a totally different one. And then after this year\nthat I spent in... I made contact again, I wanted to get back with a youth organization and I\nfound interestingly that the Communist Youth Organization, the Pioneer organization\nprobably could use me because, I mean I went through the boy scouts, I went through the\nZionists, I had some very definite ideas and I answered an ad and became a director of a\nsummer camp. They looked for a young teacher who, I had about twelve other young\nteachers with me and it was in Budapest, it was just a day camp, and it turned out to be such\na good experience that the local Communist Party secretary asked me if I would like to come\nand teach in the district. And I said, \u201cNaturally, this is it!\u201d And so I was transferred to, just\nto a suburb of Budapest and I taught there until the Revolution came and I escaped again.",
        "Q: When did you graduate from college?",
        "A: '53.",
        "Q: And so it was in '54?",
        "A: Yeah, the Revolution came in '56, okay, so. . .",
        "Q: So you taught for two years in a suburb of. . .",
        "A: Yeah, right. One year in the countryside and two years in this suburb. Junior high.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you were involved with the Democratic Teacher's Union at one point?",
        "A: During the Revolution, they asked me to organize a Democratic Teacher's Union. I was not\na Party member, they knew that I was not also an anti-Party member either because, and this\nI wanted to bring out and emphasize, that as a Jew in Hungary, you could never be truly an\nanti-communist because you knew one thing, as long as the Communist Party was in power,\nthere would be no pogroms and your life is safe. And this is what happened after\ncommunism, and communist fall, most of my relatives and friends who were in Hungary,\nthis was their greatest fear, that what will happen to them now. And anti-Semitism is now\nrampant in Eastern Europe, in Hungary, too. So this is just an interlude, I just wanted to say\nsomething about that. So I was just teaching in this suburb and until the Revolution and as a,\nand during the Revolution, they sent for me and they wanted me to get the Democratic\nTeachers Union together, various democratic organizations, and all this. And I came out to a\ncouple of briefings with people, with the local council, the town council, the district council\nand one day there was some fighting out there and I saw a bunch of people with armbands,\nthe Arrow Cross armbands. And I looked out the window and all my desire to ever do\nanything or to stay there, just went away. Right in that moment. I realized that this is now\nwhen I have to leave. Even though I had a very good life, the last three years, after I was\ntransferred to Budapest, I had a very, very good life, relatively speaking, you know? A good\nsalary, I started to write for the newspaper, the... stories about young people. I ran camps\nand financially, and I got all the recognition and awards and all this, I couldn't complain. But\nwhen I saw, when I saw that, the symbol, I went home and I said, \u201cThis 1s it. I will never\nreturn except to visit.\u201d\u201d And I told my parents, \u201cIn two weeks, I'm leaving.\u201d",
        "Q: Where did you, you mentioned that you had a, you had a real enthusiasm for working with\nyoung people and that seems to be something that you did for most of your adult life and at\nthe time, what, where did your, where did that enthusiasm come from and what, what were\nyou teaching, were you teaching them simply geography or were you trying to teach them a\nbroader range of things?",
        "A: Well, when I was transferred to Budapest, immediately I started to teach geography, they\nhad these so-called pioneer houses, these were buildings where the kids can come back in the\nafternoon and depending on their interests, join groups, study groups. And I was running the\ngeography group which was a lot of introduction and simulations of how a river is\nmeandering and then old river is meandering, a lot of tests, hands-on type of activities. I\ntook them to hike and I taught them how, orientation in nature and all, everything that was\nromantic in the boy scouts. And from this, I kind of organized a group of very enthusiastic\nkids who eventually would follow me anywhere, you know, and it appealed to me as a\nyoung, and I can still do that, and so then people saw this and they hired me to run big\ncamps. But I always neglected the political thing, that was not, I never really cared for the\npolitics, but I emphasized the romantic thing. I even wrote a book for the Pioneer movement\nand suggested a completely new uniform and emblems and all this, what kids love at that\nage, because the Pioneer uniform is the most, was the most impractical thing a child can\nhave. A white shirt, can you imagine, with dark blue pants and a red kerchief, I mean, and\nnothing on it, they were not, they couldn't have any emblem anything, so I said, \u201cNo, a child\nwants to see his or her achievements, right there, he or she wants to show it to the world.\u201d\nAnd so they were, they were giving me some free hand to do it and I did a lot of this,\nsubmitted it, it was accepted, so this is what I loved, that I could have some influence and\npush them away, mainly from politics, into romantic activities, you know, and that is the one,\nthat is, I think that pleased me a great deal. And eventually, it was a, I did it until the very\nlast day, until I left Hungary, and I still corresponded with many of my kids who were in my\ngroup as adults. And when I went back later on, ten years or fifteen years later, some of\nthese kids were running the same kind of camps and organizations and they always came and\nthey said, \u201cYou know, if you had told us that in the middle of the night we have to leave our\nhomes so that nobody will wake up and assemble in a place, we would have been up there.\nAnd we would have been following you all the way out to the border.\u201d I didn't tell them that\nI was leaving because I didn't want them to even have this silly idea, but after I left some of\nthem learned about it and three of them came after me and ended up in Switzerland, but\neventually went back to Hungary. So occasionally, when I am in Hungary, I do bump into\nthem and I go out and look up some, and those who were very nice to me, I always see. I\neven see the Communist Party secretary, the woman who was influential to get me, I took\nmy wife, too, to see her during the late \u201870s and early \u201880s, she and her husband, I just, they\nwere good people. They came from the old communist underground, you know? And\nthough we never talked about it, I'm sure they were just as disappointed in what happened to\nMarx ideas as most other people. But they would never discuss it because they were too\nloyal to the Party.",
        "Q: When 1956 came and some of the demonstrations started, were you intrigued in any way or\ndid you mainly feel concerned about the fascist elements that you were seeing? Did you go\nto the big demonstration on October 23rd?",
        "A: Yeah. I was on the street all the time because I believed that I have this, anybody, most\nHolocaust survivors have an intuition, have a, somehow, a sixth sense and we always wanted\nto read the crowd. The mood of the crowd. And so I was in the street all the time, watching\nwhat's happening, kind of sensing the undercurrent. I was like an animal and I knew that I\nknew exactly what was going on. And I knew that these people eventually could be up to no\ngood or quite a few of them could be up to no good because, you know, the leopard doesn't\nlose its spots and even though it all started with great democratic slogans, eventually after\ntwo weeks, it did disintegrate and there were a lot of fascist groups and I did not want to live\nunder Russian tanks, but I was glad, myself, that the Russian tanks came back. I just didn't\nwant to live under that system either, but at least it saved the lives of a lot of people because\nthere were ugly incidents. The Revolution started for two weeks, the first one week was\nkind of democratic and looked like democratic and the second week, just everything\ndisintegrated and the crowd went berserk and I didn't trust any of that any more.",
        "Q: You also mentioned that there was an extreme amount of anti-Semitism during that time.\nWould you just tell me some examples of what was going on?",
        "A: Well, unfortunately, after looking at all the countries where anti-Semitism is so rampant, has\nbeen and still 1s, I must conclude that all Catholic countries are that way in Eastern Europe,\nonly the Catholic countries. Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia, these are the countries\nwhere, and some of them have very little Jews, in Poland there are only a few thousand Jews\nleft. I have experienced anti-Semitism all the time, [coughs] excuse me, and even when I go\nhome nowadays to visit, well I haven't been to Hungary for the last three years, but the letters\nI receive from my relatives constantly refer to that and my family was never very much\ninterested in bringing this out because they are, rather, they consider themselves Hungarians,\nthe ones who are living in Hungary today and I'm always surprised that this is a main\nconcern to them, so apparently this situation has never changed. In 1919, Hungary became\nthe first fascist country of Europe, even before Hitler, and stayed that way, at least, even\ntoday under the current, the undercurrent is very anti-Semitic, the Jews are responsible for\neverything just like in the Middle Ages.",
        "Q: How long did you have to prepare to leave, you made the decision to leave and then, how\nlong did it take before you actually left and how did you make preparations?",
        "A: Well, the Revolution was defeated in the first week of November and it took me about ten to\nfourteen days to get going. I just wanted to say goodbye to my good friends and my family\nand also I had a cousin who wanted to come with me and I had to do a little preparation\nthere, too, because he was just a high school graduate and a very green fellow at that. And\neventually he brought his friend, so the three of us started out and in about ten, ten to\nfourteen days, I can't remember exactly, but no more than two weeks. I just wanted to see\nexactly what works, what doesn't work, how can I approach the border, the most practical\nway, a lot of people were practically there and then captured and brought back to Budapest.\nAnd the repercussion was nothing but still, you didn't want to go through all this and then in\nthe last second, just before you would go over to Austria, captured, you know, be captured,\nso I kind of did a little homework, that's all, and tried to think of the practical aspects of how\nto do that.\nEnd of Tape 7, Side B\nTape 8, Side A",

        "Q: It does?",
        "A: Yes. I... obviously I\u2019m not that devoted to Hungary. I\u2019m not a person who really believes\nmuch in national identity, you know, I just... I feel that cause more problems, that and\nreligion, than anything else, so I\u2019ve never been a patriot of basically any country, and\nthere... I still am not. So, does it sound all right?

        "A: You don\u2019t want to... although I can, you know, I can...",
        "Q: What we can...",
        "A: I\u2019m willing to say this on tape, too.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "Q: Yeah. Okay. It\u2019s March 17\", 1999, and we\u2019re in the home of Robert Holczer, in Paris,\nKentucky, and conducting an interview that\u2019s... that\u2019s based on his post-Holocaust life,\njust basically following up on... on a couple of other interviews we\u2019ve done for the\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and this interview is sponsored jointly by\nthe US Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Kentucky Oral History Commission. And\nI\u2019m Arwen Donahue, here we go. Well, I\u2019m curious, before we...",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: ...g0 into the chronology, to hear more about your theory of nations. Did... you were\ntalking a little earlier, just about how you really have an ambition of going back to\nHungary and finding the people who are living in the same house that you were during\nwar time. So, do you... but then again, you don\u2019t have a lot of strong feelings for\nHungary. Do you dislike going back, when you have visited? Or, how do you feel about\nvisiting there, even?",
        "A: Well...",
        "Q: Pll hold it.",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t mind visiting Hungary, but... and the reason I don\u2019t mind visiting, because\nI still have friends and some relatives I care to see and I care to be with. But, on the\nwhole, when I am there, I feel like a total stranger, which is not... which is not just\nbecause of what happened to me, it\u2019s also a tremendous generation gap. Most of the\npeople of my age, are... [dog barks] probably you have to stop that.",
        "Q: Yeah, I\u2019m wondering what... Hungary...",
        "A: Yes, that I... as I mentioned, I like to be with people, but the feeling of totally estranged, I\nrealize is not just what happened... because of what happened to me, but also because I\nam now a... I... reaching the age when most people are just not around any more. And I...\nit\u2019s a strange thing to walk through streets where you used to play, and you know that\nnobody is there any more from your previous life. However, when I hear some anti-\nSemitic remarks, which you can hear often in Hungary, even today, or I see some very\nrude behavior, then I realize that I am very lucky not to be here, yeah. So... and I have\nnever been a patriot of Hungary. I\u2019ve never had a Hungarian passport in my life. I\u2019ve\nalways been really, stamped. Every document I ever had in Hungary, had a big... a ZS on\nit, which meant I was a Jew. So, since I was never a first class citizen, not even a second\nclass, no citizen at all, I just don\u2019t have any attachment to the country, as such. I do have\nattachment to certain places where I grew up.",
        "Q: Are you an American citizen?",
        "A: Oh yes, I became an American citizen in 1961, and so I always kid people who ask me,\nwhen they hear my accent, what happened to me, how come a foreigner is teaching\nAmerican government? Some of my students question me and I said, \u201cWell, I have been\nan American much longer than you, and your parents.\u201d And so...",
        "Q: Do you feel more of an attachment to being... to America than Hungary in any sense? I\nmean, by being a citizen, by having lived here for so long?",
        "A: Oh, definitely. I must be honest and say that I do not have nationalistic feelings, as most\npeople would have. The flag or a national anthem doesn\u2019t really mean much to me. I\ndon\u2019t consider that patriotism. But I like a lot of things here, especially the constitution,\nand I appreciate the fact that I can live a free life and for them I am very grateful and my\npatriotism manifests itself this way, and not by waving the flag.",
        "Q: Did you know anything about the Constitution before you came, or how did you learn\nabout... about the Constitution?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, because I couldn\u2019t... I couldn\u2019t read it, I didn\u2019t speak English, and in\nHungary, they were not very eager to translate the American Constitution as I was\ngrowing up. But when I came here, and I began to learn English and eventually when I\nwent back to school, and was a history major, I had to... so, base... my first encounter\nwith the Constitution was in college, in Fresno.",
        "Q: And what... what impressed you about it, or what was your response to 1t when you first\n?",
        "A: Oh I thought that it was a tremendous document, naturally, and I still admire the people\nwho wrote it. I consider them geniuses, creating something from nothing, truly, and I\nwish that we had some of that caliber walking around today in Washington.",
        "Q: Was becoming a citizen of the United States an important event for you? Did it mean\nanything?",
        "A: Yes, because I never in my life held any kind of citizenship or any kind of passport. And\nthe fact that now I have something that will... unfortunately, that in the 20\" century, the\nfact that you are a human being, with two eyes and a nose and everything else on you, 1s\nnot sufficient proof for you to travel around the world and be protected by international\nlaw. Considering all this, I felt much safer now that I have a country behind me and I am\nprotected in case I am in trouble somewhere. Yes, it meant a great deal, because those\ndays, I liked to travel a lot, and it was a sense of security that I had from it.",
        "Q: Well, going back to then, when you first arrived in the United States, in 1956?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember your conceptions, your ideas about what the United States was then\nand what you actually found and what your first impressions were?",
        "A: Well, since I came from a Communist country, and before that a Fascist country, initially\nthe U.S. was never painted as a paradise. Never even painted as any country that is\ndesirable to live in. All I heard about it was negative. However, I was raised in a family,\nmy father was a very enlightened man, and he raised me on the truth, so I knew that this\nis the country of the free. And I had no qualms about this. The thing that bothered me a\ngreat deal about coming here, and also I, as I mentioned before, I did not come here... this\nwas not my first choice, you know, I had to follow my cousin. What bothered me, I\nhave... I was never that much in favor of modern times and fast times, and a landscape\nwith skyscrapers, that was not my vision of my future life. I was a typical European, who\nfelt a lot more comfortable in... on a narrow street with half-timbered houses, and a lot of\npeople on the street, and sidewalk caf\u00e9s, and little restaurants. Then to go to a country\nwhere none of this would exist. So I had my reservations this way, emotionally. I had no\nqualms about the United States politically, but I was worried about how can I adjust to a\nplace that doesn\u2019t have much traditions.",
        "Q: Did you find that to be true, that your impression was that there was no tradition here, or\ndid you...",
        "A: Yes, yes, very much so. I still am very nostalgic when it comes to, for example\nChristmas. I consider our life here quite plastic and I understand why. I am not faulting\nanyone for it. I know that a country that is so young as the United State, just never had\nthe opportunity to develop those traditions that European countries have, that existed now\nfor thousands of years. And so... But it is just sad. I feel that a great deal of problems\ncome from the fact that we are so young, and we grew too quickly, almost like a teenager\nwho just became totally uncoordinated.",
        "Q: But you mentioned that your father taught you about America, that it was... that 1t was the\nLand of the Free. What did that mean to you? What did that mean to him?",
        "A: Well, in the war, we listened, as long as he was around, and we had an opportunity, we\nlistened to London, to the BBC, it was... and occasionally, I think, but I am not so sure,\neven the Voice of America could be heard. And, of course there, we heard a great deal\nabout the western... so-called western world. And realized that while we are living there\nas practical slaves, in the western world, people have a very good life. And that appealed\nto me a great deal.",
        "Q: How long were you in Camp Kilmer, when you first arrived in the U.S., in New Jersey?",
        "A: I think it was no more than two weeks. It was just a screening process to just give a very\nsuperficial screening, so certain elements, undesirable elements would not sneak into the\ncountry. They were looking for members of the Communist Party and unfortunately,\npeople who were sick, because with certain illnesses, you could not gain entrance to the\nUnited States. For example, if you had TB. And then, from there... and also, they were in\ncharge of sending you somewhere. So, they were kind of dispatchers.",
        "Q: So it was then that you got sent to...",
        "A: Saint Louis.",
        "Q: Saint Louis.",
        "A: Yeah, Saint Louis, Missouri.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, what did you do there?",
        "A: In Saint Louis... Saint Louis, Missouri, I was welcomed by the family, by that time,\nadopted, of course, just symbolically, my cousin, and we were united. They were a... you\nmight say upper-middle class American family with some problems and they thought that\ngetting two Hungarian refugees would probably mitigate their circumstances. And I was,\nwithin weeks, working for a wholesale jewelry company. I was just a stockboy. And,\nvery simple work, and that was my job. And on weekends, as long as my cousin was with\nme, of course, we were walking around and going to a movie, even though we couldn\u2019t\nunderstand much of it. But just planning, eventually, to be integrated into this society.\nAnd on weekdays we worked, we went home, we watched television. And the family\nwas... it was a very interesting situation, because the man was manic depressive and we\ncould never figure out what his moves would be next. The... his wife was a very darling\nwoman, and she was the one who tried to figure this out, that with two Hungarian\nrefugees, the situation might change. They had a mentally retarded son in an institution,\nwho came home on weekends and they had another son at home, a very brilliant young\nman, who was always creating something electrical, or mechanical, even. So, we had\ngood relationship with him, and I kept up with my host mother for a long time, and only\nwhen we left for Europe, that was the time when I lost contact and I don\u2019t know where\nshe is. I understand they got a divorce after. It was in... unbearable to live with somebody\nwho was so unpredictable.",
        "Q: You mean when you left for Europe to move there with Jan and...",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, yes.",
        "Q: ... much later. Uh-huh. Did you have the idea at that time, that you would be staying in\nthe United States? I know you had the idea originally that you didn\u2019t want to stay, and\nyou wanted to go back to Europe. Were you thinking, after you had arrived, that you\nwould actually stay? What... What were your thoughts about the future?",
        "A: Well, I realize that I was in a trap, because there was no way for me to go back to Europe,\neven if I wanted to, and be accepted by a... any country and get some legal status\nanywhere. The reason was, once you were placed in a country, you couldn\u2019t really do\nmuch about it any more. So I knew I had to make the best of my stay here, but I certainly\ndidn\u2019t want to stay in Saint Louis, because I was totally astonished at the prejudice in\nSaint Louis. Not just against Blacks, but also against just about anyone. I worked mainly,\nthis is my fate, with German, it was a German company basically, a German family,\nGerman workers and I heard enough of... you cannot name a group or a race around the\nworld about whom they were not talking during the day, always in very derogatory terms.\nAnd then I found out that Saint Louis was a very Germanic city at that time. You were\neither of German descent, or you were Black. And luckily, when I became very, very\nupset about this, my Black fellow workers, first by sign language, probably, and later on,\nas I learned my English, pidgin English back then, they invited me on weekends to be...\nto go around with them, because they said one cannot just sit at home. And they\nintroduced me to the Saint Louis that most people who were born there, probably,\nwouldn\u2019t know. I went to just about every nightclub, I heard just about every jazz band\nthat there existed those days, that came to Saint Louis. And many times, in a huge dance\nhall, I was the only white face. And of course, sometimes, I ran into almost trouble too,\nbecause of that.",
        "Q: Were you not... did it seem strange to you that it would be the group of Black co-workers,\nrather than Germanic co-workers who would befriend you, or did you think that that had\nanything to do with you being Jewish, or did you reject friendships with the German\ndescent co-workers? What was the story with that?",
        "A: No, because most of those Germans were Jews, and... but that didn\u2019t prevent them from\nbeing prejudiced against me too, and they knew that they were... that I was Jewish. It was\njust a general thing in Saint Louis, to look down on anyone who js not an established\nperson. And I felt this, everywhere. I just... and the situation at home, where I was\nstaying with these people, was also not very happy. And that, I think, contributed to my\nthoughts that, how nice it would be to go to some other place.",
        "Q: So you came with some ideas about this being the Land of the Free, and did it surprise\nyou to see how... what a division there was between Blacks and Whites in this country\nand the way that the White people treated Blacks, and the problems with equality?",
        "A: Yes, yes, that surprised me very, very much. In one of these weekend excursions, I was\nintroduced to a very charming college student, she was Black, and we started to date.\nAnd eventually, she explained to me that we cannot see each other any more, because her\nlife was in danger, and my life was in danger. And she said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand this\nnow, but twenty years from now you will understand. And as much as it hurts me, we\nhave to stop seeing each other.\u201d And that was my first great introduction to prejudice,\nreally, on a personal, you know, basis.",
        "Q: So, up until then, you really hadn\u2019t realized what a strong division there was, or what a\ntaboo there was against interracial relationships?",
        "A: No, I mean, you know, I came from a society that was tremendously prejudiced and I\nthought I am coming to a society that is much more different and much more positive\nabout these things. And it really surprised me that there was so much dislike and hatred,\nthat I knew could not be erased very soon.",
        "Q: Were there any civil rights activities going on in Saint Louis during the time that you\nwere there? Was there... were there any at... you know, discussions, just in the wake of\nthe Brown versus Board of Education decision that interracial education would be\nhappening? I mean, were you aware, or... that the schools would stop being segregated?\nWere there any things like that happening in Saint Louis that you were aware of?",
        "A: This was in 1957, and by 1957, June, I was gone. So I only lived there for five months or\nso. And I... my English was not good enough to read newspapers or even discuss\nanything political with people. I did watch television, because I felt that it was a good\nway to learn, and I got certain ideas, but I am not aware that I was... anyway I ever met,\nyou know, this kind of a problem in Saint Louis, no.",
        "Q: How did you learn English?",
        "A: Well, when you are... this is my great argument against bilingual education, that when\nyou have to, you learn everything. You can learn Chinese probably, just as well as you\nlearn English. No, for Europeans, English is an easy language to learn. Not so easy to\nwrite, but to learn, because it\u2019s... the grammar is much simpler than some European\nlanguages. I just put my mind to it, and I decided, if I am here, I might as well do it. I\ncould have gone to Cleveland, for example, and live my life as a Hungarian, but I wanted\nto be integrated into the society, and I love the English language, that\u2019s the truth. I think\nof all the languages, even though I admit that French is a very beautiful language to listen\nto, but I love the English language, I love... and this is why I love to read and I learned\njust by listening and my willpower, I think, helped me to get through. And among all the\npeople eventually I associated with, who arrived at the same time, I made the most\nprogress, because I just decided I don\u2019t want to belong to any Hungarian club and I don\u2019t\nwant anything to do with this. I really want to learn English.",
        "Q: It was a... you mentioned in the last interview that it was a friendship with... was it a\nprofessor at Washington University? Was that how you got out of Saint Louis and to\nAspen? How did your acquaintance with this man come about?",
        "A: He saw a newspaper article about us, in the... I think it was the Saint Louis Post Dispatch.\nHe... Because we were the first ones, my cousin and I think the first Hungarian refugees.\nAnd he cut it out and misplaced it somewhere, and only a few month after, somehow th-\nthe article came up and he called us and he invited both of us to dinner, to his house. And\nby that time my cousin was gone, so I went and I met him and his family. He just wanted\nto socialize and talk about the days in Hungary. He came to... he had come to this country\nbefore I, right after World War II. And his wife was a former German psychiatrist, and\nthey had one son. And...",
        "Q: But they were not Jewish, were they, or...",
        "A: Yes, yes...",
        "Q: ... were... they were Jewish?",
        "A: ... they were. And... but of course, this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. Interestingly, I\nlast... I lost contact with them in... sometimes in the sixties, and reestablished it last year\nwhen I went to Aspen. And Mrs. Chabay was there. The professor, Mr. Chabay, was\nalready dead, but she was there, visiting from Florida, where she lives in a retirement\nhome. And so I had a good chat with her about the good old days.",
        "Q: When you met them, did they ask you about your experiences during the war? Did you\ntalk at all about that?",
        "A: Yes, they ask me a great deal about that, naturally. But they were also very much\ninterested in my... at... in my present experiences then, which were also not very good.\nSomething happened to me after I moved out of my original family, and established my\nindependence. For a couple of month, I lived with a Hungarian couple who rented a\nroom, because they needed some money, and they had a room with a separate entrance,\nso I rented that, and there I had a pretty bad experience, and so I was just ready to leave,\nanywhere, in the United States. And this is when they showed me a film of Aspen,\nColorado, where they had the summer home, and where he was a member of the music\nfestival staff, and said, \u201cYou are coming with us.\u201d",
        "Q: Do you want to say anything about the experience that you had, that was bad?",
        "A: Well, it was... I don\u2019t even know if anyone in the future would completely understand it,\nbut it was just a strange coincidence that my father\u2019s company\u2019s... every company in\nHungary had a Party secretary, they were in charge of practically life and death, what\nwas going on. And my father\u2019s Party secretary, a lady, was the mother of the person who\nrented the room. So, he and his wife immediately, when this came to the surface, they\nimmediately were afraid that I might report on them back to Hungary, which I had no\ninterest, I couldn\u2019t care less, except one day they... I heard a big argument and I realized\nthat they were arguing about abortion. The man wanted his wife to abort, she was\npregnant. They were very... social climbers, real social climbers, who were constantly\nadding up, every penny on a piece of paper, figuring out when and how they can move,\nthey can buy more furniture, they can buy this, they... a child was the last on their priority\nlist. And so I heard her cry, and all this, and a few days later I came home, and she was in\na pool of blood. She had done something to herself, and I found her, and it...\nEnd of Tape 8, Side A\nTape 8, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape one, side B, of an interview with Robert Holczer. Go ahead.",
        "A: And so the young man knew now that I... we have a secret, and he was afraid that I would\nreport this back to his mother. And of course, I had absolutely nothing to do with his\nmother. Then, next, the mail from home stopped. I did not get any, any, any mail, which\nwas very strange, because I had an agreement with my parents that every week we shall\nwrite to each other. They received letters from me, desperate letters, what happened to\nyou? And nothing. This went on for weeks and weeks, until I went to a Party, and the\nwoman confidentially asked me to step aside, and told me that she was with them\nsomewhere, and they were a little bit tipsy, and they were saying that they are stopping\nall my mail and stuff it under their mattress. I left the place very quickly, I went home,\nlooked under their mattress, and I found all the letters, and confronted them with this, and\nI knew that I would have to move out, and that\u2019s exactly when this happened, that I was\ninvited and they said, \u201cOh, you come with us.\u201d",
        "Q: So you went to Aspen?",
        "A: Yes. I went to Aspen, and that was like going from a cave to paradise. Not only that it\nwas beautiful and now, I had always been a mountain man, but the people, I just loved\nthe people. That was way before Aspen was discovered and made into the rich man\u2019s\nMecca. It was now a... 1t was a great deal of Europeans... Americans from the 10th\nMountain Division that exist... that trained there during World War II, and many of its\nmembers came back and established Aspen. It was just a marvelous group of people.\nToday, of course, they are all dead, but their names are on streets, and the recreation\ncenters and parks. And it just... it was a little bit weird for me to return and see all my\nfriends names as street names and park names and all.",
        "Q: What was it... tell more about what it was about the place that was so appealing to you,\nand also how that changed your perception of the United States, if it did.",
        "A: What appealed to me is, number one, up on eight thousand feet, you need each other. The\nwinters are pretty harsh, and the summers were filled with tourists coming to the music\nfestival. You needed other people\u2019s help and you had to help others, too. There was just a\ncamaraderie there, a very open attitude that appealed to me a great deal. I was still young,\nand the fact that I could get a job where I... my hours were not so regimented, even then...\nthere, I felt so free. The pay was good in comparison to other, you know, kinds of other\nareas of the United States. There was so much color in the place. All kinds of people\ncoming and going. It was just a... for a newcomer, it was a marvelous, marvelous\nintroduction to American life. There were people there who were truly the most middle\nclass, rigid family. There were people who were a very relaxed family. All kinds, and\nthey were all... they all got along so well, that was a great surprise to me. I also loved the\nfact that a great deal of the town, the eastern part, was still in such primitive state back\nthen, that some miner shacks still had cooking utensils on the stove, just as they left them\nback at the turn of the century when the panic came and many of those miners went back\nto Italy and you... what is today Yugoslavia. So, there was a little bit of the old. Not\neverything was concrete and glass, and well, even today the town has preserved a few\nbuildings. I was very glad to see that not everything 1s rebuilt.",
        "Q: When you formed friendships with people and made contact with people there, did they...\nwere they interested in your past, and where you\u2019d come from and what had happened to\nyou during the war? Did anyone ask you about that, and did you feel compelled to talk\nabout it?",
        "A: Yes, yes, they were very much interested. These were the type of people, the locals and\nwell, most people worked in businesses that catered to tourists. And it was an asset if you\nhad an accent, and if you look like somebody who had an interesting past, because they...\nsometimes they hired me for a certain job just because I had a story. And yes, people\nwere constantly questioning you about this, and I couldn\u2019t care less, it... as a matter of\nfact, I enjoyed this kind of fifteen minutes in the sun. And so, I mean, in this respect, I\nhad no problem.",
        "Q: Did you find that people had an understanding of what had happened during the war, and\nthe history of what had happened to the Jews in Europe?",
        "A: Mm, mm, well no, not much. The only people with whom I could really communicate\nabout the war, and what happened in Europe, were the ones who were in the European\ntheater, and as I, as I mentioned before, many of the so-called 10\u00b0 Mountain Division\u2019s\nmembers settled there, and I loved to talk to them, because they were very much involved\nin the liberation of some of the European countries, so they knew where I came from. I\njust have to add one more thing to this, that interestingly, the reason I am so fond of\nAspen, even today, because I believe that my life in America was shaped by that two and\na half years I spent in Aspen. Almost every major friendship, almost every major contact\nI had, after I left Aspen, was based on something that happened to me in Aspen. Almost\nevery one of them. I still am very close, and my closest friends today, I say, in the U.S.\nare those who were with me in Aspen, and those who still are alive.",
        "Q: What was the work that you did while you were in Aspen?",
        "A: When I arrived there, immediately, the next day, I started to wash dishes in a little caf\u00e9\nhouse called the Epicure. And I was there, I think, for no more than five days or so, when\na very nice looking Austrian gentleman stopped by and, who looked, I remember, who\nlooked exactly like the famous French actor, back then Fernandel, and said to me... he\nwatched me washing dishes and he said, \u201cOh, I am so and so, I am a friend of Mr.\nChabay.\u201d And that was the gentleman who brought me to Aspen. He said, \u201cAnd I would\nlike you to come over and see my shop.\u201d And he brought me over to his shop, he had a\nnice jewelry and gift shop, and it was... he was a watchmaker and that was his main\nprofession, but he also had a very, very nice place. And he asked me... we conversed in\nGerman, since he was Austrian and I spoke much better German than English and he\nsaid, \u201cHow do you like my shop?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat a nice, nice, cute place.\u201d He said,\n\u201cWould you like to work for me? I can give you this much,\u201d which was a lot more than\nwashing dishes. I said, \u201cBut how can you hire me? I don\u2019t speak English.\u201d He said, \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t ask you whether you speak English or not, I asked you whether you like my shop.\u201d\nAnd he said... And I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re hired.\u201d And that was the kind of\nattitude that prevailed in Aspen. Easy going, fun loving, a lot of kidding. So I worked for\nKurt Breznits, and I started to work for him, this was in 1957, about, I would say, July.\nAnd our friendship survived for forty-two years, because he\u2019s the one, he and his wife, in\ntheir eighties, I visited them last year. Now, I work there until late fall... early fall, excuse\nme. A young man came in around September, and by that time there weren\u2019t too many\npeople in Aspen, because it\u2019s a seasonal place. At least back then, the off season, you\ncould hardly see anybody in the street. At the end of September, people were leaving, the\nmusic festival was over, and the ski season came around in December. So everybody left,\nvacation, travel. A young man came in and started to talk to me. He said, \u201cI got a\nproblem, my mother has a birthday and I have to get something for her.\u201d I said, \u201cLook,\nthat\u2019s not... shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d In my broken English I said that, and he looked at\nme and he immediately said, \u201cWell, where are you from?\u201d And of course, the whole story\ncame about and I said, \u201cWell, why is it a problem to buy something for your mother?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cBecause she has everything.\u201d And this is how I met a then young man by the name\nof Sheldon Rich, who was the son of a Chicago banking family. And on his twenty-first\nbirthday he received a nightclub from his parents, called, The Limelite. He just kept\ncoming back and talking to me, and we just became really... friends. We\u2019d occasionally\ngo out at night and he would bring his date and I would bring a date, and had a very nice\nrelationship. And then he came back later on, and he said, \u201cI have to leave my place, and\nthere are three apartments in the nightclub. I just hate to leave the place unattended.\nWould you mind moving into one of the apartments? You can just stay there, and when I\ncome back we can just share apartments, and no problem.\u201d Well, who\u2019d... who would\nrefuse a free apartment? I moved into the Limelite apartment, and when he came back in\nDecember to open it that year, he said to me, \u201cLook, I desperately need somebody that I\ncan trust, to be the cashier. How would you like to work for me?\u201d He said, \u201cI double your\nsalary.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I would do that, but I am very loyal to my boss, whom I love\ndearly and I just... I just can\u2019t leave.\u201d He said, \u201cOh, this is America. We don\u2019t have to\nworry about that. Ill take care of that, Pll talk to him.\u201d He said, \u201cYou know, Robert,\nhere, we don\u2019t even show up when we leave, we just call and say, send my check\nsomewhere.\u201d He says, \u201cThere\u2019s no loyalty here.\u201d I said, \u201cNo? You want me to be loyal to\nyou.\u201d The conversation went on and on and on and I said, \u201cWell, I just cannot go to my\nfriend, Kurt Breznits and say, \u2018I am leaving,\u2019 because you double my salary.\u201d But the\ntruth is, I needed money very badly to go back to school. That was my aim, that once I\nmastered the language, I would go back to school. So, by the... I went to work next day,\nand my boss and friend, Kurt Breznits was laughing and said, \u201cRobert, you don\u2019t have to\nhave these problems in this country. This is not Europe, and not only that, I would be\ndelighted if you can make twice as much money as you made here. I can\u2019t afford that\nsalary.\u201d But I said, \u201cBut we were such good friends.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, from now on, as\nlong as you\u2019re in Aspen, every Friday night, we will have dinner in my family home.\u201d\nSo... and we did that, just every Friday, I usually work late Fridays, so they had an early\ndinner, just so I can come. And we had dinner together and talked a great deal. And we\nsaw each other other nights too, but that problem was solved, but I could never\nunderstand this distance that is between employees and employers. I\u2019m still, even in my\nold days, as a high school teacher and all this, I would have been very hesitant to go and\nreport to somebody that I found a better place and I want to leave. I know it\u2019s silly, but it\nwas just pounded into me that you are loyal. And so I worked for the Limelite, which\nbecame a very well-known nightclub those days, with a lot of folk singers, as that was the\ntime when the Kingston Trio and all the others became famous and it was the... you\nknow, the great time of folk singing. Pete Seeger and all the rest, the... most of them\ncame to this nightclub. And eventually, from cashier, I was promoted and eventually I\nended up managing the place. And then my friend and boss, Sheldon Rich, became lucky,\nbecause his hated nightclub was sold. He could sell it to a group of folksingers who were\nsinging there, three, four people, and they formed a group called \u201cThe Limeliters,\u201d named\nafter the club, became famous, and now they could buy the club from him. So, he sold the\nclub, and I became the employee of the group, and... up until 1959, when I left. But I\nmaintained relations with one of the group, and his family. These are people who still\nvery much around today, you know, the four. And one of them, Glenn Yarbrough, who\nwas my friend, is still producing CD\u2019s.",
        "Q: And you decided... so your motivation to leave was really that you wanted to get in... to\ncontinue your education? Was that...",
        "A: Yes, I knew that living in a tourist place, I knew that I would never have, probably, the\nmoney to go out on my own, because every year, buying a place, and setting up some\nkind of a business, was more and more expensive. As Aspen became more and more\nfashionable, everything became more expensive. Besides, I had no interest in opening a\nbusiness. I always thought of myself as an educator. I wanted to go back to school, and\nluckily, I got together with some adventuresome kids, and they told me about Alaska.\nThey said that in Alaska you can make a lot of money and it\u2019s fascinating, and it\u2019s\nbeautiful. And I loved to travel, so it was just a spur of a moment when I decided that at\nthe end of the season, around April, I would go and follow them to Alaska, and would try\nto make money, and then, eventually, that fall, I was going back to school in Fresno.",
        "Q: Why Fresno? Why Fresno?",
        "A: Why Fresno? Yeah, people always ask me this question, because I\u2019m the most unlikely\nperson to end up in a central California town of practically no distinction. Hundred,\nhundred ten degrees heat. Why Fresno? Because they were the only ones, back those\ndays, who answered my letters... not giving me a scholarship, because I had trouble\ngetting my records together from Hungary. It was against the law, at that time, to send\nanything out, and I had to wait for my parents to find an opportunity to send it out with\nsomebody. And so, I just... a college had to accept me on my word, and apparently they\nwere afraid to do that. But Fresno said okay, you can come, spend a semester, we\u2019 ll find\nout how you function here, and then we will determine your status, based on that. And we\ncannot give you a scholarship, but we can assure you about the National Defense\nScholarship, which was given to people who eventually end up in education. And so I\napplied for that, and I got a National Defense loan, excuse me, not scholarship. That\u2019s\nwhat it was called back then. And I received that loan, and so eventually, after Alaska, I\nended... I ended up in Fresno. And of course, that was another eye opener, another piece\nof America that was very unknown to me. And it was a little bit of a crazy town, with...\nFresno is the center of the Armenian population in America. And they were... I hit it off\nwith them extremely well, no problem, until they found out that I am writing my master\nthesis on Turko-American relations in 1918-1920, and that was the time when the\nArmenians were persecuted terribly. And of course, no nation is all bad, no nation 1s all\ngood. And of course, when they were reading a little bit of my thesis, they found out that\nI was very sympathetic to Kemal Ataturk. Of course, I condemned the method of getting\nrid of Armenians, but I was... I found some goodness. So we had some little differences,\nbut all in all, I liked the people in Fresno. I liked them. I had a lot of foreign, foreign\nstudents, colleagues in the college and it was probably easier for me to navigate there,\nthan if I had gone to a big institution, where I would have been just a strange fish. Here I\nhad a chance to talk to professors. It was just a very relaxed atmosphere.",
        "Q: Were you feeling surprised that you\u2019d been to several very different places in the\ncountry, with very different atmospheres. Were you surprised at how much variation\nthere was in this country, that you had kind of come to expecting a certain, maybe...",
        "A: Uniformity.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I reported back, I remember to my relatives, and parents, I said, \u201cThis is not a\ncountry, this is a continent.\u201d I said, \u201cDon\u2019t think in terms of a country, this is a\ncontinent.\u201d It\u2019s... 1t will be that way for a long, long time, and I think it still is. When I\ntravel, in spite of the uniformity that modern age brings, you can still see that it is... it\u2019I\ntake a long time, and perhaps it shouldn\u2019t, perhaps this is the way it should be, that we\nstill have areas that... like you can open your eyes and realize that you are not in Chicago,\nor not in New York. And hope that they will keep it this way.",
        "Q: Well, you talked a little bit, in your first interview about what happened then, and how\nyou... how you had gone from... it was after you got your Master\u2019s degree, you went from\nFresno to teaching, in a special ed school, in Marin county, and you mentioned you had\na... you had wanted to go there because you had girlfriend in the area. And do you want\nto say anything more about that time, or do you want to go on to saying something\nabout... I\u2019d be interested in hearing how you met Jan and what... kind of how your\nrelationship grew, and was built, and whether... and what she knew about your past and\nwhat you talked... I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Why don\u2019t...",
        "A: No, that\u2019s okay.",
        "Q: ... you answer my first question first.",
        "A: Yeah, well, the... when I arrived at the Bay Area, for me that was just incredible. I\npractically pinched myself every morning when I woke up and I saw the sun and looked\naround, and the scenery. I just couldn\u2019t believe that I was that lucky. I just couldn\u2019t find\nwords to describe it to my parents, the beauty of the area and the very uniqueness that the\nSan Francisco Bay Area had for me. And still, 1t holds just a fascination. It\u2019s almost like\nEurope in the United States, when I walked the streets of San Francisco. I lived in\nTiburon... Belvedere... no, Tiburon, I\u2019m sorry. I lived in Tiburon, Belvedere is just next\ndoor, which at that time was affordable for a bachelor schoolteacher like myself. Today,\nof course, 1t would be impossible. And I had a nice little apartment in a duplex,\noverlooking what they call Raccoon Straight. And these are small, little islands in the\nbay. The sailboats were going back and forth all day. Tourists, you know, boats, and it\nwas just a very, very picturesque environment. The type of people I associated with,\nmainly through school, through my job, were very pleasant. Most of them were very\nyoung, and we did a lot of things together. I also had plenty of opportunity, of course, to\ngo on my own. And those days, I just was a restless spirit. I had a tendency to walk down,\nfor example, at night, and see the streets... the lights of San Francisco, and just feel that\nthere is something going on in the city that I\u2019m not part of, and I just have to hop into my\ncar and go there. And I did that, and it was then fifteen minutes, twenty minutes, I was in\nthe city, going around. And so then, I was walking around and I was happy, and I did a\ncouple of things. And then I looked back and I saw the lights of Belvedere or Tiburon or\nSausalito, and I felt that there... something must be going on and I\u2019m not part of it, so I\nhopped in my car and went back. So I was just restlessly looking for that unknown beauty\nwhich really was just around me, all over. And I loved to hike up on Mount Tamalpais.\nMill Valley, all those communities were very unique to me, and I thought I would live\nmy life here, probably forever.",
        "Q: What year was it? What year was it when you arrived?",
        "A: 1961. And, as I mentioned previously, the only job I could get here was... teaching\nmentally retarded students, but I didn\u2019t mind, because I thought of the old Hungarian\nproverb that said for any... for something that you like, you would even let people chop\nwood on your back, and I strongly believe in this. And so, I just... I didn\u2019t really consider\nteaching these children a great deal different than teaching regular children. As a matter\nof fact, in certain aspects, in certain sense, 1t was even easier because they were so loyal\nand devoted to you. Naturally, there were some problems with emotionally disturbed\nkids, who were in this group, too. But basically, it was easy, because of their love and\ndevotion. And I stayed in it for ten years, and after ten years, I honestly said to myself,\nI\u2019m burned out, I have nothing more to give, and this is when I returned to regulating...\nteaching so-called normal children, if there is such thing. And my wife, yeah, I met my\nwife at a teacher\u2019s meeting, and our superiors, our administrators, were a rather strange\nbunch of people, who had sometimes very unreasonable requests, and it had nothing to\ndo with education, such as we should have two pairs of shoes in our drawers, so we\nwould never have dusty shoes. And saying this to people who had to go out in the\nplayground almost every hour, I mean it was strange. And they criticized the way we\ndressed or what we said, or we looked, and they didn\u2019t much do it to me, but to... because\nI was a man, and I was the only man on the faculty of the county, but mainly to women.\nAnd... so I met my wife and at that time she was married with three children. And she\nstruck me as a kind of a person who doesn\u2019t really want others to know much about her.\nAnd I found out later there was a reason for that. Then... and we just discussed things,\nand I in my mind said, \u201cOh, this lady\u2019s quite cold.\u201d That was my first impression. And\nnever bothered really much. But, our path crossed at these meetings, and eventually, she\nwas writing some kind of a publication for mentally retarded teachers, and she called me\nup, and...",
        "Q: Mentally retarded teachers, or students?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry. No, teachers of retarded students. And she called me up and she wanted my\nadvice in something, which I still maintain, even up today, it was just a device to strike\nof...\nEnd of Tape 8, Side B\nTape 9, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Robert Holczer.",
        "A: Yeah, and as I was saying, first, I was not really very impressed, because she was not\nvery warm. And then the relationship changed after her phone call, when she asked for\nsome help, because I thought if a woman is really cold and reserved, she wouldn\u2019t call\nme and ask for help. And so I called her back and we started to chat, and from there on,\noccasionally, we called each other. But we never talked about personal things, and so, the\nwhole thing kind of petered out. And then, later, a year or two years later, I was invited to\na party, and to one of our colleagues, and he said, \u201cOh, by the way, Jan got a divorce. She\nis divorced, and she looks good.\u201d And according to... excuse me... according to Jan, I\nsaid, \u201cWow,\u201d which I deny. I never said such thing. But anyway, this, or whatever I did,\nor said, they considered it some kind of a sign for me that I would like to see her. So they\ninvited her and kind of matched us together one evening, and we hit it off just night. And\nfrom there on, I began to see her more often, and eventually, we just decided that this was\na pretty serious relationship. But I was thirty-seven, thirty-six and a bachelor, and I just\nwas not going to get married without giving it some thought. So, I did what my previous\ngirlfriend did, and signed up for one year to go and teach for the Army in Germany. And\nI arrived there, and I spent a year in Germany, and that year convinced me that yes, that\nshe would be the right person for me, so I came home. And we got married on Mount\nTamalpais, on the top of Mount Tamalpais, the mountain I loved to hike around, and the\nmountain we both saw every day, coming and going to school.",
        "Q: How old were her children at that point?",
        "A: Five, six and eight.",
        "Q: Did they ask you about your experiences during the war at some point, or did you tell...\ndid they know anything about your history?",
        "A: Interestingly, they were more interested then, than they are now. As little children, they\nkept asking me a lot, and these days, as adults, if we meet, maybe they fear they knew...\nthey heard everything. But I am surprised that my sons, who are writing all the time, just\nas a pastime, never really ask any questions. And they are around movies concerning the\nHolocaust and... back those days. But no. But back then yes, yes, and I told them quite a\nbit, and it was not really that much about the Holocaust. They were too little, and I didn\u2019t\nwant to, of course, cause nightmares, but it was mainly just life, what was life when I\ngrew up and what I... the things I did, and they were fascinated by my accent, and they\nbegged us to have another child, so he or she could have an accent. They thought that a\nbaby is going to be born with an accent. And they laughed at my mistakes that I made,\nbecause sometimes they were really funny. And inadvertently, I did say certain things\nthat just sounded very strange, and still are a saying in the family.",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: Pardon me? Such as, I... for a long time, I thought that fungus 1s really fangus, and so\neverybody called fungus a fangus. Once I told them something about a lawyer, and I...\ninstead of lawyer, I kept saying liar. And they couldn\u2019t understand, and in the end they\nsaid, the difference is of no... when I learn, I said, \u201cGod, there is no difference, lawyers,\nliars, what\u2019s the difference?\u201d And so there were many cute episodes. Drift and draft, I\nremember I had trouble distinguishing that. \u201cClose the... close the door, because there is a\ndrift.\u201d And so ever since, everybody called it drift and not draft.",
        "Q: What about Jan? Did you talk with Jan about your much... in the early times of your\ngetting to know each other, about your experiences during the Holocaust, and about just\nthe Holocaust in general?",
        "A: Yes. There is no problem there. She really wanted to know everything and I told her\neverything. And she read a great deal. And, as a matter of fact, she 1s my police woman,\nbecause she doesn\u2019t allow me to watch anything concerning the Holocaust on television,\nbecause she says I have such nightmares that she doesn\u2019t want to wake me up and it\njust... too much trouble. But I was amazed that after we got married, how much time\nshe... and effort she spent, and energy in reading books on Jewish history, and then, of\ncourse, going into her favorite theme, cookbooks. She has Jewish cookbooks and she\nknows more about Jewish cooking and holidays, and... so today when somebody ask me\nabout some Jewish custom or holiday or something, I always refer them to her, because\nshe knows a lot more about it than I do. I just, because of my indifference to religion, I\njust never really give it too much thought, of learning much about holidays and the\nbackground, but she did. And of course, there was never any question about conversion,\nanything like this, because I myself, I was not practicing.",
        "Q: How... was her family accepting of you?",
        "A: Yes, and the reason was, by the time we got married, the person who probably wouldn\u2019t\nhave liked me, because he was a rabid anti-Semite, her father, was gone. Her mother was\na very tolerant person, but she was dead, too, by the time we got married. So, the only\nrelatives around that she had, was her brother and her sister, who are 20\"-Century human\nbeings, and they are very, very tolerant, and very progressive people.",
        "Q: Okay, so you stayed in the Bay Area until 1974, is that right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. What did you think of... were you aware of what was going on with the... with the\nSummer of Love, and the Free Speech Movement and all that stuff that was happening in\nBerkeley, and San Francisco in the late sixties?",
        "A: Oh yes. By the time I arrived in the Bay Area, and even before that, as soon as I could\nunderstand and speak some English, I became involved in the social and political scene\nvery much. For example, I remember when I... even before I settled in the Bay Area, I\nwould come up for the weekend and would go down, just by myself, to North Beach, in\nSan Francisco, to the beatnik coffeehouses, and just listen, or converse sometimes with\npeople. I really enjoyed the beatnik era. I liked those people, they were very introspective\nand intelligent. There was kind of a subdued, refined attitude about them that I\nappreciated. Occasionally, when somebody played the piano, they were sipping the\ncoffee and philosophizing, just a great time, I think, for literature, poetry reading. They\nwere all part of the scene. That truly was an interesting chapter in my life, going to North\nBeach. Then, later on, of course, after we were married, after I came back from Europe,\nfrom my one-year stint with the Army, which was in 1966, that is when everything\nstarted, especially the Vietnam War flared up. And our family was very much involved in\nthat. We were going over to the city, and I remember making big signs. My wife joined\nthe Another Mother for Peace movement. We were demonstrating, and there was a very\ncute episode that happened to us. She usually sewed a lot for herself and for the children,\nand bought a very nice, flowery material to make a dress. And we went to a big\ndemonstration over in Berkeley, and had to make our own signs. And we were getting the\nsigns ready and all of a sudden, we look down on our youngest son, Kevin\u2019s sign, and\nwhat did we see? A beautiful flower, of some textile, and if we looked at it, then we\nrealized it was her dress material that she had bought. He was so fascinated by the\npattern, and he needed flowers, because that was the theme of the demonstration, you had\nto have flowers on your signs, that he didn\u2019t think twice, and he was cutting out the\nflowers from... what... we didn\u2019t know what to do about it, and then we decided just to\ntalk to him, that this was not really the proper thing to do, but he didn\u2019t get punished. So\nthat was Vietnam. My sister-in-law wrote to, for example, to Lyndon Johnson and told\nhim that she fears that he should not run again. And interestingly, about three days later,\nhe came out and he announced that he would not run. So that... we felt that the family can\ntake some credit for that decision. But, we, we tried to have our children go and learn a\nlot about the times where we lived in, because we realized that they were very exciting\ntimes, very unique times. And perhaps, I always thought later on in their lives, life will be\nmuch duller than it was back then. We also lived, by that time, in Inverness, in an area\nthat was in the center of all these cults, and rock bands and so the kids were exposed to\nall these people and spent sometimes days, just listening to their music, up in the hills. It\nhad advantages, it had disadvantages. The disadvantage in this respect was that, no matter\nwhat parents would say to their children, they always had a place to go and because these\nrock groups had open house, you could help yourself at the fridge, or whatever, eating, or\nno matter how young you were, you were also welcome to dip into the pot and smoke it.\nAnd so it was in a... in the sense, difficult. And many of our children in the area, were\nrunaways. They would occasionally run away because that was just the style.",
        "Q: During that time, did you... were you aware of how Americans in general thought about\nthe Holocaust and Holocaust survivors, and some of the stereotypes that were attached to\nthem? And did you think of yourself as a Holocaust survivor, and how were you... how\nwere you relating to the culture at large, in terms of that kind of identity?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Now that is a very surprising question, because I never really thought about it,\nbut as you were asking me, I realize I didn\u2019t really think much about myself any more, as\na Holocaust survivor. I just thought much as a member of the scene, so to speak. I was\nmore involved in what is happening in America, and thought more about it day by day,\nthan to think too much, to give too much thought about the past. So, in this respect, it was\ngood, because one should not constantly be visited by ghosts. So I think it, it was a good\nthing for me, in this respect. And you know, I was part of the whole story then, and,\nrather, an American fighting to end the war, and bring justice to people who were\noppressed.",
        "Q: But you did have nightmares about the past, you mentioned that.",
        "A: Only... only it usually... 1t was provoked by watching some television story, or reading\nsomething in the newspaper. Otherwise, they were going away, they were becoming\ndistant.",
        "Q: What about when you lived in Germany and you\u2019re... you\u2019re there in this nation that had\nperpetrated these crimes, and people presumably were much more aware of the history\nthere, than your acquaintances had been when you lived in the States. Was it a bigger\nissue that The Holocaust? Was it more of a... did 1t have more of a place in your life and\ndid you talk about it with people?",
        "A: The... now, this is a very complex story. When we lived in Germany, which was from\n1974 to 1993, I would say most of the time, when there was a West Germany and East\nGermany, the Holocaust was not a big problem, mainly because the West Germans were\nbringing it into the open. It was not something hushed up under the rug. There were\ndiscussions about it in schools. I spoke about it to high school students, mainly. The\nwhole... the whole problem with the Holocaust and the way Germans would look at it,\nreally started after the Unification. Now, I must also say that there weren\u2019t too many\npeople who were alive in World War II, by this time. Because I was fifteen when the war\nended, and I am seventy now, almost. And so, most people are dead, who were in World\nWar II. Now of course, it doesn\u2019t mean that Fascism as such, is dead, or was even... was\ndead. Yes, I heard anti-Semitic remarks, and sometimes, when I felt that 1t was the proper\nthing to do, I responded, and sometimes when I looked at the person, and I realize it was\na primitive old idiot, there was no reason to say anything. It would have been totally\nsuperfluous to provoke anything, because it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference. I rather\nconcentrated on talking to people of the middle and the younger generation. And I found\nthat intellectually, at least, they understood what was the Holocaust. They were very\nashamed and sorry about it, and I felt no urge to drill in, with young people especially. I\nfelt that they were progressive enough. The younger German generation amazed me,\nbecause I think they are very progressive, and I think they see history in the right light.\nHow... all this changed after the unification, because you had now Eastern Germany\njoining. A country that was never taught proper history, where the Holocaust, oh well,\nonly West Germans were responsible for the Holocaust, because all the Nazis, according\nto East Germany, were in West Germany. So, those people had no background, and they\nhad... they were not prepared for this historical fact and they denied it. And this is why\nthe skinhead movement and all the neo-Fascist organizations, basically, come from, East\nGermany, even today. Add to this the usual reasons for Fascism and anti-Semitism, a\nvery high unemployment and very bad economic conditions and the fact that unification\ndidn\u2019t bring immediate remedies to all their problems. So they had to again go back and\nblame the old scapegoat, the Jews, in spite of the fact that there aren\u2019t too many. So,\nsince they couldn\u2019t attack many who are living among them, they went back to the past.",
        "Q: You were living in Frankfurt at the time that the Wall... that the Berlin Wall came down?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Do you... Did you foresee any of this? Did you, at the time... what were your emotions at\nthe time, and your thoughts at the time that the Wall came down and you were seeing\nthe... that there was this... unification was going to be happening?",
        "A: Oh, I think that everybody basically felt the same, that we lived truly in a moment of\nhistory that is... has just very, very few companions. That it was something extraordinary.\nAnd now, just a couple of years before, nobody would have thought that in our lifetime,\nsomething like this will happen. But of course, after the Soviet regime collapsed, then,\nthen, it was inevitable. It still, it was a surprise, and it was naturally something that will\nalways be in my mind, because just a few weeks before, my granddaughter, who was\nabout fifteen at that time, came to Europe and we went to the Wall in Berlin, and we had\npictures of her just standing by, and I was telling her that you can bring back your\nchildren here, probably, and maybe even your grandchildren one day, and the Wall will\nstill be here. And so, no, nobody anticipated such a rapid disintegration.",
        "Q: Did your... have you talked to your grandchildren about... have they been interested in a...\nin your experiences during the Holocaust, or ask you questions about...",
        "A: Yes, the... my granddaughter who is twenty-four... I\u2019m sorry, twenty-four? No, no,\ntwenty-two, I talk to her, she knows quite a bit about the Holocaust. And we usually go\ntogether to movies, not necessarily related to the Holocaust but sometimes do, like, we\nsaw, \u201cLife is Beautiful\u201d together, and I make a point to take her to movies that deal with\nhistory... modern history, or the Holocaust, so we can talk about it. I want her to know\neverything. The, the... I have two grandsons and I took them too, to the Holocaust\nMuseum. And they are at the... they were at the age, they went through too fast for my\ntaste, but I hope one day they will go back and they will slow down. And the other...\ngrandchildren, or potential grandchildren, are still too young to say anything.",
        "Q: So, when you were in Germany, you were teaching... were you teaching American\nstudents?",
        "A: Yes, I was teaching a regular American high school, where The American Army and the\nAmerican diplomat\u2019s kids would go. Just like any other high school. We had a... that was\na school district, just like an American school district. It was funded by the same way,\nand operated the same way and everything was the same, only the scene was Frankfurt,\nGermany.",
        "Q: Did you know... did you have other Jewish friends in Germany at the time who had been\nthrough the Holocaust?",
        "A: No, no, I did not have any. I had some German friends and we talked about the\nHolocaust, and they knew about me, but it... we never really made it into a big deal, and I\nnever really wanted to make it a big deal, I didn\u2019t want them to think that I solely exist\nand maintain the friendship to kind of pound in the subject. They knew about me, they\nknew about my life, and we discussed it in... on very civil terms, and I knew that they\nwere genuinely interested and sorry for what happened. But, other than that, no, no, I did\nnot have any other... occasionally, my high school teacher friend, the German couple,\nthey invited me to their schools, to talk. And Germans amazed me because, in our house,\nfor example, there was a lady who was a farmer\u2019s daughter, and she was in a... kind of a\nmid-level managerial job with a pharmaceutical company and she had constantly friends\nfrom Israel, and she was not Jewish. I had another... I have another very old friend in\nGermany, I met back in the early 1960\u2019s, and we have been friends ever since, and she\nhas friends constantly visiting her from Israel. She\u2019s also not Jewish. So, there\u2019s a lot of\ncontact between Israel and Germany, and well, I don\u2019t know whether this is a result of\na... of a bad conscience or something, but certainly you cannot hold somebody who was\nnot even alive at that time responsible for anything that happened. No, that would be\nunreasonable. But it\u2019s not... today, it\u2019s not a big issue. It is a sad fact of history,\nespecially in the western part of Germany.",
        "Q: Did you have thoughts at that time, of where you wanted to stay, whether you wanted to\nstay in Germany and settle there, and make your home there, or did you picture coming\nback to the United States at some point?",
        "A: Oh, I could have stayed in Germany, by the sheer coincidence of my name, which is a\nGerman name and the fact that I was, for a few month, a German citizen, in World War\nII. And that was just for a few months, so I didn\u2019t include in any citizenship, just by a\nmistake and because of the strange happenings of the times. They classified me as\nGerman in Hungary, and temporarily we were considered Germans, and of course the\nwhole thing was... oh, they only lasted for a few month when they found out who we\nwere. But that little episode and my name, and the fact that the reason the Hungarians\ntossed us out, besides being Jewish, they discovered that one of my great-grandparents\nwas born in what is called Sudetenland, which was a part of German speaking\nCzechoslovakia, which was at that time, the Austro-Hungarian empire, and all back, it all\nconnects together, and it all added up to some very tragic events, because we were not\nconsidered Hungarians, and my grandfather was deported to Auschwitz, not because he\nwas Jewish, but because of they said he was a foreigner. He could not prove that his\ngrandfather was a Hungarian, which was not true. But because of this, and other reasons,\nI could have gotten German citizenship. I could have gotten, probably, a great deal of\nmoney that way, because of what happened to my family in World War II, and all this,\nbut I never had, for a second, a thought. I mean, how can I think about settling in\nGermany, and taking German citizenship? There are so many reasons why I shouldn\u2019t\nhave done this, right? Number one is an emotional thing, a rational thing to... that would\nbe a little bit too much for me to bear. Second 1s that I have an American family, and my\nwife was ready to return to the United States. There no way would she have stayed in\nEurope with me. So, I knew that this was temporary, and I enjoyed while it lasted.\nEnd of Tape 9, Side A\nTape 9, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape two, side B of an interview with Robert Holczer. Do you want to say\nanything else about Germany before we go on?",
        "A: I just want to say that I know that, for the purpose of the interview, you\u2019re interested in\nanti-Semitism and where did I run into the most, and I must say that the country where I\nran into the most anti-Semitic and Fascist remarks, and... is Austria. And I was amazed\nthat the... so many years after the war, I don\u2019t see a lot of changes. That here is a country\nthat, unlike Germany, was considered a victim of Fascism, which of course, it was not,\nand played this role very successfully. And today, it is just terrible. It\u2019s, the night wing\nelements are all over it. And you can go to any pub and just wait until they have a few\ndrinks, and there will be some talk about the good old days. So, no, I thought Germany\ndealt with the problem much, much better than Austria.",
        "Q: So you came to the U.S. in 1993, you returned. Did you come straight to Kentucky?",
        "A: Yes, yes, we came here straight from Frankfurt, Germany, we landed in Lexington. And\nby that time, we had a little home, because my brother and sister-in-law, who own\nBriarbrook Farm, had called us two years before, and asked us if we would like to buy a\nhome here for a very, very little money, and that sounded just like a good investment. My\nwife, of course, immediately knew it was going to be our home. I just considered maybe\njust an investment. We bought it, and then slowly, she worked on me to retire here.\nBecause I had no intention to come here. I wanted to be near a big city and I loved\nCalifornia. And she insisted that she did not want to go back to California, even though\nshe lived all her American life there, and so she won. Well, she followed me to Europe\nfor twenty years, and I thought it is proper to honor her wishes and whatever they were,\nbut basically, she wanted to be close to her sister and vice-versa, so we came here, and at\nleast we could be in driving distance, within a day, to our daughter in Virginia and to our\nson and her... and his family in Nashville. So, that was an... also another consideration.",
        "Q: Did you have any preconceived notions about Kentucky in general? Did you consider it\nto be kind of a backwards place, or did you have... had you heard any stereotypes about\nit?",
        "A: Well, we used to visit here, almost every summer when... while we were in Europe, every\nsecond summer or so, we would come back and stop here, too, for a few days. And so I\ncould... I was always very defiant when it came to this place, I just... I never really\nopened my eyes as to what is here, rather would sulk so... not in a very obvious way, but\ncall it an inside sulker. That\u2019s what I was, sitting on the couch during the day, and\noccasionally complaining that there is really not much to do here. And this was going on,\nI was... I never really came here with great enthusiasm. As I put it to my wife, an area\nthat doesn\u2019t even have sidewalks in town, to walk around, what am I going to do there?\nAnd also the fences bothered me, that you can\u2019t go anywhere, everything is fenced in.\nAnd how can you take your mountain bike and, and bike somewhere? You run into a\nfence within minutes. And I was just not very much for settling here. And then, I knew\nthat she was very insistent, and the last time we were visiting here, I think it was in \u201991,\nthat was shortly after we bought that little house... people were still living in it, the\npartners of the farm, and I was walking around, and all of a sudden, the... my past caught\nup with me, because I spent a great deal, as a young kid, out in nature, and I loved the\nsmells and the... I loved the sight of a tree, the smell of the grass. And all of a sudden, I\nbegan to smell and look at the very things that were so dear to me when I was little and I\nwas constantly hiking with my friends. And I realized that this is not a bad place, and\nbesides, 1t was so peaceful. At night there was no noise. And so I came back and the\nwhole family was around because they were... we were celebrating our wedding\nanniversary. And I said, \u201cI want to say something to you.\u201d I said, \u201cI just made up my\nmind, I can live here very well.\u201d And that was the end. All my sulking went away, all my\nreservations went away. I knew I was not going to come to the middle of New York City.\nI knew that there 1s not going to be any half-timbered houses when I walk into Paris. But\nI thought that I can make the best of it, and that I can live here.",
        "Q: Did you have concerns culturally, what it would be like?",
        "A: Yes, that was my main concern. I knew that this is a beautiful state and if I drive an hour\nfrom here, I can start hiking and it is really an... an open range, but culturally, I had\nreservations and I still have reservations. I feel a little... I would have really felt much\nworse, perhaps twenty, thirty years ago, but at the time when television brings you,\nespecially the educational channel and the history channel and Discovery and there are so\nmany channels now that you can get, that brings... they bring a lot of good\nknowledgeable stuff, and this is one thing. Second, of course, the internet connects you\nwith the world. So, one is not so isolated any more. Still, I am still yearning to go to a\ntown where the streets are crowded. I don\u2019t want to live on a crowded street all the time,\nbut sometimes, and I want to go to a sidewalk caf\u00e9, and I want to eat some different food\nthat doesn\u2019t taste the same, and just converse with people. I feel that there is, right now in\nthis country, there is great suspicion. You just can\u2019t walk up to people and start talking.\nAnd Kentucky is even better off in this respect than any other state, probably, or most\nother states. It just... there is always that suspicion in a person\u2019s mind, based on all the\nstories that we hear day by day by day by day, of violence. Violence really kind of\npoisoned the atmosphere in this country a great deal, and I\u2019m very sensitive to that. So, I\nwould love to just go to a park and sit on a bench sometimes, and just talk to strangers, as\nI used to when I was younger. But that\u2019s impossible. We don\u2019t go to the park to begin\nwith, because there are no... not many parks, and there aren\u2019t... not too many people, if\nyou find a park. And when it gets dark, of course, you clear out, and you just don\u2019t have\nthat kind of a life, that vibrant life that you find still in European cities.",
        "Q: Do you... Have you formed relationships with people just in the community in Paris?\nNeighbors, do you spend time in, in that town?",
        "A: Well, with neighbors, I just don\u2019t have that much with... in common. One neighbor next\nto our farm is a hog farmer, and I don\u2019t know anything about hogs and he doesn\u2019t seem to\nbe interested in many other things. And the others are way down. I go to Paris to take\ncare of some business that is necessary, post office or shopping, and this and that. And\nmy hobbies... one of my hobbies is antiques, so I know the people who are in the antique\nbusiness in Paris, and I can go in and spend some time and talk to them. But I do not have\na close friend. Now my... however, my association with the so-called master gardeners\nassociation in Lexington brought me together with people. I do volunteer work for the\narboretum in season, every week, and so... one day, and these are the people, usually, that\nI am the closest to, because we have a common interest, gardening. We spend time\ntogether, we have meetings. And after the season is over, we continue seeing each other.\nSo, yes, but since I came back... and that has also something to do, of course, with my\nage, too... I have not found here, anyone that I can call a friend.",
        "Q: Do you... do people ask you anything about yourself, or have they reached out to you in\nany way? Do they ask you about your accent, you know, people in town?",
        "A: Yeah, people are funny in this respect. They are interested my accent, and I cannot really\nsay that they are suspicious or they reject me. One man, a young man told me this last\nyear. Said, \u201cYou know, you are much better off than I.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou open your\nmouth, and everybody says, \u201cOh, what a nice accent, where are you from?\u2019\u201d And he said,\n\u201cT open my mouth and they say, \u2018Hey, you are not from here, are you?\u2019 And you know\nwhat they mean,\u201d he says, \u201cthat I\u2019m a damn Yankee.\u201d And I don\u2019t know about this, but\nall I can say is that nobody has ever reacted negatively toward my accent. I see that\nsometimes people smile when I talk to them, and I know why they do it and I consider it\na friendly gesture. And that\u2019s about it. The only people I\u2019m really mad at, the ones who\nlisten to me for awhile and say, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Because I know that they are putting me\non. That... if schoolchildren could understand me, they could, too. But... and another\nthing that, of course irritates me, when... my hearing is not that good any more, and this\nhas nothing to do with accent and all this, it\u2019s just that some people are very intolerant,\nand if you ask, you know, \u201cWill you please repeat it?\u201d They just say, \u201cForget it.\u201d And the\nword forget it really irritates me. But that has nothing to do with accent and being foreign\nborn. Otherwise, I find that people are much friendlier, even with my reservations about\nbeing suspicious, much friendlier than they were in some other states that I\u2019ve travelled.",
        "Q: Did you say awhile... maybe the first interview we did, at that time were you working\nwith the Historical Society in Paris, or with the museum? Do you still do that at all, or...",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t do it any more, and frankly, I can\u2019t even come up with a good reason why.\nPerhaps it\u2019s just that I get very busy at home, and the... somehow, the familiar faces that I\nknew, many of them left and I... it\u2019s very difficult, I think, after a certain age, to make\nfriends and to build kind of a circle around yourself. And also when I first joined, the\nHistorical Society was a lot more vital than it is now. I think it just settled into a routine\nlife, and it just... I was just not interested any more. The museum was established, it\u2019s\nrunning smoothly. I don\u2019t think they really need me there any more. So I rather\nconcentrate on the Master Gardener\u2019s Association, where I can do something, actually\nwork. I am always much happier when I can do physical work, than when I just sit\naround and talk about what to do.",
        "Q: Have you taken a particular interest in Kentucky history since you\u2019ve been here, or in\nlearning about that?",
        "A: I... well, not strictly speaking Kentucky history, but I did take my first class, last year, in\nthe history of Cincinnati. Cincinnati fascinated me from the very beginning, because\nwhen I saw it, I said, this 1s the closest thing, around here, to a real city. The others seem\nlike villages, all of them. I can\u2019t think of any place in Kentucky, that to me, looks like an\nurban environment. And the... most of the places are, you know, just built very quickly\nand the original downtown... unfortunately, Lexington is destroyed, as we know it, and\nwhat is left of it is just struggling. Now, yeah, Cincinnati, yes. I was so interested in\nCincinnati, and Cincinnati\u2019s history, that I took a class, a whole week Elder Hostel class.\nI like to take classes with Elder Hostel, and it\u2019s usually a hands-on class, but this time I\nmade an exception, \u2018cause I wanted to know the history, background, and more about the\narea. And it was not just Cincinnati, 1t was northern Kentucky, too. It was very good. So\nI\u2019m hoping to do some more. And of course, here and there I read a book about\nKentucky. I take some authors who are local and look into their works, and David Dick\nlives in the area, and his books... so, Iam. But I am not really an expert on Kentucky\nhistory, I leave this to people who are natives. I just have a kind of a... really a surface\ninterest in just the basics.",
        "Q: Do you feel that you can stay here and live here and be at home here for the rest of your\nlife? Is that something you think about?",
        "A: Oh, I settled this already with myself. That\u2019s it. This is my last station. I am here for\ngood, and naturally, this is not a bad place to be, and even though I might... I could think\nof some other places where I would rather live, but I am here now, and I make the best of\nit. So...",
        "Q: It seems like you could, if you look back on... on your whole life and where you came\nfrom and what your experiences have been, that you could say to yourself that this was\nalmost the last... last place that you would have landed. You think?",
        "A: Yes. I wouldn\u2019t have chosen it, back thirty or forty years ago, no way. Because at that\ntime I still was more, somehow I felt that I... that there was still a great deal to discover.\nAnd I know that, now that I reached the age, and considering the fact that I have heart\nproblems, that I can\u2019t just jump around any more. And even though I would love to visit\nsome other corners of the world, and our country, I have to take it easy, and this is\nbasically a very good point to be. I really like to explore more of the eastern part of the\nUnited States. That\u2019s a very good place to be, and the fact that we lead here, otherwise in\nkind of a Norman Rockwell type life, with my brother and sister-in-law, that here... we\nhave been here for six years... almost six years now, and we never had a conflict, not\neven a minor one. We eat our meals together quite a bit. We go, usually together to the\ntheater or a party or something. We do a lot of things together. We are... they are our\ncompanions, and we are theirs. And so I... considering all this, I am very happy, and at\npeace.",
        "Q: Have you encountered any anti-Semitism since you\u2019ve been here to Kentucky?",
        "A: No, no. I have never heard anything like this. I think there are so many... so few Jews\nhere. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean anything, there are very few Jews left in Poland, and\nthere\u2019s still anti-Semitism, but no.",
        "Q: And then you mentioned that you talk... have been talking with school groups.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Will you say something about what that experience is like?",
        "A: Oh that, that is... I do this with great pleasure, because I know that... in this area, there are\nvery few people, probably, who experienced the Holocaust, and even know what tt 1s.\nAnd so, one schoolteacher started this program in the local schools, and she always\ninvites me, about two, three times a year. And last time, it was a closed circuit television\nthat they put me on, with some other classes around Kentucky. And... but most of the\ntime, I just talk to her classes... her combined classes or some other teachers bring in\nclasses, and these are usually kids, thirteen, fourteen years old, and I like to talk to them,\nbecause that\u2019s how old I was when the real disaster hit me. And so I can kind of get down\nto their level of understanding and explain certain things to them. And I find that they are\nvery receptive, very receptive. So, I consider it a mission.",
        "Q: Are these students... is this Bourbon county schools?",
        "A: Yes, Bourbon county school system. I\u2019ve never been to the Paris school system, but it\u2019s\nBourbon county, which 1s, just basically, geographically speaking, it\u2019s also in the city,\nthey just split, I don\u2019t know why. And so I talk to the Bourbon county schools. I spoke to\nthe high school last year, but mainly it\u2019s the middle school.",
        "Q: Do you find that the students are they all familiar with the terminology, the term\nHolocaust? Do they know... do they have a basic grasp of what happened?",
        "A: The middle school students, because of the teacher\u2019s eagerness to clarify everything, are\nmuch better informed than the high school students. I was amazed. I went to the high\nschool, I... once I went to Berea and talked to the Berea class, and that was the worst.\nThey were just uninterested, sleepy people with a professor who, himself, put me asleep.\nI just couldn\u2019t blame the students, by that time, they were so turned off, that no matter\nwhat I did, I could have stripped nude, and it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference in\nthat class. But the middle-school kids, the junior high, they are just great to talk to. One\ngirl... just yesterday, I was speaking to a class, and one little girl stayed behind, and I\nusually spend about an hour and a half with them. I speak to them for awhile and then let\nthem ask questions. And one little girl was just stay... just stood behind and she was\nwaiting for me, waiting for me, when after everybody left, she came up, and she hugged\nme, and she kissed me, and she said, \u201cThis is all... for all the missed loves and kisses that\nyou could not get from your parents during those years.\u201d I thought that was just\ncharming. And she just turned around and left. It was... there was no other, you know,\nsecond thought about it. And so, it was just very, very beautiful.",
        "Q: Have you not... I mean, well, you mentioned you hadn\u2019t experienced anti-Semitism, have\nyou experienced anybody kind of asking you why don\u2019t you go to church, or you know,\nkind of asking you what church do you go to, or just expecting you to be Christian?",
        "A: Yeah, I... that comes around a little bit more often, when the people just cannot\ncomprehend that, how can anybody who doesn\u2019t steal, doesn\u2019t cheat, doesn\u2019t embezzle,\nhas been married for thirty-three years, why am I not a church goer? And that is what I\nhave to explain many times to people. Not only that, when I say I\u2019m a non-believer, of\ncourse, I think I\u2019m out of their favors. And... but I try to make a point there, too, that one\ndoes not have to go to church and belong to a religion, to lead a decent life. And I say\nthat. I look around and see how many people who go to church are in the news, beating\ntheir wives and embezzling money from the school\u2019s treasury, or from the county\ntreasury or using highway funds for their own purposes. You don\u2019t have to go. You can\nset your own rules. So, I do more argument about that than anything else.",
        "Q: Do you tell them that you\u2019re... that you\u2019re Jewish and that that\u2019s part of the reason why?",
        "A: Well, I tell them always. I\u2019m not making any . Lam... I always say,\nI\u2019m Jewish, but I am not a Jew... lam a Jew, but I\u2019m not Jewish. And of course, first,\nnobody understands what I\u2019m talking about. And I say, \u201cEthnically speaking, I am a Jew.\nI come from a ethnic group called the Semites and one of the subgroups are Jews.\u201d I said,\n\u201cNow these people have been mixed... intermingling with other people for over a\nthousand years, and therefore there is no such thing as a pure Jew, but then there\u2019s no\nsuch thing as a pure anything any more, since history mixed us up quite successfully.\nBut, when it comes to religion,\u201d I said, \u201ceven though I am a Jew, my religion is not\nJewish. I have no religion.\u201d I said, \u201cI am not... I do not belong to any organized religion.\u201d\nSo eventually I think they understand what I mean.",
        "Q: Do you ever get any responses to that? People getting into a conversation, or is that just\nkind of heads nodding, and then...",
        "A: Well, of course there are always those who feel that they can perhaps sway me over. And\nI always say, \u201cLook, I\u2019m seventy years old, and you have no idea how many people tried,\nand you are just wasting your time,\u201d I said. And so eventually, they see that they are. So\nthey give up and many of them still trust me and keeps talking to me, and there are those\nwho kind of shy away, because I might, you know, be who knows, the devil, or... you\nnever know what they think of you if you say I\u2019m a non-believer.",
        "Q: Oh, we\u2019re about to end.\nEnd of Tape 9, Side B\nTape 10, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Robert Holczer. Okay, do you\nhave any contact with other Holocaust survivors in Kentucky, or have you... do you know\nanything about anybody, besides you mentioned somebody earlier on?",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t know anybody. And several times, my cardiologist, who is Jewish, and 1s\nvery active in one of the synagogues in Lexington, mentioned that the rabbi is going to\nget in touch with me, because he wants me to come and talk to some group within the\ncongregation, but they never contacted me. I really don\u2019t have any connection to any\nother group.",
        "Q: Do you feel any desire or any interest in having that kind of connection?",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t mind. I\u2019m completely neutral. I am not going out of my way to look for it,\nand... because I don\u2019t like to dwell that much upon past. And... but I wouldn\u2019t reject if\nthey... if they would want to establish any contact with me.",
        "Q: You live in a rural area of, you know, central Kentucky, and there are a lot of, I mean, as\nfar as other... as far as minority groups, other than the main group, the... probably the\nmain other group would be migrant workers, and I\u2019m interested in just hearing your...\nyour perceptions of how people in the area deal with minority groups, and your\nobservations about... about that, if you have any.",
        "A: I consider this very similar to what was going on in Germany while we lived there.\nGermany had an economic boom in the 1950\u2019s, just like we have now, which meant that\nthe... all the menial and dirty jobs were unfilled. Most Germans just wouldn\u2019t want to\nwork in that, and also that they needed more workers than the country actually could\nproduce. So they invited in other nationalities as guest workers, that\u2019s what they were\ncalled, and they were mainly from Turkey. And this was back in the 50\u2019s. The German\neconomic miracle produced a migration from Turkey, which was legal, completely legal.\nThey had to have documents, they entered, they went to work in the factories. Now,\ntoday, in 1993... 1999, the economy... the German economy has slowed down\nconsiderably. These Turkish workers, the original Turkish workers, today are\ngrandparents. They brought their children back then, it was allowed, which was, I think, a\nvery nice, humanitarian gesture, because Switzerland, who had the same problem, did not\nallow family members to follow. They could go home on vacation, send the money back,\nbut nobody was allowed to... allowed to come. So, the family members came, and you\nknow, one family member then brings another family member, and pretty soon... I think\ntoday there are close to three million Turks living in Germany, a country of sixty-five\nmillion people. That\u2019s quite a bit, and of course, was tremendous resentment by some\npeople to begin with. But the real problem came not while the economic boom was on,\nthe real problem came when it was over, because now you had a lot of people who were\nalready adults, and born in Germany, to Turkish parents, and all the rest. So now, here\ncame the problem of what to do with them. Are they citizens, are they not citizens? And\nwelfare, are they qualified for welfare? So, I am afraid of the same thing here. Right now,\nespecially around here, in the Bluegrass, everybody who can think, knows that these\nillegal... or legal Mexican workers are fulfilling an important job. They are working here\nin a job that most other people wouldn\u2019t take. So, nobody has great reservations. When\nthey see... I heard that when they see something in the paper, that a thief was arrested, or\na murder happened, and it is a Spanish name, they do mumble about it, which is natural, I\ndon\u2019t consider this extraordinary. But my biggest fear is, what is going to happen when\nthis economic boom ends, and here we will be with these people. Now, they are not going\nto work. If they don\u2019t work, what will happen to them? To their mind? What will happen\nto those who watch around, and will take the opportunity to do the same as they do in\nGermany. The skinheads in Germany were burning down the buildings where they lived.\nPeople died in fire, they were beaten up on the street, or they were killed. Several, several\ntimes this happened. So, I hope that we'd... it doesn\u2019t come to this. I think that the... we\nneed more education, especially in the schools, to make these people welcome. They are\nhere for a reason, they are human beings, and just like anyone else in America, they came\nin by the same rights. If there is illegal immigration, that 1s not for Kentucky to try to stop\nit, because we can\u2019t, it has to be stopped down on the border, that\u2019s not our problem. But\nthose who are here, they are here. So what are you going to do? But the churches, the\nschools, any institution, I think should work together to make sure that people know that\nthese are human beings, these are not some alien group that is here only temporarily.\nThey are not here temporarily.",
        "Q: Do you draw... when you think about this issue, does you mind draw parallels to your\nown experience, and experience of Jews in Europe? I mean, even though it\u2019s not... I\nmean, with the Jews in Europe, they had been residents for hundreds and hundreds of\nyears and they certainly belonged there, but... but the idea of some kind of economic\nproblems making one majority group turn against a minority group and persecuting them.\nDo you think that makes you particularly...",
        "A: Yeah, yes...",
        "Q: ... sensitive?",
        "A: ... yeah, oh, in this... in this respect, there is a comparison. I... definitely, that... they\nwould be made scapegoats, the minute the chips begin to fall. But I don\u2019t think that in\nAmerica we ever have a danger of the death camps or concentration camps any more. I\nknow that we had them, of course, on a much, much smaller and different scale, for the\nJapanese Americans in the West coast, but I don\u2019t think that would ever come to this. I\u2019m\nmore afraid of individual treatment of these people.",
        "Q: Incidents like skinheads getting...",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, and I would like to see that we deal in school, we deal with them\nrealistically, that we let their children come to school without any reservation, because\nchildren in the world everywhere, makes no difference where they come from, where\nthey go, they should be in school. And number two is that we do not go overboard with\nbilingual education. These kids know how to speak Spanish, they should know how to\nspeak English, and even the families, I think, would appreciate the fact, that we would\njust throw them into an English speaking class, and I can guarantee that in three months,\nthey would speak English, without even an accent.",
        "Q: The one thing that I... that I missed asking was about your parents. I... you mentioned,\nmaybe in the last interview, that they came to the States, to visit for your wedding.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Not for my wedding.",
        "Q: Not for your wedding?",
        "A: Mm-mm, no.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: They came in 1967 to visit. They were here, I think, six weeks or seven weeks. And my\nmother, of course, would have loved to stay here. My father, he was just used to his life\nin Budapest, and he was very anxious, eventually, to get back. So there was no question\nthat they would stay here. And my father, who has always been around little businesses\nin his life, he did the usual thing that people at that time did, from Eastern Europe,\ntraveling to the West, they were constantly counting what... certain prices on\nmerchandise, it would cost in Hungary, in Hungarian money. I mean, I was thinking\nabout getting him a little calculator, but he was so fast in his head, he would beat any\ncalculator. So, his favorite place... and we lived in California when they were with us,\nwas Long\u2019s Drugstore, which is the equivalent of any big drugstore chain in our area.\nAnd he... he would just... if we did something, the rest of the family, with my mother, and\nhe did not want to be part of it, he just said, \u201cOh, just drop me at Long\u2019s Drugstore,\u201d and\nhe would spend an entire day at Long\u2019s Drugstore, looking... going around, looking\neverything, figuring out prices and this. So, yeah.",
        "Q: They...",
        "A: ... the Long Drug... the employees began to get a bit suspicious, what is this man doing\nhere, and he was smiling always, because he couldn\u2019t speak a word of English. So,\nfinally, I had to... I explained, I talked to the people, and said, \u201cThis is my father, he\ndoesn\u2019t speak any English, and he loves your store.\u201d And this is all he did. We drop him\noff here, he\u2019s totally harmless. He never killed a fly in his life. He just likes to... and so\nthey laughed, and they just... and eventually they all kind of tried to communicate with\nhim and he with them. And another thing that... just blew his mind, that all you can eat\nlittle places in San Francisco. And we used to go to one that had very nice stuff, steam\ntable, of course. And he just could not understand that here, we were five, seven people\ngo, and of course, the kids kept going back and taking more and this and that, and so\nfinally he said, \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, \u201cin Hungary, a restaurant like this would go broke in\none day.\u201d So, my wife went to get the manager, and it... she was a very nice lady, and\nexplain to her where my father comes from and what these questions are, so she sat down\nwith us, and she said... \u201ccause my father said, \u201cHow do you make money, all you can\neat?\u201d So, she then pointed out to my father, that look, \u201cHere is your granddaughter. Look\nwhat she has. She really didn\u2019t take much. Look at your wife, she didn\u2019t eat that much.\nLook at you, you didn\u2019t eat that much. The two boys,\u201d she said, \u201cthe two boys, okay, so\nthey might take up... up to the price that they paid, but look, all of you, you\u2019re eat...\u201d and\nso, She was very patiently explaining. She said, \u201cOur problem is not what people eat, it\u2019s\nwhat people try to put into their jacket.\u201d She says, \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many people\ncome in here with a bag, and all this.\u201d My father could not understand this, that even in\nAmerica people... because he had, certainly, a very idealistic view of America. But I\nforgot to tell you that every time we picked him up from Long\u2019s Drugstore, he learned\nthis sentence to say. First he learn it in... he said it in Hungarian, then I taught him how to\nsay in English, so the children can understand. He says, \u201cThis country is invincible.\u201d\nAfter looking at the drugstore, he made up his mind, that based on this wealth that is in\nthis... just in this store, and the way people just come in and can afford and buy, all this...\nhe said, \u201cThis country, my son, is invincible.\u201d He had unlimited faith in this country. And\nI don\u2019t know whether in a previous interview I told you, when people ask him, \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you stay here?\u201d He told them a joke. I think I...",
        "Q: Yeah, you did, you did, yeah.",
        "A: ... L say it, so I\u2019m not going to repeat that, but he... he truly, he... with all the wealth, and\neverything else that just enchanted him, he... and the nice aesthetics of the stores, he was\nready to go home.",
        "Q: What year did he die, he and your mother?",
        "A: My mother died in 1971, and my father died in, let\u2019s see, 1980.",
        "Q: Had you seen them again, since... in between...",
        "A: Oh, well, I was there when my father was dying, yeah. I was in Germany, so they called\nme and I come, and he had a stroke, and... but I was not with my mother when she was\ndying. My father just called me. So... but they have always been great supporters of the\nUnited States.",
        "Q: Do you have anything else that you\u2019d like to add? I\u2019m about out of questions.",
        "A: Well, if you give me a couple of minutes...",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: ... You can stop that, and see if there\u2019s anything else, okay?",
        "Q: Shall I pause 1t?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Are you involved with any other activities besides the Master Gardener\u2019s Association?",
        "A: Yes, we are enthusiastic members of the Elder Hostel program. We have... my wife, I\nthink, participated in just about fifteen or so, and I am just about five behind. And what\nwe usually do, we are taking hands-on type classes. My idea is that I want to know\neverything before I go, about... a little about a lot of things, such as I have always\nwondered about blacksmithing. What does a blacksmith do? How does he do it? So I\ntook a class in blacksmithing. I took a class in kaleidoscope making, because that\ninterested me... me, too. How does a kaleidoscope work? How do you make one? And I\ntook several classes in wood turning, which I enjoy very much as a hobby. We also took\na beautiful class, which was not hands-on, but still something similar, to... in Hawaii, an\nElder Hostel class for two weeks. We were studying the volcanoes, the rainforest and\nthen Polynesian culture. My wife is very active in basket weaving. She\u2019s a member of the\nbasket weavers... Kentucky Basket Weavers Association, or whatever... I don\u2019t know if\nthis is the official name, but she participates, she exhibits sometimes. Also, she\u2019s a\nquilter, so as a quilter, she comes in contact with a lot of truly Kentuckians. And she\ndoesn\u2019t ever come home complaining that maybe they considered her an outsider. She\nfeels very much at home with all these people. We also go to West Virginia, to Cedar\nLake, which 1s also a - an Appalachian center for crafts, and take a hands-on class. Our\nnext class, hopefully, we are on the waiting list, we have taken a class in Charleston and\nwe want to go back, this is our next class. We studied outdoor cooking and we are going\nback now to study Charleston\u2019s gardens. We take trips.",
        "Q: Is this West Virginia, or South Carolina?",
        "A: No, South Carolina, South Carolina, Charles... Charleston, South Carolina. And while\nthere, we visited Virginia, Savannah, and we were fascinated by Savannah, it was just\nwalking around in a European city. And in Kentucky, too, occasionally we take trips. We\nlove to go, as I mentioned, to Cincinnati. We go up to Louisville. My wife, as a quilter,\ngoes sometimes to western Kentucky, which is the quilter\u2019s place, you know, Paducah is\nthe quilter\u2019s museum. In other words, we are active here, and I took the class in History\nof Cincinnati, in northern Kentucky. And I plan to... oh, I belong to the Sierra Club, The\nNature Conservancy, a lot of conservationist organizations. I volunteered to participate in\nthe Kentucky water watch program, which I enjoyed very much. It just ended with the\nLicking River, and the branch here in Paris, Stoner Creek, was our responsibility. Four\ntimes a year we had to go down and take samples, and... so that was, I felt I was part of\nKentucky, doing this. We are... we try to stay active and my wife is mainly involved with\nthese quieter things, and I am... I like to get involved with something that takes me out in\nnature and puts me in a kayak, or out there, really fighting the elements. I still have a\nlittle bit of that spark. So, if I can manage, and if my heart gets better after the operation\nthis fall, I'd like to buy a canoe or a kayak, one of the two, and just go on these little\nrivers here. So...",
        "Q: Well, thank you.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is there anything else?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. That\u2019s about it. I mean, I can\u2019t... can\u2019t really...",

My grandmother was practically the sole supporter of the family until the\nchildren got a little bit older because my grandfather was a, what you would call a /umpen\nproletary (ph) person who did not really care too much about father responsibilities. The, so\nmy father was the oldest one who made it into adult life, there was somebody else ahead of\nhim but died of tuberculosis. And he has always been a great support to his brothers and\nsisters. He was a working man, he has always worked for other people. Eventually, he\nbecame kind of a, an amateur druggist, worked for companies but he did not have a formal\neducation and after the war, he joined a co-op. He rose to kind of a mid-level managerial\nposition but he basically was always just a working man. He never went beyond the second\ngrade and he taught himself how to read and write and everything else. He had exceptional\nqualities in math and law. My mother\u2019 comes from a small northern Hungarian town, Vacz.\nThis is where the Danube turns suddenly south and she comes from a middle class family,\nOrthodox, very religious. She had a brother and a sister, both of them who died in World\nWar II. The sister was deported, the brother died in labor camp. Her entire family from\nVacz were, was deported to Auschwitz and died there. My mother never had to work,\nbasically, my father was always making enough money and she enjoyed just being a\nhousewife. Anything else?\n1 Cornelia Oestreicher",
        "A: My father had thirteen brothers and sisters, yes, and he was the oldest one to survive, to grow\nup, because his older brother died, very early. So, the burden of supporting the family was\nalways on him. So he was the provider type and my mother had no basic responsibility.\nShe was basically what you would call a_petit-bourgeois lady and I always admired my\nfather\u2019s values more than my mother\u2019s but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t love my mother. My\nmother also survived the war with me.",
        "A: My father and mother met, so that, my father was working for a wholesale drug distribution\nfirm. By drug I, we mean a cosmetic supply firm, but in Hungary they were called druggists,\nmaking cologne water, things like that. It had nothing to do with what we call drugs today.\nIt was not a pharmaceutical company. And my, at that time, in Hungary and in Europe, it\nwas the custom of middle-class families to send their daughters to secretarial school and then\nhave them work for a few years for some firm, hoping that they\u2019re going to catch a husband.\nAnd my mother caught my father there, which was very much to the dislike of her family\nbecause my father, they felt, was much below their class and they made him feel that way in\nall his life. Of course, I cannot really say what would have happened after World War II\nbecause my mother\u2019s entire family was wiped out, practically. Only a few people who lived\nin Budapest remained. So, but I resented them for a very simple reason, that they looked\ndown on my father who I thought was a, was a very, was a man of integrity and, and hard-\nworking, a good human being.",
        "A: I had a very strange relationship with my mother\u2019s family, especially my grandparents\nbecause they were very religious and I was born irreligious and whenever I had to visit with\nthem they forced me to wear a hat even in the middle of the summer and eat a certain kind of\nvery strict kosher food, go to the synagogue every night and pray and, and in general, they\nconsidered me some kind of a, what they call in Yiddish a shaygets, somebody who 1s kind\nof just an outsider because I never really went along with their, with their religious rules. I\nalso resented the fact that my grandmother was kind of a, of a, of a very angry person. I felt\nthat, that the way she treated others and the way she treated my grandfather, I resented that.\nI didn\u2019t like to go there and my mother, of course, always wanted me to go and visit and I\nhave, I just finally decided to take my revenge so I would not have to visit anymore. And\none day, this was, I must have been about eleven or so, I went to a butcher shop, got a huge\nham hock and got out and when the people went to the synagogue Friday night, I was eating\nit without a hat and pretty soon they were reporting it to her and they were coming and that\nwas my last visit. They immediately sent me back to Budapest and I never had to visit again.",
        "A: Yes. My mother was very angry, but my father and I, we always had some kind of an\nunderstanding. Even when he scolded me for something that, that had something to do with\nreligion to go along with my mother, I sensed in his voice that it was not serious, that he just\ndid it for my mother\u2019s sake. And I also found out since, between 1948 and 1950, I went to\nIsrael, I was in Israel which we will come back later, when I came back and I spoke Hebrew,\nI realize that my father doesn\u2019t know how to pray, that he just mumbles the words. He has\nno idea, what really, how to even pronounce them and he did this all for, for the love of my,\nmy, my mother and I appreciated this, that he put up this pretense but it was an interesting\ndiscovery for me, that. So he never, he never really scolded me and he was practically\ninfluential after the war to put down his foot and say, forget about kosher anymore, let\u2019s just\neat what is available. And so we did not have a kosher household anymore.",
        "A: Yes, yes, they weren\u2019t. They were Jews, they never, they never doubt their Jewishness.\nThey knew they were Jews but they were secular Jews, you know? And interestingly, quite\na few of them survived because of the place where they lived. Since they lived in a\nProletarian tenement of\u2014city tenement\u2014that was given to people under a certain income\nwho had too many children and not enough income, there, the Communist Party, the illegal\nCommunist Party had a very strong hold on this area and when, then, the World War II came\nand the Nuremburg laws and everything else, some of these Communist leaders, Communist\nmembers, came and actually rescued members of the family. I have an uncle in Hungary and\nhe, for example, was a very good friend of a past Communist prime minister who just died\nrecently because they practically lived side by side. So a great deal of the Hungarian\nleadership, Communist leadership, came from this tenement. So that helped rescue them.\nThe Communists were the only, the only group you could really turn to, during those terrible\nyears that, that would help you.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. My, my father always talked to me and said go, you know, to the synagogue,\nyour mother wants you to go and all this and that, but he never really did anything to force\nme to do whatever with religion. He just asked me to respect my mother\u2019s wishes and so I\nhad Bar Mitzvah and that was the last thing that I did. After my Bar Mitzvah I never\nprobably went to synagogue again unless it was a tourist attraction, I just, wanted to see what\nit is, inside. And, but I never denied my Jewishness so when my grandchildren especially\nask me about religion, I say Iam a Jew but I\u2019m not Jewish. And they ask me, \u201cHow can that\nbe?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s easy.\u201d",
        "A: No, not really. It\u2019s a strange thing that I have never been somebody who believes in the\nsupreme being and so maybe, eventually, my lot, this is going to be difficult, but because\nthey say people who have faith, they die much easier than the ones who don\u2019t, but I always\njust associated with people who practically felt the same way and it never caused any\nproblems so far in my life, in my sixty-six years. But I can\u2019t remember when I really\nhonestly believed in a supreme being. And then of course, the war probably wiped out, if I\nhad any doubts.",
        "A: My relationship with my father was always very good. I [indecipherable], I considered him\nalways my, my example, my hero, and I was very very upset when in 1942, he was taken\naway and sent to a labor camp in Yugoslavia. And when he came back in 1945, he, of\ncourse, I was overwhelmed and in my memory too, even though I spent more time with my\nmother, a lot more than with my father because he was also a traveling salesman for a long\ntime and I only saw him on weekends, somehow my memory is much more blurred when it\ncomes to my mother than when it comes to my father. My mother, one reason it might be\nthat my mother died in 1970 and my father died in 1980, so he survived ten more years and\nsince we lived in Europe from \u201974 on, at least for six years I had a lot more contact with him\nthan I would have if I had stayed in the U.S. I always considered him an absolute statue of\nintegrity and, and honesty and he was always looking out for my interests and I, even though\nwhen I as an American, had a very nice living, I made a very nice living and I didn\u2019t need\nany, any material, he was still saving and collecting things for us in Hungary and was always\ngiving us a lot of things when we went to visit him and we kept telling him that he should\nspend it on himself. He, he was just one of the most unselfish people I have ever met in my\nlife.",
        "A: Yes, always, always. He was always that way. Just a very simple, very simple man. Very,\nextremely intelligent, uneducated but a true human being. And with my mother, I always\nhad a little bit of my doubts that she\u2019s not as straightforward as my father. And there were\nlittle incidents that kind of, as a child, it\u2019s amazing how it gets engraved in your mind and\nyou cannot get rid of it. And the thing that I was very, very bitter about, that I could never\nforgive my mother for, was that while my father was in concentration camp in Yugoslavia,\nshe took a little job and she worked for a drugstore in the center of Budapest. And next to\nthe drugstore was an antique store. Mr. Klein was the name of the man who owned and he\nliked my mother. My mother was a cute little creature and everybody liked her and so he\nwould wait for her when she closed this shop to escort her home because he lived the same\nway and I didn\u2019t see anything wrong with this, but they noticed how jealous I am of my\nmother and it\u2019s not that I wanted to possess my mother, I just, I was protecting my mother\nfor my father and so he put his arm around my mother and they were looking at me and\nlaughing at how annoyed I became and this picture is constantly in my mind. And I could\nnever forgive my mother for this, that, that she did not realize how hurt I was by playing this\nsilly game. And she was, still she was a good person, she did everything possible to give me\na good education and, but, she had a very petit-bourgeois thinking and another thing that\nsomehow stood between the two of us was piano. She decided that I\u2019m going to be a great\npiano player and I decided that I have no interest in playing the piano and she would\nsometimes get so annoyed that I did not practice that she would take a rug-beater and run\nafter me and try to beat me but I was much faster than she was so we were running around\nthe table and then eventually she just broke down and cried that she couldn\u2019t catch me but\nshe had this obsession with, with, with piano playing and so again, ever since in World War\nII, our piano was destroyed. We gave it to somebody for safekeeping and they claimed that\nthe, the bomb got it, whatever, I was glad. She wanted to buy another piano and I said no.\nWhen I, when we came up from the cellar after liberation, I said, that\u2019s it. I am now a man.\nI basically rescued my mother more than once during World War II and I said no more piano\nand I never sat down to play the piano. Never. I never had the urge.",
        "A: My father\u2019s family was my favorite side of the family. I had a grandmother, a typical\nProletarian woman with thirteen children and not much of a husband. And I remember\ngoing out and loving every moment of spending time with them because here I came, I was\nthe, the, the second grandchild in the family. There was one older one who, unfortunately,\nduring the war, was killed. So I was kind of the sweetheart of everybody and they were\npampering me and taking me to places and my grandmother, I remember, had a tremendous\nknowledge of how to make beans in at least fifteen different ways. There were beans every\ntime I went out, they had beans, beans, but she was just a marvelous woman, a very warm-\nhearted, a typical country woman. She came from southern Hungary from a very small\nvillage and after raising thirteen children during the day, she left them in the care of my\nfather and then went from door to door selling silk stockings just to add a little bit to the, to\nthe income. The, my father\u2019s brothers and sisters were, of course, some of them are only just\na few years older than I am, so they were almost like brothers and sisters to me at that time\nand since there was no money at all in the family, they resorted to somehow, illegal things. I\nremember I loved ice skating and they said, oh no problem and they took a huge scissor\u2014\npair of scissors\u2014and cut a big hole and pushed me through the hole into the ice skating rink,\nnearby, so we always went ice skating. A lot of things were solved not by very legal ways,\nbut as a child, this was life to me. There were a lot of children in the tenement constantly\nhorsing around and nobody, nobody was constantly bothering me and, and, and disciplining\nme and getting ahead or going to the synagogue, nothing. It was a great freedom and I just\nenjoyed it very very much.",
        "A: Any of my father\u2019s brothers or sisters?",
        "A: Let\u2019s see, did I? No, I really had a very, very good relationship with all of them, with\npractically all of them. And I cannot really say that one or the other, I liked one particularly\nand interestingly, I spent the least time with him. He was a, just kind of a very outstanding\nfigure, a tall, very mascular [sic] man who went to Czechoslovakia during the War, World\nWar II and somehow worked for a shoe factory, which was a very famous shoe factory all\nover the world, Bata, got married there and came once to visit us and I still remember his\nvisit. I was so impressed with him, with his, there was just an air about this man that\nimpressed me a great deal and, unfortunately, when there was the big uprising, there was a\nbig Slovakian uprising against the Germans in 1944, and he was an officer in the, in this\nuprising, in the Partisan Army, and they caught him and he was hanged. So, we knew this\nfor sure because his wife survived the war, he was a Gentile and he has two children living in\nSwitzerland today. One, I\u2019m sorry, one, the other one is a stepbrother. He has one and I met\nhim and so I knew the story. But, this, this was the man who, to me, was an outstanding\nrepresentative of my father\u2019s side of family. But, today, there are only two men and one\nwomen [sic.] left of the thirteen. I mean, they\u2019re in their late seventies, so, but on my\nmother\u2019s side, no brothers, no brother, no sister, practically. I only have one cousin left on\nmy mother\u2019s side in Budapest today. He\u2019s younger than I am, so, that\u2019s.",
        "A: I was an avid cyclist. I loved to, I loved to bicycle. I would come home from school and\nimmediately take off and go, there was a big park, we lived near the, the, we lived on the\nPest side and there was a so-called rose garden in the center of Pest and that\u2019s where I met\nwith my friends every afternoon. And we were comparing our bicycles. Bicycles were the\nsame as cars today for us. I mean, it was, it was a thing and we admired the one who had the\ncustom-made one or had just even custom-made parts, and so we had big races on bicycle\nand then that was it, so I was heartbroken when in 1944, one of the first things we had to take\nin when the Germans occupied Hungary was the bicycle and the radio. And I lost it. I also\nbelonged to an underground Boy Scout group, I was an avid underground Boy Scout. The\nreason I say underground because we couldn\u2019t be legal Boy Scouts. The Boy Scout\nmovement, which was based on brotherhood and equality of all, declared that Jews are not\nequal and therefore all Jewish Boy Scout organizations were disbanded and Jews were also\nthrown out of those Boy Scout groups that were not affiliated with some Jewish school or\nsomething. I belonged to the so-called Three-Hundred Ten, number Three-Hundred Ten\nJokay Mor Boy Scout group. Jokay Mor was a famous Hungarian writer, a humanist. He\nwas not Jewish but he was a humanist. And we met illegally, sometimes in the basement of\nsynagogues and then we had to split up later into smaller groups and it was in, in homes, in\none, the small groups consisted of about ten, between ten and fourteen people and so we just\nrotated and did all kinds of things, besides hiking, we were building model airplanes and did\nwhat, what Boy Scouts usually do, otherwise. I have always, always dreamt these days, I\nhad always dreamt about one day having a uniform. The uniform was unbelievably\nimportant for me, like most kids of my age at that ttme. And I was always dreaming about it\nand at school, I just looked at my classmates who were, of course, Christians and could wear\nthe uniform and just, I dreamt about that one day, I\u2019m going to have a uniform and the sad\nthing is that after the war, when we met for the first time, those who survived in our group,\nand we went to get the uniform and we put it on and all of a sudden, to most of us, it didn\u2019t\nmean anything anymore. We were, it\u2019s hard to say, either we were too old or too cynical by\nthat time to really attach any importance to the uniform, so I never wore it again.",
        "A: Yes, I have always attended a secular school, except my first fourth grades were in a, the\nJewish orphanage ran a school, it was basically a secular school, but the Jewish orphanage\nwas in charge in order to have enough money to raise the orphans. So the orphans lived in a\ndorm while we who were coming from the outside, we had to pay tuition. And it was\nnearby, I spent four years there and then, middle school. I went to a secular state school,\nmiddle school because it was exactly next door to my house. And then, of course, came\nthe... 1944, and 1943-44, I couldn\u2019t go to high school. There\u2019s one incident in my middle\nschool that I felt had very, very important consequences for the rest of my life. We were, as\nbasically innocents abroad, to the point where I really didn\u2019t pay much attention to being\nJewish or not Jewish until this incident happened. In fifth grade, it was an art class and my\nart teacher was drawing something on the blackboard and we had to copy it, exactly. And\nthen color it exactly. And he came by and for some reason, I used a different kind of color or\nsomething and he always walked around with a huge cane, which was not unusual in those\ndays for teachers because teachers...\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\nTape 1, Side B",
        "A: Yes, in fifth grade, the, the idea of art was for the art teacher to draw on the blackboard and\nthen for the rest of the class, class to copy it and color it. The, teacher came around and\nmade sure that everybody\u2019s following his instructions and just to emphasize that he means\nbusiness, he had a big cane in his hand and for some reason, I missed a couple of the colors\nand used something different. He became absolutely just, angry, unreasonably so and started\nto beat me to the point where I began to bleed through my nose. And I also became frantic\nseeing the blood coming from, from my nose and all this so Iran home. I mentioned before\nthat I lived next to the school. The other house was where we lived, apartment house. And I\nran up to my mother\u2019s, into my mother\u2019s arms and asked her to clean me up and come and\nbasically what I wanted is justice, I could not, even at the age of eleven, I couldn\u2019t believe\nthat this 1s going to be the way it is. And I wanted her to come in and do something about it.\nAnd after she cleaned me up she said, \u201cNow you must understand, a lot of things that you\ncannot understand now, I cannot go in and do anything, yes, except apologize for your\nbehavior.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat, what behavior, what did I do, used the wrong color,\u201d and she\nsaid, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t understand just now.\u201d [Clocks chiming] And the reason, what I left\nout was a very important thing. The teacher was yelling at me as I was running out of the\nclass, \u201cI hope you go to Palestine to sell oranges. That\u2019s where you belong.\u201d And so when I\ntold my mother, this is when her reaction came. So she came back to school with me and\ninstead of demanding some kind of a remedial action for this, apologized to the teacher. And\nI thought that was, that was a very strange thing. I didn\u2019t understand at that time. I did\nunderstand it, years later, that this was the only course she could, she could take. Obviously,\nshe was afraid that maybe they will kick me out of school if she does something else. And\nevery Jewish family, of course, wanted to have their son finish middle school. And that\nincident somehow frustrated me to the point, it created a mental block. I never drew or never\npainted in my life since. I am such idiot when it comes to, to do anything with my hands that\ninvolves drawing or painting that it is pathetic. When we play some games, for example,\nwith my friends, when I have to draw something, they can\u2019t believe that, they think my\nperception is that of a mentally retarded person and it is, it is ust a, just a block. However, I\nappreciate art very much. I never fail to go and see an exhibit of paintings and drawings. I\njust don\u2019t want to do it and I cannot do it myself. Now it\u2019s possible that this can be unlocked\nin time but by that time I won\u2019t be alive. So, I rather just leave this.",
        "A: No, my father was not around anymore. He heard it after the war and of course by that time,\nI could, I understood the whole situation better.",
        "A: ...Hit me for the first tume? Well, the first one, I remember was when I was six and I was\nplaying marbles with, with kids and I won. And one kid said, threw the marble down the\ngutter and said \u201cI\u2019d rather throw it down the gutter than to give it to a Jew.\u201d And I went\nhome and asked my mother, \u201cWhat, what does it mean?\u201d So, that really was the first time\nthat something like this hit me. And since I went to a Jewish school for the first four years, I\nwas not really exposed to things like this. But the minute I switched and in fifth grade,\neverything started. Luckily, there were some teachers of course, in our school who tried to\nmake up for this. And I remember a couple of them. Unfortunately, they\u2019re not alive\nanymore but they did everything possible to, to make our life a bit more civilized. And one\nof them was even fired because of that. But not everybody was like this.",
        "A: He was very protective of, of Jewish children and he was also fired because we had a special\nsubject called, how would I, how would I translate this, Defensive Studies, which meant,\nbasically, kind of a ROTC type, except it was sheer propaganda. We had to, the book\ncontained sentences that were so revolting as far as Hungary\u2019s neighbors were concerned.\nFor example, the Romanians were described as monkeys on a, on a tree, their intellectual\nlevel and, I mean, for every nationality that surrounded Hungary, they had a very derogatory\nterm. And, actually, the book was preparing you that one day we will get even. And what\nhe was, among other things, he was teaching this subject, and he said, \u201cPut the book away\nand let me tell you what life is about.\u201d And it was a very, very human, humanistic lecture\nthat he would give us every day. And, after the war, to our great satisfaction, but not\nsurprise, he was named as the first director of the Hungarian Academy of Physical Sciences,\nso, he, they recognized him. And he was then, I talked to him later and he was in the Illegal\nSocial Democratic Party, so that also helped him. But, there were teachers and I had a\nteacher, I don\u2019t even know if he had any political conviction, but he was a human being and\nhe always tried to mitigate any law, anything, but, but as a child, for example, even, even in\nmiddle school, I had to go once a week to three hours of, of labor, battalion practice. This\nwas one of the most humiliating experiences that anybody can have. They had the scum of\nearth in charge of us, it was not teachers or any... we had to report either at school or\nsomewhere on the outskirts of Budapest to a practice ground where these hired instructors\nthat were a lot worse than any drill instructor I have ever seen in any movie, any American\nmovie, because it\u2019s not that, it was not just the physical, the physical abuse can be tolerated,\nbut it is the mental abuse, but that was so, so bad, the way they called us everything, a Jewish\nthis and a Jewish that, and these were people hired to do this job and besides of marching\nand, and digging and building, constantly, we were abused and constantly even physically\nso. Many times they beat us and all this. And we had to go there about three hours on a\ncertain day. The Christians then went to three hours of practice of what you would call\ntoday ROTC. They had, they had marching drill practices and all this. But ours was\ncompletely different.",
        "A: What year? Well, I was in fifth grade, right, so it was about 1940 when I entered the middle\nschool. It was about 1940.",
        "A: Well, yes, in a sense, that some people in the family, such as my aunt, who was very young,\none of my father\u2019s sisters, and, was married also to a young, twenty-one or twenty-two year\nold man. He was called up to go to the eastern front and, and he go into labor battalions, in\n\u201941, I\u2019m talking about \u201941 because that\u2019s when Germany declared war, Germany attacked the\nSoviet Union. Immediately, the very young, I think twenty-one old Jewish men were called\nup. They had to go to a certain place in their own clothes. They didn\u2019t get any uniform,\nanything, and taken to the eastern front immediately for mine, got to, to pick up mines, okay?\nAnd many of them without any previous experience and, and, and any schooling as to how\nto do it, of course, blew up. Now, the reason I am mentioning this because my father\u2019s sister\nwho was very young and married to a young man, interestingly, when he was taken to the\nfront, for some reason, somebody made a mistake and his unit was issued Hungarian army\nuniforms.",
        "A: Her husband, yes, okay. And he then went to the photographer for something and just had a\npicture taken, proudly posing in a Hungarian military uniform, he sent home. By the time,\nthe picture arrived at home, he was dead. He was blown up on a mine. And this picture\ninitiated a whole avalanche of events in our family because my aunt who was an extremely\nshrewd person, used this picture to start, to basic... declaring herself first as half-Jewish,\nwhich was an exceptional position then. And as the Nuremburg laws were tightened more\nand more so, she took one more step and one more step and one more step in pushing this\nwhole idea that she\u2019s not really under this category of the Nuremburg laws. And it, the\nwhole thing accelerated to the point where the last, when the only way she could be declared\nan exceptional person, as they were called, which means that you\u2019re not considered Jewish,\nwas to take my grandmother down to the police station and that was a scene I remember: her\ntaking my grandmother down and my grandmother had to, under oath, sign an affidavit that\nshe is an, she was an illegitimate child because my grandmother was cleaning house for a\nlawyer, a Christian lawyer who was dead by that time, a bachelor. And she signed this\naffidavit which made her a, a Christian. And with a husband who died in military uniform,\nso he was obviously a Christian, with her mother signing this affidavit that she was\nillegitimate, and the father was a Christian, she practically cleared herself and then set out to\nsave the rest of the family. And, as I mentioned to you before, she did an excellent job up\nuntil 1944, October, that was the point where nobody could do anything anymore because\nhell broke loose in Hungary and the scum of earth, the worst elements, the so-called Arrow\nCross Party took over and ruled from October 15\" until January 18\" when Pest was\nliberated.",
        "A: Yes. Obviously, everybody experienced this because the men were away and there were\nvery, very few employers who would feel obligated to compensate the family. And so a lot\nof people were actually either starving, or the mother had to go and look for a job, or if the\nchildren were old enough, they had to go and work and do something. We were in a very\ngood position, my mother and I, for a while, because my father\u2019s employer felt obligated to\nsend us part of his regular monthly salary, so we did get money.",
        "A: Okay, my father was taken away several times. You know, Hungary was kind of a strange\npart of that Nazi area because the Hungarians, the Hungarian government has always been in\nthe hands of the aristocracy, Hungarian aristocracy, and the Hungarian aristocracy had no\ntaste for Jews but also had no taste for killing or murdering Jews. They were above this, and\nso therefore when the dictator of Hungary, Admiral Horthy, had to appoint a government,\nmost of the time that government would not eventually do everything that the Germans\nwanted them to do. So it was almost like playing musical chairs, I mean, Hungary\u2019s a very\nsmall country and you don\u2019t have that many politicians, aristocrats to go around, but almost\nthe same faces somehow appeared, if not as prime minister then maybe minister of interior,\nor something. So we really, up until 1944, we had a great deal of anti-Semitism, we had a\ngreat deal of persecution of Jews but we were not in fear of our lives. Because somehow that\nwas below the dignity of that class. Not only that, some of those aristocrats were very\nAnglophiles and had, during the war, connections with the British. And so in between, it\ndepended on which aristocrat was in charge of the country. Some of them were a little bit\nmore German-oriented than others. And when, and more German-oriented came into the\npicture because the Germans didn\u2019t like the one who was in office, then he ordered that so\nand so is going to go and serve in, these Jews will be taken to the labor battalion. My father\nwas in the labor battalion before he was taken to Yugoslavia but he was inside Hungary so\nwe could visit him, we could take food for him and eventually, when a new prime minister\ncame, he declared that anybody over let\u2019s say, forty-five can go home. So there was no fear\nof being killed just because you are, you\u2019re a Jew. Up until 1944, March, when the Germans\nmarched into Hungary.",
        "A: To go, yeah, we knew where he was. I remember, he was not far from Budapest for awhile,\nfor a few month, and then almost every weekend we took food down, we talked to him, he\nwas released, we could walk around a little bit. And so it was not the same thing as taken\naway to a faraway country where we had no idea what would happen to him. Now, there,\nthere, then in 1942, he was taken away for, for good. For some reason, and I cannot really\nremember exactly what happened and why. We had, probably, a more radical prime\nminister who yielded to the Germans and let this contingent of Jewish labor battalions go\noutside the country and he was then taken to Yugoslavia. I remember, even then, they, they\nwere told which railroad station are they going to be going through in Budapest and they\nallowed them to be there I think half an hour or an hour where we had a visit with him so we\ncould talk over a few things. And that was the last I saw him, then, for a couple of years\nuntil he came back after the war.",
        "A: He went to, he was 1n a copper mine 1n Bor, B, O, R which 1s I think the nearest 1s NiS which\nis Serbia today, the Serb Republic in Yugoslavia. And he was there, he was always telling\nme about what was, what was interesting, the various people who guarded them. They had\nCroats, they had German, they was all SS, Croat, Croatian SS, German SS, Hungarian, not\nSS, but Hungarian, and I think that they had something, I\u2019ve forgot what, but anyway,\nvarious nationalities were guarding them and probably Bosnians. And he mentioned when\nhe came home, interestingly, he said, \u201cSon,\u201d he said, \u201cwe never, we never really worried too\nmuch about anyone else guarding us except the Croatians.\u201d He said, \u201cWe had never seen\nsuch beasts as the Croatian SS was.\u201d They called them UstaSas, you know. He was there\nand I think, I, this is probably much better written than in my memory, I think about one\nhundred fifty thousand were in this particular area where he was and what happened was\nwhen, when the Tito partisans were really pushing them back, The Germans decided to\nmarch them back toward Germany and in, in what is northern, what was northern\nYugoslavia at that time and previously back before 1918, was southern Hungary, they set up\nthese slaughterhouses, where those who survived the concentration camp were\nkilled and my father was in the last six thousand being marched and they were captured by\nTito\u2019s partisans. And then he was given a choice whether he could fight with the partisans,\nhe could work for the partisans, or they would allow him to go into an area that was already\nliberated and live there and they would supply him with enough food to survive until the war\nis over, they said. And he was a very strong man and very grateful that they saved his life\nand he volunteered to work. So he worked in a flour mill somewhere around and came\nhome with all kinds of documents and, and little medals that testified to the fact that he was a\ngood worker and did his share. And he was very proud of it, and when Stalin decided to\neradicate any of the memories attached to Tito, unfortunately we had to burn everything and\nwe had to throw away his medals because it was very dangerous to be in the possession of\nanything that connects you to Tito. People were hanged all the time without not much\nreason, let alone if they find something on you. So, he was very bitter about this, and this\nturned him against the Russians so in all his life he was very anti-Russian and very pro-\nYugoslavian. He would have been heartbroken to see what happened to Yugoslavia had he\nlived today.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\nTape 2, Side A",
        "A: Well, of course we were always afraid that he would not survive and we had no doubt that\nphysically he could survive but we were afraid that, that he would get killed. But an\ninteresting episode was that, [cough] excuse me, I asked him after the war, what, why did he\nsurvive if so many people died? And he had a little, just a short little anecdote, he said, \u201cSon,\nthere were two kinds of people in the concentration camp. We got a canteen of water every\nmorning. The one group drank the water immediately and the second group, such as myself,\ndrank half of the water during the day and we used the other half to wash ourselves.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cHalf a canteen of water would make you clean?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, but I felt like a human\nbeing, I was still caring about myself.\u201d And he said, \u201cAnd later on I understood a lot more\nabout this whole attitude that I\u2019m not going to lie down here and gulp down everything, I am,\neven though I am full of lice, I\u2019m still caring about myself.\u201d So that, basically, that was the\nattitude that saved, I\u2019m sure, that was who survived. And of course luck, because even with\nthis attitude somebody could have shot you if they didn\u2019t like your face or the way they\nmoved. Yes, we, my mother maintained of course like most wives that he\u2019s going to return,\nand she was right because even though we have not heard from him for a long time,\nespecially the last year when he was there, of course by that time, we couldn\u2019t have heard\nfrom him because he was already in the liberated area and we were in Hungary still, in the\nbattlefield. It was, however, just that, that deep feeling that he will come home. And he\ncame home in 1945, I remember late spring, it must have been April, May, probably, and he\ndid not just stop by and said, \u201cHere I am.\u201d He was afraid that maybe we would faint or\nsomething like that. He sent a friend up. A man came up and inquired about my father and\nvery slowly kind of asked, \u201cWhen did you hear from him?\u201d and all this, and \u201cDo you think\nhe\u2019s alive?\u201d and all this, and slowly he said, \u201cWell, I have a feeling that he is alive,\u201d and\nslowly he led us to this. I remember him coming up on the stairs with a rucksack. The\nrucksack was full of sausage and potatoes. And he knew that we were starving and so that\nwas it. Now, just to describe the situation in Hungary at that time and how you needed to be,\nto stay a human being, the, we did not live in our apartment, we were moved, because you\ncould not stay in your apartment. You had to move to first, to so-called Jewish houses that\nhad a big star on them and, eventually to the ghetto. And because of the history of this\nhouse, we did not move into the ghetto but this house Zichy street One, was designated as a\nJewish house first. So, in the meantime, we moved out of, of our apartment in, that was\n1944, summer when you had to leave your apartment. We, the neighbors came, some of\nthem, and said \u201cWe will keep this for you, and keep this for you,\u201d and needless to say, that\nnot one thing eventually survived again. Or resurfaced again. They all, either the Russians\ntook it, or the bombing or everything. It\u2019s all disappeared, and what could you do about it?\nYou said okay. But people were in a way like vultures, they were just circling around and\nsee, you know, what they can take. And then the apartment was given, all these Jewish\napartments were given to bomb those people whose... Gentiles whose houses were bombed\nand they couldn\u2019t live in anymore. And I had no idea of course what happened to our\napartment. We lived in a street called Rottenbiller Street, 66\u00b0, and I, my first thing, we were\nliberated on January 18 and the first thing I went back to see, what, what happened to our\napartment because we left, believe it or not, a few boxes of linen there, just when we left.\nWe just, we couldn\u2019t do anything with it, so. And when I came, when I went up there, I had\nthis tremendous chip on my shoulder that I\u2019m going to show these people whoever are there,\nthat within two hours, I said I\u2019m going to give them two hours to get out of here. And here I\nwas a sixteen year old kid, barely sixteen, fifteen really, and telling them, here was a family\nand I was telling them to get out of here. And the family consisted of a mother, father, a\ndaughter and two sons. And they were tailors. And the old man was quite old, the father,\nwas telling me, he said, \u201cBut, but, where can we go?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy did you come\nhere?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, we have, we have no place. Our, our house was destroyed, and I\nmean we knew that this 1s, this was a Jewish apartment, but still 1t was between this or living\nin the street, in the cold snowy January,\u201d so he said, \u201cCould, could you do something, could,\ncould we somehow come to some kind of an agreement?\u201d And so my mother came up and\nshe said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just divide the place between us?\u201d And here it was a two room\napartment with their family, four people, five people in their families and two, my mother\nand I, and we decided that after looking at them and listening to them and all this, there was\njust something that all of a sudden hit me. My chip was gone and so we decided that yes, we\nwere going to, we'll, we\u2019ll make it. And so we lived there under the same roof and we\nbecame very good friends. And when my father came home in late spring, the new\ngovernment, Democratic government, devised this plan of each block had to elect a kind of a\nsmall council and the head of that council was quite powerful in deciding if there was an\nempty apartment or, almost like a Justice of Peace. They had certain tasks that they can\nperform, temporarily, they were deputized. And my father was appointed to do this because\nhe was always very much respected by the people there and the fact that he was now good,\nyou know, with the new regime. And next to us, an apartment was full of old, old women\nwho died one after another. It was a, like a Salvation Army place. They, they rented it and it\nbecame empty, so my father got the apartment for them and they moved over there so we\ncould get our apartment back, we lived there, but they could never really thank enough and\nwe, we kept this relationship for a long time and I\u2019m sorry I lost contact with them. But\nthen, we had an apartment and then we faced something else because then the Russians were\ncoming around and trying to find places for their soldiers and so they, they got, they got two\nold Russian soldiers from Siberia who were quartered in, in our apartment because two\nrooms were too many for three people. So, and I remember, they were very cute old men,\nwe had no, I mean we had sign language, we didn\u2019t speak Russian and the only incident I\nremember is that my mother, of all these sufferings, had one little symbol 1n her possession:\na bottle of very expensive cologne water that she kept. And she said, \u201cI am going to start\nusing this after the war, when we are all together and we live in peace.\u201d And so, and she\nkept it and she had it with her all the time. And so now, when we moved back, she, we got a\ntemporarily, kind of an armoir and she put it way back between sheets. Now one day we\n* When Robert lived there, the street number was 39. It was later changed to 66.\ncame home and my mother said, \u201cThis, this place smells like cologne water, very good\ncologne water,\u201d and she rushed to her cologne water in the armoir but these two Siberians,\nRussians were very hard pressed to get alcohol, anything, they would drink. I mean, there\nwere stories that I can\u2019t believe, that they went to the museum and drank alcohol out of these\nscientific lab experiments and\u2014including embryos\u2014but I never believed those stories, but\nthis is true. They drank my mother\u2019s cologne water. They were so, so hard pressed for\nalcohol. And that was about our only experience with Russians in our house. Otherwise,\nmost people lost their watches. They were very hard pressed for watches. It was a time\nwhen nobody in his right mind would walk around in Budapest with a watch on his wrist.\nThey just, they were fascinated. They stop you and they took your watch. That was their,\ntheir, their thing. Well, anyway, okay, ask.",
        "A: Yeah, two.",
        "A: No, no, no. This was during the Russian occupation.",
        "A: Oh yes. I\u2019m talking about after, this all happened after. Oh no, there were no Russians\nduring the German occupation. I wish there were. No.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Mostly Jewish. There were a few Gentile friends who never, ever mentioned religion,\nnever really made us feel inferior, just a few. And after the war, I made it clear how much I\nappreciated it. So, I\u2019m glad that I could do that. Now, I also have to say that not many of\nmy classmates survived because my Jewish classmates were in a labor battalion and they\nwere working outside Budapest on the day when the deportations came to that village. And\nthe gendarmerie had an empty boxcart and they decided not to let them go home but deport\nthem. So very few Jewish classmates of mine survived. Gentiles, again, the war, the army\neventually, everybody who was fifteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen at the end of the war, the\nlast few months, the Arrow Cross people, they forced children out into the street with a gun.\nSo quite a few of them did not survive. I really had very few contact with, with, with the\nfew that survived but there weren\u2019t too many.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Yes. And my father was very grateful to him and worked for him again after the\nwat.",
        "A: Yes. I also took a job. I was a messenger boy up until 19... until the yellow star came into\nexistence... \"44 March. I was a messenger boy for architectural firm. Because of the\nbicycle. I could bicycle around then, so I was delivering messages and things. So, that\nsupplemented also, my father\u2019s salary which wasn\u2019t a full salary, just part of it.",
        "A: Yes. 1944, March, if I remember it, 19, is when the Germans had serious doubts\napparently, that Hungary is not a trusted ally anymore, that Hungary probably entertains the\nidea of getting out of the war because by that time I think Romania was ready to jump and\nthe situation in Italy was very shaky so they decided to occupy Hungary officially and put in\na very right-wing government which was still a lot better than what came in 1944, October.\nThat will be the other stage. But let\u2019s take a look at what happened when the Germans\nmarched in, the yellow star had to be worn within a few weeks, or... So, the labor battalions\nwere more intensified. Now everybody who was eighteen had to go, that was now, they\nlowered the limit and the deportations started. So, unfortunately, that was the worst thing,\nthe deportations. They started in the countryside, eventually coming to Budapest. They\nwere supposed to come to Budapest, you know, by the fall.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That was just an, a coincidence, that my aunt, the one who gained this special status, said to\nme, \u201cPlease, I just have some very bad feelings, I don\u2019t want you to go today out and work.\nStay home, stay with me.\u201d She took me to her apartment and that was the day when it\nhappened. It was just a, just a miraculous instinct that she had. And that is what saved me.\nfeed yourself and your mother adequately?",
        "A: Well, what I did was, I gathered, I was always quite street smart and so I somehow found\nthat the best way to do this whole thing is first to get some papers that would qualify us\u2014at\nleast to those who don\u2019t know us\u2014as Christians. So I took my mother\u2019s jewellries, sold it,\nand bought papers. And the papers were blank and you had to fill it out. And I did that.\nAlso, I got some papers and I fill it out with the same name from a cousin of mine who was\nadopted but had birth certificate and everything else that pertained to the fact that he was a\nGentile. And his parents gave me his papers too so I had kind of this double insurance,\nmoving around, in case I needed it. For a while, I did not use these papers. I waited until,\nyou know, we got the point where it was necessary. Also, there was a danger that until the\nRussian troops did not cross the Hungarian border, it was a matter of a telephone call to find\nout if you had false birth certificates. All they had to do 1s call the principality, you know,\nand that, that municipality and check, okay? And so, actually, we waited until practically the\nfirst village fell and, after that, it was much easier to fill it out, to a town or a village that had,\nthat was already occupied under occu... Soviet occupation because they couldn\u2019t check\nanymore.",
        "A: Then, then, then we used the papers for awhile, but it was a, it was very confusing period\nwhen we were moving a lot. First, my wife, my mother and I moved to the, the apartment of\none of my father\u2019s friends. They were Seventh-Day Adventists. And they offered their\nplace but soon they learned that Seventh-Day Adventists are just in the same danger as Jews\nso after consultation, we left. Then we were, we went to a, I was always on the street,\nhearing, feeling, looking, what can happen? Then I took my mother to a Jewish high school\nwhich was designated as a clothing supply business for the Hungarian army and it was really\na refuge for, for Jews. They were sewing uniforms for the army and it was established by\nold Hungarian Jewish army officers who wanted to save their skin and their family and hired\nfake guards in uniform to come in and out of the place, putting on a show and inside they\nwere actually really making, sewing uniforms and delivering it to the army and, and, so I was\nalways, it was just constantly you had to change your position and you had to always look at\nwhat seems safe at the moment. And it is possible that something that was safe one week\nbecame unsafe the next week because somebody recognized one person in that place when\nhe was walking down the street, going into places, \u201cHere is a Jew, doesn\u2019t wear a yellow\nstar, what is he doing?\u201d And so, your life depended on nuances, those days.",
        "A: My aunt is the one who just ripped off the yellow star and said, \u201cYou stay with me,\u201d and\nthen my mother came there, too. And this is how we got to this house in Zichy Jeno Street,\nOne, in the Fifth District of Budapest.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, we, whenever there was a, up until we had to leave our own apartment, when there\nwas a bombing we lived in the cellar, you know, sometimes for hours. But usually, the\nbombings came at night, so, I, one thing that war taught me how to be very organized\nbecause there was no light. You couldn\u2019t turn on the light. No, that was a major offense. If\nthey saw any light, when the sirens went off, they, they considered you collaborating with\nthe, with the enemy, you know, giving signals. So, I had to lay out all my stuff and in the\ndarkness I could pick every one of my clothes and still do, to run down. We had seconds to\nrun down in the bombing, started. Usually, there was no really intense bombing of\nBudapest. Most of the bombers, many times, Americans, were flying over to Romania, to\nPloesti, to bomb the oil fields. There was really not much to bomb in Budapest, was not very\nbadly bombed. Budapest was, Budapest was mainly destroyed during that siege from\nDecember until January 18. That was the main reason for the destruction. But before that,\nthere was not that much.",
        "A: It was late fall, in 1944, you know. Late fall that... when we felt that that place was the best\nplace to be. And then it turned out to be a very fortunate choice because in that house, there\nwas a famous Hungarian psychiatrist. Psychiatry was, in Hungary, at the very, very early\nstage. This man became very famous and since there weren\u2019t too many, a great deal of his\nclientele were famous politicians, actors, actresses, writers. So he was well-known all over\nthe place and he had this idea that he is going to save his family and friends by number one,\ncontacting a fascist officer and I\u2019ve no idea how he did it, who wants to save his skin and is\nwilling to play this game of declaring the house a clinic and, and do everything possible to\nsave the people inside the house and then he found this man and his name was Jereczian Ara\nGeorge. And this is in reverse order because Hungarian names are in reverse order. The last\nname is what we consider first so in English you would say George Ara Jereczian. The, I\nremember him, a very handsome man, a very, kind of a man of stature and a fascist uniform,\nhand grenades hanging from his belt. I mean, he was intimidating to anyone. To, with us, he\nwas very kind. The, I suppose, looking back that we about three hundred doctors and\nfamilies in that apartment house jammed, absolutely jammed. While we could still live\nupstairs, probably there were at least five to ten people to a room. When we lived in the\nbasement, no one is to tell, we were just side by side on mattresses because when the siege of\nBudapest started, you couldn\u2019t live upstairs anymore. So this man moved in with a few of\nhis men who apparently were loyal to him and his girlfriend and they set up their\nheadquarters there and they were practically like a, a, a support group. The clinic had its\nofficial emblem there and the whole operation looked like it was a legal operation to save\nanybody who 1s injured. \u2018Kay? Now, we\u2019re at the end?",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\nTape 2, Side B",
        "A: It was, it was in 1944, [coughs] excuse me. After I finished what would be eighth grade\nhere, it was the fourth grade of middle school and I was supposed to then go to what they\ncall gymnasium, which is high school in Europe. I could not get into a high school and so it\nwas not a long period but between 1944, I have to figure this out. Let\u2019s see, 1925, 40, right.\nSo there was a year, \u201943 because I was, I left the school, \u201943 so I had one year when actually\nI didn\u2019t do much except odd jobs. My father was away, so, as I mentioned before I\ndelivered, worked for an architectural firm and delivered blueprints, whatever I can find but I\ncould not get into high school. The higher four grades of high school, the gymnasium. And\nso my mother suggested that we hire a tutor so by the time I would be available for high\nschool, I wouldn\u2019t miss much. And this is why I had a private tutor. I was studying\nespecially Latin because everybody suggested that that would probably create a problem\nwhen all of a sudden I, war would be over\u2014we were always optimists\u2014and I could go to,\ninstead of the first form to the second form and Latin would create the biggest problem. So\nfor Latin and Algebra, I had a tutor, somebody in, in my mother\u2019s distant family, who lived\nin Budapest. And this is how the year went by. There was really not much else, a little work\nand a little study.",
        "A: Yes. My mother somehow, well, first of all the BBC, of course, unfortunately told us what\nhappened to the Jews who were taken away to concentration camps and death camps but by\nthe that time it was well known in Hungary too, what the deportations, how the deportations\nend up. So my mother was extremely upset, for understandable reasons and I really had to\nkind of keep her spirit up and, constantly reminding her that there are certain things we can\u2019t\nchange and she still has to live for her own little immediate family. But yes, we were very\nmuch aware, very much aware. And even though it was very, very difficult to get BBC and\nup until 1944, March, or April when the radios had to be turned in, we could still get BBC.\nAnd I learned from my father, I was six years old when I learned from my father that there is\nmore to news than just the Hungarian papers and the Hungarian radio. He would close the\nshutters at certain times, he always changed the times, of course, he would lock the doors\nand he would listen to BBC. At a very early age and would tell me that this is the truth.\nEventually, it became very dangerous because the Germans would have a device that was on\ntop of a car, similar probably to what radar is today, that would circle and try to find people\nwho listened to foreign broadcasts. And it was punishable also by going to concentration\ncamp.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. [talkover] Well, I think this is in the Jewish nature, if you consider the fact that\npeople in boxcars going to Auschwitz were still running schools, right? It\u2019s just that, this\npart of the, of the optimism and the fact that you have to learn, learn and learn. That was\nwith us. That kind of a feeling never left us and we never really gave up.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. She was. And she was just a distant cousin of my, my mother and she, I\neventually met her when I was in Israel, again. She emigrated to Israel.",
        "A: No, those who were in the house, they were allowed to stay, which is obvious, I mean,\nanybody who would have been tossed out would have had to go to the ghetto. And it was, to\nmost people, it was clear that eventually the ghetto 1s going to be annihilated. There was no\nother way, since Budapest was surrounded by then by the Soviet forces, what else can you\ndo with it? They built a huge wooden wall around the ghetto and, according to the rumors,\nthey would just detonate the whole thing or burn it down or, but they would not let the Jews\nsurvive if the siege had lasted another week or so. The lucky thing is that they just ran out of\ntime. I, of course I was never in the ghetto, but no, those who were in the house, they could\nstay, and a lot of other families moved in, practically all of them connected to famous\nHungarian doctors.",
        "A: It was a Jewish house.",
        "A: Yes. It was a Jewish house. It had, it was a designated Jewish house.",
        "A: Well, about at least ten other members of our family. Some other aunts and brothers of my\nfather, my mother, of course, and I. I say, and it was a, about one and a half room apartment\nand there were plenty of people in it. But that was the, the least of our problems, really, you\nknow. We could, we could sleep very well. There were a lot worse arrangements in\nBudapest at that time. There were, there were people in Swedish-protected houses in, near\nthe Danube, where, I understand, people couldn\u2019t even sleep. They just were, you know,\npractically back to back in a room, there were so many people jammed in. This is the one\nthat Wallen... what was his name, the Swedish diplomat, Wallenberg, the one, that was his\nlittle area, Raoul Wallenberg. But I never, I went a couple of times by, but I never went up\nbut I noticed that there just, there were just lots of lots of people.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. And interestingly, I can remember that a couple of non-Jewish families stayed\nthere. They just stayed there. By that time, perhaps what went through their mind is, that,\nsince the war inevitably is coming to an end, it\u2019s not a bad idea to be here when the Soviet\ntroops come. So that must have been their reasoning. And it was not, not impractical,\nactually. At the same time, even in the last week, we were in danger of being taken to the\nDanube, that was the, the most common way of getting rid of Jews who were discovered\noutside the ghetto, marched down and shot into the river. It was a cold, bitter, snowy winter\nand the Danube was red and full of corpses. But I remember that even the last week,\nsomebody from the neighborhood reported us to the fascist authorities and they came and\ntried to disarm Jereczian Ara George\u2019s own people in the house, the bodyguards. And he\nseemed, he almost seemed helpless. We were already lined up and then he again arrived\nthere, amazingly, he did this more than once, with some paper from a very special higher\nauthority that said, \u201cClear out of here. This is a protected territory and we do our job for the\ngovernment and leave us alone.\u201d We confronted the man after the war. I know that. He was\ncaught, the one who reported us because he was stupid enough to show up the last week\nbefore Budapest was, Pest was occupied, and pointed fingers. I also remember another man\nwho was a fascist officer that lived a couple of houses across from us who was also quite\nantagonistic toward us and we were worried about him. And also the last week, they brought\nhim in with a head injury. He was shot in the head in the street fighting. There was\ntremendous street fighting and he was just left there to die. And I don\u2019t know, I was just\nfascinated by, by this man that, that everybody was always afraid of and here he was,\nbasically a nothing anymore, you know. And in spite of my good judgement, I watched him,\nkept going back to him, as a young man all night, watch him how he was dying. And I can\u2019t,\nI still cannot explain this fascination, because ever since I couldn\u2019t look at another human\nbeing, even an animal that is dying. But somehow, there was a mixed feeling in me of\nrevenge and satisfaction that this scum 1s, is not going to be here any longer and I wanted to\nsee how he was going. And my mother, I remember scolded me for this and constantly was\ntaking me back to our place, where we, our sleeping arrangement was. But, there, there were\nincidents like this and it was a very, very strange period for a fifteen-year-old boy. My job\nwas basically to take legs and arms up that were cut off, operated on in the so-called\noperating room which was a, a dark part of the basement and kind of arrange them on the, in\nthe courtyard. And when in, when in January 18\", we went up, upstairs, everybody was\nhorrified. There were huge piles of limbs just piled up on the courtyard. And most of it, I\nhad to pile up because I was the one who was always sent up with these. The doctors\noperated without any anesthesis [sic], anything. There were, there were, there was nothing\nand it, of course, the survival ratio probably was minimal, you know. But that, whenever I\nlook into that house, that always comes to my mind, how these houses survive. We die but\nthey keep their secrets.",
        "A: I have a feeling that most of them did because my father\u2019s brothers wore the uniform of a\nmilitary police and again, because of their, their origin from this working, workers\u2019\nneighborhood, they got papers and they got uniforms. They were supplied with everything,\nboth of them. So.",
        "A: I was, only when, when on the street, they stopped me and asked for papers. That was the\nonly time I used mine. And, by the last, I would say the last few weeks it didn\u2019t mean\nanything if they stopped a man because they didn\u2019t even ask for papers. They asked for you\nto drop your pants. And since in Europe, only Jews are circumcised, it was very easy to\ndetect who was a Jew. And I have to thank, I mean my life was really saved by a man who,\namazingly appeared at the trme when I thought that this was my last moment on earth. I was\nsent out to get something, I think, if I remember correctly, I was sent out because a horse fell\non the street from shrapnels and we needed some meat. And the only kind of meat,\nwhenever we had meat, the only meat that we could get was horsemeat. And of fallen\nhorses, horses that were shot on the street, usually by airplanes. Airplanes flew very low and\nthey were just machine-gunning anything that moved. And I always ran out and I also\ncrawled out to get water. There were certain areas where a faucet was still intact and you\ncould get some water. And a patrol came and caught me and they said, \u201cOkay, here, come,\ncome into the doorway of this house,\u201d and they were shouting, yelling, \u201cThis looks like a\nJew and took off your pants, take off your pants,\u201d and they give me the order and I was kind\nof snow-white probably and shaking and all of a sudden another man with a much higher\nrank came and said to the guys, \u201cLook, I see four, five Jews on that corner. Go immediately,\nsee, catch those, I take care of this idiot here. And so we went under the doorway and I was\nunbuttoning my pants and kind of shaking and he said, \u201cListen,\u201d he said, \u201care you crazy?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where you come from, do you have a place where you were staying?\u201d\nI said yes. He said, he said, \u201cGo back and I don\u2019t ever want to see you again on the street.\u201d\nAnd we came out and he was hitting me and beating me and just and he said to these people,\n\u201cThis idiot, he\u2019s not a Jew,\u201d he said, \u201che\u2019s an idiot, a young idiotic kid who wants to be a\nhero apparently. Go back to your mother and don\u2019t ever leave the house.\u201d And I told my\nmother this story and of course, she never let me, the last week she never let me leave the\nplace, under no circumstances. And interestingly, about four, five weeks after we were\nliberated, I went to the UNRRA, the UNRRA was the U, N, R, R, A, that was the, the joint\ncommittee of the Jewish Relief and you could go there and you could get some emergency\nsupplies, food supplies, they were bringing them in. And who was at the door letting people\nin? I recognized this man. And I walked up to him, he had a huge, a big flag emblem on his\nlapel, the flag of what today is Israel, at that time it was a Zionist emblem. And I said to\nhim, I said, \u201cHey, you know, you saved my life?\u201d And he looked at me, he said, \u201cYou too?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cThere were many more.\u201d And turned\u2014he didn\u2019t really want me to elaborate or\nnothing. And there were many people like this. Now who they were, I was very curious and\nI went to find out and most of the people who were doing this were Polish Jews because a lot\nof them had very fair complexions. They were blond and blue-eyed and so, and they came\nto Hungary early, 1939 or so, and in four, five years, they learned enough Hungarian, and\ngood Hungarian so they had very little accent and they could pass as, there were other people\nin the Arrow Cross movement who had accents, so quite a few of them were in the Arrow\nCross movement. And in the Zionist Underground so, that was a lucky, a lucky accident for\nme.",
        "A: During the siege? Well, during the siege. . .",
        "A: Oh, well they, they did it, the, the man I told you who saved us, he had good source of\nsupply. So, there was always a center of supply. The only thing that we could not get was of\ncourse, what did we get, flour and beans. These were the two and soya. People made, there\nwas incredible things out of soyabeans. I have great respect for soyabeans. They made\nsausage, they made, you name it, and it all tasted like real sausage or soyabread was\nmarvelous. And they made bread of rice and just invented all kinds of things that they had\nnever eaten before. But the, the big thing was meat. Everybody wanted to have meat so we\nalways watched out, looked out for horses, horses. And you should have seen, when a horse\nfell on the street, ah, everybody was running with huge knives and carving it out and running\nback into the basement because . . .",
        "A: No, nobody in, nobody, nobody in this house wore stars. Okay? Nobody, that was a taboo.\nNo. And that was his order. \u2018Kay? We were exempt, because a lot of things that he told us,\nit was not true, 1t was just to boost our confidence but by that time there was such confusion\neverywhere, in higher government places that who, who knows what was really the truth and\nwhat was not? Only he can.",
        "A: No, no. We did, we had pretty good organization. No, he was the one who secured the food\nby, you know, sending a contingent of people to, to get it and then we brought it back and\nthen we, we divided it. He had his little place there and he was just, these are all intelligent\npeople and very disciplined people. He did not have to go down personally and do anything,\nreally. All we needed him for is to, to, to help us survive, to, to protect us from the outside\nworld. But inside, we organized everything ourselves.",
        "A: Some way, yes. Yes. They had to. They had to, they did something. Okay, at least, if\nnothing else on paper. My mother was a nurse, for example.",
        "A: Well, I was, what they called, I was a messenger, you know, I was an errand boy. I was\nfifteen, and so, that was, I had a little uniform and a gray overall with a, kind of a military\ncap. But I was in charge of taking the, the severed things up.",
        "A: I, did I have, yes, I had a friend. And it was the first time in my life that I really felt a sexual\nattraction toward a woman. And I was kind of a cute little kid and she was a lot older than I.\nAnd I think under different circumstances, probably, we would have been much cozier but it\nwas, there were too many people around. I liked her. She was a, believe it or not, there was\na, among other things, there was a famous Hungarian Jewish comedian who also ended up in\nour, in our place. Alphonso. And this was the other half of his act, a young woman. And\nwe became good friends and I had all kinds of fantasies about her and maybe she, too, about\nme. But my mother was around and too many people and so our attraction never really came\nto anything else, but just that. But we spent a lot of time together and, and, and it was just a\nnice puppy love, I think, that I\u2019ve had for the first time in my life with an older, somebody\nwas at that time older, not too old. I think she was in her early twenties or so, but I was just\nfifteen. And the, I also had a strange relationship with an Italian girl. The Italian\ngovernment of Badoglio (ph), that was his name, his Air Force chief I think, or Air Force\nminister had a Hungarian Jewish wife and when things got very hot in Italy, he brought her\nback to Hungary because he felt that in Hungary she has a better chance of survival, being\nthe wife of the famous Italian Air Force general. In Italy, everybody knew that she was\nJewish and they were afraid of deportation. So, and he had a daughter, and somehow I had a\nlot of friends in the Italian school in Budapest, the Italian embassy maintained a school. And\nI fell in love with this girl. And the stupid thing, the reason this ties in with this story, the\nstupid I did was, during the terrible, during those terrible days of siege, whenever I had some\nfood like horsemeat or something, I would walk, they lived about a half an hour from our\nhouse and I would walk on the street, of course walk, try to run from one block to another,\nvery close to the walls to deliver food to this girl and to her mother. And, and I felt that this\nwas my obligation and it was a stupid thing to do.\nEnd of tape 2, Side B\nTape 3, Side A",
        "A: Holczer.",
        "A: Well, if I remember correctly, we did not play any games because the day went by with\nconstantly watching out to survive. We watched the streets, we listened to the radio. I\nremember that I was terribly concerned with the expression of adults around me, I watched\ntheir faces. I always suspected that they know more than what they would tell me and\nsomehow, in the last few weeks, I just became obsessed with, with this business of survival.\nI couldn\u2019t think of anything else and my uncle, who is, the one who is still alive, reminded\nme that my constant question to him was, practically hourly, \u201cHow long will this last? How\nlong will this last?\u201d This was my constant question. I was just counting the hours. We knew\nthat the, that the streetfighting between the Germans and the Russians cannot be more than a\ncouple of city blocks away. We saw German soldiers, insured, moving down the street and\nwe heard, practically, the gunfire as if it were next to us. Some people came in injured who\nreported that just a couple of blocks from us there were already Russian soldiers so it was\nthat, that, that tension that kept me from doing anything else except just waiting for that final\nonslaught when I can see that our area is liberated. There was just no mood for playing. We\nwere not children. None of us were children. We were, all our conversations, I remember,\nwith the, with the kids of my age down there, all, everything was always revolving around\nsurvival.",
        "A: No, before the actual siege, yes, I, 1 still contacted sometimes my old Boy Scout comrades,\nthey were the ones that I kept up with. But once of course, the siege started then, there was\nno chance to, to go out and do anything like that.",
        "A: Oh yes, well, remember these were not school, these were not school people, I told you that.\nNo, these are all from various, the Boy Scout group, the membership consisted of people\nfrom anywhere in Budapest and for various areas and quite a few of them survived. So, even\nafter the war, of course, we met for awhile and then we decided there is nothing in it for us\nanymore and that\u2019s when I joined the Zionist Movement. That gave me a lot more important\ngoals than the Boy Scouts.",
        "A: No. Some of them did go in, you know, some of them did go in. But others weren\u2019t. And\nSO Wwe communicated and visited with a couple of, who were outside.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Strictly, you know, strictly so. We didn\u2019t want any conversation, any, any public\nplace that can be overheard. Because our main concern was the kind of topic that others\nshouldn\u2019t hear.",
        "A: Well, where are the Russian forces? What did you hear? All this. What did the radio say?\nWe didn\u2019t have any radios, the Jews, right? But those who were hiding, and were perhaps\nwith a Christian family, they could still listen to BBC so that was the, the entire existence\nwas the war and the topics were just that.",
        "A: Well, theoretically, we were supposed to treat fascist officials according to all the papers and\nthe, the permit that our leader, you know, had. But there was such chaos in the last few\nweeks, you know, when the siege of Budapest started, that we treated everybody who came\nin from the street who was injured. And it was pathetic, sometimes, that people would come\nin with some very minor problems and leave the clinic, and within minutes they were\nbrought back with, with practically their guts out. In other words, in order to reach us, they\nwent through such danger that they lost their lives, eventually. We had, we had no medicine\nleft, we had practically nothing. So we couldn\u2019t do much. Anybody, anybody was treated.\nAnd doctors are doctors. I was always interested in, especially when there was a fascist\nofficial, what did they do to him? Would they take advantage of the fact that here we are,\nyou know, lost all family members and all this, but I talked to, this interested me and I talked\nto some of the doctors and they said there\u2019s no such thing, a doctor cannot do that.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t. By that time, there was no contact, nothing. Everybody\u2019s out for, for itself.\nThere was, there was just, everything collapsed. The streets were ruled by twelve year old\nchildren with submachine guns and disenfrised [sic], uneducated laborers who never\namounted to anything, and this was their way to get their revenge. They were shooting first,\ntruly and asking questions after. It was, it was the, a total reign of terror.",
        "A: Before the siege, it was already leading up to this because they, as soon as the Arrow Cross\nmovement took over on October 15, the, they started. It was just as bad. And the minute the\nadmiral who was the head of Hungary, Admiral Horthy finished his speech in which he\nannounced that as far as he was concerned the war was lost, at that moment, you know, hell\nbroke loose. He was arrested, his bodyguards were arrested.",
        "A: No, well, we, that was the date when the house, the story I told you began to get, take shape,\nokay? This was when we kind of put our heads together and we learned that this psychiatrist\nis taking steps to bring this man in and all this. We had to act very quickly because events\nwere really coming to an end. The Russians were approaching Budapest rapidly and we\nknew that again, that gives the, these guys very little time to kill all of us. And they were\ngetting more and more vicious, amazingly. Instead of saving their skin, they became even\nmore violent.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Right, right. I had, you know, the uniform and the ID and all this. I was sent to get our\nrations, you know, I was sent to pick up some papers or pick up medicine. Yeah, I was just a",
        "A: Well, the, the Red, if I remember correctly, we had some, some very vague contact with the\nRed Cross, I probably picked up medicine from them or something for the, for the\norganization. But personally, I had no as a, as an individual, I had no contact other than with\nthe, just with the Swiss Embassy. I told you I had a Switz, Swiss schutzpass, that by the time\nthe Arrow Cross movement started, meant very little.",
        "A: Well, you could go to the Swedish Embassy or the Swiss Embassy and they would, put you\non the list and eventually would give it to you. And it was really just a, kind of a, a\nsmokescreen. There was not much, if you were lucky, they respected it and they let you go.\nIf you were unlucky, they just tore it apart and said, \u201cStep into the wagon,\u201d you know, and\nyou were gone. You could never, never know. It, those embassies issued this in good faith\nbut the people who looked at it, you were at the mercy of those. And I just happened to go\nto the Swiss one, but the Swedish did it and then probably you heard the story, the Japanese,\nit was a Japanese in, in, not in Hungary, I think it was in Lithuania or somewhere, did the\nsame thing.",
        "A: So, in Hungary, it was mainly the Swedish and the, and the Swiss and I think the Vatican\ntoo. There was some, even though that the Primate of Hungary was almost like a\ncollaborator. He did not really act very courageously under the Nazi era.",
        "A: Yes. It was in December, if I know, December 20\" or something, very close to Christmas.\nThat\u2019s when it... really, it just, all of a sudden we were shot at from every direction. We\nknew that Budapest was totally surrounded. The airplanes were just coming day and night.\nThey were called ratas, R, A, T, A, these small Soviet airplanes machine-gunning anything\non the street that moved. It was very dangerous to get out on the street. And of course, then,\nwhen it came to night, anybody was moving could have been also shot by the fascists, by the\nArrow Cross people, \u2018cause they were also moving. And it, it was a lot of noise, a lot of\ninjuries, a smell of, of the stench of, of gunpowder and, and corpses came closer, you know?\nWar has a certain smell, a very very unpleasant smell that you can really honestly feel. And\nas a child, I learned that. That\u2019s, that\u2019s all I can tell you, but...",
        "A: Yes, the entire Budapest lived in basements. Some of the newer houses\u2019 basements were\nclean, perhaps dry, you know. And you could make it with a little effort to become\ntemporary living quarters. But those built in the 19\" century, they were damp, dark, they\nwere just awful. Cold. And luckily, that this house, this Zichy Jeno Street was a fairly, fairly\nnew house. And the basement was livable. Now where I lived, where I lived before, in most\nof my life, back, that basement was such that I, oh, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to spend any\ntime right there because it was a damp, old typical, what you see almost in Dickensian, you\nknow, movies or read about Dickensian novels. Also, there were rats, loved this kind of a\nmoist dark environment. But here, I remember our basement as quite civilized in, in this\nhouse. So it was, the hardship was not really bad and so many people, the heat, I think, of\nthe bodies made up for the cold outside.",
        "A: Oh, I would say we were a few hundred people in that basement, yeah?",
        "A: Oh, it, it would be like a floor, an entire floor of the house, because it was, usually the\nbasements were what you can consider a low floor. So, it\u2019s, I cannot really describe it in, in\nsquare footage because at that time I didn\u2019t even, I didn\u2019t even know about that, but it, 1t was\na good size apartment house floor, okay, just picture it. And there were mattresses down,\nand everybody brought the mattresses down, and there were people very closely situated\nand, was in a way, it was kind of a warm place.",
        "A: There were a few, but mainly the separate rooms were, were given to the doctors for\noperation, operating rooms and, and supply rooms and things like that. Most of the people\nlived in, in these big open areas.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Up until the, practically the last minute. And then the liberation, January 18,\nis when we heard the emergency wall of our basement. We heard a knock and by law, there\nwas a, an emergency entrance to every one of these basements between two houses that\nconsisted only of one layer of bricks. So, and there had to be a pick next to it. So we heard\nthat a pick was working, breaking through. And then, must have been about four o\u2019clock,\nfive o\u2019clock in the morning and all of a sudden the furred hat half of a young Russian soldier,\nSoviet soldier, came through first and then the whole body. And this was first time, I think,\nthat he got a hug from people because, and he couldn\u2019t understand why, he was absolutely\nbewildered because, of course, the Soviet soldiers were not welcomed with great enthusiasm\nanywhere since most Hungarians were hoping for a German victory and we, we were just\nhugging and kissing him.",
        "A: We were, yeah, bringing in people from just the vicinity, okay, very close vicinity. And\npeople would come in on their own too, you know, with a, with a shrapnel or something in\ntheir leg or a small injury.",
        "A: Well, we had beans. We, we, I remember that we practically had beans every day. Beans,\nbeans and beans. As long as you have beans, you can really survive. And water, yeah, water\nwas dripping but still, we could get at enough water to, for drinking. Nobody took a shower,\nthat\u2019s for sure. There was no way.",
        "A: Yep. People had these little, you know, stoves. A lot of people had little stoves and they\nshared those, whole families. There was, amazingly, it was a very peaceful environment\nbecause we all, we only had one important thing in our mind, to get out of there, alive. And\npeople shared.",
        "A: Yes, nobody, there was no such thing as leaving somebody starving or leaving somebody\nwithout fuel, or, I remember that everybody was doing their best. And of course, there are\nsmall little skirmishes mainly a couple of old people who just didn\u2019t understand the situation\ncompletely, and had unreasonable demands or something and we had to step on their toes,\nand... But no basic, no, no big problems.",
        "A: It\u2019s hard for me to look back but I would say we had at least thirty doctors there, at least.\nAnd we are talking about the cream of, of the Hungarian Jewish doctors, you know? Really,\nthey went out and famous professors from universities so this man, this Doctor V\u00e9lgyessi\u201d\nwho was the psychiatrist living in the house originally, he had a very large circle of friends,\nand so he managed to gather the ones that he could and brought them in. And there were\nmany other people, I don\u2019t know how they got there. I just read a few years ago that the\nchief architect of Budapest, the main architect of Budapest today, was with me in the\nbasement in this house. I... somebody sent me, I think, a newspaper article or while in\nvisiting in Budapest I saw it, he gave an interview about it. Because it was the fiftieth\nanniversary of the liberation of Budapest this year.",
        "A: Jereczian?",
        "A: Oh he stayed, he stayed all the time, he stayed, he never left the place. Yeah. So, no, he was\nthere all the time. And if he had to leave for some reason, he made sure that he left enough\npeople there to, to protect us.",
        "A: Yes, apparently, apparently and why he even joined them and what was his job there, I don\u2019t\nknow. I don\u2019t know. Since I left in 1948, you know, and I think that probably it took a few\nyears to write about these things and clear up this thing and I was not there in these, from \u00b048\nto \u201950. And after I came back, you just didn\u2019t want to, those were the worst years of\nStalinism and you didn\u2019t want to get involved with anything because you didn\u2019t know what\nhe was doing at that time and so, no questions asked was the best policy. But, later on in the\nsixties and seventies, I heard that he was a concert impressario and that he took certain\nshows back to Budapest. And I even saw his name and I am, I really regret that I didn\u2019t go\n* First name: Ferencz\nto see him. I should have looked for him somehow and talked to him. So I feel so strongly\nabout this whole thing that if I knew today that he 1s still alive, living, I would probably go to\nVienna. That\u2019s where he lived and, and, and just thank him again. But I know that he\nreceived a great deal of recognition from people. But I know, I don\u2019t know exactly what, if\nhe\u2019s alive today. He was, I would say, about ten, at least ten, fifteen years older than I, so it\u2019s\nhard to say.",
        "A: What did I do after that? Well, I did what probably is a natural thing to do. I went with the\nRussian soldiers and whenever they broke into a store and they broke into every store that\nstill had anything, I went with them. And after they were through and took what they\nwanted to take, I took what I wanted to take. In other words, I did what we called zabralny\nwhich means to confiscate things. I was full of hate, I was full of frustration and I thought\nthis, this was the way to get even, probably. And, I had a little store at home, a kind of a\nlittle supply of all these stolen goods that I got from shops that were just there, most people\nwouldn\u2019t dare to go in with the Russians, but I put back my yellow star and I went with them\nand unless I bumped into some Ukrainians, who were famous anti-Semites and beat the hell\nout of you, the, the others, they, they were welcoming you. They said go ahead. Also, we\nhad a, a little Jewish domestic from Romania with us, who joined us and helped my, my\nmother and she also spent the last few months with us in this, in this basement. And she was\nfrom Romania and with the Russians we had Romanian troops coming in. And she was a\nbeautiful young girl, nineteen, and the Romanian officers were just, just absolutely crazy\nabout her. So she took me by the hand and she said, \u201cCome with me.\u201d And she went with\nthese Romanians to all the jewelry stores and she amassed a fortune within days in jewelry.\nAnd then said goodbye to us and disappeared. We never found out what happened to her.\nShe had a fiancee in Romania, whether she found him or not, we suspected she eventually\nended up in Israel like most young people of that time. But I went with her and Romanian\nofficers, I went with Russians. I was kind of a street urchin for awhile. I enjoyed the fact\nthat nobody, nobody can really give me any orders. And my mother could not control me\neither, you know? I was now a man and I was just intoxicated by this, and so I had a little\nstore there, that, with all the stolen goods, and my father saw this when he came home and\nfound out, asked me what happened and I told him. And he was absolutely just horrified\nthat I would do something like this and made me take everything back to the stores where I\ngot it from. It was interesting, he got a little cart for me, we put everything on it and he came\nwith me and he stayed outside and I had to deliver it back. And I tell you, some of those\npeople could not believe that this happened. And today, of course, I feel very good about\nthis but not, not at that time. So, in, it took me only a year or two to realize that I, my real\nemotions that I\u2019m not a Hungarian, I never had a Hungarian passport, you know? I never\nhad any, any identity, Hungarian identity. They, I was always being denied of being a\nHungarian even though my parents were born in Hungary and practically everybody back\ngenerations born in Hungary and so I joined the Zionist Movement. And in 1948, the, the,\nthe Communists completely took over the government. They called it the Year of Turn.\nAnd all other organizations except for Communist youth organizations were banned. So\nagain now I was in the underground Zionist organization.\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\nTape 3, Side B",
        "A: Well, I told you, before, that, it, we knew because of an emissary that he had sent ahead of\nhim who then by small dosage made us aware of the fact that he was alive, that he was\ncoming, but of course, it was a tremendous emotional experience for him to appear there\nand, the fact that he immediately understood why there are two families living in the\napartment and, and, and accepted our decision, it was just a very nice homecoming. Because\nnumber one, we saw him, number two he brought food, which helped us to have a little feast\nthen, and number three is that he, we knew that that\u2019s what he would have done, he would\nhave split the living quarters and would not throw a family of four, family of five who were\nout of their own, well, problems, housed in our place. We... naturally, we were totally just\noverwhelmed by emotions for awhile and then, set out to see the rest of the family. He\nwanted to see his brothers and sisters and, and, that\u2019s, this is what happened.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. Zichy utca. Yeah, I left it practically the day after we were liberated and went back to\nsee what happened to our apartment. And that\u2019s where I found that family living in it.\n\u2018Kay? And, then shortly we moved back with my mother and so after a few months, I think it\nmust have been April or May when my father finally appeared.",
        "A: It was, very scarce. But again, this aunt of ours, of mine, who played such an important role\nin saving all of us, again, she and I, we teamed up and went, which was very customary then\nfor city people to do, took jewelry and possessions of the family that we thought farmers\nmight like to have and we could put on our body, and walked about, I would say, thirty, forty\nkilometer, about twenty miles from Budapest, and exchange it for food. We also hired a\nperson with a horse to drag it back to Budapest. It was mainly flour, lard, necessities, but of\ncourse, a horse was immediately a red flag in, in the eyes of the Russians because they\nconfiscated every horse, everything that could be used for transporting their goods. And we\nwere caught midway between this place and Budapest, coming back, in a small Danubian\nvillage. On the other side of the Danube, there was a battle going on. And we knew that it\ndoesn\u2019t affect anything, because the Danube is a very wide river and the Germans didn\u2019t\nhave any means to get over and why would they come over, but there was a battle over there\nbecause Trans-Danubia was not liberated yet. And so the Russians were very edgy and they\nconfiscated the cart, they confiscated the food, they confiscated the horse and then, they also\nincarcerated my aunt and myself. And I have no idea what happened, but the next... my\naunt was with me in the room and the, the Russian captain came in and took her out and she\ncame back a few hours later and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything is going to be fine.\u201d\nAnd the next morning, we were given back the cart, the horse, the man who was the owner\nof the horse and cart and the food and everything else and let go. And I can only guess what\nwas the price. The only thing I regret is that we heard that after delivering the stuff to our\nhome and sharing it with the family, when the, the farmer whose, who had the horse and the\ncart went back, eventually, was caught and lost both. So yes, if you had still some\nbelongings that farmers would appreciate, you could have food. Because the farmers always\nhave food.",
        "A: Ah, probably, a few weeks and then, the, the UNRRA, the American Jewish organizations\nwere also sending packages and, and would supply us regularly. So that helped too. We\nwere not really, you know, in danger of, of starving to death.",
        "A: Yes, I went back to school, to high school, and eventually finished practically, my high\nschool at the age of eighteen. And just a few weeks before, practically, of finishing, my\nZionist Organization give me signals that it was time to go to Israel because they couldn\u2019t\nguarantee that we would have more time. The Communist Police was and the border guards\nwere really closing everything very tightly. So, I, my instructions were to say goodbye to\nmy family and get either an instrument or an instrument case, that was instruction number\none. Then I was called by my Zionist leaders and, and asked if it is true that my mother\ncomes from this northern Hungarian town, I said yes. They said, \u201cDo us a favor. Go to that\ntown, introduce yourself as, so they can recognize that you are, your mother is related,\u201d and\nall this and that, \u201cand ask them if they would like to have a high school orchestra to play a\nconcert in town. And if they say yes,\u201d \u2014which probably they would, they said, because\nwhich little town doesn\u2019t like a free concert\u2014 \u201cgo to a printer, here is money and have nice\nposters printed.\u201d And they give me the date. I went, I talked to the mayor, he was\noverwhelmed, I went to the printer, I had all the prints made and I didn\u2019t realize at that time\nthat this was the alibi just in case we would be caught because this town is on the way to the\nborder, my mother\u2019s birthplace. On a given day, we boarded the bus, the bus was a state-\nowned bus by that time from a state-owned company. We were all either holding an\ninstrument or having an instrument case so people thought this was a high school orchestra\nand while singing Communist songs, we took off for the border. On the border, when we got\nclose to this town, we kept on going and the bus driver said that he was hungry, we were\nhungry too so we stopped in a, in a certain pub or so and this was in 1948, February. We\nwere eating there and getting something to drink and a woman began to flirt with the bus\ndriver. And we were horrified because that would, everything would cause a problem, we,\nwe knew that we had a definite plan. And soon the bus driver said that he would like to take\nabout a half an hour rest and my, our leader argued with him but he said, \u201cAll right, go.\u201d\nAnd as soon as he disappeared, he gathered us and he said, \u201cGo across this field and there is\na barn there and don\u2019t ask any questions, just get into the barn.\u201d That\u2019s what we did. They\nclosed the barn and around midnight, or so, or later, we were marched down to the Ipoly\nRiver which is the river between Czechoslovakia and Hungary and to our great amazement,\nwho was leading us?\u2014the peasant woman who was in the pub. She shed her twelve skirts or\nso because those women still wore many, many skirts, this was the, the thing. Now she had\na leather jacket and blue jeans and she spoke Hebrew with our leader. She was a, an Israeli\narmy officer, born to Hungarian parents who spoke perfect Hungarian and this was her job,\nto distract. And she led us down to the river, everything was supposed to happen so that on\nthe other side of the river, this was Czechoslovakia and the reason we had to go to\nCzechoslovakia and not to Austria because the border between Austria and Hungary was\nalready closed and tightly controlled but the Czechs were still kind of in between this Year\nof Turn and the Democratic regime that was there before. The, the end, at the end we\ncrossed the river but instead of getting into the trucks, the border guards stayed and started to\ntalk right there which was odd and very painful because there was snow on the ground. It\nwas very cold in February, we were wet and we had to lie on the ground for about a half an\nhour when they finally left. Then we couldn\u2019t find a truck, the truck left, too, who was\nsupposed to wait for us. So it took us about a half a day to find it and, finally, we were taken\nto Bratislava, where the gendarmerie was paid off. We were nominally arrested by the\ngendarmerie and he put into a warm place in the synagogue, there was straw on the floor, I\nremember, and the next morning, we were taken to the railroad station, put in boxcarts [sic]\nand within about a half an hour they opened. We were in Vienna, in the American section\nof, of, of Vienna. At that time, Vienna was divided. So this was my, my great escape to\nIsrael. And from there on, of course, we were taken down and eventually ended up in Israel.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes. I mean, they, they, they, I felt that I was among brothers and sisters and I felt\u2014at that\ntime remember it was the last few weeks of the war\u2014that I was, if I fought, I was going to\nfight for, for the Jewish homeland. And I already associated myself more with that than with\nHungary. That was, every young person needs a fatherland and that was mine, even though\nI'd never seen it before. So, it was an emotional thing and I stayed in Israel for two day, two\nyears.",
        "A: Of course, they were very, very upset and very sad. But I said, \u201cYou can come and, and join\nme,\u201d you know. And we agreed that they would but of course, they couldn\u2019t, because after\nwe left, 1t was impossible to, to leave Hungary for awhile. So, I corresponded and this was,\nthis was one of the reasons why I returned eventually, in 1950 to Hungary, \u201ccause I realized\nthat I needed to make up for the years that my father was away. So I returned to Hungary\nand it was the worst of the Stalinist era. It was like 1984, it was terrible.",
        "A: No, my father never really made an issue out of this. He never made an issue out of this, you\nknow? One way or another. Just, he, he, he loved his environment, Budapest. He loved to\ngo to the coffee house and play cards with his friends and drink coffee and, and, probably\ngossip or whatever, politics. He loved that. And he told us a cute little joke. They always\nasked him why doesn\u2019t he follow me, when he was already alone, after my mother died and\nhe, he said, \u201cI tell you a joke.\u201d He said, \u201cMr. Kohn sits in this famous Hungarian coffee\nhouse\u201d\u2014it was called Hungaria, it\u2019s a very famous, or New York, it had two names. New\nYork before and after the German occupation, called Hungaria because you couldn\u2019t give a\nplace New York. Anyway, Mr. Kohn sits there and people say, \u201cMr. Kohn, it is now the\n1940s, we are after the war, all your friends are gone. They\u2019re all in New York, what are\nyou doing here alone in the coffee house?\u201d And Mr. Kohn said, \u201cLook son, what would I\nhave done had I also left for New York? I would have arrived there one day and the next day\nI would have looked for my old friends and I would have found them and the third day we\nwould have sat down to talk, about what? The good old days in the coffee house.\u201d He said,\n\u201cLook son, I am already in the coffee house.\u201d And my father always said, \u201cThis is my coffee\nhouse.\u201d In other words, this was his life, this was his environment. You know, he was\nalways on his feet, he was always going around in Budapest and he was also working almost\nup to the last year just before he died. He was, he just couldn\u2019t be without work. He was a\nworkaholic and he knew that in this country, you need language. And he had very poor\nlanguage facilities, he would have never learned English. So, it was a realization but we, we\nsaw him as much as we could.",
        "A: Basically, I spent most of my time in kibbutz, living in a kibbutz. I learned to work with the\ntractors at that time, and then we, with a hundred other Hungarian, young Hungarian youth,\nmost of them from my old organization from Hungary, we received land near the Jordanian\nborder by a town called Afula and started our own settlement. So, I was really working the,\nas a farmer, kibbutz.",
        "A: Very little, almost none. I got there very late, remember, so I do not claim any, any real\nmajor role at all. No.",
        "A: In 1950, then, it was part of a homesickness for my parents and part of stupidity on my part,\nthat I believed that things are the way Communist papers describe it in Hungary. I decided\nto return, perhaps temporarily, perhaps not. And when I arrived in Hungary, I realized that it\nwas a fatal mistake.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no. I found my parents, but other than that, it was, it was a terrible period for any human\nbeing, especially people who came from the West. It was the worst for those, because you\nwere considered unreliable and especially coming from Israel, even more so. The reason\nwas, that by that time, Stalin was very paranoid and Zionism was one of his main targets.\nSo, it, it, this is, this is something that is not much to do with the Holocaust anymore. It was\njust very hard for anybody to live under Communist rule at that time, but especially for Jews.\nWell, I don\u2019t know if you know that in 1953 when he was dying, he looked up and he saw\nsome Jewish doctors around his deathbed and he said, \u201cThey are poisoning me, they\u2019re\nagainst me.\u201d And he said, \u201cArrest them.\u201d And practically hours before he died, they\narrested Jewish doctors and I was just at the University in Hungary, studying and that was\nmy state, the time of my state examination. And Hungary had to follow everything that the\nSoviet Union did so they were looking for anybody who had anything to do with Zionism.\nAnd they found me at the university and I was let go, weeks before my state exam. So, it, it\nwas difficult but of course that has nothing to do with the Holocaust anymore.",
        "A: Yes and no. Yes and no. I had some very deep feelings about the country as such and then\nagain, I was still a young man, eighteen, and I was also influenced by a great deal of these\nrevolutionary Marxist ideas. And there were many things that were not to my liking, that I\nwould have loved to see differently. And so when I left Israel, I did not just leave it with\nnostalgia. I left it because I thought that finally, somehow, in Hungary, I\u2019m going to find,\nfind that utopistic state, that, that 1s, 1s justice and equality for everyone. And, I was just a\nlittle bit too stupid, to, to think that way, but I did. So it a was a, a double reason to return.\nA, a totally unfounded idealism and homesickness.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t work for awhile because I was unreliable, anybody who came from the West,\nespecially from Israel. Finally, with some great connections, I was hired to sweep and clean\na garage, a state-owned garage. And that would have been my future for a long time, had it\nnot been for a, just a, a very fortunate incident when the Party secretary of my, my company\nwas sick and a substitute Party secretary was there. And I appeared at her office because\nthere were big posters, they wanted workers youth to go to college because they figure that\nsome of the middle class and the former upper class that sends its sons to college and I asked\nif she can recommend me and she said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know you but why don\u2019t you dictate a\nrecommendation to my secretary?\u201d And so that was the big first hurdle that I went through\nbecause the regular Party secretary would have never written that letter. So, with this, I went\nto a university forum, but the trouble is you had to write your autobiography, and the minute\nthey got to a point of Israel, which you could not in those days just stay silent about two\nyears of your life, when they found out they said \u2018Thanks but no thanks,\u2019 and again a strange\nthing happened. One of the faculty members who was on the committee, cause the\ncommittee that interviewed people consisted of faculty member, Communist Youth\nOrganization, the Communist Party, the union, various organizations. He came after me and\nhe said, \u201cHolczer, Holczer,\u201d he said, \u201cwas your father from the suburb of Budapest?\u201d I said\nyes. He said, \u201cWas there a soccer team in which he and four or five of his brothers played at\nthe same time?\u201d I said yes. He said, \u201cI played with your dad.\u201d He said, \u201cCome back in\nSeptember,\u201d he says \u201cYou were a minor when you left Hungary. Let\u2019s see if the minister of\neducation can exempt you,\u201d you know? Amnesty you, pardon you, whatever. Well,\nanyway, I went back in September and nobody knew who I was, nobody, they had no idea,\ngo away. So I looked for him and he went in to the Party secretary and he came out and he\nsaid, and he said, \u201cI am happy to inform you that the minister of education give you a\ndispensation. You can enter the university.\u201d And he said, \u201cThis is the last time you and I\never talk to each other.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t even greet me.\u201d He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d\nAnd that was it. This is how I got in. Yeah. So it was two coincidences, very lucky ones.\nEnd of Tape 3, Side B\nTape 4, Side A",
        "A: 1950.",
        "A: I studied, my major was geography and my minor was history.",
        "A: I wanted to be a geographer. I wanted to work for the Geographic Institute of Hungary or\nteach geography. I love geography. And, in Hungary, it was a very important subject at that\ntime. But in America, it was no subject at all. I, when I arrived here, people were just\nlooking at me and they said, \u201cNo, this is, unfortunately, we are not teaching geography\nhere.\u201d\u2019 It was incorporated into what they called social studies in the high school.",
        "A: So, I switched and I made, I went back to school here in 1959, and switched and had a\nhistory major, \u2018kay. And I left geography just out there, I didn\u2019t touch it anymore, so I got a\nmaster\u2019s degree in history and my secondary credentials, teaching credentials.",
        "A: Then I taught in a junior high school in the suburbs of Budapest, working-class suburb in\nBudapest until 1956, when the Revolution broke out and I left.",
        "A: Just a very minor one. In the 19\" district of Budapest, I was asked to form the New\nDemocratic Teachers\u2019 Union. And I had very ambivalent feelings about the revolution\nbecause I was afraid that the same elements, the same kind of elements who came up in\n1944, October 15, eventually will dominate it. I just did not trust the revolution so I stayed\naway from it. I understood the anger of the people and I sympathized with the, with the\ndesire to have a free country, but I didn\u2019t trust some of the groups that participated in it. And\nwhat, what really precipitated my departure is that a few days before I left, I saw some\ngroups with Arrow Cross armbands, and that did it. I realized that I would never be able to\nlive here anymore. There will be absolutely no, no peace for somebody who is either a\nhuman being or, or has a Jewish background or favors a peaceful living, lifestyle.",
        "A: All the time. Hungarians are with the Austrians and Poles, probably the three most anti-\nSemitic countries in Europe. I felt much less anti-Semitism frankly in Germany in my\nnineteen years that I recently spent there than in Hungary or in Austria.",
        "A: Yes, I decided to leave Hungary and in 1956, November, I started to walk toward the border\nwith a cousin of mine who just graduated from high school and was always in political\ntrouble with the police for his outspoken attitude, so, he followed, he came with me, and we\nthen crossed the border after, I think about six, seven days or so. And arrived in Austria.",
        "A: No, it was totally illegal. We were walking usually from dawn to dusk and whatever the\nconditions were, you know, favorable, we didn\u2019t really like to walk in broad daylight but of\ncourse we couldn\u2019t walk in the darkness either because we didn\u2019t know the terrain. We slept\nin, in haylofts, the farmers were quite kind. They felt probably a little bit guilty for not\nparticipating in the revolution and slowly approached the border this way. And then before\nthe border, it was then a little bit difficult, and we had to have, we had connections because a\nthird person joined us whose relatives lived in a border town and they helped us to get over.",
        "A: Yes. My parents were still there and I told them definitely that this time I want them to\nfollow me, eventually, when they can come legally. Because I didn\u2019t want them to, they\nwere by that time, the age when you don\u2019t just chase somebody across snowfields. So, we\narrived in Graz, that was the first Austrian town, and you had all the opportunity to go then\nanywhere in the world. Every country opened its arms. [dog barking] Lie down, Gelsey.",
        "A: And the world was then open to us and I intended to go to Sweden. I wanted to stay in\nEurope, and I just thought that Sweden would be a good place for me to, to be. But my\ncousin got away from me while we were staying in Salzburg, in, in a hotel which was one of\nthe gathering points for the Hungarian refugees, and left a note for me to come and follow\nhim. And I promised his mother that I would take care of him so I followed him and this 1s\nhow I ended up in the U.S.",
        "A: Yes. Well, of course, it was very easy. All I had to do is go and tell the authorities there,\nthe, the ones who were in charge of the Hungarian refugees that instead of Sweden, I\nchanged my mind and I want to go to the U.S. Not only that, they already, they already had\nsome messages from the Red Cross saying that if I show up, and the reason I was away,\nbecause previously he had asked me to go to Vienna and arrange for him to stay with his\nrelatives in Vienna who were not my relatives, but he wanted to go to school there. He was\ntotally intoxicated by the, by the light, western lifestyle because he had never been to the\nWest. And by the time I came back to Salzburg, he was gone. So, but he left messages. So\nthe Red Cross sent me to St. Louis, Missouri to be reunited with him.",
        "A: No, he, he was just, he was a very unpredictable fellow, you know? You could not really, he\nwas, he was a just a restless person and I think he figured, well, why not, I want to see the\nU.S. and, and his message to me was, \u201cYou can always go to Sweden from the U.S. You\nwill have the money and opportunity, but maybe you won\u2019t have the opportunity to go and\nsee the U.S. if you live in Sweden.\u201d Little, little did he know about economic conditions in\nthe eighties and nineties that, I think, more Swedes can travel much easier and come here\nthan we in Sweden.",
        "A: You know, I am a romantic. And I just felt that I would not want to leave Europe. Europe,\nto me, was always my home. I loved the old towns, and I always loved clarity and that, the\nScandinavian purity, maybe, that I have seen too many, I had seen too many Scandinavian\nmovies, Swedish movies. But they just appealed to me, the lifestyle. And I liked the fact\nthat the social security, that people have in Scandinavian countries, especially in Sweden.\nAnd just a lot of things appealed to me about Sweden, and I knew that I would be treated\nfairly, so, that was it.",
        "A: No, I had no money. We didn\u2019t need any money. [talkover] No. Nobody had any money.\nAll you did was as a refugee, you appeared at, when, when we finally were picked up and\ntaken to Graz by the Austrian police, they were very well organized there, there, you found\nevery religious denomination having a booth, who welcomed you. You could go and say\nthat I am a Baptist, I am a Catholic, made no difference and then name the country where\nyou wanted to go to. And, and it was very simple, you didn\u2019t need any money. Then, next\nstep was each had a place in Austria where they temporarily would house you, even give you\na little pocket money and there you waited for your transportation to go to that country. And\nthat so, I did not really want to be attached to any religious organization so I went to a very\nindependent one called the Tolstoy Foundation. It was founded by Tolstoy\u2019s daughter and,\nusing I think the, the royalties of Tolstoy\u2019s books, and so they are the ones who brought me\nto the U.S. It was all gratis. I came over, the American military and the Air Force is the one\nwho flew all Hungarian refugees over. MATS, Military Air Transportation, the, the\nstewardesses and almost everybody involved with us were of, of Hungarian origin, most of\nthem from Cleveland. Cleveland is the second largest Hungarian city in the world after\nBudapest. And, and so here, they then, then I was handed over to a Jewish organization\nbecause my cousin came through a Jewish organization. So in St. Louis they were waiting\nfor me. If you were a Hungarian refugee those days, you had no problem because the world,\nthe whole world felt very guilty about not helping the Revolution and so they did everything\npossible. I mean I was so embarrassed. I never, I was never in my life treated this way, I\nthought, you know, I was some dignitary or something. They were waiting for me at the\nairport and I was just... But first I had to spend, like most Hungarians, some time at Camp\nKilmer in New Jersey which was a screening camp for people. They screened out the sick,\nthe U.S. did not take, I think, people with TB and some other illnesses, they went to\nScandinavia, the Swedes did, and also Communist Party members and such. I don\u2019t know\nwhat the criteria was, but they looked into your background a little bit. And so this is how I\nended up in St. Louis. My cousin stayed with me for about no more than two months, not\neven that much. He found some relatives in Chicago who would help him to go to\nChampagne, the University of Illinois, and he just left. And we were housed, we were taken\nby an American family who had very good intentions but the man was a manic depressive so\nyou could never figure out for one second to another how he would react to you. And,\napparently, his wife felt that maybe taking Hungarian refugees in would, would somehow\nremedy the problem but it didn\u2019t. And they had a mentally retarded child, so it was not a\nvery ideal situation for a newcomer although she was very nice to me and I stayed there for a\nfew months and then eventually, I met a professor of Hungarian ancestry and origin at the\nUniversity of, Washington University in St. Louis who had in Aspen, Colorado, a house, and\nhe and his family spent every summer there because he was a member of the music festival.\nAnd when they heard... I hated St. Louis, I just couldn\u2019t find anything redeeming about\nthat, that city, and when they heard that I was very unhappy and all this, they took me to\nAspen, Colorado and they said, \u201cYou can always work here for a dollar an hour, too.\u201d And I\nloved it. I stayed there for almost three years. And most of my friends and connections and\neverything in my American life practically comes from that period. From my Aspen period,\npeople who helped me to get ahead in, in more ways than one. So, I am, I was very lucky\nagain to end up there. Of course, those days Aspen was not what it is today, you know.",
        "A: I was, no, from Aspen was a place where I collected my money and, and, you know, saved\nenough. I wanted to go up to Alaska for one summer. I went up to Alaska and worked for\nthe Forest Service and then came to Fresno, California, which offered me a loan. I couldn\u2019t\nget a scholarship because they didn\u2019t know much about me. My papers did not arrive from\nHungary. So it was, but at least they offered me a National Defense Loan so that helped me\nto start school. And I stayed in Fresno for two years when I got my teaching credentials and\nmy master\u2019s degree in history. And I, those were, scholastically speaking, they were good\nyears. I had very good instructors and, and good friends and sponsors and, I did not regret it.\nAnd then I ended up in the Bay Area where I wanted to be. And met my wife there. And I\nwas teaching in Marin County.",
        "A: Yes. All the time. And I, almost every summer I went home to visit, okay?",
        "A: Yes. They, once I got married in \u201967, they came to visit and they enjoyed it very much and\nthen in 1974, when, see I married my wife with three children. They were tiny, their, their\nfather abandoned them, he was alcoholic. And so, my wife and I raised them. And by the\ntime, 1974, I get an offer from a friend of mine in Switzerland to come and help him, he was\na director of a school in a children\u2019s village in Switzerland, Pestalozzy, very famous\nchildren\u2019s village, Pestalozzy Children\u2019s Village. Do you speak German?",
        "A: No. Okay. And so, and I loved the mountains, I loved the Alps and I wanted to get back to\nEurope. And since we had only one child at home by that time, and he was willing to come\nSO we went over. We, we resigned our jobs and we went back and the job fell through.\nBecause in the meantime, the Swiss had the law, not a law, a plebiscite about not hiring\nforeigners unless they can find a local person for the job. And after years of advertisement\nfor this particular position, they couldn\u2019t find anybody, a couple came just as we were being\ninterviewed. So it fell through and in 1964, no I mean 1965, before I got married, I came\nover to Europe to teach for the Army, just for a year. I just needed, I was a very confirmed\nbachelor, and I needed a year to think about whether I want to marry somebody with three\nsmall children and here a confirmed bachelor. So I stayed for a year when I decided yes, but\nduring the year, I got to know a lot of people in the system, in the Department of Defense\nSchool System. So now that the job fell through and we basically gave up our jobs here in\nthe States, I had only one, you know, opportunity here, to go over and see if any of our, our,\nany of my former colleagues can be found and if I can get any help to get a job for my wife\nand myself. And not only that I found some but they were now in very, very high positions\nand they said, no problem. And both of us, within a year, started to teach. My wife got a job\neven before me, because it was more difficult for high school teachers than elementary. So\nshe started out and we lived in the Frankfurt area and we stayed for nineteen years.",
        "A: We, when I left school with my credentials, I wanted to, I had a girlfriend in the Bay Area,\nalso from Aspen. She was a schoolteacher and she wanted me to get a job there so we can\nbe close and we were there. Now all of a sudden, she said, oh, at that time it was very, by\nthat time it was very difficult to get a job for a teacher, in the early sixties, and the only job\navailable, finally, was teaching special ed classes. And I said, children are children, I don\u2019t\ncare. I had to sign a paper that I would go to school and get a credential. And the man who\nhired me was also a Holocaust survivor so it, it really helped. I told him very honestly why I\nwant the job and I said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter why I want the job, I will, I will do a good job, you\ncan, you can bet on that.\u201d And I hope I did. So, he hired me and this is where I met my\nwife. She was also teaching special ed classes, and but she stayed only for a few years and\nthen when I came back in 1965, then I went into special ed for the county, for Marin County,\nand I stayed for almost ten years, nine years. So that\u2019s how we met. And then I switched.\nWith the Army, I switched back to teaching political science and, and history.",
        "A: Well, it was much more pleasant than I had envisioned, frankly. I found that there is a very\nlarge segment of a new German generation that is, is absolutely appalled, okay, of the past.\nAnd I met a lot of intellectuals who had a very good vision of the past, and not only that,\nthey spread the knowledge around. Naturally, there is an element in, in Germany, that 1s,\nyou know, that is the scum of earth, but frankly, they are very much the minority. And I, I\ncould live in Germany much easier, probably, than I could ever live in Austria, where it\ndoesn\u2019t take more than a few minutes to hear somebody making an anti-Semitic or fascist\nremark, especially if they have a couple of beer. You know. So, there is, there is a new\nGermany. Now, with East Germany joining, it is a problem. But West Germany itself, was,\nI would say, a pretty civilized state. Okay, now the East Germans, that\u2019s a different, that\u2019s a,\nthat\u2019s a tragedy right now, that they had not been instructed by the proper history teachers,\nand, there are big problems in East Germany because the East Germans said, \u201cThe Nazis, oh\nno, they live in West Germany. We, we are good Communists here, we don\u2019t have to worry\nabout the past.\u201d And this attitude then led to what 1s happening nowadays in Germany with\nthe skinheads.",
        "A: Well, again, you know, I followed my father. He came to see us in Germany once and while\nhe was there, our landlady\u2019s son was killed in a motorcycle accident, a young seventeen year\nold, a young man. And we had to go to the funeral. And my wife said to my father as she\nlook around, \u201cGrandpa, look, all these men of your age. Do you sometimes think of all the\nghosts that are around here behind these men?\u201d And my father said, \u201cYou can\u2019t live with\nhate.\u201d He says, \u201cThere are ghosts everywhere. There are Indian ghosts in America, too.\nYou have your own ghosts.\u201d And that\u2019s just the way that, you can\u2019t constantly think of that.\nAnd we befriended Germans who were a lot more even liberal than, than we are. And so, I\nmean, you can find all kinds of people. That, but there, Germany, I don\u2019t really worry too\nmuch about Germany as much as I worry about Russia and, and Poland and Austria and\nthere you can find a lot of fascist elements and Hungary too, probably.",
        "A: Oh, when, the, the military was in a, is, is a drawdown situation where they were pulling out\nquite a few troops from Germany and we reached, my wife reached the point where she just\nsaid she wanted to be close to the children. We have four grandchildren. She, this house\nwhich didn\u2019t look like this at that time was a small little place, this was one end of the house\nand that was the other end of the house. A partner of my brother-in-law lived here, a\nveterinarian, but it was a very small place. It was available. They bought it and he called us\nand my wife said, \u201cLook, I stayed in Europe for nineteen years with you, now I would like\nyou to stay where I would like to be and it is so nice to be so close to family.\u201d Our son 1s\nonly four hours away, in Nashville, with a little baby. And oh, and she gets along with her\nsister very well and we all get along, we never had an argument. So, that was an ideal\nsituation so that\u2019s how we got here.\nEnd of Tape 4, Side A\n[NOTE: SIDE TWO OF TAPE 4 IS BLANK]\nTape 5, Side A",
        "A: Her name was Aranka, that is Goldie in English, you know, Aranka, and Teply, T-E-P-L-Y.\nShe's still living in Hungary at this date and probably it would be very difficult to\ncommunicate with her because she is number one, old, and number two, I think that she has\nsome mental problems that she developed since the war and, but she certainly is the heroine\nof the whole story and my survival, so I try to keep up with her but it's very, very difficult\nand I'm very, very sorry about that. But she has a son who lives in Switzerland so at this\npoint she's still alive.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Non-Jews, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They would have gone apartment by apartment and, of course, if you could prove that you\nare a gentile, and that was very easy because every concierge had a list, years ago this was a\nlaw in Hungary, that every concierge had a list and that had nothing to do with Jews or non-\nJews way back, because when you change your residence in Europe, you have to go to the\npolice and report it. In other words, every European country, they know who is at that point\nwhere. And so this list existed, all they had to do, come and talk to the concierge and all the\nconcierges were basically serving the government, they were in my estimate, what I call the\ncommon man, and their attitude changed regarding of what the government was doing and\nthey were lackeys and so there was no big problem, they always could tell who were the\ngentiles and who were not by just showing the list. But there were gentiles still living in the\nJewish houses who had a nice place and they just didn't want to move, you know? And so\nwhen, for example, at one time we were lined up because the house was discovered and this\nGeorge Ara Jereczian was not there with his guards. I think they went to buy, get some\nrations for the house, and so we were really without any defense, and we were lined up, then\nthe gentiles who are not down there be also lined up because they, apparently they had\nknown what was going on and could identify themselves.",
        "A: We were, yes, we were lined up, we were lined up. And then in the last moment, a lot of\nthings happened. This aunt of mine, for example, she was also out, most people who could\ngo on the street were always out looking for something to eat and bring home and when she\nsaw her mother, for example, in the lineup, she just went up to her and started to kick her and\nsaid, \u201cThis stupid slut. Just, she is so stupid. Every time people say line up, she lines up,\nshe's not Jewish.\u201d And all this, and in front of those Arrow Cross people, she just dragged\nher mother out of the line up and she had a personality that nobody argued with her. So they\nassume that she is a gentile, therefore her mother is a gentile, too. And then we were saved\nbecause George Ara Jereczian came home and immediately, his men immediately went to\nthese punks and said, you know, \u201cClear out of here in short order, papers and everything\nelse. And if you want, you know, we'll call the Ministry of Defense.\u201d And so, they knew\ntheir job and threatened these people who then left.",
        "A: About ten, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, they were, they were, I start out with my mother, then my father's three sisters, okay?\nAmong them this Aranka, Goldie, and eventually my father's two brothers, too, joined us.\nThey were also under some kind of a disguise as policemen or this and that in whatever\nuniform they could get, but when things were really tough the last, I think, ten days or two\nweeks, they joined us, so they were there, too. Then there were some husbands, my, one of\nmy aunts had a husband and a boyfriend. It was a triangle that the family just tolerated\nbecause the boyfriend was a much nicer person than the husband, everybody, so there was\neven humor then. And some children. So we might, it's possible we were even more than\nten and that was very fortunate, a lot of apartments have a lot more than just ten people\nbecause this was, it sound like, it seemed like a safe haven and of course, all the relatives\nwere coming and you wouldn't want to throw out your relatives and so... a lot of very famous\ndoctors were there who then went on and came to this country and elsewhere and the whole\nfamily was there, so.",
        "A: Oh, my aunt's other, well, we were all together in the same apartment, it was her apartment\nand because ordinarily a gentile would not have had anything to do with Jews, but this was\nan extraordinary place because we, she knew that if they really stormed the house, the Arrow\nCross people, and if they really eliminate George Ara Jereczian and his guards, then\neverything is lost, 1t doesn't make any difference, so... and inside the house, of course, there\nwas absolutely no other rule except you made up your own so nobody cared. Yes?",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, thirteen, my father had thirteen brothers and sisters and some of them were\nalready dead and others were elsewhere. One was in what was Slovakia at that time and\nparticipated in the Slovak uprising against the Germans and was hanged, was captured and\nhanged. My father was in Yugoslavia, so there were, another was in a labor camp, we didn't\neven know where he was, so they were dispersed. The women were together, the women we\ncould get together and, but the men, only two of them. So there were altogether five, five of\nthe thirteen, right there.",
        "A: Volgyessi, Volgyessi. He was the most famous Hungarian psychiatrist of his, of that time.",
        "A: V-O, and there is a double, what the Germans call, what is it, well, anyway, two dots.",
        "A: Umlaut, yes, two dots on the O, then L-G-Y-E-S-S-I, Volgyessi. And he, he was a very\ninfluential man and I, if I remember correctly, I heard, at that time as a child, that he was the\nmain reason that this whole setup was the way it was. That he had the connection, he knew\nGeorge Ara Jereczian and he is the one who brought him in and suggested that let's do this.",
        "A: He was in his, I would say, late 50's in 1945, but he had a son and two daughters and a\nrelatively younger wife, so I assume that they are somewhere and I also assume that they are\nnot in Hungary, that they are probably in the U.S., so if ever there is a reunion, I will see\nthem. As a matter of fact, I would like to see them because I was deeply in love with one of\nthe, the little Volgyessi girls. I was a young kid then, it was just a puppy love.",
        "A: Well, in 1945, we all survived, okay? But, oh you mean since? Who's still alive?",
        "A: Oh, we went through the same experience and nobody... in that house, the only people who\nwere taken away were a man between eighteen and, I think it was eighteen and forty-five or\neighteen and fifty-five, before, before October 15th when the labor, when they truly were\njust going to a labor camp, labor organizations, that 1s when all the men, so there were no\nmen until October 15th, between eighteen and fifty-five in that house, they were all taken\naway. So, some of the families who lived there, for example, their father was not with them\nby that time. And, I don't know of anybody who survived. In other words, unfortunately,\nmost of these people were then in a forced march toward Germany at the end of the war and\nsomewhere in, probably western Hungary, they were just either killed or died of typhus.",
        "A: No, no, no. You know, I was fifteen when the war ended, and I regret this very much, but\noutside my family, my family is the only one, and there are only two members living in my\nfamily and they are the only ones. I tried to ask them if they can make some contact, I am\nnow really very much interested in keeping up with some other people, but they, they just,\nthey never really bothered and they are not very good letter writers so, and if I go to\nHungary, maybe I will look for it, I would like to and I'm going to ask, perhaps, if I can get\nto the, to any, perhaps to the synagogue in Hungary, if they have some knowledge of, is there\na group that still comes together, because there were kids of my age and I'd like to know\nwhat happened to them.",
        "A: Mmm-hmm.",
        "A: Yeah, interestingly, well, there was very little left in our apartment, what was left, a couple\nof boxes, and I don't know why they were left there, this family never touched. And that, to\nme, was immediately, I give them some good points for that. But when I opened it, our\napartment got a direct hit when the siege of Budapest took place and so a lot of the... and\nmost of these boxes contained tablecloth or sheets or something like that, and so they all had\nbig holes in them. And, however, a very beautiful embroidered tablecloth and the napkins\nwe had for a long time until they disintegrated. My wife mended them and we used them.\nAnd now, what happened to the furniture? A lot we give to neighbors to say, \u201cIf we come\nback, okay, hopefully, you will give it back to us and if we are not, then it is yours,\u201d so, and\nthey took it and now not one of them had a piece left that they can give back to us. They all\nsaid the same thing: the Russians took it. Now, this was the most illogical, stupid thing to\nsay, because the Russian soldiers had two hands, what are they going to do with a piano?\nWhat are they going to do with a table, what do they need it? The Russians only went for\none thing. Watches. They had watches up to their ears, it's as if they had never seen watches\nbefore, that was the only thing. They stop you on the street and that was the only question,\n\u201cDavay chasi!\u201d That means, \u201cGive me your watch.\u201d Nothing else, I mean what can a, a foot\nsoldier who is going on and on and on across Europe, what is he going to do with anything\nthat takes up space and has weight? And so it was ridiculous, but nothing, absolutely\nnothing was returned from the neighbors.",
        "A: Any of my friends? Well, as I mentioned before, my class, junior high class, was practically\ntotally taken and deported under those very unusual circumstances, so I had to look for the\nkids who were not my schoolmates, but, or either lower or higher classes, and also the ones\nthat I used to play with when I went to the city park which was not far away from us. And I\nwould say that about half of them I found, but the other half perished, you know, either\nbecause of the fires, you know there was bombs, or because they were killed during the\nArrow Cross era, after October 15th.",
        "A: Well, when I met my friends after the war, number one, we were so full of hatred, we were\nlooking for some kind of an outlet, some organization that we can join, and we found it. And\npart of it was they give away shirts, we found a Communist Party. Imagine, we were fifteen\nyear olds and we saw that people were walking around in red, flaming red shirts. And we\nfound out that the flaming red shirts come from parachutes and these parachutes were supply\nparachutes that were dropped by the Soviet forces and the Hungarians got the material and\nthe Communist Party made a kind of a campaign and made it into shirts and would give\nthem to anybody who signed up. And I think this drew us a lot more than anything else, the\nfour very close friends of mine, whom I knew from the illegal boy scout organization and,\nluckily, we all survived, we all went and signed up with the Communist Party and I think this\nis the first, or almost the last time, I ever went to the Party because, now we went to a couple\nof meetings and we were just bored to death, this happened to American communists, too.\nSigned up or something, I mean it was the most boring thing, so we never really considered\nourself truly Communist Party members because we were, I think, members for a month and\nthen we never paid any fees or we didn't do anything after that, but this was, our first step\nwas to go down to the Communist Party headquarters and sign up with the Communist\nParty, which was understandable because we felt that the Communist Party was going to be\nthe one that revenges all these atrocities and whatever happened, and then we saw that\nalmost everybody who was in the Arrow Cross movement is also in the Communist Party\nbecause people easily turned, that's obvious, you know, a lot of books and essays were\nwritten about how anybody who is an extremist in one way can become the extremist in\u2014on\nthe other side. So we found that and that was disgusting, absolutely. And the Communist\nParty knew about it and they defended it and we didn't like that, their terminology, and so we\nquit. So then we went back to, and kind of regrouped as old boy scouts. But our heart was\nnot in it because now, I mean for so many years we could not do anything as boy scouts\nexcept go out and hike in nature, we couldn't even wear a kerchief. And so now we could\nwear a uniform and some of us really bought a uniform, and then we just, we just lost\ncompletely our lust for boy scout life and that didn't work. Then, you know, this was,\nanother year went by and I, of the four, I broke away from the other four and I joined the\nZionists. They just, there were a lot of things that appealed to me, the fact that, finally, I am\ngoing to have a homeland, finally, I am going to have a passport, there was adventure.\nImmediately, they send me up in the mountains and I had to go through a certain instruction,\nmore than one, on more than one occasion. And they, I advanced, I was pretty eager and\ngood at learning things, and I became a youth leader in the movement and I loved to be with\nyoung people. And so that, to me, was a, was a very happy period of my life. My only\nconflict was with my parents. Since I was an only child, of course, they wanted me around\nas much as possible, and I reached that rebellious teenage period, I was not too rebellious,\nbut rebellious enough to move out of the house at sixteen and go to a Zionist children's home\nwhere first I was just a, a resident and I liked being with my peer group. There were many,\nthere were many in Hungary, a lot of the survivors, young people of my age, just chose this\nas a lifestyle. And what we were doing there, we received a lot of instructions in agriculture,\nin the language, Hebrew language, in Jewish history, to prepare us when we go to Israel.\nAnd my parents, of course, didn't like for me being away at sixteen and I felt really sorry for\nthem and once the rebellious period ended, in about a half a year or so, I moved back home\nand one of the reasons was that life was too free on these, it was the perfect kind of thesis,\nanti-thesis, that we were so restricted, now everything was free, I mean, and I was a little bit\nof a, I was a strange kid because I didn't grow up very quickly to become a man, and I did\nnot like the fact that here were girls of my age who wanted to sleep with me and all this and\nthat, I just, I always pictured myself more of a, an individual, a man who has things to do and\nI don't, I'm not going to spend a lot of time with, with sex and all this and my mind was not\nonly on just women, let's put it this way, even though I already had sexual experiences and\nthe whole, and because of this, they considered me a little bit of an eccentric so that happy, I\nmoved back home to satisfy my parents, but I didn't stay there long enough because I got an\noffer at the age of seventeen to go and be a resident advisor in a home for Jewish orphans.\nThat was on, it was called Tarogato Street in the Buda section of Budapest where I found a\nman who became a very good friend of mine, the man who led the institution, a marvelous\nman, also a Zionist, by the name of Spitzer\u201d and his family, and they were very good to me\nand I felt very much at home, plus I got a nice salary and all my needs were taken care of\n* First name: Imre\nthere. Even I had a girlfriend who was also a resident counselor there, so happy, really, they\nwere very happy days. And in the meantime, I also participated very actively in, I changed\norganizations and left, I was in a, I would say, kind of a petit bourgeois Zionist group and I\nwent over to the Marxists because that suited my philosophy a lot more and I stayed with\nthem and eventually they were the ones that helped me to then immigrate to Israel, that was\nafter, but we'll get to this. Now I want to talk just a little bit about school because all these\ntimes I went to school, too. Right after the, 1945, as soon as the school started, my mother\nwas determined that I should go to the School of Commerce, the high schools were\nspecialized, and there was one that was called, the Special High School for Commerce. Can\nyou stop it for a second because I want to close the window. So as I said, my mother was\ndetermined that I should go there, of course, I had no desire but I was still a good boy and I\nstarted at that school and the fact that it was the middle of the year, basically, and I missed\nthe first half of a year wasn't a big problem because anybody who was a, a Holocaust\nsurvivor at that time can just about do anything. So this was no big problem, the big\nproblem came when I noticed how many of my teachers are outright anti-American, anti-\nRussian, anti-Semitic, they haven't changed their attitude and there were some other Jewish\nkids in that school and I got together with them and I asked them if, if we should tolerate\nthis, if they think this is correct and everybody was kind of lying low, the usual way, and I\nsaid, \u201cNo, I am not going to do that.\u201d There was specifically one teacher who had, I forgot,\nhad a German name, a very small man who not only was anti-Semitic and anti-Russian and\nanti-everything and very pro-German, but agitating. He was not just making statements, he\nwas really agitating and in a very emotional way and I was, I just, I reached a point where I\njust couldn't take it anymore, not after what happened, just, you know, in the last few years\nand my boy scout commander, and at that time I was still kind of hanging on with the boy\nscout movement, my boy scout commander was now a member of the new Hungarian Secret\nPolice and he was an officer and he escaped from the labor camp and went over to the\nRussians and all this and came back with the Russian troops already and was one of the\norganizers. And I went to see him and I said, \u201cThis man should be removed from the\nschool.\u201d And they did take him in and somehow they went down the list at school and found\nout that I was the one who reported him because it was obvious since I was constantly\narguing with him, arguing with him in class and so. . .\nEnd of Tape 5, Side A\nTape 5, Side B",
        "A: I just had to quit. And then I continued my studies, I did not want to have the same\nexperience again and I went to the Jewish, the Jewish rabbi school, really, what it was, it was\na school to educate future teachers, but it was a high school still. Just like my previous high\nschool was specialized for commercial jobs, this one was, basically, a teaching gymnasium, a\nteaching high school, which meant by the laws of Hungary at that time that once you\nfinished\u2014and it was instead of four, five classes, so you were nineteen when you finished\nthe school\u2014you were then an elementary school teacher at the age of nineteen without any\ncollege education. I was there at this school and, of course, as far as any kind of a bad\nexperience, I didn't have any. Now I was among my own people, there were some very, very\ngood friends, I liked the school, it was nothing special, 1t was not challenging me, the only\naspect most of us didn't like is the religious aspect, which we didn't take very seriously. So\nactually, I was still in that school in my eighteenth year when eventually, and we will go\nback to this, I emigrated, emigrated to Israel, and so I never really finished my high school.\nBut out of deference to what happened and all this, I got a diploma. So I had a high school\ndiploma which, of course, my parents got later because I needed one and... so these are the\ntwo schools. Once I reached this level of the, this, the Jewish teaching high school for, high\nschool for future teachers, whatever, it's very difficult to translate into English, perhaps\nLyceum is a good name for it, once I reached that, then as far as my experiences after the\nHolocaust, there was no problem, you know, it's obvious. Now, going back, of course in the\nmeantime, in the Zionist movement, a lot of changes took place because we had to go\npractically underground. As the communist regime established itself in Hungary and in 1948\nthe famous turn, Year of the Turn came about, which happened in every Eastern European\ncountry, and the Year of the Turn is an expression when the communists took control,\ncomplete power, because until 1948, we had democracy in Eastern Europe, those countries\nthat knew what democracy was. And Hungary had some very able politicians and was really\non its road to become a democracy, so was Czechoslovakia, and probably Poland, too, of\ncourse, Romania was very different. But, in 1948, everything has changed, we became,\nagain, just like with the illegal boy scout group before 1945, I found myself belonging to an\nillegal organization, Zionism was outlawed because all of a sudden Stalin and company\nfound Zionism, of course, a tool of the imperialists as they called it. So we were doing,\nbasically, the same things that we were doing before, but now very cautiously, illegally, and\nmeetings were held usually either in some far away synagogues, basements or in some\nJewish orphanages where it was not very obvious if, let's say, twenty, thirty people came in\nand out because there were hundreds of people living there anyway. The, many times we\nparaded as young communists, if we wanted to have a larger meeting somewhere, singing\ncommunist songs when somebody came by, but otherwise doing our own business. By\n1949, early 1949, the situation almost was intolerable and, basically, they wanted to have the\nwhole Zionist movement leave, not the communists, but the Zionist movement wanted to get\nas many people out as possible, fearing that if Czechoslovakia is going to turn also\ncompletely communist, that there will be no way from Hungary to go anywhere. By that\ntime we could only go illegally across the border. And I think it was in February, 1949, that\nI got an order from my Zionist leadership to go to a little northern town, Vacz, V-A-C-Z, my\nmother comes from that town and they knew it. My job was to go to the mayor of the town\nand ask him if he would like to have a high school orchestra give a, an evening concert on\nsome given date. I went there, I mentioned to the mayor that I had been to Vacz many, many\ntimes because my grandparents, cousins, aunts, I had a lot of relatives and my mother was\nborn here, and of course, he was overwhelmed that a high school orchestra is coming to play.\nI then went to a printer, this was one of my instructions, and had all kinds of posters printed\nadvertising the date and the concert. Went back, reported it and the next command was that\non a certain day, I would have to go with an instrument or with an instrument case to a\ncorner of Budapest and there would be a bus there, a state bus, by that time every bus\ncompany was nationalized, and I have to board the bus with a lot of other people and I have\nto pretend that I am a member of a high school band, whatever instrument I am playing, and\ndo, not to talk about anything, Zionism or Israel, anything like that. And just wait for further\ninstructions there. And of course, I was notified that this is it, that we would be going to\nIsrael and I bid farewell to my family and got an instrument case, boarded the bus on a\ncertain date and time and I saw all my fellow Zionist members, the ones who were in my\ngroup, and we started toward the Czechoslovakian border.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I had very ambivalent feelings like a lot of those Jews who did not come from the upper\nmiddle class or upper class. I came from definitely no better than the middle of the middle\nclass or rather, perhaps, the lower middle class. My father came from a very low class\nproletarian family which was very unusual among the Jews of Hungary. My mother came\nfrom a little petit bourgeois family from the northern Hungarian town. They thought they\nwere middle class, but it depends on how you classify this, as far as I'm concerned they were\nkind of a pseudo-petit bourgeois people, the kind who, it's very difficult to define them, but\nthere was not much work and a lot of complaining. Now, because I never had a very, let's\nsay satisfactory and wealthy life, naturally I had some sympathies with, with the Marxist\nmovement, it's obvious. Second, I had a very definite sympathy with them because they\nwere the most adamant about taking the war criminals and punish them. They were the most\nanti-fascist and all these things appealed to me. I was, you can consider even though I was\nnot a member, really after my one month experience, I was not a member, at least I didn't\nconsider myself a member of the Communist Party, but I certainly was sympathizing with a\nlot of their goals, even though I was in a completely different game by that time, knowing I\nwould go to Israel. But, this is probably why I changed my affiliation and went from a\nbourgeoisie Zionist organization to a Marxist Zionist organization where I felt very much at\nhome. And there were, of course, ugly things happening, the communist takeover in Eastern\nEurope was not a very pleasant occasion. And one only had to think a little bit clearly and\nrise above all this emotion to see that the communists used very nasty methods to eliminate\nanyone who disagreed with them. And the more power they grabbed, the more vicious they\nbecame. And of course, eventually I, the Zionists suffered more what anybody who was\nconsidered a Zionist or anybody, like my father, who could have been executed if they\ndiscovered that he was with Tito, so if you were an enemy for one reason or another, there\nwas no law. The communists created their own laws, the secret police had free hand and, of\ncourse, I began to become very disappointed in that. My father, he was always a Social\nDemocrat, and he never, never approved what the Communist Party was doing in Hungary.\nAnd he was very courageous because when the Communist Party gobbled up the Social\nDemocratic Party, he sent in a postcard and said, \u201cExcuse me, but I don't want to join you.\u201d\nWhich was very courageous because from there on, you could have been watched. The fact\nthat he comes from a working class and was a very little fish, I think saved his life. But if he\nhad been a name, probably he would have been killed then. And so, politics, yes, I kept my\neye on politics all the time and this helped me in 1949 to just go, because I figured there will\nnever be peace here, there will never be peace here. And, do you have any other questions?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yes, I was very naive, really, at the age of fifteen, for some reason, I thought that a better\nworld is coming. And I was deeply disappointed when I heard that there were even pogroms\nin the countryside where a few Jews dared to come back to a village or a town in Hungary, in\nPoland, in Slovakia, I think the Czechs were the only ones who acted in a very civilized way,\nbut then they were always civilized and the most civilized in Eastern Europe. That\ndisappointed me, people were killed, survived Auschwitz, came home and killed in a\npogrom in Hungary and in some other Eastern European countries, two years after the war.\nAnd that made me very bitter and my idealism and my naivete really evaporated.",
        "A: I have not been directly in an anti-Semitic incidence because I avoided, I avoided them, I\navoided any kind of such thing. I associated mainly with my own kind because I saw that\nthere is no hope. Now, this interestingly must have changed to a certain extent because\nalmost every one of my cousins is married to a gentile in Hungary, I think with the exception\nof maybe two, but every one of them, and the marriages are very solid. So I, and it's not,\nthey are still not what you would call a truly middle class family, that most of them still\nstayed in, you know, auto mechanics and this and that, that part. Now, the ones who are up\nthere, went to college and became dentists and those, they are all married to other Jews. It's\na very interesting phenomenon. But I have not experienced anything except when, right\nafter the war at school. Okay? I heard people constantly yelling anti-Semitic slogans,\nespecially at soccer games, but I knew that I can't expect anything else any more.",
        "A: Yes, I had dreams and that was probably a, a, just a marvelous high of my youth. The\nwhole, the Zionists did a, a fantastic job in catching the spirit of young people and really\ngiving us what we wanted to have. We had a relatively free life, we had, we had a picture of\na heroic future for us, whether we are going to be still serving in the army in Israel or just\nworking in a kibbutz as farmers, almost everything about it had a kind of a super human\ntouch that I'm going to be better than all these people around here who are running around\nlike ants on the cities of Budapest, I'm going to lead a very healthy life, and finally I'm going\nto have a country, I have a home, I will have a fatherland and it was, it was a marvelous\nfeeling. And also, the whole, the whole setup, the whole organization, you know, until then,\nuntil 1946 or so, most of the picture that we saw of Jewish people is, is like sheep going into\nAuschwitz. And all of a sudden these people come from Israel, they are beautiful looking\npeople. And not only that, they had courage, the way they carried themselves and they were\nteaching us a lot of things, you know, Israel sent a lot of, they called them Schliahs, people\nthat, those who are sent, I think, literally. And they were in charge of all these camps where\nwe had to go to where we were taught self-defense and, you know, we lived on a tree in one\ncamp, I think what, for forty-eight hours, we were given a piece of rope and a knife and we\nhad to stay up, and sleep up there and make our bed and all this. I mean, which young\nperson doesn't like this? The whole image of the Jew has changed 1n our mind and we said,\n\u201cGod, it's beautiful.\u201d\u201d And when we were in danger, they were the ones who led us out of\ndanger. I remember once I was up in the BorzsOny mountains in Hungary in a self-defense\ncamp for a week and somebody betrayed us to the police and the police surrounded us and\nthere was a creek, not deeper, I don't think it was deeper than maybe twenty inches, and\nguess who is the one who escaped from the creek in order to do something, not to save his\nown skin, but he was immediately telephoning and all this and that and eventually we were\nreleased. The Israeli whatever, diplomat, I can't call them, the diplomat is not the right word\nbecause you picture somebody, you know, with a tie and suit and all this, but they were just,\nI, messengers or whatever, leaders. And he escaped, he escaped in that creek, crawling in\ntwenty inch of water, you know, getting on something that blend in with the, with the rocks,\nI mean they were unbelievable, unbelievable people. And women, you know, it's, it's, okay,\nafter them the women came and, I mean this is a completely different Jew. I mean, and\nwhen I took my wife to Israel, she understood that, that there was just something about those\nkids. And so this, this, of course, was, they were idols and it was very easy to follow them.\nAnd they were, they were not really demagogues, I remember quite a few of them who got\nquite introverted, they were not giving you big speeches or something, but by personal\nexample, they were leaders because we followed them. So the, the bus going back to my\nescape from Hungary, the bus eventually reached Vacz and, needless to say, it didn't stop\nthere. Beyond Vacz, it became quite dark and our leader suggested to the bus driver that we\nstop somewhere and eat and there was a roadside pub where they also served food. We went\nin and we were given money and we could order something, and in that pub, there was a\nvery beautiful peasant woman, with I don't know how many skirts on her, this was the reason\nyou recognize a peasant woman, in those days they still wore a lot of skirts, you know, that's\nan Eastern European costume that a dozen skirts is no big deal. And she started to flirt with\nthe bus driver. And soon the bus driver came, went over to her table, and they had a good\ntime and, of course, we were getting more and more anxious that this is going to create a big\nproblem here, right? We knew that we were on a timetable. All of a sudden, the bus driver\nsaid to our leader, \u201cHow long do you think we will be here?\u201d And our leader said, \u201cWell, all\nthese kids eat, oh, a half an hour, forty-five minutes.\u201d He said, \u201cGood, I'll be back.\u201d and left\nwith the woman. We ate, and our leader said, \u201cOkay, line up outside.\u201d And instead of going\nback to the bus, he led us down on a field into a big barn, I would say about one mile down\nin a muddy field, 1t was February and snow and mud everywhere. We all got into the barn,\nabout thirty of us, they closed the doors, barn doors, and he said, \u201cOkay, don't worry.\nEverything will be okay.\u201d After midnight, 1:00 or so, the barn door opened and we were,\nthey said we have to get on line and marched down, there was the river Ipoly, I-P-O-L-Y,\nand that was the border between Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The Austrian border was\nalready sealed, but the Czechs still let Zionist groups come over, it was kind of an\narrangement, the Joint did it for a lot of money, however, they didn't know which border,\nCzech border guard was a communist or not, so we have to be very careful. And once we\nwent beyond the border guards, everything was organized there, I will go back to this. So as\nwe were marching down, I saw a woman in a leather jacket with a revolver hanging on her\nhip in blue jeans. I looked at this woman's face, said, \u201cHey, I have seen her before.\u201d And I\nlooked and said, \u201cThis is the woman in the pub.\u201d This is to show you how organized they\nwere. I mean, the Germans couldn't have done better, really, with their devilish organization.\nI mean, everything, if you understood the whole, they called it aliyah, the going of, to Israel.\nIf you understood that, how they did it, you can understand how they could survive. All\nright? Surrounded by, of course, a sea of enemies. Once we got down to the river, we had to\ntake our shoes off, and we kept everything on our head, the river was not high enough, we\ncouldn't swim, so we had to walk, but I was very small, and it got to my throat at one time.\nNow this is February, imagine. We got over to the other side and it was supposed to be that\nthe border guards change, everything was according to the clock, and something happened\nand the border guards did not change the way they were supposed to, they were still talking\nto each other. There was snow on the ground and the dogs, their dogs were barking, so we\nhad to lie down on the snow for about a half an hour, wet. And many of us got sick, right\nthere. I myself, I lost, I got frostbitten and even today I suffer for that. Now, then the border\nguards finally were gone and we went up, there was a house where they used to press grapes,\nit was a grape growing region, but had no roof and the wind was blowing and I remember, I\ndon't think I have ever been colder in my life since then. And so we huddled together\nbecause now we missed the truck that was supposed to pick us up right down on a highway\nbeyond that hill, so the Israelis, the two Israelis, a man and a woman who were leading us,\nthey went down and eventually, in about four or five hours, they located the truck, the truck\ncame back, the truck was looking for us and then left and then, anyway the truck came back,\nwe got up on the truck, the canvas, the top was taken down, and from there on, all we heard\nwas the engine of the truck was occasionally, when they were halted and the word dollar, the\nword dollar came back all the time, I remember that.\nEnd of Tape 5, Side B\nTape 6, Side A",
        "A: I, my best friend in that group was a young man by the name of Zev Rotics. He lives in\nIsrael at this time still, in Haifa, at Rehov Shunamit 14, and we correspond monthly, we have\nbeen ever since, ever since that time, and eventually when I left Israel, we corresponded, we\nkept up and I consider him my best friend. He's about the only person I keep up with. Oh\nno, there was one, another, a man by the name of Nissan Meschel, and I have no, he is in\ntouch with my friend, Zev Rotics, but I lost touch with him, so I have no idea what\nhappened, I just know that he's living there. But the others, the, I remember one young lady\nwho was with us and she, unfortunately, had eventually pneumonia when we got to Vienna,\nwhich I will go back to when I continue the story of the journey, and died in Vienna of\npneumonia, and she's buried there somewhere in the cemetery and I always planned to go\nand visit her, but I always run out of time and I don't know where she is buried, probably\nthere is no more than one Jewish cemetery, so when I go back to Israel I'm going to find out\nbecause my wife... Zev Rotics, sometimes he goes to the meetings of our old friends and so\nhe would know. Now, after the truck finally stopped in Bratislava. In Bratislava they took\nus to the gendarmerie where, as a formality, we were arrested, and interned in the synagogue,\nthey took us to the synagogue that had already warm rooms, straw on the floor, blankets,\ngood food, everything, and we were told that next morning we are going on. And it was\nvery strange because next morning, again, the gendarmerie surrounded the synagogue, it was\na big show, of course, all just in case some Soviet authority is watching. And they took us to\nthe railroad station where we were taken in boxcars, how interesting, locked up, quite a few\npeople in boxcars, and the train started and I think within an hour or so, they opened up and\nwe were in the American sector of Vienna. Because Bratislava is very close to Vienna. We\nstayed in Vienna for, I think, two, one or two weeks, and in an American hospital, that's\nwhere the Joint somehow got an American hospital for the Zionist members and we were all\nthere and we were given good food and warm rooms and it was very pleasant, the only thing\nwe were always warned about, not to ever wander into the Soviet section. We were free to\nwander around, the city was still divided into four sections, American, British, French and\nSoviet. And sometimes we had to go very close to the Soviet section in going to, I\nremember going to a swimming pool, it was on the edge, and so everybody was nervous.\nBut, basically, it was a good time. Vienna was full of refugees, full of life. After one week\nor so, then we were taken across, again by trucks, across the Alps into, no I have to correct\nmyself, to, not to Austria, to a, a,a UNRRA camp, UNRRA was the United Nations Refugee\nAssociation or something, so the joint gave us temporarily over to UNRRA and we were\nhoused in a beautiful area of the Alps in a town called Zaalfelden. It is a, on a lake, just the\nother side from Germany, and there were some very picturesque villages nearby, and I\nremember even though here the food was very meager and we still were hiking almost every\nday and going up in the mountains, and I remember that just above our camp, our refugee\ncamp, there was a place, a mountain hut where Hitler and Mussolini met and we had to see it\nand sometimes a cabbage soup a day just didn't give us enough energy, but we were still\npushing for it, we wanted to see it. We stayed here, again, one or two weeks and then on,\nagain, now over the border to Italy. In Italy, they took us again to the train station,\nsomewhere in northern Italy, and the train then was closed up and sealed, but regular train,\nwe just could not leave the train, Italian detectives were on the train to make sure that\nnobody escapes because it was ridiculous because who wants to escape to Italy, at least at\nthat ttme? And we were taken down to Bari. Now, the only thing that stands out in my mind\nwas that a lot of times when the train stopped, we, of course, rolled the windows down and\nthe good looking girls among us ended up with dozens of pictures from Italian men, written\non it, I love you, I'm going to marry you and all this, by the time we got to Bari, I think the\ngirls were exchanging pictures and who wanted this one and this one? I mean it was a funny\nthing to see that those men were really just instantly falling in love with these girls. In Bari,\na ship was waiting for us, if you could call it a ship. It was called the Galil, Galilea or\nGalilee, I forgot exactly, and so we boarded the ship and in two days or three days, 1t must\nhave been three I think, we were going to reach Haifa. Everybody got sea sick, the boat was\nan old, old fishing boat that the Israeli government brought from, bought from Greece and it\nwas a primitive thing, very primitive. And I know I have a very strong will and I don't want\nto, you know, go back to that, to the story, but I never throw up, somehow I just psych\nmyself up ever since I was a little kid as a result of an incident that I would not throw up.\nAnd I remember I was the only one on the ship who could eat. Everybody else was just\nconstantly throwing up and so we arrived, by the time we arrived in Haifa, everybody was\njust yellow and green and wouldn\u2019t want to look at food. Now, the funny thing about this\nship is that a few years ago I was travelling in France with my wife and we stopped in the\nLoire valley in a small little town, Blois, and as we were walking in the town there was a\nkind of a summer suit that I wanted to buy, it was very inexpensive and I needed a summer\nsuit for wearing on some occasion that I have to wear a suit and I went into the shop and I\nwas trying on the suit when the owner of the shop all of a sudden yelled and said, \u201cShalom\nhaver.\u201d And it appears he was talking to my wife and somehow it came that he was a\nMoroccan Jew and he was telling, I think, my wife that he was a Moroccan Jew and all this,\nbecause he had a definite Arabic name. And so my wife, I think, told him that I was Jewish,\ntoo you know, and this, so he invited us after the deal\u2014which was a good one\u2014he invited\nus to a bar down on the street, an outdoor caf\u00e9, to drink something with him. And during the\nconversation he asked me a little bit about my life and he said to, and I asked him and he\nsaid, \u201cOh, I was in Israel, I was a sailor.\u201d I said, \u201cWhere did you sail?\u201d He said, In the\nMediterranean, of course,\u201d and I said, \u201cWhat ship?\u201d He said, \u201cThe Galilea.\u201d\u2019 \u201cWhat time?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cFrom 1948 to 1950 something.\u201d Well, he was on that ship, you know, and I mean\nit was a small ship and he was one of the sailors. Well, when we arrived in Haifa, of course,\nthat was a very emotional scene and then eventually, the war, basically, was finished and\nthere was no temporary animosity so then we, our movement went to a kibbutz there where\nwe then blended in and one year after we were taught a trade in the kibbutz and we got our\nown land then. I don't know what else you want to know about the Israeli thing.",
        "A: Yes, everyone went to the same kibbutz except the ones who did not want to go to the\nkibbutz, had relatives who were waiting for them and this was a little bit of a disappointment\nto us because theoretically, everybody was supposed to stay together, but this was not the\ncase. There were, not everybody wants to live in a kibbutz because it is a very difficult\nliving for those who dream of money and wealth and their own car and all this because it's a,\nat that time it was a very perfect community, but it was a community, you didn't have a great\ndeal that you owned at all, you know, you were lucky if you had a radio that you can call\nyour own. So we lost, I would say, about one-third of our group who had planned, but not\nshared their plan with us, to go immediately and stay on the outside.",
        "A: All Zionist youth organizations basically, with very little exception, very few exceptions,\nwere geared toward the kibbutz. This was an understanding back in Eastern Europe where\nwe were recruited that Israel, and they always brought the example of the pyramid, that the,\nwe Jews, we always like a pyramid on the top, we had all the, the farmers, and down at the\nbottom where the pyramid is the largest, we had all the intellectuals, and Israel needed a\npyramid upside down, where the largest group is going to be the farmers and the agricultural\ngroup, and the smallest one is going to be the intellectuals, the tip of the pyramid. So almost\nevery Zionist organization, that was the very strong influence and educational goal to teach\nyou to go and be a farmer in a collective, you know? So that was the reason why most of us\ndid go to a kibbutz. And who decided it? It was decided above, that had nothing to do with\nus, where we would go, we were assigned to an old kibbutz, very old, experienced, large\nkibbutz, called Givat Chajim, in Israel which is in, about midway between Haifa and Tel\nAviv and this is where we learned our trade for one year, we stayed there for one year.",
        "A: We did not speak any Hebrew when we arrived there, most of us didn't speak any Hebrew,\nexcept the ones who came from very religious families. They knew quite a bit and for them\nit was much easier to learn, we spoke no Yiddish because Hungarians do not speak,\nHungarian Jews, very few Hungarian Jews speak Yiddish, and so at first we felt a little bit\nkind of ostracized by the community, especially the young Israeli kids. There were so many\nHungarians coming in at that time that the Hungarians even had a nickname in Israel, they\nwere called Igen-Migen, Igen means yes in Hungarian and so kids would go after us on the\nstreet and call us Igen-Migen, Igen-Migen, because they heard us speak. And so we were in\na big hurry to learn Hebrew. And then when we learned Hebrew, we had another thing, the\nHungarian language is such that your accent stays with you no matter what language you\nlearn, and so we had a very thick accent, even when we were speaking Hebrew, so we had\nour difficulties with the language, but most of us learned it eventually. I was there in Israel\nfor two years and by the time I came home, I was really speaking fluently.",
        "A: Okay, I was a tractor driver in the kibbutz and worked out plowing everything connected\nwith the tractor, it was called a Falha, that particular branch, and from sacking, you know,\nflours and up to plowing and then seeding and cultivating, we had, we did everything. Then\nwe got our own land, own piece of land, which was a reclaimed area on the train line\nbetween Tel Aviv and Haifa, it was the, the, the Israel and Jordan swapped land and so\nJordan give back a piece of land so the train service can go from Tel Aviv to Haifa because\npart of the train line was in Jordan. This was the land that we received, and it was a very\ndangerous place, so when we, the first day we went out there, I remember, was really hair\nraising because the tractor drivers had to go down and plow and the, the weed in Israel is\nmuch higher than a human being and also we didn't know where the mines, if there were any\nmines. And even though the army supported us and they did give us, you know, generous\nsupport there, we the tractor drivers had to go down and practically open up the area. And so\nwe were very respected in the kibbutz for that reason. Above us was an Arab town, Tul\nKarem, which today is under Israeli occupation and still a very hot spot for riots. And I\nremember that Arab town practically you could see the people on the street, and here we\nwere on the other side living, you know, two enemies and of course, I had a lot of adventures\nbecause of living on the border, but then again, that has not much to do with the Holocaust\nand I am sure that the Holocaust Museum has a lot of testimonies from Israelis so they don't\nneed. I don't know, but that's up to you, but I have a lot of stories that came to us as a result\nof living so close at that time, back in 1948, 1949, on the border, you know.",
        "A: Well, when we first showed up, when we first showed up, the first day, there were Arab\nshepherds down on the other side of the barbed wire, the border was just marked with a\nbunch of barbed wire. And when they saw us, they emitted a sound like woo-woo-woo, and\nthey were running away, they were just scared to death. These were shepherds, very poor\npeople, and we didn't know exactly who they were, but we learned eventually, that they\nwere, they were working for the local, you know, sheik or whomever owns the land for very\nlittle. And eventually, we also saw that here on this side of the border we are plowing with\nup-to-date 20\"-century machinery and we saw not far from us, a man on a horseback\nwhipping people just because they did something apparently that did not please them. The\nowner of the land had practically complete jurisdiction over these poor fellows, and that was\njust a few hundred yards from where we were working. As they got used to us, they came\ncloser and closer and when they saw that we don't mean any harm, they came down to the\nbarbed wire many times, watching to make sure that nobody sees them and tried to make\nfriends with us and we did make friends with them for, the main reason is that chocolate was\nvery expensive in Israel those days, cocoa, and we already had quite a few children in our\ngroup, babies. Cigarettes were very expensive for some reason in Jordan and they were very\ncheap in Israel, American cigarettes. So they asked, oh, these people offered us a deal, but\nthey did not want to do it during the day because they were afraid that the... Jordan had the\nbest military force, the Arab Legion, trained by the British and they were afraid that they\nwere patrolling there and all this and it was a serious crime to deal with, with Israelis. So at\nnight in the darkness, and I remember it was my turn, too, it was always a few people and\nalways the tractor drivers because we had the contact with the border people, we went down\nbecause they would recognize us and it was a very risky thing, they could have just shot me\ndead right there, it could have been a trap. We went down and we were doing all the\nbusiness, they jumped over or we went over, but mainly they came over because they were\nmuch better fence jumpers than we were. So this was one contact that we had. The other\none was not so pleasant, these wadis, dry river beds, that run across, they don't recognize\nborders, they run, you know, back and forth, Israel, Jordan, and in, when they are dry which\nis most of the time, this 1s where the Arab thieves come over, they use these river beds\nbecause you can't see them, they are, you know, they are like little canyons. And they would\ncome over in these river beds and go into other areas and steal, mainly animals. And they\nwere unbelievably good thieves. They would steal, they can, they would steal a cattle, they\nwould steal a donkey, they would steal a horse surrounded by walls. Nobody could ever\nfigure out how they did it. So the army hired us to be kind of a paramilitary force and go out\nand lie, so we had to lie down in the wadis and a few of us, we didn't have very good guns,\nwe had old Czech guns, and wait for these thieves to come. And I only had one occasion\nwhen three of us were in a patrol and there were about fifteen or twenty of these coming by\nand we didn't feel like getting murdered by them because what chances do we have? And so\nwe let them go by and then reported to the border police that they went by, but we didn't\nwant to engage in any fire fight there. Now, my good experience was with the Jordanian\nLegion, which then eventually had also a sad ending. All of a sudden one day we were, I\nwas plowing I remember, and I had to have always a guard on my tractor with a submachine\ngun who was constantly casing and watching because I was so close to the border and this\nwas a friend of mine one day who was a guard in an Arab POW camp, an Israeli POW camp,\nguarding Arabs during the War of Independence, so he learned some Arabic from them.\nAnd you will see why this is important, and all of a sudden we saw some, an Arab Legion\npatrol right by the barbed wire and they were motioning to us to come down and we said no,\nyou know. And so they went away. Next day they came and again they were motioning,\nthey said, \u201cPeace, peace.\u201d\u2019 So finally they went back about fifty yards and they put their guns\ninto a pile and then came back, showing that they had no weapons and they told us, \u201cSit\ndown on that side of the border. What can we do?\u201d They were about twelve, if they really\nwanted to kill us, we said, \u201cOkay, let's go down. What do they want?\u201d They just wanted to\ntalk to us and from there on, every day they would come down at a certain time and\neventually they, the Arabs have watermelon all over, so it was like a party, they would yell at\none of these poor fellows who was working there and I, this is all I learned in Arabic, what it\nis, \u201cHey, bring me a watermelon.\u201d Yalla Jibbu Battiyah. And they brought a watermelon\nand they would slice it and we were eating, almost every day we had a little lunch there\ntogether, we brought some stuff. And this went on for weeks and weeks and weeks and\nweeks. And eventually we really fooled our countries because sometimes they came over\nand ate and laughed that they ate in Israel and sometimes we jumped over and we said, \u201cOh,\nwe ate in Jordan.\u201d And one day it was our turn, we stopped the tractor, they haven't come\ndown yet so we were waiting for them, but we were already sitting on the other side, we had\na little blanket, we put it down, all the food from our kitchen and all of a sudden a patrol is\nthere, but it is a totally different patrol. What happened, apparently somebody saw them and\nreported them, I don't know what ever happened, I never saw them again and these guys\nwere, they drew their guns and they are going to shoot us. And you know that border was no\njoke, every night somebody was killed there, either an Israeli or an Arab. Very innocent\npeople, you know, sometimes a, one night I felt so badly, a young couple, lovers, were\nwalking around and apparently they were in the wrong place and an Israeli guard, and most\nof the Israeli border guards were from Arab countries, Arab Jews, well, not Arab, that sounds\nkind of strange, but Jews from Arab countries, and they were vicious. I mean, you could not\nget better border guards and they were, they hated the Arabs more than we hated the Nazis.\nAnd so they were, they were, they saw one at night, they were shooting sometimes for no\nreason. So that was a very poisonous atmosphere there, and I mean it took a long time and\nthe fact that my friend spoke some Arabic and all this and mitigated the situation, but then\nthe man said, \u201cHow come you speak some Arabic? Where did you learn it?\u2019 And then he\nhad to kind of, so finally the sergeant who was leading all them, always a master sergeant\nleading the patrol, he said, \u201c\u201cYou have one luck that I have a son of your age.\u201d He said, \u201cIf I\never see you even down touching the barbed wire,\u201d he said, \u201cI am going to just make dust\nout of you.\u201d And of course, we never went back again. That was, these are some\nexperiences living on the border.",
        "A: Well, it was a very simple conversation because we had a language problem, it was mainly\nsign language quite a bit, and we were talking about, basically, these people were talking\nabout their children, they showed pictures of their families and the word peace, Salaam or\nShalom in Hebrew, was constantly mentioned. And I have a feeling that all of us involved,\nprobably, if they are, hopefully they are alive, will always remember this and that kind of\nsoftened us up, so we know that human beings can relax under certain circumstances and we\ndon't have to be enemies. It was the first time that I realized that an Arab can, doesn't\nnecessarily have to be my opponent, you know\u2019?",
        "A: About a hundred, about a hundred, and all from Hungary. But other kibbutzim had\nsometimes mixed.\nEnd of Tape 6, Side A\nTape 6, Side B",
        "A: At first I was very, very idealistic. Then somehow, I felt a little bit disappointed where in\nour kibbutz, all kinds of political groups tried to kind of tear us apart. And there were more\nand more arguments and somehow this and the fact that as the country settled down into so-\ncalled peace, if we can call it, the usual symptoms that every nation in the world experiences,\nsurfaced, such as crime and... but the fact that there were Jewish criminals, that shocked me.\nYou know, I was so naive that I thought that anybody goes to Israel, certainly doesn't want\nto do anything to hurt another human being. There were even, even murderers, and I just\none day after another, these things, they added to my little disappointment, but I was still\nenjoying myself because I love to be outdoors and we, we did the physical work and it was\nall that a young person wants for self-image, good self-image, we had a very good self-image\nof ourselves. There were two things that contributed to my, to my coming, going back to\nHungary eventually in '51. One was, all of a sudden I realized that I, in all my life I loved\nmy father very, very much, and this 1s a, I mean it's a fact, there is nothing you can do about\nit, I loved my father more than I loved my mother. Somehow I always considered my\nmother a little bit of a, of a kind of petit bourgeois that I never really completely understood.\nAnd I thought that she was a little bit, she was just in another, in other words, she wanted\nme to be also, you know, like she was, and play the piano and all these things and I was not\nthe type. So I was not that close to her even though I was with her all the time and\npractically, I was also instrumental in saving her life in the war when I dragged her with me\neverywhere and all this, but my father, and I realized I spent very little time with my father\nas a young man because he was always away in, in the concentration camp. And now he\nwas home and now they couldn't come any more, Hungary was sealed. And then I also, at\nthe age of nineteen, became somehow involved with a group of cynical people. And I met\nthem here and there and some of them I knew from Hungary and they were married to this\nand this, I just somehow was under the influence of these who saw nothing nice any more in\nIsrael except the bad things. This, the homesickness plus the fact that then I began to get all\nkinds of propaganda material from Hungary and somehow, this was the third thing, I was\nmisled by all this, what I read, and I thought that the situation changed and Hungary is such a\nmarvelous country today. And my parents tried to communicate to me, even though they\nnever wanted me to really go away, but now they didn't want me to really come home, they\nwere afraid what would happen to me. And that, they just apparently didn't come across\nquite well because I, eventually I just decided I want to go back to Hungary, and probably\nhomesickness had a great deal to do, I, at that time as a young man, I didn't realize that you\ncan't go home again, you know? I envisioned that everything is going to be back and all this.\nWell, I then applied to the Hungarian Embassy, got a permit and the Israelis, of course,\ndidn\u2019t keep me there, and in 1951, I returned to Hungary. And those were the worst years,\naside from October 15th, those years were the worst years of my life, the next two or three\nyears.",
        "A: The kibbutz was also very well organized, this was an old kibbutz and it was like a clock\nwork. Also, there was a hierarchy which naturally some people didn't understand, but I had\nno argument with that because I realized a person who came here fifty years ago when there\nwas nothing here except rocks and Arabs shooting at them, has, 1s more equal, right, than\nsomebody who arrives here today. It was well run, it was a wealthy kibbutz, there was very\ngood food, there was culture, they made sure that orchestras are coming, good ones,\nentertainment, no, I had absolutely no feeling of let down in this respect. No, I admired the\nway they carried on. Just a little, just a little thing that shows that how they thought of\neverything: shoveling manure, for example, of course, not something that somebody wants\nto do for the rest of his or her life, so or washing dishes in the kitchen, so there were, there\nwere certain things in the kibbutz that it was not a, an area where you were assigned\npermanently, they were temporary. And so everybody knew that once in a month I have to\nshovel manure and once a month or twice a month, I have to wash the dishes, so, there were\nsome other, but even this was taken care of, you know, I think in a very human manner.",
        "A: I was naively thinking about going to the university and continuing with my education to\nbecome a teacher, a high school teacher, and so I went back through the Bosporus, Turkey,\nBlack Sea, Romania and then Hungary. Travelling through Romania by train, in 1949,\nexcuse me, 1951, was quite an experience, the people just looked at me, looked at me and\nsince there are quite a few Hungarians in Romania, I then... eventually they found out that I\nspeak Hungarian, so there was always a Hungarian there and asked me and I very naively\ngive all the details of my life and all this and that, and I didn't understand why they looked at\nme, just looked at me, just looked at me, and also Romania was tremendously gray and I\ncould only think of 1984, going across Romania. And that was only the beginning, 1951,\nyou know?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: Yes, I refer to the book 1984, or the movie rather, okay? It's the same thing, but the movie 1s\nthe one that I always keep in my mind when I think of Romania. So I arrived on the\nHungarian border and here was an officer on the border looked at my papers and all this and\nhe, I'll never forget what he told me, he said to me, \u201cI don't know where you come from, but\nit must have been very bad, very bad there, that you come from.\u201d And he looked at me and\nsaid, \u201cWelcome to Hungary.\u201d And this was a border guard officer. And I thought this 1s a\nstrange thing, what does it mean? Well, I learned very quickly. When I boarded the train\nagain on the other side of the border, it was just as gray as coming through Romania and then\nfinally when I arrived home, I looked around, I realized that I was totally, totally misled.\nNever have I been misled before or after the way I was. I arrived there and it was the\ngrayest, most colorless, most suspicious, paranoid society you can imagine. And my bad\nperiod started with, of course, not being able to get a job, any job, there was no one, going to\nthe university, of course, was ridiculous to think about because I was an unreliable element, I\ncame home, number one, from the West, I was an imperialist agent, as far as they were\nconcerned, not only that, I was a Zionist imperialist agent. And it took me almost six month\nto get a job to sweep a floor, to sweep floors and clean oil off the concrete in a garage, in a\nstate-owned garage.",
        "A: With great connections, the fact that my father was from the working class and many of his\nbrothers and their friends were involved, but mainly their friends of where they come from,\nthis suburb of Hungary, a very poor one, suburb of Budapest, where now the communist\nofficials with great connections, but nobody wanted any names, nobody wanted to stick out\ntheir neck, they just somehow pushed some paperwork somewhere and I was an, kind of an\nauxiliary labor help, a no name person whom they hired because they needed somebody to\nclean something. And that was the only job I could get. What hurt me even more was the\nfact that my good friends on the street, some of them who stayed in Hungary, not too many\nbecause most of them escaped, but they would not want anything to do with me because\nmost people didn't want to touch me, didn't want to talk to me, they don't know me, they\nrather would go to the other side of the street than to meet me. Some probably out of disgust\nthat how stupid a human being can be to come back to this, and others for fear.",
        "A: Yes, yes, because I had been out, it doesn't have to be, it didn't have to be Israel, anyone, it\nwas a totally paranoid society, everything that happened in the Soviet Union was copied the\nnext day, you know. So the, I worked in this garage for about six month and I always\nnoticed with great nostalgia, how they have these posters about urging workers to go to\ncollege and I wanted to go to college, and I went to the Party secretary of the firm which had\nabout twelve garages, had to sign a paper that recommends you to go to the next step and\nevery time I went to see him, he laughed at me, he said, \u201c\u201cYou know that you are here by the\ngrace of a few people and not, you have no merits to go there.\u201d So the, my break came when\nthe secretary became very ill, the Party secretary of the firm, and they sent out a temporary\nParty secretary, and she was a woman, she was very busy when I entered, you know, dirty\nand overalls and all this, and when I told her what I wanted, I got an, this opportunity and\ntry, now, when I told her what I wanted, she said, \u201cWell, I don't have time to write you a\nrecommendation. I'm glad that a worker wants to go to college, we need working youth,\nwhy don't you dictate what you need to my secretary and I will just sign it.\u201d So I passed the\nfirst hurdle, with this I went to the university where I had to submit this. This was a\ncommittee, they interviewed you and they read your, you had to write your, your biography,\nautobiography for everything, everything. So here was a committee, admitting committee,\nthe Young Communist League, the Communist Party, one from the faculty, et cetera, about,\nI would say, seven, eight people. And when they got to certain points, they said, \u201cCome on,\nyou must be joking that you really think that, you know, you can come here.\u201d Well, I left\nand as I was going out a man whose name was Mr. Bartos, he was on the faculty, this was\nthe Hungarian Teachers Academy, this was the university where I wanted to go, it was called\nthe Teachers Academy, but it was part of the university. He came out and he said, \u201cHolczer,\nHolczer, didn't your father play on a certain soccer team?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201cDidn't\nyour father have four or five brothers playing on the same soccer team?\u201d And he said,\n\u201cYes.\u201d And he said, \u201cOkay, come back in September and see, maybe since you were a\nminor when you left the country, I will try and write to the Ministry of Education, maybe\nsomething can be done.\u201d Well, I was holding my breath for three months, I went back in\nSeptember and I went into the Party secretary's office, they had no idea who I was, they\ncouldn't find any paper, anything, so I was looking for him. And I found him and he said,\n\u201cJust a second.\u201d He went into the Party secretary, he came out a few minutes later and he\nsaid, \u201cI am very happy to inform you that the Minister of Education, on the basis that you\nwere a minor when you left Hungary, give you special permission to enter the university.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cNow, this was the last time you ever talk to me, you ever looked at me, you\never even thought that we have anything to do with each other. Never again.\u201d He said,\n\u201cThat is the price. You understand?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d Said, \u201cand say hello to your dad.\u201d That\nwas it. I went home, my father remembered him, they played on the same team. And he was\nthe head of the physical education branch of the faculty, you know? And this is how I got in.\nAnd I had a very, very good time because I found out ninety-nine percent of the kids\nthought the same way as I did and there were very few communists, very few. And yet,\nwhen it came to 1953, I almost was, I was thrown out for about one week. Stalin was dying\nand when he, in his last breath, he looked up, he saw doctors around him and he was\nparanoia, he said, \u201cWho are these?\u201d They said, \u201cDoctors.\u201d And Stalin was very anti-Semitic\nand he said, \u201cAre they Jewish doctors?\u201d And I think, out of twelve or so, seven or eight\nwere Jewish, they said, \u201cYes.\u201d They said, \u201cArrest them.\u201d And they were, all the doctors\naround Stalin were arrested a few days before he died. And then, when this happened, in\nHungary, too, they were looking for Jewish doctors or anybody who was, had anything to do\nwith Zionists because they called them the Zionist conspiracy against Stalin and they found\nme at the college. They had to, since this was a chain reaction, that went down. So they\nfound me and they told me to go home and that I am a Zionist this and Zionist that. And\nStalin died three days later and I mean, I was just heartbroken because it was before exams\nand all this and it was in March and I was ready to take my exams soon and then when\neverything died, died down, and the so-called Thaw, this is what they called it politically, the\nThaw started, then they called me back and they said forget about the whole thing and\ncontinue.",
        "A: Mmm-hmm.",
        "A: My father's former employers, either died or escaped in 1947 or 1948, to the West, so this,\nwhat I mentioned, was a volunteer work. Everybody, basically, had to volunteer to do\nsomething. This was volunteer work, he volunteered to be appointed to this position and this\nwas not a paid job. And it did not require a great deal of his time. He immediately looked\nfor some opportunity and started to work for a co-op, a lot of co-ops started and what co-ops\nwere are a group of people who banded together and formed a what you would call a, maybe\na small enterprise, as long as they worked under the ruse of a cooperation and everything\nwas divided, the profit if there was any, and they paid their taxes to the state, this was what\nthe communists considered kind of a happy in-between of state farms or state enterprise and\nprivate enterprise. Because private enterprise was phased out gradually, except in cases such\nas a Shoe maker that, you know, repairs shoes, but even for that, eventually, they had co-ops,\nshoemaker co-ops or tailor co-ops or this, but a few, a few of those branches, that you could\nnot really work any other way except in a co-op, but he was working for a co-op where he\nrose eventually, he was a very smart man, and he rose to be kind of a midlevel manager, but\nalso working and this co-op was working with a lot of women who would then get the\nmerchandise and do it at home. They were making shopping nets and shopping bags and\nthings like that that anybody can do on a sewing machine at home. And then they would\nbring it in and so actually they had a very, a very small area, a very small base and just a\nwarehouse and he enjoyed this, he enjoyed it and he was very much liked. The only problem\nhe had occasionally is that they asked him, because he was such a good worker, and he\nreceived all kinds of awards that he didn't really want particularly because he was not very,\nyou know, infatuated with the communist system, they always wanted him to join the Party\nbecause he was a perfect, what they called cadre, cadre, he comes from the working class, he\nwas a hard-working man, he was an honest man, he rose from nothing to a midlevel\nmanager, so he was an ideal person. But he never joined, he always said, \u201cNo, absolutely\nno.\u201d So that, he was such a good worker, they left him alone.",
        "A: No, my mother was totally just a mother and a housewife, she never had any, any, and I can't\nremember my mother having, you know, political opinion or anything like that, she had\nother interests. She read a lot and went to the movies and she loved visiting around during\nthe day, she was kind of a social butterfly.",
        "A: Yes, that was my, in college, geography and history.",
        "A: Interestingly, with most people, you could talk politics. You know, eventually, throughout\nthese years, we isolated the ones who were suspicious to us and... because they were always\neager beaver Party workers and give big speeches and some of them did big speeches and we\nknew that we can still talk to them, they\u2019re just careerists and they just want to go ahead.\nBut I would say the great majority, even in the worst days, we could still discuss things.\nObviously, we didn't do it on the street, we didn't do it elsewhere except in our own home or\nin a restaurant where there was a lot of noise and they couldn't discern, you know, who says\nwhat. So in this respect, we did not really have a kind of a prison atmosphere in college.\nAnd our professors, I would say eighty percent of them were very much against the regime\nand occasionally they let that go in very, you know, ambiguous statements. We recognized\nit immediately and all this, but just to give you one example, most of us, we had to go to\nRussian instruction every day, most of us either didn't show up or if we did, we didn't listen,\nwe didn't learn anything, and after going through college, at the end you had to take a state\nexam. And I, the exam in Hungary at that time was you had to draw a written note on which\nyou had a topic. And you were given fifteen minutes to take notes on that topic from your\nmemory, you were given a pencil and some paper, and when you were called upon, this was\nyour turn and you could talk about, introduce your topic and there was a committee. And I\nwent to my Russian exam, and this happened to other people too, and I drew my topic and I\ncouldn't even read the title, let alone, couldn't read the title, I Just, in these years I just never\nbothered to read, to learn enough to read. Today of course, I'm not very proud of this,\nbecause now I know that the more languages you speak, you know, the more lives you have,\nbut those days, this was a political statement, they couldn't believe it, they just couldn't\nbelieve it because I was straight A in my subjects and so there was tremendous animosity\ntoward me from the police, from the Party secretary and all the others. Can we stop?\nEnd of Tape 6, Side B\nTape 7, Side A",
        "A: Oh, the Russian exam. And then I found out later that some of my classmates had the same\nproblem and, eventually, they decided not to, not to have us back, so they just gave us a D\nand they were very angry about it. But in a way it was their fault, too, because how could we\nget up to that point, going through all classes, didn\u2019t they realize that something 1s wrong?\nWell, this, I remember this very distinctly, that that was one way to show our reaction to\nwhat was going on. And otherwise, even the ones who were very active in the Communist\nParty, most of them always gave us a signal that this is all a show, there is nothing to worry\nabout. There were very few people. So when I left the college, at that time, you, I became a\nteacher and we were supposed to go to the countryside, they could not, you could not teach\nin Budapest the first year and I was then assigned to a little, small village, not far from Vacz,\nfrom my mother's birthplace, only a few miles and taught there for a year. And this was a\nsmall village of a minority, Hungary has very few minorities, but they have some Slovak\nminorities in the North, these were Slovaks and they speak, they spoke very little Hungarian,\nbut they would not admit it because they were afraid that there would be repercussion, so\nthey asked for a Hungarian teacher, they could have asked for a Slovak-speaking teacher,\ntoo. And it was quite an experience, but it has nothing to do with being Jewish or with the\nHolocaust, none of that came up, it was just a totally different one. And then after this year\nthat I spent in... I made contact again, I wanted to get back with a youth organization and I\nfound interestingly that the Communist Youth Organization, the Pioneer organization\nprobably could use me because, I mean I went through the boy scouts, I went through the\nZionists, I had some very definite ideas and I answered an ad and became a director of a\nsummer camp. They looked for a young teacher who, I had about twelve other young\nteachers with me and it was in Budapest, it was just a day camp, and it turned out to be such\na good experience that the local Communist Party secretary asked me if I would like to come\nand teach in the district. And I said, \u201cNaturally, this is it!\u201d And so I was transferred to, just\nto a suburb of Budapest and I taught there until the Revolution came and I escaped again.",
        "A: '53.",
        "A: Yeah, the Revolution came in '56, okay, so. . .",
        "A: Yeah, right. One year in the countryside and two years in this suburb. Junior high.",
        "A: During the Revolution, they asked me to organize a Democratic Teacher's Union. I was not\na Party member, they knew that I was not also an anti-Party member either because, and this\nI wanted to bring out and emphasize, that as a Jew in Hungary, you could never be truly an\nanti-communist because you knew one thing, as long as the Communist Party was in power,\nthere would be no pogroms and your life is safe. And this is what happened after\ncommunism, and communist fall, most of my relatives and friends who were in Hungary,\nthis was their greatest fear, that what will happen to them now. And anti-Semitism is now\nrampant in Eastern Europe, in Hungary, too. So this is just an interlude, I just wanted to say\nsomething about that. So I was just teaching in this suburb and until the Revolution and as a,\nand during the Revolution, they sent for me and they wanted me to get the Democratic\nTeachers Union together, various democratic organizations, and all this. And I came out to a\ncouple of briefings with people, with the local council, the town council, the district council\nand one day there was some fighting out there and I saw a bunch of people with armbands,\nthe Arrow Cross armbands. And I looked out the window and all my desire to ever do\nanything or to stay there, just went away. Right in that moment. I realized that this is now\nwhen I have to leave. Even though I had a very good life, the last three years, after I was\ntransferred to Budapest, I had a very, very good life, relatively speaking, you know? A good\nsalary, I started to write for the newspaper, the... stories about young people. I ran camps\nand financially, and I got all the recognition and awards and all this, I couldn't complain. But\nwhen I saw, when I saw that, the symbol, I went home and I said, \u201cThis 1s it. I will never\nreturn except to visit.\u201d\u201d And I told my parents, \u201cIn two weeks, I'm leaving.\u201d",
        "A: Well, when I was transferred to Budapest, immediately I started to teach geography, they\nhad these so-called pioneer houses, these were buildings where the kids can come back in the\nafternoon and depending on their interests, join groups, study groups. And I was running the\ngeography group which was a lot of introduction and simulations of how a river is\nmeandering and then old river is meandering, a lot of tests, hands-on type of activities. I\ntook them to hike and I taught them how, orientation in nature and all, everything that was\nromantic in the boy scouts. And from this, I kind of organized a group of very enthusiastic\nkids who eventually would follow me anywhere, you know, and it appealed to me as a\nyoung, and I can still do that, and so then people saw this and they hired me to run big\ncamps. But I always neglected the political thing, that was not, I never really cared for the\npolitics, but I emphasized the romantic thing. I even wrote a book for the Pioneer movement\nand suggested a completely new uniform and emblems and all this, what kids love at that\nage, because the Pioneer uniform is the most, was the most impractical thing a child can\nhave. A white shirt, can you imagine, with dark blue pants and a red kerchief, I mean, and\nnothing on it, they were not, they couldn't have any emblem anything, so I said, \u201cNo, a child\nwants to see his or her achievements, right there, he or she wants to show it to the world.\u201d\nAnd so they were, they were giving me some free hand to do it and I did a lot of this,\nsubmitted it, it was accepted, so this is what I loved, that I could have some influence and\npush them away, mainly from politics, into romantic activities, you know, and that is the one,\nthat is, I think that pleased me a great deal. And eventually, it was a, I did it until the very\nlast day, until I left Hungary, and I still corresponded with many of my kids who were in my\ngroup as adults. And when I went back later on, ten years or fifteen years later, some of\nthese kids were running the same kind of camps and organizations and they always came and\nthey said, \u201cYou know, if you had told us that in the middle of the night we have to leave our\nhomes so that nobody will wake up and assemble in a place, we would have been up there.\nAnd we would have been following you all the way out to the border.\u201d I didn't tell them that\nI was leaving because I didn't want them to even have this silly idea, but after I left some of\nthem learned about it and three of them came after me and ended up in Switzerland, but\neventually went back to Hungary. So occasionally, when I am in Hungary, I do bump into\nthem and I go out and look up some, and those who were very nice to me, I always see. I\neven see the Communist Party secretary, the woman who was influential to get me, I took\nmy wife, too, to see her during the late \u201870s and early \u201880s, she and her husband, I just, they\nwere good people. They came from the old communist underground, you know? And\nthough we never talked about it, I'm sure they were just as disappointed in what happened to\nMarx ideas as most other people. But they would never discuss it because they were too\nloyal to the Party.",
        "A: Yeah. I was on the street all the time because I believed that I have this, anybody, most\nHolocaust survivors have an intuition, have a, somehow, a sixth sense and we always wanted\nto read the crowd. The mood of the crowd. And so I was in the street all the time, watching\nwhat's happening, kind of sensing the undercurrent. I was like an animal and I knew that I\nknew exactly what was going on. And I knew that these people eventually could be up to no\ngood or quite a few of them could be up to no good because, you know, the leopard doesn't\nlose its spots and even though it all started with great democratic slogans, eventually after\ntwo weeks, it did disintegrate and there were a lot of fascist groups and I did not want to live\nunder Russian tanks, but I was glad, myself, that the Russian tanks came back. I just didn't\nwant to live under that system either, but at least it saved the lives of a lot of people because\nthere were ugly incidents. The Revolution started for two weeks, the first one week was\nkind of democratic and looked like democratic and the second week, just everything\ndisintegrated and the crowd went berserk and I didn't trust any of that any more.",
        "A: Well, unfortunately, after looking at all the countries where anti-Semitism is so rampant, has\nbeen and still 1s, I must conclude that all Catholic countries are that way in Eastern Europe,\nonly the Catholic countries. Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia, these are the countries\nwhere, and some of them have very little Jews, in Poland there are only a few thousand Jews\nleft. I have experienced anti-Semitism all the time, [coughs] excuse me, and even when I go\nhome nowadays to visit, well I haven't been to Hungary for the last three years, but the letters\nI receive from my relatives constantly refer to that and my family was never very much\ninterested in bringing this out because they are, rather, they consider themselves Hungarians,\nthe ones who are living in Hungary today and I'm always surprised that this is a main\nconcern to them, so apparently this situation has never changed. In 1919, Hungary became\nthe first fascist country of Europe, even before Hitler, and stayed that way, at least, even\ntoday under the current, the undercurrent is very anti-Semitic, the Jews are responsible for\neverything just like in the Middle Ages.",
        "A: Well, the Revolution was defeated in the first week of November and it took me about ten to\nfourteen days to get going. I just wanted to say goodbye to my good friends and my family\nand also I had a cousin who wanted to come with me and I had to do a little preparation\nthere, too, because he was just a high school graduate and a very green fellow at that. And\neventually he brought his friend, so the three of us started out and in about ten, ten to\nfourteen days, I can't remember exactly, but no more than two weeks. I just wanted to see\nexactly what works, what doesn't work, how can I approach the border, the most practical\nway, a lot of people were practically there and then captured and brought back to Budapest.\nAnd the repercussion was nothing but still, you didn't want to go through all this and then in\nthe last second, just before you would go over to Austria, captured, you know, be captured,\nso I kind of did a little homework, that's all, and tried to think of the practical aspects of how\nto do that.\nEnd of Tape 7, Side B\nTape 8, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I... basically, I want as little to do with Hungary as possible, and Hungary\nusually come up in my dreams, in a nightmare.",
        "A: Yes. I... obviously I\u2019m not that devoted to Hungary. I\u2019m not a person who really believes\nmuch in national identity, you know, I just... I feel that cause more problems, that and\nreligion, than anything else, so I\u2019ve never been a patriot of basically any country, and\nthere... I still am not. So, does it sound all right? Yeah, an eye on there. All those\ncountries, so they wouldn\u2019t turn Fascist.",
        "A: Okay, yeah.",
        "A: This was probably off the record.",
        "A: You don\u2019t want to... although I can, you know, I can...",
        "A: I\u2019m willing to say this on tape, too.",
        "A: Doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well...",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t mind visiting Hungary, but... and the reason I don\u2019t mind visiting, because\nI still have friends and some relatives I care to see and I care to be with. But, on the\nwhole, when I am there, I feel like a total stranger, which is not... which is not just\nbecause of what happened to me, it\u2019s also a tremendous generation gap. Most of the\npeople of my age, are... [dog barks] probably you have to stop that.",
        "A: Yes, that I... as I mentioned, I like to be with people, but the feeling of totally estranged, I\nrealize is not just what happened... because of what happened to me, but also because I\nam now a... I... reaching the age when most people are just not around any more. And I...\nit\u2019s a strange thing to walk through streets where you used to play, and you know that\nnobody is there any more from your previous life. However, when I hear some anti-\nSemitic remarks, which you can hear often in Hungary, even today, or I see some very\nrude behavior, then I realize that I am very lucky not to be here, yeah. So... and I have\nnever been a patriot of Hungary. I\u2019ve never had a Hungarian passport in my life. I\u2019ve\nalways been really, stamped. Every document I ever had in Hungary, had a big... a ZS on\nit, which meant I was a Jew. So, since I was never a first class citizen, not even a second\nclass, no citizen at all, I just don\u2019t have any attachment to the country, as such. I do have\nattachment to certain places where I grew up.",
        "A: Oh yes, I became an American citizen in 1961, and so I always kid people who ask me,\nwhen they hear my accent, what happened to me, how come a foreigner is teaching\nAmerican government? Some of my students question me and I said, \u201cWell, I have been\nan American much longer than you, and your parents.\u201d And so...",
        "A: Oh, definitely. I must be honest and say that I do not have nationalistic feelings, as most\npeople would have. The flag or a national anthem doesn\u2019t really mean much to me. I\ndon\u2019t consider that patriotism. But I like a lot of things here, especially the constitution,\nand I appreciate the fact that I can live a free life and for them I am very grateful and my\npatriotism manifests itself this way, and not by waving the flag.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, because I couldn\u2019t... I couldn\u2019t read it, I didn\u2019t speak English, and in\nHungary, they were not very eager to translate the American Constitution as I was\ngrowing up. But when I came here, and I began to learn English and eventually when I\nwent back to school, and was a history major, I had to... so, base... my first encounter\nwith the Constitution was in college, in Fresno.\n?",
        "A: Oh I thought that it was a tremendous document, naturally, and I still admire the people\nwho wrote it. I consider them geniuses, creating something from nothing, truly, and I\nwish that we had some of that caliber walking around today in Washington.",
        "A: Yes, because I never in my life held any kind of citizenship or any kind of passport. And\nthe fact that now I have something that will... unfortunately, that in the 20\" century, the\nfact that you are a human being, with two eyes and a nose and everything else on you, 1s\nnot sufficient proof for you to travel around the world and be protected by international\nlaw. Considering all this, I felt much safer now that I have a country behind me and I am\nprotected in case I am in trouble somewhere. Yes, it meant a great deal, because those\ndays, I liked to travel a lot, and it was a sense of security that I had from it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, since I came from a Communist country, and before that a Fascist country, initially\nthe U.S. was never painted as a paradise. Never even painted as any country that is\ndesirable to live in. All I heard about it was negative. However, I was raised in a family,\nmy father was a very enlightened man, and he raised me on the truth, so I knew that this\nis the country of the free. And I had no qualms about this. The thing that bothered me a\ngreat deal about coming here, and also I, as I mentioned before, I did not come here... this\nwas not my first choice, you know, I had to follow my cousin. What bothered me, I\nhave... I was never that much in favor of modern times and fast times, and a landscape\nwith skyscrapers, that was not my vision of my future life. I was a typical European, who\nfelt a lot more comfortable in... on a narrow street with half-timbered houses, and a lot of\npeople on the street, and sidewalk caf\u00e9s, and little restaurants. Then to go to a country\nwhere none of this would exist. So I had my reservations this way, emotionally. I had no\nqualms about the United States politically, but I was worried about how can I adjust to a\nplace that doesn\u2019t have much traditions.",
        "A: Yes, yes, very much so. I still am very nostalgic when it comes to, for example\nChristmas. I consider our life here quite plastic and I understand why. I am not faulting\nanyone for it. I know that a country that is so young as the United State, just never had\nthe opportunity to develop those traditions that European countries have, that existed now\nfor thousands of years. And so... But it is just sad. I feel that a great deal of problems\ncome from the fact that we are so young, and we grew too quickly, almost like a teenager\nwho just became totally uncoordinated.",
        "A: Well, in the war, we listened, as long as he was around, and we had an opportunity, we\nlistened to London, to the BBC, it was... and occasionally, I think, but I am not so sure,\neven the Voice of America could be heard. And, of course there, we heard a great deal\nabout the western... so-called western world. And realized that while we are living there\nas practical slaves, in the western world, people have a very good life. And that appealed\nto me a great deal.",
        "A: I think it was no more than two weeks. It was just a screening process to just give a very\nsuperficial screening, so certain elements, undesirable elements would not sneak into the\ncountry. They were looking for members of the Communist Party and unfortunately,\npeople who were sick, because with certain illnesses, you could not gain entrance to the\nUnited States. For example, if you had TB. And then, from there... and also, they were in\ncharge of sending you somewhere. So, they were kind of dispatchers.",
        "A: Saint Louis.",
        "A: Yeah, Saint Louis, Missouri.",
        "A: In Saint Louis... Saint Louis, Missouri, I was welcomed by the family, by that time,\nadopted, of course, just symbolically, my cousin, and we were united. They were a... you\nmight say upper-middle class American family with some problems and they thought that\ngetting two Hungarian refugees would probably mitigate their circumstances. And I was,\nwithin weeks, working for a wholesale jewelry company. I was just a stockboy. And,\nvery simple work, and that was my job. And on weekends, as long as my cousin was with\nme, of course, we were walking around and going to a movie, even though we couldn\u2019t\nunderstand much of it. But just planning, eventually, to be integrated into this society.\nAnd on weekdays we worked, we went home, we watched television. And the family\nwas... it was a very interesting situation, because the man was manic depressive and we\ncould never figure out what his moves would be next. The... his wife was a very darling\nwoman, and she was the one who tried to figure this out, that with two Hungarian\nrefugees, the situation might change. They had a mentally retarded son in an institution,\nwho came home on weekends and they had another son at home, a very brilliant young\nman, who was always creating something electrical, or mechanical, even. So, we had\ngood relationship with him, and I kept up with my host mother for a long time, and only\nwhen we left for Europe, that was the time when I lost contact and I don\u2019t know where\nshe is. I understand they got a divorce after. It was in... unbearable to live with somebody\nwho was so unpredictable.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, yes.",
        "A: Well, I realize that I was in a trap, because there was no way for me to go back to Europe,\neven if I wanted to, and be accepted by a... any country and get some legal status\nanywhere. The reason was, once you were placed in a country, you couldn\u2019t really do\nmuch about it any more. So I knew I had to make the best of my stay here, but I certainly\ndidn\u2019t want to stay in Saint Louis, because I was totally astonished at the prejudice in\nSaint Louis. Not just against Blacks, but also against just about anyone. I worked mainly,\nthis is my fate, with German, it was a German company basically, a German family,\nGerman workers and I heard enough of... you cannot name a group or a race around the\nworld about whom they were not talking during the day, always in very derogatory terms.\nAnd then I found out that Saint Louis was a very Germanic city at that time. You were\neither of German descent, or you were Black. And luckily, when I became very, very\nupset about this, my Black fellow workers, first by sign language, probably, and later on,\nas I learned my English, pidgin English back then, they invited me on weekends to be...\nto go around with them, because they said one cannot just sit at home. And they\nintroduced me to the Saint Louis that most people who were born there, probably,\nwouldn\u2019t know. I went to just about every nightclub, I heard just about every jazz band\nthat there existed those days, that came to Saint Louis. And many times, in a huge dance\nhall, I was the only white face. And of course, sometimes, I ran into almost trouble too,\nbecause of that.",
        "A: No, because most of those Germans were Jews, and... but that didn\u2019t prevent them from\nbeing prejudiced against me too, and they knew that they were... that I was Jewish. It was\njust a general thing in Saint Louis, to look down on anyone who js not an established\nperson. And I felt this, everywhere. I just... and the situation at home, where I was\nstaying with these people, was also not very happy. And that, I think, contributed to my\nthoughts that, how nice it would be to go to some other place.",
        "A: Yes, yes, that surprised me very, very much. In one of these weekend excursions, I was\nintroduced to a very charming college student, she was Black, and we started to date.\nAnd eventually, she explained to me that we cannot see each other any more, because her\nlife was in danger, and my life was in danger. And she said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand this\nnow, but twenty years from now you will understand. And as much as it hurts me, we\nhave to stop seeing each other.\u201d And that was my first great introduction to prejudice,\nreally, on a personal, you know, basis.",
        "A: No, I mean, you know, I came from a society that was tremendously prejudiced and I\nthought I am coming to a society that is much more different and much more positive\nabout these things. And it really surprised me that there was so much dislike and hatred,\nthat I knew could not be erased very soon.",
        "A: This was in 1957, and by 1957, June, I was gone. So I only lived there for five months or\nso. And I... my English was not good enough to read newspapers or even discuss\nanything political with people. I did watch television, because I felt that it was a good\nway to learn, and I got certain ideas, but I am not aware that I was... anyway I ever met,\nyou know, this kind of a problem in Saint Louis, no.",
        "A: Well, when you are... this is my great argument against bilingual education, that when\nyou have to, you learn everything. You can learn Chinese probably, just as well as you\nlearn English. No, for Europeans, English is an easy language to learn. Not so easy to\nwrite, but to learn, because it\u2019s... the grammar is much simpler than some European\nlanguages. I just put my mind to it, and I decided, if I am here, I might as well do it. I\ncould have gone to Cleveland, for example, and live my life as a Hungarian, but I wanted\nto be integrated into the society, and I love the English language, that\u2019s the truth. I think\nof all the languages, even though I admit that French is a very beautiful language to listen\nto, but I love the English language, I love... and this is why I love to read and I learned\njust by listening and my willpower, I think, helped me to get through. And among all the\npeople eventually I associated with, who arrived at the same time, I made the most\nprogress, because I just decided I don\u2019t want to belong to any Hungarian club and I don\u2019t\nwant anything to do with this. I really want to learn English.",
        "A: He saw a newspaper article about us, in the... I think it was the Saint Louis Post Dispatch.\nHe... Because we were the first ones, my cousin and I think the first Hungarian refugees.\nAnd he cut it out and misplaced it somewhere, and only a few month after, somehow th-\nthe article came up and he called us and he invited both of us to dinner, to his house. And\nby that time my cousin was gone, so I went and I met him and his family. He just wanted\nto socialize and talk about the days in Hungary. He came to... he had come to this country\nbefore I, right after World War II. And his wife was a former German psychiatrist, and\nthey had one son. And...",
        "A: Yes, yes...",
        "A: ... they were. And... but of course, this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. Interestingly, I\nlast... I lost contact with them in... sometimes in the sixties, and reestablished it last year\nwhen I went to Aspen. And Mrs. Chabay was there. The professor, Mr. Chabay, was\nalready dead, but she was there, visiting from Florida, where she lives in a retirement\nhome. And so I had a good chat with her about the good old days.",
        "A: Yes, they ask me a great deal about that, naturally. But they were also very much\ninterested in my... at... in my present experiences then, which were also not very good.\nSomething happened to me after I moved out of my original family, and established my\nindependence. For a couple of month, I lived with a Hungarian couple who rented a\nroom, because they needed some money, and they had a room with a separate entrance,\nso I rented that, and there I had a pretty bad experience, and so I was just ready to leave,\nanywhere, in the United States. And this is when they showed me a film of Aspen,\nColorado, where they had the summer home, and where he was a member of the music\nfestival staff, and said, \u201cYou are coming with us.\u201d",
        "A: Well, it was... I don\u2019t even know if anyone in the future would completely understand it,\nbut it was just a strange coincidence that my father\u2019s company\u2019s... every company in\nHungary had a Party secretary, they were in charge of practically life and death, what\nwas going on. And my father\u2019s Party secretary, a lady, was the mother of the person who\nrented the room. So, he and his wife immediately, when this came to the surface, they\nimmediately were afraid that I might report on them back to Hungary, which I had no\ninterest, I couldn\u2019t care less, except one day they... I heard a big argument and I realized\nthat they were arguing about abortion. The man wanted his wife to abort, she was\npregnant. They were very... social climbers, real social climbers, who were constantly\nadding up, every penny on a piece of paper, figuring out when and how they can move,\nthey can buy more furniture, they can buy this, they... a child was the last on their priority\nlist. And so I heard her cry, and all this, and a few days later I came home, and she was in\na pool of blood. She had done something to herself, and I found her, and it...\nEnd of Tape 8, Side A\nTape 8, Side B",
        "A: And so the young man knew now that I... we have a secret, and he was afraid that I would\nreport this back to his mother. And of course, I had absolutely nothing to do with his\nmother. Then, next, the mail from home stopped. I did not get any, any, any mail, which\nwas very strange, because I had an agreement with my parents that every week we shall\nwrite to each other. They received letters from me, desperate letters, what happened to\nyou? And nothing. This went on for weeks and weeks, until I went to a Party, and the\nwoman confidentially asked me to step aside, and told me that she was with them\nsomewhere, and they were a little bit tipsy, and they were saying that they are stopping\nall my mail and stuff it under their mattress. I left the place very quickly, I went home,\nlooked under their mattress, and I found all the letters, and confronted them with this, and\nI knew that I would have to move out, and that\u2019s exactly when this happened, that I was\ninvited and they said, \u201cOh, you come with us.\u201d",
        "A: Yes. I went to Aspen, and that was like going from a cave to paradise. Not only that it\nwas beautiful and now, I had always been a mountain man, but the people, I just loved\nthe people. That was way before Aspen was discovered and made into the rich man\u2019s\nMecca. It was now a... 1t was a great deal of Europeans... Americans from the 10th\nMountain Division that exist... that trained there during World War II, and many of its\nmembers came back and established Aspen. It was just a marvelous group of people.\nToday, of course, they are all dead, but their names are on streets, and the recreation\ncenters and parks. And it just... it was a little bit weird for me to return and see all my\nfriends names as street names and park names and all.",
        "A: What appealed to me is, number one, up on eight thousand feet, you need each other. The\nwinters are pretty harsh, and the summers were filled with tourists coming to the music\nfestival. You needed other people\u2019s help and you had to help others, too. There was just a\ncamaraderie there, a very open attitude that appealed to me a great deal. I was still young,\nand the fact that I could get a job where I... my hours were not so regimented, even then...\nthere, I felt so free. The pay was good in comparison to other, you know, kinds of other\nareas of the United States. There was so much color in the place. All kinds of people\ncoming and going. It was just a... for a newcomer, it was a marvelous, marvelous\nintroduction to American life. There were people there who were truly the most middle\nclass, rigid family. There were people who were a very relaxed family. All kinds, and\nthey were all... they all got along so well, that was a great surprise to me. I also loved the\nfact that a great deal of the town, the eastern part, was still in such primitive state back\nthen, that some miner shacks still had cooking utensils on the stove, just as they left them\nback at the turn of the century when the panic came and many of those miners went back\nto Italy and you... what is today Yugoslavia. So, there was a little bit of the old. Not\neverything was concrete and glass, and well, even today the town has preserved a few\nbuildings. I was very glad to see that not everything 1s rebuilt.",
        "A: Yes, yes, they were very much interested. These were the type of people, the locals and\nwell, most people worked in businesses that catered to tourists. And it was an asset if you\nhad an accent, and if you look like somebody who had an interesting past, because they...\nsometimes they hired me for a certain job just because I had a story. And yes, people\nwere constantly questioning you about this, and I couldn\u2019t care less, it... as a matter of\nfact, I enjoyed this kind of fifteen minutes in the sun. And so, I mean, in this respect, I\nhad no problem.",
        "A: Mm, mm, well no, not much. The only people with whom I could really communicate\nabout the war, and what happened in Europe, were the ones who were in the European\ntheater, and as I, as I mentioned before, many of the so-called 10\u00b0 Mountain Division\u2019s\nmembers settled there, and I loved to talk to them, because they were very much involved\nin the liberation of some of the European countries, so they knew where I came from. I\njust have to add one more thing to this, that interestingly, the reason I am so fond of\nAspen, even today, because I believe that my life in America was shaped by that two and\na half years I spent in Aspen. Almost every major friendship, almost every major contact\nI had, after I left Aspen, was based on something that happened to me in Aspen. Almost\nevery one of them. I still am very close, and my closest friends today, I say, in the U.S.\nare those who were with me in Aspen, and those who still are alive.",
        "A: When I arrived there, immediately, the next day, I started to wash dishes in a little caf\u00e9\nhouse called the Epicure. And I was there, I think, for no more than five days or so, when\na very nice looking Austrian gentleman stopped by and, who looked, I remember, who\nlooked exactly like the famous French actor, back then Fernandel, and said to me... he\nwatched me washing dishes and he said, \u201cOh, I am so and so, I am a friend of Mr.\nChabay.\u201d And that was the gentleman who brought me to Aspen. He said, \u201cAnd I would\nlike you to come over and see my shop.\u201d And he brought me over to his shop, he had a\nnice jewelry and gift shop, and it was... he was a watchmaker and that was his main\nprofession, but he also had a very, very nice place. And he asked me... we conversed in\nGerman, since he was Austrian and I spoke much better German than English and he\nsaid, \u201cHow do you like my shop?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat a nice, nice, cute place.\u201d He said,\n\u201cWould you like to work for me? I can give you this much,\u201d which was a lot more than\nwashing dishes. I said, \u201cBut how can you hire me? I don\u2019t speak English.\u201d He said, \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t ask you whether you speak English or not, I asked you whether you like my shop.\u201d\nAnd he said... And I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re hired.\u201d And that was the kind of\nattitude that prevailed in Aspen. Easy going, fun loving, a lot of kidding. So I worked for\nKurt Breznits, and I started to work for him, this was in 1957, about, I would say, July.\nAnd our friendship survived for forty-two years, because he\u2019s the one, he and his wife, in\ntheir eighties, I visited them last year. Now, I work there until late fall... early fall, excuse\nme. A young man came in around September, and by that time there weren\u2019t too many\npeople in Aspen, because it\u2019s a seasonal place. At least back then, the off season, you\ncould hardly see anybody in the street. At the end of September, people were leaving, the\nmusic festival was over, and the ski season came around in December. So everybody left,\nvacation, travel. A young man came in and started to talk to me. He said, \u201cI got a\nproblem, my mother has a birthday and I have to get something for her.\u201d I said, \u201cLook,\nthat\u2019s not... shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d In my broken English I said that, and he looked at\nme and he immediately said, \u201cWell, where are you from?\u201d And of course, the whole story\ncame about and I said, \u201cWell, why is it a problem to buy something for your mother?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cBecause she has everything.\u201d And this is how I met a then young man by the name\nof Sheldon Rich, who was the son of a Chicago banking family. And on his twenty-first\nbirthday he received a nightclub from his parents, called, The Limelite. He just kept\ncoming back and talking to me, and we just became really... friends. We\u2019d occasionally\ngo out at night and he would bring his date and I would bring a date, and had a very nice\nrelationship. And then he came back later on, and he said, \u201cI have to leave my place, and\nthere are three apartments in the nightclub. I just hate to leave the place unattended.\nWould you mind moving into one of the apartments? You can just stay there, and when I\ncome back we can just share apartments, and no problem.\u201d Well, who\u2019d... who would\nrefuse a free apartment? I moved into the Limelite apartment, and when he came back in\nDecember to open it that year, he said to me, \u201cLook, I desperately need somebody that I\ncan trust, to be the cashier. How would you like to work for me?\u201d He said, \u201cI double your\nsalary.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I would do that, but I am very loyal to my boss, whom I love\ndearly and I just... I just can\u2019t leave.\u201d He said, \u201cOh, this is America. We don\u2019t have to\nworry about that. Ill take care of that, Pll talk to him.\u201d He said, \u201cYou know, Robert,\nhere, we don\u2019t even show up when we leave, we just call and say, send my check\nsomewhere.\u201d He says, \u201cThere\u2019s no loyalty here.\u201d I said, \u201cNo? You want me to be loyal to\nyou.\u201d The conversation went on and on and on and I said, \u201cWell, I just cannot go to my\nfriend, Kurt Breznits and say, \u2018I am leaving,\u2019 because you double my salary.\u201d But the\ntruth is, I needed money very badly to go back to school. That was my aim, that once I\nmastered the language, I would go back to school. So, by the... I went to work next day,\nand my boss and friend, Kurt Breznits was laughing and said, \u201cRobert, you don\u2019t have to\nhave these problems in this country. This is not Europe, and not only that, I would be\ndelighted if you can make twice as much money as you made here. I can\u2019t afford that\nsalary.\u201d But I said, \u201cBut we were such good friends.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, from now on, as\nlong as you\u2019re in Aspen, every Friday night, we will have dinner in my family home.\u201d\nSo... and we did that, just every Friday, I usually work late Fridays, so they had an early\ndinner, just so I can come. And we had dinner together and talked a great deal. And we\nsaw each other other nights too, but that problem was solved, but I could never\nunderstand this distance that is between employees and employers. I\u2019m still, even in my\nold days, as a high school teacher and all this, I would have been very hesitant to go and\nreport to somebody that I found a better place and I want to leave. I know it\u2019s silly, but it\nwas just pounded into me that you are loyal. And so I worked for the Limelite, which\nbecame a very well-known nightclub those days, with a lot of folk singers, as that was the\ntime when the Kingston Trio and all the others became famous and it was the... you\nknow, the great time of folk singing. Pete Seeger and all the rest, the... most of them\ncame to this nightclub. And eventually, from cashier, I was promoted and eventually I\nended up managing the place. And then my friend and boss, Sheldon Rich, became lucky,\nbecause his hated nightclub was sold. He could sell it to a group of folksingers who were\nsinging there, three, four people, and they formed a group called \u201cThe Limeliters,\u201d named\nafter the club, became famous, and now they could buy the club from him. So, he sold the\nclub, and I became the employee of the group, and... up until 1959, when I left. But I\nmaintained relations with one of the group, and his family. These are people who still\nvery much around today, you know, the four. And one of them, Glenn Yarbrough, who\nwas my friend, is still producing CD\u2019s.",
        "A: Yes, I knew that living in a tourist place, I knew that I would never have, probably, the\nmoney to go out on my own, because every year, buying a place, and setting up some\nkind of a business, was more and more expensive. As Aspen became more and more\nfashionable, everything became more expensive. Besides, I had no interest in opening a\nbusiness. I always thought of myself as an educator. I wanted to go back to school, and\nluckily, I got together with some adventuresome kids, and they told me about Alaska.\nThey said that in Alaska you can make a lot of money and it\u2019s fascinating, and it\u2019s\nbeautiful. And I loved to travel, so it was just a spur of a moment when I decided that at\nthe end of the season, around April, I would go and follow them to Alaska, and would try\nto make money, and then, eventually, that fall, I was going back to school in Fresno.",
        "A: Why Fresno? Yeah, people always ask me this question, because I\u2019m the most unlikely\nperson to end up in a central California town of practically no distinction. Hundred,\nhundred ten degrees heat. Why Fresno? Because they were the only ones, back those\ndays, who answered my letters... not giving me a scholarship, because I had trouble\ngetting my records together from Hungary. It was against the law, at that time, to send\nanything out, and I had to wait for my parents to find an opportunity to send it out with\nsomebody. And so, I just... a college had to accept me on my word, and apparently they\nwere afraid to do that. But Fresno said okay, you can come, spend a semester, we\u2019 ll find\nout how you function here, and then we will determine your status, based on that. And we\ncannot give you a scholarship, but we can assure you about the National Defense\nScholarship, which was given to people who eventually end up in education. And so I\napplied for that, and I got a National Defense loan, excuse me, not scholarship. That\u2019s\nwhat it was called back then. And I received that loan, and so eventually, after Alaska, I\nended... I ended up in Fresno. And of course, that was another eye opener, another piece\nof America that was very unknown to me. And it was a little bit of a crazy town, with...\nFresno is the center of the Armenian population in America. And they were... I hit it off\nwith them extremely well, no problem, until they found out that I am writing my master\nthesis on Turko-American relations in 1918-1920, and that was the time when the\nArmenians were persecuted terribly. And of course, no nation is all bad, no nation 1s all\ngood. And of course, when they were reading a little bit of my thesis, they found out that\nI was very sympathetic to Kemal Ataturk. Of course, I condemned the method of getting\nrid of Armenians, but I was... I found some goodness. So we had some little differences,\nbut all in all, I liked the people in Fresno. I liked them. I had a lot of foreign, foreign\nstudents, colleagues in the college and it was probably easier for me to navigate there,\nthan if I had gone to a big institution, where I would have been just a strange fish. Here I\nhad a chance to talk to professors. It was just a very relaxed atmosphere.",
        "A: Uniformity.",
        "A: Well, I reported back, I remember to my relatives, and parents, I said, \u201cThis is not a\ncountry, this is a continent.\u201d I said, \u201cDon\u2019t think in terms of a country, this is a\ncontinent.\u201d It\u2019s... 1t will be that way for a long, long time, and I think it still is. When I\ntravel, in spite of the uniformity that modern age brings, you can still see that it is... it\u2019I\ntake a long time, and perhaps it shouldn\u2019t, perhaps this is the way it should be, that we\nstill have areas that... like you can open your eyes and realize that you are not in Chicago,\nor not in New York. And hope that they will keep it this way.\nrelationship grew, and was built, and whether... and what she knew about your past and\nwhat you talked... I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Why don\u2019t...",
        "A: No, that\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Yeah, well, the... when I arrived at the Bay Area, for me that was just incredible. I\npractically pinched myself every morning when I woke up and I saw the sun and looked\naround, and the scenery. I just couldn\u2019t believe that I was that lucky. I just couldn\u2019t find\nwords to describe it to my parents, the beauty of the area and the very uniqueness that the\nSan Francisco Bay Area had for me. And still, 1t holds just a fascination. It\u2019s almost like\nEurope in the United States, when I walked the streets of San Francisco. I lived in\nTiburon... Belvedere... no, Tiburon, I\u2019m sorry. I lived in Tiburon, Belvedere is just next\ndoor, which at that time was affordable for a bachelor schoolteacher like myself. Today,\nof course, 1t would be impossible. And I had a nice little apartment in a duplex,\noverlooking what they call Raccoon Straight. And these are small, little islands in the\nbay. The sailboats were going back and forth all day. Tourists, you know, boats, and it\nwas just a very, very picturesque environment. The type of people I associated with,\nmainly through school, through my job, were very pleasant. Most of them were very\nyoung, and we did a lot of things together. I also had plenty of opportunity, of course, to\ngo on my own. And those days, I just was a restless spirit. I had a tendency to walk down,\nfor example, at night, and see the streets... the lights of San Francisco, and just feel that\nthere is something going on in the city that I\u2019m not part of, and I just have to hop into my\ncar and go there. And I did that, and it was then fifteen minutes, twenty minutes, I was in\nthe city, going around. And so then, I was walking around and I was happy, and I did a\ncouple of things. And then I looked back and I saw the lights of Belvedere or Tiburon or\nSausalito, and I felt that there... something must be going on and I\u2019m not part of it, so I\nhopped in my car and went back. So I was just restlessly looking for that unknown beauty\nwhich really was just around me, all over. And I loved to hike up on Mount Tamalpais.\nMill Valley, all those communities were very unique to me, and I thought I would live\nmy life here, probably forever.",
        "A: 1961. And, as I mentioned previously, the only job I could get here was... teaching\nmentally retarded students, but I didn\u2019t mind, because I thought of the old Hungarian\nproverb that said for any... for something that you like, you would even let people chop\nwood on your back, and I strongly believe in this. And so, I just... I didn\u2019t really consider\nteaching these children a great deal different than teaching regular children. As a matter\nof fact, in certain aspects, in certain sense, 1t was even easier because they were so loyal\nand devoted to you. Naturally, there were some problems with emotionally disturbed\nkids, who were in this group, too. But basically, it was easy, because of their love and\ndevotion. And I stayed in it for ten years, and after ten years, I honestly said to myself,\nI\u2019m burned out, I have nothing more to give, and this is when I returned to regulating...\nteaching so-called normal children, if there is such thing. And my wife, yeah, I met my\nwife at a teacher\u2019s meeting, and our superiors, our administrators, were a rather strange\nbunch of people, who had sometimes very unreasonable requests, and it had nothing to\ndo with education, such as we should have two pairs of shoes in our drawers, so we\nwould never have dusty shoes. And saying this to people who had to go out in the\nplayground almost every hour, I mean it was strange. And they criticized the way we\ndressed or what we said, or we looked, and they didn\u2019t much do it to me, but to... because\nI was a man, and I was the only man on the faculty of the county, but mainly to women.\nAnd... so I met my wife and at that time she was married with three children. And she\nstruck me as a kind of a person who doesn\u2019t really want others to know much about her.\nAnd I found out later there was a reason for that. Then... and we just discussed things,\nand I in my mind said, \u201cOh, this lady\u2019s quite cold.\u201d That was my first impression. And\nnever bothered really much. But, our path crossed at these meetings, and eventually, she\nwas writing some kind of a publication for mentally retarded teachers, and she called me\nup, and...",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry. No, teachers of retarded students. And she called me up and she wanted my\nadvice in something, which I still maintain, even up today, it was just a device to strike\nof...\nEnd of Tape 8, Side B\nTape 9, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, and as I was saying, first, I was not really very impressed, because she was not\nvery warm. And then the relationship changed after her phone call, when she asked for\nsome help, because I thought if a woman is really cold and reserved, she wouldn\u2019t call\nme and ask for help. And so I called her back and we started to chat, and from there on,\noccasionally, we called each other. But we never talked about personal things, and so, the\nwhole thing kind of petered out. And then, later, a year or two years later, I was invited to\na party, and to one of our colleagues, and he said, \u201cOh, by the way, Jan got a divorce. She\nis divorced, and she looks good.\u201d And according to... excuse me... according to Jan, I\nsaid, \u201cWow,\u201d which I deny. I never said such thing. But anyway, this, or whatever I did,\nor said, they considered it some kind of a sign for me that I would like to see her. So they\ninvited her and kind of matched us together one evening, and we hit it off just night. And\nfrom there on, I began to see her more often, and eventually, we just decided that this was\na pretty serious relationship. But I was thirty-seven, thirty-six and a bachelor, and I just\nwas not going to get married without giving it some thought. So, I did what my previous\ngirlfriend did, and signed up for one year to go and teach for the Army in Germany. And\nI arrived there, and I spent a year in Germany, and that year convinced me that yes, that\nshe would be the right person for me, so I came home. And we got married on Mount\nTamalpais, on the top of Mount Tamalpais, the mountain I loved to hike around, and the\nmountain we both saw every day, coming and going to school.",
        "A: Five, six and eight.",
        "A: Interestingly, they were more interested then, than they are now. As little children, they\nkept asking me a lot, and these days, as adults, if we meet, maybe they fear they knew...\nthey heard everything. But I am surprised that my sons, who are writing all the time, just\nas a pastime, never really ask any questions. And they are around movies concerning the\nHolocaust and... back those days. But no. But back then yes, yes, and I told them quite a\nbit, and it was not really that much about the Holocaust. They were too little, and I didn\u2019t\nwant to, of course, cause nightmares, but it was mainly just life, what was life when I\ngrew up and what I... the things I did, and they were fascinated by my accent, and they\nbegged us to have another child, so he or she could have an accent. They thought that a\nbaby is going to be born with an accent. And they laughed at my mistakes that I made,\nbecause sometimes they were really funny. And inadvertently, I did say certain things\nthat just sounded very strange, and still are a saying in the family.",
        "A: Pardon me? Such as, I... for a long time, I thought that fungus 1s really fangus, and so\neverybody called fungus a fangus. Once I told them something about a lawyer, and I...\ninstead of lawyer, I kept saying liar. And they couldn\u2019t understand, and in the end they\nsaid, the difference is of no... when I learn, I said, \u201cGod, there is no difference, lawyers,\nliars, what\u2019s the difference?\u201d And so there were many cute episodes. Drift and draft, I\nremember I had trouble distinguishing that. \u201cClose the... close the door, because there is a\ndrift.\u201d And so ever since, everybody called it drift and not draft.",
        "A: Yes. There is no problem there. She really wanted to know everything and I told her\neverything. And she read a great deal. And, as a matter of fact, she 1s my police woman,\nbecause she doesn\u2019t allow me to watch anything concerning the Holocaust on television,\nbecause she says I have such nightmares that she doesn\u2019t want to wake me up and it\njust... too much trouble. But I was amazed that after we got married, how much time\nshe... and effort she spent, and energy in reading books on Jewish history, and then, of\ncourse, going into her favorite theme, cookbooks. She has Jewish cookbooks and she\nknows more about Jewish cooking and holidays, and... so today when somebody ask me\nabout some Jewish custom or holiday or something, I always refer them to her, because\nshe knows a lot more about it than I do. I just, because of my indifference to religion, I\njust never really give it too much thought, of learning much about holidays and the\nbackground, but she did. And of course, there was never any question about conversion,\nanything like this, because I myself, I was not practicing.",
        "A: Yes, and the reason was, by the time we got married, the person who probably wouldn\u2019t\nhave liked me, because he was a rabid anti-Semite, her father, was gone. Her mother was\na very tolerant person, but she was dead, too, by the time we got married. So, the only\nrelatives around that she had, was her brother and her sister, who are 20\"-Century human\nbeings, and they are very, very tolerant, and very progressive people.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes. By the time I arrived in the Bay Area, and even before that, as soon as I could\nunderstand and speak some English, I became involved in the social and political scene\nvery much. For example, I remember when I... even before I settled in the Bay Area, I\nwould come up for the weekend and would go down, just by myself, to North Beach, in\nSan Francisco, to the beatnik coffeehouses, and just listen, or converse sometimes with\npeople. I really enjoyed the beatnik era. I liked those people, they were very introspective\nand intelligent. There was kind of a subdued, refined attitude about them that I\nappreciated. Occasionally, when somebody played the piano, they were sipping the\ncoffee and philosophizing, just a great time, I think, for literature, poetry reading. They\nwere all part of the scene. That truly was an interesting chapter in my life, going to North\nBeach. Then, later on, of course, after we were married, after I came back from Europe,\nfrom my one-year stint with the Army, which was in 1966, that is when everything\nstarted, especially the Vietnam War flared up. And our family was very much involved in\nthat. We were going over to the city, and I remember making big signs. My wife joined\nthe Another Mother for Peace movement. We were demonstrating, and there was a very\ncute episode that happened to us. She usually sewed a lot for herself and for the children,\nand bought a very nice, flowery material to make a dress. And we went to a big\ndemonstration over in Berkeley, and had to make our own signs. And we were getting the\nsigns ready and all of a sudden, we look down on our youngest son, Kevin\u2019s sign, and\nwhat did we see? A beautiful flower, of some textile, and if we looked at it, then we\nrealized it was her dress material that she had bought. He was so fascinated by the\npattern, and he needed flowers, because that was the theme of the demonstration, you had\nto have flowers on your signs, that he didn\u2019t think twice, and he was cutting out the\nflowers from... what... we didn\u2019t know what to do about it, and then we decided just to\ntalk to him, that this was not really the proper thing to do, but he didn\u2019t get punished. So\nthat was Vietnam. My sister-in-law wrote to, for example, to Lyndon Johnson and told\nhim that she fears that he should not run again. And interestingly, about three days later,\nhe came out and he announced that he would not run. So that... we felt that the family can\ntake some credit for that decision. But, we, we tried to have our children go and learn a\nlot about the times where we lived in, because we realized that they were very exciting\ntimes, very unique times. And perhaps, I always thought later on in their lives, life will be\nmuch duller than it was back then. We also lived, by that time, in Inverness, in an area\nthat was in the center of all these cults, and rock bands and so the kids were exposed to\nall these people and spent sometimes days, just listening to their music, up in the hills. It\nhad advantages, it had disadvantages. The disadvantage in this respect was that, no matter\nwhat parents would say to their children, they always had a place to go and because these\nrock groups had open house, you could help yourself at the fridge, or whatever, eating, or\nno matter how young you were, you were also welcome to dip into the pot and smoke it.\nAnd so it was in a... in the sense, difficult. And many of our children in the area, were\nrunaways. They would occasionally run away because that was just the style.\nwere you relating to the culture at large, in terms of that kind of identity?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Now that is a very surprising question, because I never really thought about it,\nbut as you were asking me, I realize I didn\u2019t really think much about myself any more, as\na Holocaust survivor. I just thought much as a member of the scene, so to speak. I was\nmore involved in what is happening in America, and thought more about it day by day,\nthan to think too much, to give too much thought about the past. So, in this respect, it was\ngood, because one should not constantly be visited by ghosts. So I think it, it was a good\nthing for me, in this respect. And you know, I was part of the whole story then, and,\nrather, an American fighting to end the war, and bring justice to people who were\noppressed.",
        "A: Only... only it usually... 1t was provoked by watching some television story, or reading\nsomething in the newspaper. Otherwise, they were going away, they were becoming\ndistant.",
        "A: The... now, this is a very complex story. When we lived in Germany, which was from\n1974 to 1993, I would say most of the time, when there was a West Germany and East\nGermany, the Holocaust was not a big problem, mainly because the West Germans were\nbringing it into the open. It was not something hushed up under the rug. There were\ndiscussions about it in schools. I spoke about it to high school students, mainly. The\nwhole... the whole problem with the Holocaust and the way Germans would look at it,\nreally started after the Unification. Now, I must also say that there weren\u2019t too many\npeople who were alive in World War II, by this time. Because I was fifteen when the war\nended, and I am seventy now, almost. And so, most people are dead, who were in World\nWar II. Now of course, it doesn\u2019t mean that Fascism as such, is dead, or was even... was\ndead. Yes, I heard anti-Semitic remarks, and sometimes, when I felt that 1t was the proper\nthing to do, I responded, and sometimes when I looked at the person, and I realize it was\na primitive old idiot, there was no reason to say anything. It would have been totally\nsuperfluous to provoke anything, because it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference. I rather\nconcentrated on talking to people of the middle and the younger generation. And I found\nthat intellectually, at least, they understood what was the Holocaust. They were very\nashamed and sorry about it, and I felt no urge to drill in, with young people especially. I\nfelt that they were progressive enough. The younger German generation amazed me,\nbecause I think they are very progressive, and I think they see history in the right light.\nHow... all this changed after the unification, because you had now Eastern Germany\njoining. A country that was never taught proper history, where the Holocaust, oh well,\nonly West Germans were responsible for the Holocaust, because all the Nazis, according\nto East Germany, were in West Germany. So, those people had no background, and they\nhad... they were not prepared for this historical fact and they denied it. And this is why\nthe skinhead movement and all the neo-Fascist organizations, basically, come from, East\nGermany, even today. Add to this the usual reasons for Fascism and anti-Semitism, a\nvery high unemployment and very bad economic conditions and the fact that unification\ndidn\u2019t bring immediate remedies to all their problems. So they had to again go back and\nblame the old scapegoat, the Jews, in spite of the fact that there aren\u2019t too many. So,\nsince they couldn\u2019t attack many who are living among them, they went back to the past.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh, I think that everybody basically felt the same, that we lived truly in a moment of\nhistory that is... has just very, very few companions. That it was something extraordinary.\nAnd now, just a couple of years before, nobody would have thought that in our lifetime,\nsomething like this will happen. But of course, after the Soviet regime collapsed, then,\nthen, it was inevitable. It still, it was a surprise, and it was naturally something that will\nalways be in my mind, because just a few weeks before, my granddaughter, who was\nabout fifteen at that time, came to Europe and we went to the Wall in Berlin, and we had\npictures of her just standing by, and I was telling her that you can bring back your\nchildren here, probably, and maybe even your grandchildren one day, and the Wall will\nstill be here. And so, no, nobody anticipated such a rapid disintegration.",
        "A: Yes, the... my granddaughter who is twenty-four... I\u2019m sorry, twenty-four? No, no,\ntwenty-two, I talk to her, she knows quite a bit about the Holocaust. And we usually go\ntogether to movies, not necessarily related to the Holocaust but sometimes do, like, we\nsaw, \u201cLife is Beautiful\u201d together, and I make a point to take her to movies that deal with\nhistory... modern history, or the Holocaust, so we can talk about it. I want her to know\neverything. The, the... I have two grandsons and I took them too, to the Holocaust\nMuseum. And they are at the... they were at the age, they went through too fast for my\ntaste, but I hope one day they will go back and they will slow down. And the other...\ngrandchildren, or potential grandchildren, are still too young to say anything.\nstudents?",
        "A: Yes, I was teaching a regular American high school, where The American Army and the\nAmerican diplomat\u2019s kids would go. Just like any other high school. We had a... that was\na school district, just like an American school district. It was funded by the same way,\nand operated the same way and everything was the same, only the scene was Frankfurt,\nGermany.",
        "A: No, no, I did not have any. I had some German friends and we talked about the\nHolocaust, and they knew about me, but it... we never really made it into a big deal, and I\nnever really wanted to make it a big deal, I didn\u2019t want them to think that I solely exist\nand maintain the friendship to kind of pound in the subject. They knew about me, they\nknew about my life, and we discussed it in... on very civil terms, and I knew that they\nwere genuinely interested and sorry for what happened. But, other than that, no, no, I did\nnot have any other... occasionally, my high school teacher friend, the German couple,\nthey invited me to their schools, to talk. And Germans amazed me because, in our house,\nfor example, there was a lady who was a farmer\u2019s daughter, and she was in a... kind of a\nmid-level managerial job with a pharmaceutical company and she had constantly friends\nfrom Israel, and she was not Jewish. I had another... I have another very old friend in\nGermany, I met back in the early 1960\u2019s, and we have been friends ever since, and she\nhas friends constantly visiting her from Israel. She\u2019s also not Jewish. So, there\u2019s a lot of\ncontact between Israel and Germany, and well, I don\u2019t know whether this is a result of\na... of a bad conscience or something, but certainly you cannot hold somebody who was\nnot even alive at that time responsible for anything that happened. No, that would be\nunreasonable. But it\u2019s not... today, it\u2019s not a big issue. It is a sad fact of history,\nespecially in the western part of Germany.",
        "A: Oh, I could have stayed in Germany, by the sheer coincidence of my name, which is a\nGerman name and the fact that I was, for a few month, a German citizen, in World War\nII. And that was just for a few months, so I didn\u2019t include in any citizenship, just by a\nmistake and because of the strange happenings of the times. They classified me as\nGerman in Hungary, and temporarily we were considered Germans, and of course the\nwhole thing was... oh, they only lasted for a few month when they found out who we\nwere. But that little episode and my name, and the fact that the reason the Hungarians\ntossed us out, besides being Jewish, they discovered that one of my great-grandparents\nwas born in what is called Sudetenland, which was a part of German speaking\nCzechoslovakia, which was at that time, the Austro-Hungarian empire, and all back, it all\nconnects together, and it all added up to some very tragic events, because we were not\nconsidered Hungarians, and my grandfather was deported to Auschwitz, not because he\nwas Jewish, but because of they said he was a foreigner. He could not prove that his\ngrandfather was a Hungarian, which was not true. But because of this, and other reasons,\nI could have gotten German citizenship. I could have gotten, probably, a great deal of\nmoney that way, because of what happened to my family in World War II, and all this,\nbut I never had, for a second, a thought. I mean, how can I think about settling in\nGermany, and taking German citizenship? There are so many reasons why I shouldn\u2019t\nhave done this, right? Number one is an emotional thing, a rational thing to... that would\nbe a little bit too much for me to bear. Second 1s that I have an American family, and my\nwife was ready to return to the United States. There no way would she have stayed in\nEurope with me. So, I knew that this was temporary, and I enjoyed while it lasted.\nEnd of Tape 9, Side A\nTape 9, Side B",
        "A: I just want to say that I know that, for the purpose of the interview, you\u2019re interested in\nanti-Semitism and where did I run into the most, and I must say that the country where I\nran into the most anti-Semitic and Fascist remarks, and... is Austria. And I was amazed\nthat the... so many years after the war, I don\u2019t see a lot of changes. That here is a country\nthat, unlike Germany, was considered a victim of Fascism, which of course, it was not,\nand played this role very successfully. And today, it is just terrible. It\u2019s, the night wing\nelements are all over it. And you can go to any pub and just wait until they have a few\ndrinks, and there will be some talk about the good old days. So, no, I thought Germany\ndealt with the problem much, much better than Austria.",
        "A: Yes, yes, we came here straight from Frankfurt, Germany, we landed in Lexington. And\nby that time, we had a little home, because my brother and sister-in-law, who own\nBriarbrook Farm, had called us two years before, and asked us if we would like to buy a\nhome here for a very, very little money, and that sounded just like a good investment. My\nwife, of course, immediately knew it was going to be our home. I just considered maybe\njust an investment. We bought it, and then slowly, she worked on me to retire here.\nBecause I had no intention to come here. I wanted to be near a big city and I loved\nCalifornia. And she insisted that she did not want to go back to California, even though\nshe lived all her American life there, and so she won. Well, she followed me to Europe\nfor twenty years, and I thought it is proper to honor her wishes and whatever they were,\nbut basically, she wanted to be close to her sister and vice-versa, so we came here, and at\nleast we could be in driving distance, within a day, to our daughter in Virginia and to our\nson and her... and his family in Nashville. So, that was an... also another consideration.",
        "A: Well, we used to visit here, almost every summer when... while we were in Europe, every\nsecond summer or so, we would come back and stop here, too, for a few days. And so I\ncould... I was always very defiant when it came to this place, I just... I never really\nopened my eyes as to what is here, rather would sulk so... not in a very obvious way, but\ncall it an inside sulker. That\u2019s what I was, sitting on the couch during the day, and\noccasionally complaining that there is really not much to do here. And this was going on,\nI was... I never really came here with great enthusiasm. As I put it to my wife, an area\nthat doesn\u2019t even have sidewalks in town, to walk around, what am I going to do there?\nAnd also the fences bothered me, that you can\u2019t go anywhere, everything is fenced in.\nAnd how can you take your mountain bike and, and bike somewhere? You run into a\nfence within minutes. And I was just not very much for settling here. And then, I knew\nthat she was very insistent, and the last time we were visiting here, I think it was in \u201991,\nthat was shortly after we bought that little house... people were still living in it, the\npartners of the farm, and I was walking around, and all of a sudden, the... my past caught\nup with me, because I spent a great deal, as a young kid, out in nature, and I loved the\nsmells and the... I loved the sight of a tree, the smell of the grass. And all of a sudden, I\nbegan to smell and look at the very things that were so dear to me when I was little and I\nwas constantly hiking with my friends. And I realized that this is not a bad place, and\nbesides, 1t was so peaceful. At night there was no noise. And so I came back and the\nwhole family was around because they were... we were celebrating our wedding\nanniversary. And I said, \u201cI want to say something to you.\u201d I said, \u201cI just made up my\nmind, I can live here very well.\u201d And that was the end. All my sulking went away, all my\nreservations went away. I knew I was not going to come to the middle of New York City.\nI knew that there 1s not going to be any half-timbered houses when I walk into Paris. But\nI thought that I can make the best of it, and that I can live here.",
        "A: Yes, that was my main concern. I knew that this is a beautiful state and if I drive an hour\nfrom here, I can start hiking and it is really an... an open range, but culturally, I had\nreservations and I still have reservations. I feel a little... I would have really felt much\nworse, perhaps twenty, thirty years ago, but at the time when television brings you,\nespecially the educational channel and the history channel and Discovery and there are so\nmany channels now that you can get, that brings... they bring a lot of good\nknowledgeable stuff, and this is one thing. Second, of course, the internet connects you\nwith the world. So, one is not so isolated any more. Still, I am still yearning to go to a\ntown where the streets are crowded. I don\u2019t want to live on a crowded street all the time,\nbut sometimes, and I want to go to a sidewalk caf\u00e9, and I want to eat some different food\nthat doesn\u2019t taste the same, and just converse with people. I feel that there is, right now in\nthis country, there is great suspicion. You just can\u2019t walk up to people and start talking.\nAnd Kentucky is even better off in this respect than any other state, probably, or most\nother states. It just... there is always that suspicion in a person\u2019s mind, based on all the\nstories that we hear day by day by day by day, of violence. Violence really kind of\npoisoned the atmosphere in this country a great deal, and I\u2019m very sensitive to that. So, I\nwould love to just go to a park and sit on a bench sometimes, and just talk to strangers, as\nI used to when I was younger. But that\u2019s impossible. We don\u2019t go to the park to begin\nwith, because there are no... not many parks, and there aren\u2019t... not too many people, if\nyou find a park. And when it gets dark, of course, you clear out, and you just don\u2019t have\nthat kind of a life, that vibrant life that you find still in European cities.",
        "A: Well, with neighbors, I just don\u2019t have that much with... in common. One neighbor next\nto our farm is a hog farmer, and I don\u2019t know anything about hogs and he doesn\u2019t seem to\nbe interested in many other things. And the others are way down. I go to Paris to take\ncare of some business that is necessary, post office or shopping, and this and that. And\nmy hobbies... one of my hobbies is antiques, so I know the people who are in the antique\nbusiness in Paris, and I can go in and spend some time and talk to them. But I do not have\na close friend. Now my... however, my association with the so-called master gardeners\nassociation in Lexington brought me together with people. I do volunteer work for the\narboretum in season, every week, and so... one day, and these are the people, usually, that\nI am the closest to, because we have a common interest, gardening. We spend time\ntogether, we have meetings. And after the season is over, we continue seeing each other.\nSo, yes, but since I came back... and that has also something to do, of course, with my\nage, too... I have not found here, anyone that I can call a friend.",
        "A: Yeah, people are funny in this respect. They are interested my accent, and I cannot really\nsay that they are suspicious or they reject me. One man, a young man told me this last\nyear. Said, \u201cYou know, you are much better off than I.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou open your\nmouth, and everybody says, \u201cOh, what a nice accent, where are you from?\u2019\u201d And he said,\n\u201cT open my mouth and they say, \u2018Hey, you are not from here, are you?\u2019 And you know\nwhat they mean,\u201d he says, \u201cthat I\u2019m a damn Yankee.\u201d And I don\u2019t know about this, but\nall I can say is that nobody has ever reacted negatively toward my accent. I see that\nsometimes people smile when I talk to them, and I know why they do it and I consider it\na friendly gesture. And that\u2019s about it. The only people I\u2019m really mad at, the ones who\nlisten to me for awhile and say, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Because I know that they are putting me\non. That... if schoolchildren could understand me, they could, too. But... and another\nthing that, of course irritates me, when... my hearing is not that good any more, and this\nhas nothing to do with accent and all this, it\u2019s just that some people are very intolerant,\nand if you ask, you know, \u201cWill you please repeat it?\u201d They just say, \u201cForget it.\u201d And the\nword forget it really irritates me. But that has nothing to do with accent and being foreign\nborn. Otherwise, I find that people are much friendlier, even with my reservations about\nbeing suspicious, much friendlier than they were in some other states that I\u2019ve travelled.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t do it any more, and frankly, I can\u2019t even come up with a good reason why.\nPerhaps it\u2019s just that I get very busy at home, and the... somehow, the familiar faces that I\nknew, many of them left and I... it\u2019s very difficult, I think, after a certain age, to make\nfriends and to build kind of a circle around yourself. And also when I first joined, the\nHistorical Society was a lot more vital than it is now. I think it just settled into a routine\nlife, and it just... I was just not interested any more. The museum was established, it\u2019s\nrunning smoothly. I don\u2019t think they really need me there any more. So I rather\nconcentrate on the Master Gardener\u2019s Association, where I can do something, actually\nwork. I am always much happier when I can do physical work, than when I just sit\naround and talk about what to do.",
        "A: I... well, not strictly speaking Kentucky history, but I did take my first class, last year, in\nthe history of Cincinnati. Cincinnati fascinated me from the very beginning, because\nwhen I saw it, I said, this 1s the closest thing, around here, to a real city. The others seem\nlike villages, all of them. I can\u2019t think of any place in Kentucky, that to me, looks like an\nurban environment. And the... most of the places are, you know, just built very quickly\nand the original downtown... unfortunately, Lexington is destroyed, as we know it, and\nwhat is left of it is just struggling. Now, yeah, Cincinnati, yes. I was so interested in\nCincinnati, and Cincinnati\u2019s history, that I took a class, a whole week Elder Hostel class.\nI like to take classes with Elder Hostel, and it\u2019s usually a hands-on class, but this time I\nmade an exception, \u2018cause I wanted to know the history, background, and more about the\narea. And it was not just Cincinnati, 1t was northern Kentucky, too. It was very good. So\nI\u2019m hoping to do some more. And of course, here and there I read a book about\nKentucky. I take some authors who are local and look into their works, and David Dick\nlives in the area, and his books... so, Iam. But I am not really an expert on Kentucky\nhistory, I leave this to people who are natives. I just have a kind of a... really a surface\ninterest in just the basics.",
        "A: Oh, I settled this already with myself. That\u2019s it. This is my last station. I am here for\ngood, and naturally, this is not a bad place to be, and even though I might... I could think\nof some other places where I would rather live, but I am here now, and I make the best of\nit. So...",
        "A: Yes. I wouldn\u2019t have chosen it, back thirty or forty years ago, no way. Because at that\ntime I still was more, somehow I felt that I... that there was still a great deal to discover.\nAnd I know that, now that I reached the age, and considering the fact that I have heart\nproblems, that I can\u2019t just jump around any more. And even though I would love to visit\nsome other corners of the world, and our country, I have to take it easy, and this is\nbasically a very good point to be. I really like to explore more of the eastern part of the\nUnited States. That\u2019s a very good place to be, and the fact that we lead here, otherwise in\nkind of a Norman Rockwell type life, with my brother and sister-in-law, that here... we\nhave been here for six years... almost six years now, and we never had a conflict, not\neven a minor one. We eat our meals together quite a bit. We go, usually together to the\ntheater or a party or something. We do a lot of things together. We are... they are our\ncompanions, and we are theirs. And so I... considering all this, I am very happy, and at\npeace.",
        "A: No, no. I have never heard anything like this. I think there are so many... so few Jews\nhere. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean anything, there are very few Jews left in Poland, and\nthere\u2019s still anti-Semitism, but no.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh that, that is... I do this with great pleasure, because I know that... in this area, there are\nvery few people, probably, who experienced the Holocaust, and even know what tt 1s.\nAnd so, one schoolteacher started this program in the local schools, and she always\ninvites me, about two, three times a year. And last time, it was a closed circuit television\nthat they put me on, with some other classes around Kentucky. And... but most of the\ntime, I just talk to her classes... her combined classes or some other teachers bring in\nclasses, and these are usually kids, thirteen, fourteen years old, and I like to talk to them,\nbecause that\u2019s how old I was when the real disaster hit me. And so I can kind of get down\nto their level of understanding and explain certain things to them. And I find that they are\nvery receptive, very receptive. So, I consider it a mission.",
        "A: Yes, Bourbon county school system. I\u2019ve never been to the Paris school system, but it\u2019s\nBourbon county, which 1s, just basically, geographically speaking, it\u2019s also in the city,\nthey just split, I don\u2019t know why. And so I talk to the Bourbon county schools. I spoke to\nthe high school last year, but mainly it\u2019s the middle school.",
        "A: The middle school students, because of the teacher\u2019s eagerness to clarify everything, are\nmuch better informed than the high school students. I was amazed. I went to the high\nschool, I... once I went to Berea and talked to the Berea class, and that was the worst.\nThey were just uninterested, sleepy people with a professor who, himself, put me asleep.\nI just couldn\u2019t blame the students, by that time, they were so turned off, that no matter\nwhat I did, I could have stripped nude, and it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference in\nthat class. But the middle-school kids, the junior high, they are just great to talk to. One\ngirl... just yesterday, I was speaking to a class, and one little girl stayed behind, and I\nusually spend about an hour and a half with them. I speak to them for awhile and then let\nthem ask questions. And one little girl was just stay... just stood behind and she was\nwaiting for me, waiting for me, when after everybody left, she came up, and she hugged\nme, and she kissed me, and she said, \u201cThis is all... for all the missed loves and kisses that\nyou could not get from your parents during those years.\u201d I thought that was just\ncharming. And she just turned around and left. It was... there was no other, you know,\nsecond thought about it. And so, it was just very, very beautiful.",
        "A: Yeah, I... that comes around a little bit more often, when the people just cannot\ncomprehend that, how can anybody who doesn\u2019t steal, doesn\u2019t cheat, doesn\u2019t embezzle,\nhas been married for thirty-three years, why am I not a church goer? And that is what I\nhave to explain many times to people. Not only that, when I say I\u2019m a non-believer, of\ncourse, I think I\u2019m out of their favors. And... but I try to make a point there, too, that one\ndoes not have to go to church and belong to a religion, to lead a decent life. And I say\nthat. I look around and see how many people who go to church are in the news, beating\ntheir wives and embezzling money from the school\u2019s treasury, or from the county\ntreasury or using highway funds for their own purposes. You don\u2019t have to go. You can\nset your own rules. So, I do more argument about that than anything else.",
        "A: Well, I tell them always. I\u2019m not making any . Lam... I always say,\nI\u2019m Jewish, but I am not a Jew... lam a Jew, but I\u2019m not Jewish. And of course, first,\nnobody understands what I\u2019m talking about. And I say, \u201cEthnically speaking, I am a Jew.\nI come from a ethnic group called the Semites and one of the subgroups are Jews.\u201d I said,\n\u201cNow these people have been mixed... intermingling with other people for over a\nthousand years, and therefore there is no such thing as a pure Jew, but then there\u2019s no\nsuch thing as a pure anything any more, since history mixed us up quite successfully.\nBut, when it comes to religion,\u201d I said, \u201ceven though I am a Jew, my religion is not\nJewish. I have no religion.\u201d I said, \u201cI am not... I do not belong to any organized religion.\u201d\nSo eventually I think they understand what I mean.",
        "A: Well, of course there are always those who feel that they can perhaps sway me over. And\nI always say, \u201cLook, I\u2019m seventy years old, and you have no idea how many people tried,\nand you are just wasting your time,\u201d I said. And so eventually, they see that they are. So\nthey give up and many of them still trust me and keeps talking to me, and there are those\nwho kind of shy away, because I might, you know, be who knows, the devil, or... you\nnever know what they think of you if you say I\u2019m a non-believer.\nTape 10, Side A",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t know anybody. And several times, my cardiologist, who is Jewish, and 1s\nvery active in one of the synagogues in Lexington, mentioned that the rabbi is going to\nget in touch with me, because he wants me to come and talk to some group within the\ncongregation, but they never contacted me. I really don\u2019t have any connection to any\nother group.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t mind. I\u2019m completely neutral. I am not going out of my way to look for it,\nand... because I don\u2019t like to dwell that much upon past. And... but I wouldn\u2019t reject if\nthey... if they would want to establish any contact with me.",
        "A: I consider this very similar to what was going on in Germany while we lived there.\nGermany had an economic boom in the 1950\u2019s, just like we have now, which meant that\nthe... all the menial and dirty jobs were unfilled. Most Germans just wouldn\u2019t want to\nwork in that, and also that they needed more workers than the country actually could\nproduce. So they invited in other nationalities as guest workers, that\u2019s what they were\ncalled, and they were mainly from Turkey. And this was back in the 50\u2019s. The German\neconomic miracle produced a migration from Turkey, which was legal, completely legal.\nThey had to have documents, they entered, they went to work in the factories. Now,\ntoday, in 1993... 1999, the economy... the German economy has slowed down\nconsiderably. These Turkish workers, the original Turkish workers, today are\ngrandparents. They brought their children back then, it was allowed, which was, I think, a\nvery nice, humanitarian gesture, because Switzerland, who had the same problem, did not\nallow family members to follow. They could go home on vacation, send the money back,\nbut nobody was allowed to... allowed to come. So, the family members came, and you\nknow, one family member then brings another family member, and pretty soon... I think\ntoday there are close to three million Turks living in Germany, a country of sixty-five\nmillion people. That\u2019s quite a bit, and of course, was tremendous resentment by some\npeople to begin with. But the real problem came not while the economic boom was on,\nthe real problem came when it was over, because now you had a lot of people who were\nalready adults, and born in Germany, to Turkish parents, and all the rest. So now, here\ncame the problem of what to do with them. Are they citizens, are they not citizens? And\nwelfare, are they qualified for welfare? So, I am afraid of the same thing here. Right now,\nespecially around here, in the Bluegrass, everybody who can think, knows that these\nillegal... or legal Mexican workers are fulfilling an important job. They are working here\nin a job that most other people wouldn\u2019t take. So, nobody has great reservations. When\nthey see... I heard that when they see something in the paper, that a thief was arrested, or\na murder happened, and it is a Spanish name, they do mumble about it, which is natural, I\ndon\u2019t consider this extraordinary. But my biggest fear is, what is going to happen when\nthis economic boom ends, and here we will be with these people. Now, they are not going\nto work. If they don\u2019t work, what will happen to them? To their mind? What will happen\nto those who watch around, and will take the opportunity to do the same as they do in\nGermany. The skinheads in Germany were burning down the buildings where they lived.\nPeople died in fire, they were beaten up on the street, or they were killed. Several, several\ntimes this happened. So, I hope that we'd... it doesn\u2019t come to this. I think that the... we\nneed more education, especially in the schools, to make these people welcome. They are\nhere for a reason, they are human beings, and just like anyone else in America, they came\nin by the same rights. If there is illegal immigration, that 1s not for Kentucky to try to stop\nit, because we can\u2019t, it has to be stopped down on the border, that\u2019s not our problem. But\nthose who are here, they are here. So what are you going to do? But the churches, the\nschools, any institution, I think should work together to make sure that people know that\nthese are human beings, these are not some alien group that is here only temporarily.\nThey are not here temporarily.",
        "A: Yeah, yes...",
        "A: ... yeah, oh, in this... in this respect, there is a comparison. I... definitely, that... they\nwould be made scapegoats, the minute the chips begin to fall. But I don\u2019t think that in\nAmerica we ever have a danger of the death camps or concentration camps any more. I\nknow that we had them, of course, on a much, much smaller and different scale, for the\nJapanese Americans in the West coast, but I don\u2019t think that would ever come to this. I\u2019m\nmore afraid of individual treatment of these people.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, and I would like to see that we deal in school, we deal with them\nrealistically, that we let their children come to school without any reservation, because\nchildren in the world everywhere, makes no difference where they come from, where\nthey go, they should be in school. And number two is that we do not go overboard with\nbilingual education. These kids know how to speak Spanish, they should know how to\nspeak English, and even the families, I think, would appreciate the fact, that we would\njust throw them into an English speaking class, and I can guarantee that in three months,\nthey would speak English, without even an accent.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Not for my wedding.",
        "A: Mm-mm, no.",
        "A: They came in 1967 to visit. They were here, I think, six weeks or seven weeks. And my\nmother, of course, would have loved to stay here. My father, he was just used to his life\nin Budapest, and he was very anxious, eventually, to get back. So there was no question\nthat they would stay here. And my father, who has always been around little businesses\nin his life, he did the usual thing that people at that time did, from Eastern Europe,\ntraveling to the West, they were constantly counting what... certain prices on\nmerchandise, it would cost in Hungary, in Hungarian money. I mean, I was thinking\nabout getting him a little calculator, but he was so fast in his head, he would beat any\ncalculator. So, his favorite place... and we lived in California when they were with us,\nwas Long\u2019s Drugstore, which is the equivalent of any big drugstore chain in our area.\nAnd he... he would just... if we did something, the rest of the family, with my mother, and\nhe did not want to be part of it, he just said, \u201cOh, just drop me at Long\u2019s Drugstore,\u201d and\nhe would spend an entire day at Long\u2019s Drugstore, looking... going around, looking\neverything, figuring out prices and this. So, yeah.",
        "A: ... the Long Drug... the employees began to get a bit suspicious, what is this man doing\nhere, and he was smiling always, because he couldn\u2019t speak a word of English. So,\nfinally, I had to... I explained, I talked to the people, and said, \u201cThis is my father, he\ndoesn\u2019t speak any English, and he loves your store.\u201d And this is all he did. We drop him\noff here, he\u2019s totally harmless. He never killed a fly in his life. He just likes to... and so\nthey laughed, and they just... and eventually they all kind of tried to communicate with\nhim and he with them. And another thing that... just blew his mind, that all you can eat\nlittle places in San Francisco. And we used to go to one that had very nice stuff, steam\ntable, of course. And he just could not understand that here, we were five, seven people\ngo, and of course, the kids kept going back and taking more and this and that, and so\nfinally he said, \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, \u201cin Hungary, a restaurant like this would go broke in\none day.\u201d So, my wife went to get the manager, and it... she was a very nice lady, and\nexplain to her where my father comes from and what these questions are, so she sat down\nwith us, and she said... \u201ccause my father said, \u201cHow do you make money, all you can\neat?\u201d So, she then pointed out to my father, that look, \u201cHere is your granddaughter. Look\nwhat she has. She really didn\u2019t take much. Look at your wife, she didn\u2019t eat that much.\nLook at you, you didn\u2019t eat that much. The two boys,\u201d she said, \u201cthe two boys, okay, so\nthey might take up... up to the price that they paid, but look, all of you, you\u2019re eat...\u201d and\nso, She was very patiently explaining. She said, \u201cOur problem is not what people eat, it\u2019s\nwhat people try to put into their jacket.\u201d She says, \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many people\ncome in here with a bag, and all this.\u201d My father could not understand this, that even in\nAmerica people... because he had, certainly, a very idealistic view of America. But I\nforgot to tell you that every time we picked him up from Long\u2019s Drugstore, he learned\nthis sentence to say. First he learn it in... he said it in Hungarian, then I taught him how to\nsay in English, so the children can understand. He says, \u201cThis country is invincible.\u201d\nAfter looking at the drugstore, he made up his mind, that based on this wealth that is in\nthis... just in this store, and the way people just come in and can afford and buy, all this...\nhe said, \u201cThis country, my son, is invincible.\u201d He had unlimited faith in this country. And\nI don\u2019t know whether in a previous interview I told you, when people ask him, \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you stay here?\u201d He told them a joke. I think I...",
        "A: ... L say it, so I\u2019m not going to repeat that, but he... he truly, he... with all the wealth, and\neverything else that just enchanted him, he... and the nice aesthetics of the stores, he was\nready to go home.",
        "A: My mother died in 1971, and my father died in, let\u2019s see, 1980.",
        "A: Oh, well, I was there when my father was dying, yeah. I was in Germany, so they called\nme and I come, and he had a stroke, and... but I was not with my mother when she was\ndying. My father just called me. So... but they have always been great supporters of the\nUnited States.",
        "A: Well, if you give me a couple of minutes...",
        "A: ... You can stop that, and see if there\u2019s anything else, okay?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, we are enthusiastic members of the Elder Hostel program. We have... my wife, I\nthink, participated in just about fifteen or so, and I am just about five behind. And what\nwe usually do, we are taking hands-on type classes. My idea is that I want to know\neverything before I go, about... a little about a lot of things, such as I have always\nwondered about blacksmithing. What does a blacksmith do? How does he do it? So I\ntook a class in blacksmithing. I took a class in kaleidoscope making, because that\ninterested me... me, too. How does a kaleidoscope work? How do you make one? And I\ntook several classes in wood turning, which I enjoy very much as a hobby. We also took\na beautiful class, which was not hands-on, but still something similar, to... in Hawaii, an\nElder Hostel class for two weeks. We were studying the volcanoes, the rainforest and\nthen Polynesian culture. My wife is very active in basket weaving. She\u2019s a member of the\nbasket weavers... Kentucky Basket Weavers Association, or whatever... I don\u2019t know if\nthis is the official name, but she participates, she exhibits sometimes. Also, she\u2019s a\nquilter, so as a quilter, she comes in contact with a lot of truly Kentuckians. And she\ndoesn\u2019t ever come home complaining that maybe they considered her an outsider. She\nfeels very much at home with all these people. We also go to West Virginia, to Cedar\nLake, which 1s also a - an Appalachian center for crafts, and take a hands-on class. Our\nnext class, hopefully, we are on the waiting list, we have taken a class in Charleston and\nwe want to go back, this is our next class. We studied outdoor cooking and we are going\nback now to study Charleston\u2019s gardens. We take trips.",
        "A: No, South Carolina, South Carolina, Charles... Charleston, South Carolina. And while\nthere, we visited Virginia, Savannah, and we were fascinated by Savannah, it was just\nwalking around in a European city. And in Kentucky, too, occasionally we take trips. We\nlove to go, as I mentioned, to Cincinnati. We go up to Louisville. My wife, as a quilter,\ngoes sometimes to western Kentucky, which is the quilter\u2019s place, you know, Paducah is\nthe quilter\u2019s museum. In other words, we are active here, and I took the class in History\nof Cincinnati, in northern Kentucky. And I plan to... oh, I belong to the Sierra Club, The\nNature Conservancy, a lot of conservationist organizations. I volunteered to participate in\nthe Kentucky water watch program, which I enjoyed very much. It just ended with the\nLicking River, and the branch here in Paris, Stoner Creek, was our responsibility. Four\ntimes a year we had to go down and take samples, and... so that was, I felt I was part of\nKentucky, doing this. We are... we try to stay active and my wife is mainly involved with\nthese quieter things, and I am... I like to get involved with something that takes me out in\nnature and puts me in a kayak, or out there, really fighting the elements. I still have a\nlittle bit of that spark. So, if I can manage, and if my heart gets better after the operation\nthis fall, I'd like to buy a canoe or a kayak, one of the two, and just go on these little\nrivers here. So...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. That\u2019s about it. I mean, I can\u2019t... can\u2019t really...\n"
