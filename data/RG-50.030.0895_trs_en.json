        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: All right?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, the first thing I remember, I was four years old, and I found myself in a\nplace, the snow was higher than I was. A lot of people crying, crying, tearing of the\nclothes, and a big commotion. And nobody pays attention to me. When we left, I\nsaid to somebody, where are we? What is this place? And they said, this is a\ncemetery, and we just buried your mother. I was four years old. I was told she died\nfrom a brain tumor, on the operating table. So my f\u2014 we get home, when I stay with\nmy grandmother, and my father moved in, and we were the three of us, because\nGrandpa died just before. And was a very difficult life, because my mother was so\nyoung, and my grandmother couldn\u2019t take the pain, and the sorrow, to lose a young\ndaughter like that. So, we covered by rel \u2014 Jewish religion, we cover the mirrors\nwhen someone dies, and we did cover it, and after 30 days you\u2019re supposed to take\nit off, but she never took it off. As my \u2014 as long as I remember, the mirrors were\ncovered. So, being that I had no one to take care of me, my Aunt Ella hired a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 26, 2016\ngoverness, whose name was Mimi. So Mimi took care of me since I was four years\nold, til right after the war. And we did everything together, schoolwork, fun work.\nShe taught me lots of etiquette; she felt it was very important. She taught me how to\nboil eggs warm water, in case. [indecipherable] in case of what? Everything is\ngood to know. Everything is good to know. I was ironing, I was washing, cause she\ndid tell me all these things. And I was very content, she was very, very good to me.\nAnd couldn\u2019t be happier, except the house where I lived with Grandma, it was a\nvery sad house. And I \u2014 the children didn\u2019t want to play with me, because I was\nalways sad. And \u2014 and this is how the years went by. And I went to school, and\nwhen in 1944, Mimi wanted to leave. And we didn\u2019t understand why Mimi wants\nto leave. And she said that in her home, there is a catastrophe, and she has to leave.\nDoesn\u2019t matter how much she loves me, she has to leave. So that was an indication\nthat some political change is going through. But of course the news was handled\nthrough the government, and fa \u2014 also the radio. There wasn\u2019t any television or\nanything, like today. So, in a quiet, buzzing way, we heard that the German army\ntook over Czechoslovakia, Romania, other parts of Hungary, Poland, France, all\nthe eastern European countries. And we heard this stuff, and it was very surprising,\nbecause we don\u2019t know this stuff, we don\u2019t know these things. Could I have a drink\nof water, please? [interruption]\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "Q: So you said you were \u2014 over the radio, and newspaper, you were hearing little\nbits and pieces about what was happening outside \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 the Germans, you know, their activity. And so you \u2014 and then you were about\nto tell us about your governess, Mimi, leaving.",
        "A: Mimi left, went back to Switzerland, and so it was my grandmother, and my\naunt didn\u2019t live with us, but my father remarried, three years before.",
        "Q: So, in 1941.",
        "A: Right. They married a very nice person, and they had the child together. Her\nname was Susan, Susan. They wanted me to live with them, and I wanted to live\nwith them, because I was tired of the old atmosphere, and the sadness, and the\ncovered mirrors, and all that. But my grandmother wouldn\u2019t allow it. She says,\nyou\u2019re my only contact to my daughter, and I\u2019m not letting you go.",
        "Q: So because you were your mother\u2019s only child, she wanted to keep you there.",
        "A: And she stated it with so much common sense, that nobody was arguing about it.\nSo I stayed with my grandmother, and contacted my stepsister once in a while. Very\n\u2014 you know, it \u2014 and then in three years they were together only \u2014 only three years,\nand then became 1944. And so that day, that big day came, when tanks, and military\nmachines, and guns, and unbelievable attack on every house. They just shoot. They\nAugust 26, 2016\nwere shooting without aiming. They just were shooting. And then a young man, a\nGerman fellow, soldier, came in yelling and yelling and pushing. Broke down the\nfront door, and he said, schnell, schnell, that means hurry, hurry. And I had what I\nhad on, not special clothes or anything. I just grab my pocketbook, and \u2014 and for \u2014\nfor 1-identification, and \u2014 and \u2014 and a little jacket, that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: And up until this point, had your life in Budapest been pretty normal?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Nothing had changed, there weren\u2019t any restrictions?",
        "A: No, no. Some thing \u2014 restrictions were in the schools. They didn\u2019t have religious\nclasses, so they combined the Christian classes with the Jewish classes. However,\nthey didn\u2019t make us to kne \u2014 knee down \u2014 kneel down, or any other things. So we\nsat in the back, and we just sat there. And our building had three flights. One \u2014 two\nstaircases. One was for the residents, and one was for the delivery and maintenance.\nAnd he keeps on pushing me, the soldier, and I\u2019m going to where I always go, to the\nresident s-staircase. And he starts to hit me with the \u2014 with the rifle back, and you\nlousy ge \u2014 Jew, you don\u2019t deserve to be on the \u2014 on that staircase. You go where the\ndelivery is, where \u2014 where the maintenance men are. And he was very upset. And I\nturned around, went over there, and he started to hit me. I lost three or four teeth \u2014\nmoving teeth, was loose. And he kicked me down from the third floor, spiral \u2014August 26, 2016\nspiral staircase, to the bottom. So I had lot of bleeding. I cut my head. And he \u2014 th-\nthe order was to meet downstairs. When someone was injured, you stay here, one \u2014\nwere you able to walk, you stay here. So my aunt was very worried that I \u2014 I have\ntoo much blood on me. So where \u2014 why \u2014 where they gonna put me? So she licked\noff the blood, and she swallowed it. I really don\u2019t know if you could comprehend\nwhat that means, to lick off my niece\u2019s blood, and swallow it. And she cleaned me\nout, so I was return on the cl \u2014 on the okay people. The not well people were shot\nright away, right front of me. Neighbors, students, friends, teachers, they were shot\nright there, front of me.",
        "Q: All people you knew.",
        "A: Who were \u2014 lived in the house, and people I know. Storekeepers I sold \u2014 I went\nto. And I just looked, I looked. And then Ella says, what you looking? Stay with me\nnow. I said, why? Because. And then on the loudspeaker came, everybody goes to a\nstadium, and there\u2019s someone gonna lead you, and stay in the line, and go to the\nstadium. Stadium was six miles away. You could just physically imagine me, whose\nmouth was cut, or head was cut, walking with my grandmother, six miles away. It\nsounds not so specifically bad, but in actuality, to put yourself physically in this\nsituation is \u2014 1s \u2014 1s unreal that \u2014 that someone ask you to do this, but don\u2019t forget,\nwe were the healthy ones.\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "Q: And it\u2019s mar \u2014 March, right?",
        "A: March. March.",
        "Q: So there is \u2014 is there still snow out, and it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s March, cold, snow, and wet. And we went [indecipherable] in the morning,\n10 o\u2019clock, and finally, finally we got to the stadium.",
        "Q: And had \u2014 had other \u2014 did \u2014 ha \u2014 did you have to march through the city of\nBudapest \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 to get there? So what \u2014 did you notice the reactions of people in town, as they\nsaw all these people being marched?",
        "A: It was a wide lane, you know, it\u2019s not just two or three. So, I really couldn\u2019t see\non th \u2014 where \u2014 what they do there, where \u2014 I heard, there \u2014 good for them, that\u2019s\nwhat they deserve, that\u2019s what they deserve, good for them.",
        "Q: This is what people are yelling at?",
        "A: Yelling at. And it was just \u2014 after shooting all these people, it was just such a\nbad, bad feeling I had. I really didn\u2019t care what did they say to me at this point. So,\ngetting to the stadium was a miracle, a miracle by itself. Was about one or two\no\u2019clock, I don\u2019t know how long. And there were benches, and we sat in the 10\"\nrow, 12 row, I don\u2019t know, and they said the first row, second row, threed row \u2014\nAugust 26, 2016\nthird row, fourth row, go down to the bus, and they take you to your destination. No\none would ask where is our destination, where are we going. No one. I was hungry\nalready, and I was tired, but nothing. After, we found out that those buses took you\nto \u2014 to Auschwitz, and to all the camp, but we didn\u2019t know it then. So my Ella says\nto me, you know, it\u2019s already four o\u2019clock, can\u2019t go on forever. Let\u2019s go all the way\nup, because the lower lanes moving. Let\u2019s go all the way up. So we went all the way\nup, and \u2014 and she was right. And then there was a young Hungarian soldier, a young\nboy, who used to be her newspaper boy. And she was very good to him all the time.\nAnd she called over the boy. Now, how did she trust that boy, I have no clue.\nYou\u2019re doing things which \u2014 which you don\u2019t know the risk you\u2019re taking. You\ndon\u2019t need the risk you\u2019re taking. She called him over, she says, would you walk us\nout of the stadium? We will come back tomorrow. And the boy did. So, he took us\nout, an \u2014 to the \u2014 outside the we \u2014 stadium. And you know, it\u2019s about evening, it\ngets dark early, and now what? But God gave us good Christian people. That\nChristian people, Mrs. Mona(ph), was my aunt\u2019s client. She had the store like bed\nand bath, bedding and the t-towels, and this kind of a stores.",
        "Q: Oh, like ho \u2014- Home Goods.",
        "A: Home Goods. And she did very elegant work, wa \u2014 which included\nmonogramming. And she had the very fancy clients, they had the crowns, and two \u2014\nAugust 26, 2016\ntwo legs on the crown told you who you are, three legs on the crown told you who\nyou are. So this Mrs. Mona(ph), we \u2014 a year before this all started, came into the\nstore, and she said \u2014 very religious woman, very religious Christian woman. She\nsays, I love you both, but Edith, I want to give you a cross, and it\u2019s blessed by the\nHoly Mother, and Ella, I want to give you a cross. You know, not thi \u2014 I\u2019m not\ndisrespectful, but I didn\u2019t know what holy water is, holy cross, I don\u2019t know, I\ndidn\u2019t know, I was 13 years old then, when she gave it to me.",
        "Q: She gave you each a crucifix?",
        "A: Yes, no.",
        "Q: Oh, just a cross necklace?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Little like medallion, or \u2014",
        "A: And the \u2014 yeah, yes, yes, yes. And that \u2014 no, a cr \u2014 a cross.",
        "Q: A cross.",
        "A: Yeah. I still have it. So I forgot about it, took a pocketbook before I left to that\nstadium. And so we went to Mrs. Mona(ph), and she cleaned us up. I\u2019ve a \u2014 and\nthen, in big signs, if you help any Jew, without any trial, you'll be shot. No excuses,\nno discussions. So we didn\u2019t want to stay with her, because we were afraid of \u2014 for\nAugust 26, 2016\nher life. And then the news came out that they\u2019re selling tickets to a safe house,\nwhich is managed by the Vatican, and a Vatican flag flies over it.",
        "Q: In Budapest?",
        "A: In Budapest. You know, that\u2019s all we knew. I mean, how you \u2014 how you fi \u2014\nfigured it out, is it true, 1s 1t not, what did it mean. So my Ella, she could afford it,\nshe had money with her, so she bought for the three of us, two tick \u2014 three tickets,\nand we went there. It\u2019s a two bedroom apartment, about 40 people. Every night I\nfelt urine in my mouth, because there was only two bathroom for 40 people. But\nlooking outside the window, we were still happier to be there, than outside. And\nthen came the big surprise, that the ticket was only good for 14 days. And now,\nwhat do we then do now? So as we went downstairs, at the door, the Germans were\nwaiting for us, and put us in the ghetto. And then in the ghetto, we were put in the\nworst apartment, and every day we were marching outside. I had the hole in my\nshoes, put in newspaper, and by one o\u2019clock [indecipherable] got wet, and melted\nfrom the snow. And very, very degrading person I became. Degrading person who\neverybody loved, and Mimi loved, and had everything in the world, and now I\u2019m\nwalking on the street, and some idiot throwing a \u2014 a pox on me, and cursing and\nwhatnot. Who are these people? I don\u2019t know. I mean, it\u2019s a different neighborhood,\na different zip code, I\u2019d never been there before. And then, I felt that I don\u2019t want toAugust 26, 2016\ndo this any more. So I said to her \u2014 oh, Grandma went to Mrs. Mona(ph), and she \u2014\nshe was hiding there. She had the basement, and she wouldn\u2019t let her go. My\ngrandmother.",

But\nthis is terrible, this is really not something that I \u2014 we don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s\ngonna be.

So I went back to \u2014 upstairs to live, and in a couple of days, I\nwalked out of the line. And the soldier comes to me, what the hell are you doing?\nWith the big rifle.

He holds the rifle, and he says, give\nme your identification paper. And I actually, effectively started to shake, and I\ndropped my bag, and the cross fell out, what Mrs. Martin gave me. And he said,\njust go. And I feel this is a miracle. I feel that it\u2019s a miracle that the cross fell out. It\nwas about six, seven o\u2019clock already. So I wanted to go to Mrs. Mona(ph), I didn\u2019t\nknow exactly where she lived, and \u2014 and \u2014 and I didn\u2019t had money. So I remember\ntaking buses, and trains, and whatnot. And I told the bus driver I\u2019m a student, and I\nlost all my money. He says, that\u2019s all right. He didn\u2019t know I was Jewish. And then\nthere was a fruit store, and I said to the owner, do you have any fruit which you\ncan\u2019t sell, which is damaged, because I\u2019m very hungry. So he went in the back, and\nhe brought me out some fruit, and it was wonderful, because I was very hungry. So\nfinally I found Mrs. Mona(ph) house.",
        "Q: The same Miss Mona(ph) who you had stayed with before.",
        "A: Right. And she opened the door, and she says, can I help you? She didn\u2019t\nrecognize me. I mean, after 11 months in the ghetto, she didn\u2019t recognize me. I says,\nMrs. Mona(ph), this is Chirpy. Oh Chirpy, please come in. Let me take care of\nyou. And \u2014 and \u2014 and, she did. Again, the same situation where I wouldn\u2019t allow\nmyself to stay there, and risk her life, and her family life. I mean, such a decentAugust 26, 2016\nperson, how could I do that to her? So, a friend of a friend of a friend recommended\nme to be a mother\u2019s helper. So I left Mrs. Mona(ph) after three days, and then \u2014 this\nwas end of already finish \u2014 almost finished, everything. I went to this lady, she had\nfour children, and she was thrilled to have me. Which mother is not happy to have a\nmother\u2019s helper, you know? And she lived on a 10 flight house. And she said, oh,\nI\u2019m so happy with you. Everything was fine. However, as it was the tail end of it\nalready, the last months, in April 1945, that\u2019s when the liberation was. And the\nGermans, and the Russians and the Hungarians fought a staircase, the f \u2014 the \u2014 the\nelevation, the f \u2014 third floor, fourth floor, fifth floor, all different soldiers. I didn\u2019t\nknow which is which because they all wore the boots, and they all had rifles. I\ndidn\u2019t know which soldier was [indecipherable] but they didn\u2019t bother us, they\nwere just fighting. For one floor they fought like two days.",
        "Q: And so this was \u2014",
        "A: To take over the floor.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s during the \u2014 the Siege of Budapest \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 that this is happening.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s right in your building.\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Yes. And we went on to the downstairs, to the basement, and that was equipped\nwith the kitchen appliances, refrigerator and food. And they call it bunker, bunker.\nAnd we sometimes slept there, too. But there wasn\u2019t much of a time, there was \u2014 in\nthe meantime, was no food at all. So the \u2014 they took horses, which one was shot\nbefore \u2014 there was no man, every man was in the army \u2014 women took the horse,\nsliced it up and made the stew out of it, or a soup out of it. And when I heard it, I\nwent like this, you know? And th-the woman says, a rough woman, she says, if you\nhungry enough, you gonna eat it. And I was hungry enough to eat it.",
        "Q: These were horses that had been shot that \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 somebody found, and \u2014",
        "A: Was si-sitting on the street, lying on the street.",
        "Q: Right in front of the building?",
        "A: Right in front of the building. And I asked Mrs. Mona(ph) when I got there,\nwhere\u2019s Ella? And she said, she\u2019s trying to hide, by friends. She had a lot of friends,\nbecause she had the store, you know? She knew a lot of people. Well, I was there\ntwo months, at the \u2014 at this person, and then the Russians came in and shot all the\nAugust 26, 2016\nGermans, and told them to go to ru \u2014 you coming with us to Russia. But there were\nno Germans any more, they were the Russians now. And the Hungarians were\narrested, too. So the Russians said, we help you Jews. Somehow, nobody believed\nthem. They didn\u2019t do anything for us. We were freezing. They had \u2014 didn\u2019t give us\nany food. So, they said, now you are free to go wherever you want to. But the\nproblem was, we didn\u2019t have the strength to go anywhere. We had no place to go.\nEvery house looks like a \u2014 a toy house, full of holes, full of holes, just like the\npeople were damaged, shot, to the [indecipherable]. And then, about three days\nlater, the English soldiers came to liberate. And then, we felt free. Every soldier\ntook two, three people, and only took care of those two or three people. And\nblanket, and food, and tea, and \u2014 and \u2014 and for the head. April is a rough month, it\u2019s\nvery windy, and cold, and the \u2014 that\u2019s when we were free, that\u2019s when we were\nliberated, in April 1945. Can we pause now?",
        "Q: Sure, let\u2019s take a \u2014 a quick break. [break]",
        "A: After the English people came in, and the soldiers, we were really free to go, and\n\u2014 and before we\u2019re able to leave, they had to straighten us up a little bit, out. I mean,\nthe strength, the \u2014 the blankets, the food, and the kind words, and where you want\nus to take you. The house, I will tell you about that that after this, because it has its\nown story.\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "Q: Please.",
        "A: So, we come in back to a apartment, not to the same apartment, with Grandma,\nand Ella.",
        "Q: So they both came out of hiding?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you were able to reunite with them?",
        "A: Right, all two of them. Ella\u2019s husband was taken to hard labor camp.",
        "Q: So he \u2014 he was called up for forced labor.",
        "A: Yes, for forced labor, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember what year?",
        "A: About \u2014 let me see that, 1945, 1944. 1944. A year before. So, we started to be \u2014\nwas \u2014 was nothing open, there wasn\u2019t a store open. Peddlers sold fruit and\nvegetables and oil, and eggs, whatever is absolutely necessary, but wasn\u2019t enough.\nSo Ella and I went out to the railroad, and said, let\u2019s go to the \u2014 because her \u2014 she\nembroidered all her stuff. So that \u2014 embroidery comes from small town, far away,\nsmall, little bit back, left town, you know. A little education, and whatever. So, she\nfelt that if we go to those ladies who work for her, they have some supply. So we go\nout one day, is no room on the train. We go out the second day, is no room on the\ntrain. And that kept on going, and then see, there\u2019s somebody sitting on the top of\nAugust 26, 2016\nthe train. So what do you do? You go on the top of the train. How do you go on top\nof the train? You take a rope, and you tie yourself on top of the train. About two\nhours of ride. And you don\u2019t move, you don\u2019t breathe, you don\u2019t anything, just hold\nonto the rope.",
        "Q: So in order to get to the small town where your aunt had business contacts \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 you had to go up to the top of the cars.",
        "A: Because there\u2019s no room in the train. Everybody had the same idea. So we went\nthere, to these people, and they were very gracious, and \u2014 I mean, they were\nworking with Ella 20, 25, 30 years, it\u2019s not a\u2014as-\u2014a short relationship. Ant they\npacked us up flour, eggs, oil, I don\u2019t know what else, in big bag. Not bags, in sacks.\nSo you think that was hard to go out to \u2014 on the train going there, but to bring this\nstuff with us \u2014 so we put everything on top of the train, tied it down, and bring it\nwith us. And it \u2014 it worked, it worked. You know, like I was with the horse food, I\nwould never think I eat it, never, ever. And I ate it, and you know what, I enjoyed it.\nWhen you were hungry enough, you eat it. Anyway, so we were trying to\nrecuperate our lives, schools were closed, and people came back, and \u2014 from the\nconcentration camps, and it was a situation which coming back from hell, because it\nwas hell. They were like 60 pounds, 70 pounds, and he kept us in. I only came backAugust 26, 2016\nbecause I\u2014 I know my mother is here, or my father is here, or my brother is here.\nNo one was alive. No one was alive. There is a Jewish synagogue there, the biggest\nand largest synagogue in eastern Europe. It\u2019s spelled, the Dohan, do \u2014 d-o-h-a-n\nTemple. I have a picture. And they \u2014 and they threw the dead bodies there, so\npeople came, and with their hands, they dug up the rocks and everything, in the\nhope that they feel some of their relatives. So the Jewish people build a tree there,\nand I\u2019d like you to take a picture of it late-later. And every leaf represents a person.\nHundreds and thousands of leaves. It was terrible, and the magnitude of people\ncame back, they didn\u2019t \u2014 nobody handled us. I mean, the \u2014 the English people help\nus with food, whatever, but what can they do? And the months went by, the years\nwent by, and about three years later, I decided to leave Hungary.",
        "Q: Before we go there, so when you have these survivors of the camps coming\nback, is the first time that you, and other people who had been in Budapest the\nentire time, this is the first time you are really learning \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 about the camps, about Auschwitz.",
        "A: Well, I heard about it, you know, very discreetly.",
        "Q: Like \u2014 so that you \u2014 you have heard rumors.\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, there was some buzzing about it. Because remember on the stadium \u2014 at\nthe stadium, we found out later that those buses took the Jews to the camp.",
        "Q: Oh, and so you, way back then \u2014",
        "A: Way back then.",
        "Q: \u2014 you knew \u2014 you knew about Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes. We didn\u2019t know Auschwitz, but we knew that there\u2019s not a good place.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: There were then gassing people. We knew that they taking a shower, and gas\ncomes out.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And going back now to the liberation, after three years \u2014 and everything was\ntwice as hard for me to take because my \u2014 my childhood. Who le \u2014 lost \u2014 losing a\nmo-mother at the age of four, and I just couldn\u2019t understand why me, why me? And\nI ask Grandma, how come Mother left - Mommy left, and she says \u2014 and I said to\nher, didn\u2019t she like me, did I do something bad? And she says, oh no, she loved you,\nbut she had to go. Not that she wanted to go, but she had to go. Of course, later \u2014\nlater years I understood what she said, but it was very hard to comprehend at the\ntime. And going back now, after three years of liberation, I wanted to leave. But\nyou can\u2019t leave Hungary, you can\u2019t \u2014 there is no consulate there. And somebody \u2014August 26, 2016\nmy \u2014 my uncle had a friend in London a \u2014 not in London, in Essex, which is three\nhours from London, in a hospital, a doctor. And gave me a student visa, a nurse\nstudent visa. So I packed up whatever I had, and went to London. Somebody was\nsupposed to wait for me, nobody showed. It was so foggy that I said, excuse me,\nand the next day I saw it was a mailbox. It was so foggy. So I tried to call a number,\nI didn\u2019t end up going, so I didn\u2019t had the number. Finally, somebody came to pick\nme up, and took me to Essex, and I met that Hungarian doctor who send me the six\nmonths student visa. So next day I went to the hospital, and \u2014 and we going to the\nlowest floor. Good thing I didn\u2019t read English, because it says, the morgue.",
        "Q: Yes, I was going to ask, before you went to England, did you speak any\nEnglish?",
        "A: I did, I did, a little bit. Make myself understood.",
        "Q: Okay, and how \u2014 how\u2019d you \u2014 did you learn this after the war had ended?",
        "A: No, in Budapest I learned it, I had the je \u2014 English teacher.",
        "Q: Oh, so \u2014",
        "A: Also, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, this \u2014",
        "A: But not much to talk about, really.",
        "Q: Enough to get by.\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "A: Enough to get \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014I mean, I didn\u2019t know how to read [indecipherable]. I didn\u2019t know. And we\nwent all the way down, and we going to the morgue, and I \u2014 a couple of the nurse,\nlike Iam. And \u2014 and the doctor says, okay girly, this \u2014 this is where you\u2019re going to\nstart working, and your work is gonna be to prepare the dead for burial. I felt the\nway you look. And you know, I was an average child, little more educated than an\naverage \u2014 I spoke perfect German, and Mimi(ph) taught me everything. But even I\ncouldn\u2019t understand that. I couldn\u2019t understand that. But I stayed there for four\nmonths. I collected enough money to go to London, and get the same job, a\nmother\u2019s helper job.",
        "Q: Kind of like a domestic help?",
        "A: Domestic help, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then I applied for a visa. They asked me where do you want to go? I says, I\ndon\u2019t care, because I didn\u2019t care. And they said, go to USA, you \u2014 your \u2014 you\u2019re\ngonna like it. And so okay, go to the USA. And put it a little bit in a nutshell,\nbecause it\u2019s a very long story, and a painful story, one day I get a \u2014 a letter that your\nvisa arrived, and go down to the ocean, and you go with a boat, and you come to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 26, 2016\nAmerica. I went down there. All of a sudden I have a toothache, an abscessed\ntooth. I read dentist, because that\u2019s a universal word. I went to the dentist, and what\na time to have an abscessed tooth, how can you figure that? How \u2014 what are the\nchances? But you had no money, of course, and he says, I take care of you. And he\ntook care of me without money. So I go to the immigration, face to face to the\nperson who handled my case, and he said, you\u2019re all right. And then said, wait a\nminute, one number is wrong. I says, what do you mean, wumber \u2014 number is\nwrong. He says, they didn\u2019t okay you, they okayed someone else.",
        "Q: Oh, your \u2014 your visa? They approved someone else.",
        "A: A mistake. A mistake. So, while I was in England, I made some connection to \u2014\nbecause you \u2014 England didn\u2019t have any Jewish offices or consulate, or anything, so\nI \u2014 these two people, not there \u2014 people told me that in Paris, they do have. So I got\nthe address, I got the phone number, and I called up, and there\u2019s always many\nlangua \u2014 you know, I spoke Hungarian, there \u2014 they have people there. I told them\nmy story, and they said, okay, we take you over now. So we gonna pay for your\ntrip, and you coming over to Paris, and we gonna put in a student visa for you, and\nyou gonna stay \u2014 we took over a big hotel, and everything is free for you. Just you\nhave to earn spending money. How do I earn \u2014 I didn\u2019t speak French or anything. IAugust 26, 2016\nsaid wonderful, I mean, this was such a wonderful proposition. And I went, so I was\nin Paris now.",
        "Q: And what year was that?",
        "A: In 1947.",
        "Q: And \u2014 I\u2019m sorry wa-was it a Jewish organization that \u2014",
        "A: Yes, the Jewish Federation.",
        "Q: Jewish Federation, okay.",
        "A: That time it was called the HIAS.",
        "Q: HIAS, okay.",
        "A: And they put me in an apartment, in a \u2014 in a room with three girls, and it was\nfine. I mean, what I had before, everything was fine. And they fed me, and \u2014 and I\nwent to work in a fur shop, because I knew how to sew. And in the first shop, I\nsewed in the lining to mink coats. Now, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with, how\ncould you, but the leather, to sew, it \u2014 all my fingers were bleeding, because to sew\nthrough leather, it\u2019s almost impossible. But you do, you do, you do. And so I\nworked part-time, and we gave in that, to a school, my visa application. And I was\nin Paris for two years, and I was told that I have the visa.",
        "Q: After two years, you got the visa to the United States.",
        "A: Yes.\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "Q: Okay, so this \u2014 this brings us to year 1949?",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 no, \u201948.",
        "Q: Forty-eight.",
        "A: I came here \u00b048.",
        "Q: Okay. So \u2014",
        "A: In 1948, I got the visa. Now, \u2019'm\u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m very seasick, and I\u2019m a very bad\ntraveler. I have this phobia, I can\u2019t look down, I can\u2019t travel. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s bad. So\nthey put us in a\u2014 in a broken down ship. Took three weeks to get there, and I was\nright away in the \u2014 in the hospital. Nobody came in. There was a Russian lady\nbrought me food, out of her \u2014 good of her heart. Cause she couldn\u2019t talk, she felt\nsorry for me. So she came with food. I asked the doctor, what shall I do? There\u2019s no\ndoctor there [indecipherable] cruise. Three weeks. Three weeks in the hospital\nroom. So then the ship engine stopped. No \u2014 even my Russian lady wasn\u2019t there. No\none was there. And I hear some yelling, anybody\u2019s here, anybody\u2019s here? So I\nunderstood it, and I yell, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here. So this American soldier says, what\nyou doing here? Everybody left \u2014 leaved the ship already. I says, well, I am in the\nhospital for three weeks already, an-and \u2014 and everybody left, they left me, they\nforgot about me. And I said, where are we? Are we in the ocean, where are we? No.\nAnd he picked me up \u2014 I was actually less than I am now, weighted less \u2014 picked\nAugust 26, 2016\nme up and took me upstairs. He says, look, that\u2019s the Lady of Liberty. Holding me\nlike this. Very happy, you know. Very few times I cried of happiness in my life, but\nthat was the time when I cried of happiness. So we went to Ellis Island. And the\nreason we went to Ellis Island, because that\u2019s a \u2014 a spy ship I came with, some\nRussian spy ship. And they took it apart completely. I was three months in Ellis\nIsland, so was everybody else. And they ask question. But you know, Ellis Island\nlooked like the Ritz Carlton, you know, to me, because nobody bothered me,\neverybody was nice to me, and the only thing I didn\u2019t like when they closed the\nsliding doors, you know, the prison doors. But everything else was fine.",
        "Q: So what \u2014 what was it like staying \u2014 you just \u2014",
        "A: They had questions, and they said, were you aware of that \u2014 that it\u2019s a sky \u2014 spy\nship? I said, I wasn\u2019t ever aware of anything, I was in the hospital the whole time.\nCould you \u2014 could you verify this? I said, how can I verify it? If you have that the\nger \u2014 Russian lady, says 90 percent they were Russians. So, do you know the lady\u2019s\nname? You know how she looks? I says, I know how she looks, but I don\u2019t know\nher name. Anyway, so they let us go after three we \u2014 months. It\u2019s a long time, three\nmonths, but it was okay. Very tiresome for me to talk about this, but I really want to\ndo it. Then I came to the Bronx, in New York, to a\u2014 a \u2014 a far relation, a cousin\nremoved couple of times. So she took me in her wings \u2014 under her wings. And she\nAugust 26, 2016\nhad one bedroom, and the living room was a pull out couch, and that\u2019s where I\nslept. And she says, you know how to sew, you have to go to a factory, where you\nmake money. So I went to a dress shop, I made fairly enough, I paid my rent there,\nwas five dollars. And she cooked for me. And the boss of the store didn\u2019t pay, he\nwent bankrupt. It was not a union place. You know, it\u2019s amazing where I took the\nstrength, where I took the hope, after all this slapping in the \u2014 on the face, you\nknow? I mean, how much \u2014 how much can you take? I was 19 years old. How much\ncan you take? So I went to another shop, which was very successful. I was there for\n10 years. On a Hungarian New Year celebration, I met the young man. His name\nwas Sam Palkowitz, and he was a refugee too, but he was in this country already\ncouple years. He went to school to get his accountant CPA license. And at night he\nworked in a delicatessen, and so he finance his \u2014 himself with the money he made\nin the delicatessen. And after two years, we got married. He always said I married\nhim because he was legal here, that he had the green card. It\u2019s not true. Is not true.\nBut I told [indecipherable] oh my God, you know? It wasn\u2019t oh my God, but I\ndidn\u2019t have better offers. And so we were married, everything was fine, we had two\nchildren, and then Sam got the CPA degree. He went to work for a CPA fir-firm,\nand I got my high school equilency diploma, and I went to work for a bank. And I\nwas there for 13, 14 years, and became the \u2014 the manager of the bank. I stepped upAugust 26, 2016\nvery nicely. And we were fine. My son Arthur is an attorney, a part-time judge,\nand my daughter has her own real estate business. They all very successful, because\nI pushed them to no end. And I always said \u2014 and I\u2019m saying on a public speaking,\nthat knowledge is power. That\u2019s what it says on 42\u2122 Street, in the library, and it\u2019s\ntrue. That\u2019s the only thing no one can take it away from you. Everything else goes.\nAnd they listened to me. And then the kids grew up, they went to college, and\nwhatever. And I think getting from my birth, to getting to America, that\u2019s my story.\nLot of obstacles, lot of painful episodes, but that was the cards dealt to me. So, we\ncould go on to America now, but I said most of it, anyway. I don\u2019t want to go into\nAmerica, because I just said it, but I want to speak about my father.",
        "Q: Yes, I wanted to ask what was happening with him, and your ste \u2014",
        "A: There was an announcement, that who is between 25 and 45 years of age, go to\nsomewhere, a stadium, or whatever, go and be there. Who doesn\u2019t come will be\nshot. So, we didn\u2019t know what, my father was 37, 38, and he went there, and they\ntook him to Kiev. On the \u2014 on the 30 degree cold \u2014 minus 30 degree, they made all\nof them, not only my father, work. Their work was to build a bridge, and the next\nday they \u2014 they blew up the bridge \u2014 the bridge. They used them as mined \u2014 you\nknow what\u2019s a mine? People dig on the ground and if you step on it, it blows up.\nThe field mines. And they used them as a mine finder.\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "Q: To go find them, to make \u2014",
        "A: Where the mines are, for the other soldiers to come. And they \u2014 they did that for\nmonths, and my father stepped on one of the mines, and took off one half of his leg.\nSo he was taken to the hospital. And then, that happened again, at the tail end. And\nthen the Germans pushed back the \u2014 the Russians pushed back the Germans, and the\nGermans had to leave, and before they left, they poured gasoline on the hospital,\nand burned it down. And this is not the hearsay, because the Red Cross had notified\nUS.",

        "A: Yes. Now, my \u2014 my Aunt Ella\u2019s husband, Emory(ph), had the father and a\nmother. The mother was a piano teacher, and the father had a store, it\u2019s like Ace\nHardware, but it was very specialized, very good business. And a very tall,\nhandsome Hungarian soldier came, with many decorations on his jacket, came to\nthe house, to that house where I showed you, and he said, Emory(ph) has to go to\n[indecipherable] my uncle has to go, but the father could be saved, if you write\nover the deed to me, the house deed. It was as quiet as now here. What do you do?\nSo my uncle said, listen, alive is more than a house, and he wrote over the deed to\nthe soldier. About a half a mile away, before the ink dried, they shot my grandpa\nand threw him out of the car. I went back, to try to get back, cause it\u2019s worth over\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 26, 2016\ntwo million dol-dollars now, and it\u2019s a legitimate transfer of deed ownership.

        "A: Yes. And this is just about the highlights. I could sit here and talk to you for\ndays, because I only put everything in a nutshell. But since that \u2014 when I was four\nyears old, and came out to America, it was nothing good, only bad. But not just a\nlittle bad, a drama. A thing where people don\u2019t get through easy. I went in America\nto \u2014 for 20 years, for clinical psychiatry studies. I had so much hatred in me. I had\nso \u2014 never wanted to forgive, never. But by psychiatrists I\u2019m told, if you forgive,\nyou release yourself, you are the winner. You don\u2019t hold the \u2014 the bitterness against\npeople. They \u2014 if you really \u2014 if you forgive them, you are the winner, not the other\npeople. And I felt that these people are educated, and smart, and \u2014 and \u2014 and for 20\nyears, I went to these meetings. Did I forgive? I don\u2019t know. Did I forget? No. But\nI\u2019m going on with my life. I\u2019m not a religious Jew, I\u2019m not. Never been. I do\nAugust 26, 2016\nbelieve in miracles, because the cross was a miracle. But, I cannot express what I\nfeel, because what I would say is not legitimate. But I thank whoever took care of\nme, and made that cross fell out from my purse. And whoever watched over me,\nand God did that, and I\u2019m very grateful for it. And if you have some question,\nplease answer me. Ans \u2014 ask me.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And my father worked, and my stepmother, right away, she was very business-\nlike. She worked. She had made a little business for herself. The \u2014 the boots, what\nthe government didn\u2019t use, which was \u2014 had a cut at the leg for some reason, she\nbought up those boots, and she opened a little \u2014 not even a store, like a peddler, you\nknow? And she sold that, and she made so much money. She liked me. She\npreferred I don\u2019t live there, because I was still a package from the previous\nmarriage. But if \u2014 I can\u2019t say that she was mean to me or anything. The sister was a\ndifferent story. The sister said that the father \u2014 my father loved me much more than\nloved her. And my stepmother used to say, no, it\u2019s not true. So, she had the \u2014 she\nAugust 26, 2016\nhas problems. She went back to Hungary to live, and my stepmother lived here in\nAmerica, married three times. If I want to be ugly, I would say, buried three\nhusband. But I have nothing to complain about her, nothing. So, past 20 years, I\nwent back to visit them. And she said, Daddy is looking down, and he\u2019s very happy\nthat you come and visit us. And so, whatever truth 1n it 1s, I did.",
        "Q: And did your \u2014 your aunt and your grandmother were hiding separately \u2014",

        "A: They survived the war.",
        "Q: Did they ever talk about what it was like in hiding?",
        "A: No. Wasn\u2019t much to talk. That Mrs. Mona(ph) was a saint. You know, she took\ncare of Grandma, and th-the people who Ella went to, they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014\nthey \u2014 they think she was an angel, you know? I mean, she did so many favor. That\ntime, people didn\u2019t make donations, you know? Or have people like the newspaper\nboy. When he needed some books or something, came to Ella and says, could you\nhelp me out? I give you back the money. So she gave him the money, and always\nhelped him. And \u2014 and I guess that\u2019s why he did what he did. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s\nwhat he did. And a good deed comes back. Good deed comes back to you. And you\nmust believe that. Maybe not that same day, or week, or month, or year, but in a\nAugust 26, 2016\nlifetime, what you do good, it will come back to you. And I\u2019m very fortunate, I have\nwonderful children. Wonderful children. Ambitious, and good, and \u2014 my son is 60\nyears old, was last week, and every mother says that, I think what I have the best\nchildren in the world. I\u2019m probably a little prejudiced, but that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s okay.\nAnd so are my grandchildren. I\u2019m very close to them. My husband died 15 years\nago. He had the aneurysm, and in two weeks, he died. He didn\u2019t suffer with cancer\nor anything, which I was very grateful for.",
        "Q: And he was a survivor as well?",

And he jumped off the bus, and\nhe broke his knee. And the bus stopped, and they, with their rifle, they hit his knee,\nthe one that was broken, til he passed out. And they left him there. He said, this is\nyour punishment, to try to escape. His father was a very rich man. His father comes\nfrom north Hungary, northern Hungary, Ungvar, it\u2019s \u2014 he had the winery, huge\nwinery. Was very rich, and very powerful man. And he went to Auschwitz, and\nthey couldn\u2019t kill him. They did \u2014 he was such a strong, big man, whatever job they\ngave him, he did it. And the last day, they shot him. He didn\u2019t come with me for the\ntherapy, he couldn\u2019t. He says, I can\u2019t pour out my heart to a stranger. He never\ncame with me. And that wasn\u2019t the best for the marriage, because he had that\nAugust 26, 2016\nbitterness, that memory, losing his mother, and get a stepmother. But, that\u2019s was \u2014\nin Europe they did that, you know [indecipherable] in birth, she died. Birth for\nhim, in his birth, she died. And then the father remarried, and he was okay with the\nstepmother.",
        "Q: And so he \u2014 he was on a transport to go to a camp, and that\u2019s when he \u2014 he\njumped off?",

I don\u2019t even know what country was it, Hungary or \u2014 or Poland, I don\u2019t\nknow what country was it. And they brought him back to health. So, we could not\nsurvive without those Christian people, the ones helped us, not regarding the\nAugust 26, 2016\nconsequences, what comes helping a Jew. And those are the people we are very\ngrateful to.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 you mentioned that you visited \u2014 you visited Hungary several times.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: I didn\u2019t look at the houses, I didn\u2019t look at anything. I stayed in a hotel.\nSometimes I went with friends, with American friends. And \u2014 but I don\u2019t like to go\nto a hotel by myself. It\u2019s not for a special reason. And then we \u2014 with my friend\nbeing [indecipherable] trip to Italy, or whatever, some other places, and then we\nvisited Irene, my stepmother, and my stepsister. And we st-stayed with them two,\nthree, four days, five days, according to a plan.",
        "Q: I guess, was it \u2014 was it \u2014",
        "A: Was hard.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Was hard. And then late \u2014 later, I visit \u2014 visited or so frequently, because it got\nmore painful. And as you get older, it\u2019s harder to deal with it. But I did visit, I really\ndid. But then my stepsister died, my stepmother died. She was 92, my stepmother.\nAnd that was the end of that story.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 you speak to school groups now?\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Y-You speak to all kinds of groups now, about your experiences. What made\nyou decide to do that?",
        "A: Which part of it?",
        "Q: I guess, what \u2014 what made you decide to start speaking to groups, and telling\nthem about your experiences?",
        "A: Oh. I was invited first, in a jail. And then I was invited \u2014 it\u2019s a name, a leave \u2014\nlife \u2014 or a leave \u2014 a life. It\u2019s a group which is built by the government, and\nteenagers, 12, 13, 14, 15 \u2014 and I go there every year \u2014 are pregnant. So this\norganization take them to high school, and teach them high school, and they\narranging a nursery for the children. And they were very down. I didn\u2019t say half of\nmy story. Less than half. But I encourage them that there is no choice not to do\nanything, because if you don\u2019t do anything, you\u2019re going backwards. And who\nwants to go backwards? Your child doesn\u2019t deserve for you to give up. So I gave a\npep talk, versus my talk. And it worked, it worked, the \u2014 some of them started to\ncry. They invited me every year, and \u2014 and that was the beginning. And then\nschools asked me to make speeches. And depends on the audience, depends on the\npeople how much do I say of the bitter life I had. Depends on that. I do not say\neverything. I say some. For instance, in Budapest, the soldiers took the women up\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 26, 2016\nto the ho \u2014 office, to do office work, but that wasn\u2019t office work. When they were\nfinding the second floor, third floor, five \u2014 fifth floor, it was two, three men raped\nthe women. Some didn\u2019t come back at all, and the ones came back, I wish I couldn\u2019t\ncome back. Bleeding, beaten up, black and blue. And that\u2019s how they co \u2014 came\nback. So this is \u2014 this is \u2014 this is a country occupation. It happens in every country.\nBut I wore the \u2014 I mean, I was so young, I wore a kerchief around my head, a black\nkerchief, so I look ugly \u2014 not that I\u2019m so beautiful, but I look ugly, and \u2014 and older,\nand didn\u2019t look anywhere like a \u2014 a retarded person I looked. I wanted to be \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t want to take \u2014 I mean, with due respect, I didn\u2019t want to be taken.",
        "Q: And this was all soldiers that were doing it?",
        "A: Yes, Hungarians, and German.",
        "Q: What about the Soviet soldiers, when they came? Did this continue?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t see sov \u2014 Soviet in the beginning. On the tail end, we did. We did.",
        "Q: Were there also rapes?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, really. But we were very close to the German and the Hungarian\nsoldiers. And that was \u2014 that was something which happened \u2014 I mean, watching the\ncountries, what happens in the country, and transporting human being, and selling\nhuman beings, it happens all the time. But to me, that was the first one. That was\nthe first experience, when they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they transporting \u2014 they using human\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 26, 2016\nbeings. And to me that was a terrible thing. A terrible thing, which is unexcusable.\nHere you make money on it. There wasn\u2019t even money on it. It was coming to them.\nAnd we were very lucky, because the was started four years ago. We were the last\ncountry to be occupied. So we had only 11 months of the occupation, where four \u2014\nand then the other countries had three, four years.",
        "Q: And something else I wanted to ask you about the war years, and the years\nleading up, did you ever s \u2014 what was the ar \u2014 the Arrow Cross doing in Hungary\u201d\nThe fa \u2014 the Hungarian Fascist party, I think it\u2019s Nyilas?",

        "Q: What were \u2014 what were they doing? Do you remember any specific incidents, or",
        "A: Yes, I remember. First of all, they wear \u2014 they wore a feather in their hats. Why\nis it important to me, because I \u2014 I \u2014 I was transferred to a \u2014 a big factory, at one\ntime, for a month or so, with Ella. And we were hiding in the gutter, and we saw the\nfeather, and then we just played dead. But that\u2019s my af \u2014 incident. But they were a\nlittle bit more educated than the average soldier. They were like teaching the\naverage soldier how to kill the Jews. And they were firm believer of the Germans\n[indecipherable]. Firm believer, Nyilas. You \u2014 you\u2019re free to mention that. It\u2019s a\nword you don\u2019t want to be any connection with.\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "Q: So they \u2014 they were more feared \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes. As I said, they were more educated than the average people. Educated\nby the government, and then the Germans took over their education. And that\nwasn\u2019t an education like the five subjects. It was one subject; how to kill the Jews.\nThat\u2019s what he wanted, a pure country. There is only white people, and Christian\npeople, and he \u2014 that\u2019s what he wanted. Hitler.",
        "Q: Did you hear any \u2014 any rumors about the Danube shootings, by the Arrow\nCross?",
        "A: Yes. I don\u2019t \u2014I didn\u2019t see it, but I was told that they tied their hands together in\nthe back, they tied their feet together, they \u2014 they \u2014 they pushed them into the water,\nand then they shot them. And there are shoes on the [indecipherable] of \u2014\nchildren\u2019s shoes, grown-up shoes, all shoes, because there were lot of, lot of\nchildren there. How did they got away with it? In \u2014 in school, I used to sit at the\ndesk of the teacher \u2014 not sit on the desk, near the desk, and I saw the globe. And I\nwas playing with it, and then it occurred to me, nobody hears us, nobody sees us,\nwhat\u2019s going on. Not one person in the world would help us. Why? And the world\nis big. And why we didn\u2019t get any help? But of course, I never got the answer.",

        "A: No, no. No way, no way, no way. Unless you say, I love the Nyilas. That\u2019s all\nyou were allowed to say. I mean, wouldn\u2019t think about it. Wouldn\u2019t think about it. I\nmean, it was fire, you know? It was fire. Every house was injured, every person was\ninjured, an-and that\u2019s why I left. I didn\u2019t want to live there.

        "A: All right?",
        "A: So, the first thing I remember, I was four years old, and I found myself in a\nplace, the snow was higher than I was. A lot of people crying, crying, tearing of the\nclothes, and a big commotion. And nobody pays attention to me. When we left, I\nsaid to somebody, where are we? What is this place? And they said, this is a\ncemetery, and we just buried your mother. I was four years old. I was told she died\nfrom a brain tumor, on the operating table. So my f\u2014 we get home, when I stay with\nmy grandmother, and my father moved in, and we were the three of us, because\nGrandpa died just before. And was a very difficult life, because my mother was so\nyoung, and my grandmother couldn\u2019t take the pain, and the sorrow, to lose a young\ndaughter like that. So, we covered by rel \u2014 Jewish religion, we cover the mirrors\nwhen someone dies, and we did cover it, and after 30 days you\u2019re supposed to take\nit off, but she never took it off. As my \u2014 as long as I remember, the mirrors were\ncovered. So, being that I had no one to take care of me, my Aunt Ella hired a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 26, 2016\ngoverness, whose name was Mimi. So Mimi took care of me since I was four years\nold, til right after the war. And we did everything together, schoolwork, fun work.\nShe taught me lots of etiquette; she felt it was very important. She taught me how to\nboil eggs warm water, in case. [indecipherable] in case of what? Everything is\ngood to know. Everything is good to know. I was ironing, I was washing, cause she\ndid tell me all these things. And I was very content, she was very, very good to me.\nAnd couldn\u2019t be happier, except the house where I lived with Grandma, it was a\nvery sad house. And I \u2014 the children didn\u2019t want to play with me, because I was\nalways sad. And \u2014 and this is how the years went by. And I went to school, and\nwhen in 1944, Mimi wanted to leave. And we didn\u2019t understand why Mimi wants\nto leave. And she said that in her home, there is a catastrophe, and she has to leave.\nDoesn\u2019t matter how much she loves me, she has to leave. So that was an indication\nthat some political change is going through. But of course the news was handled\nthrough the government, and fa \u2014 also the radio. There wasn\u2019t any television or\nanything, like today. So, in a quiet, buzzing way, we heard that the German army\ntook over Czechoslovakia, Romania, other parts of Hungary, Poland, France, all\nthe eastern European countries. And we heard this stuff, and it was very surprising,\nbecause we don\u2019t know this stuff, we don\u2019t know these things. Could I have a drink\nof water, please? [interruption]\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Mimi left, went back to Switzerland, and so it was my grandmother, and my\naunt didn\u2019t live with us, but my father remarried, three years before.",
        "A: Right. They married a very nice person, and they had the child together. Her\nname was Susan, Susan. They wanted me to live with them, and I wanted to live\nwith them, because I was tired of the old atmosphere, and the sadness, and the\ncovered mirrors, and all that. But my grandmother wouldn\u2019t allow it. She says,\nyou\u2019re my only contact to my daughter, and I\u2019m not letting you go.",
        "A: And she stated it with so much common sense, that nobody was arguing about it.\nSo I stayed with my grandmother, and contacted my stepsister once in a while. Very\n\u2014 you know, it \u2014 and then in three years they were together only \u2014 only three years,\nand then became 1944. And so that day, that big day came, when tanks, and military\nmachines, and guns, and unbelievable attack on every house. They just shoot. They\nAugust 26, 2016\nwere shooting without aiming. They just were shooting. And then a young man, a\nGerman fellow, soldier, came in yelling and yelling and pushing. Broke down the\nfront door, and he said, schnell, schnell, that means hurry, hurry. And I had what I\nhad on, not special clothes or anything. I just grab my pocketbook, and \u2014 and for \u2014\nfor 1-identification, and \u2014 and \u2014 and a little jacket, that\u2019s all.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no. Some thing \u2014 restrictions were in the schools. They didn\u2019t have religious\nclasses, so they combined the Christian classes with the Jewish classes. However,\nthey didn\u2019t make us to kne \u2014 knee down \u2014 kneel down, or any other things. So we\nsat in the back, and we just sat there. And our building had three flights. One \u2014 two\nstaircases. One was for the residents, and one was for the delivery and maintenance.\nAnd he keeps on pushing me, the soldier, and I\u2019m going to where I always go, to the\nresident s-staircase. And he starts to hit me with the \u2014 with the rifle back, and you\nlousy ge \u2014 Jew, you don\u2019t deserve to be on the \u2014 on that staircase. You go where the\ndelivery is, where \u2014 where the maintenance men are. And he was very upset. And I\nturned around, went over there, and he started to hit me. I lost three or four teeth \u2014\nmoving teeth, was loose. And he kicked me down from the third floor, spiral \u2014August 26, 2016\nspiral staircase, to the bottom. So I had lot of bleeding. I cut my head. And he \u2014 th-\nthe order was to meet downstairs. When someone was injured, you stay here, one \u2014\nwere you able to walk, you stay here. So my aunt was very worried that I \u2014 I have\ntoo much blood on me. So where \u2014 why \u2014 where they gonna put me? So she licked\noff the blood, and she swallowed it. I really don\u2019t know if you could comprehend\nwhat that means, to lick off my niece\u2019s blood, and swallow it. And she cleaned me\nout, so I was return on the cl \u2014 on the okay people. The not well people were shot\nright away, right front of me. Neighbors, students, friends, teachers, they were shot\nright there, front of me.",
        "A: Who were \u2014 lived in the house, and people I know. Storekeepers I sold \u2014 I went\nto. And I just looked, I looked. And then Ella says, what you looking? Stay with me\nnow. I said, why? Because. And then on the loudspeaker came, everybody goes to a\nstadium, and there\u2019s someone gonna lead you, and stay in the line, and go to the\nstadium. Stadium was six miles away. You could just physically imagine me, whose\nmouth was cut, or head was cut, walking with my grandmother, six miles away. It\nsounds not so specifically bad, but in actuality, to put yourself physically in this\nsituation is \u2014 1s \u2014 1s unreal that \u2014 that someone ask you to do this, but don\u2019t forget,\nwe were the healthy ones.\nAugust 26, 2016",

        "A: It was a wide lane, you know, it\u2019s not just two or three. So, I really couldn\u2019t see\non th \u2014 where \u2014 what they do there, where \u2014 I heard, there \u2014 good for them, that\u2019s\nwhat they deserve, that\u2019s what they deserve, good for them.",
        "A: Yelling at. And it was just \u2014 after shooting all these people, it was just such a\nbad, bad feeling I had. I really didn\u2019t care what did they say to me at this point. So,\ngetting to the stadium was a miracle, a miracle by itself. Was about one or two\no\u2019clock, I don\u2019t know how long. And there were benches, and we sat in the 10\"\nrow, 12 row, I don\u2019t know, and they said the first row, second row, threed row \u2014\nAugust 26, 2016\nthird row, fourth row, go down to the bus, and they take you to your destination. No\none would ask where is our destination, where are we going. No one. I was hungry\nalready, and I was tired, but nothing. After, we found out that those buses took you\nto \u2014 to Auschwitz, and to all the camp, but we didn\u2019t know it then. So my Ella says\nto me, you know, it\u2019s already four o\u2019clock, can\u2019t go on forever. Let\u2019s go all the way\nup, because the lower lanes moving. Let\u2019s go all the way up. So we went all the way\nup, and \u2014 and she was right. And then there was a young Hungarian soldier, a young\nboy, who used to be her newspaper boy. And she was very good to him all the time.\nAnd she called over the boy. Now, how did she trust that boy, I have no clue.\nYou\u2019re doing things which \u2014 which you don\u2019t know the risk you\u2019re taking. You\ndon\u2019t need the risk you\u2019re taking. She called him over, she says, would you walk us\nout of the stadium? We will come back tomorrow. And the boy did. So, he took us\nout, an \u2014 to the \u2014 outside the we \u2014 stadium. And you know, it\u2019s about evening, it\ngets dark early, and now what? But God gave us good Christian people. That\nChristian people, Mrs. Mona(ph), was my aunt\u2019s client. She had the store like bed\nand bath, bedding and the t-towels, and this kind of a stores.",
        "A: Home Goods. And she did very elegant work, wa \u2014 which included\nmonogramming. And she had the very fancy clients, they had the crowns, and two \u2014\nAugust 26, 2016\ntwo legs on the crown told you who you are, three legs on the crown told you who\nyou are. So this Mrs. Mona(ph), we \u2014 a year before this all started, came into the\nstore, and she said \u2014 very religious woman, very religious Christian woman. She\nsays, I love you both, but Edith, I want to give you a cross, and it\u2019s blessed by the\nHoly Mother, and Ella, I want to give you a cross. You know, not thi \u2014 I\u2019m not\ndisrespectful, but I didn\u2019t know what holy water is, holy cross, I don\u2019t know, I\ndidn\u2019t know, I was 13 years old then, when she gave it to me.",
        "A: Yes, no.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And the \u2014 yeah, yes, yes, yes. And that \u2014 no, a cr \u2014 a cross.",
        "A: Yeah. I still have it. So I forgot about it, took a pocketbook before I left to that\nstadium. And so we went to Mrs. Mona(ph), and she cleaned us up. I\u2019ve a \u2014 and\nthen, in big signs, if you help any Jew, without any trial, you'll be shot. No excuses,\nno discussions. So we didn\u2019t want to stay with her, because we were afraid of \u2014 for\nAugust 26, 2016\nher life. And then the news came out that they\u2019re selling tickets to a safe house,\nwhich is managed by the Vatican, and a Vatican flag flies over it.",
        "A: In Budapest. You know, that\u2019s all we knew. I mean, how you \u2014 how you fi \u2014\nfigured it out, is it true, 1s 1t not, what did it mean. So my Ella, she could afford it,\nshe had money with her, so she bought for the three of us, two tick \u2014 three tickets,\nand we went there. It\u2019s a two bedroom apartment, about 40 people. Every night I\nfelt urine in my mouth, because there was only two bathroom for 40 people. But\nlooking outside the window, we were still happier to be there, than outside. And\nthen came the big surprise, that the ticket was only good for 14 days. And now,\nwhat do we then do now? So as we went downstairs, at the door, the Germans were\nwaiting for us, and put us in the ghetto. And then in the ghetto, we were put in the\nworst apartment, and every day we were marching outside. I had the hole in my\nshoes, put in newspaper, and by one o\u2019clock [indecipherable] got wet, and melted\nfrom the snow. And very, very degrading person I became. Degrading person who\neverybody loved, and Mimi loved, and had everything in the world, and now I\u2019m\nwalking on the street, and some idiot throwing a \u2014 a pox on me, and cursing and\nwhatnot. Who are these people? I don\u2019t know. I mean, it\u2019s a different neighborhood,\na different zip code, I\u2019d never been there before. And then, I felt that I don\u2019t want toAugust 26, 2016\ndo this any more. So I said to her \u2014 oh, Grandma went to Mrs. Mona(ph), and she \u2014\nshe was hiding there. She had the basement, and she wouldn\u2019t let her go. My\ngrandmother.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right. And then Ella and I was in the ghetto. And I said to Ella, I said, look,\nlet\u2019s get out of the \u2014 the \u2014 the lane. I mean, they\u2019re not going to kill us. Oh Edith,\nplease honey, of course, they\u2019re gonna kill us. She called me Chirpy, that was my\nnickname, Chirpy.",
        "A: Yes. And it\u2019s a very warm name, you know, it\u2019s a very loving name. And she\nsays, Chirpy, this is crazy what you\u2019re thinking. Ella, I\u2019m not going to stay here,\nand be here six, seven, eight months. I mean, I \u2014 1 \u2014 I\u2014 I went on to nothing. And\nwe didn\u2019t eat, and we didn\u2019t trust anyone to \u2014 to talk to, because if people told about\nother people, hoping to get extra food.\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "A: No ca\u2014no one to trust. So I walked like on the side of the line, already get back\nin the line, get back in the line. So, in the 10, 11\" month, one day I walk with Ella,\nand I\u2019m talking to her. I said, listen Ella, Ill go out there, you don\u2019t have to. But\nthis is terrible, this is really not something that I \u2014 we don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s\ngonna be. In the meantime we had the \u2014 heard about the Polish reso \u2014 revolution,\nthat they killed the underground people, and \u2014 and \u2014 and it was terrible.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right, right. She says \u2014 and then I said, why don\u2019t you answer me, why don\u2019t\nyou answer me? And she is nowhere. Somebody pulled her out of the lane, and I\ncan\u2019t find her. So, I was all by myself, and I think that was my worst day, when I\nlost everything; all the confident, all the hope, all the \u2014 all the attention, everything.\nI lost everything. So I went back to \u2014 upstairs to live, and in a couple of days, I\nwalked out of the line. And the soldier comes to me, what the hell are you doing?\nWith the big rifle. I didn\u2019t say anything. He said, let me see your papers.",
        "A: A German.",
        "A: German. And I spoke fluently German, remember? But I couldn\u2019t say a word,\nthe words didn\u2019t come out. What shall I say? He holds the rifle, and he says, give\nme your identification paper. And I actually, effectively started to shake, and I\ndropped my bag, and the cross fell out, what Mrs. Martin gave me. And he said,\njust go. And I feel this is a miracle. I feel that it\u2019s a miracle that the cross fell out. It\nwas about six, seven o\u2019clock already. So I wanted to go to Mrs. Mona(ph), I didn\u2019t\nknow exactly where she lived, and \u2014 and \u2014 and I didn\u2019t had money. So I remember\ntaking buses, and trains, and whatnot. And I told the bus driver I\u2019m a student, and I\nlost all my money. He says, that\u2019s all right. He didn\u2019t know I was Jewish. And then\nthere was a fruit store, and I said to the owner, do you have any fruit which you\ncan\u2019t sell, which is damaged, because I\u2019m very hungry. So he went in the back, and\nhe brought me out some fruit, and it was wonderful, because I was very hungry. So\nfinally I found Mrs. Mona(ph) house.",
        "A: Right. And she opened the door, and she says, can I help you? She didn\u2019t\nrecognize me. I mean, after 11 months in the ghetto, she didn\u2019t recognize me. I says,\nMrs. Mona(ph), this is Chirpy. Oh Chirpy, please come in. Let me take care of\nyou. And \u2014 and \u2014 and, she did. Again, the same situation where I wouldn\u2019t allow\nmyself to stay there, and risk her life, and her family life. I mean, such a decentAugust 26, 2016\nperson, how could I do that to her? So, a friend of a friend of a friend recommended\nme to be a mother\u2019s helper. So I left Mrs. Mona(ph) after three days, and then \u2014 this\nwas end of already finish \u2014 almost finished, everything. I went to this lady, she had\nfour children, and she was thrilled to have me. Which mother is not happy to have a\nmother\u2019s helper, you know? And she lived on a 10 flight house. And she said, oh,\nI\u2019m so happy with you. Everything was fine. However, as it was the tail end of it\nalready, the last months, in April 1945, that\u2019s when the liberation was. And the\nGermans, and the Russians and the Hungarians fought a staircase, the f \u2014 the \u2014 the\nelevation, the f \u2014 third floor, fourth floor, fifth floor, all different soldiers. I didn\u2019t\nknow which is which because they all wore the boots, and they all had rifles. I\ndidn\u2019t know which soldier was [indecipherable] but they didn\u2019t bother us, they\nwere just fighting. For one floor they fought like two days.",
        "A: To take over the floor.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right, right.\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes. And we went on to the downstairs, to the basement, and that was equipped\nwith the kitchen appliances, refrigerator and food. And they call it bunker, bunker.\nAnd we sometimes slept there, too. But there wasn\u2019t much of a time, there was \u2014 in\nthe meantime, was no food at all. So the \u2014 they took horses, which one was shot\nbefore \u2014 there was no man, every man was in the army \u2014 women took the horse,\nsliced it up and made the stew out of it, or a soup out of it. And when I heard it, I\nwent like this, you know? And th-the woman says, a rough woman, she says, if you\nhungry enough, you gonna eat it. And I was hungry enough to eat it.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Was si-sitting on the street, lying on the street.",
        "A: Right in front of the building. And I asked Mrs. Mona(ph) when I got there,\nwhere\u2019s Ella? And she said, she\u2019s trying to hide, by friends. She had a lot of friends,\nbecause she had the store, you know? She knew a lot of people. Well, I was there\ntwo months, at the \u2014 at this person, and then the Russians came in and shot all the\nAugust 26, 2016\nGermans, and told them to go to ru \u2014 you coming with us to Russia. But there were\nno Germans any more, they were the Russians now. And the Hungarians were\narrested, too. So the Russians said, we help you Jews. Somehow, nobody believed\nthem. They didn\u2019t do anything for us. We were freezing. They had \u2014 didn\u2019t give us\nany food. So, they said, now you are free to go wherever you want to. But the\nproblem was, we didn\u2019t have the strength to go anywhere. We had no place to go.\nEvery house looks like a \u2014 a toy house, full of holes, full of holes, just like the\npeople were damaged, shot, to the [indecipherable]. And then, about three days\nlater, the English soldiers came to liberate. And then, we felt free. Every soldier\ntook two, three people, and only took care of those two or three people. And\nblanket, and food, and tea, and \u2014 and \u2014 and for the head. April is a rough month, it\u2019s\nvery windy, and cold, and the \u2014 that\u2019s when we were free, that\u2019s when we were\nliberated, in April 1945. Can we pause now?",
        "A: After the English people came in, and the soldiers, we were really free to go, and\n\u2014 and before we\u2019re able to leave, they had to straighten us up a little bit, out. I mean,\nthe strength, the \u2014 the blankets, the food, and the kind words, and where you want\nus to take you. The house, I will tell you about that that after this, because it has its\nown story.\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "A: So, we come in back to a apartment, not to the same apartment, with Grandma,\nand Ella.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right, all two of them. Ella\u2019s husband was taken to hard labor camp.",
        "A: Yes, for forced labor, yeah.",
        "A: About \u2014 let me see that, 1945, 1944. 1944. A year before. So, we started to be \u2014\nwas \u2014 was nothing open, there wasn\u2019t a store open. Peddlers sold fruit and\nvegetables and oil, and eggs, whatever is absolutely necessary, but wasn\u2019t enough.\nSo Ella and I went out to the railroad, and said, let\u2019s go to the \u2014 because her \u2014 she\nembroidered all her stuff. So that \u2014 embroidery comes from small town, far away,\nsmall, little bit back, left town, you know. A little education, and whatever. So, she\nfelt that if we go to those ladies who work for her, they have some supply. So we go\nout one day, is no room on the train. We go out the second day, is no room on the\ntrain. And that kept on going, and then see, there\u2019s somebody sitting on the top of\nAugust 26, 2016\nthe train. So what do you do? You go on the top of the train. How do you go on top\nof the train? You take a rope, and you tie yourself on top of the train. About two\nhours of ride. And you don\u2019t move, you don\u2019t breathe, you don\u2019t anything, just hold\nonto the rope.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Because there\u2019s no room in the train. Everybody had the same idea. So we went\nthere, to these people, and they were very gracious, and \u2014 I mean, they were\nworking with Ella 20, 25, 30 years, it\u2019s not a\u2014as-\u2014a short relationship. Ant they\npacked us up flour, eggs, oil, I don\u2019t know what else, in big bag. Not bags, in sacks.\nSo you think that was hard to go out to \u2014 on the train going there, but to bring this\nstuff with us \u2014 so we put everything on top of the train, tied it down, and bring it\nwith us. And it \u2014 it worked, it worked. You know, like I was with the horse food, I\nwould never think I eat it, never, ever. And I ate it, and you know what, I enjoyed it.\nWhen you were hungry enough, you eat it. Anyway, so we were trying to\nrecuperate our lives, schools were closed, and people came back, and \u2014 from the\nconcentration camps, and it was a situation which coming back from hell, because it\nwas hell. They were like 60 pounds, 70 pounds, and he kept us in. I only came backAugust 26, 2016\nbecause I\u2014 I know my mother is here, or my father is here, or my brother is here.\nNo one was alive. No one was alive. There is a Jewish synagogue there, the biggest\nand largest synagogue in eastern Europe. It\u2019s spelled, the Dohan, do \u2014 d-o-h-a-n\nTemple. I have a picture. And they \u2014 and they threw the dead bodies there, so\npeople came, and with their hands, they dug up the rocks and everything, in the\nhope that they feel some of their relatives. So the Jewish people build a tree there,\nand I\u2019d like you to take a picture of it late-later. And every leaf represents a person.\nHundreds and thousands of leaves. It was terrible, and the magnitude of people\ncame back, they didn\u2019t \u2014 nobody handled us. I mean, the \u2014 the English people help\nus with food, whatever, but what can they do? And the months went by, the years\nwent by, and about three years later, I decided to leave Hungary.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I heard about it, you know, very discreetly.\nAugust 26, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, there was some buzzing about it. Because remember on the stadium \u2014 at\nthe stadium, we found out later that those buses took the Jews to the camp.",
        "A: Way back then.",
        "A: Yes. We didn\u2019t know Auschwitz, but we knew that there\u2019s not a good place.",
        "A: There were then gassing people. We knew that they taking a shower, and gas\ncomes out.",
        "A: And going back now to the liberation, after three years \u2014 and everything was\ntwice as hard for me to take because my \u2014 my childhood. Who le \u2014 lost \u2014 losing a\nmo-mother at the age of four, and I just couldn\u2019t understand why me, why me? And\nI ask Grandma, how come Mother left - Mommy left, and she says \u2014 and I said to\nher, didn\u2019t she like me, did I do something bad? And she says, oh no, she loved you,\nbut she had to go. Not that she wanted to go, but she had to go. Of course, later \u2014\nlater years I understood what she said, but it was very hard to comprehend at the\ntime. And going back now, after three years of liberation, I wanted to leave. But\nyou can\u2019t leave Hungary, you can\u2019t \u2014 there is no consulate there. And somebody \u2014August 26, 2016\nmy \u2014 my uncle had a friend in London a \u2014 not in London, in Essex, which is three\nhours from London, in a hospital, a doctor. And gave me a student visa, a nurse\nstudent visa. So I packed up whatever I had, and went to London. Somebody was\nsupposed to wait for me, nobody showed. It was so foggy that I said, excuse me,\nand the next day I saw it was a mailbox. It was so foggy. So I tried to call a number,\nI didn\u2019t end up going, so I didn\u2019t had the number. Finally, somebody came to pick\nme up, and took me to Essex, and I met that Hungarian doctor who send me the six\nmonths student visa. So next day I went to the hospital, and \u2014 and we going to the\nlowest floor. Good thing I didn\u2019t read English, because it says, the morgue.",

And you know, I was an average child, little more educated than an\naverage \u2014 I spoke perfect German, and Mimi(ph) taught me everything. But even I\ncouldn\u2019t understand that. I couldn\u2019t understand that. But I stayed there for four\nmonths. I collected enough money to go to London, and get the same job, a\nmother\u2019s helper job.",
        "A: Domestic help, yeah.",
        "A: And then I applied for a visa. They asked me where do you want to go? I says, I\ndon\u2019t care, because I didn\u2019t care. And they said, go to USA, you \u2014 your \u2014 you\u2019re\ngonna like it. And so okay, go to the USA. And put it a little bit in a nutshell,\nbecause it\u2019s a very long story, and a painful story, one day I get a \u2014 a letter that your\nvisa arrived, and go down to the ocean, and you go with a boat, and you come to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 26, 2016\nAmerica.

And he\ntook care of me without money. So I go to the immigration, face to face to the\nperson who handled my case, and he said, you\u2019re all right. And then said, wait a\nminute, one number is wrong. I says, what do you mean, wumber \u2014 number is\nwrong. He says, they didn\u2019t okay you, they okayed someone else.",

It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s bad. So\nthey put us in a\u2014 in a broken down ship. Took three weeks to get there, and I was\nright away in the \u2014 in the hospital. Nobody came in. There was a Russian lady\nbrought me food, out of her \u2014 good of her heart. Cause she couldn\u2019t talk, she felt\nsorry for me. So she came with food. I asked the doctor, what shall I do? There\u2019s no\ndoctor there [indecipherable] cruise. Three weeks. Three weeks in the hospital\nroom. So then the ship engine stopped. No \u2014 even my Russian lady wasn\u2019t there. No\none was there. And I hear some yelling, anybody\u2019s here, anybody\u2019s here? So I\nunderstood it, and I yell, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here. So this American soldier says, what\nyou doing here? Everybody left \u2014 leaved the ship already. I says, well, I am in the\nhospital for three weeks already, an-and \u2014 and everybody left, they left me, they\nforgot about me. And I said, where are we? Are we in the ocean, where are we? No.\nAnd he picked me up \u2014 I was actually less than I am now, weighted less \u2014 picked\nAugust 26, 2016\nme up and took me upstairs. He says, look, that\u2019s the Lady of Liberty. Holding me\nlike this. Very happy, you know. Very few times I cried of happiness in my life, but\nthat was the time when I cried of happiness. So we went to Ellis Island. And the\nreason we went to Ellis Island, because that\u2019s a \u2014 a spy ship I came with, some\nRussian spy ship. And they took it apart completely. I was three months in Ellis\nIsland, so was everybody else. And they ask question. But you know, Ellis Island\nlooked like the Ritz Carlton, you know, to me, because nobody bothered me,\neverybody was nice to me, and the only thing I didn\u2019t like when they closed the\nsliding doors, you know, the prison doors. But everything else was fine.",
        "A: They had questions, and they said, were you aware of that \u2014 that it\u2019s a sky \u2014 spy\nship? I said, I wasn\u2019t ever aware of anything, I was in the hospital the whole time.\nCould you \u2014 could you verify this? I said, how can I verify it? If you have that the\nger \u2014 Russian lady, says 90 percent they were Russians. So, do you know the lady\u2019s\nname? You know how she looks? I says, I know how she looks, but I don\u2019t know\nher name. Anyway, so they let us go after three we \u2014 months. It\u2019s a long time, three\nmonths, but it was okay. Very tiresome for me to talk about this, but I really want to\ndo it. Then I came to the Bronx, in New York, to a\u2014 a \u2014 a far relation, a cousin\nremoved couple of times. So she took me in her wings \u2014 under her wings. And she\nAugust 26, 2016\nhad one bedroom, and the living room was a pull out couch, and that\u2019s where I\nslept. And she says, you know how to sew, you have to go to a factory, where you\nmake money. So I went to a dress shop, I made fairly enough, I paid my rent there,\nwas five dollars. And she cooked for me. And the boss of the store didn\u2019t pay, he\nwent bankrupt. It was not a union place. You know, it\u2019s amazing where I took the\nstrength, where I took the hope, after all this slapping in the \u2014 on the face, you\nknow? I mean, how much \u2014 how much can you take? I was 19 years old. How much\ncan you take? So I went to another shop, which was very successful. I was there for\n10 years. On a Hungarian New Year celebration, I met the young man. His name\nwas Sam Palkowitz, and he was a refugee too, but he was in this country already\ncouple years. He went to school to get his accountant CPA license. And at night he\nworked in a delicatessen, and so he finance his \u2014 himself with the money he made\nin the delicatessen. And after two years, we got married. He always said I married\nhim because he was legal here, that he had the green card. It\u2019s not true. Is not true.\nBut I told [indecipherable] oh my God, you know? It wasn\u2019t oh my God, but I\ndidn\u2019t have better offers. And so we were married, everything was fine, we had two\nchildren, and then Sam got the CPA degree. He went to work for a CPA fir-firm,\nand I got my high school equilency diploma, and I went to work for a bank. And I\nwas there for 13, 14 years, and became the \u2014 the manager of the bank. I stepped upAugust 26, 2016\nvery nicely. And we were fine. My son Arthur is an attorney, a part-time judge,\nand my daughter has her own real estate business. They all very successful, because\nI pushed them to no end. And I always said \u2014 and I\u2019m saying on a public speaking,\nthat knowledge is power. That\u2019s what it says on 42\u2122 Street, in the library, and it\u2019s\ntrue. That\u2019s the only thing no one can take it away from you. Everything else goes.\nAnd they listened to me. And then the kids grew up, they went to college, and\nwhatever. And I think getting from my birth, to getting to America, that\u2019s my story.\nLot of obstacles, lot of painful episodes, but that was the cards dealt to me. So, we\ncould go on to America now, but I said most of it, anyway. I don\u2019t want to go into\nAmerica, because I just said it, but I want to speak about my father.",
        "A: There was an announcement, that who is between 25 and 45 years of age, go to\nsomewhere, a stadium, or whatever, go and be there. Who doesn\u2019t come will be\nshot. So, we didn\u2019t know what, my father was 37, 38, and he went there, and they\ntook him to Kiev. On the \u2014 on the 30 degree cold \u2014 minus 30 degree, they made all\nof them, not only my father, work. Their work was to build a bridge, and the next\nday they \u2014 they blew up the bridge \u2014 the bridge. They used them as mined \u2014 you\nknow what\u2019s a mine?

        "A: Where the mines are, for the other soldiers to come. And they \u2014 they did that for\nmonths, and my father stepped on one of the mines, and took off one half of his leg.\nSo he was taken to the hospital. And then, that happened again, at the tail end. And\nthen the Germans pushed back the \u2014 the Russians pushed back the Germans, and the\nGermans had to leave, and before they left, they poured gasoline on the hospital,\nand burned it down.

        "A: Yes. Now, my \u2014 my Aunt Ella\u2019s husband, Emory(ph), had the father and a\nmother. The mother was a piano teacher, and the father had a store, it\u2019s like Ace\nHardware, but it was very specialized, very good business. And a very tall,\nhandsome Hungarian soldier came, with many decorations on his jacket, came to\nthe house, to that house where I showed you, and he said, Emory(ph) has to go to\n[indecipherable] my uncle has to go, but the father could be saved, if you write\nover the deed to me, the house deed. It was as quiet as now here. What do you do?\nSo my uncle said, listen, alive is more than a house, and he wrote over the deed to\nthe soldier. About a half a mile away, before the ink dried, they shot my grandpa\nand threw him out of the car. I went back, to try to get back, cause it\u2019s worth over\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 26, 2016\ntwo million dol-dollars now, and it\u2019s a legitimate transfer of deed ownership.

        "A: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 right, yeah.",
        "A: Yes. And this is just about the highlights. I could sit here and talk to you for\ndays, because I only put everything in a nutshell. But since that \u2014 when I was four\nyears old, and came out to America, it was nothing good, only bad. But not just a\nlittle bad, a drama. A thing where people don\u2019t get through easy. I went in America\nto \u2014 for 20 years, for clinical psychiatry studies. I had so much hatred in me. I had\nso \u2014 never wanted to forgive, never. But by psychiatrists I\u2019m told, if you forgive,\nyou release yourself, you are the winner. You don\u2019t hold the \u2014 the bitterness against\npeople. They \u2014 if you really \u2014 if you forgive them, you are the winner, not the other\npeople. And I felt that these people are educated, and smart, and \u2014 and \u2014 and for 20\nyears, I went to these meetings. Did I forgive? I don\u2019t know. Did I forget? No. But\nI\u2019m going on with my life. I\u2019m not a religious Jew, I\u2019m not. Never been. I do\nAugust 26, 2016\nbelieve in miracles, because the cross was a miracle. But, I cannot express what I\nfeel, because what I would say is not legitimate. But I thank whoever took care of\nme, and made that cross fell out from my purse. And whoever watched over me,\nand God did that, and I\u2019m very grateful for it. And if you have some question,\nplease answer me. Ans \u2014 ask me.",

And she sold that, and she made so much money. She liked me. She\npreferred I don\u2019t live there, because I was still a package from the previous\nmarriage. But if \u2014 I can\u2019t say that she was mean to me or anything. The sister was a\ndifferent story. The sister said that the father \u2014 my father loved me much more than\nloved her. And my stepmother used to say, no, it\u2019s not true. So, she had the \u2014 she\nAugust 26, 2016\nhas problems. She went back to Hungary to live, and my stepmother lived here in\nAmerica, married three times. If I want to be ugly, I would say, buried three\nhusband. But I have nothing to complain about her, nothing. So, past 20 years, I\nwent back to visit them. And she said, Daddy is looking down, and he\u2019s very happy\nthat you come and visit us.

When he needed some books or something, came to Ella and says, could you\nhelp me out? I give you back the money. So she gave him the money, and always\nhelped him. And \u2014 and I guess that\u2019s why he did what he did. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s\nwhat he did. And a good deed comes back. Good deed comes back to you. And you\nmust believe that. Maybe not that same day, or week, or month, or year, but in a\nAugust 26, 2016\nlifetime, what you do good, it will come back to you. And I\u2019m very fortunate, I have\nwonderful children. Wonderful children. Ambitious, and good, and \u2014 my son is 60\nyears old, was last week, and every mother says that, I think what I have the best\nchildren in the world. I\u2019m probably a little prejudiced, but that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s okay.\nAnd so are my grandchildren. I\u2019m very close to them. My husband died 15 years\nago.

It\u2019s a group which is built by the government, and\nteenagers, 12, 13, 14, 15 \u2014 and I go there every year \u2014 are pregnant. So this\norganization take them to high school, and teach them high school, and they\narranging a nursery for the children. And they were very down. I didn\u2019t say half of\nmy story. Less than half. But I encourage them that there is no choice not to do\nanything, because if you don\u2019t do anything, you\u2019re going backwards. And who\nwants to go backwards? Your child doesn\u2019t deserve for you to give up. So I gave a\npep talk, versus my talk. And it worked, it worked, the \u2014 some of them started to\ncry. They invited me every year, and \u2014 and that was the beginning. And then\nschools asked me to make speeches. And depends on the audience, depends on the\npeople how much do I say of the bitter life I had. Depends on that. I do not say\neverything. I say some. For instance, in Budapest, the soldiers took the women up\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 26, 2016\nto the ho \u2014 office, to do office work, but that wasn\u2019t office work. When they were\nfinding the second floor, third floor, five \u2014 fifth floor, it was two, three men raped\nthe women.

So this is \u2014 this is \u2014 this is a country occupation. It happens in every country.\nBut I wore the \u2014 I mean, I was so young, I wore a kerchief around my head, a black\nkerchief, so I look ugly \u2014 not that I\u2019m so beautiful, but I look ugly, and \u2014 and older,\nand didn\u2019t look anywhere like a \u2014 a retarded person I looked.

When\npeople came back, before this was put up, they dug with your \u2014 their hands to find\nrelatives, siblings, children, but very few was \u2014 even pieces of the bodies. So they\nput up this beautiful tree. The leaves are silver, and every leaf has a monogram.\n"
