        "Q: Could you tell me your name please?",
        "A: Niels Bamberger.",
        "Q: And where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in October 1928 in Germany. Wurzburg, Germany. And I was born, as an infant,\nmy parents fled Germany to Copenhagen 1n 1932, where my mother originally had come\nfrom. And, uh, she lived in...1n Germany for nine years, ten years. Then she went back to\nDenmark.",
        "Q: Why had she lived in Germany for ten years?",
        "A: Because she got married. She grew up in Denmark and lived in Denmark and then she\nmarried my father who lived in Germany and they were married in 1923 and then they went\nback to Denmark when it started to get...uh...with Hitler, and it started to get too hot in\nGermany. Then they went back to Denmark. And that's where I actually grew up and lived\nhalf of my life.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me about...what did your father do? What was his occupation?",
        "A: Well, in Denmark he had an antique store. He had an art store; and they started that like in\n1935-36 in Copenhagen, 'til we fled to Sweden in 1943.",
        "Q: Tell me if you would about growing up in Copenhagen before the Germans came, in the\n'30s?",
        "A: I went to a non-Jewish school. I was...I wouldn't say I was the only Jew in school, but we\nwere probably two or three fellows and the school was from 8 to 2 every day and then in the\nafternoon, we went for Hebrew...for Hebrew lessons or Hebrew school for another two, three\nhours. So we came back...we came home like 5:30, 6:00 every night and did our homework.\nAnd that was the same routine. Of course, we had no schools Saturday or Sunday. Then we\nwere off and we went to football games and bicycling and things like that. Whatever we did\nwith my friends.",
        "Q: What was your...your parents' home like. Did you practice...?",
        "A: Well, we had a house in Copenhagen, in the center of Copenhagen. We had our own house\nthat had belonged to my grandfather and great grandfather. It's still standing there now. And\nit's probably two or three hundred years old. And we had a big apartment on the second\nfloor. There were other people living in the house and then there were stores. There were\nstores on the ground floor. And we had a synagogue that had been there for more than one\nhundred years also started by my great-grandfather on...in the same house we had that.",
        "Q: In the same house?",
        "A: Yes. And it's still there. It's not anymore there today because it was given to the city of\nCopenhagen.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me how that worked? That is were you...you must have been heavily...your\nfamily was heavily involved in that synagogue?",
        "A: Yes. We were very...I was brought up very Orthodox; and, of course, my parents were too.\nMy grandfather was a Rabbi, and my brother is a Rabbi today. So that's the way we grew\nup. We...we had a very good life. Like Tove said. And uh...we had no problems\nwhatsoever all the time. Not money-wise or economic or we had no problem until it started\nin October '43, and the Germans had been in the country for three years from '40 to '43.",
        "Q: Hold it for one minute. Before we get to the Germans, I would like to know a little more\nabout your being Jewish in Copenhagen. And you were so closely involved in the\nsynagogue. What...what did your Jewish life consist of? What kinds of things did you do?\nHolidays, services, what?",
        "A: We had services every day in our synagogue. And, of course, we had the sabbath, the\nJewish Sabbath every week, and we had the Jewish holidays. And uh...the reason our\nsynagogue was started originally of...by my great grandfather or grandfather was that he\ndidn't think that the big synagogue--they have a beautiful, large synagogue in Copenhagen--\nbut that wasn't Orthodox enough hundred years ago. They started with, uh...different\nreformed things; and they cut this prayer out and they cut this one out. And that's when my\ngrandfather started his own synagogue, so to speak. And like I said, it still...it still can be\nseen. It's in the museum in Copenhagen...the city. You see them in Copenhagen. They\nhave...they removed everything when the house was sold a couple of years ago. It...like I\nsaid, it's a very old building, and it's in the heart of the city. And there was no money to pay\nthe taxes and the roof was falling apart so to speak and...uh...then it was sold. The house was\nsold, and the synagogue was removed. And that's the story. Today, it's just an old,\nuh...landmark building in the center of Copenhagen that's being owned by a private man or\ncorporation. I don't know who has it today.",
        "Q: Uh, in growing up in such a very...in a Orthodox Jewish home, did you feel differently? Did\nyou feel you were treated differently than your Christian neighbors?",
        "A: Not at all. They were my friends. And, uh...we went together for this or for that and we had\nbirthday parties and we went to ball games and things like that, I said before. And, uh...there\nwas no difference. Nobody ever mentioned anything about Jewish or non-Jewish. We were\nall the same. We were citizens of Denmark and that's all they cared about. Nobody said you\nare Jewish or you are not Jewish. That made no difference to us.",
        "Q: When the Germans invaded in 1940, you would have been 12 years old?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Uh, what can you tell me about, uh...the invasion itself? What do you remember?",
        "A: Well, we know that, uh, there were soldiers all over. And they threw out leaflets all over the\ncity, all over the country that people could just go now and don't make any uproar.\nEverything will continue the way it was. Of course, everything became rationed or rationed\nwhatever. And...uh... we were in school that day. We saw loads and loads of planes,\nbombing planes coming one after...I mean hundreds and hundreds of planes coming in and\nGermans on motorcycles, horses, dragging cannons and the big tanks all over the place. It\ndidn't take more than a couple of hours \u2018til they took over the country. Like I said they [the\nDanes] couldn't resist. Denmark was a very small country. And, uh...life went on as before,\nexcept that that you are not allowed to walk on this side of the street in front of the bank.\nThey would post soldiers with, uh...guns and...and steel helmets and things like that in front\nof the banks and the hotels and important institutions that they wanted to guard. But besides\nthat nothing happened really. The police was in force and the Danish Army was...although\nthey were there, they had not much to say or to do, but they were all...life was continuing the\nway it was. Everything got rationed and we had to buy butter and bread and gasoline, all the\nthings. You couldn't go out and buy whatever you wanted, but there was plenty of it around.\nThe Germans took away whatever they needed, but there was still plenty. Denmark is a\ndairy country, so there was plenty of food for everybody. And then in...uh...1in 1943, they\ntook the...they arrested all the police and the Army. They took them away in August of '43.\nThat's when we know...knew something was going to happen. They took them away and\ninterned them all in camps and took their weapons away and then they said that 1t was the\npolice's fault and the army. Then all of a sudden they switched over and they said that it's all\nthe Jews' fault. I mean they didn't say it, but we knew that something was going to happen.",
        "Q: How? Tell me what your life had been like in those three years and then we will continue.",
        "A: The same thing like before. We went to school. We had food. We had all holidays.\nAnd...uh...we went to Hebrew school, went to regular school. There was no difference so to\nspeak except that...uh...we saw the Germans all over. And...uh...everybody despised them.\nThey still do today. When the Germans go to Denmark with their big cars and so on, nobody\nlikes them there. But otherwise, everything continued the way it had been til '43. I think it\nwas August '43 that...uh...they took, the Germans...they took the police force and the soldiers\nand interned everybody and...uh... August...and October Ist, I believe it was Rosh Hashanah,\nthey had been in to pick up the...all the files from the Jewish... uh...community. They had all\nthe names, all the addresses of everyone in Copenhagen, which was about 6,000 Jews and\nthey had.... They knew where they lived, what they did, their business. They had\neverything. And we were informed in the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah, the first day of\nRosh Hashanah, we were informed that nobody should go home because the Germans are\ngoing to round you up the night between the Ist and the 2nd of October. And those who\nbelieved it, which most of the people did, we were all scared. They...uh...didn't go home.\nWe all had made arrangements with some non-Jews, some Danish where we could stay or\nwhere to sleep. Those who didn't believe it. They were taken, which was a very small\npercentage anyhow. And they all came back after the war. So we went to our grocer who\nwas a bachelor and he said, \"Come to my house and I'll take care of you.\" So after the\nsynagogue, we went to him and he bought us, or he had in his store bread and butter and\ncheese and milk and eggs, whatever we needed. He took care of us for a week til we found a\nconnection how to get out of the country. Copenhagen 1s on the seashore and we went up to\nSnekkersten, same place and where most of them went from. Everybody went to Sweden\nfrom there because it's the narrowest point between Denmark and Sweden. It's like three,\nfour miles wide. That's the whole thing...the waterway. But it is very heavy stream there.\nIt's a very heavy...uh... waterway. So we stayed in his house and....",
        "Q: In whose.... Excuse me. How...first of all, how did you get to Snekkersten?",
        "A: How did we get there? Well, he called up every day. He called up somebody that he knew\nfrom the resistance movement and he didn't say...we went with...I went with my parents and\nmy two brothers and a sister. We were six people altogether. And he wouldn't say that he\nhas some people to send. He didn't know if this telephone was...uh...what do you call it?",
        "Q: Tapped?",
        "A: Tapped!",
        "Q: This is your grocer calling?",
        "A: Yes. So he called up. He said, \"I have six tons of potatoes. Could you come and pick them\nup?\" 'Til he finally got a connection. And uh...it took us about a week, until the day before\nYom Kippur. And then we got a tax1; and the taxi took us up to that place up in Snekkersten,\nwhere everybody had been collected, so to speak. All the people were there. There were\ntwo or three hundred people there everyday, four hundred people maybe in somebody's\nhome, in a basement. And I remember as a child that...uh...we were covered up in the taxi\nwith...uh...a blanket in case the police would stop and say, \"What's wrong? What do you\nhave in there?\" He would say, \"I have a sick person. Just close the door. I have to go to the\nhospital.\" So we were covered up and he went up there. It's not more than 30, 40 minute\nride by taxi. We went up there. We came to that house. And...uh...we met somebody from\nthe resistance movement who took us down to the pier at night, and we came down there and\nwe were told that the boat we were supposed to go with had been taken by somebody else\nwho paid more money for it.\nHe paid a big sum of money, so he took this man out by himself...the fishing boat. So we\nhad to wait til the next day and...uh...the next day, luckily for us it had been organized this\nway that the resistance movement had a big schooner-like; and they took two or three\nhundred people aboard. We went all down...down below deck, and uh...we went out there\nby row boats. It wasn't far out to the ship and when they had all the people there, first we\npaid them money. We paid like 2,000 krone a person. That was the going rate. Which was\na lot of money at that time; but we were told if you come to Sweden the money 1s worthless.\nYou can't do anything with it. You might as well leave it here, number 1, and number 2,\nwhatever money you give now will help those people who are poor or sick and can't afford\nit. They will also get out. Everybody got out, whether they had money or not. They were\nall helped to get out. And we got aboard that ship and, uh... we got off. We sailed\nalso...uh...for an hour or so at midnight and in the middle of the ocean we had this big\nSwedish torpedo boat or gunboat coming towards us. We all thought it was the Germans,\nbut it was the Swedish boat. They had the same kind of uniforms and they helped us all off,\non the Swedish ship. We got aboard the Swedish ship and they gave us coffee and candy or\nwhatever, and then we went into Sweden. And we were saved.\n(cough) So when we arrived in Sweden, we were all listed by names. They wanted to know\nwho is coming and here that they didn't have any German helpers or whoever. We were all\nlisted by name and address and age and so on. And we came there on the night of Yom\nKippur or the day before Yom Kippur, which was very unpleasant for us. We got food. We\ngot clothing. We had nothing along except what we wore. We had no...we had nothing\nalong with us. Just what we had on! And...uh...I[ remember that we went to...we were in a\ncamp, a big camp that was guarded by the Swedish soldiers, and we could go freely. We\ncould go in and out the way we wanted. We wanted, of course, my father wanted to go to\nthe synagogue--which was like 10, 12 miles away. And we all walked in there, on Yom\nKippur morning, into Halsingborg. We walked in there to synagogue and we....",
        "Q: You walked 12 miles just to go to synagogue?",
        "A: Yes. And we attended the services, a full day of services, without food. And uh...in the\nmiddle of the afternoon, a girl came in with a bus, a big bus; and they interrupted the\nservices. And they said that all the people from Denmark, all the refugees who are here in\nthe synagogue, should immediately come out to the bus and go back to camp. They had left\nthe camp and we should go back. So my father said, \"Now that we have been saved from the\nGermans, we are not going to go on a bus on Yom Kippur.\" We were not used to that.\n(Laughing) So we waited until after the services were over at night, and then somebody took\nus home from the synagogue. Somebody drove us back to the camp. And when we came\nback to camp, we were told, \"You have to leave tonight. Because you didn't come back with\nthe girl that was sent with the bus, so you have to leave tonight.\" And uh...we had no money\nor anything. So we went to the railroad station; and somebody bought us the tickets to\nMalmo, where my father had a cousin. So we came there in the middle of the night, 2 or 3\no'clock in the morning. But we were very lucky. We were saved. We were happy. And\nuh...then we got an apartment there eventually. Little by little, my parents started a\nrestaurant. On the card I gave you, you can see that from that time. My parents started a\nrestaurant, because my mother felt if she makes food for other people--she was a very good\ncook--then there'll be enough for us to eat, also. And we all got jobs for October, November,\nDecember; and in January, the school opened...a Danish school for the...for the refugees--\nchildren, or so to speak. And we went to school there where we had left it off 1n Denmark\nand continued in Sweden. We...it was in Lund. We went there by train every day, which\nwas a 20, 25-minute train ride and we got the train...the, uh, tickets from the government,\nand we got pocket money. Each one got pocket money; and on Sunday, in order to make\nsomething extra for us, or to help our parents, we made...I remember that I delivered flowers.\nI worked in a flower shop, and delivered flowers as a boy. I was 15 years old, so I made\nextra money that way. And we were very happy there. We had all the goodies that we didn't\nhave in Denmark. They didn't have bananas and oranges and chocolate and chewing gum.\nWe didn't have in Denmark anymore at that time, so we could buy that in Sweden. Not that\nit was so important, but, uh...there was plenty of everything. Sweden was neutral, and they\nkept on importing whatever you wanted. They had everything. And that's actually what\nhappened to us in Sweden. We were there for...we were there for close to two years, 'til May\n'45. Everybody went back to Denmark. We were very happy. On May 4th, when we [were]\ntold that the Germans gave up in Denmark and Norway, Holland, Belgium...uh, we went\nback.... Everybody was celebrating. And the 28th of May everybody went back on the ferry\nboats to Denmark. And when we came back to Denmark, each one...there were all the\nDanes were there, and we all got money. Not a lot of money, but we got some money. So\nwe could take a taxi or bus or whatever home. Each person got some money from the\nDanish government. And I remember we came home to our apartment and found everything\nthe way we had left it--except, of course, there were mice and spiders and all kinds of things.\nBut the food was on the table, in the pots. Nobody had been into the apartment. Everything\nwas the way we left it. And the synagogue that I mentioned before, our lawyer had taken\naway the torah scrolls and hidden them in a...what you say, in a vault? Safety vault, in a\nbank. And they were all...everything was left the way, the way...uh...everything came back\nthe way we left it two years earlier. What else?",
        "Q: Was your father involved at all in...uh...the brigade? When you were in Sweden, was your\nfather involved at all in the brigade that was being formed?",
        "A: No. I applied for it, but I was only, uh...15 years old, or going on 16, and I was too young.\nThey wouldn't take anybody below 18. And my father was actually too old. [In] '43, he was\nalmost 60 at that time. So they had enough young people and what they actually needed\nthem for.... There was no fighting when we came back. What they needed them for was to\nclean up after the Germans, and take the weapons away and count this and count that. And\nthe uniforms...whatever they had. My father was too old, and I was too young, so to speak;\nso they didn't take me.",
        "Q: What did you do when you came back to Denmark?",
        "A: I went back to school. I continued school where I had left off and...uh...there was no... I\nshouldn't say hard feelings. Everybody was...they were all helping us, all the time in\nDenmark. All the non-Jews were helping the Jews. There was no difference; and I am sure\ntoday they would just say, \"You are Danish citizens. You are the same as we are.\" Nobody\nwould ever ask, \"Are you Jewish? Are you black? Are you Chinese?\" They don't care.\nAnd they helped everybody there.",
        "Q: What kind of help did you receive?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: What kind of help did you receive as a family?",
        "A: Well, we had to get back on our feet. We had to...uh...get back to school and clean up in the\nhouse and buy new clothes and furniture or whatever we needed there. And my parents got\nback in their business which had been rented out to somebody while we were away, and the\nsame business they got back again when we came back from...when we came back from\nSweden. They continued that. (long sigh) I had my friends. They were all very helpful to\nme. And we spoke about Sweden. And they told us what had been going on in Denmark\nduring the war. The synagogue...the big synagogue in Copenhagen which is one of the most\nbeautiful one in the world had been used for the German refugees. They had taken\neverything out and put beds or cots in there and they had all the Germans who were invalids\nand sick people. They put them in there. That had to be cleaned up. And the synagogue\nwas brought back into order in a very short time. And while this was going on, they used our\nsynagogue in...1n my parents' house. That was used as the big synagogue so to speak. So we\nhave pictures from that also...from that synagogue. Should I mention about that pin?",
        "Q: Yes. Please do.",
        "A: This pin?",
        "Q: Tell us about the pin you are wearing?",
        "A: Well, this is made by...it was made during the war by George Hensen. It was made in silver\nand this one was made in gold and enamel. It was made for the King Christian X who was\none of the biggest heroes, I would say, during the war. Uh... whatever money it cost to make\nit...the excess money that was left over, went to the resistance movement. That's the\nway...almost every Dane had it or supported it this way. There are not many left of them\ntoday. It was made in 1940 for the King's 70th birthday. There are not many left because\nfirst of all, people needed money and they sold them for the value of the silver or gold during\nthe war, but they are back in style today, and I have this from my father. That's why I\nwear...that's why I am wearing it now. The King Christian the Tenth, they always told\nstories about the King, about the Jewish Star, that first of all, he was riding around on a horse\neveryday unescorted by himself. Every morning he would take the same route. Anyone\ncould have killed him as easy as nothing, but he was not afraid. And the King said if the\nJews ever have to wear the...uh...the Jewish star, the six-pointed Jewish star where it said\nJew on it, he would be the first one to wear it, but it never materialized during the war. It\nnever happened. What else can I....",
        "Q: Okay. Is there anything else you want to add?",
        "A: Well, I would say that the Danes are great people. And one of the few countries...one of the\nfew nations that did more than their share to help the Jews all over the world and they... am\nsure they would repeat the same thing and do it today again if it happened, if it should\nhappen that they would be willing to help with money, deeds and everything. They are very\nunselfish and they are not asking for any thank you or anything in public by anyone. They\nnever did.",
        "Q: Okay. On that note, I thank you very much.",
        "A: Not at all. My pleasure. That's it?",
        "Q: Okay. Thank you. I am glad we got in about the pin.",
        "A: I think it was important.",
        "Q: Yes. I think we do actually. Okay. If you sit still, they are going to bring the camera in and\nthey'll take a picture of the pin and then maybe we'll have Arnold take a picture of it as well.\nWe have a gentlemen who is going to take your photograph. The film has stopped. We\nhave a gentleman who will take your photographs.",
        "A: How long did this take? 45 minutes? I don't remember. I don't remember everything\ntogether at one time.",
        "Q: Well, it all came together very neatly.",
        "A: Okay. As long as you are satisfied.",
        "Q: I am very happy. Okay. We need you to be very still. They are going to bring a zoom lens\nin and...uh...take picture just of the pin. You don't move for a few seconds and they will...",
        "A: Now?",
        "Q: Yal. Just don't move for a little bit, and they got a different lens on the camera and they are\ndoing funny things to it so that... They are doing fancy things to the zoom lens so they can\nget a close up of that pin. It's a wonderful story, that pin...and...uh. Okay. If you would\nexplain the story of the pin now. Don't move. Just explain it because we are right in on that?",
        "A: The pin was made in 1940. It was made by George Hensen, silversmith, for the King's--who\nwas Christian the Tenth--70th birthday, and all the money, the excess money above the cost\nof the pin went to the resistance movement. The pin was made in gold and it was also made\nin silver and enamel. And it was sold almost by any silversmith or silver shop in\nCopenhagen. I should say in Denmark, all over Denmark. It was sold for raising, in order to\nraise money for the resistance movement.",
        "Q: Okay. Could you point to the pin please?",
        "A: Point to it?",
        "Q: Just point to it.",

        "A: Niels Bamberger.",
        "A: I was born in October 1928 in Germany. Wurzburg, Germany. And I was born, as an infant,\nmy parents fled Germany to Copenhagen 1n 1932, where my mother originally had come\nfrom. And, uh, she lived in...1n Germany for nine years, ten years. Then she went back to\nDenmark.",
        "A: Because she got married. She grew up in Denmark and lived in Denmark and then she\nmarried my father who lived in Germany and they were married in 1923 and then they went\nback to Denmark when it started to get...uh...with Hitler, and it started to get too hot in\nGermany. Then they went back to Denmark. And that's where I actually grew up and lived\nhalf of my life.",
        "A: Well, in Denmark he had an antique store. He had an art store; and they started that like in\n1935-36 in Copenhagen, 'til we fled to Sweden in 1943.",
        "A: I went to a non-Jewish school. I was...I wouldn't say I was the only Jew in school, but we\nwere probably two or three fellows and the school was from 8 to 2 every day and then in the\nafternoon, we went for Hebrew...for Hebrew lessons or Hebrew school for another two, three\nhours. So we came back...we came home like 5:30, 6:00 every night and did our homework.\nAnd that was the same routine. Of course, we had no schools Saturday or Sunday. Then we\nwere off and we went to football games and bicycling and things like that. Whatever we did\nwith my friends.",
        "A: Well, we had a house in Copenhagen, in the center of Copenhagen. We had our own house\nthat had belonged to my grandfather and great grandfather. It's still standing there now. And\nit's probably two or three hundred years old. And we had a big apartment on the second\nfloor. There were other people living in the house and then there were stores. There were\nstores on the ground floor. And we had a synagogue that had been there for more than one\nhundred years also started by my great-grandfather on...in the same house we had that.",
        "A: Yes. And it's still there. It's not anymore there today because it was given to the city of\nCopenhagen.",
        "A: Yes. We were very...I was brought up very Orthodox; and, of course, my parents were too.\nMy grandfather was a Rabbi, and my brother is a Rabbi today. So that's the way we grew\nup. We...we had a very good life. Like Tove said. And uh...we had no problems\nwhatsoever all the time. Not money-wise or economic or we had no problem until it started\nin October '43, and the Germans had been in the country for three years from '40 to '43.",
        "A: We had services every day in our synagogue. And, of course, we had the sabbath, the\nJewish Sabbath every week, and we had the Jewish holidays. And uh...the reason our\nsynagogue was started originally of...by my great grandfather or grandfather was that he\ndidn't think that the big synagogue--they have a beautiful, large synagogue in Copenhagen--\nbut that wasn't Orthodox enough hundred years ago. They started with, uh...different\nreformed things; and they cut this prayer out and they cut this one out. And that's when my\ngrandfather started his own synagogue, so to speak. And like I said, it still...it still can be\nseen. It's in the museum in Copenhagen...the city. You see them in Copenhagen. They\nhave...they removed everything when the house was sold a couple of years ago. It...like I\nsaid, it's a very old building, and it's in the heart of the city. And there was no money to pay\nthe taxes and the roof was falling apart so to speak and...uh...then it was sold. The house was\nsold, and the synagogue was removed. And that's the story. Today, it's just an old,\nuh...landmark building in the center of Copenhagen that's being owned by a private man or\ncorporation. I don't know who has it today.",
        "A: Not at all. They were my friends. And, uh...we went together for this or for that and we had\nbirthday parties and we went to ball games and things like that, I said before. And, uh...there\nwas no difference. Nobody ever mentioned anything about Jewish or non-Jewish. We were\nall the same. We were citizens of Denmark and that's all they cared about. Nobody said you\nare Jewish or you are not Jewish. That made no difference to us.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, we know that, uh, there were soldiers all over. And they threw out leaflets all over the\ncity, all over the country that people could just go now and don't make any uproar.\nEverything will continue the way it was. Of course, everything became rationed or rationed\nwhatever. And...uh... we were in school that day. We saw loads and loads of planes,\nbombing planes coming one after...I mean hundreds and hundreds of planes coming in and\nGermans on motorcycles, horses, dragging cannons and the big tanks all over the place. It\ndidn't take more than a couple of hours \u2018til they took over the country. Like I said they [the\nDanes] couldn't resist. Denmark was a very small country. And, uh...life went on as before,\nexcept that that you are not allowed to walk on this side of the street in front of the bank.\nThey would post soldiers with, uh...guns and...and steel helmets and things like that in front\nof the banks and the hotels and important institutions that they wanted to guard. But besides\nthat nothing happened really. The police was in force and the Danish Army was...although\nthey were there, they had not much to say or to do, but they were all...life was continuing the\nway it was. Everything got rationed and we had to buy butter and bread and gasoline, all the\nthings. You couldn't go out and buy whatever you wanted, but there was plenty of it around.\nThe Germans took away whatever they needed, but there was still plenty. Denmark is a\ndairy country, so there was plenty of food for everybody. And then in...uh...1in 1943, they\ntook the...they arrested all the police and the Army. They took them away in August of '43.\nThat's when we know...knew something was going to happen. They took them away and\ninterned them all in camps and took their weapons away and then they said that 1t was the\npolice's fault and the army. Then all of a sudden they switched over and they said that it's all\nthe Jews' fault. I mean they didn't say it, but we knew that something was going to happen.",
        "A: The same thing like before. We went to school. We had food. We had all holidays.\nAnd...uh...we went to Hebrew school, went to regular school. There was no difference so to\nspeak except that...uh...we saw the Germans all over. And...uh...everybody despised them.\nThey still do today. When the Germans go to Denmark with their big cars and so on, nobody\nlikes them there. But otherwise, everything continued the way it had been til '43. I think it\nwas August '43 that...uh...they took, the Germans...they took the police force and the soldiers\nand interned everybody and...uh... August...and October Ist, I believe it was Rosh Hashanah,\nthey had been in to pick up the...all the files from the Jewish... uh...community. They had all\nthe names, all the addresses of everyone in Copenhagen, which was about 6,000 Jews and\nthey had.... They knew where they lived, what they did, their business. They had\neverything. And we were informed in the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah, the first day of\nRosh Hashanah, we were informed that nobody should go home because the Germans are\ngoing to round you up the night between the Ist and the 2nd of October. And those who\nbelieved it, which most of the people did, we were all scared. They...uh...didn't go home.\nWe all had made arrangements with some non-Jews, some Danish where we could stay or\nwhere to sleep. Those who didn't believe it. They were taken, which was a very small\npercentage anyhow. And they all came back after the war. So we went to our grocer who\nwas a bachelor and he said, \"Come to my house and I'll take care of you.\" So after the\nsynagogue, we went to him and he bought us, or he had in his store bread and butter and\ncheese and milk and eggs, whatever we needed. He took care of us for a week til we found a\nconnection how to get out of the country. Copenhagen 1s on the seashore and we went up to\nSnekkersten, same place and where most of them went from. Everybody went to Sweden\nfrom there because it's the narrowest point between Denmark and Sweden. It's like three,\nfour miles wide. That's the whole thing...the waterway. But it is very heavy stream there.\nIt's a very heavy...uh... waterway. So we stayed in his house and....",
        "A: How did we get there? Well, he called up every day. He called up somebody that he knew\nfrom the resistance movement and he didn't say...we went with...I went with my parents and\nmy two brothers and a sister. We were six people altogether. And he wouldn't say that he\nhas some people to send. He didn't know if this telephone was...uh...what do you call it?",
        "A: Tapped!",
        "A: Yes. So he called up. He said, \"I have six tons of potatoes. Could you come and pick them\nup?\" 'Til he finally got a connection. And uh...it took us about a week, until the day before\nYom Kippur. And then we got a tax1; and the taxi took us up to that place up in Snekkersten,\nwhere everybody had been collected, so to speak. All the people were there. There were\ntwo or three hundred people there everyday, four hundred people maybe in somebody's\nhome, in a basement. And I remember as a child that...uh...we were covered up in the taxi\nwith...uh...a blanket in case the police would stop and say, \"What's wrong? What do you\nhave in there?\" He would say, \"I have a sick person. Just close the door. I have to go to the\nhospital.\" So we were covered up and he went up there. It's not more than 30, 40 minute\nride by taxi. We went up there. We came to that house. And...uh...we met somebody from\nthe resistance movement who took us down to the pier at night, and we came down there and\nwe were told that the boat we were supposed to go with had been taken by somebody else\nwho paid more money for it.\nHe paid a big sum of money, so he took this man out by himself...the fishing boat. So we\nhad to wait til the next day and...uh...the next day, luckily for us it had been organized this\nway that the resistance movement had a big schooner-like; and they took two or three\nhundred people aboard. We went all down...down below deck, and uh...we went out there\nby row boats. It wasn't far out to the ship and when they had all the people there, first we\npaid them money. We paid like 2,000 krone a person. That was the going rate. Which was\na lot of money at that time; but we were told if you come to Sweden the money 1s worthless.\nYou can't do anything with it. You might as well leave it here, number 1, and number 2,\nwhatever money you give now will help those people who are poor or sick and can't afford\nit. They will also get out. Everybody got out, whether they had money or not. They were\nall helped to get out. And we got aboard that ship and, uh... we got off. We sailed\nalso...uh...for an hour or so at midnight and in the middle of the ocean we had this big\nSwedish torpedo boat or gunboat coming towards us. We all thought it was the Germans,\nbut it was the Swedish boat. They had the same kind of uniforms and they helped us all off,\non the Swedish ship. We got aboard the Swedish ship and they gave us coffee and candy or\nwhatever, and then we went into Sweden. And we were saved.\n(cough) So when we arrived in Sweden, we were all listed by names. They wanted to know\nwho is coming and here that they didn't have any German helpers or whoever. We were all\nlisted by name and address and age and so on. And we came there on the night of Yom\nKippur or the day before Yom Kippur, which was very unpleasant for us. We got food. We\ngot clothing. We had nothing along except what we wore. We had no...we had nothing\nalong with us. Just what we had on! And...uh...I[ remember that we went to...we were in a\ncamp, a big camp that was guarded by the Swedish soldiers, and we could go freely. We\ncould go in and out the way we wanted. We wanted, of course, my father wanted to go to\nthe synagogue--which was like 10, 12 miles away. And we all walked in there, on Yom\nKippur morning, into Halsingborg. We walked in there to synagogue and we....",
        "A: Yes. And we attended the services, a full day of services, without food. And uh...in the\nmiddle of the afternoon, a girl came in with a bus, a big bus; and they interrupted the\nservices. And they said that all the people from Denmark, all the refugees who are here in\nthe synagogue, should immediately come out to the bus and go back to camp. They had left\nthe camp and we should go back. So my father said, \"Now that we have been saved from the\nGermans, we are not going to go on a bus on Yom Kippur.\" We were not used to that.\n(Laughing) So we waited until after the services were over at night, and then somebody took\nus home from the synagogue. Somebody drove us back to the camp. And when we came\nback to camp, we were told, \"You have to leave tonight. Because you didn't come back with\nthe girl that was sent with the bus, so you have to leave tonight.\" And uh...we had no money\nor anything. So we went to the railroad station; and somebody bought us the tickets to\nMalmo, where my father had a cousin. So we came there in the middle of the night, 2 or 3\no'clock in the morning. But we were very lucky. We were saved. We were happy. And\nuh...then we got an apartment there eventually. Little by little, my parents started a\nrestaurant. On the card I gave you, you can see that from that time. My parents started a\nrestaurant, because my mother felt if she makes food for other people--she was a very good\ncook--then there'll be enough for us to eat, also. And we all got jobs for October, November,\nDecember; and in January, the school opened...a Danish school for the...for the refugees--\nchildren, or so to speak. And we went to school there where we had left it off 1n Denmark\nand continued in Sweden. We...it was in Lund. We went there by train every day, which\nwas a 20, 25-minute train ride and we got the train...the, uh, tickets from the government,\nand we got pocket money. Each one got pocket money; and on Sunday, in order to make\nsomething extra for us, or to help our parents, we made...I remember that I delivered flowers.\nI worked in a flower shop, and delivered flowers as a boy. I was 15 years old, so I made\nextra money that way. And we were very happy there. We had all the goodies that we didn't\nhave in Denmark. They didn't have bananas and oranges and chocolate and chewing gum.\nWe didn't have in Denmark anymore at that time, so we could buy that in Sweden. Not that\nit was so important, but, uh...there was plenty of everything. Sweden was neutral, and they\nkept on importing whatever you wanted. They had everything. And that's actually what\nhappened to us in Sweden. We were there for...we were there for close to two years, 'til May\n'45. Everybody went back to Denmark. We were very happy. On May 4th, when we [were]\ntold that the Germans gave up in Denmark and Norway, Holland, Belgium...uh, we went\nback.... Everybody was celebrating. And the 28th of May everybody went back on the ferry\nboats to Denmark. And when we came back to Denmark, each one...there were all the\nDanes were there, and we all got money. Not a lot of money, but we got some money. So\nwe could take a taxi or bus or whatever home. Each person got some money from the\nDanish government. And I remember we came home to our apartment and found everything\nthe way we had left it--except, of course, there were mice and spiders and all kinds of things.\nBut the food was on the table, in the pots. Nobody had been into the apartment. Everything\nwas the way we left it. And the synagogue that I mentioned before, our lawyer had taken\naway the torah scrolls and hidden them in a...what you say, in a vault? Safety vault, in a\nbank. And they were all...everything was left the way, the way...uh...everything came back\nthe way we left it two years earlier. What else?",
        "A: No. I applied for it, but I was only, uh...15 years old, or going on 16, and I was too young.\nThey wouldn't take anybody below 18. And my father was actually too old. [In] '43, he was\nalmost 60 at that time. So they had enough young people and what they actually needed\nthem for.... There was no fighting when we came back. What they needed them for was to\nclean up after the Germans, and take the weapons away and count this and count that. And\nthe uniforms...whatever they had. My father was too old, and I was too young, so to speak;\nso they didn't take me.",
        "A: I went back to school. I continued school where I had left off and...uh...there was no... I\nshouldn't say hard feelings. Everybody was...they were all helping us, all the time in\nDenmark. All the non-Jews were helping the Jews. There was no difference; and I am sure\ntoday they would just say, \"You are Danish citizens. You are the same as we are.\" Nobody\nwould ever ask, \"Are you Jewish? Are you black? Are you Chinese?\" They don't care.\nAnd they helped everybody there.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: Well, we had to get back on our feet. We had to...uh...get back to school and clean up in the\nhouse and buy new clothes and furniture or whatever we needed there. And my parents got\nback in their business which had been rented out to somebody while we were away, and the\nsame business they got back again when we came back from...when we came back from\nSweden. They continued that. (long sigh) I had my friends. They were all very helpful to\nme. And we spoke about Sweden. And they told us what had been going on in Denmark\nduring the war. The synagogue...the big synagogue in Copenhagen which is one of the most\nbeautiful one in the world had been used for the German refugees. They had taken\neverything out and put beds or cots in there and they had all the Germans who were invalids\nand sick people. They put them in there. That had to be cleaned up. And the synagogue\nwas brought back into order in a very short time. And while this was going on, they used our\nsynagogue in...1n my parents' house. That was used as the big synagogue so to speak. So we\nhave pictures from that also...from that synagogue. Should I mention about that pin?",
        "A: This pin?",
        "A: Well, this is made by...it was made during the war by George Hensen. It was made in silver\nand this one was made in gold and enamel. It was made for the King Christian X who was\none of the biggest heroes, I would say, during the war. Uh... whatever money it cost to make\nit...the excess money that was left over, went to the resistance movement. That's the\nway...almost every Dane had it or supported it this way. There are not many left of them\ntoday. It was made in 1940 for the King's 70th birthday. There are not many left because\nfirst of all, people needed money and they sold them for the value of the silver or gold during\nthe war, but they are back in style today, and I have this from my father. That's why I\nwear...that's why I am wearing it now. The King Christian the Tenth, they always told\nstories about the King, about the Jewish Star, that first of all, he was riding around on a horse\neveryday unescorted by himself. Every morning he would take the same route. Anyone\ncould have killed him as easy as nothing, but he was not afraid. And the King said if the\nJews ever have to wear the...uh...the Jewish star, the six-pointed Jewish star where it said\nJew on it, he would be the first one to wear it, but it never materialized during the war. It\nnever happened. What else can I....",
        "A: Well, I would say that the Danes are great people. And one of the few countries...one of the\nfew nations that did more than their share to help the Jews all over the world and they... am\nsure they would repeat the same thing and do it today again if it happened, if it should\nhappen that they would be willing to help with money, deeds and everything. They are very\nunselfish and they are not asking for any thank you or anything in public by anyone. They\nnever did.",
        "A: Not at all. My pleasure. That's it?",
        "A: I think it was important.",
        "A: How long did this take? 45 minutes? I don't remember. I don't remember everything\ntogether at one time.",
        "A: Okay. As long as you are satisfied.",
        "A: Now?",
        "A: The pin was made in 1940. It was made by George Hensen, silversmith, for the King's--who\nwas Christian the Tenth--70th birthday, and all the money, the excess money above the cost\nof the pin went to the resistance movement. The pin was made in gold and it was also made\nin silver and enamel. And it was sold almost by any silversmith or silver shop in\nCopenhagen. I should say in Denmark, all over Denmark. It was sold for raising, in order to\nraise money for the resistance movement.",
        "A: Point to it?",
        "A: This one here?",
        "A: That's it? Thank you.",
        "A: I am glad you have it now.\n"
