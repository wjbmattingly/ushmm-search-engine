        "Q: Mrs. Gach, uh thank you for coming to visit with us this morning. We're going to be\nasking you uh to share with us some of your experiences as you recall them, and perhaps\nthe best way to begin is to ask you to tell us your name and a little about your early life in\nBudapest.",
        "A: OK. My name 1s Lilly Brust Gach. I was born in uh Hungary in Europe, Hungary,\nBudapest, and uh I had a brother who was younger than I myself, __ three years and uh\nwe had a wonderful, happy family life and childhood. Beautiful. Well educated, if I may\nsay so myself, both of us. Uh we had elementary school. Naturally we started with that.\nWe don't have the kindergarten and what we have here, which 1s wonderful. From there\nwe went to the high school. I was sent out to Vienna for my German, Switzerland to\nmy...Swiss as to my French, and I was a happy-go-lucky girl. So was my brother. And uh\nwe finished school. I got married very early, very happily, and uh then Eva was born.\nMade us more happy, and since then she's my...my life. My husband passed away here in\nthis country, 1957, January. It's a long, long time.",
        "Q: OK. Let's go back then to the time when you were growing up in Budapest. You had\nmentioned that you had a happy childhood.",
        "A: Yes, I did.",
        "Q: Tell us about the changes that you remember in the life of the Jewish community in\nBudapest at whatever time you can recall.",
        "A: Well uh, the Jewish...how should I say it...as a young girl I was going to the big holidays\nwith my mother. I can sit next to her and I was very proud being there. So was my\nbrother who was sitting downstairs uh with my father, my uncle, and many other family\nuh and friends whom we know, and I was really brought up in a very warm, Jewish\nfamily. I wasn't too religious, but all the holidays we were keeping and we got together\nwith the family, mother's, father's, and this was it.",
        "Q: And when did you first realize there were changes in the experiences of the Jewish\ncommunity?",
        "A: That's a very good question, what you ask me. I realized the first ttme when I was in\nVienna, Vienna, in the school , they call that. And uh I spoke fluently German\nbecause Austra-Hungarians we needed it...five hours only between Hungary and Vienna,\nSO We we the language. And we were making discussions from Vienna, and I saw\ncertain signs which in German naturally I could read...and in English it would say, no\nJews and dogs are allowed. Certain restaurants or buildings. I was reading it. I was even\nasking my teacher. I said what does this mean? I don't like that.\n",
        "Q: Do you remember what year that was?",
        "A: Oh yes. Sure. It was in 1927.",
        "Q: 1937 I think...",
        "A: '27.'27.",
        "Q: OK.",
        "A: This is the first time that I went to Vienna. I was fifteen or sixteen years old. So she gave\nme a very interesting answer, and uh naturally whatever she said, it was fine. But I came\nback to Hungary and I told my parents. They said you couldn't read that. You you\nmisunderstood. They didn't believe it. So I stopped asking because maybe I made a\nmistake. Even so I was reading fluently and these are two words which you cannot...I\nmean Jewish is Jewish...Juda...and dog is dog. . So this was...this was the first time,\nand it bothered me, but when, you know, young girl, going back to school and this was\nthe end of it. Now then in Europe what's going on. Naturally in Germany, so the\n..they always said it cannot happen to us. This was the motto. Then come closer.\nHungary became...naturally was...we were allied with the Germans so nothing happened,\nbut the minute...minute when uh we became part of the Allies, then we knew that we are\nJews and there are enemies in our own country.",
        "Q: Let's go back then to the time the war actually began, in 1939 in Poland. How did it affect\nthe Jewish community in Budapest?",
        "A: In a way there was a feeling that something is wrong, but we didn't know what. Certain\nthe Germans are our allies, so they didn't touch us, but you could feel there is\nsomething in the air. You couldn't explain it. I remember we went with my husband to\nFrance just for a trip and uh we had friends over there. They said, are you going back? So\nwe said what a question? Said don't you see what's going on? So I said yes, I don't care.\nEva is home. Naturally we're going back, and we did go back. In 1940 my husband was\ninvited...invited to be in the in the labor camp.",
        "Q: OK. Let's talk about that. In 1940, things changed in Budapest. How would you\ncharacterize the change? What do you remember?",
        "A: Well, first of all he went into the labor camp.",
        "Q: How did he go into the labor camp?",
        "A: He got a notice that uh he should uh go on this and this address and have a little bag for\nhimself, the necessities...underwear, jacket, something like that. Good shoes. And he will\nbe notified where to go. When the paper comes, he should be ready, and then he will\nnotify us where he is. We shouldn't worry, so I was worried. I don't have to tell you...",
        "Q: Do you remember who he got the paper from?",
        "A: Oh sure. Oh sure. Well, this was a paper from the Hungarian uh...what was that...uh\nministerial (ph) that he is going 1n...some were called in for being soldiers. Then some\nwere called in to the so-called labor camps. Each man that they were working on the\nhighways. They went up to...they were taken up to the mountains. There was nothing for\nthem, so they made their own ditches for uh important things and then they they got...uh\nthey were putting up huts for them. They were put in a uh train which took them...in\nHungary, we were still in Hungary...naturally I went out with him. And uh I was very\nupset. I I didn't know what's going on, so they're starting to read the letters or the\ntelephone calls. I...we didn't know what...what is labor...labor...labor camps mean.\nAbsolutely not. So then I started to work in uh his business and helping out and I was\nbusy, and my daughter, naturally, and uh he wrote me a card. I showed you that I think.\nThe first one and then the second one that uh he's alright. I shouldn't worry, and uh there\nare a lot of people there. He's very...not helpful because he is not uh a person who can\nwork on the fields but anyway he's trying his best. The food is so...I should take care of\nEva...all my love. Open card...this was all read by the people how I found out. Sometimes\nit was crossed...he said something not...not___. Then I started to find out what that\nlabor camp is, and uh I talked to some gentleman...I don't want to name...give his name\nbecause his family is here a very well-known name, but I will tell you later. And he loved\nmy husband and I said well, listen. I would like to find out what we can do. So I said uh\nfind out...uh I will find out and I let you know. Fine. He was...he was also Jewish. He was\na highly regarded soldier from the 1st World War, so he was not a youngster, but he was\nvery nice and I called him actually uncle. I don't know why. And uh so he found out that\nthere is a doctor in my husband's uh labor camp, and he will talk to him. He will ask him\nto go to him and tell him how...what he fells, because he wasn't well, and so he got...he\nwas going to the doctor and uh he gave him a paper that he is not well, and in two weeks\nhe should come back, so he came home. So then...",
        "Q: So he was in a labor camp for how long?",
        "A: He was there uh a few months. I can't remember exactly. It started to come to winter, so\nfor two weeks he was home. He told me or less how it's going...very hard, and naturally\nthe captain who was running the show...he was nothing, absolutely nothing. I mean not\nqualified. He was...",
        "Q: OK. What did he do when he came home?",
        "A: First of all, he wanted to look around what...what he can do and I went up to the\nAmerican Consul and told him that story, that he cannot do it because he is...and I cannot,\ncannot, cannot. So I said oh, don't worry. It won't be too long, but you have your papers.\nYou have your family. Uh and uh so after two weeks he had to go back, to a different\nplace. 101 . This was his name...or this number of that camp. So I went with\nhim and there they had permission once in a while when they came down from the\nmountains, coming into a town, that I could go there without they should know. A lot of\nwives, naturally, found that we had each other, and he came down with a sergeant. Load\nfor food and to carrying up food to the mountains and all that, but he knew that I will be\nin this place, so we met there. They were lovely people. I never met them. They opened\ntheir house for us that we could sit down. He can take a bath and you know, important.",
        "Q: What did he do in that labor camp?",
        "A: The...always the same. Always the...",
        "Q: Which was?",
        "A: Which was they were working...excuse me...they were working on the fields. They were\nworking there to set up uh uh houses...not houses. I mean there was huts...huts. It\nwas...the winter came and they had no clothing. It was cold. There was nothing, so\nthey...they were busy but with nothing. That's the honest truth. Just to keep them there.",
        "Q: And how long did he stay the second time?",
        "A: He was staying there for uh for half a year maybe or longer. Then there was a time that\nthey changed places so he came back before they changed places uh spaces or\nplaces. But I could see him...physically first of all he lost a lot of weight but this was the\nleast, but inside something broke. He was a very cultured, intelligent, warm gentleman,\nand this killed him inside. And I could feel...that's why I tried whatever I could but you\nknow, I'm not a psychologist or anything, just plain wife. He got another invitation. In the\nmeantime my parents came back again to this country. Leslie left. It was 1940. He was\nworking to get out just from that country to this country, to my parents. Immediately he\nwent in to volunteer...there was no war in that year, but he wanted to do that, and uh they\nsaid alright. We'll put you down and that's OK. I don't know where he went. I think he\nwent to Camp Kilmer (ph) that time.",
        "Q: And you and your husband and your daughter...?",
        "A: My husband was in labor camp. The...naturally the Americans and the English were\nbombing us because we were enemies. Let me tell you honestly, I said thanks God...thank\nthem all. I couldn't...I didn't think about it what happens to our building where we were\nliving because we don't even own that. I didn't mind we die, hopefully all three in the\nsame time, but this cannot go on. We had bombs...the houses are down. There was no\nfood. You know, war but I see now it just comes back.",
        "Q: And in 1941...\n",
        "A: ..one...he came back again but that time it was bad. This was a , which\nmeans Jews, or a percentage. I was running still his business. It was...nothing\nhappened to it, but it was very hard because I was a woman and I I wasn't a business\nwoman but uh just used my little brain what I had and I kept...we had to pick up gentile\npeople to keep the numerous clauses...let's say I could have x percent Jewish people.\nThen had to have at least eighty percent non-Jewish people. We had a lot of non-Jewish\npeople in the business because...with my husband, when he was a young man and they\nwere excellent with us. I mean...",
        "Q: Did your husband have anything to do with the Jewish community during that period of\ntime?",
        "A: Oh yes. Oh yes. Definitely yes.",
        "Q: What did he do?",
        "A: He was in the...in the...how do you do...what is the name of that uh...in the business\nsection and uh uh helping out the community in collecting money for them, but he was\nnot a collector. He was just taking like like in the government, you have a person who is\nrunning the show and then you tell them what to do, so he was the top man almost in\nthat...in that...",
        "Q: Was it the community council that he was...?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. That's the name. Yeah. He was a community councilor. He was sitting up. He\nwasn't sitting in his regular seat, you know, there and my uncle, my father was not...he\nwas sitting down.",
        "Q: So he was involved in...",
        "A: Definitely. Definitely. What to bring. What to take. What to send. What to buy.\nNaturally, this is volunteer work. You don't get paid for that.",
        "Q: And what years was he doing that?",
        "A: He was doing that for...even before he started to...let's say before 1939 because he didn't\nstart with that. This was an honor and...for him...and he felt that he was honored with\nthat, that...",
        "Q: So he continued to do that when he returned from the labor camps?",
        "A: That's right. Then he went back and we got a telephone call that...don't come back to the\nbusiness because it's not yours anymore and we give it to another firm. Good. So he\nnever went back. The bank account was closed. And this was it. We were still at our\nhome, became a Jewish house because he worked it out because he was up there.",
        "Q: What does it mean...it became a Jewish house?",
        "A: It meant that uh gentile people who were living in the house, houses where we were\nliving, if they want to they can go out and they can take other houses where the Jews will\nbe taken out from their apartment and they can have better apartments or whatever, and\nthese people will and all these people, not one couple left our building, and there\nwas at least fifty-fifty.",
        "Q: Who established your house as a Jewish house?",
        "A: The Jewish . You had to ask for it. You had to have a reason because there are\nmore Jews than gentiles for we should stay there. Now he was really there as a councilor\nand he said listen, we are fifty-four percent at least, and if you can do it, and I bring in in\nour apartment in every room some friends of ours...husband, wife, children, so according\nto that we had like six-room apartment here and they Ok'd it and the owner of the\nbuilding Ok'd it, and so in every room we had a couple friends. I had an aunt and her\nhusband and a son. He was sent to labor camp, shot in the with a child, and she was\nwithout. Then we had different friends. One is up in Toronto. Another one in...",
        "Q: But during this period of time...?",
        "A: We were together.",
        "Q: You lived in a safe house?",
        "A: Yes. We were living in a safe house, yes.",
        "Q: And that was the term that you used for the Jewish house?",
        "A: Yes. This is what we used.",
        "Q: And your husband during those periods of time when he was living with you in the\nJewish house, maintained his contact with the...",
        "A: With the Jewish ... this was the only place he could go. There was nothing for\nhim anymore.",
        "Q: During the time he was in the Jewish , did he have any occasion to visit with or\nmeet with representatives of the government?",
        "A: You mean with the Hungarian government?\n",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Uh I couldn't tell you that. I can't remember that really, because they were not important\nina way. They didn't have any demands on on the Jewish except that we should\npay more taxes because the had a....the Jewish has a certain tax. We we\nwe paid that. But nothing. The first one was when the Germans came in which was in\n1944. There was no more labor camp for him, and uh the minute when we became allies\nto the Allies, then naturally the Germans who were allies became enemies",
        "Q: And how did that manifest itself? What did you see?",
        "A: Well, first of all, in our buildings were people, German-speaking people...one from\nAustria, a few from Germany...(cough-clearing throat) and we all spoke German and\nmany other...a few other languages, and we got very friendly. They were younger people\nand they were out of their home, so they figured we invite them. They had beautiful\nlibraries. Come over for a cup of coffee or some Hungarian cookies, you know, and they\ncame over. When the Germans came over...took over, and I'm using the elevator, I see\none of my favorite ones...he was the youngest. He was a Viennese and I knew Vienna\nvery well. It was...I was there in school a long time ago then and uh he said, _, what\ndo I do now? I mean you...are you an enemy? I said I am never...I will be never an enemy\nand I am with you and whatever I can do, I'll do it. So this was a very good feeling and I\ndidn't know...should I ask him to come in or shouldn't I? So I talked it over with my\nhusband. I said...don't change. As what he said, you take his words. If he wants to, he\ncomes in anyway, so don't say no, and he was right, so he came in and we were there.\nOne night around two-thirty...in the...1t morning...sorry...somebody knocks our door, and\n. This was the time when the Germans collected the people...two thirty in the\nmorning. Nobody...everybody was sleeping so they could do that. He comes in. We we\nwe were frightened, really very frightened, and he says listen...he was working for the\nGermans in the short-wave radio which means that he heard everything what came into\nHungary and he was sending it over to Germany. He said I just heard that the Swedish\nking 1s giving a so-called schutzpass (ph)...papers who can prove that they were working\nwith with Sweden or they have families in Sweden...they will tell you if you have\nanything like that. I know that your husband is bringing in paper from Sweden, rolls with\n, and uh because we were importers, so please, this what I heard. Ask him to go up\nto the...one of the...on the Buda (ph) side, which are the side, go over there. Tell\nyou heard that...you can mention even my name...it's official...and tell them what you\nknow, what you have, business. They will check it and then you can have a Swedish uh\npaper that you are a Swedish...Swedish uh subject. Well, we couldn't believe it. My\nhusband the next...this was early morning...two o'clock. At nine o'clock he was up there.\nHe crossed the Danube on the on the bridge and he found it and he told his name and he\nwas telling the name of the factories what he was repre...representing and bringing a lot\nof lot of papers and uh with the papers were boxes, papers for for... for using\npackage, newspapers...you know, the big rolls...so it was quite an ordeal, and they\nchecked it. Naturally no time did they know the factory. They called it and they said oh\nyes, he's one of our biggest but we don't hear from them. Whatever you can say...I know\nMr. Brust very well, or Herr Brust possibly and uh so he got...we were . I think we\nwere the number...it's on the schutzpass what I brought to you...the number thirty-four,\nthirty-five...very...in the beginning, which meant we are Swedish subjects. We do not\nhave to wear the stars, the Jewish stars which was recommend. It had to be done, which\nkilled me morally because to be...you know, I can sit on the...and I cannot sit in the\nnormal seat, let's say take a bus or sub...or a streetcar. I had to sit in the back. I\ncould...you know, this was something which which...it's unbelievable. So we got that and\nwas an angel.",
        "Q: How did that change your life, having the schutzpass?",
        "A: Well, I felt uh a little bit easier, but I was ashamed and sad and very sad. First of all, I\nhave a daughter and I had a husband. After I saw him what's going on with him and what\nhappens to her. I mean this is...I give her birth. I mean we give her birth, so after all my\nhusband has...my brother went out and I got letters from Zurich that I had relatives\nthrough my mother's side (coughing-clearing throat). My mother had wrote that Leslie's\nfine and he's wearing with big honor the...his new country's uniform because he became a\na soldier and uh...",
        "Q: But you 1n the time that you're describing now, when you had the schutzpass, you had\nbeen living in Budapest...",
        "A: Budapest.",
        "Q: ..and your husband was not working.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: How did you support yourselves?",
        "A: I don't know. I don't know. We started to...until we had money touched...that we could\ntouch our money, we bought food and we filled up our pantry but uh there was time that\nwe had once a day food and Eva was a poor eater anyway. Now that she didn't have that\nmuch money and that that that food what she liked, so she started to eat less and this\nbroke my heart.",
        "Q: So up until 1944, life was not too difficult?",
        "A: No, but uh you couldn't...uh there were restrictions. You couldn't do this. At five o'clock\nyou had to be home and uh the family who came living with us and the gentiles were\nreally nice. No problem, and they helped us. They brought us food and they said don't\nworry. We will survive and then you'll give us back whatever we spent on you, or we\ngive something for them, you know, whatever we had in our apartment.",
        "Q: OK. So we've now established that through a period of time there were difficulties, but it\nwasn't all that difficult for you. When did it become actually a serious...?",
        "A: We became...yes...when we were told that we should move in from that Jewish house uh\nto the Swedish house, because they cannot...the Germans won't respect our Jewish house\nand they will just...we we saw it. I mean they collected people on the street. They came in\nin the houses and uh in the morning, two, three o'clock. Uh in the meantime, the big war,\nthe Germans went all over Europe. It started in Holland, in Belgium, always in the early\nmorning and we heard that.",
        "Q: What did you hear...that people were being collected?",
        "A: First of all we didn't have a radio. We were not allowed to have a radio, so the big\none...we had a big, old-fashioned radio...there was no television at that time...they took it\naway, but my husband had a small one, and we put it in his drawer, and he opened\nChurchill...German...I mean England.",
        "Q: What was it that you were hearing that was happening to the Jewish people who were\nbeing taken away\u201d?",
        "A: Well, everything what what went on...",
        "Q: Which was...?",
        "A: First of all in Austria, they collected the people. They went...they were taken to certain\nuh...even in my family. They were picked up and disappeared, and we didn't know. A\ncousin of mine who is here in this country...he's quite a young man...he's not a young man\nanymore...he and his mother were taken. Then we got a card, a postcard, some kind\nof...what is that...uh sea...not sea...uh uh what is that...it is like a uh....",
        "Q: The specific place isn't important.",
        "A: No. Anyway, he got a card...we got a card that he is .",
        "Q: yes.",
        "A: is a little...uh it's not an ocean. It's like a...",
        "Q: It's a sea.",
        "A: No, it's not a sea. It's it's a standing water. And you can swim in it.\n",
        "Q: It's a lake.",
        "A: It's a lake. I should know that. That was...I'm going absolutely...",
        "Q: The question that I was asking was in reference...?",
        "A: My husband was always in the Jewish . [showed him, look here what what what we\ngot from Steven. So he said I just wanted to let you know. You know what that 1s...this is\nAuschwitz. I said what is that. And he got the notice from the...in the meantime is that\nWallenburg showed up. Of course, he was an angel sent from God. I met him twice when\nI was going for my husband. I didn't want him to go alone on the street, and uh...",
        "Q: Before we get to Mr. Wallenburg, I'd like to go back to that point about the Germans\nwere collecting people...",
        "A: Collecting people from their home. They take them out. They had a big truck down on\nthe street. They were pushed 1n in the car. They never knew then where they're going,\nhow long do they...will they be away, nothing.",
        "Q: But you did get some indication that some...",
        "A: We thought they are disappearing. In the meantime we heard the BBC, late evening, you\nknow, quietly.",
        "Q: Saying...?",
        "A: And then Mr. Churchill and the English uh tele...uh radio told us what's going on in the\nwar.",
        "Q: What did they tell you?",
        "A: They told us there is an Auschwitz. There is a Mauthaussen. There is a Theresienstadt.\nWe had never heard that.",
        "Q: And what did they tell you was going on?",
        "A: That this is a collection where the Hungarian people or wherever they are from Europe,\nthey are put...they are put in a in a train without food. Everything is taken away from\nthem before and then the left-over when they arrive and uh they are put in in ovens. So I\nsaid well, the English, I love them but uh they are crazy. How can they say that? I mean\nthis 1s...1t's impossible. You know, everybody said that because you don't believe that. So\nthen Steven's first card came from and my husband says, you know what this is?\nThis is Auschwitz so I want to tell to my friends in the...with whom we are living still in\nour old house, in our old apartment, and we told...he told them. He was almost killed by\nour friends. They said you are crazy. You're picking up this news...this is...there 1s no\nsuch thing. And even so, if you hear it, tell it to Lilly, to your wife. Don't tell us because\nwe don't believe it.",
        "Q: And that was...that was...?",
        "A: Don't ever say that. Just tell me. I want to know every word you want to say. Because I\ndidn't want him to hold back.",
        "Q: OK. So...",
        "A: Then we went over to the Swedish house.",
        "Q: And what was it like in the Swedish house?",
        "A: This is a very beautiful house, four or five floors and uh we had the paper from the\nSwedish king that we are...we can stay there. We went in, early morning. Kitchen was\nfull with mattresses. Everything was mattresses. So I said, you know...I was frightened\nand my husband says, you know, I don't want to stay there. So Eva said I am tired. I want\nto stay there. I sit down. She has this doll and uh a tack board (ph), . So I said leave\nit there sweetheart, and we will...doll here or a book and take the doll...now I remember\nwell...and we will be back. We disa...we went out. They said don't forget you have to be\nback until five. . We never came back, because we decided but this is a\ncollection for only Jews. The Germans was eating up Europe. Why should they stop in\nHungary? There is no reason. They are in and they own us, so when they know...let's say\nthe end...there is an end. They will still finish up the people in a collected house. He was\nabsolutely right. I was upset because I couldn't believe that this can be.",
        "Q: And where did you go?",
        "A: We figured out that we are going in one of our own buildings in which we gave the\nthe...an apartment as a superintendent to one of my husband's workers. He was with him\nfor...he was a young man, still my husband, when he was working in the business there.\nHe was paper importer. He was quite a nice man. I knew his wife. I knew his son and we\ngave him that apartment. I don't know why that he should be our super in a no-charge\napartment. It was a heated apartment. This was brand new. I mean, very modern. We\ndidn't have too many like that.",
        "Q: You had mentioned a moment ago that you met Mr. Wallenburg.",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "Q: Was it at this time?\n",
        "A: Uh Wallenburg was...I met him before we went to hiding. I was still a Jewish passport\nand I tell you how I met him. I picked up my husband and there was a big conference,\nand he was uh...my husband and the Jewish , the people, the President whom I knew\nvery well there, Mr. Stern (ph), uh they had a big...and my husband said sit in in the back\nand just listen. You know that man? I said yes, I heard him but I never met, so he\nintroduces...a very tiny looking, blue-eyed, blondish skinny man. If you would see him\non the street, you wouldn't say oh my God, I have to look back, you know, because he's\nnothing. Very simple. And I listened. He spoke uh German and uh naturally and uh I\nlistened and he said listen...I know, you have to tell me what you can do for the Germans,\nand you have to tell me what the Germans are telling me, telling you. Let's say they are\ncollecting uh uh this part of the cou...of of the city or this part and I will be there and I try\nto stop the train that it shouldn't go, and and then he repeated it, so this\nwas...this was something you can believe it. We still didn't believe it that this can be but\nhe he said you also have it. So we gave him...every morning almost he was in. When\nhe...when they...he knew that the train comes and picks up the people, he was there, early\nmorning, late evening.",
        "Q: What did he do?",
        "A: First of all, he gave...uh he had papers. He said he's coming with me. I know...I need him.\nHe is...he's Swedish. He's French. You name it...stories. These were very simple Germans\nthere. Naturally, I'm not talking because they were killers, and a lot of people\nwere saved through him. He actually...happened that he stopped a a train...complete...one\ntrain. Not...I don't know how many, but just one part of the train. There were women,\nchildren and elderly or sick.",
        "Q: Where did they go once the train was...?",
        "A: He was sending...he...I can't tell you that. That's the honest truth. I don't know where they\nwent, but wherever they went, the old came mostly who didn't die the natural death, came\nback. He was a miracle.",
        "Q: During the time that you described your meetings with Mr. Wallenburg and his\nactivities...",
        "A: Yes, twice I saw him.",
        "Q: ...were there any senior German officials with whom you or your husband had occasion\nto meet?",
        "A: Yes. Mr. Eichmann.",
        "Q: Mr. Eichmann?\n",
        "A: Eichmann. He is the nightmare. He came in, very handsome looking, funny face...you\nknow, something which 1s...which , very elegantly dressed, boots.",
        "Q: You say he came 1n?",
        "A: He came into the Jewish . He said I am so and this is my name or his title...I don't\nremember what he was...and I am talking for my government. Now we are...we were\nallies and now we are enemies but we are still allies and when you want to uh have\nyour...have your...the the freedom a few Jewish people, and I will have request for you,\nand if you can give it to me, I will take a few out and they can stay or we're going to send\nthem...they don't go too far. We put them in the train, nice story. They will work. They\nwill help us out in the factories here, factories there and that's all. Now we knew this\nwasn't true because we heard the BBC. This was our...this was the bible because we knew\nthe truth.",
        "Q: So Eichmann was telling you the story...?",
        "A: Eichmann did that, so he came in and he said I need now I don't know how many beds.\nGet them. Said we don't have beds. You have hospitals, Jewish hospitals, this hospital. I\nsend my men and we just tell them they should give it to them, so then he he got that.\nWhat do we get for that, we were asking, not to him but the... mean , so he said\nwell uh...he said a number, so we started to bargain.",
        "Q: A number of what?",
        "A: Of the people who...for the beds or for linen or for sewing machines or medications or\ndoctor's help, then you get...they wouldn't take x Jewish people...hundred, fifty, twenty.\nBut it didn't matter because we give everything for for lifes, so they just...but sometimes\nhe was very strong. I mean I want to have it done and then and then, and uh he got it. I\ndon't know how they did that, I mean this...my my my people, how they did that, but they\ndid it.",
        "Q: How many times did you have occasion to meet with Mr. Eichmann?",
        "A: Mr. Eichmann I saw a few times. Once I almost met him directly. That's a very funny\nthing. My husband was going down...it was still...he could go in to pick up to his\nbusiness. No subway...no no...with a with a subway. There was a small subway we had\nbut no streetcar, no buses. And uh his uh secretary with whom he met there to see what's\ngoing on called me around nine o'clock. We had still telephone but in secrecy because we\ndidn't...we were not allowed to have, so it was everything in a drawer, so I called him and\nI said John, in Hungarian, uh where is Mr. Brust? No. I'm sorry. He called me and\nhe says where is Mr. Brust, so he...I said what do you mean? He left at least three-\nquarters of hour. Even if he walked, he should be there in twenty...fifteen, twenty\n\nminutes. He said no, he's not in. So he said we are...I'\u2018m going down now and I'm going\nand I want to find out what happened. As I'm going down...a lot of people\nwalking and as I'm walking, a man and a...was a man and later a woman, as they are\ncoming opposite me, they are talking to me. They don't...we don't know each other. They\nsaid don't go too far because they are picking up men and women, the Germans. And they\njust walked by. This was like a message, so I know what could happen...could have\nhappened, so I went further, and I saw that there is a big commotion. I didn't go further\nbecause I didn't want to be picked up. I have a daughter and I don't have if I will be\npicked up. I went up to the Jewish , to the president whom I knew very well, and I\nsaid listen, I just found out...do you know anything about it? Well, you know, every\ncorner they do that now. So he said I'm not interested in that. See, I am just looking now\nin one corner and this is my husband. He gave you a lot of help and I have one help. I\nwant to know where he 1s, and you call up Mr. Eichmann...you know the Germans...and\nyou tell him that he is one of your people here who are helping him and his wife 1s\nhere...you can that, and I want to have him back. I can't do that. I can't call Eichmann.\nYou know, this...this was...he's the _ himself, so I said I am not leaving. I sleep here\nuntil you don't get...I don't care...Eichmann...whoever. Call up the German who give the\norder because there...every corner had a...so he saw that I am very stubborn, which I was.\nUsually I'm not. Maybe I am. I don't know, and he called up the Germans and he found\nout that a lot of men, mostly men, a few women but mostly men, were picked up who\nwere healthy looking, put in in a car...in a trunk...a truck, truck...and uh was taken up to\nclear and clean some house on the bigger side where we have villas, private homes, not\nuh building...apartment buildings, and this what they do, so he said find out where.\nI said I'm not inter...don't tell me stories. Just call and find out where. If not, call\nEichmann. I'm not going...he is coming to there. I know that this was the day when he\nusually came in for asking and I will stand there. Maybe he shoots me. I don 't care. But I\nwant to talk to him. So...excuse me...so he saw again that, you know, there is no end to\nhave me there so he figured he better...this meantime he walked 1n, just miracle again,\nand the president, he went in ...order order is what he said, so the president said,\nwell there is a lady whose husband you met a few times and he was helping me. She just\nfound out that he was picked up and was sent up to the mountain with many other men in\na covered truck to clean some buildings. She's asking you, and there he was, uh could you\nsend a message or something that he should be taken out from the whatever he does\nthere, cleaning, because he's more important here than cleaning a house and he's not so\ngood maybe in that. very funny face and said he will learn it, but he didn't say that\nand he...very elegantly he looked at me and said uh in German, , which means like\nmadame or whatever, and he said, I try my utmost. Hold on. Like a perfect gentleman. He\nwent away. He came back in a few minutes and he said don't worry. I know where\nhe...where these people were taken to different houses but I know where he is...he gives\nthe name...and I am sending up a car and we'll pick...will be picked up a few people\nincluded your husband. He didn't want to make one...this was very cleaver of him, and he\nwill come home. So I said to him, can I take your word...you know, smilingly. I didn't\ninsult him. So he said, like a German officer, he said. Then I said I believe. Thank you.\nAnd there I was walking onthe __ from there. Came back and started...I was calling\nimmediately our...his secretary...1 mean my husband's secretary, John. He is coming\nback. You walk on this side on the avenue and I'm walking this side. If he be in a truck,\nor alone, and he found him on the other side and they scream to me, call me, and when I\nsaw him I said what happened. This what happened. They picked him up. What happened\nto the other part. They were sent...not all...a few came down. He said I was picked up...he\nhad no idea what was going on, but I was up there. I didn't...[ wouldn't dare to tell him\nthat, and I never did, and I said well, I just talked to the president after all and I told him\nthat I would like to have you back because you are needed here.",
        "Q: And once he got back...",
        "A: He went immediately back to the tothe and said I am back. Thank you for asking\nfor me and what can I do?",
        "Q: And what did he do?",
        "A: He was , you know, . Then but this I didn't see. with his\norders and they were working together and get this and that and that. I think the biggest\nitem was for them...I don't even know why...sewing machines, because they were sewing\nuh clothes __ and what not.",
        "Q: And how long did this relationship with Eichmann go on?",
        "A: Until uh the Russians started to come from the north. They was our allies because they\nwere allies to the States, and then they closed up the houses. Everything was...we were in\nhiding. We were...this was before. We were still in our house. Then we went into hiding.\nWe went to the Swedish house. We were in hiding to our house. That came again a\nmiracle. My little daughter, Eva was up with the super. She didn't look like a little girl\nfrom the country. She looked like a city girl, gray suit with long hair, and there was\ncoming in a woman from the building...a lovely looking...I never met her before, and she\nasked...this I know from our super...asked uh who's that little girl? What a nice little girl.\nMy daughter got up immediately when she talked to her, and uh she said oh this is my\nsister's daughter, my son's nephew...my sister's daughter...she's my my uh...niece, and just\nfor a short time and she goes back to the country. When she says to...she told me the story\nand uh the janitor, the super...I I I didn't believe what I heard. She made a funny face and\nthen she said listen. She was a gentile woman. She lived in our building. She said I am\ngoing up to the mountains for uh skiing. I give you my keys for my apartment. This was\nvery unusual because we then...we did not have keys. We didn't give keys to the super.\nHere I do, because this is the way they have it, but uh there we didn't. We said there was\nalways somebody at our apartment, most of the time, and she said if you want to you can\nuse it or you want to put something in or take out something, I will be out there. Her\nhusband was a Jewish man who had a white...not yellow star...a white band, because he\nwas half...married to a gentile so this gave him...he wasn't taken out from the country.\nThis was the story. I never met him. I never her. So they left. Joseph comes in, down to\nthe basement and says you know, we are going up...around five o'clock I'm going up to\nthe . down into the basement. It was horrible down there. It was just horrible.",
        "Q: In what way was it horrible?",
        "A: First of all, it was cold. You had a tank for the heating system which did not work\nbecause they didn't put the heat on. We were...we heard the Germans...the the planes. We\nheard the Russians. We heard boots. We heard the war on the street. We...people came in\nthe building, Russians or the Germans. They were...any Jews here? They said that.\nNobody. So we will go around and see. Well, you know, to sit down in the basement and\nwaiting for them to come down, so Joseph said can I get you...this was...I never forget\nthat...can I get you a cup of tea. It's not too good but luckily our teapot...whatever we had\nthen. And they were so cold the Russians, so they sat down and they said thank you and\nuh I picked up naturally a few Russian words then and almost talked, not at that time but\nafter, and they left so then Joseph came down and said I take you up to an apartment. You\ndon't move. I bring you food, and I gave him my keys and I said you go over to my old\napartment. Whatever there you can carry, bring it over to your kitchen and from there\ngive us a little fruit...food. Your wife, you cook whatever and Eva should get some hot\nfood. So this what happened. He went up to this apartment, to this woman's apartment.\nNow I...we were...we stayed there for two weeks. I tell Joseph, Joseph put a little heat on.\nEverybody who is in the building should have heat, but it's not allowed. Don't worry.\nNobody will ask you that why do we have heat. They will be happy. They will give you a\ntip for that. I was right, so at least we didn't...we were in an apartment. This was a one\nbedroom apartment, one...living room, bedroom...or two bedrooms. The child had a\nbedroom and Eva was there. We had linens. It was clean.",
        "Q: And the war was going on around you?",
        "A: And the war was absolutely going on. We were bombing day and night.",
        "Q: And how long did that last?",
        "A: Oh this went on till the war was finished.",
        "Q: A period of...",
        "A: Russia came in.",
        "Q: A period of time of...?",
        "A: And when we saw the first Russian...when we...we left this apartment after two weeks\nbecause uh the war, it it came in and uh we had a...my hus...my...wait a minute, how was\nthat? Oh, I know. Then we left and we called a friend. They lived there very close by. He\nwas an officer in the Hungarian army, a gentile person. He was working in my father's\nbusiness. I saw him...I showed you maybe the picture. He was a watch importer from\nSwitzerland, and actually I didn't even call him. He found out...he came in the building,\nfound...finding us, trying to find us. Not he but she, the wife of his, lovely, tall, good-\nlooking woman asked Joseph where are they. So he said I want to talk to. [have an\napart...uh a home up on the mountains, which is a beautiful . We had there too but\nwe didn't talk about it, and this was given by a Jewish family that we should take care of\nit, and this is empty. We are going up there. We don't want to stay in the city. I want to\nhave these three people, so we went up to that apartment. Finally, the husband, who was\nan officer of the Hungarian army, was in Russia, was all over the German army because\nwe were allies. He came home without permission. He was afraid. The Germans...he was\nnot the Germans anymore, with the Germans because they became enemies. He was with\nthe Russians, but he was in Russia with the Germans, so this was a very unpleasant\nfeeling for him, and he was afraid so he left the army. He took...they took off his army\nstuff except a beautiful jacket which he picked up in Germany...in Russia, with uh\nfur...fur-lined, and he came up and so we got in to this apart...to this beautiful house.\nThere was another officer, . He...when the Russians came ___....first time I saw a\nRussian soldier in the other house , | was looking out in the...on the window and I\nsaid this is Russian. I saw the uniform, cap, so I went down. I was stepping on a on a high\nchair then because I was peeking really, and I said I don't want to tell you. They're going\nto frighten you, but the Russians are here. He said what are you talking about? So my\nhusband =. This was___ too, a very nice looking man, and the wife and the wife's\nmother, and they had a child which remain still in correspondence, in Hungary. Uh...",
        "Q: And when they saw the Russian soldier...?",
        "A: Well, they were happy, except him and uh well, I wasn't sure if I'm happy or not because\nI didn't...first of all, I knew that they are with the Americans so they cannot be that bad.\nOn the contrary, they are allies, but I didn't know that. So they came from house to house\nand they came into our house. The first one was , which means give me your\nwatch. And this was a nightmare. Your not stealing from my hand. So my husband said\nin Hungarian, give it to him. After I gave it to him, he gave it back to me. He had at least\nten watches on his arm. I'm not joking. He said where are the children? So our friends\nwho owned...that owned what he was taking care of the house, he had a son, my\ndaughter, and there was another unpleasant child which she never met before, and they\nwere the owner's son. He was there with a little house in the back, and they were hidden\nthere. So so we were very...then __ cames out with his beautiful fur-lined coat. When\nthat Russian sees that...he was not a tall man, the Hungarian fellow...he picked him up\nlike that and ___ where did you get that coat? This is a Russian...he spoke Russian. He\nsaid I got it... was in Russia as an officer...or as a prisoner. It wasn't true but he was\nstealing it from the Russian which was...they steal from him. They were stealing from\nhim, so he was stealing back and he was cold. He didn't believe that and then...but he put\nhim down and he said keep your coat, but we are here now and you will help us speaking\nHungarian and Russian, so he was like, you know, helping out, translating.\n",
        "Q: And is that how the war ended for you?",
        "A: Well, not yet. Oh no. This Russians...they were not bad. They were horrible looking with\nnewspapers packed...uh their shoes. There were no shoes. They were using cigarettes and\nnewspapers, picking up uh leaves, you never saw anything like that. They picked us up.\nThis Russian commander went...he became our friend. He brought some bread, but he\nwas stealing that he was bring here. This was always...this was fine. A big Russian...1t\nwas late evening...he comes in to the...the Germans are coming back. We take you down.\nWe belong to them. And we didn't mind. To get Russian is better than the Germans. I\ndon't know why but this...this was normal feeling and uh we were all transferred. There\nwas a lot of people again and we got in a truck. We went down...I never was there...",
        "Q: Down to...?",
        "A: Down... ...we went down and we went out of Budapest which 1s let's say if I\nwould come, get out from New York City from Manhattan and I'm getting over to White\nPlains and then going up near near New York State...",
        "Q: A suburb of Budapest?",
        "A: It 1t was not a suburb. It was a...it was a completely different little town, a village which\nthe Russians took over from the Germans and there were bodies...German bodies. \u2014__\nthat we had to get out from the trunk, from the truck and uh we were lined up. I said to\nmy husband, Eva stays with...before me because if they shoot me I want she should be\nshot too, and then next you. I didn't want to leave the child alone. And we were ready for\nthat, and then one of the Russians came in and said what are you doing? I brought them\ndown. They are our people, so they went back. They didn't shoot us. They were ...was\nstarting to get dark, and we were still walking. Eva was before me. She was...I want to go\nback. I want to slow down. I didn't let her...permit her to go...permit to go in the back.\nFigured I'd loose her like that. She's always before me, so sand a man comes out.\nFrom far away , physically . This is...where are you going? So we said we\nwant to go to sleep somewhere. Where are you from? So we said we are from the\ncountry. What is your name? We changed the Brust to Bollage (ph) which in Europe it's\nvery...like here sometimes you can change it a Polish name or German name to make it\nAmerican sounding, so Bollage is a very good name and a lot of families, a lot of people\nin our families changed it. It sounded beautiful. I always said, don't you want to...I want\nto be Brust. So I said fine, and we are Brust , SO I told my name that we are that.\nYou come with us, and some other people with whom we met there, so we went there,\nand he had a little house and he had a basement for I don't know what, maybe washing\nor...we didn't have washing machines...and he gave us that and he gave...uh there was a\nmattress, two mattresses, and there was a...\nPAUSE - BLANK IN TAPE\n",
        "Q: ...Russians liberated Budapest and if you could tell us how the end of the war appeared to\nyou and what you did with your husband and your daughter at that point in time?",
        "A: Yeah. So when the Russians started out during the war that they were liberating us, and\nwe were really lucky because when they went down to the village, there were Russians\ncoming and going through the village. They...sometimes they came in in the houses and\nuh brought some food or...and that we should do its food and we should do it, and I\nwasn't a good cook and my husband had no idea what what cooking is, but there were\nothers, so we helped. And then what they didn't use, they didn't eat up, they left it for us,\nbut we couldn't do anything with that, but we were afraid from them. That's the honest\ntruth. Even so they were liberating and I felt that uh they won't harm us, uh it was a very\ndifficult time.",
        "Q: Was there any characterization of your being Jewish at that time?",
        "A: Uh this is very funny. Once a high officer, grey*haired, tall man.... can see his face |\nlike a wild animal in the...in that little whatever that was and uh he said who you, who\nyou, who you? I spoke rather very simple Russian. You pick up, you know, a few weeks\nyou are with them...you pick it up the everyday words, so I said husband, wife, daughter,\nand he picks up Eva...I almost died...and holds her and I said uh...I asked him would you\ngive it back to me? So he said no, no. I don't harm him...her. So this...this was the end of\nthe beginning. So uh...alright...so he...because you asked about Jewish, so he asked us,\nare you Jewish, or are you Catholic? Hungary is a Catholic country. And we didn't look\nJewish, let's put it that way... no characteristics, nothing like that. So my husband...again,\nhe was the cleaver...he said we are Jews and running from the Germans. Don't forget they\nwere not allies anymore. They were against each other, so he goes into his pocket and I\nthought, my God, he will shoot us. He takes out a little prayer book and gives it to my\nhusband. He cannot read Hebrew so I cannot either. I learned it in school because we\nhave...the the Jewish children go to the Jewish uh religious hour and the Catholics to the\nCatholic _, same time. We just go different and then we go back regular. So uh...and\nI...and I knew that he he was because this was old-fashioned Hebrew and and so I tell\nhim, uh I will tell you the the Jewish prayer \u2014_ which I learned when I was a baby and\nthat's all I know. He looks at me. He knows it, so he said sure he knows and she...Eva\nknows it, my daughter. He didn't...he put back his prayer book and he knew that we are.\nHe gave candy to Eva and he said, I am a Jewish Russian Jew and I promised myself that\nwhenever I see a child, German or anything, I just do the same what they did to my\nchildren. They throw them out in the window. Funny. When he took Eva, I got\nfrightened. I didn't know what it was. So he said I don't do anything to you. I bring you\nfood until he was stationed in there and he did. Eva came back to me, naturally. She\ndidn't even realize what went on, you know, because she didn't believe in bad and good.\nIn good she did, but not in bad things. That man was for a few days there. Then he\ndisappeared. They were picked up with, you know, with the army and they went. Then\nwe went to clean. I always carried Eva. I never took my husband. He was staying there. I\n____ cleaning up a place where the horses were and the cows were, __ like that. I dida\ngood cleaning, but after that we got two big loaf of bread, the Russian bread. You know,\nwhat we have here, the white bread...it's squarish (ph), and then we started to run because\nwe figured I don't have the bread...I clean my whatever I had to. I don't want to get\npicked up. The reason the Kozack (ph) with the horses, they run all over, and as I said I\nspoke a few so they got close to us and one was bending down from this big horses and\nasked some Hungarian name, village and I told them to go this way. Thank you, and he\nwent. Let me tell you, in ten minutes we were home, so called home. I said I I I I don't\nknow how I survived it.",
        "Q: Well, from that point to your return...",
        "A: The Russian...under the Russian...",
        "Q: Under the Russians...",
        "A: Under the Russia ...all the women put on their scarf and they were hiding their\nyouth with . I mean I was myself a young woman and uh and they were raped.\nThey were...these the men were horrible, the Russians. And I didn't have a scarf. I didn't\nhave anything. Naturally I wasn't grayish like now. I had light brown hair and otherwise I\nlooked the same except much, much younger. They never, never touched me, so when we\ncame back...this was...this 1s again a miracle. Never. When we came back and we met our\nwomen friends and we talk, everybody said their story and it became a saying...cam you\nimagine, even the Russians didn't want to have Lilly. This was...you know...I was...so I\nsaid yes. I'm as ugly, I was old...not even they wanted to have me...",

Well educated, if I may\nsay so myself, both of us. Uh we had elementary school. Naturally we started with that.\nWe don't have the kindergarten and what we have here, which 1s wonderful. From there\nwe went to the high school. I was sent out to Vienna for my German, Switzerland to\nmy...Swiss as to my French, and I was a happy-go-lucky girl. So was my brother. And uh\nwe finished school. I got married very early, very happily, and uh then Eva was born.\nMade us more happy, and since then she's my...my life.

        "A: That's a very good question, what you ask me. I realized the first ttme when I was in\nVienna, Vienna, in the school , they call that. And uh I spoke fluently German\nbecause Austra-Hungarians we needed it...five hours only between Hungary and Vienna,\nSO We we the language. And we were making discussions from Vienna, and I saw\ncertain signs which in German naturally I could read...and in English it would say, no\nJews and dogs are allowed. Certain restaurants or buildings. I was reading it. I was even\nasking my teacher. I said what does this mean? I don't like that.\n",

Even so I was reading fluently and these are two words which you cannot...I\nmean Jewish is Jewish...Juda...and dog is dog. . So this was...this was the first time,\nand it bothered me, but when, you know, young girl, going back to school and this was\nthe end of it. Now then in Europe what's going on. Naturally in Germany, so the\n..they always said it cannot happen to us. This was the motto.

I remember we went with my husband to\nFrance just for a trip and uh we had friends over there. They said, are you going back? So\nwe said what a question? Said don't you see what's going on? So I said yes, I don't care.\nEva is home. Naturally we're going back, and we did go back. In 1940 my husband was\ninvited...invited to be in the in the labor camp.",

Then some\nwere called in to the so-called labor camps. Each man that they were working on the\nhighways. They went up to...they were taken up to the mountains. There was nothing for\nthem, so they made their own ditches for uh important things and then they they got...uh\nthey were putting up huts for them. They were put in a uh train which took them...in\nHungary, we were still in Hungary...naturally I went out with him. And uh I was very\nupset. I I didn't know what's going on, so they're starting to read the letters or the\ntelephone calls. I...we didn't know what...what is labor...labor...labor camps mean.\nAbsolutely not. So then I started to work in uh his business and helping out and I was\nbusy, and my daughter, naturally, and uh he wrote me a card. I showed you that I think.\nThe first one and then the second one that uh he's alright. I shouldn't worry, and uh there\nare a lot of people there. He's very...not helpful because he is not uh a person who can\nwork on the fields but anyway he's trying his best. The food is so...I should take care of\nEva...all my love. Open card...this was all read by the people how I found out. Sometimes\nit was crossed...he said something not...not___. Then I started to find out what that\nlabor camp is, and uh I talked to some gentleman...I don't want to name...give his name\nbecause his family is here a very well-known name, but I will tell you later. And he loved\nmy husband and I said well, listen. I would like to find out what we can do. So I said uh\nfind out...uh I will find out and I let you know. Fine. He was...he was also Jewish. He was\na highly regarded soldier from the 1st World War, so he was not a youngster, but he was\nvery nice and I called him actually uncle. I don't know why. And uh so he found out that\nthere is a doctor in my husband's uh labor camp, and he will talk to him. He will ask him\nto go to him and tell him how...what he fells, because he wasn't well, and so he got...he\nwas going to the doctor and uh he gave him a paper that he is not well, and in two weeks\nhe should come back, so he came home. So then...",

He told me or less how it's going...very hard, and naturally\nthe captain who was running the show...he was nothing, absolutely nothing. I mean not\nqualified. He was...",
        "A: First of all, he wanted to look around what...what he can do and I went up to the\nAmerican Consul and told him that story, that he cannot do it because he is...and I cannot,\ncannot, cannot. So I said oh, don't worry. It won't be too long, but you have your papers.\nYou have your family. Uh and uh so after two weeks he had to go back, to a different\nplace. 101 . This was his name...or this number of that camp. So I went with\nhim and there they had permission once in a while when they came down from the\nmountains, coming into a town, that I could go there without they should know. A lot of\nwives, naturally, found that we had each other, and he came down with a sergeant. Load\nfor food and to carrying up food to the mountains and all that, but he knew that I will be\nin this place, so we met there. They were lovely people. I never met them. They opened\ntheir house for us that we could sit down. He can take a bath and you know, important.",
        "A: The...always the same. Always the...",
        "A: Which was they were working...excuse me...they were working on the fields. They were\nworking there to set up uh uh houses...not houses. I mean there was huts...huts. It\nwas...the winter came and they had no clothing. It was cold. There was nothing, so\nthey...they were busy but with nothing. That's the honest truth. Just to keep them there.",
        "A: He was staying there for uh for half a year maybe or longer. Then there was a time that\nthey changed places so he came back before they changed places uh spaces or\nplaces. But I could see him...physically first of all he lost a lot of weight but this was the\nleast, but inside something broke. He was a very cultured, intelligent, warm gentleman,\nand this killed him inside. And I could feel...that's why I tried whatever I could but you\nknow, I'm not a psychologist or anything, just plain wife. He got another invitation. In the\nmeantime my parents came back again to this country. Leslie left. It was 1940. He was\nworking to get out just from that country to this country, to my parents. Immediately he\nwent in to volunteer...there was no war in that year, but he wanted to do that, and uh they\nsaid alright. We'll put you down and that's OK. I don't know where he went. I think he\nwent to Camp Kilmer (ph) that time.",
        "A: My husband was in labor camp. The...naturally the Americans and the English were\nbombing us because we were enemies. Let me tell you honestly, I said thanks God...thank\nthem all. I couldn't...I didn't think about it what happens to our building where we were\nliving because we don't even own that. I didn't mind we die, hopefully all three in the\nsame time, but this cannot go on. We had bombs...the houses are down. There was no\nfood. You know, war but I see now it just comes back.\n",
        "A: ..one...he came back again but that time it was bad. This was a , which\nmeans Jews, or a percentage. I was running still his business. It was...nothing\nhappened to it, but it was very hard because I was a woman and I I wasn't a business\nwoman but uh just used my little brain what I had and I kept...we had to pick up gentile\npeople to keep the numerous clauses...let's say I could have x percent Jewish people.\nThen had to have at least eighty percent non-Jewish people. We had a lot of non-Jewish\npeople in the business because...with my husband, when he was a young man and they\nwere excellent with us. I mean...",
        "A: Oh yes. Oh yes. Definitely yes.",
        "A: He was in the...in the...how do you do...what is the name of that uh...in the business\nsection and uh uh helping out the community in collecting money for them, but he was\nnot a collector. He was just taking like like in the government, you have a person who is\nrunning the show and then you tell them what to do, so he was the top man almost in\nthat...in that...",
        "A: Yes. Yes. That's the name. Yeah. He was a community councilor. He was sitting up. He\nwasn't sitting in his regular seat, you know, there and my uncle, my father was not...he\nwas sitting down.",

        "A: He was doing that for...even before he started to...let's say before 1939 because he didn't\nstart with that. This was an honor and...for him...and he felt that he was honored with\nthat, that...",
        "A: That's right. Then he went back and we got a telephone call that...don't come back to the\nbusiness because it's not yours anymore and we give it to another firm. Good. So he\nnever went back. The bank account was closed. And this was it. We were still at our\nhome, became a Jewish house because he worked it out because he was up there.",
        "A: It meant that uh gentile people who were living in the house, houses where we were\nliving, if they want to they can go out and they can take other houses where the Jews will\nbe taken out from their apartment and they can have better apartments or whatever, and\nthese people will and all these people, not one couple left our building, and there\nwas at least fifty-fifty.",
        "A: The Jewish . You had to ask for it. You had to have a reason because there are\nmore Jews than gentiles for we should stay there. Now he was really there as a councilor\nand he said listen, we are fifty-four percent at least, and if you can do it, and I bring in in\nour apartment in every room some friends of ours...husband, wife, children, so according\nto that we had like six-room apartment here and they Ok'd it and the owner of the\nbuilding Ok'd it, and so in every room we had a couple friends.

        "A: Yes. This is what we used.",
        "A: With the Jewish ... this was the only place he could go. There was nothing for\nhim anymore.",
        "A: You mean with the Hungarian government?\n",
        "A: Uh I couldn't tell you that. I can't remember that really, because they were not important\nina way. They didn't have any demands on on the Jewish except that we should\npay more taxes because the had a....the Jewish has a certain tax. We we\nwe paid that. But nothing. The first one was when the Germans came in which was in\n1944. There was no more labor camp for him, and uh the minute when we became allies\nto the Allies, then naturally the Germans who were allies became enemies",
        "A: Well, first of all, in our buildings were people, German-speaking people...one from\nAustria, a few from Germany...(cough-clearing throat) and we all spoke German and\nmany other...a few other languages, and we got very friendly. They were younger people\nand they were out of their home, so they figured we invite them. They had beautiful\nlibraries. Come over for a cup of coffee or some Hungarian cookies, you know, and they\ncame over. When the Germans came over...took over, and I'm using the elevator, I see\none of my favorite ones...he was the youngest. He was a Viennese and I knew Vienna\nvery well. It was...I was there in school a long time ago then and uh he said, _, what\ndo I do now? I mean you...are you an enemy? I said I am never...I will be never an enemy\nand I am with you and whatever I can do, I'll do it. So this was a very good feeling and I\ndidn't know...should I ask him to come in or shouldn't I? So I talked it over with my\nhusband. I said...don't change. As what he said, you take his words. If he wants to, he\ncomes in anyway, so don't say no, and he was right, so he came in and we were there.\nOne night around two-thirty...in the...1t morning...sorry...somebody knocks our door, and\n. This was the time when the Germans collected the people...two thirty in the\nmorning. Nobody...everybody was sleeping so they could do that. He comes in. We we\nwe were frightened, really very frightened, and he says listen...he was working for the\nGermans in the short-wave radio which means that he heard everything what came into\nHungary and he was sending it over to Germany. He said I just heard that the Swedish\nking 1s giving a so-called schutzpass (ph)...papers who can prove that they were working\nwith with Sweden or they have families in Sweden...they will tell you if you have\nanything like that. I know that your husband is bringing in paper from Sweden, rolls with\n, and uh because we were importers, so please, this what I heard. Ask him to go up\nto the...one of the...on the Buda (ph) side, which are the side, go over there. Tell\nyou heard that...you can mention even my name...it's official...and tell them what you\nknow, what you have, business. They will check it and then you can have a Swedish uh\npaper that you are a Swedish...Swedish uh subject. Well, we couldn't believe it. My\nhusband the next...this was early morning...two o'clock. At nine o'clock he was up there.\nHe crossed the Danube on the on the bridge and he found it and he told his name and he\nwas telling the name of the factories what he was repre...representing and bringing a lot\nof lot of papers and uh with the papers were boxes, papers for for... for using\npackage, newspapers...you know, the big rolls...so it was quite an ordeal, and they\nchecked it. Naturally no time did they know the factory. They called it and they said oh\nyes, he's one of our biggest but we don't hear from them. Whatever you can say...I know\nMr. Brust very well, or Herr Brust possibly and uh so he got...we were . I think we\nwere the number...it's on the schutzpass what I brought to you...the number thirty-four,\nthirty-five...very...in the beginning, which meant we are Swedish subjects. We do not\nhave to wear the stars, the Jewish stars which was recommend. It had to be done, which\nkilled me morally because to be...you know, I can sit on the...and I cannot sit in the\nnormal seat, let's say take a bus or sub...or a streetcar. I had to sit in the back. I\ncould...you know, this was something which which...it's unbelievable. So we got that and\nwas an angel.",
        "A: Well, I felt uh a little bit easier, but I was ashamed and sad and very sad. First of all, I\nhave a daughter and I had a husband. After I saw him what's going on with him and what\nhappens to her. I mean this is...I give her birth. I mean we give her birth, so after all my\nhusband has...my brother went out and I got letters from Zurich that I had relatives\nthrough my mother's side (coughing-clearing throat). My mother had wrote that Leslie's\nfine and he's wearing with big honor the...his new country's uniform because he became a\na soldier and uh...",

We started to...until we had money touched...that we could\ntouch our money, we bought food and we filled up our pantry but uh there was time that\nwe had once a day food and Eva was a poor eater anyway. Now that she didn't have that\nmuch money and that that that food what she liked, so she started to eat less and this\nbroke my heart.",
        "A: No, but uh you couldn't...uh there were restrictions. You couldn't do this. At five o'clock\nyou had to be home and uh the family who came living with us and the gentiles were\nreally nice. No problem, and they helped us. They brought us food and they said don't\nworry. We will survive and then you'll give us back whatever we spent on you, or we\ngive something for them, you know, whatever we had in our apartment.",
        "A: We became...yes...when we were told that we should move in from that Jewish house uh\nto the Swedish house, because they cannot...the Germans won't respect our Jewish house\nand they will just...we we saw it. I mean they collected people on the street. They came in\nin the houses and uh in the morning, two, three o'clock. Uh in the meantime, the big war,\nthe Germans went all over Europe. It started in Holland, in Belgium, always in the early\nmorning and we heard that.",
        "A: First of all we didn't have a radio. We were not allowed to have a radio, so the big\none...we had a big, old-fashioned radio...there was no television at that time...they took it\naway, but my husband had a small one, and we put it in his drawer, and he opened\nChurchill...German...I mean England.",

        "A: First of all in Austria, they collected the people. They went...they were taken to certain\nuh...even in my family. They were picked up and disappeared, and we didn't know. A\ncousin of mine who is here in this country...he's quite a young man...he's not a young man\nanymore...he and his mother were taken. Then we got a card, a postcard, some kind\nof...what is that...uh sea...not sea...uh uh what is that...it is like a uh....",

I said what is that. And he got the notice from the...in the meantime is that\nWallenburg showed up. Of course, he was an angel sent from God. I met him twice when\nI was going for my husband. I didn't want him to go alone on the street, and uh...",
        "A: Collecting people from their home. They take them out. They had a big truck down on\nthe street. They were pushed 1n in the car. They never knew then where they're going,\nhow long do they...will they be away, nothing.",
        "A: We thought they are disappearing. In the meantime we heard the BBC, late evening, you\nknow, quietly.",
        "A: And then Mr. Churchill and the English uh tele...uh radio told us what's going on in the\nwar.",
        "A: They told us there is an Auschwitz. There is a Mauthaussen. There is a Theresienstadt.\nWe had never heard that.",
        "A: That this is a collection where the Hungarian people or wherever they are from Europe,\nthey are put...they are put in a in a train without food. Everything is taken away from\nthem before and then the left-over when they arrive and uh they are put in in ovens. So I\nsaid well, the English, I love them but uh they are crazy. How can they say that? I mean\nthis 1s...1t's impossible. You know, everybody said that because you don't believe that. So\nthen Steven's first card came from and my husband says, you know what this is?\nThis is Auschwitz so I want to tell to my friends in the...with whom we are living still in\nour old house, in our old apartment, and we told...he told them. He was almost killed by\nour friends. They said you are crazy. You're picking up this news...this is...there 1s no\nsuch thing. And even so, if you hear it, tell it to Lilly, to your wife. Don't tell us because\nwe don't believe it.",
        "A: Don't ever say that. Just tell me. I want to know every word you want to say. Because I\ndidn't want him to hold back.",
        "A: Then we went over to the Swedish house.",
        "A: This is a very beautiful house, four or five floors and uh we had the paper from the\nSwedish king that we are...we can stay there. We went in, early morning. Kitchen was\nfull with mattresses. Everything was mattresses. So I said, you know...I was frightened\nand my husband says, you know, I don't want to stay there. So Eva said I am tired. I want\nto stay there. I sit down. She has this doll and uh a tack board (ph), . So I said leave\nit there sweetheart, and we will...doll here or a book and take the doll...now I remember\nwell...and we will be back. We disa...we went out. They said don't forget you have to be\nback until five. . We never came back, because we decided but this is a\ncollection for only Jews. The Germans was eating up Europe. Why should they stop in\nHungary? There is no reason. They are in and they own us, so when they know...let's say\nthe end...there is an end. They will still finish up the people in a collected house. He was\nabsolutely right. I was upset because I couldn't believe that this can be.",
        "A: We figured out that we are going in one of our own buildings in which we gave the\nthe...an apartment as a superintendent to one of my husband's workers. He was with him\nfor...he was a young man, still my husband, when he was working in the business there.\nHe was paper importer. He was quite a nice man. I knew his wife. I knew his son and we\ngave him that apartment. I don't know why that he should be our super in a no-charge\napartment. It was a heated apartment. This was brand new. I mean, very modern. We\ndidn't have too many like that.",
        "A: Yes. Yes.\n",
        "A: Uh Wallenburg was...I met him before we went to hiding. I was still a Jewish passport\nand I tell you how I met him. I picked up my husband and there was a big conference,\nand he was uh...my husband and the Jewish , the people, the President whom I knew\nvery well there, Mr. Stern (ph), uh they had a big...and my husband said sit in in the back\nand just listen. You know that man? I said yes, I heard him but I never met, so he\nintroduces...a very tiny looking, blue-eyed, blondish skinny man. If you would see him\non the street, you wouldn't say oh my God, I have to look back, you know, because he's\nnothing. Very simple. And I listened. He spoke uh German and uh naturally and uh I\nlistened and he said listen...I know, you have to tell me what you can do for the Germans,\nand you have to tell me what the Germans are telling me, telling you. Let's say they are\ncollecting uh uh this part of the cou...of of the city or this part and I will be there and I try\nto stop the train that it shouldn't go, and and then he repeated it, so this\nwas...this was something you can believe it. We still didn't believe it that this can be but\nhe he said you also have it. So we gave him...every morning almost he was in. When\nhe...when they...he knew that the train comes and picks up the people, he was there, early\nmorning, late evening.",
        "A: First of all, he gave...uh he had papers. He said he's coming with me. I know...I need him.\nHe is...he's Swedish. He's French. You name it...stories. These were very simple Germans\nthere. Naturally, I'm not talking because they were killers, and a lot of people\nwere saved through him. He actually...happened that he stopped a a train...complete...one\ntrain. Not...I don't know how many, but just one part of the train. There were women,\nchildren and elderly or sick.",
        "A: He was sending...he...I can't tell you that. That's the honest truth. I don't know where they\nwent, but wherever they went, the old came mostly who didn't die the natural death, came\nback. He was a miracle.",
        "A: Yes, twice I saw him.",
        "A: Yes. Mr. Eichmann.\n",
        "A: Eichmann. He is the nightmare. He came in, very handsome looking, funny face...you\nknow, something which 1s...which , very elegantly dressed, boots.",
        "A: He came into the Jewish . He said I am so and this is my name or his title...I don't\nremember what he was...and I am talking for my government. Now we are...we were\nallies and now we are enemies but we are still allies and when you want to uh have\nyour...have your...the the freedom a few Jewish people, and I will have request for you,\nand if you can give it to me, I will take a few out and they can stay or we're going to send\nthem...they don't go too far. We put them in the train, nice story. They will work. They\nwill help us out in the factories here, factories there and that's all. Now we knew this\nwasn't true because we heard the BBC. This was our...this was the bible because we knew\nthe truth.",
        "A: Eichmann did that, so he came in and he said I need now I don't know how many beds.\nGet them. Said we don't have beds. You have hospitals, Jewish hospitals, this hospital. I\nsend my men and we just tell them they should give it to them, so then he he got that.\nWhat do we get for that, we were asking, not to him but the... mean , so he said\nwell uh...he said a number, so we started to bargain.",
        "A: Of the people who...for the beds or for linen or for sewing machines or medications or\ndoctor's help, then you get...they wouldn't take x Jewish people...hundred, fifty, twenty.\nBut it didn't matter because we give everything for for lifes, so they just...but sometimes\nhe was very strong. I mean I want to have it done and then and then, and uh he got it. I\ndon't know how they did that, I mean this...my my my people, how they did that, but they\ndid it.",
        "A: Mr. Eichmann I saw a few times. Once I almost met him directly. That's a very funny\nthing. My husband was going down...it was still...he could go in to pick up to his\nbusiness. No subway...no no...with a with a subway. There was a small subway we had\nbut no streetcar, no buses. And uh his uh secretary with whom he met there to see what's\ngoing on called me around nine o'clock. We had still telephone but in secrecy because we\ndidn't...we were not allowed to have, so it was everything in a drawer, so I called him and\nI said John, in Hungarian, uh where is Mr. Brust? No. I'm sorry. He called me and\nhe says where is Mr. Brust, so he...I said what do you mean? He left at least three-\nquarters of hour. Even if he walked, he should be there in twenty...fifteen, twenty\n\nminutes. He said no, he's not in. So he said we are...I'\u2018m going down now and I'm going\nand I want to find out what happened. As I'm going down...a lot of people\nwalking and as I'm walking, a man and a...was a man and later a woman, as they are\ncoming opposite me, they are talking to me. They don't...we don't know each other. They\nsaid don't go too far because they are picking up men and women, the Germans. And they\njust walked by. This was like a message, so I know what could happen...could have\nhappened, so I went further, and I saw that there is a big commotion. I didn't go further\nbecause I didn't want to be picked up. I have a daughter and I don't have if I will be\npicked up. I went up to the Jewish , to the president whom I knew very well, and I\nsaid listen, I just found out...do you know anything about it? Well, you know, every\ncorner they do that now. So he said I'm not interested in that. See, I am just looking now\nin one corner and this is my husband. He gave you a lot of help and I have one help. I\nwant to know where he 1s, and you call up Mr. Eichmann...you know the Germans...and\nyou tell him that he is one of your people here who are helping him and his wife 1s\nhere...you can that, and I want to have him back. I can't do that. I can't call Eichmann.\nYou know, this...this was...he's the _ himself, so I said I am not leaving. I sleep here\nuntil you don't get...I don't care...Eichmann...whoever. Call up the German who give the\norder because there...every corner had a...so he saw that I am very stubborn, which I was.\nUsually I'm not. Maybe I am. I don't know, and he called up the Germans and he found\nout that a lot of men, mostly men, a few women but mostly men, were picked up who\nwere healthy looking, put in in a car...in a trunk...a truck, truck...and uh was taken up to\nclear and clean some house on the bigger side where we have villas, private homes, not\nuh building...apartment buildings, and this what they do, so he said find out where.\nI said I'm not inter...don't tell me stories. Just call and find out where. If not, call\nEichmann. I'm not going...he is coming to there. I know that this was the day when he\nusually came in for asking and I will stand there. Maybe he shoots me. I don 't care. But I\nwant to talk to him. So...excuse me...so he saw again that, you know, there is no end to\nhave me there so he figured he better...this meantime he walked 1n, just miracle again,\nand the president, he went in ...order order is what he said, so the president said,\nwell there is a lady whose husband you met a few times and he was helping me. She just\nfound out that he was picked up and was sent up to the mountain with many other men in\na covered truck to clean some buildings. She's asking you, and there he was, uh could you\nsend a message or something that he should be taken out from the whatever he does\nthere, cleaning, because he's more important here than cleaning a house and he's not so\ngood maybe in that. very funny face and said he will learn it, but he didn't say that\nand he...very elegantly he looked at me and said uh in German, , which means like\nmadame or whatever, and he said, I try my utmost. Hold on. Like a perfect gentleman. He\nwent away. He came back in a few minutes and he said don't worry. I know where\nhe...where these people were taken to different houses but I know where he is...he gives\nthe name...and I am sending up a car and we'll pick...will be picked up a few people\nincluded your husband. He didn't want to make one...this was very cleaver of him, and he\nwill come home. So I said to him, can I take your word...you know, smilingly. I didn't\ninsult him. So he said, like a German officer, he said. Then I said I believe. Thank you.\nAnd there I was walking onthe __ from there. Came back and started...I was calling\nimmediately our...his secretary...1 mean my husband's secretary, John. He is coming\nback. You walk on this side on the avenue and I'm walking this side. If he be in a truck,\nor alone, and he found him on the other side and they scream to me, call me, and when I\nsaw him I said what happened. This what happened. They picked him up. What happened\nto the other part. They were sent...not all...a few came down. He said I was picked up...he\nhad no idea what was going on, but I was up there. I didn't...[ wouldn't dare to tell him\nthat, and I never did, and I said well, I just talked to the president after all and I told him\nthat I would like to have you back because you are needed here.",
        "A: He went immediately back to the tothe and said I am back. Thank you for asking\nfor me and what can I do?",
        "A: He was , you know, . Then but this I didn't see. with his\norders and they were working together and get this and that and that. I think the biggest\nitem was for them...I don't even know why...sewing machines, because they were sewing\nuh clothes __ and what not.",
        "A: Until uh the Russians started to come from the north. They was our allies because they\nwere allies to the States, and then they closed up the houses. Everything was...we were in\nhiding. We were...this was before. We were still in our house. Then we went into hiding.\nWe went to the Swedish house. We were in hiding to our house. That came again a\nmiracle. My little daughter, Eva was up with the super. She didn't look like a little girl\nfrom the country. She looked like a city girl, gray suit with long hair, and there was\ncoming in a woman from the building...a lovely looking...I never met her before, and she\nasked...this I know from our super...asked uh who's that little girl? What a nice little girl.\nMy daughter got up immediately when she talked to her, and uh she said oh this is my\nsister's daughter, my son's nephew...my sister's daughter...she's my my uh...niece, and just\nfor a short time and she goes back to the country. When she says to...she told me the story\nand uh the janitor, the super...I I I didn't believe what I heard. She made a funny face and\nthen she said listen. She was a gentile woman. She lived in our building. She said I am\ngoing up to the mountains for uh skiing. I give you my keys for my apartment. This was\nvery unusual because we then...we did not have keys. We didn't give keys to the super.\nHere I do, because this is the way they have it, but uh there we didn't. We said there was\nalways somebody at our apartment, most of the time, and she said if you want to you can\nuse it or you want to put something in or take out something, I will be out there. Her\nhusband was a Jewish man who had a white...not yellow star...a white band, because he\nwas half...married to a gentile so this gave him...he wasn't taken out from the country.\nThis was the story. I never met him. I never her. So they left. Joseph comes in, down to\nthe basement and says you know, we are going up...around five o'clock I'm going up to\nthe . down into the basement. It was horrible down there. It was just horrible.",
        "A: First of all, it was cold. You had a tank for the heating system which did not work\nbecause they didn't put the heat on. We were...we heard the Germans...the the planes. We\nheard the Russians. We heard boots. We heard the war on the street. We...people came in\nthe building, Russians or the Germans. They were...any Jews here? They said that.\nNobody. So we will go around and see. Well, you know, to sit down in the basement and\nwaiting for them to come down, so Joseph said can I get you...this was...I never forget\nthat...can I get you a cup of tea. It's not too good but luckily our teapot...whatever we had\nthen. And they were so cold the Russians, so they sat down and they said thank you and\nuh I picked up naturally a few Russian words then and almost talked, not at that time but\nafter, and they left so then Joseph came down and said I take you up to an apartment. You\ndon't move. I bring you food, and I gave him my keys and I said you go over to my old\napartment. Whatever there you can carry, bring it over to your kitchen and from there\ngive us a little fruit...food. Your wife, you cook whatever and Eva should get some hot\nfood. So this what happened. He went up to this apartment, to this woman's apartment.\nNow I...we were...we stayed there for two weeks. I tell Joseph, Joseph put a little heat on.\nEverybody who is in the building should have heat, but it's not allowed. Don't worry.\nNobody will ask you that why do we have heat. They will be happy. They will give you a\ntip for that. I was right, so at least we didn't...we were in an apartment. This was a one\nbedroom apartment, one...living room, bedroom...or two bedrooms. The child had a\nbedroom and Eva was there. We had linens. It was clean.",
        "A: And the war was absolutely going on. We were bombing day and night.",
        "A: Oh this went on till the war was finished.",
        "A: Russia came in.",
        "A: And when we saw the first Russian...when we...we left this apartment after two weeks\nbecause uh the war, it it came in and uh we had a...my hus...my...wait a minute, how was\nthat? Oh, I know. Then we left and we called a friend. They lived there very close by. He\nwas an officer in the Hungarian army, a gentile person. He was working in my father's\nbusiness. I saw him...I showed you maybe the picture. He was a watch importer from\nSwitzerland, and actually I didn't even call him. He found out...he came in the building,\nfound...finding us, trying to find us. Not he but she, the wife of his, lovely, tall, good-\nlooking woman asked Joseph where are they. So he said I want to talk to. [have an\napart...uh a home up on the mountains, which is a beautiful . We had there too but\nwe didn't talk about it, and this was given by a Jewish family that we should take care of\nit, and this is empty. We are going up there. We don't want to stay in the city. I want to\nhave these three people, so we went up to that apartment. Finally, the husband, who was\nan officer of the Hungarian army, was in Russia, was all over the German army because\nwe were allies. He came home without permission. He was afraid. The Germans...he was\nnot the Germans anymore, with the Germans because they became enemies. He was with\nthe Russians, but he was in Russia with the Germans, so this was a very unpleasant\nfeeling for him, and he was afraid so he left the army. He took...they took off his army\nstuff except a beautiful jacket which he picked up in Germany...in Russia, with uh\nfur...fur-lined, and he came up and so we got in to this apart...to this beautiful house.\nThere was another officer, . He...when the Russians came ___....first time I saw a\nRussian soldier in the other house , | was looking out in the...on the window and I\nsaid this is Russian. I saw the uniform, cap, so I went down. I was stepping on a on a high\nchair then because I was peeking really, and I said I don't want to tell you. They're going\nto frighten you, but the Russians are here. He said what are you talking about? So my\nhusband =. This was___ too, a very nice looking man, and the wife and the wife's\nmother, and they had a child which remain still in correspondence, in Hungary. Uh...",
        "A: Well, they were happy, except him and uh well, I wasn't sure if I'm happy or not because\nI didn't...first of all, I knew that they are with the Americans so they cannot be that bad.\nOn the contrary, they are allies, but I didn't know that. So they came from house to house\nand they came into our house. The first one was , which means give me your\nwatch. And this was a nightmare. Your not stealing from my hand. So my husband said\nin Hungarian, give it to him. After I gave it to him, he gave it back to me. He had at least\nten watches on his arm. I'm not joking. He said where are the children? So our friends\nwho owned...that owned what he was taking care of the house, he had a son, my\ndaughter, and there was another unpleasant child which she never met before, and they\nwere the owner's son. He was there with a little house in the back, and they were hidden\nthere. So so we were very...then __ cames out with his beautiful fur-lined coat. When\nthat Russian sees that...he was not a tall man, the Hungarian fellow...he picked him up\nlike that and ___ where did you get that coat? This is a Russian...he spoke Russian. He\nsaid I got it... was in Russia as an officer...or as a prisoner. It wasn't true but he was\nstealing it from the Russian which was...they steal from him. They were stealing from\nhim, so he was stealing back and he was cold. He didn't believe that and then...but he put\nhim down and he said keep your coat, but we are here now and you will help us speaking\nHungarian and Russian, so he was like, you know, helping out, translating.\n",
        "A: Well, not yet. Oh no. This Russians...they were not bad. They were horrible looking with\nnewspapers packed...uh their shoes. There were no shoes. They were using cigarettes and\nnewspapers, picking up uh leaves, you never saw anything like that. They picked us up.\nThis Russian commander went...he became our friend. He brought some bread, but he\nwas stealing that he was bring here. This was always...this was fine. A big Russian...1t\nwas late evening...he comes in to the...the Germans are coming back. We take you down.\nWe belong to them. And we didn't mind. To get Russian is better than the Germans. I\ndon't know why but this...this was normal feeling and uh we were all transferred. There\nwas a lot of people again and we got in a truck. We went down...I never was there...",
        "A: Down... ...we went down and we went out of Budapest which 1s let's say if I\nwould come, get out from New York City from Manhattan and I'm getting over to White\nPlains and then going up near near New York State...",
        "A: It 1t was not a suburb. It was a...it was a completely different little town, a village which\nthe Russians took over from the Germans and there were bodies...German bodies. \u2014__\nthat we had to get out from the trunk, from the truck and uh we were lined up. I said to\nmy husband, Eva stays with...before me because if they shoot me I want she should be\nshot too, and then next you. I didn't want to leave the child alone. And we were ready for\nthat, and then one of the Russians came in and said what are you doing? I brought them\ndown. They are our people, so they went back. They didn't shoot us. They were ...was\nstarting to get dark, and we were still walking. Eva was before me. She was...I want to go\nback. I want to slow down. I didn't let her...permit her to go...permit to go in the back.\nFigured I'd loose her like that. She's always before me, so sand a man comes out.\nFrom far away , physically . This is...where are you going? So we said we\nwant to go to sleep somewhere. Where are you from? So we said we are from the\ncountry. What is your name? We changed the Brust to Bollage (ph) which in Europe it's\nvery...like here sometimes you can change it a Polish name or German name to make it\nAmerican sounding, so Bollage is a very good name and a lot of families, a lot of people\nin our families changed it. It sounded beautiful. I always said, don't you want to...I want\nto be Brust. So I said fine, and we are Brust , SO I told my name that we are that.\nYou come with us, and some other people with whom we met there, so we went there,\nand he had a little house and he had a basement for I don't know what, maybe washing\nor...we didn't have washing machines...and he gave us that and he gave...uh there was a\nmattress, two mattresses, and there was a...\nPAUSE - BLANK IN TAPE\n",
        "A: Yeah. So when the Russians started out during the war that they were liberating us, and\nwe were really lucky because when they went down to the village, there were Russians\ncoming and going through the village. They...sometimes they came in in the houses and\nuh brought some food or...and that we should do its food and we should do it, and I\nwasn't a good cook and my husband had no idea what what cooking is, but there were\nothers, so we helped. And then what they didn't use, they didn't eat up, they left it for us,\nbut we couldn't do anything with that, but we were afraid from them. That's the honest\ntruth. Even so they were liberating and I felt that uh they won't harm us, uh it was a very\ndifficult time.",
        "A: Uh this is very funny. Once a high officer, grey*haired, tall man.... can see his face |\nlike a wild animal in the...in that little whatever that was and uh he said who you, who\nyou, who you? I spoke rather very simple Russian. You pick up, you know, a few weeks\nyou are with them...you pick it up the everyday words, so I said husband, wife, daughter,\nand he picks up Eva...I almost died...and holds her and I said uh...I asked him would you\ngive it back to me? So he said no, no. I don't harm him...her. So this...this was the end of\nthe beginning. So uh...alright...so he...because you asked about Jewish, so he asked us,\nare you Jewish, or are you Catholic? Hungary is a Catholic country. And we didn't look\nJewish, let's put it that way... no characteristics, nothing like that. So my husband...again,\nhe was the cleaver...he said we are Jews and running from the Germans. Don't forget they\nwere not allies anymore. They were against each other, so he goes into his pocket and I\nthought, my God, he will shoot us. He takes out a little prayer book and gives it to my\nhusband. He cannot read Hebrew so I cannot either. I learned it in school because we\nhave...the the Jewish children go to the Jewish uh religious hour and the Catholics to the\nCatholic _, same time. We just go different and then we go back regular. So uh...and\nI...and I knew that he he was because this was old-fashioned Hebrew and and so I tell\nhim, uh I will tell you the the Jewish prayer \u2014_ which I learned when I was a baby and\nthat's all I know. He looks at me. He knows it, so he said sure he knows and she...Eva\nknows it, my daughter. He didn't...he put back his prayer book and he knew that we are.\nHe gave candy to Eva and he said, I am a Jewish Russian Jew and I promised myself that\nwhenever I see a child, German or anything, I just do the same what they did to my\nchildren. They throw them out in the window. Funny. When he took Eva, I got\nfrightened. I didn't know what it was. So he said I don't do anything to you. I bring you\nfood until he was stationed in there and he did. Eva came back to me, naturally. She\ndidn't even realize what went on, you know, because she didn't believe in bad and good.\nIn good she did, but not in bad things. That man was for a few days there. Then he\ndisappeared. They were picked up with, you know, with the army and they went. Then\nwe went to clean. I always carried Eva. I never took my husband. He was staying there. I\n____ cleaning up a place where the horses were and the cows were, __ like that. I dida\ngood cleaning, but after that we got two big loaf of bread, the Russian bread. You know,\nwhat we have here, the white bread...it's squarish (ph), and then we started to run because\nwe figured I don't have the bread...I clean my whatever I had to. I don't want to get\npicked up. The reason the Kozack (ph) with the horses, they run all over, and as I said I\nspoke a few so they got close to us and one was bending down from this big horses and\nasked some Hungarian name, village and I told them to go this way. Thank you, and he\nwent. Let me tell you, in ten minutes we were home, so called home. I said I I I I don't\nknow how I survived it.",
        "A: The Russian...under the Russian...",
        "A: Under the Russia ...all the women put on their scarf and they were hiding their\nyouth with . I mean I was myself a young woman and uh and they were raped.\nThey were...these the men were horrible, the Russians. And I didn't have a scarf. I didn't\nhave anything. Naturally I wasn't grayish like now. I had light brown hair and otherwise I\nlooked the same except much, much younger. They never, never touched me, so when we\ncame back...this was...this 1s again a miracle. Never. When we came back and we met our\nwomen friends and we talk, everybody said their story and it became a saying...cam you\nimagine, even the Russians didn't want to have Lilly. This was...you know...I was...so I\nsaid yes. I'm as ugly, I was old...not even they wanted to have me...",

        "A: But I was home. I was home. Nobody was in the apartment, so my husband didn't have to\nkill or throw anybody out. He wouldn't have it done anyway and we started to clean up\nthe mess. I was...we were all going around looking up for the friends, for the relatives,\nwho are thee, who are there. If we were walking on the street like ghosts. Some people\ncame back from Austria with their outfits. The Americans were in Italy, in Vienna, in\nGermany naturally. I was...tried to get in contact with husband...with my parents, with\nmy father. My mother died here in '42, so I never saw her again, and Leslie was in the\narmy. I knew that but I didn't know where, he's alive. We were very close, and then I got\nfrom the military mission in Hungary who was General Key, K - E - Y, called me in,\nsend out somebody and find out if you are alive. And then actually a Mr. Webster who\nwas a Navy man...he was the one who was sent out by him...he's a little fellow,\nlovely...we fall in love with each other...not I and he but you know, the family...he was\ncompletely in white uniform and uh I am bring a message from Leslie Schwarcz, my\ndaughter.

He was shipped in from uh California, Camp Kilmer,\nCalifornia, to uh...he went to , Africa, Rommel (ph). They had the war there. Then\nfrom there he went to Italy, to Casino (ph).
