Many of\nthem you know they just couldn't run or anything like that,\nthey were just you could see that they could just bar barely\nwalk.

JOE KAHOE Page 4\nmore concerned of making sure that these GI's wouldn't feed\num. Because they had been warned and knowing other\nAmerican's solders were, it it's pretty hard with all the\nstuff we had not to give them something. And some of them,\nsome of them did feed um, but that was in my position our\nhardest thing and we talked about how how bad they looked.\nWe talked about that and wondered. We had, we didn't know\ntoo much about the all the camps that had been liberated or\nreally at that time all the atrocities that had gone in the\ncamp. Uh in fact there the only men, basically all we saw\nwere were men in this camp. I I can't recall seeing any any\nchildren or women. That's all I Saw was were men.\nSWB:\nJOE KAHOE: No No. No....\nSWB:\nJOE KAHOE: We We knew that they were pris eh we thought that\nthey were just regular Polish or German or Jewish or Polish\nor Jewish prisoners and we we knew who what they were. But\nsee by being on the move there was no stand'n around. We\nwere concerned about not hurting any of um. Or let them have\nhurt themselves because in many cases, you know, they came\nso close to the vehicles uh it wouldn't have take too much\nfor some of them to fall and get run over and what not. I\nimagine people gave them cigarettes if if they asked for\nany. But I don't think, it didn't look to me that they were\nin ah ah begging type mood. I think the main thing were\nanswered in their freedom and and getting on in some shelter\nOr away at least from that prison camp.\nSWB:\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.
