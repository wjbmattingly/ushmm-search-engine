        "Q: Let's talk a little bit about your family life.",
        "A: My parents came to Berlin as students. They are not Germans. They are both from Latvia.\nUh...My mother is the seventh of eight children, and a family where Russian...they spoke\nRussian at home, and...uh....a little Yiddish. Two of my mother's elder brothers...one brother\nand sister went to Leningrad, and uh...uh my mother uh...went to Germany to study. She had\na magnificent voice. Uh, let me... My father was the youngest of six children. Uh, his father\nwas a businessman. They were of more ethnic German background in Latvia. Uh, my father\nwent to German schools in Latvia. My mother went to Russian schools. Uh, my parents\nalways spoke Russian to each. My mother's father was a painter and a cantor. And uh died\nwhen he...when she was very young. Uh, some of his paintings were so outstanding that uh...\nMy mother's house was always full of...my mother grew up in household full of paintings,\nand some of his paintings were so outstanding that she even was asked once to donate two of\nthe paintings to the Louvre, but... In Paris, later on. But uh naturally, she only had a few of\nthem and kept them with her. And she still has them. Uh, my parents met as teenagers,\nbecause uh...their older siblings (laughter) were married...got married. My mother's older\nsister got...was married to my father's older brother. Both my parents had magnificent voices.\nUh, my father was a baritone. My mother uh...went to Riga to study at the Conservatory. Uh,\nshe was known there as the girl with the golden voice. Uh, their home town was Liep_ja,\nwhich in Russian is Liyepaya [Ger: Libau]. I... They both when to Germany as poor students.\nMy father went first. He uh registered both in engineering school and at the Hochschule fir\nMusik, although he first started at the Hochschule fur Musik in Berlin. My mother followed\nlater. They were married in 1928 in Latvia, with both families present; and then they went\nback to study in Germany. Uh, one day my father sang...had the opportunity the audition for\nthe composer Mascagni, who urged him to go to Italy with his beautiful voice. But he had no\nmoney, and he was on full scholarship in Germany. And so Mascagni said, \"____ Italia.\" My\nfather felt he had...had no choice but stay in Germany. Uh, my mother finished the\nConservatory in Riga, and moved to Ber...to Berlin; and studied at the Conservatory there,\ntoo. Uh, shortly after they were married, my father got a job offer to sing at the Breslau [NB:\nWroclaw] Opera Company. He took a stage name, Yasha Lenssen. Uh, his real name is\nJacob...Jacob Levinsons. My mother is Pauline Levine. Uh, he was asked to sing the leading\nroles in 19 operas--the baritone roles. But soon after, they found out that uh his stage name,\nLenssen, really was Levinsons--which, of course, he was not about to hide anyway. Uh, they\ndecided to cancel his contract. This was in the early '30s in Germany. So my father, having\ncompleted some of his university studies at that time, decided to go into business in\nGermany. And his father helped him out by uh introducing him to someone who needed a\ncontact in Germany for a business. And so my father became a representative in Berlin for a\nbusiness firm abroad, and was quite successful at that. And they started uh...from being very\npoor students and living in very, very cramped one-room (laughing) without any money at\nall, both on scholarships, to being able to set themselves up in a little apartment in Berlin.\nMy father did quite well. Uh, I was born at that time--as I said, in 1934. And when I was\nabout uh 6 months old, my parents decided that I should have a photograph taken of me; and\nmy mother took me to a photographer. One of the best in Berlin! And he did...he made a\nvery beautiful picture--which my parents thought, at least, was a very beautiful picture--\nwhich my parents had framed and put on the piano that my father gave my mother as a\npresent when I was born. And there was this picture on the piano. One day, the lady who\ncame to clean...help my mother clean the apartment, Frau Klauke, said to my mother, \"You\nknow, I saw Hessy on a magazine cover in town.\" And my mother thought surely she must\nbe mistaken, that there are many babies that look alike, and just told her, \"Well, that couldn't\nbe [the] case.\" Uh, the lady insisted; and she says, \"No, no, no, no. It's definitely Hessy. It's\nthis picture. And...and just give me some money, and I'll get you the magazine.\" And so my\nmother did. And sure enough, this lady came back with a magazine, the front cover which\nsaid, \"Sonne ins Haus\"--which in German means, \"the Sun in the Home.\" And there was the\npicture on the piano reproduced on the front cover of this magazine. This magazine was\npublished out of Leipzig, and very definitely one of the few magazines allowed to circulate\nin Germany at the time, because it was a Nazi magazine. On the inside of the magazine were\npictures of the Army with men wearing swastikas. There's a picture of the Fuhrer himself\nreviewing the troops. There were pictures of the Hitlerjugend, and uh several of their\nactivities, both in marching and in campfires and all other activities. It was a family\nmagazine. My parents were horrified. They didn't know quite how this came about; except\nthat my mother, naturally, rushed over to the photographer. She said to him, \"What is this?\nHow did this happen?\" And the photographer quickly sort of closed the door, pulled the\nblinds, and told her to...very quietly admonished her to keep quiet. And he says, \"Sssh...I will\ntell you the following. I was asked to submit the...my ten best pictures for a beauty contest\nrun by the Nazis. So were ten other outstanding photographers in Germany. So ten\nphotographers submitted their ten best pictures. And I sent in your baby's picture.\" And my\nmother said, \"But you knew that this is a Jewish child.\" And the photographer said, \"Yes.\"\nAnd this is a quote that I have always... My parents say he said, in German, \"Ich wollte mir\nden Spass erlauben\"--\"I wanted to allow myself the pleasure of this joke.\" And then he told\nmy mother, \"And you see, I was right. Of all the babies, they picked this baby as the perfect\nAryan.\" There was a beauty competition to select a baby that would represent the perfect\nexample of the Aryan race to further the Nazi philosophy. That was pro...being promoted in\nGermany at the time. Magazine came out in early 1935. Uh, my parents were both shocked\nby the possible consequences that this could bring, and amazed at the irony of it all. But they\nfelt at the moment to keep...that 1t was best to keep it quiet. (Cough) Well, before...there\nwere several consequences that resulted from this. (Cough) (Drinking water) Uh, one, my\nparents noted right away that dress shops that advertised beauti...that had baby clothes, that\nwere selling baby clothes had put the picture in their store front windows. Uh, post cards\nwere reproduced made from that picture just for mailing. They were used...they were on\nevery newsstand in the country. They were post cards. One day, one of my mother's...my\nfather's sisters, Ida...my Tante Ida--who was living in Lithuania at the time--went into a store\nto buy me a birthday card for my first birthday. That was in May '35. And she picked up...she\nsaw that picture with a statement on the bottom \" \"--\"Best wishes to the Birthday\"--\nas a birthday card. And my Aunt Ida went to the cashier and said, \"Where did you get this\nphoto?\" She says, \"Oh, this is not just a picture. This is a real baby. It's a Berliner baby.\" And\nmy aunt didn't say another word, but she bought the postcard uh...which my parents brought\nwith them throughout the years. Uh, things were turning from bad to worse in Germany at\nthe time, as we all know. Uh, one of the things that happened is that my mother was\nsomewhat careful about taking me to the Tiergarten, and going with me places. She didn't\nwant people to recognize me...uh certainly when I started to talk, [to] say what my name\nwas. My Aunt Masha, my youngest...my mother's younger sister, came from Latvia at the\ntime of my birth and spent a lot of time with me then, too. And uh...she too is often very\ncareful about where she took me and where we went. Uh, my mother had one friend who...of\nthe family, Mrs. Grossman, who went to visit a friend of hers...uh in a small town in\nGermany. Uh, I don't remember the name of the town, but it was not anywhere near Berlin. I\nthink it was in the mountains somewhere. And this woman went to visit her friend, and\nfound my baby picture framed on the wall in her house. And Mrs. Grossman said, uh, \"My\nGosh! Where did you get this picture?\" She said, \"Oh, this was...I got this from the\nmagazine. Isn't that beautiful?\" And Mrs. Grossman said, \"But that is Hessy Levinsons.\"\nAnd the woman said, \"What! Levinsons, did you say?\" And she ripped the...her picture off\nfrom wall. Woman...and said, \"Levinsons!?\" And she was going to throw it away. And\nlooked at it again and said, \"No. This baby is too cute.\" And she hung it back on the wall.\nThose were just few of the incidences that happened at the time. Uh, my parents had uh been\nwarned before...even before I was born. They had consulted the Latvian Consulate about\nwhat to do, about how long to stay in Germany and so on. And the Latvian Consulate told\nthem, \"Don't worry. German Jews... I mean, you're not Germans. And as Latvians, you don't\nhave anything to worry about it. You'll... I let you know when it's time to leave. Don't... You\ndon't have to leave yet.\" And my parents... That's why my parents stayed for awhile. But uh\nmy sister was born at the end of 1936. And my father was set up doing fairly well, as I said.\nAt one point, he had a very bad experience, however. He was sitting in his office with an\naccountant. This accountant was a devoted member of the Nazi party, but he also got to like\nand respect my parents very much. He became very friendly with my parents. Hieronomus\n(ph) was his name. And in fact, one day, my...Hieronomous (ph) came to the house and\nasked my mother to help him sew on his swastika armband, because it was coming loose.\nFortunately, it was a Sabbath and my mother said to him, \"You know, as a Jew I am not\nallowed to sew on the Sabbath.\" So she got out of that one easily enough, cleverly enough, I\nthought. Uh, however, Hieronomus (ph) played a very important role in our lives. Uh, there\nwas one day when the Gestapo marched into my father's office and simply arrested him. It\nhad turned out that somebody had reported him, for some reason that remains obscure. One\nof the uh people with whom he was dealing apparently reported him. And my father was\ntaken away by the Gestapo, and Hieronomus (ph) did (chuckle) a classic movie type scene.\nHe got in his car and followed the car that my father was in. He was taken to some\nheadquarters. And within minutes, Hieronomus (ph) had followed, threw open the doors,\napparently screamed, \"Heil Hitler!\" He was immediately admitted to the room. And\nHieronomus (ph) vouched for my father as not being uh in any way associated with anything\nanti the Regime. My mother also had some experiences that were sort of unpleasant. One of\nthe neighbors in the house had uh reported her as having criticized Hitler once. She just...a\ncomment she had made on one of...photographs that Hitler made once. And the landlord of\nthe building vouched for my mother. [He] said, \"No, she could never have said anything\nunpleasant about our leader.\" And so there were people who helped them here and there. But\nthings got very, very tenuous. And so my father decided to move to Paris. And we moved to\nParis before the war. During this time, my parents were very close to their families. And we\nhad spent every summer in Latvia. Uh, in 1938, we had spent the summer in Latvia again.\nUh, that was the last time we went, because in the summer of '39 my father said, \"This year\nwe are not going.\" And probably if he hadn't made that decision, I wouldn't be here today. In\nany case, all those who were left behind were...died in the war. The only people who\nsurvived were one brothers of my mother's who came to America; some of my father's older\nbrothers and sisters who had come here also when he was a child, long before the war; my\nAunt Masha, who was with us in Germany, who went to England; and my aunt and uncle\nwho had moved to Leningrad. Everyone else landed up being victims of the Holocaust.\nMy...L...1...1 should say... Let me back up a little. My two grandfathers had died before the\nwar. My mother's father died when she was a child--the painter. Uh, my father's father died\nshortly before I was born, and I was named after him. His name was Hessel (ph). Uh, we\nmoved to Paris, and life there was both interesting and difficult. Interesting, because my\nparents enjoyed the cultural life and excitement that the city has to offer; but difficult,\nbecause of the times, of course, and the difficulty of getting settled. My father was amazingly\ningenious, and was able to set up business and start working again. Uh, after Paris fell, I\nbecame very conscious...I was told, \"Don't speak German on the streets.\" And my sister and\nI were very conscious of the fact that we... somehow it was bad to speak German, and we...it\nwas very difficult for us, who grew up speaking... At that time we spoke German and French.\nBut uh I remember one time we were befriended by some German soldiers, and they gave us\nchocolates. And we started talking to them, until we realized that we had been told not to do\nthat and then ran away, very quickly. (Chuckle) Anyway, uh we were in France\naltogether...uh we were in Paris when France fell, and...or became occupied. And at one\npoint, the concierge of my parents\u2019 building--which was tn the very elegant area of the 16th\narrondissement in France, in Paris--uh told...warned us that Germans were coming and\nrounding up Jews, and suggested that we not go back to the apartment right away. My father\nthen arranged for my mother and my sister and I uh to uh go to [Mimac (ph)]-sur-Mer. My\nsister 18 called Noemi. So Noemi, my mother and I moved to [Mimac (ph)]-sur-Mer, which\nis in...on the coast, on the Atlantic Coast of France--not far from Bordeaux. My father stayed\nin Paris trying to arrange ways to leave. He um...my mother had a rather difficult time in\n[Mimac (ph)]|-sur-Mer. Uh, the...she was conscious of being the only Jew in this so-called\nresort hotel where we...my father had arranged for us to stay. I remember distinctly there was\none Frenchman who was rather aloof and cold and severe looking. But he had a big dog that\nNoemi and I loved to play with, and we played with him quite a bit. Well, one day the\nlandlady of the resort told my mother that she would have to leave. That she was under too\nmuch pressure, and that she could not keep us anymore. So my mother went to the Chief of\nPolice of the town, and he was very cooperative. He said to her, \"I believe that there are\npeople in this town who are not acting in the best interest for France. I will see what I can do\nin your behalf.\" So my mother felt reassured. Shortly thereafter, the man with the dog\ndisappeared. It turned out that he was spying for the Germans; and the Chief of Police was\nonly too glad to have been able to accumulate enough evidence that I guess he had from\nother sources to arrest him. Nevertheless, my mother's life got to be more and more\ncomplicated and trying. And soon enough, shortly thereafter the concierge came and told my\nmother the same story again. But this time, there was no question that she would have to\nleave by the next day. My mother tried her friend, the Chief of Police, again. And he told\nher, \"Madame Levinsons, I have done everything I can for you.\" He could handle French,\nbut right now the Germans were down his back and now he couldn't do anything further for\nher. So that night, my mother tells me that she resorted to all praying and pleading for\nhelp...dlong sigh)...at guidance for her family from the Lord for some way of trying to see\nwhat she could do so she would not get separated from her husband because that's how\nfamilies got separated during the war, and she knew that if she had to leave, he would never\nfind us again. And while she was up that whole night, pacing the whole night, around 4\no'clock in the morning there was a knock on the door, and the concierge was knocking said,\n\"Madame Levinsons! Madame Levinsons! Votre mari est arriv\u00e9.\"--\"Your husband is here.\"\nIt was the most joyous moment my mother could imagine at the time. We packed up the car,\nand the four of us drove away and we drove to meet a group. And my own memory 1s rather\nvague of that at the time. But we joined up with a group that was going to take us across\noccupied territory to the Zone Libre [NB: \"Free Zone\"], which Nice was still in the Zone\nLibre at the time. We met some other people from Paris also, some other friends of ours.\nAnd...in this group; and we apparently at one point, we went by truck to a certain point, and\nthen we had to go across the woods, walking through swamp that...and be very, very quiet--\nbecause apparently a German encampment was behind the woods. At the end of that road, at\nthe end of those...there would be another truck to meet us. Uh, I did not know those details at\nthe time. (Chuckle) What knew is that this very ominous looking Frenchman, who had this\nenormous knife around his belt, took it out and told the children that any kid who opened his\nmouth would have his tongue cut out. Let me tell you, I have never forgotten that moment.\n(Chuckle) I went with my lips sealed like this throughout the entire escapade. Except that, at\none point, I couldn't contain myself and I asked my father's friend--who held me by the hand-\n-I said, \"What are we doing?\" He said, \"This is a sport. We're running. This is a sport.\" And I\nsaid, \"I hate this sport.\" And then I saw this guy with a knife, and I contained myself. The\nbabies, the children--including my sister Noemi--were all fed chocolates. They got all the\nchocolates one could round up during the war to keep these kids quiet. We got to the Zone\nLibre, and immediately my father applied for American immigration. Uh, I think, 1n fact, 1f--\nalthough my memory is not quite sure about this at the time--I think, in fact, that my father\nhad applied for it while he was still in Paris, and had been granted it at that point when we\narrived in Nice. But when you get an American immigration visa--which is hard to get,\nbecause you need to prove that you can sustain yourself and, you know, you're not going to\nland up being on welfare or burden to anyone in this country, uh ...and that you are good\nhealth and so. But even after all this, you are told that you have 90 days to reach American\nshores. And my father realized, as time was going by, that there was no way in which he\ncould get his family to the U.S. within the time timeframe left. Thirty days before the visa\nexpired, he requested an extension from Washington. The Atlantic...you know, across the\nAtlantic, there were no commercial flights at the time. Uh, this was in 1941. Uh, the ocean\nwas patrolled. Submarines...uh... Anyway, we waited for a reply from Washington. And [it]\neventually came, and it said, \"No.\" They denied us an extension. So, again, (sigh) I guess I\ncould say it's not thanks to Uncle Sam that I am sitting here today. My father tried every\navenue available to him. He went to a series of Latin American consulates in France, and\nuh...1n Nice; and eventually landed up with a Cuban Consulate who would listen to him, also\naccept some money, and granted him visas to Cuba. Uh, we spent a relatively...my sister and\nI have relatively nice memories of Nice. Uh, it was...it was not much food. My parents never\nwanted to touch ratatouille again, because that's the only thing they ate for 8 months.\n(Chuckle) Uh, we didn't go to school, of course. We did try to lead some kind of normal\nsemblance of life. I remember it was that time when I learned swimming. I learned to swim,\nhad some swimming lessons. Somehow tried to lead a fairly normal life. The one very\nimportant person joined us at that time who had been left behind at Paris for a while, and that\nis our nurse, uh Gerta. Gerta was a German-Jewish nurse who came to take care of me when\nmy sister was born. In other words, my mother hired her in Berlin. Uh, I was extremely\nspoiled at the time. (Laughing) I'm back tracking a bit. Gerta had a terrible time with me.\n(Laughter) Maybe partly because of all the fuss that was made about me. But anyway, she\nvowed that the next baby's not going to be so spoiled. Gerta was extremely attached to\nNoemi. To me, too, I think, eventually. In any case, my parents were very devoted to her;\nand we both grew up feeling very close to her, uh and Gerta was with us in Nice. My\nfather...uh eventually got us a visa to Cuba, and was told that Gerta would get the visa\neventually, too, to the United States, because she had a brother in the United States. So we\nleft, and went to Marseilles. In Marseilles, we waited for a ship to take us to Cuba. It's funny,\nyou know. When I think back, my mother says she was wonderful...very good student in\nschool except in geography. And geography was her worst subject. She didn't even know\nwhere Cuba was on the map before she found out about us, and here we were going to go to\nCuba. But, in any case, uh the uh one interesting thing happened before we left. My father\nheard that Gerta was not going to get the visa to the United States, and that she was left\nbehind. And he was going to try to get her out. But by that time, there was a German line of\ncontrol and you had to have special passes to go from Nice to Marseilles-- which we had, but\nmy father did not have a pass to go back and get her. And he really wanted to go back and\nget Gerta out. So he thought he's going to try it anyway. He boarded a train in Marseilles\nwithout a pass. He had a ticket, but that wasn't the issue. And he got himself...he got on the\ntrain, and then he thought of a very clever way to foil the French. When he got to the border-\n-the \"border\" in the sense of the occupied zone--and, of course, at that time the Petain regime\nwas cooperating with the Germans. Although they were all French patrolling, they were all\ncooperating with the Germans. And he thought [to] himself, \"There is only one way to foil\nthe French. What 1s it that is holy to the French? Dining and eating 1s holy to the French.\" So\nhe went to the dining car, and started eating and eating and eating and drinking and wined.\nAnd they sat at that border for hours, and he kept on eating non-stop. He wasn't do diddling\nor daddling. He was eating. And he ate for several hours, and nobody touched him. And he\nmade it to Nice. And when he made it to Nice, he had a gold cigarette case that he went to\npawn to get some money. And he got that money, and was able to help Gerta in case she\nneeded passage. And then he went back to the Cuban Consulate and said he needs another\nvisa. And the Consulate denied. He says, \"Impossible! Impossible! I am already in hot water\nfor having given you all this. Impossible! I have given away too many. I cannot give another\nperson.\" My father was not dis...easily to be dissuaded; and he persisted and persisted, and,\nof course, they got nowhere for awhile. And finally the Cuban Consulate said, \"You know,\nthere is an old law on the books that when you're given your visa, you can take all your\npossessions with you. Now, the old law says that slaves are a possession of the owner.\nWould you say that this lady is...woman is your slave?\" And my father quickly said, \"Yes.\nShe is my slave and my possession, and she needs to come with me.\" And on that basis,\nGerta got the grant...visa to come to Cuba. But she did not have a pass to get back to\nMarseilles, and that was too dangerous. He somehow arranged for her to get to Casablanca.\nAll of this was extremely complicated and extremely difficult to do. My father was really\nvery ingenious. Uh, and somehow, again, he got himself back to Marseilles through the line.\nApparently, on the way back there was not such a long border stop. But the big crisis was on\none way. He had...he did have his visa to Cuba on...to show that he could get out. So on the\nway back, it wasn't quite as difficult for him as rationale for going into Nice. We sailed on a\nPortugese ship, the _(ph), from Marseilles in the beginning of 1942. Uh, I remember\nstopping in Casablanca to an impression I will never forget. The dazzling sun, the enormous\namount of sand, women were all veiled, long robes for men. I thought this was some\nstorybook. I had no idea what was happening and where we were. I was absolutely stunned\nat this image. Uh, we were not...we did not get off the boat. But in Casablanca, Gerta got on.\nAnd that was a very emotional reunion. Then we proceeded across the Atlantic with a ship\nfull of refugees. My dear father provided for his family. We had a first class cabin all to\nourselves. Before leaving Europe, my...one of the things my father had arranged for, while\nhe was still in Paris, is to have all our furniture stored someplace safely in Europe. And so he\nhad it stored in Portugal. And the reason was not so much the furniture--although it was quite\nelegant Queen Anne furniture which my parent...father had set up this very lovely apartment\non the Rue de Messine in Paris when we had lived there. But the thing that was critical in\nthat...in...in...1n that box that the furniture [was in] were my grandfather's paintings. There\nwere three of them...three paintings in there, which my father managed to store in Portugal,\nand which we recuperated after the war and after we came to the United States. The three\npaintings are, one, a self portrait of my grandfather, who looks like Toulouse-Lautrec--big\nblack hat, big fur coat, very distinguished looking. A picture...painting of his father-in-law, [\n_(ph)], in the morning. The light shining on him looks like that picture would come alive. I\nthink that was the one that they wanted for the Museum. And a third picture, of a painting of\na poor man who used to not always have enough food that my grandmother used to offer a\ncup of tea. She'd offer him some borscht or some tea, and would feed him. And so that's the\nportrait, the third painting that we have. My Aunt Masha brought two other paintings too.\nUh, one is a magnificent...uh...paysage [Fr: \"landscape\" ]--a scene of trees, the Berioshkas in\nsnow. And another is uh a scene of a...one of their brothers studying for Bar Mitzvah. So\nthose are the five paintings that we now have in New York. Anyway, we went on to Cuba.\nThe boat...it took 3 and a half weeks to cross the Atlantic through a very circuitous route--to\nthe very south, because we needed to avoid the war zones. Uh, we went far south, I believe,\nto cross and landed up first in Jamaica, which was again a very interesting uh sight for me.\nThe...the trees, the climate, the people carrying baskets on their heads. I remember little\nthings like that. Anyway, we went on to Cuba. This entire ship full of refugees, the entire\nhull of the ship, the basement people sleeping on the floor, all these people... (Sigh) We got\noff on Cuba and were put in a camp. It was called Camp Tiscornia. Uh, they didn't quite\nknow what to do with us either. (Laughter) Which I guess was true of all the refugees, all\nfrom Europe and all different...many places. And we spent several weeks in Tiscornia,\nduring which time my father figured how 1s he going to get started. He had pawned most of\nwhat he had in Europe to pay for visas and passage and boat; and we had just some, you\nknow, few suitcases of personal possessions with us. He started to go to several banks in\nCuba and asked for a loan to help him get started for a business. Uh, he had a lot of courage.\nHe just walked into many of the banks, mostly American banks that were uh...had had, you\nknow, large branches in Cuba. And (Laughter) they all asked, \"What do you have for\ncollateral?\" \"Myself. I am an honest man, and offer you me as collateral.\" And, as you can\nimagine, a bank doesn't deal with this kind of business. And they all laughed at him. Until,\none day, he walked into the Royal Bank of Canada. And the Canadian uh officials at the\nbank looked at him and said, \"You know what? We think we're going to give you a chance.\nWe'll take our luck with you.\" And so they helped my father get started. He started first with\nuh some working in pin...with pineapple business, which was a wonderful product of Cuba,\nbut realized that soon enough that wasn't going to be good for export to the United States\nbecause of competition from Hawaii. So he, by that time, got very clever about realizing that\nthe Cubans had good cattle and were throwing away all kinds of meat casings and so on.\nThings that were...from the slaughter houses, things that were in ample use in Chicago. Uh,\nand he decided to set up a factory, the first factory...such factory in Cuba. Uh, we lived a\nvery good life in Havana. We learned Spanish. Uh, we learned English, because my parents\nthought that we should go to a...someday we might still come to the United States. So they\nwanted to send us to a English-speaking school. My parents were shocked at the American\nschool in Havana. Uh, the American kids seemed to them totally undisciplined--chewing\ngum, the kinds of things (laughing) my parents were totally not used to. So Noemi and I\nlanded up in a British school. A rather strict British school. And we had a few months of\ninstruction of English; and then, the fall of '42, started in school. Uh, we knew neither\nlanguage. We landed up learning English and Spanish simultaneously. We spoke German\nand French when we arrived. Uh, we didn't find it difficult, I must say. Kids learn very\nquickly, you know. It's a shame more people don't realize that. You learn...learning a\nlanguage 1s very easy when you're a child. Uh, the one thing we did rebel against is French\nlessons. My father thought that French is a beautiful language, and he didn't want us to forget\nit. And so he hired a strict, fat, ugly French teacher to come and give us French lessons.\nNow, I should back up as a little personal history. I grew up as a child not being able to stand\nugly people. That's not a very good trait, but uh I couldn't stand an ugly nurse when I was a\nbaby. I couldn't stand her to touch me. And this French teacher just turned me off. My sister\ndidn't want to learn French at all. We both screamed and stomped, \"We will never go back\nthere! Whoever wants to go back to that place?\" You know. Uh, my father persisted. And, of\ncourse, we've been back to France. So, anyway, we both learned. And Gerta, of course, was\nsingularly untalented for learning any languages. She barely learned Spanish. She eventually\nlearned English, and did go back to her brother in the United States. But not until I was 12\nand Noemi was 10. So she spent a good time of...portion of time with us in Cuba, always\nspeaking German to us. So we landed up speaking German and French, and German...I\nmean, and English and Spanish. We had a wonderful life in Cuba. My father became very\nsuccessful. My mother had help. Life was easy. We enjoyed the schools. Uh, Noemi and I\nwere...I was very, very reluctant to ever tell anyone that I was born in Berlin. I have not\nadmitted that to anyone until I started telling people about the...my story. The magazine.\nUntil then, everyone always thought that I was French. My friends from Havana\n(laughter)...40 years later, I hate to tell them now. They still think I was born in Paris. It was\nvery...it was something we didn't want to admit, about being German. Uh, even German-\nJewish. We just didn't want any part of anything that had the German. We didn't want to talk\nGerman, except with Gerta. And I never did enjoy talking German after that; but now I guess\nI do. Uh, I can also say that years later--even after I was married--and my husband went to\nGermany on business trips many times, and I refused to go with him for years. But that's just\nan aside. Uh, eventually... Yes?",
        "Q: At what point did you come to the United States?",
        "A: Uh, as soon as we got a visa. (Laughter) My father wanted us to come to the United States.\nHe did not want us to live in Cuba forever, uh because...for two reasons. He did not want us\nto marry Catholics, and he did not want us to lead the lives of the Cuban housewife--which\ninvariably meant staying at home while husbands had mistresses. And he realized that\nwas...did not correspond to his value system-- or my mother's, for that matter. So it was\nagain a matter of trying to get to the United States. After the war, of course, my parents\nbeing Latvian, they were...from citizens from behind the Iron Curtain. And it was very\ndifficult to get another Lat...American visa. But we did come... eventually get the visa. Uh,\nand we uh...got the immigration visa in 1948, which meant that we came to the United States\nand immigrated. But we went back to Cuba to live. You don't have to stay here as an\nimmigrant. I...You know, once you immigrate, you don't...that doesn't stop you from\ntravelling. So we went back to Cuba still for a year or so, then came back and eventually\nsettled here. Uh, my sister and I were both teenagers at the time. I spent only two years in\nhigh school in New York, and was very miserable. Uh, I was really not geared to be a New\nYork teenager. I wore pigtails and bobby socks, uh no make-up. I was really, uh as some of\nmy friends said, \"square.\" Uh, I was very unhappy in high school in New York. Big high\nschool. Uh, I came from a small private school in Cuba. I eventually found my niche in New\nYork when I went to college. I found I had very good scholastic background from the school.\nAs I said, I only spent two years in high school here. I was able to, you know, finish my\nlanguage study and I had good history background and I spoke English with a British accent-\n-which, by the way, landed me the privilege of landing up 1n a foreign accent speech class in\nthe New York City high school, to get rid of my foreign accent. And there I found myself\nwith all the Puerto Rican children, and we just had a wonderful time talking Spanish. In any\ncase, I went to Barnard College. Uh, my father preferred that I go to Barnard rather than to\nRadcliffe, so that I would still be in New York. He was still commuting to Cuba. His\nbusiness was still in Havana. He had met a friend of his who survived the Holocaust. A\nhigh...a childhood friend, who came out of the camp with the numbers and everything. And\nhe said to Charlie Salkin (ph), was his name, \"Charlie, why don't you go to Havana, run the\nfactory for me. And I will do the export and the business end of it from New York.\" And so\nthey did that. My father spent a lot of time commuting to Havana, which is why he had\nhoped that I would stay in New York for college. I didn't think I would like Barnard, but\nreally began to find my niche there and really enjoyed it. I majored in chemistry and did\ngraduate in biochemistry. Uh, my father's business eventually collapsed in Cuba. As you\nwell know, the events in Cuba led to Castro, eventually. And my poor father lost his business\nagain. And by that time, he was older. And his friends in New York, everyone, was very\nworried about how he was going to make it. My father was the eternal optimist. He always\nsaid, \"I have survived Hitler. I will survive Castro.\" And he did. He did. He came to New\nYork, and his business was taken from him. Charlie eventually immigrated to Miami\nhimself. And his business apparently was sold to Poland, and eventually collapsed because\nthey couldn't run it. They didn't have spare parts. So as far as we know, it's dead. Uh, I met\nmy husband in New York. Uh, my husband is born American. His name is Earl. He 1s a\nmathematician. He has a Ph.D. from Yale, and was an instructor at Columbia when I met\nhim. Uh, we were married in New York. My uh...we had children several years later. Our\nfirst daughter was born, Nina. Nina Chaya. We called ...named her after my paternal\ngrandmother, whose name was Chaya. And uh...two years later, in 19... Nina was born in\n1963, and Alexander Joseph was born in 1965. Alex was named after my mother's brother,\nJoseph, who had died shortly before he was born.",

        "A: My parents came to Berlin as students. They are not Germans. They are both from Latvia.\nUh...My mother is the seventh of eight children, and a family where Russian...they spoke\nRussian at home, and...uh....a little Yiddish. Two of my mother's elder brothers...one brother\nand sister went to Leningrad, and uh...uh my mother uh...went to Germany to study. She had\na magnificent voice. Uh, let me... My father was the youngest of six children. Uh, his father\nwas a businessman. They were of more ethnic German background in Latvia. Uh, my father\nwent to German schools in Latvia. My mother went to Russian schools. Uh, my parents\nalways spoke Russian to each. My mother's father was a painter and a cantor. And uh died\nwhen he...when she was very young. Uh, some of his paintings were so outstanding that uh...\nMy mother's house was always full of...my mother grew up in household full of paintings,\nand some of his paintings were so outstanding that she even was asked once to donate two of\nthe paintings to the Louvre, but... In Paris, later on. But uh naturally, she only had a few of\nthem and kept them with her. And she still has them. Uh, my parents met as teenagers,\nbecause uh...their older siblings (laughter) were married...got married. My mother's older\nsister got...was married to my father's older brother. Both my parents had magnificent voices.\nUh, my father was a baritone. My mother uh...went to Riga to study at the Conservatory. Uh,\nshe was known there as the girl with the golden voice. Uh, their home town was Liep_ja,\nwhich in Russian is Liyepaya [Ger: Libau]. I... They both when to Germany as poor students.\nMy father went first. He uh registered both in engineering school and at the Hochschule fir\nMusik, although he first started at the Hochschule fur Musik in Berlin. My mother followed\nlater. They were married in 1928 in Latvia, with both families present; and then they went\nback to study in Germany. Uh, one day my father sang...had the opportunity the audition for\nthe composer Mascagni, who urged him to go to Italy with his beautiful voice. But he had no\nmoney, and he was on full scholarship in Germany. And so Mascagni said, \"____ Italia.\" My\nfather felt he had...had no choice but stay in Germany. Uh, my mother finished the\nConservatory in Riga, and moved to Ber...to Berlin; and studied at the Conservatory there,\ntoo. Uh, shortly after they were married, my father got a job offer to sing at the Breslau [NB:\nWroclaw] Opera Company. He took a stage name, Yasha Lenssen. Uh, his real name is\nJacob...Jacob Levinsons. My mother is Pauline Levine. Uh, he was asked to sing the leading\nroles in 19 operas--the baritone roles. But soon after, they found out that uh his stage name,\nLenssen, really was Levinsons--which, of course, he was not about to hide anyway. Uh, they\ndecided to cancel his contract. This was in the early '30s in Germany. So my father, having\ncompleted some of his university studies at that time, decided to go into business in\nGermany. And his father helped him out by uh introducing him to someone who needed a\ncontact in Germany for a business. And so my father became a representative in Berlin for a\nbusiness firm abroad, and was quite successful at that. And they started uh...from being very\npoor students and living in very, very cramped one-room (laughing) without any money at\nall, both on scholarships, to being able to set themselves up in a little apartment in Berlin.\nMy father did quite well. Uh, I was born at that time--as I said, in 1934. And when I was\nabout uh 6 months old, my parents decided that I should have a photograph taken of me; and\nmy mother took me to a photographer. One of the best in Berlin! And he did...he made a\nvery beautiful picture--which my parents thought, at least, was a very beautiful picture--\nwhich my parents had framed and put on the piano that my father gave my mother as a\npresent when I was born. And there was this picture on the piano. One day, the lady who\ncame to clean...help my mother clean the apartment, Frau Klauke, said to my mother, \"You\nknow, I saw Hessy on a magazine cover in town.\" And my mother thought surely she must\nbe mistaken, that there are many babies that look alike, and just told her, \"Well, that couldn't\nbe [the] case.\" Uh, the lady insisted; and she says, \"No, no, no, no. It's definitely Hessy. It's\nthis picture. And...and just give me some money, and I'll get you the magazine.\" And so my\nmother did. And sure enough, this lady came back with a magazine, the front cover which\nsaid, \"Sonne ins Haus\"--which in German means, \"the Sun in the Home.\" And there was the\npicture on the piano reproduced on the front cover of this magazine. This magazine was\npublished out of Leipzig, and very definitely one of the few magazines allowed to circulate\nin Germany at the time, because it was a Nazi magazine. On the inside of the magazine were\npictures of the Army with men wearing swastikas. There's a picture of the Fuhrer himself\nreviewing the troops. There were pictures of the Hitlerjugend, and uh several of their\nactivities, both in marching and in campfires and all other activities. It was a family\nmagazine. My parents were horrified. They didn't know quite how this came about; except\nthat my mother, naturally, rushed over to the photographer. She said to him, \"What is this?\nHow did this happen?\" And the photographer quickly sort of closed the door, pulled the\nblinds, and told her to...very quietly admonished her to keep quiet. And he says, \"Sssh...I will\ntell you the following. I was asked to submit the...my ten best pictures for a beauty contest\nrun by the Nazis. So were ten other outstanding photographers in Germany. So ten\nphotographers submitted their ten best pictures. And I sent in your baby's picture.\" And my\nmother said, \"But you knew that this is a Jewish child.\" And the photographer said, \"Yes.\"\nAnd this is a quote that I have always... My parents say he said, in German, \"Ich wollte mir\nden Spass erlauben\"--\"I wanted to allow myself the pleasure of this joke.\" And then he told\nmy mother, \"And you see, I was right. Of all the babies, they picked this baby as the perfect\nAryan.\" There was a beauty competition to select a baby that would represent the perfect\nexample of the Aryan race to further the Nazi philosophy. That was pro...being promoted in\nGermany at the time. Magazine came out in early 1935. Uh, my parents were both shocked\nby the possible consequences that this could bring, and amazed at the irony of it all. But they\nfelt at the moment to keep...that 1t was best to keep it quiet. (Cough) Well, before...there\nwere several consequences that resulted from this. (Cough) (Drinking water) Uh, one, my\nparents noted right away that dress shops that advertised beauti...that had baby clothes, that\nwere selling baby clothes had put the picture in their store front windows. Uh, post cards\nwere reproduced made from that picture just for mailing. They were used...they were on\nevery newsstand in the country. They were post cards. One day, one of my mother's...my\nfather's sisters, Ida...my Tante Ida--who was living in Lithuania at the time--went into a store\nto buy me a birthday card for my first birthday. That was in May '35. And she picked up...she\nsaw that picture with a statement on the bottom \" \"--\"Best wishes to the Birthday\"--\nas a birthday card. And my Aunt Ida went to the cashier and said, \"Where did you get this\nphoto?\" She says, \"Oh, this is not just a picture. This is a real baby. It's a Berliner baby.\" And\nmy aunt didn't say another word, but she bought the postcard uh...which my parents brought\nwith them throughout the years. Uh, things were turning from bad to worse in Germany at\nthe time, as we all know. Uh, one of the things that happened is that my mother was\nsomewhat careful about taking me to the Tiergarten, and going with me places. She didn't\nwant people to recognize me...uh certainly when I started to talk, [to] say what my name\nwas. My Aunt Masha, my youngest...my mother's younger sister, came from Latvia at the\ntime of my birth and spent a lot of time with me then, too. And uh...she too is often very\ncareful about where she took me and where we went. Uh, my mother had one friend who...of\nthe family, Mrs. Grossman, who went to visit a friend of hers...uh in a small town in\nGermany. Uh, I don't remember the name of the town, but it was not anywhere near Berlin. I\nthink it was in the mountains somewhere. And this woman went to visit her friend, and\nfound my baby picture framed on the wall in her house. And Mrs. Grossman said, uh, \"My\nGosh! Where did you get this picture?\" She said, \"Oh, this was...I got this from the\nmagazine. Isn't that beautiful?\" And Mrs. Grossman said, \"But that is Hessy Levinsons.\"\nAnd the woman said, \"What! Levinsons, did you say?\" And she ripped the...her picture off\nfrom wall. Woman...and said, \"Levinsons!?\" And she was going to throw it away. And\nlooked at it again and said, \"No. This baby is too cute.\" And she hung it back on the wall.\nThose were just few of the incidences that happened at the time. Uh, my parents had uh been\nwarned before...even before I was born. They had consulted the Latvian Consulate about\nwhat to do, about how long to stay in Germany and so on. And the Latvian Consulate told\nthem, \"Don't worry. German Jews... I mean, you're not Germans. And as Latvians, you don't\nhave anything to worry about it. You'll... I let you know when it's time to leave. Don't... You\ndon't have to leave yet.\" And my parents... That's why my parents stayed for awhile. But uh\nmy sister was born at the end of 1936. And my father was set up doing fairly well, as I said.\nAt one point, he had a very bad experience, however. He was sitting in his office with an\naccountant. This accountant was a devoted member of the Nazi party, but he also got to like\nand respect my parents very much. He became very friendly with my parents. Hieronomus\n(ph) was his name. And in fact, one day, my...Hieronomous (ph) came to the house and\nasked my mother to help him sew on his swastika armband, because it was coming loose.\nFortunately, it was a Sabbath and my mother said to him, \"You know, as a Jew I am not\nallowed to sew on the Sabbath.\" So she got out of that one easily enough, cleverly enough, I\nthought. Uh, however, Hieronomus (ph) played a very important role in our lives. Uh, there\nwas one day when the Gestapo marched into my father's office and simply arrested him. It\nhad turned out that somebody had reported him, for some reason that remains obscure. One\nof the uh people with whom he was dealing apparently reported him. And my father was\ntaken away by the Gestapo, and Hieronomus (ph) did (chuckle) a classic movie type scene.\nHe got in his car and followed the car that my father was in. He was taken to some\nheadquarters. And within minutes, Hieronomus (ph) had followed, threw open the doors,\napparently screamed, \"Heil Hitler!\" He was immediately admitted to the room. And\nHieronomus (ph) vouched for my father as not being uh in any way associated with anything\nanti the Regime. My mother also had some experiences that were sort of unpleasant. One of\nthe neighbors in the house had uh reported her as having criticized Hitler once. She just...a\ncomment she had made on one of...photographs that Hitler made once. And the landlord of\nthe building vouched for my mother. [He] said, \"No, she could never have said anything\nunpleasant about our leader.\" And so there were people who helped them here and there. But\nthings got very, very tenuous. And so my father decided to move to Paris. And we moved to\nParis before the war. During this time, my parents were very close to their families. And we\nhad spent every summer in Latvia. Uh, in 1938, we had spent the summer in Latvia again.\nUh, that was the last time we went, because in the summer of '39 my father said, \"This year\nwe are not going.\" And probably if he hadn't made that decision, I wouldn't be here today. In\nany case, all those who were left behind were...died in the war. The only people who\nsurvived were one brothers of my mother's who came to America; some of my father's older\nbrothers and sisters who had come here also when he was a child, long before the war; my\nAunt Masha, who was with us in Germany, who went to England; and my aunt and uncle\nwho had moved to Leningrad. Everyone else landed up being victims of the Holocaust.\nMy...L...1...1 should say... Let me back up a little. My two grandfathers had died before the\nwar. My mother's father died when she was a child--the painter. Uh, my father's father died\nshortly before I was born, and I was named after him. His name was Hessel (ph). Uh, we\nmoved to Paris, and life there was both interesting and difficult. Interesting, because my\nparents enjoyed the cultural life and excitement that the city has to offer; but difficult,\nbecause of the times, of course, and the difficulty of getting settled. My father was amazingly\ningenious, and was able to set up business and start working again. Uh, after Paris fell, I\nbecame very conscious...I was told, \"Don't speak German on the streets.\" And my sister and\nI were very conscious of the fact that we... somehow it was bad to speak German, and we...it\nwas very difficult for us, who grew up speaking... At that time we spoke German and French.\nBut uh I remember one time we were befriended by some German soldiers, and they gave us\nchocolates. And we started talking to them, until we realized that we had been told not to do\nthat and then ran away, very quickly. (Chuckle) Anyway, uh we were in France\naltogether...uh we were in Paris when France fell, and...or became occupied. And at one\npoint, the concierge of my parents\u2019 building--which was tn the very elegant area of the 16th\narrondissement in France, in Paris--uh told...warned us that Germans were coming and\nrounding up Jews, and suggested that we not go back to the apartment right away. My father\nthen arranged for my mother and my sister and I uh to uh go to [Mimac (ph)]-sur-Mer. My\nsister 18 called Noemi. So Noemi, my mother and I moved to [Mimac (ph)]-sur-Mer, which\nis in...on the coast, on the Atlantic Coast of France--not far from Bordeaux. My father stayed\nin Paris trying to arrange ways to leave. He um...my mother had a rather difficult time in\n[Mimac (ph)]|-sur-Mer. Uh, the...she was conscious of being the only Jew in this so-called\nresort hotel where we...my father had arranged for us to stay. I remember distinctly there was\none Frenchman who was rather aloof and cold and severe looking. But he had a big dog that\nNoemi and I loved to play with, and we played with him quite a bit. Well, one day the\nlandlady of the resort told my mother that she would have to leave. That she was under too\nmuch pressure, and that she could not keep us anymore. So my mother went to the Chief of\nPolice of the town, and he was very cooperative. He said to her, \"I believe that there are\npeople in this town who are not acting in the best interest for France. I will see what I can do\nin your behalf.\" So my mother felt reassured. Shortly thereafter, the man with the dog\ndisappeared. It turned out that he was spying for the Germans; and the Chief of Police was\nonly too glad to have been able to accumulate enough evidence that I guess he had from\nother sources to arrest him. Nevertheless, my mother's life got to be more and more\ncomplicated and trying. And soon enough, shortly thereafter the concierge came and told my\nmother the same story again. But this time, there was no question that she would have to\nleave by the next day. My mother tried her friend, the Chief of Police, again. And he told\nher, \"Madame Levinsons, I have done everything I can for you.\" He could handle French,\nbut right now the Germans were down his back and now he couldn't do anything further for\nher. So that night, my mother tells me that she resorted to all praying and pleading for\nhelp...dlong sigh)...at guidance for her family from the Lord for some way of trying to see\nwhat she could do so she would not get separated from her husband because that's how\nfamilies got separated during the war, and she knew that if she had to leave, he would never\nfind us again. And while she was up that whole night, pacing the whole night, around 4\no'clock in the morning there was a knock on the door, and the concierge was knocking said,\n\"Madame Levinsons! Madame Levinsons! Votre mari est arriv\u00e9.\"--\"Your husband is here.\"\nIt was the most joyous moment my mother could imagine at the time. We packed up the car,\nand the four of us drove away and we drove to meet a group. And my own memory 1s rather\nvague of that at the time. But we joined up with a group that was going to take us across\noccupied territory to the Zone Libre [NB: \"Free Zone\"], which Nice was still in the Zone\nLibre at the time. We met some other people from Paris also, some other friends of ours.\nAnd...in this group; and we apparently at one point, we went by truck to a certain point, and\nthen we had to go across the woods, walking through swamp that...and be very, very quiet--\nbecause apparently a German encampment was behind the woods. At the end of that road, at\nthe end of those...there would be another truck to meet us. Uh, I did not know those details at\nthe time. (Chuckle) What knew is that this very ominous looking Frenchman, who had this\nenormous knife around his belt, took it out and told the children that any kid who opened his\nmouth would have his tongue cut out. Let me tell you, I have never forgotten that moment.\n(Chuckle) I went with my lips sealed like this throughout the entire escapade. Except that, at\none point, I couldn't contain myself and I asked my father's friend--who held me by the hand-\n-I said, \"What are we doing?\" He said, \"This is a sport. We're running. This is a sport.\" And I\nsaid, \"I hate this sport.\" And then I saw this guy with a knife, and I contained myself. The\nbabies, the children--including my sister Noemi--were all fed chocolates. They got all the\nchocolates one could round up during the war to keep these kids quiet. We got to the Zone\nLibre, and immediately my father applied for American immigration. Uh, I think, 1n fact, 1f--\nalthough my memory is not quite sure about this at the time--I think, in fact, that my father\nhad applied for it while he was still in Paris, and had been granted it at that point when we\narrived in Nice. But when you get an American immigration visa--which is hard to get,\nbecause you need to prove that you can sustain yourself and, you know, you're not going to\nland up being on welfare or burden to anyone in this country, uh ...and that you are good\nhealth and so. But even after all this, you are told that you have 90 days to reach American\nshores. And my father realized, as time was going by, that there was no way in which he\ncould get his family to the U.S. within the time timeframe left. Thirty days before the visa\nexpired, he requested an extension from Washington. The Atlantic...you know, across the\nAtlantic, there were no commercial flights at the time. Uh, this was in 1941. Uh, the ocean\nwas patrolled. Submarines...uh... Anyway, we waited for a reply from Washington. And [it]\neventually came, and it said, \"No.\" They denied us an extension. So, again, (sigh) I guess I\ncould say it's not thanks to Uncle Sam that I am sitting here today. My father tried every\navenue available to him. He went to a series of Latin American consulates in France, and\nuh...1n Nice; and eventually landed up with a Cuban Consulate who would listen to him, also\naccept some money, and granted him visas to Cuba. Uh, we spent a relatively...my sister and\nI have relatively nice memories of Nice. Uh, it was...it was not much food. My parents never\nwanted to touch ratatouille again, because that's the only thing they ate for 8 months.\n(Chuckle) Uh, we didn't go to school, of course. We did try to lead some kind of normal\nsemblance of life. I remember it was that time when I learned swimming. I learned to swim,\nhad some swimming lessons. Somehow tried to lead a fairly normal life. The one very\nimportant person joined us at that time who had been left behind at Paris for a while, and that\nis our nurse, uh Gerta. Gerta was a German-Jewish nurse who came to take care of me when\nmy sister was born. In other words, my mother hired her in Berlin. Uh, I was extremely\nspoiled at the time. (Laughing) I'm back tracking a bit. Gerta had a terrible time with me.\n(Laughter) Maybe partly because of all the fuss that was made about me. But anyway, she\nvowed that the next baby's not going to be so spoiled. Gerta was extremely attached to\nNoemi. To me, too, I think, eventually. In any case, my parents were very devoted to her;\nand we both grew up feeling very close to her, uh and Gerta was with us in Nice. My\nfather...uh eventually got us a visa to Cuba, and was told that Gerta would get the visa\neventually, too, to the United States, because she had a brother in the United States. So we\nleft, and went to Marseilles. In Marseilles, we waited for a ship to take us to Cuba. It's funny,\nyou know. When I think back, my mother says she was wonderful...very good student in\nschool except in geography. And geography was her worst subject. She didn't even know\nwhere Cuba was on the map before she found out about us, and here we were going to go to\nCuba. But, in any case, uh the uh one interesting thing happened before we left. My father\nheard that Gerta was not going to get the visa to the United States, and that she was left\nbehind. And he was going to try to get her out. But by that time, there was a German line of\ncontrol and you had to have special passes to go from Nice to Marseilles-- which we had, but\nmy father did not have a pass to go back and get her. And he really wanted to go back and\nget Gerta out. So he thought he's going to try it anyway. He boarded a train in Marseilles\nwithout a pass. He had a ticket, but that wasn't the issue. And he got himself...he got on the\ntrain, and then he thought of a very clever way to foil the French. When he got to the border-\n-the \"border\" in the sense of the occupied zone--and, of course, at that time the Petain regime\nwas cooperating with the Germans. Although they were all French patrolling, they were all\ncooperating with the Germans. And he thought [to] himself, \"There is only one way to foil\nthe French. What 1s it that is holy to the French? Dining and eating 1s holy to the French.\" So\nhe went to the dining car, and started eating and eating and eating and drinking and wined.\nAnd they sat at that border for hours, and he kept on eating non-stop. He wasn't do diddling\nor daddling. He was eating. And he ate for several hours, and nobody touched him. And he\nmade it to Nice. And when he made it to Nice, he had a gold cigarette case that he went to\npawn to get some money. And he got that money, and was able to help Gerta in case she\nneeded passage. And then he went back to the Cuban Consulate and said he needs another\nvisa. And the Consulate denied. He says, \"Impossible! Impossible! I am already in hot water\nfor having given you all this. Impossible! I have given away too many. I cannot give another\nperson.\" My father was not dis...easily to be dissuaded; and he persisted and persisted, and,\nof course, they got nowhere for awhile. And finally the Cuban Consulate said, \"You know,\nthere is an old law on the books that when you're given your visa, you can take all your\npossessions with you. Now, the old law says that slaves are a possession of the owner.\nWould you say that this lady is...woman is your slave?\" And my father quickly said, \"Yes.\nShe is my slave and my possession, and she needs to come with me.\" And on that basis,\nGerta got the grant...visa to come to Cuba. But she did not have a pass to get back to\nMarseilles, and that was too dangerous. He somehow arranged for her to get to Casablanca.\nAll of this was extremely complicated and extremely difficult to do. My father was really\nvery ingenious. Uh, and somehow, again, he got himself back to Marseilles through the line.\nApparently, on the way back there was not such a long border stop. But the big crisis was on\none way. He had...he did have his visa to Cuba on...to show that he could get out. So on the\nway back, it wasn't quite as difficult for him as rationale for going into Nice. We sailed on a\nPortugese ship, the _(ph), from Marseilles in the beginning of 1942. Uh, I remember\nstopping in Casablanca to an impression I will never forget. The dazzling sun, the enormous\namount of sand, women were all veiled, long robes for men. I thought this was some\nstorybook. I had no idea what was happening and where we were. I was absolutely stunned\nat this image. Uh, we were not...we did not get off the boat. But in Casablanca, Gerta got on.\nAnd that was a very emotional reunion. Then we proceeded across the Atlantic with a ship\nfull of refugees. My dear father provided for his family. We had a first class cabin all to\nourselves. Before leaving Europe, my...one of the things my father had arranged for, while\nhe was still in Paris, is to have all our furniture stored someplace safely in Europe. And so he\nhad it stored in Portugal. And the reason was not so much the furniture--although it was quite\nelegant Queen Anne furniture which my parent...father had set up this very lovely apartment\non the Rue de Messine in Paris when we had lived there. But the thing that was critical in\nthat...in...in...1n that box that the furniture [was in] were my grandfather's paintings. There\nwere three of them...three paintings in there, which my father managed to store in Portugal,\nand which we recuperated after the war and after we came to the United States. The three\npaintings are, one, a self portrait of my grandfather, who looks like Toulouse-Lautrec--big\nblack hat, big fur coat, very distinguished looking. A picture...painting of his father-in-law, [\n_(ph)], in the morning. The light shining on him looks like that picture would come alive. I\nthink that was the one that they wanted for the Museum. And a third picture, of a painting of\na poor man who used to not always have enough food that my grandmother used to offer a\ncup of tea. She'd offer him some borscht or some tea, and would feed him. And so that's the\nportrait, the third painting that we have. My Aunt Masha brought two other paintings too.\nUh, one is a magnificent...uh...paysage [Fr: \"landscape\" ]--a scene of trees, the Berioshkas in\nsnow. And another is uh a scene of a...one of their brothers studying for Bar Mitzvah. So\nthose are the five paintings that we now have in New York. Anyway, we went on to Cuba.\nThe boat...it took 3 and a half weeks to cross the Atlantic through a very circuitous route--to\nthe very south, because we needed to avoid the war zones. Uh, we went far south, I believe,\nto cross and landed up first in Jamaica, which was again a very interesting uh sight for me.\nThe...the trees, the climate, the people carrying baskets on their heads. I remember little\nthings like that. Anyway, we went on to Cuba. This entire ship full of refugees, the entire\nhull of the ship, the basement people sleeping on the floor, all these people... (Sigh) We got\noff on Cuba and were put in a camp. It was called Camp Tiscornia. Uh, they didn't quite\nknow what to do with us either. (Laughter) Which I guess was true of all the refugees, all\nfrom Europe and all different...many places. And we spent several weeks in Tiscornia,\nduring which time my father figured how 1s he going to get started. He had pawned most of\nwhat he had in Europe to pay for visas and passage and boat; and we had just some, you\nknow, few suitcases of personal possessions with us. He started to go to several banks in\nCuba and asked for a loan to help him get started for a business. Uh, he had a lot of courage.\nHe just walked into many of the banks, mostly American banks that were uh...had had, you\nknow, large branches in Cuba. And (Laughter) they all asked, \"What do you have for\ncollateral?\" \"Myself. I am an honest man, and offer you me as collateral.\" And, as you can\nimagine, a bank doesn't deal with this kind of business. And they all laughed at him. Until,\none day, he walked into the Royal Bank of Canada. And the Canadian uh officials at the\nbank looked at him and said, \"You know what? We think we're going to give you a chance.\nWe'll take our luck with you.\" And so they helped my father get started. He started first with\nuh some working in pin...with pineapple business, which was a wonderful product of Cuba,\nbut realized that soon enough that wasn't going to be good for export to the United States\nbecause of competition from Hawaii. So he, by that time, got very clever about realizing that\nthe Cubans had good cattle and were throwing away all kinds of meat casings and so on.\nThings that were...from the slaughter houses, things that were in ample use in Chicago. Uh,\nand he decided to set up a factory, the first factory...such factory in Cuba. Uh, we lived a\nvery good life in Havana. We learned Spanish. Uh, we learned English, because my parents\nthought that we should go to a...someday we might still come to the United States. So they\nwanted to send us to a English-speaking school. My parents were shocked at the American\nschool in Havana. Uh, the American kids seemed to them totally undisciplined--chewing\ngum, the kinds of things (laughing) my parents were totally not used to. So Noemi and I\nlanded up in a British school. A rather strict British school. And we had a few months of\ninstruction of English; and then, the fall of '42, started in school. Uh, we knew neither\nlanguage. We landed up learning English and Spanish simultaneously. We spoke German\nand French when we arrived. Uh, we didn't find it difficult, I must say. Kids learn very\nquickly, you know. It's a shame more people don't realize that. You learn...learning a\nlanguage 1s very easy when you're a child. Uh, the one thing we did rebel against is French\nlessons. My father thought that French is a beautiful language, and he didn't want us to forget\nit. And so he hired a strict, fat, ugly French teacher to come and give us French lessons.\nNow, I should back up as a little personal history. I grew up as a child not being able to stand\nugly people. That's not a very good trait, but uh I couldn't stand an ugly nurse when I was a\nbaby. I couldn't stand her to touch me. And this French teacher just turned me off. My sister\ndidn't want to learn French at all. We both screamed and stomped, \"We will never go back\nthere! Whoever wants to go back to that place?\" You know. Uh, my father persisted. And, of\ncourse, we've been back to France. So, anyway, we both learned. And Gerta, of course, was\nsingularly untalented for learning any languages. She barely learned Spanish. She eventually\nlearned English, and did go back to her brother in the United States. But not until I was 12\nand Noemi was 10. So she spent a good time of...portion of time with us in Cuba, always\nspeaking German to us. So we landed up speaking German and French, and German...I\nmean, and English and Spanish. We had a wonderful life in Cuba. My father became very\nsuccessful. My mother had help. Life was easy. We enjoyed the schools. Uh, Noemi and I\nwere...I was very, very reluctant to ever tell anyone that I was born in Berlin. I have not\nadmitted that to anyone until I started telling people about the...my story. The magazine.\nUntil then, everyone always thought that I was French. My friends from Havana\n(laughter)...40 years later, I hate to tell them now. They still think I was born in Paris. It was\nvery...it was something we didn't want to admit, about being German. Uh, even German-\nJewish. We just didn't want any part of anything that had the German. We didn't want to talk\nGerman, except with Gerta. And I never did enjoy talking German after that; but now I guess\nI do. Uh, I can also say that years later--even after I was married--and my husband went to\nGermany on business trips many times, and I refused to go with him for years. But that's just\nan aside. Uh, eventually... Yes?",
        "A: Uh, as soon as we got a visa. (Laughter) My father wanted us to come to the United States.\nHe did not want us to live in Cuba forever, uh because...for two reasons. He did not want us\nto marry Catholics, and he did not want us to lead the lives of the Cuban housewife--which\ninvariably meant staying at home while husbands had mistresses. And he realized that\nwas...did not correspond to his value system-- or my mother's, for that matter. So it was\nagain a matter of trying to get to the United States. After the war, of course, my parents\nbeing Latvian, they were...from citizens from behind the Iron Curtain. And it was very\ndifficult to get another Lat...American visa. But we did come... eventually get the visa. Uh,\nand we uh...got the immigration visa in 1948, which meant that we came to the United States\nand immigrated. But we went back to Cuba to live. You don't have to stay here as an\nimmigrant. I...You know, once you immigrate, you don't...that doesn't stop you from\ntravelling. So we went back to Cuba still for a year or so, then came back and eventually\nsettled here. Uh, my sister and I were both teenagers at the time. I spent only two years in\nhigh school in New York, and was very miserable. Uh, I was really not geared to be a New\nYork teenager. I wore pigtails and bobby socks, uh no make-up. I was really, uh as some of\nmy friends said, \"square.\" Uh, I was very unhappy in high school in New York. Big high\nschool. Uh, I came from a small private school in Cuba. I eventually found my niche in New\nYork when I went to college. I found I had very good scholastic background from the school.\nAs I said, I only spent two years in high school here. I was able to, you know, finish my\nlanguage study and I had good history background and I spoke English with a British accent-\n-which, by the way, landed me the privilege of landing up 1n a foreign accent speech class in\nthe New York City high school, to get rid of my foreign accent. And there I found myself\nwith all the Puerto Rican children, and we just had a wonderful time talking Spanish. In any\ncase, I went to Barnard College. Uh, my father preferred that I go to Barnard rather than to\nRadcliffe, so that I would still be in New York. He was still commuting to Cuba. His\nbusiness was still in Havana. He had met a friend of his who survived the Holocaust. A\nhigh...a childhood friend, who came out of the camp with the numbers and everything. And\nhe said to Charlie Salkin (ph), was his name, \"Charlie, why don't you go to Havana, run the\nfactory for me. And I will do the export and the business end of it from New York.\" And so\nthey did that. My father spent a lot of time commuting to Havana, which is why he had\nhoped that I would stay in New York for college. I didn't think I would like Barnard, but\nreally began to find my niche there and really enjoyed it. I majored in chemistry and did\ngraduate in biochemistry. Uh, my father's business eventually collapsed in Cuba. As you\nwell know, the events in Cuba led to Castro, eventually. And my poor father lost his business\nagain. And by that time, he was older. And his friends in New York, everyone, was very\nworried about how he was going to make it. My father was the eternal optimist. He always\nsaid, \"I have survived Hitler. I will survive Castro.\" And he did. He did. He came to New\nYork, and his business was taken from him. Charlie eventually immigrated to Miami\nhimself. And his business apparently was sold to Poland, and eventually collapsed because\nthey couldn't run it. They didn't have spare parts. So as far as we know, it's dead. Uh, I met\nmy husband in New York. Uh, my husband is born American. His name is Earl. He 1s a\nmathematician. He has a Ph.D. from Yale, and was an instructor at Columbia when I met\nhim. Uh, we were married in New York. My uh...we had children several years later. Our\nfirst daughter was born, Nina. Nina Chaya. We called ...named her after my paternal\ngrandmother, whose name was Chaya. And uh...two years later, in 19... Nina was born in\n1963, and Alexander Joseph was born in 1965. Alex was named after my mother's brother,\nJoseph, who had died shortly before he was born.\n"
