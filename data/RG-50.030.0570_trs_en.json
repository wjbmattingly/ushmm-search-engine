He had foresight, if\nnot luck, and he was able to send ma \u2014 send my sister and brother out with a guy, to\ntake them out of the ghetto and just take them away. I think there might have been a\ndestination, but I d\u2014 I don\u2019t recall. It had \u2014 there had to be. And \u2014 and my father\npaid for the guy to take my sister and brother out.",

I definitely \u2014 as a matter of fact, my brother called me this afternoon and I\ndidn't get a chance to talk to him. And he would be the one to know, my brother\nknows everything. He remembered the streets, and the shops and everything that\nwent on in Krakow. He knew hundreds of people, and he knew the whole family.\nHe would \u2014 he was interviewed, I think by spe \u2014 Spielberg. I don\u2019t know if he was\ninterviewed by the \u2014 was he interviewed by the Holocaust, do you know \u2014 oh. He \u2014\nhe would make a great interview.

And then I have another\ncousin who lives in Chicago, and she was sent with the you \u2014 youth \u2014 youth\norganization to the States, cause we did have family in the States, so she was able\nto come on one of the first immigration trips.",

They stayed\nwith us, and when the \u2014 when it got to be very, very dangerous, my father again sent\nthem out. Where to, I don\u2019t know. And at that time, my father had Czech papers, so\nhe was fairly safe, and we were able to get \u2014 once the ghetto was being liquidated,\nwe were able to cross over to Czechoslovakia.",
        "Q: Do you have any memory of how you escaped from the ghetto?",
        "A: Very carefully. And \u2014",
        "Q: Was it night, or is it day?",
        "A: I believe it was at night, and we crossed the border. And I have a very, very\nvague story. That\u2019s one of my rarest little memories, but again, it might have been\ntold to me as well.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: We were crossing the \u2014 a border and of course it was guarded, but my \u2014 my\nfather had the papers, and we were stopped. And they asked us all sorts of\nquestions, and I was three or four years old. And they were talking to me, and I said\n\u2014I was whimpering. And I said, my father is a goy, my mother 1s goy, but I\u2019m\nJewish. And I was three, four years old, and they let us through. I \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: And when you got to Czechoslovakia, where did you go?",
        "A: We stayed \u2014 we stayed in Czechoslovakia for a little while. I don\u2019t recall that at\nall. But soon after, we were able to get to Hungary, to Miskolc, Hungary. Well,\nfirst to Budapest. And from Budapest we went to Miskolc. I don\u2019t remember\nBudapest, but I do remember Miskole. We lived there as Gentiles for about a year.",
        "Q: And at this time, did you have any knowledge that your brother and sister had\nsurvived? Had you had any contact with them?",
        "A: Okay, in between that, there \u2014 they were sent to an orphanage. And my father\nheard, or \u2014 or somebody had heard that things were really happening. Whether my\nfather knew where they were, or they were supposed to, but he didn\u2019t know whether\nthey were alive, but if they were, this is where they would \u2014 would have been. He\nsent a guide out there, and that was the day they were liquidating the orphanage.\nAnd \u2014",
        "Q: And this is in Miskole, or \u2014",
        "A: Lam not sure whether it was in Czechoslovakia, or whether it was in Hungary.\nI\u2019m not sure. And the gar \u2014 the guide knew who they were, and he went \u2014 first it\nwas my brother, and he said, follow me. Don\u2019t talk, don\u2019t say anything, just follow\nme. And as they walked out, they \u2014 the Nazis came in and took the other children.\nAnd I think \u2014 I believe the same thing happened to Henya(ph), my sister Helen,\nand they were able to walk out of the orphanage, and they brought them to my\nparents.",
        "Q: Do you remember the reunion?",
        "A: No, I do not. You know, a lot of things seems to be repre \u2014 repressed in my\nmind, and I get so upset with myself, so irritated that I cannot have those memories.\nI would do anything to \u2014 to really know how I felt, how my parents felt, or \u2014 you\nknow \u2014",
        "Q: So then \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the rest of them. So, we lived in Miskole for about a year as Gentiles.",
        "Q: All five of you?",
        "A: Five of us, five of us. And as I said, we lived \u2014 lived as gent \u2014 we had a house,\nand in the house we had a cross, because we lived as \u2014 as Gentiles. And I remember\nbeing in the basement of the house, or \u2014 we went out to a shelter in a cave or\nsomewhere, and \u2014 and the Russians came in and they bombed the whole town, or\nthe area where we lived. The only house standing was ours. The cross came down,\nsmacked in smithereens, and the house was standing. There was a crack though, but\nthat was the only house standing 1n our neighborhood. So, to me that was absolutely\nmiraculous.",
        "Q: And then did you remain in the town after the bombing?",
        "A: We stayed \u2014 we stayed there for awhile. Well, we \u2014 during the bombing, my \u2014\nmy \u2014 my mother sent my brother out to get bread, there was a tremendous bread\nline. And he would bring home rotten bread, or whatever kind of bread we could\nget, and the bombs were falling, and you know. And my mother would prepare this\nbread in rancin \u2014 rancid oil that we kept so we could, you know, fry the bread. And\nthe only food we had was garlic. So we would have this rotten bread and rancid oil\nwith \u2014 spread with garlic. And you know Judy, it was the most delicious thing in\nthe world. But, soon after that, when the war \u2014 we were liberated by the Russians.\nAnd soon after that, I guess it was early part of 1946, I think it was the year \u2014 I\u2019m\nnot sure what part of the year it was, but my brother and my father decided they\nwould go back to Poland. We remained in \u2014 in Hungary. I don\u2019t remember that.\nBut my brother and father went, and he came back with stories that were just\nincredible. That was the time of the pogroms. Soon after the war, when Jews were\ncoming back to Poland, and my father and brother went to see our house, and they\nknocked on the door, and some Polish people were living there, and they slammed\nthe door in his face, saying, you were supposed to be dead. So at that \u2014 right after\nthat, this pogrom had started, and they escaped by this much from getting killed.\nThey survived the war, but they were so scared that they would \u2014 yeah. So, we went\nback \u2014 they went back to Hungary and my father told my mother, there\u2019s nothing\nthere for us.",
        "Q: So-",
        "A: And at that time my father, he survived the whole war without being arrested,\nbut at that time he was arrested by the Russians. Because my father was bootlegging\nat that time, and the Russian soldiers got sick from \u2014 from this drink, and they\narrested my father for selling bad liquor to the Russians.",
        "Q: How long was he in jail for?",
        "A: Not \u2014 not terribly long, not terribly long. But, he had to make a living, right?",
        "Q: So, how long did you remain in Hungary after the war?",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we left soon after that, because I know we were in Gabersee, a DP\ncamp in Germany for three years. So, we left that in 1949. Excuse me. So we must\nhave left Hungary in \u00b046.",
        "Q: And did you have any trouble getting out of Hungary?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall that at all, I think we were just \u2014 you know, we made arrangements\nand we were placed in a DP camp. And we were there for three years, and even\nthough we had family here in the States, it was \u2014 I\u2019m sure, you know, it took\nforever to get the papers, and \u2014",
        "Q: What was life like in the DP camp?",
        "A: From what I remember as a child, it was okay. I had friends, I had schooling, I\nhad food. I was a little bit of nothing, and so that was life, and it was good.",
        "Q: And di \u2014 and did your parents have enough to do in the DP camp?",
        "A: Well, my fath \u2014 ma \u2014 my father worked, my mother stayed at home, and I\nremember at that time my sister and brother wanted to make Aliyah to Israel. And\noh, they cried to go to Israel. But, you know, they were good kids, it was all family,\nyou know, and my mother said, absolutely not. She was tired of fighting, she was\ntired of being scared, and she wants peace in her life and she didn't want her\nchildren going to Israel and fighting another war. So, that\u2019s how they remained\nwith us, you know, that we stayed as a family unit. So we came to the States in\n1949.",
        "Q: Did anyone sponsor you?",
        "A: Well, we had the family. We had my aunt and unc \u2014 two aunts and an uncle ra \u2014\noh, no, we ha \u2014 that time we still had quite a bit of family left. We were a huge\nfamily. My father had a brother, two sisters. One sister with a husband, and an uncle\nwho I \u2014I hate to mention, that wer \u2014 that were in New York. And we had other\nrelatives th-through the States. So we stayed with them for awhile til we \u2014 til we\nsettled. But we arrived in New York harbor on a Shabbat, and cousins came to pick\nus up. My father would not get off the ship. He would not \u2014 it\u2019s Shabbat, he is not\ngoing in a car, he\u2019s not \u2014 you know. So here after \u2014 after 10 years of suffering, he\nwould not get off the ship. So my cousins left, and they came back a little bit later\nand they said, if you don\u2019t get off the boat now, we\u2019re not coming back and get you.\nSo finally he\u2019s \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he was \u2014 he was the sweetest man \u2014 so finally he\nconsented to get off the ship and we came to my aunt\u2019s house, Tante Eda(ph). And\nit was the beginning of a new life. But he \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 his faith was so very strong.",
        "Q: And he stayed a \u2014 a Hassid?",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And what about your siblings? Did their faith change at all through the war?",
        "A: Somewhat. Their children are \u2014 are very religious, all of their children. My sister\nand brother-in-law are very \u2014 yeah, but they\u2019re not Hassidic or any \u2014 and that\u2019s a \u2014\nneither 1s my brother, but their children are very, very [indecipherable]. And\nwonderful, beautiful family, yeah.",
        "Q: Where in New York did you settle?",
        "A: In Brooklyn. Bensonhurst, yeah.",
        "Q: And talk about th \u2014 what was it like as a young child all of a sudden moving to a\nnew country with a new language? Did you have any trouble adjusting to life in the\nUnited States?",
        "A: I was scared of a new language because I was able to pick 1t up no matter where\nwe were I spoke hungar \u2014 not that I know it now. But I spoke German and\nHungarian and Polish and you know, a little \u2014 a bissell(ph) here and a bissell(ph)\nthere. But when I came to America, I said, oh I\u2019m \u2014I\u2014 I don\u2019t know if I can learn\nthe language, I was really scared. And my cousin insisted that I only speak English\nin front of him, or wherever I was going. And then I forgot all the other languages. I\njust never retained it. But my parents took English when we were in Gabersee in\nthe DP camp, and they had a tutor come to the house. We had a one room place,\nand he would come to the house and teach my parents English, but it was English\nEnglish, so 1t was somewhat different than when we came to the States. But it never\nhelped, they wer \u2014 they managed with \u2014 with whatever they could speak. But one\nthing about my father, may he rest in peace, and God love him a million years, we\ncame on a Shabbat, on a sa \u2014 Monday he already had a job.",
        "Q: Was he able to work 1n his own field, shoemaker?",
        "A: Shoemaker, mm-hm, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And what was the reception of the other children at school to the fact that you\nwere a newcomer from another country? Did they accept you immediately, or \u2014",
        "A: Ah, I never looked for it. I know \u2014 I had a small group of friends, but I didn\u2019t\nhave an extended group, so I ne \u2014 I never really looked into that. And I remember\nbeing in one class, where the teacher called upon me and asked for me to speak in\nfront of the class, and I really couldn\u2019t because I was so foreign, it was so unrelated\nto the classroom atmosphere. I was very difficult, I \u2014 I \u2014 ve always told bits and\npieces, but I never \u2014 yeah. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m even helping you with this interview.",
        "Q: Right, yeah. Oh, very much. And your family, once they came to the United\nStates, did they ever talk about the war years, or did they just put it behind them?",
        "A: Not for awhile, not for awhile. Maybe they talked to their family privately, like\nto their sister \u2014 their sisters. My mother did not have family here \u2014 she had a cousin,\nI take that back. She had a \u2014 a\u2014a\u2014a very Hassidic cousin and an extended family.\nShe did have a brother in Israel that settled there in 1933, but here in the States, it\nwas mostly my father\u2019s family. So, I\u2019m sure they talked among themselves, but not\nreally openly, not til later on. Not til later on.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] different question. At which point do you start to identify \u2014 did\nit strike you that you were a Holocaust survivor and not just an immigrant?",
        "A: Oh my God, it took years.",
        "Q: Why was that?",
        "A: It\u2014 PI tell you exactly. Oh, I \u2014 it took years, and I know exactly when I realized\nthat. A number of years ago, there as a Holocaust renu \u2014 reunion here in\nWashington at the convention center. You must have been a baby then. I forget\nwhat year it was. I'll tell you later. \u00b069, or maybe seven \u2014 well, when a \u2014 and I tried\nto get involved with that, I begged my husband to get involved with that. And we\nsang \u2014 we went to the \u2014 President Reagan spoke then \u2014 no, so it must have been\nmuch later, was in the 80s. Okay, early 80s. And President Reagan spoke in front\nof the Holocaust reunion group. And I signed up for a few seminars at the\nconvention center in D.C. And I attended the second generation seminar. I don\u2019t\nknow what made me do that, but they spoke on children surviving, and families\nsurviving. And I finally realized \u2014 the reason I wanted to get involved in this thing\nwas because I just felt 1t. But what I realized at that time, and realized that I am a\nsurvivor, was that families of my \u2014 of my generation, did not survive. I realized I\nwas very unique and very rare, because children my age did not survive. And \u2014 and\nmy siblings as well, my sister and brother, who were sent out to God knows where.\nAnd how they reunited with their parents, and how my father survived all that. We\nwere very unique, and I cherish that in my \u2014 in my head, I \u2014 I could not believe that\nas a family unit we survived, you know? So that\u2019s when I realized I\u2019m a Holocaust\nsurvivor. We were in no camp. We were in no labor camp, but I think we survived\nmany \u2014",
        "Q: And do you think that affected the choices you made later in life, that\nrealization?",
        "A: That I-I realized I\u2019m a Holocaust survivor?",
        "Q: Or, having gone through the Holocaust.",
        "A: Selfishly, I feel like I\u2019m a very special person. But my everyday life is, I\u2019m just\nas normal as you or anybody else. But when I look back on it, I feel very special. I\nwish my husband would feel that way. He\u2019s the silent one. He does not discuss it.\nSo it makes our feelings very, very difficult. And things that I would get more\ninvolved in, that I would like to get more involved in, I feel like I can\u2019t because I\u2019m\nnot getting his support. And he wouldn\u2019t \u2014 he won\u2019t accept my support. He lost his\nentire family, so he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014 he keeps everything inside. And it \u2014 I think he did a\nlot of damage to our children because he wasn\u2019t open with them. But they always\npursue, they always ask questions. But I find that a very, very difficult part of my\nlife, yeah. My brother-in-law, he was liberated in Auschwitz, and for many, many,\nmany years he would not speak of it. Like, I think it was a normal thing of many\nsurvivors at that time. But a few years ago, all of a sudden, everything came out.\nEverything came out. And he had a tremendous 1-interview with Spielberg and the\n\u2014 I believe the Holocaust Museum as well, an extended one. He made several\ndonations to the museum. I think one of his shirts is hanging there. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s\ndifferent than the others. I\u2019m sure you have enough of them there. So, sometimes I\nenvy people who can really speak out and be noticed for what they went through,\nwhere my husband is \u2014 yeah, I find that very, very difficult.",
        "Q: And he was from which city?",
        "A: He was from Kalomaya(ph). It was Poland at that time, but that area seems to\nbe changing from the Ukraine, to Poland, to Russia, to Ukraine. I| think it\u2019s\nUkraine now. But he was born Kalomaya(ph), Poland, yeah.",
        "Q: Let me just ask if you have any other last thoughts, anything that we didn\u2019t talk\nabout, that you would like to talk about?",
        "A: During the Holocaust period?",
        "Q: [indecipherable] During the Holocaust, or the years right afterwards, coming to\nthe United States.",
        "A: It was like a dream come true coming to the United States, because of all the\navailability of food and \u2014 and whatever we had. Clean bed. I remember getting into\na bed, into a nice, clean sheet. That was \u2014 that was just delicious, it\u2019s just delicious.\nAnd \u2014 and taking baths, that was delicious. And \u2014 but during the war years, I\nremember a few points where my mother had the most difficult hardships. How she\nhad to be sent to the hospital because she had a \u2014 oh, what do you call it? Appendix.\nShe had to have an appendix taken out. And how that came about, I \u2014 I don\u2019t remem\n\u2014I\u2014IJI don\u2019t know how she even survived that. And then one time we were crossing\na \u2014 a border where she fell and just the difficulty of it all. And when I watch all\nthese Holocaust movies and stories, so \u2014 na \u2014 well, I cannot do all of them. I choose\nand pick which ones I want to watch, and I don\u2019t put myself in it. |\u2014 I\u2014I can\u2019t do\nthat, because it\u2019s just so horrible. So I don\u2019t put myself in it. It\u2019s like surreal, yeah.\nSo, I hope I was able to help you. I \u2014 I\u2014I really \u2014 yeah.",

And they asked us all sorts of\nquestions, and I was three or four years old. And they were talking to me, and I said\n\u2014I was whimpering. And I said, my father is a goy, my mother 1s goy, but I\u2019m\nJewish. And I was three, four years old, and they let us through. I \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: We stayed \u2014 we stayed in Czechoslovakia for a little while. I don\u2019t recall that at\nall. But soon after, we were able to get to Hungary, to Miskolc, Hungary. Well,\nfirst to Budapest. And from Budapest we went to Miskolc. I don\u2019t remember\nBudapest, but I do remember Miskole. We lived there as Gentiles for about a year.",
        "A: Okay, in between that, there \u2014 they were sent to an orphanage. And my father\nheard, or \u2014 or somebody had heard that things were really happening. Whether my\nfather knew where they were, or they were supposed to, but he didn\u2019t know whether\nthey were alive, but if they were, this is where they would \u2014 would have been. He\nsent a guide out there, and that was the day they were liquidating the orphanage.\nAnd \u2014",
        "A: Lam not sure whether it was in Czechoslovakia, or whether it was in Hungary.\nI\u2019m not sure. And the gar \u2014 the guide knew who they were, and he went \u2014 first it\nwas my brother, and he said, follow me. Don\u2019t talk, don\u2019t say anything, just follow\nme. And as they walked out, they \u2014 the Nazis came in and took the other children.\nAnd I think \u2014 I believe the same thing happened to Henya(ph), my sister Helen,\nand they were able to walk out of the orphanage, and they brought them to my\nparents.",
        "A: No, I do not. You know, a lot of things seems to be repre \u2014 repressed in my\nmind, and I get so upset with myself, so irritated that I cannot have those memories.\nI would do anything to \u2014 to really know how I felt, how my parents felt, or \u2014 you\nknow \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the rest of them. So, we lived in Miskole for about a year as Gentiles.",
        "A: Five of us, five of us. And as I said, we lived \u2014 lived as gent \u2014 we had a house,\nand in the house we had a cross, because we lived as \u2014 as Gentiles. And I remember\nbeing in the basement of the house, or \u2014 we went out to a shelter in a cave or\nsomewhere, and \u2014 and the Russians came in and they bombed the whole town, or\nthe area where we lived. The only house standing was ours. The cross came down,\nsmacked in smithereens, and the house was standing. There was a crack though, but\nthat was the only house standing 1n our neighborhood. So, to me that was absolutely\nmiraculous.",
        "A: We stayed \u2014 we stayed there for awhile. Well, we \u2014 during the bombing, my \u2014\nmy \u2014 my mother sent my brother out to get bread, there was a tremendous bread\nline. And he would bring home rotten bread, or whatever kind of bread we could\nget, and the bombs were falling, and you know. And my mother would prepare this\nbread in rancin \u2014 rancid oil that we kept so we could, you know, fry the bread. And\nthe only food we had was garlic. So we would have this rotten bread and rancid oil\nwith \u2014 spread with garlic. And you know Judy, it was the most delicious thing in\nthe world. But, soon after that, when the war \u2014 we were liberated by the Russians.\nAnd soon after that, I guess it was early part of 1946, I think it was the year \u2014 I\u2019m\nnot sure what part of the year it was, but my brother and my father decided they\nwould go back to Poland. We remained in \u2014 in Hungary. I don\u2019t remember that.\nBut my brother and father went, and he came back with stories that were just\nincredible. That was the time of the pogroms. Soon after the war, when Jews were\ncoming back to Poland, and my father and brother went to see our house, and they\nknocked on the door, and some Polish people were living there, and they slammed\nthe door in his face, saying, you were supposed to be dead. So at that \u2014 right after\nthat, this pogrom had started, and they escaped by this much from getting killed.\nThey survived the war, but they were so scared that they would \u2014 yeah. So, we went\nback \u2014 they went back to Hungary and my father told my mother, there\u2019s nothing\nthere for us.",
        "A: And at that time my father, he survived the whole war without being arrested,\nbut at that time he was arrested by the Russians. Because my father was bootlegging\nat that time, and the Russian soldiers got sick from \u2014 from this drink, and they\narrested my father for selling bad liquor to the Russians.",
        "A: Not \u2014 not terribly long, not terribly long. But, he had to make a living, right?",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we left soon after that, because I know we were in Gabersee, a DP\ncamp in Germany for three years. So, we left that in 1949. Excuse me. So we must\nhave left Hungary in \u00b046.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall that at all, I think we were just \u2014 you know, we made arrangements\nand we were placed in a DP camp. And we were there for three years, and even\nthough we had family here in the States, it was \u2014 I\u2019m sure, you know, it took\nforever to get the papers, and \u2014",
        "A: From what I remember as a child, it was okay. I had friends, I had schooling, I\nhad food. I was a little bit of nothing, and so that was life, and it was good.",
        "A: Well, my fath \u2014 ma \u2014 my father worked, my mother stayed at home, and I\nremember at that time my sister and brother wanted to make Aliyah to Israel. And\noh, they cried to go to Israel. But, you know, they were good kids, it was all family,\nyou know, and my mother said, absolutely not. She was tired of fighting, she was\ntired of being scared, and she wants peace in her life and she didn't want her\nchildren going to Israel and fighting another war. So, that\u2019s how they remained\nwith us, you know, that we stayed as a family unit. So we came to the States in\n1949.",
        "A: Well, we had the family. We had my aunt and unc \u2014 two aunts and an uncle ra \u2014\noh, no, we ha \u2014 that time we still had quite a bit of family left. We were a huge\nfamily. My father had a brother, two sisters. One sister with a husband, and an uncle\nwho I \u2014I hate to mention, that wer \u2014 that were in New York. And we had other\nrelatives th-through the States. So we stayed with them for awhile til we \u2014 til we\nsettled. But we arrived in New York harbor on a Shabbat, and cousins came to pick\nus up. My father would not get off the ship. He would not \u2014 it\u2019s Shabbat, he is not\ngoing in a car, he\u2019s not \u2014 you know. So here after \u2014 after 10 years of suffering, he\nwould not get off the ship. So my cousins left, and they came back a little bit later\nand they said, if you don\u2019t get off the boat now, we\u2019re not coming back and get you.\nSo finally he\u2019s \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he was \u2014 he was the sweetest man \u2014 so finally he\nconsented to get off the ship and we came to my aunt\u2019s house, Tante Eda(ph). And\nit was the beginning of a new life. But he \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 his faith was so very strong.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Somewhat. Their children are \u2014 are very religious, all of their children. My sister\nand brother-in-law are very \u2014 yeah, but they\u2019re not Hassidic or any \u2014 and that\u2019s a \u2014\nneither 1s my brother, but their children are very, very [indecipherable]. And\nwonderful, beautiful family, yeah.",
        "A: In Brooklyn. Bensonhurst, yeah.",
        "A: I was scared of a new language because I was able to pick 1t up no matter where\nwe were I spoke hungar \u2014 not that I know it now. But I spoke German and\nHungarian and Polish and you know, a little \u2014 a bissell(ph) here and a bissell(ph)\nthere. But when I came to America, I said, oh I\u2019m \u2014I\u2014 I don\u2019t know if I can learn\nthe language, I was really scared. And my cousin insisted that I only speak English\nin front of him, or wherever I was going. And then I forgot all the other languages. I\njust never retained it. But my parents took English when we were in Gabersee in\nthe DP camp, and they had a tutor come to the house. We had a one room place,\nand he would come to the house and teach my parents English, but it was English\nEnglish, so 1t was somewhat different than when we came to the States. But it never\nhelped, they wer \u2014 they managed with \u2014 with whatever they could speak. But one\nthing about my father, may he rest in peace, and God love him a million years, we\ncame on a Shabbat, on a sa \u2014 Monday he already had a job.",
        "A: Shoemaker, mm-hm, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Ah, I never looked for it. I know \u2014 I had a small group of friends, but I didn\u2019t\nhave an extended group, so I ne \u2014 I never really looked into that. And I remember\nbeing in one class, where the teacher called upon me and asked for me to speak in\nfront of the class, and I really couldn\u2019t because I was so foreign, it was so unrelated\nto the classroom atmosphere. I was very difficult, I \u2014 I \u2014 ve always told bits and\npieces, but I never \u2014 yeah. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m even helping you with this interview.",
        "A: Not for awhile, not for awhile. Maybe they talked to their family privately, like\nto their sister \u2014 their sisters. My mother did not have family here \u2014 she had a cousin,\nI take that back. She had a \u2014 a\u2014a\u2014a very Hassidic cousin and an extended family.\nShe did have a brother in Israel that settled there in 1933, but here in the States, it\nwas mostly my father\u2019s family. So, I\u2019m sure they talked among themselves, but not\nreally openly, not til later on. Not til later on.",
        "A: Oh my God, it took years.",
        "A: It\u2014 PI tell you exactly. Oh, I \u2014 it took years, and I know exactly when I realized\nthat. A number of years ago, there as a Holocaust renu \u2014 reunion here in\nWashington at the convention center. You must have been a baby then. I forget\nwhat year it was. I'll tell you later. \u00b069, or maybe seven \u2014 well, when a \u2014 and I tried\nto get involved with that, I begged my husband to get involved with that. And we\nsang \u2014 we went to the \u2014 President Reagan spoke then \u2014 no, so it must have been\nmuch later, was in the 80s. Okay, early 80s. And President Reagan spoke in front\nof the Holocaust reunion group. And I signed up for a few seminars at the\nconvention center in D.C. And I attended the second generation seminar. I don\u2019t\nknow what made me do that, but they spoke on children surviving, and families\nsurviving. And I finally realized \u2014 the reason I wanted to get involved in this thing\nwas because I just felt 1t. But what I realized at that time, and realized that I am a\nsurvivor, was that families of my \u2014 of my generation, did not survive. I realized I\nwas very unique and very rare, because children my age did not survive. And \u2014 and\nmy siblings as well, my sister and brother, who were sent out to God knows where.\nAnd how they reunited with their parents, and how my father survived all that. We\nwere very unique, and I cherish that in my \u2014 in my head, I \u2014 I could not believe that\nas a family unit we survived, you know? So that\u2019s when I realized I\u2019m a Holocaust\nsurvivor. We were in no camp. We were in no labor camp, but I think we survived\nmany \u2014",
        "A: That I-I realized I\u2019m a Holocaust survivor?",
        "A: Selfishly, I feel like I\u2019m a very special person. But my everyday life is, I\u2019m just\nas normal as you or anybody else. But when I look back on it, I feel very special. I\nwish my husband would feel that way. He\u2019s the silent one. He does not discuss it.\nSo it makes our feelings very, very difficult. And things that I would get more\ninvolved in, that I would like to get more involved in, I feel like I can\u2019t because I\u2019m\nnot getting his support. And he wouldn\u2019t \u2014 he won\u2019t accept my support. He lost his\nentire family, so he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014 he keeps everything inside. And it \u2014 I think he did a\nlot of damage to our children because he wasn\u2019t open with them. But they always\npursue, they always ask questions. But I find that a very, very difficult part of my\nlife, yeah. My brother-in-law, he was liberated in Auschwitz, and for many, many,\nmany years he would not speak of it. Like, I think it was a normal thing of many\nsurvivors at that time. But a few years ago, all of a sudden, everything came out.\nEverything came out. And he had a tremendous 1-interview with Spielberg and the\n\u2014 I believe the Holocaust Museum as well, an extended one. He made several\ndonations to the museum. I think one of his shirts is hanging there. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s\ndifferent than the others. I\u2019m sure you have enough of them there. So, sometimes I\nenvy people who can really speak out and be noticed for what they went through,\nwhere my husband is \u2014 yeah, I find that very, very difficult.",
        "A: He was from Kalomaya(ph). It was Poland at that time, but that area seems to\nbe changing from the Ukraine, to Poland, to Russia, to Ukraine. I| think it\u2019s\nUkraine now. But he was born Kalomaya(ph), Poland, yeah.",
        "A: During the Holocaust period?",
        "A: It was like a dream come true coming to the United States, because of all the\navailability of food and \u2014 and whatever we had. Clean bed. I remember getting into\na bed, into a nice, clean sheet. That was \u2014 that was just delicious, it\u2019s just delicious.\nAnd \u2014 and taking baths, that was delicious. And \u2014 but during the war years, I\nremember a few points where my mother had the most difficult hardships. How she\nhad to be sent to the hospital because she had a \u2014 oh, what do you call it? Appendix.\nShe had to have an appendix taken out. And how that came about, I \u2014 I don\u2019t remem\n\u2014I\u2014IJI don\u2019t know how she even survived that. And then one time we were crossing\na \u2014 a border where she fell and just the difficulty of it all. And when I watch all\nthese Holocaust movies and stories, so \u2014 na \u2014 well, I cannot do all of them. I choose\nand pick which ones I want to watch, and I don\u2019t put myself in it. |\u2014 I\u2014I can\u2019t do\nthat, because it\u2019s just so horrible. So I don\u2019t put myself in it. It\u2019s like surreal, yeah.\nSo, I hope I was able to help you. I \u2014 I\u2014I really \u2014 yeah.",
