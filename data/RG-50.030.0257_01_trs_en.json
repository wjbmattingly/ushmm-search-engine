        "Question: Would you please us your name and where and when you were born?",
        "Answer: Uh my name is Norbert Wolheim, born on April 26th, 1913 in Berlin, Germany.",
        "Question: Can you describe your childhood and young adulthood in Berlin?",
        "Answer: Well uh I...my family was a closely-knitted family and my father, bless his memory,\nwas uh uh a commissioned salesman and he had uh developed his own business before World\nWar I when he was called into service and the business then had to be closed. My mother, bless\nher memory, was a housewife and she took care of us during the time when my father went away\nto war. I was only one and a year year...one and a half years old when he left us to serve in\nFrance and in Russia with the German army. He was a member of the medical corps, and when\nhe came back in 1919 or so, after the end of the war, my mother always told me that uh I had\ndifficulties to to to greet him as a son because he had become a stranger to me because he had\nbeen away for so many years, and I grew up during the time of uh the Weimar (ph) Republic. I\nhad an elder...an older sister. Uh our parents saw to it that we had a good education and though\nuh we we longed...belonged to a called...would call it here to the middle \u2014\u2014_\u2014__ families, uh and\nthings were tough in economical terms uh after the war, during the inflation and later the\nDepression, but uh as I say our parents saw to it that we had a solid education, a solid uh general\neducation and also a solid Jewish education, so we all...my sister and I, we went toa toatoa\nupper elementary schools to high schools. My sister to a Jewish high school. I was in a non-\nJewish high school where in these years over there uh since I...we had not too many Jewish uh\nchildren, I met a certain amount of anti-Semitism but not uh militant anti-Semitism but it was\nyou called more kind of cultural anti-Semitism but uh uh we managed.",
        "Question: Could you describe that a little bit, what you mean by cultural anti-Semitism?",
        "Answer: Well, that we were not included in the human...you had you had groups uh who who\ndid certain things, uh whether be it in sport or socially, and so I was not invited. I was not\ninvited so it I didn't suffer from that, especially not when I, after my bar mitzvah, I joined the\nJewish Youth Movement and which asserted me of my Jewish values and my Jewish heritage\nbecause that was also somehow I would say a turn in my life because I became uh active in that\ngroup. I was thirteen, fourteen years old, and uh it was a group uh uh which was believing in the\nuh in in political and ideological terms in a synthesis between uh Germans and Jews. In other\nwords it was a non-Zionist movement. The uh major value of this was that you met the people\nwho had uh were devoted towards this idealism and hoping for a new world, for a better world,\nand the working that go by working on yourself. That means in educational terms uh we\nwe we uh read. We were at this time influenced I remember by writings of Martin ;\n, Studying the bible, studying our history...uh which as I say it was a very special\nvalue, but also uh uh by by trying to uh to make a contribution we did a lot of call it social work,\nwhich means taking care of needy uh uh children, especially uh uh children of our age in\ndistress. We worked with them. We we we we invited them. We we tried to help them. We\ntried to alleviate their problems by just showing that we are there for them and for them,\nespecially for children who came out from broken homes, who had who had uh a brush with the\nlaw and so on, so that we considered them as uh as people who had to be saved and this was part\nof our work between our contribution to try to help them, and uh this was I would say very\nimportant because there we established personal friendships, uh girls and boys and and uh we we\nwe we followed the principle of Boy Scouts. We we we discovered nature. We were hiking.\nWe stayed overnight in tents and we enjoyed the beauty of of of of nature. But at the same time\nwe had very interesting evenings in discussions. People had to be prepared to deliver let us say a\nlecture about whatever the subject matter was, be it literature, philosophy, or whatever it is and\nJewish and German kings or whatnot...general things, and that that was very, very attractive for\nall of us and and it gave us a certain sense of future responsibility. I would not say leadership\nbut responsibility and therefore whatever...",
        "Question: We need you to stop... . They're not getting quite the angle they want.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Question: Linda is asking me to have you personalize what you're saying a little more, how you\nas an individual experienced what's happening. Uh did you have a good friend in the\nMovement? What your favorite experience that you recall from those days? Did you have a\nleadership role, rather than a general, more of a...from your own eyes is what they're looking for,\nand also uh if you could, more about your family, talk about that. Also I don't think you\nmentioned the name of the movement, so when the tape starts again, you probably need to\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Question: Would you continue to describe the the youth movement, its name and what you\npersonally got out of it?",
        "Answer: Well the name us first the called , which is the German-Jewish\nYouth uh uh Alliance and later called , the Association of Jewish Youth, and and uh\nwhat I got out of it was that uh I found people of my age and and my call it mentality and and uh\nmy ideals and we we we uh worked together. We met actually during the week almost twice or\nthree times on evenings. We met over the weekends. We we were hiking uh in the area around\nBerlin which is beautiful and uh then as I say we uh we were really call it enriching ourselves\nwith with knowledge which which came about by exchanging news, by by putting people to\nwork let us say to to uh uh uh prepare a lecture or whatever it is in whatever the area was. At the\nsame time I would not uh uh minimize the influence of my of my parents on on on me. We\nuh...my father, bless his memory, came from a very traditional home in in the eastern part of\nGermany, from Posen (ph). He had a very basic Jewish education and uh we were uh uh not\northodox but very conservative. Uh uh we observed the holy days certainly uh and uh especially\nduring the holy days we saw the families and and friends and then uh my father and after the war\nas a veteran became active in the Jewish War Veterans uh uh movement, also doing social work\nfor needy uh veterans and my mother, blessed memory, joined the auxiliaries there and so we\nall...and my sister certainly was also active, so we were all active in in one kind of Jewish affairs\nor the other, but there was one day or one evening when all this...when when we assembled\naround the uh the uh family table and that was Friday evening. Certainly having kiddish (ph)\nand having the Friday meal and having having the relatives uh who joined us, but mainly after\nthat then people were dropping in for coffee and cake and then then the the events of the week\nand the events of the day were discussed and I got out a lot from that because first of all 1t was a\nwonderful family...family uh uh atmosphere in spite of all the difficulties we had around us\nbecause the diff...the economical situation in Germany during the inflation and then at the time\nof the Depression was not easy, but there was a warmth of a of a Jewish home which which I\nappreciated very much and I think formed me and and and therefore my my my rightful family\nand my my love for family, it came from there uh and which was held up in all as I say in all...in\nspite of all difficulties. My father worked hard to make a living uh but on Friday night as they\nsay in that famous uh uh uh song, Yiddish song, that on Friday night every Jew is a king, and this\nthis was reflected uh in the observance of the rituals and then also in in a social way and uh uh\nthat was known to us so and there there were no invitations sent out. People just dropped in and\nwe were happy to have them and shared with them whatever we had. Uh and uh in the youth\nmovement, not only did we do uh uh intellectual work and educational work but certainly uh\nthey developed ties with with friends and I must say that for for...over the years these ties\nbecame very...have remained very close, up to today. They are not too many people left survive,\nbut some of them I I went to together to Auschwitz and I lost them, but uh especially I must say\nwhen I came for the first time on a on a visit to this...to America. I was sent by the United\nJewish Appeal in 1946 to this country to bring the message of the survivors to to to the American\nJewry. I met some of my old friends of that time and uh it was interesting that we could...as if\nnothing had happened in between. These ties were there again in spite of of of distance and and\ntime. We got together again, irrespective of our changed political orientation in many a time or\nideological orientation, but this tie...these personal ties were strong ties and have remained uh uh\nand I would say still today for ourselves, the old guard, we get together whenever we can and\nand this has remained. I also met my first wife in the youth movement. We were very young\nand uh and developed a relationship and and later uh uh we got married in Berlin, so uh it it was\nuh a time which which somehow formed us in in in a certain way and I would say that my uh\ndevotion to uh to uh, if I may say so, to uh things outside of personal interest, to do something\nfor the community, to do something for...to make it...try to make a contribution uh\nwas...originated from the fact that I saw it in the house of my parents who had dedicated their\ntheir time and life to certain things within these limits of their possibility, and later uh in the\nyouth movement where we were educated in the belief that uh uh it's not enough what you do for\nyourself. You have to try also to uh to uh to do something for people who who are less lucky\nthan you are or or need your help and and and support.",
        "Question: And until what age did you stay in the youth movement?",
        "Answer: Actually I stayed in the youth move...youth movement as long as it existed, because in\n1945 our group was dissolved by the Gestapo. Uh we tried but in in spite...1n other words they\ndid not allow us to to continue uh to to operate. Certain other groups were still allowed to\noperate till 1938. We were not. In 1935 as I say, uh we were liquidated, but irrespective of that\nuh uh we we uh kept our contacts. In other words, what we did was then that we we decided\n. Every week we had birthday celebrations. We came to...got together and uh well\ncertainly under the Nazi time things had changed completely with uh our approach to...or our\nthinking in political and ideological terms changed. Uh there came a time when we came to the\nconclusion that that there is no future for for for Jews in Germany and we should help to prepare\nyoung people to get out of Germany, especially in the years 1940...1935, '36 when slowly but\nsurely uh we we did understand that uh uh uh the Nazi regime was there to stay, that it was not a\ntransitory uh thing, and that uh uh uh uh there was, as I said, no future for for...especially for\nyoung people. So uh uh if you want to...I've never left the the the Youth Movement. It\nit's still in me somehow and uh interesting enough, this is something which...a\npheno...phenomenon which 1s not only restricted to Germany. When I speak with my friends\nfrom the east, uh there was also something that they called the youth movement and it's\ninteresting when you meet the people who are who are came out of that, they have a certain\nspecial approach to to the Jewish community and to to life which I share very much with them.",
        "Question: Yes. Can you begin to describe now about Hitler's rise to power and how that\naffected you and and the Jewish ___ in the early '30's?",
        "Answer: Well, uh uh this is a loaded question uh because certainly in the '20's uh uh the Nazi uh\nuh party became stronger and stronger. There were differences of opinion...would they last,\nwould they not last, but uh given the political weakness of the Weimar Republic which was not\nuh uh able to enamor itself to the to the people, the fact that the uh democratic parties and the\nsocial democrats lost more and more in influence...uh uh we we...in spite of all that we thought\nthat the Republic would do...the Weimar Republic uh representatives would do something to try\nto stop the movement. They were not able to do it, so you had certainly a...during the\nDepression you had millions of unemployed and Hitler was uh uh able to...and his henchmen...to\ncapitalize on that and uh in addition to that that certainly there was a nationalistic feeling that uh\nGermany had not lost the war but was stabbed in the back and therefore the German army was\nnot defeated but was was uh defeated by the so-called home-front, which means by social\ndemocrats and communists and the Jews. Uh since we had our own Jewish values, I would say,\nit didn't affect us what the Nazi were were were were teaching and preaching, uh but on the other\nhand we were no doubt concerned what will what will happen in political terms. One\nconsideration was that uh uh if Hitler should try to come to power, the uh the uh powers around\nGermany...England, France, Czechoslovakia, Poland...would never...and Russia...would never\nallow him to do so but this was certainly an illusion as we learned later, and irrespective of that\nuh I and my friends and my future wife, we tried to uh uh participate as actively as we could still\nin the cultural life of of Berlin which was in this respect a wonderful city. It was leading in the\nin the area of music, theater, literature, and so on and we tried to uh to uh to uh to uh to\nparticipate to the best of our ability. In 1938...'31, I graduated from high school and I entered the\nUniversity of Berlin to study law and economics and as students we had certain, certain\nprivileges which...not privileges but certain uh when we went to the theater or the opera, it was\nfor very cheap money and we we we uh it was then still an accepted fact that we participated\nfully as Germans in this life, last not least due to the fact that in this cultural life you had many\nuh leading Jewish personalities. After all, in a city like Berlin...it was a city of Einstein, in the\nfield of music of __ and Otto (ph) and and and so and and say we uh we uh we really\nuh enjoyed it. Still we we were concerned about the fact that the uh the uh Nazis uh in a\ndemocratic way, uh were able to uh to uh add to their power because when it came to voting they\nincreased their seats in the in the Parliament, especially in the years of 1931 and 1932. Uh life at\nthe University, for instance, already was also influenced by the...remember that, you know, there\nwas there was uh uh a time around eleven o'clock when we all assembled in the lobby of the\nUniversity in Berlin, Jewish groups, the the leftists, and so on, democratic groups...sorry, not\nleftists...democratic groups, but also the Nazis and that didn't take long and uh there were brawls\nand there was fighting and so and since the University was ex-territorial, uh they didn't allow the\npolice to interfere so it was very unpleasant but the uh classes and also the classes of the Jewish\nprofessors, were not actually affected, at least not in Berlin. There was cases in Bressler (ph) we\nknow where they where they tried to disturb classes and so on, but not in Berlin and uh uh on the\nother hand uh also amongst the students it was taken up, amongst the intellectuals who originally\nvery much from the conservative groups of Germany, who had never become uh uh uh\nengaged in the principles of the Weimar Republic or democratic principles. Uh there was no real\nrebirth. I mean, democracy uh in after 1918 in Germany did not become a real fundamental\npolitical system, and uh especially these these uh nationalistic conserve...conservative groups\ncalled , they uh were uh...they produced most of the students. Also due to the fact\nthat uh uh then education became a monopoly of the of the uh more wealthier democracy in in\nGermany. There was not enough done in order to get people also out of less wealthier groups of\nthe of the of the progressive let us say, so we had our our our difficulties and still uh irrespective\nwe we did our work as students and uh and uh then when Hitler came to power on January 30th,\n1933...l remember that day very well. I was a student then and I had taken my classes and then\nall of a sudden came the news that Hitler had been called in to office by the German President.\nNow I want to emphasize that uh this was done in a very democratic way, which means that uh\nthat there was no uprising. I didn't see...I remember in Berlin when I came home from from the\nUniversity, I didn't see any soldiers uh walking in Berlin. Just the other way around the Nazis\nprepared for the tremendous torchlight procession they they they had organized for Hitler on on\nthe evening, and there was no opposition. Uh to emphasize in a very democratic way which\nmeans that that uh and this was the shock we had that he had actually succeeded 1n killing\ndemocracy in Germany with a means of democracy. Uh at the beginning in the first couple of\ndays uh uh the uh the uh especially the rowdies and the militants amongst the Nazis, especially\nthe Brown Militia then tried to take revenge against their opponents, but uh I luckily was not\naffected uh but we heard there was quite a number of cases where they tried to uh to uh to get\neven with their political opponents, especially social democrats, democrats and so on. And there\nwere a lot of acts of violence and we tried to follow up on it and to report it to the police. In\ncertain cases the police which uh uh uh was not at this time Nazified completely tried to help uh\nbut also they...but slowly this this this uh disappeared. So uh after a certain while uh this\nuh...these militant acts uh came to an end and the Nazis tried to organize themselves but then uh\naccepted the power more in in a legal way which means after the the uh burning of the\nuh and obviously it's my opinion that the Nazis had an actof \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014.:~ They promulgated very\nstringent laws taking away the uh the basic rights of people uh and uh then I came to the\nconclusion that most probably to continue studies at the University for law or of law uh would uh\nwould not guarantee me any future. After April Ist, 1933, certain uh laws were promulgated\nwhereby doctors and \u2014_\u2014_, uh Jewish doctors, Jewish doctors, lost their license, with the\nexception of those who had served as veterans in World War I, and since my father was uh\nuh...had seen action in World War I in France and in Russia, I was entitled to continue uh with\nmy studies, but as I say I did...came to the conclusion that uh this would not guarantee me a\nfuture, not in Germany, so then in uh in uh April-May I I stopped with my studies and I uh got...I\nwas volunteering in in some kind of Jewish community work because when I was in the youth\nmovement, the work done...especially the social work being done was always connected with the\nJewish community. The Jewish community in Berlin was a a very well-organized entity and had\ndepartments for the care from the cradle to the grave, I would say. Uh uh babies' homes and old\nage homes and so on, and we had a special department also for youth work and we were uh\nassociated with that group. Don't forget the Jewish community in Berlin uh uh consists of\napproximately two and one half thousand members. There was a certain tax system under which\npeople paid uh like they paid their income tax, they paid their Jewish taxes, and the Jewish\ncommunity financed all the activities out of these funds. In addition certainly there was certain\nprivate donations. So uh what I did was then I uh I became more active in in in this work,\nlooking for something else but then in 19...and my my my family uh was not personally affected\nthough it was more difficult for my for my father to continue his work as a commissioned agent.\nOn the other hand...and this is so absurd today when you're when you're hear this...uh one of the\nthings Hitler did was to uh to uh establish a a new order. My my father, for instance, had come\nhome with his decorations, his Iron Cross which was considered...was...he cherished it very\nmuch, so then one of the things Hitler did in '33 was to establish a a special medal for those\npeople who had seen active service at the front, and my father was a beneficiary of that which\nmeans that even Jews who had served in World War I also got this decoration, in the name of the\nFuhrer, absurd as it may sound today. So uh...and uh since most of the customers my father had\nwere non-Jews, I mean this decoration which you could display in a certain way, helped him so\nhe was still accepted as a as a German, if you want to, because at this time there were no\nJewish...special Jewish or something like. That came later. But things uh things uh...and\nthen interesting enough uh somehow by his force...by his...by introduction of certain uh laws\nalleviating the economical hardships and certainly the rearmament on which Germany started,\nthe economy somehow improved, uh believe it or not. And uh things also in this respect became\nsomehow easier for my father and and he didn't bad...do badly, to the same extent that uh you\ncan say that Jewish business did not...I mean certain of them closed but Jewish business, retail\nstores and so on continued to exist. Depart...Jewish department stores continued to exist and had\na...benefitted from the improvement of that situation and especially when it came to 1936 when\nwe had the Olympic Games in Berlin, then the Nazis for propaganda reasons certainly stayed\naway from any from any hostile activities and so on. Also because in connection with the\npolitical developments, the Nazis uh very gradually uh tightened the screws. In other words,\nthey they didn't start with the Holocaust immediately. It it was that they they started to feel their\nway around. They had to establish they have power. After they had taken care of all the\nopponents, the communists and the social democrats, the democrats, then they they they they uh\nuh felt that they were independently powerful and didn't have to listen to uh to uh any anybody\nelse and in in this this gave them then also uh as we all know unfortunately a power to to stre...to\nstretch their muscles in in international terms. In other words, the expectation we had that\neventually the powers like France, England and so forth resist, evaporated. Especially we had\n______ started to march into the Rhineland (ph) and uh though...we have learned this later...the uh\nGerman army was was uh uh under the order to return if if there should be resistance, uh and\nthey had no heavy weapons for that, but neither the French or the British resisted. France at this\ntime already...they had one of their crises so uh so Hitler was successful and when he felt that his\npower was growing also in international terms, then slowly the party also came to the conclusion\nthat that more should be done in order to exclude Jews from public life and from from\neconomical life, uh especially after the uh the uh the uh Olympic Games. I, in 1935, seeing\nsomehow the signs that the war and and we also in our groups who had believed in our future in\nGermany came to the conclusion that we had to change our our our approach, that whatever we\ncan do we should do to help people to uh to to get out of Germany, and also for those who live,\nas I say for one reason or the other, didn't or didn't want to go to Palestine, to other countries.\nThere were certain uh agricultural educational centers established to give those people who let us\nsay thought to go to South America or to North America and and enter agricultural life in these\ncountries, to give them the tools and the education. In 1935, as I said, I I entered a firm which...a\nJewish firm...which was active in the export-import business, especially in metals and and ore,\ndoing business with Sweden.\nLONG PAUSE IN TAPE\n...SO that people hopefully will learn something.",
        "Question: . It was interesting to me that as people get older and they remember all\nthese things from early on in their lives, it means that nothing is ever lost. It's all in there\nsomewhere. It's just not easily retrieved.",
        "Answer: Yes. And certain people don't forget one , you know. They cannot live\nmemory. I I think had this when we were checking people in connection with __ of\nthat trial I had against . They give these millions of and we brought the people in\nto check them out and I said well, for instance, where in Auschwitz,\nTAPE INAUDIBLE",
        "Question: OK. You can start again.",
        "Answer: In 1935 I joined a firm, a Jewish firm, uh firm in the import-export business\nspecializing in metal trade and ore trade. This firm had excellent business contacts with\nEngland, Sweden, France and the eastern countries, so 1t was my hope that when I would join\nthat firm, I could establish also some kind of a contact in order to find a way out. I was working\nthere as a kind of an administrative assistant. I didn't love that my little work too much, but it\nwas alright because I still at this time uh uh remained active to...1n in in in Jewish affairs,\nespecially with the Jewish community and youth work. Uh for instance, the Jewish community\nat this time had developed a program which was interesting. Since we couldn't have Jewish\nsummer camps any more in Germany, uh the man who was my youth leader at that certain time\nwas very active and innovative, had established contact with Sweden and Denmark and had\nasked the Jewish communities there to accommodate Jewish children from Germany during the\nsummer, and they responded favorably. In Denmark, for instance, they uh had uh established\nspecial special summer camps near Copenhagen where they took hundreds of Jewish children\nfrom Germany to spend the summer there, which was very pleasant and in Sweden interesting\nenough, the Jewish community in Malmer (ph) and Stockholm organized a a program taking\nJewish children into Jewish families during the summer and uh I was able to accompany these\ntransports, so I had a first...I got a first uh uh uh experience how to handle these kind of\ntransports and then certainly when we went to Sweden and Denmark, we also uh certainly got\nfamiliar with the families and with the organizations, so we thought that somehow would be\nhelpful if if if need be. And uh so these were also the years where let me say that uh in spite of\nthe Nuremburg Laws which which were established in in then made it clear that Jews couldn't\nmembers of the of the German , German people and uh uh created the uh the uh laws\nabout racial racial uh associations and so in other words uh for...were forbidding the marriage of\nJews and non-Jews and certainly we we we uh we...I wouldn't say we accepted this but on the\nother hand we also said it doesn't affect us in our Jewish attitude, in our in our...in the judgment\nwhat our Jewish values were. We...and I can say also personally...I said the Nazis cannot tell me\nwhat kind of a human being I am. I'm a Jew and proud of it. I will not and cannot deny that that\nGermany, German culture, German language, formed my my my my uh formed my my\nintellectual being, but the Nazis have no uh...even if they do this, if they consider Jews as\nsecond-class human beings, it doesn't affect me because I'm I'm I'm proud...and that as I say, the\nuh the uh education in the in my home and in the youth movement had given me that certainty\nthat that I didn't feel offended by it. What I felt influenced by it, certainly did not develop any\ninferiority complex, or any inferiority complex, so and then came 1936 were the Olympic Games\nwhere where all political radical activities in Germany came to a certain halt in order to to\npresent to the world the best face Germany could show. And as you probably know, also the\nAmerican team which came to Germany was very much affected. The head of the team, Mr.\nBrundige (ph), uh uh did not make a favorable impression on me when he when he uh uh\ndeveloped this kind of closeness with the Nazis and and certainly when this happened with Jesse\nOwens and and and Hitler was uh treating him the way he did, we were I cannot say glad but it\nit... we were we were glad that the world saw what what Nazism and the racial superiority\ncom....and racial superiority complex meant to them. Then in the years '37, '38, uh when Hitler\nfelt that his power was growing and that also the uh German army got got stronger, uh and uh\nthe the Nazi Party probably came to the conclusion that there should be more radical solutions as\nfar as the Jews are concerned and they could then __ slowly feel that uh they tried to exclude\nJews more effectively from all ways of life and and especially in '38 I remember uh department\nstores, retail business and so on were...went more and more into the hands of non-Jews. They\ncalled it , which means very often under under pressure people had to sell their\nbusiness and...but it was still done more or less in a certain...in a certain legal way. Uh until then\nwe uh we uh uh uh in '38, in I think in September, I lost my position with that firm because this\nfirm also had to change ownership, was forced to change the ownership and all Jewish\nemployees lost their positions, I myself included, and uh then I already had came to the\nconclusion that I should try my best uh to to try to get out. I got married in 1938, in summer of\n1938. Things in Berlin were not pleasant because before I got married in front of a big\nsynagogue in in Berlin, , there were certain riots against Jewish uh Jewish retail stores\nand department stores. They smashed windows. They attacked the people walking the big\nstreets in Berlin so was...there was a question even whether we could have the uh the ceremony\nin the synagogue or not. But uh then this somehow uh uh died down and and I got married in the\nsummer of 1938 to the to the to the lady I met in the youth movement and uh we uh uh uh and I\nlost her in 1943 when when we were deported to Auschwitz, but that's another chapter. And we\nall tried then strongly to get out. I...we were we were we were registering under the quota\nsystem at the American Consulate for instance and my...and I felt a responsibility also to do\nsomething for my my parents. My father could not continue anymore with his activities in\nthe...after November '38 and so we were...he was drawn into...also into the forced labor groups in\nBerlin doing doing construction work and so on, so he was on in years but he was still...he was a\nstrong man and he was able to uh to manage and I decided to to try to do something to offer\nwhen I got out, because I knew with studies of law, economics, I couldn't establish a position\noutside wherever it would be, and uh the Jewish community again as a place where where where\nneeds were met of the of the Jewish population, had developed a lot of vocational training uh uh\ncourses and I decided to participate in a course for welding, for \u2014\u2014\u2014s welding. J uh...it was a\ncouple of months, and since I had lost my position I had the time to do that, and uh I must say I\nsomehow established...uh I got to like 1t because uh uh some work with your hands which which\nwhich I found interesting, especially ordinary metal, metal welding and so on. Never was an\nexpert, but at least that saved my life somehow. So uh uh and then we uh we uh in No...in\nOctober of 1938, uh my wife's parents had come from the east, came from Poland, and as a\nmatter of fact they still spoke Yiddish. My wife, born in Berlin, my first wife born in Berlin\nwent to a German school so she knew both German and Yiddish and in in October 1938 the\nGerman government got into a dispute with the Polish government because the Polish\ngovernment was was not very friendly to Jews, very reactionary and almost anti-Semitic,\naccepted a law that uh the passports of people living outside of Poland had to be renewed, but\nthat the passport of Jews living, for instance, in Germany, would not be renewed which meant\nthat uh those people would loose their their their Polish citizenship and nationality and the\nGermans uh...and after all, there were thousands of Jews from Poland living in Germany still\nthen. We had quite a big well-organized group of Polish Jews, for instance, in Berlin, and and\nthe Germans then came to the conclusion that they will not accept this challenge by the Polish\ngovernment because then they would be burdened as they thought with stateless Jews which they\ncouldn't deport if they wanted to to especially to Poland, so what they did was that before the uh\nthe laws uh became valid, they uh uh uh rounded up uh Jewish families of Polish origin I might\nsay, all over Germany and in in Berlin just the man...in in in other cities, full families and\ndeported them to the...deported them to the east into the no-man's land between Germany and\nPoland and uh this created a terrible situation. And of course in a matter of hours or so that that\nthey they invaded their homes in the middle of the night and took people out uh uh and amongst\nthose who were deported were uncles of my wife and uh who had come from Poland and had\nmade their way in Berlin, so we were also personally affected, but there was nothing we could\ndo. Uh the the only thing we could do was again that the Jewish uh community went into action\nand established interestingly enough call it cooperation of the police and the Gestapo and some\nrelief uh uh and work at the uh railway station where these transports came through and I\nparticipated also in that work uh uh because especially bene...came to help the younger people,\nthe contact between the youth movement members was still there irrespective of their ideological\norientation, Zionists, non-Zionists. There was a job to be done and we did it and uh it was it\nwas...there was utter confusion. It was was was a ruling because uh the Germans pushed people\ninto the no-man's land, especially in the area of uh Posen (ph) or this \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014s what they called it,\nin in east Germany and Upper Salasia, and the Poles didn't accept them, so for many many days\nthe unhappy people were exposed to the elements and and were not admitted to Poland and\ncertainly were not re-admitted to Germany. Uh so uh but eventually uh uh this was somehow\nsolved. Poles admitted some groups and organized relief action, as I found out later also with the\nhelp of young people of the Polish-Jewish youth movement in Poland, and uh it was so absurd\nthat I remember when we did this work, uh there were transports still rolling towards the east and\non the other side of the of the railway station, uh wagons, coaches came back with Jews who had\nnot been admitted and had been pushed back, but they originated not from Germany but from\nVienna, for instance, so that the problem for the Jewish community was to bring them back at\ntheir expense to Vienna because they had nothing to do in Berlin and uh amongst these uh uh\npeople who were deported were were were was a couple from Hanover by the name of\nGreenspan (ph), and uh as you know from history, young Greenspan who had lived in Hanover\nand had left his home in Hanover and had went...had gone to Paris and lived in Paris under\nabominable conditions...he was not...he had no permission to stay. He was frightened by a\ndeportation ordinance so obviously in his in his despair then uh bought a pistol and went to the\nGerman Embassy and shot this uh German. He got who interestingly enough was not\nan ardent Nazi. Uh when this happened uh we were all alarmed and I know that I was deeply\nalarmed because something similar had happened before in Switzerland. A Jew with the name of\nFrankfurt (ph) had had shot and killed the representative of the Nazi organization in Switzerland\nby the name of , but at this time the Nazis obviously didn't feel strong enough that they\ncould do anything. Uh so uh but now we knew something would. Also uh uh shouldn't forget\nthat this November's events came after Munich, the all...I remember that I think it was\nSeptember...thought we were somehow on the brink of war in 19...September 1938 under these\nfour, Hitler and Mussolini and and and Chamberlain got together in Munich and\nhammered out the agreement selling out Czechoslovakia to the Nazis and this also uh somehow\ngave the Nazis the feeling that now they were very powerful because actually uh Chamberlain\nhad submitted to them and then he was so foolish when he got back to to London to to wave this\npaper saying that in the morning before he left Munich for London he had another meeting with\nHeir Hitler and this 1s to say the proof that we have peace in our time, so when the November\nevents came, certainly Germany already was in a much stronger political and military situation,\nand for us uh uh it was the indication definitely that that uh the end of the Nazi regime we had all\nhoped for, because we had thought that for economical and political reasons there would be...it\nwould be only be a transitory existence...that this was not true. And I uh uh must say that uh...\nEND OF TAPE 1\n..especially Kristallnacht because it's a Nazi label.",
        "Question: OK. They asked me to stop you at this point. The tape is almost finished and they\nwant to change...",
        "Question: Could you pick it up with what happened in November 1938?",
        "Answer: Yeah. Should I go back to the youth movement first?",
        "Question: Yes. If you want to talk about how you got....whenever you're ready.",
        "Answer: I'm ready.",
        "Question: OK.",
        "Answer: Uh before I continue with the events of the November 9th, I think uh it would be\ninteresting to know what kind of a position I had in the youth movement. We call it uh...we were\nnot standing on formalities. We had no statutes and so that no charters didn't exist, but I was a\nmember of the , which we considered the executive and I I belonged to the to the\nleadership of of this group as long as we could...uh we were able to operate which means up till\n1935, and then uh uh uh later as I told you when we were still trying to keep the contacts, it it\nwas in a very informal way. There was no position or special position. Just I was...I...based on\nmy seniority if you want to. I had . Now to go back to the 9th of November. Uh when\nit happened in Paris, I was deeply concerned like all of us and I had a feeling that something was\ngoing to happen, uh something basically that means the Nazis now aware of their power and of\ntheir new won role in the world would say well, we don't take this, and they were whipping up\ntheir propaganda. The headlines were deeply depressing. But there was nothing we could do.\nWe had just to wait and see where where where where where...somehow where...when and\nwhere they would act. On the November 9th, uh I interesting enough, it was a day when I had to\nbe prepared for my final final examination of the welder course and uh then uh in the in the\nmorning when I got out, somebody was in the street I met and said Norbert, the synagogues are\nburning, and I couldn't believe it. And then a he...look at these stores...you know, there were still\nJewish stores...and I saw that uh that uh they were smashed, that the windows were smashed. I\ndidn't hear that during the night, and I couldn't believe this, so uh what I did was I went to my\nsynagogue where I had been married and I saw that the the the the flames were coming out from\nthe roof, from the cupola...beautiful edifice, and the fire engines were standing by doing nothing,\nonly protecting the buildings next to it that the fire shouldn't extend to them. And I still couldn't\nbelieve it. I went to to another synagogue which was a very prominent synagogue in west\nBerlin, , and I saw the same...uh flames coming out and there, however, was already I\ncould see a tremendous amount of destruction. I was standing there and listening to what the\nGermans had to say. There was glee amongst them. Uh you know, they said now they got there\nwhat they deserve and so on, and I asked myself is this the people, uh is this in whose\ncivilization you believe. Is this the people of Gerta and Shiller (ph) and of the German\nphilosophers, the people of the of the philosophers and poets? And and and I simply...I couldn't\ncomprehend it. It was not acceptable for me. I wouldn't say not acceptable. I saw it but I\ncouldn't digest, not not intellectually and not emotionally. And then I went, for instance, to a\nsynagogue where the famous Rabbi Prince (ph) had had uh been, had off...officiated over the\nyears, and there the building was almost completely burned down. The only part which was still\nleft was the lectern from which he had always delivered his very famous and encouraging\nsermons for for the Jews there. Of course, he was a very proud Jew and a very active Zionist.\nSo uh uh and I and and I asked myself 1s this possible. What goes into into people to do these\nthings? Uh I had...my my knowledge was...I had read about pogroms in the Middle Ages 1n in in\nespecially before the Crusaders went to to liberate then Palestine uh uh but and when the Jewish\ncommunities 1n in in especially along the Rhine had been destroyed by these Crusaders before,\nbut still I was...we were living in a modern age, and I really...I had believed in...that was part of\nour education, the goodness of man. Could this be possible? Uh and uh then I went through to\ntake my exam, and uh my then wafe (ph) then wife came to me and said Norbert, you're not\ngoing home. We were at this time still living with my parents in the eastern part of Berlin. I said\nwhy. She said because we heard that the police is going around taking men into custody, so uh\nI've arranged already uh that you will stay with the mother of a friend who had just left for for\nAmerica recently and and she is alone and she would be glad you come so that she feels\nprotected somehow, and I said what about my father. She said also for your father we have made\narrangement to uh to uh to uh take shelter in the apartment of a sister who 1s a widow. And uh\nthat's what we did, uh unaware what what uh what the next step will be. And then the next day\nmore or less we...and I I was going around...I mean you could go around freely. There was no\nrestriction. I saw what what had happened in the main streets of Berlin, uh\n, which were the main business streets where you still had quite a number\nof Jewish stores, retail stores, and they had been smashed and vandalized and the merchandise\nhad been looted. Uh they say that uh I I couldn't control it but...couldn't check it but that, for\ninstance, the ladies of the night had helped themselves to the fur coats out of the of the some of\nthe retail stores on in Berlin. And uh so I spent uh uh a couple of nights outside of my\napartment and uh then uh more and more uh news reached us...and I took cont...tried to contact\nmy other friends and found out that also the uh the uh major administrative buildings of the\nJewish communities had been somehow vandalized, so that uh there was no...there was no\nactivity. That was for quite a number of days and and and and well, I realize now that uh\ncompletely that in this respect the uh the uh saying of my my spiritual leader and rabbi, Leo\n______, who was the senior of of and the leader of uh call it German Jewry, was right when he\nsaid that the historical hour of German Jewry has come to an end. And my question was what\nam I going to do now. Especially I felt new responsibility for my parents, for my sister, who uh\nalso tried to do something to get out of Germany, and uh then something happened uh when uh\nwe heard that _\u2014_\u2014, some of the men had been taken into custody, had been taken away, and we\ndidn't know where. There were friends of mine amongst them and then we found out that\nespecially those men who had been taken into custody in Berlin had been shipped to the\nconcentration camp of Saxonhausen-Orianenburg which was the uh big camp in the north of\nBerlin. And that was all we knew. Uh so uh a couple of days later uh somehow uh the Nazis\nthought that 1t would be right at least to release those people who had been veterans of World\nWar I, and some of them were found walking around in the streets of Berlin, and uh but they\nwere...there was a terrible, terrible appearance because their heads been shaved. Their...the the\nNazis whenever you come to a camp, were delivered into a concentration camp, the first things\nthey did was shave your hair and their clothing was completely crampled (ph) because it had\ngone through a so-called disinfection process, so uh...and then one building of the Jewish\ncommunity had started somehow to operate again, and one of my leaders of the youth movement\nhad immediately uh started to organize some kind of relief for those people who if they had been\ntaken into custody in Berlin, they knew where to go, but many of them had come from cities\noutside of Germany, from northern Germany, from western Germany...those who had not been\ntaken to Buchenwald or Dachau had come especially from places like west Germany or rural\ndistricts and so on. And we organized...and and he organized this kind of relief action and he\ncalled me into that, to uh try to pick up these people who came by railway from the concentration\ncamp into Berlin, and you could recognize them immediately, and to bring them to the Jewish\ncommunity where they uh first of all were treated medically. Some of them had terrible wounds\nbecause of frostbite and so...give them a decent meal, and especially those who had uh come\nfrom other...who originated from cities outside to establish the first telephone contact with their\nfamily. That was part of my work, and that was really...I mean uh call it emotionally rewarding,\nand I said listen, I have here Mr. so and so. He would like to speak to you. And very often you\nheard on the other side an outcry so so uh this kind of work uh uh became became uh uh took on\ntook on very substantial dimensions because more people then were released, and as I say, I\nparticipated in that and to a certain extent also my then wife, because she had also lost her\nposition, and that was nota __, a work from nine to five, and there was...that was not on a\nsalary basis. It was simply...it was just relief work to do what had to be done and also, for\ninstance, to organize that these people could get back...uh had by by by railway to their different\nplaces. Uh and one of the things they they asked uh time and again when these people came, and\nsaid what what what what do you know about about us, what what does the world say? Tell us.\nTell me. What does London and New York and Washington say about this? And uh I must say\nthis was one of the of the questions uh I...we...none of us, myself couldn't answer. We felt very\nbad about it, because certainly luckily we had not...I had not been affected. I had avoided the the\nthe the uh the uh this kind of action and uh when they...when these people asked me and said uh\nfine, you are doing all this work. It's wonderful, but the future is now dark there. I can't...1 mean\nI know that that that my business 1s destroyed or I am not uh entitled to continue in my activities.\nUh we were told uh you will be release...you are being released here from the from the\nconcentration camp under the condition that you leave Germany as quickly as possible, so what\ncan you tell us? And my answer was unfortunately nothing. Certainly uh for those of us who,\nyou know, to to listen to uh radio Strasburg (ph) in in German or to BBC London, it was was\nprohibited and there were very severe penalties, but still it was being done. So the only thing we\nwe...I could also say from the information I had that there were demonstrations in New York and\na big meeting in Madison Square Garden, a tremendous amount of words, uh also but no action.\nNothing. And uh I felt almost lost when when when these questions...and the people were...felt\nlost. Certainly they were they were happy to uh to uh be out of the concentration camps. It\nwas...all of them somehow were under shock, because the treatment they had uh experienced in\nthese camps was torturous. They told us about the details uh where where in also...I mean I had\nheard before what what people had been exposed to when they were taken to Buchenwald or so\nbut but you know, here you heard it for the first ttme from people that had just come back\n(cough) about this this this...the amount of violence to which they had been exposed, so...and the\nbeatings and and standing in in in the cold for hours and hours without...or, for instance, just\nmarching without any sense or or or shoveling uh uh sand from one heap to another and then...I\nmean without any sense. Uh so uh I see in this respect we all felt lost. I felt lost, and uh there\nwas nothing. Even when I discussed it with my wife and my parents, uh there was helplessness,\nabsolute helplessness. And and we we felt lost by the world. Now uh then one evening when I\nwas doing this work, the man who was in charge of that relief operation came to me and said,\nlisten, I have just received a call from the head of the uh central organization of Jews...the name\nwas the of Jews from Germany, which means the representative of the rights of Jews\nin Germany...his name was Otto Hirsch (ph). He also had been taken into a concentration camp,\nhad just returned and he called me and said uh uh...and he was rather emotional...uh there is\nsomething then very new development. Uh believe it or not, the situation of the Jews in\nGermany and Austria, because Austria was also affected by the November events, it has been\ndiscussed in the House of Commons and there is some action under the auspices of the former\nPrime Minister of of England, Baldwin (ph), and Jewish prominent leaders like uh uh Viscount\nSamuel (ph) and and so they have agreed to uh to uh accommodate ten thousand uh uh\noppressed children, Jewish or non-Jewish, but oppressed children so uh uh this is is now to be\norganized also from here, from Germany and uh Mr. Hirsch said well, we have terrific social\nworkers who gradually were flocking back to the office, you know, in order to do work, but they\nneed technical help and this is something you have to do. And I said to him, Martin, excuse me.\nI I'm in the middle of my preparations. I would like to to leave Germany as soon as possible\nbecause we all are in the same situation uh and and and he said yes, but you know that's part of\nour education. There's a job to be done and uh uh in Germany you would call it , in\nother words to do a thing just for the cause and not for the reward. So see...he told me next\nmorning, see uh Otto Hirsch in in in his office and he will tell you all the details, and I came to\nhim. As I say, he was the executive director of all operations, Jewish operations, because we had\na centralized uh organization for that. I knew him because he was the father of a friend who was\nalso in our move...youth movement, now living in in Washington, and he gave me details, telling\nme that (clearing throat) uh he just had been advised that this is what the British government has\nagreed to and to...but no special conditions. The only conditions were children have to be\nhealthy, had to go with the permission of the parents because the parents could not accompany\nthem, and uh had...were restricted to the age of twelve to seventeen because this would be\nconsidered the age where they could be...could go without the accompaniment of their parents\nand and and uh wouldn't create special educational problems. So Otto Hirsch told me uh uh\nkindly help us, because uh our social workers are very devoted and excellent workers but uh\nunfortunately they have no experience in technical matters. I said but I have never done\nsomething like that. Certainly I have participated in the organization of summer camps in\nEngland, and and in Sweden and Denmark. He said still uh kindly help us. I said but don't\nforget I am in the middle of my preparations also to leave Germany, and he said well, uh I can\ngive you my promise that when this will be done and will be successfully done, it will be our\ncommitment and our obligation to help you and your family to get out of Germany. Well, it's a\npromise to which he couldn't live up because uh in early in 1941, I think, he was uh taken again\ninto custody, was shipped to the concentration camp of Mauthausen and murdered there in cold\nblood. So what I did then was, I went to this office where there was a department for children,\nimmigration which ___ had established before because there was a trickle of children uh who\nhad been given the opportunity to go to France, Belgium, Sweden and and America, within the\nquota. And uh I came to that office and uh when I saw what was going on, I almost died. I...my\nstomach turned around, which was certainly can be explained only from the situation we were in.\nUh there was a big conference room in that uh office, covered with uh cards, heaps of cards and\nthere was a desk which was covered with papers and the telephone was constantly ringing and I\nwas given to understand...uh there was a lady who was in charge of it. She had before been uh in\nhigh service under the Prussian government, a Jewish lady, uh had been assistant to one of the uh\nsocial democratic ministers from Prussia, and uh a trained social worker, and she told me that\nsomething has to be done to to organize this properly, and uh after having seen that and having\nrecovered a little bit, the first thing I did was to call in some of my friends, again from the youth\nmovement. We all uh at this time had no...were not gainfully employed in productive work, and\nall purposes more or less lost our positions and uh the first thing I organized were these\ncards...these cards were so called...when I asked what is it...these are permits which had come in\nalready from England to give uh children the the permit to come to England. In other words they\ndidn't need passports and so there were special cards worked out with the cooperation of the\nhome office in England, with a picture and so...which had come from England and then the\nGerman police had certified the the the uh the names and the age and so on, and these were cards\nwhich which gave the young people of that age a license to enter England, so the first thing we\ndid...was I did was, with the help of my friends, to organize these cards in alphabetical order and\nin geographical order in order to have some kind of a of a of an idea what was what, and then it\nwould give me some some working room at the desk and organized the telephone calls to such\nextent that, you know, when, for instance, it happened a telephone call came from a from a\ndesperate parent from anywhere and said what's about the application of my of my of my child,\nand then one of these social workers jumped to that table and they they they fished out of the of\nthat mound of of paper the the the permit, because they said yes, I remember it had arrived this\nmorning or yesterday morning. And as I said, there there was disorder but not...but not |\nbecause they wanted but things were...had had had had...were were in a rush and and and and\nhad overwhelmed them, so uh then I found out that we...i1t was...we...1t was organized in such a\nway that people, that parents were advised in Berlin and the Jewish communities outside of\nBerlin and also under the rules and regulations, they had set already with the with the...believe it\nor not by cooperation with the with the Gestapo, under which the the had to work, that\nuh uh the Jewish communities, the the welfare agencies uh and agencies had to select the\nchildren, which means that the children...the parents who got a way of assist of this project, made\nan application to the proper Jewish communities and then the social workers, the local social\nworkers, then checked the...1f the conditions were right and and then they they made the\napplication. I had nothing to do with that, so what my task was, and I was advised to do that,\nwas to organize the transports so that they could get out of Germany. Now also that was not an\neasy task because we had to live under certain rules and regulations because in order to prepare a\ntransport, you had to prepare the proper lists, the records. One copy had to go to the Gestapo.\nOne copy had to go London in order to advise the people in London that the children were\ncoming and whoever were the prospective foster parents or the the hostels which had to be\nprepared for these people had to be had to be made ready, and all this was done. Certainly there\nwere no faxes and no computer systems and and and when you made...had...the telephones did\nnot uh...there was no push button system. For instance, to make a telephone call to London from\nBerlin could last hours and hours and even within Germany it was not...you know, it was still in\nthe age of...the the age when most of the work or all the work had to be done manually. So\nsomehow this we got under control and I set up a certain...I can't say I because uh I was then I\nwas made responsible for all technical aspects of these transports, so that means uh first of all to\nsee to it that the that the lists were properly prepared, that the parents were were advised uh when\nto when to bring their children to Berlin, especially from eastern or northern uh Germany and\nmiddle Germany, because the starting point was Berlin. Then I had to uh approach the railway\nauthorities to give us reserved coaches, because they couldn't travel with the other public. Uh\nthen a special room had to be made available as an assembly point in a railway station. The local\npolice had to be advised, because uh certainly all this was done under the supervision of the\npolice authorities. Uh then we had...and I...that was also my responsibility to find escorts.\nParents could not go with their children, so we had to find escorts to take them, to take these\nchildren, so again there was the the human resource...of of the young people of the of the of the\nmembers of the youth movement, irrespective as I say, Zionists, non-Zionists, all this\ndisappeared. And we found wonderful people, teachers and and youth leaders and so who who\nvolunteered for that service. Uh and uh at the beginning we were...it was made clear to us that\nuh these escorts could only escort the uh the youngsters to the border, but there was no chance to\ntake them to England. This luckily changed very soon thereafter because we were able to\nconvince the authorities that uh it was in the German interest also to take them up to London, and\nthey agreed under one condition...that all these escorts uh were to return again to Berlin. Now at\nthis time uh starting in the summer of 1938, all Jews who who were holding a German passport\nhad stamped...and irrespective of the Nazi laws, we were still considered German nationals...all\nGerman passports had printed a J into their passports, and when people came back, especially\nafter the November events, to Germany they were taken immediately into custody and shipped\ninto a camp, in a concentration camp, so in order to protect our escorts, the uh Ministry of the\nInterior, the Nazi Ministry of the Interior, gave everyone who who was an escort, they call it\nprotection letter which he could use for the border police to say and it said that so and so, in my\ncase Norbert Israel Wolheim, you know that's my name, was was is is traveling in German\ninterests and should be and so uh we had the first transport under those conditions ready\nin January. And I was instrumental in...that was my first responsibility, and uh together with\nsome friends who were also escorts I uh accompanied this transport to the border which was uh\nBentheim (ph). It was a German...a Dutch border. I also had to inform not only the people in\nEngland but people in Holland, Jewish...the uh the uh relief organizations because they wanted to\nhelp the children when they were traveling through uh Holland because the technical\narrangements were that people...as I said, before came from all kinds...from all cities, assembled\nin Berlin. Then from Berlin the train left, went via Hanover to the border in Bentheim, uh uh\nwent into Holland, uh went from to , Holland where they boarded a ferry and the ferry\ntook these children uh through the Channel or via the Channel to Harwich (ph) in England where\nthey landed in England and they had to undergo immigration uh checks and and customs checks\nand then the train took us from Harwich to London where at Liverpool Street Station, the Jewish\nCommittee of of uh of London had established their reception center where then the parents and\nthe uh the uh officials came and and and distributed the children. This first transport uh uh still\nis very vivid in my memory because when we came to the border, uh the SS guards who were uh\nuh doing custom duties and they were not all of them, or none of them was trained in this\nrespect...they ascended the the the uh coaches and they behaved like vandals. They did not\nattack the children, but they treated the luggage...1t was completely vandalized, the luggage.\nWere tearing it apart looking for jewels and for foreign currency and for things like that.\nCouldn't find a thing, but at least this is what they did, and any attempt to talk to them and so\ncertainly was in vain. And uh then uh it was so bad that they uh separated the coaches with the\nwith the Jewish children from the other train and the train left for Holland and when this train\nwithout the children arrived in Holland, the authorities there were waiting and saw the children\nwere not there. And amongst the people who were serving... mean who were uh the cause was\nwas were two ladies whose name should be remembered in in gratitude. Both non-Jewish. One\nwas uh Ms. Fontaine (ph) and the other Mrs. Weismiller (ph) who even even had dealings with\nthe . Very courageous, wonderful uh lady. She was the uh the uh the wife of a banker, a\nprominent banker in Holland, had no children and had devoted all her time to to help especially\nchildren, Jewish, non-Jewish, and she all of a sudden came from Holland. She had made her\nway from Holland to Bentheim and uh when she saw and she heard what has happened...uh don't\nforget, it was before the beginning of the war...she lashed into these SS people. It was...I was so\ngrateful,and \u2014\u2014_\u2014scone of these SS men, said I have the feeling you don't like us very much and\nshe said well, personally I might but as a group you are impossible. But then, interesting\nenough, by her interventions she...they they stopped their their vandalism. The two coaches\nwere then attached to a later train which still made in time for the ferry and we then uh uh were\nable, as I tried to explain before, to get the permission of the of the Department of the Interior to\nget passports to take these children to to to to England. Now to select these people was a very uh\nuh uh difficult thing and I felt the responsibility because certainly everybody uh who had a\nchance to go to England certainly looked for a chance, and there were friends or relatives\npressing on them and said are you stupid to go back, but this was the condition, and they\nhad...the the Nazis had told us in no uncertain term that if people would not uh obey their order,\nthen these these transports would come to an end and this certainly we could not afford. So as I\nsay, I was very, very careful in the selection of those people and thank God with the exception of\none case, it worked. Now we had uh uh uh approximately I think twenty, twenty transports uh\nwhich left Berlin. Uh it was my duty to see all of them off, and I was uh uh uh every morning\nwhen they came together, I was there to to arrange it, so uh uh whether I went with the transports\nor not, that was 1n a in a big hall in in in call it Berlin, and also part of my duties were\nto see to it that the children came to Berlin 1n time so that they were pre...and certainly they came\nwith their parents or their relatives and this was then the uh the the moment of their goodbye, so\nuh there was a problem uh with the first transports which...for which I had not been responsible.\nA smaller group had left in in in December I think, and the parents had accompanied these\nchildren to the to the trains and certainly parents in good faith they try to get the best window\nseats for for their children, and there was a certain turmoil and the police told us in no uncertain\nterms that if this would be repeated, they would control all the all all these arrangements. We\nwere able to convince them that we will take over, that we will see to it that order should prevail\nand that they shouldn't interfere, that they could be present if they want to, not _ present fine\nbut they shouldn't interfere. And I think it worked. So uh when in the morning when when\nwhen such a transport was due to to leave, as I say, I was there and uh it was a very, very, very...I\nremember that very distinctly the atmosphere, you know. It was...there was tension in the air.\nThere was an atmosphere of expectation. There was concern by the parents. There were...there\nwere kiss...there were tears of laughter and tears of of joy and and the concern and pain and it\nwas a very, very special atmosphere which was difficult to describe. And then when the when\nthe hour of departure came closer, I uh ascended a a chair, some kind of a lecture, and told the\nparents...ladies and gentlemen, the time has arrived to say goodbye, because we are under strict\norder not to let you accompany your children to the platform. The escorts will take over and the\nbaggage handlers had to do their work before to to handle the baggage, but you cannot come and\ndon't...please uh cooperate and don't make our our work more difficult. But this is the time you\nhave to say goodbye. And there were, you know, last kisses and last hugs and and and and...but\nin general I still admire these people, how courageous they were. Nobody broke down, but also\nthere was the expectation that uh sooner or later they would be reunited again. Very often I\nasked myself the question later, where did I take the courage to do that you call it ;\nwhere where from? I was young. I was only twenty-five in these days, and I thought uh uh that\nthis is a job to be done in order to help these children and I also I must say that at this time I and\nnobody else could have thought for a moment that this would for many, for almost ninety\npercent, the last goodbye. Nobody could expect that let us say a year and a half later after these\ntransports had rolled to the west into freedom, that transports would leave for the east into the\ninto the slaughterhouses of Hitler in Auschwitz or or Treblinka. I said nobody could\nforesee it in the worst of of of your vision, and then uh thus I I say this probably also...yes, gave\nme the justification to say to these parents and many I talked to to the children who were safe...I\nsaid that this is a moment, one of the most important moments 1n their lives which they still\nremember vividly, and I was involved in that. But I came to terms with that by saying this is the\ncontribution which which which we had to make and in the long run, at least for these children, it\nturned out for the good. And uh when we landed in in England, uh we were uh helped...the the\nJewish Committee was then the Bloomsbury (ph) House in in England which cooperated with\nthe . It was the central headquarters of the board of Jewish deputies in England and\nand helped us to stay in England for two days or two...two and a half days. I had...constantly I\nhad uh uh discussions with my counterpart in the in the Committee there to streamline\noperations, to uh...also there were certain requirements in England which had to be obeyed and\nthere was always...I didn't have too much time in England to see friends or relatives though I\ntried to manage somehow, and also I had the privilege...the other escorts on their way back had\nto take the train. I had the privilege to uh to uh to take the...to fly back which at this time was\nstill a big thing, but since I was needed in Ber...Berlin so badly, I, as I say, I could fly back. We\ndid not see where the children were going because we didn't have the time. Our job had ended\nthe moment we handed them over to the committee at Liverpool Street Station and they were\nthen uh uh acquainted with their foster parents or or or the families they took them in or the\nhostels. Only one transport I took uh uh from London up to the north of England. That was the\ntransportof _, of trainees for for for then Palestine, because uh Lord Balfour (ph), the\nfather of the Balfour decoration, who had no children, had made his castle in in Scotland, near\nthe \u2014__ near Edinburgh, available to the Jewish agency and the Jewish agency had used one of\nhis janitor homes or so to establish a kibbutz there where the young people were educated uh for\nand prepared for for Palestine and uh I think a group of ten or twelve of mainly boys I took to\nthat place because I wanted to see what was going on, but that was the only time when I was\nreally...at this time when I became familiar with the conditions of the children we are taking to\nEngland. Certainly later I've seen a lot of literature about these events. I saw the problems, the\ntremendous problems, and I think this should be made part of of history because uh uh first of\nall, it 1s part of the Holocaust history but I would also say it is something which which for which\nwe have to express gratitude to England. After all, when they discussed it and when they\npromulgated this this project, they were still somehow under the influence of Chamberlain's\npolicy of appeasement and uh nevertheless under the impact of the events in Germany, especially\nin November, uh uh they came to the conclusion that we want to do something. They did not uh\nmake uh uh work out charters to see after so many years the children have to go back or they\ncan't stay longer. Nothing of this respect was said. Just England wanted to give shelter to these\npeople...to these children to to to uh to save them from oppression and in this respect I am using\na word, when I talked about it before, of of the man I admire so much, Winston Churchill, when\nhe said that even this was England's finest hour, and should recognize that and I think we...to\nrepeat it we should make it a part of the record even here in Washington in the Museum in my\nopinion, because this belongs to the to the to the successful action and reaction of the rescuers.\nUh the last transport which left Berlin was prepared uh in the end of August. It was supposed to\nleave Berlin on September Ist. I was supposed to go because there were certain uh problems\nwhich had come up and which had to be discussed with our people in London. I had my\npassport. I had my protection letter. I had my ten marks in foreign currency. More we were not\nallowed to have, but certainly the the the war fever developed into a pitch and uh then we were\nbombarded from England with a request to try to somehow uh change the date of the departure to\nan earlier date, and it took tremendous efforts to do it because all the children and all the parents\nhad to be notified and things had to rearrange, so anyhow we were able to to to uh uh to uh have\nit, to change the departure date from September Ist to August 29, and I decided then uh on\naccount of the situation not to be the leader of that transport because uh my then wife was in\nBerlin and I and my parents and my sister and I felt responsibility and and I was concerned that\nif something would happen, especially if a war will come, I will be cut off and I I felt that uh uh I\ncould not have done this toward my family and this is the reason why I was caught in Germany.\nThe transport luckily left uh Germany on the 29th, had difficulties to uh get through Holland.\nHolland had already mobilized. Uh there were no boats available at the beginning, but also with\nthe help of our people in Holland in the last minute they found a ferry, ferrying these children to\nEngland and when they arrived in Harwich they they...England had already...was already in a\nstate of a blackout, so they came to England or I would say on the eve on the war. They...I think\nthey landed on the...on September Ist or 2nd, before England had declared war but Germany had\nalready entered...start military operations against Poland. That was the end of the uh of the\nproject. From Germany we had uh been able to get out between six or seven thousand children.\nUh Austria also a couple of thousand. As I said before, we we we didn't have any contact with\nAustria. We were not allowed to corroborate with them, so that was extra, extra operation and\nuh then after that, still a few transports, small transports, left for Denmark, for instance,\n, for training there, but that was all. The the the the children immigration stopped by\nthe beginning of the war and that was the end of that.",
        "Question: What was the total number of children that you got out?",
        "Answer: I said from Germany approximately seven thousand.",
        "Question: Do you remember any of the children particularly?",
        "Answer: Uh, no, because uh uh, you know, don't forget these were thousands of children. I I\nremember certain certain uh children. I I remember the grandchildren of Rabbi who who\nwere taken to England so uh uh but I never met them after the war anymore, but it so happened\nthat not too long ago, uh I addressed a group of children, kinder (ph) they call themselves, in Los\nAngles and a man with grey hair came to me and said, you must have been my uh leader of the\ntransport in February 1939. And I said yes, I do, because that was the first transport I took from\nBerlin to London, and this is true. I certainly didn't recognize him anymore, and uh then at the\nsame evening a lady came to me and said, and you must have been my my leader in April 1939,\nand I told her it must have been approximately on April 18th or so\nand she said, yes, but how do you remember, and I said I remember that when I flew back uh it\nwas Hitler's birthday on April 20th, and the Germans had illuminated the the major uh avenues\nof Berlin, so when I flew back and I had that privilege, the pilot would do us a favor to show the\nspectacle of Berlin, seeing this this sea of of of of of light from the air, and I think I came back\non on April 21st, and and , and by the way uh this was also little little little...1t is not\nrevenge but but call it satisfactions I always had when I landed in in in in in Berlin, the airport at\nthis time was on which was...the airport which was used during the bridge...the air\nbridge, and when I landed there and I met the uh the border police and there was a fellow, you\nknow, almost out of a opera with a with a with a like with a big metal\nshield and all kinds of things put on there, and I showed him my passport and he thought already\nhe had caught one of those who could become his uh customers, and then very very slowly I took\nmy letter out and show it to him and he couldn't quite grasp it and he said one moment please,\nbecause he had to go to his superior to verify that this is genuine and so on and then he let me go,\nto his regret, so that was a certain...call it a certain amount of satisfaction.",
        "Question: Was attempts...were any attempts made to let the children...the parents know that the\nchildren had arrived safely?",
        "Answer: Oh yeah, because uh because as...before the war, there was correspondence and some\nof these children then, and it was one of the first things they did, was that they uh uh asked their\nfoster parents to help them to get the uh the uh the parents out. In certain cases they were\nsuccessful, but I would say between eighty or ninety percent were not, and then you had the\nsituation that when the war broke out, you could only communicate via the International Red\nCross. And uh that took a long time, but it worked at the beginning but then starting with the\ndeportations, these letters didn't arrive anymore from from Germany and the children, you know,\nare quite desperate the events slowly realized that something must have happened, but\nthey became fully aware of the situation only after the end of the war when the truth came out.\nUh you might ask me if I have special...special memories of that. Uh there are two stories I like\nto tell because they are so very interesting and typical. One was uh in the summer of 1939, uh\nwe were advised by the British government through the House and Bloomsbury House\nthat we should...ought to be careful with the import of merchandise which could be used for\ncommercial use. What does it mean? Since uh you couldn't take out funds from Germany...we\nall were restricted to just ten marks...uh certainly parents and other groups which who uh tried to\nget out, took with them whatever they could...uh jewelry if there was the permission to do it, but\nalso uh expensive cameras and and so on and these cameras or uh music instruments and so had\nfound their way into the uh uh British market and the Chamber of Commerce in England had\nbrought it to the attention of the government that they considered it unfair competition because,\nyou know, when the people came there with no money, they sold it for whatever they could get\nfor it. So uh we advised the parents accordingly and tried and hoped that...so on one of these\noccasions when I was the transport leader, we came to Harwich and uh then all of a sudden I\nheard a a voice, my name, Mr. Wolheim, and there was a customs official and I asked him what's\nthe problem, and my English, thank God, was good enough, I mean my schooling which was\ngood enough to communicate with him...uh what's the problem? He said, sir, we have a problem\nhere because we just found that this this boy or this this lad has has a has a...is carrying a violin.\nI said what's wrong with a violin? He said, it's not an ordinary violin. It's a very valuable violin.\nUh certainly it was not a Stratovarious (ph) or or or , but it was a\nvaluable violin, so I said, sir, but most probably the parents gave this to the boy because he liked\nmusic, and uh this was probably his violin before so he took it along, and he took it along\nbecause he liked music. I didn't know that the boy was able to play. So he looked at him and he\nsaid...then in order to save the situation I said, why don't we let him play something so that you\ncan be...uh see that this is something which actually belongs to him. He said that's a good idea.\nAnd that fellow started to play, and you know I was very nervous because I didn't know would it\nsucceed or not, so he started to play and all of a sudden everything around that boy and us\nbecame very quiet and I didn't realize at the first moment what had happened, and then I came to\nto to realize that he had started to play \"God Save the King,\" and because of that, you know, the\ncustoms officials couldn't continue to operate, so I started...tried to stop him but he was playing\nall three stanzas. When he was finished and I felt better and asked, sir, are you now convinced\nthat this boy loves music. He said, oh yes, thank you very much. And the other story I like to\ntell is uh, you know, we were under a very strong regulations to see to it that only children up to\nthe age of seventeen were coming in, and we checked the the uh records carefully and the cards\nback and forth and we thought everything was fine. On one of these transports when I was the\nleader, you know, when when when when you got to uh to uh , Holland and put...and\nthe children boarded the ferry, we put the children to to sleep. They had certain bunks and so\nwe, the the escorts started to work in the lounge in order to pre...prepare for the next morning\nbecause we wanted to be as helpful as possible to the immigration authorities not to have any\nhitchup. So still working on that and uh we were treated very, very nicely by the crew of that\nferry and that was really, in comparison to Germany, was a wonderful thing. In the middle of\nthat a friend of mine, was an escort, came to me and said, Norbert, we have a problem here. I\nsaid what's the problem? He said look at the card. I said what is it. He said that boy is is is\nis...has passed his seventeenth birthday. He's eighteen years old. I said let me said again, and\nsure it was true. So I knew we had a problem. I said let me see...let us ask the boy. So they\nbrought the boy out of his bunk and when he came, I almost...I almost fainted because he had\njust been released from a concentration camp. His hair was shaven and obviously he realized\nthat something was wrong and he was shaking likea_\u2014\u2014_\u2014s*bbonee. So we asked him when were\nyou born, and sure enough, he was eighteen years old. So we went into a huddle with the other\nother members of our escorts and there were two opinions. One was to throw ourselves at the\nmercy of the immigration officer the next morning and say sorry, but that would mean that uh he\nhad to obey his rules and regulations and had eventually had to send him back and if he would\nhave been...1f they would send him back that was the end of him because they would take him\nback into a concentration camp immediately, and there was the other group, and I was one of\nthem, who said well, the only thing is effectively is to say it was a mistake made by the German\npolice, and they entered the the date that they made up...that they changed the...the the date they\nput in was was wrong, but we had to tell the boy that this was it, and made him our ally, so uh he\nrealized that and we said listen, you are not born in this year. You are born one year later. You\nunderstand that. He said very well. And we...also one of our friends who was a teacher said you\nknow what we should do it is we should somehow try to program him that even in the middle of\nthe night we should ask him when were you born, so that when the question will come up in\nEngland that he can...that he will not stutter and and and stumble but will say it. OK. We landed\nin Harwich, all tired, dead tired, uh went through the usual process. All of a sudden I hear, Mr.\nWolheim, kindly see the immigration officer...\nEND OF TAPE 2\n...what's the problem. He said well uh I cannot admit this young man uh because uh he is\neighteen years old and you know very well that uh under the uh rules and regulations adopted he\ncannot be older than seventeen years. So I said well, ask the boy, and when the boy came, you\nknow, and he was shaking and he sort of...hair was shaven...that officer also I mean somehow uh\nfainted. Something had to be done, so uh uh uh uh how do you explain this. I said it must have\nbeen a mistake by the German police. He said but the German police is well known and almost\ninfamous for their accuracy. I said yes, but today under the Nazi regime, they brought in a lot of\npeople who came in just for the party affiliation and not for the efficiency and and bureaucratic\nwork. He said is that so. I said definitely. So he again looked at the card, he looked at this boy\nand there was a moment of silence and and and really I felt...I felt...1 mean this was the moment\nwhere we...a decision had to be made about the life of a human being and then he said to me, sir,\ncould you guarantee that this is a mistake of the German police, and I said by all means. Now he\nknew that I was lying and I knew that he knew that I was lying, but then he took a stand,\nadmitted to the United Kingdom, because he knew that if not, something terrible could have\nhappened to him, so this uh...he saved his life.",
        "Question: We need to stop right here.",
        "Answer: Well, the second story I would like to tell because it had a very interesting, human\naspect is uh under the rules and regulations, uh we were not allowed to bring in children over the\nage of uh seventeen and uh therefore we we not only prepared the uh papers and the lists, we\nchecked carefully everything so that we shouldn't have any problems coming to England. On\none of the transports uh when I was the leader of that group uh uh we had a problem because uh\nusually we uh when we landed in in...when we got to uh , Holland, we put the children\ninto their bunks and the ferries then took us from , Holland, to Harwich which was a trip\nof approximately six hours, sometimes a very rough crossing of the Channel, but for us, for the\nescorts, uh there was no time to relax because we had to prepare our lists and our papers for the\nnext morning for the landing in Harwich and in England in order to make it easy for the\nimmigration, to help them. So we were sitting in a lounge uh doing this kind of work, treated\nnicely by the crew of that ferry to tea and cookies uh and all of a sudden a friend of mine\napproached me and said uh uh...who was also an escort...said there is a problem. I said what's\nthe problem. He said this boy here has passed his seventeenth birthday. He is definitely\neighteen years old. I said I can't believe it. He said look at this. So I looked at this and sure\nenough, found out and had confirmed that he had completed his seventeenth birthday, so the\nquestion was how to handle the situation, and there were two opinions. One was to throw\nourselves at the mercy of the immigration officer and tell him that there was a mistake, an honest\nmistake, and appeal to his uh uh sense of fairness, 1f you want, which certainly uh could\nendanger the boy because uh he could say no, I am not allowed uh to to admit him. But first I\nsaid, let us see the boy who it is. Uh we asked the boy to come down from his bunk, and when I\nsaw him I almost fainted because it turned out that he had just been released from a\nconcentration camp. His head was shaven and he was shaking uh because he realized that\nsomething was wrong. We asked him how old are you and sure enough, the uh date reflected on\nthis card was correct. He was already eighteen years old. So as I told you, for in this\ndeliberation what to do, the group uh...the one group uh thought we should we should inform and\nstick with the date and and let it pass, hoping that the immigration would have mercy on us, and\nthe other group, and I belonged to them, thought it would be easier to say that the Germans had\nmade a mistake when then entered the birth date, but also tell the boy that he has to lie in his own\ninterest, and the boy understood this very well. So we told him that that was...the majority then\ncame to the conclusion they uh try to convince immigration of a mistake. And one of our\nescorts, a teacher, said well, we have to try to program this boy, even during the night have to\nwake him up to tell that he has to confirm that he is one year younger than the paper says. We\ncame to Harwich. Didn't take long. Uh I was called...Mr. Wolheim to immigration office. I\nwant to see you. What's the problem? He said sir, we have a problem, the immigration officer\nsaid, because uh I cannot admit this this lad, he said, because he is over seventeen years. I said I\nI can't believe it. I said ask him, so that boy came, shaking, pale, but when the immigration\nofficer saw him with his shaven head, somehow happened to him...I could feel, I could see it...so\nhe asked me what is your explanation here. I said uh the police made a mistake and he said well,\nthe German police is not known for easily making mistakes, and my reaction was to tell, well the\npolice is not the same police you are knowing from the old days. Many Nazis just on account of\nparty affiliation have entered the service and they are not of the same quality as before, and I'm\nfully convinced that is so what the boy said, that he is seventeen years old, so he looked at me\nand he looked at the boy for quite some time and I...1t was minutes uh uh just sounded like\neternity and then he turned to me and said sir, can you guarantee the fact that the German police\nhas a mis...has made a mistake, and immediately I answered yes sir. I can do it. So he knew that\nI was lying, and I knew that he knew that I was lying. He looked again at the boy, took a stand,\nand stamped admitted to the United Kingdom and in this way he saved a human life.",
        "Question: Can you tell us now what happened to you when the war broke out?",
        "Answer: Well, when the war broke out we uh we uh uh...when I say we I mean it means also\nmyself...lived with the expectation that they might do something, the Nazis, take us into to labor\ncamps ___, being afraid that uh we might endanger the German war efforts, who knows. All\nkind of crazy things were possible, but but nothing happened. I continued my work uh for the uh\ncentral office in in Berlin, for the Central Jewish Office in Berlin, for a certain while. We had\nstill a couple of small transports going to Denmark, to the __ center, but this fizzled out soon,\nand then I was asked to take over the administration of the vocational training uh schools, uh the\nthe...this organization uh had set up, especially outside of Berlin...carpentry, plumbing, metal\nwork and so on. These were very good schools uh uh and let...by Jewish and non-Jewish\nteachers. Helped very much uh children to acquire vocational training, and so I also had to travel\nto a certain extent in Germany which was not easy at this time but I still...1t was it was possible.\nAnd uh then uh uh in in the summer of '41, uh in the course of the uh events and especially uh\nafter uh uh...after uh Germany was successful in Poland and in France and in in in Norway, and\nhad taken over all these countries and occupied them, uh there started what we called the the\nfinal solution also in Germany, especially in Berlin, and uh then I came to the conclusion that uh\nit's better to stay away from work in the central office because there was nothing we could do\nany more for our for our Jewish people, and I had the the feeling and I want to be careful in this\nrespect, that we more or less uh would be in the danger to be more helpers to the Nazis than than\nto do what what was necessary to do in the Jewish interest, though I realized fully that all these\nleaders, devoted men, most of them had become martyrs, tried to do their best to save Jewish\nlives, but uh uh there was nothing anymore to be done, so I decided to to become separated from\nthe work for the for the rest...___ call them...of Jews in Germany and I uh uh had to uh report to\nan office which distributes uh distributed uh Jewish workers in in...for forced labor. In other\nwords, the uh Jews who had lost their jobs and who could not work any more in in in offices and\nso they were drawn into all kinds of work, digging work, transport work, uh uh factory work,\nwhatever it was, because also on account of the uh disappearing manpower of of Germany, they\nneeded us for this. That's what we thought. So uh I was uh uh...I reported that I was a welder, so\nI was uh then uh sent to a firm, to a German firm in Berlin uh which had a Jewish group which\nmeans at this time uh Jews could not work as individuals. Jews could only work in groups and\nthe people who had taken on these groups had to provide special facilities, special toilets and so,\nso that Jews and non-Jews didn't mix. And uh this group I I joined certainly not voluntarily but\nbut uh the special problem was that this was a factory which was located in the eastern part of\nBerlin, uh the northeastern part of Berlin. I was living at this time on the west and it was a long\nway to the factory and I had to get up between four thirty and five o'clock in the morning in\norder to make it on time. Uh this was also the time when the first uh air raids started of the\nBritish air uh air force against Berlin, so uh during the so-called alarms, when I was at home we\nwere...had to take shelter in a basement. Jews were separated there also from from non-Jews and\nlater we realized that these basements certainly didn't give any kind of protection, but this is\nactually what was done. But also in that factory, uh Jews were were pressed into service uh for\nfor as...not air raid wardens but uh uh uh a group to uh to uh fight fires or whatever it 1s if\nsomething should happen, so that uh very often I didn't come home uh uh for for almost two\ndays, didn't know what was going on at home. Uh in in in November '39, by the way, uh my\nwife and I had our child...a boy was was born and uh since we had not uh...yeah...I forgot to tell\nthat certainly at the beginning of the war, Jews were not allowed anymore to have a telephone or\nhave radio, so I was not...was not was not able to communicate with them, so uh so uh uh that\nmeans very often, especially after an air raid and if it was a heavy air raid, I didn't know what\nhappened to my family and my family didn't know what happened to me, and uh then in the\nsummer of '41, there started what we called the final solution. Uh we...in Berlin the head of the\nJewish community was called to the Gestapo and he was told that (clearing throat)...excuse\nme...that for a thousand people uh apartments should be made available uh and uh the uh the\npeople should uh should assemble in a synagogue uh and not be accommodated at another place.\nNow I think I overlooked one thing, that uh also in September '41 there started...laws were\npromulgated to force Jews to wear a yellow badge, and from this time on...that was September\n'41. By the way, it was also the time when no immigration was possible from Germany\nanymore. Even during the war in the first part, there was still certain possibilities to come to\nAmerica via Portugal or later after the campaign in Poland, via Siberia, by train through\n, but in September '41 this this was over and uh what I'm also sorry I forgot to say that\nwe tried very hard but the German...the American Consulate uh with which I was registered uh\nasked us very late to uh to uh to uh get our papers, our affidavits, but that was not easy to get in\nAmerica and also the the Consulate stopped very early to process applications. It also set\nconditions which were impossible. More can be read about this in the book of David\nabout the abandonment of the Jews. The American bureaucracy at this time was not very helpful\nto save people it could have saved. Now uh in connection with the with the promulgation of the\nlaws about the about the yellow badge, there uh other restrictions started. We were not allowed\nanymore to uh to use certain streets. We were not allowed to uh to uh to buy and to go shopping,\nonly at certain hours. We certainly...we couldn't see a movie or our theater and uh uh any...we\nwere were also...we had to to place the Star of David at the outside of our of our doors in the in\nthe apartments. So life became became became more and more uh difficult, almost impossible.\nWe still tried to uh get to...I, for instance, saw friends if possible and we uh we uh...and my\nparents lived in the easter part of Berlin and we, as I said before, in the western part and certainly\nmy parents were very much interested and also the parents of my wife, to see our boy but uh\nwhen we were not allowed to uh to uh use the public transportation, we even walked that way\nwhich was two and a half or three hours. Now at the beginning we did it. Later we did it under\nthe protection of darkness which was dangerous, uh uh hiding the Star and then at least to give\nour parents to see to see us and and the boy (clearing throat) because uh uh communications over\nthe telephone and so didn't exist. Uh in in the course of of of that time, the restrictions became\nbecame became became more uh rigid and also then uh to come back to that order to the heads of\nthe Jewish community, not to make room for the people who had to uh make their apartments\navailable, to provide them with other shelter...there started the first deportations to the east. Uh\nwe were not fully aware what...and I I uh uh uh tried to get information wherever I could, but uh\ndon't forget that at this time you had no public press anymore. Uh uh the press was completely\ncontrolled. There were no letters to the editor or free speech or free writing and so and certainly\nthe press did not report about anything like that so 1t were mostly rumors you had follow in in\norder to find out what was going on, but the deportations started first with the with the\ndeportations of elderly people who were not uh in the in the...part of the forced labor program,\nbecause they considered them as uh as disposable and so transports went to first to to the ghetto\nin Lodz, or what they called, what they called, the Germans, and other places like\nRiga, Kovno, Minsk, and some of these transports, as we know from from from information\nlater, never arrived. I uh uh uh...it's difficult to say how did I react. I know we were exposed to\na development over which we had no control. I realized that uh all my attempts to save myself\nand my family, or to save my family and myself had been in vain and, therefore, we we had to\ntake whatever, whatever...I can...only had to hope that uh the military operations would result in\na defeat of Germany and that only in the course of that defeat we could hope to be free again, so\nthat means all our...1t was my thinking about survival was to see that that uh Germany was\ndefeated. Uh certainly there were, especially at the beginning, uh many of our friends and\nsomehow we still tried to meet and exchange uh information about the military situation and so\nwe were convinced that Germany was invincible, and there was not only of...then when you read\ntoday the the reports which came out from the father of of Joe Kennedy, he also thought more or\nless that uh uh uh the western world 1s...and Russia is defeated and that uh Germany will be will\nbe victorious. Uh but we uh...I pers....personally must say uh I was a great believer in in in\nwhatever Churchill said. Not whatever, but but his way of of telling the the people, you know,\nwe will we will never surrender. We will fight at the beaches. We will fight wherever we...we\nwill never surrender. This gave me hope. Also my expectation that one day uh public opinion in\nin America, which was rather isolationist, might change and become aware that Germany is not\nonly a danger for Europe but also for for for America in the long run, so uh and also that that\nespecially after Germany uh attacked Russia, that there was a certain parallel for anybody who\nknew history, that when Napoleon tried to uh to uh to fight Russia, that was end of his of his\nEmpire, so I I was convinced that uh in spite of all the the military might Germany had\ndeveloped, that uh uh it could not last. The question only was how long? And in this respect\nalso I...how did did Iknow. We were cut off from the world. We we couldn't see uh uh any any\nnews objectively. Whatever we saw in the headlines...and by the way we were not even allowed\nto to buy a paper. A neighbor of mine brought me a paper once in a while, but that was all\nregulated and uh only the suc...the success was reported but defeat were not. But uh\nthen when I was in in this in this labor gang, if I may call it, and uh the attacks by the air force\nbecame stronger after Hitler had proclaimed and ___ had proclaimed already that the British\nwere defeated. It gave me no hope, and my wife also the same way, that in the long run uh uh uh\nthere must come a turn, and uh then uh especially when when when the military uh events uh\nchanged the whole situation by the defeat of Rommel in Africa and especially after the defeat of\nStalingrad. Uh this gave me a tremendous hope and gave all of us a tremendous hope, but this\nwas a time already when one transport after the other left, for instance, Berlin, and the question\nwas how long will it...when when when will when will the sword come down on us. Uh I had uh\nuh in this labor gang in which...where we were working, there was one member, a Jewish fellow\nwho worked with us, who was uh what we called a privileged Jew. That means he didn't have to\ncarry the the yellow badge, the Star of David, because he was married to a non-Jewess and their\nchildren were educated as as uh Christians, so he had still the right to uh to keep a radio, and\nwith him we could arrange...I say with him, with some friends in that labor gang, that during the\nnight he should get up and certainly that was something which was uh...the threat of death\npenalty if he would be caught...to listen to BBC London and and and to the German service to\nfind out what the situation was. He did it under the condition that we would provide him in the\nblack market with with coffee because he said when he had to get up during the night and he\ncouldn't find sleep immediately, in the morning he was dead tired so he needs real coffee in order\nto survive the day. This we could do. And I I...I said I was one of them who was instrumental in\nthis, so every morning when we came, he whispered to us what he had heard during the night,\nand in this respect uh we, or I was fully familiar with the progress of uh the Russian army in\nStalingrad and of the other defeat of the 6th German army under __ in Stalingrad and\nespecially when when when it came to an end with the with the loss of approximately three\nhundred thousand German soldiers, so the question came, how long will they be able? Would\nthat mean the end of it and how fast would would the end came. Uh but uh uh on the other hand,\nuh the the the Nazis, in spite of of uh these military developments, continued with their\ndeportations. In December 1942, my parents were deported. Uh I was...on the way home I tried\nto to see them. Then I was told that uh uh the Gestapo had come, had taken them on short notice.\nUh later I found out that they were in a collection center which was in the former Jewish old age\nhome. I was able to get them some food, prayer book and so on, but then in a short time they\nwere...this uh uh home was was cleaned out and later then I found out that my parents, blessed\nmemory, were were in one of the first transports which went from Berlin directly, directly to\nAuschwitz, and certainly in Auschwitz uh uh uh they they obviously got murdered the the first\nuh moment when they arrived.",
        "Question: How did you feel when they were taken?",
        "Answer: When they were taken? Certainly I felt lost and and and call it depressed, but still I\nmust say my my power of resistance was still there because I had...together with my wife, we\nhad...call it we made a pledge, call it an oath, whatever it 1s...that we will not try...we will not\ngive in, that whatever the circumstances, we will try to to to hold out. And and and uh uh though\nwe we have no means to communicate with the outside world, with relatives and friends left in\nthe western world, and so being alone and and but still uh this spark of life was still there, that uh\nin spite of everything that we will try to to remain alive, last not least to tell the tale, to tell our\nstory later. Still we didn't know at this time about Auschwitz, so when I came to the apartment\nand and a neighbor of my parents told me, told us, certainly I I] was I was shocked. More than\nshocked, and and and it was almost...uh it didn't sink in immediately, that this...that I would\nnever see them again, and that this this was the last...when they were when they were taken\naway, we couldn't manage to see them in the old age home, because this was closely guarded by\nthe by the SS, so uh it didn't occur to me immediately, but certainly it affected me, but I said to\nmyself I do not like to to that this bad news, the terrible news should overcome you or should\nshould should paralyze me. I would like...I would I would try whatever I can to survive, to\nsurvive this monster, and uh uh I think this 1s the spirit which which certainly I've tried to carry\nforward and also later, so uh when when...that was in December uh and then I think it was early\nin February, after the defeat in in in Stalingrad, made a speech to which I listened\ninofficially, because as I told you, we were one of the last to have a radio...when he said well, uh\nuh certainly Stalingrad could not deny that this was some kind of a defeat, but now uh it...the\ntime has come for the totalitarian...total war and uh the time has come also to uh to uh uh make a\nfinal uh...to to get even with the with the domestic enemy, with the internal enemy, and he used a\ncertain expression which is , which means now uh people arise and storm uh uh\nuh...start in other words to uh to uh...like like uh I think it was as a parallel in history like uh in\nParis in 1870 when the the ___ I think they call it...to to have an uprising of the people in order\nto save Hitler and the the regime. And uh soon thereafter, and I was still working in that labor\ngang and it was still , and though America had entered already the war, uh we didn't feel\nthe effect of it immediately because they had to get installed in England and they had started\nwith the first air raids, but not towards Berlin. Uh and then my sister was also supposed to be\ndeported but since she was a (clearing throat) skilled stenographer and writer, they took her out\nto do secretarial service in the collection center, so she was able to help me to get something to\nmy parents there. Uh and then we were...uh one transport after the other left Berlin. Some\ncards...post cards, interesting enough, arrived from the people who had managed to throw post\ncards out of their wagons and none of them certainly knew exactly where they were going. We\nheard rumors about uh...and I heard rumors about uh uh events in Poland, about the the attack,\nabout the ghettos, about the murder uh uh...the uh killing actions in in these areas, but don't\nforget (clearing throat) that all this could not be confirmed. This was just to the same extent that\nI asked my friend who listened to to to the radio, to BBC, what does BBC London say, and he\nsaid uh nothing. There is a certain uh uh uh appeal or certain address which was delivered by\nwhere he indicated that uh Jews were taken away from France and so, but no hard facts\nare available, and uh I also uh still had contact with my people of the of the Jewish organization,\nand when I had a chance I saw the head of that, at this time was Paul Epstein (ph) and we\nexchanged some more information, but all the information only said that there is a turn, but but\nwe came to the conclusion (clearing throat) for the Jewish situation in Germany, it anyhow might\ncome too late. And uh uh then in in uh at the end of February, early in March, uh from one day\nto the other, Berlin was was...there there started...there was...came the end of the so so-called\nfinal solution. The SS, interesting enough, the elite SS called the of Hitler,\noccupied in the morning all factories where Jews were working in these groups, and certainly for\nthem it was easy to get to to them, because they were working in groups. I for one reason or the\nother had been advised the night before...said stay home. You never know what's going on, and I\nwas staying home, and uh then uh a neighbor came running and said I just heard they have taken\naway my husband. He was working there and there and don't know where he 1s. It's terrible.\nWhat is your...what what what can you do? There's nothing. You just have to to wait and see.\nSo I tried to read and to to to to even write a letter to a friend in Sweden, because with Sweden\nthere was still...since it was neutral uh you could have still uh an exchange of letters though it\nwas censored, so uh uh and then uh uh in the afternoon of that day, two uh uh policemen who\nwere members of the Gestapo came and told us that uh uh we we are under custody and we uh\nwe uh in ten minutes we should leave. Now in connection with all these transports, my then wife\nuh had prepared a knapsack with all kinds of things we thought would be helpful when we would\ngo to the east to some kind of a labor camp and so what we expected, and had some some uh\nunderwear and some books and the bible and and a chess set and so on, and certainly things for\nthe for the boy, and uh had that ready so in order to grab it whenever whenever the occasion\nwould arise. And uh as I say in that afternoon they came, and gave us ten minutes and my son\nwas sleeping, so we managed somehow to...we all, after all, spoke the same language, to tell\nthem after all we have to get him ready and should give us some time and uh with some\nhesitation they said alright, we'll wait. To talk to them was almost impossible. Uh uh I tried but\nuh I knew it was dangerous because for these were people who were fanatic Nazis and and and\nthey took...uh take out their wrath against you on the spot. They had the right to kill you on the\nspot and nobody...nobody would would take them uh to court for that. So uh then we took our\nknapsacks and we took our son and and and then we went down. We were living in an in an\napartment in the back of a big building and uh uh when we came down we saw a truck uh\nsurrounded by SS guards with rifles. It certainly was not a pleasant...pleasant uh uh moment,\nbecause we certainly didn't know what was going to happen. And uh then we were...when we\nwere ascended this truck and saw other Jewish people because they all had the star and they all\nhad the same destiny that their husbands had been taken but uh uh uh the...since they had the\naddress of these people at home, they were picking up the people in their in their homes. Those\nthey didn't found in the factories, they found at home and then we were cruising around in in in\nin Berlin. It was in March, early in March. It was cold. It was...it was raining. It was miserable\nand then they stopped and cruising and we were absolutely uncertain, but I had the wonderful\nfeeling at least my wife and my son was with me. The others were in that unfortunate situation\nthat they were separated from their families and uh also I must say my then wife was in a rather\ngood mood and let's say whatever will come, will come, as long as we can stay together, and uh\nthen we were taken to a to a big place in the middle of the night. Don't forget that Berlin was\ncompletely blacked out on account of the air raid sit...of the air situation, and uh then from that\nbig place we were transferred...transferred to another place uh where also my parents had been\nbefore. It's a collection point. Also in between we were released for a day or two to our\napartment again uh uh and we could do something because we had uh red arm bands to help uh\nto to be...to bring some food to a place, but that was only very minor. There was\nnothing...nothing really where you could say uh you can help people. We were all exposed to\nthe same...to the same danger. So uh uh and then uh uh again we were we were called in and we\nwere taken in to that place in in the old age home, and on March 11, 1943, we were we were\n(clearing throat) made part of the transport. Interesting enough, two days before we\nbecame...and I became the witness of the first major air raid of the American air force against\nBerlin. As long as the British air force came, certainly I mean they had tried what they do, but\nthey are...the the damage they were they were inflicting on on on the on the buildings in Berlin\nwere rather minor, though they were there I mean and it was...you never knew where they would\nhit and what would be hit, and we were part of that, but when the American bombers came, I\nmean there was...there for the first time I realized that was a massive attack and you'll see when\nwe when we uh looked around that Berlin was really burning, and we had to hope that the\nrailway uh uh would be destroyed, but that didn't happen. And then on the 11...uh March 11th\nwe were made part of of that transport. Uh we were taken together with...I think we were all in\nall a thousand people out of that uh collection point. Men...wo...men, women, children, elderly,\nyoung...and uh my sister was with me, with us and also luckily some of our friends from the\nyouth movement and we tried to stick together. We were uh shipped to a freight yard within\nBerlin and there were forced to board one of these cattle cars, uh approximately I think a hundred\npeople in a car, so we could could hard...we couldn't lie. We could hardly sit...mostly stand.\nThere was just a hole for for for...there was a hole in the car for ventilation (clearing throat) and\none bucket there for for hygiene purposes and uh...but still I would say that I, in spite of that, and\nalso my then wife, had a feeling well, we'll take it...we can take it, because none of us uh was\naware what was going to happen. Uh we didn't know where we were going. Uh I only noticed\non my watch that exactly at four o'clock in the afternoon this train left and was moving east,\nbecause I was familiar with the geography of Berlin and Germany, so we know we were were uh\ngoing to the east, and uh as a matter of fact, uh since we were together with other other friends,\nin order to to not kill times but to somehow alleviate the situation within ourselves somehow\nstarted to sing Jewish songs we had uh learned uh uh in the in the youth movement.\n. How nice 1s it to to be with friends, under those conditions. It's absurd today,\nyou know, but you see this was still part of the of the mood we were in, and I remember that also\nmy wife also wrote some of these cards which were very safe because you could throw them\nthrough the hole and sometimes they were picked up and people uh then mailed them. Uh it was\nFriday night and uh when it became dark, interesting enough, one of the ladies there uh aware of\nthis was a Friday night, uh took out some candles she had prepared, was lighting the candles, was\nbless...blessing the candles, and and and uh expressing the prayers, you know, to welcome the\nSabbath, and you know, the...later very often thought about this, you know, what...how how\nabsurd life can be that, you know, here there was a group, just a death wagon of a hundred\npeople, most probably ninety percent of them did not live to see the next evening anymore, but\nstill riding in that car, they were blessing God and welcoming uh the Sabbath, in that mobile uh\nprison going from Berlin to we still didn't know where. So we traveled all night and uh then I\nrealized in the morning that we were going via Breslau (ph) in this area and uh uh came to Upper\nSalasia and uh then uh in the afternoon, almost twenty-four hours later, we uh we stopped in a\nkind of a railway station uh and there I saw for the first time written the name Auschwitz. I was\nnot aware what Auschwitz was in spite of the fact that I had uh uh listened to to to BBC London,\nhad tried to get all the information I could in Berlin. We knew about uh ghettos in Riga. We\nknew about the ghetto in in in Lodz. Auschwitz...I didn't know what it was. And uh obviously\nalso at this time uh uh neither BBC London nor any other information uh sources, had any any\nconcrete idea. Auschwitz was new. So uh uh when the train stopped uh they they they the doors\nwas opened and we were all somehow stiff and so it was a cold night and so and so, but we were\ndriven out. There were...there were SS guards with the with the uh uh uh sticks and uh yelling\nlike animals, and uh beating people out of the cars. Uh there I also saw when we left our uh\nwagon that two of our people who were with us or three had committed suicide, so uh uh\nbecause they probably...it was it was too much for them, and then outside we were we were\nassembled on a platform. Uh we were ordered to leave all our uh belongings there, all our\nknapsacks we had prepared carefully and whatever it was remained there, and then they ordered\nus to uh line up in different groups, men, uh women with children, and women. And this was the\nmoment when when when I was separated from my wife and my child, and this is where my wife\nthen said well, this is the moment I have...I was...I will be...I was afraid of. As long as we were\ntogether...and sure enough uh uh this was the last uh uh day I have seen her and my child. We\nwere lining up and uh uh there stand a man in a in a very elegant SS uniform. Later I came to\nunderstand it was Dr. Mengele, and uh when he approached he asked only how old are you,\nwhat's your profession, and then he directed people to the left or to the right with his thumb.\nAnd he asked me how old. What's your profession? I certainly did not say that I was an\nadministrator or a law student. I said I was a welder, and he directed me to one group. I had lost\ntrack of my wife and my son, but then also what I saw and what was completely new to me was\nall of a sudden women in SS uniform with with their pistol holsters, you know, where they...the\npistol uh dangling, and they also prepare...behaved like animals, and they uh uh uh were\nespecially busy with the women with children and the elderly and then we saw uh and I saw\npeople in in a certain uniform I had never seen before, with stripped clothing and peculiar kind of\na of a of a cap, and uh so then trucks uh were were driving up and one group of people,\nespecially the women with children and the elderly were put on one truck and we still had to wait\nand uh then this truck left and it so happened that my wife and my my my son had...they were\nsitting or were standing at the end of that truck, and my wife was somehow waving to me. And\nthat was the last I've seen of her. We had to wait and then were were were pressed into another\ntruck, and though we thought it was full already they they uh they still pushed I don't know how\nmany people into...it was less...1t was worse than sardines. Uh and there certainly everywhere\nwere SS guards. We tried to uh to uh to uh speak to them, but interesting enough they hardly\nspoke German because they were what they called which means ethnic Germans, but\ntheir main major language was Polish, but they had volunteered obviously for the SS and did this\nkind of duty. So we couldn't find out anything from them and then we were driven away from\nthat railway station and passed by a tremendous uh uh area of industrial buildings. I don't know\nhow many buildings we could see that was under construction. We couldn't understand what it\nwas. We didn't know...after all, we still didn't know where we were. And uh then after having\npassed this area of industrial buildings, uh we entered...we...all of a sudden I saw a a camp\nsurrounded by by barbed wire, with watch towers and SS guards with machine uh guns, machine\npistols, and when we drove into this I said to my friends who were standing next to me from the\nyouth movement and luckily we were still sticking together... may God help us to get out of here\nalive. So uh that's the moment when when we had arrived and I had arrived in Auschwitz. What\nhappened to my wife and my son I did not know. The others didn't know what happened to their\npeople, so and then we were ordered uh to descent this truck and and and uh were driven into to\nto some barracks and were ordered to undress completely, only to keep our our shoes, our glasses\ncertainly, our belts and uh then the SS ordered us to take off our rings, our watches,\nwhatever...and uh uh then we were were...I together with these other people and we were\napproximately I would say two hundred people in this in this group, from Berlin...uh were were\nled into a shower. We were not quite clear what what it was. It was cold. It was miserable but\neven later when we...when the water came down although it was cold it was somehow, it\nwas...believe it or not some kind of a relief after this trip that we hadn't eaten. We had not...we\nwere not in in very good shape, but in all tense (ph)...I I remember that everything that I...I said\nat this time to myself, register in your mind whatever is going on. With God's help one day you\nmight be be be called to give evidence about that, so somehow I I tried and not to forget and uh\nthen we...after that...1n that...then we were in that shower. A man came also with a uniform, with\na stripped uniform, and we asked him who are you and he said I'm from Hamburg. I am a\npolitical prisoner, a Jew but a political prisoner. I have taken part in the uh fight of the of the\nSpanish Republicans against Franco. I was caught there and and and and delivered by the\nSpanish to Germany. I am in the camp already four years. You have arrived in Auschwitz. The\ncamp here is named Buna. You will be working for a big factory where they are trying to\nproduce artificial rubber and it is under the under the administration of , and\nfor us had a special name. It was like DuPont in...or British British Chemical and so it was a\ntremendous firm. It's stocks were widely held, also by Jewish stockholders, so this is what you\nare going to do, and we asked what's about our chil...wives and children. He said don't ask about\nthem because uh I can't tell you. We don't ask questions. We are here already. You are lucky\nthat you came now. We, the old guards, the old timers, called old-timers are here already for\nyears. We have gone through Buchenwald and Dachau and Saxonhausen and now Auschwitz, so\ntry to make your best. Try to be strong. Try to take it. Otherwise you are lost, and uh then after\nthe shower was over, we we were given the same kind of uh dresses these people had. It was not\nfitting, you know...it was terrible. And some caps also with the same stripes, and then we were\nled to one of the barracks we had seen there in that camp and a man who called himself the elder,\nthe block elder, blockaltester, block elder received us. He was a political prisoner who was uh\nallied with the communist party and so and had been caught very early, so he had already seven\nor eight years of imprisonment behind him, and he said I want you to be clean. I want you to\n_____ and so and we were then given our our beds, which means 1n this barracks there were rows\nof bunks, three tiers and there was...there was a thin blanket and the so-called mattress was a\nstraw sack and uh and uh we were given to understand that this is our place where we can sleep.\nThere was no place to leave your things. There was...there was uh no place uh to rest, to sit\ndown, so uh...and then I realized that uh...the events were so fast and so over-bearing and so\nshocking that it was not possible for me to fully analyze what was going on, but uh I realized one\nthing that certainly uh I I...that the Nazis had tried to dehumanize me by taking away all my\nprivate...my most private things, my hair, my clothing, to make me a number and that I was\ndegraded to to become a slave, that I was a prisoner, that uh I was not any more able to do what I\nwanted to do, that I had to uh follow uh orders...how nonsensical they were...and uh that that all\nthis in the name, I said, of German civilization...I was puzzled. And also uh especially then\ncame a little bit...got used to this...came to the realization that there was no way out because uh\ncertainly the camp was was was surrounded by more than one fence of barbed wire, was\nelectrically loaded, that to run away would be impossible and even if so, 1n a Polish area...1t was\nstill a Polish population where you don't know the language...was hopeless, so that the only hope\nwhich was there is to to live to to see uh that Germany was militarily defeated, and had\nsurrendered.",
        "Question: I think we should stop here... . We're at a good stopping point.\nEND OF TAPE 3\n...1 had to get out and uh one of the first things you learn in a concentration camp...one of the first\nthings was to to make your beds, and the Germans, the Nazis, in this respect uh they had an\nobsession for for for orderly uh bed building. It had to be done in a mathematical, straight\nfashion and since I I had the bunk on top I was the first to have to do it because other...the\npeople...and I had to stand on the on the rim of the of the second tier and the first tier, so,\ntherefore, I had to finish it first and then the others could do it. Now that was a thing, and then\nwe were...I was treated to my first uh breakfast there which consisted of an awfully tasting coffee\nand a piece of bread and and that was all. Oh, a little piece of marg...of sausage or so...I don't\nknow, but anyhow this first day was a day when when we were registered and and and also again\npeople came and asked what was your profession and I stick...was sticking to my lie that all my\nlife I have been nothing but a welder, because people had told me who had been in in a camp\nbefore in the action that the Nazis despised tremendously any people looking somewhat\nintellectually or or professional or so the worst were the were the lawyers and and and when they\nfound a lawyer they really...they they mistreated them very very badly. So I said I was a welder\nand then we got we got...uh I got my number, which was 107984. Uh we had to...I had to...I got\nsome patches of of of stuff of linen and and had to to sew it on my uniform, and also then uh\nsomebody came and tattooed this number on my left arm, so uh that means I I I...and I still have\nthat...uh which means that you were completely uh uh...you were...you have become a number\nand one of the first things I said to myself 1s I would like to become not a number. I had a\nnumber but I'd like not to become a number, so still there was that spirit of resistance if possible.\nAnd then on that first day also I I went through something which never uh uh experienced\nbefore, what they call appell. The Germans and the Nazis, they are in this respect and especially\nat this time, they had obstinent appell, you know, and counting was one of their hobbies. Uh and\nthey had it at least twice a day, so we were all led to a big place, a big square and there we had to\nline up...our block...in in rows of five and had to wait until an SS man came, and there\nwere...were the head of the camp, the SS that was...the SS stormfurher which means captain. Uh\nsince it was cold, he had the privilege of wearing a nice fur coat, uh a military fur coat, so we\nwere counted again and again and again, and uh uh then uh the next day, it was the first day\nwhen when when I was I was uh uh commanded, after the appell in the morning, to go to a\ncertain kommando they called it, working...working uh squad or working platoon, and uh the\nnewcomers had no choice. They were attached to a very special one. I only later I found this\none of the kommands to uh to wear us down, to grind us down, uh which we called , the\nthe killing...killing kommando, the murder kommando, uh number four. So then we uh we we\nwe we walked out, again in military order, uh always five because that was easier to count. We\nwere counted at the uh square before. We were counted when we marched out and at this time\nthe SS uh uh guards were walking with us left and right, so uh in other words each kommando\nhad so and so many SS guards attached to them, and uh it was quite a....quite a distance we\nwalked and uh...well, I was still able to do that. Of course I had still a certain strength in me, and\nthen uh uh then we were...we entered the factory area where where you had these\nnum...numerous buildings there under construction. Uh streets were not completed. There was a\nlotofmud, __ soil, especially since it was a cold morning, it was all flour (ph) and we\nhad...we had just the this very thin kind of dress and and and it was not easy and uh then I was\nled together with the others uh to a certain place where we had to unload uh uh uh railway\nwagons of metal and cement and so on. And this was done mostly uh not in an ordinary way, but\nrunning. I mean metal...you cannot...big beams you cannot transport by running but but for\ninstance when you have a sack of cement, then they wanted you to run because it had to be fast.\nAnd also for the first time I became acquainted with an institution I didn't know uh uh before,\nthat each kommando had a a a inmate leader called kapo. Where this term originated I don't\nknow. I have never found out. It comes from Italy somehow. Uh but they called it kapo and it\nhas been...had entered the the language of the concentration camps, so you had a kapo as the\nleader of the...and he had certain foremans to to to help him, especially in bigger kommands,\nbigger bigger bigger kommandos, but then you had the SS also so they all then uh uh were\naround us to to watch what we are doing and how we are doing it, that 1t went fast enough and so\non. And uh I remember that on that first day uh when we were when we were doing this kind of\nwork and I had done part of it in Berlin so it was not completely new to me...I I saw that one\nJewish fellow of another kommando uh throw himself in front of a locomotive of a small uh\nengine to commit suicide so that was the first that I I saw there uh and it was the first which was\nfollowed by many many more. So uh when it came to uh to uh to uh the so-called lunch break,\nsome trucks came with some watery soup which was called buna (ph) soup because the name of\nthat factory was Buna and it was provided by the firm which they think was a tremendous uh\ntremendous gain for us. It was very often absolutely stinking and and and consisted of nothing\nbut just water uh uh with some some vegetable remnants or so. It's awful. And so uh and\nsince...and also we had...there was...yeah...one of our possessions was uh a bowl which you\nalways had to carry with us. That was your only possession and a spoon. When we we got the\nsoup, we couldn't sit down and so it all has to be...had to eaten standing up and then after a short\nwhile the the work continued up to the very end of the day. So at the beginning...I mean it was\nhard but but but I also considered bearable, but then, you know, not a couple of days later...was\nearly in March, uh terrible rain storms hit the area and the area became muddier than before so\nthe work became more difficult, especially when you have to carry these cement bags. That was\nnot...the paper was not of the best quality so they very often broke and when you mix cement\nwith water, you know, it it becomes very hard caked and it was setting also on your clothing and\nso...now the other problem was that I couldn't change...change the clothing. I I I...there was no\nway to clean yourself. There was so-called washroom but the washroom was there for hundreds\nof people. To get to the faucets was almost impossible, so to keep clean was one of the most\ndifficult things, and also there was always the danger uh that you you would acquire lice which\nthen would would uh result in typhus. So how to keep clean I don't know, but anyhow that that\nwas one of the problems and also, you know, you certainly you didn't need a a a comb anymore\nbecause you had no hair, but you even didn't also didn't have a towel. You had...really you had\npractically...you were devoid of any things uh uh which makes fundamentals of of life. Who\nspeaks about about books and paper and and...it didn't exist, simply did not exist. You were\nreally uh a slave. You were rented out by the SS to . I was, therefore, a slave working uh\nuh uh for the benefit of the SS for and I was aware of the fact that I was allowed to\nlive only as long as I as I was able to do this kind of work. The moment I became weak or the\nmoment I would I would uh contract any any illnesses and so that was the end, so therefore I I\nalso tried very hard to uh to keep myself clean but, of course, I mean especially when you had\nthese rains and you came back in the evening and the the uh the uh so-called uniform was was\ncovered with with the cement dust. You went to bed and you were you were wet. Everything\nwas wet. So how to sleep under those conditions I don't know, but but, you know, obviously\nhuman beings can can can can can can tolerate a lot. Uh many of our people...I wouldn't say\nmany...some of our people simply said enough is enough and uh I remember distinctly that that\nuh uh starting the third or fourth day uh certain of the people who were also in our transport and\nwere still in that same kommando, simply when we were walking out of the camp, ran what they\ncalled __ so the person had ran away, tried to ran away and then the SS started to shoot\nimmediately and shooting him to death. Uh and the SS loved to do that because for any for any\nvictim I think they were paid at this time twenty or twenty-five marks and a bottle of of of\ncognac and so on and a day or two of rest. And I remember for instance we were walking uh one\none morning. It was the fourth or fifth morning. A father was walking with his son and the\nfather then when we were out of the camp, gave the rest of his bread and whatever he had to his\nson and said uh uh I don't need it any more, gave it to his son, ran out in order to be shot, in the\npresence of his son. And uh uh uh this I saw. These first days uh especially became the the\nworst I would say in my life and very often when we came home, you know, we...after you came\nback from the factory, you were counted again. You were counted when you entered the camp.\nYou were counted again in the evening, and uh this sometimes could last uh hours and hours\nbecause Germany was the place where where let us say where where scientists work on\nmathematics and make progress, but these people were not good in math, and very often when\nthe when the when the numbers didn't didn't didn't jive, we had to wait and and and and they did\nnot uh let us uh let us go before everything was was just just right to the last man, so it happened,\nfor instance, I remember that one evening of the fourth or the fifth, one of the men of my\ntransport just collapsed in front of us. Uh we he was a cantor, a man I knew well because I had\nattended his service. Weisman (ph) was his name. A wonderful, powerful voice, and and and\nand well, highly-educated man. He collapsed and when the appell was taken and the SS man\ncame and kicked him with his with his foot and he could hardly move and uh then when the\nappell was...when the roll call was over, uh we decided we had to take him to the so-called uh\nemergency..the krackenbaugh, the hospital and uh it was not easy for us to carry him but we did\nit because we thought it's the only way to help him, and then on the way, which was quite a long\nway over there at the end of the uh place, he expired and he died in our hands and uh uh this was,\nI must say, the first uh casualty I witnessed of somebody I knew well, and then from this day on,\nmany many things happened because the resistance, the power of resistance somehow\nevaporated. How I did it I don't know. II thought out all kind...I I also felt that I I] became\nweaker. As a matter of fact, one morning I fainted and my good friends uh lifted me up and the\nwhole day was difficult forme. Uh but I somehow managed. It was one of these miracles, but\nuh but uh uh after one month I would say, from the two hundred and twenty or so we had been\nwhen we were newcomers, only I think a hundred and fifty had survived, but to save the other's\nplace, later, after liberation when I tried to find out how many of our transport had survived, of\nthe thousand who had left Berlin, not more than six, and I am one of those. So uh uh I myself\nasked the question, how long would I be able to to to tolerate that and uh also uh we were cut off.\nWe didn't know what what was the latest on the front. We were waiting for the second front and\ndidn't know any...hear anything because we were cut off from any news. We didn't hear\nanything about uh what was going on on the eastern front, so I said how long can it last. And I\nremember that one moment then when I went to the toilet, I found a piece of newspaper that\nprobably an SS man had left there, and it so happened that I took into my...you know, pockets I\ndidn't have, but...yeah...was hiding it under my underwear and and, you know, we had to be\ncareful to to to handle this and it so happened when I was in the block with my friends I said\nwatch that somebody should discover us and uh I read it and it so happened that was a piece with\nthe report of the of the German Wiermacht saying that they had been driven out of Krackow (ph)\nwhich gave me an idea that the front, the Russian front, was advancing, but more I didn't know,\nbut somehow it it added again, you know, to the spark of life and uh then uh there was another\nday when I almost lost uh my my my uh belief that I would be able to make it. In our group was\na man who uh uh was very active also in our youth movement. He uh was uh uh a Jewish civil\nemployee, and he was a man with a beautiful voice. He had studied music because he wanted to\nbecome a cantor, and he had been in another kommando and uh I met him and he was desperate.\nI said to him uh...his name was Fritz Shafer (ph)...uh what happened. He said I've had enough. I\ncan't take it any longer. I said what are you going to do. He said I have uh...I was sick. I went\nto the hospital. After three days they threw me out. I can hardly stand on my feet and I don't\nlike to be to be to be kicked to death, so I'd rather take my own life, so I argued with him. I said\nFritz, how can you do it. Think what we have gone through. Think what we have been taught.\nHow can you take your own life. After all, you are observant Jew. It's un-Jewish. He said, this\nis my decision. I don't want to be to be to be kicked to death, because what happened here...for\nthis there is no provision in the bible and in in our scriptures, and the next day I heard in the\nmorning whatever shooting going on during the night. Very often the SS guards on the tower,\nthey were sometimes shooting because...to keep themselves awake let us say, and they could\norder you...they had these Jews that they saw something in there for the...1t was suspicious and\ntherefore they were firing, so uh so we heard shooting constantly, and next day somebody said\nyou know, did you hear the shooting this morning. I said yes, what happened. They said your\nfriend, Fritz Shafer...he uh he uh he tried to be admitted to the to the hospital again. They didn't\naccept him, so he said under those conditionsI I _\u2014_\u2014s went against the...you know, this was one\nof the ways in which people also put an end to their misery. They went to the to the wire and\nthen the fellow from the the gangster from the...the SS gangster from the watch tower was\nshooting because that was his order, so he went to the wire in order to be shot and and that's what\nhappened. And I remember it still...1t was on April 3rd, 1940...'43, soon after we arrived. Uh so\nwhen I heard this, I must say I I I I was almost lost because I had lost a battle and I saw the\nparallel and I was uh said...asking myself how long will we all be able to make that, and then uh\none day or two days later, all of a sudden there was uh uh a special roll call that people should\nregister again their their their uh profession, so that gave me another hope and uh there was what\nthey called the labor service, . Again registered and I registered myself again as\nwelder. The uh reason was that the Germans had lost on account of Stalingrad a lot of\nmanpower, had uh uh inducted into the army also skilled labor, so they were short of labor, and\nobviously were interested to to now somehow in our in our skill, if you want to. So III uh\nregistered. Nothing came out of it but somehow it gave me some hope, and there was another\nevent which uh was of immense importance. All the time when when I was there at the\nbeginning, we were constantly under the under the supervision of the SS gangsters, and they\nwere brutal, brutal, brutal uh uh beings. I cannot say human beings. So uh uh even, you know,\nwhen you wanted to go to the toilet and so you had you had to to to honor by taking off your cap\nand asking for permission, for his permission and so on and what they did in order to play around\nwas very often to take, when you when you take off your cap, take the cap and throw it away and\nwhen the moment when you...when the people went to get, to collect the cap, then the SS man\nwas shooting him on the pretense that he was trying to uh to uh to uh run away, so uh that...and\nthis this was the uh the situation the first couple of weeks. Also in connection with the\nStalingrad defeat uh they then came to the conclusion that they wanted to save manpower and\nthey organized the uh the uh guards in such a way that they were surrounding completely the\nwhole area of that industrial complex, so that when we marched out, when we got into into into\nthe factory area, the SS stayed outside uh keeping guard out...yeah, keeping guard outside but we\nmarched in only with the kapos. And that alleviated certainly the situation somehow because\nthen the kapos in order to keep their pos...their position who were very, very rough with their\nown people...they were mostly German criminals and and anti-social elements and so they then\nwere not not not provoked anymore by the SS to to to become tougher with the...so this helped\nsomehow, but still 1t was no no no no solution and and as I say, I 1 1 I thought what what...still I\nwas able to move but but I said something has to had to be done. For instance, we were then...I\nwas put in another kommando under the command of a kapo who was a Polish criminal. He had\ncommitted one or two murders uh and and he was such a human being the only regret he had that\nhe had waited too long to murder his wife and his mother-in-law, so uh so uh and he was\ntaking...he was not sent...sentenced to death for one reason or the other because uh...so uh he was\na kapo there and he had uh used the foul language especially in Polish, because he was also was\nalso one of these ethnic Germans who didn't know exactly where they belonged. You know,\nthey they they they they had a double standard. They wanted to be Germans, and at the same\ntime uh uh they wanted to to remain with their fellow Poles, so uh...and he he uh he was the head\nof a digging kommando, and that was also that was that that uh he was called in a German\nexpression was Juden Franz (ph). Franz is a German name, but Juden Franz was Jew Franz he\ngot because he was a grinder of Jews. He had shown so many Jewish uh casualties on his\nconscious. And he would always say, well I had to do it in order to enforce the \u2014_\u2014, and we\nwere not protected. There was no protected because not only had I lost my my my name and my\nhair and my clothing and my family...I also had had lost completely my my right to claim any\nhuman rights. And uh that's what certainly these these people, these gangsters knew very well\nthat there was no protection and uh then one day uh the uh the uh...we were called again to the\nlabor office, again for registration, but this time in the presence of a representative of ;\nAnd again we were asked what is your uh uh profession, name...uh not name, number and\nprofession, and I said welder. He was somehow doubtful, for what reasons, but uh then he asked\nme certain technical questions and I was able to answer them, and then uh uh two days later I\nwas transferred into a kommando where I I got out of this grinding work of transport, digging,\nand all this and uh was attached to what they call a German meister (ph) uh and uh uh the work\nwas...and it was a great help...was to clean big plates which were used in the uh gasoline\ncolumns which had come in order to uh to be installed in the in the factory. That gave me a\nchance somehow to to to to rest a little bit in between because I was not under the super...this the\nkapo there was a political prisoner from from sso uh I could recover a little bit. The only\nthing which I dreaded very much that because of that I was transferred also into another lager, to\nanother barracks and had not the daily contact with my friends there who were still doing work\nand as I in that terrible kommando there. Well, uh so uh uh especially, as I say, uh uh at the\nbeginning uh life or the day in in Auschwitz was simply a day of getting up, starting to run, uh\nbeing exposed to uh to uh the whim of the blockaltester or kapo, so hardly be able to to sit, uh\nwatching what what what uh left and right uh what what was happening so that it shouldn't\nhappen to you and especially uh to to try to to do the work, which was not work, which was\nreally slave work reminding you somehow of the illustrations you saw inthe __\u2014_\u2014~when the\nJews in in Egypt were building the pyramids. Uh it, as I say, it improved somehow, and I felt at\nleast the improvement uh when when when the SS guards were taken away...",
        "Question: At that point did you make a decision to try to ration your energy very carefully?\nHow soon did you do that...",
        "Answer: Especially when I when when I came to the conclusion that what little I had, I had to to\nstretch out my energy. For instance, there was...I don't know if it's right, but I got the bread in\nthe morning. I didn't eat it immediately. I kept a little bit and kept it in my pocket somehow so\nthat they say, when when it's drier, then it has more nourishing value, or one instance I tried to\nuh to uh to uh...especially after the SS was taken away from the kommandos, to go to the to the\ntoilet unobserved as often as possible to have to have a minute of rest, or for instance uh you\nknow, uh uh we had as tool only our bowl and a and a and a and a spoon. Now I came to the\nconclusion in order to cut the bread...we had no knives certainly. That was dangerous for the\nGermans, for the German state. Uh I sharpened part of that of that spoon so that it was easier\nsomehow to cut in order to save energy and and and this...and also uh uh uh what I tried in spite\nof all obstacles to to to remain clean. Uh because I realized that the moment I would give in, that\ncould be the end easily, so uh uh and then when I was working for that first German meister, uh\nuh who was who was more or less pleasant, uh uh because he treated me not as an inmate, as a\nheftling, as a slave. He treated me as somebody who was like a helper or uh...not in his category\nbut as a helper and uh then I tried, you know, to sit down as often as possible and to to relax to\nto...whenever I could and not to exert myself, do anything special, certainly not to run anymore\nand so to try to to to walk in a way that that I don't consume too much ener...energy. Uh after a\ncertain while I lost that job because there was a conflict between and the and the and\nthe which was doing this kind of work and uh then I was uh uh handed over to another\nfellow who...as a welder...uh the German meister who came from Saxony (ph) and he was a first\nclass worker, but his religion as you have it very often in in Germany...his whole religion was\nwork. He didn't understand anything about politics. His politics was work. He didn't like it. He\ndidn't like the war but this doesn't affect 1t. He was just...as long as he could work, and he was\nvery proud in his work, so at the beginning it was not so easy because I was not an accomplished\nwelder, but I tried to learn from him and he realized that and I must say in all fairness, he treated\nme like an equal. And when he saw that I made progress in whatever he wanted me to do, then\nhe gave me some cigarettes uh which I didn't use certainly because I then bartered the cigarettes\nfor bread which was very important, also to to get up some more energy. And uh uh so uh also\nwhat was a tremendous advantage, that uh when I worked with him I could work under a roof so\nthat the elements...I was not exposed to the elements. I also remember that uh when I entered\nthis building where I worked then, I for the first time in weeks I saw a mirror, and I looked\nmyself into the mirror and I was aghast. I was simply...I I I mean this was the worst, one of the\nworst things I must say that happened to me. I didn't recognize myself anymore, certainly\nwithout hair, unshaven you know, because we had a chance only to to be shaven once a week,\nand I said for goodness sake, what happened to you. Uh uh but still the fact that I was\nsomehow now in a better position helped me tremendously and and I was still felt sorry that for\nmy other friends that they having no skill and having nothing to offer in this respect were not\nable to alleviate their situation somehow, and uh so I I I worked with this man for a certain while\nand again then something changed uh because because uh uh uh they wanted to have welders in\nin in in the camp directly. There was a welder kommando and the Buna was constantly\nexpanding and at the beginning when I came, the total of was approximately two thousand or\ntwo thousand five hundred. Then we we we grew to approximately ten thousand. What they did\nwas also that uh they uh and the Germans were...the Nazis did things which are not well known\nbut should be should be recorded. At a certain time, they established brothels for the German uh\ninmates and the Polish inmates, and they brought prostitutes from Poland and from Germany into\na special barrack where the the the Polish uh uh inmates, non-Jewish Polish inmates, or the\nGerman inmates had an opportunity to go whenever there was...there was a certain schedule for\nthat. There was a special barrack built in the middle of the and we were called to uh to\ndo the heating there, to establish the heating so they needed welders and I was one of them\nwhich gave me a tremendous uh uh...which was a tremendous help. Number one, I mean I was\nsuffering from certain , from from swollen feet, so I didn't have to walk these long\ndistances to the to the to the factory and uh also I became acquainted with the with the people\nthere inthe camp, __ people and so and IJ started to do certain things in my free time, using\nscrap and making hooks for the beds, or or for the curtains and things like that and I...and it\nturned...there was no money. I mean none of us was allowed to have any money certainly, so\nyou were bartering for bread and and and so this kind of work uh uh uh...I wouldn't say I liked\nbut it was helpful also to to come back to my to my somehow to my health and to my to my\nenergy. Uh also uh in in...in between I started to work outside in in that area with a with a with a\nman who was, interesting enough, a Polish national but who was an artist as a welder and I\nlearned a lot from him, and...though he was a very nationalistic Pole, he was no anti-Semite. He\nwas special, and we got on good terms. Uh he bought me papers, newspapers, I mean\nand once in a while a piece of of of of uh sausage. I even could could ask him to write for me a\nletter to a neighbor of mine in Berlin with whom I had left some money and some things, and\nsure enough this lady, a wonderful lady, wrote back and and sent money and some food to this\nPolish man, so I left him with the money because I couldn't use the money. It was too dangerous\nbut he gave me the food and that was manna for me. So uh uh and also this... == =\u2014\u2014\u2014s was his\nname...he had a very interesting technique. Since he hated the Germans so much, uh and hated\ncertainly to work for _ for the war effort, he had developed a certain technique, you know,\nwhen you weld pipes you have to be very careful because uh under high pressure they could\nburst easily and therefore you have to be have to be very accurate. I knew how to do this. I\nknew how to do it, and then he taught me how to do it that 1t looked good from the outside, was\nbad from the inside, by, for instance, apply more oxygen or an abundance of oxygen so that\nbubbles would would would would build inside the the the metal and it would...the weld of\nmetal, and certainly the pressure...and the pipes would not be able to to to to tolerate the\npressure. Uh and that's how...I say when I worked with him for the first time, we established a\ncontact. Then I I worked in the camp for the...partly to establish that brothel and then when I\nwas working in the camp, I heard one day that there were British prisoners of war who had\nappeared in that factory and sure enough, uh what the Germans had done was uh the British, as\nyou know from the records, had fought Rommel in North Africa, had surrendered at. : The\nsoldiers who had been taken prisoner in ___ had been brought to Italy and when Italy got out\nof the war, the Germans didn't let them go but transferred them to Germany and to Upper\nSalasia. was that camp, a tremendous prisoner of war camp and against the rules and\nregulations of the Geneva Convention, they brought of these prisoners of war to\nAuschwitz, not to work like us, I mean like inmates, but in their uniform. Uh they had a special\ncamp, a special prisoner of war camp and they were guarded by German...by German soldiers,\nby by by by by army soldiers, but they put them to work in that factory and when I heard this I\nsaid I have to come...I have to meet them. How I didn't know, so I uh arranged it somehow that I\ngot an assignment with the same kommando I was before, this ...(pause) and uh when I\nsaw the the the...they also when they got into the...under the uh uh area of their ___s complex,\nthey were marching, but they were marching differently than we were. They were marching to\nsuch extent that the German guards were mostly elderly fellows and they could hardly uh keep\nup with them, and when they saw us, I tell you they were throwing cigarettes at us and whatever\nthey had and uh keep up these good spirits and so 1t was tremendous. And uh I could almost\nweep when I when I saw that. That was a tremendous...tremendous uh...give us a\nspirit...tremendous spiritual uplift, and I could feel it and then I I thought how could I come into\ncontact and luckily when I was transferred back to that fellow __, uh British uh prisoners of\nwar were working in the neighborhood and under very, very careful circumstances and all\nbecause they had to be careful. Uh uh I was then able to establish contact with them, and luckily\nmy school English was good enough...__\u2014_\u2014~s English which I had improved during my my years\nat the University. The British were very careful, on an individual basis, because they never knew\nwith whom they were meeting, you know, and slowly but surely, and I say it with pride, I was\nable to to establish a very close personal contact and the moment the this kind of sound barrier\nwas was was pierced, they became the best friends you could imagine, and what they did was not\nonly for me but many others, for instance, they had, you know, there was a different categories\nof of soup for the luncheon and uh the quality of our soup was the worst. The quality for the\nGerman civilians was the best. For the English prisoners of war, theirs was in between, but they\ndidn't need it. They didn't want it because luckily they had their International Red Cross parcels,\nso, therefore, they had already clients amongst our people, our inmates, to give them the soup\nwhich was very helpful because it was of better quality and uh they uh...since I was on such\nterms with them, they helped me with chocolates and and things like that. At the end actually I\nhad British...when I walked out from Auschwitz, I had British socks. I had British shoes. I had\nBritish underwear, so uh uh because they had enough of that stuff and they didn't need all this,\nbut what was most important was...or two thingsI_ _\u2014stthe British sr was, one day uh uh they\ntold us that would...you know, they they they they had chocolate and cigarettes. They were also\ntrading with the civil population in that in that in that area, in that complex, uh so they they were\nable to construct a radio set via uh like in what...Stalag 18 (ph), you know...and they every night\nwere listening to BBC London. They had certainly technically tech...people with technical\nknowledge and so on, uh so...hiding it certainly from different German guards and after I had\nestablished this uh atmosphere of confidence with them, uh they uh agreed to tell me what they\nhave heard, so that I actually was able to uh to uh to follow the news of BBC London in\nAuschwitz and compare this news with what was written in the newspapers...discuss it with\nthem. Also they asked me...once in a while, you know, they met girls, Ukrainian girls, Polish\ngirls. They said they fell in love with them, or girls from Czechoslovakia, and they wanted to\ncommunicate with them but the girls certainly didn't understand understand English, so I\nvolunteered to write in German to these girls. After the war, when it's over, we'll come and\nmarry you and I give you my word as a prisoner of the of the of the English uh soldier that I will\nnever forget you and so so that was that was that was uh uh with them and and I must say this\nthis helped uh tremendously, because it it kept us...at least kept me...I couldn't communicate with\neverybody in the camp but with the close circle of friends I had, what we had heard and what\nwhat what the progress were and one one of the most was...emotional days was when first uh\nthere came the news...you must remember that by error a girl had played around with a telegraph\nin London and the the news had gone out that the Allies had landed in Normandy, and then it\nturned out it was a hoax, but on the day when they did land, uh somehow there was an\nelectrifying atmosphere in Auschwitz and the Germans became very nervous, and I immediately\nwent to my friends and said what what uh happened. They said we don't know because we don't\nlike to talk about it before we have a confirmation, and the next morning uh uh they were\njubilant and almost drunken, so said it happened. They have landed, and then I could come back\nto my friends in the camp and said listen, that's it, and it's created...1 mean then we somehow we\nwe knew that it was simply a matter of time when when when the the front in the east and in the\nwest would come clear and though we were more or less aware that the Nazis might not allow us\nto live to to to experience the day of liberation, that at least that that there's some hope. And that\nthat we can look forward to that moment eventually, so uh as I say, the the role of the of the\nBritish prisoner...I I I'm very very grateful to them and I must say for for for for most of my\nfriends. Uh years ago, BBC London brought me over to uh to London, because they had a show,\n\"This is Your Life,\" of one of the prisoners who interesting enough had been a member of the\nBritish army, had survived Dunkirk, had had been had been had been taken prisoner at Dunkirk,\nhad been I don't know in how many prisoner of war camps, had tried to to escape and\nunfortunately could never make it, and he was a daredevil. He was some kind ofa _\u2014\u2014_\u2014s and uh\nso uh uh uh they they they uh uh he had the courage to smuggle himself into our camp to find out\nwhat it was or what ___\u2014_\u2014srwass, because when I talked to these people, and I said listen, uh you\nI'm sure will survive. I, I don't know, because we don't know...but I want to give you all the\nfacts and when you come back to England and come back to your families, tell them our tale\nbecause I'm not...I cannot be sure, and they very often said to me, Norbert, how is it...how can\nthis be possible. I mean what you are telling us is so impossible. Uh uh there the Gerries (ph)\nare going around, even these gangsters in SS uniform, and you know, we had also cont...SS\ncontrol in the in the camp...inin the area, _, but they look like human beings would with\nwith their noses and their eyes and their mouths are the same like others. How is this possible?\nAnd uh uh (coughing) I said I have no explanation, but this is what it is and especially when in\nthe summer of 1944 when the Hungarian transports came en masse...that's a transport uh with\nwhich, for instance, also = =~=camefrom ___ to Auschwitz, to our camp...the gas chambers\nworked over time, but the crematorias were not able to uh to uh to uh to uh do their work\nanymore, so hundreds and thousands of corpses were burned outside of the crematoria so the\narea of Auschwitz was filled with the...call it stench of of of burned flesh and uh then when this\nalso waved into our area, I went around andI saidto _, you know, this must be it because we\nwere aware. \u2014\u2014_\u2014sy and uh uh uh in mn... luckily, you know, under...amongst these British who had\nno nobody who had any sympathy for Hitler or his racial \u2014\u2014_. - They were really wonderful\nfriends with with with with uh with a sense of solidarity and as I told you, when I came to that\nBBC show, this man, was his name, they said this is your life and they brought me over\nas one of the of the witnesses to to give evidence what...what he had done and how he done it\nand and uh uh to repeat this again, I hope that this story of the British prisoners of war in\nAuschwitz will be told one day, because it deserves to be told.

        "Question: Did you...uh could you tell us about the...your birthday in 1943 withthe _\u2014_\u2014?",
        "Answer: Oh that was...that was that was still at a very bad time. Uh uh you know, it was...my\nbirthday was on a Sunday and uh I turned thirty on that day, on April 26th, 1943. I had been in\nAuschwitz uh six weeks and uh I was uh uh run down but not not completely desperate but not in\ngood mood and uh especially on that day, on that birthday, 1t was a Sunday. We didn't march out\nto work uh so it was a beautiful day and uh Auschwitz was not far from the \u2014_ Mountains,\nbeautiful area in Poland, and the air was so clear, blue sky...you could see the mountains and\ntheir beauty, and somehow that affected me and uh uh uh gave me gave me some courage and\nthen on that day for one reason or the other, uh we got bread and some marmalade, which was\nnot given too often and uh when one of my friends from the youth movement said you see, on\nthat birthday...it's almost better than cake __ and that that that happening somehow, that that\nwas really a...you see, you you are...every little bit was was was helpful in order to to to uh to to\nuh strengthen your your spirit of...your spirit of .. your your...yeah...your spirit to live.\nUh also uh I must say in this respect, another experience is interesting. Uh we had in our block\namongst the old timers a man who originated from Vienna. He wasuhuha____ scholar, and he\nwas taken with a so-called Polish...Polish action in September '39, uh was taken to Buchenwald,\nfrom Buchenwald to to Auschwitz where I met him, and he was one of those who uh knew the\nbible and \u2014\u2014\u2014_s and so very well, but, you know, you had no no books there. Whatever was\ndone there, were taught or discussed was was from from your memory, and he established a a\nservice on the block so uh thought I was not...I mean certainly I attended service in Berlin, not\nevery day but certainly on holy days and so so then under certain precautions, under precautions\nuh uh he assembled in the corner to have a minion (ph), to have ten people and he said the\nmorning prayers and he knew them by heart certainly and uh, you know, this is...this was an\nexpression of directly resistance, that in...you know, God was treating us as he did treat us as we\nthought, __ had forsaken us as we thought, but nevertheless we said, , we still\nbelieve in you, and we came together for service and it was, I must say, I had the experience of\nunforgettable uh uh service. We had Yom Kippur service in in in Auschwitz with a few of our\npeople uh and uh uh there was a cantor who also recited all the prayers from memory and we\nsaid our prayers. Certainly we were very very careful that the SS or would not discover\nus, and in spite of, you know, in other words praising God in spite of everything, and uh I must\nsay uh it it was strengthening us spiritually which was also very important only...after all, you\ndon't exist only physically. You also exist spiritually and one can be uh uh uh the function of\nanother, uh so uh uh this this...all this added to the to the coming back of energy I would say, that\nI wasn't...after one year, let us say, I wasn't used to Auschwitz. I still was despising...but I had\nbecome somehow numb. I knew I couldn't change things...all these people I have lost, all these\nvictims I had seen, all these corpses I had seen lying around, and by the way I lost also then\nwithin a short time, two of my close friends be...because they they could...one was a man who\nwas highly idealistic and he couldn't take the misery and the the this this this this height of\ninhumanity, so he he uh said enough is enough. Didn't take his life, but he just resigned. And\nanother friend of mine contracted jaundice and there was there was no no way to help him, so as\nI say I lost but I also were able to establish contact with other people who had come...from all\nover the world people had come to Auschwitz. I had met people from from from \u2014\u2014__ with\nwhom I communicated in my broken French, and and tried to help them somehow. There were\npeople coming from all over, not only Poland and Yugoslavia but also Holland and Norway and\nand and uh France and and Germany and uh then after a certain while, because they knew that I\nhad this call it information service and had contacts with the British, that uh they came to me\nonce in a while, tried to help. For instance, one day a man came to me whom I met in the in the\nbarrack of a friend of mine. He was the elderly of this block, an old timer, still alive, now\nresiding in Los Angeles, and uh he came and he said he was looking for me, so uh what do you\nwant, and he said he just came from a from a branch camp, from a from a mine, from a coal mine\ncamp. Uh Max ___ was his name, and he said I need you. I said what do you need me for. He\nsaid I know that you have special contacts with the British. Try to help me. I said why. And he\ntold me the following story, that he uh uh originated from the German-speaking part of\nCzechoslovakia, uh . He was a gynecologist, practicing doctor, but also was active\npolitically against the Nazis and when they took over Czechoslovakia, it was time for him to to\nflee, and he was able to reach England and when the war broke out, he volunteered as a doctor\nfor the for the for the military. They didn't take him into the army for one reason or the other,\nbut they gave him a position as a doctor on the merchant marine and here was was...got a\nposition with the...I think it was the Blue __ Line in in in Manchester, in\nLiverpool...sorry...Liverpool. From Liverpool uh ships at this time went to still to the Far East,\nso he made a first journey from Liverpool to Singapore and came back and it was absolutely\nuneventful, but when he went on a second trip, he came to Singapore and when he left\nSingapore, his boat was attacked by a German raider which had come from Japan, and that\nGerman raider was armed and had already \u2014__\u2014_ some other ships, so it attacked his ship, was\noverwhelmed because they were not were not properly armed and was also taken into \u2014_\u2014__ and\nand they made their way...I think it was in the Strait of where they were attacked, made\nthe whole trip through the Indian Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope into the Atlantic Ocean\nand landed in Bordeaux (ph) and were not interfered with by the by the by the by the Allied uh\nships or the Allied Allied Allied air force. There was a time when when when England was very\nvery weak but...when they came to to Bordeaux, he together with the crew was taken to a to a uh\ncamp for the merchant marine, but when they searched the uh safe of the ship, of the British ship,\nthey found out that he was not a British nationalist but a Czech. Why the British were so stupid\nto to to to mention that in this I don't know, but they did it. And they then investigated in |\nwho he was and found out that he was active against the Nazis, so very soon after he landed in\nthis merchant marine camp, he got an order signed by ____ personally to be transferred to\nAuschwitz, and he came to Auschwitz in the uniform of the British merchant marine, and he was\nlooking somehow to bring his message out. When he was in the coal mine he couldn't find\nanybody, but when he came to Buna he heard about me (coughing) and uh I said what can I do.\nHe said try...he said I know, and we informed of that, that amongst these British prisoners of\nwar, there is a system that every month or every second month, every third month, one of\nthem...it's like a military action, has to try to escape to make his way into Switzerland, and there\nhe is bringing news and information about about the life...\nEND OF TAPE 4\n"

        "Answer: Uh my name is Norbert Wolheim, born on April 26th, 1913 in Berlin, Germany.",
        "Answer: Well uh I...my family was a closely-knitted family and my father, bless his memory,\nwas uh uh a commissioned salesman and he had uh developed his own business before World\nWar I when he was called into service and the business then had to be closed. My mother, bless\nher memory, was a housewife and she took care of us during the time when my father went away\nto war. I was only one and a year year...one and a half years old when he left us to serve in\nFrance and in Russia with the German army. He was a member of the medical corps, and when\nhe came back in 1919 or so, after the end of the war, my mother always told me that uh I had\ndifficulties to to to greet him as a son because he had become a stranger to me because he had\nbeen away for so many years, and I grew up during the time of uh the Weimar (ph) Republic. I\nhad an elder...an older sister. Uh our parents saw to it that we had a good education and though\nuh we we longed...belonged to a called...would call it here to the middle \u2014\u2014_\u2014__ families, uh and\nthings were tough in economical terms uh after the war, during the inflation and later the\nDepression, but uh as I say our parents saw to it that we had a solid education, a solid uh general\neducation and also a solid Jewish education, so we all...my sister and I, we went toa toatoa\nupper elementary schools to high schools. My sister to a Jewish high school. I was in a non-\nJewish high school where in these years over there uh since I...we had not too many Jewish uh\nchildren, I met a certain amount of anti-Semitism but not uh militant anti-Semitism but it was\nyou called more kind of cultural anti-Semitism but uh uh we managed.",
        "Answer: Well, that we were not included in the human...you had you had groups uh who who\ndid certain things, uh whether be it in sport or socially, and so I was not invited. I was not\ninvited so it I didn't suffer from that, especially not when I, after my bar mitzvah, I joined the\nJewish Youth Movement and which asserted me of my Jewish values and my Jewish heritage\nbecause that was also somehow I would say a turn in my life because I became uh active in that\ngroup. I was thirteen, fourteen years old, and uh it was a group uh uh which was believing in the\nuh in in political and ideological terms in a synthesis between uh Germans and Jews. In other\nwords it was a non-Zionist movement. The uh major value of this was that you met the people\nwho had uh were devoted towards this idealism and hoping for a new world, for a better world,\nand the working that go by working on yourself. That means in educational terms uh we\nwe we uh read. We were at this time influenced I remember by writings of Martin ;\n, Studying the bible, studying our history...uh which as I say it was a very special\nvalue, but also uh uh by by trying to uh to make a contribution we did a lot of call it social work,\nwhich means taking care of needy uh uh children, especially uh uh children of our age in\ndistress. We worked with them. We we we we invited them. We we tried to help them. We\ntried to alleviate their problems by just showing that we are there for them and for them,\nespecially for children who came out from broken homes, who had who had uh a brush with the\nlaw and so on, so that we considered them as uh as people who had to be saved and this was part\nof our work between our contribution to try to help them, and uh this was I would say very\nimportant because there we established personal friendships, uh girls and boys and and uh we we\nwe we followed the principle of Boy Scouts. We we we discovered nature. We were hiking.\nWe stayed overnight in tents and we enjoyed the beauty of of of of nature. But at the same time\nwe had very interesting evenings in discussions. People had to be prepared to deliver let us say a\nlecture about whatever the subject matter was, be it literature, philosophy, or whatever it is and\nJewish and German kings or whatnot...general things, and that that was very, very attractive for\nall of us and and it gave us a certain sense of future responsibility. I would not say leadership\nbut responsibility and therefore whatever...",
        "Answer: Well the name us first the called , which is the German-Jewish\nYouth uh uh Alliance and later called , the Association of Jewish Youth, and and uh\nwhat I got out of it was that uh I found people of my age and and my call it mentality and and uh\nmy ideals and we we we uh worked together. We met actually during the week almost twice or\nthree times on evenings. We met over the weekends. We we were hiking uh in the area around\nBerlin which is beautiful and uh then as I say we uh we were really call it enriching ourselves\nwith with knowledge which which came about by exchanging news, by by putting people to\nwork let us say to to uh uh uh prepare a lecture or whatever it is in whatever the area was. At the\nsame time I would not uh uh minimize the influence of my of my parents on on on me. We\nuh...my father, bless his memory, came from a very traditional home in in the eastern part of\nGermany, from Posen (ph). He had a very basic Jewish education and uh we were uh uh not\northodox but very conservative. Uh uh we observed the holy days certainly uh and uh especially\nduring the holy days we saw the families and and friends and then uh my father and after the war\nas a veteran became active in the Jewish War Veterans uh uh movement, also doing social work\nfor needy uh veterans and my mother, blessed memory, joined the auxiliaries there and so we\nall...and my sister certainly was also active, so we were all active in in one kind of Jewish affairs\nor the other, but there was one day or one evening when all this...when when we assembled\naround the uh the uh family table and that was Friday evening. Certainly having kiddish (ph)\nand having the Friday meal and having having the relatives uh who joined us, but mainly after\nthat then people were dropping in for coffee and cake and then then the the events of the week\nand the events of the day were discussed and I got out a lot from that because first of all 1t was a\nwonderful family...family uh uh atmosphere in spite of all the difficulties we had around us\nbecause the diff...the economical situation in Germany during the inflation and then at the time\nof the Depression was not easy, but there was a warmth of a of a Jewish home which which I\nappreciated very much and I think formed me and and and therefore my my my rightful family\nand my my love for family, it came from there uh and which was held up in all as I say in all...in\nspite of all difficulties. My father worked hard to make a living uh but on Friday night as they\nsay in that famous uh uh uh song, Yiddish song, that on Friday night every Jew is a king, and this\nthis was reflected uh in the observance of the rituals and then also in in a social way and uh uh\nthat was known to us so and there there were no invitations sent out. People just dropped in and\nwe were happy to have them and shared with them whatever we had. Uh and uh in the youth\nmovement, not only did we do uh uh intellectual work and educational work but certainly uh\nthey developed ties with with friends and I must say that for for...over the years these ties\nbecame very...have remained very close, up to today. They are not too many people left survive,\nbut some of them I I went to together to Auschwitz and I lost them, but uh especially I must say\nwhen I came for the first time on a on a visit to this...to America. I was sent by the United\nJewish Appeal in 1946 to this country to bring the message of the survivors to to to the American\nJewry. I met some of my old friends of that time and uh it was interesting that we could...as if\nnothing had happened in between. These ties were there again in spite of of of distance and and\ntime. We got together again, irrespective of our changed political orientation in many a time or\nideological orientation, but this tie...these personal ties were strong ties and have remained uh uh\nand I would say still today for ourselves, the old guard, we get together whenever we can and\nand this has remained. I also met my first wife in the youth movement. We were very young\nand uh and developed a relationship and and later uh uh we got married in Berlin, so uh it it was\nuh a time which which somehow formed us in in in a certain way and I would say that my uh\ndevotion to uh to uh, if I may say so, to uh things outside of personal interest, to do something\nfor the community, to do something for...to make it...try to make a contribution uh\nwas...originated from the fact that I saw it in the house of my parents who had dedicated their\ntheir time and life to certain things within these limits of their possibility, and later uh in the\nyouth movement where we were educated in the belief that uh uh it's not enough what you do for\nyourself. You have to try also to uh to uh to do something for people who who are less lucky\nthan you are or or need your help and and and support.",
        "Answer: Actually I stayed in the youth move...youth movement as long as it existed, because in\n1945 our group was dissolved by the Gestapo. Uh we tried but in in spite...1n other words they\ndid not allow us to to continue uh to to operate. Certain other groups were still allowed to\noperate till 1938. We were not. In 1935 as I say, uh we were liquidated, but irrespective of that\nuh uh we we uh kept our contacts. In other words, what we did was then that we we decided\n. Every week we had birthday celebrations. We came to...got together and uh well\ncertainly under the Nazi time things had changed completely with uh our approach to...or our\nthinking in political and ideological terms changed. Uh there came a time when we came to the\nconclusion that that there is no future for for for Jews in Germany and we should help to prepare\nyoung people to get out of Germany, especially in the years 1940...1935, '36 when slowly but\nsurely uh we we did understand that uh uh uh the Nazi regime was there to stay, that it was not a\ntransitory uh thing, and that uh uh uh uh there was, as I said, no future for for...especially for\nyoung people. So uh uh if you want to...I've never left the the the Youth Movement. It\nit's still in me somehow and uh interesting enough, this is something which...a\npheno...phenomenon which 1s not only restricted to Germany. When I speak with my friends\nfrom the east, uh there was also something that they called the youth movement and it's\ninteresting when you meet the people who are who are came out of that, they have a certain\nspecial approach to to the Jewish community and to to life which I share very much with them.",
        "Answer: Well, uh uh this is a loaded question uh because certainly in the '20's uh uh the Nazi uh\nuh party became stronger and stronger. There were differences of opinion...would they last,\nwould they not last, but uh given the political weakness of the Weimar Republic which was not\nuh uh able to enamor itself to the to the people, the fact that the uh democratic parties and the\nsocial democrats lost more and more in influence...uh uh we we...in spite of all that we thought\nthat the Republic would do...the Weimar Republic uh representatives would do something to try\nto stop the movement. They were not able to do it, so you had certainly a...during the\nDepression you had millions of unemployed and Hitler was uh uh able to...and his henchmen...to\ncapitalize on that and uh in addition to that that certainly there was a nationalistic feeling that uh\nGermany had not lost the war but was stabbed in the back and therefore the German army was\nnot defeated but was was uh defeated by the so-called home-front, which means by social\ndemocrats and communists and the Jews. Uh since we had our own Jewish values, I would say,\nit didn't affect us what the Nazi were were were were teaching and preaching, uh but on the other\nhand we were no doubt concerned what will what will happen in political terms. One\nconsideration was that uh uh if Hitler should try to come to power, the uh the uh powers around\nGermany...England, France, Czechoslovakia, Poland...would never...and Russia...would never\nallow him to do so but this was certainly an illusion as we learned later, and irrespective of that\nuh I and my friends and my future wife, we tried to uh uh participate as actively as we could still\nin the cultural life of of Berlin which was in this respect a wonderful city. It was leading in the\nin the area of music, theater, literature, and so on and we tried to uh to uh to uh to uh to\nparticipate to the best of our ability. In 1938...'31, I graduated from high school and I entered the\nUniversity of Berlin to study law and economics and as students we had certain, certain\nprivileges which...not privileges but certain uh when we went to the theater or the opera, it was\nfor very cheap money and we we we uh it was then still an accepted fact that we participated\nfully as Germans in this life, last not least due to the fact that in this cultural life you had many\nuh leading Jewish personalities. After all, in a city like Berlin...it was a city of Einstein, in the\nfield of music of __ and Otto (ph) and and and so and and say we uh we uh we really\nuh enjoyed it. Still we we were concerned about the fact that the uh the uh Nazis uh in a\ndemocratic way, uh were able to uh to uh add to their power because when it came to voting they\nincreased their seats in the in the Parliament, especially in the years of 1931 and 1932. Uh life at\nthe University, for instance, already was also influenced by the...remember that, you know, there\nwas there was uh uh a time around eleven o'clock when we all assembled in the lobby of the\nUniversity in Berlin, Jewish groups, the the leftists, and so on, democratic groups...sorry, not\nleftists...democratic groups, but also the Nazis and that didn't take long and uh there were brawls\nand there was fighting and so and since the University was ex-territorial, uh they didn't allow the\npolice to interfere so it was very unpleasant but the uh classes and also the classes of the Jewish\nprofessors, were not actually affected, at least not in Berlin. There was cases in Bressler (ph) we\nknow where they where they tried to disturb classes and so on, but not in Berlin and uh uh on the\nother hand uh also amongst the students it was taken up, amongst the intellectuals who originally\nvery much from the conservative groups of Germany, who had never become uh uh uh\nengaged in the principles of the Weimar Republic or democratic principles. Uh there was no real\nrebirth. I mean, democracy uh in after 1918 in Germany did not become a real fundamental\npolitical system, and uh especially these these uh nationalistic conserve...conservative groups\ncalled , they uh were uh...they produced most of the students. Also due to the fact\nthat uh uh then education became a monopoly of the of the uh more wealthier democracy in in\nGermany. There was not enough done in order to get people also out of less wealthier groups of\nthe of the of the progressive let us say, so we had our our our difficulties and still uh irrespective\nwe we did our work as students and uh and uh then when Hitler came to power on January 30th,\n1933...l remember that day very well. I was a student then and I had taken my classes and then\nall of a sudden came the news that Hitler had been called in to office by the German President.\nNow I want to emphasize that uh this was done in a very democratic way, which means that uh\nthat there was no uprising. I didn't see...I remember in Berlin when I came home from from the\nUniversity, I didn't see any soldiers uh walking in Berlin. Just the other way around the Nazis\nprepared for the tremendous torchlight procession they they they had organized for Hitler on on\nthe evening, and there was no opposition. Uh to emphasize in a very democratic way which\nmeans that that uh and this was the shock we had that he had actually succeeded 1n killing\ndemocracy in Germany with a means of democracy. Uh at the beginning in the first couple of\ndays uh uh the uh the uh especially the rowdies and the militants amongst the Nazis, especially\nthe Brown Militia then tried to take revenge against their opponents, but uh I luckily was not\naffected uh but we heard there was quite a number of cases where they tried to uh to uh to get\neven with their political opponents, especially social democrats, democrats and so on. And there\nwere a lot of acts of violence and we tried to follow up on it and to report it to the police. In\ncertain cases the police which uh uh uh was not at this time Nazified completely tried to help uh\nbut also they...but slowly this this this uh disappeared. So uh after a certain while uh this\nuh...these militant acts uh came to an end and the Nazis tried to organize themselves but then uh\naccepted the power more in in a legal way which means after the the uh burning of the\nuh and obviously it's my opinion that the Nazis had an actof \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014.:~ They promulgated very\nstringent laws taking away the uh the basic rights of people uh and uh then I came to the\nconclusion that most probably to continue studies at the University for law or of law uh would uh\nwould not guarantee me any future. After April Ist, 1933, certain uh laws were promulgated\nwhereby doctors and \u2014_\u2014_, uh Jewish doctors, Jewish doctors, lost their license, with the\nexception of those who had served as veterans in World War I, and since my father was uh\nuh...had seen action in World War I in France and in Russia, I was entitled to continue uh with\nmy studies, but as I say I did...came to the conclusion that uh this would not guarantee me a\nfuture, not in Germany, so then in uh in uh April-May I I stopped with my studies and I uh got...I\nwas volunteering in in some kind of Jewish community work because when I was in the youth\nmovement, the work done...especially the social work being done was always connected with the\nJewish community. The Jewish community in Berlin was a a very well-organized entity and had\ndepartments for the care from the cradle to the grave, I would say. Uh uh babies' homes and old\nage homes and so on, and we had a special department also for youth work and we were uh\nassociated with that group. Don't forget the Jewish community in Berlin uh uh consists of\napproximately two and one half thousand members. There was a certain tax system under which\npeople paid uh like they paid their income tax, they paid their Jewish taxes, and the Jewish\ncommunity financed all the activities out of these funds. In addition certainly there was certain\nprivate donations. So uh what I did was then I uh I became more active in in in this work,\nlooking for something else but then in 19...and my my my family uh was not personally affected\nthough it was more difficult for my for my father to continue his work as a commissioned agent.\nOn the other hand...and this is so absurd today when you're when you're hear this...uh one of the\nthings Hitler did was to uh to uh establish a a new order. My my father, for instance, had come\nhome with his decorations, his Iron Cross which was considered...was...he cherished it very\nmuch, so then one of the things Hitler did in '33 was to establish a a special medal for those\npeople who had seen active service at the front, and my father was a beneficiary of that which\nmeans that even Jews who had served in World War I also got this decoration, in the name of the\nFuhrer, absurd as it may sound today. So uh...and uh since most of the customers my father had\nwere non-Jews, I mean this decoration which you could display in a certain way, helped him so\nhe was still accepted as a as a German, if you want to, because at this time there were no\nJewish...special Jewish or something like. That came later. But things uh things uh...and\nthen interesting enough uh somehow by his force...by his...by introduction of certain uh laws\nalleviating the economical hardships and certainly the rearmament on which Germany started,\nthe economy somehow improved, uh believe it or not. And uh things also in this respect became\nsomehow easier for my father and and he didn't bad...do badly, to the same extent that uh you\ncan say that Jewish business did not...I mean certain of them closed but Jewish business, retail\nstores and so on continued to exist. Depart...Jewish department stores continued to exist and had\na...benefitted from the improvement of that situation and especially when it came to 1936 when\nwe had the Olympic Games in Berlin, then the Nazis for propaganda reasons certainly stayed\naway from any from any hostile activities and so on. Also because in connection with the\npolitical developments, the Nazis uh very gradually uh tightened the screws. In other words,\nthey they didn't start with the Holocaust immediately. It it was that they they started to feel their\nway around. They had to establish they have power. After they had taken care of all the\nopponents, the communists and the social democrats, the democrats, then they they they they uh\nuh felt that they were independently powerful and didn't have to listen to uh to uh any anybody\nelse and in in this this gave them then also uh as we all know unfortunately a power to to stre...to\nstretch their muscles in in international terms. In other words, the expectation we had that\neventually the powers like France, England and so forth resist, evaporated. Especially we had\n______ started to march into the Rhineland (ph) and uh though...we have learned this later...the uh\nGerman army was was uh uh under the order to return if if there should be resistance, uh and\nthey had no heavy weapons for that, but neither the French or the British resisted. France at this\ntime already...they had one of their crises so uh so Hitler was successful and when he felt that his\npower was growing also in international terms, then slowly the party also came to the conclusion\nthat that more should be done in order to exclude Jews from public life and from from\neconomical life, uh especially after the uh the uh the uh Olympic Games. I, in 1935, seeing\nsomehow the signs that the war and and we also in our groups who had believed in our future in\nGermany came to the conclusion that we had to change our our our approach, that whatever we\ncan do we should do to help people to uh to to get out of Germany, and also for those who live,\nas I say for one reason or the other, didn't or didn't want to go to Palestine, to other countries.\nThere were certain uh agricultural educational centers established to give those people who let us\nsay thought to go to South America or to North America and and enter agricultural life in these\ncountries, to give them the tools and the education. In 1935, as I said, I I entered a firm which...a\nJewish firm...which was active in the export-import business, especially in metals and and ore,\ndoing business with Sweden.\nLONG PAUSE IN TAPE\n...SO that people hopefully will learn something.",
        "Answer: Yes. And certain people don't forget one , you know. They cannot live\nmemory. I I think had this when we were checking people in connection with __ of\nthat trial I had against . They give these millions of and we brought the people in\nto check them out and I said well, for instance, where in Auschwitz,\nTAPE INAUDIBLE",
        "Answer: In 1935 I joined a firm, a Jewish firm, uh firm in the import-export business\nspecializing in metal trade and ore trade. This firm had excellent business contacts with\nEngland, Sweden, France and the eastern countries, so 1t was my hope that when I would join\nthat firm, I could establish also some kind of a contact in order to find a way out. I was working\nthere as a kind of an administrative assistant. I didn't love that my little work too much, but it\nwas alright because I still at this time uh uh remained active to...1n in in in Jewish affairs,\nespecially with the Jewish community and youth work. Uh for instance, the Jewish community\nat this time had developed a program which was interesting. Since we couldn't have Jewish\nsummer camps any more in Germany, uh the man who was my youth leader at that certain time\nwas very active and innovative, had established contact with Sweden and Denmark and had\nasked the Jewish communities there to accommodate Jewish children from Germany during the\nsummer, and they responded favorably. In Denmark, for instance, they uh had uh established\nspecial special summer camps near Copenhagen where they took hundreds of Jewish children\nfrom Germany to spend the summer there, which was very pleasant and in Sweden interesting\nenough, the Jewish community in Malmer (ph) and Stockholm organized a a program taking\nJewish children into Jewish families during the summer and uh I was able to accompany these\ntransports, so I had a first...I got a first uh uh uh experience how to handle these kind of\ntransports and then certainly when we went to Sweden and Denmark, we also uh certainly got\nfamiliar with the families and with the organizations, so we thought that somehow would be\nhelpful if if if need be. And uh so these were also the years where let me say that uh in spite of\nthe Nuremburg Laws which which were established in in then made it clear that Jews couldn't\nmembers of the of the German , German people and uh uh created the uh the uh laws\nabout racial racial uh associations and so in other words uh for...were forbidding the marriage of\nJews and non-Jews and certainly we we we uh we...I wouldn't say we accepted this but on the\nother hand we also said it doesn't affect us in our Jewish attitude, in our in our...in the judgment\nwhat our Jewish values were. We...and I can say also personally...I said the Nazis cannot tell me\nwhat kind of a human being I am. I'm a Jew and proud of it. I will not and cannot deny that that\nGermany, German culture, German language, formed my my my my uh formed my my\nintellectual being, but the Nazis have no uh...even if they do this, if they consider Jews as\nsecond-class human beings, it doesn't affect me because I'm I'm I'm proud...and that as I say, the\nuh the uh education in the in my home and in the youth movement had given me that certainty\nthat that I didn't feel offended by it. What I felt influenced by it, certainly did not develop any\ninferiority complex, or any inferiority complex, so and then came 1936 were the Olympic Games\nwhere where all political radical activities in Germany came to a certain halt in order to to\npresent to the world the best face Germany could show. And as you probably know, also the\nAmerican team which came to Germany was very much affected. The head of the team, Mr.\nBrundige (ph), uh uh did not make a favorable impression on me when he when he uh uh\ndeveloped this kind of closeness with the Nazis and and certainly when this happened with Jesse\nOwens and and and Hitler was uh treating him the way he did, we were I cannot say glad but it\nit... we were we were glad that the world saw what what Nazism and the racial superiority\ncom....and racial superiority complex meant to them. Then in the years '37, '38, uh when Hitler\nfelt that his power was growing and that also the uh German army got got stronger, uh and uh\nthe the Nazi Party probably came to the conclusion that there should be more radical solutions as\nfar as the Jews are concerned and they could then __ slowly feel that uh they tried to exclude\nJews more effectively from all ways of life and and especially in '38 I remember uh department\nstores, retail business and so on were...went more and more into the hands of non-Jews. They\ncalled it , which means very often under under pressure people had to sell their\nbusiness and...but it was still done more or less in a certain...in a certain legal way. Uh until then\nwe uh we uh uh uh in '38, in I think in September, I lost my position with that firm because this\nfirm also had to change ownership, was forced to change the ownership and all Jewish\nemployees lost their positions, I myself included, and uh then I already had came to the\nconclusion that I should try my best uh to to try to get out. I got married in 1938, in summer of\n1938. Things in Berlin were not pleasant because before I got married in front of a big\nsynagogue in in Berlin, , there were certain riots against Jewish uh Jewish retail stores\nand department stores. They smashed windows. They attacked the people walking the big\nstreets in Berlin so was...there was a question even whether we could have the uh the ceremony\nin the synagogue or not. But uh then this somehow uh uh died down and and I got married in the\nsummer of 1938 to the to the to the lady I met in the youth movement and uh we uh uh uh and I\nlost her in 1943 when when we were deported to Auschwitz, but that's another chapter. And we\nall tried then strongly to get out. I...we were we were we were registering under the quota\nsystem at the American Consulate for instance and my...and I felt a responsibility also to do\nsomething for my my parents. My father could not continue anymore with his activities in\nthe...after November '38 and so we were...he was drawn into...also into the forced labor groups in\nBerlin doing doing construction work and so on, so he was on in years but he was still...he was a\nstrong man and he was able to uh to manage and I decided to to try to do something to offer\nwhen I got out, because I knew with studies of law, economics, I couldn't establish a position\noutside wherever it would be, and uh the Jewish community again as a place where where where\nneeds were met of the of the Jewish population, had developed a lot of vocational training uh uh\ncourses and I decided to participate in a course for welding, for \u2014\u2014\u2014s welding. J uh...it was a\ncouple of months, and since I had lost my position I had the time to do that, and uh I must say I\nsomehow established...uh I got to like 1t because uh uh some work with your hands which which\nwhich I found interesting, especially ordinary metal, metal welding and so on. Never was an\nexpert, but at least that saved my life somehow. So uh uh and then we uh we uh in No...in\nOctober of 1938, uh my wife's parents had come from the east, came from Poland, and as a\nmatter of fact they still spoke Yiddish. My wife, born in Berlin, my first wife born in Berlin\nwent to a German school so she knew both German and Yiddish and in in October 1938 the\nGerman government got into a dispute with the Polish government because the Polish\ngovernment was was not very friendly to Jews, very reactionary and almost anti-Semitic,\naccepted a law that uh the passports of people living outside of Poland had to be renewed, but\nthat the passport of Jews living, for instance, in Germany, would not be renewed which meant\nthat uh those people would loose their their their Polish citizenship and nationality and the\nGermans uh...and after all, there were thousands of Jews from Poland living in Germany still\nthen. We had quite a big well-organized group of Polish Jews, for instance, in Berlin, and and\nthe Germans then came to the conclusion that they will not accept this challenge by the Polish\ngovernment because then they would be burdened as they thought with stateless Jews which they\ncouldn't deport if they wanted to to especially to Poland, so what they did was that before the uh\nthe laws uh became valid, they uh uh uh rounded up uh Jewish families of Polish origin I might\nsay, all over Germany and in in Berlin just the man...in in in other cities, full families and\ndeported them to the...deported them to the east into the no-man's land between Germany and\nPoland and uh this created a terrible situation. And of course in a matter of hours or so that that\nthey they invaded their homes in the middle of the night and took people out uh uh and amongst\nthose who were deported were uncles of my wife and uh who had come from Poland and had\nmade their way in Berlin, so we were also personally affected, but there was nothing we could\ndo. Uh the the only thing we could do was again that the Jewish uh community went into action\nand established interestingly enough call it cooperation of the police and the Gestapo and some\nrelief uh uh and work at the uh railway station where these transports came through and I\nparticipated also in that work uh uh because especially bene...came to help the younger people,\nthe contact between the youth movement members was still there irrespective of their ideological\norientation, Zionists, non-Zionists. There was a job to be done and we did it and uh it was it\nwas...there was utter confusion. It was was was a ruling because uh the Germans pushed people\ninto the no-man's land, especially in the area of uh Posen (ph) or this \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014s what they called it,\nin in east Germany and Upper Salasia, and the Poles didn't accept them, so for many many days\nthe unhappy people were exposed to the elements and and were not admitted to Poland and\ncertainly were not re-admitted to Germany. Uh so uh but eventually uh uh this was somehow\nsolved. Poles admitted some groups and organized relief action, as I found out later also with the\nhelp of young people of the Polish-Jewish youth movement in Poland, and uh it was so absurd\nthat I remember when we did this work, uh there were transports still rolling towards the east and\non the other side of the of the railway station, uh wagons, coaches came back with Jews who had\nnot been admitted and had been pushed back, but they originated not from Germany but from\nVienna, for instance, so that the problem for the Jewish community was to bring them back at\ntheir expense to Vienna because they had nothing to do in Berlin and uh amongst these uh uh\npeople who were deported were were were was a couple from Hanover by the name of\nGreenspan (ph), and uh as you know from history, young Greenspan who had lived in Hanover\nand had left his home in Hanover and had went...had gone to Paris and lived in Paris under\nabominable conditions...he was not...he had no permission to stay. He was frightened by a\ndeportation ordinance so obviously in his in his despair then uh bought a pistol and went to the\nGerman Embassy and shot this uh German. He got who interestingly enough was not\nan ardent Nazi. Uh when this happened uh we were all alarmed and I know that I was deeply\nalarmed because something similar had happened before in Switzerland. A Jew with the name of\nFrankfurt (ph) had had shot and killed the representative of the Nazi organization in Switzerland\nby the name of , but at this time the Nazis obviously didn't feel strong enough that they\ncould do anything. Uh so uh but now we knew something would. Also uh uh shouldn't forget\nthat this November's events came after Munich, the all...I remember that I think it was\nSeptember...thought we were somehow on the brink of war in 19...September 1938 under these\nfour, Hitler and Mussolini and and and Chamberlain got together in Munich and\nhammered out the agreement selling out Czechoslovakia to the Nazis and this also uh somehow\ngave the Nazis the feeling that now they were very powerful because actually uh Chamberlain\nhad submitted to them and then he was so foolish when he got back to to London to to wave this\npaper saying that in the morning before he left Munich for London he had another meeting with\nHeir Hitler and this 1s to say the proof that we have peace in our time, so when the November\nevents came, certainly Germany already was in a much stronger political and military situation,\nand for us uh uh it was the indication definitely that that uh the end of the Nazi regime we had all\nhoped for, because we had thought that for economical and political reasons there would be...it\nwould be only be a transitory existence...that this was not true. And I uh uh must say that uh...\nEND OF TAPE 1\n..especially Kristallnacht because it's a Nazi label.",
        "Answer: Yeah. Should I go back to the youth movement first?",
        "Answer: I'm ready.",
        "Answer: Uh before I continue with the events of the November 9th, I think uh it would be\ninteresting to know what kind of a position I had in the youth movement. We call it uh...we were\nnot standing on formalities. We had no statutes and so that no charters didn't exist, but I was a\nmember of the , which we considered the executive and I I belonged to the to the\nleadership of of this group as long as we could...uh we were able to operate which means up till\n1935, and then uh uh uh later as I told you when we were still trying to keep the contacts, it it\nwas in a very informal way. There was no position or special position. Just I was...I...based on\nmy seniority if you want to. I had . Now to go back to the 9th of November. Uh when\nit happened in Paris, I was deeply concerned like all of us and I had a feeling that something was\ngoing to happen, uh something basically that means the Nazis now aware of their power and of\ntheir new won role in the world would say well, we don't take this, and they were whipping up\ntheir propaganda. The headlines were deeply depressing. But there was nothing we could do.\nWe had just to wait and see where where where where where...somehow where...when and\nwhere they would act. On the November 9th, uh I interesting enough, it was a day when I had to\nbe prepared for my final final examination of the welder course and uh then uh in the in the\nmorning when I got out, somebody was in the street I met and said Norbert, the synagogues are\nburning, and I couldn't believe it. And then a he...look at these stores...you know, there were still\nJewish stores...and I saw that uh that uh they were smashed, that the windows were smashed. I\ndidn't hear that during the night, and I couldn't believe this, so uh what I did was I went to my\nsynagogue where I had been married and I saw that the the the the flames were coming out from\nthe roof, from the cupola...beautiful edifice, and the fire engines were standing by doing nothing,\nonly protecting the buildings next to it that the fire shouldn't extend to them. And I still couldn't\nbelieve it. I went to to another synagogue which was a very prominent synagogue in west\nBerlin, , and I saw the same...uh flames coming out and there, however, was already I\ncould see a tremendous amount of destruction. I was standing there and listening to what the\nGermans had to say. There was glee amongst them. Uh you know, they said now they got there\nwhat they deserve and so on, and I asked myself is this the people, uh is this in whose\ncivilization you believe. Is this the people of Gerta and Shiller (ph) and of the German\nphilosophers, the people of the of the philosophers and poets? And and and I simply...I couldn't\ncomprehend it. It was not acceptable for me. I wouldn't say not acceptable. I saw it but I\ncouldn't digest, not not intellectually and not emotionally. And then I went, for instance, to a\nsynagogue where the famous Rabbi Prince (ph) had had uh been, had off...officiated over the\nyears, and there the building was almost completely burned down. The only part which was still\nleft was the lectern from which he had always delivered his very famous and encouraging\nsermons for for the Jews there. Of course, he was a very proud Jew and a very active Zionist.\nSo uh uh and I and and I asked myself 1s this possible. What goes into into people to do these\nthings? Uh I had...my my knowledge was...I had read about pogroms in the Middle Ages 1n in in\nespecially before the Crusaders went to to liberate then Palestine uh uh but and when the Jewish\ncommunities 1n in in especially along the Rhine had been destroyed by these Crusaders before,\nbut still I was...we were living in a modern age, and I really...I had believed in...that was part of\nour education, the goodness of man. Could this be possible? Uh and uh then I went through to\ntake my exam, and uh my then wafe (ph) then wife came to me and said Norbert, you're not\ngoing home. We were at this time still living with my parents in the eastern part of Berlin. I said\nwhy. She said because we heard that the police is going around taking men into custody, so uh\nI've arranged already uh that you will stay with the mother of a friend who had just left for for\nAmerica recently and and she is alone and she would be glad you come so that she feels\nprotected somehow, and I said what about my father. She said also for your father we have made\narrangement to uh to uh to uh take shelter in the apartment of a sister who 1s a widow. And uh\nthat's what we did, uh unaware what what uh what the next step will be. And then the next day\nmore or less we...and I I was going around...I mean you could go around freely. There was no\nrestriction. I saw what what had happened in the main streets of Berlin, uh\n, which were the main business streets where you still had quite a number\nof Jewish stores, retail stores, and they had been smashed and vandalized and the merchandise\nhad been looted. Uh they say that uh I I couldn't control it but...couldn't check it but that, for\ninstance, the ladies of the night had helped themselves to the fur coats out of the of the some of\nthe retail stores on in Berlin. And uh so I spent uh uh a couple of nights outside of my\napartment and uh then uh more and more uh news reached us...and I took cont...tried to contact\nmy other friends and found out that also the uh the uh major administrative buildings of the\nJewish communities had been somehow vandalized, so that uh there was no...there was no\nactivity. That was for quite a number of days and and and and well, I realize now that uh\ncompletely that in this respect the uh the uh saying of my my spiritual leader and rabbi, Leo\n______, who was the senior of of and the leader of uh call it German Jewry, was right when he\nsaid that the historical hour of German Jewry has come to an end. And my question was what\nam I going to do now. Especially I felt new responsibility for my parents, for my sister, who uh\nalso tried to do something to get out of Germany, and uh then something happened uh when uh\nwe heard that _\u2014_\u2014, some of the men had been taken into custody, had been taken away, and we\ndidn't know where. There were friends of mine amongst them and then we found out that\nespecially those men who had been taken into custody in Berlin had been shipped to the\nconcentration camp of Saxonhausen-Orianenburg which was the uh big camp in the north of\nBerlin. And that was all we knew. Uh so uh a couple of days later uh somehow uh the Nazis\nthought that 1t would be right at least to release those people who had been veterans of World\nWar I, and some of them were found walking around in the streets of Berlin, and uh but they\nwere...there was a terrible, terrible appearance because their heads been shaved. Their...the the\nNazis whenever you come to a camp, were delivered into a concentration camp, the first things\nthey did was shave your hair and their clothing was completely crampled (ph) because it had\ngone through a so-called disinfection process, so uh...and then one building of the Jewish\ncommunity had started somehow to operate again, and one of my leaders of the youth movement\nhad immediately uh started to organize some kind of relief for those people who if they had been\ntaken into custody in Berlin, they knew where to go, but many of them had come from cities\noutside of Germany, from northern Germany, from western Germany...those who had not been\ntaken to Buchenwald or Dachau had come especially from places like west Germany or rural\ndistricts and so on. And we organized...and and he organized this kind of relief action and he\ncalled me into that, to uh try to pick up these people who came by railway from the concentration\ncamp into Berlin, and you could recognize them immediately, and to bring them to the Jewish\ncommunity where they uh first of all were treated medically. Some of them had terrible wounds\nbecause of frostbite and so...give them a decent meal, and especially those who had uh come\nfrom other...who originated from cities outside to establish the first telephone contact with their\nfamily. That was part of my work, and that was really...I mean uh call it emotionally rewarding,\nand I said listen, I have here Mr. so and so. He would like to speak to you. And very often you\nheard on the other side an outcry so so uh this kind of work uh uh became became uh uh took on\ntook on very substantial dimensions because more people then were released, and as I say, I\nparticipated in that and to a certain extent also my then wife, because she had also lost her\nposition, and that was nota __, a work from nine to five, and there was...that was not on a\nsalary basis. It was simply...it was just relief work to do what had to be done and also, for\ninstance, to organize that these people could get back...uh had by by by railway to their different\nplaces. Uh and one of the things they they asked uh time and again when these people came, and\nsaid what what what what do you know about about us, what what does the world say? Tell us.\nTell me. What does London and New York and Washington say about this? And uh I must say\nthis was one of the of the questions uh I...we...none of us, myself couldn't answer. We felt very\nbad about it, because certainly luckily we had not...I had not been affected. I had avoided the the\nthe the uh the uh this kind of action and uh when they...when these people asked me and said uh\nfine, you are doing all this work. It's wonderful, but the future is now dark there. I can't...1 mean\nI know that that that my business 1s destroyed or I am not uh entitled to continue in my activities.\nUh we were told uh you will be release...you are being released here from the from the\nconcentration camp under the condition that you leave Germany as quickly as possible, so what\ncan you tell us? And my answer was unfortunately nothing. Certainly uh for those of us who,\nyou know, to to listen to uh radio Strasburg (ph) in in German or to BBC London, it was was\nprohibited and there were very severe penalties, but still it was being done. So the only thing we\nwe...I could also say from the information I had that there were demonstrations in New York and\na big meeting in Madison Square Garden, a tremendous amount of words, uh also but no action.\nNothing. And uh I felt almost lost when when when these questions...and the people were...felt\nlost. Certainly they were they were happy to uh to uh be out of the concentration camps. It\nwas...all of them somehow were under shock, because the treatment they had uh experienced in\nthese camps was torturous. They told us about the details uh where where in also...I mean I had\nheard before what what people had been exposed to when they were taken to Buchenwald or so\nbut but you know, here you heard it for the first ttme from people that had just come back\n(cough) about this this this...the amount of violence to which they had been exposed, so...and the\nbeatings and and standing in in in the cold for hours and hours without...or, for instance, just\nmarching without any sense or or or shoveling uh uh sand from one heap to another and then...I\nmean without any sense. Uh so uh I see in this respect we all felt lost. I felt lost, and uh there\nwas nothing. Even when I discussed it with my wife and my parents, uh there was helplessness,\nabsolute helplessness. And and we we felt lost by the world. Now uh then one evening when I\nwas doing this work, the man who was in charge of that relief operation came to me and said,\nlisten, I have just received a call from the head of the uh central organization of Jews...the name\nwas the of Jews from Germany, which means the representative of the rights of Jews\nin Germany...his name was Otto Hirsch (ph). He also had been taken into a concentration camp,\nhad just returned and he called me and said uh uh...and he was rather emotional...uh there is\nsomething then very new development. Uh believe it or not, the situation of the Jews in\nGermany and Austria, because Austria was also affected by the November events, it has been\ndiscussed in the House of Commons and there is some action under the auspices of the former\nPrime Minister of of England, Baldwin (ph), and Jewish prominent leaders like uh uh Viscount\nSamuel (ph) and and so they have agreed to uh to uh accommodate ten thousand uh uh\noppressed children, Jewish or non-Jewish, but oppressed children so uh uh this is is now to be\norganized also from here, from Germany and uh Mr. Hirsch said well, we have terrific social\nworkers who gradually were flocking back to the office, you know, in order to do work, but they\nneed technical help and this is something you have to do. And I said to him, Martin, excuse me.\nI I'm in the middle of my preparations. I would like to to leave Germany as soon as possible\nbecause we all are in the same situation uh and and and he said yes, but you know that's part of\nour education. There's a job to be done and uh uh in Germany you would call it , in\nother words to do a thing just for the cause and not for the reward. So see...he told me next\nmorning, see uh Otto Hirsch in in in his office and he will tell you all the details, and I came to\nhim. As I say, he was the executive director of all operations, Jewish operations, because we had\na centralized uh organization for that. I knew him because he was the father of a friend who was\nalso in our move...youth movement, now living in in Washington, and he gave me details, telling\nme that (clearing throat) uh he just had been advised that this is what the British government has\nagreed to and to...but no special conditions. The only conditions were children have to be\nhealthy, had to go with the permission of the parents because the parents could not accompany\nthem, and uh had...were restricted to the age of twelve to seventeen because this would be\nconsidered the age where they could be...could go without the accompaniment of their parents\nand and and uh wouldn't create special educational problems. So Otto Hirsch told me uh uh\nkindly help us, because uh our social workers are very devoted and excellent workers but uh\nunfortunately they have no experience in technical matters. I said but I have never done\nsomething like that. Certainly I have participated in the organization of summer camps in\nEngland, and and in Sweden and Denmark. He said still uh kindly help us. I said but don't\nforget I am in the middle of my preparations also to leave Germany, and he said well, uh I can\ngive you my promise that when this will be done and will be successfully done, it will be our\ncommitment and our obligation to help you and your family to get out of Germany. Well, it's a\npromise to which he couldn't live up because uh in early in 1941, I think, he was uh taken again\ninto custody, was shipped to the concentration camp of Mauthausen and murdered there in cold\nblood. So what I did then was, I went to this office where there was a department for children,\nimmigration which ___ had established before because there was a trickle of children uh who\nhad been given the opportunity to go to France, Belgium, Sweden and and America, within the\nquota. And uh I came to that office and uh when I saw what was going on, I almost died. I...my\nstomach turned around, which was certainly can be explained only from the situation we were in.\nUh there was a big conference room in that uh office, covered with uh cards, heaps of cards and\nthere was a desk which was covered with papers and the telephone was constantly ringing and I\nwas given to understand...uh there was a lady who was in charge of it. She had before been uh in\nhigh service under the Prussian government, a Jewish lady, uh had been assistant to one of the uh\nsocial democratic ministers from Prussia, and uh a trained social worker, and she told me that\nsomething has to be done to to organize this properly, and uh after having seen that and having\nrecovered a little bit, the first thing I did was to call in some of my friends, again from the youth\nmovement. We all uh at this time had no...were not gainfully employed in productive work, and\nall purposes more or less lost our positions and uh the first thing I organized were these\ncards...these cards were so called...when I asked what is it...these are permits which had come in\nalready from England to give uh children the the permit to come to England. In other words they\ndidn't need passports and so there were special cards worked out with the cooperation of the\nhome office in England, with a picture and so...which had come from England and then the\nGerman police had certified the the the uh the names and the age and so on, and these were cards\nwhich which gave the young people of that age a license to enter England, so the first thing we\ndid...was I did was, with the help of my friends, to organize these cards in alphabetical order and\nin geographical order in order to have some kind of a of a of an idea what was what, and then it\nwould give me some some working room at the desk and organized the telephone calls to such\nextent that, you know, when, for instance, it happened a telephone call came from a from a\ndesperate parent from anywhere and said what's about the application of my of my of my child,\nand then one of these social workers jumped to that table and they they they fished out of the of\nthat mound of of paper the the the permit, because they said yes, I remember it had arrived this\nmorning or yesterday morning. And as I said, there there was disorder but not...but not |\nbecause they wanted but things were...had had had had...were were in a rush and and and and\nhad overwhelmed them, so uh then I found out that we...i1t was...we...1t was organized in such a\nway that people, that parents were advised in Berlin and the Jewish communities outside of\nBerlin and also under the rules and regulations, they had set already with the with the...believe it\nor not by cooperation with the with the Gestapo, under which the the had to work, that\nuh uh the Jewish communities, the the welfare agencies uh and agencies had to select the\nchildren, which means that the children...the parents who got a way of assist of this project, made\nan application to the proper Jewish communities and then the social workers, the local social\nworkers, then checked the...1f the conditions were right and and then they they made the\napplication. I had nothing to do with that, so what my task was, and I was advised to do that,\nwas to organize the transports so that they could get out of Germany. Now also that was not an\neasy task because we had to live under certain rules and regulations because in order to prepare a\ntransport, you had to prepare the proper lists, the records. One copy had to go to the Gestapo.\nOne copy had to go London in order to advise the people in London that the children were\ncoming and whoever were the prospective foster parents or the the hostels which had to be\nprepared for these people had to be had to be made ready, and all this was done. Certainly there\nwere no faxes and no computer systems and and and when you made...had...the telephones did\nnot uh...there was no push button system. For instance, to make a telephone call to London from\nBerlin could last hours and hours and even within Germany it was not...you know, it was still in\nthe age of...the the age when most of the work or all the work had to be done manually. So\nsomehow this we got under control and I set up a certain...I can't say I because uh I was then I\nwas made responsible for all technical aspects of these transports, so that means uh first of all to\nsee to it that the that the lists were properly prepared, that the parents were were advised uh when\nto when to bring their children to Berlin, especially from eastern or northern uh Germany and\nmiddle Germany, because the starting point was Berlin. Then I had to uh approach the railway\nauthorities to give us reserved coaches, because they couldn't travel with the other public. Uh\nthen a special room had to be made available as an assembly point in a railway station. The local\npolice had to be advised, because uh certainly all this was done under the supervision of the\npolice authorities. Uh then we had...and I...that was also my responsibility to find escorts.\nParents could not go with their children, so we had to find escorts to take them, to take these\nchildren, so again there was the the human resource...of of the young people of the of the of the\nmembers of the youth movement, irrespective as I say, Zionists, non-Zionists, all this\ndisappeared. And we found wonderful people, teachers and and youth leaders and so who who\nvolunteered for that service. Uh and uh at the beginning we were...it was made clear to us that\nuh these escorts could only escort the uh the youngsters to the border, but there was no chance to\ntake them to England. This luckily changed very soon thereafter because we were able to\nconvince the authorities that uh it was in the German interest also to take them up to London, and\nthey agreed under one condition...that all these escorts uh were to return again to Berlin. Now at\nthis time uh starting in the summer of 1938, all Jews who who were holding a German passport\nhad stamped...and irrespective of the Nazi laws, we were still considered German nationals...all\nGerman passports had printed a J into their passports, and when people came back, especially\nafter the November events, to Germany they were taken immediately into custody and shipped\ninto a camp, in a concentration camp, so in order to protect our escorts, the uh Ministry of the\nInterior, the Nazi Ministry of the Interior, gave everyone who who was an escort, they call it\nprotection letter which he could use for the border police to say and it said that so and so, in my\ncase Norbert Israel Wolheim, you know that's my name, was was is is traveling in German\ninterests and should be and so uh we had the first transport under those conditions ready\nin January. And I was instrumental in...that was my first responsibility, and uh together with\nsome friends who were also escorts I uh accompanied this transport to the border which was uh\nBentheim (ph). It was a German...a Dutch border. I also had to inform not only the people in\nEngland but people in Holland, Jewish...the uh the uh relief organizations because they wanted to\nhelp the children when they were traveling through uh Holland because the technical\narrangements were that people...as I said, before came from all kinds...from all cities, assembled\nin Berlin. Then from Berlin the train left, went via Hanover to the border in Bentheim, uh uh\nwent into Holland, uh went from to , Holland where they boarded a ferry and the ferry\ntook these children uh through the Channel or via the Channel to Harwich (ph) in England where\nthey landed in England and they had to undergo immigration uh checks and and customs checks\nand then the train took us from Harwich to London where at Liverpool Street Station, the Jewish\nCommittee of of uh of London had established their reception center where then the parents and\nthe uh the uh officials came and and and distributed the children. This first transport uh uh still\nis very vivid in my memory because when we came to the border, uh the SS guards who were uh\nuh doing custom duties and they were not all of them, or none of them was trained in this\nrespect...they ascended the the the uh coaches and they behaved like vandals. They did not\nattack the children, but they treated the luggage...1t was completely vandalized, the luggage.\nWere tearing it apart looking for jewels and for foreign currency and for things like that.\nCouldn't find a thing, but at least this is what they did, and any attempt to talk to them and so\ncertainly was in vain. And uh then uh it was so bad that they uh separated the coaches with the\nwith the Jewish children from the other train and the train left for Holland and when this train\nwithout the children arrived in Holland, the authorities there were waiting and saw the children\nwere not there. And amongst the people who were serving... mean who were uh the cause was\nwas were two ladies whose name should be remembered in in gratitude. Both non-Jewish. One\nwas uh Ms. Fontaine (ph) and the other Mrs. Weismiller (ph) who even even had dealings with\nthe . Very courageous, wonderful uh lady. She was the uh the uh the wife of a banker, a\nprominent banker in Holland, had no children and had devoted all her time to to help especially\nchildren, Jewish, non-Jewish, and she all of a sudden came from Holland. She had made her\nway from Holland to Bentheim and uh when she saw and she heard what has happened...uh don't\nforget, it was before the beginning of the war...she lashed into these SS people. It was...I was so\ngrateful,and \u2014\u2014_\u2014scone of these SS men, said I have the feeling you don't like us very much and\nshe said well, personally I might but as a group you are impossible. But then, interesting\nenough, by her interventions she...they they stopped their their vandalism. The two coaches\nwere then attached to a later train which still made in time for the ferry and we then uh uh were\nable, as I tried to explain before, to get the permission of the of the Department of the Interior to\nget passports to take these children to to to to England. Now to select these people was a very uh\nuh uh difficult thing and I felt the responsibility because certainly everybody uh who had a\nchance to go to England certainly looked for a chance, and there were friends or relatives\npressing on them and said are you stupid to go back, but this was the condition, and they\nhad...the the Nazis had told us in no uncertain term that if people would not uh obey their order,\nthen these these transports would come to an end and this certainly we could not afford. So as I\nsay, I was very, very careful in the selection of those people and thank God with the exception of\none case, it worked. Now we had uh uh uh approximately I think twenty, twenty transports uh\nwhich left Berlin. Uh it was my duty to see all of them off, and I was uh uh uh every morning\nwhen they came together, I was there to to arrange it, so uh uh whether I went with the transports\nor not, that was 1n a in a big hall in in in call it Berlin, and also part of my duties were\nto see to it that the children came to Berlin 1n time so that they were pre...and certainly they came\nwith their parents or their relatives and this was then the uh the the moment of their goodbye, so\nuh there was a problem uh with the first transports which...for which I had not been responsible.\nA smaller group had left in in in December I think, and the parents had accompanied these\nchildren to the to the trains and certainly parents in good faith they try to get the best window\nseats for for their children, and there was a certain turmoil and the police told us in no uncertain\nterms that if this would be repeated, they would control all the all all these arrangements. We\nwere able to convince them that we will take over, that we will see to it that order should prevail\nand that they shouldn't interfere, that they could be present if they want to, not _ present fine\nbut they shouldn't interfere. And I think it worked. So uh when in the morning when when\nwhen such a transport was due to to leave, as I say, I was there and uh it was a very, very, very...I\nremember that very distinctly the atmosphere, you know. It was...there was tension in the air.\nThere was an atmosphere of expectation. There was concern by the parents. There were...there\nwere kiss...there were tears of laughter and tears of of joy and and the concern and pain and it\nwas a very, very special atmosphere which was difficult to describe. And then when the when\nthe hour of departure came closer, I uh ascended a a chair, some kind of a lecture, and told the\nparents...ladies and gentlemen, the time has arrived to say goodbye, because we are under strict\norder not to let you accompany your children to the platform. The escorts will take over and the\nbaggage handlers had to do their work before to to handle the baggage, but you cannot come and\ndon't...please uh cooperate and don't make our our work more difficult. But this is the time you\nhave to say goodbye. And there were, you know, last kisses and last hugs and and and and...but\nin general I still admire these people, how courageous they were. Nobody broke down, but also\nthere was the expectation that uh sooner or later they would be reunited again. Very often I\nasked myself the question later, where did I take the courage to do that you call it ;\nwhere where from? I was young. I was only twenty-five in these days, and I thought uh uh that\nthis is a job to be done in order to help these children and I also I must say that at this time I and\nnobody else could have thought for a moment that this would for many, for almost ninety\npercent, the last goodbye. Nobody could expect that let us say a year and a half later after these\ntransports had rolled to the west into freedom, that transports would leave for the east into the\ninto the slaughterhouses of Hitler in Auschwitz or or Treblinka. I said nobody could\nforesee it in the worst of of of your vision, and then uh thus I I say this probably also...yes, gave\nme the justification to say to these parents and many I talked to to the children who were safe...I\nsaid that this is a moment, one of the most important moments 1n their lives which they still\nremember vividly, and I was involved in that. But I came to terms with that by saying this is the\ncontribution which which which we had to make and in the long run, at least for these children, it\nturned out for the good. And uh when we landed in in England, uh we were uh helped...the the\nJewish Committee was then the Bloomsbury (ph) House in in England which cooperated with\nthe . It was the central headquarters of the board of Jewish deputies in England and\nand helped us to stay in England for two days or two...two and a half days. I had...constantly I\nhad uh uh discussions with my counterpart in the in the Committee there to streamline\noperations, to uh...also there were certain requirements in England which had to be obeyed and\nthere was always...I didn't have too much time in England to see friends or relatives though I\ntried to manage somehow, and also I had the privilege...the other escorts on their way back had\nto take the train. I had the privilege to uh to uh to take the...to fly back which at this time was\nstill a big thing, but since I was needed in Ber...Berlin so badly, I, as I say, I could fly back. We\ndid not see where the children were going because we didn't have the time. Our job had ended\nthe moment we handed them over to the committee at Liverpool Street Station and they were\nthen uh uh acquainted with their foster parents or or or the families they took them in or the\nhostels. Only one transport I took uh uh from London up to the north of England. That was the\ntransportof _, of trainees for for for then Palestine, because uh Lord Balfour (ph), the\nfather of the Balfour decoration, who had no children, had made his castle in in Scotland, near\nthe \u2014__ near Edinburgh, available to the Jewish agency and the Jewish agency had used one of\nhis janitor homes or so to establish a kibbutz there where the young people were educated uh for\nand prepared for for Palestine and uh I think a group of ten or twelve of mainly boys I took to\nthat place because I wanted to see what was going on, but that was the only time when I was\nreally...at this time when I became familiar with the conditions of the children we are taking to\nEngland. Certainly later I've seen a lot of literature about these events. I saw the problems, the\ntremendous problems, and I think this should be made part of of history because uh uh first of\nall, it 1s part of the Holocaust history but I would also say it is something which which for which\nwe have to express gratitude to England. After all, when they discussed it and when they\npromulgated this this project, they were still somehow under the influence of Chamberlain's\npolicy of appeasement and uh nevertheless under the impact of the events in Germany, especially\nin November, uh uh they came to the conclusion that we want to do something. They did not uh\nmake uh uh work out charters to see after so many years the children have to go back or they\ncan't stay longer. Nothing of this respect was said. Just England wanted to give shelter to these\npeople...to these children to to to uh to save them from oppression and in this respect I am using\na word, when I talked about it before, of of the man I admire so much, Winston Churchill, when\nhe said that even this was England's finest hour, and should recognize that and I think we...to\nrepeat it we should make it a part of the record even here in Washington in the Museum in my\nopinion, because this belongs to the to the to the successful action and reaction of the rescuers.\nUh the last transport which left Berlin was prepared uh in the end of August. It was supposed to\nleave Berlin on September Ist. I was supposed to go because there were certain uh problems\nwhich had come up and which had to be discussed with our people in London. I had my\npassport. I had my protection letter. I had my ten marks in foreign currency. More we were not\nallowed to have, but certainly the the the war fever developed into a pitch and uh then we were\nbombarded from England with a request to try to somehow uh change the date of the departure to\nan earlier date, and it took tremendous efforts to do it because all the children and all the parents\nhad to be notified and things had to rearrange, so anyhow we were able to to to uh uh to uh have\nit, to change the departure date from September Ist to August 29, and I decided then uh on\naccount of the situation not to be the leader of that transport because uh my then wife was in\nBerlin and I and my parents and my sister and I felt responsibility and and I was concerned that\nif something would happen, especially if a war will come, I will be cut off and I I felt that uh uh I\ncould not have done this toward my family and this is the reason why I was caught in Germany.\nThe transport luckily left uh Germany on the 29th, had difficulties to uh get through Holland.\nHolland had already mobilized. Uh there were no boats available at the beginning, but also with\nthe help of our people in Holland in the last minute they found a ferry, ferrying these children to\nEngland and when they arrived in Harwich they they...England had already...was already in a\nstate of a blackout, so they came to England or I would say on the eve on the war. They...I think\nthey landed on the...on September Ist or 2nd, before England had declared war but Germany had\nalready entered...start military operations against Poland. That was the end of the uh of the\nproject. From Germany we had uh been able to get out between six or seven thousand children.\nUh Austria also a couple of thousand. As I said before, we we we didn't have any contact with\nAustria. We were not allowed to corroborate with them, so that was extra, extra operation and\nuh then after that, still a few transports, small transports, left for Denmark, for instance,\n, for training there, but that was all. The the the the children immigration stopped by\nthe beginning of the war and that was the end of that.",
        "Answer: I said from Germany approximately seven thousand.",
        "Answer: Uh, no, because uh uh, you know, don't forget these were thousands of children. I I\nremember certain certain uh children. I I remember the grandchildren of Rabbi who who\nwere taken to England so uh uh but I never met them after the war anymore, but it so happened\nthat not too long ago, uh I addressed a group of children, kinder (ph) they call themselves, in Los\nAngles and a man with grey hair came to me and said, you must have been my uh leader of the\ntransport in February 1939. And I said yes, I do, because that was the first transport I took from\nBerlin to London, and this is true. I certainly didn't recognize him anymore, and uh then at the\nsame evening a lady came to me and said, and you must have been my my leader in April 1939,\nand I told her it must have been approximately on April 18th or so\nand she said, yes, but how do you remember, and I said I remember that when I flew back uh it\nwas Hitler's birthday on April 20th, and the Germans had illuminated the the major uh avenues\nof Berlin, so when I flew back and I had that privilege, the pilot would do us a favor to show the\nspectacle of Berlin, seeing this this sea of of of of of light from the air, and I think I came back\non on April 21st, and and , and by the way uh this was also little little little...1t is not\nrevenge but but call it satisfactions I always had when I landed in in in in in Berlin, the airport at\nthis time was on which was...the airport which was used during the bridge...the air\nbridge, and when I landed there and I met the uh the border police and there was a fellow, you\nknow, almost out of a opera with a with a with a like with a big metal\nshield and all kinds of things put on there, and I showed him my passport and he thought already\nhe had caught one of those who could become his uh customers, and then very very slowly I took\nmy letter out and show it to him and he couldn't quite grasp it and he said one moment please,\nbecause he had to go to his superior to verify that this is genuine and so on and then he let me go,\nto his regret, so that was a certain...call it a certain amount of satisfaction.",
        "Answer: Oh yeah, because uh because as...before the war, there was correspondence and some\nof these children then, and it was one of the first things they did, was that they uh uh asked their\nfoster parents to help them to get the uh the uh the parents out. In certain cases they were\nsuccessful, but I would say between eighty or ninety percent were not, and then you had the\nsituation that when the war broke out, you could only communicate via the International Red\nCross. And uh that took a long time, but it worked at the beginning but then starting with the\ndeportations, these letters didn't arrive anymore from from Germany and the children, you know,\nare quite desperate the events slowly realized that something must have happened, but\nthey became fully aware of the situation only after the end of the war when the truth came out.\nUh you might ask me if I have special...special memories of that. Uh there are two stories I like\nto tell because they are so very interesting and typical. One was uh in the summer of 1939, uh\nwe were advised by the British government through the House and Bloomsbury House\nthat we should...ought to be careful with the import of merchandise which could be used for\ncommercial use. What does it mean? Since uh you couldn't take out funds from Germany...we\nall were restricted to just ten marks...uh certainly parents and other groups which who uh tried to\nget out, took with them whatever they could...uh jewelry if there was the permission to do it, but\nalso uh expensive cameras and and so on and these cameras or uh music instruments and so had\nfound their way into the uh uh British market and the Chamber of Commerce in England had\nbrought it to the attention of the government that they considered it unfair competition because,\nyou know, when the people came there with no money, they sold it for whatever they could get\nfor it. So uh we advised the parents accordingly and tried and hoped that...so on one of these\noccasions when I was the transport leader, we came to Harwich and uh then all of a sudden I\nheard a a voice, my name, Mr. Wolheim, and there was a customs official and I asked him what's\nthe problem, and my English, thank God, was good enough, I mean my schooling which was\ngood enough to communicate with him...uh what's the problem? He said, sir, we have a problem\nhere because we just found that this this boy or this this lad has has a has a...is carrying a violin.\nI said what's wrong with a violin? He said, it's not an ordinary violin. It's a very valuable violin.\nUh certainly it was not a Stratovarious (ph) or or or , but it was a\nvaluable violin, so I said, sir, but most probably the parents gave this to the boy because he liked\nmusic, and uh this was probably his violin before so he took it along, and he took it along\nbecause he liked music. I didn't know that the boy was able to play. So he looked at him and he\nsaid...then in order to save the situation I said, why don't we let him play something so that you\ncan be...uh see that this is something which actually belongs to him. He said that's a good idea.\nAnd that fellow started to play, and you know I was very nervous because I didn't know would it\nsucceed or not, so he started to play and all of a sudden everything around that boy and us\nbecame very quiet and I didn't realize at the first moment what had happened, and then I came to\nto to realize that he had started to play \"God Save the King,\" and because of that, you know, the\ncustoms officials couldn't continue to operate, so I started...tried to stop him but he was playing\nall three stanzas. When he was finished and I felt better and asked, sir, are you now convinced\nthat this boy loves music. He said, oh yes, thank you very much. And the other story I like to\ntell is uh, you know, we were under a very strong regulations to see to it that only children up to\nthe age of seventeen were coming in, and we checked the the uh records carefully and the cards\nback and forth and we thought everything was fine. On one of these transports when I was the\nleader, you know, when when when when you got to uh to uh , Holland and put...and\nthe children boarded the ferry, we put the children to to sleep. They had certain bunks and so\nwe, the the escorts started to work in the lounge in order to pre...prepare for the next morning\nbecause we wanted to be as helpful as possible to the immigration authorities not to have any\nhitchup. So still working on that and uh we were treated very, very nicely by the crew of that\nferry and that was really, in comparison to Germany, was a wonderful thing. In the middle of\nthat a friend of mine, was an escort, came to me and said, Norbert, we have a problem here. I\nsaid what's the problem? He said look at the card. I said what is it. He said that boy is is is\nis...has passed his seventeenth birthday. He's eighteen years old. I said let me said again, and\nsure it was true. So I knew we had a problem. I said let me see...let us ask the boy. So they\nbrought the boy out of his bunk and when he came, I almost...I almost fainted because he had\njust been released from a concentration camp. His hair was shaven and obviously he realized\nthat something was wrong and he was shaking likea_\u2014\u2014_\u2014s*bbonee. So we asked him when were\nyou born, and sure enough, he was eighteen years old. So we went into a huddle with the other\nother members of our escorts and there were two opinions. One was to throw ourselves at the\nmercy of the immigration officer the next morning and say sorry, but that would mean that uh he\nhad to obey his rules and regulations and had eventually had to send him back and if he would\nhave been...1f they would send him back that was the end of him because they would take him\nback into a concentration camp immediately, and there was the other group, and I was one of\nthem, who said well, the only thing is effectively is to say it was a mistake made by the German\npolice, and they entered the the date that they made up...that they changed the...the the date they\nput in was was wrong, but we had to tell the boy that this was it, and made him our ally, so uh he\nrealized that and we said listen, you are not born in this year. You are born one year later. You\nunderstand that. He said very well. And we...also one of our friends who was a teacher said you\nknow what we should do it is we should somehow try to program him that even in the middle of\nthe night we should ask him when were you born, so that when the question will come up in\nEngland that he can...that he will not stutter and and and stumble but will say it. OK. We landed\nin Harwich, all tired, dead tired, uh went through the usual process. All of a sudden I hear, Mr.\nWolheim, kindly see the immigration officer...\nEND OF TAPE 2\n...what's the problem. He said well uh I cannot admit this young man uh because uh he is\neighteen years old and you know very well that uh under the uh rules and regulations adopted he\ncannot be older than seventeen years. So I said well, ask the boy, and when the boy came, you\nknow, and he was shaking and he sort of...hair was shaven...that officer also I mean somehow uh\nfainted. Something had to be done, so uh uh uh uh how do you explain this. I said it must have\nbeen a mistake by the German police. He said but the German police is well known and almost\ninfamous for their accuracy. I said yes, but today under the Nazi regime, they brought in a lot of\npeople who came in just for the party affiliation and not for the efficiency and and bureaucratic\nwork. He said is that so. I said definitely. So he again looked at the card, he looked at this boy\nand there was a moment of silence and and and really I felt...I felt...1 mean this was the moment\nwhere we...a decision had to be made about the life of a human being and then he said to me, sir,\ncould you guarantee that this is a mistake of the German police, and I said by all means. Now he\nknew that I was lying and I knew that he knew that I was lying, but then he took a stand,\nadmitted to the United Kingdom, because he knew that if not, something terrible could have\nhappened to him, so this uh...he saved his life.",
        "Answer: Well, the second story I would like to tell because it had a very interesting, human\naspect is uh under the rules and regulations, uh we were not allowed to bring in children over the\nage of uh seventeen and uh therefore we we not only prepared the uh papers and the lists, we\nchecked carefully everything so that we shouldn't have any problems coming to England. On\none of the transports uh when I was the leader of that group uh uh we had a problem because uh\nusually we uh when we landed in in...when we got to uh , Holland, we put the children\ninto their bunks and the ferries then took us from , Holland, to Harwich which was a trip\nof approximately six hours, sometimes a very rough crossing of the Channel, but for us, for the\nescorts, uh there was no time to relax because we had to prepare our lists and our papers for the\nnext morning for the landing in Harwich and in England in order to make it easy for the\nimmigration, to help them. So we were sitting in a lounge uh doing this kind of work, treated\nnicely by the crew of that ferry to tea and cookies uh and all of a sudden a friend of mine\napproached me and said uh uh...who was also an escort...said there is a problem. I said what's\nthe problem. He said this boy here has passed his seventeenth birthday. He is definitely\neighteen years old. I said I can't believe it. He said look at this. So I looked at this and sure\nenough, found out and had confirmed that he had completed his seventeenth birthday, so the\nquestion was how to handle the situation, and there were two opinions. One was to throw\nourselves at the mercy of the immigration officer and tell him that there was a mistake, an honest\nmistake, and appeal to his uh uh sense of fairness, 1f you want, which certainly uh could\nendanger the boy because uh he could say no, I am not allowed uh to to admit him. But first I\nsaid, let us see the boy who it is. Uh we asked the boy to come down from his bunk, and when I\nsaw him I almost fainted because it turned out that he had just been released from a\nconcentration camp. His head was shaven and he was shaking uh because he realized that\nsomething was wrong. We asked him how old are you and sure enough, the uh date reflected on\nthis card was correct. He was already eighteen years old. So as I told you, for in this\ndeliberation what to do, the group uh...the one group uh thought we should we should inform and\nstick with the date and and let it pass, hoping that the immigration would have mercy on us, and\nthe other group, and I belonged to them, thought it would be easier to say that the Germans had\nmade a mistake when then entered the birth date, but also tell the boy that he has to lie in his own\ninterest, and the boy understood this very well. So we told him that that was...the majority then\ncame to the conclusion they uh try to convince immigration of a mistake. And one of our\nescorts, a teacher, said well, we have to try to program this boy, even during the night have to\nwake him up to tell that he has to confirm that he is one year younger than the paper says. We\ncame to Harwich. Didn't take long. Uh I was called...Mr. Wolheim to immigration office. I\nwant to see you. What's the problem? He said sir, we have a problem, the immigration officer\nsaid, because uh I cannot admit this this lad, he said, because he is over seventeen years. I said I\nI can't believe it. I said ask him, so that boy came, shaking, pale, but when the immigration\nofficer saw him with his shaven head, somehow happened to him...I could feel, I could see it...so\nhe asked me what is your explanation here. I said uh the police made a mistake and he said well,\nthe German police is not known for easily making mistakes, and my reaction was to tell, well the\npolice is not the same police you are knowing from the old days. Many Nazis just on account of\nparty affiliation have entered the service and they are not of the same quality as before, and I'm\nfully convinced that is so what the boy said, that he is seventeen years old, so he looked at me\nand he looked at the boy for quite some time and I...1t was minutes uh uh just sounded like\neternity and then he turned to me and said sir, can you guarantee the fact that the German police\nhas a mis...has made a mistake, and immediately I answered yes sir. I can do it. So he knew that\nI was lying, and I knew that he knew that I was lying. He looked again at the boy, took a stand,\nand stamped admitted to the United Kingdom and in this way he saved a human life.",
        "Answer: Well, when the war broke out we uh we uh uh...when I say we I mean it means also\nmyself...lived with the expectation that they might do something, the Nazis, take us into to labor\ncamps ___, being afraid that uh we might endanger the German war efforts, who knows. All\nkind of crazy things were possible, but but nothing happened. I continued my work uh for the uh\ncentral office in in Berlin, for the Central Jewish Office in Berlin, for a certain while. We had\nstill a couple of small transports going to Denmark, to the __ center, but this fizzled out soon,\nand then I was asked to take over the administration of the vocational training uh schools, uh the\nthe...this organization uh had set up, especially outside of Berlin...carpentry, plumbing, metal\nwork and so on. These were very good schools uh uh and let...by Jewish and non-Jewish\nteachers. Helped very much uh children to acquire vocational training, and so I also had to travel\nto a certain extent in Germany which was not easy at this time but I still...1t was it was possible.\nAnd uh then uh uh in in the summer of '41, uh in the course of the uh events and especially uh\nafter uh uh...after uh Germany was successful in Poland and in France and in in in Norway, and\nhad taken over all these countries and occupied them, uh there started what we called the the\nfinal solution also in Germany, especially in Berlin, and uh then I came to the conclusion that uh\nit's better to stay away from work in the central office because there was nothing we could do\nany more for our for our Jewish people, and I had the the feeling and I want to be careful in this\nrespect, that we more or less uh would be in the danger to be more helpers to the Nazis than than\nto do what what was necessary to do in the Jewish interest, though I realized fully that all these\nleaders, devoted men, most of them had become martyrs, tried to do their best to save Jewish\nlives, but uh uh there was nothing anymore to be done, so I decided to to become separated from\nthe work for the for the rest...___ call them...of Jews in Germany and I uh uh had to uh report to\nan office which distributes uh distributed uh Jewish workers in in...for forced labor. In other\nwords, the uh Jews who had lost their jobs and who could not work any more in in in offices and\nso they were drawn into all kinds of work, digging work, transport work, uh uh factory work,\nwhatever it was, because also on account of the uh disappearing manpower of of Germany, they\nneeded us for this. That's what we thought. So uh I was uh uh...I reported that I was a welder, so\nI was uh then uh sent to a firm, to a German firm in Berlin uh which had a Jewish group which\nmeans at this time uh Jews could not work as individuals. Jews could only work in groups and\nthe people who had taken on these groups had to provide special facilities, special toilets and so,\nso that Jews and non-Jews didn't mix. And uh this group I I joined certainly not voluntarily but\nbut uh the special problem was that this was a factory which was located in the eastern part of\nBerlin, uh the northeastern part of Berlin. I was living at this time on the west and it was a long\nway to the factory and I had to get up between four thirty and five o'clock in the morning in\norder to make it on time. Uh this was also the time when the first uh air raids started of the\nBritish air uh air force against Berlin, so uh during the so-called alarms, when I was at home we\nwere...had to take shelter in a basement. Jews were separated there also from from non-Jews and\nlater we realized that these basements certainly didn't give any kind of protection, but this is\nactually what was done. But also in that factory, uh Jews were were pressed into service uh for\nfor as...not air raid wardens but uh uh uh a group to uh to uh fight fires or whatever it 1s if\nsomething should happen, so that uh very often I didn't come home uh uh for for almost two\ndays, didn't know what was going on at home. Uh in in in November '39, by the way, uh my\nwife and I had our child...a boy was was born and uh since we had not uh...yeah...I forgot to tell\nthat certainly at the beginning of the war, Jews were not allowed anymore to have a telephone or\nhave radio, so I was not...was not was not able to communicate with them, so uh so uh uh that\nmeans very often, especially after an air raid and if it was a heavy air raid, I didn't know what\nhappened to my family and my family didn't know what happened to me, and uh then in the\nsummer of '41, there started what we called the final solution. Uh we...in Berlin the head of the\nJewish community was called to the Gestapo and he was told that (clearing throat)...excuse\nme...that for a thousand people uh apartments should be made available uh and uh the uh the\npeople should uh should assemble in a synagogue uh and not be accommodated at another place.\nNow I think I overlooked one thing, that uh also in September '41 there started...laws were\npromulgated to force Jews to wear a yellow badge, and from this time on...that was September\n'41. By the way, it was also the time when no immigration was possible from Germany\nanymore. Even during the war in the first part, there was still certain possibilities to come to\nAmerica via Portugal or later after the campaign in Poland, via Siberia, by train through\n, but in September '41 this this was over and uh what I'm also sorry I forgot to say that\nwe tried very hard but the German...the American Consulate uh with which I was registered uh\nasked us very late to uh to uh to uh get our papers, our affidavits, but that was not easy to get in\nAmerica and also the the Consulate stopped very early to process applications. It also set\nconditions which were impossible. More can be read about this in the book of David\nabout the abandonment of the Jews. The American bureaucracy at this time was not very helpful\nto save people it could have saved. Now uh in connection with the with the promulgation of the\nlaws about the about the yellow badge, there uh other restrictions started. We were not allowed\nanymore to uh to use certain streets. We were not allowed to uh to uh to buy and to go shopping,\nonly at certain hours. We certainly...we couldn't see a movie or our theater and uh uh any...we\nwere were also...we had to to place the Star of David at the outside of our of our doors in the in\nthe apartments. So life became became became more and more uh difficult, almost impossible.\nWe still tried to uh get to...I, for instance, saw friends if possible and we uh we uh...and my\nparents lived in the easter part of Berlin and we, as I said before, in the western part and certainly\nmy parents were very much interested and also the parents of my wife, to see our boy but uh\nwhen we were not allowed to uh to uh use the public transportation, we even walked that way\nwhich was two and a half or three hours. Now at the beginning we did it. Later we did it under\nthe protection of darkness which was dangerous, uh uh hiding the Star and then at least to give\nour parents to see to see us and and the boy (clearing throat) because uh uh communications over\nthe telephone and so didn't exist. Uh in in the course of of of that time, the restrictions became\nbecame became became more uh rigid and also then uh to come back to that order to the heads of\nthe Jewish community, not to make room for the people who had to uh make their apartments\navailable, to provide them with other shelter...there started the first deportations to the east. Uh\nwe were not fully aware what...and I I uh uh uh tried to get information wherever I could, but uh\ndon't forget that at this time you had no public press anymore. Uh uh the press was completely\ncontrolled. There were no letters to the editor or free speech or free writing and so and certainly\nthe press did not report about anything like that so 1t were mostly rumors you had follow in in\norder to find out what was going on, but the deportations started first with the with the\ndeportations of elderly people who were not uh in the in the...part of the forced labor program,\nbecause they considered them as uh as disposable and so transports went to first to to the ghetto\nin Lodz, or what they called, what they called, the Germans, and other places like\nRiga, Kovno, Minsk, and some of these transports, as we know from from from information\nlater, never arrived. I uh uh uh...it's difficult to say how did I react. I know we were exposed to\na development over which we had no control. I realized that uh all my attempts to save myself\nand my family, or to save my family and myself had been in vain and, therefore, we we had to\ntake whatever, whatever...I can...only had to hope that uh the military operations would result in\na defeat of Germany and that only in the course of that defeat we could hope to be free again, so\nthat means all our...1t was my thinking about survival was to see that that uh Germany was\ndefeated. Uh certainly there were, especially at the beginning, uh many of our friends and\nsomehow we still tried to meet and exchange uh information about the military situation and so\nwe were convinced that Germany was invincible, and there was not only of...then when you read\ntoday the the reports which came out from the father of of Joe Kennedy, he also thought more or\nless that uh uh uh the western world 1s...and Russia is defeated and that uh Germany will be will\nbe victorious. Uh but we uh...I pers....personally must say uh I was a great believer in in in\nwhatever Churchill said. Not whatever, but but his way of of telling the the people, you know,\nwe will we will never surrender. We will fight at the beaches. We will fight wherever we...we\nwill never surrender. This gave me hope. Also my expectation that one day uh public opinion in\nin America, which was rather isolationist, might change and become aware that Germany is not\nonly a danger for Europe but also for for for America in the long run, so uh and also that that\nespecially after Germany uh attacked Russia, that there was a certain parallel for anybody who\nknew history, that when Napoleon tried to uh to uh to fight Russia, that was end of his of his\nEmpire, so I I was convinced that uh in spite of all the the military might Germany had\ndeveloped, that uh uh it could not last. The question only was how long? And in this respect\nalso I...how did did Iknow. We were cut off from the world. We we couldn't see uh uh any any\nnews objectively. Whatever we saw in the headlines...and by the way we were not even allowed\nto to buy a paper. A neighbor of mine brought me a paper once in a while, but that was all\nregulated and uh only the suc...the success was reported but defeat were not. But uh\nthen when I was in in this in this labor gang, if I may call it, and uh the attacks by the air force\nbecame stronger after Hitler had proclaimed and ___ had proclaimed already that the British\nwere defeated. It gave me no hope, and my wife also the same way, that in the long run uh uh uh\nthere must come a turn, and uh then uh especially when when when the military uh events uh\nchanged the whole situation by the defeat of Rommel in Africa and especially after the defeat of\nStalingrad. Uh this gave me a tremendous hope and gave all of us a tremendous hope, but this\nwas a time already when one transport after the other left, for instance, Berlin, and the question\nwas how long will it...when when when will when will the sword come down on us. Uh I had uh\nuh in this labor gang in which...where we were working, there was one member, a Jewish fellow\nwho worked with us, who was uh what we called a privileged Jew. That means he didn't have to\ncarry the the yellow badge, the Star of David, because he was married to a non-Jewess and their\nchildren were educated as as uh Christians, so he had still the right to uh to keep a radio, and\nwith him we could arrange...I say with him, with some friends in that labor gang, that during the\nnight he should get up and certainly that was something which was uh...the threat of death\npenalty if he would be caught...to listen to BBC London and and and to the German service to\nfind out what the situation was. He did it under the condition that we would provide him in the\nblack market with with coffee because he said when he had to get up during the night and he\ncouldn't find sleep immediately, in the morning he was dead tired so he needs real coffee in order\nto survive the day. This we could do. And I I...I said I was one of them who was instrumental in\nthis, so every morning when we came, he whispered to us what he had heard during the night,\nand in this respect uh we, or I was fully familiar with the progress of uh the Russian army in\nStalingrad and of the other defeat of the 6th German army under __ in Stalingrad and\nespecially when when when it came to an end with the with the loss of approximately three\nhundred thousand German soldiers, so the question came, how long will they be able? Would\nthat mean the end of it and how fast would would the end came. Uh but uh uh on the other hand,\nuh the the the Nazis, in spite of of uh these military developments, continued with their\ndeportations. In December 1942, my parents were deported. Uh I was...on the way home I tried\nto to see them. Then I was told that uh uh the Gestapo had come, had taken them on short notice.\nUh later I found out that they were in a collection center which was in the former Jewish old age\nhome. I was able to get them some food, prayer book and so on, but then in a short time they\nwere...this uh uh home was was cleaned out and later then I found out that my parents, blessed\nmemory, were were in one of the first transports which went from Berlin directly, directly to\nAuschwitz, and certainly in Auschwitz uh uh uh they they obviously got murdered the the first\nuh moment when they arrived.",
        "Answer: When they were taken? Certainly I felt lost and and and call it depressed, but still I\nmust say my my power of resistance was still there because I had...together with my wife, we\nhad...call it we made a pledge, call it an oath, whatever it 1s...that we will not try...we will not\ngive in, that whatever the circumstances, we will try to to to hold out. And and and uh uh though\nwe we have no means to communicate with the outside world, with relatives and friends left in\nthe western world, and so being alone and and but still uh this spark of life was still there, that uh\nin spite of everything that we will try to to remain alive, last not least to tell the tale, to tell our\nstory later. Still we didn't know at this time about Auschwitz, so when I came to the apartment\nand and a neighbor of my parents told me, told us, certainly I I] was I was shocked. More than\nshocked, and and and it was almost...uh it didn't sink in immediately, that this...that I would\nnever see them again, and that this this was the last...when they were when they were taken\naway, we couldn't manage to see them in the old age home, because this was closely guarded by\nthe by the SS, so uh it didn't occur to me immediately, but certainly it affected me, but I said to\nmyself I do not like to to that this bad news, the terrible news should overcome you or should\nshould should paralyze me. I would like...I would I would try whatever I can to survive, to\nsurvive this monster, and uh uh I think this 1s the spirit which which certainly I've tried to carry\nforward and also later, so uh when when...that was in December uh and then I think it was early\nin February, after the defeat in in in Stalingrad, made a speech to which I listened\ninofficially, because as I told you, we were one of the last to have a radio...when he said well, uh\nuh certainly Stalingrad could not deny that this was some kind of a defeat, but now uh it...the\ntime has come for the totalitarian...total war and uh the time has come also to uh to uh uh make a\nfinal uh...to to get even with the with the domestic enemy, with the internal enemy, and he used a\ncertain expression which is , which means now uh people arise and storm uh uh\nuh...start in other words to uh to uh...like like uh I think it was as a parallel in history like uh in\nParis in 1870 when the the ___ I think they call it...to to have an uprising of the people in order\nto save Hitler and the the regime. And uh soon thereafter, and I was still working in that labor\ngang and it was still , and though America had entered already the war, uh we didn't feel\nthe effect of it immediately because they had to get installed in England and they had started\nwith the first air raids, but not towards Berlin. Uh and then my sister was also supposed to be\ndeported but since she was a (clearing throat) skilled stenographer and writer, they took her out\nto do secretarial service in the collection center, so she was able to help me to get something to\nmy parents there. Uh and then we were...uh one transport after the other left Berlin. Some\ncards...post cards, interesting enough, arrived from the people who had managed to throw post\ncards out of their wagons and none of them certainly knew exactly where they were going. We\nheard rumors about uh...and I heard rumors about uh uh events in Poland, about the the attack,\nabout the ghettos, about the murder uh uh...the uh killing actions in in these areas, but don't\nforget (clearing throat) that all this could not be confirmed. This was just to the same extent that\nI asked my friend who listened to to to the radio, to BBC, what does BBC London say, and he\nsaid uh nothing. There is a certain uh uh uh appeal or certain address which was delivered by\nwhere he indicated that uh Jews were taken away from France and so, but no hard facts\nare available, and uh I also uh still had contact with my people of the of the Jewish organization,\nand when I had a chance I saw the head of that, at this time was Paul Epstein (ph) and we\nexchanged some more information, but all the information only said that there is a turn, but but\nwe came to the conclusion (clearing throat) for the Jewish situation in Germany, it anyhow might\ncome too late. And uh uh then in in uh at the end of February, early in March, uh from one day\nto the other, Berlin was was...there there started...there was...came the end of the so so-called\nfinal solution. The SS, interesting enough, the elite SS called the of Hitler,\noccupied in the morning all factories where Jews were working in these groups, and certainly for\nthem it was easy to get to to them, because they were working in groups. I for one reason or the\nother had been advised the night before...said stay home. You never know what's going on, and I\nwas staying home, and uh then uh a neighbor came running and said I just heard they have taken\naway my husband. He was working there and there and don't know where he 1s. It's terrible.\nWhat is your...what what what can you do? There's nothing. You just have to to wait and see.\nSo I tried to read and to to to to even write a letter to a friend in Sweden, because with Sweden\nthere was still...since it was neutral uh you could have still uh an exchange of letters though it\nwas censored, so uh uh and then uh uh in the afternoon of that day, two uh uh policemen who\nwere members of the Gestapo came and told us that uh uh we we are under custody and we uh\nwe uh in ten minutes we should leave. Now in connection with all these transports, my then wife\nuh had prepared a knapsack with all kinds of things we thought would be helpful when we would\ngo to the east to some kind of a labor camp and so what we expected, and had some some uh\nunderwear and some books and the bible and and a chess set and so on, and certainly things for\nthe for the boy, and uh had that ready so in order to grab it whenever whenever the occasion\nwould arise. And uh as I say in that afternoon they came, and gave us ten minutes and my son\nwas sleeping, so we managed somehow to...we all, after all, spoke the same language, to tell\nthem after all we have to get him ready and should give us some time and uh with some\nhesitation they said alright, we'll wait. To talk to them was almost impossible. Uh uh I tried but\nuh I knew it was dangerous because for these were people who were fanatic Nazis and and and\nthey took...uh take out their wrath against you on the spot. They had the right to kill you on the\nspot and nobody...nobody would would take them uh to court for that. So uh then we took our\nknapsacks and we took our son and and and then we went down. We were living in an in an\napartment in the back of a big building and uh uh when we came down we saw a truck uh\nsurrounded by SS guards with rifles. It certainly was not a pleasant...pleasant uh uh moment,\nbecause we certainly didn't know what was going to happen. And uh then we were...when we\nwere ascended this truck and saw other Jewish people because they all had the star and they all\nhad the same destiny that their husbands had been taken but uh uh uh the...since they had the\naddress of these people at home, they were picking up the people in their in their homes. Those\nthey didn't found in the factories, they found at home and then we were cruising around in in in\nin Berlin. It was in March, early in March. It was cold. It was...it was raining. It was miserable\nand then they stopped and cruising and we were absolutely uncertain, but I had the wonderful\nfeeling at least my wife and my son was with me. The others were in that unfortunate situation\nthat they were separated from their families and uh also I must say my then wife was in a rather\ngood mood and let's say whatever will come, will come, as long as we can stay together, and uh\nthen we were taken to a to a big place in the middle of the night. Don't forget that Berlin was\ncompletely blacked out on account of the air raid sit...of the air situation, and uh then from that\nbig place we were transferred...transferred to another place uh where also my parents had been\nbefore. It's a collection point. Also in between we were released for a day or two to our\napartment again uh uh and we could do something because we had uh red arm bands to help uh\nto to be...to bring some food to a place, but that was only very minor. There was\nnothing...nothing really where you could say uh you can help people. We were all exposed to\nthe same...to the same danger. So uh uh and then uh uh again we were we were called in and we\nwere taken in to that place in in the old age home, and on March 11, 1943, we were we were\n(clearing throat) made part of the transport. Interesting enough, two days before we\nbecame...and I became the witness of the first major air raid of the American air force against\nBerlin. As long as the British air force came, certainly I mean they had tried what they do, but\nthey are...the the damage they were they were inflicting on on on the on the buildings in Berlin\nwere rather minor, though they were there I mean and it was...you never knew where they would\nhit and what would be hit, and we were part of that, but when the American bombers came, I\nmean there was...there for the first time I realized that was a massive attack and you'll see when\nwe when we uh looked around that Berlin was really burning, and we had to hope that the\nrailway uh uh would be destroyed, but that didn't happen. And then on the 11...uh March 11th\nwe were made part of of that transport. Uh we were taken together with...I think we were all in\nall a thousand people out of that uh collection point. Men...wo...men, women, children, elderly,\nyoung...and uh my sister was with me, with us and also luckily some of our friends from the\nyouth movement and we tried to stick together. We were uh shipped to a freight yard within\nBerlin and there were forced to board one of these cattle cars, uh approximately I think a hundred\npeople in a car, so we could could hard...we couldn't lie. We could hardly sit...mostly stand.\nThere was just a hole for for for...there was a hole in the car for ventilation (clearing throat) and\none bucket there for for hygiene purposes and uh...but still I would say that I, in spite of that, and\nalso my then wife, had a feeling well, we'll take it...we can take it, because none of us uh was\naware what was going to happen. Uh we didn't know where we were going. Uh I only noticed\non my watch that exactly at four o'clock in the afternoon this train left and was moving east,\nbecause I was familiar with the geography of Berlin and Germany, so we know we were were uh\ngoing to the east, and uh as a matter of fact, uh since we were together with other other friends,\nin order to to not kill times but to somehow alleviate the situation within ourselves somehow\nstarted to sing Jewish songs we had uh learned uh uh in the in the youth movement.\n. How nice 1s it to to be with friends, under those conditions. It's absurd today,\nyou know, but you see this was still part of the of the mood we were in, and I remember that also\nmy wife also wrote some of these cards which were very safe because you could throw them\nthrough the hole and sometimes they were picked up and people uh then mailed them. Uh it was\nFriday night and uh when it became dark, interesting enough, one of the ladies there uh aware of\nthis was a Friday night, uh took out some candles she had prepared, was lighting the candles, was\nbless...blessing the candles, and and and uh expressing the prayers, you know, to welcome the\nSabbath, and you know, the...later very often thought about this, you know, what...how how\nabsurd life can be that, you know, here there was a group, just a death wagon of a hundred\npeople, most probably ninety percent of them did not live to see the next evening anymore, but\nstill riding in that car, they were blessing God and welcoming uh the Sabbath, in that mobile uh\nprison going from Berlin to we still didn't know where. So we traveled all night and uh then I\nrealized in the morning that we were going via Breslau (ph) in this area and uh uh came to Upper\nSalasia and uh then uh in the afternoon, almost twenty-four hours later, we uh we stopped in a\nkind of a railway station uh and there I saw for the first time written the name Auschwitz. I was\nnot aware what Auschwitz was in spite of the fact that I had uh uh listened to to to BBC London,\nhad tried to get all the information I could in Berlin. We knew about uh ghettos in Riga. We\nknew about the ghetto in in in Lodz. Auschwitz...I didn't know what it was. And uh obviously\nalso at this time uh uh neither BBC London nor any other information uh sources, had any any\nconcrete idea. Auschwitz was new. So uh uh when the train stopped uh they they they the doors\nwas opened and we were all somehow stiff and so it was a cold night and so and so, but we were\ndriven out. There were...there were SS guards with the with the uh uh uh sticks and uh yelling\nlike animals, and uh beating people out of the cars. Uh there I also saw when we left our uh\nwagon that two of our people who were with us or three had committed suicide, so uh uh\nbecause they probably...it was it was too much for them, and then outside we were we were\nassembled on a platform. Uh we were ordered to leave all our uh belongings there, all our\nknapsacks we had prepared carefully and whatever it was remained there, and then they ordered\nus to uh line up in different groups, men, uh women with children, and women. And this was the\nmoment when when when I was separated from my wife and my child, and this is where my wife\nthen said well, this is the moment I have...I was...I will be...I was afraid of. As long as we were\ntogether...and sure enough uh uh this was the last uh uh day I have seen her and my child. We\nwere lining up and uh uh there stand a man in a in a very elegant SS uniform. Later I came to\nunderstand it was Dr. Mengele, and uh when he approached he asked only how old are you,\nwhat's your profession, and then he directed people to the left or to the right with his thumb.\nAnd he asked me how old. What's your profession? I certainly did not say that I was an\nadministrator or a law student. I said I was a welder, and he directed me to one group. I had lost\ntrack of my wife and my son, but then also what I saw and what was completely new to me was\nall of a sudden women in SS uniform with with their pistol holsters, you know, where they...the\npistol uh dangling, and they also prepare...behaved like animals, and they uh uh uh were\nespecially busy with the women with children and the elderly and then we saw uh and I saw\npeople in in a certain uniform I had never seen before, with stripped clothing and peculiar kind of\na of a of a cap, and uh so then trucks uh were were driving up and one group of people,\nespecially the women with children and the elderly were put on one truck and we still had to wait\nand uh then this truck left and it so happened that my wife and my my my son had...they were\nsitting or were standing at the end of that truck, and my wife was somehow waving to me. And\nthat was the last I've seen of her. We had to wait and then were were were pressed into another\ntruck, and though we thought it was full already they they uh they still pushed I don't know how\nmany people into...it was less...1t was worse than sardines. Uh and there certainly everywhere\nwere SS guards. We tried to uh to uh to uh speak to them, but interesting enough they hardly\nspoke German because they were what they called which means ethnic Germans, but\ntheir main major language was Polish, but they had volunteered obviously for the SS and did this\nkind of duty. So we couldn't find out anything from them and then we were driven away from\nthat railway station and passed by a tremendous uh uh area of industrial buildings. I don't know\nhow many buildings we could see that was under construction. We couldn't understand what it\nwas. We didn't know...after all, we still didn't know where we were. And uh then after having\npassed this area of industrial buildings, uh we entered...we...all of a sudden I saw a a camp\nsurrounded by by barbed wire, with watch towers and SS guards with machine uh guns, machine\npistols, and when we drove into this I said to my friends who were standing next to me from the\nyouth movement and luckily we were still sticking together... may God help us to get out of here\nalive. So uh that's the moment when when we had arrived and I had arrived in Auschwitz. What\nhappened to my wife and my son I did not know. The others didn't know what happened to their\npeople, so and then we were ordered uh to descent this truck and and and uh were driven into to\nto some barracks and were ordered to undress completely, only to keep our our shoes, our glasses\ncertainly, our belts and uh then the SS ordered us to take off our rings, our watches,\nwhatever...and uh uh then we were were...I together with these other people and we were\napproximately I would say two hundred people in this in this group, from Berlin...uh were were\nled into a shower. We were not quite clear what what it was. It was cold. It was miserable but\neven later when we...when the water came down although it was cold it was somehow, it\nwas...believe it or not some kind of a relief after this trip that we hadn't eaten. We had not...we\nwere not in in very good shape, but in all tense (ph)...I I remember that everything that I...I said\nat this time to myself, register in your mind whatever is going on. With God's help one day you\nmight be be be called to give evidence about that, so somehow I I tried and not to forget and uh\nthen we...after that...1n that...then we were in that shower. A man came also with a uniform, with\na stripped uniform, and we asked him who are you and he said I'm from Hamburg. I am a\npolitical prisoner, a Jew but a political prisoner. I have taken part in the uh fight of the of the\nSpanish Republicans against Franco. I was caught there and and and and delivered by the\nSpanish to Germany. I am in the camp already four years. You have arrived in Auschwitz. The\ncamp here is named Buna. You will be working for a big factory where they are trying to\nproduce artificial rubber and it is under the under the administration of , and\nfor us had a special name. It was like DuPont in...or British British Chemical and so it was a\ntremendous firm. It's stocks were widely held, also by Jewish stockholders, so this is what you\nare going to do, and we asked what's about our chil...wives and children. He said don't ask about\nthem because uh I can't tell you. We don't ask questions. We are here already. You are lucky\nthat you came now. We, the old guards, the old timers, called old-timers are here already for\nyears. We have gone through Buchenwald and Dachau and Saxonhausen and now Auschwitz, so\ntry to make your best. Try to be strong. Try to take it. Otherwise you are lost, and uh then after\nthe shower was over, we we were given the same kind of uh dresses these people had. It was not\nfitting, you know...it was terrible. And some caps also with the same stripes, and then we were\nled to one of the barracks we had seen there in that camp and a man who called himself the elder,\nthe block elder, blockaltester, block elder received us. He was a political prisoner who was uh\nallied with the communist party and so and had been caught very early, so he had already seven\nor eight years of imprisonment behind him, and he said I want you to be clean. I want you to\n_____ and so and we were then given our our beds, which means 1n this barracks there were rows\nof bunks, three tiers and there was...there was a thin blanket and the so-called mattress was a\nstraw sack and uh and uh we were given to understand that this is our place where we can sleep.\nThere was no place to leave your things. There was...there was uh no place uh to rest, to sit\ndown, so uh...and then I realized that uh...the events were so fast and so over-bearing and so\nshocking that it was not possible for me to fully analyze what was going on, but uh I realized one\nthing that certainly uh I I...that the Nazis had tried to dehumanize me by taking away all my\nprivate...my most private things, my hair, my clothing, to make me a number and that I was\ndegraded to to become a slave, that I was a prisoner, that uh I was not any more able to do what I\nwanted to do, that I had to uh follow uh orders...how nonsensical they were...and uh that that all\nthis in the name, I said, of German civilization...I was puzzled. And also uh especially then\ncame a little bit...got used to this...came to the realization that there was no way out because uh\ncertainly the camp was was was surrounded by more than one fence of barbed wire, was\nelectrically loaded, that to run away would be impossible and even if so, 1n a Polish area...1t was\nstill a Polish population where you don't know the language...was hopeless, so that the only hope\nwhich was there is to to live to to see uh that Germany was militarily defeated, and had\nsurrendered.\nbefore in the action that the Nazis despised tremendously any people looking somewhat\nintellectually or or professional or so the worst were the were the lawyers and and and when they\nfound a lawyer they really...they they mistreated them very very badly. So I said I was a welder\nand then we got we got...uh I got my number, which was 107984. Uh we had to...I had to...I got\nsome patches of of of stuff of linen and and had to to sew it on my uniform, and also then uh\nsomebody came and tattooed this number on my left arm, so uh that means I I I...and I still have\nthat...uh which means that you were completely uh uh...you were...you have become a number\nand one of the first things I said to myself 1s I would like to become not a number. I had a\nnumber but I'd like not to become a number, so still there was that spirit of resistance if possible.\nAnd then on that first day also I I went through something which never uh uh experienced\nbefore, what they call appell. The Germans and the Nazis, they are in this respect and especially\nat this time, they had obstinent appell, you know, and counting was one of their hobbies. Uh and\nthey had it at least twice a day, so we were all led to a big place, a big square and there we had to\nline up...our block...in in rows of five and had to wait until an SS man came, and there\nwere...were the head of the camp, the SS that was...the SS stormfurher which means captain. Uh\nsince it was cold, he had the privilege of wearing a nice fur coat, uh a military fur coat, so we\nwere counted again and again and again, and uh uh then uh the next day, it was the first day\nwhen when when I was I was uh uh commanded, after the appell in the morning, to go to a\ncertain kommando they called it, working...working uh squad or working platoon, and uh the\nnewcomers had no choice. They were attached to a very special one. I only later I found this\none of the kommands to uh to wear us down, to grind us down, uh which we called , the\nthe killing...killing kommando, the murder kommando, uh number four. So then we uh we we\nwe we walked out, again in military order, uh always five because that was easier to count. We\nwere counted at the uh square before. We were counted when we marched out and at this time\nthe SS uh uh guards were walking with us left and right, so uh in other words each kommando\nhad so and so many SS guards attached to them, and uh it was quite a....quite a distance we\nwalked and uh...well, I was still able to do that. Of course I had still a certain strength in me, and\nthen uh uh then we were...we entered the factory area where where you had these\nnum...numerous buildings there under construction. Uh streets were not completed. There was a\nlotofmud, __ soil, especially since it was a cold morning, it was all flour (ph) and we\nhad...we had just the this very thin kind of dress and and and it was not easy and uh then I was\nled together with the others uh to a certain place where we had to unload uh uh uh railway\nwagons of metal and cement and so on. And this was done mostly uh not in an ordinary way, but\nrunning. I mean metal...you cannot...big beams you cannot transport by running but but for\ninstance when you have a sack of cement, then they wanted you to run because it had to be fast.\nAnd also for the first time I became acquainted with an institution I didn't know uh uh before,\nthat each kommando had a a a inmate leader called kapo. Where this term originated I don't\nknow. I have never found out. It comes from Italy somehow. Uh but they called it kapo and it\nhas been...had entered the the language of the concentration camps, so you had a kapo as the\nleader of the...and he had certain foremans to to to help him, especially in bigger kommands,\nbigger bigger bigger kommandos, but then you had the SS also so they all then uh uh were\naround us to to watch what we are doing and how we are doing it, that 1t went fast enough and so\non. And uh I remember that on that first day uh when we were when we were doing this kind of\nwork and I had done part of it in Berlin so it was not completely new to me...I I saw that one\nJewish fellow of another kommando uh throw himself in front of a locomotive of a small uh\nengine to commit suicide so that was the first that I I saw there uh and it was the first which was\nfollowed by many many more. So uh when it came to uh to uh to uh the so-called lunch break,\nsome trucks came with some watery soup which was called buna (ph) soup because the name of\nthat factory was Buna and it was provided by the firm which they think was a tremendous uh\ntremendous gain for us. It was very often absolutely stinking and and and consisted of nothing\nbut just water uh uh with some some vegetable remnants or so. It's awful. And so uh and\nsince...and also we had...there was...yeah...one of our possessions was uh a bowl which you\nalways had to carry with us. That was your only possession and a spoon. When we we got the\nsoup, we couldn't sit down and so it all has to be...had to eaten standing up and then after a short\nwhile the the work continued up to the very end of the day. So at the beginning...I mean it was\nhard but but but I also considered bearable, but then, you know, not a couple of days later...was\nearly in March, uh terrible rain storms hit the area and the area became muddier than before so\nthe work became more difficult, especially when you have to carry these cement bags. That was\nnot...the paper was not of the best quality so they very often broke and when you mix cement\nwith water, you know, it it becomes very hard caked and it was setting also on your clothing and\nso...now the other problem was that I couldn't change...change the clothing. I I I...there was no\nway to clean yourself. There was so-called washroom but the washroom was there for hundreds\nof people. To get to the faucets was almost impossible, so to keep clean was one of the most\ndifficult things, and also there was always the danger uh that you you would acquire lice which\nthen would would uh result in typhus. So how to keep clean I don't know, but anyhow that that\nwas one of the problems and also, you know, you certainly you didn't need a a a comb anymore\nbecause you had no hair, but you even didn't also didn't have a towel. You had...really you had\npractically...you were devoid of any things uh uh which makes fundamentals of of life. Who\nspeaks about about books and paper and and...it didn't exist, simply did not exist. You were\nreally uh a slave. You were rented out by the SS to . I was, therefore, a slave working uh\nuh uh for the benefit of the SS for and I was aware of the fact that I was allowed to\nlive only as long as I as I was able to do this kind of work. The moment I became weak or the\nmoment I would I would uh contract any any illnesses and so that was the end, so therefore I I\nalso tried very hard to uh to keep myself clean but, of course, I mean especially when you had\nthese rains and you came back in the evening and the the uh the uh so-called uniform was was\ncovered with with the cement dust. You went to bed and you were you were wet. Everything\nwas wet. So how to sleep under those conditions I don't know, but but, you know, obviously\nhuman beings can can can can can can tolerate a lot. Uh many of our people...I wouldn't say\nmany...some of our people simply said enough is enough and uh I remember distinctly that that\nuh uh starting the third or fourth day uh certain of the people who were also in our transport and\nwere still in that same kommando, simply when we were walking out of the camp, ran what they\ncalled __ so the person had ran away, tried to ran away and then the SS started to shoot\nimmediately and shooting him to death. Uh and the SS loved to do that because for any for any\nvictim I think they were paid at this time twenty or twenty-five marks and a bottle of of of\ncognac and so on and a day or two of rest. And I remember for instance we were walking uh one\none morning. It was the fourth or fifth morning. A father was walking with his son and the\nfather then when we were out of the camp, gave the rest of his bread and whatever he had to his\nson and said uh uh I don't need it any more, gave it to his son, ran out in order to be shot, in the\npresence of his son. And uh uh uh this I saw. These first days uh especially became the the\nworst I would say in my life and very often when we came home, you know, we...after you came\nback from the factory, you were counted again. You were counted when you entered the camp.\nYou were counted again in the evening, and uh this sometimes could last uh hours and hours\nbecause Germany was the place where where let us say where where scientists work on\nmathematics and make progress, but these people were not good in math, and very often when\nthe when the when the numbers didn't didn't didn't jive, we had to wait and and and and they did\nnot uh let us uh let us go before everything was was just just right to the last man, so it happened,\nfor instance, I remember that one evening of the fourth or the fifth, one of the men of my\ntransport just collapsed in front of us. Uh we he was a cantor, a man I knew well because I had\nattended his service. Weisman (ph) was his name. A wonderful, powerful voice, and and and\nand well, highly-educated man. He collapsed and when the appell was taken and the SS man\ncame and kicked him with his with his foot and he could hardly move and uh then when the\nappell was...when the roll call was over, uh we decided we had to take him to the so-called uh\nemergency..the krackenbaugh, the hospital and uh it was not easy for us to carry him but we did\nit because we thought it's the only way to help him, and then on the way, which was quite a long\nway over there at the end of the uh place, he expired and he died in our hands and uh uh this was,\nI must say, the first uh casualty I witnessed of somebody I knew well, and then from this day on,\nmany many things happened because the resistance, the power of resistance somehow\nevaporated. How I did it I don't know. II thought out all kind...I I also felt that I I] became\nweaker. As a matter of fact, one morning I fainted and my good friends uh lifted me up and the\nwhole day was difficult forme. Uh but I somehow managed. It was one of these miracles, but\nuh but uh uh after one month I would say, from the two hundred and twenty or so we had been\nwhen we were newcomers, only I think a hundred and fifty had survived, but to save the other's\nplace, later, after liberation when I tried to find out how many of our transport had survived, of\nthe thousand who had left Berlin, not more than six, and I am one of those. So uh uh I myself\nasked the question, how long would I be able to to to tolerate that and uh also uh we were cut off.\nWe didn't know what what was the latest on the front. We were waiting for the second front and\ndidn't know any...hear anything because we were cut off from any news. We didn't hear\nanything about uh what was going on on the eastern front, so I said how long can it last. And I\nremember that one moment then when I went to the toilet, I found a piece of newspaper that\nprobably an SS man had left there, and it so happened that I took into my...you know, pockets I\ndidn't have, but...yeah...was hiding it under my underwear and and, you know, we had to be\ncareful to to to handle this and it so happened when I was in the block with my friends I said\nwatch that somebody should discover us and uh I read it and it so happened that was a piece with\nthe report of the of the German Wiermacht saying that they had been driven out of Krackow (ph)\nwhich gave me an idea that the front, the Russian front, was advancing, but more I didn't know,\nbut somehow it it added again, you know, to the spark of life and uh then uh there was another\nday when I almost lost uh my my my uh belief that I would be able to make it. In our group was\na man who uh uh was very active also in our youth movement. He uh was uh uh a Jewish civil\nemployee, and he was a man with a beautiful voice. He had studied music because he wanted to\nbecome a cantor, and he had been in another kommando and uh I met him and he was desperate.\nI said to him uh...his name was Fritz Shafer (ph)...uh what happened. He said I've had enough. I\ncan't take it any longer. I said what are you going to do. He said I have uh...I was sick. I went\nto the hospital. After three days they threw me out. I can hardly stand on my feet and I don't\nlike to be to be to be kicked to death, so I'd rather take my own life, so I argued with him. I said\nFritz, how can you do it. Think what we have gone through. Think what we have been taught.\nHow can you take your own life. After all, you are observant Jew. It's un-Jewish. He said, this\nis my decision. I don't want to be to be to be kicked to death, because what happened here...for\nthis there is no provision in the bible and in in our scriptures, and the next day I heard in the\nmorning whatever shooting going on during the night. Very often the SS guards on the tower,\nthey were sometimes shooting because...to keep themselves awake let us say, and they could\norder you...they had these Jews that they saw something in there for the...1t was suspicious and\ntherefore they were firing, so uh so we heard shooting constantly, and next day somebody said\nyou know, did you hear the shooting this morning. I said yes, what happened. They said your\nfriend, Fritz Shafer...he uh he uh he tried to be admitted to the to the hospital again. They didn't\naccept him, so he said under those conditionsI I _\u2014_\u2014s went against the...you know, this was one\nof the ways in which people also put an end to their misery. They went to the to the wire and\nthen the fellow from the the gangster from the...the SS gangster from the watch tower was\nshooting because that was his order, so he went to the wire in order to be shot and and that's what\nhappened. And I remember it still...1t was on April 3rd, 1940...'43, soon after we arrived. Uh so\nwhen I heard this, I must say I I I I was almost lost because I had lost a battle and I saw the\nparallel and I was uh said...asking myself how long will we all be able to make that, and then uh\none day or two days later, all of a sudden there was uh uh a special roll call that people should\nregister again their their their uh profession, so that gave me another hope and uh there was what\nthey called the labor service, . Again registered and I registered myself again as\nwelder. The uh reason was that the Germans had lost on account of Stalingrad a lot of\nmanpower, had uh uh inducted into the army also skilled labor, so they were short of labor, and\nobviously were interested to to now somehow in our in our skill, if you want to. So III uh\nregistered. Nothing came out of it but somehow it gave me some hope, and there was another\nevent which uh was of immense importance. All the time when when I was there at the\nbeginning, we were constantly under the under the supervision of the SS gangsters, and they\nwere brutal, brutal, brutal uh uh beings. I cannot say human beings. So uh uh even, you know,\nwhen you wanted to go to the toilet and so you had you had to to to honor by taking off your cap\nand asking for permission, for his permission and so on and what they did in order to play around\nwas very often to take, when you when you take off your cap, take the cap and throw it away and\nwhen the moment when you...when the people went to get, to collect the cap, then the SS man\nwas shooting him on the pretense that he was trying to uh to uh to uh run away, so uh that...and\nthis this was the uh the situation the first couple of weeks. Also in connection with the\nStalingrad defeat uh they then came to the conclusion that they wanted to save manpower and\nthey organized the uh the uh guards in such a way that they were surrounding completely the\nwhole area of that industrial complex, so that when we marched out, when we got into into into\nthe factory area, the SS stayed outside uh keeping guard out...yeah, keeping guard outside but we\nmarched in only with the kapos. And that alleviated certainly the situation somehow because\nthen the kapos in order to keep their pos...their position who were very, very rough with their\nown people...they were mostly German criminals and and anti-social elements and so they then\nwere not not not provoked anymore by the SS to to to become tougher with the...so this helped\nsomehow, but still 1t was no no no no solution and and as I say, I 1 1 I thought what what...still I\nwas able to move but but I said something has to had to be done. For instance, we were then...I\nwas put in another kommando under the command of a kapo who was a Polish criminal. He had\ncommitted one or two murders uh and and he was such a human being the only regret he had that\nhe had waited too long to murder his wife and his mother-in-law, so uh so uh and he was\ntaking...he was not sent...sentenced to death for one reason or the other because uh...so uh he was\na kapo there and he had uh used the foul language especially in Polish, because he was also was\nalso one of these ethnic Germans who didn't know exactly where they belonged. You know,\nthey they they they they had a double standard. They wanted to be Germans, and at the same\ntime uh uh they wanted to to remain with their fellow Poles, so uh...and he he uh he was the head\nof a digging kommando, and that was also that was that that uh he was called in a German\nexpression was Juden Franz (ph). Franz is a German name, but Juden Franz was Jew Franz he\ngot because he was a grinder of Jews. He had shown so many Jewish uh casualties on his\nconscious. And he would always say, well I had to do it in order to enforce the \u2014_\u2014, and we\nwere not protected. There was no protected because not only had I lost my my my name and my\nhair and my clothing and my family...I also had had lost completely my my right to claim any\nhuman rights. And uh that's what certainly these these people, these gangsters knew very well\nthat there was no protection and uh then one day uh the uh the uh...we were called again to the\nlabor office, again for registration, but this time in the presence of a representative of ;\nAnd again we were asked what is your uh uh profession, name...uh not name, number and\nprofession, and I said welder. He was somehow doubtful, for what reasons, but uh then he asked\nme certain technical questions and I was able to answer them, and then uh uh two days later I\nwas transferred into a kommando where I I got out of this grinding work of transport, digging,\nand all this and uh was attached to what they call a German meister (ph) uh and uh uh the work\nwas...and it was a great help...was to clean big plates which were used in the uh gasoline\ncolumns which had come in order to uh to be installed in the in the factory. That gave me a\nchance somehow to to to to rest a little bit in between because I was not under the super...this the\nkapo there was a political prisoner from from sso uh I could recover a little bit. The only\nthing which I dreaded very much that because of that I was transferred also into another lager, to\nanother barracks and had not the daily contact with my friends there who were still doing work\nand as I in that terrible kommando there. Well, uh so uh uh especially, as I say, uh uh at the\nbeginning uh life or the day in in Auschwitz was simply a day of getting up, starting to run, uh\nbeing exposed to uh to uh the whim of the blockaltester or kapo, so hardly be able to to sit, uh\nwatching what what what uh left and right uh what what was happening so that it shouldn't\nhappen to you and especially uh to to try to to do the work, which was not work, which was\nreally slave work reminding you somehow of the illustrations you saw inthe __\u2014_\u2014~when the\nJews in in Egypt were building the pyramids. Uh it, as I say, it improved somehow, and I felt at\nleast the improvement uh when when when the SS guards were taken away...",
        "Answer: Especially when I when when I came to the conclusion that what little I had, I had to to\nstretch out my energy. For instance, there was...I don't know if it's right, but I got the bread in\nthe morning. I didn't eat it immediately. I kept a little bit and kept it in my pocket somehow so\nthat they say, when when it's drier, then it has more nourishing value, or one instance I tried to\nuh to uh to uh...especially after the SS was taken away from the kommandos, to go to the to the\ntoilet unobserved as often as possible to have to have a minute of rest, or for instance uh you\nknow, uh uh we had as tool only our bowl and a and a and a and a spoon. Now I came to the\nconclusion in order to cut the bread...we had no knives certainly. That was dangerous for the\nGermans, for the German state. Uh I sharpened part of that of that spoon so that it was easier\nsomehow to cut in order to save energy and and and this...and also uh uh uh what I tried in spite\nof all obstacles to to to remain clean. Uh because I realized that the moment I would give in, that\ncould be the end easily, so uh uh and then when I was working for that first German meister, uh\nuh who was who was more or less pleasant, uh uh because he treated me not as an inmate, as a\nheftling, as a slave. He treated me as somebody who was like a helper or uh...not in his category\nbut as a helper and uh then I tried, you know, to sit down as often as possible and to to relax to\nto...whenever I could and not to exert myself, do anything special, certainly not to run anymore\nand so to try to to to walk in a way that that I don't consume too much ener...energy. Uh after a\ncertain while I lost that job because there was a conflict between and the and the and\nthe which was doing this kind of work and uh then I was uh uh handed over to another\nfellow who...as a welder...uh the German meister who came from Saxony (ph) and he was a first\nclass worker, but his religion as you have it very often in in Germany...his whole religion was\nwork. He didn't understand anything about politics. His politics was work. He didn't like it. He\ndidn't like the war but this doesn't affect 1t. He was just...as long as he could work, and he was\nvery proud in his work, so at the beginning it was not so easy because I was not an accomplished\nwelder, but I tried to learn from him and he realized that and I must say in all fairness, he treated\nme like an equal. And when he saw that I made progress in whatever he wanted me to do, then\nhe gave me some cigarettes uh which I didn't use certainly because I then bartered the cigarettes\nfor bread which was very important, also to to get up some more energy. And uh uh so uh also\nwhat was a tremendous advantage, that uh when I worked with him I could work under a roof so\nthat the elements...I was not exposed to the elements. I also remember that uh when I entered\nthis building where I worked then, I for the first time in weeks I saw a mirror, and I looked\nmyself into the mirror and I was aghast. I was simply...I I I mean this was the worst, one of the\nworst things I must say that happened to me. I didn't recognize myself anymore, certainly\nwithout hair, unshaven you know, because we had a chance only to to be shaven once a week,\nand I said for goodness sake, what happened to you. Uh uh but still the fact that I was\nsomehow now in a better position helped me tremendously and and I was still felt sorry that for\nmy other friends that they having no skill and having nothing to offer in this respect were not\nable to alleviate their situation somehow, and uh so I I I worked with this man for a certain while\nand again then something changed uh because because uh uh uh they wanted to have welders in\nin in in the camp directly. There was a welder kommando and the Buna was constantly\nexpanding and at the beginning when I came, the total of was approximately two thousand or\ntwo thousand five hundred. Then we we we grew to approximately ten thousand. What they did\nwas also that uh they uh and the Germans were...the Nazis did things which are not well known\nbut should be should be recorded. At a certain time, they established brothels for the German uh\ninmates and the Polish inmates, and they brought prostitutes from Poland and from Germany into\na special barrack where the the the Polish uh uh inmates, non-Jewish Polish inmates, or the\nGerman inmates had an opportunity to go whenever there was...there was a certain schedule for\nthat. There was a special barrack built in the middle of the and we were called to uh to\ndo the heating there, to establish the heating so they needed welders and I was one of them\nwhich gave me a tremendous uh uh...which was a tremendous help. Number one, I mean I was\nsuffering from certain , from from swollen feet, so I didn't have to walk these long\ndistances to the to the to the factory and uh also I became acquainted with the with the people\nthere inthe camp, __ people and so and IJ started to do certain things in my free time, using\nscrap and making hooks for the beds, or or for the curtains and things like that and I...and it\nturned...there was no money. I mean none of us was allowed to have any money certainly, so\nyou were bartering for bread and and and so this kind of work uh uh uh...I wouldn't say I liked\nbut it was helpful also to to come back to my to my somehow to my health and to my to my\nenergy. Uh also uh in in...in between I started to work outside in in that area with a with a with a\nman who was, interesting enough, a Polish national but who was an artist as a welder and I\nlearned a lot from him, and...though he was a very nationalistic Pole, he was no anti-Semite. He\nwas special, and we got on good terms. Uh he bought me papers, newspapers, I mean\nand once in a while a piece of of of of uh sausage. I even could could ask him to write for me a\nletter to a neighbor of mine in Berlin with whom I had left some money and some things, and\nsure enough this lady, a wonderful lady, wrote back and and sent money and some food to this\nPolish man, so I left him with the money because I couldn't use the money. It was too dangerous\nbut he gave me the food and that was manna for me. So uh uh and also this... == =\u2014\u2014\u2014s was his\nname...he had a very interesting technique. Since he hated the Germans so much, uh and hated\ncertainly to work for _ for the war effort, he had developed a certain technique, you know,\nwhen you weld pipes you have to be very careful because uh under high pressure they could\nburst easily and therefore you have to be have to be very accurate. I knew how to do this. I\nknew how to do it, and then he taught me how to do it that 1t looked good from the outside, was\nbad from the inside, by, for instance, apply more oxygen or an abundance of oxygen so that\nbubbles would would would would build inside the the the metal and it would...the weld of\nmetal, and certainly the pressure...and the pipes would not be able to to to to tolerate the\npressure. Uh and that's how...I say when I worked with him for the first time, we established a\ncontact. Then I I worked in the camp for the...partly to establish that brothel and then when I\nwas working in the camp, I heard one day that there were British prisoners of war who had\nappeared in that factory and sure enough, uh what the Germans had done was uh the British, as\nyou know from the records, had fought Rommel in North Africa, had surrendered at. : The\nsoldiers who had been taken prisoner in ___ had been brought to Italy and when Italy got out\nof the war, the Germans didn't let them go but transferred them to Germany and to Upper\nSalasia. was that camp, a tremendous prisoner of war camp and against the rules and\nregulations of the Geneva Convention, they brought of these prisoners of war to\nAuschwitz, not to work like us, I mean like inmates, but in their uniform. Uh they had a special\ncamp, a special prisoner of war camp and they were guarded by German...by German soldiers,\nby by by by by army soldiers, but they put them to work in that factory and when I heard this I\nsaid I have to come...I have to meet them. How I didn't know, so I uh arranged it somehow that I\ngot an assignment with the same kommando I was before, this ...(pause) and uh when I\nsaw the the the...they also when they got into the...under the uh uh area of their ___s complex,\nthey were marching, but they were marching differently than we were. They were marching to\nsuch extent that the German guards were mostly elderly fellows and they could hardly uh keep\nup with them, and when they saw us, I tell you they were throwing cigarettes at us and whatever\nthey had and uh keep up these good spirits and so 1t was tremendous. And uh I could almost\nweep when I when I saw that. That was a tremendous...tremendous uh...give us a\nspirit...tremendous spiritual uplift, and I could feel it and then I I thought how could I come into\ncontact and luckily when I was transferred back to that fellow __, uh British uh prisoners of\nwar were working in the neighborhood and under very, very careful circumstances and all\nbecause they had to be careful. Uh uh I was then able to establish contact with them, and luckily\nmy school English was good enough...__\u2014_\u2014~s English which I had improved during my my years\nat the University. The British were very careful, on an individual basis, because they never knew\nwith whom they were meeting, you know, and slowly but surely, and I say it with pride, I was\nable to to establish a very close personal contact and the moment the this kind of sound barrier\nwas was was pierced, they became the best friends you could imagine, and what they did was not\nonly for me but many others, for instance, they had, you know, there was a different categories\nof of soup for the luncheon and uh the quality of our soup was the worst. The quality for the\nGerman civilians was the best. For the English prisoners of war, theirs was in between, but they\ndidn't need it. They didn't want it because luckily they had their International Red Cross parcels,\nso, therefore, they had already clients amongst our people, our inmates, to give them the soup\nwhich was very helpful because it was of better quality and uh they uh...since I was on such\nterms with them, they helped me with chocolates and and things like that. At the end actually I\nhad British...when I walked out from Auschwitz, I had British socks. I had British shoes. I had\nBritish underwear, so uh uh because they had enough of that stuff and they didn't need all this,\nbut what was most important was...or two thingsI_ _\u2014stthe British sr was, one day uh uh they\ntold us that would...you know, they they they they had chocolate and cigarettes. They were also\ntrading with the civil population in that in that in that area, in that complex, uh so they they were\nable to construct a radio set via uh like in what...Stalag 18 (ph), you know...and they every night\nwere listening to BBC London. They had certainly technically tech...people with technical\nknowledge and so on, uh so...hiding it certainly from different German guards and after I had\nestablished this uh atmosphere of confidence with them, uh they uh agreed to tell me what they\nhave heard, so that I actually was able to uh to uh to follow the news of BBC London in\nAuschwitz and compare this news with what was written in the newspapers...discuss it with\nthem. Also they asked me...once in a while, you know, they met girls, Ukrainian girls, Polish\ngirls. They said they fell in love with them, or girls from Czechoslovakia, and they wanted to\ncommunicate with them but the girls certainly didn't understand understand English, so I\nvolunteered to write in German to these girls. After the war, when it's over, we'll come and\nmarry you and I give you my word as a prisoner of the of the of the English uh soldier that I will\nnever forget you and so so that was that was that was uh uh with them and and I must say this\nthis helped uh tremendously, because it it kept us...at least kept me...I couldn't communicate with\neverybody in the camp but with the close circle of friends I had, what we had heard and what\nwhat what the progress were and one one of the most was...emotional days was when first uh\nthere came the news...you must remember that by error a girl had played around with a telegraph\nin London and the the news had gone out that the Allies had landed in Normandy, and then it\nturned out it was a hoax, but on the day when they did land, uh somehow there was an\nelectrifying atmosphere in Auschwitz and the Germans became very nervous, and I immediately\nwent to my friends and said what what uh happened. They said we don't know because we don't\nlike to talk about it before we have a confirmation, and the next morning uh uh they were\njubilant and almost drunken, so said it happened. They have landed, and then I could come back\nto my friends in the camp and said listen, that's it, and it's created...1 mean then we somehow we\nwe knew that it was simply a matter of time when when when the the front in the east and in the\nwest would come clear and though we were more or less aware that the Nazis might not allow us\nto live to to to experience the day of liberation, that at least that that there's some hope. And that\nthat we can look forward to that moment eventually, so uh as I say, the the role of the of the\nBritish prisoner...I I I'm very very grateful to them and I must say for for for for most of my\nfriends. Uh years ago, BBC London brought me over to uh to London, because they had a show,\n\"This is Your Life,\" of one of the prisoners who interesting enough had been a member of the\nBritish army, had survived Dunkirk, had had been had been had been taken prisoner at Dunkirk,\nhad been I don't know in how many prisoner of war camps, had tried to to escape and\nunfortunately could never make it, and he was a daredevil. He was some kind ofa _\u2014\u2014_\u2014s and uh\nso uh uh uh they they they uh uh he had the courage to smuggle himself into our camp to find out\nwhat it was or what ___\u2014_\u2014srwass, because when I talked to these people, and I said listen, uh you\nI'm sure will survive. I, I don't know, because we don't know...but I want to give you all the\nfacts and when you come back to England and come back to your families, tell them our tale\nbecause I'm not...I cannot be sure, and they very often said to me, Norbert, how is it...how can\nthis be possible. I mean what you are telling us is so impossible. Uh uh there the Gerries (ph)\nare going around, even these gangsters in SS uniform, and you know, we had also cont...SS\ncontrol in the in the camp...inin the area, _, but they look like human beings would with\nwith their noses and their eyes and their mouths are the same like others. How is this possible?\nAnd uh uh (coughing) I said I have no explanation, but this is what it is and especially when in\nthe summer of 1944 when the Hungarian transports came en masse...that's a transport uh with\nwhich, for instance, also = =~=camefrom ___ to Auschwitz, to our camp...the gas chambers\nworked over time, but the crematorias were not able to uh to uh to uh to uh do their work\nanymore, so hundreds and thousands of corpses were burned outside of the crematoria so the\narea of Auschwitz was filled with the...call it stench of of of burned flesh and uh then when this\nalso waved into our area, I went around andI saidto _, you know, this must be it because we\nwere aware. \u2014\u2014_\u2014sy and uh uh uh in mn... luckily, you know, under...amongst these British who had\nno nobody who had any sympathy for Hitler or his racial \u2014\u2014_. - They were really wonderful\nfriends with with with with uh with a sense of solidarity and as I told you, when I came to that\nBBC show, this man, was his name, they said this is your life and they brought me over\nas one of the of the witnesses to to give evidence what...what he had done and how he done it\nand and uh uh to repeat this again, I hope that this story of the British prisoners of war in\nAuschwitz will be told one day, because it deserves to be told. Uh...",
        "Answer: Oh that was...that was that was still at a very bad time. Uh uh you know, it was...my\nbirthday was on a Sunday and uh I turned thirty on that day, on April 26th, 1943. I had been in\nAuschwitz uh six weeks and uh I was uh uh run down but not not completely desperate but not in\ngood mood and uh especially on that day, on that birthday, 1t was a Sunday. We didn't march out\nto work uh so it was a beautiful day and uh Auschwitz was not far from the \u2014_ Mountains,\nbeautiful area in Poland, and the air was so clear, blue sky...you could see the mountains and\ntheir beauty, and somehow that affected me and uh uh uh gave me gave me some courage and\nthen on that day for one reason or the other, uh we got bread and some marmalade, which was\nnot given too often and uh when one of my friends from the youth movement said you see, on\nthat birthday...it's almost better than cake __ and that that that happening somehow, that that\nwas really a...you see, you you are...every little bit was was was helpful in order to to to uh to to\nuh strengthen your your spirit of...your spirit of .. your your...yeah...your spirit to live.\nUh also uh I must say in this respect, another experience is interesting. Uh we had in our block\namongst the old timers a man who originated from Vienna. He wasuhuha____ scholar, and he\nwas taken with a so-called Polish...Polish action in September '39, uh was taken to Buchenwald,\nfrom Buchenwald to to Auschwitz where I met him, and he was one of those who uh knew the\nbible and \u2014\u2014\u2014_s and so very well, but, you know, you had no no books there. Whatever was\ndone there, were taught or discussed was was from from your memory, and he established a a\nservice on the block so uh thought I was not...I mean certainly I attended service in Berlin, not\nevery day but certainly on holy days and so so then under certain precautions, under precautions\nuh uh he assembled in the corner to have a minion (ph), to have ten people and he said the\nmorning prayers and he knew them by heart certainly and uh, you know, this is...this was an\nexpression of directly resistance, that in...you know, God was treating us as he did treat us as we\nthought, __ had forsaken us as we thought, but nevertheless we said, , we still\nbelieve in you, and we came together for service and it was, I must say, I had the experience of\nunforgettable uh uh service. We had Yom Kippur service in in in Auschwitz with a few of our\npeople uh and uh uh there was a cantor who also recited all the prayers from memory and we\nsaid our prayers. Certainly we were very very careful that the SS or would not discover\nus, and in spite of, you know, in other words praising God in spite of everything, and uh I must\nsay uh it it was strengthening us spiritually which was also very important only...after all, you\ndon't exist only physically. You also exist spiritually and one can be uh uh uh the function of\nanother, uh so uh uh this this...all this added to the to the coming back of energy I would say, that\nI wasn't...after one year, let us say, I wasn't used to Auschwitz. I still was despising...but I had\nbecome somehow numb. I knew I couldn't change things...all these people I have lost, all these\nvictims I had seen, all these corpses I had seen lying around, and by the way I lost also then\nwithin a short time, two of my close friends be...because they they could...one was a man who\nwas highly idealistic and he couldn't take the misery and the the this this this this height of\ninhumanity, so he he uh said enough is enough. Didn't take his life, but he just resigned. And\nanother friend of mine contracted jaundice and there was there was no no way to help him, so as\nI say I lost but I also were able to establish contact with other people who had come...from all\nover the world people had come to Auschwitz. I had met people from from from \u2014\u2014__ with\nwhom I communicated in my broken French, and and tried to help them somehow. There were\npeople coming from all over, not only Poland and Yugoslavia but also Holland and Norway and\nand and uh France and and Germany and uh then after a certain while, because they knew that I\nhad this call it information service and had contacts with the British, that uh they came to me\nonce in a while, tried to help. For instance, one day a man came to me whom I met in the in the\nbarrack of a friend of mine. He was the elderly of this block, an old timer, still alive, now\nresiding in Los Angeles, and uh he came and he said he was looking for me, so uh what do you\nwant, and he said he just came from a from a branch camp, from a from a mine, from a coal mine\ncamp. Uh Max ___ was his name, and he said I need you. I said what do you need me for. He\nsaid I know that you have special contacts with the British. Try to help me. I said why. And he\ntold me the following story, that he uh uh originated from the German-speaking part of\nCzechoslovakia, uh . He was a gynecologist, practicing doctor, but also was active\npolitically against the Nazis and when they took over Czechoslovakia, it was time for him to to\nflee, and he was able to reach England and when the war broke out, he volunteered as a doctor\nfor the for the for the military. They didn't take him into the army for one reason or the other,\nbut they gave him a position as a doctor on the merchant marine and here was was...got a\nposition with the...I think it was the Blue __ Line in in in Manchester, in\nLiverpool...sorry...Liverpool. From Liverpool uh ships at this time went to still to the Far East,\nso he made a first journey from Liverpool to Singapore and came back and it was absolutely\nuneventful, but when he went on a second trip, he came to Singapore and when he left\nSingapore, his boat was attacked by a German raider which had come from Japan, and that\nGerman raider was armed and had already \u2014__\u2014_ some other ships, so it attacked his ship, was\noverwhelmed because they were not were not properly armed and was also taken into \u2014_\u2014__ and\nand they made their way...I think it was in the Strait of where they were attacked, made\nthe whole trip through the Indian Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope into the Atlantic Ocean\nand landed in Bordeaux (ph) and were not interfered with by the by the by the by the Allied uh\nships or the Allied Allied Allied air force. There was a time when when when England was very\nvery weak but...when they came to to Bordeaux, he together with the crew was taken to a to a uh\ncamp for the merchant marine, but when they searched the uh safe of the ship, of the British ship,\nthey found out that he was not a British nationalist but a Czech. Why the British were so stupid\nto to to to mention that in this I don't know, but they did it. And they then investigated in |\nwho he was and found out that he was active against the Nazis, so very soon after he landed in\nthis merchant marine camp, he got an order signed by ____ personally to be transferred to\nAuschwitz, and he came to Auschwitz in the uniform of the British merchant marine, and he was\nlooking somehow to bring his message out. When he was in the coal mine he couldn't find\nanybody, but when he came to Buna he heard about me (coughing) and uh I said what can I do.\nHe said try...he said I know, and we informed of that, that amongst these British prisoners of\nwar, there is a system that every month or every second month, every third month, one of\nthem...it's like a military action, has to try to escape to make his way into Switzerland, and there\nhe is bringing news and information about about the life...\nEND OF TAPE 4\n"
