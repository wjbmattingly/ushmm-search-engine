        "Q: Please tell us your name, where you were born, and when you were born?",
        "A: My name is Helene Baraf, named Zupnik. I am born in Antwerp, Belgium, the 24th of July\n1927.",
        "Q: Tell us about your family and your childhood before the war.",
        "A: Uh...I will start to tell you a little bit about my...uh... ancestors. Uh...[ come from two very\nfamous branches... uh...of...uh...the Jewish religion. My great grand uncle was...uh...Rabbi\nMeisels (ph) who has a synagogue named ... uh...after him in Prague and on my father's side\nI have Rabbi Dovelando (ph), who was very famous too, who has another synagogue\nnamed...uh...after him. Uh...my mother came from a very religious family. She had four\nbrothers and four sisters. And...uh...she was the only who survived the Holocaust, and they\nall had many, many children because that was the way of life in that time. And...uh...she was\nalready...uh...an older person when she met my....my father who came from Czechoslovakia\nand she accepted to...to marry him after refusing many, many suitors. And...uh...they lived in\nKrakow for one year...uh...where my brother was born in 1924, in July 26, 1924. And after\nthe...they stayed uncast. That means that....uh...her brother was...uh... keeping them for a\nyear where my father...when my father was studying. And then after the time was gone, they\ncame to Belgtum where I was born the 24th of July 1927. Uh...I grew up there, and we\nlived...uh...nicely. My father and my mother...1n the beginning were working in the\ndiamonds business. She was a Schleifer which means she was, I don't know how to say that\nin English...she...they were...he...she was not a cutter. A Schleifer is what a polisher...a\ndiamond polisher and...uh...little by little my father became...uh...courtier. Is that an English\nword? Courtier? Uh...He was selling for other diamonds and...uh...uh...life became easier\nand...uh...1 was going as a child in...uh...in the...and my first language was French so I went\nto grammar school in Belgium and on Wednesday afternoon and Sunday morning I went to\nJewish school. My brother went to a Jewish school for...uh...the whole day where he learned\nHebrew and Jewish and...uh...French and Flemish. Uh...in...in 1940 when I\nfinished...uh...no...let's go back to 1937...uh...when I came to American. To tell you the story\nwhy we came to America is because...uh...by great grandfather died here in America in\n1936. They came, I think, after the First World War here with all the children but my\ngrandmother was already married in...uh...1n Czechoslovakia so she was...uh...I think she\nwas the oldest daughter. So she remained with her husband and her children there in\nCzechoslovakia. This is why I have...uh...in reality I am a third generation already American\nbecause... uh...my family is here. So my father came here to America to...for the question of\nthe inheritance. And he liked it so much because he found all the family here that he didn't\nknow. His cousins, his uncles...uh...1t was...uh...very happy situation for him. So he wanted\nto immigrate. And we immigrated really to America in September of 37. For me as a child it\nwas a shock because it was in the depression era and...uh...we lived in the low east side.\nWe...compared to what...how we lived in New York or...in Antwerp, was a big difference. It\nwas a misery compared to that. And...uh...although I...I loved to be with all these cousins that\nI didn't know but...uh...unfortunately they send me to school...uh...as a....with the beginners. I\nwas already 10 at the time and it was very hard for me because I didn't spoke the language.\nMy brother, who was three years older, and finished already grammar school, immediately\nentered to high school and instead to be in the sixth...I don't know...in the first year, they sent\nhim immediately in the third grade. I don't know to compare that with the American. So he\nwas very happy. I was very unhappy here, and I cried a lot and...uh...it...because it was a very\ndifficult time at that time with the depression and my...my mother and father had a lot of\ndifficulties making out. So we came to the conclusion that...uh...maybe it would be easier for\nmy father if we send...we went back...uh...to Antwerp and...uh...this is what they decided to\ndo. We went...me and my brother and my mother, we went back to Antwerp and my father\nstayed here in America. My mother was from...uh...the...from Galicia, and she spoke a\nbeautiful Polish and beautiful German and she was great admir... admirer of...uh...of German\npoetry from Heine and...uh...and she sang German Lieders to me, so I... never studied\nGerman, but I do speak and I do understand it. And...uh... she never believed that...uh....\nGerman with their culture could do anything to the Jews she said. Although we saw all the\npeople coming from Germany in 1939, she said...but...it's not so terrible. My father was very\nscared because he heard all the rumors and he came to bring us back to America in\nSeptember of 39. And my mother refused to go back to America. She said, \"Not back and\nforth. You come back to...to Europe.\" My father said, \"No,\" so he stayed in America. So\nunfortunately because of this...uh...dispute between them we stayed in Belgium. Uh...The\nGerman invaded Belgium in the beginning of May. I think...uh...around the 10th of May...I\ncannot know exactly...uh...and 10 days later we...my mother decided we cannot stay. Uh...It\nwas the war. So we took some of our possessions and we took the train direction of France.\nThe train was stopped at the...uh...I don't know how you say that. At the frontier?",
        "Q: At the border?",
        "A: At the border. And...uh...we couldn't take...uh...although we had little...few surtcases and we\nstarted to go across the border and walk in...because we didn't know where we wanted to go,\nbut as far as possible. And we started to walk through Moucron. I remember the border was\nMoucron, and we walked with the suitcases and with a lot of other people who were stopped\nthere too who...and we went to Amiens, to Cambrai and...uh...it took us about two weeks\nunder the bombing...the uh...the German with...uh... How do you say that their...their planes\nthey were...uh...shooting at us and we were...had to run in the...uh...1n the ditches for...for\nprotection and a lot of people were killed in front of us. But...uh...finally we arrived in Lille\nwhere they put us in a school. No, it was more a college, a college where they had dormitory\nand where we slept and we stayed there for a month. And...uh...then the German occupied all\nFrance, so we had to go to...towards...uh... normal life. So we...my mother rented an\napartment in Lille. I remember it was rue Solferino 142. It's funny how my memory can\nremember certain things and ___ others. Rue Solferino 142, and not far from there, I had my\nhigh school. And my husband went to his high school. And...uh...my mother had a little\nmoney so for a time things were alright. We lived...uh...and...uh...and days went by and the\nyears went by because it was from May 40 til...1 cannot say exactly when the Germans\nstarted to do all the miseries. I think it was from...uh...the beginning of 42. Uh...they asked us\nto register as Jew. We were forced to wear the...the Jewish...uh...star and...uh...we obeyed\nwhat we were...uh...uh...we're supposed to do and...uh...life went on. Unfortunately, my...my\nbrother had a birthday in July 42 and for his birthday my mother bought...brought... bought\nhim...uh...a trench coat. And...uh...this trench coat, unfortunately, cost him his life\nbecause...uh....the Jews were forced to...couldn't go where they wanted in a cafe. There was\none cafe where the Jews could go and where they gathered. And...uh...my...uh....my brother\nwas a very quiet boy and very shy and very straightforward, very honest...uh...no\nhaughtiness. Uh...he played there...him with his friend, he played chess there. And one day\nwhen he was playing there...uh...the guy of the Gestapo came and asked...uh...to whom does\nbelong that trenchcoat. And my father..my brother stupidly answered, \"It's mine.\"\nAnd...uh...there was no Jewish...uh...cross...uh...Star of David on it, so they took him to jail.\nMy mother immediately went to the Gestapo. She saw the guy of the Gestapo, and begged\nhim to release him and say...telling him it was his birthday. It's a mistake. He had it on his\nsuit, the Star of David, but not on the coat so. But nothing doing. They...they wouldn't\nrelease him. Uh...he stayed in jail in Loos. It's a section of Lille, and from there they sent him\nto...through Belgium, to Auschwitz. There were a few of them that were taken at the same\nday. And I know well that he was in Auschwitz because one of the guys who was taken\ntogether with him came back, and he told me that he was well liked with the German...they\nliked him because he...he has such a serious...uh...he was a serious nature, so he did whatever\nhe had to do. And he was alive til July 1944 because...uh...he saw him at that time and then\nhe...they were separated, and he doesn't know what happened to him. He was in Auschwitz-\nBirkenau, and he gave me his number, but I cannot remember it. He...uh...1 know that for a\nfact that he was waiting because he was born in Poland, but he was very little...a baby when\nhe came to Belgium so he didn't know the family. So he was waiting... uh...all the family\nthere, and he introduced himself to the family so he...he learned to know his family...and\nbetween them was a cousin who...who...to whom he told that he came from Lille\nand...uh...and that we...me and my mother, we were there. So after the war, this cousin by\naccident met...uh...a girl from Antwerp and...uh...uh...he himself was the son of a very\nextremely rich man who had buildings and...and...uh...uh...petroleum pit.... I don't\nknow how you call that...uh...so he sold something and...uh...because he...he couldn't take the\nmoney so he bought some gold and put it in his shoe and because he didn't want to go\ndirectly to Antwerp, he came through France and was looking a way to go through\nthe...uh...frontier. And when he passed Lille, he remembered...he remembered that he had an\naunt there, so he went to the Jewish community and asked if there was a Mrs. Zupnik here.\nAnd he found us. And he told us that he saw my brother there in the concentration, but he\nlost him also in 44, and he doesn't know what happened to him. Uh...and he went to live in\nAntwerp.",
        "Q: Tell us what happened to you and your mother after your brother was taken.",
        "A: Yes. Because...uh...my mother went to the German Gestapo, she was scared to do anything\nbecause she thought if she would escape...she would run away, there would be retaliation\nagainst him. So we stayed. We continued for one month our life and on the evening of Yom\nKippur 1n...uh....1n very early in the morning, two men of the Gestapo came into our house\nand...uh...took us. My mother put some stuff, some money away, and gave it to the...the\nlady...uh...where we lived to put it way in case...uh... uh...we escaped...uh...we wouldn't be\nwithout anything. So, but the story that happened is really like a miracle. We went to\nthe...uh...railroad. The German took us to the railroad where there were about 3,000\nfamilies...Jewish family were there and...uh...from the early morning. It was a very hot day.\nWe stayed...uh...there at the railroad waiting what the German would do with us. And I saw a\nlot of people because it was the eve of the holidays, they went to their homes and brought\nback chicken and food and it was like an entertainment party, and suddenly I see my mother\nand she said, \"Come. Come. We have to go somewhere.\" And she says...and I said, \"No, I...1\nhave my friends here. I want to stay here.\" Said, \"Come. Come. Come. You have to come.\"\nSo I followed my mother and we were taken to a room...uh...a very tiny room. We were\nabout 13 persons there. And the door they put wood on the door so the Germans wouldn't\nknow that room existed. After awhile, we heard...uh...the train...uh...leaving and the whole\nplace was very quiet because...uh...3,000 people do a lot of noise. And we stayed there and it\nwas a very scary night because we had a few...a few men who were very nervous. There was\na window and we heard the Gestapo walking back and forth. And...uh...I was...uh, I was\nalready 14 at the time.",
        "Q: Who...who came to your mother?",
        "A: A man...a man of the underground. And he asked her, \"Do you want to be saved?\" And my\nmother said, \"Yes.\" And as a matter of fact I asked my mother later, \"How come that you\ndecide to...to be saved because you were scared...uh...that something would happen.\"\nWell...then she answered me, \"I realized at that time there was nothing any more to be lost\nbecause they were taking us so I wanted to save you and myself.\" And so we were...uh...put\nin that room and men are men...very selfish...some people start to...want to smoke cigarettes\nand they put the lights and the matches and we were scared...uh...terribly because...uh...they\ncould see the lights. So we stayed...uh...1n..uh...all night there. I think around 1 o'clock men\ncame through the window. They put a ladder at the window and they took us out. And since\nthat time we were taken over by the underground. They took us...which is...uh..very curious\nstory. And it is an explanation. They took us to a whore house because this where people\nwho were...the whores. I didn't know, but they have very big hearts. They (pause)...they are\nknown for that...that...that they will do lot of things for...to save people. And we stayed in a\nwhore house for a few days, and we saw the underground coming back with guns and all\nthings and it was a very scary story. And then they came back with ...uh...false identification\nfor me and my mother and for the other peoples and we were separated. And I, as a girl,\nyoung girl, I could go to a convent. My mother could not, unfortunate, for her. So she had to\ngo on her own and...uh...it was very painful. She told me that many times she slept in the\nstreets. She had no where to go. She was in the hiding and for her, the situation was worse\nbecause she went to the Gestapo and they knew her face. And she had the false\nidentification. Uh...they gave me the name... kept my...uh...my...uh...real date of birth\nbecause I was scared to...uh...to be mixed up, and I became Helene Delcombre. And...uh...1\nwent to the convent and...uh...they were very nice to us and I[...uh...my mother was...uh...\nworried because I was going to high school and for her the studies was a very important\nthing so she made me...uh... subscribe at a school where you could send..uh...\ncorrespondence school. But it wasn't working. And I stayed there from...from September\ntil...I think a little bit after the Easter holidays. Then from...and...uh...I heard a lot of times\nthat the German were coming in...uh...the convent looking for Jewish children. There I met a\nlot of other Jewish children and I met a girl that I knew and I know a lot of babies were\ntaken. A lot of people of saved that we don't know about it but...uh...uh....one person were\ntelling the other. Just by ear we found out that...uh...that the French people were\nextraordinary. And...uh...to them when they...when the people say that they were anti-\nSemites, they didn't even know what it was to be Jewish. They thought we\nwere....uh...like...uh...des Auvergnats.' They were cheap with the money. It's a part of section\nof France where people are very...I don't know the right expression...one penny is a penny.\nThey don't want to spend it. So they thought Jews are like these people. So to say that they\nwere anti-Semite, it's the wrong thing because they didn't even know that...uh...what exactly\nis a Jew and physically the Jews looked like I and my mother who comes from an extremely\nreligious fam...family. She looks like a Polish girl, like a Polish peasant with...uh...the cheeks\nand the nose. Uh...it's amazing.",
        "Q: What was life like daily in the convent?",
        "A: In the convent? I was supposed to have the normal life from the children. I was not\nsupposed... didn't tell no one that...uh...only one girl that I knew from the outside. I\nrecognized her. The other children didn't know that I had to conform to the rules. I had to go\neveryday to Mass with the...I...1 was doing except I didn't take...uh...I don't know...the...uh...1\ndidn't take the whole __ because I didn't go to confession. But except of this, I was doing\nexactly like the...uh...the other girls because....uh...I didn't want to attract attention...uh...to\nwhom I was. I was normal to do exactly like the other children.",
        "Q: And what did you do during the day?",
        "A: Well, early morning we went to Mass. Uh...They were children that...uh...uh...uh...our Lady\nof the Good Shepherd...that was the convent that I went...and there were children\nthat...uh...had thing...they were children how...I don't know how to say that. That did things\nthat were not right. They were...or vagrant or children that did things that were not...uh...right\nfor children to do. The rebellious children...uh...were...but they were very young.\nSome...uh...some were from...uh...the age of six til...uh... til...uh...16 because...uh...16 you\nare...in France you could work. So....\nPeople from the French region of Auvergne",
        "Q: How did you get along with the other children?",
        "A: Very well because...uh...why not? (Chuckle) I am a French girl like every French girl and I\ndon't look Jewish at all. Nobody could...uh...guess...uh...anything and I...and I was smart\nenough...uh...not to talk about this things. Uh.... went to Mass. I ate. I...uh...I...uh...we\nhad...uh.... religious... uh...blessings...uh.... did whatever the other  children...we\ndid...uh...some work...uh...some hand knitting, some...uh... embroideries. Whatever the other\nchildren did, I did. And...uh...a little bit I did some school by correspondence, but it wasn't\ngood. So my mother decided that I had to go back to high school. So then we were taken\nover by the Protestant community. Uh... remember the name was Mr. Pausch, and this was\nin...1 was staying in Lille, and this was in Roubaix which was... uh...there were three cities\naround Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing, which were about...uh...half an hour distant one of the\nother.",
        "Q: Did you see your mother often? How did you get from the convent to the Protestant\ncommunity.",
        "A: I never went out from the convent...uh...unless I had an operation from the amigdales. How\ndo you say that? How do you say that. I had to have the...uh...",
        "Q: Tonsils?",
        "A: The tonsils removed. That's the only time I went out. My mother came to see me and brought\nme food. I don't know how she did it, but...uh...she still found the time to and the money to\ngive moe...uh...because it was...uh...very very hard time. We were eating bread\nwith...uh...sawdust in the bread. It was...uh...very bad bread. The food was terrible. It was\nwar, and many times we had...uh...we heard English plane coming and bombing. It was war.\nIt wasn't... uh..easy time for no one and... So she decided I should go to school. So she...I\ndon't know how she found out the Protestant community, and they gave us some lodging\nsomewhere outside of Roubaix and I was enrolled in the Roubaix High School. It was very\ndifficult thing because in that school I met a girl that I was in school in Lille and she knew\nmy real name. And suddenly from Helene Zupnik, I became Helene Delcombre. And I didn't\nknow how to do it. I was young. I was 15 years old and I was very childish at the time. But\nthen I had an idea. I knew she was...uh...a scout. So I took her on the side, and I told her,\n\"You know I want to tell you a story, but you have to tell...to swear me on your scout's honor\nthat you will not tell nobody...uh ...what's the true story. I am a Jewish girl, and I have false\nidentification paper and nobody's supposed to know it.\" She said, \"Don't worry. I will not\ntell anyone.\" And the irony 1s that I didn't know that at the time, but that girl herself was half\nJewish. And so...uh... uh...I stayed in that school...uh...til the end of the war. But I didn't\nstay...you see the thing 1s that every day life to be in...uh...people get tired to be...uh...helpful\nto others. You know it's not easy to take the...uh...uh...the mother and the daughter. They live\nand after awhile, the cohabitation with that person was difficult so we had to move and my\nmother found a place in Tourcoing. She found a lot...a very miserable place, but we didn't\nhave where to go so we were happy to go there. And I continued to go to Roubaix.\nAnd...uh...I spoke to that girl because...uh... she...she...she was the only knew...one who\nknew her...my identify and I told her, \"You know, we are living in Tourcoing in a miserable\nplace and with the bombing all the time and the cold. We didn't have what to heat.\" So she\ncame her...her parents were very rich, extremely rich. Uh...uh...Her father was a kind\nof...uh...nobility and she said...she spoke to her parents and she said, \"You know what? I\nhave an idea. I will take you in my...uh...we have the gardener's house there. And she\npresented me to her mother and her father who were very nice and she took me out...in their\nhouse where we stayed til the liberation. And they never told us what they really were. After\nthe war in December of 44, I had the surprise of a cousin who came and found me there. His\nname was Jerry Balomich from...uh...he lives in (pause)...at the time he lived in Brooklyn.\nAnd he found me. By miracle. How he found me, he first looked at the first high school, and\nhe met somebody that I met a few days before who I told I was going to the Lyc\u00e9e of\nRoubaix and it's unbelievable, but he found me. Then...uh...he could report to my father that\nwe were alive.",
        "Q: Had you had no contact with your father at this point?",
        "A: I received...uh...a letter of the Red Cross in...1n 1941 from my father. That's the only contact I\nhad. So he knew we were alive in 41, but afterwards he didn't know.",
        "Q: What happened after the liberation?",
        "A: ..happy time and we were waiting that...uh...my brother would come back and my father\nwas writing. He said we should come to America. And my mother said, \"Yes, but I have to\nwait first that my...uh...son comes back.\" And we went to Paris to the different\norganization...organization to find out 1f...1f he was still alive and he was coming back, but\nwe never...uh...we never got any news about him and we never knew except by...by these\ntwo witness who came back who told me that they...he was in Auschwitz-Birkenau, where\nhe was alive til July 44. Then I have no...no other news and...uh...he never came back.",
        "Q: You said your husband was in high school with you.",
        "A: My husband. No. My husband came from Rumania. How could he come here?",
        "Q: No. That's what I wondered.",
        "A: No, no, no. No, no, no. Uh...no no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Do you want to know more about my life afterwards?",
        "Q: Yes. Tell me about the...the early years after the war.",
        "A: After the war I continued to go to high school. And...uh... my father was much younger than\nmy mother. And he was a very religious Jew and...uh...because he lost his son he wanted to\nhave another son. So it was very important for him so and because she couldn't bear any\nchildren, he divorced my mother and...uh...I remained...uh...1n France and he remained in...in\nAmerica. And it was a terrible shock to me. I went into a deep depression because of that\nand...uh...1 couldn't study anymore. And...uh...I got married very early. In 19...1n December\n1948 and I had a daughter and in 51...uh...when my father died, I couldn't stand my husband\nanymore. And I divorced him. And in 56, I met my second husband who came from Israel\nand...uh...we moved to Paris and we start a new life. Unfortunately, in ...uh...June 18, 1959, a\ncar struck my daughter and she died the same day. And life goes on. And...uh...my husband\nalways dreamed of America. Uh...As soon as he became French in...uh...in 66, the first thing\nhe did, he came to visit America. He had...he...he also was a third generation of America. His\ngrandfather came here from Rumania to...to Israel where he wasn't successful and then he\ncame to America and Canada because it was difficult at that time to come to America from\nCanada. They went to Philadelphia. And...uh...he loved America too when he came to visit\nin 66. And...uh...1n 69 we came. In June, as a matter of fact, the same day as my daughter\ndied. June 18, 1969 we came to America, and we became American citizens. My husband\ndied in...uh...May 29, 1980, and...uh...I remained alone.",
        "Q: Have you...uh...made contact with your family.",
        "A: Oh sure. Oh sure. I was...uh...accept[ed] with open arms. I'm _ the...prodigal...prodigal\nchild...uh...because...uh...coming back to the...they knew me as a child.",
        "Q: Do you have family here?",
        "A: Unfortunately, most of them died now and...uh...now I am alone...uh...and it's very hard.",
        "Q: All right. Thank you. Was it so hard as you thought?",
        "A: When you start you...it goes, it flows. (laughter)\nIt is...uh...something very funny that...uh...it's tragic comedy at the same time. Uh...the lady\nwho accepted her... us to stay in her gardener's house was very nice to us and said goodbye\nto us when we moved away and we lived in another section of Lille. And...uh...over the years\nwe lost contact with her. But when I got married, my mother got very ill, and she couldn't\nstay by herself and in Paris we lived in a very small apartment and we couldn't...uh...keep her\nwith us. So she went to the Rothschild Institution and she was accepted there. There she met\na gentleman that she liked very much because he was a German Jew and she spoke a perfect\nGerman, so she found her alter ego. And...uh...1t was a little love affair. He was (laughter)\nalready 84 and she was in her...1n her early 60s, so she was a beauty for him. And...uh...it\nwas by an irony...by a twist of fate, this gentleman was the uncle of the mother of my friend\nin school. So then I found out...uh...10 years later that the mother who received me in her\nhouse herself was a Jewish lady.",
        "Q: And that was the first you knew that?",
        "A: That's the first time I found out. They never told me. Montaigne was the name of her\nhusband. I can't remember the name of the gentleman who was very good to my mother\nbecause...uh...she had Parkinson Disease. And...uh...she broke her ankle, and she\nwas...uh...taken to the hospital and he sustained her very much. But the irony is that he was\nthe uncle of the lady who saved her...us in her garden.",
        "Q: Do you have any other memories of the war years?",
        "A: Like what? What kind of memories? What we did through...during the war or...1t was war\ntime. Uh...but life goes on. Uh...[ am a young...uh...girl...uh... I went to school. I...uh...L...I\nlived a normal life, but with false identification papers.",
        "Q: What was...what were the nuns like in the convent?",

        "A: My name is Helene Baraf, named Zupnik. I am born in Antwerp, Belgium, the 24th of July\n1927.",
        "A: Uh...I will start to tell you a little bit about my...uh... ancestors. Uh...[ come from two very\nfamous branches... uh...of...uh...the Jewish religion. My great grand uncle was...uh...Rabbi\nMeisels (ph) who has a synagogue named ... uh...after him in Prague and on my father's side\nI have Rabbi Dovelando (ph), who was very famous too, who has another synagogue\nnamed...uh...after him. Uh...my mother came from a very religious family. She had four\nbrothers and four sisters. And...uh...she was the only who survived the Holocaust, and they\nall had many, many children because that was the way of life in that time. And...uh...she was\nalready...uh...an older person when she met my....my father who came from Czechoslovakia\nand she accepted to...to marry him after refusing many, many suitors. And...uh...they lived in\nKrakow for one year...uh...where my brother was born in 1924, in July 26, 1924. And after\nthe...they stayed uncast. That means that....uh...her brother was...uh... keeping them for a\nyear where my father...when my father was studying. And then after the time was gone, they\ncame to Belgtum where I was born the 24th of July 1927. Uh...I grew up there, and we\nlived...uh...nicely. My father and my mother...1n the beginning were working in the\ndiamonds business. She was a Schleifer which means she was, I don't know how to say that\nin English...she...they were...he...she was not a cutter. A Schleifer is what a polisher...a\ndiamond polisher and...uh...little by little my father became...uh...courtier. Is that an English\nword? Courtier? Uh...He was selling for other diamonds and...uh...uh...life became easier\nand...uh...1 was going as a child in...uh...in the...and my first language was French so I went\nto grammar school in Belgium and on Wednesday afternoon and Sunday morning I went to\nJewish school. My brother went to a Jewish school for...uh...the whole day where he learned\nHebrew and Jewish and...uh...French and Flemish. Uh...in...in 1940 when I\nfinished...uh...no...let's go back to 1937...uh...when I came to American. To tell you the story\nwhy we came to America is because...uh...by great grandfather died here in America in\n1936. They came, I think, after the First World War here with all the children but my\ngrandmother was already married in...uh...1n Czechoslovakia so she was...uh...I think she\nwas the oldest daughter. So she remained with her husband and her children there in\nCzechoslovakia. This is why I have...uh...in reality I am a third generation already American\nbecause... uh...my family is here. So my father came here to America to...for the question of\nthe inheritance. And he liked it so much because he found all the family here that he didn't\nknow. His cousins, his uncles...uh...1t was...uh...very happy situation for him. So he wanted\nto immigrate. And we immigrated really to America in September of 37. For me as a child it\nwas a shock because it was in the depression era and...uh...we lived in the low east side.\nWe...compared to what...how we lived in New York or...in Antwerp, was a big difference. It\nwas a misery compared to that. And...uh...although I...I loved to be with all these cousins that\nI didn't know but...uh...unfortunately they send me to school...uh...as a....with the beginners. I\nwas already 10 at the time and it was very hard for me because I didn't spoke the language.\nMy brother, who was three years older, and finished already grammar school, immediately\nentered to high school and instead to be in the sixth...I don't know...in the first year, they sent\nhim immediately in the third grade. I don't know to compare that with the American. So he\nwas very happy. I was very unhappy here, and I cried a lot and...uh...it...because it was a very\ndifficult time at that time with the depression and my...my mother and father had a lot of\ndifficulties making out. So we came to the conclusion that...uh...maybe it would be easier for\nmy father if we send...we went back...uh...to Antwerp and...uh...this is what they decided to\ndo. We went...me and my brother and my mother, we went back to Antwerp and my father\nstayed here in America. My mother was from...uh...the...from Galicia, and she spoke a\nbeautiful Polish and beautiful German and she was great admir... admirer of...uh...of German\npoetry from Heine and...uh...and she sang German Lieders to me, so I... never studied\nGerman, but I do speak and I do understand it. And...uh... she never believed that...uh....\nGerman with their culture could do anything to the Jews she said. Although we saw all the\npeople coming from Germany in 1939, she said...but...it's not so terrible. My father was very\nscared because he heard all the rumors and he came to bring us back to America in\nSeptember of 39. And my mother refused to go back to America. She said, \"Not back and\nforth. You come back to...to Europe.\" My father said, \"No,\" so he stayed in America. So\nunfortunately because of this...uh...dispute between them we stayed in Belgium. Uh...The\nGerman invaded Belgium in the beginning of May. I think...uh...around the 10th of May...I\ncannot know exactly...uh...and 10 days later we...my mother decided we cannot stay. Uh...It\nwas the war. So we took some of our possessions and we took the train direction of France.\nThe train was stopped at the...uh...I don't know how you say that. At the frontier?",
        "A: At the border. And...uh...we couldn't take...uh...although we had little...few surtcases and we\nstarted to go across the border and walk in...because we didn't know where we wanted to go,\nbut as far as possible. And we started to walk through Moucron. I remember the border was\nMoucron, and we walked with the suitcases and with a lot of other people who were stopped\nthere too who...and we went to Amiens, to Cambrai and...uh...it took us about two weeks\nunder the bombing...the uh...the German with...uh... How do you say that their...their planes\nthey were...uh...shooting at us and we were...had to run in the...uh...1n the ditches for...for\nprotection and a lot of people were killed in front of us. But...uh...finally we arrived in Lille\nwhere they put us in a school. No, it was more a college, a college where they had dormitory\nand where we slept and we stayed there for a month. And...uh...then the German occupied all\nFrance, so we had to go to...towards...uh... normal life. So we...my mother rented an\napartment in Lille. I remember it was rue Solferino 142. It's funny how my memory can\nremember certain things and ___ others. Rue Solferino 142, and not far from there, I had my\nhigh school. And my husband went to his high school. And...uh...my mother had a little\nmoney so for a time things were alright. We lived...uh...and...uh...and days went by and the\nyears went by because it was from May 40 til...1 cannot say exactly when the Germans\nstarted to do all the miseries. I think it was from...uh...the beginning of 42. Uh...they asked us\nto register as Jew. We were forced to wear the...the Jewish...uh...star and...uh...we obeyed\nwhat we were...uh...uh...we're supposed to do and...uh...life went on. Unfortunately, my...my\nbrother had a birthday in July 42 and for his birthday my mother bought...brought... bought\nhim...uh...a trench coat. And...uh...this trench coat, unfortunately, cost him his life\nbecause...uh....the Jews were forced to...couldn't go where they wanted in a cafe. There was\none cafe where the Jews could go and where they gathered. And...uh...my...uh....my brother\nwas a very quiet boy and very shy and very straightforward, very honest...uh...no\nhaughtiness. Uh...he played there...him with his friend, he played chess there. And one day\nwhen he was playing there...uh...the guy of the Gestapo came and asked...uh...to whom does\nbelong that trenchcoat. And my father..my brother stupidly answered, \"It's mine.\"\nAnd...uh...there was no Jewish...uh...cross...uh...Star of David on it, so they took him to jail.\nMy mother immediately went to the Gestapo. She saw the guy of the Gestapo, and begged\nhim to release him and say...telling him it was his birthday. It's a mistake. He had it on his\nsuit, the Star of David, but not on the coat so. But nothing doing. They...they wouldn't\nrelease him. Uh...he stayed in jail in Loos. It's a section of Lille, and from there they sent him\nto...through Belgium, to Auschwitz. There were a few of them that were taken at the same\nday. And I know well that he was in Auschwitz because one of the guys who was taken\ntogether with him came back, and he told me that he was well liked with the German...they\nliked him because he...he has such a serious...uh...he was a serious nature, so he did whatever\nhe had to do. And he was alive til July 1944 because...uh...he saw him at that time and then\nhe...they were separated, and he doesn't know what happened to him. He was in Auschwitz-\nBirkenau, and he gave me his number, but I cannot remember it. He...uh...1 know that for a\nfact that he was waiting because he was born in Poland, but he was very little...a baby when\nhe came to Belgium so he didn't know the family. So he was waiting... uh...all the family\nthere, and he introduced himself to the family so he...he learned to know his family...and\nbetween them was a cousin who...who...to whom he told that he came from Lille\nand...uh...and that we...me and my mother, we were there. So after the war, this cousin by\naccident met...uh...a girl from Antwerp and...uh...uh...he himself was the son of a very\nextremely rich man who had buildings and...and...uh...uh...petroleum pit.... I don't\nknow how you call that...uh...so he sold something and...uh...because he...he couldn't take the\nmoney so he bought some gold and put it in his shoe and because he didn't want to go\ndirectly to Antwerp, he came through France and was looking a way to go through\nthe...uh...frontier. And when he passed Lille, he remembered...he remembered that he had an\naunt there, so he went to the Jewish community and asked if there was a Mrs. Zupnik here.\nAnd he found us. And he told us that he saw my brother there in the concentration, but he\nlost him also in 44, and he doesn't know what happened to him. Uh...and he went to live in\nAntwerp.",
        "A: Yes. Because...uh...my mother went to the German Gestapo, she was scared to do anything\nbecause she thought if she would escape...she would run away, there would be retaliation\nagainst him. So we stayed. We continued for one month our life and on the evening of Yom\nKippur 1n...uh....1n very early in the morning, two men of the Gestapo came into our house\nand...uh...took us. My mother put some stuff, some money away, and gave it to the...the\nlady...uh...where we lived to put it way in case...uh... uh...we escaped...uh...we wouldn't be\nwithout anything. So, but the story that happened is really like a miracle. We went to\nthe...uh...railroad. The German took us to the railroad where there were about 3,000\nfamilies...Jewish family were there and...uh...from the early morning. It was a very hot day.\nWe stayed...uh...there at the railroad waiting what the German would do with us. And I saw a\nlot of people because it was the eve of the holidays, they went to their homes and brought\nback chicken and food and it was like an entertainment party, and suddenly I see my mother\nand she said, \"Come. Come. We have to go somewhere.\" And she says...and I said, \"No, I...1\nhave my friends here. I want to stay here.\" Said, \"Come. Come. Come. You have to come.\"\nSo I followed my mother and we were taken to a room...uh...a very tiny room. We were\nabout 13 persons there. And the door they put wood on the door so the Germans wouldn't\nknow that room existed. After awhile, we heard...uh...the train...uh...leaving and the whole\nplace was very quiet because...uh...3,000 people do a lot of noise. And we stayed there and it\nwas a very scary night because we had a few...a few men who were very nervous. There was\na window and we heard the Gestapo walking back and forth. And...uh...I was...uh, I was\nalready 14 at the time.",
        "A: A man...a man of the underground. And he asked her, \"Do you want to be saved?\" And my\nmother said, \"Yes.\" And as a matter of fact I asked my mother later, \"How come that you\ndecide to...to be saved because you were scared...uh...that something would happen.\"\nWell...then she answered me, \"I realized at that time there was nothing any more to be lost\nbecause they were taking us so I wanted to save you and myself.\" And so we were...uh...put\nin that room and men are men...very selfish...some people start to...want to smoke cigarettes\nand they put the lights and the matches and we were scared...uh...terribly because...uh...they\ncould see the lights. So we stayed...uh...1n..uh...all night there. I think around 1 o'clock men\ncame through the window. They put a ladder at the window and they took us out. And since\nthat time we were taken over by the underground. They took us...which is...uh..very curious\nstory. And it is an explanation. They took us to a whore house because this where people\nwho were...the whores. I didn't know, but they have very big hearts. They (pause)...they are\nknown for that...that...that they will do lot of things for...to save people. And we stayed in a\nwhore house for a few days, and we saw the underground coming back with guns and all\nthings and it was a very scary story. And then they came back with ...uh...false identification\nfor me and my mother and for the other peoples and we were separated. And I, as a girl,\nyoung girl, I could go to a convent. My mother could not, unfortunate, for her. So she had to\ngo on her own and...uh...it was very painful. She told me that many times she slept in the\nstreets. She had no where to go. She was in the hiding and for her, the situation was worse\nbecause she went to the Gestapo and they knew her face. And she had the false\nidentification. Uh...they gave me the name... kept my...uh...my...uh...real date of birth\nbecause I was scared to...uh...to be mixed up, and I became Helene Delcombre. And...uh...1\nwent to the convent and...uh...they were very nice to us and I[...uh...my mother was...uh...\nworried because I was going to high school and for her the studies was a very important\nthing so she made me...uh... subscribe at a school where you could send..uh...\ncorrespondence school. But it wasn't working. And I stayed there from...from September\ntil...I think a little bit after the Easter holidays. Then from...and...uh...I heard a lot of times\nthat the German were coming in...uh...the convent looking for Jewish children. There I met a\nlot of other Jewish children and I met a girl that I knew and I know a lot of babies were\ntaken. A lot of people of saved that we don't know about it but...uh...uh....one person were\ntelling the other. Just by ear we found out that...uh...that the French people were\nextraordinary. And...uh...to them when they...when the people say that they were anti-\nSemites, they didn't even know what it was to be Jewish. They thought we\nwere....uh...like...uh...des Auvergnats.' They were cheap with the money. It's a part of section\nof France where people are very...I don't know the right expression...one penny is a penny.\nThey don't want to spend it. So they thought Jews are like these people. So to say that they\nwere anti-Semite, it's the wrong thing because they didn't even know that...uh...what exactly\nis a Jew and physically the Jews looked like I and my mother who comes from an extremely\nreligious fam...family. She looks like a Polish girl, like a Polish peasant with...uh...the cheeks\nand the nose. Uh...it's amazing.",
        "A: In the convent? I was supposed to have the normal life from the children. I was not\nsupposed... didn't tell no one that...uh...only one girl that I knew from the outside. I\nrecognized her. The other children didn't know that I had to conform to the rules. I had to go\neveryday to Mass with the...I...1 was doing except I didn't take...uh...I don't know...the...uh...1\ndidn't take the whole __ because I didn't go to confession. But except of this, I was doing\nexactly like the...uh...the other girls because....uh...I didn't want to attract attention...uh...to\nwhom I was.

        "A: Well, early morning we went to Mass. Uh...They were children that...uh...uh...uh...our Lady\nof the Good Shepherd...that was the convent that I went...and there were children\nthat...uh...had thing...they were children how...I don't know how to say that. That did things\nthat were not right. They were...or vagrant or children that did things that were not...uh...right\nfor children to do. The rebellious children...uh...were...but they were very young.\nSome...uh...some were from...uh...the age of six til...uh... til...uh...16 because...uh...16 you\nare...in France you could work.

        "A: Very well because...uh...why not? (Chuckle) I am a French girl like every French girl and I\ndon't look Jewish at all. Nobody could...uh...guess...uh...anything and I...and I was smart\nenough...uh...not to talk about this things. Uh.... went to Mass. I ate. I...uh...I...uh...we\nhad...uh.... religious... uh...blessings...uh.... did whatever the other  children...we\ndid...uh...some work...uh...some hand knitting, some...uh... embroideries. Whatever the other\nchildren did, I did. And...uh...a little bit I did some school by correspondence, but it wasn't\ngood. So my mother decided that I had to go back to high school. So then we were taken\nover by the Protestant community. Uh... remember the name was Mr. Pausch, and this was\nin...1 was staying in Lille, and this was in Roubaix which was... uh...there were three cities\naround Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing, which were about...uh...half an hour distant one of the\nother.",
        "A: I never went out from the convent...uh...unless I had an operation from the amigdales. How\ndo you say that? How do you say that. I had to have the...uh...",
        "A: The tonsils removed. That's the only time I went out. My mother came to see me and brought\nme food. I don't know how she did it, but...uh...she still found the time to and the money to\ngive moe...uh...because it was...uh...very very hard time. We were eating bread\nwith...uh...sawdust in the bread. It was...uh...very bad bread. The food was terrible. It was\nwar, and many times we had...uh...we heard English plane coming and bombing. It was war.\nIt wasn't... uh..easy time for no one and... So she decided I should go to school. So she...I\ndon't know how she found out the Protestant community, and they gave us some lodging\nsomewhere outside of Roubaix and I was enrolled in the Roubaix High School. It was very\ndifficult thing because in that school I met a girl that I was in school in Lille and she knew\nmy real name. And suddenly from Helene Zupnik, I became Helene Delcombre. And I didn't\nknow how to do it. I was young. I was 15 years old and I was very childish at the time. But\nthen I had an idea. I knew she was...uh...a scout. So I took her on the side, and I told her,\n\"You know I want to tell you a story, but you have to tell...to swear me on your scout's honor\nthat you will not tell nobody...uh ...what's the true story. I am a Jewish girl, and I have false\nidentification paper and nobody's supposed to know it.\" She said, \"Don't worry. I will not\ntell anyone.\" And the irony 1s that I didn't know that at the time, but that girl herself was half\nJewish. And so...uh... uh...I stayed in that school...uh...til the end of the war. But I didn't\nstay...you see the thing 1s that every day life to be in...uh...people get tired to be...uh...helpful\nto others. You know it's not easy to take the...uh...uh...the mother and the daughter. They live\nand after awhile, the cohabitation with that person was difficult so we had to move and my\nmother found a place in Tourcoing. She found a lot...a very miserable place, but we didn't\nhave where to go so we were happy to go there. And I continued to go to Roubaix.\nAnd...uh...I spoke to that girl because...uh... she...she...she was the only knew...one who\nknew her...my identify and I told her, \"You know, we are living in Tourcoing in a miserable\nplace and with the bombing all the time and the cold. We didn't have what to heat.\" So she\ncame her...her parents were very rich, extremely rich. Uh...uh...Her father was a kind\nof...uh...nobility and she said...she spoke to her parents and she said, \"You know what? I\nhave an idea. I will take you in my...uh...we have the gardener's house there. And she\npresented me to her mother and her father who were very nice and she took me out...in their\nhouse where we stayed til the liberation. And they never told us what they really were. After\nthe war in December of 44, I had the surprise of a cousin who came and found me there. His\nname was Jerry Balomich from...uh...he lives in (pause)...at the time he lived in Brooklyn.\nAnd he found me. By miracle. How he found me, he first looked at the first high school, and\nhe met somebody that I met a few days before who I told I was going to the Lyc\u00e9e of\nRoubaix and it's unbelievable, but he found me. Then...uh...he could report to my father that\nwe were alive.",
        "A: I received...uh...a letter of the Red Cross in...1n 1941 from my father. That's the only contact I\nhad. So he knew we were alive in 41, but afterwards he didn't know.",

Uh...the lady\nwho accepted her... us to stay in her gardener's house was very nice to us and said goodbye\nto us when we moved away and we lived in another section of Lille. And...uh...over the years\nwe lost contact with her. But when I got married, my mother got very ill, and she couldn't\nstay by herself and in Paris we lived in a very small apartment and we couldn't...uh...keep her\nwith us.

Life goes on...uh...and you are taken by many occupations and\npreoccupation and...uh...you forget and...uh...[ thought that 1t was important to tell these\nthings because many people say it never happened so before I die I want to bear witness to\nthese things because I...I1 suffered them and...uh...unfortunately I lost so many people\nbecause of it, and people say it never happened.",
