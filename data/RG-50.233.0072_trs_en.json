        "1\nLIEBMANN, Hanna\nRG- 50.233*0072\nInterviewed on March 28, 1992\nTwo audiocassettes\nAbstract",
        "Hanna Liebmann was born Hannah Hirsh in Karlsruhe, Germany on November 28, 1924. Her\nfather Max, a successful photographer, died within 12 weeks after her birth. Hanna, her older brother,\nand mother lived in a very comfortable home. Hanna went to public school, where Jews were\nharassed. In 1936, she was forced to transfer to the Jewish school which had opened in September,\nand was shared with mentally retarded students. On the day of Kristallnacht, the showcases in\nHanna\u2019s home were smashed, all Jewish men were arrested, and the conservative synagogue was\nburned. Hanna was sent to a boarding school near Hanover where she stayed until August 1940 when\nher mother made her return after the mother\u2019s arm became so inflamed that she couldn\u2019t move it.\nHanna\u2019s brother had moved to America. On October 22, 1940, 12 men arrested Hanna, aged 16, her\nmother, three aunts, and 91-and-a-half year-old grandmother at the home they shared. They were on\none of nine trains that took three days to arrive in Oloron Sainte-Marie. At Oloron Sainte-Marie,\nHanna and her family were sent to the Gurs camp. The camp had mud knee-deep, raging dysentery,\nbut a \u201ctremendous cultural life\u2019 including chamber music and cabaret. Hanna worked in the camp\u2019s\noffice where she met her future husband. Swiss Red Cross provided some food. A social worker asked\nHanna\u2019s mother to allow her to go to the village Le Chambon-sur-Lignon where young people were\nhelped to survive. After about 11 months in Gurs, Hanna left in September 1941 for Le Chambon.\nWhen Germans came to Le Chambon, Hanna was hidden by various people, including farmers who\nbuilt a hiding place in woodpiles. In February 1943, she made her way alone to Switzerland. She\ncontacted an aunt, and lived with the family until late December 1944. Hanna ran away because the\nfamily could not understand what she had been through, and Hanna came close to a nervous\nbreakdown. She made her way to Geneva where she reconnected with her future husband, and worked\nas a maid. They had a daughter, and remained in Switzerland until 1948 when the Swiss declined to\nlet them stay. They immigrated to the United States in 1948. Also after the war, Hanna\u2019s two\nsurviving aunts immigrated to Cuba, and then to the United States. Five family members survived,\nincluding two cousins who were deported from Prague to Theresienstadt, then Auschwitz, and labor\ncamps. Fourteen family members died. She concluded, \u201cin spite of it all, life has been good to us.\u201d",
        "2\nTape I, Side A\nAnthony: Today is March 28, 1992. My name is Anthony Di Iorio and I am at the home of Mrs.\nHanna Liebmann, Bayside, New York. I am here to interview her about her experiences and those of\nher family during the Holocaust. Good evening.\nHanna: Good evening, Tony. I am Hanna Liebmann. I was born on November 28, 1924 in Karlsruhe,\nGermany as the second child of Max and Ella Hirsh nee Traub. I had an older brother. My father died\nwithin 12 weeks after my birth which left my mother a widow. She raised us very well. My father was\nin business, he was a photographer. He started his business in 1901. He was then 21 years old with\nthis younger brother who was twenty and not yet of age and couldn't put his signature on any business\npapers. Within a year my father had acquired a title as hufphotograph, grand-duke of Baden and, of\ncourse, subsequently to other small courts and what have-you. At the time he opened his business in\n1901, he was actually despised by the rest of the Jewish population in Karlsruhe for going into such a\nprofession because no Jew had ever done that before. A year later, when he had become known and\nhad made his reputation, he was the darling of the town. It\u2019s true.\nAnthony: Jewish and non-Jewish?\nHanna: Right. So...\nAnthony: He was the Grand-Duke of Court.\nHanna: Grand-Duke of Court, right. In any case, we grew up in Germany in a very comfortable\nhome. It is true that we grew up without a father; our mother was a very good mother. She continued\nto run the business and did so till 1938, December 31 when we had to give up the business due to the\nlaws in Germany. I started school, I believe, in 1930, I'm not quite sure of this anymore. I went to\npublic school in Germany till 1936. I did have, in public school, gentile girlfriends, very good gentile\ngirlfriends. But after 1935, I did not dare being friends with them because it would have been too\ndangerous for their parents who were in business and probably would have had to bear the\nconsequences of their children having a Jewish girlfriend.\nAnthony: Did you leave school in '36?\nHanna: I left school in '36 in order to enter Jewish school. All Jewish children whose fathers were not\nWorld War I veterans and front-line service had to enter Jewish schools.\nAnthony: So you had to leave the public schools?\nHanna: We had to leave the public school and enter Jewish school.\nAnthony: This would be the fall of '36?",
        "3\nHanna: The fall of '36, yes. It so happens the school year actually starts in Europe, at that time,\nstarted at Easter time. But we had--the Jewish school was opened in September of 1936.\nAnthony: This was a new Jewish school or an older one?\nHanna: No, it was brand new. It had to be created. We did not have in Karlsruhe a private Jewish\nschool like there was in Frankfurt, the Philanthropin. We had to go to this school, we had no choice.\nWe had wonderful Jewish teachers. We were housed in a school building, a public school building\nthat was set aside for the mentally retarded. We shared this school building with them. However, we\nwere not allowed to share with them, the courtyard. They had to stay on one side and we had to stay\non the other side of the courtyard during recess. School was okay, we were no longer exposed to the\nharassment that we had endured in public school. So this part was okay. We come to November '38,\nthe Kristallnacht. In the morning I went to school like any other day. On my way to the school, I saw\nthe fire engines standing in front of a building where the orthodox Jewish community was housed.\nNow it was very strange; there was a building in front, you went through a courtyard and then came\nthe synagogue. The fire engines were standing there and I didn't see any fire. I didn't see anything.\nWhen I came to school, I said very loudly to my friends, you know the fire engines are standing in\nfront of that synagogue. They all looked at me and said, don't you know what happened? I said, no,\nwhat's going on? And here were some of the girls in tears because their fathers had been arrested.\nBeing that there was no male in our house, obviously they didn't come to arrest anybody. What they\ndid while I was away in school, is that they smashed all our showcases. I think they kept us in school\nfor about two hours because again the male teachers were absent--they had been arrested. There were\nsome female teachers and they made us write some silly composition. Around ten o'clock, they let us\ngo home. When I came home and approached the house we lived in, I saw my mother in the street\nwith a broom sweeping up the glass from all of the showcases. I had never seen my mother sweep the\nstreet. Around my mother, were a lot of people screaming and whistling and making fun of her. Our\nemployee, which we had at that time, still in the business, a very decent person; his name was Josef\nKohlmann, he's still alive, wanted to sweep the street for my mother. She would not let him because\nshe was afraid he would be killed in the process or at least harmed, let's put it that way. The next thing\nI knew, I heard that the conservative synagogue also had been put on fire. I think Kristallnacht was on\na Thursday because I realized all of a sudden that on Friday night, we would not be going to\nsynagogue for services. It wasn't that I was so religious but I did belong to the choir. This was a\nchildren's choir and so that was the big thing to go there, not for services but a choir. What can I tell\nyou? It was a horrible thing. The men were arrested. We heard all sorts of things that had been\nhappening. My aunts' business was somehow spared. They had no showcases, there were no men in\nthe household and there was a very peculiar situation in the house where my aunts lived. Downstairs\nwas a business that dealt in wallpapers and things like that.\nAnthony: Which aunt was this?\nHanna: My aunts who had the dressmaking business.\nAnthony: These were the ---?",
        "4\nHanna: Traubs.\nAnthony: Two aunts.\nHanna: Three, actually. Their apartment was on the second floor and the business was on the third.\nBut the son of these people who owned the house and the business had been a man who went to\nFrance very early in 1933. They were not Jewish. Every so often he would come home with his car,\nwith the French license plate and drive this car into the entrance of the house. It was sort of built like\nthe French houses where there's a big door to go in and then there's an entrance--okay. You could just\ndrive the car in. He would place it in such a way that you could not get to the staircase. So nobody\ncould go up. They see-the Nazis saw a car with a foreign license plate, they would turn around.\nAnthony: They left it alone?\nHanna: They left it alone. So they were spared. He did the same thing on the first of April, 1933. It\nnever dawned on us till later on what this was really all about. What the man actually did. Much,\nmuch later--only a couple of years ago I found out what it really was all about. This man had\nsmuggled Jews and others from Germany to France. He would come at night with his car with the\nFrench license plate, take the people to France with his parents' passports, German passports, passed\nthe border into France at night and take the people over. He did this apparently on quite a regular\nbasis. So he made it his business to be there on the Ist of April of 1933 so my aunts were very nicely\nprotected. He was there again on the tenth of November when the Kristallnacht happened. So at least\nthey were protected. This was 1938. School became a sometime affair for quite a few months. We\nwould have maybe school three times a week for two hours. What we would have was English,\nGerman and arithmetic. That was about all that could be taught at the time. It lasted probably two,\nthree months before all the male teachers were back and school started to fall back into place. At this\npoint so many of the young people had left that we were moved out of the building where the retarded\nchildren were to entirely a building belonging to the Jewish community next to the burned-out\nsynagogue. School took place there. Makeshift, as more children left, the classes became smaller.\nThey were being combined so two grades were put together. We learned anyway somehow. and I\nthink sometimes better than the other public me. I had an eighth grade education and since I could not\ntake an apprenticeship, there was nothing for me to do. She sent me to a boarding school, not a fancy\nboarding school, near Hanover in the north of Germany. This was a school that was originally built to\nteach horticulture. A Jewish institution that also taught housekeeping, or homemaking and all that sort\nof thing. So this was a solution for a few months and I was there, I think, from March or April, 1940\ntill August of 1940 when my mother made me come back because she didn't feel well. She had some\nsort of an inflammation in her arm, she couldn't move her arm. There were after all, my grandmother\nto be taken care of and she was then 91.\nAnthony: She was living with your mother?\nHanna: She was living with us. She moved into our house after my brother left for America. My",
        "5\naunts, my three aunts, the sisters of my mother moved in with us because not having a business any\nmore, you had to conserve funds. One rent was enough. Besides that, if you had a large apartment and\nroom to spare, the Jewish families had to move together. So this was our solution that the whole\nfamily lived in one place. My mother made me come back in August of 1940, in a way lucky for me\nbecause we were deported on October 22, 1940. Had I been still in that school, my way would have\nbeen to Theresienstadt and probably later on to Auschwitz or God knows where. I don't think I would\nbe sitting here in Bayside today. We got deported to Gurs, six women, we were arrested this morning.\nThe following thing happened. My mother went out very early around 8 o'clock to do some shopping.\nShe came back a very short time later and said she met a man in the street, a Jewish fellow she knew -\n- who was, by the way, a very distant relative -- who told her that we would be arrested and deported\nthis very day. My mother said you must be crazy. She would not believe it. On second thought, she\nwent to the Jewish community, to the offices, the administration of the Jewish community and she\nfound that it was locked. Then she realized that the man was right. She came home and she told all of\nus. The next thing she did was to tell me to take various items, very beautiful bohemian crystal stuff\nthat she had promised to a friend who was gentile, that if we ever left, she would give it to her as a\npresent. She said to me, take these things and bring it to her. The name of the lady was Erika Fite. Her\nhusband was a lawyer and they were good friends of ours. When I came there to drop off the stuff, she\nsaid to me, my husband said, you will be deported to the south of France. I came home, I told my\nmother. We had no idea how he knew but he knew. Again, of course, you don't believe it.\nAnthony: So it wasn't a believable--?\nHanna: It was not a believable thing to us! Right? Like my husband told you. It wasn't believable,\nright? So we packed the best we could. I packed for my grandmother; my mother packed for herself\nand myself; my aunts packed for themselves more or less. Here we are six women, age 16 to 91 1/2.\nThere were twelve men arresting them! Six defenseless women, 12 men, okay. Now my grandmother,\nof course, could not walk to wherever people were being sent. That was clear. She was totally\nconfused why she was--why was she thrown out of her place. What was happening, where were we\ngoing? She couldn't comprehend it. She was not senile, incidentally. She just could not understand\nwhat was happening. After all, her husband had been in the war, her children were in the war, why\nwas this happening to her? Why was this happening to all of us? So we had to sign before we left the\napartment, we had to sign papers turning all belongings over to the German Reich. We had to evaluate\nhow much the apartment was worth. My mother did and she signed. My aunt, Helena Goldstein, she\ndid not want to sign. She just did not want to sign. So the Gestapo man told her very simply, look,\nunless you sign, we will send you away from Platform Six on the railway station. Platform Six meant\nthe trains going to Munich and Dachau. So she signed very quickly. Also we realized that what we\nhad been told, south of France, could maybe be correct. We are not going to Dachau, that was sure.\nAnthony: And it might not be as bad as Dachau. Dachau, you heard about--?\nHanna: Exactly, exactly.\nAnthony: South of France, you didn't know of any camps there?",
        "6\nHanna: We didn't know of any camps. We knew nothing at all. Not anything. Since my grandmother\ncouldn't walk, they brought around a police car, but an open--like an open truck where they would\nmove maybe 30, 40 policemen at a time for riot control, or whatever. It was an open car with benches.\nNow you try to get a 91-year-old woman up on that truck. There are no steps going up. There are only\nlittle foot things on the side that flip down. I tried desperately to get my grandmother up, tried to push\nher up. She had nothing to hold on to. There were people standing, watching this scene of me trying to\nget this old woman up on this thing. Finally one of the men who had arrested us, put her up there. So\nthen it was running back and helping the others bring down the suitcases and all of that. And that's the\nway we were transported to the railway station. What they used at the railway station was an unused\nentrance. This was originally the entrance only being used for the royalty. They had a special entrance\nat the railroad station. This is where we were assembled. It didn't take my mother very long to see that\ncertain things were being filmed. Because of that, there was a man standing there. He was a dentist\nand the tears were rolling down his cheeks. He was totally out of it. My mother went over to him and\nsaid, you know, we're being filmed. If you don't stop crying, I'm going to crack you one. She meant it\nbecause she was embarrassed that he would do that and show the Germans, you know, that he was so\nupset. He stopped. We were loaded in the train, probably sometime in the afternoon. I don't think that\nin the railroad car where I was--was my family there was any light. We were in the dark during the\nnight. I don't know if the other cars had light but ours certainly didn't. The first stop that I remember\nmaking was in Mauthausen, and we were given something to eat. Also our money, the 100 marks that\nwe were allowed to take along other than the luggage we could carry, was changed to 2,000 French\nfrancs. We were on that train till the 25th of October and we arrived in Oloron Sainte-Marie. On our\ntrain was the only person that escaped from any of the nine trains that made their way down to the\nsouth of France. At one time, the train had to stop and I believe it was to take on water for the engine.\nIt was already in the French unoccupied zone and the Germans were gone. We managed, some\nmanaged--people went out of the train to get water to drink. I wanted to get out of the train to get\nwater. My mother wouldn't let me because she was afraid the train would move away and I wouldn't\nmake it back. I looked out the window and there I saw this woman running away, up the embankment\non the side of the railroad station, was a very little railroad station. Someone, in fact 1t was a man by\nthe name of Hugo Stein, a lawyer, threw the luggage out the window. This woman really and truly\nmade it. She had relatives in the area; she knew exactly where she was. She made it, she was never\narrested. She made her way to America where she had children. Unfortunately, her son must be\nmentally ill because he killed his mother about, I would say, twenty-five years ago. He murdered her.\nThe poor woman was, by the way, a widow so it was hard. When we arrived in Oloron Sainte-Marie,\nit rained like you cannot believe. It was just like if you are standing under a huge shower. We were\noff-loaded but I would like to interject here, that on the train, my grandmother became totally\nconfused. She did not know where she was, what it was. She was totally confused. There was another\nman with us in the same car. He also, very old, he also became confused. It was somehow possible\nand I don't remember how, to call the one doctor that was on the train, the one doctor who was still\npermitted to practice. He came and he took a look at the situation and he gave me a small handful of\nsleeping pills to give to my grandmother. I got them down into her. Unfortunately, she survived.\nAnthony: Survived?",
        "7\nHanna: She survived the handful of sleeping pills.\nAnthony: So what was your intent in giving her these pills?\nHanna: The intent of the doctor was to put her out. To really finish it right there and then. It didn't\nwork. Maybe it wasn't enough, maybe she was just too strong. I don't know. But it was a hard thing to\ndo, to put this many sleeping pills into someone, knowing what it will do.\nAnthony: Whose idea was it, the doctor's?\nHanna: The doctor's, entirely the doctor\u2019s. He was right. I don't--the man was right. When we arrived\nat Oloron Sainte-Marie, she and the other old--the other man--the old man, a Mr. Wital, were removed\nfrom the train, separately. My mother at the time said that she would want to go with her mother-in-\nlaw and she was not allowed to go. We never knew where she was taken. We were about ten days to\ntwo weeks in the camp before we found out that she had been brought back to the camp. She was\nperfectly normal. She recognized us, she knew her surroundings. She couldn't understand them but\nshe knew. I mean, who can understand at that age, right? She was in a different block. She was not in\nour block, she was in a different block. Except they had a barracks over there that was set up for old\npeople and they had some sort of beds for them. She was better off there than being with us on the\nfloor. We had to leave her over there and my mother went to see her as much as possible. She lived\ntill January 7, 1941. At that time, she just gave out.\nAnthony: Passed away?\nHanna: She passed away. I supposed that she must have gotten pneumonia or whatever from lying\nthere, you know. You have old people lying down a lot, this is the usual story. Not enough food and\nshe was--she had a very healthy appetite, my grandmother. She could outdo a teenager very easily.\nShe could.\nAnthony: The time she died, was she sharing her barracks with anybody in the family?\nHanna: No, no. But my mother went over there as much as possible. There were people taking care\nof these old people. That was the good part about it, that there were people helping the elderly there.\nAnthony: From the camp, or--?\nHanna: People that were, no--people from the camp. All of these things were left to the people in the\ncamp, the inmates. The inmates basically ran the camp. Every block had its own administration.\nSurely the administration of the block was responsible to headquarters, if you wish, but on a daily\nbasis, it was the people in the camp, the interned people that were running it. My grandmother passed\naway in January, my mother's oldest sister died in February. She was, in any case, a very sick person,\nI had no idea, at the time we were deported. Again it was hunger, cold, wet, what-have-you that she",
        "8",
        "just could not survive. She was also nearly blind from diabetes. Life in the camp--the biggest problem\nwas mud because it rained all the time. You were ankle deep of earth in the mud. It was a big problem\nespecially with the old people. They could not extricate themselves many times when they fell. It\nrained constantly during the winter, or almost all the time. Water was three times a day for two hours\neach. In the beginning we had to wash ourselves outdoors. The men always had to--the women\neventually had a barracks where there was just, you know, a possibility to get washed and what have\nyou. But the men forever had to wash themselves outdoors, no matter what the weather was or\nwhatever. By the way, in plain sight of the main road of the camp, so that when people walked by,\nthey could see everybody standing there. It was before nude beach. It was very, very tough. I\neventually worked in the office of the block and this is how I got to know my future husband who\ncame to see his mother who worked in the office. She worked there mainly because she spoke fluent\nFrench and people who could speak French were needed in order to deal with the administration. So I\nworked in this office and this is how I met my husband. Should we go and tell the rest of the story?\nSo, one day we got supplementary food from the Swiss Red Cross. They had established a barracks\nthere and the Red Cross was in charge of it and food was given to the young people, the children, the\nyoung people and to the adults that were ailing or so down, so malnourished that they really could\nbarely walk. We had to go every morning and have our food right there. We could not take anything\nout of there to prevent black market, giving it to the family, what have you. It was a great help, a great\nhelp that we got this extra food. Eventually a social worker came around and asked my mother\nwhether she would let me go to a village in France, Le Chambon-Sur-Lignon where there were people\nwho wanted to help young people to survive, to get out of the camps. My mother asked me and I said\nyes. Then we didn't hear for many weeks. I would like to mention that there was a tremendous cultural\nlife in Gurs. There was chamber music, there was an orchestra. There were cabaret performances,\nlectures. Eventually a school for the young children was established and the adults somehow formed\nsome classes for English still hoping that people will make it to an English-speaking country, namely\nAmerica. There were French lessons for the children and I did not participate in spite of the fact that\nmy then boyfriend told me that I have to learn French. Never listened.\nAnthony: Was your mother actively involved in these activities?\nHanna: My mother was involved in the English lessons, yes. She did not do anything musically, no.\nAnthony: Your aunts?\nHanna: My aunts, the two remaining aunts after--no, no. They were also busy making maybe out of\nsome old something, maybe a blouse or a skirt or something. Because this was really their background\nso if they got hold of anything that could be sewn together, they would do it.\nAnthony: How much time elapsed before your mother found out about your boyfriend?\nHanna: Oh, no time at all. She knew. There was no problem there.\nAnthony: She was happy?",
        "9",
        "Hanna: She didn't object, she didn't say anything.\nAnthony: She thought he was nice young man?\nHanna: She probably thought it was a perfectly normal thing. After all I was sixteen years old and he\nwas nineteen. No, there was never any problem there. There was once a problem when a lady was\nmentioning to someone else in the latrine that, and my mother was in one of the stalls of this latrine at\nthis particular moment when the woman said, it's a terrible thing. This Hannah is pregnant from this\nfellow she's going with. Of course, it wasn't true. My mother heard 1t and my mother told me about it.\nThis lady was busy with social work and God-knows-what and she liked to ask me to do things for\nher, to run an errand or to take care of this or that in the office. After I heard, my mother told me that\nwhen she approached me I said, well I guess from today on you're going to do it yourself. I'm not\ngoing to run for you anymore. This story had a 'very funny ending in that this woman also went to\nCuba, just like my two surviving aunts. After our daughter was born in 1946, I wrote to my aunts that\nthe baby this particular lady had talked into my belly back in 1941 has now been born. A long\npregnancy from '41 to '46, better than an elephant. If I have a daughter and she had a daughter who\nwas far away and I don't know what my daughter was doing, then I would be very careful to talk\nabout other people's children. It happened that the letter arrived at my aunt's. My aunt was not feeling\nwell and she was in bed and the lady came to visit. My aunt, innocently said, oh Mrs. would you\nplease read that letter to me. Of course, she had to read what I had written to my aunts, which was\ncertainly a great embarrassment to her. But in a way, I got my revenge for being nasty. But it brings\nus back to Gurs. One day, indeed, the social worker came around and said we were ready to leave. I\nleft, beginning of September, 1941 to go to Le Chambon. Le Chambon was a marvelous experience.\nThe people there were terrific. We could feel at home. Even so, I first had to learn French. The\npopulation to me is the best on Earth and you know there's a documentary about this village. I was\nthere a year and a half. Now in the summer of 1942, my mother had been very ill around June, July, I\nthink. May or June. I had for weeks, no letters from my mother. Finally, my cousin wrote me and said\nshe had been very ill. She was operated in the hospital. This hospital, by the way, in the camp was\nonly for desperately ill people and not the people who were suffering from dysentery and dying from\ndysentery in the blocks in the beginning when we were in Gurs. In Gurs, we would have in the\nbeginning as many as 20 to 25 deaths a day, a day! Because dysentery was just rampant, other\ndiseases were rampant. So she was operated in the camp hospital. Well, we found out--they found out\nin camp that she actually had diabetes. People who have diabetes are very prone to come up with all\nsorts of pus-filled what you would call boils, carbuncles, what have you. This is exactly what\nhappened to her and she had a very huge one on her back. Later on someone who assisted at that\nsurgery told me that the cut was about 15 centimeters long which would make it about six inches,\nright. It was decided that because she had been so ill that I could come to the camp and visit with her.\nAll the arrangements were made. I had pass, a south country pass so I could travel without being\narrested or what have you. I went down to Gurs. On the way I passed my boyfriend who was then just\nfreshly liberated from the camp to a Jewish Boy Scout farm and I went down to the camp. When I\ncame to the camp, the first thing I found out that the camp was closed to all visitors. The thing was\nthat my husband, then boyfriend told me, if you come to Oloron, find out about the ambulance that",
        "10\nGurs to Po because there was the ambulance from the camp would occasionally go up once or twice a\nweek, go to Po, to the big hospital there. Maybe on their way back, you can hitch a ride up to camp.\nWell, when I inquired about camp ambulance in Oloron they told me it had not come for days and that\nthe camp was closed. So I had very bad vibes right there and then but I went. Sure enough, when I\ncame to the camp, they would not let me in. It was closed. .So I had to find lodgings in a neighboring\nlittle village, village of Chaooz (phonetic) (c.451). I then got in touch with people in the camp. I think\nthe next morning, also, it was arranged that I could see my mother, oh about 300 feet away, through\nvarious rows of barbed wire. I was standing on the road and it didn't take long before the police came\nalong and tried to chase me away. I saw my mother about two times that way. Then I was told that she\nwould be deported; that the trains would be leaving. Again the organizations, the Swiss Red Cross, the\nQuakers, whoever was then working in the camp, saw to it that I was given permission to come to the\nrailroad station, which was again the freight yard. It's always the freight yard. I went to Oloron. I\nstayed during the night in the street because I didn't dare go anywhere close to the railroad station.\nFound a house or two houses, there was a little wall, maybe two feet high between these two houses. I\nsort made camp on this little wall--had a blanket with me and a little pillow. Sure enough the\ngendarmes came around, the police came around during the night. Here's a young girl and they are\ntwo policemen. After they looked at my papers, their intentions were not too honorable. They said\nsomething, oh if she's pretty enough. I became very ugly, very suddenly and they walked away.\nAround five o'clock in the morning, I went over to the freight yard. At that point, everybody already\nhad been loaded into the trains. I, not knowing in which car my mother was, I sort of leaned back\nagainst the loading dock of the freight yards and there was a French policeman standing there. He\nasked me what I was doing there and I told him. Then he told me what's going on here, tears my heart\nout, and then turned around and said to me, would you like to have a drink? Because he had a hip\nflask, you ever seen a French ---? So I declined that and he was helpful in finding the car in which my\nmother was. This is where I saw my mother for the last time. People were in a terrible condition--they\nwere. You cannot even describe how these people--most of them were. Some still did not realize what\nthis was all about. One woman in the car where my mother was, got ill so they wanted to call for the\nnurse that was along. I told them I think you will have to forget about the nurses now. My mother\nrealized that she would never come back. In the car---\nAnthony: Where were they told that they were going?\nHanna: They were not told anything. They were not told anything to my knowledge. I think they\nguessed very much what the destination, you know, that would be the end, end of the road. My\nmother left me no doubt. She says, I will not come back.\nAnthony: What kind of a train was it?\nHanna: A cattle train.\nAnthony: A cattle train.\nHanna: Yeah, a cattle train. In the cattle train, they had straw on the floor and there was some food in",
        "11\nthe car, which the Quakers had supplied. This is looking back at the scene the best I can remember. I\ndo not know if there was luggage in that car or not. It could be that they threw some luggage in there\nbut I'm not sure but there was some food in there.\nAnthony: Do you remember the date?\nHanna: The date was August 6, 1942. The last thing I saw of my--I went to the next car for two\nminutes to say goodbye to my cousin. My cousin, Lily Franken nee Traub. She was in the next car\nand I wanted to say goodbye to her.\nAnthony: Lily was in the same convoy\u201d?\nHanna: The same convoy, so was her husband. A French policeman came over to me and grabbed me\nand said I had no business going to this car. What was I doing here? I was a civilian person and I\nexplained it to him. I said I didn't do anything but say goodbye to my cousin. He dragged me of\ncourse to his superior. He was ready to grab me and dump me in. I explained it to the superior what I\nhad done and I said I didn't do anything wrong. I just said goodbye to my cousin, that's all. He told\nthis guy, forget it, leave her alone. So I was fortunate that they were not--that the superior, captain or\nwhatever he was, was not that mean that he was going to throw me into the train.\nAnthony: Were you ever able to talk to your cousin?\nHanna: Maybe for a minute, maybe for a minute.\nAnthony: Was she as pessimistic as your mother was?\nHanna: | don't think we ever came to that point. You know, it was just a kiss, a hug, whatever. The\nlast thing I saw of my mother after the trains was locked, was a white handkerchief fluttering out of\nthose slits they have in the cattle cars, you know. Cattle cars in Europe are different. You have seen\nthe one they have in the museum in Washington. So you see they are different from the cattle cars\nhere in America, they are more open. Over there, they are more closed and just have little air slits on\nthe top and that was the last I saw of my mother. It was abominable. The scene was abominable. I\nwent back to the place where I had taken lodgings. It was a simple farm house, was renting out a\ncouple of rooms. The next day I went back to Le Chambon. That is to say on my way to Le Chambon,\nI again stopped where my boyfriend was. I told him at the time what had happened. He told me that\nthey found out that they will be roundups in France. I told him at the time, if it's not safe where you\nare here, then come where I am. Sure enough, within two weeks. . .\nAnthony: He took you up on your offer?\nHanna: Took me up on what I said. He came with a friend, now a friend, not then. You didn't really\nknow him at that time, Walter Jacobavich who now lives out in Palo Alto, Jacobovsky? Now lives out\nin Palo Alto, calls himself Water Chang, makes it much simpler. The two of them came. What",
        "12\nhappened there is really is in Le Chambon--the seven of us who originally came from Gurs we were\nseven young people who left Gurs together, had decided, said we cannot, with the danger that it was,\nstay in the house where we lived. Said we wanted to go into the other house that the Swiss\norganization, the Swiss Red Cross was running there. So at night, we went to the other house thinking\nthat they will not come where the little ones are. Because we were the big ones, we were teenagers\nand in the other house they had the little children. They will look for us where we are supposed to be\nand not over there. Well, we slept there a couple of nights. One morning, on our way back, and it\nwasn't far, 1t was just up and down the hill, it was a five-minute walk at best, I hear some whistling\nbehind me. I was with my girlfriend...",
        "Tape 1, Side B\nShe turned around and she said turn around. I said no, I'm going to turn around. It's the boys from the\nschool here, I'm not going to turn around, leave me alone.\nAnthony: She knew who he was?\nHanna: She had turned around for a whistle, you bet! Eventually, she took me by my shoulder and\nturned me around and here was my boyfriend who had arrived during the night and had made camp at\na tennis court of a family by the name Erinches, right? Many years later we met the Erinches, that is\nto say we met their son and daughter-in-law and family. We told him the story and he was so amused\nthat he took us over to the now totally different tennis court, totally overgrown and took a picture of\nus because he thought it was so amusing. Well, Max was hidden in the very same night, Madame\nOntre Philip, Mary Philip who died last November, a great lady, terrific person who worked in the\nunderground, French resistance. Her husband was right-hand to Gen. DeGaulle, a woman who was\nshot at Lyon and pretended to be dead and remained lying in the street till everything was okay for her\nto get up. The Germans thought she was dead. She was a wonderful human being. I took him to her\nand she immediately saw to it that he was hidden the very same night. He was with a family in some\nprivate home. The next day he was placed with farmers who took very good care of him. He lived in\nthe hayloft. He lived in the hayloft for, I guess, close to four weeks. What the farmer had done--he cut\nout a square in the hayloft, which was absolutely above the stables where the animals were. So that\nwas his toilet. He came down only once a day for the evening meal. That was it. He had nothing to\nread or do but the gospel, the New Testament. So it was an introduction to something he didn't want\nto know, I suppose. He stayed there for four weeks. They brought him back and the very next day he\nwas sent off to Switzerland. This was before we, that is my friends and I, the seven of us, or maybe\nwe were even more at that point; who slept in the other house made the acquaintance of the Gestapo\nduring the night. Because indeed they came. Of course they knew exactly who we were. They had our\nnames, they had everything. The man who was in charge of the Swiss operation in this village, Mr.\nBonee explained to the Gestapo, said, they could not touch us. That we were under Swiss protection.\nNo way. But he talked long enough and hard enough to make this person, this Gestapo official sort of\nstart to doubt. He said, okay, I leave them here in your charge. I will ask my superiors in the morning\nwhether this true. If it 1s not true, I will be back and we will arrest them. You personally are\nresponsible for them. They have to stay here in the house. So they left. By the way, one of my",
        "13\ngirlfriends tried to jump out -- did jump out of the house smack into the arms of the police who had\nsurrounded the house. She wanted to run away, no dice.\nAnthony: She was nailed?\nHanna: She was nailed, well; she came back into the house. They didn't take her. As morning broke,\nwe went into the woods and disappeared. We just disappeared. We were all day long in the woods and\nevening time people came around and picked us up and brought us to various farms. We were totally\nseparated from one another. There was one girl with me, which I had never seen before, did not know\nher. We were first on one farm. Then we were moved after two weeks to another farm. Both farms, by\nthe way, were searched by the police. They came around and in the first one, we couldn't quite hear\nwhat was going on but the farmers there had built a hideaway for us. It was all woodpiles. Wood piled\nup from floor to ceiling built in a U shape. You could pullout one bundle of wood and slip in and\nreplace this bundle of wood so you're totally hidden away. They were in the downstairs and they\ntalked to the farmers and after some time, they left. The farmer, of course, came and said we can come\nout. Then we were moved to another farm and there again they came. We were hidden in a free-\nstanding closet, an armoire behind the clothes. In front was a row of shoes so our shoes looked like\nthe shoes that were standing there. The clothes was hanging very far down so you couldn't see the\nlegs. We heard police downstairs asking the farmer, are you hiding any Jews? The farmer calmly\nreplying, I don't know what Jews look like, and offered them a glass of wine. They declined, thanks\nGod, because we were dying in that closet of fear. They left so twice they missed us.\nAnthony: Did they return the next morning to the person who was held responsible for your group?\nHanna: I don't know. I never even asked him. I know him very well but I never really asked him.\nNext time I see him, maybe when I write him, I will ask him.\nAnthony: But he wasn't taken away\u201d?\nHanna: No, no, absolutely not. In February of 1943, I made my way into Switzerland. I had my\nmother's sister in Switzerland. She was married there. They were very well to do people, more than\nwell-to-do people. I made it known to my family in Switzerland that I would like to leave. They did\nindeed arrange for me to get an entry visa into Switzerland. Now in order to get the entry visa into\nSwitzerland, you have to have an exit visa. Of course you could not get an exit visa, that was futile.\nSo they arranged for a guide but that man said I had to make my way from Le Chambon to\nAnnemasse outside of Annemasse on my own, which I did. All alone, I had no one to go with me. I\ndid the whole thing. I had false papers.\nAnthony: Traveled by day?\nHanna: Traveled by day, traveled by night.\nAnthony: This is when this part of France had been occupied?",
        "14\nHanna: In February of 1943 when all of France was occupied. When I came to Lyon railroad station\nas well as in (? \u00a2.701), there was a lot of German army people there, standing around. In Lyon, I had\nto wait a long, long time for a train going in this direction. I was sitting in the waiting room with a\nFrench magazine, right? Pretending to be reading it. I had taken with me a briefcase, a very narrow\none, a very narrow one with a zipper. I had a little bit of food in there, some bread and a little bit of\ncheese, a towel, maybe a toothbrush. I'm not quite sure I still had a toothbrush at that point. I think a\nnightgown; I don't know why I took a nightgown. I wore everything double. I wore two skirts, two\nsweaters, two blouses, you know.\nAnthony: It was cold then?\nHanna: Everything double because it's all I could take. It wasn't that it was so cold -- and a coat --\nbecause unless I wore it, I could not take it. So I took nothing, nothing with me. I just had enough\nmoney to get from Chambon to Annemasse and left a few francs at the convent in Annemasse. This\nwas supposed to be my contact point, the convent in Annemasse. Since I arrived at night, the gate was\nlocked, the bell was disconnected. On the train, in the compartment, I was finally able to sit down. We\nwere three people, two women and a man. I pretended to fall asleep. I figured if there they come for\npapers, I have a long time in waking up and -- you know. I heard them talk about the underground,\nwhich was very foolish of them. When we got off the train in Annemasse because it was the last stop\nthen for this particular train, he said to me, where are you going? I said, I'm going to the convent.\nThey're waiting for me. He said, you know how to get there? I said, no, but I will find it. It can't be so\ndifficult. He said, I will take you there. I said, that's not necessary. I will take you there. So he took\nme, and of course the gate was locked, the bell was disconnected. Now what? I said, well then I'll\nhave to go a hotel. So he was nice enough to go to one of the other hotels, and they were all fully\noccupied. He finally was able to find a hotel for me if you can call it a hotel. It was a bit unbelievable.\nTo me at least, it was. I had never seen anything like that. I registered with my phony name, a totally\nphony address, a place I had never been in my life. I made it all up. The whole thing was made up. If\nthey had asked me where is Rue Garibaldi in Lyon, I wouldn't have known where it was. But every\ncity in France has a Rue Garibaldi for sure. Okay. I registered, I went to my room. I locked the door\nvery carefully and I went to sleep. The next morning I left. I had no breakfast or anything. I went to\nthe convent. In the convent, they told me what I have to do, where I have to go and how to go there.\nThey gave me a breakfast, bread and coffee, whatever they had. I left them just about the last of my\nmoney because I felt it was very nice of them, you know. To give me anything, right? I made my way\nto Annemasse, partly by bus, partly on foot. On the way, I passed a customs place. Little customs\nhouse. I figured, hmm, it's wartime. There's no commerce going on between here and Switzerland,\nimpossible, what for? Ah, walked by. Next thing I know, he called me back.\nAnthony: Did you have anything to declare?\nHanna: Where you going? To Annemasse. Your papers. So I give him my papers. Then he looks at\nme and says are you Jewish. I still don't know where the answer came from and I said I've nothing to\ndo with that dirty race. He closed my papers and smiled and said you can go. That was that. That was",
        "15\nthe only time in my life I denied being Jewish. I don't know where the answer came from, but I guess\nit was the right answer. I walked to Annemasse and I think in fact the little place was called Duvin. I\nwas supposed to go to the priest which I did. The priest sent a little boy with me to the guide. The\nguide had been paid by my family in Switzerland. There was a woman who already in the First World\nWar did things like that. She was hard at work again. I came to the guide and there was a family there\nwith twin boys and the guide was supposed to take us all across the border at night. It was the only\ntime I played bridge, I know nothing about the game, I was the dummy. Then they came and brought\na young man which they picked up in the church. The six of us were taken across the border at night.\nThe guide was a big, heavy-set farmer. He was a widower and he had I don't know how many\nchildren. I guess he did much of it for the money. He literally carried us across this little river so we\nwouldn't be wet. He explained to us how we have to walk. He gave the father of this family Swiss\nmoney so we could go onto the streetcar that was going back and forth between Geneva and\nAnnemasse. He told us how to walk in order to come out at the right place to catch the streetcar.\nThere was only one thing. The first time around, we walked in a circle because it was dark and we\ncame out exactly where he had started, under the same tree. The second time around, we knew better\nand we found our way. We boarded the streetcar, he paid for all six of us. That was fine and we were\ntold where to get off and at that place was another contact person, someone of his family. She, in turn,\ndistributed us into hotels that were willing to take people like that in the middle of the night, which\nwas probably illegal. The next morning, she came and collected us. I told her, it was around 11\no'clock at night, to please call my aunt immediately. She said it\u2019s 11 o'clock, I said do me a favor and\ncall her right away. She did, and my aunt came the next morning and picked my up in Geneva. I lived\nwith my relatives in Berne for--from March, actually it was the first of March when I got into\nSwitzerland, till the 23rd of December, the 23rd or the 24th of December, 1944 at which time, I ran\naway, to put it plain. I left because I could no longer tolerate the situation. They had absolutely no\nunderstanding for what I had experienced. They opposed my future husband because how could I\nmake such a decision without asking anybody? We have nothing, we have no profession, we have no\nsavings, we are nothings. There was also the thing, that whenever something went on, what would\nyour mother say? Well, I knew very well what had happened, okay. At that time in Switzerland the\nnewspapers started to be full of that stuff, okay. We knew at this point exactly what was going on.\nStill, what would your mother say? One day, I had it enough with that, 'what would your mother say\u2019.\nI said, leave her alone. She's dead. At which point my aunt who couldn't face the truth almost fainted.\nIt was a major fight. I think I came as close to a nervous breakdown as I have ever been in my aunt's\nand my uncle's house. My cousin, my middle cousin, was no help. He resented me. I did not realize at\nthe time nor did anyone else that he was basically a sick person. I left and I went to Geneva where my\nfuture husband was taking a course in social services to prepare for whatever, to have something after\nthe war, to do. I went to Geneva and took a job as a maid, which was one of the few jobs that refugees\nwere allowed to do. I was paid sixty francs a month, a Swiss maid got 160 francs a month. We didn't\nearn the same money for the same work. I was lucky to be working for a Bulgarian family where the\nson had been a diplomat. He had, however, resigned his diplomatic position because he was opposed\nto the politics. So they were refugees in Switzerland as well, but refugees with money, and with a\npermit to reside in Geneva. They had a very big apartment, furnished beautiful. I was the maid there,\nand they were very nice to me. I worked for them till we got married in April of 1945. At that time,\nwhen we got married, I entered the internment home to be with my husband which the Swiss",
        "16\ngovernment gave me permission to do. Now sometime later, as my husband explained to you before,\nthe Swiss had a policy that all immigrants who were living in refugee homes had to get out. They no\nlonger wanted to support them. It also meant that I had to get out and I had to take a room in the town\nof Mortrick (phonetic) (c.818). I have not slept one night in this room. We had a newborn child, not\nquite as newborn any more. She was maybe five, six months old at the time when that happened who\nremained in the refugee home. But mother should live outside. Now this was an intolerable situation. I\nwas in the home all day to take care of the baby, right? And at night, I should have slept somewhere\nelse! I also could not have my meals in the home anymore. So then finally came a decision that yes,\nbecause of the infant, I can stay in the home and I will have to pay room and board at the same rate as\nthe Swiss who were in the home. I could return officially to the home. The Swiss had done another\nnice thing. Since I was an immigrant in Switzerland and my husband was a refugee, they had a big\nproblem. Well I came in with a visa, that made me an immigrant. I came in legally as a far as -- I\ncrossed the border illegally, if you wish. But once I was in Switzerland, I was legal. When he and the\nothers crossed illegally, they remained illegal, they were refugees. So they had a big problem, the\nSwiss. Was this baby now going to be a refugee like the father or an immigrant like the mother\u2019? It\ntook several months to resolve this problem. They came down in favor of refugee, which was\nwonderful because otherwise we would have had to pay for her room and board as well. What are you\ngoing to pay with? The reason -- the way we could pay for my room and board was a very sad one.\nBecause my brother who had come here in 1936 as a sixteen-year-old and by himself, had joined the\nAmerican army voluntarily.\nAnthony: How had he come here 1n '36.?\nHanna: He came here -- my father had a half-brother here who was willing to take him, who gave me\nan affidavit to come. He stayed with this uncle and aunt for maybe six or eight weeks, not very long.\nThen he struck out on his own. Because again it was a situation of a young fellow, a 16-year-old who\nall of a sudden found himself in strange surroundings with people he didn't know, with different\nhabits and what have you. Because this aunt was not a very nice person, she went into my brother's\ncorrespondence, which he had locked away in one of those lock-away briefcases. She found there a\nletter from my mother asking him, because, my God, he was six-foot something and 16 years old and\ncould eat a loaf of bread in one sitting; if he had enough to eat, a very normal concern for a mother,\nright? She found this letter and it provoked a storm and so he left and struck out on his own.\nSometime later he was down at a university in Georgia, became a radio technician, then came back\nand took a job with the pilot radio company in New York and eventually, joined the army voluntarily.\nHe was killed in the Battle of the Bulge, in January 1945. Incidentally, only a few days after his death\nand I did not know that he was dead till May of '45 because my aunt in Switzerland did not tell me.\nShe kept this information from me until after we were married. That he had been killed in action. I got\na letter sometime in the end of January. He asking if somehow I could come over to France and visit.\nWe could meet if he has a few days furlough or something.\nAnthony: So you were in contact with him?\nHanna: | was in contact with him. Of course, this was not feasible. The gentleman for whom I",
        "17\nworked then in Geneva tried everything if this was possible for me. Because he had a lot of contacts.\nThe thing was, no, I could not, so I never saw him again. My aunt in Switzerland, who had the\ninformation that he had been killed, withheld the information from me till...\nAnthony: Until the war ended?\nHanna: No, no, no. Till the end of April for sure, shortly after we were married. Then she did not tell\nme directly. She called and told my husband to tell me. She did not have the courage to tell me. She\ncame when we were married. I invited her to keep the peace in the family, right? So I could not hear\nfrom each side, what did you do? She was at that marriage ceremony and didn't say a word. I didn't\nknow till May that he was dead or end of April that he was dead. When we heard the war was over, it\nmeant nothing to me. It really didn't mean much any more. I wouldn't say nothing but it didn't mean\nmuch. Right? We had lost everybody, we knew they weren't coming back. My brother was dead, the\nmountains looked the same. Switzerland was a peaceful country, and here we were. It was a very\nstrange feeling to hear the King of England on the radio saying the war is over in the little English that\nI understood. He stuttered a lot so there was lot's of time to think about what he said. I sat down,\nlistened to it and it took me maybe ten minutes before I went down to the office to tell him that the\nwar was over. Then, we stayed in Switzerland till '48, before we came here. We had a hell of a time\ngetting affidavit to come here. We tried to stay in Switzerland with his cousin who was in business\nand wanted him to stay. The Swiss wouldn't permit us to stay. So we came here in '48 and slowly had\nto start building a new life. Unfortunately we became ill in 1950 with TB and first had to spend close\nto two years getting well again. Our daughter was 1n a foster home. She was in a very good and loving\nfoster home. Nevertheless, it left 1ts traces for some time. We had to start building a life like\neverybody else. It's as simple as that.\nAnthony: Now you left two aunts behind in Gurs?\nHanna: My two aunts in Gurs were able to leave in October of 1941 to go to Marseille because they\ncould go to Cuba. They were first interned in Marseille in the Hotel Bumbaire. That was an old worn-\nout place where refugees were interned. They could go about, though, during the day taking care of\nthe immigration business. They made their way into Cuba. They were in Cuba actually till 1948. In\nother words, from 1942 -- they left Gurs in October, '41; they left, I think, in January of '42 or before,\nfirst to go to Morocco and from Morocco to Cuba. They came after us. It must have been April when\nthey came up from Cuba. The idea was that we would have a joint household. That I would take care\nof my aunts in return for not having to pay rent and this and that and the other. My aunt's son was\ngoing to take care of them. This was the arrangement. I could never do that because already at that\ntime, I was not well enough to take care of two old ladies plus a child and a husband. It was just not\npossible. So other arrangements were made for them. It was a good thing because in 1950 we had to\ngo in a Sanitarium so the two old ladies would have been at loose ends anyhow. So they lived till 19 --\nMrs. Goldstein lived, I think, until 1962 and my other aunt, also a Traub, lived until 1969. She died at\n99 years and two months and was fully aware of her surroundings. She was not senile for a minute.\nShe was very aware that we were ready to go to the moon, which for her represented an unbelievable\nthing having been born in 1869 with the gas lamp. Imagine the whole revolution -- the industrial",
        "18\nrevolutions that she had lived through plus the trip to the moon.\nAnthony: It struck me that your aunt and your grandmother that you had family members who lived\nlong lives when they had the chance?\nHanna: Yes, very long lives.\nAnthony: You talked about your reaction to the end of the war, the loss of your brother and family\nmembers. I imagine as the war ends, you're finding out more information about other--?\nHanna: Well, all my family members who were deported from Gurs did not come back. The only\nones who came back were my cousins in Prague, Czechoslovakia who had first been deported to\nTheresienstadt, into Auschwitz. I think I mentioned it at the beginning of the tape. She and her\nhusband both survived Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and I don't know how many other slave labor\ncamps. They had an arrangement that if they survive, they would go back to Prague and meet at the\nhouse of certain friends. Indeed, they both survived, and when she came back to Prague and she went\nto these friends, her husband was sitting there. It's a miracle that they survived. That was -- they're the\nonly two other than my self and my two old aunts. So five people all told survived. We lost fourteen, I\nthink the total was fourteen. A disaster, yes.\nAnthony: You have any further reflections?\nHanna: I would say that in spite of it all, life has been good to us.\nAnthony: (static) continue to be good and perhaps be better. Those were the years of the 20th century\nand the closing moments of this tape. The gleam in your eyes suggest to me that you have more to\nadd. Why don't we take a brief break while I add a new tape to the machine and then we will continue\non the new tape.\nTape Two",
        "Hanna: Remember I told you at the time we were in the refugee home on Motrick (c.11), to be\nprecise in (unclear) Switzerland, I had to leave the home because I was under a different status, that of\nimmigrant and not refugee, which left the baby in the home. Eventually, of course, they allowed me to\ncome back to the home. In return, I had to pay for room and board at the same amount of money or\nthe same amount of money that the Swiss had to pay. I think it was five or eight francs a day. Now,\nyou're probably wondering how come we had the money to pay that. I also told you that I had a\nbrother who was in the American army and was killed in the Battle of the Bulge. He had made a life\ninsurance before he went overseas. His life insurance was $10,000. It was paid out in monthly\ninstallments of $50 over -- I think a twenty-year period, as a matter of fact. This $50 allowed us, made\nit possible for us to pay for my room and board in the refugee home. So I forgot to explain that to you\nwhere the money came from so we could pay this room and board.",
        "19\nAnthony: Well, I remember when we were talking earlier that there were other family members that\nwe hadn't talked about yet. Hard to believe that there are other family members we didn't talk abut yet,\nbut the Monee family, these were your mother's cousins, your mother's first cousins?\nHanna: Yes, he was my mother's first cousin. His name was Heindrich Monee. His wife Paula and\nhis sister Jeannette. They were deported with us to Gurs at the same time. Paula was already really\nstarting to go into a depression in Germany, and had all sorts of peculiar ideas. She accused my\nmother and her sisters of being responsible for them not having been able to go to Israel, not being\nable to emigrate to Israel. Which was, of course, total fabrication. Neither my mother nor my aunts\nhad any influence or whatever for them to leave or not to leave. It was something that got into her\nhead and she, I can understand, wanted to go to Israel to be with her two sons, one from a previous\nmarriage. She was left widowed, then married this cousin of my mother. Of course, her second son\nwho was also in Israel and then of course, came to deportation and we found ourselves in Gurs. The\npoor woman really went into a very deep depression to the point where she wouldn't really take care\nof herself. There were weeks on end where she would not speak to anyone in the family. It was really\nvery hard. She did come to the funeral of my aunt when my oldest aunt died. I think she might also\nhave come to my grandmother's funeral. Incidentally, while we speak of funerals, let me give you a\ndescription of a funeral in Gurs.\nAnthony: Yes, \u201d?\nHanna: The funerals in Gurs -- the bodies were every morning collected in each block. When I first\ncame across this, there were two or three men who would come with a truck, an open truck. They\nwould come into the office and sort of kick open the door with their shoe and come in and say, you\ngot something? Meaning, do you have any bodies? When I heard that for the first time, French\nspeaking, I was absolutely shocked. You know, that you could speak of people like that. But I guess\nwhen you do this kind of work every day, it becomes sort of routine.\nAnthony: These were French?\nHanna: No, they were refugees as well.\nAnthony: Refugees?\nHanna: Yes, it was all done by refugees. The bodies were then taken down to the hospital and they\nwere put in caskets, very simple caskets, like you would in a Jewish funeral. Just six boards. Then the\nfuneral -- we had a cemetery which rapidly filled up. The graves were dug and since it was winter and\nmud and rain, the caskets literally were swimming. They plunged down into the water, went down for\na second and then came back up and were swimming on top of the water. It was the most awful sight\nyou could ever have imagined. First, falling into the water, the water splashing up and then the casket\ncoming up again on top of the water. Then of course, it was covered by earth. But the funerals were\nreally something, you wouldn't want to really experience. Now Paula Monee might have come to my\ngrandmother's funeral, I do not remember. But she definitely came to my aunt's funeral. Maybe she",
        "20",
        "even said a word or two to the family, but basically she was in such a deep depression that she could\nnot speak to them. Still and always was the idea, you are responsible for me being here. It's your fault\nwe couldn't emigrate.\nAnthony: How far back would these accusations go?\nHanna: They started in Germany in 19--early '39.\nAnthony: After Kristallnacht?\nHanna: After Kristallnacht. The woman was totally desperate. Unfortunately, she eventually had a\ngranddaughter who was mentally also not very stable. Only about eight years ago, committed suicide.\nSo there must have been something. Heinrich Monee, he was a very nice person, a very good-natured\nperson. I liked him quite a bit as an uncle. I really did because he was very good-natured and very\nnice, you know, just a nice guy too... There was a sister, Jeannette Monee, she worked for my aunts in\nthe business. She was the bookkeeper and general office manager, if you wish. She was with us in\nGurs. She was then taken to another camp. After all, she was an elderly person, and she survived. She\nsurvived in France and after the war, went back to Germany to live in a Jewish old-age home in\nFrankfurt. This old-age home existed already before the Hitler time and during the Hitler time. She\nwent back there, probably, very simply because she could have there a life, a comfortable life. She\nwas entitled to her social security in Germany. While in France, she didn't have a penny, and whatever\nlittle money she had, she probably got from some relatives in Switzerland. So that she was this way,\nindependent. I cannot blame her for having gone back to Germany under these circumstances.\nAnthony: Now Heinrich and Paula were eventually deported?\nHanna: Heinrich and Paula were deported from Gurs to Auschwitz. I believe they were also deported\nonly four days after my mother, around the 10th of August, 1942.\nAnthony: Yes, that's ...? (c.88)\nHanna: Yes.\nAnthony: I thought of some more questions regarding Gurs, and am very glad that you remembered\nto describe the funerals. When you were describing your uncle and your obvious affection for him, it\noccurred to me how sad it must have been that you were kept separate -- you were kept separate from\nthe men, so you....\nHanna: Yeah. The woman and children were separate from the men. Once the boys were fourteen\nyears old, they had to go into the blocks where the men were -- in the men's blocks. Whether they had\na father or a relative there or not. In other words, at fourteen, they were taken away from their\nmothers. They had to go with the men.",
        "21\nAnthony: So I had the vision of you separated from one of your dearest uncles and forced to be with\nthis complaining, depressed aunt.\nHanna: Well, she was in another barracks but it was difficult. I mean, you tried to talk to her, to be\nnice to her. After all, she was family, and here was this totally depressed person.\nAnthony: What was it like to live in Gurs? You were there for quite a while.\nHanna: Eleven months. Very difficult, extremely difficult. The sanitary conditions were impossible. I\ndon't know if I mentioned it before. There was a lot of illness. There was a tremendous amount of\ndysentery. We had no medications whatsoever.\nAnthony: What kind of food did they give you?\nHanna: The food -- well, in the morning we would get what passed as coffee. We got a ration of\nbread, about two and a half pounds a day.\nAnthony: Per person?\nHanna: No, excuse me. Half a pound of bread, something like that.\nAnthony: Quarter of a kilo?\nHanna: Something like that. Lunchtime we would have a soup, maybe with some vegetables in it.\nMaybe with some chick peas in it. Occasionally, a little piece of meat. In the evening, it was basically\nthe same thing. Very occasionally, we would be given a small portion of brown sugar. It was the first\ntime I had seen brown sugar, was in France. The very beginning, we didn't get any soap. I think we\ngot later on a little bit of soap. Living conditions were very hard. The worst thing really was the mud,\nthe incessant rain in winter, the mud, the barracks that were leaking so when you were lying down, the\nwater would drip down. If you were lucky, someone had taken along maybe an umbrella. The\numbrella would be hung upside down into the rafters to catch the rain. So that was very nice as long it\nlasted. But then came the morning. You had to empty out the damn thing and when you took it down,\nmore likely than not, it would spill. You know, it sounds funny today, it wasn't at the time though.\nEspecially when it was always damp and nothing would dry. You know, it was... No heat in the\nbarracks, was always cold in winter. There was a stove in a barracks but nothing to heat with or very\nlittle. [Male voice: \"We forgot to mention...it is documented that a portion of the money which was\nallotted by the French government for food never reached us because it was stolen before we ever got\nfood for it.\"\nAnthony: Sounds like you were a very resourceful---?\nHanna: The people in Gurs became very resourceful, yes. You had to be. For one thing, tin cans,\nlarge tin cans, oh about fifteen inches high and maybe six inches in diameter were turned into ovens.",
        "22\nCooking stoves if you wish, whatever you want to call it.\nAnthony: Portable stoves?\nHanna: Like a portable stove, right.\nAnthony: How were they put together? Can you describe it?\nHanna: They were not put together. The top was cut open obviously because whatever was in there\nhad been emptied out. You simply put opened on the bottom like a little opening so you could put in\nsome wood. The pot you put on, the little pots that we -- they're not really pots, they were like mess\nkits from the army. They had little hands on each side. So they were hanging over the edge of the tin\ncan and that would hold them in place. Sometimes if there was a little wire, they would put some wire\non the bottom in order to put the wood on there so it would have some draft from the bottom up not\nunlike a grate in the fireplace so there would be some draft. And so whatever people could get hold of\nif they had a little money and could do maybe a little black marketing with the Spaniards, they would\ncook on these makeshift stoves. It worked.\nAnthony: People in your barracks used them?\nHanna: Certainly. Whoever could afford to get a hold of one. Usually you had to pay a little money\nto get it.\nAnthony: These weren't homemade? They were made by ---?\nHanna: They were all made in Gurs. They were made by the men. The Spaniards made them. They\nearned a little money that way.\nAnthony: The Spanish prisoners?\nHanna: The Spanish prisoners, yes. They made a little money that way, you know. I guess they also\nfound most of those tin cans, you know. It was a way of if you had a little money to add something to\nwhat you were given in the camp. Now some people did get money on a fairly regular basis in Gurs\nfrom relatives. The money would be paid out, whatever the amount was. That led to a tremendous\ninflation in the black market. So that we found ourselves in the situation where only a certain amount\nof money twice a month would be paid out to limit the amount of money that was available to people.\nSo the black market or the inflation of the black market couldn't go even higher. The ones who had\nvery little money or who got very little money from the outside were not totally shut out from buying\nsome food, right, or whatever was available. Also we instituted at that time a percentage of whatever\nmoney you got had to be put in a welfare fund. I don't remember what the percentage was, maybe\n10% or whatever, I really don't remember that. But it had to be collected from everyone who got\nmoney and was given to the people who had no money whatsoever, who had no relatives who could\nafford to send them any money or had no relatives on the outside. So they also could have a few",
        "23\npennies in their pockets to buy something to add to their diet, whatever was available. Some people\nkicked a lot when they had to give up a couple of percentages of what they got. My poor mother was\nin charge of collecting this money in the barracks and there was always a hassle about this especially\nfrom some people. But as a whole, it was done well and it was a necessity.\nAnthony: Socialism is not dead?\nHanna: It was not dead, no.\nAnthony: There were reluctant socialists in the barracks?\nHanna: There was some reluctance, yes. It's funny enough, it's always the same thing. The ones who\ngot the most money, kicked the most.\nAnthony: Kicked the most, yeah. And probably complained too?\nHanna: Yes.\nAnthony: How about like with these portable stoves? Those who had them, was it possible for\nsomeone who didn't have portable stove to use someone else's?\nHanna: Oh, sure. That was not, you know, that was not a problem. When I finish, you can have it.\nThat was not...\nAnthony: So they were shared?\nHanna: Yeah.\nAnthony: The food that was cooked. Obviously it was possible to prepare your own food and this\nwould have been smuggled?\nHanna: Well, prepared -- whatever you got, you made something out of it, you know. When we left\nGermany, my aunt went into the kitchen to get some food, which she had never in her life done --\ncooked. She didn't know anything about cooking. What she took, she thought it was sugar. Actually, it\nturned out to be farina. That was a much better deal to have the farina because you could make sort of\na porridge out of it, if you wished. Sure it was only water, right, but it was at least something. So that\nlasted for a little while. Maybe, you could later on buy a can of milk or you got some food packages\nfrom somewhere, which we could receive. You used whatever was in there and made meals out of it.\nMeals is an exaggeration, some additional food.\nAnthony: You had some amateur cooks that were---? The image now 1s not one of people cooking\nevery night -- it's not like your American barbecue and Fourth of July, right?",
        "24\nHanna: No, no, absolutely not. It was an occasional thing. It was not...\nAnthony: These are not heavily used?\nHanna: No, it was not a daily thing. It was an occasional thing.\nAnthony: Very occasional.\nHanna: Right. [Male voice: \u201cSo occasional that I really don't have a recollection that my mother ever\ncooked.\"]\nAnthony: Did the men do it?\nHanna: Less.\nAnthony: Less. Were these portable stoves present in the men's section?\nHanna: [\"Some of them, yeah. But I mean, you know, mostly it was a man who acquired it from the\nSpanish and it ended up in the women's barracks.\u201c*]\nAnthony: Yeah, could you estimate how many of these were in use, just estimate?\nHanna: No way.\nAnthony: No way?\nHanna: No way.\nAnthony: Not even between the two of you, you couldn't?\nHanna: No, I really couldn't estimate how many of these makeshift...\nAnthony: What would be a minimum number that you would have seen or smelled?\nHanna: I really couldn't tell. Whatever I would tell you might not be right. And so I rather not put\nmyself down to a number.\nAnthony: They were there?\nHanna: They were there.\nAnthony: At least a handful?",
        "25\nHanna: Oh, yeah. You will even find pictures and I am sure the museum has some pictures of these\nstoves. There is a woman sitting in front of one of these doing whatever cooking she can.\nAnthony: So it was possible to get warm food but only if you did it yourself.\nHanna: Occasionally, occasionally. [\"We got warm food the only thing is what quality was the food\nwe got. \"|\nAnthony: And the quantity?\nHanna: Non-existent. [\"And the quantity. The nutritional value was non-existent.\u2019 |\nAnthony: These empty cans, these large cans you're talking about, by any chance, could these be cans\nof food that had been sent to the camp for the prisoners?\nHanna: It could have been food. Well they were rather large as I described. It could be that they were\ncans that came into the so-called kitchen which was like a field kitchen, an open thing with, you\nknow. That maybe some canned food came into these kitchens, I do not remember it but it is possible.\n[\"I rather suspect that most of these cans came from the French personnel and the Spanish...\"]\nAnthony: Prisoners?\nHanna: [\"No, sanitation detail just picked them up wherever they found them and didn't throw them\naway but kept them for...\" |\nAnthony: Recycling?\nHanna: [\"Recycling.\"] Everything was recycled.\nAnthony: You never saw any of these cans with the original label on them? They had already been\nstripped of their labels?\nHanna: Whatever it was, it was stripped. But they were around and they did help and when anything\nwas available, they were used.\nAnthony: Real kitchens were not available?\nHanna: Real kitchens? No. There was -- in each block was a field kitchen and that was it.\nAnthony: Did anyone, to your knowledge, bring portable kitchens? I know it's been said that...\nHanna: No. No portable stove was brought. A lot of peculiar things were taken along like coffee\nmills. I mean, the most impossible things were taken along. No.",
        "26\nAnthony: There was no opportunity, for example, to use electrical appliances?\nHanna: Absolutely not. Absolutely not.\nAnthony: This is a very, very primitive--?\nHanna: There was electricity in each barracks but there was no -- there wouldn't have been a hookup\nfor anything. [\"Don't forget in those days, electrical appliances were much less frequent than they are\ntoday.\" |\nAnthony: That's right, yes, yes.\nHanna: You had no electrical... [\"You had no electrical appliances, so to speak, especially not heavy\nappliances.\"] There was no such thing, there was maybe -- maybe some people took along a little field\nthing. You know, like you have -- fed by, what is this stuff called, it comes in a can --.\u201d\nAnthony: Propane?\nHanna: No, little cans. [\"There were little drops of (unclear?) (\u00a2.242)\"] It was like dried alcohol. It\nwas like little bars of dried alcohol that you would ignite and maybe one other person had taken one\nof those little things but they usually only were for a cup or two, at most. [\u201cEventually, other fuel ran\nout.\"] Then there was no more. But to say that anyone brought along any sort of cooking facility,\nappliances, or whatever, that is silly. Just plain silly, that's plain silly and not thought out. Because if\nyou're being deported you don't think of these things. Surely people grabbed peculiar stuff but not\nthat, you know...like the one woman who had taken along a coffee mill. Now what in the heck she\ngrabbed that heavy coffee mill for, it was a Turkish one at that, a brass one, you know, I mean\nridiculous. [\"Don't forget most people didn't have more than two hours time to get their stuff together\nand pack.\" |\nAnthony: You were an exception?\nHanna: [\" I was an exception.\"]\nAnthony: How did they wake you up in the morning at camp? Particular wake-up time?\nThere was no--?\nHanna: Oh, yes. In the beginning there was a supervising person who came into the barracks and\ncounted heads. God forbid if one of the kids had slipped under the blanket and the number didn't\ncome up right.\nAnthony: So they counted you in your beds?",
        "27\nHanna: In the beginning, yes.\nAnthony: And these were beds or bunks?\nHanna: No, no, no. We were on the floor.\nAnthony: On the floor?\nHanna: We were on the floor. She was a very nasty person. She would come in in the morning and\ncount heads around 6:30, 7:00 o'clock. When we had small children with us in the barracks. You\nknow how small kids are. They are covered up to over their heads and she wouldn't immediately see\nthem. She would be furious if she didn't come out to the right count, and she would go over it and\nover it till she had all the numbers right.\nAnthony: These were wooden floors?\nHanna: Wooden floors. The barracks were wood. They were only covered with tar paper, nothing\nelse. That's why we had so many leaks. No, we were on the floor. We were on straw. Open straw in\nthe beginning, they just had bales of straw in the beginning when we arrived. Later on they gave us\nsomething to stuff the straw in, to make something that was a kin to a mattress.\nAnthony: More like a stable for animals than a bedroom?\nHanna: Exactly, absolutely. In the beginning we were about 60 people per barracks. Later on, it sort\nof thinned out.\nAnthony: Then how did people go to sleep? Did they just lie down and fall asleep or was there an\nhour, a moment when everything was--?\nHanna: I guess around ten o'clock or so, everybody, especially in winter, was ready to... [\" Wasn't the\nlight shut off?\"] No, the light was not shut off during the night. The light was on.\nAnthony: All night?\nHanna: They were on, at least one was on in the barracks so you could sort of... But around 10, I\nshould think, 10, 11 o'clock, people sort of tried to go to sleep. You know, whatever sleep...\nAnthony: How many muddy feet did you have to walk to get to the toilet facilities?",
        "Hanna: [\u201cThat depended on the location of the barracks.\"| Barracks, depends. Some were very close\nto the latrine, some were rather far away so it was... [\"I was in the barrack, for instance, where I could\ngo on the rear and be closer to the latrine.\"] We were sort of in the middle of the block so we had\nquite a hike. [My mother was also in the middle of the block.\"| So it was quite a hike.",
        "28\nAnthony: Did resourcefulness enable you to deal with the mud problem, that is walking? Footwear?\nWere you able to--?\nHanna: Well, in the beginning, we had our own shoes.\nAnthony: They were not designed for this kind of hiking?\nThey were not designed for that sort of thing and you would sink in and they would be, of course, full\nof mud. You would go and maybe when the water was running and wash them off and put them\nsomewhere to dry out. If you were stupid enough to hang them on the fence as I did once, they\ndisappeared. So I lost a good pair of shoes that way in the very beginning. [\"That was irreplaceable.\"]\nIrreplaceable.\nAnthony: What did you replace them with?\nHanna: [| had other shoes and when I worked in the office...\nAnthony: Because you had brought another pair with you? Otherwise -- what if -- maybe you even\nknew of someone -- what if you didn't have shoes? What if your shoes had been stolen or they were\nworn out, did anyone make provisions?\nHanna: Not that I can remember. Now in the... I worked in the office after some time, and I was a\nmessenger and stuff for the office. Each block has its own office which then had to report to\nheadquarters. They had a pair of rubber boots. I don't know how they had acquired them but they had\na pair of rubber boots. So when I had to run the errands...\nAnthony: You could borrow them?\nHanna: I had these to get around in.\nAnthony: You had to return them?\nHanna: Absolutely. They stayed there.\nAnthony: Now given the lateness of the year, when you were deported, imagine that people took\nwinter coats with them?\nHanna: Yes, most people had taken winter clothes and no matter how much we had, we were still\ncold. No matter how many layers we managed to put on, we were still cold because it was damp and it\nGurs through everything. So that the clothes never was really dry. You know, this dampness went\nthrough everything somehow.",
        "29\nAnthony: How was laundry done?\nHanna: Laundry was done whenever the water was running. There were some troughs which in the\nbeginning were troughs where we had to wash, out in the open. Later on the women, at least, had a\nbarracks with running water. [\"We never did.\"] There were some...\nAnthony: Men did not have--.\nHanna: It was simply a long basin probably about two feet across and maybe six, eight feet long. It\nwas tin-lined. Above it was a pipe and simply had holes in it so the water would come out along these\nholes and the holes were placed probably eight, ten inches apart, something like that. There was the\nwater coming out of both sides of the pipe. That was our facility to wash. But at least it was indoors, it\nwas closed. We weren't standing in full view of the main street of the camp which the men always had\nto do. The troughs that were outside, they were wooden troughs, we used that to wash the laundry. So\nit was always a fight who was going to get the trough to put the laundry in there to wash. Since we\nhad very little soap, we sort of soaked the laundry and let it soak before we would use soap to wash it.\nIt was a hardship, especially in winter when it was cold. The water was ice-cold. Water was limited to\nthree times a day for about two hours. So it was very difficult.\nAnthony: And you would line-dry the ---?\nHanna: We would line-dry. On the barbed wire, we would line-dry our belongings and stay with it.\nOtherwise, bye-bye.\nAnthony: Stolen? Socialism has a way of becoming robbery?\nHanna: Right. Look, some people came with very little. The Spanish people who were in the camp\nfor years had very little. So ...\nAnthony: You were rich compared to them?\nHanna: We were rich compared to them in many ways. They had many more small children that we\nhad, in comparison. [\"They were too much younger.\"] They were much younger, of course, we were\nan over-aged group of people basically, you know. Because most of the young people, whoever could\nhad left Germany, right, and left behind were a small group of young people, a small group of\nchildren but mostly over-age people.\nAnthony: In fact, I still remember your description of the deportation -- you and six old women.\nHanna: Five old.\nAnthony: Being escorted by how many guards?",
        "30\nHanna: Twelve.\nAnthony: Twelve guards.\nHanna: Twelve guards with six helpless women.\nAnthony: Was the water drinkable?\nHanna: The water in camp, yes. We could drink the water.\nAnthony: This came from the Pyrenees?\nHanna: No. The water could -- you know there's a lot of water in France you cannot drink but the\nwater in Gurs, you could drink it. There was no problem there. [\"It probably came down from the\nmountains.\"] I have no idea where it came from. There was a water tank, very high up, as a matter of\nfact and insufficient, insufficient for the amount of people. That's why we were so limited with water.\nThere is a picture of Gurs, I'm sure you have seen it. It is actually taken from that water tower.\nAnthony: The water had better be drinkable since they were probably not serving wine.\n[\"No. \"|\nHanna: Hardly.\nAnthony: You never saw anybody drinking wine, right?\n[\"Oh, I wouldn't say that. Iam sure that I saw in the hospital. Particularly when I was down there.\nThe French personnel had access to wine.\"|\nAnthony: Of course, yeah, yeah.\nHanna: Not the refugees, not the prisoners. [\"Neither would we spend the money on something as\nfrivolous as wine.\"] Look, in the beginning when we came to Gurs, we left Germany with 100 marks\nwhich was exchanged to us for 2,000 francs, right? In the very beginning, when we came, my mother\nhad a chance to buy one egg from a Spanish woman. This one egg was 15 francs, okay. You have\n2,000 francs. One egg was 15 francs. You think anyone would spend money on anything frivolous.\nAnthony: No, although the French would not consider wine to be frivolous.\n[\"No.\"]\nAnthony: Can you give us some more idea of what the prices were? Do you remember other\npurchases?",
        "31\nHanna: No, I don't really. But this really stuck in my mind that 15 francs for one egg.\nAnthony: The 2,000 francs are not going to last very long?\nHanna: No, no.\nAnthony: Especially if you have to buy a stove?\nHanna: Or whatever. [\"Eventually we had canteens.\"|] They were started by the Spanish. They were\nrun by the Spanish in our block. [\"In your block. In our block we started our own. We had one in the\nhospital which was run by Franken where you could buy some stuff...\"|\nAnthony: You mean Mr. Franken? Lily\u2019s ?\nHanna: Lily's husband. [\"I was able to help him to get this which gave him some little income. You\ncould buy certain things like cans of beans at more reasonable prices than the black market.\" |\nAnthony: Yeah, even cruddy prices on the sardines?\nHanna: No, but in our block, in Block K, the canteen that existed when we came was run by the\nSpanish women. The way we talked to them, actually my aunt, Helena Goldstein, spoke a fluent\nItalian, and so she could deal with the Spanish women.\nAnthony: Yeah, they're close enough, Italian and Spanish.\nHanna: She managed, and that's the way my aunt would, you know, manage to speak to them and\ndeal with them. What the others did, I don't know. I guess with hand and any old way. Eventually,\neveryone learned a couple of words of Spanish and they learned a couple of words of German, or\nFrench or...\nAnthony: French above all, right?\nHanna: Well, there were not too many among us who spoke French. I know and some of us were\nreluctant to learn French but eventually we all did, didn't we? They had to, we all had to. [\"Those of\nus who did speak French were somewhat--had an advantage.\"] Had an advantage, definitely.\nAnthony: The stubborn ones who didn't want to learn French learned eventually, right?\nHanna: Yes. Their life depended on it, eventually. [\"The trouble you had if you spoke French was to\nacquire a sufficient amount of knowledge of the local dialect. Because a lot of the people who worked\nthere were locals. This was not French.\"]",
        "32\nAnthony: Not Parisian French?\nHanna: [\"It wasn't even French.\"] It was not literary French. It was not only not literary French, it\nwas almost Spanish.\"]\nAnthony: Yeah, or Casablanca...\nHanna: Yeah, it sort of changes there.\n[\u201cI had an awful amount of trouble to learn this.\"|\nAnthony: You thought you knew French, and you found out that you had to re-learn it?\nHanna: He did, he did.\nAnthony: No, but I mean he had to re-learn that French.\n[\"At the time I left there, we communicated very well.\"]\nAnthony: And then you had to go back to your more literary form of French when you finally got to\nSwitzerland?\n[\"Yeah.\"]\nHanna: But you know... Even that French is a little bit different, isn't it?\n[\"Sure. That French is slightly different but not like Spanish.\"] Like in any country, regionally the\nlanguage changes. [\"But by and large, the personnel in the Swiss internment complexes -- we had\nGerman Swiss, not French Swiss.\"]\nAnthony: They spoke Volksdeutsch?\nHanna: No, they spoke German. Swissdeutsch. But they know proper German, they're being taught\nproper German in school.
