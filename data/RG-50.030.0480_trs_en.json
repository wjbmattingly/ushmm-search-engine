        "A: -- now you remind me. Mostly was a economical problem. And that\u2019s -- if we call this anti-\nSemitism, that\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s was economical. Jewish people was hardworking, s-stood close\ntogether and was the same token, more successful. And Po -- Polish people, specially on -- on the\neast, was more lazy, like all the Russian this time. Not produce so much, not educated so much.\nAnd start the different between Jewish more educated and -- and born on the east part of the\nPoland, more lazy and more -- not created. So -- and that\u2019s was all time the different economical.\nNot only anti-Semitic -- I understand, because you are Jewish, you are no good. You are a Polish\n-- Polish, you are good -- you are good. And question is, economical -- the answer is economical\nbase. That\u2019s if somebody called the anti-Semitism, that\u2019s not right. I not feel this way. Was some\npeople was, from the point of view.

        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: That\u2019s not so easy, because somebody special, who never know in conspiracy, and never\nknow the organization Armia Krajowa think we supposed to do more, or why you not do this,\nhow you not -- that\u2019s was everything calculated, you know. If you do something good for one\nperson and lost two person home, that\u2019s not make sense. And etcetera.

I understand for example, the New York Jewish\norganization cannot give the guns, cannot give ammunition, and can\u2019t give the money -- money,\nand for money, American money, you can buy in Poland this time, everything. And that\u2019s my\npoint, the personal point view.",

        "A: -- we -- that\u2019s was a family affair. We live close to Vistula river, and each evening, if it\u2019s not\nimportant other thing to do, we go all together, walking maybe two miles close to Vistula river,\nwe walk. And this time was very popular walking on this special sidewalk, white sidewalk near\nthe Vistula river. Everybody go there, thousand people going one way, other way, and -- and we\ngo all the time with her father and mother. And then my father [indecipherable] now we must be\n[indecipherable] we must walk. That\u2019s was something -- something important. And during\nSunday for example, was very important for us, we go -- because we are Christian -- Catholic,\nwe walk to mass during morning hours, Sunday. We must be dressed, clean dressed, and -- you\nknow, and Father and Mother and four children, we walk to church. After the mass we go mostly\nto old town, what for us was very -- from historical point of view, and also architectural point of\nview, because my father has very good taste, and -- I mean not only for eating taste, and for\nseeing some ma -- structure, like buildings. Like for example dresses, or something thing and\nhistorical part, we go to [indecipherable] town and s -- we walk around and Father point out and\nthis is this house, belong to these people, then the other people took some [indecipherable]\nmuseum and so and so.

My father come back from the prison -- mean the farm prison, and come\nback to Warsaw, and start working aw -- eight -- for example, propa -- he was about 20 years\nold, working for state like Marines, on Vistula river, because during this time, if you has -- are 18\nye -- or -- year -- years old, you cannot create a good education, because was very tough during\nthe sn -- Russian occupation. Russian occupation was everything against the education, not like\nin other part of this time -- a other part of the Poland, li-ike Austria, or Germany, was much\neasier to educate that -- himself. In Russian part was not so easy, and my father c-come back\nfrom the ne -- I call this prison, and start working, like I said before, for na -- state, and start\neducated himself. I remember I was maybe five years old, I remember good, to our house each\ndays or two days, came some student from the Polytechnical Institute, and give the technical\ninstruction, technical education for my father for a couple years. In other words, my father was\nself-educated man. And was probably good student, because resulted in his life was very, very\nsuccessful.

        "A: Yes, oh yes, we -- we was all the time a very political family. Why? Because my parents grow\nand grandparents grow in atmosphere where we was -- where the people like free Poland.\n[indecipherable] Poland was divided by three parts German, Austrian and Russia, and was\nfighting and was simpatic for freedom of the Poland.

Each child costs, for\nexample in gymnasium, mean the high school, was private high school, and was state high\nschool. If you cannot go to state high school, you must pay. And this costs this time, 80 zloty,\nand fellow who work in the bank, like [indecipherable] or fellow who work in the post office,\ntake only 200 dollars mon -- monthly. And you must pay for one child 80 zloty. And I was\nmaybe lucky because my parents paid for me only part of this, because I was good student, and\nhappened I pay less. And my two sister and brother, that\u2019s was big money monthly, pay for\neducation.

        "A: In elementary school, yes. Only was two in this area, was not a Jewish area --",
        "A: -- because you know in Warsaw, a part -- the Jewish Warsaw located mostly in one part of the\nWarsaw. The north part na -- close to Narlefki and this area. And where I live, I live close to\nVistula river, was not many Jew, and s -- Jewish people, and still was two young guy who was\nup to twa -- 14 years old, we was together in school, and you know, was very nice guy, on --\npoor, and still was [indecipherable] this young people go to Palestine.

        "A: And for example, the concentration camp, very important thing. In Poland was, before the\nwar, three and a half m-million Jewish people. The biggest concentration in Poland -- in Europe.\nMean was for Jewish people, was some chance better like in Germany or France. And German\nknow this after the war, and before too, the big concentration Jewish people in Poland, that\u2019s,\nfrom my point of view, was created and yet -- and German created so many concentration camps\nin Poland. One of the important concentration camp was Auschwitz. The Auschwitz was built\nfirst couple weeks after a war was [indecipherable] 1939, and first prisoner was not Jewish\npeople, was Catholic people. And which one Catholic people? All professors from university. All\nthe lawyers, engineers, and clergy was sent first to concentration camp, Auschwitz. That\u2019s first\nthere was only Polish people was there, and was not directly kill, only hard labor created the\ndeaths. 1941 start Jewish people there, and start the death camp. Concentration camp that\u2019s the\none part, people dying because was overwork. And death camp, was sent there and killed.",
        "A: That\u2019s was the different and this must be straight, because I was in concentration camp, not in\nAuschwitz, only in Flossenbirg, that\u2019s was political prison during -- before the war \u201939, where\nHitler put all opponents, own party, to concentration camp. Many German people was there,\nthat\u2019s was political prison. And that\u2019s my own concentration camp.",

Like the J-Jewish people has m-more educated in this time -- part --\npart, not all, because if we talking about the Jewish, we must divide -- and the problem is, we\nmust divide between -- up to bucar -- Vistula river west, and Vistula river east. Vistula river west\nwas not big su -- problem. West -- excuse me, east, was mostly people very sympatic to\nCommunist regime. Socialist Communist regime. On the west part of the Poland, I mean, from\nthe Vistula river, was little differ -- different and was from German idea anti-Semitic, and was\nnot catch all of nation.

Jewish people was hardworking, s-stood close\ntogether and was the same token, more successful. And Po -- Polish people, specially on -- on the\neast, was more lazy, like all the Russian this time. Not produce so much, not educated so much.\nAnd start the different between Jewish more educated and -- and born on the east part of the\nPoland, more lazy and more -- not created.
